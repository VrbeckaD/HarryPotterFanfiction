    <p class="p1">Draco sucked in a deep shuddering breath in an effort to regain his senses. He shook off the disorienting tumble of colors and terror, swiping angrily at the tear tracks running down his face. Thoughts and feelings were spiraling towards him, fighting for prominence in his already overcrowded brain, and he knew there had to be some way to stop the barrage.<br/> <b></b></p>
<p class="p1">But he didn’t know how.</p>
<p class="p1">He couldn't settle his racing heart or his disgraceful trembling hands. Even when he screwed up his eyes tight against the darkness, the tears leaked out from under his eyelids and left hot streaks running down his face. He couldn't stop the tidal wave of memories. All he could do was taste the coppery tang of blood and breathe in the harsh smoke surrounding him.</p>
<p class="p2">It had been like this ever since he returned to Hogwarts. As soon as he got into bed, the nightmares would take over, creating their own world for him to live in.</p>
<p class="p2">The daylight was what made it okay. When the sun rose everything felt softer, more diffused. As long as he avoided everyone during the day, he didn't have to deal with the hostile stares boring holes into his back. It was easy enough to ignore the whispers and mutters and jeers that followed him as he walked to class with his head down, and he was getting very good at pretending not to feel the muttered stinging jinxes aimed at his back.</p>
<p class="p2">He didn’t blame them.</p>
<p class="p2">Inevitably, though, the daytime would fade into night - and for some reason, it was as if the dark drove all rational thoughts and solutions from his mind. Not even dreamless sleep could forestall the inevitable visions of fire that seared themselves into his eyelids, lasting long after he woke up. No number of potions or spells could get rid of the screams, the acrid smell, the salty taste of tears, the sticky blood he could feel dripping through his fingers, the waves and waves of pain washing over him.</p>
<p class="p2"><em>Fuck. </em>Thinking about this wasn't helping.</p>
<p class="p2">With a shaky gasp, Draco threw back the sheet that he had become entangled with, trying to smooth back his matted hair that was now soaked with sweat. It made him cringe slightly, his cheeks heating up with embarrassment to feel the rivulets across his brow. <em>He was a Malfoy. He should be in control.</em></p>
<p class="p2">He did the only thing he knew how to do. His shoes were already waiting by his bed, arranged carefully so that he could step right into them from his bed. He slipped out of the stifling dungeons and up towards the front doors. It was a path he knew well.</p>
<p class="p2">A breeze of frigid air washed over him as he ventured outside, chilling and calming him at the same time. Somehow, it provided an immediate relief, draining the tension from his stance as he took in the moonlit grounds and crisp white snow that lay before him.</p>
<p class="p2">Being outside during the night was like stepping into a whole different world. This was a world that could be <em>his. </em>He wasn't hated here. He didn't hate <em>himself </em>here.</p>
<p class="p2">Nothing that he had done before actually mattered among the snow and darkness.</p>
<p class="p2">It was almost possible to pretend that he had never been a death eater. Alone as he carefully made his way towards the lake, he seemed to be the only person left in the world. He had come this way many times, and would have been able to find his way even without the moonlight guiding him.</p>
<p class="p2">The frosty air stung his chest as he sat down at the edge of the ice covered expanse, reveling in how alive he felt. As he reached for his wand, the fear he had felt earlier seemed so distant. None of that mattered.</p>
<p class="p2"><em>“Glaciescultro," </em>he whispered under his breath, his voice sounding impossibly loud against the muffled night. The blanket of snow silenced everything but him. His shoes transformed, and he let out a breath at the familiar sensation that they had turned to liquid metal, molding themselves around his feet.</p>
<p class="p2">He stood up carefully, pushing away from the powdery earth. Mesmerizing white puffs swirled around him, tiny clouds of breath that hung in the frozen night sky. He took little, practiced steps, his bladed feet slicing perfect hash marks into the untouched snow.</p>
<p class="p2">With his first step onto the ice, everything else in the world melted away from him. Even the grounds disappeared from his view. Now all his focus was on the lake. It was just him and the ice, working together in perfect undeniable synchrony.</p>
<p class="p2">The winter wind was biting at him, trying to beat him down as it whipped furiously against him, but he didn't <em>care. </em>He pushed back against it, gliding and twirling over the ice, pure unbridled joy leaping through him as he spun around through the darkness. He could feel giddy laughter building up inside him, his unfathomable happiness threatening to pour out for the world to see.</p>
<p class="p2">Out here, he felt powerful. He could control it all; the way the ice seemed to yield to him as he cut across the lake, building up speed, twisting perfectly to avoid every imperfection and blemish on the surface.</p>
<p class="p2">Out here, he was free.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<hr/>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p2">Harry couldn't sleep either.</p>
<p class="p2">He wasn't sure why, exactly. It wasn't that something in particular was bothering him - no, he just couldn't seem to get comfortable. No matter how much he tossed and turned, his pillow was lumpy in all the wrong places, and his mattress seemed intent on fighting back against him.</p>
<p class="p2">With a frustrated sigh, Harry sat up and rubbed his tired eyes. He reached absentmindedly for his wand, muttering a careless <em>lumos, </em>and then leaning back against the red and gold hangings of his bed.</p>
<p class="p2">He was restless. He needed to do something<em>, </em>and apparently, that something was not sleeping.</p>
<p class="p2">Instinctively, he looked to his trunk as if it held all the answers, eyes trailing forlornly over school textbooks and unfinished homework. Well, he wasn't <em>that </em>desperate for something to do. In his aimless scanning, a piece of parchment caught his eye.</p>
<p class="p2">He reached down, fingers stretching towards it, trying to reach it without falling out of his bed. Belatedly he realized he could’ve just done a summoning charm, but then his fingers found what they had been seeking, and he pulled the innocent looking paper towards him.</p>
<p class="p2">He touched his wand gently to the center, murmuring the words that were already waiting on the tip of his tongue. “<em>I solemnly swear that I’m up to no good."</em></p>
<p class="p2">He scanned the map that was budding from where his wand had touched the paper, the familiarity of all this making him smile. The map had completely slipped his mind until he'd seen it tucked away in the corner of his trunk.</p>
<p class="p2">It was one in the morning, and most of the castle was sound asleep, their stationary black dots bathed in the electric blue light from his wand. He could see Filch pacing a deserted upstairs corridor, doubtless trying to catch some poor first year.</p>
<p class="p2">But Filch wasn't the only one moving. Another figure drew Harry's attention, slowly making their way towards the front door. Harry squinted, bringing the map closer to his face, trying to read the minisculely penned label.</p>
<p class="p2">
  <em>Draco Malfoy.</em>
</p>
<p class="p2">Harry stared at it for a second, his senses automatically heightened and on alert. What on earth was Malfoy doing in the corridors at one in the morning?</p>
<p class="p2">His first instinct was to assume that Malfoy was up to something again. Hermione’s exasperated voice rang in the back of mind, and after a moment, he realized it just didn't fit. When he tried to reconcile the new Malfoy with some evil plot, he couldn't seem to do it.</p>
<p class="p2">The new Malfoy had apologized to him, the first day of their term. To all of them - Hermione, Ron, Hagrid, McGonagall, everyone. He had sought them all out privately and apologized.</p>
<p class="p2">Harry still remembered it vividly. How could he forget it? Malfoy had been so eerily calmly and composedly when he asked if he could have a word. <em>Sorry. </em>That was the only thing he had been able to get out before he had quietly left the room. Harry hadn’t even gotten the chance to respond, and he had been left standing there, dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="p1">In fact, that was the only thing Harry had heard him say the entire year. After that, he had seemed to retreat within himself, not talking to anybody. He wore an impeccable mask, his face smooth and unyielding, giving nothing away. Anytime a question was thrust upon him, he tried to get away with a crisp nod or shake of his head.</p>
<p class="p1">Harry didn't know how to act around him anymore. It was too confusing, getting quiet nods of acknowledgement instead of sneers and taunts. So instead of trying to figure out how to react, he had just respected the distance Malfoy put between himself and the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="p1">It had almost been easier to just let Malfoy go his own way, and not have to work through his confusion and their lurking enmity. This way, they just didn't interact.</p>
<p class="p1">Despite their seeming agreement to avoid each other, it made absolutely no sense why Malfoy was walking towards the lake in the middle of the night. Harry’s exhaustion was a little voice in the back of his head, whispering that the obvious solution was to go investigate.</p>
<p class="p1">So of course, having nothing better to do, he quietly swung his legs out of bed.</p>
