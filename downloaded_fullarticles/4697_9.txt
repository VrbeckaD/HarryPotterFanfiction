  <em>Hoot hoot....hoot...</em>
</p><p>The darkness of the forest was a constant force, pressing down around everyone in the village of Hogsmeade. Most nights, when the woods were at their darkest, the villagers would be huddled up in their modest homes, curled up by a very warm, very bright fire. Younger people would try to scare each other with stories of what allegedly lived in the forest.</p><p>But not tonight. </p><p>While everyone still stuck close to the inner borders of Hogsmeade, they were outside, and that was enough to count for <em>something </em>at least. </p><p>Huddled even closer, in the far back of the group, was a midwife and her charge, still very round with pregnancy. The baby was due any day now.</p><p>"D-do you think he's dead yet?" </p><p>"I reckon so, dear," the midwife said in a soft, assuring voice, "but still we should wait, at least till dawn." </p><p>The redheaded woman nodded, her hands resting firmly atop her swollen abdomen. </p><p>"Have you decided yet?" </p><p>"Yes. I'm going to keep him myself." This way, he'd at least have her love- everyone else in Hogsmeade frowned upon children like this one, born out of unrequited love or, worse still, lust, and likely to harbor either the victim's resentment or the assailant's wickedness. </p><p>The midwife's lips curled into a smile.</p><p>"You truly are kind, Lily." </p><p>The younger woman said nothing, and instead hissed as she felt her water break. The midwife looked at her knowingly.</p><p>"Aye!" The gathering of people looked at her. "The child's coming now!" Then, with not a word more, the middle-aged woman supported the trembling Lily and guided her to her house, closest to where they were. </p>
<hr/><p>The piercing cry of a newborn boy split the air of the cozy hut. The midwife was quick to cut the umbilical cord and wash the baby, and even quicker to wrap him in a pink cotton blanket and place him in his mother's arms. </p><p>"Such a lovely child..." Lily cooed, looking down into her son's bright eyes which mirrored her own. "My lovely son..."</p><p>"Have you named him?" The midwife asked as she began cleaning her tools.</p><p>"Yes," Lily said with a nod. Her son had settled and was now just looking around, his eyes wide and curious.</p><p>"I'll name him Hadrian, after my uncle, and James after my grandfather."</p>
<hr/><p>In the years that followed, Hadrian- Harry, the villagers called him- proved to be nothing at all like the exiled James Potter who'd contributed in his conception.</p><p>  Where James was often angry, Harry was usually very calm. Where James loved playing cruel, oftentimes hurtful pranks, Harry was always considerate of others, and the rudest thing he did was pick a flower from Mrs. Tonks's flowerbox to give to Mrs. Malfoy- and even that was "because she looked sad and mummy says flowers make everyone happy". </p><p>Most importantly, though; when James went to the forest every night to pick fights with its inhabitants, Harry only ever went during the day, to pick herbs that he could sell to Mrs. Longbottom or Mr. Snape for their healing teas and poultices. </p><p>And even though his mother often asked him not to, this was the one thing he continued to do anyway. It was the only way he could get money for her, after all, and it seemed to be working fine.</p><p>Or at least, it did until winter.</p><p>Of course, winter was always difficult, but this year- the winter after his eleventh birthday- was especially hard. It was longer, lasting all through March and stopping April 4th. </p><p>Because of all the snow that'd piled up, food was a bit more scarce, and thus, more expensive. On top of that, however, Lily fell ill with a fever, so she and Harry had to spend extra money on medicine. </p><p>And so, when the snow <em>finally </em>melted away, their funds were low enough to cause concern. </p><p>Lily, who'd been doing various odd jobs to earn money before, grew desparate for the funds necessary to take care of her son, and began sneaking out at night to do only she knew what.</p><p>In the meantime, Harry continued selling the herbs he'd gathered- which, due to a generous amount of luck, were usually rare ones he'd just stumbled across laying by the entrance of the forest just outside Hogsmeade- and when he wasn't doing that, he took to dancing in the street.</p><p>Often his dances were just improvised movements flowing along with his friend Neville's flute, and he ended up dressing as a girl, too, hoping that if he looked like a cute girl, people would be more likely to give him money. </p><p>Slowly, very slowly, Harry and Lily were raising their funds to what they'd been the previous autumn. </p><p>And this is where our story truly begins- on a late spring day, just after noon, in the village square where the mayor and townspeople had come to an unwittingly unanimous decision to take lunch outside and admire the delicate, decidedly <em>sin-less </em>dancing boy.</p>
