    <p>“Duck!!” you screamed, throwing yourself underneath the table just before your cauldron’s ominous rumbles became a volcanic eruption.</p><p>“Protego!” a dark voice shouted loudly, making you dare to leave the safety of the work-desk and peek over the tabletop, staring at the two brothers, who were covered by the ominously smoking red goo that had just exploded out of your cauldron and splattered onto the twins.</p><p>“Fíli! Kíli!” you cried, jumping to your feet.</p><p>“Evanesco!” the Professor cast, vanishing the goo instantly. You stared apprehensively as your black-clad potions teacher descended on you, his fury an almost visible cloud around him. “Miss Grey, what exactly did you just do?” he hissed silkily. You swallowed nervously.</p><p>“Sorry, sir,” you whispered, knowing you’d be getting a tongue-lashing from your head of House later. Kimberly-Anne was smirking at you from the next bench, and you wanted to stick your tongue out at her, but that wouldn’t be in keeping with the House Rules of Slytherin. “I added too much gentian, and then I tried to control the acidity with powdered moonstone, but I couldn’t get enough thestral-hair into my cauldron before it was too late.” You knew better than to add an excuse – there was none, and the fact that you had managed to render your potion non-scalding and <em>probably</em> inert was little comfort in the face of Professor Snape’s displeasure.</p><p>“While the moonstone proves that you may one day become an adequate Mistress of Potions, Miss Grey, you get a zero for the day. Take Misters Durin to the Hospital Wing,” Professor Snape added, his dark eyes glittering.</p><p>“Yes, sir,” you acquiesced, beginning to pack up your bag silently. You left behind your cauldron, still half-full of whatever mess your salvation had created, which you’d have to analyse later as part of your punishment, you knew.</p><p>“Honestly, sir, I feel fine,” Kíli protested, always the first to speak, jumping to your defense. You sighed. Kíli was <em>such</em> a Gryffindor at times, it was nearly painful. Even a couple of exchange students only here for seventh year should <em>know</em> better than to disagree with the Potions Master. You spotted the Gryffindor Head Boy in your peripheral vision, shaking his head at Kíli, who missed the frantic gesture to shut up.</p><p>“Me, too, sir, the potion wasn’t even hot,” Fíli added, slightly less belligerent. The Ravenclaw usually thought things through a little more than his boisterous brother, even if he too suffered from the Gryffindor trait of reckless bravery. You sighed again. Having been partnered with Kíli in Defense and Fíli in Charms, you’d gotten to know both twins reasonably well in the two months since school started. “I don’t think we need to go to the Hospital Wing,” Fíli continued, sounding quite reasonable.</p><p>“Fifteen points from Ravenclaw and Gryffindor, Misters Durin, for disrespecting my orders. Miss Grey, escort Misters Durin to the Hospital Wing, and inform Madam Pomfrey that none of you are allowed to leave until I can assess you later. Take notes.” Professor Snape added, his voice dropping into dangerous levels. You nodded mutely, turning your head to glare desperately at Kíli, mouthing at the both of them to follow you as you headed towards the door with a nod at your dark professor.</p><p>“Yes, sir,” you opened the door, staring imploringly at Fíli until he tugged Kíli’s arm to make him follow.</p><p> </p><p>“You just <em>had</em> to talk back!” you rounded at Kíli when you reached the Entrance Hall, poking his chest angrily.</p><p>“Hey!” Kíli protested angrily. “I was just defending <em>you!</em>”</p><p>“Your Gryffindor <em>idiocy</em> probably gained me an extra detention!” you seethed, whirling and stomping off towards the Infirmary. You didn’t look back to see if they followed, hearing the heavy threads of their boots behind you.</p><p>“But Snape never punishes Slytherins,” Fíli protested, just before you reached the wide doors. “Everyone knows that!”</p><p>“Ha!” you scoffed. “I thought Eagles were supposed to be cleverer than that. He does punish us. He just chooses to keep discipline where it <em>belongs</em>; in our <em>family</em>.” Neither of them seemed to have an answer. You sighed, knowing it was a common misconception that Professor Snape let the Snakes get away with anything. “I screwed up a potion,” you listed, raising a finger, “it was a simple mistake, but it caused an incident; I will have one detention where I’ll be redoing my potion <em>and</em> writing an essay on what I did wrong and how it affected my work as well as the effects my potion has on its victims, which is why I am staying with you lot. It won’t change my zero grade, of course. <em>Then</em> I’ll have another detention – probably tutoring firsties – because ‘people who make simple mistakes need to go back and study the simple things again’” you quoted the long list of rules and punishments posted in your common room. “On top of that, <em>you two</em> were disrespectful, which lost you points for your own houses and <em>may</em> earn me another study session. I don’t have time for that if I want to pass DADA this semester,” you groaned, pushing open the door.</p><p>“Uncle wouldn’t fail you!” Kíli promised. You laughed. “You’re one of the best in our year at defence!” he added, staring like you had suddenly sprouted an extra head.</p><p>“And I just got both his nephews sent to the Hospital wing.” You waved to Madam Pomfrey, who was reading the small paper airplane that had arrived before you. “Look what happened to Belby last week, after he hexed Kíli in class,” you added. Fíli opened his mouth to protest your analysis.</p><p>“Well, get those robes off and take a shower, Misters Durin,” Madam Pomfrey ordered, interrupting Fíli before he could begin to claim that Belby getting a failing grade for giving Kíli donkey ears in a class on shield spells was not Professor Durin’s transparent revenge. At least <em>your</em> Head of House was more subtle than <em>that</em>, you thought smugly. “Professor Snape will be up after class, and Miss Grey has been assigned the duty of keeping an eye on you till he gets here. You look healthy enough to me, but I’ll run a few diagnostics while we wait.”</p><p>Knowing better than to protest, the two boys trudged into the infirmary bathroom and you heard the sound of running water while Madam Pomfrey summoned a house elf to fetch their pyjamas and had you set up a note taking station between two beds before returning to her office, humming lightly.</p><p>A cry came from the bathroom.</p><p>Looking at Madam Pomfrey’s office door which did not open, you marched over to the bathroom door, yanking the door open and preparing to tell two embarrassed young men that screaming in the bathroom wasn’t funny.</p><p>You stared. Your mouth opened, before closing again on a whimper as you closed your eyes.</p><p>“I’m dead. Professor Durin is going to <em>kill</em> me,” you whispered to yourself.</p><p>“No dead Gwen!” the little blond boy cried, throwing himself – wet and naked – against your legs.</p><p>“My Gwen!” the equally small dark-haired boy claimed, pushing the first boy away to get a better grip on your robes.</p><p>“I’m so <em>dead</em>,” you mumbled, which made both of them burst into tears. “No, no, please, boys, please stop crying,” you cried out, sinking to your knees and wrapping on arm around each of them, panicking when your entreaty did absolutely nothing.</p><p>“My Gwen!” Kíli kept sobbing, while Fíli didn’t seem to remember how words worked, hiding his face in your shoulder.</p><p>“Hush, boys,” you tried, hugging them tight. “Everything is going to be just fine.” Flicking your hand to drop your wand from its wristholster, you aimed a shrinking spell at the two sets of pyjamas the house elf had magicked onto a bench in the corner. A summoning charm brought both set flying, as Kíli climbed into your lap, seemingly intending to nap with your breast as his pillow. Heat flashed in your cheeks. “I so hope neither of you remember this,” you mumbled, trying to wrangle the shirt onto Fíli, who was now sniffling wetly. You wiped away his tears, kissing his small forehead.</p><p>“Not dead?” Fíli asked, staring at you with his giant blue eyes still looking one word away from wailing. You shook your head.</p><p>“Not dead, Fíli, I promise. Can you put the pyjamas on?” he nodded seriously, beginning to struggle with the combination of leg and leghole while you tried to rouse Kíli, whose newfound resting-place was apparently the most comfy he’d ever been, going by his reluctance to sit up. You sighed. “Kíli, can you get your pyjamas on? Your Uncle will be here soon, and then we’ll get this whole thing sorted out, I promise. Just, please, put some clothes on.” Kíli seemed to study you. Then he nodded.</p><p>“My Gwen,” Kíli said solemnly, nodding again and began to pull on his pyjama pants backwards. You chuckled, a little watery, and helped him turn the garment. Buttoning Fíli’s pyjama top, you were surprised when he hugged you again. “Fee!” Kíli shrieked, and then he was wrapped around your middle. Shock made you wrap an arm around both small boys, trying to pretend you knew what you were doing.</p><p>“Well, well, Miss Grey, it seems you’ve found a bit of trouble,” a kindly voice said behind you.</p><p>“P-Professor Dumbledore!” you gasped, instinctively hugging both boys closer. Turning your head to look up at the Headmaster, you felt caught in his gaze.</p><p>“Where are my nephews?!” an irate bellow from the patient ward interrupted anything Dumbledore might have wanted to say. Fíli jumped, pushing past Dumbledore in a flash and running out of the bathroom. Kíli remained where he was, seemingly content to burrow into your hold. Slowly you got to your feet, wondering how such a small boy could feel so heavy.</p><p>“Uncle Thorin!” Fíli shouted happily. “You came!”</p><p>“… Fíli?” Professor Durin replied. “Why do you look four years old?” When you dared to look up, Professor Durin had picked up little Fíli, carrying him far more easily than you were carrying his twin, who was still clinging to you like a burr. “…Kíli?” Professor Durin whispered, staring from one boy to the other.</p><p>“Uncle!” Kíli chirped happily, waving from your hold. “It’s my Gwen!” he announced loudly, tugging on your chocolate curls before putting his head down on your breast once more.</p><p>“Miss Grey,” Professor Durin’s face looked like thunder to you. “Explain yourself!”</p><p>“No yell at Gwen!” Fíli protested, copying his Uncle’s dark scowl perfectly. Professor Durin looked stunned for a moment, though not as stunned as you felt.</p><p>Your explanation – not that you had any idea what you were going to say, really – was postponed by the arrival of Professor Snape, whose supercilious drawl had never been more welcome in the four years he had been your Head of House. “It seems clear to me, Professor Durin, that Miss Grey inadvertently concocted a variant of a de-aging potion.”</p><p>“Can you reverse it, Severus?” Dumbledore asked, placing his hand on your shoulder. Kíli scowled at him, slapping the offending appendage away with a petulant mutter of ‘My Gwen’.</p><p>“I will need to test the residue left behind in Miss Grey’s cauldron, which she placed under stasis in the lab before escorting the two Misters Durin up here,” Professor Snape replied. You were probably the only one who felt warmed by the implicit ‘Well done’ inherent in his words. “We’ll also need to run some tests on the boys.”</p><p>“How soon can you reverse the process?” Professor Durin growled. Professor Snape smirked.</p><p>“I couldn't possibly say -” an obvious lie “- Professor. Potions is not an exact science, after all.”</p><p>“My Gwen,” Kíli piped up, as if that was the most important thing right now. You blushed.</p><p>“Very well, Mister Durin,” Professor Dumbledore said genially. You felt instantly worried. Your grandfather's friend was barmy at the best of times - much like your grandfather, really - but you'd learned to be extra wary of that tone of voice. “I’m sure – in lieu of whatever punishment you had devised for Miss Grey’s accident, Professors, you can both agree that it would be more useful for Miss Grey to take care of the two Misters Durin for the next few days.” He held up a hand when Professor Durin looked like he wanted to protest. “It seems the boys are quite attached to her, and you do have other responsibilities, Professor. Hogwarts is hardly a safe place for two energetic four-year-olds, Miss Grey is the perfect solution.” Turning to you, the twinkle in his eyes revealing deep amusement, he added, “I will excuse you from classes tomorrow, then it’s the weekend and we can reassess the situation on Monday.”</p>
