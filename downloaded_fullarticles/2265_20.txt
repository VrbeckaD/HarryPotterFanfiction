    <p>A small box labeled <i>‘Ear-Bugs’</i> sat on the sitting room table. Pulling the spider-like contraptions out of their packaging, Harry lifted them to either side of his head and startled when they jumped into his ears. After a moment of discomfort, he used his wand to tap the newly added music note on his Muggle Brick. He reeled as music instantly began blaring into his brain. With a yell he couldn’t hear, he clawed at his head, trying to get the Bugs out. Not only did they not budge, they seemed to be trying to burrow in deeper. Eyes beginning to tear, he desperately grabbed for the Brick and his fallen wand. He jabbed at the music note again and collapsed in relief when the music stopped.</p><p>He stared at the floor in shock until a pair of small feet came into view. Blinking to clear his head, he looked up to see Kreacher’s look of annoyance morph into one of confusion. The elf said something, but Harry had no idea what because a ringing noise had replaced the music.</p><p>“Kreacher,” Harry said, trying to be heard over the ringing, “I can’t hear you.”</p><p>Wincing, Kreacher put his finger to his lips in a shushing motion and then repeated whatever he’d said.</p><p>Harry could now make out a murmur as his hearing began to return but still couldn’t understand. He shrugged at the house elf in apology. “Can it wait?” he asked in what he hoped was a modulated tone.</p><p>It was Kreacher’s turn to shrug. He pointed toward the front door and mimed a knocking motion.</p><p>Ah, someone was at the door. Harry had forbidden Kreacher from answering himself because of an incident involving a singing telegram, a bubble charm, and a witch wearing only a few strategically placed tassels. Harry was still suspicious that had been George’s doing.</p><p>Thinking of George, Harry took a moment to jot down some quick notes for him while he waited for his hearing to become more reliable.</p><p>
  <i>Ear BUDS, not bugs! Sound is way too loud. Volume control NEEDED. I think my brain is bleeding.</i>
</p><p>As the ringing faded, Harry dropped his quill and headed for the door. Who would be knocking? Grimmauld Place was even more heavily warded now because of the tassel woman, and his friends would have just Floo’ed or walked right in.</p><p>Harry looked out the peep hole and saw nothing. A prank? If George was fucking with him again…</p><p>Cautiously, Harry opened the door. The sight that greeted him froze him in place. On his door step, disheveled and slumped around a body was Narcissa Malfoy. Her eyes rose to meet his and Harry stared back in stupefaction.</p><p>“Mr. Potter,” she said brokenly, “you must help me.”</p><p>Harry blinked. “I –” Harry blinked again. “Is that blood? I’ll call the Aurors,” he said as he took in the smears on her face and hands.</p><p>“No!” she said quickly. “I can’t be sure- They could-” Visibly, she calmed herself and said, “please, Mr. Potter, can you let us in? My son is hurt.”</p><p>Again, Harry blinked. Her son? Malfoy? Draco Malfoy? The body she held couldn’t be him. It was too small, too… broken. The limbs looked twisted and misshapen, the fabric covering the limp form too ragged and torn.</p><p>“I – yeah. Let me just –” Finally able to move, Harry bent down and gathered the body in his arms. The limbs flopped uncooperatively, and the head lolled to the side. A weak moan came from under the hood and Harry almost dropped the body in surprise. He’d been thinking of it as ‘the body,’ not believing it was alive. With effort and a grunt, Harry stood up with his awkward burden. “Follow me.”</p><p>Harry’s arms and legs protested the entire way to his sitting room. Sighing in relief, Harry put the twisted person on the sofa and asked, “how on Earth did you carry him to my house?”</p><p>“Levitation charm, Mr. Potter,” she said with an arched eyebrow. Clearly, her composure was returning.</p><p>“Okay,” Harry replied slowly, “better question – <i>Why</i> did you carry him to my house? St. Mungo’s–”</p><p>“No,” she said again quickly. “I can’t risk taking him there.”</p><p>“Why not? He looks half dead and could bleed out!” Harry’s brain was staring to catch up with the fact that there was a <i>bleeding person</i> in his house that definitely needed medical attention and a known Voldemort supporter had brought that person here.</p><p>Squaring his shoulders and looking Narcissa in the eye, he asked, “what’s going on? How did you even know where I live?”</p><p>Narcissa looked down. “Please, let me check on him and then I’ll explain what I can.”</p><p>Harry nodded his assent and she knelt by the sofa. She pulled back the cloak and hood covering the person that Harry had avoided looking at too closely. He gasped. It <i>was</i> Draco Malfoy. It was Draco Malfoy as Harry had only seen him once before – sickly pale, unconscious, and covered in his own blood. Harry remembered rushing water, echoing voices, and a gut-wrenching feeling of profound remorse.</p><p>“Kreacher!” Harry called.</p><p>With a pop, Kreacher appeared. The elf looked over at their guests with his customary, badly faked smile and then froze. With a wail, Kreacher launched himself at the Malfoys’ side. “Mistress Narcissa! Kreacher is getting hot water and cloths! I is getting potions and bandages for young Master Draco! Leave it to Kreacher!” He was gone with another pop.</p><p>“Figures,” Harry muttered to himself. To Narcissa he said, “is there anything else you need? A Healer…?”</p><p>“He will be fine. I’ve already mended the worst of it. Kreacher will do everything that is needed, and then Draco will just need to rest.” She smoothed Malfoy’s bloody hair back from his forehead. “Thank you, Mr. Potter.”</p><p>Kreacher popped back in with an armload of supplies and several hovering potion vials. “I is healing the young master and cleaning away the blood. Kreacher is knowing how to mend wounds and will stop the hurt.”</p><p>Narcissa’s tense posture relaxed a fraction. She smoothed Malfoy’s hair once more before standing. Sighing, she paused a moment before saying softly to Harry, “I don’t know who did this.”</p><p>“Why not go to the Aurors?”</p><p>“Why go to them at all? They have no sympathy for my family and some of them might have been among those who did this.” Narcissa shook her head. “No. At best, they would forget about Draco in a shuffle of paperwork. At worst… Well, I would rather they not have access to him.”</p><p>Harry frowned. “The Aurors help people. It’s their job. They wouldn’t hurt someone who didn’t deserve it.”</p><p>A smile that wasn’t happy grew on Narcissa’s face. “Pretty to think so. But who decides <i>who</i> deserves <i>what?</i>”</p><p>“Okay, fine. But you still should have gone to St. Mungo’s. What if he doesn’t wake up?”</p><p>Pain flashed over her face. “I don’t believe the injuries are that bad. No internal trauma. No spell damage. I healed the injuries that were still bleeding freely. He will be fine.” That last seemed to be said mostly to herself.</p><p>Harry decided to change directions. “How did you find me? My house is Unplottable.”</p><p>“The new wards are impressive, but I spent much of my childhood with my Aunt Berga. Remember, this was the House of Black before it was ever your home,” her tone was disdainful, and Harry felt like a bit of an idiot. Of course she’d been here before. She continued, “I came here because you are the only person I can be sure of.”</p><p>A series of memories involving all the times he and Malfoy had insulted, punched, or hexed each other flashed through Harry’s mind and he found himself at a loss as to where to begin contradicting her.</p><p>Narcissa ignored his incredulous expression. “He was attacked on Malfoy Manor’s grounds.” She paused significantly and gave Harry direct eye contact. “That means, Mr. Potter, that someone entered our estate without my knowledge.”</p><p>“How? The Manor has wards doesn’t it?”</p><p>“Yes, it does. And they are still intact. I wouldn’t even have known Draco was attacked if they hadn’t thrown a rock through one of the windows.”</p><p>Harry glanced over to the sofa where Kreacher was intently examining a cut along Malfoy’s temple. “So, you brought him here to have him patched up?”</p><p>“Partly.” She lifted her chin and stated firmly, “he must stay here until he heals.”</p><p>Harry’s mouth dropped open. “What?! No way! You said he’ll be fine!”</p><p>“He will be. Here, he'll heal faster and be protected. He'll be safe if he stays here.” She turned to look at her son. "His surname might be Malfoy, but he has just as much Black blood running through his veins. Legally, this is your home, but the house recognizes one of it's own."</p><p>Harry was still pondering the implications of his house liking someone else better when Narcissa continued, “I will find who did this, I swear it, but I need him to be safe until I do.”</p><p>“Safe? Here with me? You realize we’ve tried to kill each other?” Harry was growing a bit frantic at the idea of Malfoy as his house guest for an undisclosed amount of time.</p><p>“You have also saved each other. You pulled him out of that fire. And you can be sure that he knew exactly who you were when the Snatchers brought you to the Manor. Also, never forget, <i>I</i> once saved you as well. Keep Draco safe and our Life Debt is cancelled.”</p><p>“You lied to Voldemort to save him,” Harry was practically buzzing with irritation. “It wasn’t for my sake.”</p><p>“That should tell you something, Mr. Potter. The Dark Lord was on the brink of victory. Hogwarts was about to fall. Our side would have won. And I lied. To save my son. There is nothing I would not do for him.” The fierce look on her face made her seem suddenly larger. “Magic doesn’t care why I saved you. It cares that I did. You owe me. Do this, and we are even.” </p><p>Her words had a physical, heavy feeling. The air felt thicker and Harry had the feeling <i>something</i> was suddenly watching and listening in.</p><p>He looked again at Malfoy and warred with himself. Malfoy probably wouldn’t die once Kreacher was done, even without the house's help. But Narcissa thought he might be hurt again if he left. Seeing the git every day for several days sounded horrible. He was a nasty brat who had tried to make Harry’s life at Hogwarts miserable. The whole Death Eater thing also held a large amount of weight. One of Harry’s goals in life up until now was to stay the fuck away from Malfoy and his shitty, bigoted decisions.</p><p>Harry was still mentally going over why this was such a bad idea when he heard himself say, “fine. Three days.”</p><p>The heaviness in the air left and Harry felt a small jolt of…<i> something.</i></p><p>Narcissa nodded to herself and heaved a sigh of relief. “Thank you, Mr. Potter. I must go. Kreacher will care for Draco. He will be fine, and I will find who hurt him.”</p><p>“And report them to the Aurors,” Harry said forcefully.</p><p>“And report <i>what is left of them</i> to the Aurors,” she snarled viciously as she headed for the door. “I will see you in three days.” The door closed behind her.</p><p>Harry put his hands over his face and slid down the wall. He stayed there until Kreacher found him.</p><p>“Master Harry,” Kreacher interrupted, “the young Master Draco is healed. He should wake soon. I is needing some cloth –”</p><p>“Hello? Where am I?” A hesitant and slightly panicked voice came from the sitting room.</p><p>Harry groaned and forced himself up. Plastering on what he hoped was a comforting smile, he headed for the sitting room. “Hello, Malfoy,” he greeted.</p><p>Malfoy’s eyes widened comically. “You! What are you doing here? Where am I?” He made to stand but stopped and looked down at his blanket covered lap. His eyes narrowed to slits. “Why am I naked?” he asked suspiciously.</p><p>Harry backpedaled and waved his hands in the air to dispel the image that last question provided. “You’re at Grimmauld Place. My house. I live here,” he said in a rush, “and, uh, I think my house elf took your clothes off.”</p><p>A truly scandalized and horrified expression filled Malfoy’s face.</p><p>“To clean you! There was blood!” This was not making Malfoy look any less outraged. “Wait, no! Not like that!” Taking a deep breath, Harry open his mouth to try again but couldn’t think of a way to explain that neither he nor his house elf were into blood play with comatose wizards.</p><p>Squinting harder, Malfoy then asked darkly, “what the fuck is in your ears?”</p><p>Harry clapped his hands to his ears. He’d completely forgotten about the damn Ear-Bugs.</p><p>*</p><p>Harry told Malfoy he needed to make a call, told Kreacher to find the prat some clothes, and escaped to the kitchen. He stood for a moment, pinching the bridge of his nose.</p><p>He had a wonderful life. A Malfoy-free life. He tested products for George, went out with his mates on the weekends, and generally, lived a nice, quiet life. Now, he was saddled with the git and was probably going to be an accessory to murder if the look Narcissa had worn as she left was any gauge.</p><p>With a final, frustrated rub of his eyes, Harry grabbed some Floo powder. “The Wheezing Wizard!” he yelled as he stuck his head into the fireplace.</p><p>A nicely decorated and extremely cluttered room came into view. George stood up from a desk in the corner and smiled as he came over to his side of the fire. “How are the Ear-Bugs? Did they sync with the Brick? Was it too… tinny? To bass-y?”</p><p>“Too fucking loud. How do I get the damn things out?”</p><p>George tilted his head to the side. “The Bugs are designed to default to the volume of your mind. Maybe the feedback of…? No. The input can’t exceed… Huh, maybe it could.  I’m going to need to measure -” He got up and started to head back to his desk.</p><p>“George,” Harry interrupted loudly, “How. Do. I. Get. Them. Out?”</p><p>“Oh,” he turned back with a surprised expression and continued, “you tap them both at the same time. I thought that would be the most obvious way. User friendly and all.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Harry said sarcastically. “I gotta go.”</p><p>“Wait, I wanted to ask about the fellyfones with the lines. Do owls travel through the strings? Is that what they’re for? How does that work if there are no strings?”</p><p>“Wha – look, I have to go.”</p><p>“But what about –”</p><p>“Goodbye, George.” Harry pulled his head out of the fire and tapped the Bugs. They fell out. He looked down at the spider-like devices with a grimace. He tossed them onto the kitchen table and sat down heavily. “User friendly, my arse,” he grumbled while staring at the Bugs hatefully.</p><p>Kreacher entered the kitchen, humming happily. “Master Draco is much improved. He is needing to rest, and I is making him some good, strong tea.” The elf continued to hum as he gathered items for tea. Obviously, Malfoy rated higher than Harry’s usual guests because Kreacher was setting up a formal tea tray with fancy cups that Harry didn’t even know he had.</p><p>The humming broke off as Kreacher looked at Harry sharply. Slowly, he reached deeply into a cupboard and pulled out a new container of tea that looked rather ordinate. “Master Draco is needing <i>good</i> tea.” His tone indicated that Harry usually drank swill.</p><p>After a few more moments of puttering around the kitchen, Kreacher addressed Harry again in a softer voice, “I is thinking that Master Harry is also needing good tea.” He placed a cup in front of Harry with a kind expression. “You is looking very upset about Master Draco’s hurting.” He patted Harry on the shoulder and then followed the levitating tea tray out of the room.</p><p>Harry stared after the elf for a long moment. He was not upset. He shook his head and took a sip of tea. Not yet ready to face Malfoy again, he drank very slowly.</p><p>When his fireplace roared with green flames, he wasn’t sure if he was glad or annoyed.</p><p>Ginny stepped out, absentmindedly brushing soot off her dress. “Hi, Harry. Everything alright?” She came to stand next to him and touched his hair.</p><p>“I – yeah. Just, right now isn’t a good –”</p><p>“Oh, I know. George told me. He said you seemed upset.” She continued to play with his hair and leaned in closer, her breasts pressed against his shoulder. Any other day, Harry might have welcomed the soft pressure. But with the disaster sitting just down the hall, Harry probably wouldn't have been moved by a provocative striptease.</p><p>“I am <i>not</i> upset.”</p><p>With a laugh, she said, “well, what George actually said was that bugs couldn’t be the only things stuck in you. I don’t know why you’d have bugs in you, but he made it pretty clear that something large was up your arse. I thought I’d come over to help you relax.” Her eyes smoldered.</p><p>“Gin, really, maybe another –” Ginny stopped him with her mouth pressed against his. A loud bang made her jump back.</p><p>“Ah, Miss is here. Again.” Kreacher reentered the kitchen with a scowl, pretending he hadn't been the one to slam the nearest cupboard.</p><p>Ginny scowled back. “Hi, Kreacher. Can you set up tea in the sitting room? Harry and I will be there in a minute, after I’m done saying hello.”</p><p>“Tea is already being in the sitting room. It is being <i>good</i> tea.” It was obvious he thought good tea would be wasted on her.</p><p>“Oh, well,” she said in surprise. “I’ll go pour us some. Harry, can you grab biscuits?” she said over her shoulder and, without waiting for a reply, she left the room.</p><p>Mouth open to say – something, Harry went very still and waited for the inevitable outcry. He didn’t wait long.</p><p>“Harry!”</p><p>Rushing to the source of the commotion, he found Ginny with her wand trained on Malfoy, who was frozen with a tea cup halfway to his mouth.</p><p>“It’s Malfoy! He’s drinking our tea!” She glared at him and his tea drinking ways with venom.</p><p>“That is not being your tea,” Kreacher added helpfully from behind Harry.</p><p>“Gin, I was trying to tell you –”</p><p>“Harry,” she enunciated carefully, “Draco Malfoy is in your house. Drinking tea. While wearing your pajamas.” Her words rapidly picked up pace. “Harry, how could you! Of all the wizards to – It’s Malfoy, for Merlin’s sake!”</p><p>“Put your wand down, he’s not a threat.”</p><p>“Not a threat?!” she shrieked. “What is he doing here? Malfoy, I swear, if you think – “</p><p>Malfoy stood up and Harry saw that he was, in fact, wearing Harry’s favorite pajamas. Harry didn’t think Ginny noticed the slight sway as he stood, but Harry did.</p><p>Malfoy curled his lip and drawled, “Weasley, how nice to see you. I’m sure this wasn’t what you were expecting, but –” He cut off with a barely stifled grunt as Ginny zapped him with a Stinging Hex.</p><p>“Ginny!” Harry grabbed her arm and dragged her away. “Can I see you in the kitchen?”</p><p>She jerked her arm away with a glare and marched out of the room without looking back.</p><p>Exasperated, Harry glanced over at Malfoy. “Look, just – Just sit there and drink tea. I’ll be back.”</p><p>“I <i>was</i> just sitting here drinking tea. Potter, why the fuck am I sitting here drinking tea? <i>How did I get here? </i>”</p><p>“Argh! Give me a minute!” Harry stomped after Ginny.</p><p>He found her staring at the fireplace with a rigid posture. Hearing him enter, she turned around with glassy eyes. “That evil, scheming – Harry, he’s a Death Eater!”</p><p>“I know! I’m not exactly happy about it either!”</p><p>“Then why is he here?” A thought seemed to occur to her. “<i>Did he do something to you? </i> I’ll kill him.” She snarled and turned back to the kitchen entrance.</p><p>“What? No!” Harry pushed his hair back. “Look, I wasn’t expecting him to stay either, but I guess I owe him something.”</p><p>Her eyes widened incredulously. She breathed out harshly and looked Harry in the eyes. “Whatever happened, you don't owe him a single thing. You saved the world. You don’t owe <i>anyone</i> anything. Tell him to leave,” she demanded.</p><p>“I promised. You should have seen – He was –” Harry trailed off remembering the blood and Narcissa’s pained expression.</p><p>“I don't want to know. I don’t care." Ginny shook her head rapidly. "You can’t trust him.”</p><p>“I’m not trusting him. I’m…” Babysitting? Is that what he was doing? Harry’s mind hysterically supplied him with an image of gently tucking Malfoy into a crib and then choking him with a bottle.</p><p>Ginny had pity in her eyes as she said, “you’re always trying to be there for everyone. You can’t save him, Harry. He doesn’t deserve to be saved.” She softly placed her hand on his cheek. “He’ll use you if he can, you know that.” She brought her mouth to his and whispered, “let me save you this time. I’ll make him leave.”</p><p>Moving away abruptly, Harry said, “I don’t need saving. It’s fine. Just – please, don’t mention it to anyone.” Narcissa didn’t know who had attacked Malfoy and seemed to have a wide range of suspects.</p><p>Anger flashed across her face. “Fine. But I <i>am</i> telling Hermione. Maybe you’ll listen to <i>her. </i>” With that, she took a pinch of Floo powder and disappeared.</p><p>Malfoy appeared in the doorway. “Lovers’ spat?”</p><p>“I told you to stay and drink tea!”</p><p>Mouth tightening, Malfoy said, “I want answers. I waited like a good little boy and now you’re going to tell me why the fuck I’m here.”</p><p>“Kiss your mother with that mouth?”</p><p>“At least I have a mother.”</p><p>Harry threw his hands up. “Oh my God, Malfoy. Shut the fuck up and go drink more tea. If you fall down, I’m not helping you up.”</p><p>“I don’t need your help.” His sneer lost some of its effect as he swayed and grabbed onto the doorframe.</p><p>“Whatever. I’m going to have some tea. Follow me or don’t.” Harry passed him briskly.  He went to the sitting room and sat down. Not on the sofa. That would probably need to be burned after suffering Malfoy’s bare arse.</p><p>He was taking deep calming breaths and inhaling the scent of a freshly made cuppa when Malfoy rejoined him. Malfoy sat back down on the sofa and picked up his abandoned tea cup. He stared at Harry silently.</p><p>“Right, so,” Harry began with a sigh, “what do you remember?”</p><p>“I remember waking up naked in a strange house,” <i> ‘you moron’</i> was left unsaid. “Before that, I was in the gardens at the Manor.”</p><p>“That’s it? You don’t remember anything else?” Harry asked skeptically.</p><p>“No. Now can you tell me <i>why the fuck I’m here? </i>”</p><p>Harry sighed and rubbed his temple. “You were badly injured. Your mum brought you here to heal.”</p><p>Malfoy sneered. “My mum would not have – Wait, I was injured?” His eyes widened. “She evoked the Debt, didn’t she?”</p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>“Merlin’s balls.” Malfoy rubbed a hand across his face. “I was attacked? How? The wards –?”</p><p>“She didn’t know. But I told her you could stay here while she figured it out.”</p><p>“Like Hell,” Malfoy stood swiftly and promptly sat back down, holding his head. “I can’t let her – I won’t just sit here!” He tried to stand again and landed on the floor. “Why do I feel so weak?”</p><p>Wincing in sympathy, Harry answered, “you were in rough shape. Kreacher healed you, but the left-over effects will probably take a while to go away. Your mum said you needed to rest.”</p><p>Kreacher gently took Malfoy’s cup and re-filled it. “Master Harry is being right. I is removing the head swelling and mending the bones and cuts, but your body is remembering the hurt.”</p><p>A thought occurred to Harry. “Kreacher, how did you know how to heal him? Bumps and bruises are one thing, but you’re telling me you healed a concussion and broken bones?”</p><p>Kreacher wrinkled his nose and scowled. “I is learning.” </p><p>“How?”</p><p>“Kreacher is knowing how to <i>read. </i>” The condescension in his voice was thick.</p><p>“Okay, why?”</p><p>Looking extremely uncomfortable, he spat, “Dobby is making Kreacher promise.”</p><p>Harry’s heart gave a lurch. “Dobby wanted you to learn healing?”</p><p>“Dobby is wanting Kreacher to care for Master Harry. Since Kreacher is meeting you, you is being very good at getting hurt until you is finished with Auror training. I is never needing to fix your bones, but I is knowing how.”</p><p>Harry’s throat felt tight. “Why didn’t you tell me?”</p><p>“You is not asking. Kreacher promised to care for Master Harry, not tell him about it,” he said sourly.</p><p>Malfoy pulled himself off the floor. “You’re an Auror?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“But if you finished Auror training…?”</p><p>“I’m not an Auror.” Harry hoped Malfoy would take the hint and leave the subject alone.</p><p>Malfoy, of course, had a thick head and a big fat gob so obviously the complete prat asked, “why not?”</p><p>“It’s none of your damn business,” he snapped. Harry took a calming breath and forced himself to say, “I didn’t actually complete the training, so I’m not an Auror.”</p><p>“Oh.” Malfoy looked like he was trying to visually dissect a rather weird species of insect.</p><p>Harry exhaled heavily. “Look, I’ve told you all I can. You got beat up, your mum brought you here, and she’ll be back in three days to collect you.”</p><p>“And what? I just sit here until then? Absolutely not. As if I need <i>you</i> to watch over me.” Sneering, Malfoy rose more slowly this time, barely wavering at all. “I’m leaving. Give me my clothes.” </p><p>Kreacher began twisting his ears brutally. “They is being torn and soiled so badly, Kreacher is not being able to mend them. I is throwing them away.”</p><p>Jaw flexing and mouth pinching so tightly his lips turned white, Malfoy arched a sleek eyebrow and turned away from them without a word. His first few steps were cautious and then gained surety as he continued.</p><p>Harry was willing to let him go and sarcastically made a grand sweeping gesture toward the door. This was not how he’d wanted to spend his Wednesday afternoon. If the arsehole could make it out the door, surely, he’d be fine without Harry’s help. Malfoy and his stupid pride could fuck right off.</p><p>It wasn’t until Malfoy reached the front hall that Harry started to feel uncomfortable. His chest suddenly felt tight and his stomach clenched. Nausea roiled through him and dizziness turned his vision grey, leaving nothing but the remembered sight of Malfoy unconscious and bleeding.</p><p>“Malfoy, stop!” Harry stumbled after him, each step alleviating his distress a little more. “The Debt. You can’t leave.”</p><p>“Watch me,” Malfoy spat.</p><p>“Stay,” Harry panted. “I promised your mum I’d keep you safe. Three days, that’s it.”</p><p>Malfoy tilted his head to scrutinize Harry. With a cruel twist of his mouth, he said, “no,” and reached for the doorknob.</p><p>Harry reached out and grabbed his hand. “Please,” he said softly, “stay. Your mum thinks they might come for you again. Just stay with me until we know who it was.”</p><p>Malfoy’s eyes snapped from Harry’s hand to his face. His expression shifted to something Harry didn’t have a name for but looked a bit like he was either going to punch Harry or vomit. “Fine,” he eventually ground out.</p><p>Harry recoiled from Malfoy as he felt that same jolt of… <i>something</i>… he’d felt after agreeing to Narcissa’s terms. Malfoy must have felt the same jolt because Harry saw the same look of open-mouthed shock he knew must be on his own face.</p><p>Malfoy recovered first, saying, “congratulations, Potter, you are now fulfilling two Debts for the price of one,” his voice became acidic, “because, <i>of course,</i> the Great Harry Potter can’t even fill Life Debts like a fucking <i>normal</i> person.”</p><p>Blinking, Harry waved his hand toward the back of the house and said mechanically, “library is down the hall. Kitchen is that way. Bathroom is up the stairs, first door on your left. Kreacher will make up the guest bed next to it. Dinner is usually around seven. I’m going to my study.”</p><p>As he left the hallway, he heard Malfoy mutter snidely, “such a gracious host.”</p><p>Harry came out of his daze enough to loudly address Kreacher, irritation heavily lacing his words, “burn the sitting room sofa when you get a chance.”</p>
