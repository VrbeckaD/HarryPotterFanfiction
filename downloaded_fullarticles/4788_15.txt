    <p>“Can I help you?”</p><p>Daphne Greengrass stared at the petite brunette, who had just plopped down on the couch next to her moments ago.</p><p>“Okay, here’s the plan,” the girl stated without preamble. “All of the older students are saying that the House Elves in the kitchens will give you whatever snack you want, if you ask nicely. I’ve always wanted to try eggnog, but my parents have never let me.”</p><p>“Okay…” Daphne said, unsure of where this all was leading.</p><p>“Seeing how it’s the first day of the winter holidays, I want to try it. The problem is that I don’t know where the kitchens are. The older students said that, as a first year, I have to find it myself.” At this proclamation, the girl rolled her eyes. “But I thought I’d ask someone else before aimlessly wandering around a magical castle alone …at night.”</p><p>“But, I’m also a first year,” Daphne pointed out.</p><p>“Yeah,” the girl’s eyes glimmered with mischief, “but that doesn’t mean you don’t know where the kitchens are. Can you show me?”</p><p>Daphne smirked. Quickly tying her blonde hair back into a loose braid, she took a moment to form her response.</p><p>“Okay, but you owe me,” she said.</p><p>“Yeah?” The girl raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Yeah,” Daphne smiled. “And I’m calling it in now.”</p><p>Daphne watched as the girl’s eyes darkened in suspicion.</p><p>“What do you want?” the smaller girl asked slowly.</p><p>“Your name,” Daphne responded smoothly. “I would like to be friends.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence before the brunette grinned and extended her hand.</p><p>“I’m Tracey,” she said. “Tracey Davis. And I would love to be your friend.”</p><p>“It’s nice to meet you, Tracey Davis. I’m Daphne Greengrass. Now let’s see if we can get some eggnog.”</p>
