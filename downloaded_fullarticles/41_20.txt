    <p>The smell of smoke stung Hermione’s nostrils as she laboured to breathe. She had mostly dodged a string of hexes over the last hour, but from the few she had collided with, she thought a rib or two might be broken. She was bleeding from numerous cuts and slices and had developed a limp. Wand clutched tightly in her hand, Hermione surged forward trying to locate her two best friends from whom she had been separated from earlier. Overhead, the sky hung dark and ominous and she feared the coming rain would hinder her progress towards the centre of the battle. </p><p>The months on the run with Harry and Ron, with supplies dwindling and rough living, her clothes were worn and tattered while her body was thin, bordering on emancipated.

Hermione struggled through several smaller skirmishes, casting spells and hexes at Death Eaters and their allies. Nightmare creatures surged, withered and pulsed with evil intent, determined to make the most of the chaos surrounding them. A tentacle here, a twitching limb there, vast maws with glistening fangs teeming with venom arced towards her. Summoning as much power as she could, Hermione blasted free a path to the ancient tree. Believing she was following Harry, and presumably Ron, Hermione plunged into the tunnel leading to the Shrieking Shack.</p>
