    <p>It was at that precise moment that Remus John Lupin decided that he hated his parents. How could they do this to him? He had not thought they were capable of such evil. The fateful doctor's appointment had been over a month ago, and they had not spoken of it since. Lulled into a false sense of security, he had thought that it would not change anything, that this <em>anomaly</em> would just be smoothed over and forgotten about. He laughed at his own naivety. His stupidity. From the front of the battered car, his mother, no, <em>Hope</em> gave him a concerned, watery smile. He turned his head away.</p><p>“Remus stop sulking. It's not an attractive look for you and you need to be looking your best for Walburga and Orion.” Lyall scowled from the driver's seat. “We - your mother and I, we need the money. We need to pay off the car, and we’re three months behind on the rent for the cottage.”</p><p>“And the only solution you could find was to sell off your child!?” Remus exclaimed; temper stirred.</p><p>“The only <em>long term</em> solution yes. And we’re not “selling you off” Remus, we’ll visit you all the time, and you can come stay with us as well, perhaps with your new husband and children.” Lyall replied, looking over his shoulder. Remus scoffed.</p><p>“Please, every single “prospective partner” we’ve gone to visit has made it clear that their only intention should they be “permitted” to wed me is to fuck me over and over again until I'm round with their <em>spawn</em>”</p><p>“Remus please! You'll upset your mother.”</p><p>"That woman is NOT my mother.” He spat in retort and felt no ounce of sympathy at the strangled sob Hope released at his outburst, in fact would have said more had they not pulled up outside the Black family manor. Getting out onto the gravel spread drive, he felt slightly out of place in his jeans and almost regretted refusing to wear the robes bought for the occasion. Almost. They were far too revealing for his taste, and, in his opinion focused too much on the stomach. Then again, as one of only 12 unmated male carriers, what did he expect? As soon as they had received that report from the doctor, he lost his place as a human, he lost his right to be <em>someone</em>, only <em>someone’s.</em></p><p> Two people hurried down the imposing white marble steps with the grace only possessed by those born into unimaginable fortune. Their robes swirled around them and Remus detected the slightest flicker of disdain at his battered appearance in the woman’s eye, gone before it was ever truly there.</p><p>“You must be Remus!” She exclaimed, snaking her porcelain white arm around him. “Welcome to our home. Sirius and the others are waiting for you in the foyer.” She propelled him forward and turned to his parents, “Mr and Mrs Lupin, please follow me to the office where we will discuss the terms of the transaction, should you choose to award us the pleasure of uniting our two families. And, of course, the <em>compensation</em>.” They followed the stately couple around the manor with a backwards glance to remind him to behave. He briefly considered just running away. He could drive, albeit not spectacularly well, but good enough to escape this, what had the woman called it? This transaction.</p><p>Two servants stepped forward and frog marched him up the steps and into a grand foyer. How could he have forgotten? He was an important commodity, an object to be guarded at all costs. Merlin, he needed a drink – never mind that he was underage, that hadn’t seemed to bother anyone as he was sold to pay off his family’s expenses.</p><p>“Ah, Remus is it?” A dark-haired beauty stepped forward and shook his hand, after extracting it from the iron grip of the determined servant on his right. He dismissed them both with an imperious gesture and linked arms with Remus, dragging him over to a soft leather couch and pulling him down with him. Whatever he had been expecting from the “Noble and ancient house of Black”, this was not it.</p><p>“Sirius is fussing over his hair again. He said to pass on his apologies for his inevitably late arrival.” A red head sank onto the couch on the other side of Remus and let out a sigh.</p><p>“Ah this corset is killing me.” She groaned, squirming like a contortionist.</p><p>“Tell me about it.” Smirked Regulus, rubbing his stomach. “The only upside of being pregnant is that I don’t have to wear one.” The scarlet haired girl swatted him in the face and closed her eyes.</p><p>“The only upside? And here I was thinking my beautiful husband wanted to carry my child.” A husky voiced male unseated the younger male and pulled him into his lap, where they engaged in some gut churning PDA. Remus turned to the girl beside him.</p><p>“I’m Lily.” She told him, before throwing a pillow at the snogging couple and shouting at them to “keep it in their pants”, a request they promptly ignored. “The guy trying to deflower Reggie is Sev and my husband James is upstairs trying to calm your possible future fiancé - I don’t envy you that, let me tell you something. Sirius Orion Black is the biggest drama queen this side of High School Musical.” Remus chuckled but stopped abruptly when he spotted two figures approaching the couch they were sitting on.</p><p>“Stop trying to get him to hate me foxglove, it won’t work.” The man spread his arms out in comical imitation of the preacher in the town church. “I’m just <em>too</em> charming.” A self-satisfied smirk twinkled in his grey eyes and he looked as if he was waiting for something.</p><p>“What, you want me to applaud your egotistical ass?” Asked Remus sweetly, enjoying the sputter of confusion in his face. Lily – or foxglove as the man had called her – laughed, freely and without restraint, something Remus had not been able to do for a long, long time. He found himself laughing along, starting with a small chuckle, and then suddenly he was <em>howling</em>. All the emotion coming out in one fell swoop. He was crying, from what emotion he had no idea, but he just could not stop.</p><p>Without warning, a door opened and the adults stepped through. Remus turned away, and wiped at his face frantically, collecting himself before rising and holding his head high and joining on step with his parents as they headed to the door. His pride was only slightly marred by his father hitting him sharply in the head as they started out of the door.</p><hr/><p>A few hours later</p><p>(just so we’re clear, this is a ball where they will announce Remus’ new fiancé.)</p><hr/><p>“My wife and I have given a lot of thought to this process, after all Remus is our only child, and I am delighted to inform you that we have reached a decision. The man we have deemed fit to marry our son is... Sirius Black”</p><p>Sitting on a throne like chair, Remus readjusted his robes and drained his wine.</p><p>“Well Fuck.”</p>
