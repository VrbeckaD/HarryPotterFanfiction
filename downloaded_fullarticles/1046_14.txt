  <em> “Mr. Potter has no choice. He is, as of tonight, A triwizard champion.”  </em>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Harry struggled to keep his feet moving as he made his way back to Gryffindor Tower. He felt numb, not even fear tickled at the back of his mind. He was completely numb. Empty.</p><p>“Alright Potter?” </p><p>Harry turned to his left to see Draco and Blaise Zabini leaning against the stone wall outside of the Great Hall. Draco’s expression was mildly curious, while Blaise simply crossed his arms over his chest. </p><p>“Fine,” was all Harry could get out before he continued his walk to the tower. He didn’t even have the heart to question why Draco Malfoy of all people was suddenly showing an interest in his well being. </p><p>It took nearly three times longer than usual, but eventually he stepped through the threshold of his dorm room. He ignored the looks Ron sent him as he changed clothing and climbed into his bed. He was asleep before his head hit the pillow. </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>The next morning Harry sat as far away from the rest of Gryffindor House as he possibly could. He couldn’t stand the constant whispering and glares they sent him when they thought he wasn’t paying attention. </p><p>He picked at his food, unable to eat more than half of what was on his plate. Eventually he gave up on eating and cradled a warm cup of coffee in his hands. He savored the warmth as it ran down his throat and settled in his stomach. </p><p>He let out a sigh after a long while and decided he didn’t care anymore. Why was this any different than second year? They hated him then and they hated him now. Things would never change. They only liked him when he was earning house points or catching the golden snitch during the Gryffindor quidditch matches. </p><p>Harry didn’t need them. He certainly wasn’t going to waste time on people who turned their backs on him at nearly every opportunity. He would figure it out on his own, he decided. He would study and do everything within his power to complete the tasks. He didn’t have time for the drama, not when his life was at risk. </p><p>Harry took another sip of his coffee, but nearly dropped the cup when a raven almost landed on his half empty plate. The rather intelligent looking bird stole a piece of bacon before spreading its wings and flying from the Great Hall. </p><p>He watched it go before noticing the package it had left behind. It was thin and rectangular with a slight lump on one side. Wondering if it was from Sirius, he picked it up and glanced around to make sure no one was paying attention. Everyone was purposefully ignoring him, so he cast several curse detection spells before carefully ripping open the package. </p><p>Inside were two items. The first was a raven pendant on a black chain. The raven was flying with its wings spread wide, an it had crimson eyes and black metal feathers that glinted in the light.  </p><p>He put it aside to look over the second item, a red leather journal with black fastenings. He opened the cover to see six words written on the first page,</p><p>
  <em> ‘Wear the pendant. Don’t trust Dumbledore.’ </em>
</p><p>Harry froze in shock as he stared at the page. After a moment, he flipped through the rest of the journal, but there was nothing else. He half expected the words to fade, but they were still there when he turned back to the first page,</p><p>‘<em>Wear the pendant. Don’t trust Dumbledore.’  </em></p><p>He thought the handwriting was familiar, but he couldn’t place it. He thought of Tom Riddle’s diary, and looked over the journal more closely. </p><p>It was obviously new, not old like Tom Riddle’s diary. It also didn’t have the same… <em> taste </em>, as Tom Riddle’s diary. It was different, yet it still felt familiar somehow. </p><p>
  <em> ‘Don’t trust Dumbeldore.’ </em>
</p><p>Harry certainly felt betrayed by the Headmaster. The man hadn't done a single thing to help him get out of this situation the previous night. Harry was angry with Dumbledore, but that didn’t mean he didn’t trust him. He had to believe Headmaster Dumbledore was looking for a way to break the magical contract. </p><p>Feeling slightly nervous, Harry slipped the red journal and the pendant into his backpack. He would look into it further after his classes were over. </p><p>Harry accidentally ran into Draco Malfoy as he left the hall. “Watch it Potter,” Draco hissed as he shoved him back. Draco discreetly forced a crumpled piece of paper into his hand as he pushed past him. </p><p>Harry held it tightly at his side as he watched Draco disappear with the rest of the Slytherins into the crowd of students. </p><p>He opened it as he walked to his first class of the day, unable to wait until later. Careful to make sure no one was watching him, he pulled apart the wrinkled paper. It read, <em> ‘Be careful Potter, things are not as the seem. You are being watched.'’  </em></p><p>Harry felt a wave of frustration come over him as he crumpled the note back up and shoved it into his backpack with the journal and pendant. </p><p><em> What the hell is going on? </em>He asked himself.</p><p>After classes ended, he found the most secluded section of the library and cast a notice-me-not charm to prevent people from bothering him. </p><p>He then sat down and took out the journal and Draco's note to compare the two. He set them side by side on the table and immediately noticed the difference in handwriting. Whoever wrote in the journal certainly wasn't Draco Malfoy. </p><p>He pushed the journal and the note across the table out of anger and dropped his face into his hands. He wished he had someone to ask for advice, but something was telling him to keep everything to himself. <em> Something wasn't right. </em>If two different people were warning him, it meant he was in danger. Though whether or not Draco and the mystery writer were trustworthy was up for debate. Maybe they were the ones trying to lead him into a trap. </p><p>Either way, he would take their advice and watch his own back. He wouldn't trust anyone moving forward until he had more information. </p><p>Harry brought the journal and the note closer again, hoping to find some kind of clue. He nearly gasped when he opened the journal and found seven more words written underneath the original sentence. </p><p>
  <em> 'Wear the pendant and don't take it off.' </em>
</p><p>Harry quickly grabbed a quill and ink from his backpack and wrote, <em> 'Why should I trust you?' </em>His hand shook as he waited for a response. </p><p>The mystery writer wrote back, <em> 'Protective wards and spells, Volume V, pg. 73'  </em></p><p>Harry immediately went and found the librarian. He gave her the title of the book he was looking for and watched patiently as she searched through the ledger book. He followed her for what felt like an eternity through the library before she stopped and picked a book from the shelf. </p><p>"Here you are," she said. "Make sure to put it back when you are done."</p><p>With that she returned to her desk and Harry returned to his dusty corner of the library. </p><p>He set the book down gently and flipped to page 73 as quickly as he could manage without tearing the pages. </p><p> </p><p>
  <b> <em>Protective Magical Objects </em> </b>
</p><p>
  <em> Magical objects such as necklaces, pendants, bracelets, and rings can be imbued with wards and spells to help protect the wearer from those who wish to cause them magical harm.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> A skilled witch or wizard can cast wards on an object to shield the wearer from most mild forms of harmful magic, such as compulsion spells, jinxs, hexes, and some curses…. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry once again picked up the journal and scribbled out, </p><p>
  <em> 'How do I know the pendant is going to protect me and not hurt me?'  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> 'Chapter 13.' </em>
</p><p>Harry flipped to the chapter and read the heading, </p><p> </p><p>
  <b> <em>Chapter 13: How to tell if a Magical Object is Dangerous</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>The chapter listed several magical detection spells that Harry already knew, but it also listed many more he had never heard of before. There was even a spell to diagnose which wards and spells were already on the journal. </p><p>He practiced the wand movements for several minutes before pointing his wand at the pendant and murmuring, </p><p><em> "Ipsum Revelare </em>."</p><p>He repeated the incantation two more times before touching the tip of his wand to a blank sheet of parchment. <em> "Veritatem." </em></p><p>Slowly words began to appear on the page, </p><p> </p><p>
  <b>Basic Protection Ward </b>
</p><p>
  <b>Mental Clarity Charm </b>
</p><p>
  <b>Minor Hex and Jinx Ward</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Minor Curse Ward </b>
</p><p>
  <b>Compulsion Shield Ward</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Portkey </b>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry's jaw twitched as he read the last word. The very last thing he needed was a pendant that could randomly take him away from Hogwarts. Whoever was on the other end of that journal would probably take him straight to Voldemort. </p><p>He picked up his quill and wrote in the journal, <em> 'I won't wear a Portkey.' </em></p><p>
  <em> 'It is a one way Portkey. Only you can activate it.' </em>
</p><p><em> 'And how do I do that?' </em>Harry asked. </p><p>
  <em> 'You hold the pendant in your hand and say the words "Concedam salutem", it will take you to safety if you need it.' </em>
</p><p>Harry frowned, <em> 'You mean it will take me to you?'  </em></p><p>The mystery writer didn't respond.</p><p>Sighing, Harry removed the pendant from his backpack and dropped it on the table next to the journal. He stared at it for a long while, noticing the way the raven's red eyes flickered in the light. He didn't know who sent him the pendant, but after casting several detection spells he felt confident it wouldn't hurt him. The only thing preventing him from wearing it was the portkey feature. </p><p>Harry spent the next 10 minutes considering his options before he finally slipped the black chain over his neck. He needed all the help he could get. </p>
