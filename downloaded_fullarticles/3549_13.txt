    <p>“Hermes, honestly, am I your <em>best</em> mate?” Ronald Weasley drew near with a strict look on his face, his eyes fixed on him.</p><p>“What?” Hermes went a little guilty under his gaze. He blinked and thought of anything could bring such protest from Ron. Nothing. He didn’t manifest any impatience when Lavender discussed lipsticks with him in office, nor diss the Quidditch player Ron liked recently...</p><p>“You have a girlfriend without telling us.” Ron’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>This caught Harry’s attention immediately.</p><p>“Really?” he turned around, surprised.</p><p>“I have no girlfriend.” Hermes frowned.</p><p>“Don’t deny. Lavender tells me you collect your things early every Friday afternoon, sitting waiting in your seat, checking the clock twice a minute and dash out like Firebolt as soon as it strikes five.”</p><p><em>I forget how much she loves gossip,</em> Hermes cursed inwardly.</p><p>“Why don’t you tell us?” Harry took seat besides him slowly.</p><p>“Yeah, I am curious too. What kind of girl could drag him out of his office before eight o'clock p.m. - ouch!” Hermes clapped him on the back side of his head.</p><p>“Come on. Be honest,” laughed Harry.</p><p>“Fine,” he signed. “I do have dinner with someone every Friday night...but she is not my girlfriend.We just meet once a week, having little chat.”</p><p>“We often call this, ‘date’.” Obviously Ron didn’t believe him.</p><p>“But you adore her, do you?” asked Harry.</p><p>He bit his bottom lip, nodding hesitantly. “I do hope she can accept me.”</p><p>“Wooing girls? Easy, we have lover expert at hand,” laughed Ron.</p><p>“You?” Hermes rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Not me. Lavender,” he corrected.</p><p>Hermes shook his head. “She is not ‘girl’. And she is...special.”</p><p>“Then we can turn to Luna.”</p><p>“I don’t mean that,” he shot Ron an angry stare. “And she is older than me. Much older.”</p><p>“Fair enough. She'd better be a stunning beauty - Hold on, given that is Hermes Granger that we are talking about, it will be more precise to say she is twice as clear as you are. Wait, she can’t be married, can she?”</p><p>“WHAT?” he stood up in a fury.</p><p>“Eh, you say she is much older and ‘hope she could accept you’...” Ron flinched. “Sorry, I didn’t mean that.”</p><p>“Alright. Alright.” Harry stood between them. “You need to work harder, Hermes. We are expecting you to bring her to the Burrow for dinner.”</p><p>“You may as well tell us her size,” added Ron. “Mom is knitting her Weasley sweaters this year.”</p><p>“I’ll try,” replied Hermes curtly. <em>No, you won’t like her,</em> he sighed inwardly.</p><p> </p><p>He was wooing Snape. Severus Snape.</p><p>It has been a long story. When he was at school, his Potions Master was always mean and exert every chance to bully they three whilst protected them once their life was at stake, risking her life to fulfil duties for the Order of Phoenix, regardless of others’ disgust and doubt. Thus he respected her and admired her knowledge, wisdom and courage. Yet when it came to the D.A.D.A. class in the sixth year, he found his mind wandering often - not when she was teaching, of course, he never misses a word from any professor - he just stared at her motionlessly. Her hands. Curves of her neck. Soft breast. The waist exposed when taking out her wand. Then downwards -</p><p><em>That's so stupid</em>, he scolded himself all right and over again. He didn't know why - she was plain-looking and bad-tempered, 20 years senior and she was his teacher who spared no effect in taunting him for six years. Yet he was still attracted to her, and he...couldn't let the feeling go. Though the fact frustrated him, he assumed that as he had barely the chance to meet his former professor who avoided their lot on purpose in those years, the thought that hunted him were no big problems at all.</p><p>...Until he drink the Felix Felicis that noon. His swore that it’s just to make the work less unbearable: his colleague took sick leave and left all the work to him; the proposal he brought forward was rejected; half a dozen people owled almost simultaneously to meet him that day; the water pipe bust when he got home to take documents and he couldn't repair it with magic or it would be difficult to explain it to the coming plumber in community. After all this mess, he was fed up. Since he started work, the pressure seemed easy to annoy him, just like other things. He drank the potion that was enough to keep him lucky till night in case he would be called to work in the midnight. Yet the blasted potion seemed to have another outstanding with “luck”, and put it into action zestfully. That's why he woke up in the midnight, suffering headache for imbibing too much alcohol. He turned around and catching sight of the pants abandoned on the floor as well as his shirt on the bed ,slowly recalling whits of memory about what happened last night. It nearly startled him to death.</p><p>That's fucking exciting. Now he wanted to open the window and jump out.</p><p>He must have acted like a terrible virgin! Though strictly he wasn't, but not so much better - let alone Professor Snape just left him in such a mess after the one night stand...wait, Professor Snape slept with him? Didn’t Harry say she adored Lily? Wait...</p><p>So many things he couldn't swallow flooded to him. Consequently, he spend the rest of night with no sleep until sunrise. When he woke up, it’s already afternoon. He was about to curse himself for wasting precious work time for sleep when it hit them that there was an honored Weasley Burrow dinner so he dressed in hurry and rushed to the Burrow. It was not surprising that Fred and George teased him about the dishevelled hair and pale look, the latter of which made Mrs Weasley poured him another two large spoons of meat soup in worry.</p><p> Ginny even asked him what happened - as if he could just blurted out “I slept with Professor Snape” so damn easily.</p><p>Yet after such despair, a gleam of hope haunted him. Well.. now that... they slept with each other...so possibly...she wasn't so different to him, was she? Maybe she could appear in that bar again -</p><p>So after struggling inwardly for a week, he found himself in his best Muggle attire with his hair tamed. Opening the door of the very bar,  he caught sight of the familiar dark-haired woman ,his heart missing a beat.</p><p>Weather is fortune or not, he didn't know. A hint of surprise crossed her face, which remained emotionless quickly. He summoned all his Gryffindor courage to accost her - Merlin, he even kept calling her “Professor” all the time - and eventually invited her for dinner.</p><p>Surprisingly, she said yes.</p><p>Watching her strike out of the bar, he signed in dismay. She acted as if she had not a bit of interest. Yet she said yes.</p><p>“It's been great, young man,” said the owner of the bar, throwing him a suggestive grin. “I still remember you last time. That woman is tough. Even winos who teased her are granted with broken limbs. She must like you at any rate. By the way, you adore your teacher since school?”</p><p>Hermes flushed a little.</p><p>The barman mused, staring at the door. “I keep thinking what's her occupation. Teaching? Not likely - what do you want today?”</p><p>“She was a teacher,” plus double agent. “Anything.”</p><p>Hermes lifted the drink he ordered, draining it without taking a look and choked, coughing unceasingly.</p><p>The barman laughed out aloud.</p>
