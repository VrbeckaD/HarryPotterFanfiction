    <p>It was an annoying part of being a junior auror, being landed with the jobs nobody else wanted. Like playing security detail to some fuddy duddy author from a small island way over the ocean. Percival grumbled to himself as he got ready to greet the oh so important visitor. He was better than this, someone less skilled than him could have done the job. It was almost well known that he was the best student at the auror academy, that’s why he was allowed to work at the MACUSA headquarters in New York and not in some shabby little town next to a cornfield. Not that he had anything against cornfields but he still preferred to be in the centre of action.</p>
<p>Truth be told Percival hadn’t really done much research on his ward. All he’d done was memorise the man’s schedule and name. He knew the guy had written some school textbook and he was over here to promote the second edition, try to sell it to Ilvermorny and do a couple of book signings. A boring few days as far as Percival was concerned. He made his way down to the docks, a blue handkerchief in his breast pocket as agreed with this Scamander guy.</p>
<p>The boat was already docked when Percival arrived, people were just starting to push down the ramp, eager to disembark. He watched them with mild interest, tried to figure out who was a tourist, who was a traveller, who came into the country with bad intent. There was one guy who looked around like a well travelled tourist, eyes searching for something. Percival shifted a little, blue handkerchief fully visible. The man squinted at it then approached him.</p>

</div><p>“Mr. Graves?” his voice was gentle.</p>
<p>“Mr. Scamander?” Percival replied coolly. A look of relief washed over the other man.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t sure if it was you. My liaison has a sense of humour if you’re wearing a blue pocket square. I can’t see blue. But I think I’ll forgive her for arranging such a cute guardian for my stay,” Scamander rambled and Percival bristled a little. He was many things but not cute. If the other man made a single comment about button noses or tried to bop it then he was going to find him on the wrong end of Percival’s wand. Thankfully no such thing happened.</p>
<p>“Right this way please Mr. Scamander,” Percival turned to lead them out of the port, perhaps a touch rude at not taking the luggage but Scamander was a grown man, he could manage his own.</p>
<p>“Wonderful,” came the reply, seemingly undisturbed by Percival’s lack of manners, “and a lovely young thing like you can call me Newt.”</p>
<p>“Of course Mr. Scamander, we’ll be at the hotel in three minutes,” Percival replied stubbornly. Just because the man was a celebrated author didn’t mean he could smoothly slide into Percival’s bed for a few nights.</p>
<p>The hotel was standard fare but Newt seemed unfazed by it. He delighted in the vast selection of pillows, cooed about how it was a veritable nest and announced he’d be very happy there.</p>
<p>“Would you come to dinner with me tonight?” Newt asked, his hand on Percival’s elbow as he had turned to take his leave.</p>
<p>“You have dinner scheduled at 19:00 tonight with a book distributor at one of the finest restaurants New York has to offer. I will escort you there and wait for you outside,” Percival informed him stiffly. He wasn’t expecting a hand to wave dismissively at that.</p>
<p>“Formalities, that’s all. I can skip that. They’ll have a lovely meal and we’ll have one too. You’re a feast on the eyes you know,” Newt grinned and Percival stepped away. He didn’t want to be drawn into a three day dalliance. His heart couldn’t take that. “Pick me up tonight at 18:00. You choose the venue.”</p>
<p>The door shut in Percival’s face before he could object. His own hotel room was on the other side of the corridor. At half past five he grumbled to himself but got ready. He could show Newt to a restaurant and stand ceremonial guard while the man ate. It was only for three days, he could survive that. At six o’clock sharp he rapped on Newt’s door. It opened slowly and Newt stood there with a small smile.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t sure you would come.”</p>
<p>“Can’t have you starve to death on my watch. Come on,” Percival led the way. They walked down winding roads and back alleys to a small diners. It barely fit the three tables in, most people picked up their food and ate it elsewhere. Percival pushed through the familiar doors, the place smelt as it always had, a mixture of heat and food. The place had been a staple during his auror training and even now he liked to indulge in it every now and then. They sat down and Newt beamed around him.</p>
<p>When time came to order Newt asked for his recommendations the proceeded to order two of it when Percival refused to order for himself. There was no arguing with the man, he found ways round all of Percival’s objections. The food, as always, we delicious and Newt thanked him for showing him such a gem hidden in the dust of New York.</p>
<p>The next day was a book signing day. Newt and Percival arrived in good time at the shop where Newt’s picture was plastered in the window, advertisement loudly proclaiming that today was the day the great author would be meeting and greeting his adoring fans. It made Newt frown but he shrugged it off as American exuberance before they headed into the shop.</p>
<p>Most of it was a tremendously boring affair for Percival. He watched people fawn over the man who managed to drop his food everywhere as he gestured with a loaded fork in hand. For his part Newt looked mildly uncomfortable but not once did he turn to Percival to ask for help in removing a more enthusiastic fan. At lunch time they retired to the staff room of the shop.</p>
<p>“All this signing,” Newt sighed, “but I’d much rather see my signature in chocolate sauce across your skin before I licked it off.”</p>
<p>Percival almost choked. He ignored Newt’s wistful stare and continued to furiously cram his salad in his mouth. The second half of the day was no different. Finally even the last chattering fan left and Newt groaned as he stood from his cramped table. It only occurred to Percival then that the man was taller than him.</p>
<p>“If I never have to sign a copy of my book ever again it would still be too soon.”</p>
<p>The walk back to the hotel was a quiet, amicable one. Percival thought back on the day. Not once had Newt made any lewd remark or gave an awkward chat up line to anyone other than him. It made him pause and think. He saw Newt back to his hotel room and went back out into the cool evening air of Newt York.</p>
<p>Not long after there was a knock on Newt’s hotel door. He opened it curiously to see Percival standing there with a tub of chocolate sauce.</p>
<p>“Got one more signature in you?” he asked nervously. Newt grinned and stepped aside to let him in.</p>
