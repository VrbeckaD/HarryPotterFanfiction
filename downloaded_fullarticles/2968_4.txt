    <p>Harry looked around the Great Hall with a sense of surreal wonder— only four months ago, it had been a warzone, and now...it was almost the same.<br/>Almost.<br/>The gaps where friends had sat, the soot on the stone, the whistling of wards around the windows, all reminded him that nothing was the same, not anymore.<br/>	Hermione, seeing the same things he did, gave his hand a reassuring squeeze, whilst Ron wasted no time stuffing his face. With his appreciation for food, it was no surprise that the mark on Hermione had shown up to be gingerbread. It was...sappy, but it made her happy.<br/>Thinking of the soulmarks, Harry’s smile fell some as he absently scratched at the place over his heart, where his new burden sat. <br/>Seamus and Dean joined them at the table, giving grateful smiles and launching into anything but the war.<br/>	What they <em>did</em> bring up didn’t make Harry feel better.<br/>“Seamus, what is on your neck?” Harry followed her eyes just in time to see something retreat below the neckline of the irish man’s shirt.<br/>	Seamus grinned, pulling the shirt away to reveal a paint palette and brush, which caused Dean to blush, “The soul marks came in last week.”<br/>Hermione congratulated them, but both her and Ron’s eyes strayed over to Harry, who seemed to have hunched down at the mention of marks.<br/>	“So Harry, mate, what’s yours?” Seamus asked tactlessly, earning a glare.<br/>“He doesn’t want to share.” Ron said, and more of the focus shifted towards him— at least, overtly. The majority of the table had already been staring at him, or subtly eavesdropping.<br/>	“What’s wrong with it, Harry?” Neville asked, leaning forward from Hermione’s right to see Harry.<br/>“Nothing’s wrong it-”<br/>	“Are you embarrassed? Does Harry have a crush?” Seamus teased, wagging his eyebrows playfully, and Harry’s face flamed.<br/>He was saved from having to answer by the hush that fell over the hall as Mcgonagall stepped up the podium, and the students keenly felt Dumbledore’s absence; for Harry, it was a gut punch.<br/>“Welcome back, everyone.” Mcgonagall kept her composure, but the emotion in those words computed perfectly, “The start of a new year. A new era. The castle is still standing, even after the past horrors.” Mcgonagall’s eyes found the returning students, her smile sad, “We are still standing.”<br/>	The hall broke into applause, but Harry managed to drift after that. It was mostly the pleasantries, and the sorting. His eyes strayed to the Slytherin table.<br/>Not many of the slytherins had come back. The table was...desolate. But sitting alone, seemingly ostracised from the others, was Draco Malfoy. His hair was longer than it had been at the trials, and it hung into his face. His eyes were unfocused, the grey cloudy as he started at the table. He was hunched over his plate, hands clenched in front of him. He looked...haunted.<br/>	Harry snapped out of it as the conversation ratcheted up around him, and he realised that the sorting had ended, along with Mcgonagall’s speech— he felt guilty for not listening.<br/>“So Harry, any reason <em>why</em> you don’t want to share?” Dean asked, gesturing to where Harry’s hand had strayed to his chest, scratching absently.<br/>	Harry jerked his hand away, flushing, but didn’t know how to answer.<br/>“It’s not someone who…?”<br/>	“No. No!” Harry said suddenly, realising why they had gotten quiet— it wasn’t unheard of for the soulmate to be someone who had died, and with the war, it was even likely.<br/>“So you <em>do</em> know who it is,” Ron said, and Harry sighed, scrubbing a hand over his face.<br/>“Drop it, Ron,” he said tiredly, and to his surprise the ginger did. The topic turned to Quidditch, to studies— to everything normal teens should talk about it.<br/>They spent the rest of dinner like that, but Harry’s eyes kept straying to Malfoy— the blond wasn’t eating, merely staring at his plate. He was so thin…<br/>Hermione nudged him, and he ripped his gaze away, cheeks flushed. What had they been talking about?<br/>	“What?” he said dumbly, and Ron repeated himself.<br/>“Do you think we’ll get to play Quidditch?” Ron said, glancing over his shoulder to figure out what Harry had been staring at.<br/>“I don’t see why not,” Harry acquiesced, and was sucked into the conversation, determinedly not looking at the Slytherin table.<br/>Mcgonagall stood again, presumably to send them to their respective common rooms, “Now that we have eaten our fill. It is time to retire for the night. Those of you who quality as “8th year students”, please remain seated.”<br/>	Those around him broke into curious murmurs as the younger years filed out, until it was just the returning students remaining. Mcgonagall called them up to stand with her in a group, giving them each a grateful smile.<br/>“It is so good to see you all here,” <em>alive</em> was left unspoken, but heard nonetheless. “Given the...unique, circumstances of your being here, the other professors and I thought it prudent that you should be given unique...privileges, as it were.”<br/>The murmuring paused again with the raising of her hand, “You are all of age; adults. As such, we see it fit to treat you as adults. You will be living in a separate dorm room of your own; you have grown beyond your houses, and now you shall grow together. This year, we are giving you an environment to grow past the war, to heal those older wounds. You will be rooming in pairs, rather than by gender, and your curfew will not be until midnight on weekdays….and there is no curfew on the weekend.”<br/>	Seamus crowed, earning a quiet round of laughs, but mostly the group was nervous— who would they be rooming with?<br/>	“However, if any alcohol, illegal substance, or dangerous item is found in your possession or on the grounds, you will also be <em>punished</em> as adults.” That scolding halted Seamus’ schemes.<br/>“Your new common room is located on the fifth floor, beside the painting of Sir Cadogan, and your password is ‘Unity’.” With that, she bade them goodnight.<br/>From there, it was a race to see the rooming assignment, which was posted in the common room.<br/>	Seamus was already planning parties, nights in Hogsmeade, and a litany of other debaucherous schemes.<br/>Harry was mostly just tired and queasy— who would he have to share with?<br/>	Their common room was simple enough. Not adhering to any house colour, the decorations were teal and violet, with cream and coffee brown plush sofas near the fire. There were multiple hallways breaking from the main room, presumably to their rooms. There, on the large bulletin, was the rooming list, and it was crowded immediately. With victorious cries, or cries of lament as people found their roommates.<br/>Harry didn’t want to know.<br/>	There was a sudden hush in the room, broken by a string of profanity, and the crowd backed off to reveal Malfoy, who looked hacked off; who had he gotten.<br/>That was soon answered. He turned, throwing a sneer at Harry, before stalking down one of the corridors. Harry approached the board, and saw in Mcgonagall’s writing:<br/><em>“Draco Malfoy, Harry Potter.”</em><br/>	Harry’s face flamed, and he gulped.<br/>Malfoy was his roommate.<br/>Bollocks.</p>
