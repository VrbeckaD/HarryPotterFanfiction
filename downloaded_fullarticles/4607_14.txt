</p><p>"You're kidding, right?" Iron Man asked angrily.</p><p>The Government were having a meeting with The Avengers about the Heroes and Allies Registration.</p><p>"No, Iron Man. We are not kidding," replied one of the government officials.</p><p>"Sidekicks will have to register as well," said the other.</p><p>"Whoa, whoa. Bad idea. Some of us don't have sidekicks!" Iron Man bellowed.</p><p>"Yes, you do?" The other government official said in a questioning tone.</p><p>"No I don't," Iron Man said stubbornly.</p><p>"Yes, War Machine!" The first government official stated.</p><p>"He's not a sidekick! He's a hero all on his own!" Iron Man shouted, banging a fist on the table.</p><p>Captain America, Spider-Man and The Doctor were all watching from the sidelines, but they had nothing to say in retaliation.</p><p>Iron Man then gave up.</p><p>"Okay! We'll register, as long as we don't have to have sidekicks!" Iron Man said.</p><p>"Agreed!" The government officials said in unison and them and Iron Man shook hands.</p><p>"Well, that went well," Spider-Man said to The Doctor after the meeting.</p><p>"Indeed, it did, Peter," The Doctor replied.</p><p>"Are you going to register?" Spider-Man asked.</p><p>"Well, it is the law," The Doctor answered.</p><p>"Let's hope no one refuses to register!" Spider-Man said.</p><p>
  <strong>TWO MONTHS LATER.</strong>
</p><p>"Urgh! This is taking forever!" A raccoon named Rigby complained from the middle of the line.</p><p>"Dude, be patient!" A blue jay named Mordecai said from behind him. "We'll be out before you know it."</p><p>"Well I do know it and I'm not out!" Rigby said.</p><p>Mordecai frowned and punched Rigby. He then rubbed his arm, and glared angrily at his friend.</p><p>Someone tapped Mordecai on the shoulder. Mordecai turned. It was a boy with a bear hat and green backpack and a yellow dog was right behind him.</p><p>"Um… what are you doing to Rigby, Mordecai?" The boy asked.</p><p>"Oh, he was being annoying, Finn. As always," Mordecai replied.</p><p>"HEY!" Rigby yelled.</p><p>Mordecai punched Rigby again, but it was harder. Rigby fell to the floor. A man with strawberry blonde hair with glasses and a beard turned around and noticed that Rigby was on the floor.</p><p>"Um… is he okay?" The man asked.</p><p>"Oh yeah," Mordecai replied "He's just an idiot."</p><p>"I can see that…" The man said.</p><p>"Say… Aren't you that guy from that show that blows things up?" Mordecai questioned.</p><p>"Yes, I am. Name's Adam, Adam Savage," Adam replied.</p><p>"Pleasure," Mordecai said. "I'm Mordecai and this idiot lying on the floor is Rigby."</p><p>"HEY!" Rigby barked.</p><p>"Quiet!" Mordecai shouted to Rigby.</p><p>"Where's your co-host? Um, Jamie, isn't it?" The blue jay then asked.</p><p>"Oh, he's here, but he doesn't want to bothered," Adam said and then he turned back in line.</p><p>"Man, I have no idea why that guy is…" Rigby was saying until…</p><p>"Mordecai! Rigby!" a voice called coming from the front of the line. It was The Doctor with his blue suit, converse shoes and long brown trench coat.</p><p>"Doctor!" Mordecai said "Are you registering?"</p><p>"Oh yes!" The Doctor exclaimed with glee. "So did Iron Man, Spider-Man and Captain America!"</p><p>"I thought Cap didn't register last time…" Rigby said.</p><p>"He didn't, but he said he didn't want the whole war thing to happen again. I was at the first Civil War. Couldn't stop it, unfortunately. It was a fixed point in time" The Doctor explained.</p><p>"See you at the academy!"</p><p>"This is going to take forever!" Rigby complained.</p><p>
