    <p>The first thing Hagrid noticed upon exiting his hut one fine sunny morning, was that all of the cucumbers in his vegetable patch were <em>gone</em>. Every creeping vine had been plucked clean; only the heart shaped leaves and a smattering of yellow flowers remained on the otherwise barren trellises.  </p><p>The second thing he noticed after assessing the damage, was a rather conspicuous trail of haphazardly dropped cucumbers leading to the lake.  Hagrid felt that it was quite too early to be investigating cucumber crimes, but what else was there to do?  Oh, you know, besides his <em>all of his other</em> grounds keeping duties.  </p><p>Picking up the discarded vegetables as he followed their trajectory towards the lake, he spied a figure towards the nearest bank.  A figure with a mass of straggly blond hair, which was bowing up and down and up and down, which looked rather dizzying.  Hagrid picked up his pace to a trot, before stopping on the banks, watching in quiet awe as Luna Lovegood stumbled over her robes with an armful of cucumbers.</p><p>There were also about half a dozen comatose Kappa strewn about on the bank, their webbed talons curled stiffly as if they were still clutching their ill-gotten goods.  Luna rounded on another Kappa, who was trying to sneak into the water without being spotted, a cucumber clutched tightly to its scaly chest, but stood ridged as Luna forced eye contact.  She bowed deeply, and the Kappa let out a watery little cry as he was forced by the rules of etiquette to bow in return.  The water contained in the depression on top of its head spilled out onto the grass, before it fell face first into the puddle, and Luna bent to snatch up the cucumber from its grubby little claws.</p><p>“L…Luna!  What ‘re ya doin’…?”  Hagrid started to say, but what cut off by Luna’s sudden airy giggle. She straightened up from her bow, arms laden with cucumbers, her robes sopping wet as she stumbled over to Hagrid, trying not to trip over the Kappas.  </p><p>“<em>Water</em> you doing?” she repeated, plopping the harvest of cucumbers into Hagrid’s outstretched hands.  “Good one, Hagrid!”</p>
