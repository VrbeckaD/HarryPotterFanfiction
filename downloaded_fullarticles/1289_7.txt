  <strong>:  This drabble takes place when Draco was a toddler.  Severus as Draco’s godfather is fan canon and my head canon, not real canon.</strong>
</p>
<p>            “And how is my godson today?” Severus asked as a house elf showed him into the parlor where the Malfoys were gathered.  Narcissa stood in front of the bookcase, patiently steadying little Draco who was holding onto her index fingers with all his might as he balanced awkwardly on his feet.  Across the room was Lucius who was crouching in a rather undignified fashion on the plush rug as he held out his hands, beckoning to his son with a look in his grey eyes that was bordering on desperate.</p>
<p>            “Your godson is obstinate!”  Lucius burst out, carelessly shoving his blond hair out of his face in a gesture that told Severus exactly how frustrated his friend was.  “He can stand on his own, and he can walk with Narcissa helping him.  But yet, he just stands there looking at me!  He will not let go of his mother and walk by himself.  I have been trying all day, and your godson refuses to take his first steps!”</p>
<p>            Narcissa giggled, exchanging a look of fond exasperation with Severus even as Draco giggled back at her, happily oblivious to the frustration he was causing his father.  Shaking his head in amusement, Severus sighed, pulling out an item from the pocket of his black robe and canceling its shrinking charm so that it grew to its normal size. </p>
<p>            The Slytherin green, silver winged, red eyed plush dragon caught Draco’s attention instantly.  Framed by fine blond hair, the toddler’s grey eyes snapped to the colorful toy.  Severus crouched beside Lucius, the dragon held in his hands. </p>
<p>            “There now, Little Dragon, would you like to meet this new dragon?  Shall we show your father that, just like him, you are quite capable of doing what he wishes but you will do it when you decide to and no sooner?  And of course, the proper inducement helps.”  Severus glanced beside him at Lucius and smirked.  For an instant, his arrogant friend actually looked abashed, but he covered the expression quickly as they both shifted their attention back to Draco.</p>
<p>            Abruptly, Draco dropped his mother’s fingers.  Severus waved the dragon a bit, making the silver wings sparkle, and that was all it took.  As a waiting house elf sprang into action, snapping pictures with a wizarding camera, the toddler lifted one tiny foot, then the other.  Arms thrown wide and feet splayed apart, Draco took his first halting steps, crossing the room to reach the tempting toy that his godfather held.  In another moment, Severus’s strong hands caught him as he lost his balance and fell, but Draco did not cry.  The dragon was in his hands, and Severus had caught his godson up in his arms before he could hit the floor. </p>
<p>            The boy was giggling again as the dragon erupted into roaring noises, and the red eyes flashed.  He leaned back against his godfather, his blond head against the man’s black clad shoulder, stroking the plush toy contentedly.  And before Lucius and Narcissa reclaimed their son, the smallest of smiles touched Severus’s lips as he pressed a kiss to his godson’s forehead.<strong>   </strong></p></div>
