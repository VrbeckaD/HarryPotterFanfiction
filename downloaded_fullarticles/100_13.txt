    <p>Harry Potter defeated Voldemort three weeks ago, but the war still hasn’t ended for Draco.  He knows he fucked up by walking away with his parents, anything would be better than beings stuck in this fucking cave with nothing but his father being silent and his mother trying to fill that silence, but he can’t just walk out now.  He’s afraid that it's three weeks too long to come forward without harm coming to him.  And it isn’t like he deserves to be pardoned of all his crimes.  He let all of them into Hogwarts.  But he can’t keep living like this.  He’ll go mad.  They can’t even use magic; too afraid their magic will be tracked.  Their wands are at the bottom of a small creek in the Forbidden Forest.  Draco supposes the Auror’s have already tracked them down and stored them for evidence.  </p><p>He paces a lot.  He started pacing when he was trying to figure out how to make that bloody vanishing cabinet work and his legs feel like he hasn’t stopped.  The pacing continues long after his mother has gone to bed.  Draco doesn’t know what his father does.  Lucius keeps his back propped against a boulder and turned away from his family.  Its best that way.  Draco doesn’t think he could stand to see his father’s face right now.  </p><p>He has to stop himself from going down that path, from placing all the blame on his father.  There were plenty of resources around him that could have told him the truth, that thinking there is a hierarchy is just.  Hogwarts was full of resources that should have alerted him to that truth long before it finally did.  Why did it take him the fear of Nagini, watching people murdered, and the threat of losing his family to listen to Hogwarts and the way it called out for him to turn away?</p><p>There are no more tears left for him to cry, so he finally lets his body drop.  Exhaustion overcomes him the moment his head touches the ground.</p>
