    <p>“I can’t believe you would be this irresponsible.” Minerva said, sitting heavily behind her desk which was piled high with unmarked scrolls of parchment and reference books. Hooch loved being in Minerva’s office at the very end of a school year. it made her look almost human: September to May everything was so organized it was irritating to look at.</p>
<p>“Yes, you can.” She replied, leaning back into the large wingback chair by the fireplace and fumbling in her robes for a pipe. This was going to be a long conversation and Minerva hated it when Hooch smoked in her study—at least they could be equally uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Xiomara.” Minerva said, a hint of warning in her tone as she pressed her fingers to the bridge of her nose and squinted her eyes closed. “Do NOT light that infernal thing in here.”</p>
<p>Hooch pulled the pipe from her pocket with an exasperated sigh. It always got twisted up at the bottom hidden under several sedimentary layers of broom care tools, notes to herself on crumpled parchment, and confiscated possessions of the Weasley twins.</p>
<p>“We had an agreement, and you reheated cabbage and beets in the staff lounge last Thursday.” Hooch said, raising her eyes in challenge and reaching in her other pocket for the pouch of tobacco she kept there. Minerva opened her mouth to reply, thought better of it, and gave her grudging wave instead. Hooch smiled and inspected the bowl before opening up the pouch to pack it.</p>
<p>“It is my understanding that Quidditch was canceled this year and that every single First Year has achieved proficiency. Why on earth do I need to be here?” Hooch asked, pulling a stringy bit of tobacco out and pinching it into the bowl of her pipe. Minerva didn’t answer her right away, and Hooch looked up to see flaring nostrils and red creeping onto the Deputy Headmistress’s face just below the hairline. Hooch pulled more tobacco. Neither of those were good signs.</p>
<p>“It is my understanding that you are a faculty member of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Was I mistaken?” Minerva demanded, wrinkling her nose as Hooch lit the pipe, and soft tendrils of smoke drifted into the close space.</p>
<p>“You were not, but as I have fulfilled my teaching duties and the Headmaster so graciously canceled my only other responsibility without consulting me or informing me of his decision, I feel I have met the terms of our agreement for this school year—meaning I am free to do as I please with my time.” Hooch sat back in the chair again. The key with Minerva McGonagall was never breaking eye contact. This was a hard won and indispensable truth that Hooch had quietly passed along to some of her junior colleagues, though none of them but Arla Vector had ever had the stomach to try to use it.</p>
<p>“We’ve been over this.” Minerva said crisply, moving a stack of parchment rolls to the side of her desk and searching for something. Hooch eyed the small tin of ginger candies on the bookshelf over the Deputy Headmistress’s head but said nothing. “I thought we’d agreed that the headmaster’s decision was sensible.” Said Minerva, finally throwing her hands up in exasperation and looking around the chaos of her blotter, as if she’d missed a clear spot.</p>
<p>“You agreed.” Hooch said through the pipe clamped in her teeth.</p>
<p>“Xiomara, you can’t possibly expect—“Minerva began, pulling open a drawer on the right-hand side of the desk and peering in at its contents.</p>
<p>“I can and I do.” Hooch broke in, watching Minerva’s flush creep further down towards her nose at the interruption.</p>
<p>“The headmaster must continually make decisions that affect staff. Surely you don’t expect him to bring you in on everything having to do with Quidditch, which I remind you this decision was related to only tangentially.” She finished, shutting the drawer and holding the knob for support at the very idea of Dumbledore running ideas by the flying instructor.</p>
<p>“I do when he’s canceling Quidditch.” Hooch said. Minerva was fumbling in the other drawer now, and Hooch took pity on her at last.</p>
<p>“Bookshelf Min,” she said with a curt nod and a gesture of her still smoking pipe. Minerva looked behind her, gave Hooch an angry glare over her shoulder, and stood to retrieve the candies.</p>
<p>“The Tri-Wizard Tournament—“ Minerva began.</p>
<p>“Which you opposed reviving,” Hooch said through her pipe. Minerva clapped a hand angrily over the tin and turned, popping it open with her thumb and extracting a dark brown, sticky looking lump. She held out the tin towards Hooch who shook her head.</p>
<p>“That isn’t relevant.” Minerva said, reclaiming her seat behind the desk and putting the tin back in its normal place.</p>
<p>“At the moment, neither am I.” Hooch said flatly, taking a moment to relight the pipe. She’d been talking too much.</p>
<p>“We need someone flying over the maze.” Minerva shifted the candy in her mouth, “For the safety of the champions.” Hooch stared at her.</p>
<p>“Forgotten how?” she asked with a wry grin. Minerva’s eyes narrowed and she hissed out a frustrated breath through her teeth.</p>
<p>“You need to be here Xio,” she said, her face softening if only slightly. Hooch paused for a moment--it wasn’t like Minerva to use anything less than her full name in a chewing out.</p>
<p>“Why?” Hooch asked, extinguishing the pipe with a wave and sitting forward in her chair. It’d been too easy; she would be the first to admit she enjoyed baiting Minerva into actual human feeling, but this had happened far too quickly.</p>
<p>“Because I’m worried. Albus has been acting strangely,” Minerva said, tapping her fingers on the desk, a sure sign of nerves.</p>
<p>“Is that unusual?” Hooch asked, a weaker smile on her face now. Minerva frowned at her, her square spectacles sliding down her nose.</p>
<p>“No, but nor, at this point, is something uncommonly bad happening at the end of term all that unusual, and with the tournament…” Minerva began.</p>
<p>“You think there’s something he isn’t telling you,” Hooch said solemnly. Minerva frowned.</p>
<p>“I know there’s something he isn’t telling me—it’s Albus Dumbledore. What worries me is that HE seems worried,” Minerva said with a pinched sort of look. </p>
<p>Hooch sat back. “And you think that when Grindelwald pops out of the victory cake, I’m your best hope?” Hooch asked, fumbling for the tobacco pouch.</p>
<p>“No, I think you’re passable at best, but one more adult is always helpful,” Minerva said, her fingertips resuming their tattoo on the desk blotter.</p>
<p>“There are three schools worth of teachers here right now, Minerva, and I’ve already committed,” Hooch said, furrowing her brow and pulling the pouch of tobacco from her robes.</p>
<p>“Uncommit, and I only ate cabbage one day last week,” Minerva said. Hooch froze, looked at the pouch longingly, wishing she’d had the foresight for a third pinch earlier.</p>
<p>“I can’t. They’ve organized a signing,” Hooch said, shoving the pouch back into her robes.</p>
<p>“Well, that clearly takes precedent over ensuring the safety of children,” Minerva said, standing from behind her desk.</p>
<p>“You encouraged me to do these things,” Hooch said, standing herself.</p>
<p>“Not when Hogwarts needs you,” Minerva said, stepping forward. Hooch hated this part; Minerva liked to pretend she didn’t know she was using her height to her advantage but Hooch knew better. The top of her head only came up to the Deputy Headmistress’s chin, which made appropriate shows of resistance a futile cause.</p>
<p>“Hogwarts has made it abundantly clear that they do not. I have no teaching responsibilities scheduled for that day, and it is my understanding that such time is my own. Do I need to take this to the headmaster?” Hooch asked, the color rising in her cheeks, stepping forward just enough to make her point without stepping into Minerva’s impressive shadow. The other woman’s face went white. A novice observer might think this a sign of fear, Hooch knew it to be one of fury hitting critical mass and unconsciously took a step backward.</p>
<p>“It’s…” Minerva started, her chest heaving with the effort not to shout. Hooch looked at her boots. She’d pushed it too far.</p>
<p>“It’s?” she asked, her voice resigned to the flood of anger about to be released.</p>
<p>“It’s a bloody exhibition match! I am asking you to do this thing for me, and you are hell bent on providing second seat commentary for an exhibition Quidditch match an ocean away! You can’t even apparate here if there’s an emergency!” Minerva shouted, her voice going more and more shrill with each mounting accusation. Hooch suppressed a wince.</p>
<p>“It’s the first time this has happened in a century! Lives are at stake! Even without the added threat of Death Eaters, or Merlin only knows what else--do you remember what happened at the cup this year?” Minerva finished. Hooch sighed.</p>
<p>“I do.” Hooch said, “I am also under the impression this place is going to be stacked to the gills with professors, aurors, parents, and if memory serves, at least three members of the Wizengamot. You don’t need an ex-Quidditch player,” she said, weariness finally breaking into her voice. She didn’t like it—it sounded like whining, and that was entirely ineffective with Minerva McGonagall.</p>
<p>“If Dumbledore says he needs you, will you stay?” Minerva asked “If I can’t prevail upon your sense of duty?”</p>
<p>“I have no sense of duty, it’s one of the many flaws in my character which you despise,” Hooch said flatly, holding her hands up in mock defense.</p>
<p>“You didn’t answer the question,” Minerva said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“If he asks me, I will stay. That being said, I’d settle for you asking, rather than telling me,” Hooch said, crossing her arms. Minerva’s face fell, honest confusion there.</p>
<p>“Are you saying we’ve been fighting about this because I didn’t say please?” she asked, a note of warning in her voice that indicated the other woman should be very sure of her answer before speaking.</p>
<p>“I’m saying, if you ask me to stay because you won’t feel safe with me gone that’s one thing…” Hooch began, smirking a little at the instant change in expression on Minerva’s face.</p>
<p>“You are insufferable.” Minerva said, “I am not asking…”</p>
<p>“Then I assume you can take care of yourself, and I’m going,” Hooch said, turning towards the door as if the conversation had ended.</p>
<p>“Xio,” Minerva said behind her. Hooch turned, looking at the other woman expectantly.</p>
<p>“Yes?” she asked, hand on the doorknob.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to win this, am I?” Minerva asked, a small smile creeping onto her face where abject fury had been moments before.</p>
<p>“Darling, I’m not sure if you were playing,” Hooch said, stepping back into the room.</p>
<p>“I really hate you sometimes, and I’m telling Albus so.” Minerva said, leaning back against her desk and putting her palms flat to the top.</p>
<p>“I’ll expect a summons from Dumbledore tomorrow morning then?” Hooch asked, Minerva glared at her in response.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to bring you anything from New York?” Hooch asked. Minerva rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“A new flying instructor would be nice. I hear Gwenog Jones has been injury prone lately and is considering retirement.” Minerva said, drumming her fingers on the desktop. Hooch grinned covering the three feet between them in a step and putting a hand on either side of the deputy headmistress’s face.</p>
<p>“I shall do no such thing,” Hooch said, shaking her head. Minerva rolled her eyes again.</p>
<p>“Why on earth not?” Minerva asked, looking up at her for once. Hooch kissed her.</p>
<p>“She’s far too young for you,” Hooch said turning and heading back towards the door.</p>
<p>“Sometimes love I think you still are,” Minerva said to her back as the door closed behind her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Let’s go hotshot!” Myra DeMarco’s voice was piercing—you didn’t hear it in your ears, you heard it in your skin—and Jack was up and reaching for her broomstick before Myra could put that voice to any more use. It was her second year with the Banshees, and her captain had little patience for anything other than practice…which included putting on one’s socks completely or having a broom to play on.</p>
<p>“Sorry Cap,” Jack muttered, stepping past the Brooklyn native and moving to join the line of women in black uniforms with a purple silhouette of a screaming woman on the chest. The team’s two beaters, Keysha Willis and Mercedes Rico, crossed their brooms in her path.</p>
<p>“Don’t be sorry, be ready,” Myra’s voice rang out behind her as she moved through the locker room, rousing her keeper and two reserve chasers.</p>
<p>“Password,” Keysha asked as Jack sighed and moved to go around her teammates.</p>
<p>“I won’t.” Jack tried to the right of Mercedes now, but was blocked there too.</p>
<p>“You have to say it.” Sadie said, she was from California and had recently pierced her tongue, making it a little difficult to understand her as the swelling hadn’t completely abated yet.</p>
<p>“I will not say it. It’s stupid.” Jack tried to push through the middle but was caught up by both beater’s clubs at her ribs.</p>
<p>“I will not be jinxed, girl, say it,” Keysha said, pushing the end of her club into Jack’s stomach and smiling mischieviously.</p>
<p>Jack muttered, inaudible under her breath and pushed forward but Keysha pushed her back.</p>
<p>“Can’t hear you Bahstan.” Keysha was truly terrible at accents.</p>
<p>“I’m from Salem—we’ve been over this,” Jack said, trying to push her way through again.</p>
<p>“Say it.” Sadie this time, though she was pushing harder and it was beginning to bruise.</p>
<p>“McCubbin! Say it before we forfeit,” Myra barked as she passed the three of them, the rest of the team behind her.</p>
<p>“You heard Cap’” Keysha grinned. Jack sighed, her face was going red she could feel it.</p>
<p>“Harpies suck,” she said, spitting onto the concrete floor to register her objection.</p>
<p>“Damn right!” Keysha said, punching her in the shoulder in tandem with Sadie. Jack winced; it took them three weeks to drag that out of her, and now that it had happened it was almost a relief.</p>
<p>Jack took her place in line behind Leah Menschel. Myra was the only one ahead of them, chasers first, then Keysha and Sadie the beaters, then the keeper a tall blonde haired Nebraskan named Susan Whitmire and finally their seeker Loretta Kirby, a foul mouthed middle aged Texan who Jack adored beyond words.</p>
<p>This was always the worst moment, standing in the tunnel underneath the crowd. Jack had played in front of big crowds before, though the Banshees pull was normally pretty modest. She’d been the only one from her team to play in the States’ one World Cup match the previous summer, which had led to Keysha and Sadie referring to her as ‘big time’ for almost eight weeks straight until Loretta had put a stop to it. They had then taken to chanting the Canadian fight song every time she passed until Myra had threatened to trade them to Saskatoon for a jug of maple syrup and a recipe for poutine.</p>
<p>The crowd was large tonight; large and loud. She wasn’t sure how much of the noise was really for them. True Quidditch fans, those who spurned the much more combustible and popular American game of Quodpot, all had their favorite ‘real’ teams--and the Harpies were a perennial favorite for Americans with no hometown ties. In truth, as she’d made the mistake of mentioning to her teammates before the World Cup, the Harpies were her favorite ‘real’ team, which made Jack uncommonly nervous about what was about to happen. The thought of taking to the air against her childhood (which at sixteen was admittedly not quite over), was daunting to say the least. Jack had never felt this small before—she’d gotten through the World Cup mostly on bravado, and had no idea what she would’ve done if they hadn’t been flattened by Canada in that first match. </p>
<p>There was a sudden hush, and Jack could feel more than hear the announcer welcoming the stands to the match. The sound of her voice was so distorted Jack couldn’t clearly make out what she was saying until ‘HARPIES!’ and the crowd erupted into screams and shouts and stamping feet above her head. Jack’s stomach flipped and her breath caught, straining her ears for the lineup as they were introduced. She caught Morgan, Bannock, Andrews, and finally Jones before the crowd became so loud for the Harpies captain that she could’ve heard the announcer better from the moon.</p>
<p>“Go.” Myra said, tapping Leah’s left arm and beginning to walk. Jack followed, lifting the stirrups of her Warhead 2000X, the finest racing broom money could buy, off of the concrete at her feet—a gift from her parents last year when she’d been drafted by the Boston Rockets. When she’d decided to forego that contract to sign with the Banshees, her mother, in a rare show of solidarity, had prevailed upon her father to allow her to keep it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jack was sweating already as they neared the mouth of the tunnel. The crowd was still shouting and stomping. Myra for a moment only, faltered in her relentless march cupping a hand to her ear, trying to hear the announcer over the din. Jack was thinking ruefully that it would be the first time they’d ever been booed in their home stadium when she caught the announcer shouting ‘BANSHEES!’ and Myra cursed jumping onto her broom and racing outward, Leah and Jack followed, there was a scuffle behind her as Keysha and Sadie had tried to take off in tandem and bashed into each other in the ascent.</p>
<p>If the announcer had called Jack’s name as she usually did, she didn’t hear it. The sudden rush of wind and noise as she took off into the arena drowned out anything else. The Banshees did not do the slow, waving entrance loops that most teams in the league did—every one of their brooms had a small, white, porcelain pipe on the underside, molded from a real banshee’s windpipe, and the pipes simulated (and rather effectively said most) the scream of the Irish fay the team was named for. But you really had to get a lot of wind, going very fast, for the effect to work—which meant that every match began with a deafening shriek as all seven of them streaked into the arena as fast as their brooms would go. Jack loved this part. When the team had been founded in the early thirties, the players had been allowed to keep the pipes on the brooms the entire match. When crowds began complaining that the constant keen frightened the pants off of the recent influx of Irish immigrants into New York, the practice was abandoned--though Myra had confided in Jack she thought it more likely that the Banshee players losing their hearing after three seasons of consistent play was the more likely instigator.</p>
<p>Jack couldn’t help but grin when the combined shriek of all seven brooms cut the cheering for the harpies off mid-shout. The pitch had been constructed in an abandoned muggle subway service yard, well away from prying eyes but still backlit by the city to the east. It had an almost abandoned look to it; the stands were constructed from muggle leftovers, steel girders from early Manhattan skyscrapers rising from gravel and dust and left bare up to the very top just for the effect of it, where the stands were bracketed by smooth discolored steel plating.  When she was growing up, Jack had played in old New England stadiums, fashioned from ancient trees and stones: stately, elegant and screaming of money. People she knew who played in them now referred to her home pitch as the ‘Junkyard’. Brooklyn was entirely different; it was one of the reasons she’d wanted to play here—well that and that the Banshees were the closest American approximation of her beloved Harpies. As she shot out into the stadium, her nerves were already subsiding. She’d never felt more at home.</p>
<p>She looked around her to see waves of supporters in gold and green covering their ears, which finally allowed the admittedly vocal minority of fans in black and purple to add their own keening to the entrance. Many of the fans had their own shriekers, made from scratch, transfigured, or caught at a match, and there was a veritable sea of people, particularly in the eastern set of stands where the season ticket holders sat (they were affectionately referred to as Shriek Beasts), holding them up to their mouths or their wands to add to the din.</p>
<p>Jack smiled more broadly now, bending forward and pushing her broom as fast as it would go, shooting past Myra and Leah the crowd whooped appreciatively as Jack took the curve of the pitch at a breakneck pace. Heartened by the response, she turned over her shoulder to see Keysha and Sadie had followed her lead. Myra would have her head for it, but Jack didn’t want the Harpies feeling like they were playing in Holyhead.</p>
<p>“Louder?” she shouted over her shoulder to the beaters who just grinned ear to ear in response. Jack grinned back then pulled up on the broom, the pitch from her screamer changing as the air blew through it at a different angle. The matching shrieks behind her told her Keysha and Sadie were following close. The pitch was a long oval, and she was coming up on the second curve when she checked to her left—the Harpies were right where she’d figured they would be, in a circle on their side of center field. Jack smiled, hit the height she wanted, and made a hard left as she entered the second turn, diving towards the other team’s huddle. Keysha laughed behind her, loud enough to hear over the shrieking and the whooping coming from the stands as they realized what the rogue banshees were doing. Jack pushed herself flat to the broom and rocked right at full speed, letting her broom spin like a drill bit.</p>
<p>The Harpies keeper figured it out first, ducking hard to the right and shouting, there was a moment’s confusion from the other players before they too dove to either side, letting Jack, Keysha and Sadie split their circle down the middle. The crowd exploded in cheers, shrieks, and boos, the Harpies supporters trying to drown out the Banshees fans who were shrieking and howling with laughter. Chants of “U-S-A” quickly followed, even from some sporting Harpies colors. Jack pulled out of the barrel roll and let Keysha and Sadie match speed with her for a quick fist bump.</p>
<p>Gwenog Jones shouted an obscenity that Jack lost in the rest of the noise, but the red-hot anger on her hero’s face was plain. Jack wished she felt guilty about it as she streaked back to the side of the pitch, having the good sense to stay well ahead of Myra Demarco and the rest of the Banshees. When she finally slowed down and waited for her captain, the cheering had not subsided. Jack took the moment to slide her shrieker off of her broom handle and toss it into the stands. It was a pregame ritual that she enjoyed more than almost any other. The fighting for the trophy tonight was fiercer than normal, and Keysha ruffed Jack’s short brown hair, already sticking out in every direction.</p>
<p>The announcer, not their normal one, Jack realized now that she was in the air and felt herself; was discussing the move with her second chair.</p>
<p>“She’s barely out of her rookie year, a little overconfident wouldn’t you say?” a southern drawl came floating out over the pitch. There was a snorting laugh on the other side.</p>
<p>“Not if you’re going to fly like that.” A low, rough sounding voice, British accent this time replied. Jack grinned a little; Keysha was still laughing next to her as they came to a stop, and they watched the Harpies reassemble themselves at half pitch.</p>
<p>Familiar chants of ‘De-MAR-co’ were starting from the east side stands, and Jack watched Myra raise her fist in acknowledgment, though she never took her eyes off Jack. The beasts moved on to Leah’s name, though Jack thought she heard a few of the more excited ones interspersing a ‘Mc-Cub-Bin!’ in between who they were supposed to be hailing at the time—as the newest player Jack was last in the normal roll call.</p>
<p>“Cute.” Myra spat at her, an angry, knowing scowl on her face as she reached her errant players, “Hope we win now, after Gwenog Jones puts you in the damn hospital.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on Myra,” Sadie started, pausing to wave to the Beasts who were enthusiastically screaming ‘RRRRICO!’ across the pitch. The captain cut her off as the rest of the Banshees, most of them barely concealing smiles, pulled up to the huddle.</p>
<p>“This is a professional club, act like it,” Myra said through gritted teeth. She turned her broom, leading the chasers towards center pitch as the others took their positions. Jack tried to muster enough humility to look suitably abashed as she pulled her goggles down—but the crowd was still crowing about it, and her mouth kept creeping into a smirk as she took her place at the head of the V. Customarily, this should have been Myra’s spot as the longest tenured Chaser, but Jack was too good on tip offs and Myra too good a captain to bow to custom.  That was the exact moment when the Beasts reached her name; Loretta was always a holdout, miming deafness to make them shout it again and again. Jack let them get as far as ‘MC-CUB- ‘before crossing her legs beneath her, letting go of the broom, raising both fists above her head and guiding it through a compact loop the loop without breaking pace with the other chasers. She made a point of not looking at Myra’s face but could hear Leah snickering on her left.</p>
<p>Luckily for her, Gwenog Jones was in fact a Beater, and she wouldn’t have to look her in the eye just yet—but Grace Killian, the chaser opposite her, was clearly not amused by her little stunt either and was staring Jack down openly as the ref bent to the large bouncing leather chest on the ground and began to unlock it.</p>
<p>Myra had announced that they’d gotten box number 46 this morning. Each match had a random box of balls supplied for it by the USPQL to discourage cheating, and many, if not all players, had preferences for certain boxes over others. For some like Leah, it was just a matter of some sets being older than others: the wear on a quaffle might make it harder or easier to grip, a snitch that’s been caught hundreds of times behaves very differently from a fresh one, and so forth. For others, there was superstition involved. Jack was legitimately concerned that Sue might not play when they received box number 19 for a game against the crosstown Bronx Boggarts, because she insisted one of the bludgers was cursed and ignored every other player but her. Jack wasn’t immune to this either; the only tip off she’d missed last season had been the same quaffle that was about to get punched into the air beneath her, and she’d given her locker a savage kick that morning when Myra gave her the news.</p>
<p>There was something about tip off that made Jack focus. It wasn’t that she was flighty normally, just that she still had a sixteen-year old’s capacity to be distracted by things like a stadium of people chanting your name or a childhood hero on her broom only a few yards from you. But tip off always drowned all of that out—her world took on a calm, quiet hum, and she could see things clearly before the rush of chaotic action that would follow it.</p>
<p>Jack looked at Killian closely: she was right handed, Jack knew that just from being a fan. She was cheating just a little bit left, her hip dipped down on that side: she was going to spin, maybe shoot down after the quaffle instead of waiting for it to make it to them. It wasn’t a bad strategy, but Jack was going to make her pay for it. She looked down at the ref: she’d release the snitch first, it would take off god knows or cares where, then the quaffle, and then the bludgers in quick succession. The key was the right bludger: if it took off straight like it had the last time she’d gotten the box, she had a good shot.</p>
<p>The whistle blew once beneath her, and the crowd cheered as the little whizzing golden snitch took off into the night. Jack didn’t have a moment to glance at Loretta and see if she’d tracked it. The whistle blew a second time, and Jack pushed down on the front of her broom hard, going vertical and hooking her feet behind their stirrups. She glanced up to see Killian racing down behind her just a few feet back, her broom at a slight slant. Jack looked down, spotted the quaffle and the bludger in front of it, rising fast, being rather obliging all things considered, and unhooked her feet just a foot above the cannonball shooting at her head. Jack let out the breath she’d been holding, and released her grip on the broom, entering free fall and tucking her legs up and back. The bludger missed her nose by less than an inch, splitting the difference between Jack and her still diving broomstick. Jack grabbed for the broom handle with her right hand, listening and getting the satisfying grunt and crack behind her of the bludger colliding with Killian, then stuck out her left hand, never taking her eyes off the ground. Her glove smacked into the bright red leather quaffle, and Jack closed her fist as tightly as she could around the hard edge of stitching. She hooked her right leg over the still diving broom and pulled up HARD.</p>
<p>The crowd was screaming as Jack pulled herself out of the dive, bouncing gracelessly back onto the broomstick and streaking for the far end of the pitch, staying as low as she could.</p>
<p>“McCubbin comes out of the dive with the quaffle! I think she left her broom for a moment there! Killian seems to be all right, though she’s taken quite a hit to the sternum. I don’t remember ever seeing such an exciting beginning to a game that didn’t count before!” the southerner was shouting, though her voice was already magnified.</p>
<p>“She did leave her broom, Gwen, I’ve seen that move several times. And you’re right, a very risky maneuver for an exhibition tip off. I’m sure Killian wasn’t expecting it.” It was the coarse Brit this time. Jack rolled her eyes, of course it was dangerous: <i>(bludger-duck),</i> she was on a stick, forty feet in the air, moving at 60 miles per hour, (<i>Grabley really thinks she can tackle me with that obvious lead?</i>), avoiding flying people, flying bludgers and trying to keep track of two other people doing the same thing at the same pace. If you subtracted everything but the magic stick, it would still be dangerous.</p>
<p>“Hey hotshot!” Myra’s voice was above her. Jack smiled, sat up on the broom, and tossed the quaffle into the air. There was a dull thump as Myra made contact and sped off ahead of her. Jack pointed her broom up and shot like a rocket towards the sky. Killian and Grabley both swerved with a curse to avoid her, as Jack heard the distinctive shrieking from the east stands that meant Myra had beat the keeper.</p>
<p>“Banshees go up by Ten! Myra Demarco with a brilliant deke and toss past Grogan!” The shriekers on the east side of the pitch went off, and Jack rose to meet Myra, giving a quick look at Gwenog Jones ,who was furiously hitting a bludger back and forth with Keysha. Keysha was all smiles about it too.</p>
<p>“They’ll go Grabley,” Jack said before Myra could speak. Myra nodded and pointed Leah, who was hovering just over them, towards the right side of the pitch. </p>
<p>“You got her?” Myra asked. Jack nodded, spinning her broom as the Harpy Keeper let fly, and Grabley raced for it as predicted. Jack took off, narrowly missing a rising Killian moving in to cover her teammate. Jack watched Grabley latch on and move to tuck the ball under her arm; this was always the weakest moment for any chaser—the most vulnerable. Jack lowered the handle of her broom. She had to come up under Grabley’s. What she was planning on doing was, technically, a foul, but not one that got called much so it was a fair risk.</p>
<p>Jack punched out with her left hand as Grabley’s broom kicked up, hitting the quaffle square in the middle and sending it shooting into the air. Killian was quick, but Leah was quicker—not bothering to try to grab it, just volleying it up and into Myra’s path. Jack disentangled herself from Grabley and barely avoided a savage kick from the angry Harpy.</p>
<p>“Demarco again! Twenty to nothing Banshees!” the southerner shouted over the shriekers sounding off again just behind the Harpy goal posts.</p>
<p>The Banshees were making quick work of the Harpy chasers. Jack fell into her usual role; she got the quaffle, and got it to Myra or Leah then watched them streak down the pitch. It wasn’t that Jack couldn’t score, or even didn’t want to, it was just she was better at reading other flyers than Leah and Myra was the best shooter they had.</p>
<p>“Jack!” there was a shout behind her, but Jack turned to move too late as the bludger bashed into her right shoulder and sent her spinning towards the Harpy keeper. She’d just extricated the quaffle from Andrews after Myra scored their sixth goal, and the quaffle went right back to the Harpy keeper.</p>
<p>“Jones with a savage hit on McCubbin. Grogan gets the Quaffle out to Killian, and the Harpies are headed up pitch!” the southerner shouted. Jack winced as she pulled her broom out of the spin and rolled her shoulder once to make sure it wasn’t dislocated. The padding helped, but it had been in fact a savage hit. Jack didn’t have time to think about it though as she sped off after the three Harpy chasers, who were tossing the Quaffle between themselves to keep it out of Myra and Leah’s reach.</p>
<p>“Hotshot!” Myra yelled back to her, and Jack took notice in time to duck a second bludger. This one grazed the tips of her hair, and she turned to see Gwenog Jones bearing down on her, bat raised and waiting for Bannock, the other Harpy beater, to supply her with another bludger.</p>
<p>Jack dove spinning towards the ground, ducking and weaving side-to-side to avoid being an easy target. There was a sudden shout from the crowd, and Jack looked up with everyone else to see Loretta and Julia Morgan, the Harpy Seeker, spinning around each other in a sharp dive.  Jack didn’t see the snitch, but that was nothing new. Jack shot up towards Killian, who was taking advantage of the sudden distraction to make a beeline for the Banshee side of the pitch, coming up underneath her and giving her broomstick a sharp kick. The other chaser held on and swerved, gritting her teeth and kicking back at her. Gwenog Jones had apparently not been distracted at all as a bludger slammed into the back of Jack’s broomstick knocking the tail down and sending Jack into a backward flip that forced her to clutch the handle to her chest to avoid being thrown off.</p>
<p>“Kirby pulls out of the dive, Morgan a moment behind, and it looks like it was a feint.” The southerner said, disappointment clear in her voice as Jack righted herself and took off after Killian again. Jones had bought her chaser a lot of time, and Jack watched more or less helplessly as Killian feinted to her right, then threw left past Sue’s outstretched arms. She hadn’t had time to correct herself and the quaffle sailed through the middle hoop.</p>
<p>“Killian scores Sixty to Ten Banshees!” the southerner shouted into her wand. There was a great swell of cheering from the crowd and cacophonous boos from the east side seats as Jack spat and looked to Sue, who was furiously collecting the quaffle to throw it back in.</p>
<p>“Hey hotshot, feel like pulling your weight around here?” Myra asked, pulling her broom to a stop. Jack nodded. Leah smiled.</p>
<p>“Tank?” she asked waggling her eyebrows. Jack laughed, Myra groaned.</p>
<p>“You know, just because you come up with something doesn’t mean you aren’t allowed to have any other ideas.” Myra said through a smile. Jack turned to Sue who was holding the quaffle over her head and held up three fingers. Sue nodded and waited patiently for Keysha and Sadie to pull in front before throwing the quaffle as high over her own team as she could. </p>
<p>Jack shot after it, Myra, Leah, Sadie and Keysha just behind her. Jack had to slow up to allow her teammates to huddle around her, they reached the quaffle at the same time, Jack grabbed it and pushed it down the broom between her knees then crouched low as the entire team turned towards the Harpies goals. Myra shot out in front, her right arm hooked up tight under her shoulder Keysha and Sadie on either side of her, bats raised in challenge. Leah tucked her left arm high and tight in a mirror image of Myra and took off low to the other side of the pitch.</p>
<p>Jack dropped low, just a few feet off the ground really. The ploy was working. Both Harpy beaters were focusing fire on Myra, with Keysha and Sadie sending the bludgers at the Harpy chasers one after another. The bludgers were bouncing off the dirt ahead of Jack, Keysha and Sadie were hitting them so hard. The quaffle between her legs didn’t want to stay on the broom, and Jack had to hold her breath to keep it there, pushing her stomach out, she couldn’t use her hands yet or the Harpies would figure out the play too soon.</p>
<p>“DOWN!” There was a shout above her and quite suddenly there were four Harpies screaming towards the ground. Jack felt an odd, itching sensation in her left arm, chalked it up to surprise, and rolled right as the three chasers and Gwenog Jones reached the spot she’d been just a few seconds earlier. The game was up.</p>
<p>“SADIE!” Jack shouted over the crowd, who had just caught on to what the Banshees had been doing and were shouting their approval or condemnation over what was admittedly a fairly unorthodox play.</p>
<p>“The Harpies have pulled off Demarco…“ the southerner started sounding momentarily confused. Jack understood why, the commentator’s booth was higher than most of the stands and from above her, she was sure there didn’t look like there was any reason at all for her to be getting this much attention.</p>
<p>“Because McCubbin has the quaffle.” The coarse british voice this time, not bothering to hide her amusement. “It’s really a rather clever trick, though I’m not surprised the Harpies didn’t fall for it for long.” </p>
<p>Gee thanks. Jack thought ruefully as both Keysha and Sadie got between her and the goal posts, Keysha swung backward towards the tail of her broom</p>
<p>“Jack you’re gonna want to duck.” She said calmly as she batted a bludger over Jack’s head to Sadie, who batted it back to her. Jack did as she was told, dropping back and below the two beaters as the second bludger whizzed towards Sadie. She batted it to Keysha, and the two of them moved on to the next part of ‘Tank’ as if nothing were wrong. They were juggling both Bludgers between them, just in front of what Jack was realizing was her rather delicate face.</p>
<p>“Look at that bat work it… that really takes some skill!” the older Brit finally seemed to be impressed by something, and Jack smirked.</p>
<p>You just wait, you old bat. She thought as the Harpy beaters hovered just behind them, thoroughly unsure of what to do. The chasers were even farther back, being unsure of when Keysha and Sadie were going to release a bludger back into play.</p>
<p>Gwenog Jones and Bannock, the other beater, took off over them. They were going to block them, force the issue. Jack frowned, “Close in.” she shouted. Keysha and Sadie nudged their brooms closer to Jack’s. It took some effort on their part, since they couldn’t take their eyes off the bludgers long enough to do anything but go straight at the same speed. Jack took her feet off her stirrups. Holding the quaffle carefully to the broom with her left hand, she sat back crossing her ankles under the broom and bracketing the handle with the sides of her feet. This was trick flying at its finest; she was balancing herself on the broom, with one hand holding herself on.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Sadie asked, fear obvious in her voice; they hadn’t ever practiced this.</p>
<p>“We’re going right.” Jack said, pulling her knees apart and putting the quaffle between them. She took a deep breath, reached a hand to either side, and grabbed the handles of the two beaters broomsticks.</p>
<p>“Don’t break my face,” She pleaded, steering all three brooms right and around the Harpy Beaters, with little shouts of surprise and alarm from Keysha and Sadie as the brooms swerved and then pitched up. Jack’s left arm twinged in pain, and she winced a little; she must have strained something in the transition. But her focus was entirely on not falling from her broom as she steered herself and her two friends, while not dropping the quaffle or getting bashed in the face.</p>
<p>“Jack?” Keysha asked her eyes wide behind her goggles as they neared the hoops. There was nothing in the way now.</p>
<p>“Left,” Jack said, Sadie nodded.</p>
<p>“Right.” </p>
<p>“Okay middle it is.” Keysha swallowed hard as Jack let go of the two other brooms and desperately grabbed for her own.</p>
<p>“One,” Jack shouted, righting herself, finding the stirrups, and grabbing for the quaffle with her right hand in one move.</p>
<p>“Two,” Sadie shouted, turning to her right.</p>
<p>“NOW!” Keysha yelled, spinning on her broom and whipping a bludger towards the middle hoop, as Sadie hit the other towards the right one. Jack threw the quaffle as hard towards the left hoop as she could, staring hard at the middle one. Grogan, the keeper, lost track of which ball was going where, and ended up in front of the middle hoop. She managed to get hands in front of what she thought was the quaffle, but the bludger she’d actually managed to catch ripped her and her broomstick through the hoop after it—to the delight of the Shriek Beasts behind her.</p>
<p>“McCubbin, I think, scores, and the Banshees are up Seventy to Ten,” The southerner shouted excitedly as Gwenog Jones pulled her keeper out of the stands by her shirt front.</p>
<p>“Jones doesn’t look happy.” The southerner drawled with a laugh in her voice, as Gwenog Jones, who in point of fact looked livid, dragged poor Grogan back to the hoops. If Jack hadn’t already been taking a victory lap with Sadie and Keysha, she would have almost felt sorry for her.</p>
<p>“Kirby into a dive! Morgan is clear on the other side of the pitch! This could be it!” Jack looked to her left, Loretta was in fact in a steep dive arm outstretched. Gwenog Jones shot past her, calling for a bludger. Jack sped off after her, even as she heard the quaffle being tossed back in behind her. Loretta was close; she was laid almost flat to her broom, and Jack wasn’t about to let Gwenog Jones get in her way.</p>
<p>“You are extremely annoying!” Jones growled over her shoulder as Jack got between her and Bannock; it would hurt like hell if Bannock tried to get her the bludger anyway. Jack was betting she wouldn’t though, and at least she’d make their second best beater take the shot on Loretta.</p>
<p>“I’m a big fan?” Jack said with a grin and a shrug as she mirrored Jones’s attempts to change bearing, always staying in front of her club. Loretta had flattened out near the ground and was zipping around like a gnat after the snitch. Morgan was still trying to catch up and was, to her credit, gaining. Myra and Leah were chasing all three Harpy chasers down the field, divebombing the one with the quaffle in tandem and trying to knock it loose. Jack was bobbing up and down between Gwenog Jones and Bannock like an annoying fly in front of an angry bear. </p>
<p>Loretta was going to pass under them in a moment, and Gwenog seemed to finally snap, swatting at Jack with her club and going into a dive to cut Loretta off. Jack shot after her, ramming her broom hard into Jones’s as they went down.</p>
<p>“Blatching!” the ref shouted, blowing her whistle. Jones didn’t stop and neither did Jack; fouls meant nothing if the game was over, and Jack intended to give Loretta time to finish it. Besides, she was fouling Jones to prevent her fouling Loretta, surely it all evened out right?</p>
<p>Jones threw an elbow into Jack’s chin. Jack stuck a knee into Jones’s stomach and looked down briefly to guage their distance to the ground.</p>
<p>Jack’s left arm exploded in pain, like it was on fire under her uniform, the skin cracking and burning sending bolts of lightning up her shoulder. She let go of her broom and grabbed it with her right hand out of instinct, doubling over and screaming in pain. It felt like it would consume her, like it was travelling down her spine and into every muscle she possessed. Somewhere behind her the shriekers were going off, drowning out the sound of her own screaming in her ears</p>
<p>“Something…wrong.” She heard the low, coarse rumble of the second announcer’s voice somewhere above her and to her left as her legs curled towards her stomach. She lost her purchase on the stirrups, and suddenly she was weightless—still on fire, but weightless—and the ground was coming very fast, faster than it should. Jack had just enough time to close her eyes and try to focus on the pain blossoming out of her arm before she hit the ground.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“’Once more.” Hooch said nervously. The girl was still unresponsive. It hadn’t been a long fall, only fifteen feet. She’d seen far worse. But the girl had landed awkwardly on her side and still hadn’t woken up some fifteen minutes later, which was not usually a good sign.</p>
<p>“Again?” DeMarco asked, her wand hovering over her unconscious chaser.</p>
<p>“Does ‘once more’ mean something different here?” Hooch asked, exasperated pulling her own wand and touching it to the girl’s temple. It gave a little spark, and the girl’s body stiffened for a moment—and went slack again. </p>
<p>Hooch had flown down the stairs of the commentators booth to the pitch the moment McCubbin had lost contact with her broom. There’d been something clearly wrong, and though she’d be damned if she would admit it to Minerva later, her teacher’s instincts had taken over utterly. Only Gwenog Jones and the Banshees, ignoring that they’d just won the match, had beaten her to the crumpled form in the dust. She’d insisted they move the girl inside before the crowd realized there was something truly wrong. There was a small infirmary just off the pitch, and they’d lowered her gently into a hospital bed, unmoving and looking for all the world like she was dead.</p>
<p>“She’s breathing.” Jones said suddenly, pushing past DeMarco and shaking the girl’s shoulders a bit. </p>
<p>“She wasn’t?” the Banshee seeker, Kirby asked in a startled twang. Hooch rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“The fall couldn’t have done that, Gwen what did…?” Hooch started. Jones glared up at her.</p>
<p>“Nothing! I didn’t do anything, Professor, I swear!” she said, angrily slapping the unconscious girl’s face twice with the palm of her hand as she protested.</p>
<p>“I really hope, for your sake, you’re not lying.” DeMarco said through gritted teeth, pushing Jones out of the way and slapping the other side of the girl’s face with her palm.</p>
<p>“Come on hotshot, you got this. Come on girly, wake up! Come on, dammit, Jack! Wake up!” DeMarco shouted.</p>
<p>“Are you trying to give her a concussion?” Whitmire asked, grabbing DeMarco by the shoulders and pulling her away from the bed. Hooch sighed. The panic in the room wasn’t helping.</p>
<p>“All of you out,” she said firmly.</p>
<p>“Like hell I’m leaving her in here with you two, somebody hexed my girl!” DeMarco screamed in Hooch’s face. Hooch stood up straight; she had almost half a foot on the woman in front of her.</p>
<p>“We don’t know that, and all of you in here behaving like hysterical schoolgirls is not helping,” Hooch said, trying to keep her tone even. It would be lying, strictly speaking, to say that Hooch wasn’t panicking, but there was something to be said for British stoicism. The Banshees had no composure to speak of, which DeMarco proved by pulling at the hands holding her back and launching into a shrieking tirade at the older woman.</p>
<p>Gwen had taken the opening at Jack’s bedside to resume gently slapping her face. </p>
<p>“You know, you’re usualy wearing a nurse’s uniform,” The girl muttered as her eyes slowly pulled open. Gwen paused.</p>
<p>“What?” she asked, the shouting behind her stopped as the other women in the room became aware that Jack was awake.</p>
<p>“Well, normally, by this point in the dream—actually you’re wearing nothing,” Jack muttered a little slurrily through a weak smile and a laugh. Gwen slapped her full force across the face.</p>
<p>“Ow.” Jack said dully as Gwen stood back from the bed.</p>
<p>“Had to make sure she was awake.” Gwen said, her voice flat as she strode towards the door and through it.</p>
<p>“Am I awake?” Jack asked, raising a hand to her red face as her teammates flung themselves towards the bed.</p>
<p>“What’d she do?!” Keysha shouted as her hands hit the rail of the bed.</p>
<p>“It was the keeper wasn’t it?” Sadie said, her face angry and white as a sheet. Jack shook her head, trying to clear the stars from her eyes, unsure whether they’d been there before her Quidditch hero had slapped her into next week.</p>
<p>Was it the keeper? What was the keeper? </p>
<p>“Wha?” Jack asked, trying to sit up. The room and all six faces before her eyes spun like a top, and she collapsed back onto the mattress with a groan.</p>
<p>“Everybody take two steps back!” a coarse, low voice with a British accent shouted from somewhere behind Myra’s head, and Jack was suddenly very aware of where she was. Her teammates, to Jack’s surprise, followed orders, and a tall, austere looking witch with white spiked hair and bright yellow eyes strode towards the foot of her bed. There was something familiar in her face, something Jack had seen before, and she squinted a little, both to focus and to blot out the light from the brazier at the far end of the room.</p>
<p>“Girl, can you look at me?” the voice asked, and Jack opened her eyes, trying to look the woman in the face.</p>
<p>“You’re Xiomara Hooch,” Jack said flatly as her brain finally connected the dots. Her vintage, seventy-five Harpies league champion poster on the wall over her desk at home blaring to the forefront of her mind. This was obviously a much older version of the woman raising the cup in victory on that poster, but it was unmistakable around the eyes.</p>
<p>“Well, I was going to ask you what your name was, the day, that kind of thing, but you seem to be a bit beyond that.” The woman said with a small, bemused smile. Jack tried to sit forward again, and Hooch held up her hand.</p>
<p>“Lie down, you took quite a tumble,” she said evenly stepping to the left side of the bed and past Keysha who was staring openly now.</p>
<p>“I’d never heard your voice before,” Jack said, her face twisting into a grimace at the throbbing, pulsing pain on her left side. It was radiating from her left fore-</p>
<p>“My arm,” she said weakly, moving to sit up again and reaching for the sleeve of her uniform with her right hand. Hooch wrapped a hand around her wrist and pushed her gently back towards the pillow.</p>
<p>“Not broken, we checked. You were lucky, though I’m sure it’s rather sore.” She said with a sympathetic smile. Jack rolled her eyes, she wasn’t eight years old, Quidditch legend be damned—she wasn’t going to be talked to like she was.</p>
<p>“No my arm, something—I don’t know what happened. I was flying, and then it was like someone lit it on fire. I don’t know what it was.” She said. Keysha and Sadie both jumped up from where they’d been leaning on the wall.</p>
<p>“Hexed!” they both said at once, pulling their wands from their robes and turning towards the door.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” Loretta asked, wearing her best ‘no bullshit’ face. Both women stopped.</p>
<p>“To kill every bastard wearing a talon on their chests,” Keysha said with no irony at all. Loretta sighed.</p>
<p>“Can we confirm that first? Or are you intent on starting an international incident?” she asked, gesturing to the chairs at the wall. Keysha and Sadie both looked to Myra, who had her own wand out. The captain nodded grudgingly at the chairs, and the two beaters shot Loretta a dirty look before taking their seats muttering something about ‘Yorktown’ and ‘damn dirty royalists’.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I was hexed, it felt…” Jack started. Hooch was looking at her intently now, head cocked at an angle like a bird of prey watching a mouse. It made Jack uncomfortable, and she faltered before continuing. “It felt strange all game; it started itching, then it felt like a muscle sprain and then…” she looked up at Hooch who was frowning.</p>
<p>“Then it burned?” Hooch asked. Jack nodded.</p>
<p>“Let’s get that sleeve up,” Hooch said flatly, moving to Jack’s shoulders and helping her pull the robes over the padding up and over her head. She handed them off to Myra who looked distinctly put out by Hooch’s presumption to inspect her player.</p>
<p>Something was burning in Hooch’s pocket, a familiar, swell of warmth towards the bottom. She reached her hand into it and pulled the shiny glass ball, about the size of a small apple from her robes, it was glowing bright green.</p>
<p>“Just a moment ladies.” Hooch said, fear in her voice as she bolted from behind the bed, leaving a confused looking Jack with one buckle of her pads undone at the left shoulder as Hooch rushed past the rest of the Banshees and out into the hall.</p>
<p>“Minerva?” Hooch asked gazing into the small glass. Minerva didn’t try to contact her this way unless it was a dire emergency, and with the tournament final tonight, Hooch was sure it wouldn’t be good news. When her wife’s face appeared in the small globe it was tired and drawn looking, white and tight around the eyes.</p>
<p>“Xio, I need you back here now.” There was a note of panic in Minerva’s voice that set Hooch’s stomach in a knot.</p>
<p>“Why what’s going on?” Hooch asked.</p>
<p>“There’s no time! Drop what you’re doing and get back here, the Ministry’s on its way, and Cedric Diggory’s dead!” Minerva whispered harshly through the glass. Hooch’s stomach dropped to her knees.</p>
<p>“Are you safe Min?” she asked in a whisper, her breath hitching in her throat.</p>
<p>“Quite safe, but there’s panic here, and I could use you,” she said through the tension on her face, the result of trying to relay the importance of what she was saying and that everything was fine at the same time.</p>
<p>“I’ll be there as soon as I can, but there’s been an accident here, I can’t leave immediately.” Hooch said nervously flicking her eyes towards the door behind her.</p>
<p>“Xio.” Minerva said, her voice low.</p>
<p>“What?” Hooch asked, opening her pocket with her free hand.</p>
<p>“Be careful, Potter’s been jabbering about You-Know-Who, and I don’t think he’s as mad as I’d like him to be,” she said, her chest rising and falling. Hooch swallowed hard.</p>
<p>“All right, you be careful too love. I’ll see you soon as I’m able.” Hooch said, bringing the glass towards her pocket again.</p>
<p>“Xio.” Minerva’s voice came again, higher this time, and Hooch stopped.</p>
<p>“Min if you want me there by morning, we need to stop.” Hooch said with a weak smile at the glass.</p>
<p>“I love you.”  </p>
<p>Hooch paused. “I love you, too,” She said, putting the glass into her pocket and pushing back into the room.</p>
<p>“The FUCK!” DeMarco shouted as Hooch walked into the room. The Banshees were huddled around the bed agai., Hooch took one look at the Quidditch pads on the chair just inside the door, and knew she was walking in behind the times.</p>
<p>“I-I don’t-“ McCubbin was spluttering in the bed.</p>
<p>“The fuck you don’t!” DeMarco shouted. Hooch took the distance in two strides.</p>
<p>“I SWEAR Myra I’ve never seen it before!” McCubbin shouted back as Hooch pushed through the throng at the bed. The girl was sitting bolt upright in bed, her hand on her arm just below the left elbow, beneath it in red, angry looking welts, was a long mark, a snake slithering around and out the mouth of a grinning skull. </p>
<p>Hooch’s stomach moved from her knees to her boots.</p>
<p>“Where did you get it then?” Whitmire the keeper asked, looking afraid and angry as she pointed at the girl’s arm.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, it’s never been there before!” McCubbin protested, looking at the faces of her teammates in silent desperate appeal. Hooch’s head cleared for the briefest of moments, long enough to interject.</p>
<p>“You’re sixteen?” she asked. Jack nodded.</p>
<p>“What does that have to-?” Menschel asked, her face was taut with anger.</p>
<p>“She would have been three, at the oldest, when the only one capable of giving her that was last seen,” Hooch said as calmly as she could. </p>
<p>She looked at Jack now. “Who are your parents girl?” she asked. Jack frowned. </p>
<p>“Jarephal and Tabitha McCubbin,” She said, looking nervously at her arm.</p>
<p>“They born here?” Hooch asked. The names didn’t sound familiar, but far be it from her to know every damn Death Eater there’d been.</p>
<p>“My dad was, not my mother.” She said, inching back on the bed. What the hell was she driving at? Her parents weren’t like that—sure they were cold, and sort of didn’t like muggles or half-bloods or muggleborns, but they wouldn’t HURT anyone.</p>
<p>“What was her name?” Hooch asked. Jack froze, she’d just asked that, her head still hurt. She must have looked confused, because Hooch nodded and followed it up, “Her maiden name.”</p>
<p>“Macnair,” she said after a moment. She knew instantly that she’d said the wrong thing when Hooch gritted her teeth and swore.</p>
<p>“They aren’t, they aren’t like that,” Jack said, the faces around her, her teammates faces, wincing or falling—all of them wide eyed.</p>
<p>“What would you call getting a two-year old an evil homing tattoo?” Loretta asked, leaning heavily against the wall.</p>
<p>“How didn’t you see it before now?” Keysha asked, looking at Jack like she was almost hurt.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but they aren’t…” she started again. Hooch held up a hand.</p>
<p>“Didn’t realize Macnair had any family, but it doesn’t really matter. It’s not safe for you to stay here. Would one of you go get her some things from her locker please?” Hooch asked. No one moved for a moment, and then Sue stood from the wall and walked out of the room.</p>
<p>“It’s not safe?” Jack asked, a lilt of humor in her voice, suddenly her life sounded like one of Keysha’s muggle action movies.</p>
<p>“If that mark showed up on its own accord that’s bad enough. If it was put there before, it’s worse—it means he’s back, and he’ll be wanting a word with anyone who’s got one of those.” Hooch said pointing at Jack’s arm and pacing back and forth between the foot of the bed and the door with no clear purpose. Jack blanched, looking down at her arm with something like suspicion, like it had been doing things on its own for a while now.</p>
<p>“Were your parents at the match tonight?” Hooch asked, looking warily towards the door and not allowing her hand to twitch towards her wand, though she wanted to.</p>
<p>“No,” Jack said. Her head still hurt, and her arm still hurt, and she wasn’t one hundred percent sure, but she was pretty sure the woman from her Harpies poster was saying her mom was a Death Eater, and she was just starting to think she might be having a very vivid dream after all—when Sue returned with her traveling bag and muggle street clothes tucked under her arm.</p>
<p>“We’ll send the rest of it after you,” Sue said, stepping forward and putting the clothes at the end of the bed.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute where the hell is she going?” Loretta asked, looking at Hooch.</p>
<p>“I’m taking her somewhere safe. As soon as I know it’s safe to do so, I’ll send you word where. Now this is very important. If the McCubbins come here tonight, you are not to say a word to them about me, or that you know about the mark. Do you understand?” she asked the room. There were a handful of skeptical looks, and more than a few questioning ones to Myra—who looked Hooch up and down and then turned to Jack.</p>
<p>“Get dressed; we’ll cover for you. I want to hear from you, OFTEN, you understand hotshot?” Myra asked; her voice was shaking and her face looked pained. Jack couldn’t tell if it was anger or upset or both. She nodded, very certain that her own face was straight up fear and trying to change that—she didn’t want to look scared in front of the Banshees. The thing about trying to consciously look unafraid, though, is that you just make yourself look like you’re having a hard time, and Jack was too beyond tired and too fixated on her arm to pull that off with any kind of dignity at all.</p>
<p>“Broom first?” she asked, trying to give a weak smile. Loretta laughed.</p>
<p>“I’m keeping it. If we’re gonna suck this season, I may as well suck and be fast at the same time,” she said stepping towards the bed and laying a reassuring hand on Jack’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“This is all very touching, and I’m really on the verge of tears—but my wife needs me, and there’s a homicidal maniac who may or may not have just resurrected himself, so if it’s all the same to you, I’d like to get moving,” Hooch said with a glare at the bed. Jack winced when Sadie and Keysha flipped Hooch off and looked up to her teammates.</p>
<p>“Not that I’m not going to miss you guys, but I kind of need to get naked, and for some reason, out of the locker room it seems weird to do it in front of you so….” She said with an exaggerated look of concern at Sadie.</p>
<p>“I’m going to miss you,” Sadie said, punching Jack in her uninjured shoulder and wiping a tear away from her eyes.</p>
<p><i>Sweet Merlin save me from the goddamned colonies.</i> Hooch thought as the Banshees shuffled out the door.</p>
<p>“So where are we going?” Jack asked, reaching for a hooded sweatshirt on the top of the clothes pile.</p>
<p>“I’m going home, and you’re coming with me,” Hooch said bluntly, leaning against the door and wondering what Minerva was doing at this very moment—and hoping it was dangerous or upsetting enough to make her bringing an American teenager home with her as a souvenir less distressing by comparison.</p>
