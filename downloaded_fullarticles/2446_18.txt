    <i>…Now…</i>
  </b>
</p>
<p>Her wand was tightly clutched in her right hand, her head was pounding, her eyes still saw the flashes of different hexes, spells, and jinxes being cast all over the place. Her heart was rapidly beating; her adrenaline had not worn off yet. Her body ached all over and her legs felt heavy as she tried to keep walking.</p>
<p>She came to a stop. The castle doors stood before her, with her left hand she pushed on the huge oak doors. With a slight squeak, the castle doors opened, she blinked a few times to allow her eyes to adjust to the dim light illuminating the grand entrance of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>She forced her legs to move, her feet silently making their way towards the grand staircase, then she made her way up. She didn’t need to look where she was going; her brain and her feet knew in which direction she needed to go. As she kept climbing the endless amounts of stairs, the ache in her head pounded harder, if not possible, louder too.</p>
<p>She could hear voices whispering as she passed the many portraits that lined the castle walls. Some were excited whispers; some were voices of shock as they saw her pass. Unable to escape the pounding in her head and the pain her body was screaming at her, she kept moving past the portraits, oblivious to their conversations.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes to try and push the pain away, however as she did this, images of the fight that just took place only moments before flashed bright in her mind. She could hear the voices yelling hex after hex. She could see the bright, brilliant colours of light flash across the forest. She could smell the disturbed earth in which the fight took place. She sniffed to try to clear her nose, but still the smell lingered.</p>
<p>Her senses made her remember the sight and sounds of people screaming, orange flames leapt up in her mind as she remembered the fire that erupted from the mixture of spells being cast and deflected, then bounce off onto the ancient trees that lived in the forest. She could feel them again, surrounding her and the laughter echoed in her ears.</p>
<p>
  <i>“We’ve got her now” A deep voice rang in her ears.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“The filthy Mudblood!” Another voice echoed through her mind.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Let’s teach her a lesson before she dies. Let’s show her the wrath of the Dark Lord!” A shrill voice boomed in her ears.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“CRUCIO!” A unison of voices said at once.</i>
</p>
<p>She suddenly came to a stop; she doubled over as she remembered the excruciating pain. The ringing in her ears came back and her head felt as it was about to explode. She stumbled up the stairs she was climbing, and she reached out her left hand to break her fall, as her hand hit the stone stairs; she seemed to be pulled back into her present.</p>
<p>Her eyes still closed, she managed to turn herself around to sit on the cold, hard stone step her hand was on. She took a few deep breaths as she allowed her brain to relax and to tell her body that it is over, that she is safe. Just as she thought she was calm again, she saw the flashes of light stream before her eyes. She squished her eyes tighter together and her hands came up over her head, clutching at her scalp as if to rid her head of the memories that burned so bright in her mind.</p>
<p>
  <i>She never saw who had come to her rescue, all she saw were the flashes of light and then the sound of people screaming. As the attention of the Death Eaters left her to see who their new attacker was, she felt the curse lift from her. She couldn't remember how she managed to move as even breathing seemed to rip pain right up her chest.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Somehow, she managed to roll her body over, allowing herself to scramble on her hands and feet. She remembered finding a huge tree to hide behind, to regain her breath and her strength. Before she could do either one of those things, she saw the black swish of cloaks heading in her direction.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Without another thought, ignoring her pain, she lunged forward, her right hand stretched right out in front of her, her wand pointing directly ahead and in the path of a Death Eater. She yelled spell after spell, hexing anyone that came in her sight. The only distinguishing sight she could see was the faint shimmer in mask they wore.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>She had fought with all her might, her brain recalling every spell, every hex she had ever read about or learned. As she inched forward through the mass of Death Eaters, she remembered Ginny and Ron. She had lost them somewhere. They were all together at one point, they had to find Harry and help him.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>However, she couldn’t recall when she had last seen them. All she knew at that point was to get past anyone or anything that was in her way. She had to keep fighting, she had to keep moving. Harry couldn’t be far away, she had a vague idea in which direction he had gone. However, when she looked around her, all she could see were trees, flashing lights and bodies.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>She was just about to cast another hex when she heard the most awful, mass amount of screaming she could ever possibly imagine. She blinked her eyes rapidly to try to adjust to the darkness that fell upon her.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“NOOOOOOO!” A voice screamed out in the distance.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“The Dark Lord has been killed!” Another voice sounded out from behind the trees.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>She stood still for a moment, stunned by what she just heard. After a moment, all she could hear where whispers in the darkness. That’s when she realised the war had ended. Before she had the chance to react, a loud thunderous Crack sounded through the forest, a loud lasting echo left in its wake.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>She hadn’t realised that she had recoiled from the noise. She lifted her head from under her arms, her eyes swept out across in front of her and she couldn’t see anything. Her ears tried to pick up any sound; all that greeted her ears was the sound of the crackling fires that were burning. She jumped when she heard the cheering. All around her people were rejoicing. The remaining Death Eaters had apparated out of the forest; Lord Voldemort was dead, what about Harry?</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Harry!” She screamed</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Harry!” she screamed repeatedly. No one heard her, no one answered her. Not knowing what else to do and as the pain she had forgotten had suddenly returned, she then headed for the castle.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Lumos.” She muttered, and the end of her wand lit up and helped to guide her out of the forest.</i>
</p>
<p>She sat on the steps breathing fast and shallow. Her memories faded as she opened her eyes and looked around her. The castle was deadly silent, even the portraits had stopped whispering. She grabbed hold of the railing and using it to help her back onto her feet. Once she was standing, she caught sight of her hands for the first time. Red, that’s all she saw. Her hands were covered in blood.</p>
<p><i>Is this my blood?</i> She thought to herself as she examined her robes. Although her robes are black, she could see the marks where blood had splattered or spilt, there were tears and holes where jinxes and hexes had landed upon her. She took in a deep breath and that is when she smelt it for the first time.</p>
<p>The coppery smell of blood flooded her nose and invaded her senses, her mouth became dry and she could taste that awful copper taste of blood. She tried to swallow, but her mouth refused to produce any saliva. She once again doubled over, this time sick to her stomach from the smell and the taste she couldn’t get rid of.</p>
<p>She could feel her head pound once again, her brain felt like it was about to explode from her skull, her vision blurred, and she fell.</p>
<p>“Hermione!” She could hear a male voice scream out her name just before darkness over took her. She never felt the strong arms that caught her, she never saw the pale, panic-stricken face of her rescuer and she never saw the sadness in the pair of clouded grey eyes that bore down at her.</p>
