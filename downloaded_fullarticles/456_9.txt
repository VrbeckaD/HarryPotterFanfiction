  <span>“<em>Corban Yaxley?</em>”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry sighed and looked up, directly into the face of the now feral man being restrained by multiple Aurors. Harry had been in court all day, the very same room he’d been trialled in for underage magic years prior. The battle of Hogwarts ended less than a week ago and now Harry was being made to judge each and every suspected death eater,  being the only person the now weak Ministry trusted to answer honestly. His word alone meant freedom or life in Azkaban for these evil, evil men and women. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s a death eater, sir. I saw him fight George Weasley and Lee Jordan. “ Harry gulped as he looked up at the new Minister of Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt. It was hard to pay attention to anything, Harry was still shaken due to the events merely a week prior and the constant screaming and begging from those he had to judge was only making his nerves worse. Shacklebolt noticed, his face dropping into a sympathetic frown, “There’s only a few more to go, then you can go home and relax. You deserve it, Harry.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry smiled slightly, his face flushing only the slightest shade of pink. No matter how exhausted he may be, even the slightest of compliments had him flustered; it’s not something he’ll ever get used to. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Draco Malfoy,” Shacklebolt announced, the same way he had every other time but for Harry, this was entirely different. He glanced up to meet the eyes of Draco, eyes red from crying, hair a mess, but silent and still; he wasn’t fighting, which wasn’t very Draco-like at all.  In the back of his mind, Harry knew Draco wouldn’t be able to slip his way out of this; everyone watched him leave the group and join his parents by Voldemort’s side and he’d already confirmed Lucius’ involvement, sending the man to Azkaban. Harry had despised Draco his whole life, spending sleepless nights brooding over thoughts of the other, acting out arguments with him in the shower, daydreaming of ways to get his revenge and finally the time had come. Harry only had to say one word and Draco would be sent to spend the rest of his days in the worst place on earth but… He couldn’t. It was wrong, even though it was technically right. Draco was a death eater, he did side with Voldemort and even attempted to murder Dumbledore but with all that being said, something in Harry’s gut told him Draco didn’t deserve the fate every other death eater was destined to receive. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry’s mouth opened before he could even make a decision, his gaze glimpsing past Draco to look directly at Shacklebolt who stood in the judge’s stand, peering down at him. “<strong>He’s innocent</strong>.” A few gasps were heard before the whole courtroom broke out into a fit of whispers, members of the court all murmuring to one another as if Harry wasn’t right there, watching them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure… Harry-” Harry quickly cut Shacklebolt off. “ Yes, Sir. Draco was a victim of Voldemort just like us all. He didn’t commit any crimes, he’s a good person, he was merely raised by the wrong people. That isn’t his fault.” Ending that sentence with a stammer, Shacklebolt nodded before gesturing for the Aurors to take Draco away. Draco visibly appeared shocked, his mouth agape, his eyes remain glued on Harry as he was escorted out of the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry spent only another 20 minutes or so dealing people’s fates one by one. Surprisingly to him, Narcissa Malfoy was never brought up. Maybe she got away? Maybe she died? That could explain why Draco was so upset, although Harry was equally sure he was probably merely pitying himself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry was finally allowed to leave, standing up,  wishing Shacklebolt a lovely evening before exiting the courtroom. Surprisingly, he was met by both Hermione and Ron who greeted him with open arms, acting as if he’d been gone for days. Ever since the battle, the trio had been closer than ever, staying at the ever-crowded borrow with the rest of the Weasley’s… asides from Fred. In fact, this was the first time he’d left the borrow since Fred’s funeral,  the world felt like a dark place since his passing and Harry, or anyone else who knew him for that matter had felt very motivated to do much of anything.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How was it? “ Ron asked as the trio were leaving the ministry, on their way to to the Leaky Cauldron for celebratory drinks. All of magic London had been on a weeklong bender, mourning those who they’d lost along the way and celebrating the bright future they had ahead of them, cheering Harry’s name until their voices were hoarse. Finally, it was their time to celebrate. “ Oh, awful. I don’t think I’ll ever forget the way everyone was crying, screaming, pleading for mercy. It almost made me feel bad. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Almost</span>
  </em>
  <span>. “ </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They walked in silence, there wasn’t much to talk about now that everything was over… it was strange. They’d been fighting for so long that they’d forgotten how to merely exist- and, at least in Harry’s case, he'd never experienced proper peace, not having to worry about at least something almost felt uncomfortable to him. They made their way to the pub, sitting down and ordering drinks before  Hermione finally decided to break the silence. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Was Draco there?”  Harry had hoped that the both of them had magically forgotten about Draco so he didn’t have to admit  he’d let him go but of course that wasn’t the case, Hermione never forgets.”Well... He’s not going to Azkaban, I told them to let him go free-” “WHAT!” Ron cut in, his voice cracking, filling the entire pub. He looked around, embarrassed before violently whispering in Harry’s direction. “You let him go? He tried to kill you- he tried to kill Dumbledore. He’s a death eater, Harry. “ Harry shook his head, holding his hands out in defence. “Look. His father is in Azkaban, his mother is missing. Without their influence, he’ll be fine. ”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry’s right, you know-” Ron rolled his eyes, arms crossing over his chest. “Harry’s always right. Malfoy will be in danger anyway, as soon as people find out he wriggled his way out of Azkaban they’ll come for his head.” Harry sighed at this thought,  running a hand through his mess of hair. “ Hopefully he’ll head back to Hogwarts and finish his N.E.W.Ts, he’ll be safe there… safer, there. Are you both going back?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nah mate, I’m going to be an Auror but Hermione-” “I can speak for myself, Ronald.” Hermione cut in, giving Ron a scary glare before continuing. “Of course I'm going back to study. Are you, Harry? I didn’t think you were stupid enough to-” Now it was Harry’s turn to cut her off. “I’m going to be an Auror, too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, mate.” Ron cheered, clumsily leaning over the table to give his friend a high five. “You usually need to have finished and passed your N.E.W.Ts, but all students involved in the battle of Hogwarts have been given passes, so it only made sense...” Harry didn’t look all that excited,  adjusting his glasses, peering at the waiter who walked over and served them drinks. Harry hadn’t seen the guy before, he looked to be a bit older than they were, long golden hair being held in a bun. “Your drinks.” He placed each drink down on the table with a wave of his wand,  holding eye contact with Harry the entire time before smiling at him and walking away. Harry gulped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“-Don’t be ridiculous, Ron. Harry?” Hermione placed her hand on Harry’s forearm to get his attention. Harry looked away from the waiter who was now serving someone else and smiled at Hermione; she looked concerned. “ Are you sure you want to do this? You’ve been fighting your whole life… Go back to school with me, graduate and then pursue professional quidditch or… write books? Get into politics, I'm sure you’d be able to become the minister of magic if you wanted to- ``" '' Hermione. I  defeated the dark lord when I was a baby, I fought him again when I was only ten and went on to defeat him for the last time as an eighteen-year-old. I would be doing the whole world, magical or not, an injustice if I went off and became a bloody professional quidditch player. “ </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione shook her head, slamming both of her hands on the table,  drawing the attention to the other patrons at the pub who were desperately trying to listen in on their conversation without it being too obvious.  “ You don’t owe anyone anything, Harry! This is your life! Dumbledore manipulated you, Voldemort hunted you down but they’re both gone… It’s about time you live for yourself, it’s time you do exactly what you want.” Harry swallowed thickly, unable to make eye contact with either Hermione or Ron. “ I know what I’m doing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“-Wanna go to a muggle club? Party?” Ron cut the awkward science, already standing. Hermione and Harry looked at each other for a brief moment before smiling and standing up. “It’s about time we do something fun” Harry quipped before stepping out of the pub, Hermione and Ron walking behind them, hands linked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They went to the first club they could find, dancing and drinking the night away. Ron found out that after a few drinks Hermione was entirely a different person, bumping and grinding on him as they danced on the dance floor. The pair stayed out until the early hours of the morning before finally going home without Harry who they assumed decided to go home earlier. </span>
  <span>They were wrong about that, though. Harry had ended up going home with a stranger, the very handsome stranger who served him at the pub only a few hours earlier. He learned his name was Jean, a French immigrant who went to B</span>
  <span>eauxbatons which apparently wasn’t an all-girls school at all. </span>
  <span>The next morning he didn’t tell Hermione or Ron, instead he spindled some lie about getting lost on the way home and decided to spend the night at Grimmauld Place. </span>
