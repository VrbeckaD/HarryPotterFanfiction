    <p>The Witch's Collar</p><p> </p><p>A young boy of the age of 16, was sleeping peacefully in his bed. Dreams of boys that age were filled with girls flirting with them. In this one dream the young boy was with a beautiful Asian girl. She was sitting in his lap whispering sweet nothings into his ear while he was slowly massaging one of her growing breasts. The young boy makes his move and begins to tilt his head towards hers. He is about to kiss the lovely girl he has dreamt of for so many times. Their lips are about to touch…</p><p> </p><p>*knock knock knock* *pound pound pound *</p><p> </p><p>“HARRY JAMES POTTER! THIS IS YOUR FINAL WARNING! WAKE UP OR I WILL COME IN THERE AND CAST AN AUGMENTI SPELL ON YOU.” yelled by a feminine voice.</p><p> </p><p>Harry suddenly awakens from his dream because of his mother’s yelling. He softly curses, “No! I was so close this time”.</p><p> </p><p>*pound pound pound *</p><p> </p><p>“Harry! Are you awake?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes mom. I'm awake” sighed Harry.</p><p> </p><p>Harry slowly sits up on his bed and looks around. He sees his trunk at the foot of his bed. He remembers today is the start of his 6th year of Hogwarts.</p><p> </p><p>“Ug. Another year of school… Guess I should get ready”.</p><p> </p><p>Harry picks up his clothes for the day and heads to his bathroom for a quick shower.</p><p> </p><p>---</p><p> </p><p>After completing his morning routine, Harry walked downstairs to the dining room and finds his family already sitting at their seats. At the head of the table, his father James Potter was reading the daily prophet and was having his his morning coffee in his other hand. His father was a good looking man with his slicked up hair. His father was a senior auror who was well known to get his man. He was quite popular with his coworkers and friends. James loved his son but was disappointed that Harry was not more like him.</p><p> </p><p>To his right, Harry's mother, Lily Potter was eating some toast while chatting with her daughter. Lily was a beautiful woman who still had the looks of her youth. Her body was still tight and fit from all of the yoga exercising she did. But it was her eyes that would make every man melt. She had these piercing green eyes that could see into a person's soul. Harry had overheard from many of his classmates that his mother was a MILF. Everyone said that Harry inherited her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Lily loved Harry very much. She had always doted over him. She was quite over protective of him which annoyed James as Harry got older.</p><p> </p><p>Across from Lily was Harry's older sister by a year, Rose Potter. Rose was the spitting image of her mother except for her smaller chest. However, Rose did have a good size bust and cleavage that Harry saw when she would wear a bathing suit or tank top. Harry would never admit it to others but he had dreams of Rose too.</p><p> </p><p>Harry believed his sister would purposefully tease him by wearing tight and short clothes. Then she would claim he was a perv for looking at his own sister. Ever since they were kids, Harry and Rose were always fighting and arguing. Harry didn't understand why Rose was always picking on him but she would always try to get Harry in trouble. She had perfected the innocent act and would trick their father that Harry was the troublemaker. Rose was a daddy's girl. Whatever she wanted she could get her father to get for her.</p><p> </p><p>She was also voted the most beautiful girl at school by all the guys. Every male student would do anything to be her boyfriend. She knew this and controlled the male population. She manipulated boys into doing what she wanted to do.  </p><p> </p><p>Rose stopped eating her yogurt and noticed that her annoying brother had just walked down the stairs. “Well if it isn't the lonely perv. Finally decided to wake up from your wet dream with Cho Chang?” teased Rose.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s face turned red from embarrassment and gave his sister an angry glare. “Shut your pie hole, you skank.” growled Harry.</p><p> </p><p>James put down the paper and yelled at Harry to watch his language and to be nicer to Rose. Harry rolled his eyes and sat down at his seat next to Rose. He poured a bowl of cereal and milk and picked up some bacon. The Potters continued their breakfast until it hit 630am.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright kids. Time to head to the Hogwarts Express. ” said James.</p><p> </p><p>---</p><p> </p><p>The Potters arrived at platform 9 ¾ along with many other wizarding families. James and Lily said their goodbyes to their children. Rose and Harry hugged their parents and boarded the train.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright loser. Get lost. I can't be seen with you.” said Rose. Rose then noticed a few of her friends and ran over to them. They entered a cabin and started to gossip.</p><p> </p><p>Harry just sighed and started to walk through the train trying to find an empty cabin. Along the way in one of the cabins he saw an angel in his eyes. It was Cho Chang and she was with a bunch of her friends laughing and talking.</p><p> </p><p>Harry just stopped and stared at her. Cho looked up and saw Harry staring. She smiled and laughed when her friends whispered something into her ear. They pointed and laughed at him.</p><p> </p><p>Harry was embarrassed and ran pass the cabin. He overheard Cho ask one of her friends why that loser Potter boy was always staring at her. Harry was broken-hearted but held back his tears</p><p> </p><p>He finally found an empty cabin near the back of the train. Unlike his father and sister, Harry was not a social butterfly. He did not make many friends and preferred to be by himself. Harry sat down on the bench and looked out the window.</p><p> </p><p>The train made its final horn blow and starts to move. Harry felt relieved that no one entered the cabin and thought he could have a nice quiet train ride. He took a book out that he found at the family library. It was a book about the secrets of the Hogwarts castle. It described many secret corridors, hidden rooms, and other mysteries.</p><p> </p><p>One mystery Harry was reading about was a room that would grant the wish of the user. The room was called the Room of Requirement. It was located by a tapestry of a wizard who tried to train trolls. Harry thought the room could be useful if he found it and use as a private room.</p><p> </p><p>Nearing the end of the ride, Harry pulled out his Hogwarts robes and put them on. He straighten out his blue tie and made sure his Ravenclaw emblem was clean. He remembered his sorting and how everyone was shocked when he ended up in Ravenclaw. The Potter family had always been in Gryffindor and everyone expected he would be as well.</p><p> </p><p>Harry was confused at first but as the years went along he accepted that Ravenclaw was the right house for him. Harry was ranked second grades wise in his year. Only Hermione Granger had better grades than him.</p><p> </p><p>Harry enjoyed to study and learn new magics. He became quite adept at learning new spells and potion making. Even Professor Snape had to admit that Harry was quite skilled.</p><p> </p><p>As much as Harry was skilled in his studies he was not the same way socially. Many of his classmates were jealous of him or did not even notice him. Harry kept to himself even from his housemates. Because of his social ineptitude Harry could not find a girlfriend. Most girls found Harry odd and stayed away from him. Due to the lack of interaction with others, Harry did not learn how to socialize with others. What Harry did know was what he read from books in his family library. Most of the books were about how wizards were the superior gender and how witches should be obedient to them.</p><p> </p><p>The Hogwarts Express finally pulled into the train station and Harry got his trunk.</p><p> </p><p>“Sigh… here goes another year.” said Harry.</p><p> </p><p>---</p>
