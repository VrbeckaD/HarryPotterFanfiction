    <p>Draco glared at Percy as the older man attached a pair of magic cuffs to his wrists.</p>
<p>“You’ll be able to move freely, but unable to use magic,” Percy explained.</p>
<p>“I know how they work!” Draco snapped.</p>
<p>“Watch your attitude, Malfoy. You’ll be working under my watch for the rest of the summer with Hogwarts rebuild.”</p>
<p>“How am I supposed to do anything without magic?”</p>
<p>“Is cleaning the Muggle way below you, Malfoy?” Percy mocked.</p>
<p>“Everyone else gets to use magic.”</p>
<p>“You’re a death eater,” the Weasley spat, “You’re damn lucky you get away with just community service.”</p>
<p>“I’m grateful,” Draco sneered.</p>
<p>“The train leaves in an hour. We’d better hurry.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The train boarded, as Percy said, within an hour of the two arriving at the station. Percy escorted Draco onto the Hogwarts Express. Draco was shocked to see the other people who climbed aboard: Harry, Ron, the Weasley sister (what was her name?), one of the Weasley twins (weren’t there two of them?) two tall gingers who must have been Weasleys as well, Neville, and about thirty other people who scattered about the train upon boarding.</p>
<p>“Percy!” one of the ginger men, who had scars on his face, called, “Come and sit with us.”</p>
<p>“I’m working, Bill,” Percy said.</p>
<p>“He can sit with us,” Bill shrugged, “As long as he doesn’t cause any trouble.”</p>
<p>Percy grabbed Draco’s arm and followed Bill into the large compartment that the other Weasleys and Harry sat in.</p>
<p>“Don’t speak to my family,” Percy whispered, “In fact, don’t even look at them.”</p>
<p>Draco nodded. He joined Percy on the seat furthest from the rest of the group.</p>
<p>“How goes it, Perce?” Ron asked.</p>
<p>“Better,” Percy answered, “Just…pretend he isn’t here.”</p>
<p>With a quick glance, Draco realized the whole family seemed as if something was missing…someone. The twin, Draco realized. They lost a brother, yet they chose to come back and help repair the castle.</p>
<p>“Percy,” Draco spoke softly.</p>
<p>“What?” Percy asked harshly.</p>
<p>“Never mind,” his condolences would mean nothing to them.</p>
<p>“Hmm,” Percy turned back to his family, “George?”</p>
<p>“Morning, Perce,” the twin, George, greeted softly.</p>
<p>They were always together, Draco remembered. He felt…sorry for the Weasleys.</p>
<p>“Charlie?” Percy asked.</p>
<p>The other older Weasley only nodded.</p>
<p>“Harry?”</p>
<p>“Okay, I suppose,” Harry answered, “What’s he doing here?”</p>
<p>“Community service to avoid Azkaban.”</p>
<p>Draco stared directly at Harry as he waited for some kind of snarky comment.</p>
<p>“Huh. Guess my letters got through, then.”</p>
<p>“Letters?” Draco asked aloud.</p>
<p>“What did I say?” Percy scolded.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want you to be sent to Azkaban,” Harry said.</p>
<p>“Why not?” George growled.</p>
<p>“George…” Percy spoke.</p>
<p>“My brother is dead because of pieces of shit like you!” George snapped, “All of you bastards deserve a fucking life sentence!”</p>
<p>Draco flinched when George stood up.</p>
<p>“George, sit down,” Bill said.</p>
<p>“No!” George continued, “What gives you the right to walk free, ANY of you, while my brother lies in a fucking coffin? Fuck you, Malfoy!”</p>
<p>“I’m…I’m sorry,” Draco spoke.</p>
<p>The twin lunged at Draco but was stopped by Bill.</p>
<p>“We’re going for a short walk,” Bill said, “Come on, George.”</p>
<p>George glared at Draco before following Bill out of the compartment.</p>
<p>“I should have mentioned George,” Percy noted, “He’s…”</p>
<p>“Upset,” Ron defended, “Understandably so, seeing as we have a death eater in our presence.”</p>
<p>“Ron, please,” Charlie pleaded.</p>
<p>“Seems George and I are the only rational ones here,” Ron said.</p>
<p>“I don’t like it either, for the record,” Percy said, “I was assigned his case because no one else would take him.”</p>
<p>“He hates our guts, Percy,” the sister, Ginny, Draco remembered, spoke.</p>
<p>“I don’t hate you,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“Right, and you don’t call us blood traitors,” Ron said sarcastically.</p>
<p>“Stop,” Harry said, “We won’t even be staying in the same area as him. Fighting won’t do any good.”</p>
<p>Ron and Ginny gave Draco the same look yet stayed quiet. Draco looked out the window for the rest of the ride.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Percy lingered in the hall where a giant hole had been blown in the wall.</p>
<p>“Weasley?” Draco asked.</p>
<p>“Right,” the Weasley looked back to Draco, “Let’s go, then. Follow me.”</p>
<p>Was that where Fred died? Draco followed Percy to another hallway with significantly less rubble.</p>
<p>“Get to work,” Percy said.</p>
<p>“With what?”</p>
<p>“Your hands, Malfoy.”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding? I could injure myself.”</p>
<p>“Those are chunks of bricks and a few portraits,” Percy said, “Pick them up and stop acting like a spoiled, silver-spoon-in-his-mouth little prat.”</p>
<p>“Better than being a dirt poor, hand-me-down, blood trai-”</p>
<p>Percy grabbed Draco’s throat and pointed his wand at the younger man.</p>
<p>“Anything else you’d like to add about my family?” Percy snapped.</p>
<p>“No,” Draco squeaked.</p>
<p>“Good,” Percy let go of him, “Now, get to work.”</p>
<p>Draco sighed and picked up a portrait.</p>
<p>“Another thing, Malfoy,” Percy said, “You’d better drop your blood supremacy attitude when I’m around. You’re not any better than anyone else and you’d better stop acting like you are.”</p>
<p>“Would an apology mean anything to you?”</p>
<p>“It might.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for insulting your family,” Draco said, “I should be grateful that you even chose to work with me.”</p>
<p>“You can thank Harry for that.”</p>
<p>“Why wouldn’t Potter want me in Azkaban?”</p>
<p>“He seems to think you saved him at some point.”</p>
<p>“So, why did you choose to take my case?”</p>
<p>“Harry asked me to,” Percy answered, “He knew no one else would give you a chance.”</p>
<p>“Do you think I deserve a chance?”</p>
<p>“Probably not,” the Weasley slid down to sit on the floor.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Bill found Percy later in the afternoon, leaning against a wall, close to falling asleep.</p>
<p>“Perce, do you want to go get lunch?” Bill asked.</p>
<p>“I’m…supposed to be watching…”</p>
<p>“Leave him to me.”</p>
<p>“I’m not allowed to leave him…”</p>
<p>“Go and get something to eat,” Bill said, “Or I’ll drag you to the Great Hall myself.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure you can handle him?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Percy stood up and walked off. Bill turned to Draco, who was sweating and tired.</p>
<p>“You can take a break if you want,” Bill spoke.</p>
<p>Draco jumped, nearly dropping the portrait he was carrying. He stared at the older Weasley, frozen.</p>
<p>“Werewolf,” Bill said, “In case you were wondering about the face.”</p>
<p>“Hmm,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“Fenir Greyback,” Bill continued, “Someone let him into Hogwarts over a year ago. You wouldn’t know anything about that, would you?”</p>
<p>Draco set the portrait down and looked at Bill’s shoes.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know he’d be there,” he said.</p>
<p>“You could have gotten people killed,” Bill said, “Children.”</p>
<p>“I know,” the blonde lamented.</p>
<p>“You could have gotten Ron killed.”</p>
<p>“I know. I…”</p>
<p>“Voldemort told you to kill Dumbledore, didn’t he?”</p>
<p>Draco nodded.</p>
<p>“What did he do when you failed?”</p>
<p>The blonde shuddered.</p>
<p>“None of your business.”</p>
<p>“You’re right,” Bill said, “Do you want to go for lunch?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Draco hesitated.</p>
<p>“I won’t let anyone throw food at you. Come on.”</p>
<p>Draco followed Bill to the Great Hall, which was mostly empty, save for a few people gathered at the Hufflepuff table. No one seemed to notice Draco as he retrieved food and headed to the Slytherin table. Bill followed and sat across from him.</p>
<p>“I doubt you were ever a Slytherin,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“I’m supposed to keep a close watch on you.”</p>
<p>“Can’t do that from the Gryffindor table?”</p>
<p>“Probably, but it’s more fun to see you be intimidated by my presence.”</p>
<p>“I am not intimidated by you.”</p>
<p>“Guilty, then,” Bill corrected, “Either way, you’re very uncomfortable, and it’s amusing.”</p>
<p>“Never took any of the Weasleys to be such sadists.”</p>
<p>“Hilarious,” Bill rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>Draco started eating, apparently pretending Bill was no longer there.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“How long have you been sitting here?” George stood next to Percy.</p>
<p>“What time is it?”</p>
<p>“Five,” George answered, “Bill said you didn’t eat lunch.”</p>
<p>Percy took a deep, shuddering breath.</p>
<p>“This is where Fred…” Percy stopped, “I’m…sitting here like he’s gonna fucking pop out of the rubble! I’m so stupid!”</p>
<p>George sat next to his brother.</p>
<p>“It’s not stupid,” he said, “Sometimes, I…I think it’s all some elaborate prank. Like Fred is going to jump out of the shadows and laugh at us because we all fell for it.”</p>
<p>“Fred wouldn’t be so cruel.”</p>
<p>“Better than the reality,” George said, “I’m…angry at him, for…leaving.”</p>
<p>“You should be angry at ME,” Percy said, “I was the one who distracted him. If…if he’d just moved, if I hadn’t…”</p>
<p>“You made him laugh.”</p>
<p>“What good is that?” Percy asked, “I barely got to see him, I missed out on…on so much, and because of what? A stupid fight with our dad?”</p>
<p>“Fred never gave up on you,” George said.</p>
<p>“Now, you’re just trying to make me feel better.”</p>
<p>“I’m not lying. Fred always went on about how you’d come back, that you’d come to your senses and stop being stubborn. Even I stopped believing it after a while, but Fred never stopped.”</p>
<p>“You…you never acted like, I mean…Sometimes, I thought that…that you didn’t…”</p>
<p>“Appreciate you?”</p>
<p>“Or my achievements,” Percy said, “I wanted you to look up to me, to be an example, but all you did was mock me.”</p>
<p>George patted Percy’s shoulder comfortingly.</p>
<p>“I’d do anything to hear his voice again,” Percy continued, “Even if it was just to make fun of me.”</p>
<p>“Come to dinner, Perce.”</p>
<p>“Not hungry.”</p>
<p>“Then, come sit with us. Draco is at the Slytherin table.”</p>
<p>“You’re not still mad about…”</p>
<p>“Not at you, no. I still don’t like him.”</p>
<p>“Neither do I,” Percy stood up, then helped George, “Come on.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Bill, Charlie, Ron and Ginny all looked at Percy as he and George sat down.</p>
<p>“Why weren’t you at lunch?” Bill asked.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t hungry,” Percy answered.</p>
<p>“Since when do you skip a meal?” Charlie asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t need a babysitter,” Percy said.</p>
<p>“Too bad,” Bill spoke, “You’re our brother, we’re going to look out for you. Now, get something to eat.”</p>
<p>Percy grabbed a small plate of food and ate slowly.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Draco waited outside of the bathroom stall as Percy retched into the toilet. Percy had dragged Draco with him after dinner.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” Draco cringed.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Percy croaked as he opened the stall.</p>
<p>“Are you sick?”</p>
<p>“No,” Percy went to the sink and splashed water on his face, “Don’t tell the rest of my family.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s none of your business.”</p>
<p>“You made yourself throw up, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“Go,” Percy said.</p>
<p>“You did!” Draco said, “What’s wrong with you?”</p>
<p>Percy grabbed Draco’s arm and dragged him toward the exit, but staggered.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” Draco prevented Percy from falling, feeling how light he was.</p>
<p>“I don’t need your pity, Malfoy.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t…how long have you been throwing up like this?”</p>
<p>“I’ll obliviate you if you try and tell anyone,” Percy threatened, leaning almost completely on Draco.</p>
<p>Draco rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>“Fine. I won’t tell anyone.”</p>
<p>“I need to sit,” Percy grumbled.</p>
<p>The younger man helped Percy sit.</p>
<p>“You need to go to Madame Pomfrey,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“It’ll pass. Just…give me a minute.”</p>
<p>“You do this a lot, then.”</p>
<p>“What part of ‘none of your business don’t you understand?”</p>
<p>“Pardon me for having a modicum of empathy.”</p>
<p>“For a ‘blood traitor?’”</p>
<p>“You’re not a…I’m sorry,” the blonde explained, “Toward the end of the war, I started to question the things I held to be true…blood supremacy stuff. I questioned a lot of things actually.”</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you…if you tell me when this started.”</p>
<p>“After I left my family,” Percy said, “A couple years ago. I cut them off, disowned them, really. Cast myself into the adult world, alone. It was stressful to say the least. I just…stopped eating, you know?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t. Sorry.”</p>
<p>“At least I could control it,” Percy continued, “Everything else was…pure chaos, but this…”</p>
<p>“And the puking?”</p>
<p>“Eating feels disgusting to me…sometimes…And, sometimes, it’s just…an accident. Even after small meals.”</p>
<p>“Was this on purpose?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Bill made me eat.”</p>
<p>“Your family hasn’t noticed?”</p>
<p>“I’ve charmed my clothes, so they don’t flatten against my skin,” Percy explained, “And to puff out my cheeks. Scent charms to coat the smell of vomit.”</p>
<p>“They’re going to find out when you change your clothes in the dorms.”</p>
<p>“No, they won’t. I’m staying with you in the Slytherin dorms.”</p>
<p>“You expect me not to tell your brothers about this?”</p>
<p>“I expect you not to care. I expect them not to believe you.”</p>
<p>“Do you think you can make it to the Slytherin house?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I think so.”</p>
<p>Draco held Percy up. After a moment, the Weasley stood on his own.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“You never told me your secret,” Percy quickly changed into his pajamas.</p>
<p>Draco spotted Percy as they fell loosely upon his skin. He’d never seen anyone so thin: Percy’s shoulder blades and spine protruded as he leaned over to grab his robes.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it matters at this point,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“You’re staring,” Percy noticed, “And, I told you THIS. You owe me.”</p>
<p>“It’s…I’ve been questioning my sexuality.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>“You still want to share a room with me?”</p>
<p>“Why wouldn’t I?”</p>
<p>“I suppose your family is more accepting.”</p>
<p>Percy shrugged.</p>
<p>“I take it death eaters aren’t fond of same-sex attraction?”</p>
<p>“Does that surprise you?”</p>
<p>“No. Good night, Malfoy.”</p>
