    <p>It's 1977 and the Marauders are riding high in their sixth year at Hogwarts. They're still working out the kinks after newly becoming Animagi, but life is good. Wreaking havoc about the school and pissing off any teacher they happen to interact with is beyond entertaining- even Remus gets into it from time to time. The school year has settled into session and students are re-accustomed to their new routine, the Marauders' chaos only worsening year by year. Regardless of the mischief, everything feels safe. The first Hogsmeade trip comes and goes (accompanied by another attempt at Lily made by James- "I swear she's into me!! She didn't shove me into any foliage this time.."), and Remus is trying to cope with some new potential- and for the time being, nameless- feelings. It isn't until around mid-October when a foreign face shows itself in the castle, that everything changes for the boys.</p>
