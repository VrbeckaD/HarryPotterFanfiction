    <p>Violetta Janine Potter stood at the top of the astronomy tower staring out over the grounds of the castle she’d once called home. The place that had become her prison the way #4 Privett Drive had once been.</p>
<p>	It had started innocently enough, with McGonagall asking for her help along with Ron and Hermione to rebuild the castle after the final battle. From there she’d been asked (read guilted) into finishing her Hogwarts education by Hermione, and then Hermione, McGonagall, and Kingsley had teamed up on her to convince her to become the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.</p>
<p>	She hadn’t minded really. After all she’d been a bit aimless and she’d enjoyed teaching the DA during the time when Umbridge had ruled the school. Plus Hogwarts had always felt like home to her. Thus she set about her task with a will, teaching all she could to the students, devising lesson plans, grading papers, dispensing advice and in her free time exploring the castle and learning new things.</p>
<p>	It was during her exploration of the grounds one day that Fawkes had found her. No one had seen the phoenix since Dumbledore’s funeral and personally she thought the bird was off doing his own version of mourning for the venerated headmaster. She’d honestly not expected to see him again, and yet there he’d been.</p>
<p>	He’d managed to convey to her, through a strange version of sign language and her own ability to understand animals in general that he’d like to stay with her. She’d agreed with this wholeheartedly, having wanted a new familiar but not having had the heart to replace Hedwig as of yet.</p>
<p>	Fawkes had become an integral part of her life then, her constant companion the same way Hedwig had been, and the only one to stay by her side as around her friends and colleagues seemed to move on with their lives, settling down, getting married and having children with their soulmates, while she felt stuck unsure what to do with herself.</p>
<p>	He helped ease her loneliness and taught her things about Hogwarts she never would’ve guessed, showing her secret rooms and passages, along with being her ambassador whenever she went into the Forbidden Forest. He kept her company as she graded papers, supervised her classes, and soothed her nightmares of the war with softly sung birdsong.</p>
<p>	Between Fawkes and the children, whom she really enjoyed teaching she was content, and probably could’ve stayed content for the rest of her life, but it wasn’t to be. It turned out one of the major reasons her friends had been so insistent on her taking the Defense professorship was so that they could keep an eye on her.</p>
<p>	Ron and Hermione had apparently spilled their guts about the entirety of the Horcrux hunt including the information on the Deathly Hallows and that she’d possessed them all at one point. It had come as a shock to her, but that wasn’t even scraping the surface of the depths of their betrayal. Which she wouldn’t find out about until being called into a full meeting of the Wizengamot to hear her sentence handed down.</p>
<p>	Apparently they’d spent the time between the Final Battle and that very moment working on legislature meant to keep her from becoming “the next big threat to the Magical Population of England,” while simultaneously trying to isolate her into never finding her soulmate lest they become an uncontrollable influence on her.</p>
<p>	It was only because she’d been the best Defense professor Hogwarts had ever had, that kept her from being locked into the depths of the Department of Mysteries for the rest of her unnaturally long life. Apparently McGonagall and Kingsley were impressed enough with the competent and powerful students that she’d churned out over the years that they wanted her to keep doing it.</p>
<p>	Thus she’d been given a choice. Spend the rest of her life “aiding in the demystification of the powers of the Deathly Hallows,” or be confined to Hogwarts Grounds instead. It hadn’t been much of a choice, either be imprisoned and experimented on for the rest of her life, or imprisoned and coerced into helping them churn out perfect light soldiers for their cause. </p>
<p>	That’s not what they had said of course, something about the “betterment of society” and “in her best interests”. However the war had stripped her of the naivety that had once inspired her to become a martyr and she could read between the lines very clearly. They didn’t trust her, hell they didn’t even like her, and every single one of her so-called friends and allies had conspired behind her back to take away what little freedom she’d thought she’d finally won for herself.</p>
<p>	In the end she’d chosen the Hogwarts option, muttering some appeasing words about “aiding the children” and such. She wasn’t all too sure what she’d actually said, having been incredibly numb by then, but it seemed to have pleased them. Hell Kingsley had even shaken her hand and told her he appreciated her understanding the situation.</p>
<p>	She’d been escorted back to the castle and back to her rooms, and then made her way to the Room of Requirement, which had long since repaired itself. There, safe without an audience, she’d managed to throw a tantrum of epic proportions, hurling around the darkest and most dangerous spells she’d learned from years of study to become an expert in her post, screaming her rage and betrayal to the heavens.</p>
<p>	When she’d finally calmed down, she realized she was wasting her time. She needed to get out of here, before they could get the wards up to keep her here forever. She wasn’t about to be their docile little lamb, at least not this time. Unfortunately the realization had come too late, and by the time she’d made it out of the room, packed her things, and got ready to run the wards were already up.</p>
<p>	She’d tried to break through them, but instead of breaking or even bending they seemed to absorb her magic. Hermione had shown up then, and asked what she was doing. She’d mentioned being curious about the wards that would allow others to pass through easily but keep her locked up and “safe”.</p>
<p>	As usual her know-it-all former friend had been more than happy to explain, telling her that the wards were tied to her blood, so of course they wouldn’t let her through. She’d finished the whole lecture off by assuring her they were still on for tea on Saturday, as if she hadn’t just finished betraying her in the worst possible ways, by not only conspiring for all this to happen, but designing the wards and stealing her blood.</p>
<p>	Violetta had just nodded and Hermione had gone on her way, passing freely through the wards, headed home to her loving soulmate, and leaving her here alone, trapped, and anguished.</p>
<p>	That had been almost three months ago, and now Violetta was stood at the top of the Astronomy tower, as high as she could go, sequestered away from everyone and everything. Her original anger had given way to being numb, because there was nothing she could do.</p>
<p>	Sure she was strong enough she could slaughter everyone in the castle from McGonagall down to the last little First year student, but what good would that do her? McGonagall may deserve the retribution but the children were innocent. In fact many of them had approached her, to ask what was wrong, or try to help her. A couple of her seventh years had even promised to see what they could do to try to change things for her.</p>
<p>	A part of her had been touched by their kindness, but another part, the more world weary and tired part had simply brushed them off. There was nothing anyone could do for her now. She was well and truly stuck.</p>
<p>	The soft sweet sound of phoenix song made her glance up in surprise as Fawkes appeared in a flash of red gold fire. She’d honestly thought her companion might’ve abandoned her too, after he’d disappeared on her right after she’d told him about her new imprisonment.</p>
<p>	At that point she’d been so numb that even though his loss was another blow, she hadn’t been able to feel much of anything, much less acknowledge his absence, which is why it came as a shock to see him again now.</p>
<p>	“Fawkes?” she asked surprised, “What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>	The phoenix cooed at her, and she could see both affection and sorrow on his face as he gently landed on her shoulder and placed his cheek next to hers, singing softly into her ear. It was like the one touch broke the hold she’d kept on the icy shell of numbness that had protected her from the storm of rage, hurt and pain.</p>
<p>	Slowly she slid to the floor, holding the surprisingly light bird in her lap and sobbed into his feathers, great, wracking, ugly sobs of desolation, all the while the bird sung soothing songs for her, gently preening her hair with his beak as if to encourage her to get it all out.</p>
<p>	She didn’t know how long they sat there together, only that by the time she was done she was feeling rather cathartic. She’d learned when Sirius died that it wasn’t good to hold on to those kinds of emotions the way she had, bottling them up almost always led to an explosion or breakdown of epic proportions. </p>
<p>Luckily this one had just led to a crying jag on the astronomy tower, and not something worse, like after Sirius had died and she tried to use the Cruciatus curse on Bellatrix, or during the stress of sixth year when she’d used Sectumsempra on Malfoy. </p>
<p>She’d regretted both of those deeply, the Bellatrix one more because it got her in a lot of trouble, and had actually been used as part of the reasoning to keep her under watch, than because she regretted trying to hurt the bitch. She’d killed Sirius after all, and even now was one of the most twisted individuals she’d ever met outside of Voldemort himself. She just regretted not using a more legal spell to do it.</p>
<p>The Malfoy one she regretted in the much more sincere sense in that he hadn’t deserved to be hurt like that. Sure he was an asshole and her self-proclaimed rival, but he hadn’t deserved to nearly be killed by a nasty curse. Especially since he’d been suffering just as much as she had that year.</p>
<p>When she found out that the only reason Malfoy had done what he had that year was because Voldemort had threatened his family she had instantly forgiven him. How could she not? She would’ve done the same thing under the circumstances. Apparently though her testimony on his and Narcissa Malfoy’s behalf had been just one more strike against her in the end.</p>
<p>“What am I going to do Fawkes?” she asked the phoenix miserably as her thoughts turned back to her situation.</p>
<p>“All I ever wanted was to be free, free to have a normal life out from under the shadow of Voldemort the Mad, free to be myself and to do the things I wanted for once, free to maybe find my soulmate and fall in love, and now here I am, caged once again,” she told him bitterly.</p>
<p>The phoenix trilled at her a questioning sound, that she’d learned to interpret over the years they’d spent together, had her wiping her eyes and casting a freshening spell on her face, in light of his offer.</p>
<p>“Okay, you have an idea? I’m willing to do anything at this point to have my freedom,” she told him seriously.</p>
<p>He trilled again, a very serious sound as he peered up at her from her lap, a stern expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Yes Fawkes, anything,” she promised, and meant it.</p>
<p>The phoenix nodded to himself, and the two of them disappeared in a flash of flames, leaving a stunned seventh year student behind.</p>
<p>She’d been sent by professor McGonagall to retrieve her favorite professor for a staff meeting. However when she’d arrived she’d been shocked to see the strong, unflappable, kind professor huddled into a ball, cuddling her pet phoenix like a stuffed toy and crying her eyes out.</p>
<p>She’d stepped away, caught between giving her professor privacy and fulfilling her job from McGonagall, but eventually she’d hardened herself. McGonagall could wait. Professor Potter deserved a chance to cry. Hell she deserved a heck of a lot more than that, and she certainly didn’t deserve what had been done to her.</p>
<p>She and a bunch of her fellow students had been scheming since the declaration of Professor Potter’s imprisonment began on how to get her freedom for her again. The professor was much beloved after all, a fantastic teacher, with no house prejudice, who always kept her door open for students in need. She’d always been willing to help them, and they in turn had felt the need to help her.</p>
<p>Unfortunately most of their ideas would take years to properly implement, and while they wouldn’t mind the work, they could see the life draining out of their professor already. Frankly she hadn’t been sure the torn down woman would last long enough for them to get her, her freedom.</p>
<p>Still she was determined to try, and so were the others. However it seemed things had already been taken care of. Her heart had nearly broken for her poor professor as she confessed to only wanting to be free, but then the phoenix had done something, and the two had vanished in a whorl of flames.</p>
<p>Hesitantly moving on to the open platform of the Astronomy tower, she took a good look around, but it seemed the professor was well and truly gone. To where she didn’t know, but she hoped wherever it was she was happy and free.</p>
<p>Determined to do her part to keep others off the professor’s trail, she proceeded to track down her group of friends, the ones who had agreed to help professor Potter with her, and they came up with a solid alibi and a plan that would hopefully give the professor a good head start before anyone noticed she was missing.</p>
<p>As they proceeded to launch a prank war on the staff the likes of which hadn’t been seen since Fred and George Weasley’s attacks on Umbridge, with the entirety of the castle, including ghosts and Peeves joining in, she promised herself that she wouldn’t forget professor Potter.</p>
<p>Even though she was gone somewhere where she would hopefully be free, she was still going to change things. Catching the eyes of her soulmate across the field of destruction they’d caused she saw her fierce burning gaze and knew she understood. The two of them would change the world, so the professor Potter’s of the world could have their freedom.</p>
<p></p><div align="Center">
  <p>…~oO*Oo~…</p>
</div>“Marco, you really need to relax,” Thatch told his friend, having been the one elected by the other Division Commanders to try and talk to their agitated brother.<p>He couldn’t really blame the other man for being anxious. Just last week, for the first time ever they’d met a phoenix. The creature had appeared in a flash of red and gold flames, and had landed on the tip of the mast, just above their flag. Needless to say the men on watch had been really startled, and chaos had ensued as they tried to figure out where the strange new bird had come from, and what it wanted.</p>
<p>After all it was apparently able to create it’s own flames, and therefore could be extremely bad news. Fire plus wooden Moby Dick equals trouble, or at least that was Thatch’s way of thinking. Unfortunately since it was at the at the top of the highest mast no one wanted to climb up, and he certainly couldn’t blame them. It definitely wouldn’t be safe, especially if the bird attacked, and so they continued to run around like headless chickens trying to figure out what to do.</p>
<p>The whole time the bird in question had simply sat on the mast observing them all with intelligent eyes. Looking back on it, Thatch was pretty sure the damn thing was laughing at them.</p>
<p>You’d think that being one of the strongest and longest standing crews in the New World the Whitebeard Pirates would’ve handled the surprise with a little more dignity. After all they saw and did impossible things every day. Normally you’d be correct, but some of the divisions tended to be a little more excitable than others, and while he would admit nothing it may or may not have been his division on watch duty that day.</p>
<p>Eventually some clever crewmember had the bright idea to fetch Marco, thinking maybe he could fly up to investigate. Needless to say the First Division Commander had not been amused to be disturbed from his rooms. Unfortunately the strange firebird had managed to show up on one of Marco’s very few days off. If things hadn’t turned out the way they had, Thatch was pretty sure Marco would’ve tried to roast him, despite the fact his flames were only meant for healing.</p>
<p>Strangely though the minute the First Division Commander had arrived on deck the creature had launched itself downwards and come to hover in front of Marco’s face making trilling sounds that were at once both extremely familiar and strangely foreign.</p>
<p>Marco had gone white with shock, and staggered back in surprise. The group of them watching had become anxious and immediately moved to intercept the bird, to capture it or just scare it off, to get it away from their First Division Commander. Marco was a New World Veteran, having been sailing with Oyaji since the very beginning, that something would cause him to loose his composure was definitely cause for alarm. </p>
<p>Thatch himself had been with the Whitebeard pirates for over two decades now, and he’d only seen his brother loose his composure like that a handful of times. Once when Oyaji had been badly hurt, once when a foolish crewmember had almost gotten himself and his entire division killed, and once when Marco had lost ten members of his Division in a surprise attack by Marines. Needless to say he’d been more than a little concerned. However Marco had immediately told them to back off, his eyes locked with the strange bird’s.</p>
<p>Thatch could still remember the awe in his unflappable brother’s voice as he revealed what the creature was, a phoenix. Which in hindsight probably should’ve been obvious but in his defense Thatch had thought all phoenixes were going to be blue and gold like Marco if they ever found another one.</p>
<p>Still it was kind of a miracle that they’d found one at all. He knew for a fact that Marco had been searching for years in an attempt to find some. Now here it was, having almost literally landed in his lap.</p>
<p>To their surprise and Marco’s delight the creature had stuck around for over a week. They’d all managed to be extremely careful around the bird, as it became pretty obvious that Marco was very protective of the thing. The only people he allowed close to it were Oyaji and the Division Commanders. Thatch couldn’t blame him, the fiery creature was pretty damn amazing.</p>
<p>That first night it had stayed, sometime around twilight it had started to sing. The song was the most beautiful thing Thatch had ever heard, full of peace and hope and love. It was uplifting and reminded him strongly of the love he had for his family. More than a few of them had been near tears or outright sobbing by the end of it.</p>
<p>Luckily Thatch had managed to save his dignity by asking Marco, who was smirking at him in amusement, probably for being a sap, why he couldn’t sing like that.</p>
<p>Marco had not been amused. Not everyone knew it, but despite being a bird Zoan outside of his phoenix form the First Division commander sang like a dying frog. Information Thatch was only privy to, thanks to the questionable privilege of standing close to him when the entire crew was singing happy birthday to Oyaji one year.</p>
<p>If the result of that particular tease had been Marco informing Thatch he’d be cleaning the bathrooms on the next chore rotation, well his pride was at least intact and he’d get Marco back for it later.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the day before yesterday Marco’s fellow avian had decided to take off without warning, and hadn’t been seen since. Marco wasn’t the only one disappointed, more than a few of his brothers, including Thatch himself, had been hoping the interesting firebird would stick around, maybe even become an unofficial mascot for the crew like Oyaji’s dog Stefan.</p>
<p>	Luckily Oyaji had been easy to convince that they should hang around the area for a bit, just in case the phoenix came back. Unfortunately they couldn’t stay for too long as they were in the middle of the open ocean with no nearby island available for supplies. Thus they could only stay a week or so at most. </p>
<p>Ever since they’d gotten confirmation they could stay Marco had been pacing around the deck, eyes constantly on the sky. He hadn’t even paused at meal times, and probably wouldn’t have eaten if Thatch hadn’t insured he was brought food. He wasn’t entirely sure his friend had slept either, though he was pretty sure he hadn’t.</p>
<p>	“I’m sure your fellow turkey will return,” Thatch assured as best he could, “He seemed to really like you.”</p>
<p>	And it was true, the entire time the firebird had stayed with them, it had been at Marco’s side, following him around everywhere or riding around on his shoulder and keeping up a steady stream of trilling coos, and warbles, which Marco had answered back to in his own human voice, his tone low and quiet.</p>
<p>	His brother had revealed that while he couldn’t understand completely what the other bird was saying, he could get general ideas and feelings from it, and he’d been taking advantage of the phoenix’s presence to finally get some of his questions answered.</p>
<p>	It turned out that phoenix’s were extremely intelligent, something some of his brothers had found out the hard way. They’d been speculating on whether a phoenix shed feathers and if they might be able to pluck one to see if it caught fire, which was a terrible idea as both Marco and the phoenix were in hearing range. Before Marco could even open his mouth though, the seat of the pants of both conspirers caught aflame, and they’d ended up running around the deck like idiots before they realized that the fire wasn’t actually burning them.</p>
<p>	Both Marco and Thatch had been extremely amused, and probably would have been even if it had been real fire. They were pirates after all, and Thatch would’ve loved to see what the nurses had to say when asked to treat their burned asses. Still it was terribly funny, and Marco had added even more punishment on top of the humiliation to keep anyone from even thinking they could try something like that with his fellow phoenix.</p>
<p>	It was good that the bird could answer some of Marco’s questions itself though. Apparently after discovering just what he was Marco had scoured all kinds of books, and Oyaji had helped him journey all over the place looking for answers on the capabilities of phoenixes. Unfortunately unlike normal animals like bears or hawks due to their mythical status information was really scarce, some of it little more than rumors or fairytales. </p>
<p>Having a real, actual live phoenix on board had been a bit of a dream come true for Marco, because he could finally get some real answers. Unfortunately it also meant the blow of it leaving was pretty terrible. Still, there was nothing they could do now. It would come back or it wouldn’t. At least now they knew they existed and could keep an eye out.</p>
<p>Oyaji could probably be convinced to adventure around looking for them now that they knew for sure. Thatch was sure the entire crew would be all for that kind of adventure, that Marco would get more of the information he was looking for would just be an added bonus to most, and those who normally might’ve protested at the wild goose chase wouldn’t because it was for Marco’s sake.</p>
<p>	“Come on, you may heal from pretty much everything but you do still need to sleep,” Thatch tried again. Marco just glanced at him and grunted quietly in affirmation that he’d heard before turning his eyes back on the sky. Thatch really hoped the bird would come back for Marco’s sake. He had the feeling his friend would be really devastated if it didn’t.</p>
<p>	Marco wasn’t the kind of person to get upset or angry easily, but seeing and meeting a phoenix, for the first time ever, it had meant a lot to him. Being one of his close friends Thatch often thought that maybe the idea of being a mythical zoan, one of a kind, had made Marco a little lonely.</p>
<p>	He knew it wasn’t easy to be the right hand of Whitebeard and that it often times made Marco more of an authority figure than a friend to a lot of the crew. He had kind of secretly hoped that the phoenix would stay if only to alleviate some of his friend’s loneliness. He and the other Division Commanders did their best, trying to treat him like the brother he was, but there was really no doubt Marco was the oldest brother even in that relationship, which still put him in a position above them.</p>
<p>	On top of that Thatch knew Marco’s secret, the one he kept carefully hidden, the handwriting set squarely between his hips. It was a soul mark, that part wasn’t surprising, everyone in their world was born with one of them. Thatch himself had one printed neatly across his shoulder blades in his lover Izo’s calligraphy. </p>
<p>It was the words themselves that were surprising. He’d only seen it once, back when he’d first joined the crew, gotten lost and accidentally walked in on his brother as he was getting into the shower, but the words had been distinctive enough to etch themselves on his memory.</p>
<p>	He was fairly sure that Marco, Oyaji and he himself were the only ones to know the words Marco had been marked with. The First Division Commander was pretty good about keeping them to himself, and he didn’t talk about them often. Probably in an attempt to protect himself from those terrible people in the world who liked to pretend to be soulmates with the wrong person. However Thatch got the feeling he might’ve given up on finding his soulmate, the same way he’d given up on ever meeting another phoenix, a long time ago.</p>
<p>	Which was extremely unfortunate in Thatch’s eyes, because if ever there was a person on their crew in need of a soulmate, an equal, it was Marco. He would just have to cross his fingers and hope for the best.</p>
<p>	A flash of color in the corner of his eye caught his attention, distracting him from his thoughts and he turned and began to grin, as a familiar fireball appeared in the sky. However it seemed bigger than usual, and was getting closer and closer to the ship. As it approached Thatch began to hear shouting, or more like loud cursing, cursing in a high feminine voice that made his eyes go wide, as he took a second glance at the fireball.</p>
<p>	What the hell!? Was that a person?!</p>
<p></p><div align="Center">
  <p>…~oO*Oo~…</p>
</div>Violetta cursed violently as she felt herself freefalling through the air. When she had told Fawkes she’d do anything to be free this certainly hadn’t been on the agenda. Unfortunately her broom, which she always carried with her in the form of a tiny charm on a necklace around her neck, wasn’t easy to take off, and she doubted she’d be able to get it before she hit the ground.<p>	She had to wonder what the hell the phoenix had been thinking as he literally dropped her out of the sky. She knew the fall wouldn’t kill her, Fawkes would never endanger her like that, and she could see him above her, flapping his wings to keep himself aloft as he watched her fall, a strangely smug look on his avian features.</p>
<p>	A small huff of air was forced out of her lungs on impact, and she realized with surprise that someone had caught her. It was enough of a shock that she immediately stopped cursing out the phoenix overhead to get her bearings.</p>
<p>	She was being held bridal style, cradled against someone’s chest, someone’s very male, very muscular, very bare chest, and that somehow she’d latched her arms around his neck. She took a minute to be grateful she didn’t wear glasses anymore, having corrected her eyesight during the war because glasses were a liability, as she slowly trailed her eyes up that chest to the worried face peering down at her.</p>
<p>	Upon seeing it, she had to admit, it was a very attractive face. Not classically handsome, like a lot of the more attractive purebloods in her world, but more rugged, and just a little bit scruffy with the five o’clock shadow he had going on his cheeks and chin. His eyes were heavy lidded and might’ve reminded her of Bellatrix if not for the intense teal blue color and the steady, but concerned look on his face.</p>
<p>	“Are you alright miss?” he asked carefully, his voice was a light baritone, with a rasp to it that she found extremely appealing, and she fought to keep the blush off her face, as the awareness of the position they were in sunk in.</p>
<p>	“I will be once I get my hands on that phoenix and figure out why the hell he decided to drop me,” she told him, proud of the way she’d managed to keep her voice relatively glib, despite being extremely embarrassed at the position she now found herself in.</p>
<p>	A sharp intake of breath had her glancing around, apparently Fawkes’ little stunt had, had an audience. Several men surrounded the two of them, and all of them seemed to be armed with some kind of weapon, though they looked to mostly be carrying swords and old fashioned pistols, which was exceedingly strange because she was pretty sure not even the purebloods, who were at least a hundred years behind muggle culture, still fought with swords despite it being practiced by their ancestors.</p>
<p>	Still despite their old fashioned looks, the presence of so many weapons had her tensing, her fingers drifting towards the invisible holster she kept attached to her arm that housed her trusty holly and phoenix feather wand. She really wasn’t in the best of positions here, and the only reason she wasn’t already attacking is because Fawkes would never have dropped her into a situation like this unprepared if she was going to be in danger.</p>
<p>	Out of habit her eyes scanned her surroundings. She appeared to be on some kind of wooden ship. The kind that reminded her of the one Durmstrang had brought for the Triwizard Tournament, made of wood with enormous white sails that billowed in the wind. She could smell saltwater in the air, which led her to believe she was on the ocean somewhere.</p>
<p>	Glancing around her eyes found the man who had made a noise before, and she had to double take. She had seen some very strange things since becoming part of the magical world, but even purebloods knew that if your hair was red so was your beard. This man had apparently decided he wanted to do something different because his beard was jet black, and his red hair was styled in the most gravity-defying pompadour she’d ever laid eyes on, and considering she’d seen Lavender Browns hairstyle creations during her Hogwarts years that was saying something.</p>
<p>	He was wearing a pristine white chef’s coat, and white pants with a yellow kerchief around his neck, and a sword strapped to his hip, which he had a hand on looking about as uncertain as she felt about whether he should attempt to draw it or not. He was also staring at her, which she supposed wasn’t all that surprising considering a phoenix had dropped her from the sky.</p>
<p>	Deciding to trust in Fawkes that there was no danger she allowed her body to relax and spoke again into the tense silence, “I apologize for intruding, and I hate to be a bother, but could you please tell me where I am. Fawkes didn’t tell me where we were going before he dropped me here a la phoenix express.”</p>
<p>	“Fawkes?” the redhead asked interestedly relaxing and letting go of the handle of his sword.</p>
<p>	“The phoenix,” she told him jerking her chin upward to the bird who was circling above them trilling in amusement, “and my so-called friend, though I’m reevaluating that thought considering how I landed here.”</p>
<p>	“Ah, well I’m Thatch,” the redhead told her carefully, “You’re currently on the Moby Dick in the New World, on the Grand Line, and the one holding on to you is Marco.”</p>
<p>	“I’m Violetta,” she returned with what she hoped was a friendly tone, before turning to the man holding her aloft, “Thank you very much for catching me, but I’m alright, so if you could just let me down…?”</p>
<p>	His heavy lidded eyes were actually wide with surprise, much more so than when she’d fallen out of the sky, which he’d taken pretty much in stride and she wondered what she could have said to shock him so much. She wriggled a bit in his hold indicating once more her desire to have him set her down, but his arms just tightened in response holding her closer.</p>
<p>	She tried really hard not to think about all those nice muscles as they pressed firmly into her side, but gave it up as a lost cause. The men in the wizarding world weren’t nearly as fit. Wizarding kind in general tended to be a lazy lot, with absolutely no interest in exercise. The closest they came was quidditch and maybe dueling, though that was limited to a small portion of society. It was a sad fact of life that many of Voldemort’s death eaters had only been as terrifying as they were because they were physically fit enough to keep fighting over long periods of time, outlasting their opponents.</p>
<p>	Still, as nice as those muscles were she really would like to be back on her feet. She felt more than a bit vulnerable in this position, and it was awkward to be clasped so tightly to a complete stranger. Unfortunately he didn’t seem all too keen on letting her go.</p>
<p>	“Um…?” she prompted wriggling again in a futile attempt to make him let go. He was apparently very strong, which shouldn’t be surprising considering the broad shoulders, and firm arms she felt cradled under her body. Giving up she cast a helpless look at the only one who’d spoken to her.</p>
<p>	“Just, uh, maybe give him a minute to process,” Thatch assured her, looking a bit concerned himself, though it was very clear that concern was all for the man holding her, “Marco’s had a lot of pretty women throwing themselves at him over the years, but I think one falling out of the sky was a bit much for him.”</p>
<p>	Violetta raised a skeptical brow, at this blatant lie considering moments before he’d been, alert enough to catch her and ask if she was alright.</p>
<p>	Thatch chuckled nervously, awkwardly rubbing the back of his head under her disbelieving look, apparently the redhead babbled a bit when he got nervous because what spilled out of his mouth came in such a rushed torrent it took her a minute to decipher it.</p>
<p>	“Actually your arrival was pretty cool though it was a wasted opportunity, I mean he could’ve said something great like “did it hurt when you fell from heaven?” or something equally epic, but no instead he just asked if you were okay, which was a waste of words if you ask me, speaking of which, they wouldn’t have happened to have been at all familiar would they…?”</p>
<p>	“Words?” she repeated slowly, and then her whole body stiffened, and she unconsciously let go of Marco’s neck in shock as her mind repeated the first words he’d said to her, ‘Are you alright miss?’</p>
<p>	Her letting go seemingly tipped his balance. She hadn’t realized he was perched on the railing of the deck, or she would’ve been a little more careful. Luckily his reflexes were pretty damn impressive, because he managed to slide both of them on to the deck and land them on their feet without tipping them backwards off the railing into the water below.</p>
<p>	However despite the tricky maneuver he still managed to keep his arms locked around her, though they were now around her waist. She had once more grabbed hold of him in the scramble for balance, and her hands were locked tightly on to the purple shirt he was wearing. Honestly it was probably a good thing he had ahold of her considering she felt as if she could be knocked over by a feather.</p>
<p>	According to Sirius she had been born with her words, trailing down her spine in a tidy, if a bit cramped scrawl. It wasn’t unusual, it just meant that her soulmate was apparently older than her, though how much older no one was able to tell, it could’ve been anywhere from a minute to a hundred years.</p>
<p>	Growing up with the Dursleys she’d dreamed of maybe finding her soulmate just as often as she’d dreamed of having a long lost family member come take her away, because her soulmate could take her away from her Aunt, Uncle and cousin just as surely as a relative could. </p>
<p>Locked in her lonely cupboard she’d dreamed she was Cinderella and that someday a prince would come and rescue her, sweeping her away from her terrible family. Maybe he would see her at school, or in the garden, or at the park and take in her rags and the bruises Dudley often left on her skin and be concerned. Or maybe he would come and save her during Vi hunting, as she desperately sought to get away from the gang, he’d sweep in, defeat them all and turn and ask. Or maybe he’d come across her as she hid in the library trying to keep away from home as best she could.</p>
<p>And admittedly she had heard them, her words, more than a few times, from concerned adults, teachers and the librarian, but none of them were the one. Still each time she heard them her hopes would rise, only to be squashed back down again, yet she hadn’t been about to give up.</p>
<p>	Getting her letter to Hogwarts had changed things. She was sure she was going to meet her soulmate there, but then her so-called adventures had started and she was more focused on staying alive than on finding her soulmate. It didn’t help that she was suddenly very famous, all of a sudden people were coming out of the woodwork trying to find out her words and if they were her soulmate. She’d nearly been overwhelmed by the crush of people in Diagon Alley more than once all hoping to say her words.</p>
<p>	Luckily it seemed that those who would later manipulate her hadn’t actually wanted her to find her soulmate otherwise they probably would have sent her someone and had them say her words and give her a false positive. Instead they’d cautioned her not to believe right away, to always check and double check, it should be your handwriting, they’d remind her, and it has to be the first thing they ever say to you. As if she didn’t already know. Still she did keep a wary eye out, and was glad that she had, she couldn’t imagine the disaster a false positive would’ve been, she had been confused enough throughout her time at Hogwarts without someone pretending to be her soulmate.</p>
<p>	Unfortunately all her encounters with Voldemort quickly led her to realize that she couldn’t spend her time waiting around for someone else to save her. Doing so would only get her killed. She had to be strong enough to rescue herself and others if it came down to it. Plus if Voldemort ever discovered who her soulmate was, he’d hunt them down too, and more than likely try to use them as leverage against her, which meant she had to be strong enough to protect them too.</p>
<p>	To that end she’d focused the bulk of her attention on the practical classes, Charms, Transfiguration, and especially DADA, the classes that would give her a tangible advantage against Voldemort. It drove Hermione completely up the wall that she didn’t care a whit for History of Magic, Astronomy or Potions, but frankly she hadn’t cared. </p>
<p>While you could learn fighting tactics from History Binns certainly wasn’t teaching them anything, knowing about the stars and planetary alignments would do absolutely nothing for you during a fight, and you couldn’t exactly brew potions mid-duel. Sure they could be useful if you prepared them ahead of time, and sure they could heal injuries afterwards and do all kinds of interesting things, but experience had taught her that Voldemort always attacked her when she was at her least prepared, and you could always make healing potions later. Plus most emergency first aid was done with spells, which she had taken the time to learn via Madam Pomfrey, not that Hermione had cared.</p>
<p>However the war had proven to her that the path she’d chosen was the right one. She was the best dueler on the side of the Light, better even than Kingsley who had been one of the top aurors at the Ministry before it had fallen. This was likely because of her access to the Black Library, her quick and varied spell work, and her ability to keep going for long periods of time thanks to an exacting fitness regimen.</p>
<p>She liked to think she’d become a self-rescuing princess, and even during the war she’d still dreamed of finding her soulmate, though this time her daydreams were of the two of them fighting side-by-side or even of her rescuing them instead. She had even heard her words a couple of times, mostly from their allies who’d come to aid in the fight from France or Germany or Spain, people who didn’t recognize her on sight, but none of them were a match, though a couple had tried to convince her they were once they figured out who she was, in the end none of them had the right corresponding words or handwriting.</p>
<p>After the war ended and the rebuilding began, those dreams had fallen a bit to the wayside, especially when she started teaching at Hogwarts because she knew she’d never meet her soulmate there. He was older than her after all and the only older males she interacted with while she was teaching were her fellow professors.</p>
<p>She’d just been thinking that maybe she needed some kind of sabbatical, to get her out and meeting people again, when the notice for her hearing had come with the morning owl post. After, well, she’d pretty much resigned herself to never meeting them, confined as she was to the grounds of the castle. </p>
<p>Thus when he’d said them to her they hadn’t really registered, especially since she’d been distracted by his muscles and his eyes, and the fact that Fawkes had dropped her out of the sky.</p>
<p>	“You said? I mean those were… Did I say?” she managed to squeak staring up at him unable to help the hope in her voice.</p>
<p></p><div align="Center">
  <p>…~oO*Oo~…</p>
</div>Marco stared down at the small woman in his arms, hypnotized by the color of her glowing emerald gaze, as she stared up at him with hopeful eyes. He was so caught up in them that it took him a minute to process the question. He went to speak, but the words didn’t want to come and he had to clear his throat like an idiot to get them past his suddenly dry mouth.<p>	“Yeah, yes, those were, those were mine,” he told her. He could still feel his heart beating thunderously against his ribs, as if reminding him of its presence, it was a grounding feeling, one that he had used to focus on to keep from floating away, awash in a sea of thought and emotion. It had been that way since she had first spoken his words to him. The words he’d almost given up ever hearing.</p>
<p>	Honestly he was still feeling a bit dazed with disbelief, because she was here, here in his arms, a solid presence, a tangible weight, and so very real. Before that phoenix had appeared a week ago he had given up on ever meeting his soulmate, it had been over forty years with no sign of her or a phoenix that might lead him to her. </p>
<p>	Then the fiery bird had appeared literally on top of them and when he’d confirmed that the avian was in fact a phoenix he’d felt the first stirring of hope in over a decade. Still he’d gone so long without his soulmate that he desperately tried to reign in the feeling, afraid of the devastation that would follow if he allowed himself to hope and was disappointed. The disappearance of the red and gold avian had proved to him that his attempt had been in vain. </p>
<p>	He’d been just as devastated as he’d suspected he would be. He tried to tell himself that it didn’t matter, that he had Oyaji, and his brothers and that was enough, and in a sense it was. He wouldn’t die just because he wouldn’t meet them, he could still continue on just as he had been doing for the good majority of his life now. Soul mates weren’t the be all end all, but it would’ve been nice.</p>
<p>	Nice to have someone to talk to, someone to bounce ideas off of, someone to hold, to touch, to kiss, to love. Someone who was his and his alone. Someone who would see him as an equal, as a partner. Someone to share his bed, his life, his forever after with.</p>
<p>	That’s what a soulmate was supposed to be. Oh he knew it wasn’t all sunshine and daisies, that even soulmates fought and hurt one another sometimes, Thatch and Izo were a prime example of that, but for the most part things still tended to work out. A soulmate was supposed to be the one person you could always rely on, who would always be there and he wanted that, he wanted it so badly it ached sometimes, especially when he saw his crew mates, his brothers and his Oyaji all aging around him, knowing that someday unless he was killed (which was nearly impossible with his Devil Fruit) he was going to be left behind by all of them.</p>
<p>	Oh he was still aging, of that he was sure, but it was an extremely slow process. The fact of the matter was he was over sixty and could still pass as twenty-five. A part of him had hoped, that somehow, someway his soulmate would also be aging slower than normal, so he could at least have one person who wouldn’t be taken from him. The fact that his soulmate apparently knew a phoenix had bolstered his hopes over the years, that is until they’d failed to appear.</p>
<p>	His crew seemed to understand, and he knew Thatch at least suspected his feelings on the matter. He had been surprised when they’d offered to stick around to see if the phoenix returned, despite knowing they’d have to survive for a while on meager rations if they lingered. He’d been really grateful and filled with affection for his family as not a single person complained about waiting around a bit.</p>
<p>	Which was why he had been sure that even if the phoenix didn’t appear again he’d still be okay. He had the most amazing family ever, and he really didn’t need more, but he was a pirate and selfish by nature, so despite his loving family it didn’t stop him from wanting, and hoping for more.</p>
<p>	“Would you mind showing me?” she asked quietly a nervous hand pushing her wild black hair out of her face, and redirecting his attentions away from his thoughts, “The mark that is?”</p>
<p>	“I, yeah of course,” he told her feeling a bit like an idiot, and wishing he could be a little more eloquent. </p>
<p>	Reluctantly he released his grip on her, his hands falling to his sash and fumbling with the knot, his hands shaking slightly from the adrenalin. Sliding it away from his hips then hooking his fingers in the band of his low riding pants, pulling it down a bit to reveal the words set low between the V of his hipbones. The handwriting was an untidy, hurried scrawl that read clearly, ‘I will be once I get my hands on that phoenix and figure out why the hell he decided to drop me’.</p>
<p>	He sucked in a sharp breath of surprise as her dainty fingers reached out to dance lightly over the words, which were slightly raised on his skin, the way all soul marks were, a bit like a scar, tracing them lightly with a calloused finger tip. Heat burned through him at her touch and he tried not to think about where else he’d like to see that small hand choosing instead to focus on the awe on her face.</p>
<p>	She glanced up at him and smiled in a way that stole the air from his lungs, it was a smile filled with relief, and hope and joy and it was one of the most beautiful things he’d ever seen in his long life. She was probably the most beautiful thing if he was being honest.</p>
<p>	He was probably a bit biased in that respect, she was his soulmate after all, but even knowing that he knew others would think she was beautiful too. Her eyes were the most luminescent beautiful shade of green he’d ever come across, and considering all his years on the Grand Line that was saying something.</p>
<p>	It took a good long while to get past the eyes, to even notice the second most prominent feature of her face, which was the most bizarre scar he’d ever seen. The closest he’d seen to it was when one of his idiot brothers had decided to try climbing the mast during a storm and been struck by lightning. The main branch started on her forehead and curled over both eyebrows and down one cheek to her neck with little textured branches that radiated from that main branch across her face, giving the skin there a very interesting texture. Under the scar her features were petite and sweetly feminine, small nose, pink pouty lips and cheekbones that were just a tad too sharp.</p>
<p>	Her hair was pinned back, or at least it had been, but the fall she’d taken and its own wild nature had it springing free of its confinement in a wild riot of curls and waves that tumbled down her back, her skin was pale, perhaps a little too pale, but the rosy tint to her cheeks made up for it.</p>
<p>Her figure was more lithe than most of the women he’d seen over the years, with gentle curves, her figure more elfin than buxom. It wasn’t his usual type but it was extremely appealing nonetheless.</p>
<p>	“Would you like to see mine?” She questioned softly into the silence between them, finished tracing his mark, perhaps feeling as he did that this was an extremely intimate moment between the two of them, one that he’d remember forever. He nodded, unwilling to break the quiet moment, and watched mesmerized as she began to pull her clothing off.</p>
<p>	First came the strange dark green, nearly black over robe, made of some kind of silk, if the way it shone slightly was any indication, next was a strange looking vest made of some kind of reptile skin, and finally the soft undershirt she was wearing underneath, leaving her in only a black lace bra, he only caught a glimpse of it though as she crossed her arms across her chest and turned her back to him, sweeping her dark hair over one shoulder so he could get a good look at her back.</p>
<p>	His words were written vertically, marching down her spine in the same precise writing he used in all the ships reports, and despite the mediocrity of them the handwriting was unmistakable. He reached out and ran his finger gently down her spine, feeling the texture of his words on her beneath his finger, and smirking slightly as he saw the goosebumps he raised on her arms, and felt the slight shiver of her skin.</p>
<p>	He was a bit awed by the words, not that he’d really needed the confirmation, the words said to him were pretty distinct after all, and he really doubted anyone else would ever say them to him again. Still seeing the black marks against her pale skin was like nothing else he’d ever experienced.</p>
<p>	He knew he was a selfish man by nature, but the strength of the possessive feeling as he stared at the words inked on her took him by surprise. She was his, his and only his.</p>
<p>	Giving into the feeling he reached out and pulled her backwards into his arms, burying his face into the bare skin of her neck and just breathing her in. She squeaked in surprise, but didn’t pull away, instead wrapping her arms over his, reinforcing his hold on her. He hummed softly in contentment, memorizing her scent, feeling her soft skin beneath his fingers. He was just beginning to contemplate turning her in his arms to see if she’d let him taste her too, when a voice broke in.</p>
<p>	“Umm I hate to interrupt your moment and everything, but I’d really like to turn around now, and I don’t want to see anything that will have you taking my head off later,” Thatch informed him, and Marco jerked in surprise.</p>
<p>	He’d completely forgotten about Thatch and his other brothers, who’d been sharing the deck with him when his soulmate had fallen from the sky. Glancing around he noted that the area had apparently been vacated while he was preoccupied.</p>
<p>	“Where is everyone ~yoi?” he asked confused. He was more than a little surprised his brothers hadn’t all stayed to gawk at them, the downfall of being brothers with nosy pirates.</p>
<p>	“I made them leave, about the same time she asked to see your soulmark,” Thatch admitted refusing to turn from where he had his back to them, “Didn’t want them intruding on something private.”</p>
<p>	“Thank you,” she voiced before he could, releasing her grip on him, and peeling his arms away from her, he let her, reluctantly, “Give me a moment, I’ll let you know when we’re decent again.”</p>
<p>	Bereft of her presence in his arms, and wanting to give her some privacy to redress, Marco turned his attention to re-knotting the sash at his waist. He only looked up again when she told Thatch he could turn around.</p>
<p>	Glancing around he saw she was standing fairly close to him, and apparently she’d decided against putting the strange over robe back on, instead bundling it into her arms. A soft warbling song filled the air, and he was surprised to see the red and gold bird who’d started everything gliding down, coming to rest on one of his soulmate’s thin shoulders.</p>
<p>	“Fawkes!” she exclaimed in surprise, reaching out and running a gentle hand through his feathers, “Fawkes did you know?”</p>
<p>	The other bird made a cooing, trilling sound, that even Thatch could probably tell was extremely smug, and his soulmate laughed, the sound tinged with surprise and slight hysteria that had him turning towards her in concern.</p>
<p>	“Seriously? You found my soulmate for me? Is that where you were? All that time? Looking for him?” she asked and the crimson and gold bird chirped and warbled, looking very pleased with itself.</p>
<p>	He watched as she nuzzled her face against the birds’ talking so quietly even he, with his enhanced Zoan hearing couldn’t make it out. The phoenix, evidently called Fawkes, gently ran his beak through her hair, an extremely affectionate gesture, before pausing and meeting Marco’s eyes. The message in those extremely intelligent eyes was clear, if he messed up Fawkes didn’t care that he was a fellow phoenix or virtually indestructible, he would pay the price.</p>
<p>	He nodded to show he got the message, and reached out carefully, to take her hand in his. She glanced up at him, eyes wide with surprise, but didn’t hesitate to interlock her fingers with his.</p>
<p>	“So I may have managed to stop the rampaging hoard of people who wanted to meet and interrogate the strange woman the phoenix dropped out of the sky,” Thatch told him watching the two of them with interested eyes, “But it required telling Oyaji what had happened. He’s waiting in the meeting room with the other Division Commanders for the two of you.”</p>
<p>	Marco nodded, glad that Thatch had already let Oyaji know, and that they were taking steps to ensure his new soulmate wouldn’t be overwhelmed by too many of his brothers all at once.</p>
<p>	“Are you up to meeting Oyaji and the others?” he asked her, not wanting her to feel like she was being forced into anything, or that decisions were being made without her knowledge or consent, “If not they can probably wait a bit, but not for too long.”</p>
<p>	“I suppose that should be fine,” she mused a slight frown on her face, “But who exactly is this Oyaji?”</p>
<p>	Marco traded surprised glances with Thatch, pretty much everyone knew that Whitebeard’s crew all called their captain Oyaji. Unless she thought she was somewhere else? Technically speaking the flag wasn’t actually visible from the angle of the deck they were at.</p>
<p>	“Oyaji is our captain, Captain Edward Newgate, but everyone calls him Whitebeard,” Marco explained carefully, wondering if they were already hitting the first bump in their relationship.</p>
<p>	“Whitebeard?” she repeated still frowning, and he took a moment to note that her voice had a strange lilting accent the like of which he’d never heard before, though he did find it very attractive, “What like that pirate, er what was his name? Blackbeard?”</p>
<p>	He cast a helpless look at Thatch who held up his hands and shrugged a baffled look on his face. It wasn’t very often they ran into someone who hadn’t heard of their Oyaji these days he could count the number of times that’d happened in the last decade on one hand and still have fingers left over.</p>
<p>	“Maybe?” he answered finally, “I’ve never seen or met anyone calling themselves Blackbeard, but Oyaji is a pirate, we all are. We’re actually called the Whitebeard pirates.”</p>
<p>	“You’re a pirate?” she asked clearly caught off guard, “Really?”</p>
<p>	“I am,” he told her firmly, bracing himself for some kind of storm, it looked like maybe his soulmate was a civilian and they didn’t tend to take well to pirates, especially if they were from outside the Grand Line, which was looking more and more likely in her case.</p>
<p>	Still he wasn’t ashamed of what he was, and he knew their crew wasn’t like typical pirates, he just had to keep her calm enough to explain that in such a way that she’d hopefully accept it.</p>
<p>	“I see,” she replied her eyes narrowing as she studied his face carefully, “And do you or your crew regularly rape, plunder, kidnap, terrorize, torture or kill innocent people? The ones who’ve done nothing against you and yours and who don’t attack first?”</p>
<p>	“What?” Marco questioned caught off guard by the extremely blunt question, “No! Of course not!”</p>
<p>	She took a moment longer, apparently trying to decide if she believed him or not before nodded, “Well alright then.”</p>
<p>	“Alright then?” Thatch repeated, sounding as completely baffled as Marco felt, “You mean that’s it? No freaking out, no more questions, no screaming, nothing?”</p>
<p>	“I could maybe manage a small scream if you like?” she offered apparently amused by Thatch’s confusion, “Though I’d prefer not to. And I do have more questions, a lot more questions, who doesn’t when they first meet their soulmate? But they can wait, there’s nothing I’m too concerned about.”</p>
<p>	“You’re not afraid then or disgusted?” Marco asked curiously, though he felt he already knew the answer.</p>
<p>	“Should I be?” she countered meeting his eyes steadily. </p>
<p>	“I will never purposely hurt you physically or emotionally, and I will protect you to the best of my abilities. I’m not ashamed of what I am or the things I’ve done, but I have killed people, done disgusting things that no ordinary man would dream of doing to protect my crew, my family and I don’t regret it,” he told her finally, after careful consideration.</p>
<p>	“Then I guess that makes two of us,” she told him with a wry, sad smile, “Though there are some things I regret, a lot of things actually, but that’s really not something we should probably get into right now.”</p>
<p>	“You’ve killed people?” Thatch asked incredulously, and Marco shot him a look of annoyance, though he could see why he was surprised. She was a tiny thing, only coming up to just under his chin, and while her lithe form was decently muscled it was nothing too impressive. Plus she didn’t give off the dangerous air most experienced pirates did, and her haki presence was on the lower end of the scale. Still Thatch should know better than to judge, after all in this part of the Grand Line it wouldn’t be unheard of for her to be a Devil Fruit user, and really if he thought about it, you didn’t really need to be physically strong to kill someone.</p>
<p>	“Yes,” she said flatly, clearly unimpressed by the question, “I have. It’s not something I’m necessarily proud of, but it is something I’ve done.”</p>
<p>	Thatch subsided apparently cowed, and feeling more than a bit guilty if Marco was reading the looks he was shooting the two of them correctly.</p>
<p>	“Thatch!” A new voice called out from one of the lower decks, “Have you gotten them yet? Oyaji and the others are waiting!”</p>
<p>	“We’re coming!” Thatch called down to his soulmate Izo, then turned to Marco and his soulmate, “We are, aren’t we?”</p>
<p>	Marco rolled his eyes at him, and turned to Violetta, who nodded, tightening her grip on his hand and gesturing for him to lead the way. Unfortunately climbing down the lower decks meant he had to release his hold on her temporarily. He jumped down and landed lightly on his feet, turning to offer to catch his soulmate only to see her gliding down with the help of the phoenix who set her gently down on the deck before settling back in on her shoulder.</p>
<p>	“That was impressive,” Izo noted a single eyebrow raised in surprise as he took in Marco’s soulmate and the familiar phoenix settled on her shoulder.</p>
<p>	“Isn’t he just?” Violetta asked clear fondness in her voice as she gently stroked Fawkes’ head, “Fawkes here can lift several times his own body weight.”</p>
<p>	“I’m Izo,” the sixteenth division commander offered holding his hand to shake, and Marco could see his most feminine brother watching his soulmate carefully.</p>
<p>	“Violetta,” she offered accepting the hand with ease, “Call me Vi though, Violetta is a bit presumptuous for my tastes. Forgive me for asking Izo, but would you prefer to be addressed as he or she? It’s a bit rude I know but I’d rather ask than accidently choose the wrong one.”</p>
<p>	“He,” Izo answered with a nod of approval at Marco, who knew if she had assumed and gotten it wrong Izo would have taken a long time to forgive her, he still hadn’t quite forgiven Thatch and he was his soulmate, “I just cross dress I have no actual desire to be female, I simply enjoy women’s clothing.”</p>
<p>	“Good to know,” Violetta returned seriously, “Would you perhaps be willing to come out shopping with me sometime then? I have to admit I’m rather terrible at choosing my own clothes.”</p>
<p>	“Of course!” Izo assured her immediately, completely won over at the mention of one of his favorite activities, “I’d love to!”</p>
<p>	“It will have to wait until we land,” Marco intervened hoping against hope his soulmate knew just what exactly she was getting herself into, “For now though you said Oyaji and the others were waiting?”</p>
<p>	Izo nodded seriously, immediately back in business mode, “They are, right this way.”</p>
<p></p><div align="Center">
  <p>…~oO*Oo~…</p>
</div>Whitebeard watched his sons as they held quiet conversations amongst themselves, as the information about Marco finally finding his soulmate spread. He could see most of them were happy for their brother, eager to meet whoever it was fate had decided was Marco’s better half, but also a little concerned. After all more than one person had left the crew after finding their soulmate, and losing Marco would be devastating.<p>	He wasn’t actually worried at all. He knew Marco wouldn’t leave the crew without an extremely serious reason, not that finding his soulmate wasn’t serious, but Newgate rather thought that if this woman really was Marco’s soulmate, she would recognize, the way that he had, that the sea called to Marco, as strong as any siren. As a soulmate he was pretty sure she would realize that taking him away from the sea, and the crew he called family would make him unhappy.</p>
<p>	No, it was far more likely that Marco would be trying to convince her to stay here, on the Moby with him. It was an option that all of the soulmates of his sons were offered, though very few ever took them up on the offer. Most chose to live on a specific, and extremely protected island at the heart of his territory instead, where their safety was pretty much a guarantee.</p>
<p>	Only a handful so far had chosen to stay aboard the Moby, and they were Izo, who he wasn’t sure counted as Izo had been a fighter and a pirate long before meeting Thatch, Jozu’s soulmate, Ria and Vista’s soulmate Hana, both of whom were among the nurses and doctors aboard the ship.</p>
<p>	Still he hoped for Marco’s sake that the woman would choose to stay. Of the crew he had left, the ones who hadn’t retired to that safe island, Marco was the longest standing member, and the one he was arguably closest to. </p>
<p>	Thus he knew that Marco had given up hope of even finding his soulmate before, but whilst Marco had given up on himself, Newgate had not. He had hoped for his oldest son’s sake that he would find them and that they would in turn ease his loneliness and gift him with the support he craved. </p>
<p>	It wasn’t that Marco didn’t have support, people to talk to or turn to with his problems, fears and doubts, in fact he couldn’t think of a single person who wouldn’t be honored to have Marco confide in them. The problem was Marco didn’t feel that he could. He didn’t want his brothers to see him as anything other than strong and unshakable, believing perhaps rightly, perhaps not, that it would lessen their faith in him both as Commander and as Newgate’s right hand. He was the “oldest” brother after all and many of his other sons viewed him the same way they viewed Newgate himself, as somehow invincible.</p>
<p>	However he knew that was far from the truth. Marco had his moments just like everyone else, he just hid them better. The only one able to call him out on it seemed to be Newgate himself, though Thatch did sometimes manage to weasel his way in as well.</p>
<p>	Unfortunately while Thatch did his best, his insights came only rarely thanks to Marco being nearly constantly on guard, and while Newgate knew his First Division Commander inside and out, and did his best to aid him where he could, he also had over a thousand other sons to look after, which meant Marco didn’t get the attention he needed or deserved. In fact he probably got less than his fair share, considering how self-contained and self-sufficient he was.</p>
<p>	Which was why he was hoping she could be convinced to stay, to offer up the support Marco needed, and in return Newgate and his sons would give her anything she needed. It was the least they could do for the soulmate of his First Division Commander, the least he could do for any of his sons’ soulmates really.</p>
<p>	The room suddenly went quiet and he straightened himself up in his chair as the door opened, Izo and Thatch slipped in first, taking up their respective chairs around the large table Newgate liked to use for these kinds of meetings, leaving only Marco’s chair, the one to his immediate right, open.</p>
<p>	His first impression as she edged in the door behind Thatch, was that she was a tiny little thing. Sure a lot of his children were tiny compared to him, even Marco himself, but she would barely come up over his knee if he was standing, and she was slender besides.</p>
<p>	He watched as her eyes darted around the room, taking in the faces of each of his commanders, her eyebrows climbing higher with each new face before settling on him. Those bright green eyes of hers were nearly unnerving in their intensity, and the scar on her face was a testament to the fact that this was a fighter. </p>
<p>	His instincts, which had never failed him before, told him that if this soulmate chose to stay with them, she would insist on fighting on the front lines, there would be no nursing for her. It was in the way she walked, the way she moved, and the way she catalogued each Division Commander, taking in their weaponry before settling on the biggest threat, both literally and figuratively, in the room, him.</p>
<p>	Unbidden his lips twitched up in an amused smile, Marco had definitely landed himself an interesting one. He watched her as she studied him, wondering what she was thinking and waiting for her to make the first move in the hushed silence of the room.</p>
<p>	“Are you Whitebeard then?” she asked finally, her lilting voice nearly deafening in the silence of the room.</p>
<p>	“My name is Edward Newgate, but most on these seas know me as Whitebeard yes, and you are?” he prompted interested.</p>
<p>	“I’m called Violetta, Violetta Janine Potter,” she informed him and it took a moment for him to recognize the resigned anticipatory look on her face, it was a feeling he’d often felt himself when expecting to be recognized, but not particularly caring to.</p>
<p>	“I’ve never heard of you,” he told her bluntly, wondering if it was ego or something else that put that look on her face.</p>
<p>	“Funny, up until fifteen minutes ago I’d never heard of you either,” she countered just as blunt as he was, apparently uncaring about the sucked in breaths of astonishment from around the table. Whitebeard could feel his lips twitching in unbidden amusement, if nothing else, she was brave, he had to give her that.</p>
<p>	“Which begs the question, just where the hell am I?” she asked before he had a chance to respond.</p>
<p>	“You’re in the New World girlie,” Jozu rumbled from his left, the first to recover from his surprise enough to answer, “On the Grand Line.”</p>
<p>“I’m in the who what where now?” she queried plainly confused, and garnering surprised looks from around the table.</p>
<p>	“Uh the New World,” Thatch tried again eyeing her with interest, “It’s what veterans of the Grand Line call its’ second half.”</p>
<p>	“I’m sorry,” Violetta apologized with a frown, “It seems I’m a bit behind in my geography, where exactly is the Grand Line?”</p>
<p>	Newgate frowned himself. The girl hadn’t even heard of the Grand Line? Just where exactly was she from then? Because even those living in the Blues were well aware of the Grand Line. His sons were just as concerned giving her strange looks and muttering amongst themselves.</p>
<p>	“Does someone have a world map,?” she asked concerned, a calculating look in her eyes as she took another glance around the room her eyes lingering on Jozu, Curiel, Atmos, Kingdew, Blenheim, Fossa, and himself, all of whom were much larger than her. He wondered if she was sizing them up as threats or thinking something else entirely.</p>
<p>	“I’ve got one,” Namur informed her gruffly, standing from his seat and fishing around in his pockets, before sliding it across the table at her. She caught it easily, but her eyes remained glued on his only fishman commander, and he could feel hackles rising around the room. </p>
<p>“What?!” Namur demanded annoyed and defensive, ready to be insulted yet again. Everyone in his crew were more than a little protective of their fishman brothers, knowing the prejudice they faced outside the ship. No one would take it well if she was rude to him Marco’s soulmate or no, and while it could cause all kinds of problems Whitebeard wasn’t too worried. After all she didn’t seem hostile just curious.</p>
<p>His suspicions were proven correct as she visibly shook herself, an ashamed look crossing her face for a brief moment before determination and apology took its place.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, you’d think that with this on my face I would know better than to stare so rudely at people,” she told him tracing her scar with a finger and grimacing, “I was just caught off guard, I’ve never met anyone who looked like you before, my apologies for my rudeness.”</p>
<p>Whitebeard could see his sons relaxing including Namur at her sincere apology, and felt approval, both for their actions and for hers.</p>
<p>“Never seen a fishman huh?” Namur asked genuinely interested.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think so, not unless fishman is synonymous for merfolk?” she asked and Namur shook his head in response.</p>
<p>“I thought so, besides the merfolk I met had a different language above water, and couldn’t survive on land,” she told him absently, completely missing the startled looks as she bent over the map.</p>
<p>More than ever Whitebeard was wondering where the hell she’d come from. A different language? Only the most isolated of islands spoke a language other than common, and even there they tended to speak both. Nowhere in the world that he knew of wouldn’t be able to understand what he said, and the ‘above water’ caveat was also something that sparked several questions. Plus all those he would classify as merfolk could definitely survive on land. Sure they couldn’t move around very well, but surviving wasn’t an issue.</p>
<p>He was kind of hoping she would be willing to point out wherever it was she came from on the map. It sounded like an interesting place, one that might be worth exploring. He’d been sailing these seas for a long time, and he was getting older, but he wasn’t the kind to pass up an adventure if it presented itself.</p>
<p>Interestingly the moment she actually got the map unfolded she seemed to freeze, her eyes going wide with shock, and the blood draining from her face. Whitebeard frowned in concern, watching as Marco took several steps forward, from where he’d been leaning on the door jam, his hand lightly brushing her shoulder in concern.</p>
<p>“Is everything alright ~yoi?” he asked softly, his voice carrying in the silence of the room.</p>
<p>Seeing him seemed to settle her slightly and she nodded slowly, “I think so, maybe, it’s just I don’t recognize this at all.”</p>
<p>Marco frowned looking over her shoulder to the map, his eyes skimming over it before turning back to hers, “This is accurate, actually it’s even more accurate than most maps available in the world right now.”</p>
<p>She searched his face for a moment, before turning to the bird who’d ridden into the room on her shoulder, “Fawkes, just what did you do?”</p>
<p>The bird hopped off her shoulder and on to the table his dark eyes on the map, moving carefully around it and inspecting it from all angles before turning back to her a making a strange trilling noise. From the look on his face Marco didn’t understand, but his soulmate certainly seemed to.</p>
<p>“I know I said anything Fawkes, but don’t you think this is a bit much?” she asked her voice tinged with just a hint of hysteria.</p>
<p>The phoenix retorted with a strange sound that reminded him of scolding, and that was apparently what it was because her shoulders dropped in response.</p>
<p>“You’re right of course you are,” she told him with a sigh, “But you realize that trying to explain this to them is going to make me sound completely barmy, off my rocker, loonier than a loon right?</p>
<p>Her avian friend made a very recognizable shrugging gesture, and she heaved a sigh pinching the bridge of her nose in exasperation, before taking a fortifying breath, squaring her shoulders and turning, not to Whitebeard, but to Marco. Never in his long life could he have guessed what she said next.</p>
<p>“Look, you’re probably going to think I’m mad as a hatter, but I swear on my life this is true. As far as I can tell I’m not actually from your world.”</p>
<p></p><div align="Center">
  <p>…~oO*Oo~…</p>
</div>Thatch listened with growing fascination as she began her explanation, describing things as best she could. Everything was so detailed, and magic sounded absolutely fascinating, the things she must’ve seen and done! It sounded amazing! He knew some of his brothers would be skeptical, but he believed her. After all, making up that kind of detail on the spot would be nearly impossible.<p>	When she finished he took a minute to glance around the room, to take in what everyone else was thinking. Most looked like they wanted to believe her, but were skeptical, a handful looked outright disbelieving, only he, Izo, and Namur looked to actually believe her.</p>
<p>	Interestingly she was only looking at Marco, apparently not caring about the rest of their opinions, and he certainly had to give her props for that. It wasn’t just anyone who could write off fifteen of sixteen of the Division Commanders and Oyaji himself in favor of Marco.</p>
<p>	Unfortunately Marco’s face was completely blank, and while Thatch recognized it as his ‘processing’ face, his soulmate was looking decidedly hurt. Luckily it seemed he wasn’t the only one to notice.</p>
<p>	“That’s quite the story girl,” Oyaji told her, his voice carefully neutral, drawing her attention away from Marco to give him a bit longer to process, “I would like to believe you, and I’ve found that often seeing is believing, would you care to demonstrate this magic of yours?”</p>
<p>	“What would you like to see?” she offered immediately, winning over a few of those who’d been on the fence with her confident reply.</p>
<p>	“That would depend on what exactly this magic of yours can do,” he told her thoughtfully.</p>
<p>	She laughed, though there was a bitter edge to it, “The question should be what it can’t do. I’ve seen magic perform the strangest things, turn teacups to mice and back, make pineapples dance across the table, levitate things, change their colors, even create objects out of thin air.”</p>
<p>	“I’ve also seen it, melt flesh from bone, force someone to regurgitate their own organs, drown someone in their own blood, light every single nerve on fire, force others to bend to the caster’s will, and even rip the soul from a body and obliterate it,” she informed them flatly, and Thatch was immediately reminded of the tone in which she’d told him she’d killed people before and shivered slightly, unable to help himself.</p>
<p>	“But then I’ve also seen miracles,” she told them her face softening slightly, “I’ve seen bones regrown, buildings repaired, children protected, natural disasters prevented, lives saved with magic that could never have been without it. So what would you like to see?”</p>
<p>	Thatch could see his Oyaji sizing her up, and that in that moment he had been won over, even before the demonstration began, because of the sheer emotion she exuded. Still it was probably best for the others’ sake to keep going so they could have proof, plus if he was honest with himself Thatch really wanted to see some magic.</p>
<p>	“I think maybe you should give us a show, nothing too destructive, and nothing that would injure anyone, but something convincing,” Oyaji told her, leaning back in his chair.</p>
<p>	She nodded a thoughtful look on her face, and Thatch was just beginning to wonder when exactly she was going to get started when she moved. The wooden stick appeared in her hand as if out of nowhere, twirling and dancing in her fingers.</p>
<p>	A swarm of bubbles flew from the point of the stick, and each one began to flash different colors as they swirled around the room, dancing around everyone. A flick of her wrist and all the bubbles were multicolored butterflies, flitting around the room with bright flashing wings, another flick and the butterflies were birds, each singing a different vocal part in a chorus, darting in and out of the people around the table, some even pausing to land on some of the commanders, holding his hand out Thatch gave a laugh as he discovered they were completely solid as one landed in his palm, gently pecking his fingers.</p>
<p>	Another signal and the birds flew up and out, flying in a circular pattern around the outskirts of the room, until they merged together, all turning blue, and the rushing of water filled his ears. He watched, awed and a little terrified as their circular table was suddenly the center of a hurricane, water roaring in his ears, the spray or droplets on his face a testament to how very real it all was.</p>
<p>	The water flickered and burst into flames, the heat making him draw back, as it formed a shape, that writhed and floated up into the air. The shape reared its serpentine head, and wings flared, as a dragon made of fire flew into a coiling spiral above the table, the heat in the room becoming nearly unbearable as is roiled toward the ceiling before bursting into a shower of sparks that rained down as flower petals.</p>
<p>	The sound of hoofbeats had him glancing over just in time to see an enormous silvery creature emerge from the tip of her stick. It was a buck, a huge one, with an impressive rack of antlers and it set off at a gallop around the table, the closer it got to him the warmer and safer he felt.</p>
<p>	He was surprised as the phoenix, which had up to that point been forgotten at its spot on the table, burst into song. The effect of which, combined with the glowing buck could only be described as euphoria. As the last of the notes faded away the buck turned to the room and opened its mouth.</p>
<p>	Thatch jerked in surprise as a very familiar voice emerged from within, it was Violetta’s, “Do you believe me now?”</p>
<p>	Glancing around the room he noted that all of them, including Oyaji had some form of shock and awe on their faces. Admittedly Oyaji’s was only a single raised eyebrow of surprise, but considering it was Oyaji that was a whole hell of a lot. Thatch himself, now that the shock was wearing off could feel giddiness bubbling in his chest.</p>
<p>	He knew later they’d all have to have a sit down and discuss the specifics of just what all she could do. Knew his brothers were probably already thinking of the advantages she could provide them, but all he could think to say at the moment was, “That was amazing!”</p>
<p></p><div align="Center">
  <p>…~oO*Oo~…</p>
</div>“Thanks,” Violetta told him with an amused smile, glad he’d at least enjoyed the show. A part of her though was wondering if maybe she should’ve kept her abilities to herself, because on the faces around the room she could see the kind of calculation that made her skin crawl.<p>	“Can you show me more?” he asked eagerly, practically bouncing in his seat, “What else can you do? Are all people in your world like you? What was that deer thing?”</p>
<p>The words were a torrent, and she was relieved to see at least one of them was just plain awed by magic, the way she had been when she first set foot into Diagon Alley. The others, not so much, and she made note out of the corner of her eye, which ones she would have to watch out for.</p>
<p>She wanted to stay here, wanted to get to know her soulmate, and to be a part of something, but not at the expense of her freedom. Not if it meant she was going to be used again. Not even for her soulmate.</p>
<p>A hand on her arm interrupted her thoughts, and she was surprised to find herself pulled into a warm embrace tucked gently under Marco’s chin. The Dursley’s had so starved her for affection growing up that most times she didn’t know how to react when it was offered.</p>
<p>Still her arms found their way around his waist, clutching the back of his jacket, and allowing herself a moment of comfort. He was warm, and he smelled like cinders, and sandalwood and something enticingly male. </p>
<p>“She won’t be doing anymore magic unless she wants to ~yoi,” Marco informed Thatch warningly, and even though she couldn’t see his face she knew he was leveling a stern glare, not just at the redhead but at the entire table, if the guilty faces were any indication.</p>
<p>“Marco is correct,” Whitebeard spoke up, his voice a low rumble as he cast a disappointed look at the men that she could see from the safety of Marco’s arms, “No one will be taking advantage of Violetta’s magic, not without permission, she is Marco’s soulmate, and your newest sister. We are the Whitebeard pirates, not the marines or the world nobles, we do not use our family members that way.”</p>
<p>The order settled over the room like a lead blanket hanging heavy in the air with the weight of promise and she could see the shame on the faces of more than one of the men, but she could feel nothing but relief, practically sagging in Marco’s arms as she held on to him for support.</p>
<p>“Are you alright ~yoi?” he asked softly in her ear.</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” she answered automatically, and she could feel his grunt of disbelief.</p>
<p>Heaving a sigh she decided he deserved a better explanation of her turbulent thoughts, “Back in my world, from the time I entered the magical community everyone expected something from me. It’s kind of a long story as to why, but suffice to say I was famous for surviving an attack as an infant and killing my attacker, despite the fact that it was probably my parents who were responsible. Seeing as they were dead, I got the fame for it.”</p>
<p>“When I was eleven it was discovered that the man who had attacked me, a terrorist who commanded the loyalty of a small army, was still alive. Worse, thanks to a corrupt justice system, some of his strongest followers were not only alive but free. From then on it somehow became my job to fight him off.”</p>
<p>“On top of that I was famous, and rich, and everyone and their mother seemed to want something from me, people would come up in the streets trying to touch my scar, a souvenir from surviving as an infant, or say words, everyone wanted a piece of the ‘savior’ it was stressful, and when word finally broke about his return to life, everyone wanted me to save them.”</p>
<p>“It felt like everyone wanted something from me, and all I wanted was to just be left alone. Meanwhile I thought I had friends, I thought I’d created a family for myself that I could count on to watch my back. I got strong for their sake, did things I could never take back to protect them. I couldn’t have cared less about wizarding world at that point, but I promised myself I would defeat the mad terrorist for their sake to keep them safe.”</p>
<p>“That was a mistake, in the end it turned out, once the final battle was over and the dust settled, my so-called friends and family had been using me the entire time. None of them actually expected me to walk out of that final battle alive, they expected me to die and take the terrorist down with me, a martyr for their cause,” she gave a tired sad laugh, “I was stupid and naïve. I thought they cared for me, no, I thought they loved me, but I was wrong.”</p>
<p>“After they didn’t know what to do with me, they were afraid, because I was strong, one of the strongest in the world. Behind my back they had a law passed and a magic barrier created with blood they stole from my veins as I slept that would see me locked in a castle, forced to train the next generation of soldiers for their army.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t get free. No matter what I tried I was stuck, there was nothing left to do. The only thing I had ever wanted, the freedom to live my life as I chose away from public ridicule, had been ripped away from me. I wanted to give up, I considered it, but then Fawkes showed up,” she felt Marco’s arms tighten around her, protective, solid and warm. </p>
<p>“Fawkes had been a friend and companion nearly since the beginning, and in the end he was the only one I could count on. He saved me. I told him I would do anything to be free, and the next thing I know he dropped me here, straight into your arms.”</p>
<p>She pushed herself out of his hold then so she could look at him properly. He was staring at her his teal blue eyes alight in a mixture of rage and pride and sorrow and other things she couldn’t identify, and despite the warm feelings that look inspired, there was still something that had to be said.</p>
<p>“So now I’m fine, better than fine because I found you, and you’re my soulmate, and if things work the way I desperately want them to work then everything will be okay, but I’m not going to lose my freedom again Marco, not for you, not for anyone. I won’t be trapped here and I won’t be used. I will slit my own throat first,” her words rang with finality and a hint of magic, it was a vow, as close to unbreakable as she could get without someone to bond her.</p>
<p>“Listen to me ~yoi,” Marco told her firmly his voice low and intense reaching up to cup her face in his large calloused hands, “I am a pirate because the one thing in the world I value most is freedom. The ability to live my life the way I choose.”</p>
<p>“I swear to you, I will never ever take that away from you, nor will I allow anyone else to do so ~yoi,” he told her intently, “I will <em>protect</em> you but more than that I will <em>support</em> you in anything you want to do. If that means finding a way back to your world so you can wreak bloody vengeance fine, if it means running off to an obscure island on your own and hiding away for the rest of your life fine, if it means rampaging through the Grand Line, starting your own pirate crew, setting out to explore the world fine. Just so long as you’re okay and you maybe stop by to visit me here sometimes…”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what I want to do yet,” she told him quietly, after he trailed off, “ I haven’t had a whole lot of time to think about it, and I don’t think I’ll be making a decision for a while, but for now at least I think I want to stay, right here with you, because one of the things I’ve always wanted was and is my soulmate. I want to know you. I want to be with you.”</p>
<p>“Anything you want ~yoi,” he promised her, running a gentle thumb over her cheek before allowing his hands to trace a path down her shoulders and arms to her hands.</p>
<p>“I want to believe you,” she admitted in a small voice, feeling guilty for her inability to trust him, because he was her soulmate, and she should be able to trust her soulmate above all others, but she’d been hurt, too deeply and too often for that.</p>
<p>“It’s all right,” he soothed gently running his hands up and down her arms, “It’s going to take time, that’s more than fair. You don’t know me. I don’t know you, but we’ll work at it I promise.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” she told him though her voice wobbled a bit, and he knew she was close to tears before she took a deep breath and steadied herself before repeating it more firmly, “Okay.”</p>
<p></p><div align="Center">
  <p>…~oO*Oo~…</p>
</div>Jozu grimaced as guilt curled sourly in his stomach watching Marco fight to earn his soulmate’s trust. He could tell that the two of them had a long road ahead of them, but looking at them he could see the fragile beginnings of something beautiful.<p>	He had the feeling that the two of them together could be something amazing, if they got the chance. The problem was going to be getting them that chance, especially given how delicate the situation was. </p>
<p>The fact of the matter was Marco’s soulmate for all her magical power and fierce demeanor was in a pretty delicate state emotionally right now, and who could blame her. He was sure there was more to the story, but from the short summary she’d given them it was obvious everyone she had ever known had tried to use her or hurt her, and then when they were done, they’d locked her away somewhere to be somewhat useful but mostly forgotten, like an unwanted tool stored in the attic only to be brought out when it served a purpose.</p>
<p>Guilt was eating him because his first thought, after digesting that her magic was real, was wondering how she could help fortify the ship, calculating how much she could add to their defensive power. He felt sick to his stomach as he realized his first thought had been just what everyone had been doing to her all her life, wondering how he could use her.</p>
<p>From the sick shame on several of the faces around the table he wasn’t the only one. Oyaji had been right to scold them, this was Marco’s soulmate, their newest sister. They should be treating her that way, instead of looking at her like she was a new weapon, tool, or toy, and he resolved to treat her that way. He couldn’t imagine what the two of them were going through right now, as they tried to find their footing.</p>
<p>His relationship with Ria had been much easier than this, a straightforward meeting at a coffeehouse, several trips to see her, and finally an agreement to come aboard the Moby Dick as one of the nurses. Sure they’d had their ups and downs, but nothing like this.</p>
<p>They were going to need support, and all of them, not just Marco were going to have to prove they were trustworthy, and it had to start now.</p>
<p>“I think,” he began slowly catching the attention of everyone in the room, including the two soulmates, “That we all need to promise right here, right now to keep our new sister’s abilities and origins a secret.”</p>
<p>	“They are her abilities after all, and it’s her secret to share or not, not ours, if she wants to tell people fine, but for now I think keeping quiet is the best idea,” Jozu announced taking in the reactions of the people around the table, “Because as well meaning as our brothers are there are a good number of them who would probably pester her for her abilities, and once word gets out of what she can do beyond this small circle, there’s a good chance the World Government will take an interest, which is not something I would wish on anyone let alone our new family member.”</p>
<p>	Heads were nodding around the table, muttered agreements filling the air even before he finished as he turned his attention to Violetta, “Is this alright with you.”</p>
<p>	She looked so surprised, to be asked her opinion, that it was like another knife to the gut, as he wondered briefly how many people had asked for her permission before making decisions about her life before. Probably not many judging from that look.</p>
<p>	“It’s a good idea,” she said finally, “I don’t know about your Government, but if it’s as corrupt as mine was then I’d like to stay off their radar for as long as possible.”</p>
<p>	Jozu nodded and he turned to glance at Oyaji who was giving him a proud smile.</p>
<p>“It’s done then, not a word of Violetta’s abilities leaves this room, or I will hear about it,” Whitebeard ordered putting the full weight of his authority behind the words.</p>
<p>His fellow Division Commanders all nodded, and he watched as Marco coaxed her around the table and into his lap when he took his customary spot at Oyaji’s right as slowly discussion turned to different matters, ones that didn’t revolve around Marco’s new soulmate, though they did make it a point to include her in the conversation, asking questions and opinions. She was well spoken, polite, and direct when need be, and every time she responded it was well thought out.</p>
<p>Once more he could see the beginnings of something beautiful between her and Marco. It was there in the glances they exchanged, the way they leaned into the others touch and in the quiet whispered discussions between the two of them before Marco would offer his own input on different matters.</p>
<p>Right now it was as fragile as glass, but he would protect it, until time and trust tempered it into something stronger than diamond. That was what family did after all.</p>
<p></p><div align="Center">
  <p>…~oO*Oo~…</p>
</div>The meeting only broke up when Thatch announced that he had to start on dinner unless everyone wanted to go hungry that night. Luckily because Fawkes the phoenix had returned relatively quickly they weren’t hurting for rations, and the group quickly dispersed, everyone going their different directions.<p>	Marco took hold of Violetta’s hand and carefully guided her out, leading her in the direction of one of the Moby’s smaller, lesser known decks, so that the two of them could discuss some things in privacy, something they hadn’t actually had yet. Luckily it seemed his intentions were clear to his brothers, and they glared warningly at the others, as Marco led her away, keeping them from following.</p>
<p>	Her hand felt so small and fragile in his that it was hard to remember how extremely dangerous she had proven herself to be. Magic, and the fact that his soulmate was apparently some kind of alien, was more than a little bit difficult to wrap his head around. Still it was part of her, and just for that he could accept it without too many questions.</p>
<p>	“Where are you taking me?” she asked curiously, as they ducked through a small gap in the rigging.</p>
<p>	“It’s one of the upper decks. It’s small and private. I figured we could go there and maybe talk without an audience, get to know one another better ~yoi,” he told her carefully, “Unless there’s something else you’d prefer?”</p>
<p>	“No, no talking sounds good,” she told him offering him a shy smile.</p>
<p>	Neither of them said anything else, as they scrambled up on to the hidden deck. He had been a little concerned she’d have trouble, but it turned out she was quite agile, and took to the rigging like a monkey took to trees.</p>
<p>	Seeing his impressed look she admitted, “I climbed a lot of trees growing up.”</p>
<p>	The darkly humorous look that accompanied that made him worry, because how the hell could climbing trees be a bad memory, and just how much had his soulmate suffered?</p>
<p>	Up on the deck he settled himself on to the sun-warmed planks, leaning against the rails and turned, watching as she settled in next to him. Not liking the distance, and with the impulse to keep his hands on her at all times in mind, he gently took hold of her legs, watching for a protest and seeing none, he lifted them into his lap so her shins were across his thighs.</p>
<p>	In response she leaned against the railings, wrapping one arm around them to keep her balance, and toed off her shoes, letting them fall to the deck with two soft plops, revealing extremely colorful socks on her feet.  He watched for a minute as a strange gold ball with wings in the design zoomed around its crimson background, wondering at how strange magic was.</p>
<p>	“So what were you hoping to talk about?” she asked, her face unreadable to his gaze, though he thought he saw hints of trepidation in her eyes.</p>
<p>	“I thought we could get to know one another,” he answered gently. He was glad the idea of having her here was sinking in, and his thoughts had returned to being practical, and more importantly coherent.</p>
<p>	“You know quite a bit about me already,” she told him with a sardonic smile on her lips.</p>
<p>	“No,” he replied firmly, “I know a little of your past, but that doesn’t mean I know you, and I’d like for you to get to know me as well.”</p>
<p>	“So what exactly were you thinking?” she seemed interested enough, which was a good sign.</p>
<p>	“I figured we’d just trade questions,” he shrugged, “Seems like a tried and true method, nothing too fancy.”</p>
<p>	“Alright, so we’ll just go back and forth one for one?” she clarified, and he nodded.</p>
<p>	“Would you like to go first ~yoi?” he offered.</p>
<p>	She watched him for a moment, taking a second to decide before asking, “Why did you decide to become a pirate?”</p>
<p>	“Starting off with the tough ones?” he asked amused. She just shrugged completely unapologetic. He liked that about her.</p>
<p>	“It’s both very complicated and very simple ~yoi,” he answered giving the question the thought it deserved, “I wanted to be free, free to live my life without fear and to do whatever I chose. In order to be strong enough to do that I had two options, pirate or marine, and the marines had far too many rules and regulations to feel like freedom to me.”</p>
<p>	“What’s your favorite color?” he asked into the silence that followed his answer.</p>
<p>	“My favorite color?” she repeated dubiously, obviously wondering why he’d followed up her tough question with one so shallow.</p>
<p>	“And why,” he tacked on, an amused smile on his lips.</p>
<p>	“Alright,” she said slowly still looking at him strangely but apparently deciding to humor him, “Red, not like in your face red, but more crimson, like Fawkes, the color as the sun sets and rises, as for why…. I don’t know, it’s warm I guess and bright.”</p>
<p>	“Why do you follow your Captain? Why not be captain yourself?” she asked determinedly.</p>
<p>	“I’m not much for leading ~yoi,” he told her with a shrug, then grimaced because it was the answer he’d been giving people for years, and while it was true it wasn’t the entirety of his reasoning, and she deserved honesty from him, “Or at least, I don’t like being the person who has to make the final call, the tough decisions. I’m not as charismatic as Oyaji is either, plus Oyaji has been my captain for decades now, there’s no one on this earth I’m closer or more loyal to.”</p>
<p>	“What’s your favorite flower?”</p>
<p>	“Lilies,” she answered immediately, “Crimson fire lilies to be exact. My mother was a redhead named Lily and they remind me of her. How old are you exactly?”</p>
<p>	Marco winced, he should’ve expected that one after he’d dropped the bit about decades, “I don’t suppose I could get away with just saying, older than you’d expect could I?”</p>
<p>	“Yeah I didn’t think so,” he murmured seeing the flat expression she was giving him, “Sixty-three.”</p>
<p>	She gaped at him, shock written all over her face as she slowly gave him a thorough once over, obviously looking for some kind of hint that he was telling the truth, though there was a skeptical expression on her face, and he decided he needed to explain, “My Devil Fruit ability means I age really slowly.”</p>
<p>	“I, suppose that’s good then, we’re well matched,” she told him a thoughtful look on her face, “Magic means all Witches and Wizards age slower than those without magic, and the stronger you are magically the slower you age.”</p>
<p>	“How old are you then?” he returned curiously.</p>
<p>	“Don’t you know you’re not supposed to ask a lady her age?” she asked a teasing light in her eyes.</p>
<p>	“You asked first ~yoi,” he pointed out reasonably, lips quirking in response to her amusement.</p>
<p>	“Yeah but you’re no lady,” she countered, “Or at least I didn’t think you were.”</p>
<p>“I assure you I am very much male ~yoi,” then gestured to his bare chest, “I thought that was obvious.”</p>
<p>“Well I mean you could just be very flat,” she teased lightly.</p>
<p>“You want more evidence?” he teased right back, hands going to his sash again.</p>
<p>“No, no, I believe you,” she told him flapping a hand at him, a slight pink tinge to her cheeks.</p>
<p>“So your age then?” he prompted amused.</p>
<p>“Alright, if you must know I’m thirty-two,” she admitted with a sigh. Looking her over he knew it wasn’t as startling as him being over sixty, but given her appearance he would have pegged her at twenty-three at the absolute oldest, closer to nineteen if he was honest, which probably should’ve made him feel like a cradle robber, but he couldn’t bring himself to care.</p>
<p>	“What’s a Devil Fruit?” she asked interestedly. He looked at her startled, and again reminded himself that she wasn’t from this world. There was a good chance a lot of things they had there, they didn’t have here and vice versa.</p>
<p>	“A Devil Fruit, is a fruit said to be created by the Devil himself, it grants whoever eats it some kind of special ability, but in return it takes away your ability to swim and makes you weak to seawater,” he explained, trying to explain it clearly, “There are three classifications of Devil Fruit, Zoan, which allows the user to turn into an animal form, logia which gives the user control over an element, and paramecia which has three subclasses, they either let you manipulate your body in some strange way, produce some sort of substance, or allow you to manipulate the environment.”</p>
<p>	“That seems really interesting, most of that I can do with my magic, but I’m sure some of it must be really amazing,” she told him, “The potential is near limitless! Though from what I remember from that map earlier, most of your world is ocean, so I could see why people choose not to do it if they find them. What’s your Devil Fruit power then?”</p>
<p>	“Ah-ah! It’s my turn ~yoi” he told her, amused by her enthusiasm. She gave him a slightly annoyed look, but then huffed a sigh amusement making her lips twitch and gestured for him to go ahead.</p>
<p>	“If you could visit some place in the world where would it be?” he asked.</p>
<p>	“This may sound silly to you,” she admitted a sheepish look on her face, “Especially considering how many your world must have, but I’ve always wanted to go to a place with an amazing beach, with warm sand and clear blue ocean. It’s funny because I actually grew up on an island, but never once was I allowed to visit the ocean. I’ve always wanted to though.”</p>
<p>	“Well, that should be an easy enough wish to fulfill at least,” Marco told her with an amused smile, though again he had to wonder what kind of life she’d lived, that phrasing ‘that I was allowed’ didn’t exactly reassure him. He kept those thoughts off his face though and smiled at her instead, “Though you’d be surprised I think about some of those islands you saw, especially in the Grand Line. And it isn’t silly. Despite not being able to swim I still enjoy the beach, it’s a great place to unwind.”</p>
<p>	“Alright so what is your Devil Fruit power?” she leaned forward in interest, bracing her hands on her thighs, green eyes shining intently.</p>
<p>	“I fall into the zoan category,” he hedged just to see the slightly annoyed look she shot him, encouraging him hurry the hell up, she was cute when she got riled, “But I’m a bit different from normal Zoans, normal zoans turn into normal animals like deer, cats, dogs, jungle animals etcetera, and thus they only receive powers like enhanced strength, speed and senses, which is why mine is different.”</p>
<p>	“I received all those things, but I also got something extra, as I said before I age slower, but that I think is a side effect of my power,” he explained drawing it out, “I can heal myself, of pretty much anything, and make myself impervious to certain types of attacks.”</p>
<p>	She frowned confused, “But I thought you said you were a zoan? The animal one right? Wouldn’t that be considered paramecia?”</p>
<p>	“I’m getting there, have some patience,” he told her then paused, and smirked at her, earning an extremely annoyed look in return. He jumped, startled as her fingers darted out and pinched him lightly in the side. It didn’t hurt, and even if it had it would’ve healed right away. He was kind of impressed by her daring though, not many would try something like that with him, and he found it refreshing.</p>
<p>	“What was that for ~yoi?” he teased lightly and was greeted with the sight of her pouting up at him.</p>
<p>	“You know why,” she accused, her lower lip jutting out slightly, and her eyes alight. He took in the expression and huffed a laugh, reaching out to tap one of his fingers on her protruding lower lip, earning a surprised and confused glance.</p>
<p>	“Cute ~yoi,” he explained, surprised but pleased to see her eyes widen and dart away to look at her lap and a flush rise into her cheeks.</p>
<p>	“I’m what they call a mythical zoan,” he explained to save her further embarrassment. He wasn’t going to push her too far just yet, not when they had just met, but he was enjoying this interaction with her, a lot, “A phoenix to be exact.”</p>
<p>	Her face jerked up from her lap so fast he was surprised she didn’t give herself whiplash, “A phoenix really? Like Fawkes? Can I see?”</p>
<p>	“That’s another question, in fact it was two extra ~yoi,” he pointed out, lips twitching in amusement as her eyes narrowed at him in annoyance.</p>
<p>	“I’ll answer, but I get three in return,” he informed her just to rile her a bit more. She simply raised a brow at him and gestured at him to get on with it.</p>
<p>	“Yes I’m a phoenix, I wouldn’t lie about it, it’s actually my epithet on my bounty poster Marco the Phoenix, real original I know,” he told her with a smirk, “And I will show you, not now, later when it’s dark, maybe after dinner.”</p>
<p>	Seeing her questioning look he told her, “I’ve been told it’s more impressive then, and as for like Fawkes, I don’t really know. I didn’t really get around to comparing our similarities and differences before he took off to get you, and I don’t think I understand him as well as you do, which I think is my first question for you. How come you understand him so well?”</p>
<p>	“It’s because he’s my familiar,,” she explained with a shrug, “Witches and Wizards can create a special bond with a singular magical animal so long as that animal is willing. The bond allows them to communicate more effectively and creates a very close relationship.”</p>
<p>	“So it can only happen with one animal?” he asked interested.</p>
<p>	“Only one at once, though if the familiar dies the witch or wizard can bond with another one though that’s pretty rare as the magic in a familiar bond is supposed to extend the lifespan of the animal to match the human,” she clarified, glancing overhead to where the firebird they were discussing was perched in the rigging.</p>
<p>	“So what kind of animals are these exactly?” he inquired lightly.</p>
<p>	“Oh anything and everything,” she told him a small smile touching her lips, “There are rarer ones like Fawkes and I knew someone who had a raven once, but the most common are magical versions of cats, dogs, toads, and owls.”</p>
<p>	“You had another familiar before Fawkes didn’t you ~yoi?” he prompted gently, seeing the tired, wistful look on her face.</p>
<p>	“It’s not your turn to ask a question,” she informed him, though it fell a little flat given the unhappy twist to her lips and way her hand was clenching and unclenching on the railings she was leaned against.</p>
<p>	“But yes, I did. Her name was Hedwig and she was the most beautiful snowy owl I’d ever seen. She was intelligent, extremely so even for a familiar, and brave and oh so loyal. When I wasn’t at school, during the summers she was my only companion,” she explained quietly her arms wrapping around her torso as if to protect herself from pain.</p>
<p>	“She was killed by that terrorist I told you about, because I was stupid and careless and even though it’s been nearly fifteen years now I still miss her,” she murmured looking out over the ocean.</p>
<p>	Marco grimaced in sympathy. As the First Division Commander he knew what it was like to lose a companion. He hadn’t meant to bring up more bad memories though, which was why he’d been keeping his questions light. Unfortunately it was starting to seem like his soulmate had more bad memories than good, which made his self-appointed task that much more difficult.</p>
<p>	Reaching out he tugged his soulmate closer and pulled her, unprotesting, into his lap, offering her physical comfort in lieu of opening his mouth and accidently treading on a landmine. She was stiff at first, but eventually relaxed, settling back against his chest and turning her head to press the side of her face against his bare chest.</p>
<p>	“It’s your turn to ask a question,” he prompted gently rubbing his hands up and down her arms, “You can even ask two if you like.”</p>
<p>	She huffed quietly in some small amusement and he counted that as a victory before asking, “What’s the tattoo?”</p>
<p>	“It’s a variation of Oyaji’s mark,” he explained easily, “Almost all of the Whitebeard pirates have some variation or another of the mark on them to show their loyalty. The Division Commanders all have theirs tattooed but a lot of the crew wear the mark on their clothing or as jewelry instead.”</p>
<p>	“Division Commanders,” she repeated reaching for his hands and twining his fingers with hers, “What are those exactly.”</p>
<p>	“Oyaji has over fifteen hundred people in his crew,” Marco explained lightly playing with her small hands, rubbing circles over the backs and toying with her slender fingers, “That’s far too many for one man to handle and keep track of. Thus he created the Divisions. Each Division has about one hundred people in it give or take, who report to the Division Commander and the Commanders all report to each other and to Oyaji. It helps keep things running more smoothly, and cuts down on the work Oyaji has to do, leaving him more time to just interact with his crew, rather than spend his days doing paperwork.”</p>
<p>	“Do you have any tattoos ~yoi?” he prompted.</p>
<p>	“None, other than scars the only mark on me is yours,” she told him. He hummed in approval, he kind of liked the idea of being the only one to mark her.</p>
<p>	“You said paperwork right? So pirates actually do paperwork?” she asked clearly confused.</p>
<p>	“Yes, we have to, someone has to keep track of everyone, make sure we have all the supplies we need, medicines, bandages, food, water, and booze! Plus we have to keep track of where we are and where we’re going and what supplies are best to get where, while also keeping an eye on our treasure levels to ensure we can fund ourselves because let me tell you it’s not cheap to keep everyone fed, and happy!” he told her firmly, the lecture spilling from his lips with the ease of long practice, “Not to mention the chores, like cooking, cleaning, doing laundry and scheduling the watch, all of which has to be coordinated and scheduled to make sure the ship is kept livable and running, it is our home after all.”</p>
<p>	She snorted in amusement, and he could feel himself flush, grateful that she couldn’t see him from where she was perched in his lap. He might’ve been just a little bit overzealous in his answer, but in his defense the lecture was usually for Thatch or some of the other less responsible Division Commanders who were whining and dragging their feet about doing the paperwork.</p>
<p>	“I’m glad you’re amused ~yoi,” he informed her dryly to keep face, “What’s your favorite food?”</p>
<p>	“Treacle tart!” she answered immediately, “It’s the most wonderful dessert in the world, and I adore it.”</p>
<p>	“I’ve never heard of that ~yoi,” he admitted.</p>
<p>	“You’ve never heard of it?” she demanded pulling her head away from his chest so she could stare up at him with wide horrified eyes, “Does that mean it doesn’t exist here?! That I can never have it again?”</p>
<p>	“I wouldn’t know,” he told her with an amused shrug, “You’d have to ask Thatch.”</p>
<p>	“Don’t think that I won’t,” she warned him, “To think a world without treacle tart! What kind of barbaric place is this?”</p>
<p>	“Is that your return question ~yoi?” he asked with a chuckle, “Because I’m not sure how to answer.”</p>
<p>	The look she gave him was very unimpressed and she huffed before settling back on to his chest, “No, it wasn’t, what do you do for fun? Besides paperwork.”</p>
<p>	“Haha ~yoi,” he said flatly an amused smirk on his lips at her cheek, “I like to read, and relax when I can. I also like to fly in my phoenix form.”</p>
<p>	“Flying is pretty amazing,” she confirmed a knowing in her voice that surprised him.</p>
<p>	“You’ve flown?” he asked surprised.</p>
<p>	“I’m counting that as your question and yes I’ve flown,” she told him sounding more than a bit smug, “I was one of the best flyers my school had ever seen. All Magicals can fly. Though most do it with the help of a broomstick. I like that method, but I can also free fly, which is more like hovering and floating around really than flying, and my Animagus form is capable of flight as well.”</p>
<p>	“I think I maybe understood one word in five of that~yoi,” he told her a little dazedly, “You fly with broomsticks? Seriously? And what the hell is an Animagus?”</p>
<p>	“I’m counting those as questions too,” she informed him with a faux superior sniff, “Yes we fly with broomsticks, they’re enchanted with layers upon layers of magic. I actually have mine with me, shrunken down as emergency transport see.”</p>
<p>	Marco watched in surprise as she pulled a chain out from under shirt and held a particular charm up in front of his face. He accepted the tiny thing, no bigger than his pinky nail, eying it curiously.</p>
<p>	“I’d have to un-shrink it to ride it of course, but that is a classic Firebolt broomstick, it’s an awesome ride, and can travel upwards of two hundred kilometers an hour,” she said enthusiastically, “They’ve made newer models since this one came out of course, that supposedly go faster and are better, but I’ve tried them and none of them compare to this one.”</p>
<p>	“As for being an Animagus, that’s an ability much like your Zoan devil fruit I think, to turn into one specific animal at will,” she explained accepting the broom back from him.</p>
<p>	“And what’s your Animagus form then?” he asked curiously.</p>
<p>	“Ah-ah-ah, my turn,” she scolded firmly, earning an amused smirk from him.</p>
<p>	“Favorite color, favorite food, and favorite animal? Outside of phoenixes of course,” she prompted.</p>
<p>	“Favorite color is purple,” he told her with a chuckle, amused that she was repeating his questions back to him, “Favorite food? Dates. And as for favorite animal, probably any kind of bird really. I like how free they are. Now, what’s your Animagus form then?”</p>
<p>	“I’m a falcon,” she told him the pride in her voice clear, “Specifically the Peregrine Falcon. And it’s kind of funny your favorite food is dates, that’s Fawkes’ favorite as well. I wonder if it’s a phoenix thing.”</p>
<p>	“I don’t know ~yoi,” he answered with a shrug, then added a touch reluctantly “But what I do know is that it’s almost time to eat, and I’m getting hungry, which means we should probably be getting back.”</p>
<p>	He felt more than heard her sigh, and he liked to think she removed herself from his lap with reluctance, pushing herself to her feet and stretching before offering  him a hand up as well. He accepted it easily, and pulled himself to his feet, but didn’t bother to release her hand.</p>
<p>	“This was nice,” she told him a wistful smile on her face, “It was a good idea on your part, thank you.”</p>
<p>	“There’s no need to thank me,” he told her firmly, “It was good, for both of us honestly, and we should do it again.”</p>
<p>	She nodded in agreement, squeezing his hand gently, before allowing him to lead her away toward the Galley where he knew his brothers were going to be waiting for them.</p>
<p></p><div align="Center">
  <p>…~oO*Oo~…</p>
</div><p>	Izo tapped one of his long fingers against the table impatiently, glancing around the room, a worried frown on his face. The atmosphere was a fairly boisterous, and cheerful one, with discussions, arguments, and the clatter of utensils on plates. This was fairly normal for the Whitebeard Pirates, and normally it would be something that brought him peace. It was a family atmosphere and he always felt peaceful when surrounded by family.</p>
<p>	However normally the discussion and arguments in the galley weren’t all centered around Marco’s new soulmate. The anticipation in the air as everyone kept half an eye on the door was making him antsy. He didn’t like it, not one bit. Not when the new relationship between Marco and his soulmate was in such a fragile state.</p>
<p>	He knew his family was a lot to take even for most people, and Violetta obviously wasn’t most people. Earlier when she’d been telling Marco about the circumstances that had led to her rather spectacular arrival Izo had recognized in her a kindred spirit. Someone who, while still appearing strong and fierce was more than a bit broken.</p>
<p>	He’d been the same way back before he’d met Thatch and the Whitebeard pirates. Sailing around with his crew doing his best to forget the past he’d left behind him, allowing the vast blue waters of the ocean to wash it all away. Only it hadn’t really washed away, or healed him over time the way he had hoped, he just got better at hiding and not thinking about it.</p>
<p>	It wasn’t until he met Thatch that he really felt himself begin to heal. Knowing his soulmate loved and wanted him was a gift he’d never truly felt worthy of. However it was one he was extremely thankful for. With Thatch and the rest of the Whitebeard pirates’ love and support he’d begun to open up, to bleed his festering wounds clean, and give them the attention they needed to heal over.</p>
<p>	He was hoping that Marco would be able to do the same kind of thing for Violetta, and of course he would be there, along with the rest of the Division Commanders, to offer his unwavering support. Unfortunately despite their similar tragic pasts, their circumstances as they came into the Whitebeard Pirates were vastly different.</p>
<p>	To start with, back when he’d met Thatch he wasn’t a Division Commander, just a regular member of the Fourth Division, which meant that outside of chores he was free to devote all his time and attention to helping Izo and winning him over. Marco was already a Division Commander, and not just any Division Commander, but the First Division Commander, which put an enormous amount of pressure and responsibility on his shoulders.</p>
<p>	Unlike Thatch, Marco wasn’t going to be able to devote all his time to Violetta, he had duties that quite frankly no one else could manage as well as he could. Which is where he and the other Division Commanders came in. Surprisingly enough it was actually Thatch who had rounded up all the Commanders and Oyaji again after the two new soulmates had left, and spoken to them.</p>
<p>	He’d told them that all of them, himself included were going to have to be more conscientious about getting their work done and on time, to stress Marco out as little as possible and give him free time to spend with Violetta. He had then gone on to suggest that those of them who could, take what duties and responsibilities they thought they could shoulder, off of Marco’s pile at least until Violetta was a little bit more settled.</p>
<p>	Izo wasn’t sure he’d ever been more proud of his soulmate, and no one had argued with him. Instead they’d all, Oyaji included, set down to see who could do what to lighten Marco’s burden.</p>
<p>	Still, even with that Violetta’s position as Marco’s soulmate was going to be a difficult one in that she was going to be under a lot of scrutiny, both inside and outside of their family. Izo had come under scrutiny too of course, Thatch was a popular guy even back then and many had wondered if he was going to be good enough for the pompadour-ed man.</p>
<p>	Izo had been forced to prove himself, over and over again to get their respect, and he knew Jozu and Vista’s soulmates had gone through the same thing. Unfortunately their troubles would be nothing compared to Violetta’s, once again because Marco, was Marco the First Division Commander, and pretty much admired over all others except Oyaji.</p>
<p>	He could understand that. He himself admired Marco a great deal, and would probably subtly watch her for a while until he judged her a good partner for his brother, and he knew the other Division Commanders felt the same outside of Thatch, but then Thatch was an anomaly, and had apparently decided Violetta deserved his full fledged approval from the get-go. </p>
<p>Still at least they would be subtle about it. There was no doubt in his mind that some of his brothers would probably openly test their First Division Commander’s soulmate. He accepted it was going to happen whether he liked it or not, there was nothing he and the other Commanders could do. </p>
<p>He just hoped it wouldn’t put too much strain on the budding relationship because he wanted desperately for this to work out. He was a romantic at heart, and had longed for Marco to find his other half and be happy. That his other half was someone he could relate to, and that seemed to be in desperate need of the love and support Izo knew both Marco and the crew could provide was just an added bonus.</p>
<p>	Unfortunately despite the fact that he may wish otherwise, their relationship was down to Marco and Violetta. He and the other Commanders could do little things to ease their way, but in the end it was up to them to make it into the beautiful thing he knew it could be. He just hoped they were strong enough to make it through the hurdles that were coming their way.</p>
<p>	The door swung open, revealing Marco, and Violetta, and Izo winced as instantly all attention was on the pair of them, their brothers and sisters craning their necks and some even standing on tables and chairs in an attempt to catch a glimpse of Violetta.</p>
<p>	They had been holding hands when they came in, and Izo was gratified to see that despite the sudden attention neither of them released their hold on the other. Even from where he was seated he could see Violetta’s astonishing green eyes darting around cataloguing all the people in the room.</p>
<p>	Marco had looked startled when he first entered, but now he just looked annoyed, leveling a look at the room that normally would have sent everyone back to their seats, not today though.</p>
<p>	“If you’re done gawking at us, we’d like to eat ~yoi,” Marco informed them dryly, his face pinching with annoyance when barely anyone moved, “That means knock it off, before Violetta starts thinking none of you have any manners.’</p>
<p>	“I’m going to start thinking <em>you</em> don’t have any manners if you don’t start calling me Vi, Marco,” she quipped into the quiet her mouth quirking in wry amusement, “Though I do have to ask, since when do pirates care about manners anyway?”</p>
<p>	“Hear, hear!” someone in the crowd shouted to raucous laughter and applause, as the quiet tension broke, and conversation started up again, though a good majority kept her in their peripherals even if they weren’t outright staring.</p>
<p>	Izo watched on in silent approval as Marco leaned down to whisper something in Violetta’s ear, and she shook her head at him, gesturing for him to lead. Marco affectionately tucked a piece of hair away from her face and nodded, guiding her toward where the food was sitting out so everyone could help themselves.</p>
<p>	“She handled that well,” Jiru remarked quietly to the table where the Division Commanders were all sitting, having decided earlier to keep themselves separate for the evening so that Violetta wouldn’t be quite as overwhelmed.</p>
<p>	“Indeed, most impressive,” Vista remarked from his place beside his soulmate, the only two extras at their table.</p>
<p>	Izo waited for Marco to turn away from the food and lifted a hand so he could see them, gesturing for them to come over. Marco nodded in acknowledgment, but it looked like they might be waiting a while for the two of them to join them, because they didn’t even make it five steps before someone was intercepting them.</p>
<p>	“That’s Cas,” Hana grimaced seeing the interloper as well. </p>
<p>“Quick, Jozu, go help her, she doesn’t deserve having Cas sicced on her right away,” Ria ordered her soulmate with a wince.</p>
<p>	“She’s going to have to meet him eventually,” Fossa pointed out reasonably blowing out a puff of smoke from his cigar, “He’s Marco’s second in command after all.”</p>
<p>	“Too late to do anything now anyway,” Namur added just seconds before Cas’ voice rang out over the Galley, making a hush fall over the watching pirates once more.</p>
<p>	“So what makes you think you’re good enough for our First Division Commander?” he demanded, and Izo winced at his confrontational tone. Everyone knew that despite his seeming invulnerability Cas was extremely protective of Marco.</p>
<p>	“Cas, back off ~yoi,” Marco’s low threatening tone carried throughout the suddenly very still Galley, it wasn’t very often that Marco got riled, but when he did it was best to back the hell off. It seemed Violetta was going to be one of the very few things that could potentially trigger Marco’s temper, as he moved his body in between her and Cas.</p>
<p>	“I’m just asking a question,” Cas informed him, crossing his arms over his chest, “The rest of the Division and I discussed this already, we want to talk to her.”</p>
<p>	“Talk to her?” Marco repeated flatly, “This isn’t talking to her, this is confronting her in front of an audience, it’s more like attacking her.”</p>
<p>	“It was a group decision to handle things this way,” Cas repeated firmly, and Izo had to admire his guts if not his brains, not everyone could stand up to Marco on  the edge of a temper.</p>
<p>	“So it’s a mutiny then?” Marco asked low and quiet, and Izo winced as Cas blanched. He knew that wasn’t the way Cas meant it, but he could see why Marco might take it that way. This was starting to get really bad. He shifted in his seat trying to decide whether he should interfere.</p>
<p>	“Of course not!” Cas protested immediately, “We would never!”</p>
<p>	Izo shifted and made to stand as Marco took a step forward toward Cas, but Thatch’s hand on his arm made him stop. He lifted a brow at his soulmate in surprise, but Thatch didn’t say anything instead gesturing toward Violetta, who had fallen to the side during the confrontation, and was watching with a frown on her face.</p>
<p>	“You…” Marco paused, and Izo nearly gaped in surprise as he realized Violetta had moved forward and set her hand on his arm, demanding attention.</p>
<p>	“Marco,” it was just his name, but Izo could tell the word held a world of meaning behind it, the most prominent one being, “please let me handle this one.”</p>
<p>	Marco frowned in response and Izo was sure he was going to protest, but Violetta spoke before he could, “He’s just concerned Marco, please?”</p>
<p>	Izo watched in shock as Marco caved and stepped back, moving himself behind Violetta, no longer shielding her from view, though his free hand, the one not holding his food, had come down to latch firmly around her waist as a show of support.</p>
<p>	“Your question then,” Violetta said promptly turning her intense green eyes on Cas.</p>
<p>	“To begin with, though it’s obvious to me you hold your Commander in high esteem, I don’t like the way it was phrased. ‘Good enough’ implies that I am somehow lesser, for the record I’m not. I refuse to be anything less than equal to my soulmate in our relationship,” she informed him firmly, her voice clear and carrying.</p>
<p>	“It also implies that I somehow have to meet some unknown standard in order to be worthy of having a relationship with him, thus how would I know whether I am or am not ‘good enough’ without knowing the standard?” she asked wryly.</p>
<p>	“Phrasing it the way you have has only done one thing, which is to set me up for confrontation, and try to see my reaction. I think that by now you and whoever else you spoke with realize by now that this was a rather poor decision yes?” she queried sharply, her disappointed gaze moving from Cas and sweeping around the room.</p>
<p>	Izo could see several of his brothers, all of whom belonged to the First Division, shifting guiltily in their seats, and was gratified to see Cas nodding along with her question.</p>
<p>	“Good then,” Violetta confirmed firmly, “Now because I know you set this all up with the best of intentions I will do my best to answer what I think you actually want to know, which was how do I know that I am <em>right</em> for Marco. How do I know that I will make him happy and vice versa.”</p>
<p>	“The answer to that is that I don’t,” she answered herself brutally honest, “I don’t know if I’m right for him, or if he’s right for me, at this moment all was have to go on is a few short hours spent together and the words inked on both of our skins.”</p>
<p>	“However I can tell you that so far things look good for us, or at least for me. In the short time I’ve known him I’ve found several things about him that I like, and I hope that he’s done the same,” she told the room, glancing back at Marco, and covering the hand he had on her waist with one of her own, twining her fingers with his, “He makes me smile, he doesn’t seem to mind my quirks and he makes me feel safe for the first time in a very, <em>very</em> long time.”</p>
<p>	She turned back to Cas completely missing the affectionate smile on Marco’s face, though neither Cas nor Izo did, and Izo hoped from the thoughtful look on Cas’ face that he was seeing it as a good thing the way that Izo was.</p>
<p>	“Unfortunately that’s all I know for now. We don’t really know each other well enough for more, so I hope that, that’s enough for now, and if not, well I’ll just have to get back to you now won’t I?” she asked offering her hand to Cas in what was clearly a peace gesture.</p>
<p>	Izo held his breath as Cas studied it, then her, hoping against hope that he wasn’t about to do something stupid. He breathed a sigh of relief as a slow smile dawned over the other man’s face and he accepted the offered hand.</p>
<p>	“I think I’d like that, and I think I’d like to know you Miss Violetta,” Cas told her clasping her hand firmly.</p>
<p>	“I’d like to know you as well,” she told him, clear sincerity in her voice and face, “Dinner tomorrow? I even promise to ditch my soulmate if you bring your friends.”</p>
<p>	Izo sucked in a surprised breath. It was a bold move on her part, putting herself at the mercy of the First Division, and from the look on his face Marco clearly didn’t like it much, but Cas did if the amused grin on his face meant anything.</p>
<p>	“Can do Miss Violetta,” he told her with a chuckle.</p>
<p>	“Call me Vi,” she ordered gently, “All my friends do.”</p>
<p>	“Vi then,” he affirmed, “And I’m Casper but everyone calls me Cas.”</p>
<p>	“Nice to meet you,” Violetta said sincerely.</p>
<p>	“And you as well,” Cas replied tipping his hat, “I best let you get to your meal now though, or your food will get cold. Have a good evening Vi, Commander.”</p>
<p>	He nodded to both of them and sauntered back to the table he’d come from, conversation beginning to pick up again as Marco and Violetta made their way over to the table, Marco’s hand on her waist, gently guiding her. They set their trays down in the seats between Izo and Thatch, the ones they’d left open for them, and sank down into them.</p>
<p>	“Are you alright Violetta?” Marco asked quietly as the noise in the Galley rose high enough that no one but Izo, Thatch, and Jozu and his soulmate Ria across from them would be able to hear.</p>
<p>	“I’m alright,” Violetta told him letting out a shaky breath, “Just give me a moment to come down from the adrenalin, and what did I say about my name?”</p>
<p>	“But I like Violetta ~yoi,” Marco told her gently rubbing his hand along her back, “It’s pretty and if everyone calls you Vi, I want to call you something different.”</p>
<p>	“Then call me something different, just not Violetta,” she ordered her nose wrinkling in distaste, “It reminds me too much of my Aunt and Uncle.”</p>
<p>	“Alright,” Marco told her, though the frown on his face told Izo he hadn’t liked the way she said ‘anut and uncle’ either, “I’ll try to think of something.”</p>
<p>	“You handled that really, really well,” Ria praised from her spot next to Jozu, “The first time one of Jozu’s Division tried to ask me what my intentions were with their Commander I hid behind him. I’m Ria by the way, Jozu’s soulmate.”</p>
<p>	“Vi,” Violetta returned with a smile, “And thank you. I like to think I’ve gotten better at speaking to potentially hostile crowds over the years.”</p>
<p>	“Potentially hostile crowds?” Thatch asked concerned, voicing what they were all thinking.</p>
<p>	“Yeah, being famous will do that do you, though this lot reminded more of the classes I used to teach than the potentially riotous mobs from during the war,” she said wryly.</p>
<p>	“Classes?” Izo asked at the same time that Ria exclaimed, “War?”</p>
<p>	“I was a teacher for a while remember?’ she asked Izo, who did indeed recall her saying something about being an instructor for ‘new soldiers.’</p>
<p>“You… weren’t at the meeting earlier were you,” it was a statement more than a question but Ria shook her head in response anyway.</p>
<p>	“No, that was for Division Commanders only. I’m no Commander. I’m just a nurse, even if I have a Commander as a soulmate I’m not generally included in those,” Ria explained with a self-depreciating shrug.</p>
<p>	“There’s no just about being a nurse,” Vi informed her sternly, jumping in before any of the Commanders had a chance, “Fighting and Killing? That’s easy, people are stupidly fragile at times, but putting them back together? That takes time, effort and willpower, maybe it’s not physical strength but it’s a strength all the same.”</p>
<p>	“You try telling that to some of these idiots,” Ria told her with a sigh, “Maybe it’ll stop them from complaining about Hana and I behind our backs about being dead weight.”</p>
<p>	Izo frowned and glanced over at Jozu who was glowering unhappily, apparently it was the first he was hearing about it. He didn’t like that Ria and if Ria was to be believed Hana as well, had been made to feel unwelcome or burdensome on the Moby.</p>
<p>	“Yes I suppose they would,” Violetta replied with a grimace of distaste, “But it isn’t just supporting roles men forget or don’t give due credit. That war I mentioned? I led it, because no one else would, but let me tell you I had men left and right telling me to ‘step aside and let a ‘real man’ lead’ hah! As if I was going to let a blowhard lead people into battle with no care for the lives at stake, as if I wasn’t strong enough to kick their arses blindfolded! No matter how many times I proved I was better, smarter, stronger, there were always people men and women who thought I should let a man lead simply because of what he had between his legs!”</p>
<p>	“You’re a fighter then?” Ria asked interestedly even as she nodded along in solidarity, “I do nursing and only nursing outside of the self-defense I was required to learn in case of attack, but Hana can do some fighting, though she’s generally regulated to the back-up group. I think you’d like her, we soulmates have to stick together right? Here I’ll grab her.”</p>
<p>	“Oy! Hana! Come sit with us!” Ria called waving down the table. </p>
<p>	Izo watched as the leggy brunette that was Vista’s better half extracted herself from her spot and made her way down as Ria slid over into Jozu’s lap to make room for her.</p>
<p>	“Vi this is Hana, Hana this is Vi,” Ria introduced waving between the two of them.</p>
<p>	“Nice to meet you,” Violetta greeted politely. Hana nodded in response, not being one who was much for words and slid into the offered seat raising her brow at Ria in question.</p>
<p>	“Vi is a fighter like you,” Ria explained, and Hana turned curious eyes on Marco’s soulmate, an interested look on her face.</p>
<p>	“What’s your weapon then?” Hana asked quietly, her voice a low throaty rasp that Izo probably would’ve envied if not for the fact that it was only that way because of the scar on her neck, like an demented smile that ran from one side to the other where someone had tried to slit her throat.</p>
<p>	“It’s a bit hard to explain, and I don’t think that here is the best place to discuss it,” Violetta told her with a small frown, “But you can ask your respective soulmates for confirmation and details later, I don’t mind if they tell you. I actually thought they would’ve already told you, I never meant to make anyone promise to keep things from their soulmates, though I’d appreciate if you’d keep it to yourselves.”</p>
<p>	Hana’s eyebrows were raised in surprised interest, so Violetta continued her voice quiet enough only those closest to them could hear, “I’m from a different world, where there are no Devil Fruits, but magic users who have the abilities of several Devil Fruits combined. I’m one of those magic users.”</p>
<p>	“You’re not having us on are you?” Ria asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>	“She’s not,” Jozu affirmed in a low rumble, “She demonstrated for all of the Commanders and Oyaji earlier.”</p>
<p>	“Seriously? That’s really neat,” Ria told her with a wide smile, “So how strong are you then?”</p>
<p>	“In my world I was one of the strongest alive,” Violetta admitted with a shrug, “But that might not mean anything here, it’s hard for me to say because I don’t know a whole lot of what’s possible in this world. I just learned about Devil Fruits today and there may be more I don’t know about. Plus from what I’ve seen fighters in this world seem a lot more focused on physical abilities. You don’t see muscles like these in my world outside professional athletes, and certainly not in the magical communities.”</p>
<p>	“Well that’s unfortunate,” Ria said with a grimace, “Some of the muscles are very nice if you catch my meaning.”</p>
<p>	Izo smirked in amusement at the eyebrow wiggle Ria was offering, though even Hana had nodded in agreement. He couldn’t bring himself to disagree either considering.</p>
<p>	“Oh I know,” Violetta told them with a smirk just as Marco was lifting his glass to take a drink, “Believe me I’ve been admiring the view <em>all day</em>.”</p>
<p>	Marco choked in surprise at the low seductive tone she’d used, and Izo was a bit surprised too, not at her gumption, but that she admitted it so easily. Both Ria and Hana laughed though, and he was glad to see the three of them getting along so well, it would be good for all of them to have the support of another woman.</p>
<p>	“Anyway, back to how strong I am, there’s no doubt in my mind one on one I could take anyone on the ship including the captain,” Violetta claimed casually, causing more than one disbelieving look, “But that’s only if I surprised them and only because despite seeing a preview of my abilities earlier they don’t know a fraction of what I’m capable of.”</p>
<p>	And wasn’t that a warning and a half. Still again Izo had to give her points for sheer guts. It wasn’t everyone who could and would make the claim sitting at a table full of the Division Commanders, then again there was a good chance she was actually correct in her assessment, given that they really didn’t know everything about her yet.</p>
<p>	“You think you could even win against Marco?” Hana asked interestedly.</p>
<p>	“It’s hard to say given his abilities. I’m pretty sure that even the magic that would generally knock a man out for at least twenty-four hours would wear off on him quickly,” Violetta mused glancing at Marco and obviously sizing him up as he raised a brow at her in interest, “I think I’d have to restrain him instead of actually knocking him unconscious to win.”</p>
<p>	“If you want me tied up, all you had to do was say so ~yoi,” Marco informed her with a smirk.</p>
<p>	All the Commanders within earshot, who were blatantly eavesdropping on the conversation, chuckled, as Violetta’s face tinged pink in surprise and embarrassment. Marco jumped slightly and Izo noted in shock that Violetta had actually pinched him in the side in retaliation. In response Marco grabbed hold of her and dragged her into his lap, wrapping his arms around her.</p>
<p>	“Oy!” Violetta protested, though everyone listening could tell it was half-hearted at best, “Will you quit manhandling me? I was trying to eat!”</p>
<p>	“You can eat from here,” Marco told her with a smirk, “And I’ll stop manhandling you when you stop pinching me.”</p>
<p>	“So never then,” Violetta grumbled, though she relaxed back into his arms, “I swear to Merlin if you drop food on me I will pluck all your tail feathers.”</p>
<p>	Marco chuckled and squeezed her lightly before going back to his food, and Izo marveled at the easy interaction between the two. They almost acted as if they’d known each other months instead of a few short hours. This was going well, even better than he’d expected. He traded pleased grins with his soulmate over their heads, who was obviously on the same wavelength as he smiled back.</p>
<p>	“Why are you hiding your abilities?” Hana prompted, starting the conversation back up again.</p>
<p>	“To keep people from wanting to use my abilities for their own gain,” Violetta answered honestly, boldly stealing some of Marco’s food off his plate.</p>
<p>	“Yeah I could see how that would be an issue,” Ria mused quietly, “The marines would love to get their hands on someone with multiple Devil Fruit powers.”</p>
<p>	“I’m trying to keep off their radar for as long as possible,” Violetta told her, and Izo breathed a quiet sigh of relief that she hadn’t mentioned that the people she was trying to keep from using her were in the room with them and not actually the marines.</p>
<p>	“Well we won’t say anything right Hana?” Ria promised sincerely, and Hana nodded her agreement, though from the look in her eyes she at least had understood the implication that it was actually the Whitebeard pirates who might want to use Violetta. She may not say a whole lot but she was extremely intuitive.</p>
<p>	“And you could probably ask Haruta to keep an ear out for you, he specializes in learning what the marines know,” Ria pointed out completely oblivious.</p>
<p>	“Haruta? I’m afraid I don’t know who that is,” Violetta told Ria with a frown.</p>
<p>	“Haruta’s the one in the lime green tunic,” Ria told her indicating the brother in question down the table, “Don’t worry about not remembering names, it will come with time, there are so many of them it would be impossible to recall all of them right away.”</p>
<p>	“I’ll remember that for later,” Violetta promised, “But I’m not sure I was ever told in the first place. I know Marco, of course, and Thatch, Izo, Cas, and Jozu but I only know Jozu because you said he was your soulmate, oh! And I know Haruta now as well too.”</p>
<p>	Izo blinked startled, and cast his mind back to the meeting, realizing, that they’d gotten so caught up in the fact that she was Marco’s magical soulmate from another dimension (and that still kind of tripped him up and made him question his sanity just thinking it), that they’d never actually introduced themselves.</p>
<p>	“Well you know me, I’m Thatch,” his soulmate began, obviously having the same thoughts as Izo, “And I’m the Fourth Division Commander, Jozu is the Third Division Commander and Ria’s soulmate, the Second Division Commander is Gabe, he’s the purple haired one at the end.”</p>
<p>	“Vista is the one with the mustache and tophat, he’s Hana’s soulmate and the Fifth Division Commander, Blamenco is the one wearing the tricorn hat and is Sixth Division, Rakuyo has the blonde dreadlocks and is Seventh, Namur is the one who gave you the map to look at earlier and the Eighth,” Thatch rattled off, pointing to each Commander as he introduced them, who waved or nodded as their name came up, not even pretending to not be listening anymore.</p>
<p>	“Blenheim is the one with the gray beard and dark braid and the Ninth, Curiel is the one with the green hat and glasses, the Tenth, Kingdew is the one with the blonde bob and the Eleventh, the Twelfth is Haruta who was pointed out to you already, Thirteenth is Atmos, the one with the horned helmet, Speed Jiru is the Fourteenth and the one with the red cap on, and Fossa the fifteenth is the one with the cigar in his mouth,” Thatch informed her.</p>
<p>	“And last but not least is my beautiful Izo who’s my soulmate and the sixteenth Division Commander whom you’ve already met,” he finished making a grand sweeping gesture to Izo, who rolled his eyes, a fond smile on his lips.</p>
<p>	“And that’s everyone, questions?” Thatch asked, “Don’t worry too much about remembering, just ask if you need help.”</p>
<p>	Violetta nodded, looking a little dazed, either at the number of people or Thatch’s enthusiasm it was hard to tell. Either way it didn’t stay that way for long, as, now that they were acknowledged all the Commanders wanted to speak to her.</p>
<p>	Marco was forced to remind her to eat in between speaking as she fielded questions and asked some of her own, but Izo noted she was doing well, holding her own against the onslaught. He himself kept quiet just watching her interact with the others. Things were going really well, and if they were going to continue in this vein he thought maybe the two of them would be just fine.</p>
<p></p><div align="Center">
  <p>…~oO*Oo~…</p>
</div><p>	Violetta let out a quiet breath of relief as Marco ushered her back on to the private deck they’d been using to ask and answer each other’s questions earlier. It wasn’t that she’d minded answering questions or speaking to Marco’s crewmembers, but the whole thing had been a bit wearing after a while.</p>
<p>	Luckily once they’d finished their food, which took an extraordinarily long time as she answered several questions between each bite, she’d reminded Marco that he’d agreed to show her his phoenix form. He’d taken the hint and escorted her out.</p>
<p>	The other Division Commanders had protested, but Marco had pointed out it was getting late, and that some of them had duties they needed to be seeing to. When she’d curiously asked about any duties he might have, he’d smirked and told her they had a soulmate protocol. Apparently this protocol stated that anyone who found their soulmate got the week off to get to know them better, which meant he was all hers.</p>
<p>	It was just past twilight, and the moon was bright overhead, which lit the way for her to follow him. Still it was a good thing he was leading or she would’ve tripped over something by now.</p>
<p>	“You ready for this ~yoi?” he asked her as they finally made it to the more private deck.</p>
<p>	“Of course,” she told him eagerly, she was actually pretty excited, and it must’ve been obvious on her face because he smirked at her. He didn’t tease though, instead turning away and sprinting dead out for the railing of the deck, vaulting up over it towards the ocean below.</p>
<p>	Alarmed she dashed toward the railing, hoping he knew what he was doing, only to jerk back in surprise, a gasp leaving her lips as blue fire raced past her. Awed she watched as the blue and gold bird lit up the night sky, its’ feathers made of glowing rippling fire.</p>
<p>	He was like nothing she’d ever seen before, certainly nothing like Fawkes, especially in coloring, though something about the plumage, especially the extensive tail feathers, reminded her of him. He was extraordinary, and watching him perform acrobatic maneuvers against the backdrop of slowly appearing stars took her breath away despite knowing he was showing off.</p>
<p>	After several long minutes, he banked back towards the deck she was standing on, and she moved out of the way so he could come in for a landing. He didn’t change back as he landed though, the way she’d been expecting. Instead he retained his form and turned towards her. Up close he was a lot bigger than Fawkes, still human sized in the torso, though his wings, which were proudly spread, spanned the entire length of the small deck they were standing on, at least twelve feet across.</p>
<p>	Despite being in phoenix form his face was very expressive as he trilled softly at her, in tones that were at once both extremely similar to Fawkes’ and somewhat different. Still she recognized the invitation for what it was. Taking a few steps closer, wary of the flames, she was surprised as she reached a hand out, to not feel any heat at all.</p>
<p>	Feeling more confident she stepped right up to him, and still there was no heat. Reaching out a hand she offered it to Marco, unsure whether it was safe to touch or not and trusting him to let her know.</p>
<p>	He immediately pressed his face into her hand, and she was surprised to see her fingers actually pass through part of the blue flames before touching the feathers below. Awed, and reminded of the bluebell flames of the wizarding world she gently ran her fingers through his feathers the same way that Fawkes liked. Instantly his eyes closed and a soft churring coo left his beak as she gently preened him, and she could tell he was enjoying it.</p>
<p>	“This is amazing,” she told him, fingers carefully exploring every inch of him, “You’re like nothing I’ve ever seen before.”</p>
<p>	She jerked in surprise as the feathers under her fingers became flesh, his head, legs and torso reverting to human form, though his arms stayed the brightly glowing wings.</p>
<p>	“I’m glad you like it ~yoi,” he told her a pleased smirk on his face.</p>
<p>	“You can partially transform too?” she asked impressed, “I’ve never seen an Animagi partially transform like this, well I have, but that’s usually an accident or for practice, it’s not something they maintain for long periods of time, and people have gotten stuck like that before.”</p>
<p>	“All Zoan types have at least three basic forms, which are the base, human form, full animal form, and the partial transformation. Because my flames aren’t hot, this is the form I generally use for aerial combat, though I sometimes go full animal form just because I fly a lot faster that way,” he explained, “Either way I’m immune to injury unless seastone or Haki are involved and as long as the seastone doesn’t stay in contact with me I still heal right after, same with Haki, even though someone can hit me I still heal right after.”</p>
<p>	“What are seastone and Haki?” she asked confused.</p>
<p>	“Seastone is said to be a stone manifested with the power of the sea, it’s like the ocean in rock form, and of course because Devil Fruit users are weakened by the sea, we’re also weakened by seastone ~yoi,” he informed her, “It’s also incredibly strong, marines and pirates alike use it as both a means of restraint and a weapon against Devil Fruit users.”</p>
<p>	“Haki on the other hand is a little bit more complicated,” he told her with a slight frown, “The basics are that it is a manifestation of willpower, and it comes in three forms. Everyone can access the first two, which are Armament and Observation.”</p>
<p>	“Armament allows you to harden your body or your weapons to protect against damage, and fight against Logia Devil fruit users who can turn their entire body into their element to avoid damage, and it looks like this,” he told her. She jerked in surprise as a black sheen covered half of his face for a second before disappearing again, “Though it only protects you if your Haki is stronger than your opponents’.”</p>
<p>	“Observation on the other hand allows you to sense things, like where people are located, how strong they are, etcetera. It also lets you predict and react to your opponents moves, though again it only works if your Haki is stronger,” he explained then frowned in concentration and demonstrated, “Right now just standing here I can tell you there are fifteen people on watch, five in the main crow’s nest, though by how they’re arranged it looks like they might be playing cards, and two in each of the other two nests. The others are patrolling the deck, keeping a lookout.”</p>
<p>	“So what’s the third one then?” Violetta prompted fascinated.</p>
<p>	“The third is called Conqueror’s Haki, and what it is, is essentially exerting your will over another’s, generally it feels like a strong pressure on your body and mind, and if you aren’t strong enough it will knock you completely unconscious,” he explained with a frown, “Though like I said only a few, like one in a million are able to wield it successfully. On the crew it’s only Oyaji who can.”</p>
<p>	“I wonder if this Haki of yours is your world’s manifestation of magic,” Violetta mused thoughtfully into the silence that followed that statement.</p>
<p>	“What makes you say that ~yoi?” Marco asked curiously.</p>
<p>	“Well, when they teach magic to us initially, it’s all about moving your wand in a precise way and saying the incantation correctly,” she began, thinking the words over as she said them, turning them over in her mind, “However as you get more and more advanced you lose the need to say the words, and if you’re strong enough you can learn to do it without the wand too.”</p>
<p>	“Part of that I think is concentration, the words and wand movements give the caster something to focus their will on, creating a specific desire for a specific response,” she continued slowly, “But once you grow older and get used to magic you get used to bending it to your will, some of the spells I know require specific feelings like joyful memories to cast, and some require a strong will to fight off, but all of them require desire. You have to desire it to happen, and isn’t desire just another word for will?”</p>
<p>	“I don’t know, it sounds fascinating, but I don’t know enough about magic to say for sure,” he told her, allowing his wings, which had been resting at his sides, to shift back into arms and crossing them across his chest, plunging them into darkness, lit only by the few lamps hanging around the ship.</p>
<p>	“But you would think that if one was the equivalent of the other, you wouldn’t have Haki you would only have magic, or if you did have Haki I would sense it as your magic,” Marco reasoned a thoughtful look on his face, “But I can sense your Haki level and it isn’t actually very strong, it’s on the lower scale of the people on the ship and while that is generally considered impressive as we are one of the strongest crews in the world, it isn’t what I would expect from someone who was as strong magically as you indicated you were.”</p>
<p>	“I have Haki?” she asked surprised.</p>
<p>	“You do, or at least you register to my senses as having it ~yoi,” he told her with an amused smile.</p>
<p>	“Then I wonder…” she trailed off her hands toying with the holster on her forearm.</p>
<p>	“Back in the world I came from, everyone uses a wand, but we aren’t allowed to receive our own until we’re eleven years old and heading to school for the first time,” she explained slowly, wondering if this might be a bad idea but determined to try anyway.</p>
<p>	“The process of getting a wand can be a little complicated, the man I got mine from kept saying ‘the wand chooses the wizard’ but that’s not true, or not entirely true I should say,” she continued, flicking her Holly and phoenix feather wand out of the holster and lightly twirling it in her fingers.</p>
<p>	“A wand does have some sentience, though only the tiniest bit, and its not necessarily its own sentience but sentience left over from the creature who donated the core of the wand. In general wands have two components, the wood and the core, the three most commonly accepted cores are unicorn hair, dragon heartstrings and phoenix feathers.”</p>
<p>	“Because all three are extremely magical in and of themselves they leave a bit of an imprint of their own magic on every piece of them, including the aforementioned parts, it’s this imprint that gives the wand ‘sentience’ and personality.”</p>
<p>	“The magic that creates the ‘sentience’ is what ‘chooses’ the wizard in that the magic has to resonate with the witch or wizard’s magical core in order to work properly, otherwise the results can be anything from refusal to complete spells to backfiring on the spell caster.”</p>
<p>	“The reason most believe a wand has ‘sentience’ isn’t because of this, but actually because of wand allegiances. Sometimes, if you win a duel against another witch or wizard and take their wand, you can then use their wand nearly as well as the other original owner. I say ‘nearly’ because no wand will ever work as well for a witch or wizard as one matched to their core.”</p>
<p>	“They call this the wand ‘switching allegiances’ which is a bit of a misnomer because if the original owner can get the wand back it will continue to work just as well for them as it did before, regardless of the method they use to retrieve it.”</p>
<p>	“However I’ve found that this isn’t always true, it actually depends on the core of the wand as to whether it will work or not. Dragon heartstrings are actually the most common wand core, therefore it makes sense that most people believe the lore about ‘switching allegiances’ because the wands with those type of core do behave in exactly that way. Fitting considering actual dragons follow the ‘strongest rules over all’ pack mentality.”</p>
<p>	“Unicorn tail hairs the second most common core, on the other hand tend to not work for the new owner or only work to a degree, like if you were trying to shoot a spout of water you might only get a trickle, which makes sense considering unicorns are more timid and don’t much care for strangers, but can be forced into things if they can’t escape.”</p>
<p>	“Finally phoenix feather wands, which are extremely rare because phoenixes have to voluntarily donate their feathers, are a different kettle of fish altogether. If someone takes a phoenix feather wand from its owner it tends to get really nasty in return, doing things like burning fingers or making spells explode, they can get really foul to anyone who isn’t their owner or unapproved by their owner.”</p>
<p>	“However in general it’s considered extremely strange and intimate to let someone else use your wand, because of how they’re in tune with the wielder’s magical core, so approved other users don’t happen very often.”</p>
<p>	“The reason I’m telling you all this,” she said cautiously, pleased to see that he’d been listening and watching her with interest the entire time she spoke, “Is because without accidental magic, which happens to magical children, it’s impossible to tell whether or not someone has magic or not unless they’re doing spells.”</p>
<p>	“You said I have Haki so I was wondering if maybe…?” the implication was clear and she saw his eyes go wide with understanding and interest, as she twirled her wand in her hand and offered it to him, handle first.</p>
<p>	“My wand is holly and phoenix feather,” she explained, “Fawkes’ feather actually, and because he seems to like and approve of you and because I’m handing it to you willingly it shouldn’t backfire, but I figured I should warn you just in case.”</p>
<p>	Marco nodded and accepted the wand from her hands, lightly running his fingers along the smooth wood before gripping the handle and turning to her, “What exactly do you want me to do?”</p>
<p>	“There’s a spell, that everyone learns as their first piece of magic as it’s extraordinarily easy and requires very little power, it calls light, and the incantation is ‘lumos’ generally all you have to do is hold the wand, will the magic and say the word,” she offered with a smile.</p>
<p>	Marco nodded and glanced at the wand, she could feel anticipation building in her as she watched him eagerly. She had a gut feeling about this and she thought maybe…</p>
<p>	“Lumos,” Marco said quietly, and it took a second, a very long second in which she was holding her breath, but the tip of the wand lit with a soft golden light, illuminating his face. She let out a surprised, delighted laugh, at the shock and wonder on his face as he held the wand carefully in his fingers an awed look on his face.</p>
<p>	“Well what do you know, you’re magical,” she teased holding out her hand and accepting the wand back as the light from it dimmed.</p>
<p>	“That was amazing ~yoi,” he told her seriously.</p>
<p>	“It is isn’t it?” she asked with a fond smile.</p>
<p>	“I was thinking,” she said after a long minute of silence, “That I’d like to learn this Haki of yours, would you teach me, if I taught you some magic in exchange?”</p>
<p>	Marco looked at her surprised then thoughtful, “I would’ve taught you Haki either way, despite your magic its nearly a necessity in this part of the world, and I wouldn’t want you to not have it, especially since everyone past a certain level is required to know it. All the Division Commanders and their soulmates are required because of the level of danger they’re in, whether the soulmates sail with us or not, but I wouldn’t mind learning some magic in exchange.”</p>
<p>	“There are some soulmates who don’t sail with you?” she asked curiously.</p>
<p>	“Yes ~yoi,” he answered finally though he sounded a touch reluctant to her ears, “We have an island, in the middle or our territory, the territory the Whitebeard Pirates own and protect, that houses former crewmembers who’ve decided to settle down, and the soulmates who don’t want to travel with us.”</p>
<p>	“After we stock up on supplies, it’s where we’ll be headed,” he admitted, “We were due a visit there anyway, and we always head there when someone finds their soulmate just in case.”</p>
<p>	She could hear the rest of that sentence clearly in her mind, ‘just in case they don’t want to stay, just in case you don’t want to stay.’ She nodded slowly in understanding, “It’s nice to know that, that’s an option I suppose.”</p>
<p>	“It’s a nice island, temperate and calm, most of them like it a lot,” he told her his voice level and not giving anything away.</p>
<p>	“I’ll take that under consideration, but for now it’s getting kind of late, as amazing as today has been, as amazing as meeting you has been, it’s been a long day. Is there somewhere I’m supposed to go to freshen up and bed down for the night?”</p>
<p></p><div align="Center">
  <p>…~oO*Oo~…</p>
</div><p>	Marco quickly tamped down on the emotions that had accompanied her declaring the island an option for herself, because it hadn’t even been a full twenty-four hours yet, of course she was still considering not staying here, with him. The thought stung more than he thought it should be allowed to considering he’d only known her for a short time.</p>
<p>	He didn’t want her to go, he wanted her to stay full time with him on the ship, the same way Hana and Ria did. However given her past, and how afraid she was about being used he couldn’t bring himself to say it. He didn’t want her to feel obligated to stay, and he’d already promised her he would support her no matter what she decided to do. That being said, it didn’t mean he wouldn’t try his damndest to sway her over to his way of thinking, </p>
<p>“There’s probably some space in the First Division’s quarters for you, you’d have to share the room of course but that’s one option ~yoi,” he told her slowly.</p>
<p>“Is there another one?” she asked with a grimace of distaste, “I don’t think I could sleep surrounded by strangers, and I have some pretty nasty instincts if I get woken unexpectedly.”</p>
<p>“The only other option would be to share my quarters with me,” he offered and seeing the look on her face hastened to explain, “I’m not expecting anything from you, it’s a bit too soon for that I think, but there is only one bed and I’d prefer to share.”</p>
<p>“I have nightmares sometimes,” she informed him bluntly, “And I will attack people if I’m woken up, just because you’re my soulmate doesn’t mean you’d be automatically exempt from that.”</p>
<p>Marco nodded thoughtfully, knowing what little he did of her shitty past it didn’t surprise him a bit that she had nightmares and survival instincts not conducive to sharing a bed still, “I’m not too worried. Even if you attack, I’ll heal ~yoi.”</p>
<p>“You did say that earlier, that you healed, but how does that even work? Fawkes’ tears have healing powers, but I don’t picture you as much of a crier,” she said skeptically.</p>
<p>“His tears heal other people?” Marco asked surprised.</p>
<p>“They do,” she confirmed with a shrug, “Though I think they might be limited in what exactly they can do. I take it though, that, that means crying isn’t what you do.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s my flames that heal me~yoi,” Marco explained baffled at the idea of healing tears of all things, “That’s all they do really, absorb attacks and heal my injuries, they have no offensive power.”</p>
<p>“Your flames?” she asked interestedly, and he nodded in confirmation.</p>
<p>“Here, watch,” pulling a dagger from his pocket he sliced deeply across his palm, letting the blood spill for a second before willing the flames to life, watching as they danced over his skin, sealing the wound closed.</p>
<p>He was surprised as Violetta immediately grabbed hold of his hand turning it over in her smaller ones, inspecting it thoroughly before turning angry green eyes on him, “Why the hell did you just do that?”</p>
<p>“I thought you wanted to see the flames ~yoi,” he offered completely baffled at her angry reaction.</p>
<p>“So you decided to cut open your hand?” she demanded appalled.</p>
<p>“It healed,” he replied not quite seeing where she was going with this offering her a shrug and a puzzled look.</p>
<p>“Did it hurt?” she asked still looking upset.</p>
<p>“Only for a second,” he promised with a frown.</p>
<p>“But it still hurt, you still felt it?” she repeated, and understanding began to dawn on him.</p>
<p>“It’s alright you know. I’m used to pain,” he assured her, though that didn’t seem to be the answer she was looking for as her face crumpled slightly in sadness.</p>
<p>“Marco, just because you’re used to it doesn’t mean you should willingly suffer through it even if it’s only a second, not over something so trivial,” she told him seriously, “And even though you might heal from it, that doesn’t mean I want to hurt you if my nightmares get out of hand.”</p>
<p>He nodded slowly, seeing her point, touched by her concern for him, it wasn’t something most people, including himself would ever think about or consider with his abilities, if he still felt pain, and he found it endearing that she had.</p>
<p>“I’m not worried about being hurt by you,” he told her gently, taking hold of her hands with both of his, “Having you close to me is worth whatever risk. Maybe it’s too soon, or too much, but I’d like to hold you as I sleep ~yoi.”</p>
<p>She looked startled, staring up at him with those big green eyes of hers before finally giving him a nod of agreement, “Alright, alright I’ll stay with you. You’re right it does seem fast, but I wasn’t exaggerating earlier when I said you make me feel safe, more than that being with you feels right, and I don’t know if it’s instinct, or strange soulmate magic, but…”</p>
<p>He nodded in understanding as she trailed off helplessly. He felt it too, the strange pull to be close to her, to have his hands on her, or at least his eyes on her at all times. Eventually it was something he’d have to let go of, if just a little or they’d drive each other crazy but for now it was good, it was right.</p>
<p>Standing there, holding her hands and staring into those fathomless eyes of hers, he was struck, not for the first time with the urge to kiss her. Luckily he tamped down on the desire quickly, because even with the strange pull it was too soon, he would have to take this carefully if he wanted to win her over, to convince her to stay, though it was hard to even think of moving slowly with the looming threat of her staying on the Soulmate Island in the near future.</p>
<p>Still his more reasonable mind won out and instead of kissing her said, “Alright, let’s see about getting you settled for the night.”</p>
<p>She nodded and allowed him to lead her by the hand back to his cabin. It was a decent sized room, and because he was a Division Commander, actually had its own attached bathroom, which she quickly slipped away into shutting the door behind herself.</p>
<p>He was just glad he was relatively tidy by nature otherwise this could’ve been embarrassing. After all how was he supposed to know when he left the room a few days ago that he’d be returning with his soulmate in tow? He took the few moments she was in the bathroom to tidy up a few things that were laying around, and then turned to the bed and frowned.</p>
<p>The sheets were clean, having been changed recently, the problem was what he was going to wear since she would be sleeping in the bed with him. Normally he slept without anything on at all, but he knew she wasn’t nearly ready for that kind of thing yet.</p>
<p>In the end he simply stripped out of his shirt, sash, belt and shoes, leaving his loose pants on. They were comfortable enough that they probably wouldn’t bother him too much.</p>
<p>The sound of the bathroom door opening again had him glancing up, and he was surprised to see that she’d somehow changed into a tank top and shorts, and her hair had been freed from its remaining pins, and then braided to the side. She looked sweet, and soft and extremely appealing but something was bugging him.</p>
<p>“Where were you keeping those clothes?” he asked curiously, “And where did you put what you had on.”</p>
<p>With a smirk she pulled out the necklace she’d showed him earlier that had her broom on it, and indicated another one of the trinkets attached, a small trunk, that like the broom had probably been shrunk down for convenience sake. He was glad she hadn’t come to this world and lost all her things, though that she carried them around on her person spoke to volumes of paranoia he hadn’t really comprehended up until now.</p>
<p>However it was too late at night to think about those sorts of things, and he suddenly realized he was exhausted. He hadn’t actually slept in days, not since Fawkes had left.</p>
<p>Sitting on the bed he shifted so he could lay down, leaving her the space on the outer edge, so she wouldn’t feel trapped between him and the wall, holding the covers up in invitation. Cautiously she settled down on to it, giving him a slightly nervous look before settling in, allowing herself to lay back as he dropped the covers over her, placing her head on one of the pillows.</p>
<p>She stiffened for a minute as Marco leaned over her to blow out the lamp that he’d lit when they’d entered for them to see by, but relaxed as he settled back and away from her again. The bed was actually big enough that they could sleep without touching, and so he lay back, closing his eyes as he tried to drift off to sleep.</p>
<p>Unfortunately his mind didn’t seem to want to shut off, buzzing around everything that had happened today, and constantly reminding him that his soulmate, <em>his soulmate</em> was there, in the bed with him, and actually laying within arms reach. It was a lot to take in, considering just that morning he’d thought they’d never meet, combined with all the extra things she brought along with being his soulmate and it was little wonder he couldn’t bring himself to sleep despite being exhausted.</p>
<p>Honestly the whole day felt a bit like a dream, and despite the childishness of it, he was maybe a little afraid to fall asleep, lest he wake and find she’d disappeared. He knew it was ridiculous, but the situation was so surreal he couldn’t seem to stop himself.</p>
<p>After several long moments of trying to fall asleep and failing muffled cursing reached his ears, and he shifted, glancing over at his bedmate. She was laying on her side with her back to him and her shoulders were hunched around her ears.</p>
<p>“Are you alright ~yoi?” he asked carefully, watching as her back stiffened in surprise.</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” she informed him, then sighed, “I just… could you just… hold me?”</p>
<p>He was taken aback by the softly spoken request but more than willing. Shifting himself around he reached out, and carefully eased her compliant body backwards until she was rested in the curve of his body, one arm slung around her small waist and the other pillowed under her head. She was warm and soft and perfect in his arms as she settled in close.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she whispered quietly, “I don’t know why, but being like this with you, makes me feel safe.”</p>
<p>“My pleasure,” he told her, gently squeezing her, “Really, anytime ~yoi.”</p>
<p>She hummed softly in acknowledgment and went quiet. Strangely with her in his arms his thoughts went quiet too, and he could feel nothing but contentment as he drifted to sleep surprisingly quickly, knowing she’d be there again in the morning.</p>
