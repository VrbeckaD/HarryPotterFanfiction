    <p>Things rarely go to plan when working with magical creatures, Newt has found over the years.</p><p>After a day of gathering field research and making notes on the local creatures, Newt went to his rented room for the evening. It was a small wizarding village and he was grateful to not have to both hiding his magic. Not that he minded a great deal but it was simply convenient. He opened up the door to his room and he stopped short to find someone waiting inside.</p><p>A very handsome man with a charming smile. Newt felt heat pool in his belly immediately, he was very good looking and his eyes locked on Newt like he was the only thing that mattered. Newt was almost immediately sure this man was an incubus, one of the very creatures he had come to Romania to study. </p><p>“M-May I help you?” Newt managed to ask, perhaps there was a mix up with the rooms but it felt unlikely. Newt had spent the last week asking the locals about the magical creatures that coexisted with them. He had given a special interest in incubi and succubi, hoping to learn more about the mysterious and widely feared beings.</p><p>“I heard you talking today,” the man said, his voice low and smooth, mesmerizing in a way. “In the market about the incubi, wanting to learn about them, you said.”</p><p>“Yes,” Newt agreed hastily, adjusting his wrist sleeve awkwardly and hoping to coax this creature into talking to him. “I’m writing a book you see, and I would like to write the facts rather than the lore.”</p><p>“Most books are about how to kill creatures,” a frown pulled on the man’s face and he looked out the window he was standing at. “More would hunt and harm rather than learn.”</p><p>“Well, I hope to change that. To educate my fellow wizards and make them see we should be living peacefully with creatures, rather than out to harm them.”</p><p>The stranger looked at Newt again, as if he could see right into him and know if he meant what he said.</p><p>After a moment he seemed pleased and smiled warmly, making Newt feel that heat edge up his spine, his whole body feeling distinctly…warm.</p><p>“Are you sure you’re not the incubus? You’re very pretty,” the stranger teased, voice low and seductive.</p><p>Newt laughed weakly, looking down in embarrassment while the man crossed the room. He reached just passed Newt’s head and tipped the door to the room the last inch closed, the lock clicking automatically.</p><p>Now, Newt wasn’t the sort to be sleeping with just anyone. He wasn’t that type at all really. His experiences in sex were very few and mostly with him fumbling and feeling like a fool.</p><p>The stranger never told Newt his name but he did lay Newt down on the bed and make his body feel amazing. Newt hadn’t realized how good sex could be, how much he could experience and how high carnal pleasure could take him.</p><p>At some point, the incubus stopped hiding its form, but Newt was far too gone to even think straight, much less comment on it. He had long dark horns but surprisingly no wings. His eyes were golden and glowing. His skin around his hands and feet faded from a tanned brown into a magical blue-black, as if he had dipped them into something dark. He had claws but never used them. His feet were different, Newt knew that much but he never got a clear look at them, too distracted. The creature had Newt over and over, taking him and spilling in him, licking Newt’s neck and telling him lovely he looked spread out on the bed.</p><p>The incubus kissed wet and deep, his tongue was rather long Newt thought. But it felt marvellous. It felt all so delightful, every touch was perfect. Newt shivered as he came and whimpered for more, unable to do anything but want more.</p><p>Newt doesn’t know exactly when he lost consciousness. One moment he was kissing and being rutted into and the next moment he was waking up alone in the room.</p><p>Newt whimpered out pitifully, everything hurt, his poor body aching. The light from the window making his head throb and he clenched his eyes closed to avoid it. His thighs and backside burning in pain as he reached out blindly for his coat. His magic brought it to his fingers and inside his right pocket was an emergency potion. Newt took it quickly and then sighed out as the pain receded.</p><p>Newt relaxed into the pillow under his head slowly, feeling the potion work until the pounding in his head was more bearable. It felt like a very intense hangover and Newt wondered if he had been drained by the incubus. He tired to catalogue the sensations to record them later. He now had first-hand experience to work from. </p><p> </p><p>Something made a soft sound and Newt’s eyes flew open as he jerked up into a sitting position. He had been sure he was alone in the room; it was small with nowhere to hide.</p><p>The bottom part of the bed was a mess of blood.</p><p>Newt suddenly understood why his body ached so badly.</p><p>There was an infant between his knees, sleeping softly, cord still attached to an afterbirth between Newt’s thighs.</p><p>He had no idea where exactly the baby came out of and he doesn’t want to know right at that moment as the shock settled over him.</p><p>Fighting down panic, Newt reached for his wand. He cleaned the gory mess absently and brought over a clean towel to wrap the baby in. It was very clearly an incubus. A little male with tiny horns and a long thin tail. His little hands and feet have the same skin, fading into the blue-black at the tips. His feet were different too, more joints then a human with four long toes rather than human feet. He had dark hair and on his forehead are two little horn bumps.</p><p>Newt swallowed weakly and realized he was very much out of his depth.</p><p>He had no idea how to care for this tiny life in his hands, feeling so fragile and innocent in his careful grip. Newt had raised newborn creatures and orphans before but this felt like far more.</p><p>The stories of incubi were varied, some people casting such dark light on the poor creatures and others recalling them fondly. There was little known about them, some rumors suggested the succubi and incubi was a single being, able to change genders. How would he deal with such a thing? What would this baby need to grow strong and healthy?</p><p>There were some who claimed to have carried a half-breed child in the area. But Newt had looked into that as well but found the children all perfectly human. He did know better than to say that, nervous mothers who were supposed to have been virgins. Holding a true incubi babe proved his suspicions correct.</p><p>That was the problem at the heart of the matter though.</p><p>A lot of people blamed the creatures and claimed they saw them to cover more… carnal affairs with other people. So what was the truth and what was lies was rather hard to dissect for these unique creatures. Newt abruptly wondered if this was how the incubi last night had decided to educate him, by giving him an incubi child to raise. But with the information so varied and little proven, Newt wasn't sure he could take care of this little life. </p><p>The child snuffled and slowly woke up, taking Newt’s full attention once more. Golden eyes peer up at Newt, wide and blameless as the baby cooed at him in innocuous delight.</p><p>“H-Hello,” Newt whispered and gathered the baby closer to him, wrapping him more up snugly as a tiny hand curl around one of his fingers. The baby sucked his own thumb, holding his head up and looking at Newt with curiosity. The child was more advanced than a human newborn, more alert with more motor control Newt observed.</p><p>Newt’s child whimpered and reached out, spit smeared hands stretching for him and his heart thumped painfully as he brought the baby to his chest awkwardly but gently. He cradled him as he had seen mothers do before.</p><p>“Oh, hello little darling,” Newt finally whispered softly, as if talking too loud would break the moment.</p><p>Something like awe settling over him. </p><p>The baby turned his little head and nuzzled Newt’s bare skin. He was still nude he realized and the baby latched onto a nipple.</p><p>“Nothing there I’m afraid,” he chuckled and then startled a bit at the wet sensation. Then he blinked at the very odd feeling of…something. The baby pulled off and smacked his lips, milk bubbling on his lips as he latched again.</p><p>Newt was lactating.  </p><p>His chest looked the same, his other nipple looked normal but he could feel it, felt the baby nursing.</p><p>The child he delivered in a single night.</p><p>Despite being a man.</p><p>Clearly, the lore on the incubus was vastly underwhelming compared to the truth.</p><p>A tail curled around Newt’s wrist, holding tightly as the baby drank contently, blinking his golden eyes up at Newt. As if imprinting on him, looking up at his mother as Newt peered looked back down and felt his heart make room for this new life. </p><p>“I suppose I’m your mummy, my little darling.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mummy!” Percival wailed out and Newt felt that kneejerk reaction for the alarm in his son’s tone. Newt left the nundu enclosure and scanned for the boy, trying to calm the fear in him that something terrible had occurred.</p><p>Percival appeared, unharmed, but sobbing as he hurried to Newt and reached out to him, wanting to be picked up. Newt never could resist and scooped up his son, letting him cling close. Percival was a very tactile child and seemed to have some sort of magical power involving empathy, sensing emotions in others. When he was upset, the only thing that could calm him was to be hugged close by a composed Newt. He seemed to take that emotion into himself and use it to calm as well. Newt had learned a great deal about controlling his emotions these last few months in order to be there for his son. Percival’s little hand reached out and rested on Newt’s cheek, taking comfort in skin contract. The boy hiccupped a sob and his tears slowed, eventually, he began to quiet as Newt rocked him and kissed his hair and cute little horns.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” He asked when Percival seemed collected enough to answer. The lovely thing about Percival’s empathy was that he could project it as well, when they had skin contact, Newt could feel Percival’s emotions faintly. The boy was still distressed but much calmer now. He wasn’t hurt physically but something had troubled him terribly.</p><p>“I touched Frank,” Percival admitted miserably and Newt’s heart constricted in reaction. His poor boy.</p><p>Percival could feel other’s pain, could feel their fear and their agony.</p><p>Frank was an amazing thunderbird Newt had recently rescued and he was in terrible condition, feathers ripped out and used for potions, bits of his skin cut away, deeply embedded wounds from chains and half starved.</p><p>Newt’s heart hurt to see the magnificent beast so injured and that Percival had felt any measure of that made him hug his child much tighter. Newt had been researching frantically but he didn’t know if Percival would ever learn to control this ability. Or if he was both blessed and doomed to feel everything each time he touched a living creature.</p><p>“You must be careful love, you feel so much,” Newt gently cautioned. Percival was trembling too much for him to truly scold.</p><p>Newt thought of good things, of the first time Percival fed the mooncalves and his first wobbling steps on shaky feet, looking back to make sure Newt was there with him still. The soothing memories brought serenity and Percival sagged into it, sighing against Newt’s neck.</p><p>Pickett the bowtruckle clucked in worry, poking out of Newt’s shirt pocket.</p><p>Other creatures were looking too, checking that Percival was ok.</p><p>He had an amazing relationship with them, feeling them and bonding with them on a wonderful level. Percival had taught Newt so much about magical creatures, just by relaying their emotions.</p><p>“M’ok,” Percival whispered to Pickett and the bowtruckle chirped in relief.</p><p>“Why don’t we go and finish feeding Margret? She’ll be happy to see you, her little cub,” Newt teased and Percival giggled as he wiped at his tears. The nundu adored Percival and thought him her own young. Licking him to clean him every time she saw him and trying to share her food, always doting and endeared to him.</p><p>“I’m your cub though, right?”</p><p>Newt smiled.</p><p>“Of course, my darling boy,” Newt let his emotions run free, all the love he felt for his special little boy. Percival sighed, curling into the sensation of love as Newt carried him to the enclosure.</p><p> </p><p>“Bastard,” Percival snarled, scrambling after Edgar the niffler. “Give it back!”</p><p>Newt fought a fond smile as he measured the feeds into buckets and listened to the ruckus behind him. Percival chased the niffler across the open areas, the little beast scrambling frantically. Who knew what he had stolen but Percival wasn’t one to be bested. He would hunt the niffler for days, had done so, setting harmless traps and spending hours thinking of ways to get him. It was honestly good exercise for them both.</p><p>Percival was growing so quickly and he needed to burn his energy, the suitcase beginning to feel tight with a wild boy running through it.</p><p>Five months since the day he was born, he looked like an adolescent and his mind was developing just as fast. He devoured education, read books and could recite them line for line after one read. Newt had made a notice-me-not charm for his son, so he could take him to libraries and let him read as he pleased.</p><p>Percival was wary of people but also fascinated with them, sitting on benches and watching for hours. He was learning to read them like his books, developing a unique ability to see into a person, to see the good and bad in them like marks on their skin. He learned that more slowly, taking his time. With common education, he was always eager for more, never satisfied until he knew everything there was to know.</p><p>So they also went to museums and art galleries, cultural events and religious places, everywhere Newt could think of where he could learn, he took Percival. They had been all over Europe as well, travelling from place to place while living in the suitcase. It was depleting Newt’s savings but worth it to see Percival learning so much and delighted with it all. He had fun like any child would, playing and learning games, but it was clear he had a passion for knowledge that Newt did his best to feed.  </p><p>Percival looked to Newt often for answers, utterly believing whatever he told him. It put a great deal of pressure on Newt, to carefully think his answers through before he said them. He understood now, the heavy weight of being a parent, of shaping a young innocent mind.</p><p>Percival was very adaptive as well, reacting quickly and keeping his wits. Always able to blend in no matter where they were. He could eat meat cooked or raw, or just vegetables alone, his diet seemed to be whatever was available.</p><p>His touch empathy remained very powerful but he did have a measure of control over it now, able to draw away from others enough to treat wounds and the like. Skin on skin let him feel and project emotions. He was fast and stronger than a human, very intelligent and able to think on his feet.</p><p>Just recently he had learned to make himself look human. It was an illusion, something he was projecting without actually changing himself. But Newt’s magic couldn’t sense it at all. No magical detection devices could either.</p><p>Percival, thankfully, seemed to come into his powers on instinct has he grew, his body just learning new things similar to walking and talking. There was no need for a guide to teach him. Newt was utterly grateful for those instincts has he had no real idea how to help as Percival discovered powers Newt hadn’t even known he would have.</p><p>“Are you ready?” Percival asked, suddenly right there watching Newt sort the food out. Newt didn’t start anymore but he was caught off guard still. Percival could move without a sound, could slip through crowds without touching anyone, his control really was precise. He’s given Newt a weak heart when he vanished as a boy.</p><p>“Almost done,” Newt reassured as Percival stepped in close and hugged Newt’s back to his chest. He was just tall enough to rest his chin on Newt’s shoulder and had preened for days when he realized it. So he let his son wrap around him, fingers worming under his shirt for skin contact as Newt worked. They had gotten good at this, Newt working with Percival curled up around him contently.</p><p>“I want to see festival lights when the sun goes down,” Percival reminded absently, watching Newt’s hands work. “The woman in the market said it was amazing to see.”</p><p>Newt hummed in agreement. He had seen this festival before and it was indeed lovely to watch the lanterns being lit. He divided the food up with care but did hurry a bit so they could go and find a good spot to watch everything.</p><p>He could feel Percival’s eagerness but also his happiness right where they were, standing close and working in the tranquil of the suitcase. Percival loved to see things but in the end, he always wanted to return home, into the suitcase where he felt the safest. Newt had to agree, it had come to feel like home to him as well.</p><p> </p><p>“Show me,” Newt demanded, voice breathless and a touch desperate as Percival growled at his own carelessness but let Newt pry his hands from his side. He was slashed but not too deep, nothing deadly and Newt let out a breath, his shoulders drooping in relief. He slumped carefully against his grown son and thanked the heavens he was going to be fine. </p><p>“I messed up, this is all my fault,” Percival grumbled and Newt reached a hand out, cupping Percival’s face and letting him feel that Newt blamed him in no way.</p><p>They had been out late and Percival had been practising holding his human illusion. He had been doing so well and it was flawless really. Newt should have known better though, to push the length of time he held it in such a dangerous area. They were out in the country lands, in an isolated area were Catholic religion ruled over all. Percival had lost his focus and his true form had shown. People had immediately screamed devil and they had been forced to run away from the village on foot. Thank Merlin, Newt had been carrying the case with him and not left it in some hotel.</p><p>Now they were safe, deep in a forest were no muggle would be able to catch up, much less find them.</p><p>Percival had been hurt in the chase but it wasn’t something Newt couldn’t treat. Resting a hand gently on the cut to keep pressure, Newt hugged him tightly with his other arm. Percival was sitting on a large boulder and Newt sagged down so he was kneeling between his thighs, clutching him close still.</p><p>“As long as you’re ok,” Newt breathed against Percival’s chest. “Darling, they would have accused me just as fast if they saw me use magic. Human’s fear what they don’t understand.”</p><p>Newt could feel Percival’s bitter self-disgust, knowing he was different from others.</p><p>“I think you are lovely and we are all singular in some way. It’s a good thing I believe.”</p><p>“Why must I hide from wizards and witches as well then?”</p><p>Newt sighed out, pressing his brow again Percival’s chest and feeling his son’s arms encircle and hug him, Percival’s chin resting in Newt’s hair.</p><p>“Because they would see what you are before they saw you for who you are. Magical Creatures are second-class citizens, beasts before people. They’re wrong of course, terribly wrong, but they won’t listen. If they knew, they would treat you less and I couldn’t stand it.”</p><p>“So I’ll hide forever?”</p><p>“I will change it, one day,” Newt promised and meant it so utterly. “I’m going to write books and make people understand. That you are just as much a person as they are. That you deserve everything they do.”</p><p>“I don’t care about that,” Percival muttered. “I just want to walk with you, be beside you always.”</p><p>“I can promise you that much then, I’ve never been ashamed to be beside you and I never will. I only fear for your safety.” Newt assured and he could feel Percival smile into his hair, his happiness bleeding through his pain at being rejected by others.</p><p>“I only need you mum,” Percival rumbled and Newt could feel that he spoke truthfully.</p><p> </p><p>“What does sex feel like?”</p><p>Newt nearly dropped his quill in surprise but managed to keep hold of it. Percival was laid out on their shared bed, staring at the roof while Newt went over notes at his desk. It had only been a few weeks since they were run out of town and they had been staying close to one another.</p><p>Percival was at the right development state, Newt supposed, glancing over at him. He looked similar to his sire, tall and broad. Appearing in his mid-twenties despite being barely a year old. He had filled out but never managed to get taller than Newt, much to his annoyance. His horns were higher than Newt though, reaching up and curving back from his brow. His body was lithe and strong and he had mastered it so well so fast. He could control his body to a level that humans could not, his balance was remarkable and his core strength extraordinary. Percival could walk on his hands without any effort and scale up trees as if merely running. Newt wondered if it had to do with his tail perhaps, adding a balance of some sort. </p><p>Either way, Percival was a sleek and powerful creature.</p><p>Very handsome as well.</p><p>Even with his glamour to hide it showed through. Many women flirted with him when they went out in public. Plenty of men as well. All of them drawn in by that easy smile. Percival had a bit of a predator around him as well, seeming in control and confident in all he did and people gravitated to him for it.</p><p>Newt supposed it made sense that Percival would take an interest in sex.</p><p>He was an incubus after all, Newt should be glad he hadn’t been curious about it as a child. He had a theory that it wasn’t the actual sex but skin contact that incubi sought. Percival seemed to gain something from Newt simply by holding him. His energy renewed in a way that was more than just normal. As if Percival was drawing strength from touching Newt. He never felt worse for it either, never felt drained or tired that he noticed. Newt’s health remained strong and he was hoping to prove succubus and incubus did not, in fact, drain life. He had learned so much about the creatures and he was confident he could write a passage on them that was positive and encouraging.</p><p>Although he was admittedly a little lacking in their sexual behaviour.</p><p>“It’s different with each person,” Newt began, trying to think of a proper way to explain sex to someone whose kind was known for it.</p><p>“It can be very emotional and loving, very personal and deep. Or it can be more carnal and less knowing. Some strangers meet and sleep together and never see one another ever again. Others meet and court and wait until they marry for life and have sex only after. Honestly, human sexuality is very wrapped up in morals in most places. But sex feels good, it’s a pleasurable act.”</p><p>“Like what?” Percival was watching Newt keenly. As far as Newt knew, Percival hadn’t discovered masturbation. Perhaps Newt should explain that and let him explore. But Percival never wanted to learn things on his own, always wanting a teacher, always hands on. He had never shown any signs either, never asked these questions before.</p><p>Newt flushed a touch.</p><p>“It’s a base act, like a massage a bit, you rather like those?”</p><p>Percival nodded.</p><p>With his rapid growth, his body cramped and ached terribly. Newt had gotten into the habit of giving him a good rub down and Percival utterly adored it. All the skin on skin contact seemed to leave him blissed out at the end. His sore joints relaxed and the pain in them soothed for a bit.</p><p>“It’s hard to explain sex. It feels good but it’s also more, in its own unique way.”</p><p>“Have you had lots of sex, mum?”</p><p>Newt flushed harder and shook his head in negative.</p><p>“Honestly, not very much. A few times with a woman, a few with a man and the night with your sire. I do like sex, but for me, it’s very intimate. I’ve only slept with people I loved, with the exceptions of your father. But everyone is different.”</p><p>Newt had loved all the people he had laid with, unfortunately, in the end, they had all left him. Newt was an oddity and he knew it, travelling the world and not interested in settling when others wanted too. Not that the blame was never his own, when pushed he had made choices of his own. Picking his work and creatures over budding relationships and losing loved ones for that decision. Newt had thought he might never marry and now with Percival, he was more certain he wouldn't. His son was all he needed, he had chased away that loneliness in Newt and left him content in a way he had never been before. Newt would be happy to stay with his child and when Percival was ready to leave him he would be fine with letters and visits. Newt loved his family but he knew the love he had for Percival sat atop all others. A mother's love.  </p><p>“People you love,” Percival repeated, pondering on it with a thoughtful expression.</p><p>“It means more, I find.” Newt added, not mentioning that the best sex he had ever had was with Percival’s sire. But then, he was an incubus and it was clear they had sexual prowess. Even Percival was seductive without trying, something about him just alluring in that base way.</p><p>“There is no real wrong way to go about it, as long as both people are willing.”</p><p>Percival nodded, his eyes keen in a way that spoke of months of research ahead. Newt resolved to get his son books on sex from various perspectives. To encourage him however Percival needed, he still might need sex to live one day, after all.</p><p> </p><p>Newt began to wake with morning erections.</p><p>Percival and Newt still slept together, pressed close with minimum clothing so there was as much skin contact as Newt could give. Percival cherished the touch and it was clear he slept better with it. So as he grew, Newt never suggested they try separate beds, knowing Percival would be against it.</p><p>He charmed the bed a bit bigger as Percival grew and they slept together still, curled up tightly every night.</p><p>So waking up erect was obviously an issue.</p><p>Percival was not a heavy sleeper either. If Newt shifted to get up, he would wake.</p><p>Currently, Newt was laid out his back and Percival was on his side facing him, head pillowed on Newt’s chest, his one horn gently resting on Newt’s throat.</p><p>Swallowing, Newt stared up at the roof and willed his body to obey his commands.</p><p>Thankfully it went away before Percival woke.</p><p>But the next morning he woke the same way. Pressed stomach down onto the bed, he could feel his cock hard and needy.</p><p>Percival was curled up against him, eyes closed but his tail was slithering up Newt’s bare calf lazily, signalling he was awake.</p><p>“Is it late?” Newt yawned and Percival shook his head.</p><p>“Be a dear and start tea?” Of the two of them, Newt was the one to be slow to get up so it wasn’t unusual for him to ask Percival to begin breakfast. Smirking, Percival butted Newt’s shoulder playfully and then climbed over him to get up and out of bed.</p><p>Once he left the small room, Newt reached down and pressed a hand to his cock, willing it away.</p><p> </p><p>It kept happening, near misses mixed with horrid shame.</p><p>Because Newt knew why he was getting erect. There was no doubt in his mind, no denial available.</p><p>Percival was gorgeous.</p><p>Newt’s body didn’t seem to care that it was his son.</p><p>Percival just hummed with sexual energy and Newt was responding to it. He was reacting to Percival draped over him every night, snuggled close wearing nothing but his tight sleeping his pants that were cut high on his muscular thighs. Bare skin warm against Newt’s own.</p><p>It was perverse and Newt cursed himself each morning. He began searching for spells of impotence. Trying to find something to ease his lust and help him stop this disgraceful reaction. Perhaps he simply needed to find someone to sate it with. It had been a long time since he engaged in sex. Percival’s sire had been a single night and it had been years before that. Newt never felt a strong urge towards carnal relations though. This was recent and he wondered if it was linked to the fact that Percival was half incubus and in his prime it seemed. Either way, it needed to be controlled.</p><p>In desperation, Newt thought perhaps a wank was in order. He hadn’t since he was a young boy but maybe it would help ease the urges.</p><p>So he sent Percival off one morning to try and collect the niffler for a fabricated check-up, a chore that would take an hour at best. Newt did need to make sure the little beast wasn’t carrying mites or any sort of parasites he supposed. It got out so often, it would be the one to bring them back.</p><p>Once Percival was gone for a bit, Newt left his work desk and sat on the bed, undoing his trousers. He unbuttoned his union suit and pulled his cock free. </p><p>Closing his eyes, Newt tried to imagine past lovers, the things about them he had liked. He stroked himself as he pictured their bodies and then the incubus that had impregnated him. Newt tried to recall the feelings of that night, the lust and desire driving him in a way it had never done before. He had been noisy, moaning out and begging for more as the man loomed over him, smirking down and enjoying it all.</p><p>Newt bit his lip and ran his free hand up his thigh, thinking of how it felt to be opened up and taken. He rather liked being fucked, liked that his body could give such pleasure to someone. Newt’s cock came around, filling out as he recalled the details. The way the incubus had bitten at his neck as he fucked into him.</p><p>His hand tightened a bit and he gave the tip a good squeeze, feeling it run through his whole body, pleasure singing.</p><p>A hand on his knee made Newt jerked back, eyes flying open as he attempted to cover himself.</p><p>Percival was there.</p><p>Kneeling in front of him, the niffler on the desk with a charmed bit of gold that refused to go into its pouch and had it thoroughly distracted. Percival was kneeling and sitting back on his legs, he had to have been there for a few moments at least. He could move so soundlessly; it had been foolish to try this Newt thought.  </p><p>“S-Sorry,” Newt breathed, face burning red but Percival was staring at his cock, head tipped to the side curiously. Newt fumbled, trying to stuff himself back into his trousers and Percival’s hand took his wrists to stop him. His grip wasn’t harsh but he was so much stronger than Newt.</p><p>“What does it mean?” Percival whispered and Newt stared at him a moment. A horrid feeling filled him as he realized Percival had no real base education on sex. Nothing beyond the way that reproduction worked and a very rudimentary idea of intercourse.</p><p>“It’s…I’m erect,” Newt muttered, feeling his face burn so badly as he pushed through his embarrassment to give his son answers. “A human man will become erect when he’s sexually stimulated.”</p><p>Percival made a note of understanding, shifting and Newt realized he was hard as well, his cock pressing against his trousers. He wondered how long it had been happening and why Percival hadn’t told him of it. He never kept things from Newt.</p><p>“What were you doing?”</p><p>“M-Masturbating, it’s a form of sexual relief.”</p><p>Percival blinked, looking surprised and then intrigued.</p><p>“Will you show me?” He requested, utterly innocent and Newt ignored his own shame. Percival should know these things, should have known them a while ago.</p><p>“Of course,” Newt replied, running a hand through his hair nervously. “It’s…it’s very easy really. You just take hold and stimulate yourself. The friction, you see,” Newt explained weakly. He managed to give his cock a few strokes in demonstration.</p><p>Percival opened his own trousers, watching Newt’s hand closely and digging himself out of his underclothing.</p><p>He was very large.</p><p>It made sense, incubus and all.</p><p>His cock was thick and long, hard already with the head dripping a touch.</p><p>Newt watched Percival try to replicate the motion, his hand sliding up and then down.</p><p>“It doesn’t feel like anything,” Percival frowned, looking down and watching his hand move as he tried again.</p><p>“The friction, should be…nice.” Newt bit his lip, unable to look away as his son stroked his large cock, up and down, his hand curling around the fat thing.</p><p>Percival made an unhappy noise and shifted, his hand coming to clutch Newt’s knee as he spread his own knees on the floor and tried again.</p><p>“Better?”</p><p>Percival shook his head, looking genuinely frustrated. Newt sighed out, leaning in a bit and Percival’s brow touched his chin.</p><p>“Close your eyes and focus, think of something that excites you sexually, makes you hard, a thought or idea.”</p><p>Percival obeyed, closing his eyes and pressing a touch closer, his warm breath against Newt’s throat.</p><p>“What am I doing wrong, mum?” he muttered, voice discouraged.</p><p>“Hush, you have to learn with time, like everyone else,” Newt reassured him.</p><p>Without thinking on all the reasons why he shouldn’t, Newt reached out. Poised on the edge of the low bed with Percival kneeling right before him, it was easy to reach down and rest his hand over Percival’s own. Newt showed him how to stroke, building an easy rhythm and Percival’s breath finally hitched in a telling way.</p><p>He could feel the pleasure coursing through Percival. His empathy sharing this new sensation. Percival had never masturbated clearly and was enraptured with the new feeling.</p><p>“Better now?”</p><p>Percival nodded. He swallowed and shifted a bit closer to Newt. His long fingers pulled away and slid back over Newt’s hand, pressing his own fingers to the length of Percival’s cock, Percival’s hand covering Newt’s now.</p><p>Fighting terrible urges, Newt let him. He stroked his son’s cock, gripping it more firmly and gliding with the ease of experience. He twisted his wrist at the tip to run the head of Percival’s cock over his palm.</p><p>Percival moaned out in reaction, a low sound that rumbled through his chest. He dipped forward, head resting on Newt’s shoulder as his free hand curled around Newt’s hip and gripped onto his shirt like he had as a child. He clung to Newt, shivering as his hips began to push into the motions of his mother’s hand.</p><p>It felt good, Newt’s mind trying to understand the pleasure washing over him that wasn’t his own.</p><p>“That’s it,” Newt breathed, pressing his cheek to the side of Percival’s head, over his ear, and holding him close as he stroked him a bit faster. “It’s all about sensations, about the feel of your hand and the grip. Some people use oil to make it move easier as well.”</p><p>Percival hummed in a way that said he wasn’t hearing a word of what Newt was saying. It was so reminiscent of when Newt rubbed his back that he smiled a bit, endeared.</p><p>“Mum,” Percival gasped out, hand clutching Newt’s waist tighter as Percival rose up.</p><p>He went from sitting on his heels to up onto his knees. Newt had to spread his thighs to accommodate as Percival kept hugging him close. He jerked when Percival’s cock brushed against his own. His exposed prick somehow forgotten.</p><p>His grip loosened on his son’s erection and immediately Percival’s hand was pressing him back, gripping at his fingers to keep him holding on. Newt could feel the worried rush to keep him there and so he resumed his motions. </p><p>“It’s good, feels so good,” Percival said, voice soft and hitched, a bit of wonder to his tone.</p><p>“Sexual pleasure,” Newt explained quietly in return. He looked down, watching his hand continue to work the long thick cock. Percival was very well endowed, it showed more when his cock was close to Newt’s own. It seemed small and delicate in comparison and he had always thought he was average.</p><p>“Like this?”</p><p>Percival’s hand reached out and took a loose hold of Newt’s cock. His fingers curled around the length and began to mimic Newt’s motions.</p><p>It felt amazing, better than his own hand had ever felt before. How had Percival not felt good under his own hand, when he gripped and moved over Newt so perfectly. </p><p>Newt nodded weakly, face burning as he dropped it to Percival’s shoulder and hid away.</p><p>His hand kept moving through, picking up pace and Percival followed him moving faster as well. Anything he did, his son tried to replicate.</p><p>Percival’s chest began to rise and drop faster, his breath catching as his hips swayed. Newt could feel him beginning to twitch in his hand, his fingers running over the vein along the underside and feeling it pulse. Percival was close. </p><p>“Mum,” Percival sounded a touch panicked and Newt pressed him closer, their knuckles bumping as they both worked steadily.</p><p>“That’s it, sweetheart, it’s alright,” Newt soothed as Percival hissed out, dropping his chin on Newt’s shoulder, his free hand still clutching at Newt’s side tightly, holding on to steady himself. The pleasure was building up now, rising to a climax and Percival was loving it but overwhelmed as well. Pushing his emotions onto Newt as he whined out and thrust into his mother’s warm tight hand.</p><p>“Don’t fight it, just enjoy it,” he coaxed and Percival shuddered.</p><p>With a loud gasp, he came finally. His own hand stopped on Newt’s cock but he didn’t mind, stroking Percival steadily through his first orgasm, moving his wrist and using everything he had to make it good.</p><p>Percival came in long spurts, white creamy semen splattering on Newt’s shirt and running down his hand and forearm. Newt moaned out as well, the pleasure going too high for him not to come as well. It echoed through him, Percival’s climax roaring through them both and pushing them over together. His own cock laid in his lap, spitting semen as Newt gasped out.</p><p>All too soon, Percival slumped forward and panting for breath and trembling in the aftermath of his first sexual experience.</p><p>Newt curled his free arm around his son’s shoulders, noting absently that they had gotten so broad. He hushed his child, rocking him a bit until Percival caught his breath and his shaking slowed and stopped. Newt felt just as shaken as Percival was projecting, this new pleasure going between them, wonder of how good such a simple thing could feel.</p><p>“Could you be a dear,” Newt requested, pulling back slowly. “And fetch me a warm wet cloth to clean this up?” Newt had gotten most of it, on his hand and arm, along his thigh and up his shirt, long streaks of come clung to him. It was a surprising amount.   </p><p>Percival nodded and went readily to get it. Newt could feel the echoing of his contentment, his happiness of this shared experience. </p><p>Newt waited until he was gone before he slumped back onto the bed. Running his clean hand through his hair and then covering his face with his forearm, shame burning through him.</p><p>It had been so amazing.</p><p>It was clear Percival would want to explore more and expected Newt to be his teacher.</p><p>“This is a fine mess,” he whispered to himself softly.</p>
