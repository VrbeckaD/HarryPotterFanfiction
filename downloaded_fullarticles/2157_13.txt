</p><p> </p><p>In July 1899 a 44 year old pure-blooded English-Bulgarian wizard named Gellert Grindelwald was on a quest to become immortal, to gather the three relics of the “Deathly Hallows” the Elder Wand, the Stone of resurrection and the cloak of invisibility, since that would make him the "Master of Death " and he would be the most powerful wizard of all time in any kind of magic. In his past teenaged days he was educated in Durmstrang Institute of Magic known for its pitiful inclination to the dark arts, he was interested in the story since he was a 16 year old student at Durmstrang finding a book of The tales of Beedle the Barb in the library, in such a way reading it made him wonder if they really existed, tradition and powerful mysticism of magical artifacts.</p><p>Now in his adulthood still was fascinated by the relics of death, formerly belonging to the Peverell, and began a search that took him to Godric's Hallow, in England, where he had his only great grandmother the famous historian of magic Bathilda Bagshot who he had notified that he was going to stay there, in fact he really hasnt seen her since he was a child, it was really going to be awkward staying there when he finishes his quest, hopefully everthing can turn out okay, and avoid any problems there.</p><p>He was packing his stuff to leave first thing in the morning . That day came , the carriage was outside , he climbed into the carriage as he sat there he could see by the curtain curious faces by the windows peeping to were he was and demanded the driver to leave immediately, and so the horses started to move and gellert sighed in relief now that he was leaving the village .The 12 houred travel he slept in peace and was awakened when the driver informed him they were almost to Godrics Hallow , he stayed up thinking about what was the first thing he was gonna do when he gest there and wondering if Bathilda had a library full of books to find more information about the hallows.</p><p>He looked by the window and stared at the blue sky and lovely nature with living Green grass,trees,hills, animals and lakes of glittery pure wáter. He started to eat his food that brought along some peaches.</p><p>Gellert hoped to finish this journey and not let a simple thing hold him back even if it was a Insignificant creature or person that would try to question him ambitions to do with such things, he cant let anyone stop him now .</p><p>Soonly he arrived safe ad sound to the village Godrics Hallow getting off the carriage and paying the driver, suitcase in his hand he is still dumbfounded trying to figure out where is the house of Bagshot , thers a lot of houses and people walking around some minding thier own buisness and others taking some glances at him, for being a wizard that cante ven find the old house he doesnt feel amused , wondering if this place is fulled with witches and wizards or regular non magical people. He started walking through the streets alone glancing everywhere , it took some minutes until a person came up to him, a middle aged man with dark hair lanky and wobbly , “You must be Bathildas great nephew Gilbert right”? he said in a worried tone . Gellert looked him directly in the eye and said “Its Gellert…Gellert Grindelwald, and yes that i am, and you are”? said in a cold tone of his. “Oh great my bad mister Grindelwald, im Howard Spacek pleased to meet you i was told by misses Bagshot that you were going to come today, i will be honored to show you were her house is” he said in a cheerfull tone, “Please let me help you with that sir” he said pointing at the suitcase, Gellert gave it to him not saying a thankyou to the Young man, he walked in front of him while the youngster explained were the house was. As soon they found the old house with a lot of flowers and trees. Gellert faced to see Howard and thanked him for showing the way , Howard gave him the suitcase and responded to him in a nice tone clearly he was a happy boy. But gellert wasnt sure if he was a wizard or not but didnt mind discovering the secret. Gellert entered through the gate , walked to the front door of the house and knocked on it, seconds he tried to open the door but it was locked . He went around the house and saw a elderly woman from a distance carrying some Wood sticks in her hands she wasnt turna round to see him, so gellert left his suitcase and walked were she was .</p>
