    <p>'I can't believe I'm here! I can't believe that I'm actually attending Hogwarts! Ah! This'll be so awesome!</p>
<p>I mean, I get to attend Hogwarts after just learning about it! How many people get this opportunity? I'm going to assume not many!' </p>
<p>Is what Nathaniel Adams had been repeating in his mind for the last few days. Nathaniel (or Nate as he preferred to be called) was ecstatic at the idea of magic. And he couldn't believe he was a wizard. </p>
<p>Nate (as you could guess) is a Muggle born. He had been living with his two siblings, (an older brother and his younger sister) as his parents had divorced when he was younger. His father had gotten full custody of him and his siblings. Though, his father had suffered from a heart attack one day, after that his mother was never to be heard from again.</p>
<p>His older brother had turned into an adult 3 months before the death of their father. So, Alex (his brother) had adopted both Nate and his sister Scarlett. </p>
<p>The death took a toll on everyone, but more specifically Alex. Alex had a hard time as it is. He had gotten a scholarship to a very prestigious school in London, and studying, exams and much more started to chip away at his free time. So, to take care of school and his two siblings dug him into a hole filled with stress. </p>
<p>Nate had realised this. Nate had seen how exhausted his brother had become. So, he tried to make his brothers life more easier. He started doing chores, cooking his sister's and his own meals, nd he stopped asking for help from his brother. </p>
<p>It didn't matter to Nate if he, himself was exhausted. All that mattered was that Alex wasn't as stressed as use to be. That Alex was eating, that Alex was sleeping, that Alex was taking care of himself. </p>
<p>Anyway, we should get back on topic. </p>
<p>Nate is waiting at the station, nervously looking around him. As he does this, he thinks to himself. </p>
<p>'what if I'm not a good wizard? What if I'm unable to do magic? What is going to happen then? Will they just kick me out of Hogwarts? Oh jeez... This is so stressful' </p>
<p>Suddenly he hears exhales and inhales coming from next to him. As Nate turns his head, he sees a girl. </p>
<p>She has dark, chocolate brown hair that reaches her neck. her bangs basically hide her eyes from all. She's also wearing one of the Hogwarts robes. Her face though is one of the most interesting things about her. She has freckles that are littered over her cheeks and a small mole on the upper right of her lip. </p>
<p>As the girl stares up at Nate he then gets a glimpse at her eyes before they get covered by her bangs. They're quite a beautiful shade of violet, they're very eye catching. The girl quickly brushes her hair out of her eyes and uses a dark red hair clip to hold it up. </p>
<p>"haah, haah. H-hey! Sorry, I ran all the way... Here!" The girl finally lets out. "Oh! Sorry I haven't introduced myself, huh? Well, the names Gabriella Hornette! But, you can just call me Gabbie!" the girl (Gabbie as Nate now knows) shouts out in an enthusiastic voice. "H-Hi, Gabbie. My name is Nathaniel Adams. B-But you can just call me N-Nate" As you can tell, Nate is a very shy and socially awkward person. Gabbie is very much unlike Nate in this case. </p>
<p>"Well, hi Nate! Since you're the first person I've met, you're gonna be my bestest ever bestie of the whole land!" Gabbie said (till this day, Nate still ponders at the fact that Gabbie could say this in one try)</p>
<p>"Yeah, I hope we ar-" "OH GOD! C'mon Nate! We need to go into the train!" Gabbie interrupts Nate as she basically drags Nate into the Train. </p>
<p>Gabbie continues to pull Nate's arm, leading him through the train and making their way through the sea of Hogwarts students. </p>
<p>As Gabbie pulls Nate through the train, they struggle to find a compartment that's entirely empty or at least some what empty. As they make their way into one of the last compartments, (to their luck) it's basically empty. </p>
<p>Keyword. </p>
<p>Basically. </p>
<p>Sitting alone staring out the window is a boy. He seems so entrancing. His hair is dark balck. Though, it shines from the reflection of the Sun. He has snow, white, pale skin, without a single blemish to be found. But, the thing that really catches both the eyes of Gabbie and Nate (ironically) are the boy's eyes. </p>
<p>It's incredible. (the boy's eyes that is) It's obvious that this specific boy has heterochromia. His right eye is the bright colour of turquoise, while his left is the warm colour of green. Nate had heard about this. He didn't know much about heterochromia, but he was aware of the name, and what it is. </p>
<p>"Hello, what is it that you want?" The incredibly interesting boy asks without even glancing at the other two. "Huh?" Gabbie utters out, clearly also amazed by the boy. "O-Oh, we were wondering if we could sit here? All the other compartments are... Um... Taken?" Nate responds, hesitance crystal clear in his voice. </p>
<p>"Of course, you can sit here, Nathaniel. You can also sit here too, Gabriella. If that's what both of you wish" The boy says, now grabbing something that's laying at the side of him. It's a book, the familiar dark green catches Nate's eye. </p>
<p>"Oh! Is that 'Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them'?" "Yes, it is. Are you fond of magical beasts in any way?" The boy asks. "Yes, Well- I'm actually into animals as a whole. I've always enjoyed the company of animals, they've also been easier to speak with. 'Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them' is actually really the only book that I can fully understand" Nate rapidly lets out, clearly more confident than before. </p>
<p>"Ah, Nathaniel. You seem much more... How do I say it? Relaxed? Confident? Ah, yes. Optimistic was the word" The boy says, with a small smile on his face. </p>
<p>"Hey... Now thinking about it, how do you know our names? I don't remember meeting you. Hey! Nate, do you know this guy?" Gabbie says. Before Nate or the mysterious boy can even think about responding, Gabbie once again. Interrupts. "Actually... Wait! Hey, you! What even is your name?" Gabbie exclaims. Giving a questioning look to the boy. </p>
<p>"Sorry, I forgot to say this. I heard your... Encounter, before we got on the train. And for my name, it's Oliver. Oliver Nightingale."</p>
<p>'Oliver Nightingale is a weird name' is all Nate could focus on. But, he just shrugged it off as many wizards had weird last names. 'Must be a wizard thing? Wait... I don't have a weird last name. Am I not a wizard? Actually, now thinking about it... Gabbie also had a weird last name too. Hornette... Pretty strange... I guess?' </p>
<p>"Hmmm... Okay... But! I don't trust you, Oliver. And especially not with that voice!" </p>
<p>"Huh? Is there something wrong with my voice?" </p>
<p>"Yes! Yes, there is!" </p>
<p>"I don't think taht there's something wrong with my voice..." </p>
<p>"Well of course you wouldn't! It is your voice, Y'know?" </p>
<p>"I do know that it's my voice" </p>
<p>"That isn't what I meant!" </p>
<p>"I know that. I was just being... Sarcastic?" </p>
<p>"Ugh!" </p>
<p>Soft laughs were then let out. "huh?" both Gabbie and Oliver said in unison. As they looked over they saw Nate, red faced and trying to keep in his giggles. </p>
<p>"You guys, haha. Are just-heheh-to funny!" Nate finally lets out. </p>
<p>"I think we'll all be good friends" Oliver says. </p>
<p>"Really?" Gabbie asks. </p>
<p>"Yes, I do" </p>
<p>Nate then looks at both of them and says</p>
<p>"I think so, too"</p>
