    <p>I. </p><p>They both looked so small in the two cribs, right in front of the bedroom’s window. A single ray of moonlight was breaking through the clouds outside, illuminating the small room and the people inside it. Remus wasn’t able to tear his gaze away from the two babies lying in front of him and a smile began to make its way onto his face. </p><p>It had been two weeks ago that Remus and Sirius had visited the small orphanage at the other end of the town to take a look at the two girls that had been left on the orphanage’s doorstep only two days prior. They had been informed immediately after having already stated their wish to adopt two children months before. It had been the best day of their lives. </p><p>Remus remembered only too vividly how he’d held his daughter for the first time, his husband next to him, cradling the older baby to his chest. Only one day later they had taken Davina and Charlotte Lupin-Black home. For now their cribs had their place in Sirius’ and Remus’ bedroom, right in front of the window and every night one of them would at some point get up and check on them. At least was that the excuse Sirius as well as Remus used to get up around two in the morning and watch their daughters sleep. </p><p>Their daughters. </p><p>It still felt surreal, even after two weeks of changing diapers, fighting over food, two weeks of loud, piercing cries in the middle of the night and many arguments about the stupidest things because of too many sleepless nights. But not once in these two weeks had one of them regretted or doubted their decision. They were the happiest they had been since their first date in their seventh year in Hogwarts. </p><p>“Rem?”</p><p>Remus turned his head to look at his husband who was lying in their bed on his back, his black hair surrounding his head like a halo, his eyes only half opened, looking at his husband. Remus smiled fondly before turning around fully and walking back to their bed to crawl over his husband. Sirius grinned and lifted his hands to let them rest on Remus’ hips while Remus dipped his head down to kiss the other man senseless. A content sigh escaped Sirius’ lips into Remus’s mouth as he pulled him down until Remus whole body covered Sirius’ and there was not an inch of space left between them. Sirius grinned into the kiss as his hand slowly slid up Remus torso under his shirt just to jerk his hand away and bump his forehead into Remus’ when a piercing, high pitched cry came from one of the cribs. </p><p>Remus groaned and rolled down from Sirius but didn’t make any move to get up again. Sirius looked at him with a cocked eyebrow and Remus only smiled innocently.<br/>
“It’s your turn, babe. I’m gonna go back to sleep now”, he purred before he turned around and buried his face in his pillow. Sirius looked from his husband to the crib and back before another deafening cry rang through the air and Sirius sighed a defeated sigh before he got up and walked towards the cribs. </p><p>“Hey, Princess,” he whispered tenderly before he lifted Davina out of her crib and cradled her to his chest where she abruptly stopped crying and looked at him out of big dark eyes, “Yeah, Papa’s here, it’s alright.” </p><p>And if Sirius Black sat down in the kitchen with his daughter in his arms at 2.30 am and quietly sang to her, watching her with adoration and love in his eyes, there probably was no happier person in the world than him.</p>
