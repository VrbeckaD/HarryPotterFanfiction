    <p> </p><p>"Yeah, yeah, I'll come, but no promises. You know I don't treat men, even if he is the heir."</p><p>
  <em>"That's fine. It's up to my student to convince you."</em>
</p><p>"I doubt he'll be able to. ...There is one thing. I'll be bringing someone with me."</p><p>
  <em>"I heard rumours about a new partner but I wasn't sure if they were true. You sure you can't leave them behind?"</em>
</p><p>"No."</p><p>
  <em>"...Rather blunt. They must be good. Well, I don't mind. I'll see you when you get here."</em>
</p><p>Shamal scoffed as he hung up. How a thirteen-year-old kid was going to convince him to do otherwise, he didn't know. He hated breaking his top policy but he had other rules now as well...</p><p>"Problem?"</p><p>Shamal twisted around and smiled his thanks as a cup of coffee was passed to him. "No, just doing a favour for a friend. Ever been to Japan?"</p><p>"Not recently. Am I to gather that you want me to follow you halfway around the world this time?"</p><p>Shamal shrugged, leaning back even as he shot an expectant look at his companion. "Not like you're not going to anyway, Harry, no matter what I say."</p><p>"Very true," Harry agreed amicably. "Someone's got to keep you out of jail."</p><p>Shamal snorted as he pointed out dryly, "Last time I checked, you try to get me arrested whenever I start admiring women."</p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow at him. "It's called sexual harassment, Shamal. And whenever you spend the night in a cell, I only have to pay for one hotel room. Everything works out."</p><p>Shamal huffed more out of amusement than annoyance as Harry rose to his feet and started packing. Thinking back, he still couldn't figure out the exact reason he had partnered up with the British... jack-of-all-trades.</p><p>Shamal was a freelance assassin and sometimes professional doctor. He was a hell of a doctor but his policy to treat only women tended to make his résumé look bad, not to mention he had no interest in working in a hospital anyway.</p><p>But the point was that he worked <em>alone</em>. Somewhere along the way, he had somehow picked up Harry Potter and his team of one became a team of two. What was even more shocking was that the man was, well, a <em>man</em>. Honestly, the few times Shamal had considered working with someone else, he had always pictured his partner to be reasonably female.</p><p>Shamal had been finishing up a job – twelve hits, simple and clean – when a noise in one of the rooms of the building had attracted his attention and he had gone to see if there was one more enemy lurking in the place. Two minutes later, he had found himself staring down at a black-haired man lying in what looked like a small pool of his own blood, eyes closed and looking very dead if it hadn't been for the slight hitching rasp cutting the air as the man breathed.</p><p>In the dark room, only lit by the dim hallway light, Shamal had unceremoniously prodded the stranger with one shoe, ready to release his mosquitoes if the man showed any signs of retaliation. The only thing that happened in response was a pair of green eyes snapping open, almost glowing in the muted light as the man pinned Shamal with a flat look.</p><p>They had stared at each other for a minute longer before Shamal had asked bluntly, "Are you with them? Got the short end of the stick?"</p><p>The man had given him a mildly irritated frown. "You're going to have to clarify who 'them' are."</p><p>Shamal had taken that as a no. He hadn't thought so anyway; traitors were usually killed as soon as possible, and his trained eye had already decided that while the stranger's injuries were deep, they weren't fatal. The man was probably a prisoner.</p><p>With an unconcerned shrug, he had made to leave. "Doesn't matter then. They're dead and you're free to go. I'd help you but I don't treat men."</p><p>Shamal had expected the usual squawk of indignation and demands that if he was a doctor, he should help him, but all he had received was a snort and a grunt of pain as the man pulled himself up into a sitting position to lean against the nearby wall.</p><p>"I don't believe I ever asked for your help," The man had drawled. "Now move out of the way please. You're blocking the light and I can't see anything in here."</p><p>More than a little startled but hiding it well, Shamal had left without a backwards glance, picking up his payment along the way before returning to the hotel he was staying at. He had checked out the next day, flirting with the receptionist on his way out and gotten a slap for it, but he hadn't made it halfway to the airport before the injured man that had lingered at the back of his mind since he had finished his latest job rushed back to the forefront of his thoughts.</p><p>Shamal really hadn't cared about the black-haired stranger and in his line of work, deaths weren't exactly rare, but the man's flippant words had spiked the doctor's curiosity. While he wouldn't have healed the man, if he had asked, Shamal would've helped him out of there.</p><p>So he had gone back, just to check whether the man had managed to get out or not. To his surprise, the stranger had been in the exact same place Shamal had left him in, but that hadn't been the shocking part. While the floor had still been splashed with crimson and the man's clothes looked to be beyond repair, Shamal couldn't see so much as a papercut on him.</p><p>The stranger had fallen asleep and even Shamal had grimaced at the drying blood he had been slumped in. In the end, he had hauled the man up and outside, waking him in the process and almost getting stabbed with a silver dagger that had appeared out of nowhere for his efforts.</p><p>Shamal had seen stranger things than high-speed healing in his life so he hadn't asked and the stranger hadn't offered. As luck would have it, the men Shamal had killed apparently had backup and they had come back right when Shamal had been setting the stranger down against a tree.</p><p>Five minutes and forty dead bodies later and Shamal had been wondering how the idiots he had killed the day before had managed to capture someone like his temporary field partner. The man was faster than anyone Shamal had ever seen in action, and while there had been a subtle frown of distaste on his face, the experience with which the stranger had wielded his dagger had been undeniable.</p><p>Two weeks later and Shamal had found out four things about the man: his name was Harry Potter, he didn't have anywhere to go or return to, any attempts to find even a parking ticket on the man had failed, and he had somehow piqued Shamal's interest enough that the doctor had postponed his flight out of England just to follow – he stubbornly refused to call it stalking as his new acquaintance mockingly accused him of – Harry around.</p><p>Harry hadn't done much more than raise an eyebrow at his presence and Shamal had only found this even more intriguing. How many people out there didn't so much as bat an eyelash when a complete stranger – and an assassin to boot – decided to share a two-bedroom hotel suite with them?</p><p>Another week after that and Shamal had received another job. It was only common sense to drag his new companion along, especially since Harry had started looking a little bored. And then they had simply fallen into the pattern of working together. Shamal would get the assignments and Harry would tag along, and the doctor hadn't even noticed how comfortable he was working with the Brit – who honestly couldn't be over twenty-four but acted more maturely than Shamal did most of the time – until he had woken up one day in the motel they had been staying in, sprawled on the sofa-bed with his back unprotected and facing Harry, who had been making breakfast in the tiny kitchen behind him. It had been years since Shamal had dropped his guard so much.</p><p>Now, a year after they had met, Shamal couldn't really imagine <em>not</em> booking two hotel rooms or one room with two beds, or ordering room service for two, or equally splitting the payment for each job between them.</p><p>Granted, Harry usually incapacitated their targets and left the killing to Shamal, but Shamal didn't always get assassination jobs anyway, and he had learned that Harry knew at least a little of pretty much everything, from cooking to poker to rock-climbing to putting a bullet through an enemy's head.</p><p>Shamal wouldn't label his partner as an assassin or a Mafioso. If he had to put a name to it, he'd say one of those mercenaries who did odd jobs for a living, but even that wasn't quite right because Harry sometimes worked just for the heck of it and didn't particularly care whether or not he received payment for his skills. Once, Harry had even taken over a random stranger's shift at a bar after the man had spun some sob-story about his wife being in the hospital but not being able to beg off work. Shamal had later found out that the man had been telling the truth but he still thought Harry's actions were a bit <em>too</em> kind-hearted for the world they lived in. Shamal would've called him naive and soft if he hadn't personally witnessed Harry hurling his dagger straight into an assassin's head when said assassin had tried to stab Shamal in the back, both literally and figuratively. <em>That</em> was the reason Shamal worked alone, with, it seemed, the exception of one Harry Potter.</p><p>Still, he had accepted his companion's quirks as Harry had accepted his. He never pressed Harry about his numerous skills, not too deeply anyway, and Harry never deliberately dug into Shamal's past. It was safer for everyone involved, and they still trusted each other enough to make a good team in the dark underworld.</p><p>"Daydreaming again, Shamal?"</p><p>Shamal gulped down the last of his coffee and got up with a languid stretch. "Just imagining all the women in Japan that I'll be able to meet. I've always thought Japanese women are the cutest."</p><p>Harry just gave him an indulgent smile of amusement, which was another thing that Shamal had resigned himself to. His partner always seemed to know when he was lying, though he thought he was rather adept at catching Harry out on his occasional lies as well, so at least they balanced each other out.</p><p>"I'll check us out," Harry said instead, shouldering the duffel bag Shamal had bullied him into getting. He couldn't understand how anyone could survive this long with only the clothes on their back; even Shamal had a suitcase he carried around.</p><p>"And I'll book the plane tickets," Shamal called after him as he flipped open his phone with one hand and started packing with the other.</p><p>The job in Japan shouldn't take too long and maybe Shamal could finally find a young sexy Japanese woman to stick Harry to. He had been trying to find Harry's type for all of six months now but if anything, his partner just seemed completely asexual.</p><p>Shamal shuddered at the thought.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>"Reborn! When will this doctor get here?" Tsuna wailed as he and his tutor drew closer to his house.</p><p>"When he wants to," Reborn replied flippantly and Tsuna had to force back tears of despair. Why did his tutor have to be so sadistic?</p><p>As they rounded the final corner, Tsuna slowed to a stop when he caught sight of a stranger – a foreigner – standing outside his house, peering at his address with a piece of paper in hand and a duffel bag slung over one shoulder. The man glanced at them when Tsuna shifted awkwardly, not quite sure what to make of this.</p><p>"Err, are you lost?" Tsuna asked tentatively, hoping the man spoke Japanese.</p><p>The foreigner smiled and shook his head. "No, I think I have the right place," His Japanese held only the slightest hint of an accent. "This is the Sawada household, is it not?"</p><p>Tsuna nodded uncertainly only to get kicked when Reborn leapt up onto his shoulder. "Ow! Reborn, what was that for?"</p><p>Reborn ignored him, smiling blandly at the stranger instead. "Who are you?"</p><p>The foreigner tucked away the piece of paper and inclined his head in greeting. "You must be Reborn. I'm Potter Harry. I believe you're expecting my partner, Shamal."</p><p>Tsuna glanced anxiously between Reborn and the stranger – Potteru Hari? – as the silence bordered on uncomfortable. And who was Shamal?</p><p>"I see," His tutor finally said. "And where is Shamal?"</p><p>Hari's smile seemed to curve into a smirk and Tsuna shivered. That expression was a lot like Reborn's when his tutor had something crazy and painful in mind for him to do.</p><p>"He got himself arrested," Hari said, far too cheerfully in Tsuna's opinion. "Sexual harassment at the airport."</p><p>Tsuna gaped and then did a double-take when Reborn actually looked genuinely amused.</p><p>"Come inside," Reborn offered, jumping back down to the ground. "You must have had a long flight."</p><p>"W- Wait!" Tsuna cut in, feeling bewildered at this turn of events. He still had no idea what was going on. "Who are you and who's Shamal?"</p><p>Hari turned back to him, and despite the smirk that had previously painted his features, Tsuna found himself relaxing at the warmth in the man's green eyes.</p><p>"You can just call me Harry," The man said, and Tsuna repeated the foreign name in his head – Harry, not Hari. "Shamal is your soon-to-be doctor. I'm his partner in crime."</p><p>Tsuna laughed nervously, not sure whether or not he should take the last part seriously as they followed Reborn into the house. Harry just grinned back good-naturedly so Tsuna couldn't be sure, but criminal or not, the man's presence put him at ease and he found himself smiling back as they entered his house.</p><p>"I'm Sawada Tsunayoshi," He introduced, toeing off his shoes. "But just Tsuna is fine."</p><p>"Pleasure to meet you, Tsuna," Harry replied with a sort of half-bow that somehow managed to look elegant and completely normal when the foreigner did it. Tsuna was sure he would've fallen flat on his face had he tried.</p><p>Five minutes later, they were all sitting in the living room, waiting for Shamal to arrive. Tsuna's mother was out shopping with the kids at the moment but Bianchi was home – much to Tsuna's horror; he really hoped the woman didn't try to poison his newest guest – and was promptly introduced to Harry.</p><p>Surprisingly, Bianchi just looked curious at Harry's presence and the two had soon struck up a friendly conversation, mostly about the doctor that was coming to see Tsuna and whom Tsuna wasn't sure he wanted anywhere near him anymore.</p><p>"I always thought Shamal would've taken on a female partner if he ever got one," Bianchi was saying now. "Does he patch you up if you get hurt?"</p><p>Harry waved a dismissive hand. "I can take care of myself and I don't get hurt often anyway. Besides, I'm more the gathering information type. I leave the messier aspects to Shamal."</p><p>Tsuna wasn't sure if he wanted to know what those 'messier aspects' were. This Shamal was a doctor-assassin as well – and wasn't that irony for you – and while Tsuna had semi-accepted the fact that mafia was slowly invading his life, he didn't have to like it.</p><p>"Um, are you an assassin too?" Tsuna tinged red when three pairs of eyes all turned to him. His tutor actually raised an eyebrow at him. Tsuna wasn't one to chat with people he didn't know and the guests that had been coming and going from his house were often insane enough that Tsuna had no choice but to interact with them.</p><p>But Harry seemed relatively sane and calm. He didn't fling poison cooking everywhere like Bianchi or bring along a troop of Mafioso and an out-of-control pet like Dino or fire weapons at the drop of a hat like Reborn. Best of all, Harry didn't speak to Tsuna with that irritating superior condescendence that the three Italians – even Lambo, for God's sake – living in his house always adopted. Tsuna already knew he was no-good but did they have to go out of their way to pound that into his head even more?</p><p>"No," Harry answered easily. "You could say I'm a jack-of-all-trades. I don't really specialize in any one career. If it pays and it's not too troublesome, I'll do it."</p><p>Before Tsuna could ask what 'not too troublesome' included, the black and white skull on his left palm spouted out, "That's so embarrassing! You're still afraid of getting on a swing! That's so embarrassing! You're still trying to learn how to swim!"</p><p>In the thick silence that followed, Bianchi snickered out loud while Reborn took another sip of coffee. Tsuna flushed deep red in embarrassment as he automatically clapped his hands together.</p><p>"Skullitis, huh?" Harry remarked and Tsuna glanced up when he heard no mocking laughter.</p><p>Harry still had that half-smile on his face but it hadn't become any more scornful. "Not fun for anyone."</p><p>Tsuna mumbled something unintelligible, nails digging into his palm. It was bad enough letting people he had gotten used to being around hearing his shameful secrets but it was an entirely different matter letting someone Tsuna thought was actually fairly normal-</p><p>"How old are you anyway?"</p><p>Tsuna looked up, startled at the spontaneous question. "Uh, thirteen. Fourteen in October."</p><p>Harry looked thoughtfully at him before revealing ruefully, "Better than me then. I couldn't properly swim until I was sixteen."</p><p>Tsuna felt his mortification ebb as his newest guest drew him into a conversation. "R- Really?"</p><p>Even sitting, Harry looked confident and comfortable with himself. Now that he thought about it, Tsuna couldn't imagine the foreigner not being able to do something most people learned at a young age.</p><p>"Oh yeah," Harry nodded. "One of my teachers at the time realized I couldn't swim and decided that the old 'sink or swim' adage fit me perfectly. He threw me into a pool and told me I wasn't allowed to come out until I could swim ten laps."</p><p>Tsuna gaped. "And you did it?"</p><p>Harry chuckled quietly, picking up the cup of tea Tsuna had made for him. "I had no choice. Took me eight hours but by the end of the day, I could at least doggy-paddle without drowning."</p><p>"But- But that's crazy!" Tsuna spluttered. "You could've died!"</p><p>"Actually, that's a good training exercise," Reborn piped up, turning an evil eye on Tsuna. "Since you still don't know how to swim, Tsuna, you can go through the same thing Harry did."</p><p>"What?!" Tsuna screeched. "Reborn! You can't be serious! I'll die!"</p><p>"Harry survived," Reborn pointed out calmly.</p><p>"That's different!" Tsuna protested, glancing at Harry.</p><p>Harry shook his head. "You can do anything if you have the right motivation."</p><p>"Not that kind of motivation!" Tsuna complained, but still found no sympathy from Harry. Under that laidback smile, Tsuna was beginning to suspect that Harry was just as crazy as the rest of his houseguests.</p><p>Before Tsuna could continue trying to convince Reborn to drop the idea, the doorbell rang from downstairs and Harry brightened.</p><p>"Ah, that must be Shamal. Mind if I get it?"</p><p>Tsuna shook his head and watched as Harry rose to his feet in one fluid motion, footsteps silent as he padded off to the front door. He missed the silent glance Bianchi and Reborn exchanged behind his back as Harry disappeared from sight.</p><p>"You let me get dragged away! Again!"</p><p>An indignant voice from the front door reached their ears and Tsuna watched with interest as an Italian man, about half a head taller than Harry, entered the room, scowling down at his smirking partner.</p><p>"It was your own fault," Harry retorted. "I warned you, didn't I? I told you not to bother the plane attendant, and what do you do? You go and bother the plane attendant."</p><p>"I was not bothering her!"</p><p>"You kissed her and tried to grope her before she slapped you! <em>After</em> she said no when you asked her out on a date!"</p><p>Tsuna sweatdropped as Shamal turned away sulkily. This guy was supposed to be able to heal him?</p><p>"Ciaossu, Shamal," Reborn greeted. "You took your time getting here."</p><p>Shamal just shrugged and elbowed Harry half-heartedly. "Blame him. He lets me get into all sorts of trouble and hardly ever helps me out of it."</p><p>"Your own fault," Harry repeated breezily. "Now do your job."</p><p>"Right," Shamal straightened and Tsuna perked up hopefully when the man's gaze drifted over him.</p><p>Only to sag when the Italian beamed at Bianchi instead, his arms opening as he stepped forward.</p><p>"Bianchi! It's been a while. Shall we go on a date? Don't be shy now!"</p><p>It all went rather downhill from there. Getting smacked around didn't seem to deter Shamal at all and Bianchi had soon fled the house, a besotted doctor chasing after her.</p><p>"Harry-san!" Tsuna cried desperately. "Can't you make him concentrate?"</p><p>For the first time since his arrival, Harry's expression took on a more serious edge and Tsuna saw his gaze momentarily flit to where his tutor was still sitting, an innocent baby smile on his face as usual.</p><p>"Better figure it out yourself, Tsuna," Harry told him. "Shamal doesn't treat men but he's not completely heartless. Give him a reason to help you."</p><p>Tsuna sighed and hurried out after the two Italians. He had less than two hours to convince Shamal to help him. What reason could he come up with?</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Two hours later, Reborn had sent his student scurrying off home after he had been cured and was currently walking back at a more sedate pace with Shamal.</p><p>"You've changed," Reborn commented as they walked back to the Sawada household.</p><p>Shamal glanced down at him, hands stuffed in his pocket and a lazy slouch to his frame. "Were you expecting me to leave the boy to die?"</p><p>"Once upon a time, you would have," Reborn countered. "And you've never done anything for anyone because you felt sorry for them. You don't treat men for any reason."</p><p>Shamal shrugged nonchalantly. "I've taken on a few more policies, that's all. Children don't count. I'll treat them if they're fifteen or under."</p><p>"Hmm, I did wonder who Harry stepped out to call," Reborn looked speculatively up at the doctor. "Who is he anyway? It's not like you to pick up just anyone. And a civilian too."</p><p>"He's no civilian," Shamal denied abruptly. "He's more capable than he looks."</p><p>They rounded a corner and Shamal automatically sped up as they both caught sight of Harry standing out front, staring up at the sky. Reborn didn't bother keeping up with the doctor as Shamal hurried forward to join his partner.</p><p>"<em>He's more capable than he looks."</em></p><p>Of that, Reborn had no doubt. Harry Potter had a disarming smile that told the world he was harmless but one look at the man's eyes had told Reborn that Shamal's new partner was far more dangerous than anyone was giving him credit for. Those eyes were old and had seen death far too many times, an unsettling picture in such a young face. There was a certain wisdom borne from experience in there too, and a core of power lurking in their depths.</p><p>Reborn saw this, recognized this, because those were the same things he saw in his own eyes, and, to a lesser extent, in the other pacifier-bearers' eyes as well. Had Harry been two-years-old instead of twenty-something, Reborn would've labelled him Arcobaleno.</p><p>Shamal didn't seem particularly inclined to leave Harry behind though so if Reborn wanted to keep the doctor around just in case something happened, the mysterious Brit would have to stay too. Reborn had already made a few discreet calls but none of his contacts had anything to give him about Harry Potter and that was what worried him most. He wasn't used to dealing with people he didn't know anything about, especially such a powerful individual.</p><p>On the other hand, while Reborn was helping Tsuna gather his own future Guardians and other Family members, if his student somehow secured Harry's loyalty, Reborn was sure they wouldn't regret it. He had already seen firsthand the genuine compassion Harry had.</p><p>He would do his own research on the man, Reborn decided as he reached the duo. While Shamal was an idiot when it came to women, the doctor would never partner up with someone he didn't trust explicitly.</p><p>"You two can stay for dinner," Reborn half-suggested, half-ordered. "Mamma loves cooking for more people."</p><p>It would be interesting to see what kind of person Harry Potter was.</p><p><em>Although</em>, Reborn thought as his gaze temporarily met knowing green eyes. <em>He already seems to know what I'm up to.</em></p><p>Yes, much more dangerous than anyone gave him credit for.</p><p> </p>
