  <strong>Prologue</strong>
</p><hr/>
<p>He stared at her. His eyes were wide, his mouth opened in a silent gasp. He could <em>see</em> her say something else; could see the words form in her lips; could see the sides of her mouth turn down into a frown when he didn't say anything. It's not like he could <em>hear</em> what she's saying though, since after those first two words there was a small ringing in his ears. Her words kept echoing within the chambers of his mind. The air had been knocked from his lungs as if a stray bludger had hit him. He felt her hand cup his cheek and instantly he turned towards it. <em>This</em> was familiar. The warmth of her hand was expected… unlike the news she had just given.</p>
<p>Hermione looked at her husband with something like a small pout on her lips. This reaction was clearly <em>not </em>what she expected. She knew it was a shock but…</p>
<p>"Harry, did you hear what I said?" She asked. She removed her hand from his cheek to grasp his clenched fist and that seemed to jerk him awake.</p>
<p>He sputtered, his jade-green eyes growing into saucers.</p>
<p>"Did you… did I hear you clearly?" He asked in a whisper.</p>
<p>The pout had turned into a smile now as her lips curved.</p>
<p>"Well, that depends on what you think I said," she replied.</p>
<p>He gulped. Softly, excitedly, frightenedly, <em>hopefully</em>, he asked, "You're… you're pregnant?"</p>
<p>She was grinning now. Hermione clutched his hand and nodded her head.</p>
<p>"I am," she replied. "<em>We</em> <em>are</em>."</p>
<p>His gaze turned to awe. His eyes filled with wonder. Finally, that smile she had been waiting for appeared on his lips as he gave her that earth-shattering grin she had loved all these years. The dimples were deep in his cheeks and he leaned forward to kiss her with the might of a thousand suns. She wound her arms around his neck and held him there, relief feeling her whole body.</p>
<p>They withdrew, and Harry knelt in front of her. Softly, gently, he laid his large hands on top of her still flat stomach. "I'm… I'm going to be a <em>dad</em>," he said in a choked whisper as he looked up towards her.</p>
<p>Hermione felt the tears gather in her eyes and she breathed deeply to keep them at bay. She laid her hands on top of his and nodded her head. "You're going to be a great father, Harry," she whispered.</p>
<p>He grinned again and turned his attention to their clasped hands. He brought his head closer to her stomach and his next words really did make the tears spill from her eyes.</p>
<p>"Hi baby," he said softly. "My name is Harry, and I'm your dad. Your mum's name is Hermione and already we love you so much," he whispered. "We can't wait to meet you."</p><hr/>
<p><strong>Author's Notes:</strong> Just a very small multi-chapter story which I hope would bring a smile to your face in these trying times. It's certainly brought a smile to mine while writing it.</p>
