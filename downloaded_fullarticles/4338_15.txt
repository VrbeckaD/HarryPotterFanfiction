  <strong>INTER-OFFICE MEMO</strong>
</p><p><strong>From:</strong> <em>Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster, Hogwarts</em></p><p><strong>To:</strong> <em>Severus Snape, Head of Slytherin House</em></p><p><strong>Re:</strong> <em>Slytherin Movie Night – Title Selections</em></p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Severus:</strong>
</p><p>I must commend you on the resounding success you’ve made of your new Slytherin Movie Night – I can't believe none of us ever thought of having one before. The dim glow of the dungeons is perfect! All that watery green light from the lake. It has the perfect atmosphere for cinema. And of course all that lush upholstery you blackmailed me into getting for your house oh so many years ago is finally paying off. Although I expect Minerva to come bursting into my office any day now, demanding similar upgrades for the Gryffindor Common Room. Sad to say, if I give in, unlike your house, the Gryffindors will ruin it all inside of a month. But let's just keep that between you and me shall we?</p><p>On to more important matters - the number of Muggleborns attending is truly astounding, my boy. (I commend your house for restraining its natural inclinations and not hexing them at the door. Then again, I DID just receive Ms. Spencer's accounting of your ticket sales. I suppose for 125 galleons a weekly screening you wouldn't care if we wallpapered the theater with Muggleborns.). You’ve created a TRULY harmonious interhouse, magical-muggleborn activity. I’m simply humbled. Even the teachers are thrilled. The threat of removing movie night privileges has done wonders with the Weasley twins. I’m sure it won’t last. It never does with them. But they haven’t been this compliant in YEARS. I tip my hat to your cleverness.</p><p>However, I am compelled to remind you to exercise caution in your selection of movie titles. I’m not sure which of these little theatricals sparked the outbreak. But several Gryffindors have had to replace incinerated wands after setting them alight in imitation of something called light stabbers. And more than a few of them have been caught on the upper floors trying to cross the gaps between staircases by swinging across on a rope! Although I must say, I find this odd, new double-bun hair style some of our female students have adopted to be rather adorable, so no harm there.</p><p>The other incidents could be chalked up to youthful exuberance. However, Madame Pomfrey has spent the last few nights pouring Calming Draughts down the throats of First Years who came to her raving about Lord Vadermort and/or the Darth Lord.</p><p>In any case, while I can hardly believe Muggles have even heard of the Dark Lord, much less made movie films about him, I respectfully request that you remove the offending title at once. Thankfully the Ministry have not taken notice. But if we have one more Gryffindor diving into the garbage vats claiming to be on the run from storm groupers, I’m sure they will. The last time the elves banished the bins without checking, Seamus Finnegan made it all the way to doors of the incinerators at Mess Alley before the waste removal elves fished him out. Thankfully, they're friends of Dobby's so told they gossiped to him before they told their wizard supervisors. By the time the supervisors were told, Mr. Finnegan was long gone. Hopefully, we won't have another incident because I'm sure we won't be as lucky next time!</p><p>Otherwise, please continue on with your exemplary work! It’s pure genius!</p><p>

  <strong>Addendum</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Might it be possible to put in a request for a faculty movie day/night? There’s been talk in the staffroom and I’m quite sure we’d all happily chip so you could purchase something a bit more grownup than soda or hot chocolate for the concession counter. And since we’re all of age, I’m quite willing to turn a blind eye to whatever you’d like to show. Madame Hooch in particular has mentioned some interesting things about a movie called “Last Tango in Paris.” Travelogues are always nice and relaxing, wouldn’t you agree?</em>

  <em>Besides we can’t let the students have all the fun…</em>
