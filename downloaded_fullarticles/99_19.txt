    <p>Aizawa looked over his students and could tell that most of them were tired. His class had been through hell and back this year and he was quite frankly afraid to allow it to continue. They needed training he couldn’t give him. Training only one person could. He didn’t want to have to call him but it looked like he had no choice. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay you brats, settle down. I have an announcement to make.” It took a few moments for it to get quiet in the classroom. “Tomorrow I will be bringing a guest with me. This guest is even more powerful than All Might and he will be teaching you how to defend yourself against attacks that even a quirk cannot have a chance against.”</p><p> </p><p>“What kind of person are we going to meet that’s so strong?” Midoriya asked under his breath with wide eyes. The others had heard him though. </p><p> </p><p>“Shut up.” Aizawa said glaring at them. “You’ll be respectful to him or I won't stop him from turning you into grease stains on the ground.” That shut them up quick. “He’s temperamental, he’s a wildcard, and grouchy in the mornings so try not to make him kill you. I don’t want to fill out the paperwork it’ll take to ship your grease stain home to your parents with an apology stating that that was all that was recoverable.”</p><p> </p><p>The entire class was terrified now. Even Bakugou looked horrified. Laughter from the doorway caught their attention. Present Mic stood there with a smile on his face. “Now Shouta, that’s no way to speak of your husband. People will think you married a villain if you keep talking like that. Plus, you’re scaring our little listeners and I could tell Ry what you said when I head home after classes.”</p><p> </p><p>Aizawa growled. It was an almost animalistic sound. “Even dare to tell him and you’ll be sleeping at UA indefinitely.” He crossed his arms and leaned on his desk. “I still don’t know how you got both of us to agree to letting you move in our house.”</p><p> </p><p>Preset Mic laughed. “Ry likes me. To be honest though I came here for a reason, not to tease you about your very sexy husband. You lucky bastard you.” He opened the door further to reveal a small child with sand colored hair and soft hazel eyes. “I bring a gift.”</p><p> </p><p>The little boy smiled before rushing forward. “Papa!” He yelled and jumped into Aizawa’s arms. Aizawa without even a second thought propped him on his hip and turned back to his students. </p><p> </p><p>“So as I was saying. Tomorrow your training will become harder than it ever was before. He will push every single one of you past any limits you’ve ever had and then further. We will have another class joining us as well. This training will be an all day training here at the school.” He said ignoring the fact that his capture gear was no longer around his neck but wound around the child.</p><p> </p><p>Present Mic smirked. “And if you need to ask him questions he’ll be moving into the 1-A dorm starting tomorrow.” Aizawa’s eyes widened. </p><p> </p><p>“No! No, he is not.” He said angrily and switched the boy onto his other hip. “I made him a promise that despite everything this would be the only time he would interact with quirks other than mine, yours, and the kids.” Just as he was about to say more his own capture weapon flicked out and wrapped both adults up. </p><p> </p><p>The boy on his hip started giggling as he held the other ends. “Papa and Zashi no fighting.” The boy said making a fake pouting face as his hair changed to black and his eyes red. He looked like a tiny Aizawa. </p><p> </p><p>Aizawa stared down at the kid. “Teddy… let papa go. You can keep hold of Hizashi if you want.” The boy smiled and nodded. The scarf unwound from Aizawa’s body but stayed tight around Present Mic. “Ignoring Present Mic for now, Make sure you all head straight to the gym instead of class in the morning. You won’t need to come up here.” He then walked out holding Teddy who yanked on the capture weapon and dragged Present Mic out behind them. </p>
