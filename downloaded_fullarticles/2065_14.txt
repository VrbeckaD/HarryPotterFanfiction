    <p>"There's a visitor for you, Master Scorpius."</p><p>Scorpius raises his head sharply, forgetting instantly about the parchment he has been reading for the last two hours. He isn't awaiting anyone, and he doesn't like to be surprised.</p><p>"Who is it, Linky?"</p><p>"A Mister Potter, Master Scorpius. One of the young ones."</p><p>Shit. That must be Albus, and if there is one thing that Scorpius absolutely doesn't want to do, it's speaking to Albus. Or having to explain his silence over the last two years. Merlin knows Albus has tried restlessly to contact Scorpius, even with his fantastic carreer.</p><p>As Scorpius opens his mouth to tell Linky he's not available, the door flings open and a dark haired man barges in. A man who is definitely not Albus Potter, even if they look a lot alike.</p><p>"Scorpius Malfoy? I don't know if you remember me, I'm James Potter."</p><p>Linky chuckles and closes the door softly behind her – maybe his father is wrong about house elves, because Scorpius is quite sure none of them would have done that with his grandfather. Scorpius shudders at the thought of Lucius Malfoy and house elves.</p><p>"Of course I remember."</p><p>That's just the thing with the Potter children. When they went to Hogwarts, everyone expected them to be presumptuous and selfish spoiled kids brandishing the name of their father at every opportunity. Well, they were not. James was a hot-tempered Gryffindor while his sister Lily was a more subdued and joyful one, and Albus Potter had been a Slytherin-sorted prankster, and the three of them were pratically exuding kindness and honesty, even Albus. James had even founded an anti-bullying group at school after discovering some of the kids were repeatedly cornered and abused by others.</p><p>"What can I do for you, Mr Potter?"</p><p>"Please call me James. I need your help."</p><p>"I'm not sure I understand."</p><p>"I... I mean..."</p><p>James Potter looks a lot like his father. He's taller, though, and has the warm brown eyes of his mother – only Albus has inherited from the famous green eyes. Where Albus is shorter and a bit on the skinny side – that's why he's such a successful Seeker, after all – James is well toned. Not bulky, but strong enough to be impressive in his Auror robes. And he's currently looking like a lost puppy, with his eyes downcast and his hands clenched into tight fists. He's pacing restlessly on Scorpius' expensive carpet and the blonde is remembered of what his father always says about Harry Potter.</p><p>"Please, take a seat. Would you like a cup of tea?"</p><p>Scorpius carefully keeps his voice cool and professional. Potter sits and takes his head in his hands, resting his elbows on his knees. He shakes his head.</p><p>"Okay. What exactly do you need me for?"</p><p>"Dad... Dad aked your father for advice – you know they're working together on a regular basis, don't you? – well, anyway, your father said you're the best, and Dad trusts him. So here I am."</p><p>Scorpius feels the familiar warmth spreading through him at the idea of his father praising him like that – he knows his father is proud of him, he's told him enough times, but it's something else to know he's saying it to others.</p><p>"So I suppose you need a Curse-Breaker."</p><p>"Yes. I think. I'm not sure you can help. No offense."</p><p>"None taken. Care to explain? I must admit I am a bit at loss right now."</p><p>"Right. Shit."</p><p>Scorpius stands up and pours Firewhiskey in a glass, then hands it wordlessly to Potter, who drains it. Scorpius raises an eyebrow and the dark haired man flushes deeply.</p><p>"Sorry. Thanks. I needed that."</p><p>Scorpius sits behind his desk again and waits. Then the words come, rushed and confused and there's an edge in Potter's voice that lets Scorpius know just how stressed and worried the other man is.</p><p>"My best friend Will is missing. It's been three weeks now. He's working with me in the Auror Department, though he has a desk job while I'm working on the field. Actually he's working with Dad, he's his second, so to speak. Well, anyway, one day he just didn't come to work and nobody has heard from him since then. I went to his house several times, but it looked like nobody was there. Then two days ago, I tried to get in. I was blasted away as soon as I touched the doorknob. A fucking Unspeakable came to inspect the house from the outside, said it was cursed and that he would send a team to work on it as soon as one would be available. But they are not doing anything and I know Will is in danger. Maybe he's trapped in there. We can't wait."</p><p>"I don't get it. I mean, why wasn't your father able to make things go faster?"</p><p>"He tried. He was so angry... Said it was the first time he asked for a favor, but they refused to do anything."</p><p>"You're not telling me the whole story. There must be a reason why they deny Harry Potter a favor. He's a hero and he's Head Auror, and he's honest to a fault. So, why?"</p><p>Potter closes his eyes tightly. He exhales slowly before whispering.</p><p>"The Unspeakable said it's Dark Magic. They... They suspect Will to have done it himself. It's not a priority. Dad tried to make them see reason, he said he worked with Will for years and that he never showed any inclination for Dark Magic, but they just said they would send a team, eventually."</p><p>The eldest son of the Savior looks at him with pleading eyes.</p><p>"I am sorry for your friend, Mr Potter, but I do not work on field. I'm specialized on cursed artifacts." Because field work means meeting people. Meeting people means suspicious glances and whispered words. Working from his flat is safer.</p><p>"Please, Scorpius, I wouldn't-"</p><p>James Potter stops mid-sentence as a flash of light suddenly hits the room. Scorpius turns around, only to see several reporters, cameras in hand, taking pictures of them from the building gardens. Potter curses under his breath and casts privacy charms at the same time than Scorpius. The blonde is panting with anger and glares at the idiot standing in the middle of his study.</p><p>"And that's why I don't work on the field, Potter! I can't believe you lead them here!"</p><p>"I didn't know! I usually manage to avoid them, but I guess I've been too distracted lately. Look, I'm sorry, but our fathers-"</p><p>"Our fathers are friends, Potter, and maybe it has something to do with the fact that yours is smart enough not to let reporters harrass mine. But we're not friends, and I don't owe you anything. I think you should go."</p><p>Potter looks crushed, but he nods. As he reaches the door, Scorpius hears him speak softly.</p><p>"For what it's worth, Scorpius, I'm sorry. I'll go and try to fix this mess with the pictures. And... you should write to Albus, or Fire-call him. He misses you."</p><p>And with that, he's gone.</p><p>And Scorpius tells himself he doesn't feel guilty. Not for Albus. Not for crushing James' hope. Not at all.</p><p>HP-HP-HP-HP</p><p>"Scorpius! Come in, son!"</p><p>Scorpius smiles and hugs his father. After a few words about their respectives lives over a cup of tea in his father's office, Scorpius takes a deep breath and steels himself.</p><p>"James Potter asked me for help yesterday."</p><p>Draco stills, and then smiles softly to his son.</p><p>"Yes, I thought he would."</p><p>"I refused." Scorpius says bluntly. Something like pain flickers in his father's grey eyes and Scorpius fidgets in his chair.</p><p>"Because it's field work? Or because it's James Potter?"</p><p>"Because the idiot let himself be followed and some fucking reporters took pictures of us, that's why!"</p><p>"Language, Scorpius. James must have been out of sorts, because he's usually very careful. They all are."</p><p>"I don't care."</p><p>"Then why are you telling me about it?"</p><p>Damn.</p><p>"Scorpius... Harry is really worried, too. Actually he tried to get into the house with Ronald Weasley two nights ago. They couldn't, and we all know how good they are. I don't know what happened between Albus and you, but don't let it cloud your judgment. James is a good man, but he's a Gryffindor and he's getting restless. Harry is afraid he might try to get in again, alone. He might be killed."</p><p>"Then he's stupid."</p><p>"How would you react if your best friend suddenly disappeared like that, Scorpius?"</p><p>"I wouldn't know." Scorpius fights the lump in his throat at the thought of his loneliness since... Well since he's given up on Albus.</p><p>"Of course you do. Just because you're too stubborn to talk with Albus about whatever problem the two of you have doesn't mean he's not your best friend anymore."</p><p>Scorpius shakes his head stiffly, and suddenly his father takes him in his arms, and Scorpius feels like a child, and Salazar, but it's good.</p><p>"Scorpius... I wish you'd be happier, you know... You deserve to be happy. I'm so, so sorry son..."</p><p>"For what?"</p><p>"For my mistakes. For those of my parents. I know why you're working from home, son. I know you."</p><p>"I'm not as strong as you."</p><p>"Yes you are. And I'm so proud of you."</p><p>But Scorpius isn't strong enough. Not without Albus by his side. His father has spent the last thirty years making his way through the Ministry, working harder than anyone else, ignoring the insults and the occasional hexes in deserted hallways. As the Head of Department for International Magical Cooperation, he works with Harry Potter closely and the two of them have been friends for a few years now.</p><p>But Scorpius could never bear to be glanced and whispered at, and he had spent the first two years in Hogwarts virtually alone, studying all the time and avoiding his classmates. He was a brilliant Ravenclaw and it was enough, he'd told himself countless times. But in his third year, Ravenclaw had been paired with Slytherin for almost every class and he had suddenly found himself seated next to Albus Potter in Potions. A cheerful, easy-smiling and over-friendly Albus who had made a point of making Scorpius his friend. Albus never cared about what people said about him, and hanging out with a Malfoy apparently didn't bother him in the slightest. They had spent more and more time together, until Scorpius felt almost like a normal teenager. After graduation, Albus had left to play with the national Quidditch team, and Scorpius had joined the Curse-Breaker training. They had met regularly, exchanged letters until... Until Scorpius abruptly ended their friendship.</p><p>What would Albus think if he knew Scorpius has refused to help his brother?</p><p>His father observes him with a knowing look and that infuriating smirk of his and Scorpius sighs with frustration. As soon as Scorpius would find a way to get in the house safely, he could go back to his life. It should be simple enough, really.</p><p>Hopefully James bloody Potter has not already killed himself in a stupid Gryffindorish act of bravery.</p>
