    <p>Remus:</p>
<p>It was quarter past ten at night, and the little boy couldn’t sleep. He could hear his parents arguing beneath his room. His tiny house carried noise well, so he could hear everything. As far as he could tell, they were talking about him.</p>
<p>“She’s just a little girl! How can she know that this age?”</p>
<p>“He, Lyall! He’s a boy! That’s what he’s been telling us since he could talk!”</p>
<p>“But have you ever heard of a boy born with the body of a girl, who even knows what gender they are at this age? How can we possibly decide this for her?”</p>
<p>“I have, actually. It’s just kept undercover even in the muggle world, because it’s extremely frowned upon. The magical world is even worse about it, love–”</p>
<p>“Exactly, Hope! If it’s worse for them in the magical world, why in the name of Merlin are we encouraging this?”</p>
<p>“Because he knows himself best, and he wouldn’t say this unless he knew it. I know him, Lyall, he’s my son.”</p>
<p>“Our son.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, our son. He’s our son, so we need…”</p>
<p>The boy stopped paying attention. He hated hearing them arguing, and couldn’t understand what they were talking about. He knew it was something to do with him, but couldn’t understand any further. And the arguing was grating at his ears, along with all the other sounds. The faint classical music his parents had been listening to before they started arguing. The crickets outside and the faint call of what the boy thought sounded like an owl outside. It was too much, adding on his own breathing and squeaking of his bed and the slight dripping of water from their broken tap and the creaking of the floorboards as his parents yelled–</p>
<p>Too much noise. Too much. He had to get out of here, had to find a quiet space. His house was too small for him to sneak around it, his parents would surely notice him. And, anyhow, it was much too small to bring him any relief, for everything could be heard. </p>
<p>He looked out his window. The moon shone bright over their garden. The Lupin family lived in the countryside, rolling hills and fields that looked like the quilts his father made stretched over the landscape in one direction, and in the other direction was a lush forest. Beautiful greens that looked like the colours on his curtains. The woods were a tangle of green that stretched as far as Lupin could see, beautiful and verdant. But in this light, the boy couldn’t see any of the colours that brought him comfort. He could see nothing except for the moon, shadows, and the grass and plants in his garden, though he could hear the wind in the trees.</p>
<p>That was where he had to go, to get away from this feeling of waves of sound crashing down onto his head. Out into the dark, quiet night. Out into the forest.</p>
<p>As the Lupin’s had such a short small house, his window wasn’t far above the vegetable patch for summer vegetables. Squash, peas, courgettes. The boy would try to not squash them on his climb down the side of his house. He scrambled out from under his blankets and tugged on his slippers. He crawled towards his window, his parents still talking in their makeshift living room below his bedroom. The window was fairly easy to open, if a bit stiff, but not too stuck that a little boy couldn’t ram it open. There were some vines that grew up this side of their cottage, the side facing their garden and, farther back, the woods. They made it easier for the child to get down to the vegetable patch, although he failed at missing all the vegetables, as he squashed a courgette with his knees when he dropped down. So much for his parents not finding out, but he would deal with that later, when they woke up to find a smashed courgette and stomped in soil directly beneath their son’s window.</p>
<p>He took in a deep breath, the relief of less noise hitting him. Finally, some calm. His mind felt at rest, and his headache was easing. The air was nice and warm, it being mid-July. The thirteenth, in fact. The boy was only five, though, so the dates were unimportant to him. The full moon above him sat heavily in the sky, calm and as if it was watching him, like his cat, Romulus, when he curled up on the sofa chair, a soft quilt beneath him and a fire in the fireplace. Still, silent, waiting. Almost like an eye.</p>
<p>Another call from that odd owl brought the boy down to earth and away from the glorious moon above him. The boy heard another howl, but this time it seemed closer. It was just an owl, though, he reassured himself. Just a loud owl. But then he heard rustling in the shrubs in his garden and saw two golden orbs staring straight at him. This was not an owl, but what creature could this possibly be? The boy looked up at his room, the window closed and too far up to climb upwards. He should have thought of that. The backdoor was also locked, so he would have to run past the shrubs to get inside.</p>
<p>He heard a growl and screamed. The wolf leapt out of the shrubs at the edge of the forest and bounded towards him.</p>
<p>“Help! Help! Mummy! Daddy! Help--” the wolf lunged at the boy, winding him and knocking him to the ground. The last thing he remembered was his father’s panic-stricken face and the great big jaws closing in on him.</p>
