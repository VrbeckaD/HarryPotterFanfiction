  <b>Prologue:</b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The saying money makes the world go round was one Harry James Potter hated with a passion. But then again he truly saw what money does to people. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It turned them into greedy monsters and once they had a taste of what it was like to have a lot of money, they wanted even more. It was like they were trying to fill an endless pit, never having enough. Just like Severus had always said. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Financial stability was nice. That was just a fact, but still Harry couldn’t help but loathe those kind of people who believed they could buy anything and everything with their money or fame. Sadly he worked in a place where he met a lot of people like that. The Snake Pit, one of the best know prostitution houses in Magical London, located at the back of Knockturn Alley.</span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Throughout his life Harry had been taught he was worthless, a freak. A nobody and that he would never amount to anything. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Now after many years it was still beating inside his core that he was worthless and didn't deserve happiness, but he had outgrown it. Years ago when he finally had enough and ran away from his relatives, he started to live on the streets and to get by he started to sell his body, like the other strays which he had grown up with. It was something that came a bit too easy. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Even though Harry hated it at first, he was hungry and desperate and they all had to work to get food. So he did what was necessary and learned to live with it. All in all he turned out pretty fine, because a lot of his muggle friends had turned to drugs and alcohol. Slipping away from reality because they couldn’t handle their pitiful existence.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Now Harry had more money to spend and didn't even know what he should buy. His small apartment was in a shabby neighbourhood in London and he had no interest in moving out. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His clothes were the same rags he always wore. They had simply become a part of him, and he could easily blend in with the crowd living in the area.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The only time that he wore quality clothing was when he was working. </span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>After years of surviving like this he had become numb. Yes, the sex was nice, most of the time. But in the end it was just a job and often he found himself dissociating when clients fucked him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was a way to save some of his dignity, some of his pride. Hermione had often told him he should get professional help, but he had help and he wasn’t alone. So he turned down all her well-meant advice and lived the way he did. It was a routine nowadays, sleep during the day and work in the evenings and at night. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Part of him knew, however, that if he looked into the past, he would lose himself. Too much had happened and despite Severus’s help with dealing with it, he knew he was still scarred deep on the inside. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was no way Harry could ever face his demons and therefore he had buried the rest of them deep within. So that he would never have to look at them and no one would know how messed up he was. He suspected that Severus knew, but the man had only told him that the past would always come back to haunt him and he should confront it, better sooner than later. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Abuse left its marks on people and Harry had wondered for years if he had been a victim. But when he saw how other parents treat their children, he knew what the Dursleys had done to him was wrong. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was wrong and it was their fault that Harry has fallen so deep. There was no way out of this dark pit. Because even though there were clients who offered him that, Harry found himself stuck in a loop, repeating the same mistakes all over again. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry carefully traced his fingers over Tom's cheek, seeing the man stirred in his sleep. When Harry had first met Tom Marvolo Riddle, he believed him to be the same. A greedy client with far too much money to spend, uncaring about everyone who was below him. Now he wasn't so sure anymore.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was one thing Harry had promised himself and that promise had been broken now. Like Severus Snape had always said: </span>
  <em>
    <span>'You sell your body, but never your heart.' </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Some clients had fallen in love with the prostitutes and in the throes of passion had said those cursed words. It was so easy to mistake lust for love and affection. They granted their clients a night or a few hours of it and they would come back, always wanting more and claiming they had fallen in love.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But in the end, it was just a job for the workers in the Snake Pit and despite the many advances and loving, kind clients Harry had met. He had never broken that promise before. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And now he had fallen for the worst of them all. Not only a client of high standing, but also the biggest bastard Harry had ever met. This, whatever this was, would ruin them both. Inwardly Harry cursed the day Tom Riddle walked in the Snake Pit.</span>
