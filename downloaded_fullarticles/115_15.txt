  <u><strong>Secrets To Keep</strong> </u>
</p>
<p align="center">Wouldn't it be better to go back</p>
<p align="center">To the way it used to be</p>
<p align="center">When we were young and free</p>
<p align="center">When we didn't have to whisper in the dark</p>
<p align="center">Or from friends and family hide our dreams and aspirations</p>
<p align="center">But isn't it better to keep these falsities from them</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>For these aren't their secrets to keep. </em>
</p>
<p align="center">Four years on in this endeavor</p>
<p align="center">We thought ourselves so very clever</p>
<p align="center">The good intentions that we had don't relieve the toll</p>
<p align="center">For while we've been lucky more than once</p>
<p align="center">The same can't be said for those we love caught in the crossfires</p>
<p align="center">Even unknown it weighs them down</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>For these are heavy secrets to keep. </em>
</p>
<p align="center">I don't know who I am without you</p>
<p align="center">Since we were kids at play</p>
<p align="center">Upon each other we've relied</p>
<p align="center">But these lies are too large and terrible</p>
<p align="center">Not easily conquered like the villains in our storybooks</p>
<p align="center">So much too young, we've aged with our self inflicted burdens</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>For these aren't children's secrets to keep. </em>
</p>
<p align="center">When you keep secrets to yourself</p>
<p align="center">It can be dangerous to keep those you love close</p>
<p align="center">So I will chain these doors we go through so you can't follow</p>
<p align="center">I'm sorry but I won't let you all be punished for our actions</p>
<p align="center">Lies seem to hurt the ones who care for us the most</p>
<p align="center">So we'll keep them out of the crossfire for as long as we are able</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>For these are not safe secrets to keep. </em>
</p>
<p align="center">Some lessons we hope to never learn</p>
<p align="center">For life unfurls like chapters, so I'll keep this story closed</p>
<p align="center">Locked away from innocent eyes</p>
<p align="center">Sometimes I do wish we never chased our dreams</p>
<p align="center">But we can't go back in time</p>
<p align="center">And it's never really going to be over</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>For these are our secrets to keep.</em>
