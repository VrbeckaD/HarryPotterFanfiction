</p><p>"Why do you keep looking at the sky, Mum?" Harriet asked. </p><p>"Oh, it's nothing, dear, nothing." Petunia Evans would not think about owls. Her daughter was perfectly normal, thank you very much, and there was no chance of an owl dropping in on her eleventh birthday and...</p><p>"Then can we get going? Betsy and Naziyah are going to get to the zoo before we do!" Harriet insisted. </p><p>No one knew how Charlotte Potter had survived the killing curse that had left the famous scar on her forehead, but it had somehow rebounded, killed the evil wizard who had just killed the twins' father James, and blown up the house. When Lily had returned and found the girls in the rubble, it had been a miracle.</p><p>But miracles have their cost, and the cost of Charlotte Potter's miracle had been her twin's magic. Though both girls had been showing signs of accidental magic before the attack, afterwards, one girl's magical core was completely stripped. It had taken the grief-stricken Lily a few months to come to terms with it, but finally she had begged her sister to take her squib daughter and raise her in the muggle world.</p><p>Petunia had her own reasons to resent the magical world. She had been on the point of marriage, when she had revealed her sister's secret. It was too much for Vernon Dursley, and he had called it off, and then the Obliviators had removed his memory of the conversation. Then she had to come up with a mundane reason to break up with him, and deal with him calling and trying again, and finally she had appealed to the Ministry of Magic and they had Confunded him into giving up on her. </p><p>She could have had the life she wanted - a house and garden, a child. But it was all gone, because of Lily's magic. </p><p>And now Lily was trying to get her to take a child.</p><p>"I can't afford a child! I can barely afford to live in this flat, but I couldn't afford a two bedroom place, and clothes and toys and everything a child needs!" Petunia said, while looking at the little girl with longing in her heart.</p><p>"She has money," Lily said. "Her father had money. I'll make sure you're taken care of, Tuney. I can get a house for you both and a monthly stipend..." Lily sobbed. "You don't understand what it's like for squibs in the magical world. She'd be treated like garbage. Worse than that. I don't want that for her."</p><p>Petunia picked up the little girl, allowing herself to think for the first time what it might be like to be a mother to this child.</p><p>"If I do this, then I adopt her. She'll be mine, not yours. You don't tell her, you don't change your mind. We get a solicitor to do it legally and arrange the custody and money and everything," Petunia said fiercely.</p><p>And everything had been fine since then. Except for Petunia's lingering fear that a Hogwarts letter would come on Harriet's eleventh birthday. </p><p>But as the day went on, her fears faded. She had never seen any magic from Harriet. There was no reason to think she wasn't a squib. The birthday trip to the zoo passed without incident, unless you counted Harriet standing and hissing at a boa constrictor for a few minutes an incident. (No one could convince the girl that she wasn't really talking to snakes when she did that.) But she got home with her two best friends, opened presents, ate cake, played in the yard, and eventually went to bed. And Petunia relaxed. There was no reason to worry about her daughter.</p><p> </p>
