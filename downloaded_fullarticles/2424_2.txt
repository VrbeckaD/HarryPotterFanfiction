</p><p>They walk up to the floo grate hand in hand.</p><p>“Well…”</p><p>“.. yeah.” </p><p>They face each other, both silent. Newt tries to hold eye contact, but finds that he can't look into those beautiful, captivating, salamander eyes without crying.</p><p>Because Tina's leaving. </p><p>She stayed with Newt for a few weeks after the events in Paris, helping Theseus with paperwork. But MACUSA needs their Auror back, and so it's time for her to leave. </p><p>“Newt…” Tina says quietly, looking at their intertwined hands. She rubs her thumb across the back of Newt's hand.</p><p>Emotion spills from her voice- better than from her eyes, in her opinion- and there's no question as to why.</p><p>Over the past weeks, miscommunications were cleared up, and the beginning of a romance had begun. </p><p>Time spent together in the basement… held hands… meaningful looks… a lot of almost first kisses… </p><p>“I'm going to miss you,” Newt says. “I don't like having to say goodbye again.”</p><p>Tina brings a hand under Newt's chin and lifts his head up, locking their eyes together. She can see Newt has already started to tear up, and she's not far from that, either.</p><p>“I'll miss you, too,” she says. “But I'll be back. Or you'll end up in the U.S. again. Either way, we <em>will</em> see each other again.”</p><p>“Yes, but… but Tina, last time… all of that miscommunication… I ended up <em>hurting</em> you, even if it wasn't directly- I don't want that to happen again.”</p><p>“It won't, Newt.”</p><p>“How do you know?”</p><p>“Because…” Tina bites her bottom lip. “Because I care for you quite an awful lot, Newt. And we'll write to each other. <em>Especially</em> if something seems a little fishy.” </p><p>Newt steps closer to Tina. “I care for you too, Tina. A lot,” he says. “And- and I want you to know… I want you to know that my intentions are serious.”</p><p>A tear finally escapes from Tina's eyes. “Oh, Newt…”</p><p>“I don't want to be a mystery to you, Tina. I don't want to <em>hide</em> things from you. So, just so my intentions are clear, I don't plan on messing up any chances I have with you. I don't want to lose you again.”</p><p>Tina leans even closer into Newt's space.</p><p>“You won't,” she whispers, before leaning in the rest of the way.</p><p>Newt almost naturally responds, kissing Tina back. Their arms wrap around each other as they stand there, neither wanting to be the first to break away.</p><p>Unfortunately for them, they forgot where they are.</p><p>“Ahem.”</p><p>They jump apart, both blushing fiercely. </p><p>A Ministry employee stands before them, not looking too pleased. he turns to Tina.</p><p>“Miss Porpentina Goldstein?” he asks. Tina nods. “Your connection will be ready in two minutes and will be open for three. Please be prepared.”</p><p>Tina nods again. “Thank you,” she says to the retreating employee. Brushing off invisible dirt from her pants, she turns back to Newt.</p><p>“Will you be alright?” Newt asks. </p><p>Tina mulls over his question.</p><p>Will she?</p><p>She's going back to New York, but to a home that probably won't feel like one anymore. Not without Queenie. </p><p>Tina shrugs. “I don't know,” she answers honestly, “but at least I'll have something to look forward to.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Tina lets out a breathy laugh. “Seeing you again, Newt.”</p><p>Newt blushes, averting his eyes. “Oh,” he says. He looks back up at Tina. “I'll be looking forward to it, too. Trust me.”</p><p>Tina smiles and kisses Newt on the cheek.</p><p>“‘Till next time,” she says, starting to walk back towards the grates.</p><p>“Yes,” Newt agrees, “until next time.”</p>
