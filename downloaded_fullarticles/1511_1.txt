    <p>“Remus Jonathan Lupin,” began Sirius.</p><p>“It’s three am, and it’s just John, Pads.”</p><p>“John Jonathan Lupin, I present to you the most wonderful thing that you, a nerdy werewolf, could ever hope or dream for.”</p><p>“I’m only slightly intrigued. I would like to fall back asleep.”</p><p>“James found this room and it sounds really bogus, honestly. He said it's got this weird mirror, and he thinks he sees himself and Lily and a little baby boy in Lily’s arms when he looks at it, but we all know that’s BS ‘cause that’s what he sees in every mirror, so I told him,”</p><p>Remus wasn’t paying attention anymore. Whenever Sirius started ranting, Remus could never follow, so he just stared at him and admired his lips and his nose and eyes and overall his really super heterosexual face. It was ridiculous. Why did Sirius, out of anyone in the world, have to be straight? It didn’t seem fair. A ton of girls had asked him to the Ball earlier this year, but he turned them down, and went, as James put it, stag with a stag.</p><p>“So I thought if you wanted to prove James wrong, or maybe take a break from your stupid Potions essay for literally FIVE MINUTES, we could go and see this mirror that shows <em>your deepest desires</em> or whatever shit James said?”</p><p>Remus wasn’t sure that Sirius knowing his deepest desires was not ideal. Especially since Sirius would be playing a key role in that desire. But nevertheless, he gave in. He blamed it on Sirius’s stupidly perfect puppy-dog-eyes.</p><p>“C’mon, Moons, fetch the cloak, and will we need the map?”</p><p>Grumbling, Remus climbed the stairs and stole the cloak and map from a sleeping James’s trunk.</p><p>They exited through the portrait hole, and Sirius flirted shamelessly with The Painted Lady to let them go out into the dark halls of Hogwarts, instead of yelling for Filch as she was supposed to do.</p><p>“Pads, how do you think James found this mirror? Because its sounds like the mirror in Hogwarts: A History, called the Mirror of Erised, which shows your deepest and most desperate desires, but historians are unsure whether it exists or not.”</p><p>“Remus, jeez. Can you go five seconds without being such a pulchritudinous nerd?”</p><p>“Pulchritudinous?”</p><p>“Ha! I know a word the great Remus Lupin doesn't! I demand an award.”</p><p>“Oh, hush up.”</p><p>☆☽</p><p>Before long, after jumping on many moving staircases, and Remus getting his leg caught in a fake stair (Sirius teased him a great deal about that) they reach a dusty, quite unkempt classroom.</p><p>“Lumos Maxima!”</p><p>The room illuminated, letting them see a large, slightly grubby mirror with ornate golden carvings.</p><p>“Look Pads! It does say ‘Mirror of Erised! Wow. That’s pretty awesome.” Remus had run to look at the carvings more closely, all thoughts of actually <em>looking</em> in the mirror flying out of his brain.</p><p>“Pads?”</p><p>Sirius was standing frozen in the middle of the room, staring into the mirror. A smile was threatening his lips.</p><p>“Come look, Remus.”</p><p>Remus joined Sirius and stared into the mirror. He almost screamed. James was there. Right behind him. Remus turned around to find his friend, but just spiderweb filled cabinets met his eyes.</p><p>He looked again. James was there and was holding hands with Lily. And they had these big stupid grins on their faces. Peter sat on the ground in front of him, laughing. Remus stood in the center. His face had no scars, and the bags that were constantly under his eyes were gone. He looked entirely too happy. And Sirius-</p><p>Sirius was kissing his cheek. And they were holding hands. God, that hurt.</p><p><em>So this is it?</em> Remus thought, <em>my deepest desire is for my best friend to kiss me and my other best friend to get the girl?</em>

</p><p>He turned to Sirius, but Sirius was already looking at him.</p><p>Oh my god, Remus so desperately wanted to kiss him. But he had to firmly remind himself that this is 1975, and heterosexuals do in fact, exist. He didn't even know what Sirius thought of homosexuality.</p><p>“Remus. I-i… What do you see?” For the first time in a while, Sirius Black actually stuttered.</p><p>“Well,” Remus was hesitant (and for a good reason. Never ever tell your badass, beautiful and not to mention straight as a ruler best mate that you love him.) “I see us. You know, the Marauders, and Lily is there…”</p><p>Sirius’s face changed from awe to sullen in an instant. “So your deepest desire is to have friends and snog Lily?”</p><p>“NO! James is the one doing the snogging. I mean, her and James are together.”</p><p>“Is that it? Your deepest desire is for James to kiss a pretty girl?”</p><p>Remus felt a strong wave of embarrassment and anger. “No, that is not it. I see myself kissing someone else, you absolute <em>idiot..</em>”</p><p>“Seriously?  Who?? Moony! You have to tell me who!”</p><p>Shit.</p><p>“If you tell me who I’ll tell you who <em>I</em> was snogging in my desire!”</p><p>Shit. Shit. Shit!</p><p>“Um.”</p><p>“C’mon, Moons, which bird was it. The Hufflepuff one you study with? Or, maybe Marlene?” Sirius seemed like he was asking a separate question then which girl he fancied. He looked dreadfully uneasy but excited.</p><p>“Well, see it wasn’t.. Wasn’t really a girl. Um.”</p><p>“It wasn’t a girl? Then what was it? A ferret?”</p><p>“No. Sirius.”</p><p>“Oh. So you fancy guys then?” Sirius face lit up just the slightest amount. “So who do you fancy? Snivellus? Peter? Me?”</p><p>Shit. Had Sirius Black just asked if he fancied him? Shit. “Umm.” Remus mumbled under his breath, “..Yeah.”</p><p>“What’d you say?”</p><p>A bit louder, Remus said “...I do?”</p><p>“Pardon me?”</p><p>“God! I said I loved YOU, you prat. Ugh, you make me so mad.”</p><p>Sirius looked shocked but quickly regained his cocky look. “Pulchritudinous.”</p><p>Remus’s face burned after what his confession and anger towards perfect Sirius Black roared in his stomach.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Pulchritudinous. It means delighting the senses or exciting intellectual or emotional admiration.”</p><p>“I still don’t understand, you immature prat.”</p><p>“It means I think you’re beautiful, Moony.”</p><p>Oh.</p><p>
  <em>OH.</em>
