  <strong>PART ONE</strong>
</p><p>Draco had been working for approximately fourteen hours when Potter was brought in.</p><p>Fourteen hours wasn’t even that much compared to some days, but all Draco wanted to do was go home, change out of his robes, and collapse into bed. He did <em>not </em>want to see Harry Potter’s limp body being carried in on a stretcher.</p><p>Once he had gotten over the initial shock, Draco hurried over to the shocking sight. Trainee Healer Bethia Burke and Healer Leonel Estrada were running the stretcher and casting diagnostic spells.</p><p>“What happened?” Draco asked, trying his very best to keep his voice even. He was working – this was his job; he fixed the people who came in regardless of who they were.</p><p>“Healer Lloyd found him,” Leonel said, still instructing his quill to take down notes on the pad that was racing to keep up with him. “The patient had fainted on the sidewalk a few blocks away. It’s lucky Lloyd decided to walk home today; who knows how long it could have been before someone else found him?”</p><p>“How are his vitals?” Draco asked, his professionalism finally taking over.</p><p>“His pulse is weak but it’s there.”</p><p>Draco swallowed and nodded. He quickly spotted an available room for Potter.</p><p>“Here.” He hurried over and held the door open. “Put him in here.”</p><p>The Healers led the stretcher into the room as instructed. Once in, they levitated Potter onto the bed and continued to cast more diagnostic spells.</p><p>Draco felt for Potter’s pulse, his wrist cool underneath Draco’s fingers. Like Leonel had said, it was weak.</p><p>“Alcohol levels are high,” Betty said, her voice high and clear. Her wand was producing a thin, red, vertical line, which she looked at intently.</p><p>“So are the potion levels,” said Leonel, frowning at the red swirling shapes in front of him. “I’ll have to determine what potions are in his system.”</p><p>“Good. I’m taking this,” Draco said a second before claiming Leonel’s notepad.</p><p>Leonel gave a short nod, focusing more on the spells than on Draco.</p><p>He quickly skimmed over what was written. It was essentially what Leonel had told him earlier – Healer Selina Lloyd had been walking home when she came across a figure sprawled on the sidewalk. She had then called Leonel over from St. Mungo’s. Together, they had brought him in. Not much was known about Potter’s condition just yet – just that he’d been unconscious when found.</p><p>Draco dropped the pad where it had been levitating earlier; it obeyed and resumed floating by Leonel’s side. He then left the room to fetch Potter’s existing medical files. Upon finding only outdated ones, he started a new one, along with paperwork for this visit. He quickly filled out what he could on his way back to the room; he’d have to wait until Potter regained consciousness to complete the rest.</p><p>Draco gazed at Potter, his grip on the files tight. Potter had dropped out of Auror training six years ago, along with Ron Weasley. Weasley, however, remained in the public eye even now. He’d been working at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes with his brother since dropping out.</p><p>Potter, on the other hand, had hardly been seen in the past five years. His disappearance hadn’t stopped <em>the Prophet</em> and countless other news sources from writing about him, of course. Articles were still being published – filled with speculation more than anything else – wondering where he was, what he was doing, and would he be returning to the Wizarding world anytime soon?</p><p>And here he was, returned at last. Draco never thought it’d be like this.</p><p>Potter was much thinner than he had been before his disappearance, which was saying something – he’d always been a bit scrawny. His face was gaunt; his hollowed cheeks and chapped lips made Draco’s heart fall. His light brown skin was covered in a thin sheen of sweat, his unwashed hair sticking to his forehead. He also had a fair bit of unruly facial hair.</p><p>Draco crossed his arms and observed his coworkers at work. Leonel was deep in thought, his eyebrows furrowed and hand on his face. Betty was nibbling her lip, her forehead pinched in concentration as she scribbled on her own notepad.</p><p>“Betty,” Leonel said abruptly, catching Draco’s attention, “Have you tried <em>Indica Externa</em>?”</p><p>“Oh no,” she said, blue eyes wide. “I’ve only tried <em>Ostendo</em>.”</p><p>“That’d work too, but in this case, I think the Foreign-Identifier spell would be even better.”</p><p>Betty nodded, and with a careful wave of her wand, said clearly, “<em>Indica Externa</em>.”</p><p>Spidery letters floated out of her wand and into the air, identifying what foreign chemicals were in his system. Betty gaped, and Draco didn’t blame her – the list was extensive and rather worrying. A good number of the potions induced sleep. Draco tried to ignore the sickening thought that rushed to the forefront of his mind – had Potter tried to commit suicide?</p><p>No, no. It wasn’t possible. Potter was presumably on his way to St. Mungo’s. He wanted help, right?</p><p>Draco tried to focus on Leonel, who was carefully copying each item onto his notepad.</p><p>“Could you classify those potions and take a look at those ingredients? See if anything reacted badly with another?”</p><p>Leonel nodded and left. Draco turned to Betty, who had a troubled expression on her pale face.</p><p>“Betty, could you fire-call his closest contacts? They’re most likely Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” Betty said and hurried out of the room, leaving Draco alone in the room with Potter.</p><p>Draco carefully set up monitory spells to watch Potter’s vitals before sitting down. However, he didn’t get to sit for too long – Scarlett Mitchell, the Healer-in-Charge of the PAPP department, walked in a moment later. Her dark dreadlocks were tied back from her face, her eyes hard. Draco stood up hurriedly, though Mitchell was paying more attention to Potter than him.</p><p>“So it’s true. What’s Harry Potter doing here?”</p><p>“I’m not sure, Healer Mitchell,” Draco replied, “Though I believe that he may have overdosed on a number of potions. Healer Estrada is currently running a potion screening and Trainee Burke is calling his emergency contacts. Or rather, those who I guessed to be his emergency contacts.”</p><p>She finally looked at him.</p><p>“He doesn’t have any listed?”</p><p>“It seems the only medical records we have for Potter are outdated – they’re from Hogwarts and the Ministry.”</p><p>“Who’s the emergency contact listed on the Ministry records?”</p><p>“Ginevra Weasley,” Draco answered. “However, I decided not to attempt to call her as her work requires her to travel extensively.”</p><p>“Do you know for certain that she’s not in the country?” Mitchell crossed her arms.</p><p>“Yes, Healer. I was told a few days ago by her partner that they’re in New Zealand until the end of the month,” Draco said, thinking back to the owl Blaise had just sent him.</p><p>“Alright,” Mitchell said, her face slightly less tense. She turned back to look at Potter. “I’m sure Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger will be here soon.”</p><p>“Yes, ma’am,” Draco replied softly.</p><p>As if on cue, Betty walked into the room, followed by a slightly frantic Granger and Weasley. Betty stepped aside as the couple approached Potter’s bedside. The worry was obvious in their faces, and Draco felt another twist in his stomach. He’d seen them quite a bit in recent times, especially since Blaise and Ginevra had started dating.</p><p>“Malfoy,” Weasley nodded. “What’s happened?”</p><p>“Weasley,” Draco greeted shortly. “One of our Healers found him a few blocks away from here at around 9:40 PM. He was brought in unconscious, so we don’t know what it is that happened exactly, though another Healer is determining the cause of his state as we speak.”</p><p>Draco could tell that Granger’s mind was already furiously at work, and Weasley mostly looked sick.</p><p>“Do you have any guesses as to what caused it?” Granger said, saving Weasley from having to speak.</p><p>“We found an alarming amount of potions in his system,” Draco said apologetically. He hated this part – seeing the faces of loved ones as he explained what had happened. He trudged on. “Some alcohol was apparent as well, though its content isn’t as significant as the potions.”</p><p>Granger leaned against Weasley, her hands covering her face. Weasley put his arm around her, as if they could get any closer, and kissed the top of her head. She looked up at him with watery eyes.</p><p>“Oh Ron, we should have done something,” Granger said desperately. “We should have gotten him help before this happened – we could have stopped it! We’re so awful and careless…how could we have let this happen?”</p><p>Weasley’s face was troubled as he stroked her bushy hair.</p><p>“It’s not our fault, Hermione,” Weasley said, though it sounded like he was trying to convince himself as much as Granger. “We couldn’t have known it was this bad. You know how he is about hiding things…”</p><p>When Granger didn’t respond, he turned his gaze toward Draco.</p><p>“When will we know which potions he had in him?”</p><p>“Healer Estrada should be finished evaluating them soon,” Draco replied.</p><p>Weasley nodded. “Right.”</p><p>“Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger,” Mitchell said kindly, stepping forward a bit. “I’d just like to assure you that we’ll treat Mr. Potter to the very best of our abilities. I oversee the Plant and Potions department, and I ensure it is only staffed by the very best. I am Scarlett Mitchell, and Healer Malfoy here is the head of the Strife Feirold Ward. Though it seems you may already be acquainted…?”</p><p>Granger and Weasley nodded. Mitchell’s eyebrows rose infinitesimally.</p><p>“Yes, well, he is very capable, both as a leader and a Healer. Healer-in-Training Burke,” Mitchell said, extending a hand towards Betty, “can testify to this, I’m sure.”</p><p>“Yes ma’am,” Betty said, her cheeks turning slightly pink as Mitchell turned the attention to her. “I’m very lucky to be studying under Healer Malfoy and I’ll do all I can for Mr. Potter, I promise.”</p><p>“Thank you, all of you,” Granger, who had composed herself, smiled slightly. “We’re lucky Harry’s in such good hands.”</p><p>“Yeah, thanks,” Weasley echoed.</p><p>A knock at the door brought their attention to Leonel, who stepped inside, a grim look on his handsome face. He didn’t look at the parchment in his hands before he spoke, choosing instead to meet Granger’s and Weasley’s worried eyes.</p><p>“I’m afraid to tell you that there were numerous potions in Mr. Potter’s system, all of them having to do with inducing sleep or calmness. Fortunately, since many of them have the same sort of ingredients, there isn’t too great a risk. However, the lavender in the Sleeping Draught may have had a bad reaction to the syrup of hellebore in the Draught of Peace, both of which were found in Mr. Potter’s system. It isn’t mortally dangerous, but it would be best to cleanse his system as soon as possible to avoid any permanent damage.</p><p>“So that’s what I propose our team to do immediately.” Leonel glanced at Draco and the others, who nodded. Reassured, Leonel went on, shifting his attention back to Granger and Weasley. “Cleansing is a fairly easy process, though it must be done over a span of several days and can be painful at times. Of course, we’ll do our best to make it as painless as possible.”</p><p>Granger’s eyes were watery again. Weasley sagged with relief, though his arm remained around Granger’s waist protectively.</p><p>“Thank you so much, Healer…?” Granger said.</p><p>“Leonel Estrada. And you are Miss Granger and Mr. Weasley, if I’m correct?”</p><p>They both nodded.</p><p>“It’s wonderful to meet you both,” Leonel said, his voice gentle. “I just wish it was under better circumstances.”</p><p>“You and I both, Healer Estrada,” Granger smiled.</p><p>Draco could have sworn Weasley’s grip tightened; he bit down a smile. It was hard to blame Weasley, to be truthful, since Leonel was handsome and charming in a slightly nerdy way. Still, Draco didn’t think Granger could ever leave Weasley that easily, and there was also the small fact that Leonel was gay.</p><p>Mitchell interrupted Draco’s silent musings.</p><p>“Again, I stress how committed we are to Mr. Potter’s recovery and well-being. We’ll leave you with him now.”</p><p>“Thank you, Healer Mitchell. We appreciate your efforts,” Granger replied.</p><p>“Of course, Miss Granger.”</p><p>Mitchell used her wand to move the two chairs closer to Potter’s bed and left the room with a brief smile. Leonel and Betty followed at her heels. Draco lingered behind, knowing he had to say something. He <em>wanted</em> to say something.</p><p>“I promise you both that I’ll do everything I can to make sure Potter’s alright.”</p><p>“Thanks, Draco,” Granger said softly. “We don’t doubt you.”</p><p>“Yeah, thanks Malfoy.”</p><p>Draco nodded, looked at Potter once more, and left.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>“You have all the equipment?”</p><p>“Yes, Healer,” said Leonel monotonically. “Honestly, I’m not a trainee anymore. Can’t you trust me to keep track of these things?”</p><p>“No. You’re still a lower rank than me, a year younger than me, <em>and</em> I’m your superior, which means I am ultimately and unfortunately responsible for you.”</p><p>“There’s no need to treat me like a child,” Leonel muttered as he surely double-checked that he had all the equipment behind Draco’s back. “You have Betty for that.”</p><p>“Betty’s no fun though. She’s too nice,” Draco explained, “So you’ll continue to be the one I pick on because there’s no one else.”</p><p>“What about Ira? They’re even younger than me,” Leonel pointed out.</p><p>“They’re powerful, smart, and wealthy. Only a fool would mess with Ira.”</p><p>Leonel grunted in agreement. They continued walking, Draco reading over the potion screening and Leonel taking care not to drop anything.</p><p>“Didn’t you use to go to school with Harry Potter?” Leonel asked, interrupting the silence.</p><p>“Over eight years ago. I haven’t seen him in person since my trial,” Draco frowned, lowering his voice as he spoke.</p><p>“And you know his friends, too.” It wasn’t framed like a question.</p><p>“You already know the answer to that. You begged me to meet the visionary Hermione Granger a few times, remember?”</p><p>“I still don’t know why you didn’t.”</p><p>“The past is in the past,” said Draco, waving the subject away. “Anyway, you’re meeting her now. Isn’t that enough?”</p><p>Leonel scoffed, affronted. “I think I have enough tact to not bring up my admiration at a time like this.”</p><p>Draco knew he was right.</p><p>They reached Potter’s room. Draco knocked on the door gently before opening it and getting welcomed by the sight of Weasley and Granger sitting by Potter, the latter holding his limp hand. Draco swallowed.</p><p>“We’re ready to start the cleansing procedure. Unfortunately, I am going to have to ask you to leave. We can only ensure the best results if we’re sure there’s no distractions while we’re performing the procedure.”</p><p>Weasley nodded and stood up, extending a hand down to Granger. She seemed more reluctant to leave, electing instead to grip Potter’s hand tighter.</p><p>“Come on, Hermione. He’ll be fine. He always is.”</p><p>She gazed at Potter for a second more with tired eyes, and finally nodded. Granger released Potter’s and took Weasley’s, and stood up shakily. They walked out the room together, Granger hanging onto Weasley as if for her life. Draco and Leonel glanced at each other.</p><p>“Alright. Let’s get started.”</p><hr/><p>They were almost done with the first stage of the process when Potter responded.</p><p>“Wait,” Draco said sharply, surprising Leonel into freezing in his place. “I think he just moved.”</p><p>Leonel lowered the vial of clear liquid he was holding and narrowed his eyes. “What did?”</p><p>“His head. I think he turned it a bit,” Draco said hesitantly. “He might have made a noise, too.”</p><p>“Should we stop?”</p><p>“No, this is good. It will be easier to have him drink the Clearing Potion than having to force it down.”</p><p>“Ok.” Leonel looked nervous but prepared. Draco recognized the glint in his dark eyes, determined to face whatever challenge was in front of him.</p><p>Draco cleared his throat.</p><p>“Potter? Can you hear me?” he said clearly, hoping Potter was conscious enough to understand him, and better yet, communicate. This was almost unheard of, but of course, Potter was exceptional. “I would like you to drink an important potion that will help get excess chemicals out of your body. If you can hear me, please move any part of your right hand.”</p><p>Draco stared down at Potter’s hand, and felt Leonel’s eyes on it too. After a few more moments, there was a twitch of movement in Potter’s index finger. Leonel glanced at Draco with wide eyes.</p><p>“Excellent.” Draco smiled a bit. “Now, Potter, this may burn a bit, but I assure you that it’s beneficial. Do you understand?”</p><p>Another twitch.</p><p>Draco’s smile grew.</p><p>“Right, Leonel. Let him drink it.”</p><p>Potter’s eyes were still closed, and his breaths were shallow, but he had confirmed that he could drink it. Leonel carefully tilted Potter’s head forward and tipped the vial into his open mouth. After ensuring that Potter had successfully swallowed it, Leonel laid his head back down on the pillow and put the empty vial away.</p><p>“Good work, Potter,” Draco said clearly, nodding approvingly. He then addressed Leonel. “Now we just need to make sure it works. He should feel it in his system soon, perhaps a minute or two.”</p><p>Leonel nodded, and Draco could see the anxiety in his face.</p><p>They only waited for a minute and a half when Potter’s body tightened and clenched, his back going stiff and lifting several centimeters off the bed as he writhed. He yelled out, his hand curled into fist and face scrunched in pain.</p><p>Draco quickly cast <em>Muffliato</em> in the direction of the door – no use in scaring the other patients and guests. Even Leonel looked frightened, though he was trying, unsuccessfully, to hide it from Draco.</p><p>“It’ll be over soon,” Draco assured Leonel over Potter’s yells.</p><p>Leonel nodded, his brows furrowed and impossibly perfect teeth worrying his bottom lip. Then, as soon as it started, the yelling stopped. Potter’s body relaxed and slowly fell back onto the mattress.</p><p>Draco checked Potter’s vitals, and upon seeing that they were as stable as they could be at this stage, he told Leonel to pack it up. Leonel collected the equipment in his arms as Draco undid the muting spell. When he opened the door, he was greeted by Weasley’s and Granger’s equally worried faces. Draco gestured to Leonel, giving him permission to go. Leonel walked away.</p><p>“The first stage has been completed,” Draco told them. “The second stage will take place tomorrow night, stage three two days after that, and after that he should be completely cleansed of all foreign chemicals that are currently in his body.”</p><p>The couple relaxed visibly.</p><p>“Do you know when he’ll wake up?” Weasley asked anxiously.</p><p>“He was actually partly conscious while we were in there. He didn’t open his eyes or speak, but he did acknowledge what I was saying,” Draco said, slightly amused by how much Granger and Weasley were perking up. “Judging by this behavior, he might even wake up tomorrow morning, which is quite rare. I’m impressed, I must say.”</p><p>Granger’s lips quivered slightly. “That’s wonderful.”</p><p>“Thank you. Really, Malfoy,” Weasley said genuinely.</p><p>Heartened by this show of faith, Draco took a chance.</p><p>“I’m just doing my job. There’s also something I wanted to discuss with you two,” he paused. “I was wondering if I could ask you some questions regarding Potter’s history with potions.”</p><p>This sobered them up rather quickly.</p><p>Granger hesitated before asking lowly, “Could we go somewhere private?”</p><p>Draco wasn’t surprised – this was clearly a sensitive topic and not to mention, had to do with Potter.</p><p>“Of course,” he said. “My office is just down the corridor. Follow me.”</p><p>He led them to his office, opening the door and allowing Granger and Weasley to enter and sit down first.</p><p>“Right.” Draco sat down at his desk and took out Potter’s file. He looked up at Granger and Weasley, who both seemed rather reluctant. “You can begin anytime you’d like.”</p><p>Draco dabbed his quill in his inkpot as Granger prepared her words.</p><p>“Well,” she said cautiously. It was clear she hadn’t told this story before. “Harry taking potions isn’t anything new. He started taking Dreamless Sleep shortly after the war ended. But it was still an approved amount back then, and he only took it when necessary. But when he started training as an Auror, it got worse.”</p><p>“I remember he’d come into work restless,” Weasley said, picking up where Granger left off. “Looking sort of drained, even though he told me he’d used Dreamless Sleep the night before. I reckon that’s when he started overusing it, to the point where it became a cycle. He’d come in, work his arse off, go home, do paperwork, take Dreamless Sleep, and go to bed. Every day.”</p><p>“Do you know how long he did that?” Draco asked, continuing his notes as he spoke.</p><p>“Maybe a year?” Weasley said uncertainly. “But that was before it got really bad. He could hardly get out of bed some days. And then Harry just stopped coming to work. Hermione and I went over to his flat, and he just said he was tired. It was halfway reasonable. I mean, I quit a few months later to work at my brother’s store.”</p><p>Draco’s quill scratched furiously against the parchment.</p><p>“Were you aware that he was taking potions other than Dreamless Sleep at the same time?”</p><p>They both nodded.</p><p>“We would go visit him sometimes, cos he hardly went out anymore.” Weasley frowned, remembering. “His flat was always a mess. Just – empty potion bottles everywhere. Most of them were Dreamless Sleep, but there were some others too.”</p><p>“When did you start noticing these changes? The new potions?”</p><p>Weasley looked over to Granger for help.</p><p>“Around half a year after he quit Auror training. And that was…in June 2000.”</p><p><em>Just a month after the second anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts</em>, Draco thought as he wrote it down.</p><p>“So it was most likely around early 2001?”</p><p>“Yes.” Granger sighed. “I wish I had the exact details down…how I didn’t think to remember everything before…”</p><p>“This is already very helpful,” Draco reassured. Granger nodded, though she didn’t look too convinced. Draco pushed on. “Did you ever notice Potter drinking excessively?”</p><p>Weasley shifted in his seat, clearly uncomfortable.</p><p>“Sometimes, when we’d go over to his flat, everything smelled like alcohol. And when we told him he might want to stop, he shrugged it off.”</p><p>Draco nodded. “And I don’t suppose you have an estimation as to when that started.”</p><p>“Later on. When Harry started getting more desperate – when the potions weren’t working as well – he started drinking,” Granger said, looking pained. “Last year. Spring of 2004.”</p><p>As Draco wrote this down, he spoke again.</p><p>“I apologize for having to ask you all of these questions, especially at a time like this. I understand it’s a sensitive topic.”</p><p>Granger shook her head.</p><p>“If it helps, we’ll do anything.”</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Draco woke the next morning with his face pressed against his notes. He sat up slowly, back aching terribly from having spent the night hunched over his desk.</p><p>He blinked at the sunlight coming in though the blinds, eyes adjusting to the harsh light that woke him up before unsticking the notes from his cheek. Draco checked his wristwatch – it was barely six in the morning.</p><p>He stood up and stretched, checking the mirror to evaluate the damage. His hair was sticking up on one side and his robes were wrinkled. But at least there was no ink on his face.</p><p>“Take a shower,” his mirror suggested.</p><p>“You think I wouldn’t if I could?” Draco grumbled.</p><p>He smoothed his hair down and took out the spare robes he kept in his office. He quickly replaced his wrinkled robes with the fresh ones.</p><p>Satisfied, Draco stuck his wand in his pocket and opened his door. He was immediately welcomed by the slightly interested (or rather interested, by their standards) face of Ira White. Ira, head of the Aletta Wellensly ward of the same department, was lanky, as blond as Draco, and genderfluid.</p><p>“Ira,” Draco greeted.</p><p>“Is it true? Harry Potter’s here?” Ira asked calmly.</p><p>“Yes.” Draco frowned. “Who told you?”</p><p>“Betty. She tells me everything, so don’t punish her for it.”</p><p>“I won’t,” Draco sighed. “I just hope <em>you</em> don’t tell anyone, because it’s supposed to be kept under wraps. The last thing we need here is a team of <em>Prophet</em> reporters, and Merlin forbid, Rita bloody Skeeter.”</p><p>“Oh, I wouldn’t tell anyone. It’s just, you know, I’m ridiculously bored after submitting my new potions in for approval by the Ministry. I’ve nothing to do.”</p><p>They looked hopefully at Draco, and he sighed again.</p><p>“Fine. If he’s still asleep, and if there aren’t any guests in his room, I’ll let you in. Only for a second, though. If anyone asks, you’re doing something with potions.”</p><p>“Aren’t I always?”</p><p>They made their way to Potter’s room. Draco lightly knocked on the door before opening the door and peering in. Potter looked about the same as he did yesterday, though perhaps he had some more color in his face. Draco let Ira in.</p><p>They whistled lowly. “Five years of silence and then this.”</p><p>“He’ll be ok,” Draco said quietly. “I’ll make sure of it.”</p><p>And then Potter woke with a gasp, eyes wide and face covered in sweat.</p>
