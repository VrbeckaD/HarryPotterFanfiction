    <p>A sudden noise woke him up, a noise he wasn’t used to. It had him reaching for a wand that wasn’t there at first, hand grasping at the air and sheets under his pillow before he could identify the sound. It was a baby – it was <em>his</em> baby.</p><p>Severus closed his eyes for a moment.</p><p>“You are Michael Scott Stevens,” he reminded himself. “You are Michael, and the child crying is your son, John Henry. Lily’s son and <em>your</em> son; not The Boy Who Lived. He is crying, Michael, and you need to get up to soothe him.”</p><p>Michael took a fortifying breath and eased out of bed, stumbling around in the dark as he struggled to the door. In the next room, a small toddler was standing on wobbly legs in his crib, cheeks red and wet with stress and tears, as he called out. The mobile above the boy's crib spun franticly in the windless room, and stuffed animals flung themselves from shelves on to the floor and into the walls. </p><p>“Dadadada!”</p><p>“I’m here,” the man soothed, lifting the child close to his chest. Small fists clutched his shirt as the boy clung to him and sobbed. “I’m here, John Henry. It’s all okay. Daddy’s here.”</p><p>-</p><p>People stared at them. They stared all the time. Conversations stopped when Michael entered a shop or walked by on the street. Almost no one came into the new herbalist shop with the cosy little apartment above.</p><p>They were new, and new was weird. Weird got stared at.</p><p><em>‘It’ll die down,’</em> Michael assured himself as he pushed the buggy down the store aisles, John Henry stashed safely in the child seat. <em>‘They don’t stare because they know you’re a criminal, Severus. They aren’t going to call your old associates down to kill you or the boy. You’re new in town and they don’t know you. It’ll die down.’ </em></p><p>The grocer stared as he scanned and bagged the vegetables, fruits and meat. The woman who ran the post office stared as he dropped off his monthly bills, though she smiled when John Henry blew spit bubbles at her. The two old men who sat in the park playing chess stopped their game and stared when Michael took John Henry through for walks.</p><p>
  <em>‘It’ll die down. It has to.’ </em>
</p><p>-</p><p>A small toddler wobbled on unsteady legs as he wandered into the kitchen. Manoeuvring around the table and chairs, he bumped gently into the cabinets before steadying himself, grasping onto his father’s trousers. Michael looked down at the small face grinning up at him.</p><p>“Got yourself all the way over here on your own, have you?” he murmured softly to the baby. The child’s grin widened as he bent his knees up and down. “Well, now that you’re here, what would you like, little man?”</p><p>“Up,” was the clear demand.</p><p>“Ah, but I’m making dinner,” Michael shook his head. “Can you smell dinner?”</p><p>“Es. Up.”</p><p>“Would you like to help make dinner, John Henry?”</p><p>The boy giggled and bounced a little more. “Up.”</p><p>Michael rolled his eyes at himself. “Conversing with a fifteen month old,” he groused to himself, bending to pick up his son. “Who would have thought, hmm?”</p><p>The boy was deposited into his highchair and dragged over to the counter where Michael was chopping vegetables. A bit of sauce was put into a small, plastic bowl and given to the boy, along with a spoon.</p><p>“Can you stir that like daddy does?” Michael asked his son. He showed the boy what he meant – guiding the tiny, pudgy hand around the bowl in a circle – then stepped a bit to the side and let John Henry do it. A look of intense concentration came over the small face as the boy circled the spoon in the sauce very slowly. Green eyes darted up to his father to check.</p><p>“Very good,” Michael praised with a smile. “That’s very good, John Henry. You keep doing that, okay? Daddy’s going to chop veggies while you stir the sauce.”</p><p>-</p><p>“It’s negative four degrees outside, my radiator is broken, and you’re telling me that you won’t be able to come out for another three days?!”</p><p>The voice on the other end of the phone was very apologetic, but swore there was no other way.</p><p>“I have a two year old and a business to run – what makes you think I can wait three more days for this sort of repair?”</p><p>The voice recommended a very reliable space heater and lots of sweaters until they could come. And please be assured they’d be looking for the soonest availability, Mr Stevens.</p><p>Michael threw the phone down into the cradle with a satisfying clatter. He looked over his shoulder at the boy on the couch. His curly haired child peaked out from under in layers and layers of blankets, his nose red and his eyes wide. Michael didn’t mind the cold, really, but his son needed to stay warm.</p><p>“Alright, John Henry,” he sighed, mostly to himself. “We’re going to the store and then we’ll camp out in the living room. How does that sound?”</p><p>“A’ven-ture?”</p><p>Michael made a face. A space heater, every blanket in the house, and maybe a fire in the fireplace; perhaps to a two year old, it would be something mildly adventurous. “Yes, I suppose it’ll be like an adventure.”</p><p>-</p><p>Shrieks bounced off the walls as tiny feet stomped across the floor. </p><p>“John Henry,” Michael tried, tense and aggravated as he chased after the naked child. “This isn’t a game – it’s bath time.”</p><p>“No!” How in the world did such a tiny creature that couldn’t even stand steady a few months ago, now run faster than Michael could ever hope to catch?</p><p>“John Henry!” Michael paused in the kitchen. Leaning against the counter, he sighed and ran a hand down his face. “Why in the world did I think this was a good idea? What the hell am I doing, Lily?” he asked the ceiling. Of course, the plaster held no answers.</p><p>Down the hall, Michael could hear the tiny trickle of liquid hitting the wooden floor.</p><p>“Daddy! I peepee!”</p><p>Michael growled. “I know where he gets <em>that</em> from,” he sneered. “Stay right where you are, John Henry!” Michael stooped beneath the sink for paper towels and floor cleaner.</p><p>-</p><p>“Daddy, can I go school today?”</p><p>Michael chuckled softly to himself. “No John Henry,” he said, very carefully slicing reeds. “Today is Saturday – there’s no school again until Monday.”</p><p>“Oh.” John Henry looked at his socks as he thought. “Is it far away?”</p><p>“Well, go get the small calendar on my desk and we’ll see together.”</p><p>“Okay!” John Henry raced into his father’s study and grabbed the appointment calendar off the desk. When he arrived back into the kitchen, Michael was just finishing up washing his hands.</p><p>“I got it!” John Henry pushed the book into his daddy’s legs as Michael crouched down beside him.</p><p>“Okay,” Michael said, straightening out the page. “Now, lets see. Do you remember the days of the week?”</p><p>“SundayMondayTuesdayWedsday, FursdayFridaySaturday,” John Henry recited.</p><p>“Very good. So today is Saturday the 6th,” Michael pointed to the little box under the Saturday column. “And then there’s Sunday,” his finger moved down to the little box numbered 7, “and school will be on Monday.” Michael’s finger rested on the box labelled 8 under the Monday column. “So we will have today, and all day tomorrow, and then you will have school on Monday.”</p><p>John Henry inspected the little boxes and their numbers. Today had already been pretty long, and tomorrow always seemed like forever. Anything on the other side of tomorrow was impossible to imagine. “Is gonna be a long time b’fore school on Monday.”</p><p>Michael chuckled. “You won’t think so when you’re older, John Henry. But I suppose to any three year old, it does seem like a very long time.” Michael thought for a moment. “Would you like to help me in here? I’m putting tea packets together.”</p><p>“Yes!” John Henry loved helping his daddy, and putting dirt and bits of grass into little bags was a Very Important Job.</p><p>“Alright. Go put the calendar back on my desk where you found it and we’ll get started.”</p><p>-</p><p>“Is it mail time?” John Henry asked from his position seated at the display counter with his colouring book. Michael looked up from his accounting to glance at the clock.</p><p>“You know, I think it might be.” Closing the book and setting it aside, Michael stood. “Lets get your coat and we’ll walk over.”</p><p>John Henry let out a cheer and carefully climbed down the step stool his father had made for him. “Will Mrs H have cookies?”</p><p>Michael took a deep breath. “She does seem to, doesn’t she?” He held open the little jacket for his son to put his arms through. “You’ll ask nicely, though, John Henry.”</p><p>“Because demanding is rude,” the boy recited.</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>The weather outside was brisk and cool, a beautiful autumn day. The town doctor and his partner were walking down the opposite side of the street, but the doctor raised his hand in greeting when he saw father and son exit their shop. Michael returned it gladly, his other arm jerking as John Henry skipped happily next to him. He was using his father’s hand for balance as he hopped from one foot to another, trying to avoid the cracks in the sidewalk.</p><p>It struck Michael suddenly that maybe he should write to the boy’s aunt, let her know that everything was better than she could have even imagined it. Nearly five years was enough time, surely, for the worst of the war to have past.</p><p>But no. The letter could fall into the wrong hands and even if it reached the Dursley’s home, there would be no point. Petunia barely remembered her sister was dead. No sense rocking the boat when she didn’t even know she had a nephew. Receiving a mysterious letter would raise more questions than it answered. Even if the boy was a bright, generous young boy, thriving outside of her home just as she’d hoped he would.</p><p>-</p><p>Snow was just starting to fall as the parishioners exited the church. It was a quiet Christmas Eve, as it always had been, and Midnight Mass tended to be quieter than most. Michael, while never a particularly religious man, had felt an unexpected sense of comfort returning to the traditions his late maternal grandmother once held.</p><p><em>‘You’ll never truly fit in, you know,’</em> the dark, oily voice of doubt passed through his mind. <em>‘You can try, but you know things they can’t even imagine. Done things they’d never dream of.’ </em></p><p>“Daddy, I don’t want to walk any more,” a petulant and over-tired John Henry stated, ceasing to move right where he stood on the stone pathway leading from the church to the parking lot.</p><p>Michael looked at his five-year-old son and frowned a bit. “Would you like me to carry you?”</p><p>John Henry pouted up to his father and gave a great sigh, bright pink lip poking out. The world was awfully hard sometimes when you were small. “Yes.”</p><p>Michael sighed and crouched down, tugging the bright green woollen cap down snug over his son’s unruly, black curls. “Up you get, then,” Michael declared gruffly, hefting the dead weight of his son into his arms. John Henry draped his arms over his father’s shoulders and snuggled in. “Father Christmas is coming tonight, you know. You’ll have to get right into bed or he won’t come.”</p><p>“After cookies and carrots,” was John Henry’s sullen reply, reminding his father of the tradition of setting out carrots for the reindeer and cookies for Father Christmas. His breath was hot against his father’s neck.</p><p>“I think we can manage that.”</p><p>-</p><p>The house was entirely too quiet. The shop never opened on Monday, and Michael was beginning to think that maybe he should change that policy. John Henry was at school full-time now, taking with him all the noise and movement and energy Michael had grown used to.</p><p>He didn’t want to admit it, but he missed the little scamp. But it was all right… only four more hours to go.</p><p>-</p><p>“Dad!” John Henry ran up to his father outside the schoolhouse. “Dad! Mr Jones’ sheep got into the recess yard again!”</p><p>Michael shook his head. “Again? That’s the third time this month.”</p><p>John Henry shrugged. “Mrs Davies said that if it happens one more time, she’s going to thump him.”</p><p>“I highly doubt that,” his father said with a frown.</p><p>John Henry just hitched his shoulders again and reached up to grab Michael’s hand. “She said that Vicar Jones wouldn’t even blame her, and neither would God.”</p><p>“Well, maybe we can help Mr Jones rebuild his fence instead, hmm? I think that might be a little better idea than thumping him.”</p><p>“Do you think I can play with the dogs?”</p><p>Michael looked down at his son in surprise. “You don’t want to help build the fence?”</p><p>John Henry wobbled his head side to side. “I like Penny and Yorkie, dad. And we don’t have a dog.”</p><p>“I suppose since we don’t have one, you’ll have to play with those that belong to others. Is that it?”</p><p>“We could get a dog.”</p><p>Michael thought for a moment, remembering a night so many lifetimes ago when he saw things he hadn’t been meant to see.</p><p>“No,” he said, firm in a way his son didn’t understand. “We are <em>not</em> getting a dog.”</p><p> </p>
