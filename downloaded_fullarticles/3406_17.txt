  <em>Platform 9 and 3/4ths was buzzing with activity, and for good reason. It was the first day back to Hogwarts since the war. There were new First years, some of whom were clinging to their parents - and others who were trying to get away from them. Second, Third, and Fourth years were mostly all on the train already, talking and catching up with their friends. Fifth and Sixth years were a bit more somber, understanding more fully the realities of the war and how lucky they were to be coming back, and then there were the Seventh/Eighth years who had either participated in the war and knew of all the deaths and bloodshed that had happened, or had lost someone who had been in the war. They weren't terribly depressed, at least not the majority of them, and at least not visibly, but there was an air of seriousness with them that didn't cloud the minds of the younger students.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Ronald and Ginny Weasley stood by their parents Molly and Arthur, talking quietly while they waited on Harry and Hermione.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It had been extremely hard for the Weasley's to get past the death of Fred, and George took it especially hard, but with the help and support of his family was doing better. Molly and Arthur, of course, still mourned the death of their son, but painted on bright and smiling faces for Ron's last year of school. They were very proud of him for making the decision to come back, because that hadn't been his first choice. If it hadn't been for Harry, Ginny, and most importantly Hermione, he never would have gone back. He had wanted to jump right into being an Auror, like he and Harry had discussed before the war. George had talked to him, but hadn't really pushed him in any type of direction. He had more or less just said that he understood his reasons for not wanting to go back, and that he wouldn't think any less of him if he didn't. In the end he had been proud that Ron did decide to go back though.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Ginny was sad at Fred's death, and at the strain it had put on her family, but she didn't like to dwell on the negative thoughts. She was always positive, and most of the time it elicited a positive reaction from others. Her positivity, though nice, did backfire at times. Many people had thought that the war hadn't affected her, when that couldn't have been farther from the truth. Those first few weeks after had been hell for her, and she hadn't uttered a single word to anyone - regardless of what they had tried to do or say to her. After a while though, she decided that Fred wouldn't have wanted her to be depressed all the time, so she turned to being positive, and becoming, for lack of a better term, like Luna. Nothing really bothered her anymore, she was never upset, and always calm. Harry thought - no, knew - that it was only a matter of time before she finally let out her feelings. But she definitely wasn't the only one.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry was doing as well as could be expected. He enjoyed the rush of being a war hero as much as the next wizard would, but it got to be tiring after a while to not be able to step foot outside his house without having a slew of reporters shoving cameras in his face. He and Ginny still remained a couple, and that was one thing that really did bring Harry a genuine joy - aside from the company of Hermione and Ron of course. He had stayed with Hermione quite often, not at her parents home, but just hanging out. He knew that she was lying when she forced that smile onto her face and said she was doing "perfectly fine, Harry". But he didn't mention it, just like she didn't mention when he escaped for a few hours every week to go and visit the memorial for Sirius. These were things that the war had created, that were not to be mentioned.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione was okay. Well as okay as one could expect of someone who had lost both of her parents to war crimes. As much as she claimed that she was fine, she wasn't. The nightmares that haunted her dreams made it almost impossible for her to get a restful night of sleep, and made it even more impossible for her to forget the devastation that the loss had caused her. She'd spent the summer cleaning out her old house, figuring out what to do with all of her parents things, selling the house - everything had been left to her anyway. She had handled all these tasks with a deep breath and a smile - and alone. She had politely declined Harry and Ron's offer for help, saying that it was something she needed to do by herself. Now that she was back at Platform 9 and 3/4ths, she felt that she could breathe a bit easier. Because this was familiar. This was still in her "Good Memories" box.</em>

</p><p>"Oh Hermione, don't you look all grown up!" cooed Molly when she saw my new appearance.</p><p>The war had brought about a positive for me, and that was that I'd finally decided to dress up my features. My usually frizzy and unruly mass of hair hung in neat chestnut colored ringlet curls that framed my face, and my usually frumpy clothes were replaced by a black pencil skirt, a white blouse, and a pair of modest black heels, covered by a stylish jacket and teal blue scarf. The new dress code that was afforded to us by Hogwarts would suit me well this year.</p><p>I smiled, "Thank you,"</p><p>Ron and Harry hadn't seen me for a month, so they had no idea that I'd decided on a makeover, and it was obvious they were very impressed - Ron more so than Harry.</p><p>"Well look at you Mione." said Harry, giving me a hug.</p><p>Ron was about to do the same when Ginny flung herself into my arms first. I chuckled and hugged her back, "It's good to see you too Gin."</p><p>Ron rolled his eyes and hugged me, his hand a bit lower than Harry's had been, but it didn't bother me.</p><p>"I'm glad you decided to come back Ron."</p><p>He nodded, "I'm glad I decided to come back too."</p><p>Molly and Arthur were telling Ron how he had better be getting good grades this year, and I took the moment to let my eyes wander around the platform to watch all the other families wishing their children a safe trip. I pushed back the feeling of jealousy and continued looking around. That's when my eyes landed on a certain blonde haired family that no one really knew what to make of.</p><p>The Malfoy's.</p><p>They had changed sides during the war, and the fact that they'd let the Order use Malfoy Manor as an operations base was probably the only reason they weren't all sitting in Azkaban. Certain people didn't want anything to do with the them, but they'd paid for rebuilding Hogwarts, and therefore Malfoy was allowed to come back. It seemed as though many people weren't all too excepting of him - not that this surprised me.</p><p>It wasn't that I hated Malfoy, because I didn't. He'd helped us during the war to defeat Voldemort and that's all I'd wanted to accomplish. I just didn't know what to think of him.</p><p>Just then I saw Pansy Parkinson join him and his parents, and slip into an easy conversation with them. To anyone else it would have looked like they were still on top of world, completely uncaring of anybody's opinion, but that wasn't the case. They were all nervous, and I could tell.</p><p>I trailed my eyes over a few more families - parents hugging their children - before my eyes skimmed over Draco again, but this time he caught my eye.</p><p>He simply nodded, and I nodded back politely before turning around to return to the Weasley's conversation.</p><hr/><p>

</p><p>I was more than a little impressed by Hermione's new wardrobe. She looked...good. Better than most of the stupid bints running around here.</p><p>"Draco, are you listening to me?" asked my mother, following my line of vision. I could tell she was surprised to find it was Granger who had captured my attention - but only slightly.</p><p>I nodded, "Yes mother, I heard you. Low profile."</p><p>My father scoffed, "Low profile. You're a Malfoy, you continue doing what you've been doing."</p><p>I just nodded absently, not agreeing or disagreeing with him. Pansy just stood there, used to this from my family already.</p><p>My mother pulled me into a hug, squeezing me as if she'd never see me again, and whispered for only me to hear, "I love you."</p><p>She released me after that, and departed with my father, leaving me and Pansy standing alone on the platform, not saying anything.</p><p>Pansy's parents had been thrown in Azkaban for their crimes, but a few people had testified on her behalf, and since she was a minor, had been spared the same sentence.</p><p>"I guess we should board the train then." I said after a moment.</p><p>Pansy nodded and we disappeared into the throng of children also climbing on board.</p><hr/><p>
  <em>Hermione, Ron, Harry, and Ginny waved goodbye to Molly and Arthur and did the same, taking their regular seats on the hectic train. They talked animatedly the entire ride, until they got off the train and onto the carriages. It seemed to dawn on them that they would be facing the place where many of their friends had died, and no one - not even Ginny - seemed to want to say anything.</em>

</p><p>When the students all walked up the stairs to Hogwarts it was easy to see that the younger students were excited. They ran ahead of the older kids, laughing and joking with each other - much like me and my friends had done on our first day.</p><p>The Seventh/Eighth years walked slower than everyone else, even Draco and Pansy's pace had slowed. We were all taking in the sight of the newly rebuilt castle, and trying to decipher our emotions, or at least that's what it was for me.</p><p>"Well I think it looks lovely." said Ginny, taking Harry's hand and pulling him forward, but not before he grabbed Ron's sleeve and yanked him along as well.</p><p>I smiled at their antics and shook my head. I looked up at the massive building in front of me, and I wanted to move forward, but something seemed to be stopping me. I'd wanted to come back more than anyone to finish my education, but I also hadn't expected it to be this difficult for me.</p><p>I closed my eyes and tried to shut out the images, reasoning that the war was over, and there was no reason to still be having these episodes. With a determined set to my brow I walked forward and up the stairs into Hogwarts.</p><p>When I entered the Great Hall it was just as crazy as I had remembered it the year before and the year before that.</p><p>Everyone was bustling around, the First years nervously looking around waiting to find out which House they would be in, and everyone else at their respective tables.</p><p>As I maneuvered around the Great Hall to my usual table, I took in all the familiar - and unfamiliar - faces, and smiled. This was a new year. It would be a good year.</p><p>I sat down and noticed that Harry and Ron were already talking Quidditch, while Ginny sat and listened. I shook my head and chuckled, giving as much to the conversation as I could - which wasn't much to be honest. I wasn't a great big fan of Quidditch like everyone else was.</p><p>"Welcome!"</p><p>The Great Hall immediately quieted at the voice of Minerva McGonagall, the Headmistress.</p><p>She smiled brightly and said, "We would like to welcome you all to a new year here at Hogwarts."</p><p>She paused and everyone clapped and cheered. This would have been the time when the Weasley twins came out with some new explosive or firework to entertain everyone with, but of course that didn't happen anymore.</p><p>"We hope not to dwell on the sadness of the previous months, but on the happiness that we now have, even if some of those we love cannot be here to share this moment with us."</p><p>A few students, including me, Harry, and Ron, shot brightly colored sparks from our wands in tribute, before the Headmistress continued.</p><p>"We would all like to wish everyone a very, very happy school year. And with that, let us begin with the sorting!"</p><p>One by one every First year found out which House he or she would be in, and before I knew it, everyone had been sorted.</p><p>"Well there we have it, now let us enjoy the feast!"</p><p>At her words mountains of food appeared on the tables, with Pumpkin juice and various different teas. Ron and Harry immediately dug in, but Ginny and I just stared for a moment. Make no mistake, we had always had plenty of food, but it seemed that this year they had gone above and beyond anything they'd ever done before.</p><p>With a shared glance between the both of us we smiled and dug in, talking and enjoying one another's company like we usually did.</p><hr/><p>

</p><p>It was strange to be back here again, sitting at the same table with Pansy, Blaise, Theo, and Goyle. I'd had to endure Goyle's endless blubbering about the loss of Crabbe, and I couldn't really make myself care.</p><p>Nothing really mattered. I just wanted to be done with this entire bloody school year. We'd only been here a few hours and everyone's stares were already grating on my nerves.</p><p>"What do you think Malfoy?"</p><p>I turned and looked to Blaise and raised an eyebrow. He knew I hadn't heard him.</p><p>"Who do you think will get Head Girl and Head Boy?"</p><p>"Granger and some Ravenclaw no doubt." I said with a shrug.</p><p>What did I care who the fuck got the stupid title?</p><p>"Told you so," he said to Pansy.</p><p>She simply rolled her eyes and went back to her food. Blaise and Theo were talking about Quidditch and asking if I was still going to play.</p><p>"Of course I'm going to play. We need to beat Gryffindor at least one time before we graduate."</p><p>Blaise and Theo laughed, "And we will. This is the year."</p><p>Whether or not I really believed that I wasn't too sure, but there was no way I was giving up my position as Seeker.</p><p>Pansy had started talking about something to do with shoes or dances and I immediately zoned out, turning my attention to the rest of the Great Hall. They all sat, talking and laughing with each other.</p><p>It was strange to see the Great Hall like this, when just months before almost the entire building had been in ruins.</p><p>I let my eyes wander around and they landed on Granger. She was sitting next to Weasley facing me. I don't know what my feelings were towards her, honestly.</p><p>I didn't hate her.</p><p>I didn't think her blood was dirty, I'd seen that when she'd bled during the war. <em>Red.</em> Just like mine.</p><p>But I didn't particularly <em>like </em>her either. She was still best friends with Potter and Weasley, and she was a know-it-all, which was almost equally annoying.</p><p>But I couldn't deny the fact that she did look pretty fucking good with her new clothes.</p><p>I'd seen her often during the war, and she hadn't looked that bad then either, but no one had looked particularly good, so maybe it's just that everyone else looked more awful - the thought alone was hard to believe.</p><p>I didn't know. And I didn't really care. It didn't mean anything. Our past was far too complicated for our relationship to go any farther than a few nods.</p><p>And that didn't bother me either, because I had no idea what to say to her in the first place. I mean what do you say to someone you've tormented for the majority of their childhood?</p><p>"Attention everyone!" called McGonagall, silencing everyone with a look.</p><p>"I almost forgot, we have to announce Prefects and Head Girl and Head Boy."</p><p>Everyone clapped in excitement, even though to me it was obvious who was getting what roles.</p><p>"For Prefects we have...Harry Potter, Luna Lovegood, Parvati Patil, Padma Patil, Cho Chang, Blaise Zabini, and Theodore Nott."</p><p>There were a few confused claps at the mention of Blaise and Theo, not that that was a surprise. Blaise and Theo looked pleased with themselves, probably because they wouldn't have to deal with curfew like everyone else.</p><p>"Oh shut up," snapped Pansy, a sour look on her face.</p><p>I smirked, "That's alright, you can always hang out with me."</p><p>She blushed and turned away from me, but that didn't bring me the usual satisfaction I was accustomed to. It was just too <em>easy.</em></p><p>"And now, Head Girl...Hermione Granger,"</p><p>The Great Hall erupted into claps and cheers while Granger sat with a small smile on her face and a light tint to her cheeks.</p><p>"And Head Boy...Draco Malfoy."</p><p>You have got to be fucking <em>kidding</em> me.</p>
