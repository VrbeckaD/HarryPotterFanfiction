</p><p><em><strong> </strong></em> <u><em><strong>Summer 1521: London</strong></em></u> </p><p>  I was twelve when I first became entangled with the Court and the Malfoy family.</p><p> My father is Richard Granger, a physician. Being a professional man made him a gentleman and therefore allowed to give me the best education he could afford for someone of our status. My mother Amy was the daughter of a country squire and was sure to teach me etiquette and dancing, and all the fine things that a lady of some rank should know. By the time I was eleven, I could write and speak Latin, French, and Spanish fluently in addition to my native English. I could dance, sing, and sew well enough to not embarrass myself. I had rigorous knowledge of mathematics, philosophy, and the Bible. In short, I was the same as any well-educated young lady with one exception: I also was trained in healing.</p><p> Being my father’s only child meant there was no one to carry on his knowledge. I could never enter the College of Physicians like my father, but my father still taught me his knowledge of healing. Father would have me collect herbs, mix his remedies, and occasionally help set families at ease when he would attend to the sick. When my mother would be called out to attend a birth plying her trade as a midwife, she’d occasionally take me with her, teaching me her skills and giving me a possibility for the future. Father probably hoped I would go to the home of one of our rich relatives and find a respectable husband, or perhaps follow my mother in her footsteps.</p><p> That, unfortunately, was not to be.</p><hr/><p> Ten ravens were cawing and lingering by the baker across the street. I was in the physic garden in the back of the house, a small place but growing the valuable herbs Father and Mother needed for their work. I was pinching sage tips and collecting them in a basket, encouraging the plant to grow bushy and full. The heat was incredible, the May sun pounding down on my coif and causing me to sweat. Only the occasional breeze ruffling the edges of my linen shift eased the heat of my practical wool gown. My mother was directing our cook in making lunch, and Father was in his study researching ingredients for a poultice from a Spanish monograph on Moorish medicines.</p><p> Hooves clopped down the cobblestones of our London street, as they occasionally did. Being in the corner of our garden nearest to the street meant I could gaze over the short fence, and I was puzzled when I heard a great clatter and a gorgeous hunter raced past me and skidded to a halt in front of our house. Our old nag shied from the sound in the paddock.</p><p> “Hark,” I shouted. “Who calls?”</p><p> A man leapt down in midnight blue and white livery, and swept a bow. “I call upon the Mistress Amy Granger. She’s needed at the palace!”</p><p> Mother appeared at the door, wiping her hands dry. “I am she. Which lady needs me?”</p><p> He bowed to her politely. “Mrs. Granger, it’s Lady Lupin. She sent away the court midwives, said she’d only have you.”</p><p> Mother became all business. “Hermione, gather my things and our cloaks. You’re coming with me. This will be a hard birth, I’ll need you.” She removed her house apron and went back inside.</p><p> I dropped my basket and ran, my task forgotten; when I entered the kitchen through the back door I threw off the dirt-stained apron I wore and filched a clean linen apron from the basket of washing. Mother soon bustled in and tied on her own as I gathered belladonna grains, strong sweet wine, dried red raspberry leaves, catnip and cramp bark, chamomile, and olive oil as well as linens and poultices in a large wicker basket with a lid. I slipped on my hood, a serviceable English style, and washed my hands as Mother came back with our riding cloaks and fastened hers on. I took mine from her hands, and tied it on as we rushed out the door.</p><p> “We’ll be going by the Thames, Mrs. Granger. It’s the fastest route. I’ll drop you there. My Master has a barge waiting and I will be riding up to the castle to inform him of your arrival.”</p><p> “Well done. Hermione.” Mother turned to me, and I curtsied. “I’ll ride ahead with this gentleman. Get the horse and ride along with your father. He’s readying her now, he can take her home.”</p><p> Smartly she swung herself up to sit sidesaddle on the pillion behind the newcomer. “Which dock?”</p><p> “New Temple Gardens, ma’am.”</p><p> She nodded. “Tell Father, Hermione.”</p><p> Mother clattered off, and Father puffed up with our nag. Snatching me up and placing me on the back, I shouted the dock to him and he spurred her into a canter, and we followed hot on Mother’s heels to the dock.</p><p> Arriving by barge I took in the majesty of the docks at Westminster Palace. Intricate stone carvings adorned the arch leading into the hall. Being right on the water made for easy travel to and from, and I reflected on this as the barge stopped and we were swept away by another liveried man. He ushered us through the yard and into the gallery, where courtiers whispered as we passed. It became clear to me that this birth was important, and I kept my mouth shut and wits about me lest I be tricked into showing my ignorance. We were led to a small but well-furnished apartment, a tapestry on the wall depicting a silver wolf <em> passant guardant </em>. A grey-haired man paced the room, his cap in hand. I reflected on how the crest matched the man; he was much like a wolf pacing in a locked cage. With him was a dashing gentleman with long dark hair and silvered eyes and a boy, not much younger than I, with messy black hair and bottle-green eyes. All wore fine clothes, the grey man’s a little shabbier.</p><p> “Lord Lupin, the Mistress Granger and daughter are here,” the man in livery announced. Mother curtsied low, and I followed her lead. Lord Lupin stopped and bowed his head slightly.</p><p> “Mrs. Granger, my wife has just started her labor. She called for you immediately. There’s some blood and minor pains, but her ladies say she’s only starting.”</p><p> Mother nodded, and we both handed our cloaks to the man who brought us. I clutched the basket with white knuckles, and Mother stopped the man before he could leave.</p><p> “I’ll need soured white wine and hot water, sir. Bring it quickly.”</p><hr/><p> </p><p> We shut the door behind us and entered the stifling birthing chamber. The shutters were closed fast and bolted, and tapestries of forest scenes hung on the walls. The fire roared in the hearth and a lady in a gown of grey wool was mopping sweat from the Lady Lupin’s forehead as she sat in the great bed in her shift, her mousy hair loose but pulled away from her face. Another matronly lady with serious blue eyes and a brown silk dress was removing linen from a cedar chest and shaking it out, no doubt preparing for Her Ladyship to change after the birth. All was dark and oppressively warm in the May heat, meant to simulate the womb but suffocating to those of us outside it. I set aside the basket and took one of the ewers of water nearby to begin making the birthing tisane, while my mother approached the great bed and the two ladies.</p><p> “Lady Lupin,” she greeted, dropping a quick curtsy. “I’m the Mrs. Granger. Your husband sent for me. This is my daughter Hermione; she will assist me today, Your Ladyship.”</p><p> Lady Lupin let out a great moan, and the lady at her side nodded to my mother. “I am the mother of Lady Lupin, Mrs. Granger. I am Lady Tonks. Her other attending lady is Lady Exter. This is her first child.”</p><p> Mother rolled up her sleeves and I heard a knock. I opened up the door and took the bottle of sour wine and the warm water from the servant lad outside. Shutting up the door from the blessedly cool chamber outside, I went inside and fetched a basin from the toilette table, and Mother held out her hands as I poured out sour wine over them. She dried them on a piece of linen as I carried away basin, wine, and water. The water was placed near the hearth to keep warm and I filled a goblet that Lady Exter passed to me with the sweet strong wine and added a grain of belladonna. Mother bent over the bed, having hiked up the sheet and the Lady’s skirt on her shift. After a moment of inspection, she rose back up.</p><p> “The blood is normal, Your Ladyship. It is your womb stretching back so your child may go through and be born. This is your first, so the labor will unfortunately be long and hard.”</p><p> Lady Tonks nodded. “May God have mercy and deliver us a healthy boy.”</p><p> Lady Exter, Mother and I crossed ourselves. “Amen.”</p><p> Lady Tonks mopped her daughter’s head again. “Dora, I need you to be strong for me. It’s only just begun and you need to try and rest until it’s time.”</p><p> I thrust a poker in the fire until the tip glowed, then thrust the poker into the wine mixture where it frothed and bubbled. I then handed the warmed wine to Mother and she passed it to Lady Tonks, who guided her daughter to take a sip. The Lady Lupin grimaced.</p><p> “Cor, it tastes awful, Mother.”</p><p> “Lady Lupin, it is a draught to help you sleep and take away some of the pain,” Mother explained. “It’s not fine sugared wine, but it will help.”</p><p> As the concoction took effect and she nodded off to sleep, we all settled in. It would be a long wait.</p><hr/><p> </p><p> Hours later Mother had birthing fluids up to her elbows, streaked with blood. Lady Tonks was at the birthing stool with her daughter, supporting her as she sweated and grunted with effort and pain. Lady Exter stood on the other side, her red hair frizzing out of the confines of her English hood. I passed linen soaked in warm water to my mother as she worked, and kept my eye on the fine old clock on the mantel keeping time. Mother wiped one hand free of gore, and placed it on Lady Lupin’s distended belly as I counted down.</p><p> “Your Ladyship, you need to push in three...two...one!”</p><p> Lady Lupin let out a great cry, and her mother grasped her hand. “You’re doing well, Dora, you’re doing fine.”</p><p> I felt my head swimming, possibly from the heat and the fumes of the fire. I stumbled back, saw a flash of light on the wall, and felt a cool hand on my shoulder. It felt too large to be a lady but too soft and delicate to be a man, and when I turned my head to look I saw nothing but heard the whoosh of great wings.</p><p> “Hermione!” My mother cried out to me and the moment was gone. “Hand me my knife, she’s tearing! I must cut her!”</p><p> With fumbling hands I passed Mother the sharp little blade we kept for cutting the cords and situations like this. “I’m sorry Mother! Someone touched me but must have left.”</p><p> Lady Tonks looked at me incredulously. “What are you blathering about girl? There is no one but us!”</p><p> Mother shushed us all. “She’s losing blood, we need to get this child out now. Ladyship, one more great push!”</p><p> Lady Lupin was sobbing, her face pale and soaked in sweat and her shift matted to her skin in blood, fluid, and more sweat. “I-I can’t, he will be stuck there and I can’t!”</p><p> Lady Tonks grew alarmed, and I went and took Lady Lupin’s hand. “Your Ladyship, my mother is the best. We will save your son, but you must push. No matter what happens to you, he will live.” My tone rang with the tone of truth, and the room stilled for a breath.</p><p> She let out another great cry, and a bloodied bundle slid partway out. Lady Tonks grasped her daughter’s forearm as my mother shouted. “Again!”</p><p> Another cry, and the bundle slid completely out in a great rush of fluid and blood. A small wail echoed in the room, and Lady Tonks barked out a laugh. Lady Exter let out a vast sigh of relief, and murmured something about not envying the younger lady.</p><p> “It’s a boy, Your Ladyship. A healthy boy.” Mother chafed his skin with first a wet then a dry linen towel, and wrapped him in a woolen cloth. The cord was tied and trimmed, finally severing him from the afterbirth and bringing him into the world proper. She handed him to me, and I passed him to his mother, who was worryingly pale.</p><p> “My boy,” she breathed, holding him to her chest and smiling weakly. “His name is Edward Remus, for my father and my husband.”</p><p> She passed him to her mother, and fainted.</p><p> In the end, we barely managed to save her. Mother staunched the blood after frantic work, and I applied compresses of chamomile and true comfrey wrapped in linen strips to her tear as Mother spoon-fed Her Ladyship the prepared tisane I’d made hours earlier. Lady Tonks had held her grandson to her breast as we worked, and only when we managed to stop the bleeding and rouse Lady Lupin did the boy return to his mother and feed. We cleaned up quietly and sent the dirtied linens, ewers, basins, and goblets with the servants before bowing and leaving the three noblewomen to solitude and peace.</p><p> “What the Devil happened in there?!”</p><p> I shut the door as my mother squared her shoulders and glared at Lord Lupin and the other man, and they visibly shrank back at the fierce look she shot them. “I saved your wife’s life, Lord Lupin! Without me she would have bled to death and your son would be half an orphan!”</p><p> “A son?” His Lordship straightened. “I have a son?”</p><p> The dark-haired man clapped his back. “My congratulations are in order then, Remus! A son and heir for House Lupin!”</p><p> Lord Lupin pushed past us and into the birthing chamber, and we left the man to his wife and mother-in-law. “My Lord Sunderland,” my mother said, sweeping her finest curtsy at the other man. My eyes widened at the name and I dropped into my own curtsy, head low with respect. He bowed his head at us and bade us rise. “I was not expecting you to be here.”</p><p> “As if I’d miss the birth of my best friend’s son, Amy,” he replied jovially as he smiled at my mother. I gaped. My mother was on first-name basis with the Marquess of Sunderland?</p><p> “Is this little Hermione? How you’ve grown,” he exclaimed, turning his gaze to me. “I haven’t seen you since you were a snippet of a girl in Hampstead!”</p><p> I grasped for words. “How...How does His Grace know of my lady mother or I?”</p><p> He smiled rakishly. “You didn’t tell her, Amy?”</p><p> Mother huffed. “And how would I explain this to her, Sirius?”</p><p> I looked to Mother, aghast. “Explain what, Mother?”</p><p> Lord Sunderland - <em>Sirius</em> - barked out a laugh that was startlingly similar to Lady Tonk’s in the birthing chamber. “Dear little one, your mother is from a cadet branch of my family. They’re minor gentry compared to myself, but they’re still gentry and entitled to privileges.” He looked to my mother. “Why you married a physician I’ll never know. I could have called you to join us at court for a proper husband.”</p><p> I swallowed thickly, my mouth suddenly dry as sawdust. “Gentry?”</p><hr/><p> </p><p> We sat down later in Lord Sunderland’s rooms, nicer than Lord Lupin’s by a wide margin. The room was decorated in sumptuous forest greens and silver-grey, with dark wood furnishings. Mother sniffed. “Showy as ever, Sirius.”</p><p> “Aren’t I always?” He gestured us to sit. I plopped into a softly-upholstered stool, but Mother stubbornly stayed standing.</p><p> “What is this about, Sirius,” she gritted out.</p><p> “I know Hermione was distracted by something in the chamber while attending my cousin,” he said languidly, gesturing to the messy-haired boy to pour everyone wine. “What did my little cousin see, I wonder?”</p><p> “Light,” I blurted out, before I could stop myself. Heads snapped to me; hazel, grey, and green gazes all showing different emotions. My mother pursed her lips, clearly telling me to keep my mouth shut. Lord Sunderland’s eyes flashed, and I found it tumbling out of my mouth in a torrent I could not hope to stop.</p><p> “I saw light, Your Grace. Light and then I felt a hand touch my shoulder. It felt cool and was fine like a noble’s. When I turned to see whomever it was had disappeared, and I heard wings. I didn’t really see anything, Your Grace, please.” I bowed my head. Mother frowned while Lord Sunderland fixed me with a calculating glance.</p><p> “Did anything else happen, Hermione.” he queried gently.</p><p> Again I spat it out without thinking. “I felt compelled to comfort Her Ladyship during transition. She was weak and the baby could have been in danger.” I hung my head, ashamed at being disobedient to my mother’s wishes. “I told her we would save her son.”</p><p> “And so you did,” Lord- Sirius said brusquely, clapping his hands together and standing up. “Harry, bring my<em> darling cousin </em> here for a moment, will you?”</p><p>The boy Harry nodded. “Yes, godfather. I don’t need to bring the git, do I?”</p><p> Sirius laughed. “No, we won’t need him, just his wife. Try not to let anyone suspect anything.”</p><p> Harry grinned and nodded at his godfather and left the chamber. Sirius turned back to us.</p><p> “Has this happened before, dear girl?”</p><p> “No sir,” I said, shifting uncomfortably. “I was just being foolish, please I beg of you.”</p><p> “Sirius she’s just a girl. She’ll be eaten alive here at court.” Mother crossed her arms over her bloodied apron, which she had still not had a chance to take off. “You can’t send her to that woman.”</p><p> “Can and will, Amy. She’s family like you, and Hermione could be more useful here than as a midwife’s apprentice.”</p><p> “I said no, Sirius! She’s a girl, she should be home! This court is a den of snakes, I won't allow it.”</p><p> “Not much a girl any longer,” Sirius said, raking me with a glance that made me flush red in embarrassment. “She’s what, twelve? Your mother was so old when she married your father and my cousin once removed.”</p><p> Mother went pale. “Sirius, no!”</p><p> He turned to me. “Hermione, we’re at an impasse. It’s up to you and my dear cousin what happens next.”</p><p> A knock sounded, and Harry poked his head into the chamber. “She’s here, Sirius.”</p><p> “Let her in, and make sure our men are guarding the door.”</p><p> Harry nodded and moved aside. A grand lady swept into the room, her fine pale blue silk gown richly embroidered with grey threads. Her fashionable French hood sparkled with silver beads and showed a daring peek of white-blonde hair. Sirius stood to greet her. “Narcissa, my dear cousin. How are you this fine day?”</p><p> She sniffed, her cold blue eyes sweeping the room disdainfully. Harry finally came back into the chamber and closed the door again. “What do you want from me, Sirius?”</p><p> He gestured to my mother and I. “Do you remember our cousins from Hampstead? This is Amy Granger and her daughter Hermione. Ladies, this is the Lady Narcissa Malfoy, Duchess of Berkshire.”</p><p> Narcissa watched as we swept into curtsies. She inclined her head to us and we rose. “Charmed. What does this have to do with me?”</p><p> “Hermione has just assisted her mother in the birth of the newest Lupin, cousin. She saw something extraordinary.” He related my tale, and Lady Berkshire’s gaze grew sharper and more shrewd with each passing second. As her cousin finished the tale, she turned to me. “I assume she will need protection from the other families, then.”</p><p> He nodded. Mother finally had enough.</p><p> “I won’t let her.” She whirled on her cousins. “Her father and I swore she would grow up to a normal life, and marry and maybe carry on my work.”</p><p> “A common life,” Lady Berkshire shot back. “A common life for someone with her talent and her lineage? Don’t be absurd.”</p><p> She shifted her gaze back to me. “Girl, can you read and write?”</p><p> “Yes, Your Grace.”</p><p> “Can you dance, sing, and sew?”</p><p> “Well enough, Your Grace.”</p><p> “Can you speak any languages?”</p><p> “I can read, write, and speak English, Latin, Spanish, and French, Your Grace.” Where was all this going?</p><p> Her Grace nodded. “She deserves better than the life you and Richard want for her Amy. With her skills and her gift, she could rise to amazing heights.”</p><p> Mother finally sat, her eyes filmed with tears. “Please don’t, Cissa. Don’t pull her into this life.”</p><p> “She needs protected. If she has the Sight, she’ll never be safe unless it’s with us,” His Grace laid a gentle hand on my mother’s shoulder, and knelt to look at her. “We’re powerful enough, we can watch her. Help her.”</p><p> “What would Richard say,” Mother choked, her hands twisting in her lap. Lady Berkshire sniffed delicately.</p><p> “Richard would want her to come to a rich relative’s house to find a husband anyway. This way she can aspire to a very fortunate marriage. She might even jump as high as marrying my son.”</p><p> As the implications of this statement fell on my suddenly-dumb ears, my mind ran through an old rhyme the maid would sing as she washed my stockings and linen as a girl.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
