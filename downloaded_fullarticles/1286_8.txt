  <strong>Chapter 1 | Praecepta Vitae Tempus | </strong>
</p><p><em>"I thought I was wrong, but it seems I was mistaken." - Unknown <br/> </em> </p><p align="center"><strong> <em> <u>'KATERINA'</u> </em> </strong> <em> <u> </u> </em></p><p>Katerina had always thought Potion's was an art. It was the beauty in every ingredient and how quickly the potion could turn from a disgusting, horrid, muddy brown to a gorgeous, bottom of the ocean blue. Art was a perfect way to describe potions because of the intricacy of every single element, mirroring the intricacy of every single detail when painting, or drawing. It was something that one word simple couldn't describe because of the contributions to it, the flow and ease of every ingredient, the precise movements and timings. Almost like a dance. </p><p>Anyone could say Potion's was boring and lacked finesse, but of course, you cannot have finesse without passion - and those without passion lived a life in boredom, with not one bit of finesse. Maybe it wasn't as exciting as Defence Against the Dark Arts, maybe you didn't use your wand but there was magic in every small turn in potions - because you never knew what would happen next.</p><p>Much like James Potter sitting in the other corner of the Potions class with Sirius Black, you never know what the two would be up to next. You never knew if their next <em>prank </em>would be you. Or if it would be your whole house - or if it was even a prank and not some pretty excuse for bullying, annoying every core of the Slytherins. But they paid that no mind, if you were a Slytherin - as soon as that hat uttered that one word - you were mud on the bottom of their feet. </p><p>Katerina's attention was drawn from where she was glaring at the two Gryffindor's to Lilith next to her who seemed to be giving Professor Slughorn a distasteful glare, "Salazar, old Sluggy has really lost his mind." Katerina turned to Lilith who was rolling her eyes as the Professor turned to the black board, "thinking his house will actually brew something... <em>fun</em>?" The two girls turned their heads to where the rest of their housemates sat, all of them looking determinedly uninterested and thundering. </p><p>"Well I reckon they could," Katerina started, making Lilith turn to her with raised eyebrows, "Mucliber giving someone the Draught of Living Death would put a smile on his face, especially if it was just called <em>Draught of Death.</em>" Lilith chuckled into her hand, turning her head back to the front of the classroom just as Slughorn turned around beaming. "Oh god, his smile is too wide." Katerina mumbled. </p><p>Lilith smirked, "makes him look rather... fake." </p><p>"Fake?" Katerina scoffed, "more like creepy. He could give Snape a run for his money."  </p><p>Katerina had to give the Potions Professor <em>some</em> praise, the man was cunning and ambitious - far more Slytherin than half of her housemates. Sure, he was no leader but he used his connections to benefit himself, and even the students. He was a collector, but of names rather than people, and the advantages it gave him were incredible. He was a sycophant. She might've envied him if it wasn't for her own connections and his overly creepy smile. He was jolly but there was a line. And he seemed to cross it with that smile. </p><p>"Alright begin! Remember your potion must be one from your textbook - and something fun!" Slughorn tottered off to his desk with a small smile on his face, settling into his chair just as the rush of students got up from theirs and bustled into the ingredients cupboard.</p><p>Slipping out of her seat, Katerina made her way over to the cupboard, with her ingredients memorised already. She fished around the cupboard for Porcupine Quills when she felt a presence behind her, eyes pouring into her back. "Can I help you?" She snarled through gritted teeth. </p><p>Potter, the obnoxious git, nodded eagerly, "put a bag over your face, would you? The sight is really quite distracting." </p><p>"Sorry, I <em>must</em> be quite distracting if <em>you</em> of all people noticed." She smirked, brushing past him and standing on her tiptoes to grab the Wormwood. "Anything else I can do for you?" She inquired pleasantly. Katerina watched as he rolled his eyes, his frustration making her smirk cheerfully, "wonderful!" She clapped her hands together, levitating the ingredients, before her voice turned cold, "ask me to put a bag on my face again and you'll find yourself a target for<em> all</em> of my hexes."</p><p>Katerina turned on her heel, only pausing to turn and flick her wand, James' hair turning into a ghastly green just before she transfigured a small quill into a paper bag that fit nicely over his head - there were holes in it, she wasn't going to <em>kill </em>him - "You might want to keep that on, Potter, Evans might find you even more repulsing with green hair."</p><p>She smiled to herself as she left the room, placing her ingredients on her desk just as Black rushed into the closet with one look at Katerina's proud face. "What did you do, you look awfully proud." Lilith asked her as she added moonstone into her own potion.</p><p>"Lets just say what comes around, goes around." Katerina felt like grinning when Potter walked out of there trying to yank the paper bag off his head. Finally doing so and ripping it in anger, his bright green hair shining. "He should know not to insult me." She muttered under her breath to Lilith, whose eyes were firmly stuck on the bright green mop of hair.</p><p>"Holy mother of Merlin. That's brilliant!" Lilith turned to her grinning, "what did he say?" </p><p>Katerina shrugged, "nothing of importance. Though what is coming from his mouth?" </p><p>James Potter to Katerina was a thorn. He was annoying, irrelevant and his only purpose in life seemed to be insulting Slytherins, or hexing innocent people for fun. Sure they were inventive, but there was a point and he nearly always crossed it with her.</p><p>Maybe her dislike, closer to hate, for him had truly begun after a dance in their third year when he had completely insulted her dress, her makeup, her figure and her pride. He had embarrassed her so much that she had decided from that day onwards that she would hate James Potter with everything she had. </p><p>He had as well, hated her with everything. He had always hated the Slytherins thanks to Severus Snape and his possessiveness of Lily Evans, but her anger to him that grew over the years only spurred him on. Katerina didn't believe he was a bad guy, she thought <em>Edward Avery</em> was a bad guy but James Potter was just a bully. Maybe she was as well, but over the years his insults had started to make her feel low and unwanted, so she retaliated. </p><p>Slughorn seemed to have snapped out of his little daze and decided to walked around the classroom, pausing to look at James' hair before shaking his head and moving on. Katerina watched as she waited for her potion to boil, Slughorn looked to be handing out small invitations to a select few. She knew what this meant - <em>The Slug Club. </em></p><p>Katerina had the great pleasure of being invited since her fifth year, when the invites started coming out. She mainly used it to gain more connections in England, and to get free food. She didn't particularly like the club, nor the parties and dinners, too many people there were snobby and rude. Loathing boastful people had always been a good pastime for her, and funnily enough, James Potter was also boastful. Though this year he had died down slightly, Katerina was rather thankful. </p><p>"Ah! Miss Morozov and Miss Shafiq!" Slughorn announced his arrival at their table loudly, standing in front of the two girls beaming, "here you are," he handed the two girls their invitations quickly, "I expect to see you both there! You might be interested to know, Miss Morozov, that there will be an Unspeakable there and two people from the Magical Creatures department of the Ministry." </p><p>She looked up at him from the invitation, rather interested now, "do you know what division the two from the Magical Creatures Department are from?" </p><p>Slughorn pondered the question for a moment, scratching his chin lightly, "I believe I recall one of them saying the Beast Division..." he trailed off, "although it could have been Being Division." He laughed lightly, "I suppose we'll find out!" </p><p>Katerina nodded at him before turning back to the invitation, Lilith staring at her interested. "What happened to being an Unspeakable?" She inquired lowly so that Evan Rosier and Walden McNair behind them wouldn't hear. </p><p>"That's my Uncle's choice, not mine." She placed the invitation on the table, stirring her cauldron's contents, "but it is something I'm exploring, along with Magical Creatures, much to his chagrin." Katerina peered over into her cauldron, the liquid a sunshine yellow, with a sweet smell. She looked to the side and could see the rainbow forming. She smelt the potion again, wrinkling her nose and realising there was something missing. </p><p>She walked over to Snape's desk, peering over at his Draught of Living Death and snorted, "what?" He snapped. </p><p>"The task was something <em>fun.</em> Are you still learning English?" She asked him coolly, his dark eyes locking onto hers. </p><p>Narrowing said dark eyes, Snape clucked his tongue impatiently, "what do you want Morozov?" </p><p>"Will peppermint reduce the side affects of Elixir to Induce Euphoria?" She asked, looking at him with her eyebrows raised but her face was bored and detached. </p><p>"Yes," he snarled, "that's basic knowledge." </p><p>"Watch your tongue." She growled, rolling her eyes and turning away. She chopped up a small amount of peppermint and dropped it in her potion, the fresh aroma filling the air around her. If there was one thing she loved, it was the smell of mint. Maybe peppermint wasn't quite as fresh, nor spiced, but the sweet smell still made her lean forwards, inhaling and closing her eyes deeply.</p><p>She scooped out her potion just as Slughorn called time, letting them know it was the end of the lesson. Katerina watched as James handed in his potion, the same exact colour as hers, Slughorn only pausing to look at his bright green hair before shaking his head. She smiled pleasantly at the teacher as he sniffed her and beamed, "excellent! Is that peppermint I smell?" </p><p>Katerina nodded slightly, "yes, it generally gets rid of side affects." </p><p>"Yes, yes. Brilliant! Brilliant!" Slughorn shuffled in his seat, placing her small vile into a holder before looking up at her, "10 points to Slytherin." Lilith clapped her on the back cheerfully before giving in her own potion. </p><p>The two of them walked out of the classroom chatting amicably. They almost make it to charms without Katerina hexing anyone, but that's quickly demolished when the Marauders show up outside charms, Black and Potter's boisterous laughter making her skin crawl and glower darken every second it carries on for.</p><p>"Oh look! Ickle Princess of Slytherin has arrived!" Black announces. "You've even got a badge for it!!" Potter and Pettigrew laughing along with him, Lupin standing with a slightly amused face, but he looks like he wants to stop the idiotic boy. Katerina truthfully doesn't mind Lupin, he's better than the rest. </p><p>Katerina glowers at him before retorting, "the P on my robes stands for piss off, Black, oh and prefect. 5 points from Gryffindor for harassing a prefect." She snaps. </p><p>Potter scowls at her and she's is mildly surprised he doesn't whip his wand out and challenge her, "He wasn't harassing you! You told him to piss off." He crosses his arms and looks at her with distaste, "You're only taking points because it makes you feel superior, and reassurance is obviously what you need."</p><p>"I need reassurance you're not an idiot, but I'm never going to get that. And I am superior to you, blood traitor." James seems to go slightly purple at her words and she smirks, stepping back from him and turning to face Lilith. </p><p>She turns her back just for a second and she hears the slight mutter of a hex under Potter's breath, she's turning around in a flash with her wand drawn and blocking the hex instantly. "Whilst my back is turned? I thought Gryffindor's were brave, Potter." She sends a quick hex right at him, making his lips disappear and his words completely inaudible. Potter on his face now only has eyebrows, eyes and a nose. Mouth covered by skin. </p><p>Just at this moment Flitwick ushers them inside, Black looking at her with murder in his eyes. She watches as Potter tries furiously to speak but nothing comes out, only a slight movement of his skin. "Caught your tongue, Potter? Careful not to choke on it, it's been known to happen." She whispers to him as she enters the classroom, Lilith following with a chuckle and the Slytherins who take charms, all smirking at her widely. Except for Ophelia Greengrass who seems rather put out by Potter having no lips nor voice. (Probably part of his fan club) </p><p>Professor Flitwick began his lecture quickly, explaining the water making charm, <em>aguamente, </em>he hardly noticed James Potters closed mouth and Katerina thought it would be prime time to undo the hex, just as Flitwick performed the charm and James was getting angrier every minute. She flicked her wand under the table discreetly, the hex undoing itself and James shouting in the middle of the class, "-fucking charm can suck my-" </p><p>"Mr Potter!" The Professor squeaked, his wand almost dropping to the floor and Katerina smirked cheerfully, the class trying to keep their laughs intact. "That sort of language shall not be used in my classroom! 5 points from Gryffindor and detention tomorrow evening." Lilith fist bumped her under the table, the two of them trying to keep their grins off their faces. </p><p>"But sir, it was not my fault." James tried his voice pleading, "I've got to train for Quidditch-" </p><p>"Mr Potter, how can you shouting rude words in the middle of my class <em>not </em>be your fault?" Flitwick interrupted him, before sighing, "you may train tomorrow but straight after your detention will be served. 8 O'clock sharp." </p><p>James nodded, still sulking before turning to his right and a little behind to glare at Katerina who merely smiled innocently at him and turned away when Edward Avery tapped her on the shoulder. "Yes?" She asked him expectantly, searching his blue eyes for some sort of malicious intent, though she knew he would never dare to say a word against her, well to a point. </p><p>"Did you do that, or was it Mucliber?" He asked her with a slightly proud smile. </p><p>Katerina rolled her eyes, "Yes, do you really think that Mucliber has the brains for that?"</p><p>Avery seemed to liker her comment and laughed lightly, and she narrowed her eyes at this because Avery was not a laughing person, "That is true I suppose. Besides, Mucliber is more likely to send him to the infirmary." </p><p>"Like you, since you both find pleasure in violence." Katerina told him, Avery didn't even flinch at her comment - knowing it was true. He shrugged lightly and she shook her head, "anything else?" </p><p>"No, just a well done for you from me, though I would've gone with something a little more... gory." He grinned at her and she felt a chill of fear run down her back. Edward Avery was a scary person, no matter how hard she hid it, he would always scare her. He was a bad person, and it was safe to say that Katerina disliked him more than she did Potter, she was only better at concealing this fact. </p><p>Katerina turned back to the board just in time for Flitwick announcing they were to write five inches on the spell, it's uses and it's properties. She stood up with Lilith, pulling her socks back up to just below her knees. Her expensive loafers clicked against the floor as she walked out the classroom, turning to talk to Lilith, "Avery is the <em>worst </em>person I have every met."</p><p>Lilith looked at her with raised eyebrows, "A fact that is common knowledge. What did he do now?" </p><p>"Told me to go for something more gory, like I was going to make Potter bleed," She rolled her eyes animatedly just as Lilith pulled her into the bathroom to check her bob was perfection, reapplying a small coat of her rose colour lipstick, "his blood would stain the floor." </p><p>Lilith snorted an unladylike sound from her nose, making Katerina whip her head from where she was standing leaning on the white, clean walls, "I agree. Oh don't look like that, Katerina, I merely snorted." </p><p>Katerina shook her head, handing Lilith's bag back to her as the exited the bathroom, the two of them switching subjects to gossip - like how Narcissa Black and Lucius Malfoy were getting married during the summer. Of course the two were invited to the prestigious event and were already planning their outfits. </p><p>Evan Rosier and Walden McNair interrupted their chat by standing in front of them in the middle of the corridor. "Can we help?" Lilith snarled, narrowing her eyes. The girl wasn't fond of the two, but Lilith wasn't fond of many people besides Katerina, Killian Parkinson, who was her seventh year boyfriend, and Emily Macmillan in Hufflepuff.</p><p>Walden McNair looked down on Lilith, something that made Katerina lift her own chin up, she would not be put down by <em>Walden McNair, </em>"we thought we would let you know - despite out hesitation - that there will be a meeting tonight you will attend." </p><p>"We <em>will</em> attend?" Katerina glowered at him, making the boy look slightly uncomfortable, "you do not dictate us, McNair." She snatched the sheet of paper he was about hand to them both from him and ripped it in half, before setting the torn paper on fire with a silently cast Incendio. "How's that for our answer?" </p><p>Evan Rosier turned to her with a softer look, if that was possible from his hard eyes, something Katerina despised because she had always thought Rosier smart, and not so bad looking, even if he was unbelievably manipulative. "I believe what Walden was trying to say, is that you guys should come. It's an option and well worth you coming. Don't tell me you're not curious?" He asked her. </p><p>And with that, he slipped the small piece of paper in her hand, closing her fingers around it with his own before walking off, McNair trailing behind him. She rolled her eyes, crumpling the small paper and turning towards Lilith, "fancy going down to the Quidditch pitch tonight instead?" </p><p>Lilith chuckled, placing a stray, short piece of hair behind her ear, perfecting her bob, "you know I would but Killian has asked me to meet him tonight." Katerina raised her eyebrows at this new piece of information causing Lilith to scowl, "don't look at me like that!" </p><p>"Like what?" Katerina asked her nonchalantly, "Like you're going to have a secret, <em>private </em>meeting with your boyfriend at night?" </p><p>"Oh stuff it ice queen." Lilith grumbled before standing up straighter, "I have a right to do whatever I please with my boyfriend." </p><p>Katerina snorted as they walked down the stairs to the Slytherin common room, "ah yes, oh so very gentlemanly Killian Parkinson." She drawled sarcastically, "<em>magica sanguine</em>." The passage opened up, velvet green carpet on the stone floor leading them into the beautiful emerald green coloured common room. </p><p>The two girls made their way over to the edge of the common room, two sofas opposite each other and the glass showing the depths of the Black Lake to the side of them. Katerina placed her bag on the floor, settling down in her usual spot and picking up her book, showing the title of <em>1000 Potions You Didn't Know Existed. </em>"I don't know why you like him, Lilith, he's rather vile." </p><p>Lilith sighed as she pulled her Divination homework out, "I know your opinion of him, Katerina, but I like him because he's good to me. He's smart and responsible; he's got a life ahead of him. He wants to go into the Ministry and he'll treat me well." </p><p>"You'll be a trophy wife." Katerina pulled her book down so she could see Lilith, "is that really what you want from him, just because he's stable? You would be part of his little collection, part of his little perfect life whilst you would sit still and look pretty. That does not sound like you at all." Lilith by this point was staring up at the dark haired girl, her lips pulled into a tight, frustrated frown. </p><p>"Maybe it doesn't have to sound like me." Lilith placed her pen down, smoothening out her skirt, "I like Killian and I wish to spend the rest of my life with him." She paused before turning to Katerina, "just because it's not the life <em>you</em> would choose, doesn't mean it's not what I would choose. I am not you Katerina." </p><p>Katerina nodded tightly, shutting her book and standing up, "I'm going to change and then go on a walk." She quickly made her way up the short flight of stairs to the sixth year dormitories and opening the dark, mahogany door, striding into the large, circular room and heading straight for her bed.</p><p>She tossed her bag on the velvet green blanket, the light from the chandelier from the centre of the room making it easy for her to look in her wardrobe. She hung her robes up on the hooks to the right of her bed, pausing for only a moment to look through the window, pushing the pulled back curtain with her hand slightly, before sighing and pulling out her green Quidditch jumper and tugging on a black pair of trousers with them.</p><p>She quickly unpacked her bag, putting her books on her shelf to the left of her bed above her bedside table, and then promptly left, slipping her wand into her pocket. </p><p>The air was cool as she walked outside, October winds blowing her hair and causing her to pull it back into a low ponytail. She had never had a problem with cold air, finding it rather nice to be around. Katerina tended to also like having warm hands in the cold, pressing them against her cheeks lightly and feeling the difference. </p><p>Bringing her broom out of the broom cupboard, where it was kept under a few hexes and curses, she jumped on it, soaring the air around the Quidditch pitch, flying over the banners as the sun set and flying over to her place. A place where no one knew about, not even Lilith.</p><p>Her feet landed gracefully on the ground as she slipped off her broom, placing it on the floor as she sat under the beautiful oak tree that looked over the Black Lake, Hogwarts in front of her. </p><p>Katerina loved the peace there, the way you could watch the sun set and just <em>breathe. </em>It was peaceful in a whole other way, almost watching the sky darken and the world she was surrounded by go to sleep.</p><p>She treasured these small moments, these small but beautiful moments that she knew wouldn't make Mucliber even blink, because someone like him couldn't see the beauty in it. </p><p>But she did. She did and she loved it.</p><p>Which was maybe why she drew, capturing each and every small moment, every little detail. Sometimes it wasn't enough because you couldn't do the picture justice, and others, others were from memory, things she had learnt by heart because she loved to draw every, single bit of it. She knew every piece of some pictures by heart, like Hogwarts, she knew the outline like it was her home. In an odd way, it was. </p><p>Other pictures, like the one she drew right at this moment, were not from memory because they changed all the time. Each time she visited, somehow it would get prettier, more wonderful. Maybe it was spring, maybe there were ripples on the water, maybe the clouds in the sky ceased to exist and there was just a moon and stars. She had never been able to capture the moment perfectly, but you could never perfect perfection.</p><p>She traced her pencil over the page, the grey outlining the almost full moon. A true sight to see. </p><p align="center">***</p><p>It had started to rain on her way back inside, her drawings clutched beneath her jumper and her hair dampening more and more with every passing second. She didn't exactly mind the rain though; Katerina believed it was rather relaxing, the light sound of the rain hitting the window or the small beads hitting your skin. </p><p>Katerina had only gotten so far, just past the jetty into the black lake when she saw it. The beautiful animal laid by the water peacefully, vast and royal. She stared in disbelief at the animal, thinking back to the hundreds of books she had read about all the different types magnificent creatures and desperately trying to remember if she had seen this one. </p><p>Surely she would remember if she had, though if she had seen an image, she didn't know if it could quite grasp the beauty. Flicking through her memories she pulled a book she had read before, <em>Beautiful &amp; Majestic Animals </em>by <em>Barbra Woolley, </em>a muggle book if she remembers correctly. Katerina fiddled with her thumbs as she made her way over, desperately trying not to alarm the incredible animal. </p><p>As she walked towards it, she embraced the wondrous beauty of the stag. A coat of light brown fur, almost a ginger, with a dark streak running down its face, eyes closed and lengthy lashes fluttering against the fur. The horns were proud and tall, strong and seemingly fearless. The stationary stag hadn't noticed her still and she was able to see the darker fur trailing down it's legs.</p><p>Katerina slowly bent down, sitting with her legs crossed and facing the stag. How would one approach such an animal? She stayed still, her breathing softening as the stag slowly acknowledged her presence. Katerina met the stag's eyes, trying to put her own worth in her gaze. Katerina crept out her hand, stroking the tam creature delicately and watching with joy as it seemly melted in her touch. </p><p>"You're beautiful." She whispered, "What is such a beauty doing here?" The stag looked up at her soft voice, shoving her arm lighting with it's nose to keep stroking its fur and she obliged quickly, a small chuckle escaping her lips. She didn't even mind the rain soaking her, and the stag didn't seem to mind either. "I've always admired deer, they're rather gorgeous. Elegant and graceful are better words in fact." Her mouth twitched, her cheeks tightening as she smiled down at the mystical animal.</p><p>There are some moments in life that you never forget, and there are moments in life that can define you. For Katerina, this moment was both. Because being entrapped by something gives you a disadvantage because you are not aware of those around you. And being enraptured by the stag in front of her, she did not notice the boy a way behind her. A scheming smile on his face as he plotted his sweet, sweet revenge. </p><p>This moment in time was something James Potter would never forget either, and it would define him and flip his world. Because as he schemed his plan, he failed to take into account that he would have to get to know the inner works of Katerina Morozov, and that was something he was never prepared to do. Which might've been why the stars seemed to turn that day, because a new future was on the horizon, a future that no one was prepared for. </p><p>Revenge was on the plate, and love wasn't. But oh how the tables turned when James Potter began to plot his revenge. </p><p>Who would've expected the Golden Gryffindor Boy to fall for the Sanctimonious Slytherin Princess? </p>
