    <p>CHAPTER ONE:</p><p> </p><p>Ron was excited as he sat there on Platform 9 ¾, waiting for the Hogwarts Express to arrive from Hogsmead station.  He hadn’t seen her since the Christmas holidays.  She had claimed she was too busy being Head Girl and revising for her N.E.W.T.s to come home during Easter break.  He had been disappointed that letters from her had diminished so much since she returned, but he convinced himself it was only because she’d been so busy.  It would be good again now that she was back.  He had missed her so much.  He had so much to tell her, and he couldn’t wait.</p><p> </p><p>He was going to tell her about the small cottage he had bought and then ask her to move in with him.  He was going to tell her how Auror training had finally sparked the student in him.  How what he was learning had so many practical uses and was actually related to real life and to being an effective Auror so he was motivated like never before, like he had never been at Hogwarts.  He was sure she would be so proud when he told her that he was first in his Auror class in the physical tests like running, strength, agility and actual spell casting, but he was also first in the class academically, actually getting better scores than Harry himself.  But mostly Ron was going to tell Hermione how much he loved her and how he was so looking forward to being together now.  Maybe even forever, he thought.</p><p> </p><p>How long until the train gets here? he wondered.  Ron looked up and down the platform and he saw several people he recognized.  Neville was to his left probably waiting for Luna.  Harry was right next to him waiting for Ginny.  The three of them were thrilled to actually have the weekend off from Auror training.  One more week of training, then graduation, and then they’d be starting at the Ministry as Junior Aurors.  Ron couldn’t wait to use his training to help track down the remaining Death Eaters that had so far eluded custody and trial.  He finally had purpose and direction in his life and he was thrilled he’d be able to share that with Hermione.</p><p>Finally the train arrived and everyone leapt to their feet to meet the returning students.  Ron saw Luna depart and head toward Neville.  Harry saw Ginny and ran to greet her with a hug and a long lingering kiss.  Since they reconnected after the war Ron didn’t have any trouble seeing them together.  In fact he was truly pleased to see how they made each other happy.  He was dismayed that he hadn’t seen Hermione yet.  Ginny came over hugged her brother.  “Have you seen Hermione?” he asked her.  “Where is she?”  Ginny replied, “I think she has Head Girl things to do before she gets off.  Don’t worry, she’ll be here soon.”  “I hope so,” said Ron.  With that, Harry grabbed Ginny’s trunk, shrunk it down and put it in his pocket.  Turning to Ron, Harry said “see you at the Burrow for dinner tonight?”  “Absolutely” replied Ron.  And then Harry and Ginny apparated away.  Ron wasn’t sure where they were going, but he wasn’t sure he wanted to know.</p><p> </p><p>And then she was there.  Ron saw Hermione finally leave the train and watched as she too shrunk her trunk and put it in her pocket. “Hermione!” he cried and he ran to her.  He went to kiss her, but she turned her head and all Ron got was her cheek.  Confused, he tried to kiss her again and was again met with only her cheek.  “Hermione?  What’s going on?” he asked.  Hermione quietly replied, “Ron, we need to talk.  Somewhere more private.”  Ron moved them over to a bench and they sat down.  </p><p> </p><p>Hermione looked at Ron and began to talk.  “Ron, I’ve had a lot of time to think since Christmas.  I’m sorry, but it just isn’t there anymore.  The spark between us has faded and I want to break up.  What we had was a wartime fantasy, but the war is over and I’m ready to move on.  We’re too different, and not…  not in a good way.  You are looking to have a good time and just want to get by, but I want to be great, shaping and changing the world.  You’re happy with food and Quidditch, I’m happy with work and books and making things happen.”  By this time she had tears on her cheeks and a sad forced smile on her face.  “But Hermione,” Ron replied, “I’m not…”  “No, Ron,” Hermione interrupted.  “This is what I’ve decided and I can’t talk about it anymore.  I’m going to my parents and starting my new job at the Ministry on Monday.  Goodbye Ron.”  Then she stood and apparated away.</p><p> </p><p>Ron stood; shocked, staring down at where she was just sitting.  “What just happened?” he thought.  His vision of the future, with him as an Auror and them sharing the cottage while she worked at the Ministry just evaporated.  He sat back down on the bench and put his head in his hands.  His thoughts continued, “I didn’t even get a chance to tell her that I’m different, that I actually enjoying studying when learning practical and useful magic.  I didn’t get a chance to tell her how well I’m doing and how she inspires me to be the best Auror so that I can keep her safe.  What am I going to do now?  She was the whole reason I started this, and now what do I do?  How do I live?  How do I keep going when my reason for living has just been taken away from me?  How do I survive?"</p><p> </p><p>Still somewhat in a daze, he finally looked up and realized he was the only one on the platform.  Or he thought he was the only one when he noticed someone down on the other end of the platform also sitting on a bench.  From where he was it looked like Luna, but he couldn’t be sure.  He stood and walked toward her and quickly realized she was sobbing as she sat.  </p><p>“Luna?”  He asked tentatively.  “Is that you?  What’s wrong?”  Luna looked up and Ron noticed her eyes were red and swollen and her cheeks were covered in tears.  “Ron, is that you?” she asked with a quivering voice.  “Yeah, Luna, it’s me,” he replied softly  “Are you ok?”  “Oh Ron,” she cried and jumped up and wrapped her arms around him and buried her face on Ron’s chest.  Ron instinctively hugged her and held her as she continued to sob.  “ssh, ssh, now, it’s ok, it’s ok, I’ve got you, I’ve got you,” Ron tried to comfort the distraught girl.  “Tell me what’s wrong, Luna, what’s got you so upset?  And where’s Neville?  Wasn’t he going to meet you?”  With that Luna let out a strangled scream “Neville is what’s wrong!!” And then she buried deeper into Ron’s chest and hugged him even tighter.</p><p> </p><p>After what seemed like an hour, but was probably only a few minutes, Luna’s sobs began to slow and quiet down.  She looked up at Ron and sniffed hard and wiped her nose on her sleeve.  “Neville just broke up with me,” she said quietly.  “It was a complete surprise.  I thought I was going to live with him after Hogwarts.  Daddy’s still in St. Mungos and our house hasn’t been repaired enough to live in.  I have nowhere to go now.”  “Wow,” thought Ron "this is too weird."</p><p> </p><p>“Well, Luna, you can stay with me.  I’ve got room.”  Luna looked up surprised.  “What about Hermione?  she asked. “Isn’t she going to live with you?  That’s what we all thought.”  “You’re not going to believe this, but you’re not only one who was dumped today, Ron replied sadly.   “Hermione also just broke up with me.  Let’s get your stuff and I’ll apparate us home.”</p>
