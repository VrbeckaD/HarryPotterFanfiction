    <p>
  <span>Specks of cerulean dot the silver grey haze of his gaze. It's the last thing she sees before opening her eyes and it reminds her of something, no - someone - but it feels just out of reach, stretched the tiniest bit beyond the recesses of her mind and memories. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione Granger knows very few things for certain. She knows her name, knows she’s wandless and warded within an empty seaside estate with one free elf tending to her needs, and she knows there’s more to the story of her stumbling there injured than meets the eye. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She thinks, maybe just maybe, if she can untangle the web of memories buried just below the surface, she might one day be free. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her past is a blank slate. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No friends, no schools, not even parents to associate with formative years that should have shaped who she is now. But who exactly is she now? She starts with something she knows: her name, and as someone once said… though her mind thrums with restless tension as she tries to place just who.... But someone, somewhere once asked what was in a name. And now, with her toes buried deep under the surface of the sand, she wonders what indeed. What a name truly is. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though deep down she knows her name, Hermione doesn’t roll off her tongue. Despite knowing, just </span>
  <em>
    <span>knowing</span>
  </em>
  <span>, it’s been hers since the beginning, it feels like cotton in between her teeth, rough, sticking to her cheeks and unnatural on her tongue as she tries to say it aloud. Maybe it’s the saltwater splashing the face of the rocks or the wind whipping up the cliffs and billowing between the trees, maybe it’s her own throat’s obvious disuse, either way, it comes out stilted. It sounds like a foreign word she can’t properly place but something inside of her whispers otherwise. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She’s only been awake for a few hours, if that. Finding no clocks in the part of the estate she dared to wander, the sun seems to track the time just fine. It’s moved a quarter of the way through the sky, cresting in the middle and just now barely beginning to dip. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The breeze whips the wind around her but it’s warm. There are flowers in bloom off in the distance, across the wide cliff in a field she can barely see. She thinks it must be spring, or shortly before between the splotches of color and the warmth of the breeze tangling her curls. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione has always been observant. Oftentimes absurdly so and as such, she collects each piece of information about the climate, the sand, the wind, and the trees and stacks them neatly in a corner of her seemingly unfilled mind under the simple label of facts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The list grows throughout the day as she meanders her way back inside and discovers she quite likes the tea the elf — No, Minnie she reminds herself — the tea Minnie has made with a dash of milk and two cubes of sugar. She knows now she likes tea made this way and little toast rounds with a thin layer of jam. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>By the time the sun sets, sinking below the line of trees just beyond where she felt the wards, she knows she feels trapped. Trapped within this sprawling estate and mostly alone, but also trapped within her own mind. Her head has throbbed a few times, the insides pulse with the unknown and Minnie has been supplying her with a potion of some kind each time it flares as she tries to focus on what’s hidden in the depths she can’t seem to reach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The next day passes much the same. Small tidbits slot into place forming and shaping some version of herself she doesn’t seem to truly know beyond simple likes and dislikes. Each time the sun rises, a total of seven based on the marks in her leather bound journal, Hermione somehow feels less and less certain of the litany of facts she’s collected and hoarded away within the ragged pages of the book she’d found to record them in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Meaningless observations pile up as time crawls by. She thinks if she doesn’t write down each and every new speck of information, she’ll somehow lose it all again and have to start all over. How long would it take if she woke up again with a few megar facts to learn what she’s recorded? When might she learn the rain soothes her to sleep or the way the wind dries out just the tip of her nose if she sits on the cliffs too long?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Spring turns to summer and days bleed together, single scratches adding up one after another until a page is full and the bound journal is stuffed with meaningless tidbits of information the surprisingly well stocked library has supplied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione now knows her mind has been altered. Though she thinks she knew that before, her months of research on memory charms and spells have yielded few definite answers. A nagging suspicion in the back of her mind thinks she may have known it was coming. Somehow, unlike most cases she’s poured over the last few months, her mind feels like it had a clean sweep. Unlike Obliviation, there seems to be small things that trigger unrelated memories. She’ll feel a faint hint of recognition from time to time with certain books, certain passages. Never inside the house, and only a handful of times by the sea, but she’s felt her fair share nonetheless. Legilimency seems to fit the bill, and she thinks maybe she was an Occlumens, fears she may have even done this herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Memories and moments feel just out of reach, as if barricaded behind high walls and hoarded for a time she isn’t certain will ever come. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Seventy four days in, she finally feels a sense of relief as she dreams for the first time in months. Night after night they continue and Hermione finds herself hoping for answers. Dreams seem to be her only true glimpses of what might have once been her life. Some nights she feels calloused hands glide along her curves, hears mumbled promises of safety whispered against her skin, and searing kisses branding every inch of her flesh. Flashes of nights spent tangled in sheets and times pressed against the cold wall of a shower as blood or mud or something equally disconcerting circles the drain haunt her for weeks. Strong hands grip her sides as someone shields her from a green blast before the tug of remembered apparition wakes her to soaked silk sheets and beads of sweat gathering at her temples.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sitting up in the sprawling four poster bed that could easily fit ten of her with room to spare, wet silk clinging to her bare legs, Hermione pictures dots of cerulean swimming in a sea of molten silver and feels the sting of swollen lips like a ghost on her own. A shiver trills up her spine and she reaches for her notebook, cataloging the memory to dissect before it slips back behind the wall she has yet to fully breach. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Slowly the summer turns to fall and the trees drop their leaves as the temperature dips day by day. The dreams have been steady, small glimpses that have yet to form a bigger picture are stocked in her small notebook now brimming with pieces to some seemingly unsolvable puzzle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her mind has been altered, her memories tucked away. Being able to recall with precision everything that has passed since she woke up in this daze proves it doesn’t seem to be an ongoing problem. And as she traces it back to the beginning, when her eyes first fluttered open and the light drowned out everything in the room she now knows as her own, no obvious catalyst seems to emerge.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Just like the bits of information she’s recorded from the books and the slivers of what she’s sure was once reality she sees when she sleeps, Hermione begins dissecting the scars she’s catalogued on her own body. They are, like the rest of the facts jamming the tiny notebook, irrefutable and wholly a part of who she is now, and who she once was as well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A word that makes her shiver is carved into her arm, jagged peaks and puckered skin suggest some sort of cursed device. Other small slices and raised lines are dotted all over her body. She has a long thin scar between her ribs, a long line of speckled scars adorning her right thigh, and twelve other areas with barely there scars that, if magical healing weren’t involved, all look to have been nearly lethal.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione scratches the word </span>
  <em>
    <span>Soldier</span>
  </em>
  <span> on the bottom of one of the last free pages in her journal. She quickly draws a line through it and instead writes </span>
  <em>
    <span>Scarred</span>
  </em>
  <span> - </span>
  <em>
    <span>War? Fight? Life threatening?</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It isn’t until Winter is in full swing, snow dusting the cliffs and hanging off the bare branches of the trees she’s tried too many times to count without success that a distinct </span>
  <em>
    <span>pop</span>
  </em>
  <span> sounds from somewhere on the grounds. Eyes wide, mind whirling a million miles a minute, Hermione rushes from the worn leather chair she thinks of as her own in the library she’s been all but living in and nearly topples her stack of books on her way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The hair on her arm prickles as she walks quickly to the front door. They swing open without preamble and someone stumbles in, coated in blankets of snow and leaving wet boot prints in their wake. Shaking off the hood of the black robes, a flash of bright blonde causes her breath to catch.</span>
