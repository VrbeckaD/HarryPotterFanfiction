          <div class="userstuff"><p>Hermione stood alone before the grave. She didn't know how long it was since the other mourners had left.<br/>"To have found you. <br/>"To have loved each other so very much. <br/>"To have survived the war together." she whispered.<br/>"To have lost you to something as stupid as a train crash.<br/>"To feel so, so alone."<br/>She took a deep breath and sang the line quietly, unable to stop her voice cracking at the end.<br/>"I'd trade all my tomorrows for one single yesterday...."<br/>Hermione leant forwards and, with infinite tenderness, hung the butterbeer cork necklace on the new gravestone.</p></div>
