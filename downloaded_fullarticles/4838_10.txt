    <p>(This chapter that follows acts in the form of a prologue to initiate a back story to the charters in the earlier years of school. Therefore, isn't written the way the other chapters shall be...)</p><p> </p><p>I was never one to relish in the possibilities of civilian life, with menial dribble that was simply a waste of time. Instead, dabbled in the artistic nature of experimental procedures. Being a mere eleven years of age I was further advanced than most my peers. Therefore, surrounding myself with those of a primitive brain capacity for knowledge was something I didn't forego. Although, isolation never agreed with me, yet that isn't something worth divulging to anyone in close proximity to my life. </p><p>All of that being said, it was no surprise that I -the brightest boy of my age by far- was amongst the few whom had the privilege to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in September. The letter of acceptance stunned both my parents and to no surprise, my brother. Whom always told me that I was never worthy of the gift as only superior people harness such talent -obviously egocentric- as he did, and was two years above. My parents both where non magical therefore this ultimately created tension throughout the summer, until it was finally time for departure. </p><p>                              ∞ ϟ 9¾ ♔ ⚯͛ △⃒⃘</p><p>I stood transfixed upon the cemented ground beneath my feet as I gaped in awe at the engine that lay in wait. People where passing by to gain their passage and others waiting to send their offspring on the adventure of knowledge. This was unfamiliar territory to me. </p><p>My parents to no surprise didn't accompany me to the station in fear that they would be outcasts and shunned for their lack of ability. Which was quite frankly ridiculous. However, Mycroft did, yet left me just before anyone spotted us together. Something about his reputation being tarnished...</p><p>After moments of bewilderment, I made my way upon the train to obtain a seat; preferably alone. However, I knew due to the multitude of bodies that board, that would be rather unlikely, but I lay in hope. </p><p>My legs brought me to an empty carriage and before anyone else could snatch it from my grasps I slipped inside and closed the door behind. Later proceeded to haul my luggage into the compartments before taking a seat and gazing out the window in wait for movement.</p><p>The wrong kind came. </p><p>A ruckus at the door brought my attention towards it. Only for me to notice a smaller figure concealed by a case that was too large for them to carry. Being the gentleman I was, I turned my attention back to the window. </p><p>The disruption continued, and caused an equal amount to my lack of caring for the situation. So, I stood and stalked my way to the door. <br/>Upon opening it the case and the figure it concealed both stumbled into the carriage bringing with them a loud thump, as well as groans. </p><p>With a evident rolling of the eyes and an melancholic exhale, I extended my hand for the figure to take. Which it did. </p><p>"Thank you-" it mumbled. Only then it was evident it was a young man whom was speaking. </p><p>The figure proceeded to rub at the aches caused by the sudden fall, before picking the case from the floor where it lay. After everything was settled they turned and faced me, hand outstretched. </p><p>"I'm John Watson. Sorry about that, my mum packed my case and turns out I can't really carry it" <br/>he stated while visibly failing to conceal his laugh. naturally I obliged to the handshake due to my manners. </p><p>"Sherlock Holmes, and yes you do seem to have struggled" I said nonchalantly, before lowering my outstretched hand and making my way towards the seat I once sat. </p><p>"Do you mind?" John asked from his stance from the centre of the floor. </p><p>Without averting my gaze from the window -as I was seeking refuge in the bustle of London's platform- I simply nodded and motioned towards the empty seat across from where I sat. </p><p>The movement continued as John evidently struggled to move his case from where it lay. So naturally I groaned and shut my eyes to drown out the visuals projected on the window of John's struggle, until it ceased. </p><p>"Are you alright?" John questioned, as he more and likely sat down. Upon opening my eyes I noted that John was indeed sitting, with his legs outstretched on the entirety of the seat and head perched upon the sill of the window. </p><p>"Yes, quite alright." I replied nonchalantly. I knew that I should be attempting the whole socialising thing, but couldn't bring myself to do as such due to my nonexistent track record and lack of friends. </p><p>"Are you excited?" John asked after a brief moment of silence which I in turn happened relish in. </p><p>"Yes, actually. I am happy to get away from home and learn." stating with a sigh. I was  really excited about starting Hogwarts and becoming an extremely talented wizard. The journey itself was thrilling. </p><p>"As am I, more the knowledge thing though. I can't wait to learn everything." He stated enthusiastically. </p><p>This answer startled me, I was not expecting another like myself. Whom would rather learn than find the time their itself the best aspect. This could possibly be the start to something...</p><p>-</p><p>The ride to Hogsmead went without incident which baffled me as usually interaction lasting longer than mere minutes becomes somewhat problematic. John was surprisingly compassionate, sensitive and humorous. The combination of personality traits was hard to find in a person whom usually found themselves in close proximity to me. However, I relished in the moment as I was sure it would not last. </p><p>**</p><p>The platform here was much less grand than the one I previously left and rather mediocre in terms of a 'wizarding' station. Yet, the first impression was soon obliterated due to the giant man that beckoned our presence. He loomed over each student like an ominous structure which opposed his humble welcoming. <br/>In a formal line John and I strode towards the boats with luggage a mere memory. </p><p>The spectical was like nothing I had ever witnessed. With the castles silhouette glistening ever so slightly in the water, the whispers of the wind as it carried us ashore, and the magical emission that danced across my features. It was breathtaking. However, nothing had prepared me for what lay behind the doors in wait. </p><p>- </p><p>A woman with a bun that looked awfully tight to be seen as fashionable greeted us as we ascended the steps that groaned beneath our feet. We where asked to wait until preparations had ceased. So I stood with John until her presence was made once more. </p><p>"What house do you think you will be sorted into?" A young boy with brown hair and an oval face questioned me with a slight tugging of my robes. I turned and gave him a quizzical look to show my confusion. "What?" I added when he clearly didn't understand my expression.</p><p>"Mudblood" was all he said in return and stepped further away from me, so that their was a step between our distance. </p><p>I turned to John but before I could question as to what that was, the woman who's name I had already forgotten approached once again. </p><p>This time we made our way towards the front of the hall. It was like hearding sheep into an unfamiliar territory. Each of us expressed the same bewildered look, at the startling scenery. Until we stopped before a set of stairs that held after them a hat which sat upon a stool. How bizarre. </p><p>One at a time our names where called. Something called sorting was underway. I had figured that this is what the boy had meant when he questioned me earlier-</p><p>"Sherlock Holmes." The woman bellowed across the entirety of the room, to which I perked up and averted my attention to her. I proceeded to the steps where I took them with caution, and glanced back at John for reassurance, to which he smiled, until I was firmly upon the seat and the hat sat on my head. <br/>"Ah...great amount of knowledge here. However, bravery is prominent, also loyalty, yet you lack the ability to form friendships easily... must be Gryffindor" the hats voice resounded off all four walls, before an ear piercing applause broke out from the crowd. As I made my way towards my future house I was engulfed within numerous arms and bone breaking hugs before I was allowed to sit. </p><p>"John Watson" was shouted moments after I was comfortably sat upon my seat. I watched him as he stalked the stairs and took his seat beneath the hat in wait of his fate. After several seconds of back and forth from the hat in deliberation... "Slytherin" was exclaimed throughout the room. A subtle inhale was taken from the majority of the students before applause erupted yet again. So much for making friends...</p><p>-</p><p>Dinner was a grand spectical of amazement and uncertainty. However, once accustom to the workings of the magic I settled in after mere minutes. </p><p>To my left was a boy named Graham, or was it Gregory, or George, I wasn't quite sure. However, he just like me has non magical parents and somehow became magic himself, so instantly we bonded over shared experiences. To my right was a girl named Molly Hooper whom was polite enough, yet hardly spoke. Naturally we became friends as I relish in the quiet of people in order to think. </p><p>**</p><p>After introductions and a meal we where escorted to where we would be staying for the foreseeable future. The stairs where like no others. They shrieked beneath your touch and after moments decided to move and confuse your path just because they could. Their games made our duration to our destination longer which ultimately annoyed the prefect whom was showing us the way. </p><p>Once approached, the portrait held a woman whom resembled my aunt on a good day. A password was needed to gain access which in turn, if forgotten it would not be granted. "Padfoot" was it and it was perfectly simple to recall. </p><p>Just like the Great Hall and the boat ride, the Common Room was not exempt from the grandeur and astonishment the castle had to offer. Each year had been assigned a floor and us being the youngest where escorted to the top.</p><p>"Boys on the Left, and Girls on the Right. Any who don't conform to the binary, your rooms are straight on" The prefect stated right before his departure. </p><p>To this I squirmed internally yet was naturally dragged by Graham to a group of boys squabbling as we divided ourselves up into who was most likely to become your friend. Room requirements where basically a social construct designed to pick on the loner. Whom to my surprise was not me. <br/>I happened to share my room with 4 other people, one in which was Gethan, or George. </p><p>My luggage was located at the end of my bed in a neat pile, with the owl I acquired at the bedside table. </p><p>Without a moments hesitation I strode towards the bed, and threw myself onto it. I didn't even have the energy to change into different attire that was suitable for sleeping in. Instead I let my head hit the pillow and be lured into a sleep that brought with it dreams of the future.</p><p>**</p><p>My slumber was disrupted by a residual shaking that was coming from my arm. Upon the open of my eyes I noticed that it was none other than Graham...Greg? That was attempting to wake me. <br/>"I'm awake..." I stated before a yawn erupted from my mouth. </p><p>"Sure looks like it." He stated as he laughed slightly at my inability to keep my eyes open. "Come on we will be late for breakfast." </p><p>I couldn't argue with that, so I hauled myself off of my bed and made my way to my trunk to obtain clean clothes. </p><p>After several minutes of attempting to gain access into the robes we where on our way towards the Great Hall for breakfast.</p><p>Like the dinner the previous night, breakfast was also a feast. However, with it being rather early my appetite was somewhat lacking. Therefore I sat in wait for time when class would begin, which to my benefit wasn't long.</p><p>"Hurry Graham we will be late for our first class." I stated as everyone was departing the Great Hall in an orderly fashion.</p><p>He in turn stared at me and a small smile was evident on his face. "It's Greg" he said nonchalantly. "I'm done come on." Greg replied while he stood and placed a piece of toast between his teeth and hurried to make it to the door. I naturally followed in tow. </p><p>The never ending maze that is Hogwarts was all encompassing as we trailed our way down unfamiliar corridors. Each more bizarre than the last. It took several blind attempts at running down a corridor to find the one in which our class lay in wait as it taunted our journey.</p><p>**</p><p>We stood outside the room that held our first class; Defence Against the Dark Arts. Slytherin first years much like Gryffindor where perched against the walls. Some where huddled in groups and others -stranglers- that did not belong in any. I naturally searched the sea of heads for the familiar brown. <br/>His height would undoubtedly mask his presence. Although, his face caught my eye as he was stood amongst a circle of Slytherin's discussing what I didn't know. </p><p>"John..." I stated quietly as not to disturb the silent hum of conversation. "John" I expressed more loudly, this time granting stares from practically everyone, including John himself. </p><p>He took notice of whom said his name and strode his way towards me with his friends following suit. "Yes?" He questioned as he stood meters away from where I was. I hadn't actually pondered what it was I was going to say in this particular moment, all I knew is that if I didn't say anything it would be profusely weird. </p><p>"Well..." I stared before rubbing my hand across my neck. My embarrassment and awkwardness gained a slight smile from John. Not one of malicious intent but of understanding. "I just wanted to say hi really." I mumbled and began to recoil in steps. </p><p>"Hey..." he responded cheerfully, however that was before he received an elbow to the stomach from his peer. </p><p>"Why are you even talking to me mudblood?" John exclaimed moments after as he walked closer to where I now stood, whilst noticeably rubbing his aching stomach. Once approached he pushed me in the chest to make his point valid. </p><p>I am sure he would have done more damage if it wasn't for the cough that elevated itself over the ruckus. </p><p>"Mr Watson, if you would kindly move away from Mr Holmes here that would be much appreciated." Naturally John backed off due to this request. "Thank you. Now everyone inside." The man commanded, to which everyone obliged.</p><p>**</p><p>"Today class we will be learning a simple blocking spell against a primitive jinx." <br/>The man stated at his position at the front of the class. </p><p>"I know this is your first day so I guess introductions are in order before we commence" he verbalised before moving from around the back of his desk. </p><p>"I am Professor Potter." He voiced. To which many gasps and whispers erupted. I in turn was none the wiser as to whom this man was.  </p><p>"Yes, yes no need for that... I am no longer a student or for that matter the chosen one, just Professor Potter so please treat me as such." He said with a exasperated tone, as if he had rehearsed this and repeated it several times. </p><p>Once class was underway, I turned to Greg. "Who is that man?" I questioned in a whisper as to not draw attention to the conversation. </p><p>Greg in turn looked at me as if I had two heads and let out a sigh at my clear confusion. "I'm muggle born and even I know who is he" he replied and laughed a little before continuing. "He's Harry Potter, he's the most famous wizard ever, well except the one he defeated; You-Know-Who. Harry's amazing really, just incredible..." he stated in a dream like chant. </p><p>This however was overheard by Professor Potter as he stood meters away from where we sat. </p><p>"Yes thank you Mr Lestrade" he said with a dismissive wave of his hand, and made his way back to his desk. </p><p>**</p><p>As the class came to an end, I made my way towards the door with Greg by my side. </p><p>"Mr Holmes a word please if you would." Professor Potter beckoned as I was inches away from crossing the threshold from the classroom. </p><p>Naturally I nodded and stalked my way towards his desk. "Yes sir?" I questioned as I stood before him. </p><p>He towered above me as he proclaimed his height. <br/>"Are you alright?" He asked in a tone that surprised me. It wasn't accusatory yet comforting. </p><p>I sheepishly nodded. "Yes I am quite alright sir" I stated matter of factly. To which he titled his head in obvious denial. </p><p>"I am your Professor, I know that it is your first day but you can come to me if you need guidance or just simply someone to talk to." He said in a manner that was warming, none had shown me this kindness not even my own family. It was strangely comforting to know I now had someone I could confide in. </p><p>"Thank you sir" I stated before he dismissed me in order to allow me to go to my next class which was potions. Also shared with Slytherin...<br/>-<br/>Potions went without disruption or torment from my peers. Greg and I worked in a comfortable silence as the Professor loomed over us in an eligant manner.</p>
