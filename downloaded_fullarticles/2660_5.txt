    <p>A/N: Hello All, my name is Bella Desdemona and this is my fanfic …… anyways my Beta is the wonderful human that I call a best friend. Sadly, we don’t own any part of Harry Potter, otherwise, things would have been different, much different. In case you didn’t for whatever reason read the summary, this fic is strange. It follows the Core Four and the Golden Four, who they are... you shall meet them throughout this multipart fic. Enjoy!!!!!! </p><p>Nyx Artemis Frost was not a morning person, her name even brought to mind the cool fall nights that she loved to experience. However, her best friend was something of the opposite, and one summer’s morning Ashlyn Rose Nightshade was reminded how much of a night person her friend was. </p><p>“NYX THE LETTERS!!!!! YOU’VE GOT TO WAKE UP!!! WE GOT OUR HOGWARTS LETTERS,” Ash screeched, the girl may be my best friend, but even I don’t want to wake up to her screaming in the morning.<br/>
With a roll to the side, I landed on the floor with a resounding THUMP, a groan later and I was sort of awake. “What, my dearest crazy person has possessed you to wake me up at….” My snarl was now directed at the alarm clock as it showed a delightful 6 am in lime green, “6 AM ARE YOU CRAZY.” Now it was my turn to be the morning banshee as my good mood was directed towards Ash. She slowly backed away, as the strands of hair I could see were becoming blood red. “Now, Nyx, there is no need to get angry with me I’m just excited about the letters we got today….” Ash didn’t even get the chance to finish the sentence by the time I was on my feet. “MUM WE HAVE AN ANGRY FLAMING REDHEAD THIS MORNING!!!!” Ash bellowed as she ran down the stairs of my family’s summer home in England.<br/>
As we slid into the kitchen, Ms. Emma just stood there in her nightclothes, a furious look on her face, “Ashlyn Rose Nightshade, what do you have to say for yourself. The one rule that I have about us staying in England with the Frost family is that we don’t get up before 8 am. You know that Nyx isn’t a human before that time!”<br/>
At this point, I had realized that everyone else in the house was woken up by our lovely morning conversations, and the adults in the room had gleeful looks on their faces. “You planned this didn’t you,” Ash and I said together sounding nearly like twins, a shudder ran through our parents, they have always thought it was creepy that we were so in sync. “Of course, we did dear, your mother and I can’t resist you screaming at 6 am,” my father growled into his morning tea an annoyed look on his face as his magic reflected his mood. It was rather rare to see frost on the windows in summer. I sighed and sat at the kitchen table trying to resist adding my own frost to the atmosphere, while also trying to keep a lid on the icy fire brewing under my skin. My breath came out as smoke as my attempts failed, resulting in an annoyed look from the non-elementals in the room, “I know it’s hard to control, but it’s cold enough here in winter and we don’t need the additional frost in the summer,” Ash grumbled annoyed that she was essentially sitting in an icebox. “Sorry,” I mumbled my face heating up as the temperature rose and my hair faded to a soft shade of pink.<br/>
“Why did you decide to get me up at this time anyway?” I asked softly still embarrassed about my abilities getting away from me. “You girls got your letters this morning because you were both born in England you automatically got letters from Hogwarts,” Mum said with a soft smile on her face as she remembered the days before the war at school. “You both also got letters from Ilvermorny, and I know this decision will be difficult, but we would need to know by tomorrow, so we could prepare for whichever you chose,” Ms. Emma said with a hopeful expression on her face, one that I knew what was behind it. Unlike my family, who is in the U.S. due to my dad’s status as an International Auror, Ashlyn had dual citizenship and it would be easier for her to go to either school. That wonderful thought stayed in my mind all through breakfast as the adults tried to take the conversation away from school, but it was rather clear that we didn’t want to think about how nice it would be to go flying today or swimming in the manor’s pool. </p><p> </p><p>ONE MONTH LATER SEPTEMBER 1ST</p><p>“Are you sure about this Ash, your Mum went to school in the states and I think that you would like it there,” I asked softly. “Nixie, we are literally at the station, don’t you think that question is a bit little too late,” Ash replied with a roll of the eyes. “Sorry, I just wanted to make sure, you didn’t know at first you kept changing your mind about where you wanted to go.”</p><p>*******Flashback*********</p><p>It was about 9 pm and I had already made my decision about what school that I was going to, not that I really had to think that much about it. My parents had gone to Hogwarts and so had their families before them, I had no ties to the States besides Ash. None of the other kids wanted to know the girl from the previously war-torn U.K. afraid that she was of the wrong sort. Ash was in a similar boat, however, she had a bit of an easier time in magical primary school. I sighed again, I shouldn’t be thinking about those kids, I scowled as my hair turned an angry red once more. “Ugh,” I groaned as I rolled over in the grass, the stars ever the optimistic part of the night sky. “Really Nyx, that wasn’t dramatic at all,” Ash chuckled as she stood above me, her hazel green eyes hardly noticeable in the night, “Why are you angry, your hair is red again.” She asked as she sat down next to me, I let my hair lighten and grow to a dusky brown, now the two of us really looked like twins. “I was thinking about school, you are not having an easy time with this,” I muttered.  “Nyx, I’ve already made my decision,” Ash whispered with an apprehensive look on her face. “Oh, ok I guess I’ll have to make do with letters. I don’t want to lose you as a friend Ash,” I said sadly. “What are you talking about dork. We are going to school together! Even in different houses, we would see each other. Someone has to keep you from blowing up the dungeons.” Ash said laughing. “I’m just worried that I now have to tell my Mum, she so wanted me to go to her old school!”</p><p>**********Flashback Over**********</p><p>With a deep breath, the two of us were just about to rush towards the faux brick wall in front of us when two blurs of red came out of nowhere. “BOYS WATCH WHERE YOU ARE GOING,” an angry female voice shouted and took off after the two blurs. “Sorry about that, those were my younger brothers, they are going to be first years,” a male voice said above us as Ash and I currently were on the station floor. A tall redhead leaned down and helped the two of us up, “Well I’d better go and keep them from more trouble, good luck you two,” the teen said as he ran towards the barrier.<br/>
With another deep breath, we finally made it past the barrier to where my parents were waiting for us to board the train. After our trunks were loaded, Ash and I made a move to get on to the train only to be stopped. “Oh, no you two! We are getting our goodbyes,” Mum said as she swept the two of us into hugs wiping tears from her eyes when she let us go. As I hugged my Dad I could hardly hear what Mum said to Ash. “I know that your mother had to work today, but I thought that you would like an extra hug, she told me to give you one. It’s not a replacement, but it should do for now.” My Mum then grabbed Ash into a second hug, and the only thing I could see was her dusky brown hair peeking out around my Mum’s arms. </p><p>As we boarded the train, there were students rushing all around us, some in uniform some not. I slowly trailed behind Ash as she searched for an empty compartment. A redhead in glasses passed by us telling off some younger kids for running on the train, a boy with dreadlocks rushed past with a small frog in his hands shoving it into a girl’s face. We finally found an empty compartment and after we sat down I began to think back to when we went shopping for school supplies.</p><p>*******FLASHBACK********</p><p>A few days after we sent the confirmation to Hogwarts my mum woke me up bright and early to go shopping for school supplies. After I was dressed and ready to go, my mum grabbed hold of my arm and I felt the tube-like squeeze of apparition. When we landed in the ally I felt dizzy but also amazed at the sight in front of me. I had seen the magical portions of several American cities, but nothing like Diagon Alley. “Now, your father got the gold that we need for today already, so we can start shopping immediately,” Mum said as we walked towards the bookshop. As my mum went off to one section to grab my potions and herbology books, I ventured into the DADA and transfiguration sections. An hour later my mum found me with my nose in a book. “Let’s go Nyx, we don’t have all day,” she snapped at me. Getting the rest of my supplies went rather quickly until we got to the wand shop. The man was rather creepy with his large owl eyes and wild hair. Wand after wand was placed into my hand, one even blew out the shop windows, but none seemed to work for me. Finally, an 11” blackthorn wand with dragon heartstring was placed in my hands. A blue and green glow surrounded me as I finally found my wand. “Curious,” the wand maker said, “That wand is suited for warriors and just yesterday I sent off its sister pair suited rather well for healing magic. I sense that the two owners of these wands will be able to accomplish many things together, as well as being wonderful friends.” </p><p>********FLASHBACK OVER********<br/>
“Nyx,” I heard a voice pierce through my thoughts, “NYX,” the voice said again. I snapped out of it, my hair turning pink as I blushed realizing that Ash had been attempting to get my attention. “Sorry, I was thinking about this weird thing that the wandmaker in Diagon Alley said to me a bit ago,” I said still embarrassed that she had to grab my attention that way. “Why would you be thinking about that, did he say something odd to you?” she asked. “He did actually, he went on for a bit about how my wand is that of a warrior and the core is a sister pair of a healer’s wand. And then he said something about sisters and friendship between the two. It was weird.” a confused look was on my face as I rambled on. “Well, my wand is that of a healer, but he never said anything about pairs to me, so I don’t know,” Ash replied equally confused.<br/>
As the train ride continued we got sweets from the trolley lady and eventually changed into our robes. “Nyx, are you going to let your abilities show at all?” Ash asked gesturing towards my now blue hair. “Probably, I mean it’s always fun to see people look at me oddly when my hair changes colors in front of them. Plus, you know I have no control over my ice and frost powers yet. I do still sometimes randomly catch on fire.  Are you going to let yours show?” I replied. “What do you want me to do slice my hand and let people watch it heal faster than normal? And by the way, your hair is on fire again.” Ash said laughing. True to her word the ends of my hair were engulfed in icy blue flames, my face burned with embarrassment and that just made the flames worse. An older student with pink hair walked by and opened the compartment door and said, “Are you a Metamorphmagus as well?” “Yes, I can also light things on fire as you can probably see,” I replied back to her. “Sweet, it will be nice to not be the only one in school anymore. See you at school,” the girl said her hair now a bright shade of purple. “That was really odd,” Ash commented softly, “Really, you're telling me that was odd how do you think I feel.” I scoffed.<br/>
Just then there was an announcement over our heads.</p>
