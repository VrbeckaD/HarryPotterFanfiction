    <p>
  <span>Remus was sitting alone, sipping his coffee, when a pair of hands abruptly startled him. He snapped his head around only to find Sirius and his shit-eating grin standing behind the chair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Jesus, Sirius! Don't sneak up on me like that! I almost punched you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good morning to you too, Moony!” Sirius pulled out an empty seat at the table and plopped himself down next to the werewolf. “And </span>
  <em>
    <span>oh boy</span>
  </em>
  <span>, good thing you didn't </span>
  <em>
    <span>punch me</span>
  </em>
  <span>. That would have hurt </span>
  <em>
    <span>so much</span>
  </em>
  <span>…” Sirius’ voice was dripping with sarcasm as he casually crossed his legs on top of the table and swung his arm over the back of his chair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The hell are you doing here this early?” Remus asked, checking his watch and ignoring the snide remark. “You're never awake at this hour on the weekend…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius shrugged, sweeping his hair back from his eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Iunno… thought I'd come and keep you company. Figured you'd already be here. It's </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>, after all…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Where's James?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius was living at James’ family home, and it was unusual for one to leave the house without the other.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Beats me. Probably sleeping? Didn't bother to check…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus raised an eyebrow curiously but didn't press the subject. Sirius was up to something, he could tell, but he hadn't figured out what yet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine, okay… well, thanks for the company… but we're still gonna wait for everyone before we go shopping…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Marauders </span>
  <em>
    <span>(and Lily)</span>
  </em>
  <span> had planned to meet in Diagon Alley at noon to buy their books and supplies for the following school year. According to Remus’ wristwatch, it was half past nine. He had expected to have the morning to himself to sit and enjoy. He loved being in Diagon Alley, watching the wizards pass by, scurrying about their daily lives. Remus would occasionally pretend that he was one of them: a normal wizard leading a normal life, not a care in the world. It was one of the few moments of respite he had in his whirlwind of a summer, and he had been looking forward to the alone time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sounds good to me. Maybe I'll get a coffee, too…” Sirius mused, not paying attention to Remus’ mildly disappointed expression. Remus shrugged and brought his mug to his lips, letting the smell and warmth from his morning drink wash over him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Setting his mug down on the table, Lupin spoke up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know, we're gonna be waiting here a while. The boys won't be here 'til noon…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, what would you normally do until then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus looked at his hands, wrapped around the porcelain cup. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Iunno, just sit here, I guess…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So let's do that…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus eyes Sirius suspiciously. He was acting strange, but Lupin couldn't quite place what was wrong.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why are you here, Sirius?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I told you, I wanted to keep you company.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius was staring off into the distance, not looking at anything in particular. His expression was calm, vacant. He didn't make eye contact with his boyfriend.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Things okay with you and James?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. They're fine…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was being dodgy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sere, what's wrong?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius looked at Remus, deep grey eyes flooding with an emotion that the werewolf couldn't read. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know there's a war, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus gave his boyfriend a look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I'm not dense, Padfoot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then why are you asking what's wrong?” He said it so matter-of-factly, as if it was entirely obvious what was on his mind. As if it was on everyone's mind, all the time. The entire wizarding community, all worrying about the same thing. Remus’ stomach churned as his shoulders tensed. He should have figured it out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I'm sorry…” It was all Remus could manage to say. He didn't have any comforting words to offer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don't be. You have your own shit to worry about, I get it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus looked at his hands, fiddling with the handle on his coffee cup. Of course he didn't notice the tension in the air. Of course he couldn't see how stressed the rest of the wizarding world was. To Remus, everyday was like that. He woke up every morning terrified, knowing that his perfect life could fall apart at any moment. With 'war’ on everyone's lips, hanging ominously in the air over people's heads, the rest of society was catching up to the feelings that Remus had experienced his entire life.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You… doing okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I'll be fine once school starts. I always am.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was strange seeing Sirius this pensive: he normally hid behind his humour, covering up feelings of anxiety with dark jokes and snide comments. Remus realized that his boyfriend was relaxed around him, willing to allow the werewolf to see the real Sirius, behind all of his feeble attempts at hiding his pain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah… September can't come fast enough…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The two boys sat for a while in silence, simply enjoying each other's company. There wasn't much to talk about; no good news to share, no fun stories to tell. The state of the world was getting worse by the second, and they didn't have castle walls to hide behind during the summer months.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, didn't you say you wanted a coffee or something? I can get you one…” Remus tried to fill the void of silence with inane chatter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Remus, I'm joining the Order once we graduate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lupin looked at his boyfriend, trying to absorb what he just heard. To him, the statement came out of nowhere, but he was positive that Sirius must have been mulling it over in his head for some time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay… Is that a no for coffee, then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did you hear me? I said I'm joining the Order…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I heard you. What do you want me to say, that I'm upset at you for risking your life? 'Cause I'm not. I think it's a great idea. I'm joining, too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius looked up and met Remus’ gaze, a look of surprise plastered to his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You are?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course… you don't think they could use a… Well, someone like me? I could come in handy…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius pulled his feet down from the table and leaned towards Remus, gently taking his hand and entwining their fingers together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So… you're not mad?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. Why, do you want me to be?” The corners of Sirius’ mouth began to curl up slightly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I just thought--”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sirius, I love you. But I'm not going to tell you not to do something that you want to do, just because it might be dangerous. Not anymore…” Remus remembered the fight he had with the Marauders when they first suggested becoming animangi. “If it's important to you, it's important to me. I mean, coincidentally this is </span>
  <em>
    <span>also</span>
  </em>
  <span> something important to me, but in general, even if it was something I didn't get, I wouldn't be upset at you for following your instincts…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius’ grip on Remus’ hand tightened.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, Reme. I love you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I know you do. You say it all the damn time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I just don't want you to forget it.” Sirius pressed a kiss against Remus’ cheek, nuzzling him gently. He could feel Remus’ smile broaden against his lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Pads…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let's walk around. I'm tired of sitting…” Remus stood up, pulling his boyfriend gently to his feet. “Why don't we check out the Magical Menagerie… you need a new owl, right?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius grinned and swung his arm around Remus’ shoulders. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sounds like a plan…”</span>
