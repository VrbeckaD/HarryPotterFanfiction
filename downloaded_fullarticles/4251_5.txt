    <p>She could still remember when he asked her to prom back in January. She was in the common room with Ginny, Harry and Ron and Neville came in and told her that Draco was outside waiting for her. When she went outside to bring him inside he wasn’t there, it was completely empty outside the common room which is weird because normally it’s surrounded by students. She noticed a rose petal on the floor and as she picked it up another appeared leading her out of the corridor, she followed the trail all the way into an empty classroom and Draco was sat on the desk holding a bouquet of roses with a smug little smirk on his face. </p><p>“You found me then granger” </p><p>“What’s with the roses?” </p><p>“I needed to get your attention” Draco says as he walks towards Hermione until they are face to face and he hands her the roses.</p><p>“You’ve got it, now why?” </p><p>“I want to ask you to prom”</p><p>“Ask me then” Hermione smirks at him.</p><p>“Granger, will you let me take you to prom?” </p><p>“You know that would mean having to dance with me in front of all of your Slytherin friends and Harry and Ron and not to mention how Pansy will react” Hermione sighs.</p><p>“I don’t care about any of that, I want to take my girlfriend to prom because I couldn’t dance with her at the Yule ball two years ago” Draco tucks a lose strand of Hermione’s hair behind her ear. </p><p>“What about what people will think?” Hermione whispers while staring directly into his eyes, his intensity causes her to bite her bottom lip.</p><p>“Your stupid little body guards already know about us and all the losers in my house who will have an opinion on us can shove it” Draco leans into to kiss her.</p><p>Hermione pulls away last second and asks “what about Pansy? She’ll kill me for stealing away her little Drakykins” </p><p>“Fuck Pansy” Draco smirks and goes to kiss her again but Hermione moves around him to lean on the desk.</p><p>“I’m sure she’d love for you to fuck her” Hermione says she’s she hoists herself up to sit on the desk and slowly crosses her legs while maintaining eye contact with Draco. </p><p>Draco moves to stand in between her legs and softly pushes them apart with his large hands before resting one of her inner thigh “only person I want to fuck is sat right in front of me” </p><p>Hermione pretends to look around the room before saying “but there’s only me here” before faking a gasp and exclaiming “Draco Malfoy, you can’t possibly mean that!” With a giggle. </p><p>During her little acting skit Draco had brought his hand up much higher and hand moved her panties to the side to gain access to her vagina. </p><p>“Just shut up granger and let me fuck you” </p><p>And with that he pulled off her panties and throw them to the ground, Hermione made quick work to remove her school jumper and shirt before starting on Draco’s shirt as he slid her skirt off. </p><p>Draco started to kiss at her neck in a soft and yet needy way and when Hermione eventually grew tired of waiting she trust his trousers and boxers off in one getting a laugh from Draco as he looked up at her and undid her bra. </p><p>Draco took a second to stare at her chest as he did every time he saw her with no bra, Hermione roller her eyes and grabbed at his neck to bite down on his shoulder, Draco snapped out of his trance and snaked his hand back to the outer walls of her vagina. Hermione gives an excited squeal as he rubs his finger over her clit. She continues to kiss his neck as he pushes a finger inside of her. Her body gives an involuntary shudder as he hits her sweet spot and he adds another finger. She cries out his name and takes this as encouragement to pull his fingers out and flip her over the desk before eagerly thrusting into her with his cock. </p><p>They were loud, louder than they should’ve be given their location so it was only a matter of time before then inevitably happened and they were caught. It could have been worse, Mcgonagall or Snape could have walked in but it was only a very surprised Professor Sprout carrying a large plant pot of some foreign herb for curing migraines. When she caught sight of them she dropped the pot out of surprise and Hermione rushed to grab something to cover herself up with. Draco stood there in shock as Hermione frantically throw on his shirt and gathered up the rest of their clothes. Draco finally pulled on his trousers and they quickly left the room with Draco promising to buy Professor Sprout a whole new set of plant pots in exchange for her silence over what she had seen, she had of course refused the bribe but did keep this encounter to herself more out of sheer awkwardness than anything else. </p><p>Draco and Hermione walked in silence out of the classroom and ran directly into a large crowd of fifth years that happened to include Ginny, Luna and Cho who all stared at the half dressed teens in shock. </p><p>Hermione couldn’t think of anything intelligent to say so settled for asking Ginny “please don’t tell your brother or harry, they don’t need to know this”</p><p>Ginny nodded in agreement knowing that Harry and Ron already disliked the idea of Draco and Hermione dating or whatever it is they were doing but the idea that the Prince of Slytherin and famed sex god had defiled their precious little Hermione in a classroom no less would probably lead to Draco’s death.</p>
