    <p>Sirius had managed to cover up the smattering of pimples on his forehead quite well, Remus observed. Clearly his friend had been practicing his charm work; if it wasn’t for the way that he continually reached self-consciously for his face, Remus would have never suspected he was breaking out.</p><p>He wanted to reach across the Potter’s kitchen table that morning and squeeze Sirius’ hand, but he didn’t dare call attention to the ticks that tended to pop up around mid-august. Remus knew that they were nearing the annual anniversary of the Bad Thing, and that Sirius had a hard time controlling his anxiety.</p><p>Remus didn’t want to think about the Bad Thing at all. In fact, he had found that over the last two years it was still such an incomprehensible event to think about. It was just a placeholder of darkness in his mind, surrounded by chaos– Sirius with his arms wrapped around his knees and shivering despite the heat; McGonagall saying words like ‘catatonia’ and ‘disassociation’; Sirius locked in the dorm bathroom and James crying and begging him to come out; and the worst of all, Sirius laying unconscious in a hospital bed with several blooming bruises peaking out from his Hogwarts robes.</p><p>These memories swirled around the Bad Thing, but naming it itself seemed impossible. It made Remus feel both confused and terrified. Especially, when Remus had to think about It happening to his best friend. Sirius was sitting across from him now, looking mostly mischievous and a little darkly mysterious with his legs stretched out on an empty chair. He was wearing the new tight jeans he written to Remus about when he bought them in muggle London, and the big sweater he had stolen straight out of Remus’ trunk just before they left Hogwarts for summer break.<br/> “My house is always so drafty Moons” Sirius had said with a playful smirk as he put in on the top of the pile of his own things, “You wouldn’t want me to catch my death in Grimmauld Place, would you?”<br/> He had even winked.</p><p>“Moony, stop grinning to yourself and tell us what we should do today” barked James, breaking Remus out of his own head “we’re at a stalemate here!”</p><p> </p><p>Remus tried not to feel guilty for smiling while he reminisced about a terrible moment in a close friends life.</p><p>The marauders were spending the second last week of their summer holidays at the Potter’s cottage and so far the first two days had been spent not doing much of anything. Not that James would agree; Remus was fairly certain James would say that a series abandoned pranks and afternoons spent smoking skunky muggle weed in the woods around Godrick’s Hollow was peak summer fun.</p><p>It wasn’t that Remus didn’t enjoy lazy days with his friend (even if it involved coughing until his eyes watered far too much for it to be considered healthy), it was just that he had only seen Sirius smile a handful of times. In fact, for the one boy who usually led the charge on bad ideas, Sirius seemed to be following the rest of them around in a daze. Remus worried that the mood-altering substances might not be improving the situation.</p><p>“Ok, hit me with your plans” he said, shaking the anxieties away for the time being.</p><p>James had suggested a, frankly, bonkers plan that involved robbing both a grocer’s for muggle liquor (he insisted this was a prank and not a punishable offense) and also luring the neighbour’s tabby into a Rube-Goldberg style trap.</p><p>“Prongs that’s all illegal” Remus’ reminded, feigning exasperation.</p><p>“I know you love them James, but have you ever actually made a functional… err well… not functional exactly, but you know what I mean” Peter laughed, attempting to mime the last Rube-Goldberg machine James had insisted would definitely work.</p><p>“We are not abusing the cat, even if it does look like Mrs. Norris!” said Sirius loudly, which seemed to end the discussion in its tracks.</p><p>Remus tried not to look too obviously in admiration at Sirius. As much as he refused to admit it to his friends, Sirius has a soft spot for house pets that dated back to before his animagus took the form of a large, shaggy dog.</p><p>Peter thought that they should run with the muggle alcohol idea, but he suggested a milder form of shoplifting, rather than the aforementioned robbery at wand-point.</p><p>Sirius groaned loudly and gestured to the window “I’d like to go swimming today, it’s beautiful out.”</p><p>Peter countered the suggestion with a proposition to both swim and get ‘falling-down’ at the same time.</p><p>Everyone exchanged excited glances and nodded in agreement.</p><p>“We’re buying the liquor though” Remus added before the plan could be firmly finalized.</p><p>And so it was decided.</p><p>***<br/> Remus had followed Sirius up the stairs to the bedroom the Potter’s had set aside for him over four years ago. James demanded that they meet back in his kitchen in ten minutes to official begin the day’s adventure.<br/> Remus had been set up on a camp bed besides the large fluffy mattress that he assumed Mrs. Potter had bought specifically for Sirius. Someone (again - Remus suspected Mrs. Potter) had hung a large Gryffindor flag on the wall that matched the gold and scarlet-striped bed spread. Remus knew that while Sirius’s own décor taste tended to drift towards centrefolds and hot rods (preferably together), he found the bedroom comforting. As soon as could, Sirius installed himself on the edge of the bed and ran his fingers over the quilt dreamily.</p><p>“Whacha thinking about?” Remus asked softly, knowing that Sirius would never be able say it out loud.<br/> Remus sat down on the bed next to Sirius and gently placed his hand over his friends. Remus didn’t know when this started – this quiet touching. At least since the spring they had been giving each other small reassurances, before the full moon he often found Sirius finger tips on his under the dinner table, or a toe against his ankle in the common room. Remus had been worried that over the summer holiday Sirius might have grown okay with a healthy physical distance. But when he had seen him for the first time that summer, Sirius had quietly stroked the inside of Remus’ wrist while James told them about his brilliant plans to utterly destroy Godrick’s Hollow.</p><p>Remus tried not to think about why they did this. He supposed they were both a bit lonely – a bit starved for touch, for another person’s warmth. Maybe everyone was when they were sixteen though, did most of them silently hold their best mates hand and never speak that reality out loud?<br/> Are you actually alright? Remus desperately wanted to ask, but hoped the way he massaged the knuckles of Sirius’s ring finger was enough.</p><p>“I’m going to be alright Moony” whispered Sirius, unfailingly knowing what Remus was thinking, “I’m just tired right now.”</p><p>The tightness in the depth of Sirius’ throat made Remus feel like he was cracking. At that moment he wanted to wrap Sirius up in a hug, maybe bury him in the Gryffindor quilt until he was sure his friend could never feel a bad emotion again.</p><p>But instead he let Sirius flop down onto his back, stretching out across the bed spread without letting go of Remus’s hand.</p><p>“Have you been having trouble sleeping? Nightmares?” he had promised himself that he wouldn’t fuss or pry too heavily into Padfoot’s mental state – but he couldn’t help asking a follow-up question.</p><p>Predictably Sirius rolled his eyes to tell Remus he was fine, but shot him a tight lipped grin as a reassurance.</p><p>“Getting absolutely fucked today will surely help” he joked.<br/> Remus bit his tongue, knowing that Sirius didn’t need to be mothered anymore now that he had Mrs. Potter around.<br/> “Com’ere Pads” he said getting off the bed to rummage in his suitcase “Let’s cure up those break outs”</p><p>Sirius rolled his eyes and snorted again, “Nothing gets past you, does it Moony?”</p><p>He had swung himself back on to the edge of the bed, and had tilted his face upwards in anticipation.</p><p>Remus tried to casually place himself with his knees against Sirius’. It felt stupid as soon as he did it, but he didn’t want to move lest Sirius realize how awkward the whole situation was. He brushed Sirius’ hair out of his eyes. Somehow, Sirius had managed to avoid the scissors despite being home for a whole month and a half with Walburga Black. At this point his hair hung silky and dark down to his shoulders. Remus wanted to run his hand through it, but it felt like it would be too far, much further than any other way he had touched Sirius.<br/> Quietly, Remus whispered the incantation to remove the glamour charm that Sirius had cast.<br/> “You know they just get worse when you cover them up with those charms Pads, you’ve got to treat them and let them breath” he took a look at the angry red bumps across Sirius forehead, it was obvious that he had been picking at them. Tiny scabs littered his forehead along with the pimples themselves.</p><p>Remus traced his finger down the side of Sirius’s face, following the smattering of acne on Sirius’ cheekbone. He didn’t want to embarrass Sirius by telling him how bad it was. And anyway, it was due to stress and all the picking, he knew it would clear up in no time.<br/> Remus dabbed some of Mrs. Greybourne’s Pimple Solution on to his finger and tapped gently at the spots on Sirius’s face. They dried up immediately, leaving behind a barely-there bump and a bit of dry skin, which would be gone before the hour.<br/> “I’m always so embarrassed to buy this stuff, Moony, I’m glad you keep some around.” Sirius sighed, with the eyelashes fluttering gently whenever Remus touched his face with the ointment.<br/> Remus wanted to say that he was also embarrassed to buy acne creams, his mother just always packed enough in his trunk for the school year. Somehow that felt insensitive, knowing that Sirius’s mother had probably never thought to get a term’s supply of anything for him (except maybe Howlers).</p><p>Remus was still patting away at Sirius’s face when James walked in. Remus froze, he felt so exposed with Sirius’ chin cupped in his hand, not to mention that Sirius’ knee had drifted between Remus’s own legs.</p><p>James, however, didn’t seem to see anything strange with his friends’ closeness. He seemed completely oblivious to it, insisting loudly that Remus patch him up as well.</p><p>Was this even that strange?<br/> Maybe the reason this touching thing always felt funny was because Remus was the one making it funny?<br/> Maybe Remus just didn’t know how to read signals?<br/> Maybe he so desperately clung to the idea that he was special to Sirius to avoid the fact that he was really just destined for loneliness?<br/> Maybe what felt like a secret intimacy was just the mundane mark of friendship, and Remus’ ego was getting the better of him. Who was he to assume that Sirius liked him especially?</p><p>While Remus leaned over James’ face to apply the ointment to Prongs own smattering of pimples, Peter rushed in abruptly.</p><p>He jumped on Sirius, tackling him to the ground. Both laughed hysterically as Peter got Sirius in a head lock.</p><p>“Help!” shrieked Sirius “I’m drowning in stomach rolls”</p><p>Peter immediately body slammed Sirius and wiggled his belly exaggeratedly across Padfoot’s own scrawny chest. They were both laughing like madmen. Remus remembered sadly that was just how it was with friends. You could tease each other, even about your greatest insecurities, and still laugh. It was like how James had begun calling Remus’s lycanthropy a ‘furry little problem’. You loved each other, and therefore had license to poke and prod at the wounds of everyday life. It was the greatest part of friendship, and Remus was misreading it entirely when he thought he saw Sirius relax significantly when Remus came into the room.<br/> He thought of James stroking Sirius’s hair through a crack in bathroom door last year. Trying not to sob as he begged Sirius to come out. This was the way they were; this was how it was when you had best friends. You just took care of each other.</p><p>“C’mon lads” James roared, “Let’s go swimming!”</p>
