<p>The thing about <em>seeing</em>, thought Sophia, was that it was essentially a paradox. You saw things that were meant to be and because you saw them, they were. You could change them, but only to a certain degree. Like right now for instance.</p>
<p>For three years she knew there was a vampire stalking and turning gifted humans, and that he had been watching her and her friend Melissa for six months, and that he would take them and they would be turned. The only way to make such a terrible situation end in a somewhat positive fashion would be to prepare for the turning, and the aftermath. Mental training would be required to control the bloodlust that came once fully turned and also to keep their wits about them, so that they could kill their would-be captor and the other vampires that were present.</p>
<p>Lying curled on her side on the bed Sophia stared at her captor as he gently sat down beside her and stroked an icy hand down her cheek.</p>
<p>While human Melissa was admittedly powerful enough to take on more than one vampire at a time but Sophia was still human, still had human weaknesses and human needs that would slow her down. If they were to remain free they needed the boost her power would get from the turning. First, Sophia had to change. The potential damage she could bring down on the human population could only be avoided if she were turned in a safe, extremely isolated place, away from human populated areas. It’s why she had to be changed instead of Melissa, at least until the time was right.</p>
<p>“Beautiful one,” whispered her maker tenderly, and lifted her wrist to his smiling mouth.  </p>
<p>Sophia turned her gaze back to the ceiling as he bit into her wrist and a soul searing pain began to surge down her arm and into the rest of her. She needed to be kept in isolation so they could have even a chance of controlling her should the future she saw now change, and the only one capable of doing that right now was Melissa.  </p>
<p>She gasped and convulsed. One more time, she reminded herself. Check one more time. Panting harshly, she gathered all her energy and flung her mind forward to lose herself in grasping for what was to happen in the days to come.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>The thing about being friends with someone who was precognitive was that it was both incredibly convenient and at times very frustrating. It took all the excitement out of things sometimes. Although knowing that you’d be getting an offer for a scholarship to the very popular dance school you wanted to get into since you were 12 was nothing compared to the apparent fact that the supernatural existed and a vampire would track you down and turn your best friend into one. So that’s the trouble.</p>
<p>Melissa was slung over her kidnapper’s shoulder as if she weighed less than a feather. Her ribs ground painfully against the vampire’s stone shoulder as he clamped his ice-cold arm across the backs of her thighs. She opened her eyes. Swift glances to the sides revealed only one other vampire to their left accompanying them.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes again and formed a delicate shield around herself, and slowly ballooned it outward. As it expanded, brushing over everything she put together an impression of her surroundings. It was a fairly small, run down house with about four and a half rooms. There was one more vampire in the house along with a living person.</p>
<p>The vampire carried Melissa up the stairs and into the house, their companion turned left into the room with the human as the one carrying Melissa continued into the next room. He dropped her unceremoniously on the bed in a corner. A wave of musty sheets and a small cloud of dust flew up her nose.</p>
<p>She immediately stopped pretending to be unconscious and began sneezing violently. The vampire, a short brown haired boy with ruby red eyes sneered and stalked toward her. He leaned down and grabbed her by the collar, pulling her up and raising an open hand, presumably to knock her out. She reached out and seized his arms and legs, immobilizing them. Shock flooded his face as he struggled to move. He opened his mouth to shout and she lunged to her feet and placed one foot on his shoulder, wrapped her power around his head and pulled.</p>
<p>The vampire’s head separated from his neck and shoulders with an ugly screeching sound. The body fell to the floor, leaving his head suspended in the air, face frozen in shock and fury. A slight rustle alerted Melissa to the arrival of the two other vampires, standing just inside the doorway. She rocketed the head at the face of the one to her left and wrenched the other towards her. She stretched a hand out and caught the vampire, absorbing the kinetic force of the impact and amplifying it, then redirected it into a blow that severed its head. As the remaining vampire stared from her to the two bodies Melissa strengthened the reconnaissance shield around the house, blocking all exits. The vampire disappeared from sight.</p>
<p>The barrier rippled in the room with the human in it. Melissa stepped down off the bed and walked over the bodies, sweeping the heads to one side. The barrier rippled again, more violently this time and then once more. Melissa swiftly shrank it down to cover only that one room and hurried into it. Immediately as she stepped into the room the vampire darted over to the bed. Melissa glanced at the person and relaxed as she laid eyes on a face as familiar as her own. Sophia was here as she had said she would be, unconscious and with the transformation already underway.</p>
<p>The vampire made a movement towards Sophia, an attempt to grab her throat. Melissa tightened the shield around his whole body and then wrenched it apart. The vampire came with it. In pieces. She shifted the head away from the body and knelt by Sophia’s side.</p>
<p>Placing a hand on her forehead Melissa released the sensory shield again, sending it cascading down her friend’s body. Sophia’s heart was laboring to pump blood through the partially ossified vessels. Under her deep brown skin was a grayish color. Melissa unbuttoned her jacket and laid it over Sophia.</p>
<p>Melissa got to her feet. The leader of this coven, as the vampires referred to their groups, wasn’t here yet. That wasn’t very worrying. She could deal with him easily enough once he returned. Sophia’s information had him down as a creepy pedophile with the face of an angel. He posed no threat, since his manipulative skill would not affect Melissa.</p>
<p>She reached out and lifted the severed head and body. They hovered in the air, trailing behind her as she went into the other room to retrieve the rest of the corpses. She sorted the heads to one side and the bodies to another and then proceeded to the kitchen. Setting the heads down for a moment, Melissa carefully grasped each of the bodies in several different places and twisted sharply.</p>
<p>The bodies fragmented with a deafening grinding snap. Fluid, alternately clear and dark, along with small amounts of dark blood began to seep from the pieces and pooled in the spaces between them. In the middle of searching the drawers for matches Melissa paused and stared at the whole mess. The parts appeared to be moving, as if attempting to pull themselves back together.</p>
<p>Yanking open the drawer next to the stove she finally discovered a butane lighter. She picked it out and pulled the mass of parts closer, peering at them. The clear fluid appeared to be, for lack of a better word, circulating, or at least attempting to, between the parts. It also seemed as though the fluid knew which parts belonged together, and tried to rejoin them.</p>
<p>Was it alive? She wondered. It sure seemed like it. Not certain what to make of that conclusion she examined one of the pieces. The cross section of skin was opaque and looked like a stone broken apart, under that the muscles were bone white and glistening. The bones themselves looked thicker than they would normally be and it was the marrow which was oozing the dark fluid that mixed with the clear one.</p>
<p>Melissa stared uncertainly at the parts for a minute longer and then picked up the severed heads. Casting another shield she checked the backyard area for anyone who might be there. When she found no one, she opened the door and stepped outside. In the middle of the yard stood a vampire dressed in a clean button down grey shirt and blue jeans. He tilted his head, strands of reddish hair falling over his forehead. He smiled warmly at her, then gazed past at the broken parts floating behind her.</p>
<p>His face froze and then contorted in rage. Melissa formed a shield around him, caging him in seconds before he disappeared. He slammed up against the barrier and bounced off. Repeatedly he attacked the shield, trying to find an opening. Eventually he stopped and stood silently in the middle, staring murderously at Melissa.</p>
<p>She walked slowly down the stairs and skirted the cage, going over to a corner of the yard and depositing the corpse fragments in a pile. She ignited the lighter then knelt and touched the flame to the heap, and then stepped back as the fire spread instantly.</p>
<p>Another thump echoed as the coven leader slammed against the barrier.</p>
<p>“You killed all my children by yourself?” he asked.</p>
<p>Melissa sighed but didn’t turn to face him. “Yeah, I did. Honestly, it wasn’t easy talking myself into doing it either. I mean, they were kids! Kids younger than Sophia. The oldest must have been about, what, sixteen?” Finally she turned around. The vampire was pressed right up to the barrier, red eyes fixed unblinking on her.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what kind of sicko you were,” she huffed a miserable laugh. “Still are apparently, but those were children. And they didn’t deserve to die like they just did. So you’re gonna tell me why you turned them or I’m gonna make you feel pain like you haven’t felt since the day you were bitten.”</p>
<p>He shook his head and laughed. “That’s what you want to know? Why I turned them?”</p>
<p>Melissa waited patiently. He smiled at her and laughed again. “Why don’t you stay with me and find out?”</p>
<p>She snapped the shield down to encase him, holding him still and unmoving.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you just tell me instead?” She began a steady pull on his limbs, stretching them slowly in different directions. The fire was slowly growing cooler at her back. Gradually, a thin screech came from him as his body started to fragment.</p>
<p>“Those kids loved me.” He hissed at her. She stopped pulling him apart and nodded for him to continue.</p>
<p>“I was the one light in their lives. Do you know who they were before? Orphans. Unloved and unwanted, and then I came along. I found them, I cared for them and I brought them together and made a family of them. The two that came for you? They just got out of the newest foster home. The only reason they didn’t get beat to shit was because of me. Their new “parents” had a bad habit of kidnapping kids and doing the unspeakable to them. I saved them from that.”</p>
<p>“If you saved them from whatever shit was happening to them then why’d you come after me and Sophia? There was nothing happening to us and we’re both a little above your usual age range. So what was it about us, then, that made you come?”</p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows. “I thought you could be better, I could have given you a great gift. People like you, humans with powers; you get so much stronger when you turn. I wanted to help you be stronger, help you reach heights you never could before.”</p>
<p>“Really?” She smiled grimly, and then resumed pulling him apart. “Try again, pal.”</p>
<p>He grimaced and screamed as his limbs started to splinter. “Alright! Alright, stop!”</p>
<p>Melissa relaxed her hold and rocked back on her heels, the vampire hung in her grasp, eyes closed.</p>
<p>“Ready to talk?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you ask your little friend in there when she wakes up? I’m sure she’ll be more than happy to tell you –after she drains you dry,” he laughed hysterically.</p>
<p>“You’re not going to talk are you?”</p>
<p>Melissa chuckled. “Well, let me enlighten you about her.” She strolled up to the vampire. “You see, we knew you were coming.” He froze and Melissa nodded in acknowledgement.</p>
<p>“We’ve known for a very long time now. We know who those kids really are, and we know that you didn’t turn them to make them something great and beautiful or whatever bullshit you want them, and me, to believe. They were gifted like us, and you decided to turn them and train them and make your own personal honor guard, brainwash them with that silver tongue of yours. But you got greedy and decided to come for us too, and we ruined your little plan, killed your army and now it’s your turn.”</p>
<p>She leaned in closer, face to face. “She told me, down to the hour, how to fight you. How to kill you and that’s exactly what I’m gonna do but this? I just needed to know because this is something bigger than we’ve ever faced, and I needed to know that she was right, and that I was right to follow her orders to kill those kids, and you. Now I have confirmation.”</p>
<p>She stepped back towards the dying fire.</p>
<p>“This is where you die.” Melissa flicked her fingers and the vampire snapped apart and splintered into pieces that she threw onto the flames.</p>
