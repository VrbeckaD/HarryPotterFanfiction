A spell later, and the two were against the back wall, with bloody faces. </p><p>Draco lifted his head, "What if I had told your mother, that her son was a cruel motherfucker?" He wiped his nose against the back of his robe, but it still dripped. "It's not just me, it's everybody who thinks that you're fucking ugly, when you come and hurt us, just so you can get your fill."</p><p>"Forced to follow the leader, who's being possessed by demons." Pansy joined in, pushing her hair out if her face to reveal blood dropped from her lips, "I've tried to make you listen, but you won't, it's your way, right? Killing kids all day and night, dark nights and bloody fights, shooting at the angel while claiming you're the right guy."</p><p>Draco pushed himself up, holding out his hand for Pansy, "All you want is power and love, fuck our dreams and that's not right. "You're the principal."</p><p>"The principal?" The man, who was outwardly enraged, had a ghostly calm voice. </p><p>"Where's the principal, oh?" Pansy replied, and Draco repeated. </p><p>"Complicated, overrated. You're fixated and elated, by the separation in this place you've created, fuck all of your rules and guidelines, you shouldn't even be in the sidelines!" Draco hissed, limping forwards. </p><p>"Can't you see that we're all hurtin? If you're not teachin, we're not learnin! Excuse me, how much are you gettin?" Pansy words were slightly slurred, and she slumped against the table. "I've tried to make you listen, but you won't, it's your way, right?"</p><p>"Killing kids all day and night, dark nights and bloody fights, shooting at the angels while claiming you're the right guy," Draco slumped back into his chair, "All you want is love and power, fuck our dreams and that's not right. You're the principal."</p><p>"Where's the principal, oh? Where's the principal?"</p><p>"You don't don't know the pain you are causing, yeah, your actions hurt, so do your words. The more you try to fuck us over,Â  we will be yelling at your front door." Draco sneered, but he was getting paler. </p><p>"I tried to make you listen, but you won't, it's your way, right?" Both students slumped, passed out. </p><p>Voldemort flung their bodies at a back wall, "If any of you talk to me like that, I will kill you. These two need some time in the dungeons."</p></div>
