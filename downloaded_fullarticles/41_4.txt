    <p>When we left the <em>Princess Isabella </em>for a last time in Southampton on the first of May, the Davis family stood behind the barrier in the hall of the cruise terminal, waving at us with big smiles on their faces. Matt jumped up and down behind the barrier, and Melissa seemed to have her hands full to hold him back.</p><p>Daphne had not yet seen her relatives. She had a hard time leaving the ship that had witnessed momentous changes in our lives, and turned back ever so often to have a last look. Our good byes to Alvirah and Willy also had been tearful, but we had promised to stay in touch and let hear of us as soon as we had settled down in our new life as a married couple.</p><p>Little did my wife know that I had already booked a cruise around Europe in "our" suite for August of next year. With a little luck it would be our honeymoon, if we managed to rebuild Grenian House in time to exchange our magical vows there. Smiling to myself, I touched Daphne's arm. 'Look who's waiting for us.'</p><p>She turned around. Her eyes searched the crowd of people assembled in the hall of the cruise terminal, who apparently were all waiting to either pick up relatives who went from board today, or who were about to enter the <em>Princess Isabella</em> for the upcoming trip to New York. Finally, she discovered the Davis'. A broad smile appeared on her face, and she raised her arm to wave back. Then she turned her head and smirked at me. 'I told you that Theo would be waiting for me in Southampton to finalise the details.'</p><p>I took another look at the Davis family. She was right: beside Davis stood a tall, young man with brown hair and light skin, his arm wrapped around Davis' waist. I wouldn't have recognised him. Nott had always been a pale and weedy child, and a bit on the small side, just like me. Apparently, he was a late bloomer and had changed a lot during the last year. He had grown quite a bit and lost his sick looks.</p><p>'I bow to your suprior knowledge of your housemate, love,' I told her while we walked to the band to pick up our luggage. 'I, for my turn, can't wait to see Melissa's face when we tell her that we're already married.'</p><p>Daphne linked arms with me as we waited for our luggage to appear. 'Yes, that'll be interesting,' she replied with an unholy grin around her lips. I couldn't blame her; Melissa had been a huge annoyance ever since we left San Francisco, and derserved everything that was coming in my book.</p><p>We picked up our luggage and left the enclosed area. Matt ran toward us, Davis and Nott followed. I noticed they were holding hands. Behind them, in a more sedate pace, walked Melissa and Matthew.</p><p>Matt threw himself into Daphne's arms. 'Daphne! I've missed you so!'</p><p>She caught him and whirled him around. 'I also missed you, you little rascal!'</p><p>He screamed with delight, but of course protested that assault on his budding male dignity. Daphne laughed and let go of him, but not without tousling his hair. He backed off, still laughing, and turned around to greet me. I gave him a high five, which seemed to please him immensely as he returned the gesture.</p><p>'So, you're still hanging around with my cousin, Harry?' he grinned.</p><p>'Yeah; and I plan on doing so for quite a long time,' I replied, while I wrapped my arm around Daphne's waist, and kissed her on the cheek.</p><p>Matt made a face. 'That's gross! I'm never going to ask a girl to marry me when I have to do that kissing stuff!'</p><p>Meanwhile, Davis and Nott had reached us. They had heard Matt's last words and joined our laughter.</p><p>'I daresay you'll like it one day,' Nott grinned.</p><p>'Never!' Matt swore, which had us laughing again.</p><p>'Bugger off, munchkin!' Davis told her little brother. It sounded affectionately. Matthew obeyed, though he poked his tongue out at his sister.</p><p>Davis stepped to Daphne and hugged her. 'Welcome back home, Daphne, and my heartfelt congratulations.' The embrace she gave Daphne looked much warmer than the stiff hug the girls had exchanged back in San Francisco, when they met for the first time after the Davis' had fled from England.</p><p>'Thank you, Tracey!' Daphne beamed.</p><p>Of course Davis' first question was to see the engagement ring, and Daphne held out her hand, beaming with pride and joy. While Tracey exclaimed over Daphne's engagement ring – we both had put a Concealment Charm on our wedding bands as a surprise for Melissa – Nott turned to me and offered me his hand. 'My congratulations, Potter. Now I finally believe everything they say about you. It takes a very courageous man to conquer the Ice Queen of Slytherin.' It was the first time I saw a genuine smile on his face when he talked to me, instead of the sneer he used to give me when he was Malfoy's sidekick at Hogwarts.</p><p>Of course I had heard about Daphne's reputation during our school days. I had even witnessed a very embarrassed Seamus Finnegan hobbling to the infirmary in our fifth year, after an encounter with my future wife. He never told us what she had done to him, but since he had been a right git to me back then, I didn't care, and had even thought of congratulating Daphne for teaching Gryffindor's self-styled Casanova a lesson that day. I made a mental note to myself to ask her what she had done to him. It would probably be good to know what I had better to avoid, if I ever got on her bad side.</p><p>'You know, I never could resist a challenge,' I deadpanned, and shook Nott's hand. 'Daphne told me congratulations are in order, too?'</p><p>His eyes flicked to Davis, and his expression became soft as he watched his fiancé. She held her left hand out to Daphne, who was admiring the emerald ring she wore.</p><p>'Yes, thank you,' he replied. He seemed to be about to say more, but by now Melissa and Matthew had caught up with us, and showered Daphne with a new round of hugs and congratulations.</p><p>Davis turned to me and offered me her hand. 'Welcome to the family, Harry. I'm so happy for Daphne and you. I don't think I've ever seen Daphne that happy. She surely deserves happiness after the losses she has suffered.'</p><p>I took her hand and kissed her knuckles, as Daphne had taught me. 'Thank you, Davis. I agree with you, and I'll do everything to keep Daphne happy. May I also offer my congratulations to your upcoming nuptials?'</p><p>She gave me a smile full of sunshine in return. 'Thank you, Harry. But please, call me Tracey. After all, we're family now.'</p><p>There was no time to answer to that, because Melissa drew me into a bear hug while I still marvelled about the changes in Davis – no, Tracey.</p><p>'Harry! I'm so happy for you and Daphne,' she beamed when she finally released me. 'I'd hoped for this to happen ever since I met you in San Francisco, and saw the way you took care of my little cousin.'</p><p>I raised my eyebrows at that. 'The contracts you sent to Daphne suggested otherwise, Melissa.' As much as I tried, I couldn't keep the irritation I still felt because of her meddling out of my voice.</p><p>She had the grace to blush. 'Well, I know how stubborn Daphne is, and wanted to give her a nudge in the right direction,' she admitted.</p><p>'You chose a rather odd way for that,' I told her, shaking my head. 'Did it never occur to you that your meddling would have quite the opposite effect on Daphne, just because she can be a trifle stubborn sometimes? She forbade me to propose for I don't know how many weeks, because she didn't want it to look as if she accepted out of pressure.'</p><p>'Oh!' Melissa's mouth went round, and she opened her eyes wide. Then she gave me a regretful look. 'Sorry, Harry. That never occurred to me.'</p><p>'I told you that pressuring Daphne was the wrong way, darling,' her husband told her, and put an arm around her shoulders. He offered me his hand. 'My congratulations, Harry. I'm happy for both of you, and relieved you followed my advice.'</p><p>'Thank you, Matthew,' I replied, shaking his hand. 'Though your advice wasn't necessary. I had already collected Daphne's first rejection when I received your letter.'</p><p>He looked as contrite as his wife at my words, I noticed with no small degree of satisfaction.</p><p>Matt saved the awkward moment. 'Can we go back home? I'm hungry!'</p><p>Melissa sighed, and tousled his hair. 'And what's new about that, mister? I swear, the first time I saw you, fresh out of my womb, you were screaming that I should feed you, and that hasn't changed over the years.'</p><p>Everyone laughed about that, much to Matt's embarrassment. We loaded our luggage onto a trolley, and went out to the parking lot in front of the building. The spring day was overcast, but thankfully it didn't rain at the moment, though puddles of water and the wet pavement in front of the building indicated that it had rained not so long ago.</p><p>Matthew and Melissa walked ahead, with Matt, Tracey, Nott, Daphne and I following them in some distance.</p><p>'Ugh, did I tell you that I hate the British climate?' Daphne said, with a disgruntled look at the grey sky, and huddled against me.</p><p>I laughed, and put my arm around her to give her more shelter from the unpleasant wind. 'Yeah, you're a typical snake in that regard. Happy and active in the warm sunshine, but grumpy at the sight of the first drop of rain, and downright unbearable as soon as the temperature drops below twenty degrees.'</p><p>Matt, Tracey and Nott laughed about that, while my wife elbowed me in the side for my cheek.</p><p>'You should've seen her in the Slytherin dorms during winter, Harry,' Tracey said. 'She always wore several layers of clothes under her robes, and looked like a walking scarecrow.'</p><p>'Impossible,' I said, and smiled down at Daphne. 'Though, I can't blame her. If the dorms are anything like the Slytherin common room, they must be a rather cold and unwelcoming place.'</p><p>Daphne gave me a kiss on my cheek in return. 'Thank you, Harry.'</p><p>Tracey's eyebrows rose up until they were almost hidden behind her brown curls. 'How do you know how the Slytherin common room looks, Harry?'</p><p>'Oh, I went there in my second year to investigate if Malfoy was the heir of Slytherin,' I replied coolly.</p><p>Tracey and Nott stopped dead in their tracks. 'You did what?!'</p><p>Matt gave me a look full of respect. 'Wicked! How did you get in, Harry?'</p><p>I knew Melissa wouldn't thank me for giving him ideas, but I told him. 'I took some Polyjuice Potion, and went into the common room in the disguise of one of Malfoy's friends.'</p><p>Tracey and Nott gave me a doubtful look. 'How did you get your hands on Polyjuice Potion, Potter?' Nott asked.</p><p>'Hermione brewed it in the bathroom of Moaning Myrtle,' I told him.</p><p>He gasped. 'In our second year?'</p><p>'Yeah; she's brilliant, isn't she?'</p><p>His eyes went wide, and he shook his head, but didn't press the matter anymore.</p><p>Beside me, Daphne chuckled quietly. Of course by now she knew about my exploits at Hogwarts, and had had a good laugh when I told her about our Polyjuice adventure in the Slytherin common room. 'I think you broke him, love,' she whispered to me with a broad grin on her face.</p><p>We had walked alongside the building while we talked, and now reached a huge parking lot next to the building. Instead of turning to a quiet corner and Apparating or Portkeying us away from there, Matthew led us to a VW T4 that stood in the middle of the parking lot.</p><p>'That's dad's newest toy,' Tracey informed us, while Matthew opened the door at the rear of the vehicle to store our luggage.</p><p>'We live in a Muggle area,' Matthew informed us as we climbed into the car. 'My mother was a Muggleborn, and I used to visit my maternal grandparents often when I was small. My grandfather used to go fishing with me, and I stuck with the hobby after he passed on. I'm a member of a Muggle fishing club in our area. It would look weird if I show up to our fishing appointments out of thin air, and would pull my shrunken equipment out of the pockets of my trousers, so I bought this car. But of course, it has some improvements.' He grinned, and pressed a button on the dashboard.</p><p>The two rows of seats in the back of the car transformed into comfortable sofas under our behinds. The middle row, where Daphne and I were sitting, made a 180 degree turn, until it faced the back row sofa, on which Tracey, Nott and Matt sat. A low coffee table appeared between the two sofas.</p><p>'Nice feature,' Nott grinned, and put an arm around Tracey's shoulder, not heeding the grimace Matt gave him.</p><p>'Yeah, I like it,' my wife laughed, and snuggled up to me.</p><p>Matt made a gagging noise, and we laughed at him.</p><p>I heard how Melissa opened the glove compartment in front of her. One look over my shoulder told me that it concealed a veritable refrigerator. She pulled a picnic hamper out of the fridge and handed it to me.</p><p>'There! That should last Matt until we're home.'</p><p>With a cry of joy Matt dug into the picnic hamper, while his father threaded his way through the tight traffic of Southampton. I noticed that, no matter how many cars were ahead of us, we inevitably ended at the top of each line waiting in front of the traffic lights, and concluded that Matthew must have equipped his car with the same feature the Ministry cars boasted. I began to wonder if it was possible to improve every Muggle car with these features.</p><p>Nott's thoughts obviously went along the same lines. 'I never would've thought that travelling with a Muggle car is this comfortable and fast,' he remarked, opening a bottle of butterbeer. We had just reached the outskirts of Southampton, and Matthew was about to enter the M3.</p><p>'Yeah,' I agreed, accepting the bottle he offered me. 'I wonder if it's possible to do something like that with every Muggle car. I always wanted a car, but I'm not fond of standing in traffic jams.'</p><p>'It is,' Matthew told me over his shoulder. 'If you want to buy a Muggle car, Harry and Theo, I'll help you to make the changes.'</p><p>'Thank you, sir, that's very generous of you,' Nott said, and I echoed his thanks.</p><p>I shared a look with Daphne. 'What do you think, love?'</p><p>She gave me an amused smile. 'I'd rather join you in a ride in a sports car than in a ride on a racing broom, so I say go for it.'</p><p>Tracey raised an eyebrow. 'You never seemed like the sports car type to me, Harry.'</p><p>Daphne snorted at that. 'You don't know him, Tracey. This one's an adrenaline junkie, if I've ever met one. Higher, faster – you get the picture. He even went diving with sharks a couple of weeks ago.'</p><p>'You're taking the mickey, Daphne. No one's that idiotic,' Tracey replied with a snort.</p><p>'She's not,' I confirmed Daphne's words.</p><p>Tracey paled, while Nott gave me an impressed glance.</p><p>'Wicked!' Matt breathed. The hero worship in his eyes became even more pronounced. Melissa would want to have my hide for that one day, I was sure.</p><p>'Wasn't that extremely dangerous?' Melissa asked, turning around, and giving me a concerned look.</p><p>'Not at all,' I placated her. 'I was in a strong iron cage, and the beasts could never get at me.'</p><p>'All the same,' Melissa replied, still sounding concerned. 'I wish you wouldn't do such dangerous things, now that you're about to start a family.'</p><p>Daphne and I shared a look. Daphne smirked at me. 'I went with him on that excursion, Melissa,' she said sweetly.</p><p>Melissa let out a cry of dismay, while Tracey and Nott grinned broadly at us.</p><p>'You really know how to get back at mum,' Tracey whispered. 'Did you really enter that cage?'</p><p>Daphne shook her head, while I mouthed at Tracey, 'She stayed on board. Daphne's terrified of sharks.'</p><p>'Smart girl,' Nott grinned. 'What else did you do while you were on that cruise around the world?'</p><p>For the rest of the drive, we regaled them with our adventures. Tracey and Matt perked up as we told them about our surfing trip on Hawaii.</p><p>'I always wanted to go surfing as we lived in California,' Matt exclaimed, and his sister nodded to that.</p><p>'Me, too,' she admitted. 'Unfortunately, it never came to that. The money dad, mum and I managed to make with odd jobs while we hid in the Muggle world was barely enough to pay for the necessities. We didn't dare to go into the magical world, and had no access to our savings.'</p><p>I startled at her words. It never had occurred to me that the unpleasant demeanour she had shown in San Francisco might be due to constant sorrows about how to make a living for the family.</p><p>Nott confirmed my thoughts. He pulled his fiancé closer to him and dropped a kiss on her head. 'At least you don't have to worry about that anymore, love.'</p><p>'Maybe we all can go surfing one day,' Daphne suggested. 'I've been told there are some good surf spots in Cornwall.'</p><p>While Tracey and Matt agreed enthusiastically to that, Nott looked doubtful, yet intrigued.</p><p>'You look less than thrilled, Nott,' I observed under the cover of Matt's chatter.</p><p>He gave a helpless shrug. 'Don't get me wrong, Potter. It surely sounds like a lot of fun, but – I can't swim. Purebloods usually don't enter in Muggle activities. My father would've flagellated me, had I ever expressed a desire to exercise Muggle sports.' His face was calm, but the slight quiver in his voice betrayed a feeling of resentment, and his eyes didn't meet mine.</p><p>'I couldn't swim, either, when I started the cruise,' I told him. 'Daphne showed me how to do it. She loves every sport done in and on the water. Maybe she'll consent teaching you how to swim, too.'</p><p>Nott looked surprised at that revelation. Apparently, he didn't know that detail about his former house mate. I knew from Daphne that she had never shared many details about her life with her house mates.</p><p>'That'd be nice,' he answered. However, we couldn't continue our conversation. Matthew left the M25, and turned south toward Royal Tunbridge Wells.</p><p>'We'll be home in another ten minutes,' he announced.</p><p>I looked at my wristwatch: not even one hour had passed. Uncle Vernon often had had business in this area while I still had to live with my relatives. From his complaints I knew damned well that the drive from Southampton to Royal Tunbridge Wells took at least two hours, given there wasn't any traffic jam. Now I was really curious to learn how Matthew had modified his Muggle VW bus.</p><p>I was pulled out of my musings by my wife, who began to show me the landmarks of her home county. Daphne had told me that Grenian House, the ancestral home of the Greengrass family, was near Royal Tunbridge Wells in Kent. I was still amazed that she grew up not even an hour away from me by car. Traditionally, the other family members settled down around Grenian House. The Davis' were no exception to that: Melissa and Matthew had bought a house in Royal Tunbridge Wells after they had returned from the States.</p><p>Not even ten minutes later, as he had promised, Matthew pulled the VW bus to a stop in front of a narrow-breasted Victorian terraced house on York Street that was painted in a cheerful vanilla yellow, with white shutters.</p><p>We all filed out of the car, happy to stretch our legs. The weather had brightened; odd rays of sunshine made their way through the clouds that weren't as dense anymore as they had been in Southampton. Melissa led us the few steps up to the front entrance. The house looked small from the outside, but that was deceiving. Each floor boasted two well lit, spacious rooms.</p><p>After we had refreshed ourselves, Melissa ushered us to the spacious dining room left of the entrance. A festive looking table was set in front of the ornate fireplace, and decked with Melissa's finest porcelain and silverware, glinting festively in a beam of sunshine that had found its way through the broad bow window that looked out on York Street. The delicious fragrance of a slow cooked roast permeated the air, and I realised that I was hungry.</p><p>Daphne and I had had a rather early breakfast that morning, "before even the birds are up", as my wife complained, and then made sure we had everything packed before we put our luggage in front of the entrance door of our suite, so that the crew could take it from board as soon as we arrived in Southampton. We had to leave our suite after that, and spent the time until the <em>Princess Isabella </em>reached Southampton in the Atrium, together with the Meehans. Though we would have loved to watch the coast of England coming nearer, that experience was prevented by frequent showers of rain, and Daphne an Alvirah's outright refusal to go outside. We had reached Southampton around noon, and by now it was well after lunch time. No wonder my stomach made appreciative little flipflops when my brain registered the smell of roast.</p><p>Matthew opened a bottle of champagne and filled our glasses. 'Let's toast to the two young couples amidst us,' he said, raising his glass. 'May your life together be filled with happiness and love.'</p><p>'To happiness and love,' we echoed.</p><p>Melissa and Tracey then vanished into the kitchen that was on the ground floor, just as at my house on Grimmauld Place. They returned a few minutes later, conducting a line of plates and bowls filled with delicious looking – and smelling – food with their wands.</p><p>We enjoyed a wonderful meal. Melissa's cooking could give Mrs Weasley's a run for her money. I told her that, and she looked pleased, albeit she said, 'Tracey was a big help in all the preparations.'</p><p>'Lucky you,' Tracey told her fiancé without a hint of false modesty. 'In contrary to me, Daphne can't cook. Poor Harry is in for an unpleasant surprise if he ever lets her near a stove.'</p><p>Daphne wasn't fazed by that. 'Yeah, it's really fortunate that Harry is a master cook, considering that I'll even burn water. However, he offered to teach me. Maybe there's hope for me, after all.'</p><p>'Good luck with that,' Tracey chuckled, and took a sip of her wine. 'Did she tell you that I had to do all the cutting during our Potions classes? Daphne can't hold a knife without cutting herself.'</p><p>I joined the laughter that followed that remark. 'I know; she told me in Saigon when we booked that cookery course. Our teacher and I had to do most of the cooking, while Daphne afterwards did most of the eating.'</p><p>'Hey, I resent that!' my wife exclaimed, and gave me an idignant slap on the arm, but nevertheless joined the laughter at her expense.</p><p>Nott, however, raised an eyebrow at me. 'You can cook, Potter? Our house elves never let me near the kitchen. How did you learn to cook, then?'</p><p>'I didn't grow up in the magical world, but with my Muggle relatives,' I informed him over the lip of my wine glass. 'It's quite common for Muggle children to help with household chores.' There was no need to tell him I had been little more than a house elf to my relatives.</p><p>As if sensing my thoughts, Daphne put her hand on mine and gave me a small smile. I smiled back, thankful for her support. Though six months of therapy had helped me to leave the past behind me, I still struggled when the memories of my time with the Dursleys were sprung at me like this.</p><p>Nott looked taken aback. 'You grew up with Muggles?' he exclaimed. 'I had no idea, but of course that explains a lot.'</p><p>Tracey nodded to that.</p><p>Now it was my turn to look puzzled. 'Care to explain that cryptic remark, Nott?'</p><p>He gave me an apologetic look. 'Well, after your parents had been killed, Dumbledore took it upon himself to find a new home for you. You know his reputation, Potter, so you'll understand why nobody questioned his decision, or why the magical world just accepted his declaration that he'd brought you to a safe place.'</p><p>Daphne's nostrils flared at that, but she didn't interject.</p><p>'Well, of course no one ever would've thought that the Boy-Who-Lived grew up among Muggles. People just assumed that you'd been given to a magical family that lived very secluded, and sheltered you from the fame. People didn't take it kindly when you turned up in the magical world ten years later, and seemed to trample all over our traditions,' Nott went on.</p><p>'I had no idea. Nobody ever taught me a thing about magical traditions. Maybe I should've thought about that myself, but most of my schoolyears I was somehow distracted with just trying to stay alive,' I replied. 'At least Daphne has brought me up to par.'</p><p>'Yeah, and I can tell you, it wasn't easy,' my wife interjected, trying to light up the mood, and also trying to steer the conversation away from my upbringing. I gave her a small, thankful smile, and she winked at me. 'You won't believe how many times this lump stepped on my feet during the dance classes,' she told Nott and Tracey dramatically.</p><p>Nott gave me an amused look over the rim of his glass. 'You took dance classes, Potter?'</p><p>'Daphne forced me to,' I replied, mock-glaring at my wife, while I cut my meat.</p><p>That had everyone laugh, and of course they wanted to hear more about the tortures I had endured while Daphne tutored me in wizarding traditions.</p><p>After the excellent meal, Melissa invited us to have coffee in the parlour on the first floor. When we filed out of the dining room, Daphne stayed behind, and motioned to Nott to stay with her. Melissa and Matthew shared a wistful smile, while Tracey suddenly looked anxious.</p><p>I touched her arm and held her back. 'Don't worry, I think they'll come to an agreement.'</p><p>She didn't look convinced. 'I know that Daphne gave her agreement to our betrothal as my head of house, but I also know that I can't expect the customary dowry from her. After we returned from the USA, we heard how bad the war has been for the economy of the magical world. Dad got his job back, but he had to accept a much smaller pay because the tax revenue is so low, and the Ministry can't afford to pay the wages they paid before the war.' She bit her lip. 'Theo's also not as well off as the Notts used to be. His father squandered huge amounts of money to support that monster, and what was left was conviscated by the Ministry. Theo has to make due with what he inherited from his mother. It isn't much, and we both don't have our N.E.W.T.s, due to the war, so we can't get a good job. The Nott family business also is into shambles: nobody wants to deal with the son of a Death Eater. Poor Theo has to built up everything from scratch. We want to get married soon so badly, but I'm afraid we'll have to wait until we have the means to support ourselves.'</p><p>Daphne and I had discussed the problem of Tracey's dowry during our last days on board. Tracey was right; even though the business of Greengrass Shipping was slowly getting better, and Daphne had the income from her mother's trust, it didn't cover half of the dowry Tracey could rightfully expect as her share of the family fortune. I had told Daphne to offer Nott the customary dowry; I would cover for it. A thankful Nott who was indebted to Daphne made a good alley for the Neutral Faction. She hadn't been happy to have to accept money from me for her family, but in the end her practical Slytherin sense won, and she agreed, especially after I had pointed out that she would already be a Potter when the negotiations about the dowry took place, so technically <em>our</em> money would be used to secure the future of <em>our</em> family. She had given me a heart-melting smile when I told her that, and then kissed me until I almost forgot my name.</p><p>We sat down in the elegant parlour. It was directly above the dining room, and also boasted a bow window. Glass paned double doors led into an adjoining parlour.</p><p>Melissa served coffee, and we made small talk. Tracey, however, didn't join our conversation. She stepped to the bow window and looked down on the street, nervously wringing her hands. I couldn't blame her: if her and Nott's financial situation was as strained as she told me, their immediate future depended on the offer Daphne would make them. Not for the first time in my life I sent thankful thoughts to Grandfather Fleamont for providing that well for me. Thanks to him I had an independence only very few people on this planet could enjoy.</p><p>Of course, Melissa was curious to know if Daphne and I had already set a date for the wedding. Her question startled me out of my musings.</p><p>'You know that Daphne wants to get married at Grenian House in the summer,' I told her. 'I have no idea when Daphne will be able to rebuilt the house. She estimated a couple of years.'</p><p>Melissa's cup stopped midway between the saucer and her mouth. 'You can't be serious,' she exclaimed, and I had already my usual answer "No, I'm Harry!'" at the tip of my tongue, when the door opened, and Daphne and Nott entered the room. They both had a smile on their faces.</p><p>The triumphant gleam in my wife's eyes told me that Nott had agreed to all of her demands. I took her hand when she sat down beside me, and kissed her on the cheek in congratulation.</p><p>Nott walked over to the bow window and wrapped his arms around Tracey, whispering into her ear. Tracey's eyes went wide while she listened to him, and then a look of genuine happiness and thankfulness appeared on her face I would never have expected to see. She threw her arms around Nott and kissed him deeply. Then she whirled around and ran to Daphne. Laughing and crying, she hugged my wife.</p><p>Daphne patted her back. 'Shh, it's alright, Tracey!' I could see how touched she was by Tracey's emotions.</p><p>However, it took some time until Tracey regained her composure. She walked back to Nott, who still stood beside the bow window and had watched her all the time with the expression of a love-sick puppy. I was familiar with that expression: I had worn it on my wedding day, and probably still wore it each time I looked at Daphne. She took his hand. 'Now we can think of getting married and both finishing our education together,' she smiled at him. 'Before your generous offer, Daphne, it would've been Theo's turn first, while I earned the money, and then mine.'</p><p>My wife gave me a small push. Reacting to my cue, I cleared my throat. 'Actually, that's something Daphne and I also still have to do,' I told them. 'We thought of hiring private tutors. I already wrote to Headmistress McGonagall for recommendations, and she agreed to talk to us after the Memorial Service. You're welcomed to join us in our studies.'</p><p>Tracey and Nott looked at each other, then beamed at us. 'Thank you, that's very generous of you.'</p><p>Their thankfulness made me uncomfortable. 'Well, the more, the merrier,' I replied, while I slowly turned red.</p><p>Daphne put her hand on my arm and grinned. 'What Harry means is, if you're studying with us, I won't focus solely on him and nag him all the time to do better.'</p><p>Of course, that caused a lot of laughter at my expense.</p><p>We talked some more, until Daphne said, 'I think it's time that Harry and I head home.'</p><p>Melissa gave an uneasy look to her husband, while Tracey and Nott both grinned, obviously enjoying that Daphne had challenged her yet another time.</p><p>'We've prepared the guest bedroom for you, dear,' Melissa told my wife.</p><p>Daphne gave her a mischievous glance. 'That's very friendly of you, Melissa, but I think I prefer to stay with my husband.'</p><p>'Your… what?!' Melissa stared at us, her mouth hanging open. I never would have thought a Pureblood witch - and a Slytherin on top of that - would lose her composure that completely.</p><p>Daphne took my hand, and smiled at her sweetly. 'Harry and I got married on board yesterday.'</p><p>She still stared at us for almost another half minute. Then she jumped up, whooping with joy, and pulled Daphne into a hug that almost crushed her. 'That's wonderful, Daphne; I'm so happy for you.' She released my wife, only to turn around to me, and crush me in an equally fierce hug.</p><p>The rest of her family and Nott followed suit with their congratulations, and Matthew brought out the champagne once more.</p><p>Melissa laughed at Daphne over the rim of her glass. 'You did this on purpose, didn't you?' She gestured towards our rings. We had cancelled the Concealment Charms as soon as Daphne had dropped the bomb.</p><p>'Of course,' Daphne laughed. 'We thought some payback was in order after the way you pestered us ever since that article came out.'</p><p>Melissa had the grace to blush, while the rest of her family laughed.</p><p>It was rather late when we finally made our goodbyes, and not before Melissa, Daphne and Tracey went through the most important details for the two upcoming weddings they had to plan. Nott and I shared a look, and all of a sudden I felt a solidarity towards the Slytherin I wouldn't have thought possible only a year ago. Matthew, catching our glances, chuckled quietly.</p><hr/><p>I Apparated Daphne and me to the small garden in the middle of Grimmauld Square, our shrunken luggage in my pocket.</p><p>'Harry Potter lives at Grimauld Place number twelve,' I told her.</p><p>She looked puzzled. 'You already told me you live in London, so why...' she began, then interrupted herself. 'Did your house just appear between number eleven and number thirteen, or had I one drink too many?'</p><p>I laughed, and took her hand to lead her to the entrance. 'There's nothing wrong with your eyes, love. The house is unplottable and under a Fidelius Charm. I'm the secret keeper. You wouldn't have found it before I told you the secret, even if you'd been standing right in front of it.'</p><p>With Professor Flitwick's help, I had taken down the old Fidelius Charm. After Dumbledore's death each member of the Order who had been told the location of the house had become secret keeper, plus the twins, Ron, Hermione and me. We had inadvertedly added to that circle of people when we took Yaxley into the sphere of the charm. The Death Eaters had taken advantage of that: there hadn't been one piece of furniture left intact when Kreacher and I returned to the house after I had left the Burrow, not to mention that everything that was halfway valuable was missing from the house. I wasn't too fond of an open house, so I put up a new Fidelius Charm, with myself as the secret keeper.</p><p>Daphne gave me an appraising side glance as we walked across the square. 'Is it still necessary for you to stay hidden?'</p><p>I shrugged. 'I'm probably slightly paranoid, but fact is, there are still a number of Death Eaters on the run who'd like to kill me for finishing off their Dark Wanker. I can sleep better that way at night.'</p><p>She didn't comment on that, but a slight frown had appeared on her face.</p><p>We had reached the entrance, and the door opened wide when I tapped my wand against it. Daphne let out a small shriek when I picked her up and carried her over the threshold.</p><p>'Welcome to your new home, Mrs Potter.'</p><p>'You're such a sap,' she informed me, but nevertheless put her arms around my neck, and kissed me until my toes curled.</p><p>A resounding CRACK brought us back to the real world. The next moment, a small missile, clad in a pristine tea towel, hurled itself at me and hugged me around my knees.</p><p>'Master is back! Kreacher is so happy!' my ancient house elf croaked in his bullfrog voice.</p><p>I lowered Daphne back to the ground, mindful not to hurt Kreacher, who still was pressed against my knees as close as possible.</p><p>'Thank you, Kreacher, I'm also happy to see you,' I told him, and patted his head. 'I want you to meet someone.'</p><p>Kreacher raised his head and looked at me. I motioned with my hand at Daphne. 'Kreacher, this is my wife, Daphne.'</p><p>A glow of sheer happiness appeared on Kreacher's ugly face. 'Kreacher has a mistress again!' he croaked, and then hurled himself at Daphne.</p><p>Thankfully, Daphne had grown up with house elves, and was used to the overexited little creatures. 'I'm also happy to meet you, Kreacher,' she said. 'Harry told me so much about you.'</p><p>Kreacher looked up at her with a look of purest adoration that made me stiffle a laugh. 'Mistress bes too good to a lowly house elf! What can Kreacher do for mistress? Does mistress want dinner, or does mistress want tea, or…'</p><p>'Tea would be wonderful,' Daphne smiled at him, and patted him once more. 'We'll have a light dinner after Harry has shown me around.'</p><p>'Tea will be ready in a second,' Kreacher promised.</p><p>'We'll come down into the kitchen as soon as I've introduced Daphne to Grandpa Fleamont,' I informed him.</p><p>The next moment, Kreacher was gone.</p><p>I grabbed Daphne's hand and led her farther into the house. She looked around appreciatively.</p><p>'This is the old Black residence, isn't it? I've heard stories during my childhood how horrible dark it was; even the most bigotted Purebloods from my parent's circles weren't as obsessed as Walburga Black and her husband, and made fun of their obsession with everything Slytherin. I expected a much darker place, but nothing this cheerful and bright. You must have strapped the house of everything, down to the bare walls, and then started from scratch.'</p><p>'Almost,' I agreed. 'The Death Eaters have paid a visit to the house during the war. They knew it was my hideaway, so they destroyed everything they found, or stole it. Kreacher and I swept out the rubble when we returned after the war. Since we already were at it, we thought we as well could do it right, and removed everything down to the bare stones.'</p><p>Kreacher and I had done a thoroughly job with the renovation. The old, dingy hall was hardly recognisable to anyone who had visited the house during the days of the war. We had pulled down the dark wallpaper, and replaced it with a warm, honey coloured one, and added white accents where the walls joined the ceiling. The brass scones and door handles in forms of snakes had been transfigured by Kreacher and me into puristic and modern looking ones, made of brushed brass, after a picture I had found in a magazine about interior decor. We had installed a skylight into the rooftop that provided the staircase and the hallways of the house with natural light. Last but not least, the painting of Walburga Black was gone. I had spent a whole day chiseling out the wall her painting was magically glued to the Muggle way, ever so often renewing the strong Silencing Charm I had to put on her to prevent her screams from deafening me, but it had been worth it.</p><p>The place of honour was now taken up by the magical painting of my grandfather Fleamont Potter, the one I had found in my family vault on my eighteenth birthday, when I had learned about my inheritance. From his place at the wall to the library he had a look at the wall above the staircase. Kreacher and I had buried the heads of the former Black house elves in a secluded spot of the back yard, and then decorated the wall at Grandfather Fleamont's request - or rather demand - with his collection of contemporary Muggle art paintings that had been stowed away in the family vault. Contemporary to his time, that is. Grandfather's pride was a painting of Picasso that Kreacher and I had put on the wall directly opposite of his magical painting, so that he could look at it as often as he wanted.</p><p>'Well, lad, it's good to see you back,' Grandfather Fleamont smiled as Daphne and I walked up to him hand in hand. 'Won't you introduce me to the lovely lady beside you?'</p><p>I was happy to oblige. 'Daphne, meet my grandfather, Fleamont Potter. Grandpa, this is my wife Daphne Potter, nee Greengrass.'</p><p>Grandpa Fleamont roared with laughter. 'So, you went out for a world cruise to get rid of your boredom, and return with a wife barely four months later? You're such a Gryffindor!' He gave my wife an appreciative look. 'Welcome to the family, my dear. So, you're a Greengrass? There was an Albion Greengrass a few years below me during my time at Hogwarts. He played as beater on the Slytherin team since my sixth year, but he surely wasn't as beautiful as you are.'</p><p>I should have known that the old ladykiller couldn't resist to flirt with my wife.</p><p>'That would've been my grandfather,' Daphne replied. 'It's nice to meet you, too, sir.'</p><p>We had a little chat with Grandpa Fleamont, who of course was curious to hear how we had met, and why we got married after only a few months into knowing each other. With the hint that it was getting late, and the promise to have a long chat with him one of these days, I managed to extricate Daphne and me from him.</p><p>'It's uncanny how much you Potter men look alike,' Daphne said as we walked down the stairs to the kitchen. 'I've seen pictures of your father; you have all three the same black and untameable hair, and glasses. Only the colour of your eyes is differently. Your grandfather had brown eyes, your father's were hazel, and yours are green. Other than that, it's hard to tell you apart.'</p><p>'However, if you ask Grandfather Fleamont, he'd tell you he's the best looking of us,' I replied as I opened the door to the kitchen for her.</p><p>Daphne laughed at that, and entered the kitchen. She stopped to have a look around. 'I like this room.'</p><p>Kreacher and I had replaced the floor in the kitchen with a gleaming, honey-coloured hardwood floor, and had painted the walls in a warm vanilla. I had ordered a gas-operated, fire-engine red AGA stove for the kitchen, and sturdy cabinets in a creamy white colour. Kreacher had gone to Diagon Alley and bought an array of copper cauldrons, pots and pans, and other kitchen utensils he arranged below the cabinets and above the stove. The window sill now housed Kreacher's lovingly cared for small jungle of kitchen herbs in stoneware pots. A long, white scrubbed table, and an assortment of mismatching chairs, all painted a creamy white and decorated with colourful cushions, made the kitchen an amazingly warm and cheerful room.</p><p>'Well, as with the rest of the house, there also wasn't much left of the old kitchen after the the Death Eaters paid their visit,' I told her. 'The kitchen has been reduced to a heap of firewood by them, and shards of glass and porcellain, with the odd dented or even molten pot or pan thrown in. Kreacher and I started our renovating job with Vanishing everything that was in the room, which included the chipped tiled floor, and the wooden panels at the back of the room. You can't imagine my amazement when I found a double door to a forgotten family room hidden behind them.'</p><p>I took her by the hand and led her to the glass paned double door that connected the kitchen with the family room.</p><p>'It was filled up to the rafters with the most charming furniture from the Georgian area,' I went on as I opened the door. 'Good luck had it that nothing was cursed, so Kreacher and I restored the furniture and used it for the kitchen and the family room.'</p><p>The family room was painted in the same warm vanilla colour as the kitchen, and the ornate stucco of the fireplace that dominated the room was painted a creamy white. I had found an oriental carpet in my family vault that fitted in nicely. I then had splurged on a huge, burgundy red leather sofa with a matching glass coffee table I placed in front of the fireplace. Kreacher replaced the upholstery of the window seat to match the sofa, while I spurned curtains in favour of the light from the garden streaming into the room. Lots of cushions and blankets, and a pair of the discarded Georgian overstuffed chairs, and end tables, lovingly restaurated by Kreacher and then decorated with lamps and photos of my parents and grandparents in silver frames - all taken from the Potter Family Vault - made the room a cosy haven for relaxing evenings in front of a merrily crackling fire.</p><p>I led Daphne to the bow window at the end of the room. From there, a door led onto a small, sunken patio at the back of the house. It was furnished with a table and a couple of chairs, and I had put up a Muggle barbecue grill there. Kreacher had cooked our meals there while we waited for the kitchen stove being delivered. I pointed to the unkempt backyard that stretched out for another thirty yards behind the patio.</p><p>'You said you love gardening, don't you? Well, I haven't yet come around to put the garden back to order. What do you think of making that our project for the summer?'</p><p>Daphne squealed with delight, and hugged me.</p><p>We then settled down on the sofa. I let my wand slip out of my holster and lit the fire in the fireplace with a silent charm. We had barely sat down when Kreacher bustled over and served us tea and small cakes.</p><p>'It's wonderful, Kreacher, just the way I like it,' Daphne told the expectantly waiting elf after her first sip.</p><p>Kreacher's ugly face beamed like the sun. 'Mistress bes so good to poor Kreacher,' he mumbled rather watery, and returned to the kitchen.</p><p>Daphne snuggled up to me while we sipped our tea. 'It feels somehow strange to be back in England. Just imagine, tomorrow we'll still be in the same place, instead of entering a new port.'</p><p>We both chuckled at that. To be honest, during the last week we both had become slightly travel-weary. There was so much going on in our lives, so many unresolved problems waiting for us to tackle them, that we both were secretly relieved when the end of the cruise got nearer.</p><p>'You'll feel as if you're back for ages within a week, considering everything we'll have on our agenda during the next days,' I told her.</p><p>She made a face at that. 'You're probably right. What do you think, can we squeeze in a visit at Gringotts? Theo at once agreed to all of my demands. In return, he only asked that he and Tracey can marry as soon as possible. Obviously, they aren't planning on a big wedding, just the immediate family, and you and me. Theo's parents are both dead, and just like me he has no uncles or aunts. I promised him to talk with the goblins about the necessary arrangements this week.'</p><p>That suited me just fine. My goblin advisors had more or less ordered me to a visit at Gringotts the upcoming week, but I had planned on that, anyway. Daphne needed to be included into the Potter vaults, and we also needed to talk to the goblins about proper wards for Grenian House.</p><p>'What about Wednesday, after the awards ceremony?' I asked back.</p><p>'Sounds fine to me,' Daphne agreed, stiffling a yawn. 'Gosh, I'm knackered. Will you show me the rest of the house before I fall asleep in front of the fire?'</p><p>I snorted, but got to my feet and hauled her up.</p><p>'The layout of the house is the common layout for a terraced house,' I told her as we climbed up the stairs back to the ground floor. 'A long hallway, and two or three rooms on each floor. Kitchen and family room are on the lower ground floor. Below that is a cellar. At the moment, it's a huge, unused space. The boiler room is down there, and Kreacher has his bedroom next to it, since he refused to sleep in one of the bedrooms of the house I offered to him.'</p><p>'You don't know much about house elves, do you, love? They need dark, confined spaces to feel safe at night. They'd be terrified in a normal bedroom,' my wife taught me.</p><p>'Thanks for the lecture in Magical Creatures,' I grinned, and then went on with my tour of the house. 'The library and the dining room are supposed to be on the ground floor, with two reception rooms on the first floor.'</p><p>Daphne arched her delicate brows at that. 'Supposed to?'</p><p>I scratched my neck. 'Well, as I told you, we had that little problem with the Death Eater visit. Kreacher and I simply Vanished the rubble in each room, put in new floors and wallpaper, and left it at that. So far, only the kitchen, the family room and my bedroom are fully furnished. But see for yourself.' I pulled open the door to the former library, and guided her inside the room.</p><p>'Indeed, the room is a trifle sparsely decorated,' Daphne deadpanned.</p><p>There was nothing left of the unique Black collection of books about the dark arts. The Death Eaters had shred them to confetti, and I hadn't bothered to restore them. Hermione probably would have my head for that, had she known. Kreacher and I had put a dark coloured hardwood floor into the room, and a bright yellow wallpaper on the walls, that both emphasised the fireplace made of green marble. The huge bow window looked on the square, and let in a lot of light after Kreacher finally had removed the grime of decades.</p><p>I put my arm around Daphne's shoulders. 'I hope you like house decorating, love. I'm pants at it.'</p><p>She grinned at me, an excited gleam in her eyes. 'I'd say you did a very good job with the kitchen and the family room, Harry. But I'm happy that there's still some work left to do for me. That will make it my house, too, instead of simply moving in your house.'</p><p>'Be careful what you wish for, love,' I quipped, and kissed her. She understood what I meant when I showed her the bare dining room, and then the two reception rooms on the first floor that were as bare.</p><p>The former Tapestry Room on the first floor had also undergone a complete change. Just like with Ol' Wally's portrait, I had had to remove the tapestry with Muggle means. Kreacher and I had then connected the Tapestry Room and the adjoining parlour with a pair of double doors. The effort had been worth it. The double doors joined two pleasantly sized, light flooded reception rooms, that both boasted an ornate fireplace. There was also a small room on this floor I used as a study. It was furnished with just the essentials: a desk, a chair and a shelf where I kept ink and parchment.</p><p>Daphne scrunched her nose quite adorably. 'Indeed, there's room for improvement here.'</p><p>I pulled her with me to the next floor. 'At least our bedroom is fully furnished. You won't have to do anything there.'</p><p>But when I opened the door to the master bedroom, Daphne stopped right in her tracks. 'You're joking, Harry, aren't you?'</p><p>I had no idea what she was talking about. I had spend a long time and a lot of money on decorating the master bedroom. The huge fourposter bed in the middle of the room looked just as my bed in the Gryffindor dorms. The curtains on the huge windows that overlooked Grimmauld Place matched the scarlett bedcurtains and the scarlet and gold stripped wallpaper. Armchairs that reminded me of the chairs in the Gryffindor common room made a small seating area in front of the window. The floor was covered with a fluffy carpet in a soft gold, with a couple of red patterned rugs scattered about it. I had no wardrobe; there was a huge walk-in closet next to the ensuite bathroom.</p><p>My confusion must have shown on my face, because my wife smiled at me with a small shake of her head. 'The room is decorated in Gryffindor colours, love.'</p><p>'Oh!' I paused. 'You don't like them, do you?'</p><p>She shook her head. 'No, I don't. They're so - brassy. While I like bright colours, the combination of scarlett and gold is a little too much.'</p><p>'Well, you won't see much of them when you're asleep,' I tried. 'And we'll probably can think of something to distract you from the colours when we're in here.'</p><p>As I had expected, that earned me a soft slap on my arm for my cheek. 'Prat,' she said, and I grinned.</p><p>Daphne continued looking at the room with a slight frown. 'We won't have to change everything. For example, we can keep the red and gold colour scheme, but mute it down somehow, so that the colours aren't that shrill,' she mused. She looked up at me, a hopeful and pleading expression on her face. 'What do you think, love?'</p><p>Of course, she knew that I could never resist that look. 'Alright,' I agreed, and was rewarded with a blinding smile, and a hug and a kiss that made me think I would happily give in to all her wishes if it got me kisses like this one.</p><p>We continued our sightseeing tour through the house. There was an additional bedroom on this floor, but it was completely bare, down to the stone walls. The three bedrooms on the third floor were the same. I also hadn't changed the old bathroom up there, and Daphne grimaced at the grimy looking tiles, and the reptilian feet of the bathtub. The fourth floor had two additional bedrooms, and a shared bathroom. The twins and Remus had stayed up here when the house was used by the Order of the Phoenix, I remembered.</p><p>However, the fourth floor contained another surprise of the house that had been hidden away by Ol' Wally and her abysmal taste of interior decoration. The second bedroom and the hallway opened onto a small, walled in patio. Beyond the patio was a conservatory that covered the width of the house and looked over the garden, though we couldn't see much of that since dusk was falling rapidly. A narrow, winding iron stair led from the patio to a rooftop terrace atop of the bedrooms.</p><p>Daphne let out a small squeal of delight when I showed the conservatory to her.</p><p>'It was completely boarded up when Kreacher and I came up here,' I told her. 'Apparently, Walburga Black didn't like to sit in a conservatory on sunny, yet cold days. We repaired the broken window panes, but other than that we haven't done much up here.'</p><p>My wife looked around. 'This is a wonderful place to relax. The bedroom that opens onto the patio would make a nice shared study for us. We could put potted plants into the patio and the conservatory, and furnish the conservatory with a table and chairs. We can have our tea there whenever it's too cold to sit outside. What do you think?'</p><p>I wrapped my arms around her, and dropped a kiss on her head. 'That sounds lovely.'</p><p>Daphne returned my hug, but it was clear to me that she was distracted, obviously already planning the decoration of our joined study, the patio and the conservatory in detail in her head. I had to admit I was looking forward to see Daphne's touch on the house. There was no doubt that it would be a great improvement to the way the house looked under Walburga Black's care.</p><p>We were pulled out of our musings by Kreacher, who apparated right beside us.</p><p>'Dinner is ready, mistress!' he announced with an adoring look at Daphne.</p><p>'Thank you, Kreacher. We'll be down in a minute.'</p><p>'Yes, misstress,' Kreacher replied happily, and apparated away.</p><p>Daphne and I exchanged an amused smile. 'You've made a conquest there,' I informed her. 'It took years until he accepted me.'</p><p>My wife flipped her hair over her shoulder and gave me a mock-haughty look. 'Well, love, you don't have my dazzling beauty, and my sophisticated demeanour.'</p><p>'Yeah, right,' I deadpanned. 'Not to mention your modesty.' Of course, that earned me a slap on the arm, and we broke out into laughter.</p><p>We were still laughing when we entered the kitchen and sat down for the delicious meal Kreacher had prepared for us. However, our mood changed during dinner. We both became silent and pensive when our thoughts turned to the day ahead of us.</p><p>'I'm afraid of tomorrow,' my wife admitted, her finger circling the rim of her glass. 'I don't know if I can hold it together when Mum and Dad's names are read out.'</p><p>I reached across the table and covered her free hand with mine. 'You're not alone there, love. I'm with you all the time. Besides that, everyone who's attending the Memorial Service will be troubled. We've all lost people we love in the wars.'</p><p>She nodded at that, but it didn't seem to help with her inner turmoil, and she kept being silent and withdrawn for the rest of the day.</p><p>
