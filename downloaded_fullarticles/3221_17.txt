    <p>Everyone had heard of Harry Potter, the boy who brought an end to he-who-must-not-be-named, the boy that now lived at Privet Drive with his muggle aunt, uncle and cousin. Everyone knew of the strange shaped scare upon his forehead, and how his parents had died in order to protect him.</p>
<p>But no-one knew of the young girl who lived on the other side of England. The pre-teen that lived her life like any normal girl, who went to school every morning and came home every night to her mother, who welcomed her with a home cooked meal and open arms.</p>
<p>No one knew of her and no one needed too. As far as the world was concerned, there was nothing special about her. Nothing at all.</p>
<p>Of course, that wasn't true.</p>
<p>Her mother had kept a big secret from her for the last 10 years. A secret so huge, she altered her entire live to keep it hidden away. <br/>She'd moved houses, changed names, re-created her closet and even altered the way she spoke. But even then, she knew it would never stay a secret. She knew that one day everything would change. She knew she'd be forced to move back, throw away her clothes and return to her traditional way of speaking. <br/>Yet, she didn't mind. In fact, she was eager to return. Too long she'd spent in the shadows, hiding herself from not only the community around her but from her own child. So, she took matters into her own hands. There was no possible way she'd be able to wait a complete year, she'd already taken too long.</p>
<p>That night she unlocked her old, worn out trunk and pulled out something she hadn't seen in what seemed forever. Her quill. It took her hours to craft the perfect letter, but when she finally did, she sighed in relief and sent it off. It was only two weeks later that she asked her daughter to sit, taking a deep breath as she rehearsed the speech over and over in her head.</p>
<p>"Morgan, I have something to tell you." She sat down as the young girl stared up at her, eyes wide with confusion. "There's something you need to know."</p>
<p>Morgan nodded, confused but still eager for her mother to continue. This couldn't possibly be about her father, could it?</p>
<p>"There's no easy way to say this, so I'll just spit it out." The older woman took a few deep breaths, even shaking her head and lowly muttering to herself for a moment.</p>
<p>Morgan's mind ran at a thousand miles a minute, this was it. Her mother finally thought she was old enough to know the truth, to know who her father was and what he was doing. She screwed her eyes shut with anticipation, already imagining who he could be and what he'd look like. What was his name? Did he like milk chocolate or dark chocolate? Or did he favour white chocolate above all else? What was his job? Did he have a beard? Did she really have his eyes? Why did he leave her mother? Why did he leave her?</p>
<p>After all this time, did he want to meet her?</p>
<p>Her mother stared down at her, eyes instantly glazing over as she studied the tiny human. Maybe she was wrong and she wasn't ready yet. She was still a child, she shouldn't have wrote to Dumbledore. How could she put her own needs in front of her child's health?</p>
<p>Then she shook her head, silently cursing at herself. Morgan wasn't weak, she wasn't a tiny child and she was definitely ready.</p>
<p>"Morgan, hunny..." taking one last, deep breath, she spilled the beans. "I'm a witch."</p>
<p>Morgan clearly wasn't expecting it, as she suddenly snapped her eyes open and stared up at her mother. It seemed that a fire had lit inside her, as she angrily shook her head. "Are you joking? That's not funny, mum. I thought you were going to tell me something serious but you were just prank me! Wh-"</p>
<p>Morgan's words tuned out, her mother now wide eyed. She had ran over multiple possible reactions her daughter could have in her head, but she never expected that. "I'm not lying, or joking, Morgan."</p>
<p>"Really?" Morgan looked around, mouth wide as she let out an angry huff. "Prove it."</p>
<p>Now Y/N had been expecting that, so she instantly reached behind her and to the waistband of her jeans, where she pulled a long, slim, wooden stick out.</p>
<p>Her daughter watched with judgmental eyes as Y/N pointed her wand across the room and muttered something under her breath. Morgan's eyes widened as a large cake lifted off the kitchen bench and made its way across to them, floating in the air as it did so.</p>
<p>"I-uh- w-w-" while Morgan stuttered over her words, Y/N did the same to a knife and two plates, bringing them over so she could cut two slices of cake and push one over to the young girl.</p>
<p>"Enough proof for you?" Y/N couldn't help but smirk as the words left her mouth, her daughter nodding hysterically as she eyed the cake. "Now, I told you this because you're no squib."</p>
<p>Morgan arched her eyebrow at the last word, silently asking for context. Y/N ignored her and continued on. "Students usually start at Hogwarts after their eleventh birthday. I wrote to the headmaster, Dumbledore, and he's allowed you to come a year early."</p>
<p>Morgan's eyebrows furrowed, he lips turning into a confused type pout. "I don't understand."</p>
<p>"Morgan," Y/N took another deep breath, tipping the corners of her lips into a genuine smile. "You're a witch, too and you're going to go to a school that teaches you magic."</p>
<p>Morgan's eyes lit up like an American sky on the 4th of July. She bit her lip to stop herself from smiling to widely, he eyes roaming across her mother's face to see if she was lying or not. They remained like this for a while, Morgan over the moon while her mother studied her, a smile on her own face.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as if a switch had flicked, Morgan's face dropped and her eyes darted to the ground.</p>
<p>"Sweetie, what's wrong?" Y/n whispered softly, as if not to spook her.</p>
<p>"It's just-" she sighed but tried to cover it up.</p>
<p>"If you don't want to go then you don't have to, there's always next year." The older woman spoke softly, her hand coming to tuck a strand behind her child's ear.</p>
<p>"It's not that, mum." Morgan licked her lips but didn't look up from the ground. "It's just, what about you? I can't leave you here, all alone."</p>
<p>She was shocked when she heard her mother laugh softly, her eyes instantly glancing up at her. Y/n's smile was bigger than ever, eyes glinting as the light reflected off them.</p>
<p>"Oh hunny, don't worry." Her voice was still as soft as honey. "I'll be coming, too."</p>
<p>Morgan's eyes widened, eyebrows darting up her forehead. "Y-you will?"</p>
<p>"Of course, Dumbledore has asked me to teach Muggle Studies."</p>
<p>Morgan's eyebrows instantly dropped so low that they almost cover her eyes. "What's a m-muggle?"</p>
<p>Y/n laughed again, shaking her head. "Oh Merlin, you have so much to learn."</p>
