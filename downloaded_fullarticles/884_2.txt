    <p>To say that the past two weeks for one Sirius Orion Black was tiresome would have been the understatement of the century. Hell, if you said that it was the worst week that one wizard had experienced since the time of Merlin and Morgana duking it out, it still wouldn’t have been sufficient. The unlucky, idiotic sod who could have dared to utter such words would have also received a steel toed boot up the ass and something far more painful than a stinging hex.</p><p>The man was strung-out physically and mentally. His entire world had been shattered on Samhain’s blessed night. The time that should have been one of peace and ritual had been ruined by the screech of the wards Sirius had secretly placed around his dear friend’s home falling.</p><p align="center">

</p><p>Even now, sitting in the overstuffed leather armchair before the fireplace as he was, Sirius hadn’t quite rid himself of the adrenaline induced daze that had engulfed him at the sight of the Dark Lord’s mark twisting upon itself above the quaint little home of the man he had come to see as his brother. James Potter and Lily Potter nee Evans were dead, leaving Sirius to remember how the stars that winked back at him that night seemed so cold and cruel as he stood among the wreckage and bodies.</p><p>Once again, Sirius found himself retracing his steps through his memories, the parlor fading around him. Sirius tried to remember every little detail from the night, hoping that would help him cope with the reality of the situation he had found himself in.</p><p>That night, magic had been crackling in the air and it traced its way up and down Sirius’s frame ruthlessly like a hoard of vengeful spiders, raising the hairs on both his arms and neck.</p><p>It was dark magic. Many of Merlin’s ilk would have turned tail and ran from stifling sensation. Especially when that magic was currently running wild without direction. One wrong swish and twitch of the wand or even the thought of casting a spell might make the residual dark magic react. For one that didn’t know how to handle this shade of magic it could devour them and their magical core.</p><p>Yes, any magic without direction was dangerous. Dark magic though, always demanded a price for its service.</p><p>For Sirius, however, the sensation was familiar, his own core thrummed with welcome to it as the magic sunk into his skin. It had been accepting, sensing the Black as one worthy of understanding it and waiting eagerly to see if he would dare to give it direction.</p><p>He hadn’t. Sirius remembered instead stumbling up the stairs, refusing to let the tears that were nearly blinding him fall, as he stepped carefully over James’ body and then over Lily’s. The young woman’s name hadn’t done her justice. No one flower could have encompassed all her beauty, the goodness, and the fieriness of her spirit. Her red hair had fanned out across the carpet like a halo, one of her hands still outstretched towards the crib. It had been with dread that he forced himself to check to see if the babe had survived.</p><p>As soon as Sirius had stepped foot on the property he had been assaulted with the scent of scorched wood and carpet, along with the worrying tang of blood. James and Lily had not bled, which wasn’t surprising when it was well known that the Dark Lord preferred to use the killing curse whenever he did his own dirty work. The blood could only have been from the last unaccounted for occupant of Godric’s Hollow. His breath trembled when Sirius finally forced himself to lean over the crib. </p><p>The sight of vivid green eyes puffy from tears and pouting lips had pulled out a shaking sob from the Animagus. With shaking hands Sirius scooped up the infant in his arms, felt the little heart beating under his palm, and relished in the small fist quickly catching strands of his long, curly hair.</p><p>In any other circumstance, Sirius would have winced and whined in pain from how tight the grip on his locks was. Then though, he hadn’t given a damn.  </p><p>The Prongslet. Moony’s cub. His pup. His godson…</p><p>Harry James Potter was alive and seemed relatively unharmed other than the small wound on his forehead which was marked curiously to look like a lightning bolt. More dark magic was pouring out of the wound, its signature was one that the Auror recognized easily.</p><p>Avada Kadavra. Somehow, little Harry had survived the killing curse. Even now, Sirius was still trying to put all of the pieces of that night together.</p><p>Along with the fact that they had been betrayed. Not just the Potters had suffered from the treachery, but so many others that had been gifted with the treat that was the vibrant couple. Peter Pettigrew, the stinking rat, was the secret keeper for the Potter’s and could be the only one responsible. Rage had gripped Sirius so powerfully then, and even now his very being howled with lust for the taste of the traitor’s blood on his tongue and to rip into his flesh with his teeth.</p><p>In another life, Sirius was certain that his anger and thirst for revenge would have blinded him into doing something he would have regretted. That wasn’t to say that the dark-haired wizard would have mourned Peter’s blood on his hands. No, not at all, but he would have been disgusted with himself for not focusing on the orphan in his arms.</p><p>Staying focused on his last living link to what Sirius thought of as his family.</p><p>But that was not here or there, as there had been a tug on his magic that night, just a minute or two after Sirius had lifted the boy in his arms.</p><p>It had been a request for him to return home, a sensation that had been ingrained into Sirius from a young age. In his distraught state, unable to think clearly, and excess magic now practically bubbling under his skin, Sirius had been running on what muggles would call ‘auto-pilot ’. With a turn of his heel, still clutching the small form that was Harry to his chest, Sirius apparated back to Gimmauld Place. He was greeted by an unimpressed Kreacher, whom had said that he had summoned the ‘unworthy son of his late masters'’ back to ask if he should extinguish the Samhain ritual candles or if the ungrateful whelp of Black was wanting the manor to burn down.</p><p>Sirius had answered with an attempt to kick the blasted old house elf, but the wretch had popped himself just out of reach at the last second. The act of violence had jostled Sirius’s package and made Harry start to shriek. Guilt immediately grabbed him, he didn’t want to put the child through more stress and trauma. Not when what Harry had already received this night was greater than all others Harry had gathered through his short life together. He couldn’t subject Harry to anything more, not after what he had suffered. How they both had suffered.</p><p>After taking a moment to calm himself while gently rocking Harry in his arms, Sirius started to plan. Despite what his jovial, reckless, and uncaring attitude might lead others to believe, Sirius Black was no fool. He had always had secrets that he kept close to his chest, he had been forced to as it was the only way to ensure his survival from the moment the hat put him in Gryffindor.</p><p>Yes, from time to time when he was younger his emotions and impulses could get the better of him, leading to trouble that extended past schoolboy fun and jests. However, with age had come wisdom and weariness of having to face down far too many wands and seeing so much death as a result of this hypocritical war.</p><p>The first thing Sirius did, after tending to Harry’s wound the best to his abilities, was strengthen the wards around the manor and cut access to it from anyone without untainted Black blood. The floo network was closed off with a wave of his hand. All the portraits were then flipped to face the wall, though not without some nasty protests from their occupants.</p><p>Harry and Sirius needed all the peace and quiet that they could get, and it was an extra security measure to ensure that information would not slip out of the manor. There was already a nursery set up in one of the many rooms of the manor that was filled with toys and supplies from Lily and James’ frequent visits. Sirius called for Kreacher to move the crib into his room, he hadn’t been about to let the small boy out of his sight.</p><p>Harry just slumbered on after crying himself out as his godfather worked, writing letters and extracting key memories from Sirius's own mind which he then copied. They would prove that Peter was the secret keeper and that Sirius had rights to Harry as his legal guardian. He sent the packages through a house elf he trusted more than the crotchety nuisance.</p><p>They would be delivered to one Albus Dumbledore, Alastor Moody, Remus Lupin, and Minerva McGonagall.</p><p>The letters were short. Relaying only a few facts: Harry was in his possession, safe, and would remain so. The place they were staying was only known and accessible to the Black family. Sirius wasn’t going to appear back in public until things got more settled. He was heartbroken, but not about to fly off the boom handle to go after Peter Pettigrew, who was the traitor in the Order and an unregistered Animagus whose form was a rat.</p><p>Finally, Sirius Orion Black was not a Dark wizard.</p><p>Unfortunately, the last comment was a lie and it still made Sirius almost physically ill to admit that to himself.</p><p>He had played at being Light for so long, had since he got his acceptance letter to Hogwarts. Maybe it had been out of a misguided act of rebellion from growing up in a strict household, but it had been too dangerous to change his actions once he was a student and had declared himself to be a darkness hating Gryffindor. It had broken his parents’ hearts that their heir had rebelled and rejected all that they had taught. The senior Blacks had played their part of disgust and anger well in the public eye, but they had never disowned Sirius. Family was a far too valuable to their small number and they obviously had hoped that he would come back into the fold with time.</p><p>Sirius had, at least partly, about halfway through his Hogwarts’ career.</p><p>There was more to the rumor of the <em>Black Family Madness</em> than half of the wizarding community knew. All those of Black blood were dark or at least some shade of grey. Sirius was born with magic dark as they came, same as his younger brother and parents.</p><p>Dark magic was something that utterly baffled those of the Light, being unable to understand it and unwilling to attempt to as it so often offended those with more…. Sensitive morals.</p><p>All forms of magic seemed to have a life of its own, but Dark magic required more will and focus from the wizard to summon and mold it into doing what he wanted. Dark spells also demanded full visualization and understanding of what its affect would bring, if one didn’t understand the consequences… the results weren’t forgiving.</p><p>Dark magic was heavy and clung to those that used it, constantly it bubbled and grew inside of the wizard or witch’s core. If this excess magic wasn’t expressed regularly, it could very well drive one mad.</p><p>It was because of their bred in obsessive nature that the Blacks often suffered from a case of too much dark magic in their systems. In the past, many of Sirius’s ancestors suffered from being so consumed in the passions of their studies and research that they forgot to express the excess magic on schedule. Forgetting to do this once or twice wouldn’t be so detrimental, but when done repeatedly their minds would slowly become unhinged as a result.</p><p>Sirius’s precarious situation of being among nosy Gryffindors and playing the role of not following his family’s trend, had made his life at Hogwarts incredibly difficult. For the first couple of years, Sirius managed to get away with casting little to no dark magic. However, it came at a cost, his ‘pranks’ with his new friends became nastier as his focus and reasoning became increasingly distorted.</p><p>It was only after the incident that had almost led to the death of another student that Sirius realized that he couldn’t ignore the truth.</p><p>He was Dark and there was no changing this fact.</p><p>The night that he had slunk down to the dungeons after curfew still stayed in his mind. His feet had felt both incredibly heavy and light as he made his way to the secret room behind a portrait of a kelpie that both Regulus and his parents had told him about. It was a chamber which students used to shed their excess magic, to take part in traditional rituals, and for the older students who dared, to practice Dark spells and potions.</p><p>There had been a few sneers the first few times that Sirius had entered the secret room and performed his shedding rituals, but in general the mood that came off the other students had been one of relief. The heir of Black’s seeming acceptance of himself, them, and of dark magic meant that their own risk of exposure was eliminated. The hostility between a majority of the Slytherins and Sirius had been one spawned out of fear, both sides fearing that the other would reveal to the rest of the world all their nasty little truths. So easily, they could have doomed themselves. It was in hushed, tense tones that an agreement was struck between them all and Sirius.</p><p>Out in the halls of Hogwarts, Sirius would remain the foolhardy, aggressive Gryffindor that enjoyed magic the color of sunlight. However, beyond the portrait, Sirius was one of them. He was a dark wizard, an honorary Slytherin, and the young future Lord Black.</p><p>Dark magic wasn’t evil, just inherently different. Dark wizards and witches were born, though some whose core magic shinned as bright as the sun could wander into the shadows and learn to use some dark spells with difficulty.</p><p>Using “Light” magic wasn’t as challenging for those of the Dark as, maybe the spell wouldn’t be preformed perfectly when cast for the first time. But that wasn’t uncommon for a magical person of any ilk when learning a new spell, which thankfully meant that students with dark magic weren’t easily fingered when sitting in their classrooms at Hogwarts. After seeing centuries of their kind persecuted, hunted, maimed, and murdered, there were things that the dark community did to ensure their nature and secrets were kept.</p><p>With the knowledge of the spell <em>prior incantato</em> being used to expose the previous spells a wand had cast, Dark wizards and witches had taken to owning multiple wands. There was another reason for this, certain wand cores would refuse to cast dark spells and vice versa. Each dark caster would have at least two wands on their person always. One that was strong at casting light spells and one for dark. The wand for dark magic usually had a core that could handle both types of magic relatively well. When a Dark child went to Hogwarts they would usually have multiple wands as well, while they would only use their light handling wand in their classes, they kept their duel and or dark wand strapped to themselves out of sight to continue building a bond with the instrument.</p><p>There was a reason so many Dark witches and wizards were in Slytherin, it was because they learned from a young age to be cunning enough to survive in a world where half of the community and the muggle one would gladly see them burn.</p><p>In many cases, such as in the past, this was literal.</p><p>Sure, there were some light or neutral magic users that lost their lives in the flames and mania that was the muggle witch trials, but the majority that had been killed were those of Morgana’s clan.</p><p>It was well known that Salazar Slytherin was a Dark wizard, but most didn’t realize that the founders were equally split. Rowan Ravenclaw was also a Dark witch, her thirst for knowledge led her to exploring as deeply as she could in all facets of magic during her rather short life. As such, there were places built into Hogwarts that were made with the express purpose for students with Dark magic to be able to express it safely and in secret. It didn't matter what house they came from and in Sirius's time at Hogwarts the only house that didn't have less than one dark magic user was Gryffindor.</p><p>By the founding of Hogwarts’ time, the division between the casts of magic was well established, but the hostility had simmered steadily downwards from the time of the founders’ deaths. Then, like the seasons unfailing cycle, the tensions between dark and light magic users once again began to rise with Grindelwald’s search for power. Even with one Dark lord’s fall, another rose to take his place…</p><p>Unfortunately, the next was Voldemort.</p><p>That bastard led to where Sirius was now, nursing a far too tall glass of firewhiskey, with Harry upstairs down for a nap. There was a charm placed on the infant to alert Sirius when he woke up and needed him.</p><p>Thankfully, Harry had remained pretty accepting of his life with his ‘Pa’Foo’. Still whenever the boy babbled out for his mum or da, Sirius felt his heart shatter anew and he knew his strategy of redirecting the baby’s attention to something else would only last for so long. An explosive tantrum would eventually come, and Sirius wasn’t sure how long and how many times it would take Harry to realize that his parents weren’t coming back. He didn’t know if he wanted such a young child to understand the reason.</p><p>It wasn’t fair.</p><p>But bitching and whining wasn’t going to do shit. Taking a breath, along with a large gulp of the alcohol, Sirius let his head fall back against the wingbacked chair before the fireplace in the main parlor. The burn was pleasant as it tapered down his throat and pooled in his belly, a welcome distraction.</p><p>A younger Sirius would have drowned himself in the drink to numb himself to the pain.</p><p>Now, he didn’t have that luxury.</p><p>Still a small nap couldn’t hurt, right? He had worked hard all day setting up the house to be more kid friendly, feeding and playing with Harry, and also scouring the child raising books he had sent the elves to purchase the day after Harry had come into his custody. Just as his eyes started to slip closed Sirius felt something crash into the wards.</p><p>Well, crash wasn’t exactly the right word. It was more like a gentle caress, but with how high-strung Sirius had been lately it might as well have been a Graphorn that rammed into him.</p><p>As he surged to his feet, Sirius caught movement from the corner of his eye in the hall, that wretched little… Kreacher was already to the door and had it opened by the time that Sirius managed to get into the main hall, courtesy of him first tripping over the ottoman that <em>just happened</em> to be in his path. Stupid house elf magic.</p><p>Two darkly cloaked figures drifted gracefully into the foyer. From their appearance, Sirius knew they were male and the only thing that was stopping him from blasting them was the lack of Deatheater masks.</p><p>That and the pale hand held out towards him was graced with a ring that bore the house of Black’s crest.</p><p>“Drop the hoods, now.” The order was given with a growl, Sirius keep his wand trained between the two, an incantation constantly rolling about his head ready to he used.</p><p>The strangers glanced subtly at each other and Sirius’s nose twitched, “Hurry up, I know it’s you, Reg. Who did you drag in with you?”</p><p>This time there was no hesitation from the shorter figure on the right, the hood falling to reveal a face that echoed so much of Sirius’s own. The Black brothers were very similar in appearance, though Regulus wore his hair shorter, was a little smaller and slighter in build, and was the younger of the two. Despite his brother’s foolish decision to become a Deatheater, Sirius knew that he wasn’t a threat to him. He was relieved to see that Regulus seemed to be in relatively good health as well. The last time Sirius had seen his brother was after a literally explosive argument between them about Regulus taking that bastard’s mark a couple years ago.</p><p>So that left the other man.</p><p>“You already know me.” The unknown male answered in lieu of revealing his face, Sirius couldn’t help balking at the familiar voice.</p><p>“Sn-Snivellus?”</p><p>Severus Snape and Regulus Black had been close friends since the younger had entered Hogwarts a year after Sirius did. So it wasn’t that surprising that the two continued to be so now. Sirius had heard more than a few rumors that Snape had become a Deatheater soon after he graduated as well.</p><p> Everyone knew why Voldemort had wanted the scrawny snake despite the whispers that Snape was a half-blood. He had become the youngest potions master in history. Snape wasn’t just good at potions though, Sirius had to begrudgingly admit he was brilliant in almost all subjects and was known to have invented many of his own spells.</p><p>A number of which Sirius and his gang had found themselves on the other end of in retaliation for their harassment of him.</p><p>“Black, I see you have not yet raised yourself above childish name calling.” Snape answered while crossing his arms, a defensive gesture that allowed Sirius to see the wand clasped in his hand. It was unlikely that he would let go of it while in the presence of his former tormentor.</p><p>Whatever witty comeback Sirius’s mind tried to make was stopped by his brother’s soft admonishment.</p><p>“It’s Lord Black, Severus.”</p><p>“L-Lord?” Was all Sirius could croak out as Regulus strode a few steps closer before dropping to one knee before him, his dark robes flurrying gracefully around him. Kreacher’s keen of disapproval was ignored by all.</p><p>Head bowed forward to almost touch the floor, Regulus spoke, “I, Regulus Arcturus Black, of sound mind and magic strong, hereby recognize Sirius Orion Black as being worthy of the title Lord Black. I am his to cherish, protect, punish, and guide through all matters that may reflect on my most noble and ancient house, one of the sacred twenty-eight. May his enemies be my enemies and my joy be one with his. Lead us to glory and protect what is ours. <em>Toujours Pur.</em> So mote it be.”</p><p> Swallowing down his shock, Sirius was surprised by how his body seemed to already be moving to perform the next step. His hand summoning the wand, one 15 and a quarter inches of Aspen, heartstring of a Hebridean Black, and springy, which he used for dark magic from its holster on his left arm as he commanded.</p><p> “Raise thy head and bear thy heart.”</p><p>Regulus did so, eyes closed and unflinching even as Sirius set the tip of his wand over his heart. It would just take one surge of magic into the thumping muscle to damage it beyond repair and send one into immediate cardiac arrest.</p><p>Instead a gentle flow trickled out of his wand and Regulus’s own crept out of his magical core to meet his. The magics swirled around each other, seeming to be delighted in the familiarity of each other.</p><p>Both born of darkness and Black.</p><p>“I, Sirius Orion Black, hereby claim the title of lordship of the most ancient and noble house of Black, one of the sacred twenty-eight, from this moment on till I draw my dying breath. I take upon mineself the responsibility of its magicks, members, history, and possessions. They are all mine to protect and cherish, should I fail in this duty then let the family magicks strike me down. I recognize one, Regulus Arcturus Black, as mine heir until one of my blood reaches of age and decides to take the title by his own choice. <em>Toujours Pur.</em> So mote it be.”</p><p align="center">

</p><p>The magic in the air hummed and visibly shuttered before it swirled into solid, but partly transparent, shapes. Three black ravens hovered in the air, the one in the center of which clasped a skull in its talons. Their small dark eyes and the endless eye sockets of the skull seemed to bore into and through Sirius.</p><p>They were judging him. They, the symbols of the Black’s crest, would decide if he was worthy of being the head of the family.</p><p>Then two more shapes burst forth from the combination of Black family magic.</p><p>Sirius was certain that he caught Snape’s sharp intake of breath and silently cursed. He didn’t want someone outside of the family to see something so personal and in so many ways, damning. There was little he could do about it however as they observed the newest additions, just as ghostly as those of the crest, but much more intimidating.</p><p>The clicks of claws attached to eight paws echoed in the silence of the room, a pair of bear-sized, black, spectral dogs circled the brothers. Their sharp teeth were a gleaming white that clashed with the inkiness of slightly shaggy hair. Eerie yellow orbs which glowed with intelligence and lust for blood stayed locked on the Blacks.</p><p>Grims. Like many ancient dark families, the Blacks had magical creature blood flowing through their veins that further strengthened their magic and bodies. Many wizards and witches could summon forth aspects of their ancestral creatures if desperate, some even being able to take the shape of them. However, this did come at a cost, when a magical child came into their inheritance they would have to battle to maintain their human mind or give into the beast.</p><p>This was another reason some dark magic users went mad. Sirius had been lucky with having already mostly reconciled with his family by the time he came into his magical inheritance. He probably wouldn’t have been able to handle the transformation on his own and would have been written off by the public as another Black falling prey to the ‘<em>curse</em>’.</p><p>Sirius incidentally had been able to pass off his Grim form for that of an Animagus transformation to his friends. Grims were creatures of folklore after all, no one would expect them to be real or standing before them playing fetch with a werewolf.</p><p>If the Ministry or the rest of the magical world found out about the mixture of creature blood and humans, there would be chaos and bloodshed. The dark families would be seen as a crime against nature and dangerous. Many times, in both the past and present, proved that humanity would rather destroy what was different than try to understand or give chances to it. Dark families didn’t go spreading what their creature ancestry was around in their own circles either, it was far better to keep both strengths and weaknesses hidden to avoid a double-cross.</p><p>That wasn’t important now though, at the moment all Sirius could afford to care about was the spectral forms of magic’s decision.</p><p>The wait was tense, and four hearts pounded with anticipation of the result.</p><p>If the specters found Sirius unworthy, the results could vary, but none of them were pleasant. The manifestations of magic could rip him to bloody pieces, the Black magic at home in his body could be ousted from him and leave his magical core crippled, his mind may be fractured by the upheaval of ancestral bonds that had been inside him since birth.</p><p>There was a reason why declarations of new heads of families was so often delayed, no one wanted to risk an unpleasant result until they were certain that the heir was ready. Sirius didn’t think he was suited to be a lord, but the ritual had sucked him in the moment that Regulus had knelt before him and started the ancient process.</p><p>The hounds finally let out twin howls. Then as one, the ravens threw back their heads to let out a melodious, yet haunting cry that could rival any Augurey. The skull seemed to smile as not only the wand Sirius held to his brother’s chest, but the other two wands on his person glowed so brightly that the light radiating from them pierced through layers of cloth to reveal their hiding places. Then the apparitions were gone and Sirius staggered as the weight of the family magic and images that were the memories of his ancestors cycled through his mind. The magic that had always been present in Sirius seemed to grow ten times heavier. He was relieved by the fact that it was not an uncomfortable feeling.</p><p>A lord, Sirius blinked before groaning and putting his head in his hands as he took as few steps back from his brother, allowing Regulus to rise.</p><p>“<em>Bloody hell.</em> Why did you do that?!”</p><p>Regulus met his brother’s tantrum with patience, but he couldn’t allow Sirius to take too much time. They were quickly running out of it as it was. Still he was curious and repeated. “’<em>Mine heir’</em>?”</p><p>“Not important. Tell me why you just fucking pushed me into lordship and are here. I don’t want Deatheaters in my home.” Sirius snapped back, he didn’t want the two to know that the cause of their lord’s defeat was taking a nap upstairs.</p><p>“The Dark Lord is no more, it might surprise you, but many of us are glad for that fact. However, the mess he left in his wake is almost as disastrous if not more so than if he was still around. No matter what choice you make tonight, you will need the power and prestige that comes with being a lord to survive.” Regulus answered, tone turning grave as stepped around his brother and started down the hall.</p><p>“Tonight? What are you talking about?” Sirius demanded, mind reeling at the fact that his brother just admitted that he didn’t agree with Voldemort’s philosophies. If Snape was here that meant that the dour man was probably of the same mindset.</p><p>If Regulus was to be believed, many of the Deatheaters were gladdened by his downfall. But his brother’s words were, at the same time, cryptic and far from comforting.</p><p>“You’re wasting your breath with subtleties, Regulus. It’s obvious by how encompassing those wards were that Bl-, <em>Lord Black</em>, hasn’t been in contact with the outside world for some time.” Snape’s still hidden face turned towards him. “Am I correct?”</p><p>“I-I’ve been busy.”</p><p>Siriurs could practically hear Snape rolling his eyes in answer, before he reached into a moleskin pouch by his side and pulled forth several copies of the Daily Prophet. The top one unfolded to reveal a moving picture of several darkly clad figures fleeing from a burning manor.</p><p>It was the headline though that made Sirius feel sick. <em><u>“The Hunt of Dark Witches and Wizards continues, the Ministry Promises the eradication of all traces of He-Who-Must-Not-Name’s Evil. More on the Aurors’ raids on homes of suspected sympathizers on page 2...”</u></em></p><p>“Sympathizers.” Sirius echoed, tone broken, and Snape handed over the stack with a small shake of his head.</p><p>“I see you are finally connecting the dots. Both the general public and the Ministry is on a lynching spree targeting the families of anyone that has ever been whispered about having practiced Dark magic.”</p><p>A bitter laugh escaped Sirius, “A literal witch hunt.”</p><p>“Several of the Malfoy’s homes have already been burned down, the main manor fell last night, but by the time the mob and Aurors got in, all they found was a barren mansion. All artifacts, portraits, living creatures, and furniture gone.” Snape explained, his tone trailing off as he glided down the hall after Regulus. Sirius followed while flicking through the papers.</p><p>“Where did they go?” The question was off Sirius’s tongue before he could stop himself and the next moment he was slammed against the nearest wall, a pale hand wrapped around his throat and nails biting into his skin.</p><p>“Why would I <em>ever</em> tell you that? Planning on turning them in to save your own hide and your precious Auror position?” Snape’s voice came out as a soft hiss and despite them being around the same height, the potions master seemed to have no difficulty keeping Sirius pinned.</p><p>That is until Sirius rocketed forward and smacked their foreheads together. Snape dropped Sirius in surprise and pain as he stumbled backwards, hood falling down as a result. Sirius had his legs bunched under him, ready to launch himself at the Slytherin. Eager for a outlet to release all the stress he had pent up inside of him. What he saw stopped him cold.</p><p>The face that greeted him wasn’t the Snivellus that he remembered.</p><p>Gone was the waxy pallor of his skin, his long, inky hair was mused by the hood, but it wasn’t greasy. It seemed that with age Snape had grown into his nose, it no longer seemed overly large and the hook of it now appeared more aristocratic. The only thing that hadn’t change in the Slytherin’s face was his eyes, still two pitch voids filled with fire and passion that seemed so at odds with his usual stoic expression or sneers.</p><p>No, Sirius could no longer say that his past victim was ugly. If anything, Severus Snape looked handsome or even beautiful with his pale skin matching his dark features. The only flaw that Snape had was the red blotch on his forehead that was a result of their heads clashing together. And, of course, all Sirius could do to express these thoughts was utter a very elegant.</p><p>“Wha?”</p><p>“Inheritance.” Snape answered shortly, though he didn’t offer any more information other than that, but he didn’t pull his hood back up either.</p><p>A part of Sirius, which he was desperately trying to ignore, appreciated this fact.</p><p>They stared at each other awkwardly before the sound of a heavy door opening down the hall drew their attention. Snape glanced between the hall and the still crouched new Lord Black before sneering and hurrying towards the source of the noise.</p><p>Seeing no other choice, Sirius followed and found the two Slytherins inside the massive House of Black library. Several trunks sat open on the floor, both Regulus and Snape were levitating and shrinking large stacks of tomes before sending them into one of the many expanded drawers in the trunks. Kreacher was also bustling about, though he looked torn between being happy to help and lamenting the pride of the Black’s being so hastily packed away.</p><p align="center"><img src="http://www.fcc.chalmers.se/mediadir/2014/09/publications-publications_gimped-900x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="100" data-pagespeed-url-hash="3272685101" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);" data-pagespeed-url-hash="3272685101" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/> </p><p>The two former Deatheaters worked in a quick tandem together and it only took a few moments for Sirius to realize their goal. They were removing certain books. Titles flew past his eyes that he recognized as having been forced to study from them under his parents’ watch. It seemed that any volume that dealt even slightly with dark magic or ideals was being packed away.</p><p>It appeared that the two were happy to ignore Sirius’s existence and his glare was not producing any reaction nor providing answers. There was a hint of desperation in how fast they were working, and with how well Slytherins were known for hiding their emotions that meant the pair were, in reality, very close to panicking. Sirius was never good at waiting or being patient though, so called as he crossed his arms over his chest and leaned back against one of the bookcases. “I don’t think I gave you permission to remove my property, little brother.”</p><p>The words made the younger Black freeze, the books he was controlling shaking slightly in the air before looking over his shoulder at his brother. Seeing the mulish expression on Sirius’s face made him sigh, “I’m sorry, Lord Bla-“</p><p>“Cut the crap and don’t call me that. Just tell me what exactly your planning. I don’t see you for years and suddenly you appear on my doorstep dragging Snape of all people with you, declaring me your lord, saying dark wizards are being hunted, hinting that there’s this big decision I have to make, but you’re still leaving a lot of blaring holes for me here.” Sirius growled, the unnatural sound making Snape’s wand twitch and a book to fall from his own spelled load.</p><p> “We’re short on time.” Snape muttered still not pausing in his own work.</p><p>“Then move and talk, you should be able to do two things at once, right?”</p><p>Regulus winced as the growing frustration and annoyance around Sirius was becoming palpable. It was better to start talking before Sirius got worked up further, they should have expected as much with the circumstances. “Right then, so you now know that the Ministry is planning on either sending entire families that are rumored to be dark to Azkaban, giving them the dementor’s kiss, or having them conveniently <em>disappear</em>.”</p><p>Sirius opened his mouth to protest the fact that the Ministry would go so far but shut it just as quickly. He knew personally how deep the fear and corruption ran in the government. Sirius was a dark wizard, and while he was a member of the Order of the Phoenix, his true ideals differed quite a lot from the others in the group. Sirius didn't endorse the idea that muggles and magical folk should intermingle in the slightest. Sure, muggles might have a few cool inventions like motorcycles, but not enough for him to want to abandon all of the traditions that he had grown up with just to make muggleborns more comfortable. Muggleborns and halfbloods, Sirius had no issue with them besides their desire to change and expose their world, along with how they dragged in with them their own fairy tales that further demonized dark magic and creatures. Sirius didn't believe in killing muggles though, which was the main reasons he fought. He could understand the appeal of what the Dark Lord had been offering.</p><p>In the early years, Voldemort had gathered his supporters by making promises of no longer having to hide their dark magic, being able to prove their worth to society, protecting old traditions, and keeping the magical world safe from muggles that would kill them.</p><p>Neutral and light members of the Wizenagot would be more than happy to see the dark side of the law-making house disappear to get more power for themselves.</p><p>“Well, since society wants us gone, we’ve decided to do the work for them. An agreement has been made by dark and darker grey families to disappear. If this world doesn’t want us…” Severus murmured, fondly stroking the spine of a book that Sirius had almost lost a finger a couple years ago to.</p><p>“Morgana’s children will make a new one.” Regulus finished, voice now stronger and grey eyes sparking with determination.</p><p>“But that’s it? You’re all just planning on disappearing, tucking your tails and running for the hills?” Sirius demanded in disgust, “Why not stay and fight? You know prove-”</p><p>“Prove what exactly, Black?” Snape snarled, “Use that insufferably inactive grey matter between your ears for once. A large number of us bare the dark mark, faded as it now may be. Do you really think that we will be forgiven? That it will matter that we were tricked into or had no choice but to enter his service?</p><p>“No, don’t delude yourself. This powder keg of hostility is about to explode, just like it has done so many times in the past and our numbers will be whittled down even more. Possibly down to nothing this time.” </p><p>“Not again, that’s what the coven has decided.” Regulus murmured, grey eyes locking with his brother’s as he lowered his wand in favor of fully focusing on the conversation.</p><p>“All of the brats of dark families are currently being portkeyed and snuck out of Hogwarts as we speak. All those whose magic is of shadows will disappear tonight.” Severus added, sighing softly as secretly worry for the young ones gripped his heart.</p><p>Sirius felt his head spin, where was the cold-hearted bastard from school?</p><p>“How?” Sirius finally croaked, were dark wizards attacking Hogwarts now or was the Ministry descending upon the sacred halls to try and take hostages against families?</p><p>“Parents have been sending untraceable portkeys through the mail, Flitwick and Slughorn have been secretly handing them out as well to get them out. The ghosts know of many secret passageways out of the castle and are taking some of the children through those.” Snape muttered, silently he was glad that the old potions’ professor had finally decided on a side and knew how desperately they would need another brewer if they were going to be cut away from most medical resources.</p><p>Slughorn was a dark wizard just like most of his family had been and while many claimed that he didn’t take care of his Slytherins that would be a lie. He just couldn’t appear to be too involved with them in the public eye, if he did suspicions would not doubt have been raised long ago. Still Snape could brew circles around the old man any day. Flitwick had goblin ancestry and while he was a world renowned dueling champion, there was still discrimination aimed towards the tiny professor. Flitwick often secretly oversaw students going through creature inheritance if it took place in Hogwarts and an excuse or glamour was needed to hide the changes.</p><p>“What about Dumbledore? Surely he would know something of such a mass scale going on.”</p><p>“The headmaster is currently away because of a raid going on in Diagon Alley.” Snape’s mouth turned up slightly in amusement as Sirius paled.</p><p>“Stop worrying him, Severus,” Regulus chastised, getting a roll of fathomless dark eyes for his efforts.</p><p>“The raid’s aim isn’t to kill, just to create a distraction.”</p><p>“No, no,” Severus agreed with a cruel twist of his mouth. “Though the theft from all the apothecaries, fabric, book, and other stores for resources is a bonus. More than two thirds of Knockturn Alley had already been cleared out the first week after the Dark Lord’s fall.”</p><p>“You’re all going to have to start from scratch.” Sirius observed, surprised to find himself sending a silent prayer to the gods that no one on either side would be harmed in the supply raid.</p><p>“I wouldn’t say that exactly. Many of the coven have been able to flee with all of their possessions and with the wonders of shrinking charms and house elf magic, we currently have enough to sustain us for at least a decade.” Regulus wagered, eyes darting to Severus for confirmation which was given with a nod. </p><p>“Where would you go? That many people, it’d be difficult to stay hidden.” With magic, Sirius knew nothing was impossible, but he found himself scratching his head for what crazy, but logical solution the coven could have come up with.</p><p>“Black,” Snape released a long sigh, like the conversation was physically paining him as he pinched his hooked nose between his fingers, “Where are we right now?”</p><p>“In Grimmuald Place.”</p><p>Severus nodded his head, making a show like he was being exceedingly patient. “And how easily can it be found or come to be known by others?”</p><p>“Not very, it’s under <em>Fildelius</em>.”</p><p>“Indeed. Now how many properties does the Black family own? Public records state that it is six, I know of eight and I consider myself close to the family.”</p><p>Regulus was the one to answer. “We have double that, twelve properties and many of them manors in the countryside with acers of land, all hidden, in stasis, and covered in repelling charms for both muggles and magical folk, along with being under <em>Fildelius</em>.”</p><p>“Now imagine all the pureblood and wealthy families who are fleeing with us, their pastures, greenhouses, homes, and land will all be put under <em>Fildelius</em> if it is not already so. If you calculate how much larger England is with all the hidden areas, the land mass of our islands would grow by more than a third.”</p><p>“All together you might just add up to a small country.” Sirius was in awe, jaw dropping only to click shut when Kreacher made an offending motion to his chin. It wasn’t worth the effort though as Severus continued, tone completely unapologetic for upending the Lord of Black’s mind. “Lucius spoke with Gringotts as well, the Goblins have always been neutral and declared that they would continue to be so. They swore their loyalty to their customers and have agreed to find a way to make the vaults and bank accessible to dark families.”</p><p>“They won’t let the Ministry touch anything that doesn’t belong to them unless they want to start another war. Dark families have always had a closer standing with the goblin nation.” Regulus’s tone was becoming more and more excited, his eyes shimmering as he took a step closer to Sirius.</p><p>“You really thought of it all.”</p><p>“Yes, most things are settled, there is only one uncertain variable left.” Snape mused, finally putting his book down and turning to face his old tormentor fully.</p><p>Sirius swallowed as he noticed the way that the potions master folded his arms over his chest, a position that would make drawing his wand quickly easy.</p><p>“Me, right?”</p><p>“Bravo, you do have something upstairs after all.”</p><p>“Shut up, Snivellus Snape. That’s no way to speak to a lord.”</p><p>“You are not <em>my </em>lord. I refuse to be called by that foul man’s name any longer, I am the child of Eileen Prince which makes me-“</p><p>“The half-blood Prince, they said the last of the line died out three years ago,” Sirius’s eyes were wide. He wanted to deny the other’s claim, to keep hold of something that would finally make the sour man respect him. However, now there was no mistaking where those dark bottomless eyes came from. The eyes of a Prince.</p><p>“Indeed, I am the Lord of the most ancient and noble house of Prince.” Severus’s smile was nasty, full of triumph and pride, but Sirius found that he liked it. Unfortunately, he was forced to look away to take in the lordship ring that sat on one of the man’s long pale fingers.</p><p> “Can we please refocus, yes, we are all special lords, now let’s move on to the matter at hand,” Regulus hissed, obviously fed up with the pissing contest that had been going on between the two older males since they had first met. Sirius looked belligerent, but fell silent. Severus also quieted, though he shoved the book he was holding into the trunk with unnecessary strength and noise to show his displeasure at his rare chance for gloating being interrupted.</p><p>Regulus rubbed his temples with a sigh, still he knew that he should be thankful that no hexes had been thrown yet. “Now, Sirius, you have two options, regardless of your choice, we must remove as many traces of dark magic as we can from here. So, the books, artifacts and such will be coming with Severus and I unless you want to explain their existence to the Ministry that would send you to Azkaban for just knowing about them regardless of your <em>record</em>.</p><p>“One, you can decide to stay and take your chances continuing to pretend to be a light wizard. If you do so, we can could obliviate you and implant a false memory into your mind of us battling and declaring to hate all things dark… <em>again</em>. That should hold under any uses of vertisum.”</p><p>Sirius was starting to feel sick as he realized what the second choice was before Regulus even continued.</p><p>“The other is that you <em>come with us</em>.” </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Hello everyone, hope you enjoyed the first chapter of this new story. I've loved the Harry Potter series for so long, but this is my first attempt at actually writing something for it. This story idea has been stuck in my mind for the past month and I decided that I finally had to start writing it down.</p><p>I have been interested in Harry Potter works that explore the darker side of the magical world and the lore behind it. Such stories are in short supply I feel and I thought I would take my own crack at it. I plan on exploring more dark themes and ideals in the future chapters, dissecting the mindsets of people on both sides of the line. I'd love to ping ideas against someone and if you want, I'd be open to chat. Please comment, it always makes my day.</p>
