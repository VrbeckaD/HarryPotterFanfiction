Teddy asked with a laugh.</p><p>"I remember how you used to call me dad when you wanted something. Once you found out more about Remus, you stopped." Harry laughed lightly, "He would be happy for you."</p><p>"I would hope so." Teddy watched James from across the room. "I always considered you my dad even if you were not really my dad. It was same with Ginny, she was mom to me."</p><p>"And now we really are, in a way."</p><p>"Don't get me wrong. I love my parents, they were brave and I wish I knew them but-"</p><p>James came over to were they were sitting, "Teds, you can't sit here with dad all night. We have to show off." </p><p>"Of course. I am sorry." He gave Jamie a peck before turning to leave, "See you around dad."</p></div>
