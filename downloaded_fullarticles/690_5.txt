    <p>Sirius hadn’t exactly <em> planned </em>to be sitting on a hospital cot on Christmas Eve of all days. It’s 10pm, close to 11, even, and he’s got eggnog and Love, Actually waiting for him at home. The last thing he really wants is to be stuck in hospital right now.</p>
<p>It’s all James’s fault, really. He was the one that insisted to get Sirius to hospital; Sirius feels <em> fine, </em>thank you very much. Sadly, James tends to be as worrisome as their mum, so he shoved Sirius out of the flat and drove him to the damn hospital. Sirius thinks it’s a waste of time, both his and whatever unfortunate doctor is there to check on his leg.</p>
<p>“Sorry for the wait. Hospitals get a fair share of our own Christmas rush, and there’s not many staff members around.”</p>
<p>Sirius turns to look at the doctor that’s just entered the room.</p>
<p>
  <em> Holy shit.  </em>
</p>
<p>The man looks young, Sirius’s age even - way too damn young to be a doctor, but if Sirius is about to be scammed, he <em> really </em> doesn’t mind. His brown curls are resting on his forehead, almost touching his eyes, with gold and ginger highlights whenever the light hits the man’s head. His face is covered with small freckles and a few scars, or as much Sirius can see them behind thickly framed glasses he’s wearing. He has a warm yet shy smile that makes Sirius’s stomach flip a couple times. <em> And </em>he’s wearing a festive shirt under his white coat.</p>
<p>Long story short, he’s <em> exactly </em>Sirius’s type, and Sirius feels he might be in love already.</p>
<p>“So, what brings you here on Christmas Eve,” the man looks down at the small pad he’s holding. “Mr. Black?”</p>
<p>“Oh, please. Mr. Black was my father, and he wasn’t the most pleasant of men. It’s Sirius. Like the star.”</p>
<p>His lips curve in a smile. “Well then, Sirius,” hearing the man say his name makes Sirius’s heart beat twice as fast. He’s lost to the world already. He could die happy now. “What seems to be the problem?”</p>
<p>“Uhm, my ankle? Or leg, in general. I don’t think anything’s wrong, but my brother insisted I get it checked.”</p>
<p>“And what happened to it?” </p>
<p>Sirius feels his cheeks redden. “I, uhm… I was walking through my flat and I guess… I tripped. On my feet.”</p>
<p>Sirius can clearly see the man is trying his hardest not to laugh. “That’s… unfortunate. Let’s take a look at the damage you did to it.”</p>
<p>All throughout the examination, Sirius shamelessly stared at the man - R. Lupin, his badge said - working, and hoped he’s not as obvious as he thinks he is. Or maybe he should be very obvious. Sirius doubts someone as breathtaking - and smart, because <em> hello, he’s a doctor - </em> as Lupin could possibly be into men, because Sirius is never that lucky; but what he <em> is, </em>is stupidly shameless and straightforward, so he has every intention of finding out. </p>
<p>“Seems like everything is fine,” Lupin says, letting Sirius roll down the cuff of his jeans.</p>
<p>“You’re awfully young for a doctor, Dr Lupin,” Sirius answers instead, casually leaning back on the cot. </p>
<p>Lupin smiles. “Oh, no, I’m not a doctor yet. I’m in med school, still. Just here for work experience. And it’s Remus.”</p>
<p>
  <em> Remus Black wouldn’t sound too bad… </em>
</p>
<p>“On Christmas Eve, of all days?”</p>
<p>“Someone has to be,” Remus smiles at him. “We get quite a few people tripping over their own feet.”</p>
<p>
  <em> And he’s witty. It’s meant to be. </em>
</p>
<p><em> Here goes nothing. </em>“I would promise it won’t happen again, but I don’t mind breaking a leg just to see you again.”</p>
<p>Remus looks taken aback for a moment, and Sirius is about to mumble an apology and hurry out, but then the man scribbles something down on his pad, rips a small piece of paper out of it, and hands it to Sirius.</p>
<p>“You can just call me instead, no need to break any bones. It’d quite like to have you in working condition,” Remus says, and winks - <em> winks - </em>and then he’s out of the room.</p>
<p>Sirius is out of the room in no time, meeting James in the waiting area.</p>
<p>“Let me just say,” Sirius says to him before James can bombard him with ‘are you okay’s. “Taking me here was the best idea you’ve ever had.”</p>
<p>“What? Was there something wrong with your leg?!”</p>
<p>“No, it’s all good, just like I told you,” Sirius grins at him. “But I landed myself a date with a hot med student.”</p>
