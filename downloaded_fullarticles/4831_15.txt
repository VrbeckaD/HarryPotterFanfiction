          <div class="userstuff"><p>When Harry finally gets around to voicing his thoughts on Lorcan and Lysander Scamander they’ve already been around for almost two months.</p><p>It’s wet and windy outside the Lovegood-Scamander residence, the boys are asleep, Rolf is out, and Harry is on his third cup of plimpy tea. It's grown on him since the war.</p><p>“You didn't name them after anyone?”</p><p>Luna, as he’d expected, wasn’t the least confused by the sudden question, or confused about what he meant. She smiles sadly before she answers.</p><p>“My dad was always my hero but I think to everyone else he was mad at best, and at worst someone who betrayed you. I didn't want to put that on my children.”</p><p>Harry tries not to focus on her last sentence but the guilty feelings have been there for a while now. “He didn't betray me.”</p><p>Luna laughs. “Oh Harry, of course he did. He just didn't do it to betray you; I don't think he even thought about you.”</p><p>Xenophilius Lovegood, like Lily Potter before him, and Narcissa Malfoy after, hadn’t considered the rest of the world when dealing with the safety of his child.</p><p>Harry changed the subject back.</p><p>“You never said anything before, about names.”</p><p>“Well that wasn't anything to do with me, was it?”</p><p>Harry knows she isn’t trying to make him feel guilty, just as he knows she doesn’t judge him for his parenting but even so, there’s a faint air of disapproval in the space between them.</p><p>They sit in silence for the rest of their drinks, Harry stewing in guilt and wondering if he did right by his children. There were a lot of sins to the names of Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape, and to a lesser extent James Potter and Sirius Black. Lily should be ok but then again…real people weren’t saints, no matter how many people were in love with them.</p><p>“And anyway,” Luna says smilingly, putting away the teacups. "It's a rather silly name, isn't it? Xenophilius."</p></div>
