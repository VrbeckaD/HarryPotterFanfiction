    <p>Draco looked at his reflection in the mirror for the tenth time that evening. Potter had asked him out nearly every week for the past year, and Draco had made one excuse after another. Now, he'd finally agreed. </p><p>Potter was persistent, after all. </p><p>Even though Draco didn't think it was a good idea, he'd agreed because he'd figured if he said yes, Potter would stop bothering him. Their plans were simple. Dinner. </p><p>Then, Draco would go back to ignoring Potter for the year, and his life would simply go back to normal. </p><p>No harm, no foul. </p><p>When he checked his watch, he was surprised to find out that it was quarter to seven o'clock. Draco hadn't paid attention to the time and Potter was fifteen minutes late. </p><p>Was this some sort of a trick? Did Potter think he could simply make Draco wait and he'd be okay with it? Of course, Draco hadn't realised how time had passed by but still, late was late. Draco huffed and checked on his reflection again. Maybe his favourite grey tie wasn't a good idea. He didn't want to dress the best for Potter. Not if he was going to be late! </p><p>Panic started to set in when Potter was an hour behind schedule.</p>
