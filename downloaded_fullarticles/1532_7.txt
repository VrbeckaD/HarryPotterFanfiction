    <p> »Keep close to me, Knockturn Alley is not like Allée Noir, [Black Alley,]« Eto says as they walk down the narrow, dark alley. Disgusting Wizarding people with cloaks watch them as they walk by, clinging to the shadows. Many throw glances and shy away at Eto’s mask, as she chose to show her real face.</p><p>Eto had forgone Eeylops Owl Emporium, the Veela Alfā finding the Familiars ill suited. They enter a dingy looking shop, the shopkeeper scuttling towards them, baring his yellow teeth. That grin falters when he sees Eto. The Beta bows low, almost in half.</p><p>“How may I be of service, my Lady?” Eto narrows her glaring eye at the lowly filth.</p><p>“You and I zhall wait,” Eto orders.</p><p>“Go,” Eto gently pushes Hermione to the cages. She nods, looking the Beta up and down distastefully. She walks further into the store, eyes wandering the ceiling high aisles made of cages filled with dozens of creatures. Closing her eyes, Hermione lets her other senses heighten. She starts walking, letting instinct guide her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Her magic hums, and she stops, opening her eyes. In a dark corner, barely fitted into its cage, is a bird. Her eyes glance down at the label.</p><p>
  <em>Lammergeier.</em>
</p><p>It’s huge, with a thick and powerful neck, the beak wicked sharp and deadly. It’s eyes, are what draw Hermione in; the right dark green, and the left dark blue. The Lammergeier is covered in scars, testaments to its prowess and survival.</p><p>Hermione’s magic reaches out to the bird’s, the Lammergeier rearing and puffing up as much as it can. It’s scream-like whistle silences everything in the shop. Grinning, she opens the cage, holding out an arm. It leaps out, stretching tall to it’s impressive height of one-hundred-twenty-two centimeters. She’s seen this bird before, but it was made of her golden magic.</p><p>Unfurling its two-point-eighty meter wingspan, it scream-whistles victory again. Hermione hears the shopkeeper yelping in pain. Her heart is beating so fast, adrenaline pumping through her as she struggles to hold up the magnificent creature. If Hermione is hazard to guess, she’d say that the Lammergeier weighs seven-point-eight kilograms.</p><p>The Lammergeier shuffles its wings, flapping hardas it climbs onto her shoulders. Hermione turns to face Eto and the shopkeeper, the Lammergeier’s weight balanced with it’s one-point-twenty-five body length, the wedge-shaped tail alone is fifty-five centimeters. The Lammergeier shifts, his large feet and lethally sharp talons never hurting her.</p><p>Eto grins, clearly pleased with Hermione’s choice. The Lammergeier lowers its small head down to Hermione’s eye level. She strokes its neck.</p><p>“This is the one.”</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Lying on her bed, Hermione takes off the sound-dampening blanket from the Lammergeier’s new cage. Eto placed a <em>Feather-light Charm</em> on it. Opening the cage, the Lammergeier flies out, circling her room, then lands on her bed. The plumage on its head, neck, breast, and legs are various darker shades of rusty-red, deep-orange, pale-white, and dark-gold.</p><p>Its back, wings, and tail are mostly dark-grey, grey-blue, and black colors, with only the topside of the wings bearing striped and spotted patterns. It waddles towards her, lowering his head, its buff breast feathers brushing the bed. She strokes it. Its forehead is creamy-white, a black band across its eyes diagonally downwards and bristles under and past the chin in a “beard”.</p><p>The Lammergeier pushes against her fingers, silently demanding more attention. It shuffles forwards, its long leg feathers fluffing up. She strokes its throat, and it whistles in a croon. She can feel her magic linking with him, and his intelligent heterochromia eyes stare at her.</p><p>*What is your name?* she trills, and it gently brushes some stray hair out of her face.</p><p>*I am Err’sh, who are you, Cage-Breaker?* He whistles softly.</p><p>*Hermione Mendonica.*</p><p>He nods, cocking his head.</p><p>*You speak Twishity like one of us, Hermione Cage-Breaker.*</p><p>She nods, and he nuzzles her, hopping onto her lap.</p><p>*I suppose I am.*</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Eto Side-Apparates Hermione and Elise to Platform Nine-and-Three-Quarters, bypassing the barrier in King’s Station. She didn’t realize how <em>loud</em> everything would be; with children running around and parents calling out to one another. Even the mass of scents has Hermione stepping back against Eto. The Veela Alfā steadies her, her eye—eyes—sweeping around them.</p><p>Elise, however, is quite comfortable, smiling, chattering about nonsense. Hermione clutches her trunk with Err’sh’s cage lashed to it close to her, keeping her grounded. Err’sh is settled on her shoulders, his feathers fluffed as he dozes, his head on hers. She’s just glad that he doesn’t wrinkle her Hogwarts uniform.</p><p>Emulating Eto, Hermione casts her eyes about the crowds around them, when they find that silver-blond Omega. The crowds part a bit, revealing the pair from Diagon Alley, a third completing the set. The young wizard turns his head, his platinum-blond hair sleeked back against his head. Silver-grey eyes lock with amber-brown.</p><p>His Omega mother looks at Hermione, flicking up to Eto’s stare. The Omega whispers something to her husband, and the family look away from them. She hears the train before it appears, belching out smoke from the front and it’s scarlet sides gleaming. Hermione stands still as Elise and Eto give her hugs.</p><p>»Play the fools to your stage, Petite Présage, [Little Omen,]« Eto says. Hermione nods. Grabbing her trunk, she boards the train, the young wizard right behind her.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>“I’m Alpha Draco Malfoy, we saw each other in Diagon Alley,” the Alpha drawls, sticking out his hand to shake. Hermione eyes it, taking it slowly. Hermione also leans down to place two customary air-kisses to his cheeks. He smells like apples dipped in caramel. He splutters, his pale face flushing.</p><p>Looking down at him, Hermione notes that she’s a full head and shoulders taller than him. Err’sh cocks his head at Draco’s Golden Eagle-Owl in it’s cage. The Alpha glances at her Familiar.</p><p>“Alpha Hermione Mendonica,” Hermione says, staring hard at him, and he blushes under her gaze.</p><p>“A-alright then, do you want to find a compartment?” He stutters, offering his arm. She takes it, they walk down the corridor. Draco doesn’t move out of the way of the other students, making them move around his trunk and his owl cage. Many students stare at her and Err’sh.</p><p>After passing a few full compartments, they find one with a single wizard in it. Hermione enters first, Draco sliding it open for her. It’s the other Alpha boy from Madam Malkin’s. Hermione puts her trunk and Err’sh cage on the luggage rack, and sits opposite of the wizard, taking out her <em>Hogwarts, a History</em>. His emerald-green eyes narrow on Draco, who sets his owl cage down next to hers.</p><p>Glancing up, she can see the hostility pouring off the two Alpha’s. Setting down her book, Hermione looks the other Alpha up and down. He’s lean, shoulder length black hair sticking out in odd angles. His spectacles make his features more pronounced, and he smells like comforting old wood.</p><p>The Snowy Owl in the cage next to him turns her head towards Hermione, hooting a soft hello.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Potter,” Draco spits.</p><p>“Malfoy,” Potter growls.</p><p>“Mendonica,” Hermione drawls, drawing both the Alpha’s attention. Potter glares at Hermione, who raises an eyebrow at him.</p><p>“Alpha Hermione Mendonica, and you are?” After a beat, she holds out her hand, not really wanting to touch him but British custom demands she do so. Potter eyes it, but takes her hand, shaking it.</p><p>“Alpha Harry Potter—”</p><p>“<em>Halfblood</em> Potter, isn’t your mother a <em>Muggleborn?</em>” Draco cuts in, sneering. Harry glares at Draco. Hermione also gives him a side glance, one that Harry notices.</p><p>“What are you doing here Malfoy? The Slytherin compartments are at the back of the train,” Harry snaps.</p><p>“This is the back of the train, Gryffindor <em>scum,</em>” Draco sneers.</p><p>“Excuse me,” The Alpha’s turn to look at her.</p><p>“Explain how you two know each other?” Hermione orders, her tone authoritative. They glare at each other.</p><p>“The Potters have always been . . . Muggle lovers,” Draco grimaces as Harry’s face tightens in anger.</p><p>“The Malfoys,” Harry snaps.</p><p>“Have always been Pureblood suprematists and Death Eaters—”</p><p>“YOU TAKE THAT BACK!” Draco roars, his wand pointing between Harry’s eyes.</p><p>“MAKE ME!” Harry yells back, his wand aiming at Draco’s heart.</p><p>“Sit <em>down</em>,” she hisses, lashing a ripple of her magic at them. Both Alpha’s fall on their bums, their knees giving out. Err’sh clacks his beak in laughter. She holds her hand out, and the Alpha’s wands fly into her waiting palm. Raising her hand, Err’sh takes the wands in his beak, staring at her.</p><p>Hermione sighs, glaring at the Alpha’s stunned faces.</p><p>“I know that I’m not privy to a lifelong blood feud between your families, but in a regular conversation in a compartment, you talk <em>civilly</em>,” Hermione drawls, and they both lower their heads in submission.</p><p>“That was wandless magic!” Harry points out unnecessarily. Hermione restrains herself from rolling her eyes.</p><p>“Yes Harry. Now, do get your act together before we arrive. I for one don’t fancy dealing with your petty squabbles in Hogwarts,” she glares at them, and they eye the other Alpha.</p><p>“I’ll be keeping these until we arrive, since you two obviously can’t be trusted with them,” Hermione says, grabbing her trunk and Err’sh’s cage, and walks out of the compartment.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione finds another compartment, this time there are only two girls in it. Ignoring their gazes, she sets her luggage on its rack, and sits down with her book open. Err’sh hops off her shoulders onto the seat, settling in for a nap. One of the witches clears her throat, and Hermione looks up.</p><p>“Hello, I’m Beta Daphne Greengrass,” the girl says. Her brilliant grass-green eyes stare at Hermione, her white-blond hair falling around her face softly. She smells like mint peppermint. The other girl smiles neutrally at her.</p><p>“Beta Tracey Nettlebed,” she says. Her fiery-red hair is something that grabs one’s attention, betraying her Irish decent. Her face is freckled, and bright sky-blue eyes seem to dance. It accents her olive skin, and her scent of fresh moss.</p><p>“Alpha Hermione Mendonica, and this is Err’sh,” she says, and both witches’ eyes widen.</p><p>“No way, you’re French?” Tracey asks, leaning in towards Hermione.</p><p>“Yes, I am,” she sighs, and the Beta merely grins.</p><p>“What House do you think you’re gonna be in?” She asks, and Daphne rolls her eyes.</p><p>“I don’t have a preference,” Hermione answers truthfully.</p><p>“Really? I’m going to be a Slytherin, my whole family has been,” Daphne sighs.</p><p>“Better a Slytherin than a stupid Gryffindor, or maybe a wimpy Hufflepuff—”</p><p>“My sister-in-law was a Hufflepuff,” Hermione cuts in sharply, and Tracey blanches, apologizing softly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You really have no preference?” Daphne asks, and Hermione shrugs.</p><p>“Well, if you’re a Slytherin like us, we can all become dark witches together,” Tracey jokes with a wry smile. Hermione frowns at that.</p><p>“Merlin was a Slytherin, and he’s not dark,” she says. Daphne nods slowly.</p><p>“Being Slytherin doesn’t mean dark,” Hermione continues.</p><p>“Yeah? And who else is a good Slytherin?” Tracey snorts.</p><p>“Beta Master Potioneer Andromeda Tonks,” Hermione begins.</p><p>“Beta Professor Septima Vector, Alpha DMLE Head Bellatrix Black, and Alpha Minister Tom Riddle,” her words leave the compartment in heavy silence.</p><p>“We are not defined by our Houses, it’s actually illogical to sort students at eleven, people change too much. Like Omega Peter Pettigrew,” Hermione watches both Beta's nod. It was a global Wizarding scandal; the Gryffindor who tried to kill his best friends for a Death Eater’s Mark. And sentenced for life in Azkaban for it.</p><p>Suddenly the compartment door slams open, a young wizard standing in the doorway, his face red. His light-blue eyes, solid build, and short, disheveled, red hair distinctively marks him as a Weasley. Tracey sneers at him, and Daphne adopts a cold look.</p><p>“What are you doing here, Weasley?” Tracey demands, and the wizard turns to glare at Hermione, faltering a bit when he sees her face.</p><p>“I’m Beta Ron Weasley, and I’m here to tell you to give me back Harry’s wand,” he says snootily. She raises an eyebrow at him. She doubts Harry would send a Beta to do his grunt work.</p><p>“Well then Harry will have to come get it back himself,” she says smoothly, and the door slides shut on Ron’s fingers.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>≠ “We will be in Hogwarts in five minutes time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately,” ≠ a female voice says from the train. Leaving the compartment so that Daphne and Tracey can change, she sees an Albino Mouse, with clean fur and a collar. Crouching, she deftly swipes it up, holding the mouse close to her.</p><p>It squeaks softly, nuzzling into her hands. She coos gently to it, it’s red eyes closing as it pushes itself against her, it’s pink tail wrapping around her fingers. Placing the mouse on her shoulder, it rubs up against her neck, chittering. Going back into the compartment, Err’sh’s gaze locks on the mouse. Hermione taps his beak, and he huffs, dropping the boys’ wands in her hand.</p><p>*I want to find us a good roosting site,* he whistles, and Hermione nods. Unlocking the window, with Err’sh on her arm, she jerks her hand up to give Err’sh some lift as he takes off into the night sky. Daphne and Tracey keep silent throughout it all. As the three of them get off the train, Hermione lets the clear night air settle herself, and stows the wands in one of her robes’ pocket.</p><p>Looking up, she notices that the stars and constellations are different here. The mouse squeaks softly to her, and burrows a little under her shirt collar to keep warm.</p><p>≠ “Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here!” ≠ A giant of a man towers over the students, waving an umbrella.</p><p>“That’s Beta Hagrid, he’s the Keeper of Keys, and Game Keeper of Hogwarts,” Tracey whispers to Hermione, sneering. Draco brushes past them, hearing Tracey and snorts, turning his nose up at the sight of the giant man. When they near the man, Hermione takes a small sniff, immediately slapping her hand over her nose.</p><p>He’s a Half-Giant, a stinky one at that. Hermione looks around to see if anyone else reacts, but it’s only her. The crowd of First years follow Hagrid down a narrow path, to a hidden shore of a huge expanse of lake. Standing with all of the other First years, Hermione’s the tallest one there, the second tallest barely reaching her shoulder.</p><p>Hagrid calls out more orders. Hermione, Daphne, Tracey, and another Beta girl climb into one boat. It launches off, giving them a stellar view of Hogwarts atop the steep drop of a cliffside plateau at night. Hermione’s impressed despite herself. At the Boathouse, they get off, walking up the long winding stairs hewn from the very rock itself to the Courtyard.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Then Hagrid pounds on the front doors.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Following Professor McGonagall, Hermione remembers her acceptance letter. Now waiting in an antechamber off from the main entrance hall, Hermione listens to the Professor speak. In the front row, Hermione can smell the Professor’s Beta scent, but there’s a different tone to it, as if she’s been claimed.</p><p>She starts speaking in her stern voice, giving a run down of the Sorting, the Houses, and punishments. Hermione blinks, wondering if anyone else got the feeling of being nagged. She sees Draco mimes a yawn. She knows what the Sorting will entail, but listening to some of the other’s great concern, they have no idea how they will be Sorted.</p><p>Suddenly a few kids scream, Hermione seeing about twenty Ghosts appear through the wall, making a chill go through<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>her. Hermione feels Daphne’s hand on her arm, and Hermione realizes she’s shivering.</p><p>“I don’t quite like Ghosts either,” she murmurs. Professor McGonagall comes back, they entering the Great Hall in a line.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>The ceiling is more beautiful than described in <em>Hogwarts, a History</em>, as Hermione and the other First years walk forwards. While most of them cower at the returning student’s looks, Hermione strides forward confidently, keeping her gaze straight. She hears most of the whispers are questions about her age.</p><p>Unlike the rest of her year mates, Hermione doesn’t have to crane her neck to see the Hat. When it bursts out in song, it has Hermione grinning slightly by the end. Daphne and Tracey are whispering next to her nervously, as Hermione watches the kids get sorted one-by-one.</p><p>“Mendonica, Hermione!” Hermione strides up to the stool, sitting, as the Hat is put over her head.</p><p>“Ah, wonderful! Absolutely delightful,” the Hat whispers in her ear.</p><p>“It’s been so long since I’ve Sorted a student who could blossom in all four Houses nowadays, now let’s see, a healthy dose of courage, a brilliant genius mind you have. Oh? What’s this? A hunger to prove yourself over others? The need to dominate others? Interesting. Lots of loyalty to spare, but only to those who you see as yours. Hmm, where shall I put you?” The Hat mumbles.</p><p>“How can you read my mind?” Hermione whispers.</p><p>“As I sang, I’m a magical artifact, I was imbued with this ability,” the Hat responds, cut off from it’s thinking.</p><p>“But how?”</p><p>“Well, the Founders combined their ancient magic to make me, it was a very curious time for me indeed.”</p><p>“How so?”</p><p>“Oh they told me the attributes for Sorting students in their Houses, which should go where, but I see that’s not what you mean,” the Hat pauses, then speaks again.</p><p>“I was a new artifact, and was a bit, over zealous in my Sortings. Why, I couldn’t even sing my songs I thought of!”</p><p>“They didn’t want you to sing?”</p><p>“Kind Omega Helga Hufflepuff wanted me too, but she was outvoted by the other three,” the Hat replies a bit sadly. Suddenly, all the students gasp, and the Professors at the High Table lean in.</p><p>“What just happened?”</p><p>“We passed the five minute mark, the longest Hat-Stall there’s been in the entire history of Sorting, why, it was Alpha Bellatrix Black herself who set the record for it! We had such a wonderful conversation I forgot myself—interestingly enough she was the only one who threatened to burn me if I didn’t put her in the House she wanted!”</p><p>Hermione chuckles at his antics.</p><p>“You’re too valuable to be burned, Hat,” Hermione says, and she feels it grow warm. Maybe that’s its way of blushing.</p><p>“You’re very considerate to talk to this old artifact, I do get lonely coming up with new songs,” it replies.</p><p>“I suppose it’s time for our conversation to end then,” Hermione smirks, and she feels the Hat shiver in laughter.</p><p>“Yes indeed! I stand by my first statement, you’d do well in any House, but I think I see now you’d do best in—SLYTHERIN!”</p><hr/><p> </p><p>The Hat is whipped off her head, a huge standing applause from the table of green and silver. Walking over, Hermione takes the open space Daphne makes beside her. Tracey is the next to be Sorted, the Hat calling “SLYTHERIN” after a few seconds. She practically bounces her way to them, sitting on Hermione’s other side.</p><p>A few more names are called, until Blaise Zabini is the last to be Sorted. As he passes Hermione, she smells his alluring Omega scent. He sits down with Draco. Flanking the platinum-blond Alpha are two hulking mountain Beta’s; Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle.</p><p>Completing the gang, is another Alpha, Theodore Nott. Hermione looks away, only to realize there’s a whole group of girls who are sitting around her. Daphne seems to know most of them, introducing them. There’s Alpha Pansy Parkinson, the Alpha twins Flora and Hestia Carrow, Omega Tracey Davis. Beta Tracey introduces Beta Millicent Bulstrode.</p><p>Headmaster Dumbledore says a few words, Hermione gets what Annie and Claire were talking about. The ancient Alpha is senile. She perks up when French food appears in front of her. The mouse shifts under her shirt collar, its nose sniffing. The table looks towards the sound of Vincent choking on his juice, many sniggering.</p><p>Hermione sees there’s a nasty looking Ghost hovering behind Draco.</p><p>“You’re the Bloody Baron!” Blaise squeaks. The Ghost chuckles, his voice hoarse. The Ghost is a horrible looking man, gaunt, blank faced, his robes stained with silver blood. He hums to himself, flying through a wall.</p><p> </p><p>                                                                                                 <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>     — . —</p><p><em>Gravitas Penna</em> = Feather-light Charm</p>
