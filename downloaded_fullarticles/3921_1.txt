    <p>The Yule Ball was supposed to be a time of enjoyment and “well-mannered frivolity”. A time where all of the three wizarding schools in the Triwizard Tournament could come together for the holidays and laugh and dance and go crazy. Luna Lovegood only went to be polite.</p>
<p>Luna attended the Yule Ball with a nice-looking boy from Beauxbatons Academy. This was her first date, and it did not go as she planned…</p>
<p>“Um…excuse me?” A Beauxbatons boy had walked up to Luna and was now rocking back and forth on his heels in front of her, steeling himself to say something.<br/>

“Yes?” asked Luna. She was sitting outside in the courtyard, doing her charms homework. Even though it was the dead of winter and the wind was blowing ferociously in her face, Luna enjoyed the solitude and it seemed that she was the only one who did.</p>
<p>The boy raised his thick black scarf up to his chin. “I was…well…I was just…erm-”</p>
<p>“Wrackspurt got you?” Luna could tell the signs of Wrackspurt infestation in the human mind and this boy definitely had some floating around in his head.</p>
<p>“No.” The boy pretended not to notice the divergent in the conversation and sighed. “Look, I’ve already asked two girls from Hogwarts and they said they already had dates.” He adjusted the fingers on his black leather gloves. “You’re a pretty girl so I was wondering…” The boy was momentarily distracted by Luna putting her wand behind her left ear before continuing. “Would you please go to the Yule Ball with me?”</p>
<p>“Alright,” said Luna. She was not much for dancing but she decided that since this boy needed a date for the ball so badly she would oblige.</p>
<p>“Alright.” The boy did not seem overly enthused, as a boy should be when he asks a girl out. He just stood there as if he had just presented a long boring speech and was happy to get it off his chest. “My name’s Matthew Turner. I guess we should know each other’s names before we go to a social event together, right?”</p>
<p>“I suppose,” said Luna, staring up over Matthew’s shoulder to stare at a large clump of snowflakes gliding down towards the ground in her trademark dreamlike state.  “My name’s Luna Lovegood. Why don’t you have a French accent?” She continued to stare over his shoulder but she really was curious. Seeing as he went to a French school was odd that he didn’t have an accent.</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah. Well, my mum’s French and my dad’s a Brit. I live with my dad, but my mum wanted me to go to the school she went to: Beauxbatons.”</p>
<p>“I live with my dad too,” said Luna, finally turning her protuberant eyes to Matthew’s face. He had short, honey-blonde hair with sharp hazel eyes and a long pointed nose. He had full lips that Luna was sure some girls dreamed about snogging many a night. But Luna was not attracted by the outward appearance of a man. She looked for humility, bravery and loyalty. But she was doing Matthew a favour, so she guessed that this didn’t really count as a date. “My mum doesn’t live with us because she-”</p>
<p>“Sorry, Lydia,” said Matthew, who at this point was staring at a few Hufflepuff girls walking towards the castle. “That sounds fascinating but I have to get going. Meet me by the front doors tomorrow night at seven. Goodbye!” He ran off and greeted the two Hufflepuffs with a jovial “Hello, ladies!” The two girls, whom Luna now recognised as Hannah Abbott and Susan Bones, giggled and Hannah playfully punched Matthew in the shoulder.</p>
<p>“Oh. Alright.” Luna mumbled as she put her charms homework back into her bag and headed towards the dormitories. “And my name is Luna,” she whispered to the ground.</p>
<p>Luna thought that the boy was a bit pompous and full of himself and he certainly knew the affect he had on teenage girls. And she was definitely worried about catching some of those Wrackspurts in his head.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t help wondering if there was even a boy out there who would talk with her and get to know her. Who wouldbefriend her. Who would love her.</p>
