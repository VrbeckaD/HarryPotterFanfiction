    <p>
  <span>Wherever Harry was, it was dark. So dark that Harry thought there had never been light in this place to begin with. The dimness seemed to rest in the cold stone walls and drip down from the ceiling like slow melting icicles. Even the air around him felt like it was dark, like he could breathe it in. He imagined it entering his blood stream, overtaking the cells there. He saw them mutating black and spreading like cancer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry knew he needed to get out of there, but he couldn’t see how. The only light he had was his wand, and that did a laughable job at best. But, he knew he’d been here before, and he’d gotten out before, so he could get out again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But then, why should he leave?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The problem was every time he ended up here it became a little harder to leave. He became a little more comfortable in the dark, the passage out seemed longer than last time, and Harry had less and less reason to justify his leaving.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t as if the place was completely dreadful, not really, not anymore. It was dark and cold and wet, but that wasn’t anything Harry wasn’t used to. He could see himself melding into this place, his bones fading into the walls. In a place like this he could just be. It wouldn’t matter if he was important. It wouldn’t matter if he had a purpose. It wouldn’t matter if he didn’t belong. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he </span>
  <em>
    <span>didn’t</span>
  </em>
  <span> belong here, he told himself. He had to leave.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>They don’t need you anymore, Harry</span>
  </em>
  <span>. A voice echoed, but whether it was in his head or not, Harry couldn’t tell. It didn’t matter, because he could hear it all the same.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>You’re of no use to them. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Harry shut his eyes in a futile attempt to block the voice out. Somehow, the back of his eyelids seemed brighter than the hallway he was standing in.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>You can be useful here.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry opened his eyes and it almost felt as if it was lighter in the hallway. “No,” Harry said, but whether it was to the voice or himself, he couldn’t tell. But that didn't matter either, because still he had said it all the same.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was laughing, soft at first and then louder and louder, and it spurred Harry into a run. He ran, and the laughter followed him, and it was so loud his ears were ringing in pain. He ran as fast as he could with that laughter in his ears, and the darkness moving around him. It brushed across his face like razor-tipped feathers and made him stumble. His chest hurt and his ears hurt and that fucking laughter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why wouldn’t it stop? Where did this hallway end? How far would he have to go?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>An answer came with a shriek.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Far, far, far.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry kept running, but he couldn’t tell if he was even moving. He legs were, but it felt like the ground was moving on a circuit.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Farther, farther, farther.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry screamed as it laughed. He pumped his legs as fast as they would go, his lungs burning, making him light headed for lack of air. Spots came around his vision, but everything was becoming lighter. He was sure he would pass out soon, and perhaps then he would wake up. He ran faster.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t his mind playing tricks on him, it was getting lighter in the tunnel. He could see a silhouette of the walls now, rounded and jagged in no discernible pattern. Something told him not to look at them. He closed his eyes and the laughing became inconceivably louder. Harry had to get out of here, he had to—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s eyes opened slowly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He reached up and rubbed his eyes with a sigh. Without moving, he scanned the room, looking for any sign that he was still asleep. The only thing worse than having a nightmare was waking from one right into another. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He took stock of his room and searched for any inconsistencies. The room was small and white, and with the lights on it felt almost clinical. The unnatural brightness of it hurt Harry’s eyes, but he hardly noticed it anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t like to be in dark spaces anymore. That was why he had chosen a small flat where everything was in one room. The less space there was, the less chance there could be something hiding in it. He had gone so far as to take all the doors off their hinges.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He found nothing amiss in the room and decided he was in fact awake. He reached out for his glasses on the floor beside his mattress and slipped them on. His head turned on instinct to look at the clock, before remembering it was no longer there. No reflections, he thought. He picked up his wand and cast a </span>
  <em>
    <span>Tempus</span>
  </em>
  <span>, finding it to be well into the middle of the night. Knowing he wouldn’t get back to sleep, he threw the covers off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry got up from his bed and made his way over to the several thick pieces of stacked plywood that served as his desk. He picked up his latest tome and sat down cross-legged on the cushion in front of it and began to read. He hadn’t read more than a few pages when he saw it. The only thing that stopped Harry from reacting was far too much experience with being prey. He controlled his breathing as he watched it out of the corner of his eye. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without warning, Harry turned his head toward the shadow in the corner and bared his teeth with a snarl. The shadow dispersed, a cloud moving out of the way of the sun, and Harry turned back to his book.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not today,” he muttered to himself. Harry couldn’t concentrate on his book after the shadow left. He knew the dream meant something else had changed, but he was too scared to find out what. He had been hoping reading would distract him enough that he could hold off for at least a few days.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But curiosity got the better of him, so he set his book down and took a steadying breath. There was but one mirror in his flat, and it was kept in pieces, face down in an open box. When Harry needed to look at himself he would </span>
  <em>
    <span>Reparo</span>
  </em>
  <span> the pieces back into one. He did this all with his eyes closed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re Harry James Potter,” he told himself, “Son of Lily and James Potter. Your best friends are Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. You make brooms. You love treacle tart and spy novels. You’re a Gryffindor. You defeated Voldemort.” He repeated this several times before he worked up the nerve to open his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he saw himself, he faltered, but continued his chant as he inspected himself. Skin and bones, no amount of eating could fix, not that he had an appetite. His skin was tinged grey and lackluster, as if he had a layer of dust on him. Harry forced himself to move his eyes upward, toward his face. The closer he got, the faster he spoke. His cheeks were hollowed, causing the bones to protrude not unlike Maleficent. His lips looked as if they had never had any blood in them to begin with, and he knew if he pulled them back he’s see the sharpened points that served as his teeth. His hair sat atop his head like burnt straw, but the worst was his eyes. They were sunken in, but bright. They had lost their colour a long time ago, and instead of his mother's green, they were a piercing amber.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re Harry James Potter,” he said again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A monster,” his reflection replied. Harry didn’t hesitate in shattering the mirror.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m Harry James Potter,” he said louder, speaking to the broken shards of glass. Then he turned to the corner where he had seen the shadow earlier. “I’m Harry James Potter!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sat on the mattress throwing his head in his hands. No physical changes that he could see, which meant that whatever had changed would probably be worse. Maybe he wouldn’t be able to sleep anymore, or he would only be able to drink the blood of baby lambs or whatever it was demons drank.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because that’s what he was now. A demon in a human body. He threw himself back on the mattress and laughed without humor. Who was he kidding? Harry Potter was gone. Whoever he was it wasn’t him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the shadow was back. Harry turned his head to stare at it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you come to take me?” he asked. The shadow moved closer. “Well, go right ahead.” Harry went back to staring at the ceiling, waiting. The shadow moved to the ceiling, looking down on Harry. It expanded until it hovered just above Harry, then a blackened hand reached out and touched him. The shadow and his arm connected with a sizzle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry yelped and jumped away, and the shadow receded just as quickly. “Go away!” Harry shouted, cradling his arm. “Get the fuck out of here!” He snarled and the shadow left. He looked down at his arm and saw the imprint of a hand etched into his skin. He could try to heal it, but he knew there was no point. It’d go away in its own time, if at all. He still had the outlines of fingers on his neck, but most everything else had gone away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What was he thinking? Inviting it in like that! He was seething and the worst part was he had no one to be mad at except himself. He had brought this whole damn thing upon himself in the first place. If he hadn’t been so rash, so stupid! If he had just fucking thought things through for once.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And now he had to get himself out of it. He had promised. He sighed as he got up and made his way back to his desk. He picked up his book and began to read.</span>
