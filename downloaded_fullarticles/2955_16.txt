    <p>Harry sat in the salon chair looking at himself in the mirror. His two best friends were behind him, holding hands and looking at him with some concern. He tried to smile at them but it came as more of a grimace. The stylist came around the corner carrying a small bowl and brush. “All set to become the new you?” she said in an overly cheery voice.</p><p> </p><p>Harry silently nodded in agreement and closed his eyes. He heard Hermione take a deep breath, and knew exactly what she was about to say. “Stop, Hermione. I'm absolutely certain I need to do this. After everything that's happened I can't continue looking like my father. It's time for me to be just Harry. Just Harry.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione sighed, “Alright, Harry, you know that Ron and I are here for you no matter what.”</p><p> </p><p>“That's right, mate! Even if you look ridiculous we'll still love you. Ouch! Hermione! Stop kicking me!”</p><p> </p><p>That did it. Harry opened his eyes and laughed. Everything was going to be brilliant. “I'm ready Bridgette. Get rid of this hair.”</p><p> </p><p>Bridgette flashed a bright smile and flung a cape over Harry's shoulders. He really was ready. He'd thought about this long and hard for several months. Every day he got closer to his birthday he grew more and more panicked. The older he got, the more he looked like his father. But his father never lived to see 25, and he didn't want to think about that anymore. He didn't want to look in the mirror every day and wonder if this is what James would have looked like when Harry was a boy. It hurt too much. So Harry had decided to change his hair. At first he thought about going blonde, but that brought too many images of <em> another </em>  blonde idiot. Next he'd considered a lovely brown, like Hermione's, but quickly tossed that idea feeling like it was still too close to what he already had. Then he'd had the brilliant idea to go red. The Weasley family had always told him he was like family to them, why not look like he really fit in? So he'd asked Ginny where she got her hair done, and made an appointment with Bridgette.</p><p> </p><p>An hour later Harry was looking in the same mirror at a completely different person. His usually pale skin seemed to have a new glow to it, his eyes were bright green and shining, and his hair was a wonderful deep shade of red. Not quite as gingery as the Weasleys. This red was almost too dark to be natural, but that didn't really matter in the wizarding world. Harry couldn't wait to go into work tomorrow and introduce the new look to the world.</p><p> </p><p>******</p><p> </p><p>Severus walked down the streets of Diagon Alley with purpose. It had been 8 years since he'd stepped foot in wizarding London, but he'd be damned if he let the stares and whispers around him upset him.</p><p> </p><p>After the Dark Lord had been defeated Severus managed to drag himself to the hospital wing at Hogwarts before collapsing. He slept for 7 days and woke to a frantic Poppy Pomfrey pouring potions down his throat. Once she was sufficiently convinced he wasn't going to pass out again any time soon, she fetched Minerva and Kingsley. Severus told them how he'd been prepared for multiple ways for the Dark Lord to kill him. After he'd given Potter his memories and watched the boy run away to save the world, he had taken the antidote to Nagini's venom. Severus spent years collecting her venom and testing different potions to neutralize it. He wasn't sure the final product would actually work, but he wasn't going out without a fight. Thankfully it worked. He was alive, and healing quickly.</p><p> </p><p>Kingsley assured him that as the new Minister for Magic, and with Harry's testimony, that Severus was free and clear of all charges against him. Minerva offered the potions professor position, but Severus declined. For the first time in his life he felt free to do whatever he wanted. As soon as Poppy told him he was well enough to go, Severus gathered his belongings, and left.</p><p> </p><p>He spent 8 precious years in near solitude, creating new potions, and conducting important research. Then out of nowhere, a strange owl appeared at his window with a very interesting letter. A new road was opening up in Diagon Alley, and the city planner wanted <em> him </em> to open an apothecary.</p><p> </p><p>
