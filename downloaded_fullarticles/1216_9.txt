          <div class="userstuff"><p>“So, I’ll see you next week?” Malfoy asked him, even after Harry had already told him they’d be meeting again, to talk about job prospects this time. </p><p>They had been meeting to talk since Malfoy’s trial, when Harry had spoken in his behalf. They had since opened up about the war, about their losses and the way their worlds had changed since May. It had been almost a year now, and Harry still didn’t know what to do with himself. </p><p>Ever since Harry had quit Auror training, he had been feeling lost as to what to do with his life next. He had been wondering about just bumming around for a while longer, maybe travelling; after all, how <em> bad </em> could that possibly be? Muggles took gap years, he knew that much. Maybe he could see other countries, learn more about his father’s family’s culture. He sure had the time now and, with magical transportation, there was no reason he couldn’t come back to see Teddy every now and then. </p><p>Meanwhile, Malfoy had tried to convince him to <em> stay </em> in England, which Harry found odd. It was true that Malfoy himself couldn’t leave the country, for it was one of the conditions of his probation, but Harry didn’t think he would try to keep him from doing something good for himself. Not <em> anymore </em> at least. </p><p>“Yeah, sure. I’m not gonna run off on you,” Harry joked. </p><p>Malfoy seemed to regard him for a long second, and Harry noticed a single, thin line between his eyebrows. He had never noticed it before, he thought, and briefly wondered if it had been because they’d never stood this close to each other before. </p><p>
  <em> Oh.</em>
</p><p>Before Harry’s brain could come up with an explanation for their current predicament, he felt Malfoy’s cold hands on both sides of his heated face, thumbs grazing his cheekbones. </p><p>
  <em> Oh.</em>
</p><p>“See you next week, then,” Malfoy told him, after planting a kiss on his lips and stepping back, his nose defiantly raised. As if he— <em> as if what?</em> </p><p>Harry stared. </p><p>“Next week, yeah. Sure,” Harry told him, closing the distance between them and sealing his own lips to Draco’s, guiding those cold hands back to his own face. </p><p> </p></div>
