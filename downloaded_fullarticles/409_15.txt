</p><p>.~.</p><p>Albus and Gellert needed a break from writing their manifesto so they decided to start an anonymous sex advice column for fellow young wizards inclined towards the same sex.  Gellert had certain several questionable correspondents and Albus really didn’t want to know how his boyfriend met them.  However, they were useful contacts in getting their column out there in a secret underground newspaper, which was enchanted to look like a magizoologist magazine.</p><p>The young wizards in question were cuddled up on the living room couch in Bathilda Bagshot’s lovely home, with Albus' head resting in Gellert's lap.  (The famous author was out for the day, leaving the young teenagers home alone.)  Several insistent taps on the window alerted Albus and Gellert to the owls that had gathered outside.  Albus reluctantly left the warm comfort of Gellert’s arms to open the window, wand at the ready to bring their mail inside.</p><p>“Look, Gell, we got all sorts of response letters to our advert,” Albus crowed as he levitated them over to the couch and dumped them on the floor. </p><p>“I told you we'd get plenty of responses,” said Gellert, leaning over to give his boyfriend a quick kiss.   </p><p>“This was a great idea, Gell.”  Albus beamed at Gellert, smiling dreamily at the blonde.  </p><p>“See, I know how to take a break from working.  I know how to have fun,” Gellert insisted, absently fingering the tiny golden Deathly Hallows charm that hung around his neck.  Albus wore its twin around his own neck, along with their blood pact pendant which they shared.  </p><p>“I do appreciate it,” said Albus.  “Sometimes these discussions where I disagree about your violent policies towards muggles can get a bit exhausting.  You’re lucky you have me to temper you.”</p><p>“Yes, well…”  Gellert uncomfortably cleared his throat.  “Let’s get started.  You’re the writer, I’ll let you do the responding.  I’ll just give you suggestions that you may or may not wish to use.”</p><p>“That sounds perfect,” said Albus.   “I’m glad you trust me so completely.”</p><p>They sifted through their massive pile of mail, tearing open the red seals and scanning the contents of the letters.</p><p>“This one’s pretty basic,” said Gellert with a chuckle.  “Dear GGAD, how do you know if you like men?”</p><p>“That’s a good one to start with.”  Albus scooted down towards the coffee table, needing a flat surface.  Then he grabbed a clean sheet of parchment, an inkwell, and a quill and prepared to respond.    </p><p>
  <em>I knew I liked men when I kept getting little fluttery feelings in my stomach when an attractive boy walked past me at school.  I wanted to impress several of my good-looking male classmates with my dueling skills while I couldn’t care less if I impressed the girls.  Also, if you find yourself having fantasies about wanting to kiss a cute boy, that’s a key sign.  But don’t worry, you can come to terms with the fact that you are different and I believe you will find love someday.   -AD</em>
</p><p>Gellert read over Albus’ shoulder and cringed.  “Merlin, Albus, that’s way too long.  You should keep your answers short and sweet.  Here, like this.”  Gellert grabbed the parchment without asking and stole the quill from Albus’ hands before writing his answer below Albus’.   He didn’t have a flat surface to write on so the words were written at an angle. </p><p>
  <em>If you find yourself dreaming about sticking your dick down a hot guy’s throat, you’re most definitely a homosexual.  -GG</em>
</p><p>“That’s rather crude,” Albus protested. </p><p>“Yes, but it answers the question.”  Gellert winked at his boyfriend.  “Did you expect anything less from me?” </p><p>“Right, moving on,” said Albus.   He opened a few letters and skimmed the contents, looking for a question that really caught his eye.</p><p>“Here’s an interesting one,” said Gellert.   “Dear GGAD, when you have the anal sex in your partner, can you feel his cum while it shoots into you?”</p><p>Albus sighed.  “<em>The</em> anal sex?  Well, we did say they could ask us anything.  Here, hand me the parchment.”  The elder wizard jotted down an answer.</p><p>
  <em>Thank you for your… interesting question.  No, unfortunately I’m afraid I can’t tell.  I just feel a general warmth but I haven’t detected anything different during my partner’s emission.   -AD</em>
</p><p>Gellert groaned.   “That’s a horrible answer!  We’re not going to keep a following if you answer like that.”  He accioed a quill and added his own contribution.</p><p>
  <em>Don’t listen to him.  When AD comes inside me, I can feel every spurt of his hot seed inside me.  -GG</em>
</p><p>“That’s a very… creative answer, Gellert.  Here’s another one,” said Albus.  “Dear GGAD, were you good at giving your first blow job or did it take a bit to learn how to do it well?”</p><p>
  <em>Good question.  Honestly, I was quite terrible at it.  I was so worried that I was going to accidentally hurt GG with my teeth that I kept pulling off and asking GG if he was alright.   He got so fed up with me that he couldn’t even maintain an erection and stormed off in a huff.   It really takes about a month of practice to feel like you can consistently do it well.  Be sure to try different positions so you can find one that doesn’t hurt your jaw as much. -AD</em>
</p><p>“Albus, they don’t actually want real advice!”  Gellert rolled his eyes.  “Give me that.” </p><p>
  <em>Apparently it depends on the person.  I have always been extremely skilled at giving blow jobs.  I’ve never had any complaints.  I was able to deepthroat my first partner without choking once.   And I swallowed all of it on the first try.   I guess it’s just a hidden talent I was born with.  -GG </em>
</p><p>“I happen to know that’s not true,” said Albus, hiding a smile.  “Sometimes you still choke.”</p><p>“I’m not telling them that,” Gellert protested.  “They must believe I’m a sex god or else this column is all for naught.”</p><p>“I thought we were doing this out of the goodness of our hearts to educate our fellow homosexual wizards,” said Albus.  </p><p>“Oh right - that’s the real reason,” said Gellert, gently kissing Albus’ hand as he turned up the charm.  “Of course it is, darling.” </p><p>“Uh huh.  How about this one?”  Albus picked out another letter.   “He wants to know what our first time was like.”</p><p>“That’s not even a question.”  Gellert rolled his eyes.  </p><p>Albus ignored him and wrote a response.</p><p>
  <em>Our first time was memorable to say the least.   I was so nervous that it was hard for me to relax.  GG had to ply me with chocolate, and give a heartfelt speech about how much he loved me to calm me down and kiss me senseless before I was ready to participate on the receiving end.   Truly, having him enter you is a very weird feeling and it can be painful at first so make sure to have extra lube on hand.  It took a few tries until I could truly enjoy it, but that’s all part of the experience.  Seeing what you and your partner like and don’t like, baring your soul to them, and reveling in the vulnerability of the act is simply beautiful.    -AD</em>
</p><p>“No, no, Albus,” Gellert complained after he read Albus’ answer.  “That doesn’t fit.  Here, I got this.” </p><p>
  <em>It was perfect.  -GG</em>
</p><p>“Gellert, you can’t tell them that!”  Albus cried after he read what his boyfriend had written.  He swatted Gellert's head, who protested loudly.  “They’ll expect this fairy tale beautiful experience and when that doesn’t happen they’ll be disappointed and think there’s something wrong with them.”</p><p>“So?” Gellert shrugged.</p><p>Albus just shook his head in exasperation.  “Let’s move on.” </p><p>“Merlin, we’ve gotten this question several times,” said Gellert as he sifted through the letters.   </p><p>“Let me see.”  Albus gently took the letter out of Gellert’s hands.  “Dear GGAD, how often do you come at the same time?” </p><p>Albus wrote a quick reply.</p><p>
  <em>We’ve only known each other for a couple of months, so we haven’t quite mastered that.  But I’m certain with a lot of practice, we might be able to manage it although I’m told it is a rare feat.   -AD</em>
</p><p>“Might be able to manage it?” Gellert scoffed.  “That makes us sound like amateurs.”</p><p>“Gellert, we <em>are</em> amateurs.  I’m being realistic,” said Albus.  “You should try it sometime.”</p><p>“Speak for yourself,” Gellert countered. </p><p>“You had a grand total of two fumbling encounters at school before you met me,” Albus reminded him.  “It’s not like you’ve got years of experience.”</p><p>“Yes, but we are supposed to be sexperts, remember?”  Gellert reached out to squeeze Albus’ thigh, who jumped at the touch as Gellert knew all of his ticklish spots by now.  “We shouldn’t say anything that makes us look inexperienced.”  Gellert added his own answer underneath Albus’.</p><p>
  <em>Don’t listen to AD, he’s just trying to make you feel better about yourself.  We always come at the same time.  -GG</em>
</p><p>“You are deliberately spreading misinformation.”  Albus gave his boyfriend a disapproving look.</p><p>“No, I’m just stretching the truth a little.” Gellert smiled sweetly at him.  “You’re taking this way too seriously.”</p><p>“And you’re not,” Albus countered.</p><p>Gellert rolled his eyes.  “Pick another question.”</p><p>Albus chose a new letter and opened it.  “Oh, you’ll like this one,” said Albus, blushing a bit.   “Dear GGAD, does penis size matter?”  Albus scribbled down a quick reply.</p><p>
  <em>Absolutely not.  As long as you love your partner, you will find a way to enjoy being intimate regardless of their size.  -AD</em>
</p><p>“Albus!  How can you say that? It makes it sound like I have a small dick!”  Gellert wailed, grabbing Albus by the shoulders and shaking him.</p><p>“No, it doesn’t,” Albus said calmly, twisting out of Gellert’s grip.  </p><p>Gellert shuddered.  “At least add a postscript clarifying you’re not actually referring to me in your response.” </p><p>“No!”  Albus crossed his arms as he glared at Gellert.  “I’m trying to inform these poor clueless young wizards so they don't feel so alone and you’re just trying to feed your massive ego.   You know what?  That’s enough questions for now.  I need something to drink.”</p><p>“Quite right,” said Gellert, noting that Albus had thrown the piece of parchment aside before heading towards the kitchen.   He added one last comment before carelessly tossing the paper aside, planning to return to it later. </p><p>
  <em>Yes.  And by the way, mine’s massive.   -GG</em>
</p><p> .~.</p><p>THE END… for now. </p>
