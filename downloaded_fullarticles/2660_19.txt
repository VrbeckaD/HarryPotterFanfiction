  <span>Luna had been pacing around the kitchen of her old family home trying to work out what she was going to do about everything that had happened over the last day for hours now, she had hardly slept for worry of it. Things with Rolf were… complicated, yes she cared about him, but she didn't think she loved him, she wasn't sure if she ever would, or at least not in the way he wanted her to. She definitely didn't want to marry him, she was certain about that if nothing else. Which is how she found herself back home alone a week before Christmas; she was supposed to still be with Rolf on their last research trip, but things were too awkward, she didn’t feel like she could stay there with him after refusing to marry him. She’d apparated home to get away, from the awkwardness, but being alone right now was the last thing she needed, though she wasn’t sure where else she could go. She needed to stop worrying about last night, and to stop remembering Christmases past in this house with her parents — both of whom were now dead. </span>

  <span>It wasn't until the kettle started whistling, and she was in the process of making her fifth cup of tea of the morning that she realized that she didn't have to sit around and mope, she had friends that she could go and visit. Friends that had always told her to drop in whenever she is back in England. Maybe taking a trip to visit them all over the next week would help her? Now she just needed to decide who to see first, though that was a fairly easy decision; with the thoughts of love on her mind one person was at the forefront, the only person she had ever loved, and the only one of her friends that she knew had already finished work for the holidays. Neville Longbottom. So without thinking any more, before she talked herself out of it, without even glancing at the clock she wrapped herself up in her coat and old Ravenclaw scarf and hat, she grabbed her bag and apparated to where she knew he now lives. </span>

  <span>It had been years since Luna had last found herself standing on the main street in Hogsmeade, despite the passage of time everything still looked as it always had. Very few places had lights on, not that Luna noticed that she was trying to get her bearings to remember in which direction she had to go to get to Neville’s. The way she was facing she knew that behind her was the land that led up to the castle, so it meant she must head forwards. She slowly headed the other side of Hogsmeade the wind was bitterly cold, despite her hat and scarf, which was slowing her down immensely. It was nearly an hour, and many wrong turns, before she found herself at the cottage that she recognized as Neville's new home, he'd only just moved in when she left for her last trip, she had spent all the time hoping he was settling in okay. She opened the gate, flinching as it made a high-pitched squeak in the cold, quiet December morning, she settled though once it was wide enough for her to fit through and shut it, hearing the squeak again. She looked around but no lights had come on in any of the surrounding windows, she breathed a sigh of relief as she walked up the garden path and gently knocked on the front door. </span>
