    <p>I tug at the bonds around my wrists that keep my arms pulled up above my head, the tight rope digging in further and I know I’ll still be wearing the marks caused by them tomorrow, closing my eyes I think about why I’m currently in this position.</p><p>“Open your eyes, Malfoy and look at me.” Potter growls, the words echo loudly in the small hotel room. I open my eyes slowly and look at the black haired man before me, he’s the reason I’m strung up to the ceiling because it’s what I asked for. We have an agreement, one that allows both of us to let off some steam. Occasionally I enjoy giving up control and just letting go for an hour or two, a kink for pain and submission. Some might say that such a thing means that I have some form of mental impairment, but I disagree.</p><p>“Fuck off Potter; you’re not the boss of me.” I spit before closing my eyes again, mouth curling into a smirk at the flash of anger I see on his face before the world once again goes black. I might enjoy giving up control but I don’t give it up easily. Pain makes it easier, gives me the excuse I need to stop fighting, to give in, without damaging my pride too much. Which is where Potter comes in, he’s more than happy to provide me with that pain while still being noble enough to never take it too far, even when he is really angry. Just like he is right now, I can almost taste it in the air as I take a deep breath in, angry because of the fight I caused in the middle of the ministry earlier today. Making Potter angry has always been easy for me, achieved with just a few choice words meaning that the stinging hex I’d shot at his back was unnecessary. But I wanted him more than angry; I wanted him furious because today I really want him to hurt me. He’d spun around then, marching right up to me until there was less than an inch between us and growled quietly ‘tonight, 8 o’clock and you had better not be a single second late’ before storming away. So I’d turned up at the hotel 10 minutes late because damn it’s fun seeing just how far I could push him. Even knowing I would be the one to pay for it doesn’t deter me.</p><p>I hear the sound of his heavy footfalls as he moves closer, the movement in the air letting me know he has stopped before me, far enough away that I’m still within reach of his hands but not his mouth. I keep my expression blank, pushing down the nervous excitement in my stomach, as I begin to imagine what he would do this time. I really have pushed him today more than I ever have before, and know that I would soon suffer the results. I blame my workload for taking things so far earlier, the annual performance reports are being done at the Ministry and I’m the one in charge of the paperwork. Thus resulting in me being more stressed than usual and Potter has been refusing to meet with me. I could have found someone else; in one of the clubs I use to go to before but why bother with the hassle when I have Potter.</p><p>“Open your eyes,” Potter demands again and I widen my smirk in response. Any second now he’ll lose his patience and I’ll feel the sting of a slap or the dull ache of a punch. My eyes fly open as I feel the tip of his finger brush my cheek.</p><p>This isn’t right. Potter is supposed to be angry, he is supposed to be glaring at me with eyes that burn beneath his scowl. Why is he just staring at me, his finger now trailing along my jaw to my chin?</p><p>“Stop it.” I snarl turning my head away trying to remove his finger; if my body wasn’t held in place by my bonds I would have moved that too.</p><p>“You can’t get away, Draco,” Potter says his tone softer than I’ve ever heard it. My mind is spinning with confusion, what’s going on? This isn’t how we do things.</p><p>“I don’t remember giving you permission to use my name potty.” A childish insult but I’m panicking too much to think of anything else. Potter only let out a sigh at my sharp tone, moving closer and peering into my eyes.</p><p>“Why are you doing this Draco, what do you want?” Potter asks with a soft tone, gentle like his eyes.</p><p>“I’ve told you,” I shout back, feeling out of control and not the way I usually do with Potter, I’m not enjoying this...game or whatever he’s doing.</p><p>“Tell me again, you’re good with words so use them,” he says as his hand moves down my chest. “Has it ever occurred to you that instead of acting like a brat you could just ask me for what you want?” he asks moving closer and I can’t get away as he presses against me his warm breath tickling my ear before he runs his tongue around the edge of it. “Ask me Draco; ask me to hurt you, to touch you.”</p><p>“Never,” I snarl, I’ve never begged him for anything, not even to stop and I’m not going to start now. Potter pulls away and the sudden absence of his body next to mine leaves me cold as he fixes me with a steady look and crosses his arms.</p><p>“I’m getting tired of your attitude Draco. It looks like I need to teach you a lesson.” Potter says a hard edge to his voice. This is what I wanted; this I understood and it meant I would soon get what I wanted. When Potter pulls his wand out I wonder if I’m about to receive a stinging hex for the one I’d shot at him. Instead, his magic swirls around me removing my clothes and sending them to rest in a folded pile on the unused bed. The cold air causes my nipples to harden and my cock stirs despite my nerves at just how Potter plans to teach me a lesson. A second later I growl at him as he conjures a chair before sitting in it and watching me with a smile.</p><p>“What the fuck are you doing?” I snap, goosebumps are spreading over my skin from the chilly air and I feel embarrassed under his scrutiny.</p><p>“Enjoying the view,” Potter answers with a shrug, his eyes raking over me and I can almost feel them like a physical touch. I try to fight back the blush I know is warming my face and moving down to my chest. This isn’t the first time I’ve been naked in front of Potter but usually, I was facing away, arse on fire from being paddled or biting back gasps as he fucked me hard. Being forced to stand here while he stares makes me want to cover myself, makes me want to hide.</p><p>“Well stop it,” I say venom dripping from the words as I give him the coldest glare I can muster, determined not to fidget or squirm I keep my back straight and my head up. Potter, however, ignores me completely; tilting his head to the side in thought and lets out a quiet hum. He nods and pulls out his wand again and I’m sure he’s going to hex me this time, want him to because then I can finally relax. His strange behaviour has me even more on edge than before I got here and I want more than ever to get lost in pain and pleasure. My vision goes dark and I startle letting out a gasp before realising what he has done, a blindfold now covers my eyes, the fabric soft and not too tight.</p><p>“What…” I start to say only to be stopped by a finger pressing on my lips, I hadn’t even realised he’d moved, that Potter is now stood before me.</p><p>“Hush, relax Draco.” I want to snap that it would be a lot easier to do that if I could see and if he would stop messing around but my tongue’s stuck, unable to move as Potter presses a kiss to my neck. What is he doing? We don’t kiss, ever. Potter must have forgotten this as he places more little kisses along my neck, I jump and let out a gasp when he suddenly bites down on the sensitive skin. He’s bitten me before, his teeth sinking into my shoulder as he fucks me; the small sting of pain I’m experiencing now is different. It’s gentler and a shiver goes down my spine as he soothes the pain away with his tongue.</p><p>“Relax Draco; let me take care of you,” Potter whispers into my neck before trailing more kisses across my collarbones and shoulder, a hand stroking along my chest. The scrape of a blunt fingernail over my already hard nipple makes me hiss and press forward into the touch. My cock is hardening, rising with my desire as Potter pinches and rolls my nipples between his fingers, mouth still on my neck kissing, biting and licking the tender skin. I’m not sure what to think, I’m used to extreme pain, the kind that’s hard and unrelenting driven by anger. This feels almost gentle, even as it stings and burns, there is something about it that I can’t describe, can’t understand.</p><p>“Do you know how good you look right now Draco? The red marks on your white throat from my teeth, your nipples red and slightly swollen from my fingers,” Potter says lifting his head to breathe the words into my ear making my hair stand on end. “So fucking beautiful,” he continues before sucking my ear lobe into his mouth then releasing it with a faint pop. I don’t know what to say, my mind is hazy, fuzzy around the edges like the desire flowing through me.</p><p>“Potter what are you doing?” I ask and I’m surprised by how weak I sound.</p><p>“I’m teaching you a lesson, I’m showing you how good it feels when you don’t fight, when you give in, give up control. Does it feel good Draco?” Potter asks. It's on the tip of my tongue to say it feels terrible just to be contrary but one of Potter’s hands is moving lower, his fingertips stroking my hip bone for a few seconds before moving towards my cock. I hold my breath as I wait for his hand to wrap around me, twitching in desire and anticipation, I groan in disappointment when his hand stops just short of where I want it.</p><p>“What do you want Draco?” Potter asks again and I’m getting sick of that question, I’m bloody horny and the relaxing feeling from a moment ago has been chased away by my growing irritation. I open my mouth to tell Potter that I want him to fuck off but the blindfold suddenly lifts leaving me blind as my eyes try to adjust to the light filling the room. Potter takes advantage of my shock to kiss me, mouth open he sneaks his tongue inside before I have a chance to snap it shut. I think of doing it anyway and teaching him a sodding lesson but his lips feel nice on mine, his tongue caressing mine, as his hands roam my body sending jolts of pleasure to my neglected cock. I can’t remember the last time I was kissed like this, as Potter continues to softly claim my mouth I wonder if I’ve ever been kissed like this. When he finally breaks the kiss I’m panting, my heart hammering in my chest hard enough that Potter can probably see it.</p><p>“I love your mouth, so warm and wet; love how it feels around my cock,” Potter mutters as he runs a thumb over my bottom lip that’s slick with spit, I stick out my tongue licking at the digit watching Potter’s eyes darken at the action as he lets out a moan. “My gorgeous Draco, want you to suck me, want to push my cock to the back of your throat.” I feel my own cock begin to leak at his words and I want to moan, want to ask him to touch me but I can’t, my pride won’t let me. A flick of his wand and my bonds disappear and my shoulders ache as my arms drop, Potter suddenly grabs my wrists looking closely at the irritated skin, touching them gently but even the soft touch makes me hiss. His eyes find mine and he gives me a small smile, moving to hold my hands instead, pulling me closer to him and stealing a chaste kiss.</p><p>“Want me to heal them or would you like to keep them?” he asks, he’s never offered to heal me before and I don’t know if I want him to or not. They hurt but I don’t really mind the pain, I usually only heal the worst of my marks after our meetings, leaving a few of the smaller ones as a reminder.</p><p>“No, it’s fine.” And again it surprises me how small my voice is, I don’t like it, don’t like that Potter is making me feel this way. I feel fragile, as if my skin has become paper thin and all my nerves are open to the air around us, it’s terrifying. Potter releases my hand to comb his through my hair pushing it away from my face as he peers at me, with a tiny frown.</p><p>“Are you ok?” I want to scream at him, that no I’m not. Nothing is making sense. We’ve hardly done anything compared to our other meetings but I feel like I’ve just been through a hardcore session, drained and unfocused. He pulls me into his arms wrapping them around me and I hate myself for falling into it, letting the comfort of it soothe me, drawing warmth and security from Potter. Pushing myself away from him, I curse myself for my weakness, why the hell am I cuddling him like a damn Hufflepuff. Sick of his stupid games and free of my bonds, I walk to the bed. Grabbing my wand that is sat on my clothes I turn it towards him, thinking he will try and stop me as I grab my clothes, tucking them under my arm. He hasn’t moved, hasn’t reached for his wand, he’s just standing there staring. Angry and confused, I spin and disapparate back to my room in the manor, throwing my clothes on the floor I crawl into bed. Fucking Potter, now I’m more stressed than ever.</p>
