  <strong>The Captive Asset</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>This</em>, thought the asset, <em>is the weirdest mission I have ever been assigned. I can say that with absolutely certainty, despite having no memories before this morning.</em></p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>The briefing had lived up to its name. His handler had mumbled something about ‘cultural differences’ and ‘utmost importance of an unfazed demeanor’ before the customary shove out the stealth plane behind enemy lines. At least he’d been given a parachute this time. On his way down, the asset vaguely recalled overhearing his handler and a Hydra scientist discussing time travel and parallel worlds. Before crashing into the azure ocean below, an old quote the asset must have heard in a previous life came to mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>I have a feeling we’re not in Kansas anymore…</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p> He had swum a ways to shore before being ‘saved’ by a small fishing boat. The two men who pulled him out of the water were dressed in what the asset had to assume was traditional garb, and spoke a dialect of Greek with which he was unfamiliar. Drop-offs some distance from the asset’s target were not usual; it was better to approach quietly from afar than arrive too close, too hot, and alert hostile opposition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Still</em>, mused the asset as he faked delirium and exhaustion at the bottom of the boat, <em>landing near the Grecian outer islands when the mission is to disrupt the French seat of power seems a bit…too cautious. </em>Meanwhile, the following exchange occurred above the oblivious asset:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fisherman 1: What’s with this guy?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fishman 2: I dunno. Must be foreign. Did you see his arm?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fisherman 1: Yeah. Crazy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Silence, then…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fisherman 1: When we’re done delivering him to the guards, wanna fuck?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fisherman 2: Sure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cold, wet, and hoping he could rinse off the salt water before his joints rusted, the asset shivered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>I have a bad feeling about this mission.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>After being delivered to the city guards, who wore outfits that managed to show even more leg than the fishermen’s, the asset had politely accepted their gestured offers of a bath and food before breaking through a window and escaping. Dusk found him traversing the white-walled city of one and two storey buildings in the direction of what looked to be rolling hills. From the rare tower, the asset made quick survey of the land. He was surprised to see that he was not, in fact, on an island.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The asset should have paid more attention to the bit about time travel and parallel worlds. In his defense, he was busy trying not to bite off his own tongue and choke to death after a round of memory wiping. He regretted his will to live as he slunk over rooftops of what appeared to be the Greece of antiquity later that night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>But a version of Greece attached to the mainland of Europe. This development is unwelcome.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Like any good cross-generational cyborg assassin, the asset had world maps of city, topography, and death metal bands per capita committed to memory. However, none of that would be useful if in this world, countries had decided they’d rather reside elsewhere.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>So am I where Spain is located on my Earth? Italy? What if France is on the Antarctican continent in this world?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the mission must be completed. Having spotting a caravan exiting the city to the north, the asset leapt lightly onto the roof of a cart and slipped inside to burrow amongst bolts of fine cloth. It was a tight fit between the silks and linens, but the asset regularly slept in a frozen metal tube, so the current accommodations were comparative luxury. He wriggled deeper into a pile of gaudy brocade and dozed to conserve energy.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As luck would have it, the merchant caravan was headed to the French capital.  The asset split time following the carts and horses from a distance, and nestling in the packed bolts of cloth.  Lacking faster means of transportation, or the ability to blend in with the locals, the asset took advantage of the opportunity to defrost.  Life wasn't bad here in alternate, historical Europe, he supposed, but something still seemed…off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While refueling in the kitchen of a local inn (read: stealing food), a couple had been caught <em>in flagrante delicto</em> as he pulled open the pantry door.  Now, the asset was inured to the sight, having often picked such vulnerable moments to strike.  Less often, however, did coitus fail to be interruptus when a hulking assassin with a metal arm made the twosome a threesome.  From somewhere in the heaving mass of flesh, a breathless voice told him in archaic French to either whip out and get in there, or close the damn door.  The asset picked the latter and fled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From his vantage point in the roof of a hideously slow-moving cart, the asset reflected on what he’d learned after traveling from not!Greece to not!France over the course of a week.  The citizens of this other ancient?  Medieval? Renaissance? Europe were certainly very... passionate.  Hot-blooded.  Vivacious. Uh, eager to enjoy life's pleasures.  The asset was not one to judge- literally, he'd had the opinions electrocuted out of him-  but the degree to which the folk here enjoyed each other's company seemed a bit excessive.  He was a bit sore over the fact that he couldn't leave the safety of ‘his’ fabric cart without stumbling upon a tableau of human ecstasy.  But on the other metal appendage, all that time he'd spent in the cart had led him to pick out a sets of some really choice red wool that he’d get knit into a warm scarf for the next time he went back into cryo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But his new, fuzzy scarf would have to come later.  They’d finally arrived in not!Paris, and he had a mission to fulfill.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The layout of what on this Earth was maybe, maybe not Paris depending on the light was far less confusing as many other locations the asset was fairly certain he’d navigated before. Making his way to the palace was easy enough. Avoiding random geysers of bodily fluids was not.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Some days</em>, mourned the asset, <em>it’s not even worth leaving the cloth cart.</em></p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>If he thought the countryside of not!Greece and not!France- which appeared to be somewhere in the Renaissance even though their Grecian neighbors were clinging to Antiquity- was bad, the capital city was worse. Literally every corner, enclave, or medium-to-dark patch of shadow was occupied by writhing, shuddering bodies. As these were the asset’s normal territories, the unforeseen lack of vacancy was somewhat unnerving.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>The STI transmission rate must be obscene,</em> grumbled the asset as he dodged an incoming blast from a covered doorway. He heard the spatter land behind him as he leapt out of the way. <em>These people need help.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>But if he thought the countryside of not!Europe was bad, and the city streets of Paris? worse, the palace was the most precarious danger zone the asset had visited on this mission.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>No, any mission! And I can’t even remember my own name! </em>he thought frantically as he completed an intricate series of flips and twirls to avoid both sight and spewing juices. There seemed to be some kind of celebration going on, as both the richly attired and harried 99% were cavorting under decadent arrangements of bunting and flowers within the capitol building. The asset was hard pressed to choose a course of action to disrupt the power center of <em>la</em> <em>fausse France</em>. Judging from appearances, the ruling parties did not need any help in that department.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As the asset was pirouetting off a balcony and contemplating poisoning the water supply with little blue pills to see if <em>les citoyens</em> would literally fuck themselves to death, the structural integrity of his landing ledge gave way- due to one too many rawdogged, pounding trysts in that particular location-, sending him plummeting into a circle jerk of palace guards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>If there’s a gaggle of geese and a murder of crows, can I coin ‘a circle jerk of guards’ as the official term of venery?</em> pondered the asset as he was cuffed and hauled away with only token resistance. He was going nowhere fast casing the joint. Getting hauled in front of the authorities would certainly cut out a couple hours worth of wafting about the place as The Ghost of Abstinence Past. Be thrown at the king’s feet, listen to him threaten and taunt for a few minutes, then figuratively do to his spinal column what his subjects were literally doing to each other’s assholes: when in doubt, go with the basics, after all. On the way to the dungeon- <em>I hope it’s not THAT kind of dungeon, ugh. But knowing these folks…- </em> he spotted the merchant in charge of the cloth caravan hawking his wares at a pair of noblewomen who were most certainly fingering each other under the table and not listening to the virtues of a particular silk’s weave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>He better not sell that wool I picked out!</em> the asset thought darkly as the bars closed around him in the- thankfully traditional- dungeon.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was brought before the two monarchs, dual rulers of not!France in this parallel Europe. From what he could glean, the Grecian king- ‘Akelios’ in their tongue- had been an imported manservant before working his way into the pants of Vere the Younger’s pants, thus reclaiming a seat, to be callous, in a governing body. The asset placidly played ball from the time of his incarceration to his audience with the kings, which seemed to be a couple days. He would not have minded the captive roll-play, if not for the fact that his gaolers appeared five seconds from ripping off each others’ clothes at any given moment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was brought before the private chambers- because of course he was- of the Akelion and Veretian kings, both alike in equal dignity, in the royal seat of Vere. The asset steeled himself for a thorough decontamination session after the mission’s completion as he was half marched, half hauled into the inner sanctum of the two kings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Fuck Hydra, seriously. Whoever joins them as a rational, consenting adult needs help,</em> swore the cyborg as he was shoved to stand in front of a table near the shared bed of the monarchs. <em>I wish I had my memories, if for no other reason than claiming overtime.</em> What came next, however, would shake his expectations to the core.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A pair of pale, long-fingered hands bracing an overly tall pile of books burst through the door he had recently arrived from, while a tanned lump of flesh in the bed made itself known with a grunt and a seismic shift. The asset was, frankly, shocked that the two had announced themselves know together in a shower of ecstatic pheromones and liquids materializing out of bodily orifices upon his arrival. Already, the asset could tell that these were not your run-of-the-mill alternate!European citizens. The fact that they could keep everything PG-rated long enough to see him safely introduced to their chambers already spoke volumes. He would need to be careful in his approach.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You are not a native of Akelios or Vere,’ said a dignified voice from behind the stack of books. The somewhat reedy tone sent the asset back almost a century to grayer, more precious times with the most important Mission he would ever fail.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>Ça c’est correct. Je suis êtrange, on peut dire</em>.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The darker, attractive man in bed said something in ancient Greek that the asset could only partially understand. The muffled voice behind the fraction of the library responded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No, he’s not a threat. He’s more confused than we are. I suspect he is a man out of his time, so to speak.” The books were placed on the table, revealing a slender blond. “He is but a passing diversion.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the asset had sufficient personality, he would have been offended at the ‘passing diversion’ label. Instead:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Where am I? <em>When</em> am I? Why is everything so similar, yet so, <em>so</em> different? I do not understand,” asked the asset, feebly struggling against his bonds. His attempts did not fool anyone in the room. The blond smiled in a bemused fashion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Your powerless pantomime, though entertaining, is far from convincing. I am sure you could liberate yourself and strangle us both in a matter of seconds before the guards could pull their hands from each others’ pants.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The asset was glad that he wasn’t the only one who was concerning with local security’s personal inspections. The straightlaced blond chuckled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Never fear, <em>sicarius ex machina</em>, you are safe for the time being. Though I must warn you, if you attempt to harm any of our citizens, you will pay the consequences as befitting a traitor of our hospitality.” The asset nodded, once. Better to fake compliance now, shoot up the place later.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If you’re cold, assassin, you’re welcome to a blanket. It appears that nobody knew what to get two kings at their wedding, and assumed that elaborate afghans were a safe bet. Someone must have put them on sale.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>How did he-</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Since you were, ah, delivered to the room, you’ve consistently inched closer to the fireplace. While enjoying all the comforts the dungeon had to offer, the guards reported your frequent shivering.” He paused and turned ever so slightly to the bed. “It’s the height of summer, and even those of us who hail from warmer climes,” the drowsing pile of muscle muttered something sassy in Greek towards the standing king’s direction, “are feeling the heat. You, however, are wrapped in the stolen clothes from what I assume is every drying line between here and border.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>He’s got me there.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Despite training and electroshock therapy to the contrary, the asset failed to hold back a full-body shiver. He was never, truly, warm after coming out of cryo. About a week or so of living in a European summer before the invention of air condition had not defrosted his deepest parts. It was probably all psychological, the asset realized, but still.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The nights, they are…cold,” he ground out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As the asset internally debated the merits of a highly choreographed assault on the unified kings versus simply whacking them over the head with many pounds of metal arm, the only other person in the realm who wasn’t experiencing some stage of the coital process fished a small brown paper package out of the pile of books. It crumpled lightly under long fingers, so the asset cleared its contents of being a threat. The French king resumed their conversation as he began to write a letter at the table.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m curious to know your intentions in our lands. It’s not everyday our kingdoms receive such an exotic visitor,” mused the blond, dotting an I and crossing T’s below his hand. The asset was about say the first lie that came to his lips, when the telltale aura of Hydra’s transport beam bloomed into sight.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The dozing Grecian leapt out of bed, clearing up any suspicion as to what the monarchs had been up to shortly before he was brought before them. So, too, did any questions why the bookish Frenchman was giving this Dude-Bro from the days of yore his favor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>That thing deserves it own postal code,</em> was the asset’s penultimate thought of his Viagra-sponsored trip to Europe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Catch!” called the French king, tossing the wrapped package to the asset from across the room. He grabbed the item out of the air and looked ready to throw it away from his person when the king followed with, “Keep it.” Feeling a surprising sense of trust for the smaller, confident blond man, the asset stuffed the package down the front of his outfit. His last view of the royal chamber was of a smirking blond and his hulking paramour attempting to lure him away from the pile of books.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Light yielded to the cold mercies of his handlers rushing him out of the transport bay and into the ‘debriefing’ chamber, where a week’s worth of grime and memories were literally and metaphorically power-hosed away. Hydra’s higher powers hadn’t realized how behind the times France and Greece on this other Earth were when assigning his latest mission, and lucky for him, didn’t consider the lack of assassinated kings a failure. As if the last several days were nothing but a daydream, the asset found himself back in the cryo tube.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A scant few minutes remained before they would turn on the gas and force him into frozen slumber. The asset was struggling to piece together what had just been taken from his memories when he realized there was an unfamiliar weight against his chest. Hastily reaching inside his jacket as knock out gas began to rise from the floor vents, he pulled out a lumpy package, slightly damp from the post-mission decontamination shower. Ripping it open revealed a red knitted woolen scarf and a note written in French: ‘<em>For those cold nights. –L+D’</em> He quickly looped the fuzzy material around his neck several times and collapsed against the side of the tube.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>White gas filled his vision and his lungs. His eyelids drooped and fell shut. Trying his best to burrow into the mysterious gift, the asset drifted off pondering the identity of L and D from a land of summer.</p>
