    <strong>Harry had just turned 10 and in his mind, he was a very normal, human ten-year-old. Yes, a little abused, malnourished and small for his size. But aside from his living arrangements, he managed to get on with life to a degree of normality. He did his chores and his homework, he enjoyed reading and music like the more nerdy kids his age.</strong>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <strong>However many things just seemingly were not adding up to the young boy.</strong>
  </em>
</p><p>---</p><p>'Why have I not got tanned this summer? I've been doing hours of yard work for Petunia and nothing if anything I've gotten paler.' he thought to himself running his hand over the no longer lightly tanned skin he had from outside manual labour. Thinking over the many hours of heavy lifting and planting flowers in the blistering heat he had done, looking down at his toned muscles from the overworking despite his lack of body fat.</p><p>He was in the bathroom, given his slotted amount of time to clean himself up to not dirty the house after working in the garden. Petunia was always screaming and shouting about how dirty he was, and that he has a stain of mud on their pristine family.</p><p> He had finished with his shower, he was looking in the large mirror that hung above the sink looking at his appearance for the first time in a while which is why he had made the shocking realisation that he looked strangely pale. His eyes also seemed brighter in the green colour with a dark black ring around the iris.</p><p>Doing away with his strange looks as he quickly hurried downstairs to start dinner his too large shirt sticking to his still slightly damp back.<br/>
His worn socks almost silencing his footsteps on the carpet of the stairs.</p><p>As he reached the kitchen he noticed many things also, that Petunia was nowhere to be seen and that everything seemingly smelled much stronger than it had before. He could smell each of the distinctive cleaning products that coated the floor they were almost painfully sharp to his nose and the harsh chemical scent of the strawberry washing up liquid was another stand out scent.<br/>
Shaking his head at the weird difference.</p><p>He made quick work of getting out all the supplies for the nights' meal setting water to boil on the stove ready for the potatoes to be put into once he had peeled and chopped them.</p><p>'Oh no, what if I'm hitting puberty early?' harry questioned to himself, he when it was possible for the increase in hormones to change people's senses but he didn't think it was that drastically different.</p><p>His body worked on auto Pilot making quick work of the meat and placing it in the oven. While he cleaned up his tools as he worked, the flakes of herbs washing down the drain, off the sharp knife he had chopped them with.</p><p>He quickly ate some of the leftovers from the fridge, taking the opportunity to, as his aunt was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>---</p><p>
  <strong>Now unlike Harry's belief, that he happens to be starting puberty, something similar yet very different is happening to his system.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>My name is Mors to the humans I am known as death or at least the personification of what they believe it to be, because of the Potters very close ties to my plain and to me through the brothers who possess my items of death the Peverall 's they were called.</strong><br/>
<strong>I will explain however the other reason this so-called light magic family has ties to the darkness of the underworld.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Little known to the world, a few hundred years ago a Potter met a demon. Now, this creature was seemingly normal to the outside world, if you had met the member of the Potter clan in question, they would have described the partner they found themselves with as kinky or Gothic. Presuming they were knowledgeable of modern terms and subcultures of course. But they didn't and they are dead. They died in childbirth. The baby was born extremely pale much like his father but without the powers, it's parent possessed. Now because of his child's differences and lack of parents who were fit to care for it, he placed part of his powers within the child's blood to lay dormant within the small thing until they were needed. The child still though took after it's now, dead mother and possessed magical abilities and went onwards to schooling and to have a family, raised by its grandparents and aunt.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Now unknowingly to this demon his child did carry his demonic genetics and happened to pass them down to his children and children's children. Along with the protection of extra demonic magic that was tied to his blood.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Well over the last few hundred years, no members of the family have been born demons or had any possibility of demonic powers. Until now. Which is how we get back to harry. His half-blood status triggered the demonic genetics in his bloodline and now his body is slowly preparing itself for its transformation. Now unluckily for Harry his less than, suitable living conditions have made it so the protection from his great-great something or other grandfather's protection has now activated also making a rather strange side affect come Into play.</strong>
</p><p><br/>
---</p><p>It was now around a month after his 10th birthday and Harry was ill, badly so. His entire body was uncomfortable and he wanted to rip his skin off. He was sweating and vomiting constantly, and he had been confined to the Dursleys second bathroom, locked into the room until he was no longer Ill as the Muggle family was scared of catching whatever it was the boy had. Fearing it to be a type of freakish influenza virus or other illness. They avoided him at all costs petunia throwing in scraps of food at random occasions so that they didn't have to deal with the manslaughter charges if the boy died, Vernon would not survive well in prison and neither would she, and then what would happen to her poor duddykins and oh goodness what would the neighbors say. So they kept Harry alive even it was only just.</p><p>Coughing loudly,<em> "what the fuck is wrong with me?"</em> Harry questioned allowed to himself no longer worried about swearing because the Dursleys had locked him away in the semi soundproofed room.<br/>
His throat was dry and painful as every word he spoke seemingly stuck.</p><p>He was worried, not only was he extremely ill but he had been having the weirdest dreams of his body twisting into a monster or of him attacking people. It worried him at first but he found them normal now. Looking into his reflection in the wall length bathroom mirror that his uncle had put up so it was slight left-sided on a slant. Showing just how useless the whale of a man truly was.</p><p>He was undoubtedly taller, that's for sure he was no longer the small boy he used to be if he had to guess he would be around 5'5 extremely tall for a 10-year-old. Maybe that was the cause of his illness the growth spurt. He wondered to himself.</p><p>But logically even to his young mind, he knew that normal illnesses don't make you grow and don't make your skin pale and hair long and darker. He also no longer needs his glasses. That was a weird thing to find out.</p><p>-\- flashback</p><p>
  <em>He couldn't see well, it was his second day locked in the bathroom and his entire vision was blurry, he had cleaned his glasses many times trying to sort out what was wrong until he just took them off.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Throwing the offending objects across the room, hearing the distinctive smash of glass against the cold bathroom tiles that were on the walls and flooring of the room.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He was staring up at the ceiling until he then realised be could see the details on the tiled perfectly clearly. Wiping his eyes he then looked at his hands seeing them clearly without his glasses on for the first time.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It was as if a mist had been lifted from his eyes the constant blurriness that had plagued his vision since before he could remember.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He had a major freak out after that, washing his eyes with water and checking his vision multiple times before passing out from the panic caused by the stress, which took a lot out of his system.</em>
</p><p>-\-</p><p>Aside from the extremely violent dreams he had been having as of late there also dreamed of places he had never been before he knew facts about things he had never read before and heard many different languages. A knowledge of deals and working and creatures from all walks of life. The information neatly stored itself away in his brain, which was more organized than ever before, he quickly discovered that he had nothing better to do than sort out his mind, as the task was more for filling than staring at a blank wall for days on end.</p><p>In the almost a week and a half he had spent in the cold titled room he had a new sense of power, he no longer felt tired or worn down. He felt animalistic almost a sense of hunger filling him but not for normal food. He knew it wasn't normal food he was hungry for as the leftovers petunia had dumped just inside the door had no appeal to him as they had a week ago.</p><p>He managed to stand, gripping onto the sink to steady himself and use one of the spare hair ties in the room to tie his hair into a tight yet slightly messy bun at the back of his head.</p><p>He placed his hand on the door handle, tugging it harshly. Seemingly the door clicked open as if unlocked, little known to harry he had just ripped it open with force. He would discover later just how strong his body had become at such a young age later.</p><p>As drove my an unknown force he packed his little clothing and took some of the money that was in his uncle's wallet on the mantle.<br/>
He searched the house in the early hours of the morning, collecting food and anything that may be of future use to him. Ashe picked up the food and placed it in the bag, he wondered why he was doing so, the item of fruit he held was no longer appealing to him as they were, yet he packed it anyway as it could have been the case that he was just off food at the moment in time.</p><p>He left through the backdoor exiting through a gate in the back garden and walking down the back streets winding through houses. The darkness of night covered his movements and he was almost invisible to any human eye.</p><p>He walked for what would have been hours with no seeming to tire till he reached more urban areas, sticking to the backstreets as the new light of day illuminates the English sky, he saw a place that stayed still within utter darkness though it should have been impossible.</p><p>All sunlight avoided the pocket like the plague it drew Harry closer the power of the energy surrounding the area rolled off it in waves.</p><p>He walked towards it his newly lanky limbs stumbling on the cracked concrete hands outreached in the darkness till his pale hands found a large metal Handel and he pressed down hard, pushing inwards.<br/>
The large door clicked open and slowly swung open.</p><p>He had seemingly stepped into a cafe bar type establishment. The few customers and the barkeep looking toward the small figure stumbling through the heavily warded door no human child should have opened.</p><p>Stood in the doorways harry was frozen by the image before him of men with wings and some with horns illuminated by candlelight and holding large mugs or glasses. Many in the bar had flowing robes but some had more Muggle attire the black jeans and leather biker jackets being a common look it seemed, the larger than average men all seemingly had smaller counterparts either crapped of sat near to or on them. These smaller men and women were all extremely elegant had skin that looked polished like glass, they seemed powerful yet breakable.</p><p>A young woman seemingly stepped forward from nowhere the lady would have stood around 5'8 and she wore robes that had seemingly be stitched from many layers of translucent darkness.</p><p>She leaned over to look him in the eyes her ringlets of raven hair falling down in the air, as her large yellow eyes peered into Harry's own emerald orbs.</p><p>A laugh escaped her red painted mouth, the sound of wind chimes. She then smiled at him in a way he had never seen before.</p><p>"Hello Childe it seems you have travelled far, and have not fed in many weeks, ah" she spoke silencing his questions "I can see the past in your eyes my small darkness - you will feed and regain your strength before any such conversation as the ones swirling around that mind of tours take place".</p><p>Harry desperately wanted to know where he was and what the elegant woman happened to be as she wasn't human in the slightest. He wished to tell her that he had eaten just the other day but something clicked in his mind that she didn't mean human food.</p><p>He wanted to move away, to be scared but no such fear could be found, the same feeling that had brought him here was lit with a sense of trust for the people in the darkened establishment.</p><p>He was sat down at a table and a warm drink was placed in front of him, smelling the drink and it's wonderful scent he quickly gulped down a few mouthfuls the flavours washing over his palate and he felt the slight tingle of the cinnamon and other spices on the drink at the back of his mouth.</p><p>The lady from before who was now joined by a very large man who had sandy blonde hair and pointed ears he was very muscular and stood at around 6'3 from where Harry was seated.</p><p>"My name is Diane, and this is Tovalk, my husband.<br/>
Before I explain anything, I need you to tell me your name and if you know just what you happen to be my child." The woman spoke softly.</p><p>Pausing for a moment, and think back about all of the very strange dreams he had been having and all the changes to his body without explanation. And then stopping to wonder if he should even trust this woman, he didn't know her or what her motives were yet there was just something instinctual the pushed him to trust her.</p><p>"I don't really know, but I'm not human by the looks of it, and if you don't mind my saying so neither are you miss" he spoke slowly and with caution.</p><p>The large man, Tovalk, shifted on his feet slightly, "kid, your definitely not human, you wouldn't have gotten in here if you were, and you don't smell like no human I've ever met, you have a hint of human but that's probably from living with them as I presume you have been judging your current clothing." He grumbled in a heavy deep voice.</p><p><br/>
Harry shifted in his seat slightly, with the new knowledge that he wasn't human running rampant in his mind, about where he would go and what would happen to him. How could he not be human, the Dursleys had always called him the devil's spawn, and a freak. A little demon on occasion but he didn't think they were serious. Unless they had no idea and they were in fact just evil As he though they were.</p><p>"We'll take you to the under realm, there we can do line tests and find out if you have any living relatives in your kind that would be better suited to care for your child, may I ask your age?" Diane spoke calmly.</p><p>Harry's eyes lit up at the chance of having another family in this non-human world he happened to have stumbled into. Though he was still quite apprehensive that these people who seemed like they could be trustful, they could turn out to be just like his horrible uncle and aunt. But he had to take the chance and trust his gut that these mythical people could help him and treat him right.</p><p>"I'm 10 as of around a month or so ago miss" he quickly answered.</p><p>From this statement, he gained nods of understanding from the couple across from him. As if this was logical, so he presumed that it was normal for their kind to go through changes at his age.</p><p>They ushered him along a dark corridor, where he as then wrapped in Tovalk's cloak as a feeling of darkness washed over him, and a weight of magic was added to his body, when he was unwrapped he was stood in a dark city, of what seemed to be everlasting night, the dark stone buildings and sleek stone walkways were all clean and neat. Nothing like the city they had just come from.</p><p>As he looked around he saw many different types of people, who he would later learn to be the different demonic categories, incubi and succubus the<br/>
Lilin-demons wanders the streets their allure very much clear to any who saw them, though their magic did not affect him as he was still just a child. Many other demons roamed unashamed of wings or tales of the scales that covered body parts.</p><p>-/-</p><p>Over the next year Harry aged at a faster speed than a normal child, he looks to be around 13\14 years old be the time just before his 11th birthday. He had hair now to his mid-back and he was tall and strong due to his consumption of a steady diet of blood and demonic food, he found that he craved larger amounts of blood than anyone else around him even the adults. He had continued to live with Diane and Tovalk in their home a townhouse in the underworld, he found himself safe and protected and provided for, but he knew that once he turned 11 that he would have to go to the main council and have his line tests completed, he had chosen to wait and learn all he could about himself and the world he found himself within before finding his blood family as for the time being he was perfectly content in living with his strange adoptive parents. He wanted to find it true home but he knew with the same sense that brought him here that he needed to learn the ways of the land before he found permanence on it.</p><p>He had learnt how to use the starts of his magic both wizarding and demonic by Diane. As well as being trained in hand combat, swords and other weaponry by the heavily muscular father figure. Who happened to be a blacksmith for demonic forged blades so he had plenty of practice with the handling of the most deadly of tools. He learnt how to use Glamours in order to hide his young features when in the mundane world in order not to be stopped as a child out of school.</p><p>He also found himself dressing in more demonic robes in order to fit within the community, he lived in one of the larger cities just northeast of the capital. Which looked very much like London and Manchester combined, with old tall townhouse and many back streets and alleyways. He mixed his robes with a mix of both Muggle clothing, as the two blended quite nicely together, he often found himself wearing a long flowing black grey shirt made of the same material as Diane's robes matched with a long hooded black leather jacket, full of spikes and a pair of dark skin-tight jeans. Along with heavily military boots, it allowed him to explore both cities freely, with his mixed wardrobe that showed both his current life with the runestone necklace and the many crystals on his person, some Muggle teens he had encountered described him as a hippie-goth.</p><p>Not only had be matured quickly in terms of physicaly he had also mentally aged to practically match his body, he was told that he would stop ageing when he reached his demonic transformation day in a few years time, but he ageing would slow in the next few years and most stayed looking in Thier late teens or early twenties for the first few hundred years of their life before the aging process slowly restarted for the weaker of the society but the strongest would become virtually immortal, like a close relative of theirs the vampire. Diane always liked to joke that he was part vampire because of his constant need to drink the red life source. He had a preference for human and elf blood, though the veela he had met who let him drink from her was practically mouthwatering, and he couldn't wait to meet another of the bird-like creatures, they seemed drawn to the darkness that was demons, Harry even more so apparently over though he was not close to being fully mature.</p><p>He was on this day a month or so before his 11th birthday, now trusted to cross the plains from mundane to the under realm all on his own, and he had decided to explore the wizarding alley in London, as it intrigued him the life he would have lived if his demonic blood had not taken over his small fragile body just a year ago. He emerged from the shadows and into the bustle of the street his pale light-sensitive skin that had only grown paler due to the lack of sunlight in his city he called home.</p><p>He was planning on doing some shopping as he wanted to find gifts for his temporary family as a thank you for caring for and teaching him as they had done. His hood pulled in front he wandered down the side of the street, towards a small store that seemly sold small gifts. He was caught off guard as a tall blond man with icy pale hair and a silver-headed cane stepped out of the establishment, looking down at him, and sneering slightly, to which Harry replied with a wave of dark power, he had played this game before in the darker wizarding and creature communities. He needed to admire his dominance over this clearly older male, in terms of power.</p><p>The man who happened to be Lord Malfoy stepped back slightly as this dark energy hit him with such controlled force. The look of shock and then regret was quickly covered on his face by an artful mask of cool emotions. 'who is this person?, How is he this powerful?, Is he stronger than the dark lord?' all thoughts that ran through the blond's mind.</p><p>Harry quickly sidestepped the older man and made his way into the shop, looking over the cabinets of trinkets, he lowered his heavy hood in a sign of respect to the owner of the store, and by chance showing the profile of his face to the elder Malfoy, who has apparently as equally taken back by the very pureblood and regal features of the strangely dressed teenager.</p><p>-/-</p><p>Having left the Wizarding community, with his purchase of two highly detailed carved cuffs one for each guardian. The cuffs were very high quality and would magically fit any arm size so he didn't have to worry about Diane's slender forearms or Tovalk's highly muscular ones.</p><p>He was walking down the many busy streets of Muggle London the early summer weather drawing everyone into the crowded city, walking along the cobbled stones and entering a cafe that had a darker colour scheme like he was used to he found himself in a Gothic cafe in Soho London. Talking sweetly to the Batista and ordering a large herbal tea. Moving toward the seating area of the almost modern Victorian style establishment and sitting down comfortably in the corner.</p><p>He had poured some blood into his tea and was now calmly sipping on the dark mixture, as he felt multiple pairs of eyes on his form, from a group of alternatively dressed teenagers, across the room he could already tell that one of the young girls was of the old magic, a true pagan they called themselves. It showed in her spirit, she was truly a daughter of a witch the muggles failed to burn.</p><p>Wanting to gain a reaction, to find out just how sensitive this one was to the supernatural and the forces of nature.</p><p>He pushed a line of magic towards her, slowly allowing the power to swirl in the area around her, it had been no less than a minute, till her head snapped up and looked at him directly in the eyes. Her hand raised to her neck holding a crystal that was placed there on a leather cord.</p><p>Raising an eyebrow he pulled out a crystal of his own out from under his shirt allowing it to become visible to the girl. Who had a strange expression on her face as she continued to sip her drink. Her friends clearly confused by how she was acting. The small pentagram she held tight in her palm within her pocket. Called to his magic, he had been taught the old arts and they called to him probably even more so than wizarding magic. He used crystals and blood like a wizard would a wand, he did not need to use them he could perform strongly unaided however they helped his control because of his ever-changing magic that came with young age.</p><p>Smirking slightly, he raised a hand in a half wave to the viability stress girl assuring to the young lady that he was very much real.<br/>
He had been told not to play too much with muggles as they were technically a food source, however, this was no ordinary Muggle she was of the old blood. She still practised the arts like so very few did outside of the creatures communities. She would taste amazing, however, her blood a rare opportunity that was so hard to find, blood like hers could make a demon drunk.</p><p>He had to leave, he wouldn't be able to control himself in the presence of her scent any longer, he brushed against her as he passed to leave, a trace of his magic still washed over her. From outside he could still hear her friends talking loudly about the "goth boy in the corner, staring at Hazel."<br/>
It made him laugh slightly how much the human mind concentrated on such minor things.<br/>
Anyway, as if he would find himself attracted to a human and a female at that.</p><p>
  <em>He remembered the last person he met in the human world who practised the old magical, how he ended up on the sofa in their bedroom was blurry, he had met the teen at a small gathering of darkly clad people in the city, kids as young as 12 smoking and drinking Budweiser on the concrete blocks claiming to benches in the public gardens around. But he remembered the ranting that came out of the small teen's mouth when he was recognised was a demon.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"They have no knowledge of this but their god is but a meer deity, who is in comparison powerless, I have more power in my little finger then he does in its entirety. Your people they worship my father as a god, mother always called him the Antichrist. We used to laugh about it, but it's so much worse than that he's the King more powerful than any human is dangerous."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The colourful haired pale teen sighed. Running his hands through the thick dark blue and purple dyed hair. The subject of the muggles god had come up in conversation and how the name of their god was symbolic towards the darkly dressed teenager. He thought this teen was probably obsessed with the idea of demons or had taken one to many of the MDMA pills the older teens in the city were selling.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"When we were children we were taken to get our memories wiped me and my younger brother. you can't perform an exorcism on a child who has demonic blood apparently only those who are possessed by evil, so that is the difference. We were born this way to get rid of it I remember I was five, my brother, only about 3 years old he was able to forget what he was and how can you use something if you don't know you have it."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>They sat down on the bed across from the sofa clearly tired and sad about the news that came to follow as a part of this story. He could sense the truth in the words and it if anything confused him, even more, he though the take an impossibility but then he remembered just how outlandish his own tale would sound to mortal ears.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Whereas I, on the other hand, well it never really goes away. With my brother, it's like he represents all that is good in the world he was completely unaffected by The Darkness cause when he forgot what his blood was he forgot what all evil was he's closest what's the mundane humans would call an Angel. I, however, did not forget something about being just that slight be older, knowing of my power for longer it imprinted itself into the very depths of my brain, don't you see I am a monster, you are a demon and you have no problems with it you live with them in their world. I am by all rights a prince to you if I lived in the underworld you would bow at my feet yet here you are sat on a sofa, he doesn't know, Lucifer my father will never know I who I am, I practice the old magic to keep myself safe and my powers at bay. You small one don't understand the concept of how I have lived my life with this darkness it is part of me to live with it yet not give into it, I went across that barrier or if I even touched it he would know and I don't wish to think of what would happen to me then."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Tears ran down the alabaster white face, his skin was like paper and looked just as fragile, he lived in the Muggle world with the sun and yet he was paler than any demon or vampire that Harry had ever seen.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"The child of Satan, and not only that I live amongst the muggles who hate him most, I practice the pagan ways to keep my powers at bay and live around the corner from a Catholic church. It's ironic that to add to the factors of how I've lived my life at this point the eldest child of a single mother and Lucifer's godforsaken child to add to the fact I'm transgender if I met him I would not be the son and heir he would wish I am anything but. He is known for his harshness and formalities. I doubt he would be happy with me as a child"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He had never been able to tell anyone of the boy he had met and how they were the child of the king. They had silently performed an enchantment on the young demon in which to keep his silence, he would never forget yet never be able to tell another soul without permission. The son of Satan was a few years older than him the boy is almost 16. Yet they had a mutual understanding of each other due to the maturity of the younger.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Since that day of the rant he had spent many days with the short dramatic artist, they went for walks in the woods as the elder teen explained the many paths and ways in which the mundane world worked and in turn Harry tried his best to explain the many laws and facts he had learnt of the underworld. They only saw each other every 5 or so weeks but Harry enjoyed the company, and the teen's art and dress sense along with music tastes had very much influenced young Harry towards the more alternative genres.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>More importantly, this boy was the one who taught Harry of the many identities within the terms of sexualities and gender after the young demon expressed no knowledge of what transgender was and wished to know how it affected his friend.</em><br/>
<em>After a while, Harry understood how it was perfectly okay for guys to like guys and girls to like girls and how his friend liked both but also was assigned as a girl at birth but came to terms later on that they were a boy mentally and wished to transition so his body matched his mind.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Why don't you just use magic? To change he your body to match your brain." He asked the colourful boy one day.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I haven't found or made a spell strong enough yet, by demonic blood stops all permanent changes to my body, but I can't stop the mundane synthetic hormones. So I just gotta wait for the doctors to put me on the waiting lists and to get the stuff I need."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>That night he lay in bed and almost cried, he couldn't imagine the pain and stress that his friend must feel that they are trapped in a body which they are unsatisfied with, one that would be so easy to change if it wasn't for who his father was. It hurt to witness how they refused to cross the realms how if he did and if he excepted his demonic side they could perform rituals to change him with full demonic magic.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>That's how at 10 years old Harry had met someone so strong yet so stubborn and yet so full of power and despite the possibilities, their want to be so independent might be their downfall.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And unfortunately for Harry, it would not be the last person that had this flaw within the tragedy of his life yet to come.</em>
</p><p>-/-</p><p>
  <strong>Hello again, as you can clearly see the side effect that was caused by Harry's extra powers due to the protection are yet to come Into play in his life at this moment in time, and because they are yet to fully come out, a meddling old fool still has finally realized that the child his abandoned is almost of school age, now this will cause many problems for both him and the boy who is so much closer to my realm than the average person. Human or creature, it will be ever so annoying when Dumbledore discovers Harry not being with the Humans. As you see much like Harry is watched by me, Dear Fate also has her favourites and just so happened to place one of the worse humans I have ever seen in a position of high power.</strong><br/>
<strong>But control over young Harry's life may change hands in the coming years many times, but one thing is true, he will forever be independent, and no one can take his free will away from him without permission.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Now I'm allowed to tell you a few things surrounding the mystery that is our baby demon, well you see demons have a very long lifespan it's very rare I have to send one of my reapers to collect one. As it so happens the original demon who placed the enchantment all those many years ago still happens to be alive. He also has no knowledge that the Potter line has continued this far down over that many generations.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Harry also unfortunately as one of the side effects of his powers and the type of demon he happens. To be or will one day fully become he has a high-intensity blood craving constantly in order to control his power levels he needs a heavy supply of it in his system.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>I presume I should stop getting in the way, though as many mortals say, death tends to do that.</strong>
</p><p>-/-<br/>
<br/>
He shuddered slightly as the feeling of death and it washed over him as it tended to do at random times, death seemed drawn to him Tovalk often joked, that he was probably going to end up knee deep in necromancy one day, the couple had suspicions about what he would become. The young couple had no idea of his species as they did not know anything yet of his lineage and certain types of demons were drawn to different styles of magic and were more drawn to different food types.</p><p>But due to his young age, it was still undetermined what he was. He could be a mix for all they knew much like Diane as the loving woman was part succubus part ṭelane meaning shade or an evening spirit, she was for all intents and purposes an enchantress. It had taken him months to learn all of the different types and sub-types of demons and which mythology they stemmed from the powers it came with. For example, Tovalk's father was a Jinn and thus making Tovalk half Jinn meaning he could take on different forms changing his horn shape and skin colours being a favourite talent of his as well as being able to do some forms of magic. He thinks his mother may have been an adze a vampiric demon well known to witchcraft and can take the form of a firefly, as she shows some of the characteristics of the creatures that come from Muggle African folklore but sadly he was orphaned as a young child so it's unknown to his exact bloodline, he knows only of his father given he was raised by his grandmother.</p><p>Although many types of demons did not come from folklore, religion or legends. Many came from the magic itself when extremely powerful individuals mixed a completely new line of demons were often formed, this was why the line tests were so important as the "breed" of demon you were was often based completely on your family. As many of the original demons the old friends of the demon king had relations with vampires, and elves some had wife's that were fae or even dryads. This intermixing meant that Harry could be anything and it would be impossible to determine alone without the elders and councils assistance.</p><p>Taking a swing out of his ever refiling hipflask of blood, he melted through the shadows and ended up back in front of his current home, quickly entering the tall home, and kicking off his boots, his feet padded on the cold tiles to the kitchen, where his black nails ran over counter tops and towards the fridge which was full of meat-based snacks. At first, the heavy meat diet had grossed him out slightly, the raw and slightly cooked steaks soon grew on him however and now he could help but eat them, the idea of eating large amounts of vegetables or carbohydrates disgusted him.</p><p>Which was why he was found at the kitchen table by his guardians and a few of their friends eating eyeballs with a fork out of a jar. He was the only one who liked them, everyone else found them gross but he loved the sweet texture which he could crush easily again the roof of his mouth as the iris popped and the liquid centres melted the rest.</p><p>"What!?" He exclaimed at their discussed faces. "There nice!"<br/>
Continuing to put another eyeball into his mouth and chewing slowly, washing it down with a swig of vodka. He had the body of a teenager and he might as well take advantage of the lack of hangover that came with it in his mind.</p><p>His first interaction with alcohol had been by mistake he had poured himself a glass of whiskey that was mixed with blood from a decanter in the fridge unknowing of the alcohol, and he had drunk the entire glass and another half one by the time Diane had found him giggling from drunkenness on the kitchen floor.</p><p>And with some easy lies about his age to the teenagers in the city gardens with their band shirts and rainbow hair, had led to him drinking more often than he had planned for.</p><p>All of the adults shook their heads as they grabbed drinks and then slowly moved back into another room in the house</p><p>-/-</p><p>He woke up on the morning of his eleventh birthday, a sharp pain in his head, when he reached a hand up to run it over his scalp he found two small horns at either side of his head hidden by his thick black hair the small pointed horns felt like smooth bone and where rounded to a small tip at the point. One day they would be longer and sharper he could into it. He wondered if he would wake up on the day of his birth every year with a new change to his body.</p><p>Moving up from his bed the dark covers and furs falling on to the mattress and over the side just inches from the floor. The room he had was simple he was of the same monochrome style as the rest of the house, the dark grey tonnes wood of the flooring was matched with the plush silver tones that blended themselves within the wallpaper that was on 3 of the 4 walls. He as a small ensuite bathroom that had pale marble counters and a sink carved from glass-like crystal, not the magic kind like the ones he wore, but just the plain type that was in high supply when you lived in a dimension that was completely underground.</p><p>He moved his hair back in order to inspect the new horns on his head. His hair was flowing from him in waves as the slight curls were shifted from their place on his head. The things where a pale white with black points, so that the tips would remain hidden in his hair he presumed, the black tips confused him, he had only heard of non-mature horns and antlers being white like bone or a pale grey. But he was always one to break the rules.</p><p>He moved to his wardrobe dressing smartly in full demonic garments in order to show respect to the council in which he would be meeting today in the capital, to find out his lineage and where he would spend his life until demonic maturity.</p><p>He had heard rumours that the king of hell, whom the muggles called Satan or Lucifer was in the capital at this moment in time. The dead king some called him. A true immortal blessed by death and lived in many lifetimes with many names. Pluto, Hades and the devil being a popular few for their king.</p><p>It made him think of his pale friend the boy who though his missing father was the king of hell, he hadn't seen the teen in a few moons it worried him slightly the pale child being in a worse home life than he ever had. It gave him a slightly sick feeling of warmth, he wasn't the only boy from a broken home. He would never be alone with the fact that his guardians didn't care.</p><p>The idea that he would waste his time on the council of this under-realm was humorous, but he dressed very well regardless, moving downstairs his flowing garments ghosted along the floor, the transparent yet thick material was carefully matched with leather shoulder armour and toned silver fastenings.</p><p>Diane stood in the kitchen lent against a countertop looking at him with an expression of pride, he was happy with the boy she had helped and led back to health and taught about the world they lived in, he knew that when he left her and Tovalk wanted to try for a child, she would miss having something to mother, she was a submissive in every sense of the word after all.</p><p>That had taken him a while to get used to, the submissive and dominant dynamic that all demon relationship seemingly had, apparently that was yet another thing that would be decided upon his maturity if he was the Sub or the Dom. He didn't understand the kinky connotations the titles had in the Muggle world however, he had heard of it of course he had when the girls in the city worse leather collars and fishnets and the boys on the steps sat in a larger ones lap with cat ears on and bells on leather bands around his wrists and ankles that had industrial hoops on them making it seems that he could be strung up in air with them or against the wall in some mediaeval torture room, that gave him flash backs to when he had walked into Diane's and tovalks room a while back the four-poster bed was covered in chains and leather straps, he had never seen them else were in the house and was told that items such as that should be kept in the bedroom and in private to respect everyone around them as it is a practice that requires consent and permission from everyone involved and to do it in public would be breaking that rule.</p><p>It was one of many rules that Harry was taught to do with the social world, so that despite his never leaving the house as a child other than for garden work. He would not be behind on the social and political aspects of fact he was now years beyond his fellow 11-year-olds as he doubted that they knew the effects of the conservative government on England and how people were separated based on the standard of income, his knowledge on the wizarding government was even more in-depth.</p><p>On the kitchen table sat a very large jar of eyeballs soaked in willing donated veela blood. He felt his mouth watering slightly as the large present. He looked up at Diane his eyes bright almost glowing. She nodded smiling, then shaking her head as she watched him almost attack the lid of the jar, his sharp black nails easily stabbing one of the eyeballs as he popped into his mouth the squelching noise making her visibly grossed out slightly due to the demon woman's sensitive ears.</p><p>He never understood why he liked eyeballs so much, they tasted like sweets to him, or as close to as he could get. He also secretly thought he looked really cool while eating them, that because people were a little freaked out by it he could use it to his advantage if he ever wanted to make someone uncomfortable.</p><p>He had already done it a few times to the other demonic children and a few young vampires he had met. The reaction he had gained from them was very amusing.</p><p>Unfortunately, though Tovalk snapped him out of his remembering, with a quick part to the shoulder.<br/>
The large man looked down at his small honorary son with a small smile, a look of sadness hinted in the man's eyes.</p><p>Knowing what this look meant, that it was time to go, he placed the large jar into the expanded bag that was slung over his shoulder, the simple black fabric was woven with magic and held all his books and clothing he had collected over the last year with Diane and Tovalk.</p><p>Packing all of this things had been an emotional experience, he had known he would leave the second he agreed to stay with the couple, but it didn't prevent him from becoming attached to them.</p><p>"It's time Harry," Diane said softly with the same tone of voice she had used when he had first met her.</p><p>A cold feeling washed over him and he breathed out slowly.<br/>
"I know," he said in a voice so quiet he was just above a whisper.</p><p>He felt a large arm, wrap around his torso, he lent back melting into Tovalk's front, as the blacksmith pulled his hood up, the feeling of weight filled his stomach, as he was shadow travelled across the many towns and regions of the underworld.</p><p>They stepped out of the shadow plain as a group, into the main transport room of the capital. Many people were walking around families pushing each other around and laughing, a group of teens sat on the floor against the wall in the corner.<br/>
So many colours so many people, it was almost too much for Harry to take in.</p><p>They followed Tovalk's large form as was customary within the capital for the eldest dominant to lead the group. Harry looked around in awe at the large, sculpted ceilings and ornate carvings on every wall.<br/>
They walked at a steady pace towards a large building, now in the year, Harry had known Tovalk he had seen him as a man of very few words.<br/>
<br/>
So it came as a slight surprise to Harry when the normally silent man was talking very quickly to the old demon at the desk, he was confirming there appointment he knew this, they had gone over what would happen many times.</p><p>He felt like he was walking on autopilot, one foot in front of the other, unscrew the flask, sips. Keep walking, Diane's small hand on his back, guiding him towards where it would happen, one foot in front of the other. His head of light, he could hear the muffled sounds of Diane asking him if he was okay, nodding in reply.</p><p>The sounds of footsteps echoed on polished stone floors, the sounds of heartbeats from the two adults he walked with, these things were calming and had been constants in his life for the last few months, oh how it was all about to change.</p><p>They came to a stop his robes still flowing around his legs even though he stood still an unknown wind manipulating the fabric.</p><p>They stood like that in silence, the three of them behind the dark wood doors that would lead to the room in which the test would take place. He looked up to the people that had taken care of him without a second thought, they were not demons like the muggles feared them to be if anything they were closer to the angels in which the Christians believed they fell from. When in fact the demons and they as a type of creature predated all human life on earth.</p><p>The doors cracked open as the small group walked forward, they were leading up to a small podium in front of a large curved table. Which sat around 12 to 15 people, all elders both men and women representing the different sections of their world.</p><p>A large stone dish made of a white bone-like material was placed on a Dias in-between the podium and the table.</p><p>
  <em>"Today child you have come before the elder councils, we represent the bloodlines and the families of the eldest within the demonic world.</em><br/>
<em>You wish to complete the blood test as you have no knowledge of your family or where in which you came from" a woman spoke from near the centre of the table, her hair was long and sliver it was rapped artfully over her antlers which were tall and spiralling. "Are you child sound of minds and willing and knowing of what must be done in order to complete this test?"</em>
</p><p>Harry nodded. Stepping forward, he walked up to the Dias. Bowing to the council with a low and respectful movement that had clearly been well practised.</p><p>He then stood straight, lifting up the black metal dagger which was by the side of the basin made of bone. He raised it to his palm, a chanting began in his ears. The dagger moved downwards slicing through his palm like a hot knife through butter, he allowed his blood to fill the bowl as the chanting got louder in his ears, the wound on his hand and the blood in the bowl begins to glow with a mix of colours.</p>
