    <hr/><p> </p><p>The vein that ran vertically across Severus Snape’s forehead, precisely between his eyebrows pulsed. This was the only indication that he felt the pain that the activation of his Dark Mark had caused - he was being summoned. He flicked a pinch of floo powder into the fireplace, he hissed through the fire to the Headmaster that he had been summoned and walked briskly to the apparition point just beyond the School's gates. He took a steadying breath, adjusted his cloak and donned his mask and then he rapidly turned on the spot, with the slightest crack he apparated away to his Master's side at Riddle Manor.</p><p>Voldemort's mouth twisted into what could be considered an interpretation of a smirk when he saw that his Potion's Master and one of the longest serving Death Eaters of his generation materialised. Severus bowed his head in greeting, he quickly discerned that only the inner circle was present which meant that a mission of high importance with direct orders to be assigned was about to occur.</p><p>Snape lowered his mask, as did the other individuals gathered, at Voldemort's gesture. After all, those in the inner circle knew each other’s identity so the masks were a moot point unless it was a larger gathering with lower ranking Death Eaters who had not fully proved their loyalty or trust. As Severus removed the mask his eyes met with Lucius Malfoy's, Snape thought he caught a glimpse of uncertainty in the silver eyes, but it was gone in the same instant. Severus turned his head to his Lord awaiting his commands. Upon Severus’ arrival everyone had taken their seats at the long ebony table with matching arm chairs that had green velvet padding, which could easily accommodate thirty people but the Manor had not seen a gathering of that size in some time.</p><p>"I believe Lucius can bring you up to speed on my current plan, Severus." Voldemort hissed, toying with his wand. His long, skeletal, green-tinged fingers moved in an almost inhumane way, flexing around his prized belonging.</p><p>Lucius’ skin paled by half a shade, barely visible to the untrained eye but of course his long-time friend could tell. "Yes, of course, my Lord. Our Master has decided to bestow a- a great honour upon our family, Draco in particular." Lucius paused at this, his eyebrow twitched, displaying his discomfort, Snape took this mean he was <em>not</em> pleased about this news. "Draco is going to kill Dumbledore at the school this year, and we will infiltrate the school and then the ministry once Dumbledore has fallen."</p><p>Severus nods sharply. The plan was relatively straight-forward, but Severus could immediately see flaws. It was highly unlikely that Draco would be able to do such a thing, even if he was capable of casting the curse, Dumbledore was a formidable duelling wizard and Draco was a mere child. He did, after all, destroy Gellert Grindelwald. Disregarding that fact, the Headmaster has masses of support and wands from the Staff, the Order and students, he would have a vast amount of back-up available in almost any situation. But Lord Voldemort was not a stupid man, he would also be able to identify these flaws, it then occurred to Snape that this was the point. It was a punishment for Lucius' failings at the Department of Mysteries.</p><p>"You have <em>reservations</em> about this plan, Severus?" Lord Voldemort asked, the skin above his eyes raising, if he had eyebrows they would be highly arched at this moment. The inclination in his voice seemed to suggest that he would listen to observations.</p><p>"With all due respect, My Lord, I believe that there are some flaws with the plan that could be prevented." Severus said, his head bowed in respect.</p><p>Voldemort chuckled, a high pitch sound that was sibilant. "Ah, Severusss, ever the diplomat." Voldemort hissed " I have thought upon this plan since it first occurred to me, and as much as I would enjoy seeing how Draco would <em>handle</em> the task, I have come up with a better plan. After reflecting upon the pensive memories, from you Severus, as well as Lucius and my own recollections of encounters with the Potter boy I have come to a decision."</p><p>"My Lord?" Severus, Lucius and the other Death Eater's present queried. Lucius’ pallor was returning to normal and his breathing slowed back to an ordinary pace – his relief was palpable.</p><p>"I want the boy brought to me, but not for me to destroy him. I wish for him to join our ranks, to be one of the elites." Voldemort's voice carried around the meeting hall despite him speaking at a low volume, deathly silence meeting him.</p><p>Voldemort met the eyes of each follower, using leglimency to discover their true, unguarded opinions on the matter. He often employed this tactic, sometimes aggressively or subtly like now, to gain information that he desired.</p><p>He turned his gaze to Malfoy, the aristocratic man’s mind was swimming with feelings of relief, utter and unadulterated relief for his son. In the background, thoughts were beginning to form regarding the Potter boy and Lucius seemed well aware that the boy was a worthy adversary and seemed decently skilled. Then Voldemort turned his attention to Bellatrix- she was slightly disappointed that the boy's blood would not be spilt, but perhaps others would be? Intrigued, utterly infatuated with anything the Dark Lord suggests, and then her mind began to wonder to other disturbing things. Voldemort quickly withdrew. His eyes pierced Dolohov- who was calculating the risks and benefits of such a move. Then Rabastan and Rodolphus- whose thoughts showed their immediate and unwavering support. He stared into Mulciber’s eyes- who was beginning strategic planning, considering the boy's abilities and areas he lacked in, how could he be trained? Then Travers and the others present all agreed with the plan seeing fewer flaws with it than the previous one. It seemed the only place he may meet resistance was with the lower ranks but that could easily be squashed.</p><p>He then glanced at Severus, aware of the man's excellent shields. He would only see what the man wanted him to, so he asked the question directly.</p><p>"What say you, Severus?"</p><p>"I believe, my lord, that it could be managed, however I am unsure to the extent to which the boy's devotion to Dumbledore is wavering." Severus replied.</p><p>"But it is wavering, the boy has been returned to his relatives, they abuse him Severus, I'm sure you glanced this in his occlumency lessons?" Voldemort waited for Severus' nod before he continued, "he is angry about his godfather's death, when our minds connect there is an unprecedented amount of anger and resentment, to Dumbledore and his friends. Severus, my new plan involves you as a pivotal figure."</p><p>Severus was not surprised that the alternative plan would feature him, it was of course a test of loyalty but also the better option. He inclined his head and said softly, "My lord."</p><p>"I wish for you to enter a bonding contract with him, make sure Dumbledore approves, then question the boy, sway him gently but swiftly. It is my wish Severus that you develop a significant relationship with the boy, I want him to flourish under your tutelage, he is powerful but not yet skilled. He could become a great asset. As your inclinations run towards men I am sure this will not be too distasteful for you? I am well aware of the boy’s own sexuality, I still receive flashes of his thoughts and mundane dreams" His Lord commanded.</p><p>"Not distasteful at all, My Lord." Severus intoned.</p><p>This was followed by sniggers from certain members of the inner circle, but Severus merely thrust his chin out slightly in defiance. The meeting concluded shortly thereafter, the intricacies and specifications of the plan would not be able to be discussed until the initial phases of a bonding contract had been implemented. Snape apparated away, a slight jolt of pleasure coursing through his body at the thought of his task, he shook his head and his shields locked down tightly as he made his way to Dumbledore's office.</p><p>In Surrey, Harry Potter sat up in his bed, abruptly released from his vision of Voldemort's latest rendezvous with his followers. Harry became aware of a cold sweat covering his entire body, his pulse was racing and he was trembling.</p>
