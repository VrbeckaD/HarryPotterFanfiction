  <em>Prologue</em>
</p>
<hr/><p><strong>I</strong><em>t</em> wasn’t the first time Harry Potter had felt this level of pain. It was a ripping sensation that seemed to start within his toes, and travel all the way up to the very top of his unruly mane. He often felt pains like this; they had been growing more severe since he had gone back to his aunt and uncle’s house after 3<sup>rd</sup> year. The summer had gone by at a crawling pace, even letters from Sirius and Remus seemed to make the summer go slower than normal.</p><p>The letters from Sirius were few and far between, due to the fact that he was on the run, but Harry still couldn’t help but beam every time the spiders would deliver scrunched up balls of paper to him under the cupboard door, or outside while he was in the garden. He didn’t know how the little arachnids did it, but he would quietly thank them, and gently stroke their backs. Then they would be off again, either scurrying up his arm to settle on his shoulder or within his hair, or vanish back under the door or out into the garden only to be seen bringing him small bites of food, or delivering him a letter from his friends.</p><p>Harry was thankful for them, and the spiders, he doubted with how his uncle had been this summer that Hedwig would be safe flying in and out of the window. The man had been on a war path to pound out any happiness he had from the rescue of Sirius, and make him as downtrodden as possible. He wasn’t sure why threats that his convict godfather would get them weren’t working, but he wasn’t about to step further onto his uncle’s toes at this rate.</p><p>The pain was something he had grown used to, as well as the odd feeling of stretching on the sides of his head, the growth rate of his hair had nearly tripled, and it was now hanging in a messy braid down his back. He didn’t know what was happening, what was causing his physical changes; he had grown a few inches, and was now standing somewhere around five foot seven. He was surprised with how little he had been eating that he had grown at all, but he looked surprisingly healthy. His face was now a graceful combination of arches and aristocratic features, his eyes were brighter, a calming emerald had gone to a killing curse green. He was more aggressive, more intimidating, especially when the scars from his childhood peeked from beneath his tank top. His voice was a soft but thick rumble, silky smooth; to offer comfort, but it held an underlying tone that just seemed to make people listen.</p><p>His magic seemed to be wilder, any plant he was near seemed to lean into his presence. The small creatures seemed to quietly sit near him, absorbing his energy, happily soaking him in. The insects followed him; the arachnids stalked him like a loyal line of guards. There was never one farther than a few feet from him at a time. He didn’t understand what was happening to him, he was only just turning 14, and he shouldn’t be changing like this so soon, he still had 2 years before his growth spurt was supposed to kick in at least that was what Mrs. Weasley kept telling him. He wondered if it was normal for Wizards to go through changes like he was going through, maybe he was just an early bloomer, it wouldn’t be the first time his magic singled him out to be <em>different.</em> He wasn’t sure why Mother Magic forced him to be so obviously different, he just wanted to be <em>normal</em>. He just wanted to be, well Harry.</p><p>His eyes rose to the darkening sky momentarily, <em>Mother magic?</em> Where had that come from? He hadn’t ever referred to magic as a person before, let alone his mother. In all honesty it would make sense if there was such a thing as Mother Magic; after all, magic seemed to have a mind of its own. His eyes seemed to widen, he started to dwell on what she would look like. Would she have sharp cheek bones? Would she wear a dress of gold? Perhaps long glowing milky ringlets?</p>
<hr/><p>"<em><strong>B</strong>OY!”</em> Vernon’s voice snarled through the back door, startling him out of his day dream of a beautiful woman in a long flowing golden dress, with a kind face and a soft touch. He practically leapt up, an unnatural grace that he had developed, which was not unwelcomed, he had been rather clumsy for the longest time. He whipped around to see his uncle standing there with a livid expression on his face. It was then that Harry realized that his Owl was fluttering around his uncle’s head along with a smaller more hyperactive owl, viciously pecking the man while avoiding being snatched out of the air. “<em>Get rid of this ruddy thing before I slaughter it!” </em>He snarled, lashing out at Harry as the boy approached, backhanding him painfully across the face, his fat hand causing a sharp crack.</p><p>Without even thinking a harsh snarl escaped Harry’s lips, the animalistic snarl seemed to startle his uncle, but it also seemed to induce a haze of rage. Harry prepared for the worst when he felt his uncle grip his shoulders and push his body backwards down the five steps into the house. He felt the world slow down, feeling his body grow hot, it felt like something was crawling under his skin like something was growing. When his body it the ground it hit softness, surprising him, though his face scrunched up in surprise and pain even though he was practically unhurt.</p><p>Vernon’s face was set in a sneer; his body was showing hatred that Harry figured could rival Voldemort.</p><p>“<em>Well you can sleep out here tonight, freak. I won’t have anything to do with you.” </em>He spat over his shoulder, slamming the door behind him, Harry could hear the door lock behind the hobbling fat man and couldn’t help but send a snarling hiss after him. He sat up slowly, Hedwig fluttering around his head in worry. His hand gently caressed a small patch of ground under him that was soft, his eyes drifting to a blanket of moss, it was a soft green, and it seemed to move toward his touch, it rippled up toward him, moving almost like a sprite, gently gliding into the air floating into a loose shape of a person before drifting off back into the earth, leaving no evidence it was there aside for a small patch of grass that was just a tad more lush than the rest of the lawn.</p><p>Harry stretched an arm out toward the owl as he rose to his feet. Hedwig of course landed with a puff of feathers hopping up further up her master’s shoulder to nuzzle into his cheek, making a high cooing noise as if he was an injured chick. Pig fluttered around distraught that he had caused Harry to get hurt. He returned the gesture as he always did to Hedwig, gently sliding a hand down her back with care. She cooed again happily, allowing him to untie the letter from her leg with great care as he started to walk toward the shed where he would be sleeping tonight.</p><p>He sighed deeply, thankfully Uncle Vernon had unlocked the shed, and he had more than likely already known that Harry wouldn’t be sleeping indoors tonight before he had even announced the decision to Harry. He had figured as much, Harry has spent more time sleeping outdoors on most nights during this summer than he had indoors. Not that he minded the quiet of the night always calmed his mind, the cool air on his now tanned skin made the outdoors bearable. He always felt calm in the outdoors, like the whispers of the sun touching his skin, the life of the flora in his garden made him feel whole, but sometimes he felt as if something was missing, he felt like a part of him was just empty.</p><p>With a slight shudder he let the thought drift away from his mind as he plopped down on a nest of old blankets in the corner of the shed. He smiled as he read the letter, Ron had finally replied to his other letter, with a rather in-depth reply, seeing as Ron was never the brightest when it came to letters. Typically a sentence or two did it for Ron, whereas Harry loved lengthy letters, he would write a 2 page letter to Hermione any time they wrote to each other. He guessed that just proved how close Hermione and he actually were, which made him happy to know she would be there for him. Ron always had an odd attitude toward him, he always seemed a bit off, and jealousy always seemed to linger within his gaze any time Harry got even the smallest thing. He shook his head, Ron wasn’t jealous; he had everything he needed, and a family that cared for him. Harry was just imagining things.</p><p>“<em>Harry - DAD GOT THE TICKETS - <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Ireland">Ireland</a> versus <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, Monday night. Mum's writing to the Muggles to ask you to stay. They might already have the letter; I don't know how fast Muggle post is. Thought I'd send this with Pig anyway.</em></p><p>
  <em>We're coming for you whether the <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Muggle">Muggles</a> like it or not, you can't miss the World Cup, only Mum and Dad reckon its better if we pretend to ask their permission first. If they say yes, send Pig back with your answer pronto, and we'll come and get you at five o'clock on Sunday. If they say no, send Pig back pronto and we'll come and get you at five o'clock on Sunday anyway.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione's arriving this afternoon. Percy's started work - the <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Department_of_International_Magical_Cooperation">Department of International Magical Cooperation</a>. Don't mention anything about Abroad while you're here unless you want the pants bored off you.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>See you soon –</em>
</p><p><em>Ron</em>.”</p>
<hr/><p><em><strong>T</strong>h</em>e prospect of being out of the Dursley house made Harry giddy with anticipation. Finally! He just had to make it through tomorrow and the majority of Sunday, and then he would be home free! It was a shame he always had to spend his birthday alone, but the World Cup would be a birthday present like none other! He just couldn’t wait! He could beg Aunt Petunia to let him into the house so he could pack, he already knew that his Aunt would give him that, if only because the fact he would be leaving was good enough, she didn’t care who he was going with, as long as she wouldn’t have to deal with him.</p><p>He was content to lay curled in a ball in the corner Pig and Hedwig curled up to his side; the pitter of small creatures moving in the shed was comforting. Knowing that there was life around him everywhere, even if he couldn’t see it. Even if Hedwig was staying as far away from Pig as possible, she always did dislike the energetic little thing; Harry was just content having two little companions for the evening before he had to send them off again.</p><p>His night was going surprisingly well, he had actually slept the majority of it, so with that fact alone he knew it must have been too good to be true, because when the stroke of midnight hit his body felt like it was lit aflame. He felt ripping, tearing, he felt his skin prickle like he was being prodded with thousands of needles. His mouth opened in a silent scream, sounds of distress leaving him, he felt the presence of various life forces, but he didn’t know what they were, he didn’t know what could help. His head felt like it was tearing in two, his feet were burning; his nose felt like it was fracturing like glass. His heart was pounding, wet noises of pain were escaping his throat, and he felt like his entire body was shifting.</p><p>He was rolling in his nest now, eyes open and blankly staring for something to help him, anything to ease the pain that was never ending, he couldn’t understand what was happening, he had never felt anything like <em>this</em>. Not even in his worst nightmares had he experienced this sort of pain, even when he faced Voldemort in first year, not when he faced the fear and the painful chill of the dementors. Not even the first time he told Uncle Vernon <em>no </em>when he was 8 and half crazed by pneumonia, and ended up beaten half to death and locked in the cupboard for a week. He couldn’t explain nor could he fathom why <em>he</em>, not so normal teenage Harry always seemed to end up in pain.</p><p>His hand blindly reached to find some relief in pressure, but his heart felt like it stopped when his fingers two very hard branch like forms atop his head. He felt his world shift, knowing that his body was slipping into shock, unable to handle whatever was attacking his system. His mind was short circuiting; confusion and denial were flooding his veins. Why did things like this always happen to him? Just as he started to lose himself into the pain, just as the world started to shift again he saw something he hadn’t noticed before, he saw a tall figure kneeling over him. He was so bright that Harry almost couldn’t look at him without his eyes feeling as though they were burning.</p><p>His was etched with the deepest of concern, and his mouth was set in a thin grim line, his body was tall, tanned from obvious years of exposure to the elements but still bright and healthy. His hair was long, it fell in thick chocolate ringlets well past his hips, his eyes a sharp cobalt, full of knowledge. The high points of his face was covered in a light layer of silky looking fawn colored fur, small white dots littered his face in careful patterns, looking regal and wild all at the same time.</p><p>He was dressed in nothing more than a few pieces of deep earth colored fabric covering his privates, an open cloak that showed off his chiseled chest and body, and leather belts seemed to be holding not only the fabrics on, but various knives, and a small pouch that looked heavy with something that Harry could not recognize. The most beautiful thing about the man was a large pair of thick antlers that resided atop of his head, and an equally large set that separated from the branch like antlers to curl around behind his head and curve gently to frame his face. He had long legs that were covered in the same feathery fawn colored fur, and two large hooves that supported his weight. Around his neck and arm rested a willowy Celtic torc that looked to be crafted out of gold shaped into the form of vines. The other held a massive serpent with horns of a ram; the creature seemed to be hissing in concern to its master, but for the life of him Harry could not hear what it said.</p><p>Harry’s mind had been so distracted by the man who seemed to ooze power he had almost forgotten about the pain, nothing more than a twitch showed how uncomfortable the burning was. His eyes locked with this great creature that seemed so very concerned about his general wellbeing. He wished desperately that he could understand what the great horned man was saying, for he wondered what the deep timber would sound like, he distantly wondered if it would sound anything like the voice he had been hearing throughout his dreams the past few months.</p><p>Harry unfortunately would have to wait until later to hear anything either breathtaking creatures were saying, because he watched a careful hand reach out and gently brush his bangs out of his face, and he heard nothing more than a brief whisper, a whisper he would not remember until a much later date.</p><p>“<em>Sleep child, we will speak when your pain is over.</em>”</p>
