    <p>
  <span>The first time Bill realized Charlie had a sick mind was when he was ten and Charlie was eight and he’d stumbled across a scene that would never leave his mind.  He hadn’t meant to, really; he’d been looking for Charlie to bring him in for lunch when he’d found his little brother kicking a garden gnome around in the air and </span>
  <em>
    <span>laughing </span>
  </em>
  <span>at its squeals of pain every time Charlie’s shoes made made contact its tiny body. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Charlie…?” Bill had frozen, wide-eyed.  When his brother turned around and gave him a smile so impossibly innocent, shudders went down his spine; Charlie </span>
  <em>
    <span>looked </span>
  </em>
  <span>gentle in this moment, but there was something in his eyes that told Bill the other was feeling anything </span>
  <em>
    <span>but </span>
  </em>
  <span>gentle.  “…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlie understood the unspoken words.  He shrugged at his brother before he pointed to the gnome which, by now, was laying in the long grass, gasping for breath as it twitched so terribly, Bill felt as if he could cry.  “I was just playing, Bill. Mum and dad aren’t home; I got… </span>
  <em>
    <span>bored</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bill raised his hand to his mouth, and though it took several seconds for him to reply, he mumbled, “Wouldn’t you rather play a game of Wizard Chess or something…?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlie made a show of cocking his head to the side and resting his index finger against his chin as he hummed long and loud.  Finally, he gave an unsettling grin. “Nah~ This was more fun, Bill.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Umm…” Bill was in shock.  Did he run away and hide? Tell his parents what had happened so they could handle it?  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlie, however, took advantage of his brother’s stunned silence.  A twisted expression crossed his face as he turned his attention back to the gnome and, with one calculated movement, stomped down on its head and stopped it from moving ever again.  With that, he gave a bright, childish smile as he grabbed Bill’s hand and swung their arms back and forth as he skipped back to their house. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bill was shaking, Charlie could tell.  He laughed. “Big brother, I </span>
  <em>
    <span>love </span>
  </em>
  <span>you~” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bill melted as those words were purred at him.  He relaxed, and after a taking a deep breath, he murmured, “I love you, too, Charlie…  People will think you’re sick if they ever knew about that, though…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlie’s laughter came harder.  “Do </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>think I’m sick, Bill?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bill didn’t hesitate to shake his head. “You’re my brother, and I love you, Charlie.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Bill was older and more experienced, he may have realized that the smirk crossing his brother’s face right now was anything </span>
  <em>
    <span>but </span>
  </em>
  <span>innocent, but here he was, a young child who simply believed Charlie was happy his big brother loved him in return.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What a mistake that would turn out to be. </span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>The second sign Bill picked up on was how Percy seemed to be growing more and more disconcerted whenever Charlie was around.  With their parents so busy with the twin toddlers and a new sibling ready to be born any day now, they hadn’t had much time to notice how withdrawn Percy was getting, nor the way he clammed up whenever Charlie entered the room.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Bill noticed, and since he’d been the one raising his two brothers, he took it upon himself to investigate.  He found Charlie in Percy’s bedroom when he’d let himself in one afternoon, and there he stood, mouth agape as he watched the way Charlie’s stubby fingers twisted and pinched Percy’s pale skin relentlessly while Percy sobbed and tried to back away further up his bed, only to be met with the wall behind him.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Charlie, what are you doing?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was the look of utter innocence he was met with that made Bill feel sick as Charlie fixed him with his brightest smile.  “Nothing, big brother~ Just playing with Perce.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, Percy doesn’t want to play.” Bill made his way to the bed, and he grabbed Charlie by the shoulders and pulled him away.  “Go read a book or something, Charlie; Percy wants to be alone.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bill didn’t miss the look of anger and loathing on Charlie’s face, however brief it was before it was masked by another big smile.  “Of course, big brother. Perce is boring, anyway; he doesn’t like playing with me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bill watched the younger leave before he looked at Percy.  “Percy, are you okay?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The four-year-old wiped at his wet eyes as he nodded and looked anywhere but at Bill.  “Fine… Fine…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But in ten years’ time, Bill would learn that Percy wasn’t fine, and if he had the courage to admit the truth to himself, he may have acknowledged he had a partial hand in that as he never had been able to discipline Charlie easily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of all the things that had alerted Bill to Charlie’s mental instability, Charlie refusing to go to bed unless he was sleeping in Bill’s arms wasn’t one of them.  They’d been sharing a bed for so long now, it was second nature for Bill.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>However, despite all the years they’d been sharing a bed for, Bill had never woken up through the night because of a hand that wasn’t his caressing his body.  His eyes snapped open when his brain registered the feeling of his pants being tugged at, and his hand shot out to wrap tightly around his brother’s wrist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Charlie, </span>
  <em>
    <span>don’t</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”  It was the first time Bill had ever gotten short with any of his siblings, and even now he still didn’t have it in him to get </span>
  <em>
    <span>too </span>
  </em>
  <span>angry.  “You’re my </span>
  <em>
    <span>brother</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Through the darkness, Charlie gave a sadistic smile.  “So? Don’t you do this kind of stuff at school, Bill?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bill shook his head.  “No. I don’t, Charlie, and I won’t start with you.  Go back to sleep; it’s late.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to sleep.  I want to play a game with my big brother.” From the tender age of six, Charlie had learnt how to wrap Bill around his finger.  For whatever reason, the older Weasley always seemed to melt whenever he was referred to as the big brother, and with meticulous calculating, Charlie had learnt </span>
  <em>
    <span>exactly </span>
  </em>
  <span>how to manipulate the other to get what he wanted.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bill sighed.  His grip loosened on the younger’s wrist and he gently laid his brother’s hands down on the mattress.  “If I play a game with you, you’ll go to sleep? I’m tired, you know…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlie didn’t wait for an invitation; his lips crashed hungrily against Bill’s and despite the other pushing desperately at him to get him away, he didn’t budge; he only forced himself closer and put his hand between the older male’s legs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Charlie</span>
  </em>
  <span>!” Finally, Bill had pushed him away.  He wiped at his wet lips as his eyes burned with anger and </span>
  <em>
    <span>hurt</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and he growled, “Sleep in </span>
  <em>
    <span>your </span>
  </em>
  <span>bed for tonight!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even though Bill couldn’t see it, Charlie put on the puppy dog eyes.  He murmured, “But, Bill…! I’ve never slept alone before…! Please don’t kick me out…  I’m </span>
  <em>
    <span>scared</span>
  </em>
  <span>, big brother!  There’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>monsters </span>
  </em>
  <span>under my bed!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bill wavered in his anger; exactly what Charlie was after.  The younger sneered. “…Please go to your own bed, Charlie…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlie shook his head, and he moved to curl up against the stronger body as he pretended to tremble in fear.  “I’m </span>
  <em>
    <span>scared</span>
  </em>
  <span>, though!  Don’t you </span>
  <em>
    <span>want </span>
  </em>
  <span>me anymore, big brother?  I’ll </span>
  <em>
    <span>kill </span>
  </em>
  <span>myself if you don’t!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was when the tears fell did Bill panic.  He shushed his brother so he didn’t wake their parents up before he whispered, “I’m sorry!  I’m sorry, Charlie! Please don’t cry! I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean it!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For extra effect, Charlie made sure his lower lip shook.  He wiped at his eyes and whispered, “You mean it, big brother…?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I mean it…” And despite wrapping his arms around Charlie and holding him tight, that was the night he learnt Charlie was a manipulating, sadistic little bastard – he just ignored it </span>
  <em>
    <span>completely</span>
  </em>
  <span>.   </span>
