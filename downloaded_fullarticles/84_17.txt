  <em>sooner or later it all comes around,</em>

  <em>hopefully then I will see</em>

  <em>after the people and places are gone</em>

  <em>you will come back,</em>

</p><p>It was raining.</p><p>Christmas was around the corner and the Golden Trio had never been more divided. With Ron Weasley’s new found confidence from being Gryffindor’s “King” and his tongue constantly shoved down Lavendar Brown’s throat, Hermione Granger did not wish to attend Christmas at the Weasley family home in Ottery St. Catchpole. Harry Potter was moping because Ginny Weasley was constantly around his roommate, Dean Thomas. One day he had walked up to dorm after lunch to get his stupid Potions book and found the pair making out on Dean’s bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>(What a knife to the heart.)</p><p>“Are you sure, Hermione? We could be miserable together.” Harry tried talking her out of it for the umpteenth time that week, but she stood firm.</p><p>“Harry, I do not feel like sharing the holidays with someone I cannot stand. Besides, it’s been a few years since I’ve spent Christmas with my parents. I’m sure they would love to spend time with me,” she said over her breakfast oatmeal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>However at that very moment, an owl dropped a letter in front of her plate from her parents. The disappointment etched itself in her face. They had already made plans with Jean’s sister in France. Before school had started, they asked her if she was going to spend the holidays with Harry and Ron, and she had said yes. <em>Too little, too late</em>, Hermione frowned.</p><p>“What’s that?” The female redhead sat down across from Harry and Hermione with her boyfriend.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“A letter from my parents. They already have plans so I’m going to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas,” she said stiffly, shoving the letter back in the envelope. Harry suddenly found his water goblet incredibly fascinating.</p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry to hear that, Mione.” Ginny said, reaching over to pat her friend’s hand. “I understand that you don’t want to come with us because of Won-Won and his Lav-Lav.” Her nose scrunched up in distaste. “We’ll miss you.”</p><p>Hermione pushed away her bowl and stood up. “I have to get to class. I’ll see you later, Harry, bye Ginny, Dean.” She hurried out of the Great Hall, but not before she ran into the one person she most did not want to see.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Oh, hey Hermione, how’s it going?” Ron asked, his arm wrapped around Lavendar.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She pushed past them, her book bag banging against her hip, her hair swinging back and forth as she stomped away. Hermione had arrived to Ancient Runes five minutes early, but but she pleasantly found the classroom already open. Professor Babbling was nowhere to be found, so she plopped down in the desk closest to the door and shoved her face into her hands.</p><p>Should she feel this much betrayal from her best friend? Obviously she likes him, it’s been that way <em>for</em> <em>years,</em> but he has never picked up her hints. Third year when Buckbeak “died,” fourth year with the Yule Ball, fifth year with late nights during Dumbledore’s Army, and even this year when she tried to make him jealous while using Cormac McLaggen.</p><p>(Guess he really <em>does</em> have the emotional range of a teaspoon.)</p><p>She heard the door slam shut and jolted up. Draco Malfoy stood in the doorway, leaning against the doorframe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Sorry, didn’t know anyone else would be here this early.” He muttered, moving to sit in his seat across the aisle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione shook her head, noticing his paler-than-normal face and disheveled uniform. “No problem. I just needed. . .to get out of the Great Hall.”</p><p>“Not so comfortable with the Weasel and Brown sucking face, are you?” He smirked as he pulled his book, parchment, and quill out of his bag.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione shook her head and took a deep breath before mimicking his movements. “It’s gross.”</p><p>“Anyone sucking face is gross.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You’re just jealous that Ron can actually get a girl, Malfoy.”</p><p>He fell quiet, leading her to believe she said something that rubbed him the wrong way. This probably <em>was</em> the longest conversation they have ever had without insulting the other. She had expected him to come back with some quip about Lavendar’s shrillness or something, but he didn’t speak. He leaned back against his chair, looking everywhere but her. The air in the room became stiff as Hermione licked her lips and fiddled with her quill.</p><p>“Did I say the wrong thing?”</p><p>He glanced at her quickly. “No,” he said shortly, “just don’t think anyone should be allowed to snog like that.”</p><p>She let out a laugh despite herself and nodded her head in agreement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Draco didn’t look at her again as students began to slowly fill into the classroom. Theodore Nott sat next to him and tried to make conversation. But Draco didn’t bite. He just kept replaying the two minute conversation between him and Hermione and wondered when he would <em>ever</em> be able to hear her laugh like that again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
