    <p>„Fuck!“ Harry shouted.</p><p>Head inside of a kitchen cupboard, he had turned abruptly, when something big had fluttered behind his back – thus banging his head on the shelf. Rubbing furiously at the bump-to-be, he stared at a snow owl. The bird had flown through the open window right into the kitchen of No 12 Grimmauld Place and was now sitting atop the kitchen table.</p><p>Immediately Harry was reminded of Hedwig which made his stomach twist. But of course this was not Hedwig. This one was definitely bigger – probably male – and glared most indignantly even by the standards of owls, which were all pretty good at staring and glaring.</p><p>“What happened? Are you hurt?” Ginny rushed into the kitchen, wand drawn and alarmed.</p><p>“Relax. I was just startled, no need to worry.”</p><p>“Oh… sorry.” Ginny sighed and Harry wondered not for the first time how long it’ll take them all to unwind after that horrible war.</p><p>“It’s okay, Gin… don’t you think we’re already much better at not freaking out about… bits and bobs?” he gave her an encouraging smile.</p><p>The mental healer, Harry had been strongly encouraged to see for some weeks after the war, had explained it all to him. Restlessness and being easily startled were to be expected, after what they all had been going through. Symptoms of Posttraumatic Magic Disorder the healer had called this.</p><p>“I’m not sure his name’s actually Bob,” putting her hands on her hips Ginny eyed the pompous owl curiously, “he looks more like a Reginald to me. Well, are you going to fetch that letter or not?”</p><p>She was at Harry’s place for the afternoon helping him to clear out the old house and had been busy with yet another overstuffed piece of furniture in Harry’s favourite sitting room next to the kitchen, when the owl arrived. Ginny seemed to be quite happy about the distraction.</p><p><em>Definitely not Hedwig,</em> Harry thought, removing the letter. Hedwig had nuzzled his ear and hair whenever near enough, but this one turned his head as far away as possible from Harry. <em>Could owls snarl?</em> He wondered. If that was even possible, he had the distinct feeling that this one did.</p><p>“Well, that’s… a surprise,” Harry stared at the coat of arms on the envelope which was well known to him. The Malfoys’ coat of arms. Ginny glanced over his shoulder while he ripped the envelope open. There was something slightly disappointing and even more astonishing about the name at the end of the short letter: Narcissa Malfoy had sent him a letter. An invitation actually.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Dear Mr Potter</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>It is my profound desire to express my gratitude for your invaluable support of our family during the recent trials. As these unpleasant proceedings have finally come to an end with far more lenient sentences for my son and myself, than could have been expected without your testimony, I would very much like to thank you in person for your kindness and generosity. </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Therefore I would be very honoured to welcome you at Malfoy Manor anytime this summer. Should you consider accepting this invitation, please let me know which time suits you best. Just in case you might not feel comfortable in our house, I want to add that we have a very nice pavilion in the grounds of the Manor where I usually take my afternoon tea.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Yours most sincerely, Narcissa Malfoy</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p><em> </em>“Don’t go!” Ginny said with feeling. “This woman is dreadful! How dare she order you about!”</p><p>“Ginny, don’t,” Harry said, “she’s not ordering me. It’s an invitation. Grant you, the language is a bit odd, but I guess that’s pure-blood lingo?” He grinned and Ginny relaxed.</p><p>“Well my family is pure-blood and none of us writes letters like that! I just don’t like her… and you have done more than enough for their lot. Why can’t she leave you alone?”</p><p>“She did save my life.” Harry was serious again.</p><p>“I know.” Ginny sighed.</p><p>“Would you come with me?” Harry asked. “I think that would make the visit even enjoyable. And maybe the scones are nice?”</p><p>“Those scones better be delicious,” Ginny pulled a face, “but ok. I’ll be your escort.”</p><p>“Escort. Excellent.” Harry grinned and grabbed for a quill to write his response.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Harry had moved into No 12 Grimmauld Place, as soon as the Aurors declared the old house safe which happened shortly after his 18<sup>th</sup> birthday. Up until then he had been staying at the Burrow with Ron’s family. Now he was determined to use the rest of this summer to make No 12 a proper home, which meant going through endless amounts of old stuff and to muck out most of it. All remotely interesting items and for sure everything valuable was long gone, thanks to Mundungus Fletcher. But there was still a lot of junk, especially in the rooms downstairs, where Kreacher had been hoarding mementos of the Black family. Now August was halfway over and Harry had the sinking feeling that his task would not be finished before school started again, not even with one extra month of summer holidays to go.</p><p>The board of Hogwarts' school governors had decided that this year the first day of school ought to be postponed until the first of October for most of the students. The delay gave the members of staff more time for repairs, replacing enchantments and even some improvements to the old building. Only the actual first-year students were supposed to begin by September. One month less for the older students should not cause problems for the upcoming year, as all of them had to repeat last year’s lessons anyway. Students and teachers alike accepted this decision without complaint. During the previous year some rather unfit professors had been teaching at Hogwarts and the school year had not ended with O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. exams but with a horrible battle instead.</p><p>Harry, Ron and Hermione had of course missed last year completely as had many other students, such as Muggle-borns or kids from families who resisted Voldemort’s regime. Last year had been all about improving survival skills for them – which were very important skills indeed, but not enough in terms of a proper magical education.</p><p>Whenever one of Harry’s friends felt up to it, they joined him in his new home and helped to declutter the old house. Ron, Ginny and even George sometimes just hung around to get away from the atmosphere of grief at the Burrow. Harry did not blame them for needing a break now and then. He knew better than anyone how exhausting it was to grieve and to come to terms with losses. His pain sometimes felt unbearable, especially seeing Molly and Arthur or Andromeda Tonks. <em>One day at a time,</em> he told himself, <em>just bear it, one day at a time.</em></p><p>Up until now Hermione had spent less time at his house than the Weasley siblings. When she did, she was unsurprisingly the most efficient help, clearing out cupboards and closets with her usual vigour. But understandably enough her priority for this summer was to make up with her parents, who were extremely cross with their daughter for having been shipped off to Australia under a memory charm. Her family trouble was yet another reason for Harry’s nagging feeling of guilt.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Not long after the Malfoys’ proud winged messenger had taken off with Harry’s acceptance, Ginny left for the Burrow – and Harry relaxed. He liked to spend time with Ginny, of course he did. But frankly – it was also a bit awkward, especially if they were alone. Harry could not help wondering, whether Ginny was really content with being just friends? Maybe she was disappointed, that he had made no move to hook up again? But Harry had no desire to do that, it did not feel right anymore.</p><p>Harry sighed and decided to finish clearing out that bloody cupboard, which had given him the bump. Rummaging around at the very back of the nearly empty shelf, he grabbed an odd cup… or vase… or something? A small item with nice proportions made of fine bone china, painted the wizarding way with a moving picture.</p><p>Harry stared at the picture. Three girls were looking at him, obviously sisters. Two of them were dark haired, the middle child was blonde. Although their features were very much alike, their expression was not.</p><p>The youngest girl smiled and looked good natured, whereas the eyes of the eldest were full of cruelty, rarely to be seen in a child. She pulled a face at Harry and it did not look funny at all. The blonde girl looked rather shy and insecure.</p><p>Harry was in no doubt about the three sisters’ names: Bellatrix, Narcissa and Andromeda Black. He drew a deep breath. There was no denying his entanglement with all three of them.</p><p>Andromeda he saw quite frequently, being the grandmother of his orphaned godson, whom she raised. Her recent losses gave Harry lots of reasons for guilt trips. He tried to take Teddy off her hands at least once a week for a few hours, usually at Friday afternoon. And although baby-sitting had been rather awkward at first, he had soon started to thoroughly enjoy the hours spent with his godson – at least as long as the nappy didn’t need to be changed.</p><p>Bellatrix was dead. And the only feeling he had about her death was one of pure relief. He remembered her final battle well enough and it gave him the creeps how close Bellatrix had come to killing Hermione, Ginny or Luna. He had been deeply impressed by Molly finishing her for good to save the girls.</p><p>His feelings for the third sister, for Narcissa Malfoy, were far more complicated than his compassion and love for Andromeda or his hatred of Bellatrix. Although Narcissa had never been a Death Eater herself, she was married to one, Lucius Malfoy, presently imprisoned at Askaban for his fierce support of Voldemort. And she had raised Draco Malfoy, the most arrogant prick Harry had ever met – who had become the youngest Death Eater ever, before he was even seventeen. But she had also saved his life, there was no denying that. And now she had invited him ‘<em>to express her gratitude’</em> and he had accepted her invitation.</p><p>Harry put the strange little cup on the table. What would Andromeda have to say about that?</p><p>***</p><p>“I most certainly don’t want that Sorores Cup,” Andromeda said. “You were quite right not to bring it to my home. Honestly if I never see Bellatrix’s face again, that’ll be just fine with me.”</p><p>Sitting in Andromeda’s cosy kitchen for their usual Friday lunch Harry suddenly felt a well-known lump in his throat. He admired Andromeda’s strength in coping with the fact that her very own sister had been the killer of her only daughter. <em>How could she live with that?</em> Harry suspected he would go crazy, should a person that close to him ever be so malicious.</p><p>The kitchen smelled nice and the sun streamed through the slightly smeary window above the sink… it could be quite peaceful here, Harry thought, as long as one pushed aside any thoughts about Tonks, Remus and Andromeda’s late husband Ted, all of them murdered during that insane war.</p><p> “What’s a Sorores Cup?” he asked, partly to change the subject.</p><p>“Sorores – that’s Latin for sisters,” Andromeda translated. She picked Teddy up from her lap and sniffed at the baby’s bottom. “Time for a nappy change, Master Lupin – maybe your uncle Harry will take care of that, while I heat the soup?”</p><p>Harry took the little tot from his grandma and planted a kiss in Teddy’s hair, which turned immediately a bright shade of pink.</p><p>“Look at that, Harry,” Andromeda beamed at her grandson, “just like his mum’s hair.”</p><p>Harry smiled. Andromeda’s affection for Teddy seemed to be her lifeline these days. And he could understand that very well.</p><p>“So, what’s a sisters cup then?” he asked, “is it just a memento or does it have some specific use?”</p><p>“How come you are suddenly interested in pure-blood traditions?” Andromeda raised her eyebrows but did not seem to expect an answer. “Well, anyway. It’s part of matchmaking traditions. Pure-bloods have their children’s portraits taken, all the sisters together on one cup and a candlestick for each brother.”</p><p>“Seriously?! You are joking, right?” Harry stared at her. “Cups for girls and sticks for boys – that’s unbelievably…”</p><p>“… sexist is the word you are grasping for.” Andromeda finished his sentence placing the pot with slightly more fierce than necessary onto the stove. “Of course it is sexist. You don’t expect pure-blood families to be into gender mainstreaming, do you?” Her sardonic smile gave Harry a flashback of Bellatrix. He shivered and focused on Teddy who entertained himself on Harry’s lap by repeatedly making his tiny nose grow and then shrinking it again.</p><p>Andromeda continued, “To make sure that their blood will not be tainted by unpardonable marriages to Muggle-borns, werewolves and what not, pure-bloods pair off their kids pretty early. They have Sorores Cups and Filius Sticks painted and put them on display. So whenever one family visits another they see who is available for their own kids.”</p><p>Harry shook his head in disbelief. “And these arrangements are binding?”</p><p>“They certainly used to be for our parents and grandparents. My generation was the first to experience some kind of freedom in choosing their spouses,” she grinned at Harry, “and look what I did.”</p><p>“Is it still done today? I mean, the pure-blood kids at school, are they all spoken for?” Harry asked incredulously.</p><p>“Don’t be daft, Harry, of course not. The Weasleys are pure-bloods but Arthur and Molly would never do such a thing. It might be different for kids from very traditional families, though. I assume their parents let them know what they expect, but I cannot believe that many a kid today is as obedient as Narcissa used to be.”</p><p>Harry stared at her. She did not rule out the possibility that someone like – let’s say Draco Malfoy, just for an example – might already been spoken for? The thought alone was stomach-churning. Harry shook his head in disbelief.</p><p>“I can assure you, it was not Narcissa’s idea to marry Lucius. He had quite a reputation even among pure-bloods.” Andromeda tasted the soup and then waved her wand to add some herbs she grew in little pots, standing at the windowsill.</p><p>“We were actually quite close as kids, Narcissa and I. But as soon as I ran off to marry Ted, she broke all ties to me, as the rest of the family expected her to do. She was never very courageous and after my so called elopement, she was watched and directed even more closely by our parents,” Andromeda sighed. “You know what, I even felt guilty for a while when she got married… made me wonder whether my support might have given her the courage to refuse… I fear my marriage had put even more pressure onto her.”</p><p>“You are surely not responsible for her decision!” Harry protested.</p><p>“No, I am not. But still… she had to pay the price for her choices anyway. And I am not talking about Lucius being imprisoned,” she hesitated for a moment before going on, “Considering Lucius’ feelings for women this was under no circumstances ever going to be a happy marriage.”</p><p>Before Harry had a chance to ask her, what she was hinting at, Andromeda turned around and waved her wand to make pot, plates and spoons set themselves at the table while asking, “Why don’t you give the cup to Narcissa when you have tea with her at the Manor? You will have to bring her some gift anyway, if you want to prove your manners,” she added with a smirk.</p><p> “How… why?” Harry gasped. “You know about that invitation?”</p><p>“Well… we started to talk to each other again on the Floo some time ago,” Andromeda seemed a little bit reluctant to confess to that. “It all started with a note of condolence she sent me after the war… and I had the feeling she meant it. She is… Narcissa is not a bad person, Harry. I am glad you accepted her invitation and before you ask – it was her own idea to invite you, not mine.”</p><p>Andromeda reconciling with her remaining sister – that certainly came as a surprise. Harry did not know what to say, so he started spooning excellent soup instead.</p><p>“I see you reserve the nappy change for pudding,” Andromeda grinned picking up her spoon as well. “But do not hope I will forget it’s your turn to do it.”</p>
