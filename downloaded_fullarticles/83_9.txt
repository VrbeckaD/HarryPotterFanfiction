    <p align="center"><em>Home is where I want to be</em><br/>

  <em>~</em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Narcissa Malfoy stepped through the Floo flames, using her clutch bag to dust at her satin pencil skirt. As the verdant glow dissipated from around her, she inhaled sharply and revelled in the long-familiar scents of wood polish, ancient stone and rose water. She was pleased that the house-elves had continued her tradition of permeating her favourite scent throughout the Manor, even if she hadn’t stepped foot in her home in almost six years. Lovely, loyal creatures. Maybe there was something to be said for this newfangled attitude of respect and freedom, if this was the result.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>She let her gaze sweep over the formal sitting room that housed the main Floo connection fireplace, taking in the rich velvet upholstery of the settees and wing-back chairs. The ancestral portraits on the walls all watched excitedly, no doubt ecstatic to have the Malfoy matriarch back within the Manor walls.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>A small movement to her right caught her eye and she swung her gaze to the vaulted passage that passed into the vestibule. Framed in the doorway was a rangy, hard-eyed man with a shock of almost-white hair falling into his eyes. She smiled broadly at her son, opening her arms to him and delighting in the shift of his shoulders as he restrained himself from running to her. </p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Draco, darling, come give your mother a hug.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Several long-legged strides later and he hugged her, a quick squeeze around her shoulders before he stepped back and regarded her. She mentally catalogued the dark circles under his eyes, the greyish tint to his pale skin and the palpable feeling of exhaustion that hung on every sharp contour of his form.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Welcome home, Mother,” he drawled, sweeping a long arm towards the nearest sofa. </p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>She smiled at him, patting his cheek as she slid past, and sank into the plush velvet. Toeing off her pumps, she propped her feet on the gilded coffee table and grinned. How Lucius had hated when she did this. A mark of poor breeding, he had called it. She had been so careful back then to erase all the casual quirks of a life with two energetic sisters and doting parents, moulding herself into the perfect Pureblood hostess and wife. Now six years on her own, far away from anyone who knew anything about her, and all those quirks had come back as if they had never left.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Draco folded himself into the chair across from her, hooking one leg over the other and rubbing at his face with the heel of his palm. </p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“You look tired,” she said, her voice conversational as she picked at a piece of lint on her skirt. She could see him narrow his eyes at her from under her lashes.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“That’s because I am.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“No need for me to ask why,” she continued, lifting an exquisitely sculpted eyebrow at him. “The gossip rags have kept me well abreast of your nighttime...activities.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Vultures, the lot of them,” he grumbled, tipping his head back onto the edge of the chair and glaring sulkily at the ceiling.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Really Draco, what do you expect? It isn’t as if you are discreet.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“It’s none of their damned business.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“I’m not going to fight with you,” she admonished, her voice smooth as she watched him. “I’ve been back for all of two minutes and I find I’m rather tired myself.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“The Portkey from France too strenuous? Most activity you’ve seen in six years?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Her silence made him raise his head and he flinched at her cold look. Shrugging lightly, he grimaced. “Sorry, Mother.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>She felt the gulf between them like a wound, unsure how to navigate these new waters. Their communication over the past six years had been mainly by owl, with sporadic visits once his travel restrictions had been lifted three years ago. She hadn’t even come home when he had been released from Azkaban a year after the war; she had not been in a good place back then, but that was no excuse.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“You will not insinuate that I did nothing in France but lie about like a useless heiress, Draco Malfoy,” she reprimanded, her voice as hard as steel. “You know very well that I devoted my time to fundraising for worthy causes and kept myself busy.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“I know, Mother. I am sorry,” he sighed, massaging his temples with his fingers. “I just wish you would understand that what I do is also keeping me busy.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>She laughed, the sound a sharp crack in the stillness of the room. “Drinking yourself into a stupor and sleeping with any witch with a warm pulse isn’t exactly what I had in mind when I told you to occupy yourself with something when I left.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Yes well, you left didn’t you?” His voice whipped across the space separating them, making it her turn to blanch. “What I do with my time is no longer your concern.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>The coldness in his voice made her flinch, her eyes cutting to his face. His handsome features were twisted in a dramatic scowl. She sighed, closing her eyes and wishing fervently for the patience to deal with this insufferable man-child she had birthed.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“You and your time will always be my concern, Draco,” she said, her tone warm. “But really, I don’t want to argue. I’m excited to be home.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Yes, Mother.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>She watched him silently, her eyes tracking down the long length of his body as it lounged against the chair. She felt a hitch near her heart as she thought about the boy he had once been.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Did you bring that list I asked for?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>He straightened in his chair, reaching into the inner breast pocket of his jacket and pulling out a rolled parchment. Leaning forward, he offered it to her. She took it from him and unfurled it, letting her eyes track down the neatly transcribed text.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Thinking of continuing your fundraising activities here in England?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Yes, of course,” she said, never taking her eyes from the parchment. “And it looks as if Malfoy Enterprises gives generously to a good variety of worthy causes.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Yes, well, I think you will find that most of those are court-mandated as part of my sentencing,” Draco drawled, his eyes back on the ceiling.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Be that as it may, they are still worthy causes,” she said, tapping her finger lightly on the parchment. “Like this one; who can find fault with donating to a home for war orphans?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>He grunted, shielding his eyes with his hands. Narcissa rolled her eyes and scanned the rest of the scroll, before rolling it up and tapping it lightly on her thigh.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“What do you know of it?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Other than that it’s a home for scrawny brats and is run by the resident Muggleborn Princess of the Golden Trio? Nothing.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Oh! Miss Granger runs the home? How delightful,” Narcissa said, a smile blooming across her aristocratic features. “It must be a very orderly and well-run establishment, then.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“She probably nags them all to death.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“You would do well to pay attention to Miss Granger, Draco,” she admonished. “That is a witch who keeps herself busy.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Something tells me she wouldn’t appreciate my attention, Mother,” he drawled, still covering his eyes with a limp hand. “Being that she was tortured right over there.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>He waved a hand towards the far end of the drawing-room and Narcissa let her gaze settle on the patch of stone floor beside the fireplace. A dark memory slid into focus and she shook it off, refusing to give it a toehold within her mind.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Yes, I think that will do very nicely,” she mused, watching her son. “I will offer my fundraising services to the...what was it, oh yes: The Remus Lupin Home for War Orphans.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>She could have sworn she heard him curse under his breath and when she asked him to repeat himself, he straightened and glared at her.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“I said bugger that,” he growled, waving away her affronted sniff. “Bunch of skinny, saucer-eyed waifs with their hands out.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Draco darling, the war was over six years ago,” she laughed. “I’m sure they’ve been fed well in the meantime. We’ve been giving quite generously, they can definitely afford food.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>He grunted and she rolled her eyes.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Besides, many of those orphans are the children of people we knew once.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“People we knew once?” His voice hitched an octave and she noticed that a tremor shook through his hands as he clenched them in his lap. “Is that how we refer to them now?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>She didn’t answer and he dragged a trembling hand through his hair.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Death Eaters, Mother,” he barked, his eyes bright and wild. “They are the children of Death Eaters. My former compatriots.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“They are just children, Draco.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Their parents made their choices,” he grumbled, shifting uncomfortably in his seat.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Do the children deserve to suffer for them?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Bit late to ask yourself that question, isn’t it?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>She sucked in a breath at the clipped question, flinching at the rage roiling beneath his measured tone. He grimaced, waving an apologetic hand towards her. She grit her teeth and willed her eyes not to water. </p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“I find myself wanting to help, Draco,” she whispered, her eyes never leaving his face. “We...your father and I made those same choices at one time. I have been gone so long...but now I am home and I find myself needing to help.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>He regarded her for a silent moment, his gaze unreadable, before nodding. His sharp, patrician features looked blurred behind a mask of exhaustion and alcohol, his normally incandescent eyes dulled with a haze of long-untended pain. A memory of him as a small boy, his face tipped up to her and his pudgy little hands grasping her skirt flashed across her consciousness and she blinked. </p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>As he gave a heavy, defeated sigh, Narcissa felt a knot slide into her throat and she wondered how long before she could escape to her chambers and cry herself to sleep.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>//</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hermione set the packet of paperwork down on the desk in front of her and rubbed furiously at her eyes, willing the knot of anxiety behind her temples to lessen. She sucked in a deep, shuddering breath and exhaled, visualizing the stress leaving her body in one, sustained rush. She tracked her breaths for a moment, centring herself around the push and pull of her lungs, before opening her eyes to the bright mid-afternoon sunshine. The sound of childish laughter filtered in through the opened glass-paned doors that led into the back garden. Susan must have opened the windows of the schoolroom on the floor above.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hermione listened for a moment, unable to stop herself from smiling fondly at the sounds. It made the tension fade from her shoulders and she turned her attention back to the paperwork in front of her. She dragged her finger across the top parchment, smiling softly at the word <em> Hogwarts </em> splashed audaciously in curled calligraphy across the top. Memories rushed through her, of wool robes and striped ties, the smell of the library and the certain sharp bitterness of Madam Pomfrey’s potions.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>She still could not quite believe that, next month, she would have two charges leaving for Hogwarts. When she had created Lupin Home in those early days of grief and pain and anger after the War, she could not have imagined any of those haunted-eyed children ever reaching the age to attend school. They had been brought by Aurors to her doorstep; found in the rubble of homes, in locked away hidey-holes, wandering alone in the forest. All of them came bearing scars of some sort, be they physical or emotional. In those first months, it was all she could do to keep them alive and communicating. Each day was a struggle and each night they closed their eyes in sleep felt like a small victory.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>And here they all were, six years later. A handful had been adopted, to her great joy, by wonderful Wizarding families. But there were still ten of them under the roof of The Remus Lupin Home for War Orphans. Ten children from both sides, from families who supported the Light and the Dark. And it was her greatest triumph, the only accolade she was proud to boast, that they all lived as brothers and sisters and treated Hermione as their mother-figure. </p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>She smiled to herself as she dipped her quill in the ink-pot and wrote ‘Benjamin Porterfield, third-year’ and ‘Olivia MacDonald, first-year’ in her neat script at the top of the page. The two eldest orphans had come to Lupin Home within weeks of each other, immediately after the war. Both sets of parents had been killed in the fighting; Ben’s parents as supporters of Voldemort and Olivia’s as Aurors. Neither had any extended family willing to take them in, so they had been brought to Lupin Home, one of several orphanages scattered across the country that had opened to fulfil this new and urgent need. Ben had come first, just days after Hermione had opened their doors. </p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>She remembered him as he had been then; a scrawny, terrified seven-year-old with a tear-stained face and furious eyes. They had found him cowering behind a tapestry in the family home; whoever had been left to watch him had been long gone. He had fought like a hell-cat, kicking and scratching the poor Aurors in the department waiting area. </p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Ben hadn’t been the last orphaned child to cry himself to sleep on the upholstered benches of the Auror Department. The problem multiplied and Kingsley had approached her, his dark face strained with worry, to ask if she could come up with a solution.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“You’re the Brightest of us all, Hermione,” his deep voice had rumbled as his eyes tracked the tears sliding down the latest orphan’s cheeks. “What should we do?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Orphanages had been the obvious answer, but she had assumed the task of running them would be delegated to people who actually knew something about children. She had spearheaded the effort to gather funding and create plans. When Kingsley had asked her to take charge of the London orphanage, she had felt something tug inside her chest.  Hermione knew she was lost the minute Ben’s little arms had wrapped around her neck, his hands fisted in her curls. She couldn’t leave the children.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>The Death Eater trials had been running at full tilt that Fall; sentencing and reparations were all anyone could talk about. For those who were lucky enough to escape Azkaban, the Ministry levelled hefty fines as recompense. Much of the money went to the rebuilding efforts and Auror pensions, but some of it went to the care of war orphans. And that’s how Hermione Granger found herself in charge of a clutch of frightened, traumatized children and the new tenant of a building owned by the Malfoy family.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>She dipped her quill back in the ink-pot and moved to the next line of the form. The entire building was a perfect confection of 18th-century London townhouse, with beautifully appointed rooms and tasteful, comfortable decor. She had to give credit to Malfoy Enterprises; they had been so desperate to repair their image in the years after the War, that any request was approved, any renovation finished with extreme haste. She couldn’t help letting her gaze wander across her sun-drenched office; the high ceiling with its wedding-cake plasterwork, the pale yellow striped wallpaper and cream wainscoting, the immense glass-paned doors that opened onto a sunny back garden terrace. She glanced at a pink velvet sofa tucked against a far wall and grinned at the small child curled against one of its arms. </p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>His blonde ringlets fell across a wide, smooth forehead and one pudgy arm extended behind him, his small fist opening and closing with each breath. She felt her affection for him rise within her chest, swamping through her veins as she watched him sleep. </p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Footsteps at the terrace door made her swing her gaze around and she grinned at the small girl-child framed in the open doorway. Also blond, with looping curls that hung in perfect ringlets down her back, she was a dainty child, with ruddy, freckled skin and large blue eyes. She padded into Hermione’s office, her feet bare and a well-worn book tucked under her arm.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“There he is,” the girl said, her eyes cutting disdainfully to the sleeping figure of her brother. “We were all wondering where he’d gone off to.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hermione smiled indulgently, glancing back at the boy. “He crept in here an hour or so ago and promptly fell asleep, the little dear.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Little dear, my foot,” the girl scoffed. “He took my quill this morning and drew Firebolts across every page of my maths work.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Sounds very much like a five-year-old, wouldn’t you agree?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“That’s no excuse. I don’t act like a seven-year-old, so why should he have to act his age?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hermione blinked, momentarily stunned by this logic. This little creature always seem able to do that, render her completely speechless. She wasn’t sure how she managed it.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Marigold Elizabeth Greengrass, you know perfectly well you have talents your brother does not have at this time of his life,” Hermione admonished. “Must I remind you what <em> you </em> were like at that age?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“I would rather you didn’t,” the girl responded, wrinkling her small nose in distaste. </p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hermione chuckled, rolling the parchment in front of her and placing it in the ‘To Be Owled’ canister at the end of her desk. She pushed her chair back and regarded the girl, her eyes dancing. “Why aren’t you with the other children, Mari?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Ms. Bones let me go early because the others were doing their maths and the younger ones their reading comprehension,” Marigold said, crossing the room to perch on the chair in front of Hermione’s desk. “I finished my maths last week and everyone knows I don’t need help with reading comprehension.” She laid her book in her lap. “So I took my book into the garden.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hermione smiled indulgently and nodded, struck once again by how much this child reminded her of herself as a girl. “What are you reading now?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“A rather dry account of the War,” Mari said, holding up the book. “I borrowed it from Benjamin, he brought it back from Hogwarts last term.” When Hermione didn’t respond, she set the book back onto her lap and cocked her head. “Will you tell me about the war?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hermione sucked in a sharp breath, feeling the familiar fluttering of panic begin behind her ribs. She forced it down, flexing her fingers on her thighs. She had this conversation with Benjamin two years ago, on his first holiday home from Hogwarts. She had expected to have it again with Olivia this Christmas; she was not prepared to have it with a precocious seven-year-old, with her five-year-old brother sleeping behind them.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Where on earth have you heard about the war, Mari? Other than in the book you swiped from Benjamin.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Oh, everyone talks about it,” the child said, waving a small hand to encompass everyone. “Just not in ways they think children notice. But I notice.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hermione slumped back into her chair, rubbing at her forehead with shaking fingers. “Of course you do,” she groaned. “Merlin defend me from swotty seven-year-olds.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Uncle Ron says I am just like you were when he met you,” Marigold said primly, her eyes never leaving Hermione. “Why don’t you want to talk about the war?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Because it was a very painful time,” Hermione hedged. “What do you know about it?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“I know that it was the good guys against Voldemort, who wanted to get rid of anyone who isn’t Pureblood. I know that there was a battle at Hogwarts and Voldemort was killed. Is it true Uncle Harry killed him?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hermione tipped her head back against her chair and willed herself to stay calm. How the hell was she supposed to explain this to a child? If it had been any of the other smaller children in the Home, she would prevaricate; but she knew that would never go over well with this particular child.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Yes, it’s true,” she said softly, straightening in her chair. “Harry battled Voldemort and destroyed him.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Is it true Uncle Harry was The Chosen One?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hermione chuckled softly, shifting in her seat. “Don’t ever let him hear you call him that, he hates it,” she said. “But yes, it’s true.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Mari’s brows furrowed and she looked decidedly unimpressed. “But Uncle Harry is so...<em> normal </em>.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hermione laughed outright at that. “He has worked very hard to be normal. After spending most of his childhood as someone special, he felt like he had earned it.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Is it true he would have died to save everyone?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>The humour drained away from her and Hermione blinked slowly, her breath stuttering softly in her chest. “Yes,” she whispered. “That’s also true.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Mari sat quietly for a moment, thinking over all that Hermione had confirmed. The birds in the trees outside continued to sing and the sudden shouts of happy children filtered down from the classroom above. <em> Susan’s class must be done, </em> Hermione thought.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“I wish my parents had fought on the right side,” Mari said, her voice soft.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Oh, darling,” Hermione breathed, reaching a hand across her desk and laying her palm up for Mari to take. Her small fingers wrapped around her own and Hermione squeezed them gently. “Not everything is black and white, especially not war. Your parents thought they were on the right side.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“I wish I could remember them.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“I know you do, Mari,” Hermione said, keeping a firm grip on the girl’s hand. “Maybe someday we can find someone who knew them to tell us some stories about them. Stories about their lives that don’t have anything to do with Voldemort or war.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“What kind of stories?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Like what their favourite ice cream was, or if they liked Quidditch.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Ugh, I’m sure they didn’t like Quidditch, it’s such a bore,” Mari groaned, slipping her hand away from Hermione’s.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hermione laughed, settling back into her chair. The sound of shouting children much closer than the floor above cut through her laughter and she swung her gaze to the door of her office as it opened. Susan Bones slipped in, her face turned to the hallway behind her as she laughed and waved at a clutch of running children as they raced past towards the back garden.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“You lot keep it down!” Susan shouted and she laughed as a chorus of “Yes, Miss Bones!” sing-songed back as they burst out into the sunshine.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Goodness, they’re all in top spirits today! Must be this glorious weather,” she chuckled as she shut the door behind her. </p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hermione grinned at her former classmate and friend, motioning to one of the chairs pulled up to her desk. Susan dropped into it, making an exaggerated display of her weariness. She smiled at Mari and winked, laughing gaily when Mari grinned back at her. </p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Susan had been with Lupin Home since the beginning, working as Hermione’s assistant and teaching the underage wizarding coursework in preparation for Hogwarts. Not for the first time, Hermione wondered what on earth she would do if it wasn’t for Susan.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>The noise of the children in the garden made the small boy on the pink settee stir fitfully. Hermione watched as he uncurled himself and rubbed at his eyes. His curls here matted against his forehead and his cheeks were a delicious rosy shade. <em> He really is such a gorgeous child </em>, Hermione thought.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“‘Mione?” </p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Here, Henry,” she said, holding out an arm towards him. She watched as he slid down from his makeshift bed and padded across the office. He ignored his sister and Susan, heading straight to Hermione and clambering into her lap. He curled himself against her, sticking a small thumb into his mouth.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hermione smiled softly at the warm weight of him in her lap, running her fingers through his curls. “Good nap, love?” she asked, her voice soft. He nodded, never removing his thumb. Across the desk, Mari scoffed and rolled her eyes. </p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“He is such a baby.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Henry, his pride wounded, sat up straight and popped his thumb from his mouth. “Am not!”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Are too, you little thumbsucker!”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Susan laughed, poking a finger at Mari. “I remember <em> someone </em> at five who used to suck her thumb and drag her ratty quilt behind her wherever she went.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Mari turned her nose up, her gaze dripping with disdain. “That is completely different.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hermione and Susan laughed as Marigold slid from her chair and walked out into the garden, her head held high. </p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Oh, Merlin, we’re going to have our hands full with that one,” Hermione laughed, her arms tightening around the small boy in her lap as she grinned across the desk at Susan. “That pureblood pride must be bred into the DNA.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Susan straightened and her expression changed from laughing to somewhat serious. “Shit, Hermione, I forgot,” she said, wincing as she threw an apologetic glance towards Henry. She regarded Hermione over the desk, her mouth twisting with uncertainty.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“There’s a visitor for you at the Floo,” she said, her voice wavering slightly. “Mimi caught me as I was coming down and asked if I could fetch you.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“You’re starting to make me worry, Susan,” Hermione chuckled, but the laughter faded when she saw how Susan’s hands twisted in her lap. A sudden shock of apprehension swamped her chest and she inadvertently tightened her hold on Henry. “Who is it?” </p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“You’d best come and see for yourself,” Susan sighed, holding up a hand to forestall Hermione’s protest. “I’m hoping if I don’t tell you, I’ll end up being wrong and it was all a terrible daydream.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>~</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>It was only years of hard-fought self-discipline that kept Hermione, as she strode into the large sitting room, from turning on her heel and running away. Instead, she felt her eyes widen in surprise and she had to grip the back of a chair as she levelled her gaze on Narcissa Malfoy. The older witch stood before the wide hearth, clad in tasteful cream robes, her platinum hair pulled away from her face in a classic french twist. She looked every inch the Pureblood matriarch. Hermione thanked all the Gods and Merlin for whatever had made her pick out the tailored black sheath dress that morning. Paired with her black patent flats, she knew it fit her well and looked much more expensive than it actually was.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Ah Miss Granger, there you are,” the older witch said, her voice a measured cadence. “I was hoping to have a bit of your time this afternoon.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hermione blinked slowly, her mind buzzing with possibilities and reasons. What on earth was she doing here? She wanted to scream at her, push her back into the Floo and demand at wand-point that she never return. Instead, she smiled politely and motioned towards the sofa. Rounding the chair, she folded herself into it and watched as Narcissa sat gracefully across from her. Glancing back, Hermione realized that Susan had disappeared. The traitor!</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Mimi,” Hermione said, her eyes snapping to the petite house-elf who immediately popped into view at her elbow. “Would you please bring us some tea and biscuits?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Yes, Miss Hermione, right away!” The little elf disappeared and Hermione felt a surge of satisfaction as she noticed Narcissa’s confused glance.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“I confess, Miss Granger, to be surprised at your use of house-elves.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“It’s quite alright, Mrs. Malfoy,” Hermione drawled, crossing her ankles and smoothing out her dress. She took the moment to calm her nerves, gathering her confidence around her like a cloak. She refused to let the Malfoy matriarch intimidate her.  “Mimi is a free elf and is paid a living wage.” As Narcissa nodded, Hermione couldn’t help a small, vindictive smile from blooming. “And besides, people often outgrow the radical views of their youth once they gain some maturity and appreciation for...nuance.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>She felt a thrill as Narcissa stiffened slightly at the implication. The older witch nodded her head distractedly as Mimi returned with tea, and they were served in silence. Hermione took a sip of her tea, waiting for the other woman to state her reasons for coming to the orphanage.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“I have been living in France since the War,” Narcissa began, setting her teacup and saucer onto the table beside the sofa before folding her hands demurely in her lap. She watched Hermione with wide, curious eyes. “In the past six years, I have busied myself with fundraising for various worthy causes in France, raising funds and holding galas, creating donation funds for charities of all sorts. Now that I’ve decided to return home, I find that I do not want to give that part of my life up. I would like to continue in much the same vein here in England.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“I assume you mean for Lupin Home.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Yes, of course. I would like to volunteer myself to fundraise for the orphanage.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Why?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Narcissa blinked at her, seemingly at a loss for a moment. She collected herself and smiled softly at Hermione. “I enjoy it. I’m very good at it.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Is that all?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“I want something worthwhile to occupy my time,” she said, taking a biscuit from the tray Mimi had set before them. “Something that might lessen the stain on the family name.” She took a dainty bite and smiled faintly as she chewed. “Goodness knows Draco can’t be bothered.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Yes, I’ve read the stories about his escapades in the Prophet,” Hermione said, her nose wrinkling with distaste. “He has certainly led a...colorful life since the War.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>A faint blush bloomed high on Narcissa’s cheekbones and her teacup rattled against the saucer as she brought it to her lips. “He has had a difficult time acclimating to life since his release from Azkaban,” Narcissa said softly. “I do not agree with everything Draco does, but he is my son and I love him.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“I’m sure pointing out that he has been out of Azkaban for four years wouldn’t help,” Hermione said, her expression thoughtful. “But it remains the truth. What does your son think about your sudden interest to involve yourself with charities run by Mudbloods?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Narcissa stilled, her knuckles white from the tight grip on her teacup. Hermione waited for her to compose herself and watched as the other woman took a careful sip. The tension in the room was so thick she could practically taste it, and for some reason, Hermione found herself very interested in Narcissa’s answer.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“My son doesn’t show much interest in anything other than firewhiskey and women, Miss Granger,” she said, her words quiet. “Our relationship is...strained, for lack of a better word. I have been away so long and he has been alone with his troubles. He will not interfere.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“I don’t mean to pry, Mrs. Malfoy,” Hermione said, her compassionate nature overriding her dislike of the Malfoy family. This woman was obviously hurting, as any mother would, over her son’s behaviour. “I just want to make sure that your son won’t come barging into the Home ranting about blood status in front of the children.”</p><p>Narcissa laughed softly, her fingers plucking at her skirt. “I don’t think we have to worry about that,” she chuckled sadly. “Draco doesn’t get worked up about much of anything these days.” Her shoulders slumped minutely and she seemed to collapse in on herself before she pulled herself upright, her expression shifting until it was as clear as glass. “I assure you, Miss Granger, that my intentions are good and there will be no trouble for the Lupin Home from the Malfoy family.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hermione watched the older witch for several moments, mulling her words over in her mind. Something instinctively told her that Narcissa was telling the truth; that there was no nefarious purpose here. If she was honest with herself, all of her previous ire for this woman had faded away when she had lied for Harry. All that remained was a wariness that perhaps time and proximity would lessen.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“All right, then, Mrs. Malfoy,” she said, her head cocked slightly as she peered across the rim of her teacup. “What do you have in mind?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Narcissa’s face lit up and Hermione watched as a large smile slid across her patrician features. “Oh, I am delighted you are considering accepting my offer, Miss Granger! Absolutely delighted,” she laughed, shifting excitedly in her seat. Her girlish excitement seemed to wash away all vestiges of her previous pain. “I had thought perhaps we could throw a gala, a big, beautiful, ridiculous New Years Eve Gala with all proceeds and donations going towards Lupin Home.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hermione blinked, processing the witch’s words. “A gala?” Her voice sounded high-pitched and worried so she cleared her throat hastily. </p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Oh yes, my dear,” Narcissa trilled, her eyes bright with a feverish glee. “I am rather good at galas. We can hold it at the Manor and it will be the social event of the year.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hermione pushed down the spike of fear at the mention of the Manor. Her gaze swung to the door as Susan stepped in, her eyes wide as she regarded the two seated witches. It was very apparent that she had been standing on the other side of the door listening, but neither Narcissa nor Hermione said a word. Narcissa’s mouth quirked upward and she turned her gaze back to Hermione.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“I am interested in hearing more about this idea, Mrs. Malfoy,” Hermione said, her voice hesitant. “Would you like to stay for dinner and meet the children?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Narcissa agreed enthusiastically and Hermione excused herself and Susan to go round up the children. As they stepped into the hallway, she shut the door quietly behind her and leaned against it, suddenly boneless. Susan slumped against the wall across from her, wide eyes trained on Hermione’s face.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Merlin’s balls, Hermione,” Susan breathed. “Did you just agree to let <em> Narcissa Malfoy </em> throw us a gala?”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“I think I did,” Hermione whispered.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“In Merlin’s name, <em> why? </em>”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p><em> The question of the hour </em>, Hermione thought. Why did she suddenly want to take Narcissa up on her offer? She knew that part of it must be because she inexplicably felt sorry for the older witch; married to a monster like Lucius Malfoy, dragged along in support of Voldemort, almost losing her only child...and then having her belief system completely turned upside down in the aftermath of the War. It would make any witch absolutely mad with grief. But the Narcissa Malfoy who sat in their Floo parlour wasn’t mad and didn’t seem to be weighed down by grief. She was hurting, because her son was a wastrel, but she wasn’t prostrate. There was an iron strength to the witch that Hermione could admire.</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>She shrugged, the movement pushing her away from the door as she straightened, squaring her shoulders. “We can always use the money. And I admit, I’m curious.”</p><p align="left">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Susan laughed, pushing herself away from the wall. “Gods help us all, Hermione Granger is curious about something. Why am I suddenly very worried?”</p>
