    <p>...the hope that one day this weakened bond between the pair was not for total loss.</p>
<p>Dumbledore sighed. </p>
<p>Staring at the nonchalant reflection in the mirror was a reminder of the hopelessness he was destined to face. His future - the catalyst that held him onto whatever life he had ultimately lain out to follow. It was hardly satisfactory. But, his imitated reflection showed otherwise. </p>
<p>His rival. His friend. His lover... </p>
<p>Gellert Grindelwald - the man whom he'd shed his heart, subconsciously knowing it was never going to last. He'd repressed said feelings. Not allowing himself the closure he knew he'd have to accept eventually. For love divided the temporal void between power and loss. It was always power that Grindelwald truly believed in.</p>
<p>The man staring back at him with his fiendish, platinum-white hair wore a scowl. As though the image of an expression was worth more than the reality. Though the reality, as Albus recalled, was very much a similar distaste. To look away would have been a crime. He seemed almost sad, behind his curt scowl. Matching the sadness that currently weighed heavy on Albus' heart. </p>
<p>What could he do but stare back at the desire he had once had. Loved but then lost the only true desire he had known before the tragedy of his sister. </p>
<p>Knowing and accepting her death had not changed the feelings he had for Gellert. They had not wavered his only other desire to his family, for Gellert was family. Felt like family at the very least. He touched the very depths of his heart that Albus himself had never known prior. The memory was too much. </p>
<p>He forced his gaze away. </p>
<p>For a split second, the brief acknowledgement of dark magic came flooding back. ( 'You can't trust him, Albus...' )</p>
<p>But then it was gone. As soon as it had come. </p>
<p>All he saw was Gellert - looking back up. His cheekbones sharply extending his jawline. He arched his shoulders from the way he unwittingly felt at ease. This, accompanied by the haphazard, curved smirk he always gave Albus when they'd agreed on something...</p>
<p>It had never been a smile. </p>
<p>However much Albus loved Gellert, he knew better than to believe a smile. There was never any truth behind the smile. Only lies, deceit and potential back-stabbing. Even if he was outrageously handsome when the teeth were flashed his way. Albus swooned at the thought. But, the smirk was the closest alternative. At least that showed Albus that he was happy. Always devious, but happy.</p>
<p>Over recent years, the mirror had felt like a scapegoat. Hiding behind the congressional society of ministry magic, Albus had no intention of hiding behind when he was younger. With the influence of Grindelwald, it had been easy enough to rebel against. </p>
<p>Albus closed his eyes into the memory of their childhood. It hurt. Hurt like hell; with the treachery and lies. Even if they'd had that summer...</p>
<p>He tried to shake it off. The memory. It had been harder than he'd thought, though it had been half a lifetime (for some people). Holding the weight on his shoulders for just under thirty years. Not letting go. Not wanting to. Not knowing how or when to move on, yet...</p>
<p>When the second face appeared in the mirror, Albus knew he was never going to let go. </p>
<p>The adolescent years of himself and Gellert mirrored back as a reflection. Staring at the memories he'd once had and the feelings he still held. Even though it had been worse back in 1898, Albus saw the look on his younger self's face pressed against the glass that grasped onto Grindelwald's hand. </p>
<p>There was a certain weakness to the want in his eyes. He remembered it well, but it was painful to watch. Though try as he might, he couldn't look away. </p>
<p>When the tears started to form in his eyes, Albus turned on his sleeve, rubbing his face with the regret that plagued him. The tears wet his shirt cuffs, not that he was paying much attention to either the appearance of his clothing or his face. Then he sighed - out of heartbreak. </p>
<p>Breathing out to compose himself, he watched the images finally fade away. Falling like sand to the bottom of the glass before evaporating completely as though there had never been anything there. Another memory not forgotten. </p>
<p>Albus held his hand up to the mirror once more. This time with it only holding his own reflection as any other would show. And with his last breath, he whispered into the frame:</p>
<p>"For the greater good, my dear friend."</p>
