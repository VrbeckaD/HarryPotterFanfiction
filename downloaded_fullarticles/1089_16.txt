<p> </p>
<p>                If it were a day like any other, Harrie James Potter would be far more inclined to move, but, as it was, it was not such a day like any other at all.</p>
<p>After the excitement around the breakfast table that morning, Harrie feels far more inclined to continue her avoidance of all things proper and <em>expected</em>, and instead baste her skin in sunshine and enjoy the unseasonably hot spring weather.</p>
<p>(Were it a day like any other, she would probably be doing much the same, but her point stands, that this day was not quite like the rest.)</p>
<p>With her toes skimming the water and her trousers rolled and folded over her calves, Harrie lazes on her broom in an ungainly, boneless slump, trailing her hand along the water surface and enjoying the cool of it on her heated skin.</p>
<p>If it were a day like any other, Molly Weasley would not have cared much for her choice of clothes, for if it were like any other day, Harrie’s penchant for trousers would be nothing more than a small fond frown and no matter at all.</p>
<p>But, as it happens to be quite <em>unlike</em> a normal day, Molly has taken grave grievance with the fact that of her two daughters, both are far more inclined to the ways of boys than the feminine manners that should be impressed upon them from cradle to marriage bed to…whatever end one met afterwards. For in Molly’s mind is no greater triumph than to be wed and married and familied.</p>
<p>(If such a thing as this were meant for Harrie, Harrie thinks she would be far more inclined to it, rather than be so… uninterested in it.)</p>
<p>Which is not to say she has any distaste for those that seek it, but simply that, if she had to choose between a gold ring and chasing the gold sky at dawn, she would always chase the sun.</p>
<p>(If she were Icarus, she thinks she would not even mind the burn.)</p>
<p>So it comes, as it is, to a day of unseasonably warm weather in late March, in which trousers are rolled towards the knee and skirts are abandoned for lighter fabrics and the ever fond Molly Weasley has, in her words, <em>lost more hairs to grey this morning than ever before in my life, </em>that Harrie finds herself fleeing her home and seeking solace in sun and sky away from the news that Gaunt Manor had been opened for the first time in more years than Harrie has been alive for.</p>
<p>Ginny, she knows, is not far off either, taking off in a fit of eye-rolling irritation at the voice of her mother chasing them out of the house, <em>it is a thing to consider, girls that your father and I will not be around forever—</em></p>
<p>Guilt sits, a little bubble beneath her belly button, for the truth of the matter is that each year that passes digs another fine wrinkle upon the brows of the parents that raised her. For the truth of it is, that both she and Ginny are aware that expectations are set for certain reasons, and marriage within Magical Britain is of the greatest importance. And perhaps, more so than that, for Molly Weasley loves her children, but is well aware that in a patchwork family such as theirs, a marriage of <em>means</em> is nearly as important as a marriage of <em>affection</em>.</p>
<p><em>It is no simple matter,</em> she’s told them before when they were less proper young things than little, wild beasts being brought together around an old wood dinner table, <em>you’ll understand when you’re older, that there are things we wish we could give you but find ourselves unable.</em></p>
<p>So, it is true then, that they all feel a small sense of obligation to shed the wildness of love and family that comes with being raised a patchwork family in a patchwork house on a small bit of patchwork land that’s run more on love and dedication than gold and circumstance.</p>
<p>It can’t be all bad, after all, Harrie reasons, her fingers skimming a lily pad, as Bill has already wandered away from the Burrow and into the marriage bed of London’s most beautiful and eligible bachelorette, and seems, for all purposes, quite happy if the ring on Fleur’s hand is any indication.</p>
<p>(And while Charlie seems more at ease in the dragon covered hillside of Romania, he too seems to have found his own way outside of the heart of the Burrow.)</p>
<p> “Harrie!”</p>
<p>Harrie’s foot splashes into the water as she rights herself on her broom. Sitting up, she squints towards the shore, where Remus lazes in the shadow of an old oak tree that had seen more than one adventure and many more than one scraped knee.</p>
<p>She tilts her broom back towards the shore, gliding towards land before hopping off right next to Remus and sinking down into the grass beside him.</p>
<p>“You beckoned?” she teases, enjoying the cool shade and the cool grass on her wet toes.</p>
<p>“It’s nearly midday,” he says, his amber eyes meeting hers, moving away from his book to focus on her. “We’re supposed to be heading into town to get fabric.”</p>
<p>Harrie drops her head back against the tree, “Yes, I remember.”</p>
<p>“You don’t seem overly excited by the news,” he leads, a little curious tilt to the question.</p>
<p>“Are you surprised?” Harrie asks, stretching out beside him, near enough to feel the warmth of him, near enough she can poke her damp toe into his grass-stained ones.</p>
<p>“Just because Molly’s excited by it all doesn’t mean this is some… last stay before an execution. Maybe the residents of Gaunt Manor are all quite terrible people and marriage will be the last thing on her mind once she meets them.”</p>
<p>Harrie nods, looking up at the sunlight filtering through the leaves, the shades of green and yellow, the sun high and bright and pushing through the canopy.</p>
<p>“She makes it sound like it’s some sort of… well, like we’re cattle, being marked for sale.”</p>
<p>“Molly says a lot of things, Harrie,” Remus sighs, and she hears his book thud against the soft earth. “She doesn’t mean half of it. I think she just worries what will happen if anything were to happen to her or Arthur.”</p>
<p>“We’d be fine,” Harrie frowns, watching a beam of light shift as a lazy breeze shifts the leaves. “We would still have each other.”</p>
<p>“But no Burrow, you know that Arthur doesn’t own the land, remember, that it belongs to some cousin—”</p>
<p>“If your goal was to comfort me, you’ve failed spectacularly,” Harrie drawls, digging her toe into his calf.</p>
<p>Remus gives a choked laugh, pulling his leg away from her. “I didn’t have any intentions, really, just stating facts.”</p>
<p>It goes quiet between them, Harrie watches the canopy, almost wishing she <em>was</em> in a skirt so she could bare more of her legs to the breeze.</p>
<p>“With Percy already off to work at the Ministry, and Fred and George being more of mind to business, she’s got little to focus her worry on than us.”</p>
<p>“The Problem Children,” Harrie smiles, turning to look the boy beside her.</p>
<p>Remus grins, his canines too sharp to miss. “The werewolf and the daughter who likes to dress like a boy.”</p>
<p>“You try living your life in a blasted skirt and see how you like it. Molly would disown me if I took to the skies and flashed half of the countryside while in a skirt.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps you could catch yourself a husband that way,” he teases.</p>
<p>Harrie elbows him, “If I wanted one, it would not be hard, men are daft on the best of days.”</p>
<p>“I feel as if I should take offence to that statement.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Moony, you are only daft every other day.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>                  Were one to consider the landscape of Ottery Saint Catchpole it would be said that the best description would be <em>green.</em></p>
<p>Followed swiftly by, <em>I hope you like farmers.</em></p>
<p>Or farmers’ daughters.</p>
<p>Or farmers’ sons.</p>
<p>(Depending on one’s inclinations.)</p>
<p>So, it would be, for a man such as he is, a strange place to find his ancestral home located. Just outside the borders of Ottery Saint Catchpole, on the top of a slowly rising hillside, surrounded by forests and farmland, Gaunt Manor in all its dilapidated glory.</p>
<p>It is perhaps why it took him so long to consider making use of it, being so far out of the realm of influence and society.</p>
<p>He was told to hire professional interior charm-castors, property-warding specialists, and of course, home-charm decorators, but, as he is not only a man of a certain…reputation, he is also a man who trusts very few.</p>
<p>(Whether that’s a lack of trust in ability, skill, or a certain amount of paranoid self-preservation, he isn’t sure… though he thinks it might be all three.)</p>
<p>When it came to settling into the role that his name demands, taking up the proper mantle, if you will, Thomas Marvolo Riddle, hereby known as Gaunt, (almost entirely unknown as Voldemort) steps foot inside his ancestral home and bites back a curse at the state of it.</p>
<p>Though, he’s never been a man to shy away from getting his hands dirty and so, rolls the sleeves of his shirt over the thick of his forearms and flicks a hand at the white sheets covering the windows.</p>
<p>Sunlight pours in, fresh air chasing the dust from the gold rays pouring in as the windows slide open with a flick of his wrist.</p>
<p>With the deadline of the weekend’s festivities approaching, Tom Riddle gets to work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>                By the time he’s nearly finished, the house is spotless, wiped clean of all traces of wear and previous occupants, (whether long-gone, equally dilapidated family or whatever creatures had snuck through the old wards still in place) Tom circles the edge of his property with a knife’s sharp edge slicing into his palm, a steady stream of blood that soaks into old wards and binds them to his magic; a steady stream of iron, Latin and <em>will</em> to line the property.</p>
<p>With the last of it, and the most important part of his tasks done, Tom sets his eyes on the barren but clean rooms and decides that perhaps some assistance will be required.</p>
<p>At the Floo, with a palmful of dusty powder, he calls for reinforcements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>                If one could be so bold as to lay claim to the best parties north of London than Harrie thinks she would be as bold to say Ottery Saint Catchpole could put the grandest affairs to shame.</p>
<p>(For whatever silly reason they choose to celebrate, even if the cause of joy is something as daft as a man or two (of a certain reputation and depth of pocket) having arrived in their small town.)</p>
<p>For, in the moment, as the unseasonably warm spring has made the hall a tepid mass of revelry and dancing, Harrie finds herself rather unconcerned with the reason for the party and more concerned with finding a drink, a new dance partner, and perhaps a quiet place to shuck her stockings.</p>
<p>She finds the drink easily enough, in the hand of Ron, who is already liquor loose and hiding behind the pillar near the end of the hall, away from the eyes of his one-time, <em>alright three-time,</em> girlfriend Lavender Brown.</p>
<p>“Can’t hide here forever, Ronnie, I think she’s setting up a grid,” Harrie smirks, stealing his glass of punch and moving on, ignoring his indignant squawk at the loss of his liquid companion.</p>
<p>She smiles into the cup, sipping the sweet drink and moving out of the hall towards the back property.</p>
<p>The moonlight spills over the field, the wild gardens that grow in the back of Ottery’s communal hall; a pearlized glow that seems to quiet the rhythm of the piano and the gentle wail of strings of music coming from inside.</p>
<p>The door shuts behind her and Harrie pulls in a breath, filling her lungs with green air, a damp warmth of grass and earth and flowers.</p>
<p>It’s a welcome moment of reprieve, and she downs the rest of the drink, setting the glass on the wood of the windowsill and then toeing off her small-heeled shoes.</p>
<p>In the quiet, Harrie leans against the side of the porch railing, out of sight of the windows and hikes up her skirts, reaching beneath the cotton and muslin to get at the clasp of her garter belt and shoving at the thin of her stocking, pushing them down her thigh and towards her ankle.</p>
<p>She’s less careful and co-ordinated than she should be, tinted with alcohol and hazy with joy, she stumbles a little, laughing to herself in the dark as she rebalances and points her toes to pluck off the stocking.</p>
<p>There’s a creak in the wood and Harrie startles, catching sight of a shadow shaped like a man in the pastel light of the moon.</p>
<p>“Don’t stop on my account,” his voice comes and Harrie can only barely make him out, the overhang of the balcony above leaving him mostly in darkness. </p>
<p>“It’s rather rude to watch people you know,” Harrie scowls, letting her skirts fall, holding one stocking rather lamely, barefoot and flushed, (only a bit of it from embarrassment.) “And rather perverse, to hide in the dark while doing it.”</p>
<p>There’s a huff of a sound, like a low laugh and the shadow man steps forward, a bit nearer to the pillar Harrie leans against.</p>
<p>He’s tall and dark-haired, his hair brushed back over his forehead, parted neatly to one side, wearing a dark waistcoat over a white shirt with the sleeves rolled over his forearms.</p>
<p> Harrie notices the jacket, now that she’s looking, not far from her at all, hung over the railing running the length of the porch.</p>
<p>He’s damnably attractive, the type of gentleman described in the books Ginny is so fond of. Tall and roguish, a lilt to his mouth belying the coolness of his face.</p>
<p>“Do all country girls remove their stockings so early in the night?”</p>
<p>Harrie’s hand tightens on her stocking, “And if we did?”</p>
<p>“Then I should dare say I am surprised Ottery Saint Catchpole is not a well-worn stop for lonely men.”</p>
<p>Harrie’s mouth opens, shuts and then opens again. “The manner of dress does not indicate the manner in which we receive—”</p>
<p>“Manner of undress, rather.”</p>
<p>And then she sees his lips twitch more, a crinkle in the corner of one eye, a teasing thing wrinkled by humour.</p>
<p>“If you’re looking for a certain manner of easy company, Ottery Saint Catchpole has a wide variety of barns.”</p>
<p>And now it’s his turn, his mouth opens, then closes and then he laughs, all deep and resounding in the quiet of the night. His head tilts back, Adam's apple shifting, before he looks back at her, mirth plain on his face.</p>
<p>“I think, girl, that is the first time I’ve ever been told to fuck an animal.”</p>
<p>“I’ve said no such thing,” Harrie lies. “You’ve a foul mind. I meant the <em>farmhands</em> in the barns.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes,” he says, slowly, his eyes narrowing on her. “I’m sure that’s exactly what you meant.”</p>
<p>Harrie glares at him, looking him over. “Why are you skulking in the dark, anyway?”</p>
<p>“I am not skulking,” he denies, leaning against the column nearest her. “I am waiting for my companions, who happen to be rather terrible with time management.”</p>
<p>“So you chose to wait in the dark?”</p>
<p>“And watch country girls undress, yes,” he smiles, but it’s a teasing thing.</p>
<p>“A strange thing to get off to, but I who am I to judge how you chose to enjoy yourself.”</p>
<p>“You have a rather crass tongue for a country girl.”</p>
<p>“I think you have not met many country girls, then,” Harrie smiles, looking back towards the party. “Or boys, for that matter.”</p>
<p>“You might be surprised.”</p>
<p>“I doubt that,” she says, her mouth crooked with humour. “City boys like yourself are easily scandalised. I think it’s the lack of fresh air.”</p>
<p>“I am not sure if I am offended or flattered to be called a city boy,” he laughs. “Perhaps both.”</p>
<p>“Easily offended, as well,” she grins. “Too much propriety and too little variety.”</p>
<p>“You think the country holds more variety than London?”</p>
<p>Harrie blinks at him, “Well, yes. You may get more individuals, but each individual is more concerned with their airs than anything else.” She takes a step nearer to him, looks at the stocking in her hand before tossing it onto the porch railing and holding out one hand as if to shake his in greeting, her back straight, a forcibly-polite smile forming.  “Good evening, sir, Harrie James, so nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>Surprisingly, like he was ignoring the fact that Harrie might still be teasing him, he takes her hand, his fingers long and more calloused than she expects, watching his mouth tilt. “Thomas Riddle.”</p>
<p>“Lovely spring we’re having, isn’t it, Mister Riddle?”</p>
<p>“One of the warmest on record, I hear, Lady James.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, just yesterday I read in the Prophet that it should be a rather hot summer as well.”</p>
<p>“Do you get the Prophet out here?” he asks, his brow shifting. “I thought you’d have the Bumpkin Times or something.”</p>
<p>Harrie’s smile falters, then falls. “You broke role, that’s not how one would speak in London.”</p>
<p>“Oh, is that what we were doing? I just thought you decided to show some manners.”</p>
<p>Harrie scowls. “You’re terribly unclever. And also, you were the one watching me, remember.”</p>
<p>“Forgive me, to not expect a girl to come out the back door and lift her skirts.”</p>
<p>“I was n—” she rushes, and then stops, her mouth pursing. “Perhaps you should consider not lingering in the shadows like a pervert.”</p>
<p>“A pervert <em>and</em> I should fuck animals, however do I manage such depravity?”</p>
<p>“The Lovegood’s farm is just over the rise, perhaps you should start there.”</p>
<p>He laughs, “Any recommendations on which animal I should turn my affections to?”</p>
<p>“I heard goats are quite popular among lonely men.”</p>
<p>His eyes sink over her, just once, but it’s slow and noticeable, even in the dark. “And if I would just rather watch a country girl undress?”</p>
<p>Harrie frowns but feels her cheeks warm under his gaze.</p>
<p>“Country girls are a very welcoming sort,” she says, watching his smirk grow. “And hold no concern for what a proper lady ought to do.”</p>
<p>“A thing I am quickly learning,” he smirks.</p>
<p>She steps back, keeping her eyes on him as she boosts herself up and onto the railing of the porch. With no grace, she hikes the cotton of her skirts to her thighs and unclasps the other garter, pulling off the stocking in one, ungainly pull. With a small jump she lands back on her feet and tilts her chin, a little defiant pose that probably is less effective than she wants it to be, as he is quite a bit taller than her, she realises and feels rather like he’s noticing it, too.</p>
<p>“Consider it your welcome to Ottery Saint Catchpole, sir.” Harrie tilts forward just a little in a small informal sort of bow. “And a goodbye— good evening, Mister Riddle. I should be getting back to the party.”</p>
<p>She’s heading back through the doors, only briefing catching the sound of his <em>good evening</em> following her inside before the door shuts behind her. With a quiet exhale, Harrie heads towards the washroom, locking the door behind her and stealing a proper quiet moment away from the party and the man in the shadows.</p>
<p>In the mirror, she's flushed and feels strangely off-kilter. When she presses her hand to her cheeks, she wills the pink to fade, (and quietly ignores the too-quick thump of her heart in her chest.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>                Slipping back out of the washroom, but before she can make it very far, a hand wraps around her arm and pulls her back towards the main room.</p>
<p>Ginny grins at her, her face as flushed as Harrie imagines her own is; hair a wild mess of a fraying updo, the slick shine of sweat stuck to the temples. Not that either of them are alone in their state of disarray, Remus appears beside her, looking only slightly more put together in his blue vest and rolled sleeves, the light brown of his hair looking smoother than it had any right too.</p>
<p>“Harrie, <em>look—</em>”</p>
<p>Ginny’s grip turns bruising, turning her attention towards the doorway where three people enter; two men and one woman, who look over the hall with a detached sort of appraisal that looks more like a merchant surveying goods, rather than three people looking to join a party.</p>
<p>And in the middle of the three—</p>
<p>Thomas Riddle.</p>
<p>Harrie scowls, even as Ginny squeezes at her arm, <em>He’s even more handsome than the papers—</em></p>
<p>“Wait,” she says, looking twice at the three newcomers, “Are you saying that’s the Gaunt—”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course!” Ginny nods eagerly. “He’s been in the papers, haven’t you seen them? They’ve been all about Thomas Gaunt coming back from Paris with the Blacks to take up his family home.”</p>
<p>Harrie opens her mouth— and snaps it shut. <em>What an arsehole, </em>she thinks, scowling at him, <em>Thomas Riddle, my arse.</em></p>
<p>“He really is very handsome,” Ginny sighs. “I bet—”</p>
<p>“He looks rude,” she interrupts. “All of them do. I bet they wouldn’t know a good party if one hit them in the face.”</p>
<p>“Well, that one doesn’t look so bad,” Remus says, his eyes lingering on the man at Riddle’s side. Long dark hair, pulled back into a knot at the back of his head, a grin on his mouth as he looks out over the party. Dressed as finely as Riddle is, though Harrie can’t help but notice that Riddle seems to have pulled his suit jacket back on, where the man at his side is only in his waistcoat.</p>
<p>It makes him look… <em>arrogant,</em> she tells herself. <em>Arrogant and pretentious. It’s too hot in here for a jacket, you arse.</em></p>
<p>“And I’d imagine this party <em>is</em> about to hit them in their face, if Brown’s have a word or two about it,” Remus points to the side of the dancefloor, where the Browns, and Lavender, are heading towards Riddle and his companions.</p>
<p>Harrie laughs, ignoring the little flutter in her belly when Riddle’s mouth tilts into a crooked sort of smile, saying something to the man at his side. “Good. It might to them some good,” she pauses, “And so what if they’re handsome. That doesn’t mean much.”</p>
<p>Remus looks at her. “What’s got your stockings in a bunch?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” Harrie lies. “And I’m not wearing stockings.”</p>
<p>Ginny laughs as Remus rolls his eyes, smiling and shaking his head. “I don’t know why I ever thought otherwise.”</p>
<p>“In my defence,” Harrie offers. “I did start the night with them. I made a very honourable attempt.”</p>
<p>“Oi,” Ron says, coming up between them and nudging Ginny over and ignoring her smack at his arm. “What’re we thinking?”</p>
<p>“That they’re rich-pricks, obviously,” Harrie says, grinning as Ron laughs.</p>
<p>Ginny stares at the four new residents of Ottery Saint Catchpole, looking just a little like she’s trying to decide how and when she can make herself known to them. <em>Devious</em>, Harrie thinks, she looks devious.</p>
<p>“Can’t we go introduce ourselves?” she asks, sending Harrie a hopeful look. “It’s what Mum would want, after all.”</p>
<p>“I don’t <em>want</em> to meet them,” Harrie argues. “And unless Molly drags me over there, I’d rather not waste my night on them. I’m not going to marry anyone who owns anything like a <em>manor,</em> let’s be honest.”</p>
<p>Remus eyes her, she sees it, lifting his fizzy drink up to his mouth; Harrie ignores him, knowing he can read her too easily.</p>
<p>“Ron,” she states, turning to face him. “Dance with me?”</p>
<p>“Please no,” he whines. “My feet are already sore, Lavender’s been after me all night.”</p>
<p>Harrie sighs, turning to look at Remus. “Moony?”</p>
<p>He shrugs, glancing at the man at Riddle’s side once more before looking away, something a little resigned in his face until he hands his glass off to Ron. “Oh, why not then. Let’s go.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>                “Well, this certainly isn’t London, is it, Tom?” Bella says, low and curling with a barely-hidden tinge of derision.</p>
<p>He says nothing back, looking over the crowded hall, the music loud, the people all dangerously close to intoxicated, if not already there and wonders, once more, just why his family home had to be here, of all places.</p>
<p>“Oh, come off it, Bella,” Sirius laughs. “Don’t be such a classist. It’s time to join the backcountry party. Isn’t that right, Gaunt?”</p>
<p>He scans the crowds again, looking for the girl from the porch, curious about Harrie James and her stocking-less legs being somewhere in the party. One of said stockings is currently burning a hole in his pocket like some sort of secret joke.</p>
<p>(Or perverse sort of contraband that makes him feel mildly better about being trapped here for the evening.)</p>
<p>“It is, Black, I agree. Make the most of things, Bella, have some…” he pauses, looking at the floating trays of clear glasses holding some sort of fizzy alcohol. He summons one, handing the charmed-cool glass to her. “…of whatever this is supposed to be.”</p>
<p>Her lip curls and Black laughs just as the... <em>Browns,</em> Tom thinks, if he remembers his research right, walk towards them, pushing through the revelry towards them.</p>
<p>And then—</p>
<p>he sees her, a flash of messy hair and gauzy-white dress. She’s leading the man she dances with, even though he’s a fair bit taller than her. They stumble into each other and slip into laughter, ignoring the people around them until they start up again, with the young man leading, this time.</p>
<p>She disappears into the dancefloor again, and Tom looks back to Mister Brown’s hand, held out in introduction, his smile just starting to slip as he waits to be noticed.</p>
<p>Tom smiles, taking hold of the offered hand. “Apologies, Mister Brown, lovely party you’re hosting.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>                “There you two are,” Molly hisses, pulling Remus and Harrie right off the dancefloor in a graceless tug of surprising strength. “I’ve been looking everywhere!”</p>
<p>“What— Mol—” Harrie starts, stumbling after her until they’re off the dancefloor and she’s turning back to face them, her hands already all over Harrie’s dress, smoothing the slipping shoulder, the crooked hem, trying and failing to right the mess of her hair—</p>
<p>“Mol—” Harrie starts again, but Molly tuts and slaps her hand away, righting the line of her dress across her chest before moving onto Remus, who bears the fawning and grooming with much more dignity than Harrie’s flustered huff.</p>
<p>“We’re going to introduce ourselves, smile, be civil and for Grindelwald’s sake, be <em>polite.</em>”</p>
<p>“I don’t want—” Harrie gets out, but Molly's tugging them again and she swears there’s some sort of spell because the world tilts and refocuses as she pulls them through the crowd again and then—</p>
<p>
  <em>He’s there.</em>
</p>
<p>Riddle stands in front of her, still looking as put together as he did when she first spotted him across the hall, more untouchable than in the shadows of the balcony. More like a city-boy she thinks, a true London-born Wizard in all their straight-backed, well-dressed, self-important airs.</p>
<p>“Lord Gaunt,” Arthur says from Molly’s side, turning just a little to look at Harrie with a quick, apologetic smile. “My wife, Molly and my children, Ginevra, Ronald, Remus and Harriet.”</p>
<p>Riddle’s eyes meet hers, just for a second, but it catches, snags the moment and she swears his lips twitch. Harrie can practically see his mind working around the name she gave him, the same way he’d told her <em>Riddle</em> and not <em>Gaunt</em>.</p>
<p>He says nothing, though, and she’s thankful he hasn’t exposed her for the events on the balcony. (For her little white lies of omission, in not telling her family she’s already acquainted with Lord Gaunt, and he, acquainted with her <em>thighs</em>.)</p>
<p>“Forgive me,” he says, tilting his head a little, looking to Harrie once more. “I thought you had seven children.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, well, by blood,” Arthur starts, looking at Harrie and Remus. “But we’ve raised Remus and Harrie as our own, so they’re Weasley’s, Lord Gaunt, as good as.”</p>
<p>“I see,” Bellatrix says, looking them over. “What a…interesting family, you have, Mister Weasley. And your eldest just became engaged to a Delacour, didn’t he?”</p>
<p>Arthur nods as Molly speaks up. “Yes, we’re ever so happy for him, the Delacours are a lovely family.”</p>
<p>Ron snorts quietly, Harrie bites back her smile.</p>
<p>“Excuse me. Let me introduce Sirius and Bellatrix Black,” Riddle says, politely. “They’ll be spending some time with me here, as I try to restore Gaunt Manor and my family properties.”</p>
<p>Harrie looks to the pair of Blacks at Riddle’s side; she’s heard that the Blacks were known to marry well, focused on Blood Purity to a degree that nearly all of them came out so similar they could all pass for siblings. It seems Bellatrix and Sirius Black are no different; dark-haired and pale, tall and lithe with a grace that Harrie imagines might be bred right into their spine.</p>
<p>They are quite a good looking pair, though.</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” Sirius Black says as he cuts between the group and holds out his hand to Remus, his blue eyes focused, his grin wide and eager. “Dance with me?”</p>
<p>Remus blinks, looking down at the offered hand, up to Black, back down again— “I don’t think—”</p>
<p>Black’s smile grows. “Say yes or I’ll have to pretend you did and sweep you out there anyway.”</p>
<p>Remus’ lips twitch, Harrie frowns watching the flush climb up his neck and into his cheeks. “Yes, then. I suppose.”</p>
<p>Sirius Black grins and grabs Remus’ hand even before it’s risen an inch from his side, pulling him towards the dancefloor.</p>
<p>“Apologies,” Bellatrix says, dark eyes following the pair, tall enough to see them through the crowd while Harrie loses them quickly. “My cousin can be… excitable.”</p>
<p>“No, no,” Molly laughs, her hand on her chest, her eyes still glued to where they disappeared. “There’s no need to apologise, what a wonderful thing if they’d take a fancy to one another, hm?”</p>
<p>Harrie doesn’t miss Bellatrix’s too-tight, pained smile that looks like it’s cracking at the edges. “Wouldn’t it <em>just</em>?”</p>
<p>Riddle looks at Harrie, his grey eyes somehow finding hers in a way that’s too knowing, that’s tinted with—</p>
<p><em>Oh, don’t you dare, </em>she thinks. <em>Don’t you even—</em></p>
<p>“Would you like a dance, Miss…Weasley? Harriet?”</p>
<p>“It’s Harrie,” she scowls. “Just <em>Harrie</em>.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” he says, his lips quirking into a smirk. “A dance, then, Harrie?”</p>
<p>Harrie doesn’t miss Bellatrix’s scowl this time, not at all hidden, her curled, thick dark hair swinging as she looks up to Riddle, nearly like she can’t believe she heard him right.</p>
<p>“No, thank you,” Harrie says with a too-sweet smile that doesn’t reach her eyes in the same way the ‘<em>you arsehole’,</em> she leaves off does. To her left, she thinks she hears the sound of someone dying, but she’s too focused on Riddle and the way his smirk falls. “I’m a terrible dancer, really—”</p>
<p>“<em>Harrie</em>!” Molly hisses, high and nearly reedy in desperation. Harrie realises the dying sound may have come from Molly. Ginny nudges her, the start of a<em> dance with him</em>—</p>
<p>“—and I think you’d prefer a less insulting partner. Don’t you think?”</p>
<p>His smile takes a beat too long to spread, polite in the same way his eyes hold hers. “Of course, if you think that best.”</p>
<p>“Let’s dance, then, Tom. I wouldn’t mind a spin,” Bella offers, her hand closing around his arm, long dark nails sinking into his jacket. “You haven’t taken me dancing in ages.”</p>
<p>Riddle holds Harrie’s eyes for just a moment longer before his head turns and he’s smiling down at Bellatrix. “Of course, I have been a terrible host lately, haven’t I?”</p>
<p>He turns back to the remaining Weasleys, nodding politely at Arthur. “Mister Weasley, lovely to meet you, but if you’ll excuse me, I can’t refuse a lady’s request.”</p>
<p><em>Of course, of course, </em>Arthur says, fluffing a hand as Riddle leads Bellatrix towards the dancefloor.</p>
<p>Harrie refuses to watch them go, looking down at a thread, fraying off the pale-green ribbon tied around her waist.</p>
<p>“<em>Harriet James,” </em>Molly starts in a way that makes Harrie cringe.</p>
<p>“I’m <em>sorry</em>, Molly, but he’s— I would have insulted him sooner or later. Can you imagine <em>me</em> dancing with <em>him</em>?”</p>
<p>“He’s worth more than this countryside! The life that he could give you—”</p>
<p>Harrie huffs, “I don’t need someone to give me a life I already have, especially not some… city boy with deep pockets.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s all well and good, dear, but the facts stand that—”</p>
<p>“Mum,” Ginny says, rolling her eyes. “How about we not make a scene at the party and just appreciate that Remus has just been asked to dance by a <em>Black.</em>”</p>
<p>Molly stops, her smiling spreading quickly. “Oh, Remus! Yes, isn’t that just lovely? Let’s go take a look, dear,” she says, turning to Arthur and leading him to the edge of the dancefloor.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Gin,” Harrie sighs, watching them go.</p>
<p>“You’re as daft as a Puffskein, <em>Harriet James,</em>” Ginny huffs, turning to face Harrie. “Lord Gaunt wanted to dance with you and you told him <em>no? </em>Are you mad?” She makes a strange sound in her throat, turning on her heel and marching off before Harrie can answer.</p>
<p>“Well,” Ron says rather blandly. “Some party, eh?”</p>
<p>Harrie snorts.</p>
