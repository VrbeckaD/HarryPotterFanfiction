    <p>Hermione Granger had always had an insatiable curiosity. Since she'd developed object permanence and the ability to walk quietly, she'd followed her parents to meetings, listening through doors or windows to hear them discuss Hogsmead's business. Whether it was settling a scuttle between farmers, discussing treatments for illnesses, or making trade deals with dignitaries from Slytherin, she adored her parents' and their friends' diplomacy skills and absorbed everything she could. That was until she was found out by the other kids at Hogwarts Castle. She had been able to avoid them for the most part with her light steps and the walls of books she put up around herself in the library, but alas, two other children were just as curious about her as she was about everything else. </p>
<p>One day when she was eleven, she was eavesdropping on a trade meeting Mr Hagrid, the gamekeeper, Sir James, and her mother were having with the Slytherin dignitaries about selling sand and felt a poke in her back. When she turned around, there was no one behind her. She rubbed the spot, thinking that it must have just been a muscle twitch or something before turning back to the window. Again she felt a poke, this time by the small of her back. It was harder than the first and almost pushed her into the window. She frowned, confused, and peered around the corner once more. She heard quiet giggles from down the hall and decided to see who dared to interrupt her self-studies. She had recently discovered that she was magically gifted and decided to give this gift a try. She reached out with her magic to see if she could sense what she was up against and felt two other magical signatures down the hall. </p>
<p>She latched onto the closest one with her magic and yanked, sending a red haired boy flying from his hiding spot and into the middle of the hall. She smirked before putting calling out, "Ronald Weasley! What are you doing? Don't you know it's rude to interrupt a lady?" and laughing as he righted himself and brushed off his green and red tunic and tights.  She walked over and reached up to his face, brushing some dirt from his nose. 'You missed a spot."</p>
<p>Ronald looked up at her for a moment with doe eyes before shaking them away. "Don't you know it's rude to eavesdrop?" he retorted. </p>
<p>"I'm learning!" she defended, crossing her arms. </p>
<p>"Sounds boring," he replied, frowning slightly. </p>
<p>Just as she was thinking of a witty retort, Harry Potter came out of the corner where he and Ron had been crouching in a rush of blue and black fabric. "Hey Hermione," the bespectacled boy greeted, "Ron and I were about to go ride the new Hebridean Black dragon!" </p>
<p>"Are you stupid?" the brunette said accusingly, rasing an eyebrow, "You could get killed, or worse, grounded." Hermione had been grounded once. She'd spent a whole week in her room without so much as a poem to read. It had been the worse week of her life. She did not want to repeat that experience. </p>
<p>"Come on,'Mione," Harry begged, Hagrid said it's too young to do much damage."</p>
<p>"And my mom says that we really ought to get you out of the castle more," Ron added. "Ouch!" he cried upon receiving punches from the other children. </p>
<p>"Well," Hermione said, weighing the pros and cons, "I suppose someone should keep watch and make sure that you two idiots don't die."</p>
<p>"Yes!" Harry cheered, ignoring the fact that he'd just been called an idiot. He jumped forward and grabbed her arm, pulling her along to Hagrid's zoo on the edge of the castle's property. They crept in the back, treading through the edge of he forest to avoid being seen. On the way to the young dragon aviary they bowed at hippogriffs, rescued her hair from prying pixies, and guarded their pockets from nifflers. When they finally arrived at the giant bird cage that belonged to the young dragon Harry and Ron had told her of, the beast was nowhere to be found. Even though the young dragon was nowhere to be found, Hermione could feel the heat rolling off its body. Compared to the light May breeze, the area surrounding its cage was boiling. </p>
<p>Harry and Ron ran right up the the cage, their boyish eyes wide with excitement. They grinned and giggled, sticking their arms through the bars in hopes of coaxing the dragon out. Hermione stuck behind a bit. She had read of the pointed teeth dragons had at even young ages and did not want to tempt it into taking her arm like she was sure it would the boys. </p>
<p>"Harry! Ron! Get your hands out of there before you lose them!" she tried to reason with them. The young boys removed their arms form inside the cage, to her relief, but then did something ten times more horrifying. She saw the heatwaves coming off their hands as they used magic to bend back the bars enough for them to fit through. "What in Merlin's name are you doing?" </p>
<p>"Riding the Hebridean Black dragon!" Ron reminded her, annoyed. "Come on!" He reached his hand through the bars and pulled her in with them. </p>
<p>"Stop!" she cried, "It's dangerous! What if it's burrowed in the ground? What if it bites us?" She asked the boys as they danced, jumped, and ran around the cage in an effort to draw it out. </p>
<p>It worked, much to Hermione's horror. A spiked tail shot out of the sand, nearly impaling her. She ducked and crouched by the widened bars. After it came the long black head and neck. Harry sneaked over to the place the body would emerge and grabbed on to the creature's neck when the back lifted his feet off the ground. The dragon had such long spikes on its head that Hermione was scared Harry would impale himself on it if it bucked the wrong way. He laughed as the dragon shook and bucked its back in an effort to shake him off. Ron was pushed over with the force of the leathery black wings as they stretched for takeoff. Harry grabbed the spines he could tightly as the creature took off and spiraled to the top of the cage, flying around in an effort to drop him and maybe injure him enough to make a lunch out of him. </p>
<p>Hermione followed the flight from the ground, hands ready to either catch him or send a slowing spell. Unfortunately her magical education had not started yet, and as such she was left to impulsive magic. She didn't know what spell she'd cast if Harry were to be in grave danger. </p>
<p>She didn't have to wonder long. She heard Harry scream as the dragon twisted and dove for the ground. She grabbed Ron from where he was frozen in place on the ground and screamed, "Harry! Let go on three!" The dragon shot closer and closer, whipping Harry around like a pebble in a sling shot. "One!" she yelled. Twenty feet. "Two!" she yelled as she saw the dragon change directions towards her and Ron. "Three!" She yelled when it was at its closest. As luck would have it, the dragon whipped Harry right into hers and Ron's waiting arms. The force with which he was shot sent them all flying into the bars of the cage near where they had melted. Her head hit the metal bars hard, stunning for a moment. She fell back as someone grabbed her arms and dragged her towards the hole. She saw the hundreds of dragon teeth approach her as it dived down at her. Ron whipped her through the bars just as the dragon's jaw sliced through the ground where she had been. Ron quickly moved the bars back to their original position as the dragon stalked them angrily from within its cage. </p>
<p>"Hermione," she heard Ron say through her ringing ears, "Hermione! Your parents are healers, right?" Ron asked. </p>
<p>Hermione nodded dizzily in response.</p>
<p>"Good," he said before gesturing to Harry who was bent over on the ground, moaning. "Harry's hurt. Do you know anything that could help him?" </p>
<p>Hermione took a closer look at the boy on the ground. The sand below him was red with his blood. Hermione resisted the urge to shake her head to clear it of the ringing and pain as she crawled towards Harry. "Look up, Harry," she instructed. Harry followed her demand. His face was all bloody. Hermione gasped. His wasn't the most blood she'd seen, but it was still shocking to see a young boy with such a bloody face. "Where does it hurt, Harry?" </p>
<p>Harry gestured to his forehead. Hermione gingerly moved his bangs from his brow. The blood came up from the right side. She saw the shine of glass but not much else. This wouldn't do. She made to get up to pull him up, but was caught by a dizzy spell. She sat back down and put her head between her legs as her head pounded and the world seemed to spin. "Ron. Find a clean bucket and get some water for me." </p>
<p>"On it," Ron said, running off. </p>
<p>He returned a few minutes later with a small bucket filled with water. "This enough? It's from the well." The bucket sloshed as he put it down beside her. </p>
<p>"Perfect," Hermione said, moving slowly so as to not restart the dizziness that had faded during his absence. "Pour some water over my hands," she instructed, rolling up the sleeves of her purple dress. Ron did as she asked and stepped to the side, waiting for further instruction. "Lean your head back, Harry," she ordered, cupping water in her hands and pouring water over the wound until his forehead was cleaner. Blood continued to trickle from the cut, but slower than before. </p>
<p>"That's gonna be a bloody wicked scar, mate," Ron gasped. </p>
<p>Harry flashed a smile that quickly turned into a grimace as the skin stretched around the wound.</p>
<p>"Stop moving your face!" Hermione said, splashing him with water to clean the cut again and to punish him for causing the cut to bleed again. </p>
<p>"Where are your glasses, Harry?" Ron finally noticed. </p>
<p>"Currently one lens is broken and lodged in his forehead," Hermione growled. "I don't suppose you have any tweezers?" </p>
<p>"'Ere you go," a gruff voice said behind her. </p>
<p>"Hagrid!" she cried out. 'We . . . We . . ."</p>
<p>"I know what yous was up to," he smiled, pressing the tweezers into her hand. "Always got these on hand 'case som'un gets pricked." </p>
<p>"Thank you," she said, splashing Harry's face once more before going in gently and slowly with the tweezers. More blood gushed out after each piece was removed. "You're being very good, Harry," she complimented the boy who had groaned but hadn't so much as flinched as she removed piece after piece of glass from his forehead. When she could find no more, she splashed him once more before pressing her handkerchief on Harry's forehead. </p>
<p>"You'd best find yer father now, Miss 'Mione," Hagrid said, helping her and Harry up and pushing Ron under Harry's other shoulder. The three children thanked their half giant friend and went off to Hermione's home to find her father. </p>
<p>Thankfully and unfortunately her father was unoccupied at the moment. Hermione had been half-hoping that she could stitch Harry up, brush his bangs into a strategic style, and be done with the hole ordeal until the stitches would be removed. Alas, her father was home, unoccupied, and rather amused by hers and her new friends' story. </p>
<p>"You really flew on the back of a Hebridean Black dragon?" he asked quietly as he removed the handkerchief which was now stuck to Harry's forehead with dried blood. "You're going to be really popular with the girls once this heals up." </p>
<p>"Ew," Harry grimaced as if that thought were more painful and disgusting than his bloody wound. </p>
<p>Mr. Granger chuckled as he threaded the needle, tied the not, and began tying and cutting down the zigzagging cut on Harry's forehead. When he was done he gave each child a biscuit. He wrote a short note and flooed it to Harry's mother. "Dear Mrs. Potter. Harry has cut his head whilst attempting impressive dragon-riding heroics, or so I'm told. He is at my place if you'd like to pick him up. Yours truly, Wendell Granger." he read out loud. </p>
<p>A few moments later, Lily James Potter and Sirius Black came through the door. Lily had a worried frown on her face which contrasted with Sirius' amused grin. "How could you be so stupid, Harry?" she fumed. </p>
<p>"Ronald Weasley!" Molly Weasley's voice echoed Lily's worried fury from outside. Sirius' expression quickly sobered. She too burst in, red with anger. "Why is it always you two when things go sideways? Oh hello, Lily, dear." Molly's demeanor changed completely when she saw Hogsmead's community organizer mirroring her posture. </p>
<p>"Hello, Molly. Looks like they're at it again," she chuckled. "What can we do with these two fools?" </p>
<p>"Grounding them has never made a difference. Cutting dessert simply made them craftier. They're worse than Fred and George, I tell you," Molly agreed. </p>
<p>"I think they've learned their lesson today," Hermione's father cut in. Lily stormed forward and tilted Harry's chin so that she could get a better look at his forehead. </p>
<p>"I suppose you're right, Wendell," Lily admitted. "Thank you for fixing him up." </p>
<p>"Oh, I did nothing but stitch him up. My 'Mione here cleaned the wound right up and removed all of the glass," he said proudly. </p>
<p>"And Ron got us out of the cage," Hermione added modestly. </p>
<p>Molly and Lily shared a look. "Maybe you boys should keep this one around," Molly said, smiling sweetly at Hermione before taking Ron's hand and leaving the Granger residence and clinic. </p>
<p>And they did.</p>
