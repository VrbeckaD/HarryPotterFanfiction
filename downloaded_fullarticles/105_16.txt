  <span>Ania was an amazing woman. Intelligent, beautiful, kind, the whole thing. Which was why Dudley could hardly comprehend the answer she’d given to his question.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Dudley, are you alright?” she asked, her soft voice reaching his ears. </span>
  <em>
    <span>She said...</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes. Yes, I’m more than alright!” He leapt off of the ground where he’d been kneeling, picked her off the floor, twirling her around, clutching the small, now empty box in his hand.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“SHE SAID YES!” He yelled at the crowd gathered around them at the mall.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Everyone cheered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dudley creaked open the door to Daisy’s nursery, grinning as he expected to see his daughter hurling her stuffies at the wall, but stopping short as he took in </span>
  <em>
    <span>exactly </span>
  </em>
  <span>what the three-year-old was actually doing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The aforementioned stuffed animals were hovering in mid-air, occasionally being pelted at the ceiling and falling to the floor with a thud before rising up again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dudley was suddenly grateful for Harry’s letter a few years back, giving him his new address in the centre of London and his landline number. Because apparently wizards had landlines now.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But Dudley had never replied to the letter, maybe because he had little confidence in his handwriting but also because, well, what did you say to the man you bullied his entire childhood and then saved you from the man who’d killed his parents by sending you away, then proceeded to save the world from said murderer? It was too hard to think about. So Dudley kept putting it off until it would have just been plain awkward to answer Harry’s letter.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Something he regretted now, because he needed his cousin’s help.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Which is why he now found himself in the middle of London, or, as he remembered someone a long time ago saying, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Muggle </span>
  </em>
  <span>London. Whatever that was. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He stared at Harry’s flat, feeling self conscious about the weight he hadn’t managed to lose, about his clothes, his hair, everything.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His lack of magic.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He stared at the doorbell, so small, so innocent, pristine white on the gray stone wall. Dudley had to do this; he </span>
  <em>
    <span>had </span>
  </em>
  <span>to, for Daisy, so that he wouldn’t be to her what his parents had been to Harry. He had to do better, he had to be better. Ania had freaked out when she had seen what Daisy could do; but when he had sat her down, given her a nice, soothing cup of tea and explained everything to her, she had eventually calmed down enough to understand this incredible being that was their daughter.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So he was here. In front of a quaint stone house. Must be cold in the winter, he thought idly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Anything to put it off. Dudley Dursley, master of procrastination, at your service… but only starting tomorrow.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He looked up at the first floor, absent-mindedly peeking into the kitchen window. Which was where he was.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry. He was cleaning dishes, by the looks of it, by magic, waving his wand this way and that, unaware of the eyes staring at him from outside. Something caught Harry’s attention, and he bent down, out of Dudley’s view, and then reappearing, a small boy with jet black hair on his hip. Spitting image of his father, from the messy hair falling in his eyes to the goofy grin Harry used to have as a child.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dudley rang the bell. </span>
