    <p><i>Is something wrong?<br/>She said</i><br/><i><b>Of course there is</b></i><br/><i>You're still alive<br/>She said</i><br/><i><b>Oh do I deserve to be?<br/>Is that the question? <br/>And if so, if so<br/>Who answers?<br/>Who answers?</b></i> — pearl jam </p>
<p>ooo</p>
<p>A drop of rain slowly trailed down the window of Hermione Granger’s compartment on the Hogwarts Express. Her eyes followed its trail as the grey sky and the countryside blurred along behind it. A sad comparison to what her life had become since the war, she mused to herself. She, too, travelled listlessly, as the world seemed to blur all around her. </p>
<p>Ginny and Luna were having a light conversation beside her. She could hear them, but she didn’t really <i>hear</i> them. Their voices sounded muffled, almost like she had cotton stuck in her ears, or like they were coming from the other end of a large, empty corridor. That seemed to happen quite often recently. </p>
<p>The weeks that followed the battle she noticed small variances in the way she experienced life. Food, for example, didn’t seem to taste the same as it once did. Every flavor from salty, to sweet, to sour, and spicy had all been the same. Bland. Boring. Lifeless. She didn’t eat for pleasure any longer. Truth be told, she rarely ate at all. Only when others were watching her at mealtimes. </p>
<p>It was a combination of things, she realized, that caused her current state. One of which was obvious — the trauma of what she had been through the previous year, which she was still struggling to cope with. But there was something else that even took <i>her</i> by surprise. She no longer felt a sense of purpose. For so long, since she was a child really, her main focus had been the rise and eventual fall of Voldemort. Making sure that she, Harry, and Ron survived. But now that Harry had defeated Voldemort, and his ever present threat no longer lingered over the heads of the Wizarding World, Hermione was not sure what to do with her life. </p>
<p>That uncertainty about her future was why she was currently the only one of her trio who was on their way back to Hogwarts to finish their final year. Hermione hoped that once she returned to school, and got back into the structure and routine of student life, that it would give her purpose again. </p>
<p>Besides her role in helping Harry win the war, her studies were always one of her main focuses in life. Not that her schooling had been on the back burner for all of those years. More like… the side burner. But now, she could just focus on her coursework, and that alone. And hopefully, that would direct her towards her next step in life. </p>
<p>“Wrackspurts must have got her.” Hermione heard Luna say. </p>
<p>She truly did care for the girl, but still, some of the things that came out of her mouth caused Hermione to roll her eyes. </p>
<p>“Sorry,” Hermione said as she turned to face them. “Were you talking to me?” </p>
<p>Ginny shook her head as a sad smile touched her lips. “Yes, Hermione,” she answered, her exasperation clearly evident in her tone. </p>
<p>“You know, Hermione, if you keep a radish on you, it helps ward off the Wrackspurts.” Luna moved her long blonde hair from her shoulder, where Hermione could clearly see the radish earring dangling from Luna’s ear. “That’s why I wear these.” </p>
<p>Ginny quickly coughed to disguise her laugh, as Hermione blankly stared at Luna. </p>
<p>“Erm… I’ll keep that in mind.”</p>
<p>Hermione had long since stopped attempting to argue with Luna’s strange declarations. Recently, she couldn’t be arsed to argue with anyone at all, for that matter. </p>
<p>That was probably why her relationship, if you could have even called it that, with Ron fell apart. It seemed that the interest they had in each other stemmed from their constant back and forth. Once that died, so did any hope of a future together. Both of them quickly became bored with one another, and after only a few short weeks of dating, decided they were better off as friends. She thought she would have been more upset about it, but truthfully, she felt more relieved than anything else. </p>
<p>“Anyway,” Ginny said loudly. “What I said was, do you think Snape will actually come back to teach?” </p>
<p>A small knot formed in her stomach. She’d been wondering the same actually. </p>
<p>Hermione shrugged. “Dunno. He doesn’t exactly <i>have</i> to any longer, does he?” </p>
<p>The signature dreamy expression on Luna faded, and uncharacteristically her face became solemn. </p>
<p>“Does he know?” she asked in a hushed voice. </p>
<p>Ginny snorted, a frown formed on her lips, since she would have already anticipated Hermione’s response. </p>
<p>Hermione gave a minute shake of her head. “No,” she stated firmly. “And I would prefer for it to remain that way.” </p>
<p>She fixed her eyes directly on Ginny as she spoke. Hermione knew that her friend thought she should tell Snape that it was she who had saved his life the night of the Final Battle. She felt that Snape deserved to know. Hermione, however, was dead set on carrying that secret with her to the grave. Only a handful of people had known the truth; Harry, Ron, Ginny, Luna and Neville. </p>
<p>“I would want to know who it was if it were me,” the redhead mumbled obstinately. </p>
<p>Hermione exhaled as a surge of anger went through her. Only mildly, however. All of her emotions seemed to be mere shadows of what they once were. </p>
<p>“We’ve been through this at least a dozen times, Ginny,” Hermione began. </p>
<p>Ginny rolled her eyes. “I know, I know. You don’t want him feeling indebted to anyone. Which is a load of rubbish, in my opinion.” </p>
<p>“It’s not rubbish!” Her voice went up an octave. “Hadn’t he already dealt with that enough in his life? With Dumbledore and Voldemort?” </p>
<p>Ginny cocked an eyebrow. That was the most emotion Hermione had in her voice in weeks. </p>
<p>“And I keep telling you, it’s not the same,” said Ginny evenly. </p>
<p>Hermione turned back towards the window. “We’re not having this conversation again. <i>No one</i> will ever tell him, and that’s the end of it.” </p>
<p>Ginny just didn’t understand. Snape spent the entirety of his adult life working as a spy for The Order, because of the guilt he felt over Lily Potter losing her life. He was indebted to that guilt, and Hermione felt that after all he had done, he deserved a normal life. Peace. Freedom. She had not rescued him from that shack with any ulterior motives. There was a man she had known for a large chunk of her life bleeding out right before her eyes. She would have done the same for anyone in that position. </p>
<p>Hermione trailed her finger along the raised letters carved into her left arm. Well, <i>almost</i> anyone, she thought. </p>
<p>Not long after, the train came to a halt at Hogsmeade station. She took a deep breath as she stood from her seat. This was what she wanted, she reminded herself; her heart began beating more quickly at the thought of entering the castle again. </p>
<p>“Ready?” Ginny asked, while opening the door to their compartment. </p>
<p>Hermione knew this first night back at the school was going to be difficult for so many of the students, and staff, returning after the war. Was she ready? </p>
<p>She gave a single nod, and followed her friends to queue up with the rest of the students on the train.</p>
