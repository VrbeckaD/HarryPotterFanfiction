    <p> </p><p> </p><p>Don't-call-me-Nymphadora Tonks was drinking a cup of tea in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place. Last night had been hectic... the stealth flight with a very upset Harry Potter, and then the shouting match between the Boy-who-lived and his <em>friends</em><span> who had abandoned him... it was not one of her favourite nights at all.<br/>
At least the kids were talking again. She was the only guard at the moment, and the rest of the house was still asleep, it </span><em>was</em><span> rather early.</span></p><p> </p><p>'Tonks?' Hermione Granger had come down the stairs, and was looking a bit shifty, 'can I ask you a huge favour?'</p><p> </p><p>Tonks wondered what was up, 'what is it Hermione?'</p><p> </p><p>'Well you see... I kind of left home really suddenly, and feel guilty. Can you cover for me as I sneak back home for a few hours, so I can have a chat with mum and dad?<br/>
'Mrs Weasley will probably just have us cleaning again, so if you can do my share, and not let on I left, I'll owe you a huge favour.'</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>'What, you want me to pretend to be you? “</span>
  <em>Honestly</em>
  <span> Harry, did you do your homework? Ronald, </span>
  <em>do</em>
  <span> close your mouth while you eat,” she imitated the bushy-haired teen in front of her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>'I –I do </span>
  <em>not</em>
  <span> sound like that!' Hermione huffed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>'Sorry honey, you kind of do. But okay, your awesome Auror friend will cover for you today. Are you sure you'll be all right?'</p><p> </p><p>'You will? Oh thanks you Tonks!' Hermione hugged her, 'Yes, I'll be fine. I'll just use the tube and then a train to get back home, and I'll return here before dinner. Erm, do you need anything from me?'</p><p> </p><p>'Let's get up to your room, I need to see as much as you as possible so I can do a proper mimic, and of course I need to change in your clothes. And you will owe me a huge favour, okay?'</p><p> </p><p>Hermione nodded, and the two witches went back up to Hermione's room. She shared it with Ginny, but Ginny was still vast asleep. The young Weasley was snoring and drooling, she would not wake up any time soon.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione locked the door, and then stripped down to her underwear, and asked with a blush 'is this good Tonks?'</p><p> </p><p>'What size are you? 32A?'</p><p> </p><p>'34A actually,' Hermione replied, then yelped a bit when Tonks touched her by the arm, 'what?'</p><p> </p><p>'It is easier for me to take your form if I can touch you... let's see if this works...'<br/>
Tonks' hair began to grow out, and got into Hermione's wild bushy shape, still pink. Then her facial features seemed to melt and she took on Hermione's appearance, and the rest of her body shrunk down a bit, until two identical twins were standing side by side... one with bright pink hair, the other brown.<br/>
'Ooh, that was difficult... you have a nice compact body honey,' Tonks giggled, 'let me change clothes and we're good, right?'</p><p> </p><p>'Erm Tonks, the hair colour?' Hermione pointed out, as Tonks stripped naked. She felt mortified, seeing her own naked body in front of her. Tonks had perfectly copied her, down to the triangle of fuzzy brown hair between her legs she had shaved the night before. Even her birth marks were in the right spot!</p><p> </p><p>'Wot? Oh right,' Tonks said distractedly, as she stepped into one of Hermione's few skirts and a T-shirt. Then the hair shifted to Hermione's mousy brown colour.<br/>
'All set!' Tonks twirled on the spot, showing herself off to the original body owner, 'I look hot!'</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>'</span>
  <em>Honestly</em>
  <span> Tonks, no need to make fun of me,' Hermione huffed, 'and please don't ruin it for me, Professor Dumbledore will be so angry if he finds out I left!'</span>
</p><p> </p><p>'No worries honey, Hermione Granger is on the case!' Tonks pumped her fist in the air with a giggle of her own, in Hermione's voice this time.<br/>
'Come on, let's get you out of here before Lupin arrives to take over “Tonks's” shift.'</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The real Hermione had barely left, when Remus Lupin entered the door. He found no Tonks, but </span>
  <span>Hermione Granger in the kitchen, sipping a cuppa.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>'Hi Hermione, you're up early. Did you see Tonks anywhere?'</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>'Oh hi Re– err Professor Lupin, Tonks was called in for work and had to leave early today,' Tonks replied. </span>
  <em>Darn, gotta watch I don't give it away!</em>
  <span> she thought.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>'You can call me Remus Hermione,' Lupin smiled at her, 'I'm not your teacher any more. Well that is rather unprofessional of Tonks, but she's a little airheaded always... don't tell her I told you so!'</p><p> </p><p>Inside, Tonks was angry, this was how the man she was crushing on a bit felt about her? Well he could forget about getting a ride on the Tonks train!<br/>
'I won't Remus, my lips are sealed,' she replied as cheerful as possible.</p><p> </p><p>Lupin poured himself a cup of tea, and began reading the Daily Pravda... err Prophet. A while later Sirius woke up and stumbled to the kitchen for some breakfast, and even later Molly Weasley arrived to cook some proper breakfast.</p><p> </p><p>'Oh Hermione dear, go wake up Ginny and the boys will you? Breakfast will be ready in half an hour,' the Weasley matron said.</p><p> </p><p>'Wait up Hermione,' Sirius said before Tonks could leave, 'Harry is not in Ron's room, he's on the other end of the hall. He changed rooms last night as he could not sleep with Ron's snoring, and he was still a bit angry.'</p><p> </p><p>'Okay Mr Black,' Tonks replied, 'I'll go gather them.'</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ginny was rubbing herself heavily, mumbling </span>
  <em>Oh Harry</em>
  <span> and related things as Tonks came in. She had kicked down the covers some and her pyama pants were down to her knees, revealing her still hairless slit to the world as she frigged herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>'Gah! Ginny, stop that!' Tonks yelped. Ginny froze in shock, and pulled her pyama pants back up.</p><p> </p><p>'He– Hermione? Oh Morgana...' she had a full body blush, Tonks noticed.</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>'Ugh, lock the door next time will ya? What if your mum or someone else had entered?<br/>
'Go take a shower, breakkie is in half an hour,' Tonks shook her – Hermione's – head, and stepped out again. That was </span>
  <em>not</em>
  <span> what she wanted to see this early in the morning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>Not wanting to take another chance, she loudly banged on the door to Ron's room, 'Ronald Weasley! Get out of bed, breakfast is ready!'<br/>
She heard a grumble from within, indicating the other red-head had at least woken up, and went to the end of the hall, to collect Harry.</p><p> </p><p>'Harry?' Tonks asked, knocking softly on the door, 'you awake? Breakfast is ready.'</p><p> </p><p>'Hermione? Leave me alone, I'm not hungry,' called Harry from within.</p><p> </p><p>'You sure Harry?' Tonks asked, apparently he was still upset over the Dementor business and the lack of contact over the summer.</p><p> </p><p>'I'm sure Hermione. Just... let me be okay?'</p><p> </p><p>'If you're sure Harry...'<br/>
Tonks went back downstairs, and told the assembled group that Harry needed some time alone. Molly Weasley wanted to protest, but Sirius and Remus overruled her.</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After Tonks had eaten her own breakfast and the group began to leave the kitchen, Sirius called </span>
  <em>Hermione</em>
  <span> back, and gave her a tray with a filled plate and goblet of pumpkin juice.<br/>
'Can you bring this up to my godson? Even if he's angry, he still needs to eat. Maybe you can talk to him some? I'm sure he'll want to, and you are his best friend...'</span>
</p><p> </p><p>'Isn't he closer to Ron?' Tonks had always head that Ron was Harry's 'best mate'.</p><p> </p><p>'Don't be silly Hermione, what was it you said? Ron has the emotional range of a tea-spoon,' Sirius said with a laugh. 'Nah he'll talk to you if he'll talk to anyone. Take all the time you need, I'll make sure Molly lets you two be.'</p><p> </p><p>Tonks nodded, and went up the stairs with Harry's breakfast. She again knocked on the door, 'Harry? I brought you some breakie, you need your food.'</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was silent within a bit, and then Harry opened the door. He was looking at </span>
  <em>Hermione</em>
  <span> a little weird, Tonks thought, but then let her in and closed the door again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>'Just put the tray on the desk Hermione, then you can go,' Harry said with a wave indicating the desk, and sat down on the bed in the room.</p><p> </p><p>'Nah Harry, you and me need to have a little chat,' Tonks said after she put down the tray, 'why don'cha tell me what's crawled up yer butt?'</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked at her weirdly again, then grinned and patted the bed next to him, 'you sure you want to know... Hermione?'</p><p> </p><p>Tonks nodded, and sat down, 'What is it Harry? Are you angry over the summer? It was all –'</p><p> </p><p>And then Harry leant over, and kissed her deeply, pushing her down on the bed as he crawled partially over her.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Oh Merlin, Morgana, and Maeve!</em>
  <span> Tonks thought, as the wizard snogged her deeply, </span>
  <em>Why didn't Hermione tell me they were dating! That little b–witch owes me big after this! Ah well, a promise is a promise...</em>
  <span><br/>
Tonks began kissing back, she </span>
  <em>had</em>
  <span> promised Hermione not to ruin it, and Harry was a surprisingly good kisser. </span>
  <span>When he finally released her, she was breathing heavily, and didn't even register that Harry had begun taking off his shirt until she felt him pulling her own shirt up past her belly button.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>'Har– Harry, what are you doing?' she asked, resisting his attempts to disrobe her slightly, not that it prevented Harry from having her shirt up to her breasts by now.</p><p> </p><p>'Come on Hermione, it's been too long... don't you want me any more?' Harry said in a lust-filled tone, and Tonks suddenly felt one of Harry's hands creep up her leg, to her thigh, stroking her.</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>'Oh Morgana... we should not be doing this Harry...' Tonks sighed, but now let Harry lift her shirt up over her head. Once the shirt was removed, she felt Harry's hand on her breasts, and then slide under it. </span>
  <em>How long have they been together? This is so good</em>
  <span>, thought Tonks, even as Harry released the clasp of her bra. She let out a slight moan as Harry rolled her left nipple between his fingers, and at the same time felt his right hand crawl back up her oh so sensitive thigh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>'You're so wet for me, you bad girl,' Harry said, as he leant back in for a kiss. Even while kissing, Tonks felt him push down her skirt and panties in one go, and not thinking straight any longer, she lifted her bum to allow him to do so.</p><p> </p><p>'Shaved for me have you? Naughty little witch,' Harry grinned, and stripped down his own pants. Tonks' eyes widened as she saw Harry's cock, it looked huge on his small body, and was rock-hard. She was definitely in over her head now!</p><p> </p><p>Harry kissed her again, then lowered his head down a bit, until he took a nipple between his lips. He licked and suckled, worshipping one breast while fondling the other. After a few minutes of Tonks moaning under his attention, he started moving his mouth and hands down her smooth skin, trailing lower with each kiss.<br/>
Tonks put her hands in Harry's hair, guiding him to where she needed him. Harry kissed around the triangle of hair above her wet pussy, then slid easily over her wet sensitive flesh. The wizard pressed his mouth harder at her, spreading her folds with his tongue, tasting and caressing her pussy. He slowly licked her with long strokes of his tongue, circling and teasing her puffy lips. He would suck on her folds, push inside a bit, then lick some more, he was driving Tonks mad.</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry looked back up, and saw </span>
  <em>Hermione's</em>
  <span> eyes glazed with lust, until she met his gaze. Just as their eyes locked, he licked her clitoris for the first time. Softly stroking across it, her eyes flicked wider, and Harry went back to giving her cunt his full attention. Tonks was getting so close to cumming, but then he pulled away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>'You naughty witch... do you want me?' he smirked, positioning his cock near her entrance. Tonks was frustrated beyond belief, and pushed back at him, trying to force him in.<br/>
'Ah-ah, ask for it or we won't get to play...' Harry leant back down for a kiss, and slightly bumped her entrance with his drooling cock-head.</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>'Please... please Harry, fuck me hard,' Tonks breathed out, then 'Ohhh.. Ooooohhhhh' as Harry pushed in her, feeling her hot folds encircle his swollen cock head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>'Oh Merlin, fuck me hard!' yelled Tonks, and Harry pushed his hips forward. She felt tight as a vice around his cock, gripping his shaft as he sunk in deeper and deeper, until he was fully inside her. Harry pulled back ,and began thrusting in her hard.<br/>
Tonks looked at her lover with an open pout, moaning 'Oh, oh, oh' with each thrust. Harry seemed to be encouraged by her lust-filled face, and plunged harder and harder into her.</p><p> </p><p>Tonks wrapped her legs and arms around Harry, pulling him in her as deep as possible each time, and Harry gave her the hard fucking she needed so bad. Then he threw his head back, 'Oh Merlin I'm coming, oh man!' Harry pushed as deep as he could inside of her. Tonks' own 'Ohhs' became a single long 'OooOOOoooOhh' as she came with Harry, milking his spurting cock, feeling her entire womb fill up with the hot cum.</p><p> </p><p>Harry continued stroking in and out, slowing down as the spasms of pleasure stopped and his cock had spent all it could. Then he rolled off her, lying down on the bed next to her. After a moment Tonks rolled on her side, and wrapped one leg over her lover. 'Wow...' she whispered, leaning in to kiss.</p><p> </p><p>Harry kissed her back eagerly, 'Wow is right... that was the best ever...'</p><p> </p><p>Tonks' hand moved lower, her fingers stroking down to Harry's half erect cock. She began slowly stroking him, then bent over him, lowering her mouth down to his cock, and gently sucked him into her hot mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Harry put his hand on her head, 'Oh shit that feels great...' Tonks sucked harder, bobbing her head as her lips travelled up and down his shaft. Harry was stiffening rapidly under her wet suction, and once Tonks was satisfied he was hard enough again, she straddled him. She reached down, wrapped her fingers back around his cock, and held it straight as she lowered herself over it. She was wet with his and her cum, so Harry had no problems sliding back in all the way again, he groaned aloud. Tonks placed her hands on his chest, and rocked over him as she began riding him.</p><p> </p><p>Compared to the earlier screw, this was far more gentle. Tonks set the pace, fucking him with long strokes. Harry pushed her hips up, moving with her but letting her control the coupling. Then Tonks began to grind down, and increased the rhythm. Harry grabbed her waist, holding her tight as he pushed up in her.</p><p> </p><p>'Oh yes, I'm so close, oh yes,' moaned Tonks, having Harry stroke deep inside her. Then her pussy squeezed down hard again, and Harry shot up his second orgasm deep inside her, calling out 'oh Merlin,' as the two lovers came again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>What felt like hours later, there was a knock on the door, rousing Tonks from a happy sleep. She noticed with mortification that she had reverted to her own form at some point, and quickly looked over but found Harry asleep. Quickly she shifted back in Hermione form, and called 'Who is it?'</p><p> </p><p>'Hermione? It's Sirius. Everything all right? You've been in there for hours.'</p><p> </p><p>'All... all is good, Sirius. Harry and I had a deep long talk, he had a lot of frustration to work through. He fell asleep a little while ago?'</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>'Oh, okay then... just wanted to let you know dinner is in an hour,' Sirius called, 'come back down if you can okay?'</span>
</p><p> </p><p>'Okay!' called Tonks back, then felt something stir against her rear. Harry was awake in more ways than one, apparently. She turned back, and kissed him deeply.<br/>
'Hi lover, you hungry?'</p><p> </p><p>'For you? Always babe,' Harry replied, pulling her on his lap, 'one more round before dinner?'</p><p> </p><p>'Dinner? Oh Merlin!' Tonks shot up, away from the bed, 'Sorry Harry I have to run down quickly, maybe after dinner?'<br/>
She had forgotten about the real Hermione for a moment!</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>'You promise me your full attention after dinner then... </span>
  <em>Hermione</em>
  <span>?' Harry asked, looking at her contemplatively again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>'Yes... oh Merlin yes Harry,' Tonks replied with a blush, as she quickly dressed. She left the room which was stinking of sex, and snuck down the stairs to the front door. Fortunately no-one was in the entrance hall, so she silently closed the front door behind her and called out 'Hermione?'</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>'</span>
  <em>Finally!</em>
  <span>' came from her right, as Hermione stepped out from behind the next door's front fence, 'I thought you had forgotten about me!'</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>'Sorry Hermione, Harry has kept me... </span>
  <em>busy</em>
  <span> all day,' Tonks said with a deep blush. Good thing it was rather dark out here, and Hermione could not see her clearly, she did not want to have to admit she had been screwing her boyfriend all day.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>'He is talking to me again? Perfect Tonks, I owe you hugely! I was sure he would keep a grudge for a few more days. How can I ever repay you?' Hermione beamed at the Auror.</p><p> </p><p>'Oh, it's nothing Hermione... let me do a quick switching spell on our clothes, then you go back inside and I'll head home for some rest. Harry wants to see you directly after dinner, maybe you should bring it back up to him, he's in the last room on the third floor okay?' Tonks needed a good long bath.</p><p> </p><p>'Okay,' Hermione replied, and Tonks performed the switching spell on their outfits.<br/>
'Err Tonks, why is my shirt so crumpled? Did Molly make us clean again all day?' Hermione asked, as her outfit changed,</p><p> </p><p>'Nah it's Harry, he had a lot of energy to work off,' Tonks said with a kind of grin, 'Bye now you lucky witch!' and she popped away to her own home.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione opened the door and stepped silently back inside, wondering what Tonks meant. Was Harry practising duelling spells with her? That was so good, she'd need to thank the older witch for giving her– for giving Harry a better chance to survive.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>'Hermy! I haven't seen you all day!' said Ron with his mouth half full of food, as Hermione stepped in the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>'Ronald, close your mouth while you're eating! That is </span>
  <em>disgusting</em>
  <span>,' Hermione huffed at him, as she sat down at the dinner table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>'Harry is still upset then dear?' asked Molly Weasley, as she served Hermione some food.</p><p> </p><p>'Oh, err... yes, he is,' Hermione replied, 'I am going back to talk with him after dinner.'</p><p> </p><p>'Hmm, that's good Hermione,' said Molly as she continued serving the plates, 'I'll give you a tray to bring up later.'</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After dinner Hermione wanted to go back up the stairs, but was stopped by Sirius.<br/>
'Hermione, two words: </span>
  <em>Silencio</em>
  <span> and </span>
  <em>Colloportus</em>
  <span>,' the animagus grinned at her, giving her a wink.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>Hermione wondered what that was about. Why would she need to silence and lock the door? But she set it out of her mind, as she knocked on Harry's door, bringing in his food.</p><p> </p><p>'Hermione? Come in,' replied Harry, and Hermione stepped in backwards, closing the door. She then turned around, and her jaw dropped. Harry was sitting on his bed, buck-naked and stroking his cock.</p><p> </p><p>'Ha– Harry? Wha–?' she stammered, putting the tray down on the floor distractedly, 'Why are you– are you naked?'</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In response, Harry stood up, and walked to her, 'I missed you Hermione, it was so wonderful earlier... I could hardly wait for your return,' then he kissed her. Hermione felt his hard... </span>
  <em>cock</em>
  <span>... press against her, as she fell into the kiss and her body began to respond.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Tonks, what the hell have you been doing?</em>
  <span> she thought, hardly able to think as Harry's hands roamed all over her body. Before she was even fully aware what had happened, she felt herself being pushed back on his bed, her clothes somehow gone, and Harry was kneeling between her legs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>'Har– Harry? Stop?' she stammered out, but Harry was kissing up her legs, and reached her thighs. </span>
  <span>She didn't want to fight back too hard, apparently Harry and Tonks-as-her had been doing... that... and she could not let him know it had not been her, could she?<br/>
</span>
  <span>Then </span>
  <span>Harry</span>
  <span> licked her rapidly wetting pussy folds, and she threw her head back in a moan, 'Harry? Don't... stop...'</span>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry had no intention to stop, as he proved when he licked over her clitoris, and began eating her out with expertise. Hermione had never felt something like this before, she had 'stroked her kitty' a little of course, but that paled in comparison to what her– to what Harry was doing to her now.</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>'Don't stop...' she moaned at him, as Harry lapped up her nectar, </span>
  <span>circling her clit time and time again. Then Hermione shuddered, as her world turned white and she had the first orgasm of her life. Harry's face was splashed by her juices as she shuddered around his head, and he crawled over her body, finding her lips and kissing her deeply.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>Hermione tasted herself on her tongue, as Harry's tongue wrestled her in submission. She was still coming down from her first ever orgasm, as she felt Harry's dick push into her, her labia parting to welcome him home. Then Harry gave a deep thrust, breaking through her hymen and bringing him all the way inside.<br/>
Hermione felt a slight pain as she lost her virginity, but Harry was kissing her deeply at the time, and the deep thrusts he was pushing in and out of her caused a feeling of pleasure to overwhelm it fully. When he finally broke the kiss, she was fully into it and was moaning deeply as Harry grabbed her hips, thrusting fiercely into her.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione's body was on fire, wave after wave of pleasure shooting through her. Harry slammed into her hard, then she suddenly felt him tense, 'Oh Merlin Hermione I am cumming... I am gonna cum deep inside you... oh yeah!'<br/>
Harry's sperm shot out of his cock, and rushed down Hermione's tunnel, filling her up fully. The new sensation was enough to bring her over the edge, and she came again, this time with her pussy being filled with Harry's baby batter, she moaned deeply even as she shuddered around Harry.</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For a while the two lovers just lay there, Harry still buried in Hermione's tight snatch.</span><br/>
'Hmmmm... I've never felt so content before in my life,' Hermione sighed as she curled up against Harry, 'I love you Harry'.<br/>
<em>Luckily he is probably naïve enough not to realise he took my cherry “again”</em>
  <span>, she thought as she gazed lovingly at him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry bent down to kiss her, 'I love fucking you Hermione,' he mumbled almost inaudibly, and she felt him stir again. She muttered 'again?' incredulously, as Harry lifted her legs until they rested on his shoulder, and he began deep strokes in her, hitting her cervix on the deepest strokes. </span>
  <span>Hermione was moaning and panting almost non-stop, as Harry drove her into the mattress. The friction of his cock on her well lubricated pussy was causing another orgasm to build up quickly, and she began a long 'OoooOOOOooooh', then shuddered and thrusted around Harry.<br/>
Feeling his lover cum pushed Harry over the edge again, and he filled her cunt with his hot cum. Hermione fell asleep just after Harry pulled out of her, with the biggest smile ever on her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Score</em>
  <span>, thought Harry as he gazed on the brunette well-fucked witch sleeping next to him.</span><br/>
<em>Tonks is a horrible actor, and man was it easy to trick her into my bed... those girls at Privet Drive really did teach me well this summer. I am sure I made her cum multiple times. She must have really been hard up, I bet she hasn't gotten laid in months given how easily she got wet for me.</em><br/>
And Hermione was a little reluctant at first, but oh so eager once I got her started... wow I was not expecting to take her virginity. Merlin is she a good fuck,
  <span> Harry grinned, as he lovingly brushed her wild hair away.<br/>
Harry yawned, and lied back down next to his lover. </span>
  <em>Wonder if I can trick Ginny into giving it up for me tomorrow somehow?</em>
  <span> was his last thought before he fell asleep.</span>
