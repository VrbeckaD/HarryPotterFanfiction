      <p>"Hermione! Shut that blasted thing off!"</p>
      <p>Jolting upright, Hermione pushed her bushy hair out of her face, blearily aware that her alarm clock was hopping around her bedside table, ringing in an apparently futile attempt to wake her. Grabbing the small, red clock, Hermione silenced it, then just sat there. Two weeks into the school year, and already Hermione was exhausted. She glanced at the clock. Two hours before breakfast. Just enough time to shower, and get in a little revising.</p>
      <p>At the moment, the assignment that was plaguing her the most was that silly Dream Diary for Divination. More than a week after Trelawney assigned it, Hermione still hadn't had a single dream…or, had she? Wispy memories of a white shirt and yellow-lined robes floated through Hermione's mind.</p>
      <p>Oh, Merlin, no. She had dreamed of Cedric Diggory!</p>
      <p>She'd first seen him on the second day of school. Goodness, he was so handsome. But she caught a glimpse of him near the Black Lake yesterday, and now he was in her dreams? How embarrassing. She didn't want to record something that silly in her Dream Diary, but she had nothing else to report. There was just no way that she was going to fail <em>Divination</em>, of all classes, and certainly not for a reason as stupid as she was too tired to dream.</p>
      <p>Snatching up the leather bound diary and self-inking quill she kept by her bed, she opened the book to the first page. Thinking very hard about the dream that was already slipping away, Hermione put quill to parchment:</p>
      <p>
        <em>15 September 1993</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Dream Diary Entry #2</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Last night I dreamed that I was sitting by the Black Lake and Cedric Diggory was next to me on the blanket. I don't remember what we were doing, but he was smiling. He has a very nice smile. It's kind of lopsided, which is endearing and I ...</em>
      </p>
      <p>Hermione snapped the book shut. No way would she confess to that barmy woman that Cedric's smiles made her tummy all tingly!</p>
