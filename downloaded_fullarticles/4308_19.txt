    <p>Albus Potter looked up from his book to where his best friend lay asleep, his head lolling awkwardly over the side of his bed. Scorpius was sleeping fitfully, his long legs splayed at odd angles to the rest of his body. Albus watched him thoughtfully, worrying his left thumb between his teeth all the while – a habit when he was anxious.</p><p>He was fascinated by how wired Scorp looked when he was asleep. He always managed to look coiled and never quite restful, a bit feline, and so vulnerable.</p><p>Albus felt tears prick his eyes. He was overwhelmed with affection for Scorp, and couldn’t really remember a time when he <em>hadn’t</em> felt almost irrationally protective of him. From the first day of school, that first trip on the Hogwarts Express, they had seemed bound together, inseparable.</p><p>He had been captivated by Scorp's openness and goodness from the start. He was naturally anxious, but there was something innocent and laid bare in that anxiety when he was with Albus. Albus knew he got to see something others didn’t, because he saw how Scorp behaved when other people were around – on edge, like he needed to try on different versions of himself to find one that fit. But Albus knew that he knew the real Scorpius Malfoy. That he got to see the truth of him.</p><p>The weight of the Potter name felt lighter when he was with Scorp. He often thought it probably had something to do with the fact that his best friend wasn’t without the baggage of a famous surname himself – not to mention those stupid rumours that he was the son of Voldemort. Albus had nothing but contempt for anyone who could spend more than ten minutes in Scorp’s company and <em>not</em> think those rumours were complete bollocks. Scorp was kind, bookish, full of a sense of wonder at the world around him. He was sensitive and deeply loyal and couldn’t bear to see suffering. He was good to his core, and Albus had always idolised him.</p><p>It was when all that stuff with the Time-Turner had happened in their fourth year that the ground had finally fallen away beneath Albus’ feet, the stark reality of the way he had come to feel about Scorp slapping him in the face suddenly, in a frenzy, at possibly the least convenient moment, and without any warning.</p><p>He remembered with terrifying clarity the way Scorp had looked straight into his eyes. He remembered it all perfectly, as if he was looking into a Pensive every time - <em>“if I had to choose a companion to be at the return of eternal darkness with, I’d choose you”</em>, Scorp had said.</p><p>In that moment, Albus had felt something rising in his chest, something new and frantic. He didn’t know what it was, what form it would take when it spilled out of his mouth like he knew it was about to. He really hadn’t known whether he was about to declare his love or throw up. He’d felt like he was cracking open at the heart, about to tell Scorp everything he was suddenly feeling.</p><p>In a flash, Albus had realised two things that day. The first, that he was bat-shit crazy in love with Scorpius Malfoy. That he was in love with his <em>best friend</em>. The second, that he could never, ever let him know, or he would lose him forever. And Albus would rather fight off an army of Hungarian Horntails with a knitting needle than try to live without Scorp.</p><p>So that was that, and Albus had fallen back on the same thing they always fell back on – jokes. <em>“No offence, but I’d choose someone massive and really good at magic”</em>, he’d quipped back. It had frozen something inside him to be so flippant and dismissive. But he knew that was the price of Scorp staying in his life. He would pay it; he knew he would keep paying it all his life if he had to. And they had got on with fixing the almighty mess they’d created with that bloody Time-Turner.</p><p>Afterwards, as he started to try to come to terms with his feelings, Albus reasoned he must be gay. He’d certainly never felt attracted to girls, anyway. He had liked some of them, had been impressed by them and enjoyed their company, but had never truly felt <em>attracted</em> to any of them. Not like he did to Scorp.</p><p>No. Nothing like that.</p><p>But, really, as time went on, it became more and more painfully obvious that it wasn’t so much other guys he was attracted to as <em>Scorpius</em>. He had had a few ill-judged, one-off fumbles over the years, to try to distract himself, especially when, eventually, he had had to sit back and watch while Scorp dated (or tried to). The fact was, being touched like that by anyone else just left him feeling nothing. He could have done it, and did do it occasionally, but there was no real point to any of it, because the best it ever did was to numb him for a while.</p><p>Now they were coming up to the end of their seventh and final year of school. They had both recently turned 18, and Albus was relieved that people, even Scorp, had never made much fuss about his never having dated so far. There had been the odd jibe here and there, but if anyone thought it was seriously odd, no-one said it to him. He could only hope that would always be the case, though he suspected his luck would run out at some point soon. Leaving school, starting out on a new part of his life, he had been asking himself some really big questions over the last few months. He supposed it was inevitable that other people might start to expect answers from him, too. He had come to accept that his feelings meant he may always be alone, but he wasn't sure he was ready for the well-meaning interferences and pity of other people.</p><p>Still, he’d need to deal with that when it happened. Merlin knew he had enough to worry about right now.</p><p>In fact, Albus had rarely felt so tense and overwrought. He knew he had been short-tempered recently. He and Scorp had been bickering with each other a lot, and not in the way they always had. They weren’t the usual squabbles, but shouting, door-slamming arguments, often over trivial things, followed by sulky silences that would stretch out, sometimes for days.</p><p>As the years had passed, Albus had developed a habit of just watching Scorp<em> being, </em>in silence, when he knew he could get away with it, without anyone (particularly Scorp) asking too many questions. He especially loved to watch him sleep, the way he was watching him right now.</p><p>Scorp was funny when he was asleep. But Merlin he was absolutely fucking gorgeous too, and Albus could just drink in the sight of his pink and full lips, his messy white-blonde bed hair, the way his t-shirts always seemed to roll up tantalisingly over his flat, pale stomach.</p><p>It did feel wrong sometimes, a bit creepy to stare at his best friend when he was oblivious, imagining all the sinful, obscene ways he’d like to lavish his love over every inch of his body, putting the images aside for when he was alone. It made him ashamed, but Albus felt like it kept him sane too. It kept the truth safe inside him, like a stone he had to carry in his stomach every day. Indulging in these fantasies just lightened the load for a while. It was a way of <em>not</em> ruining both their lives.</p><p>So he kept hiding it, kept telling himself that he was sparing Scorp by carrying this alone; kept telling himself that it would all be fine as long as he was being discrete about it. He could keep Scorp in his life this way. And he needed him in his life.</p><p>But despite it all, he was starting to feel a chasm opening up between him and his best friend, and it terrified him. It terrified him to the point where he would shake with tears when he was alone, where he had bitten his thumbnail down to the quick so many times he didn’t feel the pain anymore.</p><p>He didn’t really know whether it was just the stress of final year that had caused the imperceptible, indescribable change between them, but he knew he would do anything to mend it, to get Scorp back. The situation had begun to feel like glass; so delicate, like if he mishandled it in any way, if he tripped up, it would be broken beyond hope of repair.</p><p>And then this morning – oh God, when he thought of this morning.</p><p>Albus braced himself as he replayed it in his mind for what felt like the millionth time, hoping that, this time, he could make some kind of sense out of it.</p><p>Albus had walked into the bathroom just as Scorp had got out of the shower – that much had been obvious when he had been confronted with the naked body of his best friend. Scorp had had his back to Albus. His face buried in a towel, he clearly hadn’t seen or heard him come in.</p><p>And Albus had stood in the doorway, transfixed, his heart thumping in his throat.</p><p><em>You’ve got this, Albus,</em> he had said to himself.<em> Look away now, look away. This isn’t new. Same dormitory for over six years, you’ve seen his body before. This. Isn’t. New. </em></p><p>But, God help him, he was rooted to the spot, as if he was seeing Scorp for the first time. His eyes had travelled down that glorious body, hypnotised by his finely sculpted, alabaster pale back, his perfect round buttocks and long, strong legs, his platinum blond hair dripping water down over his nakedness. God he’d become so desperately beautiful he shone. It hurt Albus to look at him, but looking away felt impossible.</p><p>Scorp had always been slightly taller than Albus; gangly even, for a while. But as he stood there in that bathroom, Albus’ heart broke to see how his best friend had grown into such a captivating man. Still slender, admittedly, but where there had been bare skin and bone there were now harder lines, angles, and knots of spare but defined muscle.</p><p>The racing of his heartbeat, the blush in his cheeks and the twitch in his cock betrayed Albus’ lust. But there was something more. Albus felt like his love for Scorp was consuming him, burning him up, as if the adoration he felt might punch through his skin at any moment. He had been resisting Scorp for three years, holding that fire inside himself in the name of saving their friendship, but he was sure if he hadn’t been so rooted to the spot he would have been unable to stop himself from crossing the room and . . .</p><p>He still wasn’t sure how long he must have been standing there, frozen, staring. Scorp had just been drying his face, so it couldn’t have been long. But he did know that in the time it took him to steady himself, Scorp had turned around and was looking right at him, watching him from across the room as he stared. And for what felt like minutes, they had just stood, looking at each other, Albus feeling his whole body blushing, Scorp standing there, bare and glowing like an angel, looking . . . defeated.</p><p>Scorp had been crying.</p><p>Albus would know it from far further away than they were from each other right now; would always know when he had been crying just by looking at him. He had seen Scorp cry many times in the months after his mother had died, and there were tears in his eyes now as he stood there naked in front of Albus, a look on his face that was all exhaustion and emptiness. His whole expression was desolate, a heartbreaking contrast to the strength of his body. But as he looked into Albus’ eyes, something unspoken and heavy seemed to pass between them, as if Scorp was asking Albus for something. As if he needed him, needed <em>something</em>.</p><p>"Albie . . ." he whimpered, squeezing his eyes shut against the tears.</p><p>The sound of Scorp's nickname for him broke Albus' heart and made him want to devour him all at once.</p><p>Albus knew that one of two things was going to happen in that moment. If he didn’t turn and walk away, he would go to Scorp and try to hold him, touch him, kiss him, try to find out what or who had made him cry that way and make it right, even if he had to destroy the world with his own hands to do it. And then Scorp would know he loved him, know how he wanted him, and it would all be over.</p><p>So Albus had turned, and he had run away.</p><p>Neither of them had mentioned it all day, but it felt like they had silently agreed to avoid each other. And when Scorp had come back to the dormitory this afternoon, he had just thrown himself onto his bed, laying there in silence before nodding off.</p><p>Albus agonised over whether he should clear the air with Scorp about what had happened, wishing he didn’t have to, while being forced to accept that if he didn’t, this could be the thing that would force them apart for good - if it hadn't already.</p><p>And how the hell would he explain what he had been doing, anyway? How do you explain away being caught gawping at your best mate’s arse, then looking mournfully into his tear-stained face before fucking off and leaving him when he was obviously upset? What had he been thinking just standing there eye-fucking him?! What a stupid thing to do, to get caught like that, after three years of being so, so careful. And what had made Scorp look so completely devastated? Catching Albus looking at him like that? Possibly. He couldn't bear the idea that he had hurt him. What a mess.</p><p>Albus rubbed at his eyes, letting out a groan of frustrated despair, before looking up to see that Scorp had woken and was looking at him again, silently, with those same, fathomless eyes.</p>
