    <p>Tina dreamed about him again.</p>
<p>Those nights, few and far between, where no sounds leaked down into the dark and draughty basement, sleep dragged her deeper than she ever knew it could, and she and Newt were together again. None of this mess with Grindelwald had ever happened, and she was safe and warm.</p>
<p>Tears leaked from her eyes as she slipped from the world of the dream back into reality. Newt wasn’t coming. She was alone. Forgotten. It had been about two weeks since she had been snatched from her apartment. The memories flooded back, as they did over and over again. She felt that stabbing fear once more, like the floor had been ripped from under her and she was in freefall.</p>
<p>It had been sometime around late October. It must be November, now, mustn’t it? It was so hard to keep track of the days when she couldn’t see the sun. The orange and brown leaves had been whirling off the trees as she said goodbye to Newt and Jacob and started on her way home. Queenie was coming home a bit later than usual that evening. She had whispered excitedly in Tina’s ear that she had something important to tell her. Tina could still recall the smells as she walked home, that particular autumnal scent of wood smoke on a chilly evening, the aroma of cooking spices as she walked through their neighbourhood, the smell from the piles of swept-up fallen leaves. For a moment she held them perfectly in her mind, but then the smell of dried blood, of damp, of rotting wood, came back like a slap in the face.</p>
<p>As she put her key in the door Tina smiled as she remembered an awful joke Newt had told. That hadn’t stopped her from laughing. Somehow Newt made the most terrible jokes seem hilarious. Turning the key and walking in, she hadn’t felt like anything was wrong. She never noticed anything out of the ordinary, no feeling that someone else had been here; no sixth sense, that had she listened, could have averted this whole disaster. Tina replayed this moment in her mind, over and over, trying to find something that she could have done differently.</p>
<p>She relived it in slow motion. She closed the door behind her, shrugging off her scarf and dropping her keys on the little table in the hall. At the sound of footsteps on those creaky wooden floors, her heart missed a beat. She knew Queenie wasn’t home. She wouldn’t even finish work for another hour. And that didn’t sound like the clicking of Queenie’s heels.</p>
<p> Upon meeting the eyes of Percival Graves, his broad shoulders framed in the kitchen doorway, her heart dropped into the pit of her stomach.</p>
<p>“Mr Graves, what- what are you doing here?” This wasn’t right at all.  His gaze was icy, and as hard as steel. Tina’s stare flicked over his shoulder. The acrid whiff of something burning pricked at her nose. Emblazoned on the kitchen wall, charred and smoking, was Grindelwald’s mark. The Deathly Hallows.</p>
<p>The blood drained from Tina’s face. Instinctively she slid her wand down her sleeve into its comfortable grip in her hand. Graves had raised his wand and before she could blink Tina was caught by an <em>expelliarmus.</em> Her wand flew through the air and he caught it in one deft swoop.</p>
<p>“Mr Graves, what are you doing?!” she shouted, adrenaline roaring in her veins. He moved toward her but she had already darted for the door.</p>
<p>“<em>Stupefy!” </em>he growled.  It was his voice, it was the auror boss’s voice, but it couldn’t be him, it couldn’t really be him. No, that was impossible. It didn’t make any sense.</p>
<p>The burst of red light hit her in the back and threw her across the hallway, into the wall. Tina lay on the ground gasping, the breath knocked out of her.</p>
<p>With that distinctive <em>crack </em>two men apparated into place beside her, wrenching her arms behind her back.</p>
<p>“Mr Graves, please…” she whispered, her voice hoarse with fear. “What is this? What’s going on?”</p>
<p>Grave’s face screwed up in an expression of disgust. With a vicious jab of his wand, everything faded to black.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Tina blinked awake, it was so dark she may as well have still had her eyes closed. With a groan she pulled herself into a sitting position. Her muscles were stiff and sore from the cold stone floor. The clinking weight around her wrists confirmed her worst suspicions. But how long had she been here?</p>
<p>She forced herself to take a deep breath, <em>in…out</em>, in an effort to dispel the rising panic. All those years of auror training, she could do this. She could get through this. She could find a way out.</p>
<p>Her heart was thumping against her ribs. Despite the sick feeling in her stomach she began to explore the room with her hands. The chain scraped against the stones as she felt along the ground until she reached a wall. She crawled alongside it until her hands brushed against wood, against stairs. Her breathing had become fast and loud.</p>
<p>It was then she heard the footsteps. Powerful, authoritative footsteps echoed from above. Kneeling against the bottom step, Tina’s gaze snapped up to what would be the top of the stairs. A spell was muttered, the lock clicked.</p>
<p>A rectangle of light spilled from the doorway. Her unaccustomed eyes were practically blinded by the sudden brightness. She fell back onto her butt, squinting to see the figure advancing down the stairs.</p>
<p>That languid stride, the flowing art-deco robes; it was none other than Graves.</p>
<p>He stared down at Tina, an eyebrow cocked.</p>
<p>“Tina…”</p>
<p>Tina glared up at him. Hands in his pockets, he took another leisurely step toward her.</p>
<p>“Stay <em>away</em> from me!” she hissed, scooting backwards from him.</p>
<p>“Tina…” he said again, though this time his voice was different. As she watched in horrified silence, his face started to change, his dark hair began to bleach and a wicked smile crept across his face. Grindelwald.</p>
<p>“Tina Goldstein…” he purred. “This does not have to be difficult. I have but one question that requires… your expertise.”</p>
<p>Anger boiled in Tina’s chest. There was no way she was betraying Macusa, or the other aurors. Over her dead body. It must have shown on her face, because Grindelwald smirked, rolling his knobbly wand delicately between bony fingers. He suddenly swooped down so they were face to face, the tip of his wand tracing across her neck. His pale eyes stared relentlessly into hers. His voice was like an icy wind as he whispered in Tina’s ear.</p>
<p>
  <em>“Where is Newt Scamander?”</em>
</p>
<p>Newt.</p>
<p>Tina took a breath that shook in her lungs, willing her nerve to be as hard as rock. Fear filled her to the brim at the thought of Newt being in danger, but she spat out the words as if they blazed with the fires of hell.</p>
<p>“I will – <em>never</em> – tell you.”</p>
<p>Grindelwald rose slowly to his full height, an expression of cold appraisal broken by the smile twitching at his lips.</p>
<p>“Very well, Miss Goldstein.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>Crucio</em>.”</p>
