    <p>Voldemort was seated in his study at Riddle Manor, his current place of stay. He was simply going over plans for the future, when a snowy white owl suddenly flew in through the open window to his right, and landed on his desk, right in front of him and on top of various sheets of parchment. Clasped in its beak was a letter.</p>
<p>Voldemort stared. The owl stared right back, with just as much intensity. How...disconcerting.</p>
<p>He automatically pulled out his wand, and checked the letter for any hexes, curses, or traps, as any good Dark Lord should, then, when he was positive it was safe and clear, took it from the owl.</p>
<p>Having expected the bird to fly off immediately, as most tended to do around him, he was honestly quite surprised when it remained where it was. Perhaps a prompt response was required, then.</p>
<p>Since the owl could not answer him, he unfolded the letter. It was very short, barely three sentences long. Still, he began to read...</p>
<p>
  <em>Voldemort,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I'm bored. It's your fault. Entertain me.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Harry Potter</em>
</p>
<p>A strange, jerky twitch ran through the Dark Lord's body. "That boy has a death wish," he said to himself in a growl. And to his surprise, the owl before him hooted in what, oddly enough, sounded like agreement. "Tch, bold brat."</p>
