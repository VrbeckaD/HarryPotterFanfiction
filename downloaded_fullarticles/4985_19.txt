          <div class="userstuff"><p>A sock collided with the door next to him, just as he was about to leave. He whipped around to find Harry practically fuming, anger apparent on his usually smiling face.</p><p>"Draco, if you walk out that fucking door, don't think about coming back" He scarily said.</p><p> He rolled his eyes, Harry always loved being dramatic. Even though he was mad at Draco he knew if he came back he would always be welcome.</p><p>"Harry, please" He began "You knew this was the arrangement when we got together"</p><p>And Draco wasn't lying, when they got together not only was it surprising to both of them but it came with terms and restrictions. Ones that they settled right away. Draco told him no one would be able to know, obviously. Harry Potter with an ex-death eater? Not a good idea.</p><p>"Yes Draco I did, but I never agreed to be your dirty little secret" He screamed at him.</p><p> The pain was pouring out of each word he spoke. Draco gasped, he wasn't treating him like that!? Was he?</p><p>"You with your fucking buddies, telling them we just happened to be roommates and all that fucking bullshit I'm sick of it!" He yelled, tears welling up in his eyes. </p><p>Making the green appear more vibrant. But they did not contain the sparkle that drove him wild when Draco saw it in the morning, reminding him of the pure wholesome man he had fallen in love with. They were shaking, irises dilated with unsolicited hatred. Draco was not one to show fear, but seeing Harry become such an angry tyrant made him visibly shake. He was also rendered speechless which Harry didn't seem to mind since he continued on ranting.</p><p>"You know what!? Next time you bring your stupid snake loving bitchy friends over I'm going to tell them about how I ride you all night long, how you love to hear me speak parseltongue, each word flicking off the end of my tongue. How only I turn you on! How about that Draco!?" </p><p>Spit was flying out of his mouth each time he started a new sentence. But he didn't care. His hair was stuck to his forehead because of the sweat that had formed and all Draco could think about doing was caressing his face. He'd gently wipe away all the sweat and kiss his forehead but Malfoy's didn't back down. So if Harry wanted a fight he was surely going to get one.</p><p>"Really Harry? Going to pull that on me? Well, how about I tell Weasel and little Miss Mudblood how prettily you blush when I'm on my knees for you? Or how loud I can get you, so loud we get complaints from our fucking neighbours maybe I should tell them that!" Draco screamed back, trying to intimidate him, but if Harry Potter was truly not scared of one thing it would have to be him. </p><p>He never was. That's what always ground his gears at Hogwarts and forced him to go to his wit's end to fucking make him blush or scream or have any emotion at all. </p><p>Even though he wasn't terrified like Draco was wanting, he was sporting an obvious blush from his words. He always was a whore for dirty talk. Even though Draco would admit he loved the snake-like sounds he produced while speaking parseltongue. Instead, Harry gets way more flustered over him just telling him how nice his pants fit or complimenting his muscles. It's adorable and one of the reasons he loved him so much. He noticed throughout the argument as well that they had become closer to each other. Draco backed away from the door while Harry crept slowly towards him, they were almost touching at this point.</p><p>"Don't. Call. Her. A. Mudblood" He spat out the rage apparent in each word.</p><p>Draco gulped harshly. He had never seen him so upset. Even though he was supposed to be angry, he looked hotter and hotter every second that they spoke, his green eyes penetrated through him sending waves of electricity through his veins. Just as he was waiting for another yelling match, Harry shrunk to the floor, devastatingly so, and began to sob. Very hard. His crying echoed around the room making his heartache. Sometimes he really needed to shut up. He slowly sunk to sit next to him. He just wanted to wipe the tears away and make everything better.</p><p>"I-I don't care if Hermione or Ron knows" He muttered "I just want the lying to stop"</p><p>He closed my eyes and sighed loudly. He knew that he had been hiding him away from his friends but it was purely for him. Draco didn't realize that he cared so much about being known as 'his'. Draco's heart fluttered at the thought. He rubbed his back gently.</p><p>"Sweetheart, it's not that simple, telling people just...isn't an option," Draco told him honestly, it really wasn't.</p><p>He didn't get it, he didn't know how much hate our relationship would bring.</p><p>He tore his head out of his arms and glared at him "I didn't realize I needed your fucking permission"</p><p>He ripped his hand away and scowled at the statement. How fucking dare he speak to him like that?</p><p>"It was all for you" He angrily whispered.<br/> <br/>Harry blinked in confusion and he bit his lip at his confession but continued.</p><p>"It was all for you, you dick! I didn't tell anyone because Harry fucking Potter can not ruin his reputation with a filthy criminal!" Draco screamed out in frustration.</p><p> Everything he had hidden was not because he was ashamed! It was because he was fucking scared. He was not going to be the one to ruin Harry Potter. He had already ruined so many lives and he wouldn't take him down with Draco.</p><p>"Draco..." he whispered noticing Draco's face was wet.</p><p>He moved his hand up, rubbing at the liquid. He guessed that he had started crying without even realizing it.</p><p>"Draco" he repeated and began to caress his face.</p><p>"I can't stand the thought of losing you" He whimpered, every wall he had built up crumbling to the ground in only seconds. </p><p>Draco was tired of the lying. He was done with running, all he wanted to do was show someone how much he cared. Harry gave him a small smile and started to pepper his face in soft kisses, a gesture he had always done when Draco was sad or lonely.</p><p>"That will never happen Draco...you own my heart," He stated, with no room for error. </p><p>Draco gasped quietly, Draco Malfoy owning someone's heart? That's absurd, but instead of saying that out loud he grabbed ahold of him and hugged him with everything he had left.<br/> <br/>"So fuck them, fuck all of them! I am done being the saviour, I am done proving myself! All I want is the world to know that your mine, so who cares if a criminal stole my heart? You're all I need Draco, your happiness helps me forget why being sad is stupid, you help me live. So we will grow together and the world can go fuck themselves if they have a problem with it"</p><p>Cheesy yes, but he made a good point. This man saved him, physically of course but also romantically. He gave him joy, hope, but most importantly a reason. A reason to wake up in the morning, a reason to laugh and a reason to love. The whole world can go fuck themselves. Getting rejected has never held him back before so maybe its time to show everyone up and be representatives for a new rebellion. One that doesn't broadcast chaos and destruction, but instead proves that people can change. Not wounded enough after war to die off quickly and be forgotten. They could be revolutionary, all they needed was a chance. A beginning.</p><p>"Tomorrow" Draco simply stated and inhaled the scent of Harry's jumper.</p><p>"Tomorrow?" He questioned, clearly confused about what his statement implied.</p><p>"Tomorrow we tell my friends how you ride me all night" Draco bit his lip to stop himself from bursting out laughing. </p><p>Harry shoved him back but it was with no ill intent, the smile on his face proved it. Alongside the rosy blush creeping up his face.</p><p>"Ok then, tomorrow I tell my friends all about you getting on your knees for me" He retorted with as much conviction as he had. </p><p>Draco began to blush as well but stared him dead in the eyes and smirked. He slowly moved his face forward till their lips were brushing with each exhale.</p><p>"Scared Potter" He joked staring at the green orbs, which had regained the sparkle he missed so dearly.</p><p>"You wish" He stated before clashing their lips together.</p><p>No longer would they hold back. </p></div>
