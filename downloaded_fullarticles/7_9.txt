    <p>     Hermione Granger was an athlete, on her way to the Olympics. A true English equestrian, she dominated in her age group in both dressage and showjumping. With any horse, on any course, Hermione was a dedicated winner. She had endured enough ridicule growing up - horseback riding wasn’t a sport. She should stick to what she was good at - academics. </p>
<p>     The term before the Olympic season, Hermione could be spotted on several magazine covers, in many interviews, and was apart of a few charity shows. She was on her high horse for a damn good reason. </p>
<p>     The Olympics came quickly though, and no matter how prepared Hermione was for the event, no one could have predicted what was going to happen. </p>
<p>     She was injured, unable to ride. Unable to get back up on her horse until fully recovered. And once recovered, she wasn’t so sure she wanted to get back up in the saddle. </p>
<p>     The Burrow was going to help her find the reigns again. </p>
<p>
  <b>“Talk dirty to me,” George laughed, shoving a spoonful of cereal into his mouth. Fred smacked the back of his head as he handed his dry jacket to Hermione. Apparently turning the front garden’s sprinkler on didn’t go as easily as they had thought. </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>“I’m not wearing any underwear because you never put the bloody laundry in the bloody machine like I asked you to 100 bloody times.” Hermione scoffed, trembling from the cold hose water that was now sticking to her skin. She was irritated, and cold, and wet, and tired, and ready to give up.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>“I have never been so turned on before,” Lee agreed with George, dodging a smack from Fred instead. </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Hermione couldn’t help but smile at the three idiots. </b>
</p>
<p>     If Hermione Granger couldn’t be found on a magazine cover, Susan Bones could be. A Western rider, Susan was a barrel racer at heart with a knack for stunting. She used her skills to win both local and national competitions in order to pay for university - she would follow her mother’s footsteps to become a vet. </p>
<p>     After her younger sister was intensely bullied in the city, Susan’s mother decided to move her daughters out to the hamlet and start up operations as a large-breed clinic. The hamlet suddenly became the home that Susan never knew she needed. </p>
<p>     Living down the street from The Burrow was bound to make things interesting as Susan helps her mother adapt to the new workload and her sister adjust back to reality. </p>
<p>     Living down the street from The Burrow was the kind challenge she needed to find her own path. </p>
<p>     She became an unofficial patient of The Burrow.</p>
<p>
  <b>“Is something burning?” Susan knew that when Molly and Arthur left for the weekend, their children would need some additional adult supervision. What she didn’t know was that when Molly and Arthur left for the weekend, their children would quite literally need an actual adult to supervise.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Crammed around the kitchen table sat Percy, Audrey, Fred, George, Lee, Harry, Luna, Ron, Hermione, Pansy, Draco, Blaise, Charlie, and Theo. Ginny was at the counter, pouring another cup of tea. “Just my burning desire for you,” Ginny joked. </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Susan paused before stepping into the kitchen. </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>“Why is the toaster on fire?”</b>
</p>
<p>     Four strangers, four children, were scouted and slotted into a publicity stunt called the Core Four. In their early teen years, Draco Malfoy, Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott, and Pansy Parkinson were trained to become starlets in their own fields. They would grow and develop as a group, giving the world a group of friends that people around the world could, in theory, relate to. </p>
<p>     Draco Malfoy was a naturally gifted musician. Draco was scouted into the Core Four at thirteen, while performing at his high school’s talent show. His voice was strong even as a child, and with the Core Four training, became a chart-topping performer. Draco was the leader of the Core Four, answering interviewers, in the middle of group shots, and most importantly, the fan favourite. After releasing his fifth number one single, the fame got to his head and Draco fell into the wrong crowd.</p>
<p>
  <b>“I love being the third wheel.”</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Neither Harry nor Ginny corrected him.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>“It’s so fun.”</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>It was going to be a long drive into the city if he continued this way.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>“This isn’t sarcasm.”</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Harry frowned in Draco’s direction, instinctively hanging his arm around Ginny’s shoulders as she drove the truck. Suddenly the chore of picking Percy and Audrey up from the airport was much more challenging.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>“No, definitely not.”</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Draco huffed, irritated that neither of the farm-folk were paying him any attention.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>“Shut up, would you?” Ginny stated hottily. “Harry and I aren’t together, so you’re not a third wheel. More of an annoying squeaking tire on a dumb tricycle that I need to change when we get back to The Burrow.”</b>
</p>
<p>     Blaise Zabini was beautiful. He knew it, everyone knew it. While growing up, his beauty was inside and out as he warmed the hearts of those around him and strived to be the best he could be at everything he did. Being beautiful wasn’t a skill, but using his beauty to get far in life was a talent. The Core Four recruited him to become a top model at fourteen. He felt held back because he was the eldest trainee and therefore worked the hardest in their networking endeavors. Blaise was willing to do anything to climb the ladder of success, but no one told him that the ladder was crowded and the fall was far. </p>
<p>
  <b>“I always forget how good you are at that.” Blaise pulled a clean shirt on for the day, keeping contact with Pansy as she watched. Hermione had wandered out of the room, ready for the day, leaving Pansy with the rest of the Core Four.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>“Good at what?” Pansy crouched down to tie her bootlaces, still looking up to Blaise. </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>“Lying.” Blaise was short in his reply. Hearing Pansy lie to Hermione about their past relationship was intriguing at the least. </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>“I’m an actress.” Pansy reminded him softly. “Lying is my job.”</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>“And looking pretty is mine.” Blaise glanced back to Theo and Draco who were still motionless in their bunks. “But you don’t see me posing in front of potential friends.”</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>“Right, cause you don’t pose in front of friends. You pose in front of people who you find a use for.” Pansy wouldn’t take being told that Blaise wasn’t faking his way through this whole ordeal. “You see potential in Granger, so you’re pulling the charm over her eyes. You’re not you right now, and that’s okay. We’re working. I’m lying, you’re posing.”</b>
</p>
<p>     Theodore Nott was born into stardom, much to his dismay. His father was a mystery writer and his aunt was an infamous lawyer. All Theo wanted to do though, was to play football. To stay out of the spotlight, he hid on the field and practised whenever he had the chance. He came to realize that the field wasn’t exactly a place to be covered and instead threw him into an area as the Core Four recruited him to be their athlete. He signed for Manchester United, youngest in history, with media training through the Core Four. Much to Theo’s dismay, simply being good at soccer wasn’t all that it was going to take to become the best.   </p>
<p>
  <b>“Loyalty is having someone’s back, behind their back.” </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Bill never had much to say, but when he spoke, those around him listened. </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Theo now understood why. </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>“So, you should be asking yourself, if you turn around, who are you going to see?”</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Theo’s eyebrows scrunched together, wanting to take a deeper meaning to wise words, but all he truly wanted to do was to turn around on his heel and see who was there. “What if no one is there?”</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>“Why don’t you take a look?”</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Oh, okay, Theo thought, taking a peek over his shoulder to see what Bill saw. </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Draco, Blaise, and Pansy were busy finishing up the stall he had started. They didn’t need to help, as they had already done their share of the chore, and yet there they were, chatting loudly while scooping up horse shit. </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Bill tipped his hat in the most cowboy-fashion way Theo could imagine, and walked away from the stable. </b>
</p>
<p>     Pansy Parkinson announced at her kindergarten graduation that she would be famous one day. It was cute at the time, and it was absolutely true. She enrolled in several acting classes while performing in school plays, city musicals, and taking on national commercial jobs in elementary school. She was scouted into the Core Four after being seen in an ad at the age of nine. Pansy thrived in the Core Four training and truly did know her job the best. She would walk to the end of the earth with her Core Four co-stars, and before she knew it, she fell into the same hole the other three found. </p>
<p>
  <b>“Fight me!” </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Draco glanced down to his co-worker with regret. Pansy could be terrifying when she wanted to be, but Ron didn’t seem all that scared. </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>“Stop telling everyone to fight you, look at how small you are!” Draco stepped between Pansy and the man that was twice her height. </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>“My height doesn’t affect my ability to snap someone’s neck in 97 different ways! Including yours!” Pansy spat haughtily, sneaking a look around Draco to stare at Ron. </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>“You can’t even reach my neck.” Draco couldn’t help himself. </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>“Do you really want to test me now? Because I see my step stool just a foot away from me. Do Not Make Me Use It!” Pansy, though over a foot shorter than Draco, managed look him dead in the eyes as she threatened him. </b>
