  <strong>***Tuesday 20th of June 1978 grounds of Hogwarts***</strong>
</p><p>The school year was coming to an end, today the 7th year students would be graduating Hogwarts there were no classes for the 7<sup>th</sup> years, so everyone just hung out doing whatever they wanted.</p><p> Meanwhile four friends could be seen sitting under a tree talking laughing and eating since it was lunch. Among the group of friends was Lily Evans, a tall 18-year-old muggle born witch with long red hair and emerald green eyes.</p><p> Although Lily was in Gryffindor, her Partner along with Her friends were all from Slytherin, which was never easy but she wasn’t going to let her HOUSE dictate who she could love and who her friends could be.</p><p>In fact, her best friend of 9 years Severus Snape, a long and lanky wizard with shoulder length black hair black eyes and a slightly crooked nose was also in Slytherin, their friendship was tested 3 years ago.</p><p>When after being embarrassed by James Potter a house mate of Lily’s and leader of a group of Gryffindor’s called the marauders, and after Lily herself came to his rescue, he called her a Mudblood.  It took them 6 months before they were able to patch up their friendship and now they are as strong as ever. During her break down with Severus, Lily began dating his fellow Slytherin Tom Riddle. Severus wasn’t happy when he learned they were dating as he did not trust Riddle but for Lily’s sake and happiness he kept his mouth shut. During her relationship with Tom and her friendship with Severus she got to know 2 other Slytherins, Narcissa black and her partner Lucius Malfoy.</p><p>Both were pureblood but did not care that Lily was a Muggleborn the lowest of the low in pure blood eyes, as the friends continued talking they were unaware that Lily's Partner Tom Riddle was standing nearby concealed the shadows of the shade of a nearby tree and was watching them well his girlfriend mainly. To him nothing was more beautiful than his girlfriend the young yet powerful witch sitting under a tree with three of his fellow Slytherins.</p><p>He continued to spy on his girlfriend and his fellow Slytherins.</p><p>Although he hid it well, Tom despised any wizard who showed Lily affection that included Lily's best friend and his fellow Slytherin Severus Snape and Gryffindor’s golden boy James Potter, as Tom continued watching Lily with her friends Severus Lucius and Narcissa.</p><p>He gave a sinister smile.</p><p><em>You belong to me Lily.</em> He thought possessively </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Lily was still chatting with her friend when a cold chill went down her spine as she felt like she was being watched, her head snapped up and she looked around, Tom backed further into the shadows so not to be, seen by his girlfriend. Severus saw Lily scanning the area around her    </p><p>“What is it Lil?” asked Severus.</p><p>Lily stopped scanning the grounds and looked at her Best friend.</p><p>“Oh, it’s nothing Sev,” said Lily.</p><p><em>I could have sworn someone was watching me</em> thought Lily.</p><p>She glanced around once more before she went back to talking with her friends.</p><p>Severus was not convinced that it was not, nothing.</p><p> “Lil are you sure you ok?” he asked.</p><p> While laying his hand on top of hers.</p><p>From where he was Tom saw Severus touch Lily his eyes flash with Hatred for the black-haired wizard.</p><p><em> Lily is MINE no one is supposed to touch her</em> thought Tom.</p><p>Feeling the anger will up inside him he reached his hand inside his robe pocket and gripped his wand.</p><p> Lily on the other hand just gave Severus a smile.</p><p>The best friends were having a this very serious yet silent conversion.</p><p>“Aw look at the two love birds.” Lucius gushed</p><p> The silent exchange was broken by his words the two shook their heads ending their silent conversion Lily’s head snapped over to the blond wizard.</p><p>“LUCIUS” Lily hissed</p><p>“What” he asked her</p><p>“Do you know what Tom would do to you if he heard you say that?” Lily warned</p><p>Lucius face went pale.</p><p>“Oops sorry Lil.”</p><p>“It's ok, just DON'T say it again” Lily warned.</p><p>Their little talk was suddenly interrupted by Gryffindor’s golden boy, walking over with his friends, Remus Sirius and Peter.</p><p>“Well, well, well, if it isn’t the snake in lioness’s clothing how you are doing, Evans” said James mockingly.</p><p>“Watch your mouth Potter” said Severus.</p><p>While stand up and whipping out his wand out.</p><p>“What was that Snivellus” James challenged.</p><p> He also drew out his wand.</p><p> Lily Lucius and Narcissa looked at each other and stood up, Lily stood just behind Severus the other three boys grinned.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it Potter” said Lily.</p><p>Stepping out behind Severus, she Lucius and Narcissa drew their own wands out.</p><p>“What you going to do Lily, hex me” James asked sarcastically.</p><p>“No, don’t guys just walk away” said Narcissa.</p><p>“You’re not worth my spells anyway Potter” said Lily.</p><p>She pocked her wand and turned away.</p><p>The boys did the same, the group just walked across the grounds towards the archway of the outer corridors  </p><p>Unfortunately for James, Tom saw the encounter.</p><p><em>I will not let you get away with disrespecting my Lily, Potter</em>   </p><p>Narrowing his dark eyes, Tom took out his wand and used a non-verbal jinx on James.</p><p>The jinx hit James in the back, every other student that was insight gasp in shock, hearing the shocked gasp, Lily Severus Lucius and Narcissa turned around halfway from the building to found out what the commotion was all about. Yet seeing James Potter Gryffindor’s golden boy hanging upside down by his ankles they burst out laughing.</p><p>“Not so funny when someone does it to you, is it Potter” Severus mocked. “You know what they say about payback”</p><p>“It’s a bitch” Lily chuckled.</p><p>However, her laughter died when she felt that same sensation from earlier.</p><p><em>That is, it I KNOW someone is watching me</em> thought Lily </p><p>When she scanned the grounds for a second time behind James she saw HIM her partner Tom Riddle, standing under the shade of a tree,</p><p>Lily saw Tom had his wand out, following the line of the wand to where it stopped, she saw it was Tom who put the jinx on James</p><p>Lily looked at Tom; his dark eyes stared back at her.</p><p>Lily’s eyes widened when she saw Tom mouth the words.</p><p> ‘That is for you.’</p><p>Nodding over to where James was still hanging upside down.</p><p>Lily’s eyes widened in Horror.</p><p>Tom smiled and winked at her.</p><p>Before using the counter jinx on James and slunk back into the shadows. As James lay crumbled on the ground, Lucius stood over him his wand out and pointing down at the fallen Gryffindor.</p><p>Lily and Severus turn back and continued walking back to the building</p><p>“Forget it Luc,” said Narcissa.</p><p>But Lucius wouldn't budge.</p><p>Narcissa rolled her eyes, walked up behind him, grabbed Lucius's ponytail and walked off, dragging Lucius behind her by his ponytail. </p><p>“What whoa hey, hey wait ow Cissy cut it ow out?” said, Lucius.</p><p>“stop your whining you, big baby” said Narcissa.</p><p>Lily and Severus stopped in the arch way of the outer corridor and turned back to face the grounds however when they saw Narcissa dragging Lucius behind her by his hair they burst out laughing in fact they were laughing so hard They had to hold on to each other to keep them both from falling over.</p><p>“Thanks for the support guys” Lucius grumbled</p><p>While fixing up his ponytail.</p><p>Narcissa smiled.</p><p>Severus and Lily gave was last chuckle before walking off down the corridor</p><p>Narcissa and Lucius followed.</p><p>“Severus, you know how I was scanning the grounds” said Lily</p><p>“Yeah”</p><p>“Well I got that uncomfortable creepy feeling like I was being watched, and I felt it again just now”</p><p>"Who do you think it was?” asked Narcissa.</p><p>“It was Tom he was also the one to use the jinx on James.</p><p>“That guy is seriously un hinged” said Severus.</p><p>“Not to mention possessive” said Lucius  </p><p>“Yes, I know which is why I told you to close your mouth earlier Luc”</p><p>“Then WHY are you still dating him you know he’s becoming a dark wizard right” said Narcissa.</p><p>Lily thinned her lips.</p><p>Closed her eyes and nodded.</p><p>“Watch yourself Black”</p><p>They turned to see Tom standing there.</p><p>“Beside I would have done that to ANYONE who disrespected my witch” replied Tom.</p><p>He walked over and put his arm around Lily.</p><p>"Although. I will do much worse if I ever....”  however, he got cut off.</p><p>Lily put her hand on his cheek.</p><p>“Calm down Tom its ok I’ am alright see” said Lily.</p><p>“Yes, that you are Lily my dear." said Tom.</p><p>He gave her a smile.</p><p>Severus Narcissa and Lucius both breathed a sigh of relief when they saw that Tom was not going to lose his temper they have seen Tom lose his temper before and it was not pretty.</p><p>Suddenly Lily squealed as Tom picked her up and raced off.</p><p>All Lucius Severus and Narcissa could hear was Lily’s sequels and Tom’s laughter, they looked at each other and shook their heads sadly.</p><p>Lucius put his arm around Narcissa.</p><p>Together the Trio walked off down the corridor.</p><p> “Tom is controlling; Lily may seem happy but we know she isn't.” said Lucius.</p><p>“You right about that,” said Narcissa.</p><p>“I hear you mate” said Severus.</p><hr/><p>
  <strong>***moaning myrtle’s bathroom/ chamber of secrets***</strong>
</p><p>Meanwhile Tom opened the door to moaning myrtle’s bathroom and set Lily back on her feet. Taking her hand, he walked her over to the sinks, standing in front of the sink, Lily closed her eyes she knew something was changing in Tom, he had been different ever since he learned that he was a descendent of Salazar Slytherin.  </p><p>
  <em>We've been dating for three years however some time during 5th year things began changing he’s dabbling in dark magic and its scaring me, Killing Myrtle was the first act since then my hopes and dreams with Tom have been crumbling down all he REALLY cares about is killing all the muggle born and gaining power I want to leave him but I'm afraid he'll kill me at the moment I'm an exception to the killing muggle-burn’s rule but how long will it last</em>
</p><p>Toms voice broke Lily out of her thoughts</p><p>“Lily love come on”</p><p>Lily blinked and saw he had already opened the chamber.</p><p>The couple embraced before jumping down the dark winding tunnel they slipped and slide down until they came to a hard landing at the bottom.</p><p>"Ow" Lily cried out.</p><p>As she landed on the hard floor</p><p>Tom gave a grunt of pain when his back hit the bottom, slowly getting to his feet he turned and held out his hand to Lily, taking his hand, he pulled his girlfriend to her feet, they dusted each other off before walking down the tunnel. They walked for who knows how long until they came to a door with snakes printed on the stone.   </p><p>Tom steps forward.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>“Open”</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>The snakes moved back and the tunnel door opened, entering they continued down the tunnel in front of them, at the end of the tunnel it opened into a big chamber lined with snake heads.</p><p>“Tom what are we doing here?” asked Lily.</p><p>“I wanted some time alone with you” said Tom</p><p>Lily gave a small smile.</p><p>“That’s sweet of you Tom”</p><p> With a swish of his wand music began playing.</p><p>“Care to dance Miss Evans”</p><p>Lily smiled Shyly.</p><p>“I’d love to Mr Riddle”</p><p>He took her in hand and pulled her into his arms and they began waltzing around the chamber.</p><p>“Say Tom what are you going to do when you leave here?” asked Lily.</p><p>“Well I was thinking about traveling with some of the boys Evan rosier Malik Mulciber and Augustus Avery and Corban Yaxley.”</p><p>“Corban Yaxley but Tom he is only 14 he is not even out of Hogwarts yet”</p><p>"I’ve already taken the boy under my scales so to speak and it’s the summer anyway so I’ll have him back before the new school year”</p><p>Lily shuddered suddenly at the thought of those wizards Malik Gus and Evan she always got a bad vibe with those three Severus always said that they were as dark as Tom</p><p>Seeing Lily shudder Tom grew concerned.</p><p>“Lily dear are you alright?”</p><p>“Yeah I think it’s getting a bit chilly down here is all”   </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
