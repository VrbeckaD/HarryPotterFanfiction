          <div class="userstuff"><p>Percy and Annabeth were sitting at a café, drinking hot chocolates. The shopping centre was busy with Christmas shoppers. The couple were relaxing on a Saturday afternoon, trying not to think about their copious amounts of homework when a shout rose from a crowd outside the shop.</p>
<p>The people outside the café had amassed around something. They stood shoulder to shoulder in a growing group, all trying to see what was in the middle of the circle. Percy and Annabeth finished their drinks and left the store to go have a look. They pushed their way to the front, and saw a small basilisk-like creature there.</p>
<p>“It’s a snake!” shouted a woman.</p>
<p>“No, it’s a lizard!” yelled another.</p>
<p>“Please stand back,” Annabeth yelled over the hubbub. “Centre staff will review the issue, please return to your shopping.”</p>
<p>Most of the shoppers returned to the surrounding shops.</p>
<p>“That was impressive, how did you do that?” Percy asked.</p>
<p>“A bit of mist control. Hazel has been teaching me, and I can do some basic illusions.”</p>
<p>Over the other side of the atrium, four kids were walking together. They walked in pairs, but they all seemed to be sharing a joke. The kid with black hair, not dissimilar to Percy’s, noticed the creature, and pointed it out to his friends.</p>
<p>“Is that a… baby basilisk, or a really big salamander?” he asked his companions.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” the one with frizzy brown hair answered. “Maybe if we get a bit closer I can work it out.”</p>
<p>The group approached Percy, and he overheard the brown haired girl.</p>
<p>“It does look like a cross between a basilisk and a salamander, but it doesn’t quite match the description of either.”</p>
<p>Annabeth walked over the group.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, would you happen to have any knowledge on this creature?” she asked them. “Only I overheard your discussion, and wondered if you could help. If it is a basilisk, we need to remove it from the premises.”</p>
<p>“Who are you?” the red haired boy asked.</p>
<p>“Annabeth Chase and Percy Jackson. And you?”</p>
<p>“Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger and Ginny Weasley,” Harry said, pointing at each person in turn. “Do you have a plan to get rid of it?”</p></div>
