    <p>She could see a kaleidoscope of colors surrounding her, the sounds of voices engulfing her.</p><p>She could hear her friends’ laughter, the same growls and whines that echoed off the walls of an old house, the angry tree whipping its branches at her, their feet smacking the halls as they ran from Filch.</p><p>She managed to catch glimpses here and there of moments from her life and then things and people she had never seen before.</p><p>The sound of wind rushing in her ears made her head pound and her eardrums pop.</p><p>She could still hear their heavy boots stomping up her old front porch, slamming into her old house.</p><p>She could still hear her mother and sisters’ yells as they were killed, murdered. The heartbroken grunt that escaped her father’s throat as he struggled against his captors, and then the wet sound of his head being brutally cut from his body.</p><p>She remembered the metallic smell of her family’s blood as it seeped into the floorboards and dripped onto her face between the cracks.</p><p>She remembered staying in her hiding place for days, weeks, or even months—she couldn’t remember anymore. All she remembered was sitting beneath the hidden trapdoor, in the exact same position, with her family’s blood crusted onto her skin and hair, and feeling herself desiccating as time passed.</p><p>Suddenly, she started to fall faster than she ever had before. The images surrounding her sped up and the air whipped at her face so harshly that she felt her eyes dry up.</p><p>Within seconds, all the images vanished as if they were made of smoke, and she could feel the air around her become cold. The images and colors were replaced with gray clouds and fog.</p><p>It took her a moment to realize that she was falling through clouds.</p><p>As quick as they came, the clouds disappeared and she was suddenly falling through open air. Below her, the quidditch pitch was packed with people in the stands. The pitch wasn’t set up for the games of quidditch that typically frequented the grounds. Instead, there was a rocky surface in place of the field. A very major difference was that now, instead of quidditch players and Madam Hooch acting as referee, there was a very large Hungarian Horntail dragon in the middle of the pitch and a tiny figure—it took her a moment to realize it was a wizard—shooting curses and jinxes at it.</p><p>The closer she got to the ground, the quicker she realized that she was screaming, which caught the attention of the crowd, who, was now, screaming as well. Of course, seeing a teenage girl in Hogwarts robes falling from the sky for no visible reason was bound to cause a bit of panic.</p><p>She flew past the tips of the flags, past the top row of the stands, and could very clearly see the harsh, rocky ground when she finally yelled “Arresto momentum!”</p><p>The weight of the spell wasn’t as strong as she had hoped, but, luckily, she heard numerous voices shout different varieties of cushioning charms and such that she felt her fall finally slow.</p><p>Her body hit the rough ground surprisingly softly and felt her body melt into it. She wondered how long it had been since she had laid down.</p><p>She could hear the Horntail roaring and spurting out fire somewhere near-by—could actually feel the heat of the fire singe the tips of her hair—but she couldn’t bring herself to care.</p><p>“Professor Lupin! Professor Dumbledore!” a voice shouted. The sound of running and someone sliding on the rocks beside her head shocked her enough that, when they gripped her shoulder, her body reacted on pure protective instinct.</p><p>Her head snapped at the stranger and her lips raised into a snarl, her fangs on full display. She had him by the throat, stopping any curses from escaping his lips, before she froze.</p><p>She saw the messy black hair, the pale complexion, the round glasses, but the eyes didn’t match her memories. Neither did the scar laying underneath his fringe.</p><p>“Incarcerous!” a familiar, yet unfamiliar voice shouted. Before she could react, thick ropes shot out of the wizard’s wand and engulfed her body.</p><p>She opened her mouth to shout a curse when she stopped short. Standing before her was a tall, thin man in a practically threadbare trench coat and tan slacks. She could see the faint lines of scars tracing his face, and a pair of green eyes peeking out from underneath his unkempt hair. She recognized this man.</p><p>She recognized each and every scar on his face and hands. She recognized the trench coat that a trio of mischievous boys—their boys—gave to him for Christmas their fourth year when he told the group he wanted to come back to be a professor. She recognized the same wand that she had once dueled against multiple times in first year when they were still “natural born enemies.” She recognized the sad eyes that stared at her, giving her the same baffled look when she turned his prank around on him second year. She recognized him completely, and she could tell that he undoubtedly recognized her.</p><p>“Veronica?” he whispered.</p><p>The rocky quidditch pitch was becoming very full of students, professors, and even parents. She could see flashes from Rita Skeeter’s dreadful camera from the corner of her eye. The boy she had almost attacked—the one who had everything except the eyes right—was not alone anymore. A tall, gangly ginger boy, another tall boy but with white blonde hair and a short, bushy haired girl had joined him. The girl had her wand partially raised, with the boy tucked safely behind her and a fierce expression painted on her face.</p><p>However, none of this mattered to her because she finally saw one of her best friends for the first time in what must have been years, except he was so much different than she remembered.</p><p>She straightened up as much as she could in the uncomfortably tight ropes, and sent him a lazy smirk, her fangs on full display. A smirk he had seen countless times before almost twenty years ago, and it made his heart drop to see it again.</p><p>“Miss me, Moony?”</p>
