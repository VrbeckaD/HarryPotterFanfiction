    <p>A hundred soulless bodies piled at the gate, all groaning or just staring ahead blankly. Yesterday, it had been dozens; the day before they barely had ten banging on the wrought-iron. Tomorrow, they would have thousands.</p>
<p>It started small at first, localized in a small town where the creatures began crawling out of their graves at their master's bidding. Voldemort had maybe two scores of these monsters when Severus left the ranks. Dumbledore couldn't blame him, any who were not loyal to the Dark Lord was torn apart by his undead army. Severus had seen it happen, he was afraid to be next. So he fled. And Hogwarts became a stronghold against the dead masses.</p>
<p>They recalled as many students as possible, offering asylum to the families of those who returned. Severus had only seen the castle full once before, and the future looked as bleak then as it did now. Many of his Slytherin students refused, he knew why.</p>
<p>Potter and his friends sealed the gates, while Dumbledore and McGonagall strengthened the wards. The entire Order now resided within the walls of the school. It was getting crowded, and now, the village of Hogsmeade was abandoned, though the wards would never make it that far. Severus resigned himself to the dungeons, brewing potions for the sick and injured. One day he may as well be making nutrition potions so they don't all die from starvation.</p>
<p>London was the first to go black. The hordes tore through the city with abandon, destroying anyone in their path. The Ministry held out for a few days, with its new Anti-Death Eater detection and deflection method. Honestly, who would stand in the toilet to go to work anyway? The Daily Prophet churned out a paper almost every hour, always displaying the names of the people gone missing or dead. Sometimes there would be an accompanying photo, but Severus couldn't bring himself to look at them after the first one. Jane Doe; Muggle, eviscerated. Literally, her guts were strewn across the asphalt of the street, she looked more goo than human.</p>
<p>Then the papers stopped, and the Ministry fell into a pile of ashes under the streets of what used to be London.</p>
<p>Then the whole country went to shit, and then the rest of the world. Severus was certain there were pockets of civilization all over, hiding from the inevitable onslaught of grasping fingers and white eyes. Both magical and Muggle. His own father had been one of those people, stock-piling goods, gathering the best weapons, learning to live without electricity and magic. There were bound to be others, like the Granger family, just bunkered in and waiting for rescue.</p>
<p>But Potter wasn't ready. Six times he stood against the might of Voldemort, each time revealed how truly immortal the Dark wizard had become. And last time, they almost lost Potter to the horde. If Severus didn't know better, Potter would be out searching for that last Horcrux and they would inevitably lose the boy to the wilderness.</p>
<p>Not that it wasn’t a <em> pleasant </em> idea.</p>
<p>Severus sneered at the hand that reached for his coat.</p>
<p>The fingers were long, spider-like in their thin grace. The milky white eyes saw nothing more than something to eat, to destroy. He pulled out his wand and cast a soundless, non-verbal fire spell at the head attached to the offending hand. The body burned, emitting a screeching wail, a few octaves higher than any normal human. The others ran away from the fire, into the woods, into the village. They would always come back.</p>
<p>But Severus didn’t know how much longer they could stand.</p>
