  <b> <em>August 2005 </em> </b>
</p><p>For years, Narcissa Malfoy had warned the Ministry that the manor's wards had been compromised by Voldemort, giving anyone with a Dark Mark unfettered access to the property. </p><p>She was not a curse breaker and, as a Malfoy only by marriage, she lacked any innate ability repair the wards herself. But the Aurors and MLE, if not entirely indifferent, were spread too thin to prioritize the widow of one Death Eater and mother of another.</p><p>And so it was, on the very first night after Draco Malfoy was released from Azkaban on parole, fugitive Death Eaters broke into Malfoy Manor, interrupting the quiet dinner he was having with his mother.</p><p>When the Death Eaters arrived, Draco was in no shape to put up a fight. He was fortunate to still be in his right mind, having served his time in Azkaban's minimum security wing. While that section of the prison was guarded by humans instead of Dementors, Azkaban still deserved its reputation as the wizarding world's harshest prison.</p><p>"<em>Expelliarmus</em>!" two male voices cried in succession, leaving Draco and Narcissa defenseless.</p><p>Six Death Eaters had invaded the Malfoy's dining room: Rodolphus and Rabastan Lestrange, Augustus Rookwood, Virgil Crabbe, and the senior and junior Gregory Goyles. The last, formerly Draco's friend and follower, would not meet his eyes, but the rest stared at him with unadulterated loathing. Draco had no trouble identifying them or discerning the expressions on their faces, since none of them had bothered to wear their masks.</p><p>"Well, isn't this a pleasant family gathering," Rodolphus sneered. "My traitorous bitch of a sister-in-law and her turncoat bastard of a son."</p><p>Narcissa made to snap her fingers to summon the Malfoy house-elves for assistance, but Rookwood grabbed her wrist with viper-like speed and twisted it, drawing a pained cry from her lips.</p><p>Draco expected the green light of the Killing Curse, or at least the searing pain of a <em>Crucio</em>, but instead Crabbe - his dead friend's father, and a man who had been like an uncle to him - grabbed his upper arm in a bruising grip and Apparated with him.</p><p>They landed in a marshy field. A multi-storied, ramshackle house, its windows glowing in a welcoming fashion in the late summer twilight, was visible through the reeds. Draco had no idea where he was, but it did not have the look of a Death Eater hideout.</p><p>With a pop, Rookwood appeared next to them with Narcissa, still gripping her wrist. His mother's blue eyes met Draco's grey ones, and he felt pathetically relieved that she was still alive and unharmed.</p><p>"Are they all inside?" Lestrange asked a seventh Death Eater who had been waiting for them in the field, acting as a lookout. Unlike the others, he was wearing his mask, the silvery material twisting his mouth into a leer.</p><p>"Yes," Dolohov confirmed, his accent giving away his identity. "Eight of them. Two more came through the Floo just minutes ago. Potter and the Mudblood bitch I should have killed years ago."</p><p>"Working late at the Ministry - such diligent little bureaucrats!" Rabastan chortled.</p><p>"<em>Homenum Revelio</em>." Rodolphus cast the spell at the crooked little house, eight darting balls of light confirming the Russian's intelligence. He smiled grimly. "I've been waiting seven long years to avenge my Bella."</p><p>"Time to roast some Weasels in their Burrow!" Rabastan said with gleeful anticipation. "What a terrible way to die," he added, with a sly glance towards Crabbe. "So very painful."</p><p>Virgil's hand tightened painfully on Draco's upper arm. "I'm sorry," he whispered to the burly wizard. "I tried to save Vince. Potter tried, too."</p><p>There was not a life debt owed, since the younger Crabbe still had died, but Draco thought perhaps he could get through to the father. Then, with Greg helping, or at least staying out of the fray, he and his mother might have a fighting chance to escape.</p><p>"One more word from you and I'll cut out your tongue," Rodolphus threatened. "You can't talk your way out of this like Lucius used to."</p><p>Draco swallowed hard and fell silent, knowing his uncle was not bluffing.</p><p>"Put up the Anti-Disapparition wards," Rookwood ordered in a cold voice, raising his wand. The others followed suit, casting a combination of spells that would trap the Weasley family in their burning home.</p><p>A chilling smile spread across Rodolphus's face as he raised an all-too-familiar hawthorn wand.</p><p>"No! You can't use Draco's wand!" his mother protested.</p><p>"Can't I?" Rodolphus asked, his eyes gleaming cruelly. "Would you prefer to do the honors?"</p><p>She drew in a deep breath. "I would, if you promise me that Draco lives. He was always loyal to the Dark Lord, and did his best for him despite being just a boy. I'm the one who betrayed him."</p><p>"That you did," Rookwood hissed. </p><p>"Draco will die eventually, but it need not be tonight," Lestrange agreed, too quickly.</p><p>Narcissa's eyes narrowed, making her look almost as dangerous as Bellatrix. "Nothing like the Longbottoms, either."</p><p>"On my magic, none of us will harm even a hair on ickle Drakey's head," Rodolphus promised. “If you do it.”</p><p>With a growing sense of horror, Draco realized his mother had not even sought any protection for herself. He opened his mouth to protest.</p><p>"<em>Silencio</em>," muttered Greg, with a poke of his wand to Draco's ribcage.</p><p>"But you will use Draco's wand," Rookwood added, implacably. "You have so little to bargain with, Narcissa. Your son will be a wanted man, like us, but he need not die right now, in front of your eyes."</p><p>"Malfoy should not get to live in luxury in his manor while the rest of us are chased after like stray dogs. Let the Aurors hunt him, too," Dolohov growled, to mutters of agreement.</p><p>"Do it, Cissy," Rodolphus growled, holding out the hawthorn wand for her to grasp. "Or Draco dies."</p><p>With an anguished glance at her son, she took it, pointing it towards the Burrow with the tip shaking. "<em>Incendio gehénnam</em>!"</p><p>The first few flames were pretty, like glowing flowers, but they quickly caught on the reeds and transformed into fiery monsters that raced towards the house and the oblivious family trapped inside.</p><p>Draco had been on a few Death Eater raids where fire had been used, but never Fiendfyre. It was too dangerous, too uncontrollable. He looked away, sickened. He had never been a fan of the so-called Golden Trio, but his term in Azkaban had given him plenty of time for introspection. He no longer considered Potter to be his worst enemy, but even if he had, Draco still would not have wished this horrific death upon him.</p><p>The Lestrange brothers, Rookwood, and Dolohov looked at the burning house with rapturous eyes, reveling in the screams that were audible even above the roaring Fiendfyre and crackling wood. Crabbe and Goyle watched with impassive faces. Greg was trying to imitate his father, but Draco noticed he was unable to look at the inferno that had been a home. Instead, his eyes were fixed on a distant point on the horizon.</p><p>Narcissa took advantage of their captors' distraction to once more meet his eyes. "Go to the one place where no one would expect you to go, my dragon," she whispered. "I love-"</p><p>"<em>Avada Kedavra</em>," Rookwood snapped, cutting off her last words.</p><p>Draco, still silenced, looked at him with burning eyes and wished desperately that looks could kill.</p><p>Rookwood turned his wand on him. "<em>Petrificus Totalus</em>," the former Unspeakable said, smiling as Draco toppled to the ground, next to his mother's corpse. "Roddy promised we wouldn't hurt you, but there's no reason why we can't leave you behind for the Aurors to find."</p><p>"And the Aurors haven't made any promises to your dead mum not to hurt you," Rabastan said with a nasty laugh. "I'm not sure you'll even be alive tomorrow to receive the Dementor's Kiss."</p><p>"It's done," Dolohov stated. With Narcissa's death, the Fiendfyre had burnt itself out - too late for the survival of anyone who had been inside the home. He held out an old umbrella. "Everyone get a hand on it."</p><p>The other Death Eaters hastened to obey. Greg gave him one last guilt-stricken glance, mouthing an apology as the Portkey activated, leaving Draco to his fate.</p><p>In the near distance, closer to the smoldering ruins of what had been the Weasley home, he could hear the pops of incoming Apparition as the Aurors arrived at the Burrow. He had minutes left of his oh-so-brief freedom, before he was hauled back to Azkaban or summarily Kissed. And his mother - the one person in the world who loved him without placing conditions on her affection - was dead, staring up at the star-speckled sky with sightless eyes.</p><p>Draco's throat constricted as he fought back a sob. Malfoy men didn't cry, or so Lucius had taught him. He blinked back shameful tears. He had blinked. <em>He had blinked</em>. He was no longer Petrified.</p><p>"Merlin bless you, Greg," he murmured with heartfelt appreciation. He doubted his friend had ever mastered wordless incantations; he must have muttered a <em>Finite Incantum</em>, lifting the spells that had kept Draco silent and immobile.</p><p>He rolled to his hands and knees and stealthily peered through the reeds. The Aurors were milling at the perimeter of the Burrow, but would be fanning out to search the surrounding marshland soon enough. He knelt next to his mother's body to retrieve his wand from her slack grip. With gentle thumbs, he pressed her eyelids closed. "I love you too, Mum."</p><p>He stood up and closed his eyes. With his wand clutched in his hand, Draco focused on the farthest destination that he was capable of Apparating to and did what Malfoys did best - he fled.</p>
