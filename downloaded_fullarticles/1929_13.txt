    <p>Chapter 1: Dragon’s Tail</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The streets never seem to end as I make my way towards my destination: 15800 W. Raven Rd. Long streets, one after another, raise high in my vision, but I need this. Fever consumes my body and I shake, feeling like the flu has finally found me. What I didn’t know was that the flu never feels this bad. Drops of sweat fall into my eyes and I shake them away mockingly as I re-situate my glasses. One foot, then the other pounds against the pavement and even through my fevered insanity I feel something real. Each ventricle and atrium does its job, and if I stop and slow my breathing, I swear I feel the blood rushing back and forth. I feel the aorta pumping, though, I could be completely barmy at this point. </p>
<p>All around me pavement stretches as far as my tired eyes can see. Shop after shop litters the sides of the roadway, and I walk on. I don’t know why I decided walking would make me feel better, but I did. I continue on, feeling an odd sense of strength in knowing I am only one block away from my destination. Though that block means I am walking over a mile. I must take a taxi home. I don’t know why I care though; there is no one there to go home to. Only another open play book that I can’t remember the title for, and a half empty bottle of gin, begging for me to finish it. </p>
<p>Why gin, I will never know. It just seems so perfect that it is so dry. Bombay Sapphire is the only brand I drink. I owe that to Ginny. She drank it like water on the weekends when we partied. At least before…. </p>
<p>Finally, my breathing becomes ragged and uncomfortable from the fever-induced weakness. I am a stage actor for Christ’s sake. I have stamina, wits, and I’m so poor I am now on my way to Pride County Health Centre to understand this sudden sickness. For a day or more I've felt it, each little inkling indicated the flu, but for once I hadn’t vomited yet. As I stop to catch my breath, a sign catches my attention. It is a simple sign, one I guess someone created on their home computer, but it draws my eyes. In large flamboyant lettering the flyer reads: The Dragon’s Tail. I assume it is a nightclub, but by the photos, you would think it a strip club. Scantily clad women prance about, and large crowds surround a small stage that welcome all in attendance to enjoy the new found freedom nightlife offers.</p>
<p>I snort. I feel it and quickly look around to see if anyone notices, but people shove by me without a second glance. It is a terrible feeling to be so ignored. Have I fallen so hard from the last production that I am no longer publicly lauded for my ability to bring the most masculine of men to tears? The last line of text catches my attention. For some reason four words dance in my field of vision, and even through the sickened haze, I find myself almost wanting to follow the arrows that lead to the club. Come get your Drag-on!</p>
<p>At that moment, I don’t understand, and I am blissfully ignorant. Understanding truly doesn't matter, so I look at the shop and smile at the little girl playing in the window. A pristine white dress adorns a sweet youth with all the sugar and spice the gods themselves couldn’t have formed from clay. Her two front teeth are missing, but her smile is angelic, and it brings another smile to my face. I wonder if that means that maybe my fever is imagined. But then in the cool September sun, I shiver and start to burn with fire again. I know I need water, but I don’t dare spend the last of the money in my pocket. With luck, I will be given a strong antibiotic and be on my way. </p>
<p>The Yellow Rose is the shop. I wonder what it is, but the thoughts leave when I feel weakness dragging me towards the concrete surface of the sidewalk. I know I need to get going. At the corner of each block is a dipped walkway that makes it easier for people to transition from sidewalk to road as they cross en masse. Executives storm through the chaotic rhythm that only Scottsland can offer. It makes me smile; this is home. No matter how much I loathe the Dursleys for bringing me here, this is home now. At least I went to a good college and did something with my life. </p>
<p>But my life won’t mean much if I don’t make it to the damn Health Centre soon. It is odd to think of this city as once the home of the largest American Indian Nation. It is so fitting that a city this large can be named after a European country and not the rightful peoples of the continent, but I can’t change the world. I am only one man with messy black hair and green eyes that everyone loves. Sometimes I think I don’t love myself enough or else I wouldn’t be walking my arse to the Health Centre and not driving my car. </p>
<p>I love that car, no matter how broken, beaten and abused she is. I named her Black Magic because it was with her that I met Ginny. Ginny Weasley, ginger-haired goddess that makes me want to come just looking at her. I ran out of gas one night on I-89 and she stopped, willing to help some hapless soul that was too stupid to stop and refill his gas tank. I don’t mind after the fact. I praised the gods for years for bringing her into my life. She is vibrant, wild and loved to experience so much that I was never bored. Most of the time researching my roles at the Community Theatre meant a wild role playing adventure of some kind, a way to get me in the mood of the boring parts of my job.</p>
<p>I like getting into people's minds and playing a different part. Everyone expects so much at times that I forget I am only one man. At twenty-five years old, I am still trying to find my calling. Yes, I am a brilliant actor, but I am not satisfied with my current position. Our techs are limited, so all actors help with lights, stage and costumes. Thankfully I attended one of the top theatre arts universities in the country. The curriculum emphasizes learning all aspects of the field, so even if you are an actor, you learn how to sew and design a costume, even if you don’t like it. </p>
<p>My favourite part of the theatre is becoming someone else. For upwards of two hours or more a night during a run, I can become an entirely different person and forget all of the little things in my life. It isn’t as though I take my life for granted. Hardly. I just wish it was different sometimes. I wish that the Dursleys had stayed in England because even if the weather is something I could have done without, it was comfortable. I called it home, but my alliances have changed – America is now home. I am a naturalized citizen now, and ready to partake of the American Dream, only I have no clue what that was supposed to be. </p>
<p>My accent startles many, because even in big cities like this, there are minority groups that stuck together. The Japanese stay in their part of town along with the Irish, Italian, Chinese, Indian and whatever Natives are left. No one mentions the African-American population, at least not without contempt. And the true Unspeakables of our little dominion are those of Islamic decent. I hate this little world sometimes. It is narrow and my eyes are not tunnel driven like the rest of the people. It is sad really. </p>
<p>I finally catch my breath enough to finish the long trek to the Health Centre. Only half a mile more and I can check myself in with the After Hours Emergency division. It is a Saturday; that’s the only reason I am forced to go “After Hours”. To these people, sickness can wait until Monday morning at 8:00 a.m. but they aren’t fooling me. Southern America is an unfriendly place really, and I want nothing to do with it most of the time. In reality, I use these people. They are the money that allows me to eat, to drink and drive from one job to the next without walking. </p>
<p>I can’t help but feel like an absolute prat walking around these streets. The city is like one large dustbin, dirty and unkempt like a crack whore’s wardrobe. I don’t know what I expect, but my cousin claims this is the place to be. Me, I couldn't care less. I just want to make it to the next phase of life without another problem. I have enough of those. Eviction notices, delinquent accounts on a never-ending list of credit cards I sought when the theatre scene wasn’t dry. Now all they want are pale faces with light hair, and I have neither. </p>
<p>My only unique quality is the vibrant green eyes that hide behind my rounded glasses. Ginny complimented me on them often, and I wonder if I did the same in return. Did I tell her I loved her enough, did I listen enough? Men are always accused of such things, but I think I was pretty damn good at listening when she had had a hard day. Maybe it’s just that all of the days seemed hard, so I stopped caring. </p>
<p>I step onto the black pavement outlined by white and yellow lines as the little box on the corner flashes indicating it is OK to cross. I stumble through, wishing like hell that I had driven the five blocks through the messy traffic. This city is always busy. Petrol is over four dollars a gallon, and I barely have fifty-dollars to make it until my unemployment check arrives in two days. My cupboards are bare, and I spend too much time rambling on my cell phone with the theatre director. </p>
<p>Only a few hundred feet left, and I will be at my destination. Who knows why I even bother, but my fellow actors insisted that I get myself checked out. So, here I am, on my way to another place I don’t want to be. I suppose one could dog-ear my life by the places that I didn’t want to be, there are so many. There are fewer places I want to be, though, and I am still having trouble coming to grips with that. </p>
<p>How can a Summa Cum Laude graduate not want to go places? Am I so content with mediocrity that even the mention of bigger and better makes my skin crawl? There is only one point in my life that I ever truly felt alive, and that was when I was in school. I spent a lot of time performing, but I was also doing something productive. As part of my course of study, I was required to commit to at least twenty hours a week with a local school, teaching them the basics of drama, stage, make-up or just building sets. Students are asked to take up the tuition of the primary and middle school students because there wasn’t enough money to support arts programmes. It wasn’t much, but it was worth it, and I would trade millions of dollars just to have that feeling again. I felt alive then. I was always surrounded by smiling faces that were genuine, and each student left my care with a new skill or at least hope. </p>
<p>If I could offer hope to the entire population of this city, I would spread my arms wide and jump from the highest building if such a sacrifice would bring about good things. However, I know in the end that my sacrifice would be for selfish reasons, and that is to stop feeling so damn inept at everything. Sure I am confident and poised on stage. There is nothing like standing in the middle of an auditorium full of adoring fans, but it isn’t enough. It doesn’t fulfil the gap inside me. I think that is what I hate the most, the lack of fulfilment I feel with daily life. </p>
<p>Sometimes I teach classes at the local Recreation Centre, but it doesn’t bring in a lot of money. Most of the people that attend the classes are like me. They want to find an escape from their delirious lives, and for one afternoon a week, I give them that. We talk philosophy of plays, theory behind acting techniques and which are the most practical for the piece we are working on. I am a method actor, but I am also highly familiar with Meisner. It took all of my energy to complete Meisner exercises most of the time, but I did it, and I came out of it a better person. </p>
<p>I finally reach the entrance of the Health Centre. It’s a long, flat building that houses three medical disciplines for the indigent: General Practise, Dental, and Psychological. At this building, they can take care of anything from delivering a baby to making sure your psychosis is properly monitored. Personally, I have never been to any of the shrinks, but I thought about it in the past. I wonder if maybe I am suffering from severe depression, but try to force the thoughts away most of the time, reminding myself that if I wake up everyday and walk around with even half a smile, I can’t be that depressed.</p>
<p>My logic is flawed. </p>
<p>I enter through the General Practise doors and walk down the long hallway that leads to the reception area. I have been here before, but it was only to get the necessary documentation for entrance into Catawba College. The carpet is grey and speckled with little black loops to make it appear less dirty from the large amount of traffic that sees this place. Inside, I hate looking at this place with its institutional grey wallpaper that if you follow the walls up, it leads to fluorescent lights that always hurt my eyes. The ceiling is so basic I wonder if Spiderman could stick to its flat and simple surface. </p>
<p>I arrive at the desk, where a large glass window separates me from the overweight receptionist. Her face is rounded and caked with more base than I care to imagine. Even on stage we don’t wear that much. Her eyelids are smeared with a royal blue eye shadow that makes me want to cringe. It makes me feel bad for all the animals that were experimented on so that this woman could make herself look better than she does with the assistance of powered make-up that should have been left on the shelf. Her scrubs are basic, thank god. Her face is blinding enough. Her cheeks should be scrubbed very well every night. Her pores are full of black dirt and oils, and it makes me sick. When her ruby red lips turn into a false smile, I scoff. This woman looks as though she belongs in a burlesque show, not as a receptionist at a medical facility. Even if she is a nurse, then shame on the poor fool who hired her.</p>
<p>Her podgy hand reaches out and moves the glass aside. She smiles for real. It is a shame her face is covered with, quite literally, a mask. Her smile makes her attractive and warm, unlike so many of the professionals I know. Her eyes are a brilliant cobalt blue that captures my attention. I would love to have children with eyes like that. </p>
<p>“Name?” she asks with a thick accent. It almost sounds more like she added two 'A’s' and a ‘I’ that shouldn’t be there. Her words are long, and I begin to wonder how she got here.</p>
<p>“Harry James Potter,” I reply. On stage, I am forced to use an American accent, but when I am out, my British pride remains. I like to dance vocal tangos with women as they admire my sweet Surrey drawl. I am enigmatic, and I like it that way. </p>
<p>“Date of birth?”</p>
<p>“31 July, 1980”</p>
<p>“How long has it been since you’ve been here?”</p>
<p>“Almost 8 years.”</p>
<p>“Fill this out. Do you have insurance?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Billing will speak with you after your appointment to set up a payment schedule. Have a seat; the nurse will call you soon.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>I sit down on one of the many uncomfortable chairs and wait. All around me are sick people, women, children and men who looked more strung out than laundry. I can’t suppress the shiver of discomfort that surrounds me in this place. To occupy my time, I grab one of the many magazines littering the round, white tables and wait. </p>
<p>Maybe an hour passes, I’m not sure. I finally gave up reading when my body started to shake more. I am on the verge of falling asleep when I hear my name roll off the lips of a beautiful brunette that reminds me of a school mate back in Surrey. Hermione Granger. We kept in contact over the years, I don’t know how, but we did. She ended up studying at the same school I did. She got her B.F.A. and graduated Magna Cum Laude. Everyone expected that from the most studious of women, though. </p>
<p>She and Ginny’s brother Ron ended up getting together, which I always thought was funny. They were complete opposites: She studied all the time and he partied all the time. He was on the football team and she was on the dance team. She respected art, literature and all of the sophisticated points in life, and Ron, he got wasted on torn pages of Macbeth, sticky, green marijuana adhering to the small typeface. </p>
<p>I walk gingerly towards the woman and she smiles brightly, taking me to be weighed and check my blood pressure. After everything checks out, she takes my temperature, which turns out to be a whopping 105. I feel every bit of that sickened curse running through my veins and am grateful when she ushers me to one of the many examination rooms. I answer all her questions to the best of my ability and wait. My chart goes in a box outside the door and a red tab is flipped. I am ordered to strip, and wait for the doctor.</p>
<p>Another quarter of an hour passes and the familiar knock of a practised hand pounds against the door and in strides a young, handsome man. At least he looks young for a doctor. His black hair is neat and sculpted, so far from my own. His white lab coat is clean and so crisp I wonder if I touch it if it will crack. I muse about Theodore Nott, Severus’ stage manager as I think about the contrast of my hair and the doctor’s. Nott once threatened to cut all of mine off and force me to wear wigs through every performance if I couldn’t find a way to tame the mess. </p>
<p>“What seems to be the problem today, Mr Potter?” His voice is even and deep, like a bass drum. </p>
<p>“Well, since yesterday I have had a fever that won’t go away, and I ache all over. This morning it hurt when I urinated, but other than that, I seem to be alright,” I say, feeling flushed. </p>
<p>“OK, well let’s take a look,” he says, digging in his pockets for that evil medical popsicle stick that always makes me gag. My tongue is depressed and he shines his hand light into my throat. Each poke and prod is irritating, but it needs to be done. He insists that he check my lymph nodes, so I lay back on the table and allow him the time to inspect. Each press feels heavy, but I don’t speak. He notices my winces, though, and says he want to run tests for possible STD’s. When the nurse comes in, I think I am going to die. At least the doctor took care of shoving that horrible swab into my urethra as she watched. </p>
<p>“Mr Potter, I am a little concerned about the amount of swelling in your groin. I am going to run some tests and see if anything comes back. Your symptoms are alarming. Just get dressed, and we can have the results ready within the hour. I can prescribe the proper medications once we know more.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>
<p>I dress quickly before they even step out. I’m not shy. There is no need to be in my line of work. You work nude on shows, you change with the rest of the cast; it isn’t anything new to me.</p>
<p>An hour of chills wracking my body and feeling the strange stares of the others in the room, and the nurse finally calls my name again. They lead me back to the room I was in previously, and the doctor meets with me almost immediately. </p>
<p>“Mr Potter, your preliminary tests indicate that you have contracted an STD.”</p>
<p>“What? What is it?”</p>
<p>“You have genital herpes.”</p>
