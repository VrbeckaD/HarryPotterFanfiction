So she went to Hermione one day over Summer Vacation, smiling bright because her idea. Lexie said to her happily </em>
  <em>"Mione? Can I ask you for a favor?"</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Hermione smiled at her, nodding a little, saying</em>
  <em> "Yes of course, Lexie. What is it?"</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>She smiles a little more, saying</em>
  <em> "Can I use your Time-Turner?"</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Mione looked at her confused and a little shocked, Why would Lexie need that? She wondered, then said</em>
  <em>, </em>
  <em>"Why, </em>
  <em>may I ask?"</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>She thought for </em>
  <em>a </em>
  <em>minute, if she told Mione the truth then she might not give it to her and if Lexie told her a lie then she might not trust her ever again, so Lexie said</em>
  <em> "Umm...Well</em>
  <em>,</em>
  <em> I would like to go back in time </em>
  <em>to..ummm...</em>
  <em>Meet Professor Snape."</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Hermione eyes widen and looked at Lexie like she was crazy and shocked, then she said</em>
  <em> "Are you mad? You can't go back </em>
  <em>to</em>
  <em> the past to meet him. Lexie, he is cold and bitter. He is not the guy, you want to go visit </em>
  <em>every day</em>
  <em>."</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Lexie already know this from Harry and Ronald's stories about this, but she is mad and crazy, also pitted him so yes she will go to the past, she said a little annoyed</em>
  <em> "Yes I know this, but please Mione. I want to go to the past. I'll </em>
  <em>come</em>
  <em> right back, I promise!" </em>
  <em>She bagged her with her puppy dog eyes</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Hermoine sighed and nobbed. She went to </em>
  <em>her</em>
  <em> and Ronald's room, Lexie was staying with them for the summer and then go back to Hogwarts in the autumn, Mione came back out with the Time-Turner, she looked right at Lexie at this point</em>
  <em> "Now you listen to me and please listen well. There are a few rules about going in the past, so listen good," </em>
  <em>Lexie nodded and Mione countries</em>
  <em> "Alright. Because </em>
  <em>this going</em>
  <em> take a long time to turn, we are going make our own spell with it. Can I have your wand?"</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Lexie hands over her wand over to Mione, smiling happily</em>
  <em> "Thank you so much! So how </em>
  <em>are </em>
  <em>we going to do this?"</em>
</p>
<p><em>Hermione shrugged a bit</em><em> "I didn't know yet, but I'll read up on it tonight okay and need to keep your wand until. </em><em>Do we have</em> <em>our</em><em> own spell, okay?</em></p>
<p>
  <em>Lexie nobbed</em>
  <em> "Okay and </em>
  <em>you're</em>
  <em> going to the library</em>
  <em>, </em>
  <em>aren't you? I just </em>
  <em>go</em>
  <em> up to bed now and maybe draw a little."</em>
</p>
<p><em>Mione giggles a bit</em><em> "Yes I am going to the library. And have run drawing little cuz." </em><em>Hermione walks into her own little library and puts the Time-Turner on the table with Lexie's wand, then starts looking around for </em><em>a </em><em>book on time travel. While Lexie went upstairs to the </em><em>guest</em> <em>bedroom</em><em> and </em><em>took</em><em> out her drawing book. She flipped to the page where she had a real picture of Severus and a drawing of him, she smiled to herself as she finished up the drawing</em></p>
<p>
  <em>A few days went by and still</em>
  <em>,</em>
  <em> Hermione couldn't make her own spell for traveling back in time. It was hard to make your own spell especially for time travel, but finally</em>
  <em>,</em>
  <em> she got a spell that would work</em>
</p>
