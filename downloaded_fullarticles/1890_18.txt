    <p>So this is my latest. With !SuperpoweredRon no less. This is now completely AU as I had originally intended to weave into the JK canon, but after some more thought I decided against that. Note, there will be some underage sexual activity in this story. A lot of our favorites appear and I have some interesting OCs to introduce you to as well.</p>
<p>Happy reading-Kay.</p>
<p>Seventh Son</p>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>"We are either kings among men of the pawns of kings."-Lex Luthor</p>
<p>Late 10th Century A.D, Scottish Highlands</p>
<p>Godric Gryffindor swallowed a large goblet of mead in one gulp. This contention with Salazar had to end. If it did not, surely it would mean death and quite possibly the ruination of the magical world in Britannia.</p>
<p>What had once been a happy, harmonious place for all magical children to live and learn and develop into brilliant wizards was now turning into a divided, fractured, competitive disaster.</p>
<p>He had never intended it so, for he knew he bore most of the blame. Houses had been his noble idea. A way to see what the wizards and witches were made of, to determine if they had leaders or alchemists or healers among then. He hadn't meant for this.</p>
<p>The magical community had enough to worry about with the Muggles becoming more and more wary of magic and thinking they were all slaves to the Devil and whatnot. And although they a good Pendragon King on the throne who understood the magical world, he would not be King forever. And if his pernicious sister could not be stayed, the magical world suffer.</p>
<p>All this, Godric knew. He was at somewhat of a loss as to what to do. He had not only the magical community to think of, but his students as well.</p>
<p>One in particular. One who, for better or worse, could change everything.</p>
<p>With the right guidance, he would be the Protector of the Magical world. With the wrong, he would surely be its destruction.</p>
<p>All this was weighing heavily on the aging wizard's mind when his squire, a young lad by the name of Brus came bursting through the door.</p>
<p>"My lord, Master Slytherin is gone!"</p>
<p>Godric leapt out of his chair. "And the boy?"</p>
<p>"Gone, sir," Brus said quickly, for there could have been only one boy who Godric meant.</p>
<p>"Fuck it to hell!" bellowed the fiery Gryffindor. "Wretched fool, I am. I knew he would do this. I knew and I stood back and did nothing. I am damned for this, I am certain. "</p>
<p>"My lord, what shall we do? Shall I get Mistresses Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw?"</p>
<p>Godric paused. "No. No. We tell no one of this."</p>
<p>"But sir, they're bound to noticeâ€”,"</p>
<p>"I did not ask for your word on the matter, you little fool. Salazar is gone. And the boy, the boy is dead. Swear it to me. Swear it!"</p>
<p>Brus would not argue with his master. "I swear it, my lord."</p>
<p>"Good." Godric went to his desk and quickly scrawled a note and called for his owl. "Deliver this to Merlin in the Court. To no one else. Go!"</p>
<p>Brus knew that his master had only written two words: Find them.</p>
