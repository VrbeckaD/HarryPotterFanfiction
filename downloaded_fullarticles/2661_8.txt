          <div class="userstuff"><p>(I)<br/>
She used to hide in Scarlet;<br/>
Always seeking protection from others.</p><p>They beat her bloody - day after day - and still<br/>
she was expected to serve them.</p><p>But she fled that wretched existence;<br/>
fled from her tower in the sky.<br/>
To the pitch darkness of the dungeons -<br/>
finding solace in the sinful embrace of Silver. </p><p>(II)<br/>
She was Golden. The Chosen One!<br/>
But only the battered could see it.<br/>
She gave her protection<br/>
to all of the broken beings before her</p><p>A reassuring presence<br/>
feather soft, raven hair<br/>
Soft sighs, softer touches<br/>
She made all the pain disappear.</p><p>She gives help to all who ask;<br/>
making time for all of the lost souls.<br/>
Her power is used up protecting others;<br/>
leaving nothing<br/>
to protect herself.</p><p>(III)<br/>
She hides black-tainted handprints<br/>
coming home from her summers.<br/>
She tries so damn hard to stay Scarlet!<br/>
- Sets her own bones and stitches her wounds! -<br/>
To ignore the Silver flowing through her veins;<br/>
To make sure no one else can see it.</p><p>(IV)<br/>
She was "Golden"<br/>
She fit their mold best!<br/>
If she felt hatred towards herself...<br/>
Well, that's a secret<br/>
She threw herself into danger;<br/>
Always seeking the recognition of Scarlet. </p><p>(V)<br/>
Sixteen years old,<br/>
Still just a child,<br/>
saving others from monsters!<br/>
Reapers! Darkness! Ane Evil galore!<br/>
Saving them from the darkness of the day;<br/>
nothing unusual in life as a Scarlet.</p><p>(VI)<br/>
She is a metallic beacon in oblivion.<br/>
A cunning liquid light<br/>
stuffed inside a brazen Golden shell.</p><p>She kept slipping<br/>
- Silver leaking -<br/>
onto her dyed Scarlet hands</p><p>She surreptitiously surveyed the gleaming, prideful Silver<br/>
that leaked from the Emerald Army's King </p><p>The Golden shell was set to end her;<br/>
Scarlet robes transfigured into lead;<br/>
pulling her down, intent on crushing<br/>
what little spirit she had left.</p><p>Silver screaming from its Golden cage<br/>
pleaing<br/>
for her to don the weightless Emerald garb.</p><p>(VII)<br/>
She was the "Golden Girl"<br/>
- a dancing monkey fro Scarlet men.<br/>
She was to be a pious pillar of purity.<br/>
Held together by millions of microscopic cracks.</p><p>She was Golden, Golden, Golden!<br/>
To be shared only with Scarlet men.<br/>
But she was slipping... slipping... falling!<br/>
For a darkness<br/>
that she coveted<br/>
a darkness no Scarlet could comprehend.</p><p>(VIII)<br/>
He was Grey and Green and Greatness;<br/>
flaxen hair a smooth shimmer under candlelight.<br/>
He wore his Emerald emblems with arrogance,<br/>
power seeps from his very pores<br/>
He was a King<br/>
Above the masses<br/>
- Gleaming Silver in the moonlight.</p><p>(IX)<br/>
Clothing always tailored by the finest;<br/>
Designed for every stitch<br/>
to let his silver leak through.</p><p>He hates this "Golden Girl" with ferocity.<br/>
Can see all that she is hiding;<br/>
and he desires<br/>
to crack open her shell.</p><p>Underneath all of his Grey and Green and Greatness<br/>
all he wants<br/>
is a companion made of Silver.</p><p>(X)<br/>
He and she; she and he.<br/>
They come alive during battles,<br/>
pitting wit against cunning.<br/>
Ballrooms become battlefields,<br/>
and sweet passions bloom away from searing Scarlet eyes.</p><p>She harbored, for him, a longing;<br/>
watched his Silver dance in beckoning.<br/>
He regarded her with reluctant admiration<br/>
for how deeply she had buried her Silver<br/>
behind that golden mask.</p><p>(XI)<br/>
He entertained Emerald girls in public.<br/>
She wished to rip her eyes from her skull<br/>
to avoid having to look.<br/>
She longed to drape herself in his arms.<br/>
Instead<br/>
she falls back into horribly familiar Scarlet.</p><p>(XII)<br/>
She spilled her secret Silver on a lover<br/>
and purpled at his hands.<br/>
Her secret spread to all men wearing Scarlet.<br/>
And only Silver kept her alive.</p><p>She kept on fighting, fighting, fighting...<br/>
bruising, bleeding, breaking...</p><p>Her shell was Golden, but tarnished.<br/>
Bent, faded, and scratched.<br/>
She was one touch from being shattered. </p><p>(XIII)<br/>
He was Grey and Green and Jagged.<br/>
Diamonds dripped from his pale eyes.<br/>
He stood - alone - in front of mirrors<br/>
fist buried in the glass</p><p>Blood a passionate Scarlet;<br/>
at home on his lips.</p><p>(XIV)<br/>
She crushed delicately sparkling glass<br/>
sharply beneath her heels. </p><p>His bloodied palm was gentle<br/>
as it rested on her cheek.<br/>
She could feel his Silver sliding across her skin;<br/>
begging her to join him.</p><p>She could persist in hiding no longer<br/>
not in the face of such need.<br/>
Finally<br/>
she crushed her Golden shell<br/>
and let her liquid Silver shine.</p><p>(XV)<br/>
He is Grey and Green and Greatness<br/>
with a loyal consort by his side.<br/>
She is soft and free and Silver<br/>
- shining brighter than the stars -<br/>
in a palace free from Scarlet horrors.</p></div>
