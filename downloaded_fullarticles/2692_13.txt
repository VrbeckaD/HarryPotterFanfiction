    <p>Grindelwald saw the potential in Newt. After his capture in New York, Grindelwald had quite some time to think. Grindelwald knew about Newt's case, had seen its inside first-hand. And he knew, many of those beasts the magizoologist was keeping were illegal. That he was breeding them, another crime against the laws the Ministry of Magic decided on. But he also knew that Newt would do <em>anything</em> for those creatures. That he wanted them to be free, live without worrying about being hunted by both wizards and no-majs.</p><p>Surrounded by blue fire, Credence joined him in his circle. Newt had tried to get to him, calling out for him, a wave of fire pushing him back and making him fall to his back. Only able to watch what was happening.<br/>
He heard Jacob and Queenie, his gaze quickly shifting over to them. Eyes wide as he watched Queenie let go of Jacob's hand, and swiftly turn to Grindelwald. Stepping down to the circle of fire, stepping into it, screaming without noise. Before she was through, taking Grindelwald's hand. She didn't look back even once before she apparated, leaving Jacob behind, who could only stare in shock and betrayal.</p><p>Newt knew why she went. Why Credence went. And still, he couldn't move from where he was on the steps, barely able to sit up. He knew his brother was somewhere here, nearby, probably going to try and get to him.</p><p>“Mister Scamander.”, Grindelwald turned towards Newt, a small, knowing smile adorning his face for a brief moment, as Newt's breath got caught in his throat.<br/>
“You know why Credence left, do you not?”, he spoke. A rhetorical question. Of course Newt knew. Credence wanted desperately to know who he was, what he was.<br/>
“And your friend's dear sister. In love with a no-maj.”, he hummed, and Newt bit his lip. He knew. Queenie believed joining Grindelwald would bring what she wished for: being able to marry Jacob.</p><p>And Newt, he knew the reasonings behind Grindelwald's words wasn't entirely bad. Look what the world had done to Credence. Forcing children to be terrified of their own magic, suppressing it, until the Obscurus grew inside of Credence. A terrible, unstoppable force, wrecking chaos.<br/>
And he knew that the laws were unfair. That Jacob needed to be obliviated, even though there was no harm in him knowing about magic. That Queenie and Jacob weren't allowed to know another, yet alone marry each other. That marrying a no-maj was against the law.</p><p>And Grindelwald knew Newt saw his reasoning as not as bad as made out to be. Newt was simply against violence, against the murder of innocent humans -no-majs and wizards alike. Just like how he was against the hurting of innocent creatures.</p><p>“Don't you think it is unfair?”, Grindelwald spoke, stepping just a bit closer to the fire, towards Newt, who only sat, and listened. Heart pounding in his chest, fear gripping him.<br/>
“How your poor beasts are hunted. How many have gone extinct because of it? Because of humans killing them. Just because they don't understand.”.<br/>
Newt was breathing heavily. <em>Far too many</em>, he thinks to himself. Far too many creatures had gone extinct. Because no one <em>understands</em>, no one <em>cares</em> to understand. That all these creatures -every single one he carried with him in his case- was harmless. Innocent.<br/>
“They deserve to roam free, in the wild. Living their life without the fear of being hunted for <em>nothing</em>.”, Grindelwald continued. And Newt, he knew he was right. What Grindelwald was saying was true. His beasts, they didn't deserve any less.</p><p>“Newt!”, he heard the voice of his brother calling for him, trying to get to him, but the blue fire made it impossible. “Don't listen to him! He's manipulating you!”. Theseus was desperate. Knowing his brother's heart laid with his creatures. That his brother hated picking sides -and even though he had said he had, clearly intending to stay with the good ones, with <em>him</em>- Theseus couldn't help but worry that his brother would choose otherwise.</p><p>“Don't you think,”, Grindelwald's voice was raised, above Theseus, and Newt looked back to him. Having briefly glanced to Theseus, afraid of his brother getting hurt. “That those <em>aurors</em> are going to use your creatures?”.<br/>
Newt blinked. No. He... he hadn't thought about that.<br/>
“Don't you remember the war? How they used those poor, afraid dragons, to fight.”, Grindelwald reminded Newt, who swallowed, chewing on his lips. Of course. The dragons only he had been able to “control”. He had gained their trust, nothing else. But... they... the people of the British Ministry of Magic, they made them afraid again. Terribly so. Even though the dragons, Ukrainian Ironbellies, had done so well, doing what the Aurors had wanted.<br/>
That fear made them react in the only way they knew how to get potential threats away: attack. Only Newt hadn't been seen as threat, and thus, they hadn't tried to eat him. Only everyone else.</p><p>“Isn't it unfair how they killed those dragons? Just because <em>they</em> treated them wrong?”, Grindelwald continued, and Newt gave the faintest of nods. It was true. It was unfair. It was more than unfair, it was <em>wrong.</em><br/>
“Newt!”, Tina called for him, fear making her voice shrill. But Newt didn't even look at her. His gaze was fixed on Grindelwald, and his words.<br/>
“All I want, is a world in which your creatures are safe.”, Grindelwald continued, unbothered by Tina, by Theseus, the flames keeping them at bay. “For every creature. To not be hunted. Not be killed unnecessarily. Just because they don't <em>care</em>.”.</p><p>Grindelwald raised his hand, holding it out towards Newt. Newt stood up, watching as Grindelwald stepped through the fire, and towards him. And he couldn't help but step down towards him.<br/>
“<em>NEWT!”</em>, he heard both Theseus and Tina scream for him. But... Grindelwald was right. Even if his methods were wrong..<br/>
“I won't be using your creatures. Or any creatures.”, Grindelwald's voice was soft, as he stood so close to Newt. As Newt looked at the offered hand. The promise of what he wished for was so close. Grindelwald wouldn't hurt his creatures. He wouldn't want to use them in a war.</p><p>It was all he needed, the final push, and he grabbed Grindelwald's hand. He could hear his friends screaming for him, but as Grindelwald pulled him closer, he couldn't help but feel <em>understood</em>. And he knew, none of the others had ever tried that. Had ever seen his creatures not as beasts, but living, feeling beings.<br/>
He let himself be apparated away, uncaring to where it was. He would get his case, his creatures, and they'd be safe. He'd be safe.</p><p> </p>
