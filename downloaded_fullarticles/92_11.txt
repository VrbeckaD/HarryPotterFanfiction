    <p>It was a punch to the gut.</p><p>Understanding. Knowledge.</p><p>Harry felt as small, as vulnerable as he had long before Hogwarts. Before magic. Before Voldemort.</p><p>Before Snape bleeding out in the Shrieking Shack.</p><p>Before Dumbledore…</p><p> </p><p>God. Dumbledore.</p><p>Before Betrayal.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s mind was overcome and he felt all of seven, when Dudley had shoved him to his knees and shoved his face into a rotten sandwich mouldering on the pavement, Harry spluttering as the putrid mess was forced down his throat, choking on the bile threatening to come up.</p><p>Harry now, wandering slowly down the stairs from the Headmaster’s office, past the Gargoyle, could feel the press of his childhood oppression upon him.</p><p>He knew he must be in shock. But how did shock remind him so much of Vernon’s fingers pinching deep into his neck as he was steered towards his cupboard?</p><p>His dark cupboard.</p><p>Dark as death.</p><p>Harry felt numb, creeping past the Great Hall where the bodies of his friends lay.</p><p>He knew he would join them soon.</p><p>“Harry!” Hermione called from deep in the Hall, spotting him as he passed the doors on his way out of the castle. “Harry! Wait! No!” She struggled to push past the grieving Weasleys, past the bodies laid out in rest. By the time she made it to the Entrance Hall, Harry was already gone, his invisibility cloak drawn about his frame.</p><p>Harry knew instinctively, somehow, where to go. With every step towards Voldemort, towards the Forbidden Forest, the fog seemed to lift from his mind.</p><p>Harry knew what death would be like. Like his cupboard. No food, no water. No air. Never again. Darkness forever.</p><p>Dumbledore had called death the Next Great Adventure. Harry snorted.</p><p>Dumbledore was a fool. Harry realized that now. A manipulative, fucking, bastard of a fool.</p><p>Harry would no longer follow him blindly into death.</p><p>Not now that he knew.</p>
