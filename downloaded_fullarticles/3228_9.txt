  <strong>The Cake</strong>
</p><p>Birthdays weren’t the same at The Burrow since Arthur died, but really things hadn’t been the same since long before. Years of war, losing a child, and the never-ending stress of caring for a family as large as the Weasleys had taken their toll on Molly. Her once delightfully plump figure had given way to a frail and thin frame, and her kind eyes now carried reflections of those whom she had lost.</p><p>Hermione Granger’s heart broke for her. She wanted--no, needed--for everything to go perfectly for Molly’s party tonight. Hermione knew that the day would be hard enough, and she wanted to do something to make it extra special for Molly. Hermione had made the Weasley matriarch’s favorite cake: the black forest gateau. Arthur had gone out of his way to find the cake for her each and every year, and this year would be the first time Molly would have the dessert since his tragic passing two years previously.</p><p>Hermione looked up at the clock. Gods, was it already six-fifteen? They needed to leave in twenty minutes if they were going to make it to the surprise party on time. Her husband still wasn't home, and Hermione had yet to get dressed for the occasion.</p><p>Hermione poured over the last bit of the chocolate ganache and heard the Floo, followed by Draco’s entry into the kitchen.</p><p>Draco came up behind her and nuzzled into her neck. “Hey, love,” she said distractedly as she topped the gateau with the remaining cherries. “Wanna lick the spoon? I’m almost ready to go.”</p><p>Draco wrinkled his nose. “You know I don’t like chocolate.”</p><p>“Ah, right. More for me, then.” She swiped her finger into the ganache and brought it to her mouth, sucking the chocolate off with a satisfied hum. The act came across more seductively than Hermione intended, and Draco just raised a brow silently, albeit never looking away from his bride’s lips. The way her tongue was swirling around her finger reminded him all too well of her tongue swirling around something else, and Draco found himself getting a bit warm. He reached and pulled her finger out of her mouth, and deliberately took it into his own. He savored the taste of the ganache, but savored Hermione’s response even more. Her face had suddenly flushed and her eyes took on a decidedly glassy quality.</p><p>“On second thought, I guess it’s not so bad,” he said with a smirk. He gave her a cheeky wink, and sauntered out of the room to get ready for the evening.</p>
