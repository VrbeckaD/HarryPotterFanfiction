    <p>Harry walks past Moaning Murtyl's bathroom and he hears crying. He stops and listens.<br/>
Draco: I can't do this any more Murtyl.<br/>
It was Draco! Harry continues listening to find out what his boyfriend couldn't do any more.<br/>
Murtyl: Do what?<br/>
Draco: Everything! The only thing stopping me is my boyfriend but he's probably going to leave me when he finds out.<br/>
Murtyl: Finds out what?<br/>
Draco: I'm a death eater Murtyl!<br/>
Harry decides it's probably a good point to make an entrance. He walks in to see Draco bent over a sink crying.<br/>
Harry: Dray? Babe are you okay?<br/>
Draco: Yeah. I'm fine.<br/>
Harry walks over to the blonde and hugs him. He gives Draco a <em>"I know you're lying"</em> look.<br/>
Draco: Okay. I'm not fine. Better?<br/>
Harry: Tell me why. Then I might be able to help.<br/>
Draco: There is no way that you can get me out of this one.<br/>
Harry: I'm Harry Potter; I can do anything. So tell me why were you crying into a sink in a girls bathroom?<br/>
Draco starts crying again. Harry hugs him tighter.<br/>
Harry: You were forced to become a death eater.<br/>
Draco nods.<br/>
Harry: Oh baby that's awful.<br/>
Draco: It's...it's not just that.<br/>
Harry: What do you mean?<br/>
Draco: I was given a mission.<br/>
Harry: What do you have to do?<br/>
Draco: I have to kill Dumbledore.<br/>
Harry: We will work out what to do. Maybe Dumbledore can help.<br/>
Draco: What?! Murder himself. That's likely.<br/>
Harry: He already knows probably.<br/>
Draco: How?<br/>
Harry: The Order has spies everywhere.<br/>
Draco: The Order?<br/>
Harry: The Order of the Phoenix. It was set up by Dumbledore. I joined in the summer.<br/>
Draco: Are Weasley and Granger in it?<br/>
Harry: No. Mrs Weasley wouldn't let us join but I joined when they were away.<br/>
Draco: I want to join.<br/>
Harry: You need permission from two of age magical blood relatives then you'll need to go under some intense questioning under veritserum.<br/>
Draco: Okay. That first bit might be a problem though.<br/>
Harry: No it won't.<br/>
Draco: Who could I ask?<br/>
Harry: Sirius and Tonks.<br/>
Draco: Yeah I could. Who did you ask?<br/>
Harry: Sirius and Remus. They are the closest thing to blood I have.<br/>
Draco: Yeah.<br/>
Harry: Come on lets go speak to Dumbledore.</p>
