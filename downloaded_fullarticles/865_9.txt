    <p>It’s almost comforting now, the thorns that snaked in his lungs, took root in his blood, intertwined with his veins so deeply that they are no longer determinable from leaf and petal and vine. It is comforting, the clockwork of dull throbs, the reliability of bloody roses, acacia, petunia from his lips, the reminder that he could feel. That he could <em> love. </em> </p><p>It is less satisfying, the reminder that he is dying, the reminder that he is <em> in </em> love irrevocably. Unrequitedly <em> . </em></p><p>In the beginning, though, it had been terrifying. Not yet the comfort of routine (not yet an escape route). Well — not in the very beginning. No, in the first pages of his ‘once upon a time’, it was just a stab of pain here, a stubborn cough that refused to go away. Nothing that couldn’t be ascribed to a common cold.</p><p>And he was <em> eleven. </em> No matter how dark people believed his family was, no matter how correct the rumors may be, by eleven he had not yet learned of the flower-killing-curse. Not yet heard of <em> Hanahaki, </em>his destiny, his doom. Years or decades slower than avada kedavra but just as green. It is not inoperable, but he refuses to cull the garden within him. This is something that deserves protecting. In his later years he reflects that it should be better to die of lovesickness (heh) than in service of the Eaters (which, he may well end up doing anyway).</p>
<hr/><p>It starts because he is a stupid starstruck kid and a boy refuses to shake his hand. He has had several years to meditate on this, and this is the snapshot moment that he has decided has doomed him. He can remember, then, the sharp (thorn) stab of betrayal and humiliation and embarrassment that he felt that night, that he had never felt before that night. In retrospect it was so, so stupid, and he did far worse things to the boy in return, but at the time it had <em> hurt. </em> A <em> lot.  </em></p><p>This is the other reason he’d pinned it to then. It had hurt. A lot. Maybe a little bit like roots taking hold in his chest.</p><p>He was familiar enough with the feeling <em> now </em> to <em> tell. </em></p>
<hr/><p>The first time he had coughed up a whole flower it.</p><p>Was indescribable, really. He had been coughing up petals for months and that. That was almost manageable, but this.</p><p>It was a sunflower, for one thing. He sat in the Slytherin dorm bathrooms, clutching the toilet and sobbing, wishing, <em> hoping </em> no one else would come in, hoping no one else would care enough (either truly care or care for <em> blackmail) </em>to check on a small sobbing first year in the stalls. This one time, his hopes are repaid kindly by Merlin and the universe. </p><p>He is chokingchokingchoking, tears streaming down his face, petals tickling the back of his throat. When he coughed his hands came away dotted with red and water below him tinted pink, little yellow petals littered the toilet, the ground. </p><p><em> Eventually, </em> he thought, <em> eventually I will have to throw up and it will be over. </em></p><p>The next traitorous thought was simply <em> for now, </em>and that almost sent him back into his crying hysterics. But. That desperation, that gasp and subsequent gag finally sent the pretty thing onto his tongue, rolling into his waiting fingers. </p><p>The thing filled up both his tiny child’s hands, and he cried for a very long time.</p>

Understand who he Is, who what he Will Be, that before long he will be fertilizer in the earth.</p><p>Also he is told it means <em> playboy </em> in another language, and where the implications of the name in English are those of soft sadness, the hilarity of <em> that </em>irony leaves him in stitches every time.</p><p>Player. Sure. He’ll take that.</p>
