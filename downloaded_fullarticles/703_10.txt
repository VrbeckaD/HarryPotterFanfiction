“You sure?” Vic nodded, taking his hand and leading him to her bedroom.</p><p>She closed the door behind, and straddled Teddy. “I love you Teddy.” She whispered into his ear, placing kisses from his ear all the way down the side of his face and to his neck. Her lips reached his.</p><p>Teddy’s hands traveled into Victoire’s silky blonde hair. They slowly made her way down her body and up her tshirt. “Not yet Teddy.” She said, kissing him again. </p><p>Victoire’s hands snaked up Teddy’s T-shirt. “I changed my mind”.

I know EXACTLY what you were doing and you better expect punishment.” Bill snapped. “Teddy, go home. You’ll expect a howler later.” Bill told Teddy. Teddy disapperated. “Victoire Apolline Weasley...
