    <p>Jacob notices a change in Newt the beginning of spring; it’s not an immediate change, in fact he doesn’t really notice anything besides Newt becoming easily flushed and spending a lot more time in his suitcase but he doesn’t question it. Newt is Newt after all. So it comes as a surprise when Jacob comes back from his bakery, slightly earlier than usual due to the slow flow of customers, only to be grabbed by the tie and pulled through the door, being slammed back against it and locking it in the process.</p><p>Familiar chapped but soft lips pressed against Jacob’s and after a while of hovering he melted into the kiss; his hands resting comfortably against Newt’s hips as the Brit plastered himself against Jacob, enough for Jacob to feel the press of Newt’s erection into his thigh. The two stood leaning against the door just exploring each other’s mouths and revelling in the way the other felt before finally, Newt pulled away just enough so he was panting against Jacob’s mouth.</p><p>“Miss me?”</p><p>The two laughed breathily “Exceptionally so” Newt nosed along Jacob’s jaw cutely; letting out an airy giggle which made something in his chest flutter, an effect Newt seemed to have on him. Maybe it was magic? A sharp nip to Jacobs jaw brought him back to reality “And I would really, really like to blow you right now” they didn’t get very far, in fact the only one who really moved was Newt who dropped to his knees far quicker than he’d ever moved before.</p><p>Not that Jacob had anything to complain about, not when Newt was blinking up at him with his blue doe eyed stare and his mouth wrapped around the head of Jacob’s cock, and then Newt’s taking him down to the base and all coherent thoughts go out of the window.</p><p>He completely dismisses the confusion later on in favour of guiding a tired Newt to their bedroom.</p><p>The next time Newt surprises him with sex it’s not even two days later; they’re staying with the Goldstein sisters for the night because Tina wanted to discuss more about Newts beasts and her sister had been eager to insist they stayed the night, so the two found themselves back in the room where Newt had first showed Jacob his magical suitcase. Back then, the two had barely known each other, but now though…</p><p>“Newt, b-be quiet, the girls ‘ll hear you” either Newt didn’t hear him, or was actively ignoring Jacob’s request because he released another moan into the back of his hand; his head lolled back as he bounced his hips with fever. In response, Jacob bit back a moan of his own and scrambled for purchase on Newt’s hips; despite all of the times Jacob had been inside Newt, he could never get used to the feeling of Newt clenching tightly around him; as if he was sucking Jacob in eagerly as far as he could take him. “Newt, I sai-”<br/>
“Let them hear” was the panted response above him and Jacob met Newt’s lustful gaze, his blue eyes darkened and his mouth agape just enough for saliva to trail from the corner of his open mouth “I want them to know what you mean to me, what you do to m-me” Jacob knew that wasn’t true, because if Newt were in the right state of mind, he would not be able to so much as hold either of the girl’s gazes should they hear the two in such an intimate act due to sheer embarrassment, but the unexpected thrill of being caught had Jacob’s hips stuttering in their pace and without any warning he was cumming, hard.</p><p>Newt grinding down onto Jacob’s cock must have set him off, because he was quick to follow suit with a strangled cry of his own, ever being the more vocal of the two, especially at climax, striping Jacobs’s chest and stomach white with his release.</p><p>It took a while for the both of them to come down from their high of orgasm and Newt continued to roll his hips against Jacob’s softening penis. “Um…sorry pal I didn’t get chance to pull out…” if Jacob’s hands were free he would have rubbed the back of his neck, but Newt didn’t seem fazed at all, in fact he seemed rather pleased despite what a mess it would be to clean them both off; he merely hummed in response and settled down onto Jacob, careful not to let him slip out “Um, Newt?”</p><p>“We’ll clean up later shall we? I’m too tired to move”</p><p>Well, it didn't take much convincing on Jacob's part.</p><p>Later turned out to be late the next morning and the two shuffled tiredly into the dining room where Tina sat slumped with a cup of coffee in her one hand and a half eaten bagel in the other; Queenie was stood at the stove using her magic to cook what appeared to be omelettes. Both of them sat at the table, Jacob noting with a guilty satisfaction that Newt took great care as he sat down on his chair.</p><p>There was an idle chatter at the table until Tina got up to get ready leaving her sister, Newt and Jacob to eat breakfast. Queenie shuffled in her seat and Jacob met her eye, which the blonde must have seen as a go ahead to release what she was holding in because none of them were prepared for what she was about to say “You two are very loud when you have sex”</p><p>Jacob froze; unsure how to respond while Newt lit up like a firework, straightening up and clearing his throat “Oh, uh, well, I-I do apologise”</p><p>“No need honey, you two sound so cute like that” She released an airy laugh and Jacob wanted the ground to swallow him up right then and there. Perhaps he could ask Newt to obliviate him later on? “Oh, and darling” She reached over the table and cupped Newt’s hands in her own “What you want is completely normal, maybe you should speak abou-” whatever Queenie was going to say was cut off as Newt stood up.</p><p>“Well it has been a lovely morning Queenie, but I am afraid we must be off, come on Jacob” not waiting for a response, the Brit turned on his heels and returned to their room.</p><p>Jacob didn’t get any answers from Queenie and the conversation was quickly forgotten.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, Jacob noticed the significant increase of his and Newt’s sex life, not that it was lacking in the first place, but this, accompanied with Newts strange clinginess and spending more time with his beasts – if that were even possible – it made Jacob question what on earth was going on? It didn’t help that all Newt had to do was smile and Jacob went weak at the knees. Late at night, early in the morning, over multiple places within the house, at his bakery; even in the menagerie!</p><p>Yet Jacob had no idea what could have brought this change on, until they were back in the menagerie.</p><p>Newt had rescued a pregnant creature from one of the wizarding black markets and had nurtured her back to health, so Jacob found it as no surprise when he came down to the menagerie and found the creature curled around Newt contently; watching Newt cradle the newborn creature fondly made Jacob’s heart leap in his chest.</p><p>“Would you like to hold him?”</p><p>“Ah, I dunno I’m not exactly-” and then the creature was being eased into his arms; Newt hovered to the side of him to ensure the baby was secure in Jacob’s arms. Despite the suddenness of everything, Jacob found himself cooing at the strange creature which chirped back in response “Wow, just like his mama huh?” the creature preened at the praise as if understanding Jacob’s words, but Newt was smiling softly at Jacob, in a way which melted the American down and built him back up again in one glance.</p><p>Finally, after nearly a month, Jacob caved and went to the one person he knew would have the answers he needed.</p><p>“Tea, sugar?”</p><p>“Thank you Queenie” He accepted the cup from the blonde as she settled into the chair across from him; her delicate fingers curling around her own cup as she smiled at him “I actually came here to talk to you…”</p><p>Jacob trailed off and Queenie cut in “You’re here to talk about why Newt’s gone a bit coo-coo?”</p><p>“And do you know?”</p><p>She nodded with a smile “Well of course I do honey, there’s not much you can hide from me, even when I don’t want to know too much” Queenie paused for a moment, then continued “I shouldn’t be telling you this, but honey you’re getting so worked up I just can’t keep it to myself anymore”.</p><p>Queenie reached across the table, placing her cup down and grabbing Jacob’s hands in hers; at one point in his life, being grasped so tightly by a lady such as Queenie would have flustered him greatly, but now it gave him a sense of comfort for his panicking heart. “What’s wrong with Newt, Queenie?”</p><p>“Honey, Newt wants a baby”</p><p>“Yeah...” Jacob blinked once, twice, and then three times before what Queenie said truly sunk in and he spluttered in shock “E-Excuse me?!”</p><p>The blonde witch giggled at Jacob’s response, her fingers tightening ever so slightly in reflex “There’s been a slight baby boom recently, especially for his beasts, so it’s making Newt realise he wants a family of his own; with you”</p><p>Jacob was at a loss for words, Newt had shared almost everything about himself to Jacob, though very slowly and reluctantly; not wanting there to be any secrets between the two, but never had the talk of family came up and he didn’t know what to think of it.</p><p>Starting a family with Newt? A beast obsessed Brit who called himself mummy and got caught up in lots of mischief? It seemed insane.</p><p>But then he pictured Newt holding the newborn creature earlier that day, except it was a human baby, their baby. With Newt’s cute nose and light eyes and his curls. And then he pictured teaching the child how to bake; Newt teaching them how to care for the beasts in the menagerie, Christmas, birthdays, would they have magic or would they be a No-Maj like him?</p><p>Jacob found the thought wasn’t so bad after all.</p><p>“And…And could we? Have a baby I mean”</p><p>There’s was a brief period of silence, and then “Oh my! This is so exciting! Of course it is possible” He’d never seen Queenie move so quickly; she was up and fluttering around the apartment in search of something, leaving Jacob to his thoughts.</p><p>A family, huh?</p>
