<p>No matter where Draco put his dresser, it looked out of place in Harry’s bedroom. It was a monstrosity of antique carved wood. If Draco hadn’t graciously agreed to tolerate the mixed styles of furniture instead of buying all new like he wanted, Harry would have burned it.</p>
<p>“The door won’t open fully,” he pointed out.</p>
<p>Draco groaned and flicked his wand.</p>
<p>“How about here?”</p>
<p>Harry stopped noticing the dresser as he took in Draco’s sleeves rolled up to his elbows and a pair of Harry’s fuzzy slippers on his feet.</p>
<p>“Looks just right,” he said.</p></div>
