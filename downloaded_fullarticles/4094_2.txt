    <p>Warm... soft... Mmm, nice...</p><p>If only not for that noise...</p><p>"...what we needed; as though they didn't have enough, those hooligans!"</p><p>Is this... McGonagall?</p><p>"Professor, there really was <i>no one</i> there. I do not know what happened, but I'm certain he hasn't got beaten up."</p><p><i>Scorpius.</i> I would recognize that voice everywhere. He's here.</p><p><i>Here</i>... So where?</p><p>"Something new?"</p><p>Third voice. It also sounds familiar...</p><p>"Nothing, so far. He's still asleep."</p><p>McGonagall again.</p><p>"Asleep? So he'll wake up soon?"</p><p>Oh yeah, it's probably Theo... What is he doing here?...</p><p>What am <i>I</i> doing here?</p><p>"Hmm... Most likely."</p><p>I feel like clogging my ears; everything is so loud...</p><p>"Oh! Professor..."</p><p>Damn; I shouldn't have raised my hand.</p><p>"What is itâ€“ Oh, well, about time!"</p><p>"Mmmh... Not so... Not so loud..." I try to use my voice, but something is not working as it should. My throat feels scratchy; I start coughing and tears fill my eyes. I hear a murmur for a moment, then someone helps me to a sitting position, and in the next moment something cold touches my lips. I open my eyes with some effort.</p><p>A glass of water.</p><p>White bedding and a bed.</p><p>And more beds.</p><p>The Hospital Wing.</p><p>I look around briefly: the Headmistress is standing a few meters away from me, a bit further there's Theo, his hands in the pockets of his robes as usual, and next to me... Right, Scorpius. He's helping me not to collapse back onto the pillows and is holding a glass of water so that I can drink.</p><p>"I'm fine," I croak, raising my right hand to grab my glass with trembling fingers; his hand is warm and supports mine.</p><p>A few silent seconds pass when a pleasantly cool liquid laving my throat; I have a feeling that everyone is holding their breath, watching me and waiting. I don't like this atmosphere, it's too... thick and stuffy; I feel like I'm under fire.</p><p>"Thanks." I give the now half-empty glass back to Scorpius, and I fall into a warm embrace of the soft bedding, letting my heavy eyelids obscure my sight.</p><p>"How are you feeling?" Scorpius asks carefully, putting the glass down on the nightstand next to my bed with a quiet tap.</p><p>"Sleepy," I whisper, as if the answer was reserved only for him. "But otherwise, rather well. What has happened to me?" I throw the question in the space, wondering who will answer.</p><p>"That's the problem here, Mr Potter: no one knows what has happened. "I hear McGonagall approaching the edge of the bed and almost feeling her inquiring gaze on me, I feel as though I'm taking part in the alleged conspiracy thanks to which I am now in the Hospital Wing, barely maintaining sobriety. "All we know is that you fainted in the corridor of the seventh floor; however, we were unable to determine the cause. There are no traces of magic, no physical injuries, and the overall state of your health is so satisfactory that I can confidently say: we have no idea what could have caused your loss of consciousness."</p><p>I sigh deeply, glad that the open windows allow the inflow of fresh air; it was so stuffy back then...</p><p>"Al, and you... you don't remember what happened?" Theo's surprised voice comes to me as though from a distance and I focus hard not to drift off, because sleep calls me, and the bed accompanies him, embracing my body with its warm arms.</p><p>"Not really... I don't know, I only remember that I was coming back from a class, and then... then I woke up here. And that's it."</p><p>After this information, a strange silence falls; I can almost hear their breaths; but I don't want to open my eyes and see what exactly is happening.</p><p>"Can I fall asleep?" I feel that I will not be able to stay awake for much longer anyway, even though it has been a mere few minutes since my last rest.</p><p>Still no one speaks up; and then I hear the sound of footsteps and the as always sure voice of the Headmistress:</p><p>"Naturally. Apparently, sleep is the only medicine your body needs at this moment. Please, do rest, Mr Potter."</p><p>"Get better soon, Al."</p><p>I know that McGonagall and Theo are leaving the Hospital Wing, but when I decide to open my eyes again, Scorpius is still sitting on a chair next to my bed. His grey eyes scrutiny me and the familiar warmth spreads over my body as I look into them. He's smiling. I smile too.</p><p>"You don't go?" I ask, just barely balancing on the edge of sleep.</p><p>He shakes his head.</p><p>"I'll be keeping an eye on you." He grins and his eyes shine. "Anyway, it's weekend; I have nowhere else to be."</p><p>I want to ask him if he would stay with me without it, but before I can do it I already fall into the arms of a sleepy abyss.</p>

  <p>***</p>
</center>When I wake up the next morning, I feel normal and a few hours later I'm released from the hospital.<p>Throughout all this time, Scorpius doesn't leave me for a moment (nearly) and not that I'm complaining, but when he insists on accompanying me non-stop for the rest of the day, I start to get impatient.</p><p>"Scor, seriously, I do not need a patron," I sigh when he assists me again on the way to the loo.</p><p>"Normally, you don't," he states matter-of-factly. "But how can you know if you won't faint again? What if you fall and hit yourself on the head? Or pass out on the stairs? You may do serious harm to yourself, Al, better to be safe than sorry."</p><p>"It's nonsense." I shake my head, slightly amused, though I am moved by Scorpius' concern about me. "I'm telling you for... I don't know which time, doesn't matter: I'm fine. Okay? Fine. I'm in no pain, I do not have any dizziness, nausea or anything else."</p><p>Scorpius looks at me for a moment, frowning as he always does when thinking about something.</p><p>"Okay, I'll keep it up until the end of this day, and then I'll stop," he declares in a categorical tone, then adds, emphasizing the sentence with a raised finger: "If everything will be all right."</p><p>I sigh dramatically, letting him know that I give up, but after a moment I laugh.</p><p> "There's no other way, huh?"</p><p>He shakes his head, making that cute, stubborn face of his.</p>
