    <p>Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman couldn’t be any happier.  They had just finished fifth grade and they would never have to go back to South Park Elementary ever again, or see Mr. Garrison.  The boys had the whole Summer to do whatever they wanted.  And as the end of Summer drew nearer, so did the beginning of their new adventures at South Park Middle School. </p><p>Stan had only just returned from back to school shopping with his parents when he noticed an owl perched on the front porch of his house. What was strange was that it was around noon when he and his parents arrived home, and owls don’t come out until it’s dark. But what was even stranger was that the owl had a letter in its beak addressed to him in fancy green writing.  The letter also had a red wax seal with some sort of symbol on it. </p><p>Who the hell still writes letters?  Stan thought.  Compared to all the weird things that happen in South Park pretty much all the time, this was nothing to him. </p><p>“Mom, Dad there’s an owl that has a letter for me on the porch.”  Stan said to his parents. </p><p>“Who the hell still writes letters?”  Randy replied.  “Whatever, go open it.”  Sharon silently agreed. They were both used to how bizarre South Park can be. </p><p>Stan began to break the wax seal as he thought about what this owl’s letter had for him. He was probably going to end up going on some crazy quest again.  “Dear Mr. Marsh,” he began to read out loud.  “We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”</p><p>“Witchcraft and what?” Sharon began. </p><p>“Wizardry, apparently.”  Stan replied.  “Please find enclosed a a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on September 1. We await your owl no later than July 31.  Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress.”    </p><p>“Well, I guess I’m not going to South Park Middle School.” </p><p>“Where exactly is this school?” Randy asked. </p><p>“It says I have to be on platform 9 and 3/4 at King’s Cross Station by 11 am... in England. “ Stan said as he skimmed the letter for more information. </p><p>“England?  But that’s so far away.  How do they expect you to get to England?”  Asked Sharon.   </p><p>“There is going to be a portkey available in Denver on August 24 to 31. It basically teleports you to wherever you want to go, I think.”</p><p>Weird things happen in South Park all the time, but getting accepted into a magical school on the other side of the world was new.  But I was supposed to go to South Park Middle School. Stan thought. Learning magic has got to be better than normal school.  But I’d have no friends there. What if Kyle and Kenny didn’t get accepted?  Cartman I could do without, but Kyle is my best friend and Kenny’s really great too.  But then again, what if they did get accepted?  I’ll have to call them later. </p><p>“So, can I go to Hogwarts?”</p><p>Randy and Sharon looked at each other in confusion. They weren’t sure if they could let Stan go so far away from home for months on end.  But there he would have the chance to learn magic, maybe that could explain why he seemed prone to go on such strange journeys with his little friends. </p><p>“We’ll think about it.”  Randy said. </p><p>The owl was still perched on the front porch, and it wasn’t going to leave until it had a letter to take back to Hogwarts. </p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p>“You got a letter from an owl too?”  Stan said over the phone to Kyle. </p><p>“Yeah I did, and Cartman called me earlier saying that he and Kenny got one too.”  </p><p>Oh great. Thought Stan.  Fatass is going to be there too. </p><p>“So are you going to Hogwarts?”  Kyle asked. </p><p>“My Mom and Dad said they’d think about it.  You?”</p><p>“Same with mine.  Can you imagine what learning magic is going to be like?”  Kyle replied.  </p><p>“I have no idea.  I just know it’s going to be way better than going to South Park Middle School.”  </p><p>“Either way, we’ll never have to see Mr. Garrison again. </p><p>“Thank God for that, anyway Kyle I got to go.  See you.”</p><p>“Bye, and let me know if your parents let you go to Hogwarts.”  </p><p>“Ok, and same with you.”  </p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p>That night as Stan tried to fall asleep he thought about what going to Hogwarts would be like.  Did any other kids in South Park get accepted?  Where exactly is Hogwarts?  The letter mentioned going to a called Diagon Alley to get school supplies.  Where exactly is Diagon Alley?  Do have to get there using magic?  How come Shelly didn’t get in?  What is Hogwarts like anyway?  What did the different animals on the wax seal of his letter mean?  Stan had so many questions he needed answered.  This didn’t look like another typical adventure for Stan. He’s never used actual magic before. After thinking of possible answers to these questions Stan eventually fell asleep.</p>
