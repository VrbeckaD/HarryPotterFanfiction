    <p>This morning would probably seem like any other to Dumbledore, Harry tried to reason with himself. He didn’t really convince himself though. No matter how much he tried to tell himself that there was no evidence leading to the quidditch team, he just couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something that would link them to it. </p><p>Truth be told, Harry didn’t even want to be involved. Sure, he didn’t like the Slytherins, but he didn’t wish any harm to them. His teammates seemed to disagree with that.</p><p>Harry felt awful for what role he had played in wrecking their campus, but what he felt most awful for is not wanting to come clean.</p><p>He had always liked to think of himself as a nice person, but last night had changed that. Because if he was capable of ruining what was a home to some people, then what else was he capable of?  </p><p>Harry decided to get out of bed before his dormmate would come up with some evil plan to wake him up. He once tried to wake Harry up by putting a chicken next to his ear, an actual chicken. When Harry asked an explanation for this, he just said that he hadn’t been able to find a rooster. </p><p>The logic behind anything Ron does, has always been a mystery to Harry. Whether it’s a muggle thing or a Ron thing, he’ll never know. Well, actually, it must be a Ron thing since there are plenty of muggles who wouldn’t wake somebody up with a chicken.</p><p>When Harry had finally made his way to his closet, he grabbed the nearest clothes and headed to the cafeteria. Harry was glad that the school decided to scrap uniforms a few years back, because at least he doesn’t have to tie a tie every morning. Which is great because, spoiler alert, he almost never actually tied his tie. He usually just gave up somewhere around November. </p><p>By the time he arrived in the cafeteria, word had already spread about the Slytherin buildings being wrecked. Of course, this news wasn’t actually a surprise for him. </p><p> </p><p>He went to sit with the rest of the quidditch team, because they probably wouldn’t want to talk about the latest news either. They were probably the only ones at that. </p><p>The team was just like they always were. Nothing really changed with the team; they seemed to always just talk about the same things. The latest pranks of the twins or some poor first-years, that they liked to make fun of and if they weren’t talking about those things, they were probably poking fun at somebody’s romantic interests. </p><p>What was different today though, was Fred and George’s behavior. Usually they lightened the mood and made everything more bearable, but today they were awfully quiet. It seemed as if, even for them, last night’s prank went too far. </p><p>How most of the team just carried on as if nothing happened, Harry couldn’t understand. And out of fear of snapping at them, Harry excused himself to go to the bathroom. </p><p>“Hey Harry, I was wondering where you were! You usually don’t get up very early, but you were gone when I woke up and I- “</p><p>Harry cut Ron off before he could finish that sentence.</p><p>“I was hungry, so I decided to head to the cafeteria early, as I was already up anyways.” Harry didn’t meet his dormmate’s gaze, but his excuse must’ve worked, since he could hear Ron’s footsteps heading towards the door.</p><p>Harry went into one of the stalls. Not because he actually needed to go to the toilet, but because this seemed like the only place where he wouldn’t have to talk to anybody and could just play some games on his phone to relax. </p><p> </p><p>Harry must’ve missed some important morning announcements, because at practice later that day, he seemed to be the only one that didn’t know that the Slytherin students would transfer to Gryffindor. This was certainly unexpected. They probably wouldn’t have trashed the Slytherin buildings if they knew this was what would come of it.</p><p>As there wasn’t that much information going around about the transfer yet, the team decided to not dwell on it, but rather just make use of the limited time they had to practice.</p><p>There had never really been a lot of time for practice, because there is a lot of homework for the wizardry students. That’s because they don’t get excused from the normal school pressure the British government requires. </p><p>When the muggle world first learned about wizards, they agreed a school where wizards and muggles could study together would be beneficial for them both. However, over the years, there has always been a question: do wizards need to get the same education as muggles? </p><p>At first, wizards didn’t need to follow all of the normal subjects, but only one. As years went on, however, that turned into more and more and now wizards need to follow all muggle classes in the morning and then they have wizardry classes until the late afternoon. </p><p>That doesn’t leave very much time for practice. And so, the quidditch team meets every weekday evening at 19:00 and then practice for only an hour. Harry wishes they could practice more. Not because his teammates are particularly interesting or nice, but because he genuinely likes playing. </p><p>Today’s practice had gotten a bit out of hand though. </p><p>They had decided to do a practice match without snitch, but a lot of frustration from the night before seemed to surface throughout the match.</p><p>Harry himself didn’t participate in the match, he was playing a seekers game by himself, but the other ‘main’ players did. One team had the twins in it and a sixth-year girl, that he still doesn’t know the name of. (There was a time when Harry wanted to ask about her name, but he kept forgetting and over time it just became more and more awkward. So now he just avoids ever having to say her name. He does know that most people call her ‘shorty’, but as he has had very few interactions with her, it would be quite awkward to call her by such a nickname.)</p><p>The other team, that nameless girl wasn’t in, consisted of the team captain: Evelyn Snape, Ginny Weasley and August Deschamps. </p><p>Harry must admit that Evelyn is quite an extraordinary player, but he’d rather have had the twins as team captains, even though Evelyn is his half-sister. Rumours have it that the twins were the original choice, but that only one of them could have the title of captain and therefore they both turned it down.</p><p>He gets it, but it still sucks. Mainly because Evelyn is an absolute tyrant, but all the benched players listen to her in hopes of ever getting to play and nobody exactly knows why August always does whatever she says, but most people think that he has a crush on her. </p><p>Which is of course quite foolish, if true, because everybody knows Evelyn already has a relationship and despite her being mean to most people, she really seems to like Ginny. She is actually nice to her. She isn’t even nice to her dad.</p><p>After making the teams, the match quickly started. Though ‘quick’ wouldn’t really be the first word to come to mind for this match. Harry doubted he’d ever experienced a match where the tension kept building up for so long.</p><p>But long isn’t forever, so after a long while the Weasley boys lounged at Evelyn despite it being completely useless for the game. They probably couldn’t wait for an excuse any longer. </p><p>Not long after the twins first lounged, every player was involved. Even Harry, who had tried to avoid it, joined the fight. At first with the intention of breaking it up, but then he remember Evelyn telling him he was only put on as Seeker because his father was a Seeker and brought Gryffindor to victory when he went to school here. </p><p> </p><p>The next day the whole team was in detention. Except Evelyn.</p><p>They were caught fighting by the principal, McGonagall. She wasn’t very amused. Harry had tried to explain that he was there to break the fight up, but she wouldn’t hear it. She only listened to the team captain. After hearing her out, McGonagall decided that they’d all have detention for a week. Even in the weekends. </p><p>Of course, Evelyn managed to get out of it. Rumours say that the only reason Evelyn is still in this school, is because McGonagall wants to maintain a good relationship with her father. Severus Snape. He is the principal of the Slytherin School and of course Gryffindor and Slytherin have to work together because they’re all part of ‘the Cloak’. He didn’t think Snape would actually mind it if Evelyn actually got detention though. From all the family dinners fogged with tension Harry had gathered that she didn’t have the best relationship with her father. </p><p>But at least she has a relationship with their mother, who left Harry when he was only two months old and immediately decided to go baby-making with Snape. </p><p>Harry didn’t mind too much, though, because life at his dad’s place is actually pretty awesome.</p><p>When his mother got pregnant, Harry’s parents decided that they’d need to have a bigger house to better accommodate a child. In their enthusiasm, however, they went a bit overboard. So, when his mother left his dad, he decided the place was too big to live in alone, so he invited his friends to live there and it’s now called the Marauder Mansion. </p><p>In Harry’s opinion it was way better than his mother’s house where she lived with Snape and Evelyn. </p><p> </p><p>Because of the fight, practice was cancelled. That would give Harry the perfect opportunity to finally catch up to all of his schoolwork, so, logically, he didn’t do that. Instead he headed to the music room.</p><p>With his busy schedule he hadn’t been able to do any music for a while, because to play the guitar or piano he’d need the music room. Though he did have two guitars of his own in his room. However, even though Ron is sometimes a jerk, Harry doesn’t actually despise him. He is an alright bloke. So, Harry usually doesn’t practice in his room because he gets there quite late and Ron is usually either doing his homework or sleeping and Harry isn’t enough of a jerk to disrupt that. </p><p>When Harry finally got to the music room, he could hear the music through the door. Somebody was playing Bach. On a guitar. Though Harry didn’t necessarily dislike classical music, he did think that that guitar could be put to better uses. So, he opened the door in order to either scare whoever was playing away or join them. Harry wasn’t sure yet what he was going to do.</p><p>When Harry looked into the room, however, he was caught by surprise. What he saw there was his rival. The seeker of the Slytherin School: Draco Black.  </p><p>Harry really shouldn’t be surprised. Though the guy was a git, he was also the only one he knew that was able to play Bach like that. Harry had been quite envious when he was younger, actually. Whenever the Blacks came over to the Mansion, pads always asked Draco to play something. He had always been awfully good at it, too. </p><p>Harry supposed he wasn’t really envious of it anymore, because when he once told Padfoot that he wanted to be able to play like that too, Padfoot taught him to play the guitar too. And whenever he was frustrated that he couldn’t play like Draco, Padfoot told him that Draco couldn’t play like him either, because they had very different styles. Draco leant more towards classical music, whereas Harry leant more towards rock and punk. That, of course, was a side effect of being taught by Padfoot. </p><p>When Draco finally took notice of Harry, who must’ve been standing in that doorway for quite a while, because the piece Draco was playing had already come to an end, Draco just grunted and then shoved his guitar in his case, before nudging past Harry to get out of the room. </p><p> </p><p>Harry had been playing for hours, when he finally decided to head to his room. He was lucky to have the invisibility cloak with him, because it was well past curfew. </p><p>When he stepped into his room, he almost tripped over his guitar case. He didn’t remember leaving it there. When he glanced over to where he thought he left it, next to his bed, he discovered that it was indeed there. Then this guitar case wasn’t his. When he glanced towards his guitar case again, he also discovered a bed next to it that wasn’t there before. He was quite sure there were only two beds in this room the last time he was here. </p><p>Even Harry, with his fondness for anything that came as a surprise, couldn’t really see a positive side to the menace that was suddenly planted in his room. </p><p>Well, maybe one positive side, or rather sight, with Draco lying like that.</p>
