    <p>Harry Potter, the boy who had lived, was looking at Ron opposite him eagerly, his eyes wide beneath the lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. Battered wand in hand, trying to keep it steady as the carriage rocked, causing the tip of unicorn’s hair that was stick out of the end to flutter every so slightly, Ron pointed it at his rat, Scabbers. To Harry, having grown up outside of this wizarding world, even the promise of turning a rodent yellow seemed like the most extraordinary thing in the world.</p><p>Ron cleared his throat.</p><p>The carriage door slid open with a loud thwump as it bounced back on its rail. The shy looking boy who’d asked them about his missing toad earlier was stood there, peering out behind a girl whose hand was still on the door. Already in her Hogwarts robes, she looked a little bit like a young version of the actress Emma Watson, with messier hair and slightly larger teeth. Allowing only the briefest pause for Harry and Ron to turn to look at their entrance, she launched into a question.</p><p>“Has anyone seen Neville’s toad? He’s lost one. There’s a boy whose locked himself in a carriage further down and-- oh--” Her gaze rested on Ron’s wand, only just taking it in. Her question, stifled from having had to repeat it all the way down the train, wobbled. Her attention was caught. Her mouth turned into a toothy grin. “You’re doing magic? Let’s have a look, then.”</p><p>“Er,” began Ron, his confidence clearly becoming as battered as his wand thanks to the unexpected audience. He cleared his throat again, making more of a show of it this time, and said quite quickly: "Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, turn this stupid, fat rat yellow."</p><p>A few aching seconds passed, and Ron pursed his lips together.</p><p>“I’m not sure that’s a real spell,” said the girl. “Though I’ve only tried a few simple ones myself, but I’ve managed to get them going. There’s no other magic in my family -- not that I know of anyway -- so it’s all been a bit of a surprise so far. Of course, I’ve already read all the coursebooks cover to cover, so I can’t wait to learn more. Oh, my name is Hermione Granger, I should have said. And this boy here is Neville Longbottom,” she nodded towards the shy toadless boy who was still hovering near the open carriage door. “Who are you two?”</p><p>“Ron Weasley,” Ron grumbled, still reeling from the failure of the spell.</p><p>“Harry Potter,” said Harry, brushing his fringe to the side a little bit to show the scar that infamously marked him as connected to the dark lord Voldemort, who most in the wizarding world it seemed couldn’t bring themselves to refer to by name.</p><p>“Ah, the scar,” said Hermione. “I’ve heard all about you -- well, read all about you -- in some of the more recent history textbooks. I wonder what house you’ll end up in? I can’t wait to hear which I’ll be sorted into. I’m not sure which I’d rather… And I’ve read about them all.” She stood up. “Well, we should get back to looking for Neville’s toad. The last carriage left is the one that other new student has apparently locked himself into. I’m not sure what the school staff on the train are going to do about it, and I hate to think what would have happened to his toad if it got into there…”</p><p>“What would be the problem with a toad being in his carriage?” asked Harry.</p><p>“Well, some of the older students already went to try and sort him out, and they came crawling back injured. It’s only pure luck that Madame Pomphrey, the school’s nurse, is also on the train, along with some other teachers, or they would have had to wait for the rest of the train to get proper medical attention.”</p><p>Harry leant forwards, his curiosity piqued. “A first year… No… a student who isn’t even yet at the school… could do something like that?”</p><p>“Well, if you’re so curious we were about to look for Neville’s frog down there. Why not come along? I think some of the teachers already went down that way.”</p><p>Harry glanced at Ron and they nodded at one another. Whatever bizarre incident was happening on the train, they wanted to peek a look so they could get a headstart on the school’s gossip for the year.</p><p>“Let’s get going then,” said Hermione, taking the lead and walking further back down the train. Ron and Harry walked behind her, leaving their things behind to come back for them later. Neville waited for them to move in front before following them, clearly nervous about the rumours about the boy at the back of the train.</p><p>Walking through the doorway to the next train carriage, Harry immediately felt the atmosphere take a turn. While just one carriage down he’d been enjoying chocolates and sweets with a new friend moments before, here it already felt thick with tension. They had to push through a small group of nervous looking students in casual clothes who had collected at the entrance with Hermione muttering a few “excuse me”s, though none seemed to want to venture too far in.</p><p>The wood and dim lights of the other carriages was nowhere to be seen here. It was all metal, and at the end of the carriage was a cage with thick bars.</p><p>“This carriage is an old luggage carriage,” Hermione whispered, “used to transport student’s belongings, and back in the past, dangerous magical beasts.” Surrounding it, looking in, were a group of three adults in the type of robes Harry knew to signify them as Hogwarts teaching staff. A tall and wise looking lady with a pointed witch’s hat was stood at the front, talking to someone within the cage.</p><p>“That’s Professor Professor Minerva McGonagall, the Head of Gryffindor House,” whispered Hermione again. “She teaches transfiguration, but it’s well known that she's a master of all the magical arts, and has been deputy head of the school for some time.”</p><p>“Who are the others?” asked Harry.</p><p>“The one to her right with the purple turban is Professor Quirrel. He’s a new teacher, I don’t know much about him, but I heard some of the other students talking about him earlier. And the one in the robes…” She paused, looking up, recalling. “That’s Professor Trelawney, the astrology teacher. I don’t know much about her, the subject didn’t really catch my interest I’m afraid.</p><p>Harry nodded, trying to remember what Hermione was saying, and keeping an ear out to overhear what was going on.</p><p>“Listen, boy,” said Professor McGonagall in a thick Scottish accent that was unwavering and fierce. “If what happened with those other students was indeed an accident, then you can be forgiven -- after you’re reprimanded, though, of course. Magical accidents, do happen, you know. But you must leave this luggage cage at once.”</p><p>Moving a little closer to the scene, Harry could now see with the darkness behind the bars. There, reclined on some cushions on the floor, was the first-year-to-be that Hermione had mentioned. But, at 195cm tall, and with an incredibly muscular frame squeezed into a dark school uniform Harry didn’t recognise, he looked much older than he was.</p><p>“Listen, you old bitch,” came the curt reply from the student’s mouth. “I ain’t going anywhere, so buzz off.”</p><p>“Well, I never,” said McGonagall, shocked. “In all my years I’ve never…”</p><p>“Seems I’ve been possessed by an evil spirit, and I have no idea what it’ll make me do next,” the boy continued. “During that fight with those kids earlier, it took all I had just to stop it. So do me a favour, and just leave me in this cage until you can all get far away.”</p><p>“Mister Jotaro Kujo, if you don’t come out of there this instant you’ll be in serious trouble, not just with Hogwarts, but with the Ministry Of Magic itself. You’re here to attend a magic school, so if you’re having problems, we can help.”</p><p>A boy from the back of the carriage stepped forward, his face bruised and cut. “Pro… Professor,” he began. “I don’t think he’s lying about the evil spirit thing when he attacked me and the others. Maybe we should just leave him and get the hell away.”</p><p>McGonagall threw him a filthy look and the boy stopped what he was saying.</p><p>Jotaro tutted, and picked up his wand, a straightforward thing with a single black star near the hilt. The teachers behind McGonagall took a step back, though she remained resolute. However, Jotaro turned the wand on himself, lifted up a green can of drink, and pierced it near the bottom using the tip of the wand. The way he reclined, drinking the liquid spilling forth from the bottom of the can, was like nobody was around watching him at all.</p><p>“What are you doing with a butterbeer in there?” asked the man next to McGonagall, his voice timid and stuttering. Professor Quirrel, Harry remembered.</p><p>“Cor, I’d have loved a butterbear with those chocolate frogs,” murmured Ron. “But because of the alcoholic content, they’re not allowed to serve them here. I wonder where he got it from.”</p><p>Neville let out a little grunt, but Harry and the others didn’t really know what he meant by it.</p><p>“Like I said, I’ve got an evil spirit. And sometimes it likes to bring me things from nearby,” Jotaro said. He sighed, and stood up, his height making his head almost touch the roof of the train. It looked like his hat scraped against it. It was a peaked cap with a golden trim and gold emblems on it -- a circle, and a sign of an open hand. At the back, it seemed to blend into his messy tangle of dark hair. He shook his head and took his cap off, a dark gold chain attached to the collar of his jacket clattered as he did so. “This might not be enough to make you guys keep me locked up in here,” he grumbled, “but I’ll show you how evil the spirit is anyway. Maybe then you’ll see why letting me out of here is a bad idea.”</p><p>He held up his hand towards the teachers, pointing it at them from behind the bars. Then, like a flash, a purple hand seemed to materialise out of the air, swoosh forwards, and grasp at something by Professor Quirrel’s side, then it flew back towards him.</p><p>Then, there! In the boy’s hand was a wand. Not the one from before. It must have been Quirrel’s.</p><p>“My wand,” gasped Quirrel.</p><p>“In case that wasn’t enough,” said Kujo. “Then watch this.” He raised the wand to the side of his head and began to mutter “Avada…”</p><p>Hermioned stepped forward. “No!” she called. Neville closed his eyes and began to sob.</p><p>“Kedavra!”</p><p>A green light flashed from the tip of the wand, throwing stark shadows of everyone onto the walls. But it appeared to be frozen in mid-air, just between the tip of the wand and the side of Jotaro’s head. There it was, thought Harry, he could see it now the flickering had settled, a purple hand wrapped in a black, gold-studded fingerless glove appeared to be grasping the spell in the air. The green light flickered, then disappeared as the thumb and forefinger holding it steady crushed it out of existence.</p><p>“It’s like there’s someone just out of my vision that’s bound itself to me,” he said.</p><p>The wand clattered to the floor and nobody said anything. The crowd began to thin as students retreated back into the safety of the other carriages. Even most of the other teachers were stepping back, unsure of what to do. Only Professor McGonnagal was holding her ground.</p><p>“So you really think you can help me after that?” asked Jotaro. “An old hag like yourself? Nobody can.”</p><p>“An impressive show young man,” said McGonnagal, “but I’ll make you leave this cage yet.”</p><p>Jotaro frowned. McGonnagal stepped forward, a wand seeming to jump into her hand. “Incarcerous,” she snapped, and Jotaro flew back against the wall behind him, thick ropes and twisting metal bars emerged from the surroundings and wrapped themselves around his limbs. He cursed, struggling against the confinement.</p><p>“If you want to be trapped, then very well,” said McGonnagal.</p><p>Jotaro grunted loudly. With a flick of her wand, the coils only continued to tighten.</p><p>“She’s really going to hurt him,” said Harry. Hermione nodded, and Ron looked worried. “Should we say something?”</p><p>“I’m not sure what we should do,” said Hermione. “I’m not sure if there's anything we <em> can </em>do.”</p><p>Hermione began to take a step forward as if to say something, but before her mouth could open Jotaro let out a loud cry, and his shackles burst from his body, and a ghostly essence seemed to slip forth from him, suspended in the air. It was a purple creature roughly Jotaro’s own height and build. It looked not dissimilar to him, with bulging muscles covered with loose golden armour strands coming to a head in glittering golden pauldron shoulder armour. Around its neck was a loose red scarf, and its dark hair flowed wildly behind its mean glare -- framed by a golden crown with a gem in the centre, and a thick black goatee beard. It was wrapped in a glowing purple aura.</p><p>“There it is,” said McGonnagal. “It’s finally showed itself. A patronus. The fact it’s so clearly visible means it must be an incredible strong one as well.”</p><p>“Fine,” said Jotaro. “Then let’s do this.” The creature lunged forward, passing through the bars as if they weren’t there, and grabbed hold of McGonagall, squeezing her tightly.</p><p>She wheezed slightly. “I was going easy on you before, but if you push me further I might have to put you in the hospital wing,” she said between gasps. Jotaro narrowed his eyes. She flicked her wand again. “Incendio Duo Incarcerous.” Green flames twisted from the tip of the wand, and wrapped themselves Jotaro tightly.</p><p>He yelled out in pain. “I can’t breathe,” he muttered. The purple creature began to fade, withdrawing closer to Jotaro.</p><p>“Your patronus might be strong, boy, but it’s still linked to your own spirit,” said McGonnagal. “You’re the weak link here. Now stop this.”</p><p>His breathing getting weaker, Jotaro groaned in pain. It seemed like the creature would fade away entirely, but then it snapped back, letting loose a hard punch to the ceiling above Jotaro. “Ora,” it called out. Then again: “Ora!”</p><p>Professor McGonnagal frowned. Then the roof came away, punched out by the creature. The twisted metal flew away into the darkening night sky as the train continued to speed on towards its destination, and windy rain began to whip inside the carriage. The flames holding Jotaro began to sizzle out.</p><p>“That’s destruction of school property,” muttered the third and final teacher in the room, the bespectacled one. She wrapped her loose robes tighter around her as the cold air reached inside the carriage.</p><p>“You had your chance,” said Jotaro as he righted himself.</p><p>Professor McGonnagal muttered another spell and the tip of her wand began to glow a fearsome blue.</p><p>“Don’t say I didn’t warn you,” he continued. He stepped forward and the purple creature grabbed the bars of the cage, twisting them with its hands until they snapped free, glinted points at the end. It raised them high, letting out a battle cry, and continued to move towards the teachers. Jotaro walked behind it towards them. </p><p>Professor Quirrel and the other teacher began to back off looking worries, the second one fumbling with a deck of tarot cards.</p><p>Harry and the other first years with him had no idea what to do. This crazed new student was approaching Professor McGonnagal wielding sharp bars of metal that looked like they could kill.</p><p>Professor McGonnagal smirked, and turned her back on Jotaro, strolling towards Harry and the others at a slow pace, her wand hand falling to her side.</p><p>“What the Hell?” asked Jotaro. “Why are you turning your back on me now? We’re not done here.” The creature disappeared, and the spiked bars clattered to the floor.</p><p>“You’ve left your cage,” McGonnagal smirked without turning around. “I’ve done exactly as I said I would.” She stopped in front of Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Neville. “Hermione Granger,” she said in greeting, “I have heard about you. We expect big things from you at Hogwarts.” She looked at Harry. “And Mr. Potter, of course. I’m glad to see you’ve all been making friends. Ms. Granger, can I ask you to make sure you keep Mr. Kujo out of trouble for the remainder of the trip? I expect we’ll be arriving soon enough.” She glanced back to the other two teachers. “Let’s head back to the teacher’s carriage now we’ve done with this nuisance for now. We can discuss it later.”</p><p>Before they followed, Professor Trelawney turned nervously back to Jotaro, and showed him a card from her tarot. “The Star,” she muttered. “Your Patronus… something abnormal about it. The gilding on the card… platinum.”</p><p>“So you’re saying my ‘evil spirit’ is my star platinum, huh?” grumbled Jotaro. “I like it.”</p><p>The teachers milled away, leaving Jotaro alone stood outside of the cage, rain still lashing in. The only others that remained were Harry and the others. Jotaro turned around and picked up his hat. He brushed it off and shook it, catching something in his hand, then walked over to them. Close up, he stood at nearly twice their size.</p><p>“So, you guys are first year students here as well, right?” he asked.</p><p>They all nodded back nervously. “This is Harry, Ron, and Neville,” said Hermione. “And I’m Hermione Granger. It’s nice… nice to meet you.”</p><p>“Think this might be something to do with you,” he said, holding out his large hands. Within them was a shaken looking toad. “Seems it hid inside my hat in the middle of the fight.”</p><p>Neville’s eyes lit up, and he lunged forward for the toad. “Thank you,” he called.</p><p>The very edge of Jotaro’s lips curled into a minor smile. “Didn’t know a damn thing about this magic business before I heard about Hogwarts,” said Jotaro. “My meddling grandfather told me I had to enroll, and leave my education in Japan behind. Just because he’s friends with the headmaster here. Good grief, what a pain.” He shook his head.</p><p>“Your grandfather is friends with Dumbledore?” asked Ron, his surprise untying his tongue for him.</p><p>“Sounds like it,” grumbled Jotaro. “This ‘patronus’ thing… Star Platinum. Seems the old man thought coming here would help me somehow, though he was saying something about ‘stands’. But I’m sure there’s more to it that he’s not telling me. At least by coming here I get to get away from him and my mum a bit, and all those girls at my old school.”</p><p>“All those girls?” asked Hermione, an eyebrow raised.</p><p>The group continued to talk, swapping stories about how they came to learn about magic, Neville and Ron continuously acting surprised about how all of the things they’d come to take for granted about the wizarding world being brand new to Harry, Hermione, and Jotaro. Then the train began to ease to a halt, a large looming castle coming into view from the window. They had arrived at Hogwarts.</p><p>“Hopefully now we all know each other we can keep being friends,” said Hermione.</p><p>“Yeah,” said Harry, his nervous about starting a new school now thoroughly stamped out by dealing with all this strangeness before even setting foot on the school grounds.</p><p>Jotaro mumbled in agreement, and began to heave open the large doors of the luggage carriage. “Hogwarts, huh,” he mumbled. “Something tells me we’re just getting started on one bizarre adventure.”</p><p>The doors of the luggage carriage were wide enough for all of them to disembark at once. Their feet all landed on the ground at the same time, and they stepped forward in unison, onward towards their beginning at Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry together.</p><p>
