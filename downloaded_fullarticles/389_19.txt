  <em><b>BDSM: </b>a variety of often erotic practices or roleplaying involving bondage, discipline, dominance and submission, sadomasochism, and other related interpersonal dynamics. </em>
</p><hr/><p><em> Well </em> , Sirius thought, confronted only with the view of the inside of an admittedly poor excuse for a blindfold, <em> this wasn’t what I was expecting </em>. He could feel the skin of his wrists beneath the awful plastic handcuffs was sweaty and clammy, on the verge of turning red-raw from the contact.</p><p>Fantasising had been completely different: imagining how hot it would be, how <em> cathartic </em> it would be to be tied up and subjected entirely to the whims of his boyfriend, to just <em> do </em> what he was told to do and do a <em> good job </em> at it. But <em> this? </em> This was a little different. It was still hot, of course — because, well, Sirius was naked and so was Remus, and he was imminently going to get some part of him touched — but it wasn’t… <em> brimming with electricity and frisson </em> like he had expected.</p><p>When he’d brought it up with Remus about a month ago, the other man had been intrigued—tentatively so, because Remus rarely showed an unbridled enthusiasm for anything that wasn’t dry sarcasm or a really fantastic tea—and they’d done some equally tentative internet searching. After a lot of <em> umming and ahhing, </em>they agreed to start with something simple and ordered a blindfold and handcuffs. The package had even sat on the dresser for a few weeks, neither of them quite wanting to take the next step of opening it and pulling out those things and actually putting them to use. Tonight, they’d finally decided to take the plunge.</p><p>Of course, they’d swiftly realised once Sirius’ hands were cuffed to the headboard and the blindfold was around his eyes, that they’d failed to plan any further than this exact moment.</p><p>Sirius cleared his throat. “Remus?”</p><p>Remus sounded a little surprised. “Err, yes, Sirius? Ah… what now?”</p><p>“You tell me,” Sirius said, licking his lips. </p><p>“I...Tell you what, though? What, er...what do you want me to do with you? Or-or to you?” </p><p>Sirius frowned behind the blindfold. This hadn’t been part of the fantasy. He didn’t want to have to <em> tell </em> Remus what he wanted him to do; wasn’t that the point? “Whatever <em> you </em> want. C’mon, you’ve got me all tied up and at your mercy, yeah?” He arched his hips up a bit in a way that he hoped Remus would find enticing.</p><p>“Well, err,” Remus said, sounding sort of strangled in that way he did when Sirius caught him at the grocery store buying that motorcycle magazine that ‘mysteriously’ appeared on their coffee table every month. “It’s<em> your </em> fantasy, you know? What happens next, in the fantasy, once they’ve—I’ve got you tied up?”</p><p>“I—” Sirius opened and closed his mouth several times. What <em> did </em> happen next? He had never gotten that far, now that he thought about it. He figured this was it, and what happened next wasn’t for him to decide. But <em> this </em>? This was just frustrating; and he was beginning to feel more aggravated and fidgety than anything else. “You know what? This...this isn’t sexy. I can’t—ugh—could you maybe—?” He squirmed a bit.</p><p>“Oh! Shit, yeah, hold on…” A moment later Sirius felt the mattress shift, then Remus’ fingers on the edges of the blindfold, tugging it up into his hair.“This is not entirely what I imagined,” Remus said as Sirius blinked up at him, adjusting to the low light of their bedroom.</p><p>Sirius grimaced. “Yeah; me neither, really.”</p><p>“So… what <em> do </em> you want me to do to you?” Remus shifted uncomfortably, sitting back on his heels, and suddenly Sirius was acutely aware of the fact they were both stark naked, and this was a <em> distinctly </em> unsexy scenario.</p><p>“Well,” Sirius tried to keep the blatant frustration from seeping into his voice. “At the moment I want you to uncuff me.” </p><p>Remus quickly leaned over and undid the handcuffs before slumping next to Sirius in the bed. “Right, right. This… this didn’t go great, did it?”</p><p>Sirius huffed and sat up straight. “No, it didn’t.”</p><hr/><p>Remus rubbed a hand over his eyes, peering with what <em> had </em> to be renewed interest at his computer screen. He couldn’t stop thinking about Saturday night with Sirius; how awkwardly stilted it had been after he’d unfastened the plastic handcuffs from around his boyfriend’s wrists and they’d sat there for a moment contemplating how it had been nothing like what they wanted. Remus had thought it would be hot to have someone — to have <em> Sirius </em> — at his mercy like that, but as soon as Sirius <em> was </em> at his mercy, his confidence had taken a vacation to Barbados, and he’d just thought dumbly about <em> what if I do something Sirius hates? </em></p><p>It <em> had </em> been hot to see Sirius sprawled out in front of him: all long, pale limbs and dark hair,  He’d almost been overwhelmed with the fact he could do <em> anything </em> at that moment; like sensory overload of just <em> too much </em> . But he’d tempered that heat all away with his <em> what ifs </em>. Now, outside of their bedroom, at his desk in a lively office, Remus saw Sirius naked and restrained whenever he closed his eyes. He could almost hear every sharp gasp and strangled moan the other man would make as he kissed and licked his way down, and he could see the red and purple bruises his teeth would leave; so vibrant in contrast to Sirius’ pale, flawless skin.</p><p><em> Okay. Work. </em> He had to concentrate.</p><p>Remus shook his head to try and dispel the thoughts as he looked back to his computer screen for the fiftieth time today. Thankfully, his fingers got to typing the transcript without him really thinking.</p><p><em> In the author’s opinion, Chancellor Fudge showed remarkable restraint in his speech against </em>—</p><p>Oh. <em> Restraint </em>.</p><p>Sirius on his knees, hands secured—<em> restrained </em>—behind his back and blindfold still in place while his mouth stretched to accommodate Remus’ co—</p><p>With a muttered swear, Remus closed his word document and opened a private browser. Where the hell did he even start? Clearly he couldn’t just search <em> kinky fantasy was nothing like we expected, please help. </em></p><p><em> Fuck it </em>, he’d just start with the basics.</p><p>He bit his lip, peering around anxiously as if he expected someone to be watching over his shoulder before finally typing four letters into the search bar: </p><p>
  <em> BDSM. </em>
</p><p>The internet, it turned out, was a wild place.</p><p>Remus’ first mistake was to start with sites he recognised, sites like GQ, or Buzzfeed or, the dreaded Cosmopolitan. He thought maybe those sites would give him a beginners perspective, but it was all so wild and sort of frightening and—<em> why on Earth did the paragraph about golden showers (which Remus was definitely not prepared to read about just yet) have to involve Donald Trump? </em></p><p>Where could he go next? What did they need to know to turn those fantasies into reality? <em> Successful </em> reality, and not the awkwardness of Saturday night?</p><p>He sat back in his chair, rubbing at his eyes for a moment. This shouldn’t be so stressful. He was probably overthinking the whole thing. Remus tapped his fingers lightly over his keyboard, wondering if there was a more specific way that he could do some basic research; none of this crazy kink stuff that neither he nor Sirius were ready for just yet. There had to be some sort of starting point, right? </p><p>Then, a website that wasn’t downright terrifying, or had a click-to-enter warning on, seemed to catch his attention.</p><p><em>A</em> <em>Beginner’s Guide to BDSM - Keep it Safe, Sane and Consensual</em></p><p>That definitely seemed more their speed, and the words ‘Safe’ and ‘Consensual’ seemed to automatically put him at ease. That had been his main concern, after all. He didn’t want to force Sirius to do something he might not want. </p><p>Anyone who knew Sirius would think it was a silly thing to worry about. Sirius enjoyed taking risks and being reckless; Remus just wasn’t sure he liked the idea of being the one responsible for it. He always knew that, whatever he and Sirius got up to, it would likely be him that chickened out first. But with this… what if Sirius <em> couldn’t </em> chicken out, and Remus hit some kind of hard point with him? He didn’t want to ruin it. He wasn’t sure if Sirius had safe or sane covered — or whether <em> he </em> did for that matter—but they could at least do consensual.</p><p>So what did that mean? Would they have to stop and ask <em>is it okay if i do this thing</em> <em>to you</em> every time? That didn’t sound sexy at all. A running commentary of<em> yes</em> and<em> no </em>sounded especially bizarre. So what, then?</p><p><em> Dominance and submission are all about a power exchange; willingly giving over power </em> <em> — </em> <em> over yourself, your body, your mind </em> — <em> to your lover. Even when a submissive partner is all tied up, they have had a say in the scene. They have </em> negotiated <em> with their partner and had it all agreed upon beforehand. In many ways, the submissive can be thought of as in power because it’s the Dominant’s responsibility to respect the agreed upon limits. </em></p><p><em> Ha! </em> Remus thought, smiling a little to himself. Sirius would like that: all tied up and getting told what to do, but knowing he was still the powerful one in the situation. Letting Sirius think he was the top dog — <em> pun entirely intended </em> , Remus snickered into his tea cup — was far easier than dealing with a sullen, brooding Sirius, who insisted he had everything under control and was entirely too <em> cool </em> for all of it. </p><p>Remus sipped his tea and went back to the article, after a long look over the office to make sure his boss wasn’t skulking around.</p><p><em> Before you try anything a little spicy in the bedroom, though, you’ll need to talk over whatever might be tickling your fancy, to make sure it’s wetting your lover’s whistle too. It’s also a good idea to pick a safeword, in case you need to pull the emergency brakes on your sordid session </em> — <em> pick something you wouldn’t use in a normally steamy situation! </em> <em><br/></em> <em> We recommend sitting down and going through a checklist of your Wants, your Wouldn’t Minds and your Will Not’s. It might sound a little kooky, but discussing your encounter before it happens </em> — <em> in all of it’s wonderful sexy detail </em> — <em> can be its own form of foreplay! </em></p><p>
  <em> But where do you start? Most first timers aren’t going to dive right into the scene with whips and chains. Here’s a list of common beginner kinks to get you started on your sexy exploration: </em>
</p><p>Remus’ eyes scanned down the list, feeling immediately more at ease with the lack of things like Watersports and Fleshhooks that he had seen on other lists. At least he had heard of most of these; in fact he was pretty sure they had already done one or two of them. Things like hair pulling and dirty talk weren’t a completely foreign concept. Maybe he could use the office printer and get two copies of this list to take home? He and Sirius could sit over them tonight and discuss what they liked and wanted. </p><p>Maybe it would descend into something else. After all, the article <em> did </em> say that negotiating could be its own form of foreplay.</p><p>Just as another image of Sirius naked and on his knees flashed across Remus’ mind, there was a light knock on the wall of his cubicle.</p><p>“Ah! Remus, lad,” Mr. Slughorn called before he could even click away from the browser. “Just popped along to see how you were getting along with the Chancellor Fudge article, hm? Albus wanted it by 5pm, so he said.”</p><p>Remus felt himself jump nearly out of his seat, his face burning red and feeling very thankful for his desk hiding a very prominent… <em> problem </em> … within his trousers. “Er — I — um… Y — yes. Yeah, it’s going great, Mr. Slughorn. I’m just editing a few, er…” He cleared his throat, which felt too tight. “Working out the kinks, I suppose.” <em> Subtle, Lupin. You idiot. </em> “It’ll be on Albus’ desk by 5, no worries.” </p><p>“Right-o,” Slughorn said, stood in the doorway and blocking at least 70% of it with his… portly frame. “Glad to hear it. Edit out those kinks my boy,” he said, chuckling. “I hear Mr. Lockhart brought in some donuts for his birthday; they’re in the break room if you’re that way inclined.”</p><p>Remus stopped himself from rolling his eyes. Lockhart was such a brown-noser, always getting the exciting jobs thanks to the amount of absolute ass kissing he gave all of the superiors in the office. “Maybe later.” Remus said, biting the inside of his cheek. “Gotta finish this by 5, you know.” </p><p>“Of course, of course.” Slughorn nodded. “Great young man, Lockhart. So much talent, too. He’s really dominating the field lately.” </p><p>Remus’ face felt like it was on fire and all he could think about was the desire to sink under his desk and just stay there forever. <em> Dominating the field </em> … <em> Christ </em>. </p><p>“Y—yeah, terrific. Er… If you don’t mind, Sir, I should really get back to working on this.” He nodded his head towards the clock on the wall. “4:00 already, you know.” </p><p>“Right you are, right you are. I’ll get back to cracking the whip then, hm?” Slughorn smiled, gave another little bounce, then turned out of the office.</p><p>Remus waited until the door clicked shut before he let out a huge breath he hadn’t even realized he’d been holding and slumped down in his seat. Of course his boss had to walk in while he was researching how to have kinky sex with his boyfriend, but did he have to make comments like that? <em> Cracking the whip </em> and <em> Dominating the field… Fuck </em> ! Had it been that obvious that that was what he had been doing all day at his computer? Did he have <em> Likes to Tie Up His Boyfriend </em>tattooed on his forehead, or something? Or maybe he had left the damn website up when he had gone to use the loo and now everyone in the office knew— </p><p>No, he hadn’t left his desk since he’d started researching all of this. </p><p>Glancing up at the clock again—4:05—he took a few slow breaths and scrubbed his hands over his face before he finally clicked out of the private server with the BDSM guide and reopened his article. </p><p>“Right then, back to work…” </p><p><em> Chancellor Fudge showed remarkable restraint in his speech against the lowering of school budgets, claiming to have a plan that will bring opposing government officials to their knees </em>—</p><p>This was going to be the<em> longest hour </em>of Remus’ adult life. </p><hr/><p>Sirius was sitting at the kitchen table with the engine oil finally cleaned from his hands when Remus walked through the front door of the flat. He swallowed his mouthful of tea then glanced towards the hallway.</p><p>“Hi love,” he said. “Good day?”</p><p>Remus shrugged, bending down to give Sirius a quick kiss hello. “Alright, I guess. Lockhart strutting through the office like he owns the place, as always. Fucking peacock.” </p><p>Sirius rolled his eyes. “What a dick. Any time you like I’ll make up some kind of fake story about him to put him in his place.” With his foot, Sirius pushed out the other chair at the table. “Did you at least get on Sluggy’s good side?”</p><p>Remus groaned and rolled his eyes as he sat down “I dunno. The man is so bloody awkward; it’s hard to tell.” </p><p>Sirius could have sworn he saw Remus flinch slightly, his cheeks going pink.</p><p>“I managed to finish my article on time, though. So that’s good.” </p><p>Sirius leaned forward onto one elbow. “You look like I’ve tried to feel you up in the pub and that terrifying woman with the boil on her nose has caught us. What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Nothing, it’s just…” Remus licked his lips, running a hand through his hair. “Well, I was doing some research when Slughorn came in to check on my article. Some, er… not <em> work related </em> research, about what we were trying to do on Saturday.” Remus gave Sirius a very pointed look.</p><p>“Oh.” Sirius grinned and snickered. “You didn’t have a stiffy, did you? Reading about all that lurid stuff in your tiny box of an office?”</p><p>Remus glared at him for a moment, but didn’t answer the question. “Anyway, Slughorn came in and he started using phrases like <em> Cracking The Whip </em> and <em> Dominating The Field </em>, and I thought I was going to fucking die right there. It was awful! It was like he knew what I was doing! It was just—” He shuddered, shaking his head as if that would help erase the memory from his mind. “On a better note, I did manage to find some, er, interesting information.” </p><p>Sirius raised an eyebrow, letting Remus’ glare slide off of him. “Oh, yeah?”</p><p>A slow smile crept across Remus’ face. “Yeah. I printed out a few things… Would you like to see ‘em?” </p><p>“You’ve got <em> handouts? </em> ” Sirius cackled, slapping his hand on the table. “That is the most Remus thing I’ve <em> ever </em> heard! Is there going to be a test at the end?”</p><p>“Only if you’re suddenly into student/teacher roleplay.” Remus chuckled lightly; a slightly more mischievous look in his eyes as he reached into his back pocket, pulled out some neatly folded papers and passed them across the table to Sirius. “Turns out the solution to our problem is pretty simple. We just need to talk about it a bit more beforehand—” </p><p>Sirius was only half listening to what Remus was saying; focusing more on the unfolded paper in his hands and feeling the corners of his mouth drop into a frown as he read.</p><p>
  <em> Negotiate. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Talk over whatever might be tickling your fancy. </em>
</p><p>Sirius scowled. He didn’t want to have to talk it over. </p><p>“What is this?” Sirius said, plucking up a pen from the fruit bowl in the middle of the table. “<em> Bondage. Spanking. Nipple clamps. Gags. </em> What, are we meant to just… fill them out with yes and no?”</p><p>“Well, we should discuss it a bit as well, but that’s the basic idea.” Remus shrugged and leaned forward across the table to look at the print outs. “This way we know what’s alright to try and what’s not. We need to talk about hard limits and-” </p><p>“I don’t have any <em> hard limits </em>,” Sirius insisted, shaking his head. All he wanted was for his mind to go blissfully silent as Remus did whatever he wanted to him.  </p><p>Remus glanced down at the print outs and back up to Sirius. “I don’t think that’s true… It says we’ll have limits somewhere, and surely it’s better to know them beforehand.”</p><p>Sirius huffed a humourless laugh. “Right, right; the article knows best. How are we meant to just put a yes or no on these things? It’s so… <em> unsexy </em>. You can just do whatever you want, Remus. That’s the point of it. You get me, naked and blindfolded, and you just do whatever you want.”</p><p>“Sirius, I can’t just do that. I need to know that whatever I want to do is okay, first. This is as much for me as it is for you. What if I did something and you got hurt or, I dunno, it reminded you of some awful experience? I’d hate myself if you were ever hurt by something I did.”</p><p>“Well, I wouldn’t be.” Sirius pushed the papers away, standing up. “I’m not in the mood for this. I can’t just go down the list ticking boxes; it’s stupid and pointless. You want to do these kinds of things? I mean, what the fuck even is <em> Shibari </em>?”</p><p>“I don’t know. See? This is why we need to talk things through; so we can find out what it is and see if we are both interested! How would we know if we didn’t talk about it first?” Remus’ eyes were following him as he began to storm out of the kitchen, and he heard Remus’ chair scrape against the floor seconds later. “Sirius, would you please just talk to me for a minute?”</p><p>“Not about your fucking handouts, Remus,” Sirius practically spat, gesturing to the table. “It’s a <em> stupid </em> idea! We’ve been shagging for years; we know what the other likes!”</p><p>“Would you at least tell me why you’re so wildly averse to discussing this with me? You said it yourself; we’ve been shagging for years! Apparently you trust me enough to let me ‘tie you up and do whatever I want’, so why don’t you trust me enough to talk to me about what you want out of this?” </p><p>Sirius scoffed, shifting his weight. “What I want out of it is for you to do what you want to me. I don’t see why I need to detail it all out? It’s unnecessary and bloody boring, Remus.”</p><p>Remus crossed his arms across his chest, a condescending smirk on his face. “Oh? So would you say it’s a <em> hard limit </em>, then?” </p><p>“Oh you fucking git.” Sirius shoved at his shoulder, then went to step past him into the hallway. “Yeah it’s a hard fucking limit, and that’s the only one.”</p><p>“It is, is it? Alright, fine.” </p><p>The next thing Sirius knew, he was shoved up against the wall and Remus’ lips were pressed insistently against his own. <em> That was more like it. </em> That’s what Sirius wanted out of this; for Remus to just take charge and take what he wanted. </p><p>He made a noise of satisfaction into the kiss, his hands fisting into Remus’ shirt as Remus crowded him against the wall.</p><p>Remus moaned into his mouth, deepening the kiss and rolling their hips together. He trailed one hand down Sirius’ chest and stomach until he was palming Sirius through his jeans. “Is this what you want, love? You want me to take charge?” He gave Sirius’ cock a light squeeze. “Get on your knees, then.” </p><p>Sirius moaned—though truthfully it might’ve been closer to a whine—as he canted his hips towards Remus; every single blood cell in his body flooding southward. “Fuck,” he breathed, looking at Remus almost in awe. “Fuck yeah, babe. Whatever you want.” Anticipation was thrumming through him as he slid down the wall onto his knees, pressed close enough to the wall that Remus could probably feel Sirius’ breath over his cock; which only made him shiver more.</p><p>“Whatever I want?” Remus repeated, raising an eyebrow as he looked down at Sirius with a mix of arousal and amusement. One of his hands tangled into Sirius’ hair and pulled sharply, tilting his head up so that he was forced to meet his gaze. </p><p>“<em> Fuck </em> . Yeah, yeah. Whatever the fuck you want, babe. Please.” Sirius absently licked his suddenly-dry lips as he leaned forward a little. He couldn’t move too far though, with Remus holding his hair so tight. <em> Fuck </em>, it was so hot.</p><p>Remus’ hand tightened in Sirius’ hair and he slowly dropped down on one knee to lean in and nip Sirius’ ear lobe, his breath hot against him, making him shiver slightly. </p><p>“Sirius…” </p><p>“Yeah?” </p><p>“I really want you to fill out the fucking paper.” </p><p>Sirius blinked, wondering if he had misheard Remus for a moment through the haze of their pleasure. Surely it was going to be something lurid and filthy but it was… <em> paperwork? </em> </p><p>Sirius tried to pull back but Remus held his hair tight. “You’re fucking kidding me?”</p><p>“Watch your mouth,” Remus said in a stern voice that Sirius had never heard come from his boyfriend. Sirius definitely didn’t hate it. His stomach flipped and his cock twitched for attention beneath his jeans, so it <em> definitely </em> wasn’t hate.</p><p>“Jesus, fuck,” Sirius breathed, his brain already supplying images of Remus using <em> that voice; </em> telling him to do something filthy and horrific.</p><p>Remus frowned, clicking his tongue and shaking his head. “What did I just say, Sirius?” </p><p>“To watch my mouth.” The words spilled out of Sirius’ mouth before he could think. Having Remus be so stern, having him hold Sirius by the hair; it just inspired some kind of bizarre <em> honesty </em> in him.</p><p>“So what have you got to say, then?” </p><p>Sirius grimaced. He hated apologizing. “Sorry?”</p><p>Remus’ face softened slightly and he smiled, seemingly satisfied for the moment. “Very good. I know that’s not easy for you. Now then,” Remus released Sirius’ hair and stood up, straightening his clothes as he did so. “I’m going to give you two options: we can either go to the kitchen and talk this through, and then continue what we’ve just started, or we can stop everything, forget this ever happened, and go back to just having regular, vanilla sex. It’s completely up to you.” </p><p>“Remus, that’s…” Sirius swallowed, hard. </p><p>Remus’ eyebrows shot up again. “If you prefer, you can leave the decision up to me. You did say I was in charge, but I figured you’d be more comfortable with being able to consider your options. Because if it’s up to me, you’ll get up, go to the kitchen, and do as you’re told.” </p><p>Sirius shifted his weight from one knee to the other, pausing for a moment before he spoke up. “We can fill in the forms.”</p><p>Remus smiled at him like a cat that had caught a canary. The smile of someone who knew they had just won. “That’s a good boy.” </p><p>“<em> Fuck </em>.”</p>
