    <p>
  <span>When the Order looked back on this day, the only thing they could say is that they were unprepared. Unprepared for the acromantula, the giants, the dementors, the werewolves... Aurors and Order members alike were outnumbered. Students under 17 were escorted out of the collapsing halls that had once been Hogwarts, shuffled through the Room of Requirement’s passageway to the Hogs Head as discreetly as possible. Aberforth Dumbledore then sent them through the floo to their homes or to safe houses the Order had set up. Lives were lost and the aurors began to surrender while Order members fled to regroup.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was utter chaos. Hermione looked around her and watched as the Weasleys ran. Ron reached back for her hand but she urged him to follow his family. Racing through the halls, she ducked down into the secret passage that led straight to the cellar of Honeydukes. The anti-apparition wards were down and Hermione turned on her heel and was gone with a pop.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She landed in her childhood home and raced to her room. Packing essentials to leave the country the muggle way, she didn’t know where she would go, only that she couldn’t stay in England. Her small beaded bag laid open on her bed while she rummaged through drawers, bookshelves and under her bed just to be sure. Every book that could possibly help her hide. Some books bordering on dark magic were haphazardly placed beside the bag to be arranged inside once she was done. Hermione grabbed a book tucked away in the bottom of her bookshelf and glanced at the cover. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Ancient and Obscure: Rituals of Time and Space</span>
  </em>
  <span>. The book intrigued her. She remembered finding it in the Room of Hidden things in one of her many secret excursions to gather supplies and discarded tomes that would assist the boys and herself in their search for horcruxes. In her preparation for the horcruxes hunt, she forgot it at home while packing. In the end, the only book that had helped them find and destroy the horcruxes was </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hogwarts: A History, </span>
  </em>
  <span>so it might not have made a difference at all.  She tossed the ancient book gently to sit next to her bag, intent on skimming it over to help find a way to hide her new location. Turning back to her work, Hermione heard the book drop to the floor, she glanced back and gasped.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>On the floor before her lay </span>
  <em>
    <span>Ancient and Obscure: Rituals of Time and Space</span>
  </em>
  <span> opened to a page labelled </span>
  <em>
    <span>Changing History.</span>
  </em>
  <span> She reached out and read the simple passage before considering the ritual. “This may just work,” she whispered to herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was hard to gather the materials for the ritual she planned to do. Brewing the potion wasn’t as difficult as she first believed, but the entire set up put her at great risk to be discovered by Death Eaters. Harry had been killed in the battle, the Weasleys banded together to mourn the loss of Fred and had left the country. Molly had tried to beg Hermione to come with them when she had helped them pack to go into hiding, but she had refused. This ritual was too important, it could change the course of history. She could save so many people, and maybe, just maybe, their world wouldn’t be as dark as it was now. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Under normal circumstances, Hermione would never cast a spell, drink a potion or perform a ritual without knowing everything about the risks involved and all of the implications. The passage about the ritual she had found was vague. It gave nothing away as to what would really happen, or what the risks were. However, the chance to change everything was too tempting so Hermione polyjuiced herself and kept her head down while visiting the apothecaries in Knockturn Alley, against her better judgement. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It took a month to properly brew the potion. A whole month and very little sleep. She had her home protected as best as she could, and spread a rumor that she had left the country to give herself some extra time to put her plan in motion. Hermione drew the ritual circle in chalk on the hardwood floor of her parent’s living room after moving all the furniture to the side. Drinking the potion, she laid down in the circle surrounded by black candles and whispered the latin words that would change everything. A loud bang sounded outside her door, and she turned around in a panic. The door burst in and men in black cloaks filed into her home. Crushing the crystal at her feet she shouted the last words to the ritual. Feeling the burn throughout her entire body, Hermione curled into herself and screamed until she felt weightless and glanced down only to see herself, surrounded by the unmasked Death Eaters, not quite able to reach her. She watched as her body curled into itself, and her screams filled the room as fire spread around the circle before everything went dark.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She woke in the Forest of Dean. Hermione rose from the frosted ground and looked around her before choosing a direction and walking. She didn’t understand why she would appear here where everything was still and silent. The sound of her feet crunching through the frosted grass didn’t echo around her, and she knew something about this place was off. This couldn’t be the real Forest of Dean; it was too quiet, too still. Nothing she did seemed to affect anything around her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello,” a small voice spoke from behind her. Hermione turned around and came face to face with a girl she hadn’t seen since she was eleven years old. “I’m Hermione Potter.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Potter? But...there aren’t any Potters left. Harry and his dad were the last of them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“In your timeline, maybe. But in mine, Jamie has a sister: me. Hermione Potter.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m...Hermione Granger.” Hermione looked around herself again. “It’s too still here. Where are we?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know. Limbo maybe. Or maybe even what muggles perceive as heaven.” Hermione Potter sat down and crossed her legs, her fingers playing with spears of frozen grass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How old are you?” Hermione Granger asked. The smaller girl didn’t speak like a child. She spoke with the knowledge of someone beyond her years.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m twelve. I turn thirteen in March. Jamie and I are twins.” Hermione Potter cocked her head to the side. “I died. How did you get here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I did a ritual…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What was it for?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“To change history…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The young Hermione smiled. “That must be why we’re here. The ritual could be trying to fill the place I’m leaving behind with you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Take your place? But why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“To change history of course. My brother is dead in your world isn’t he? In your timeline James didn’t have a sister. So your Harry had no magical family left to go to. Things may have been different had Harry been raised in a proper home. Maybe the ritual wants you to start there? Not to mention the fact that we’re both the same person.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re not the same person.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t you see Hermione? I’m Hermione Potter. I look exactly like you. Well...My teeth are larger than yours, but still. You’re Hermione Granger. The only differences are our families , timelines and ages. We’re the same person on two different timelines.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to replace you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You won’t be. You are me. Just from a different timeline, like I said. You can’t replace me. But if you’re really concerned, think about it this way. I am leaving my brother behind, I’m dead. I can’t go back, but the ritual thinks that you can. Jamie won’t be able to handle me being gone. And I would really like someone to be there for him. You could also help raise Harry. You’ll be in the perfect place to change lives, change history. And save those who need it. Everyone is redeemable, okay? Please take care of my brother? Thank you, Hermione.” The image of the younger Hermione faded, as did the Forest of Dean and Hermione Granger lost herself to the darkness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Memories flooded into her head, a small lifetime of memories in a family that she didn't know, and yet seemed familiar to her. A mother, a father and a brother. Hermione sat up in a soft bed, beams of light streaming through the closed drapes were the only light she could see. Her head hurt, and she held her head in both hands. Something wasn’t quite right. She slipped out of the bed, trying to ignore the slight dizziness and pain. Opening the curtains, she scanned the large room. Everything was decorated with shades of gold and purple. The large bed she slipped out of sat against the wall across from the door she assumed would lead out of the room. In the far corner sat a vanity table with an overstuffed ottoman in front of it. Hermione made her way to the mirror and gasped. Dark brown curls cascaded down her back, uncontrolled frizz and knots that she thought she had grown out of. The scars she obtained from war had vanished from her skin, leaving it smooth and flawless aside from a light dusting of freckles across her cheeks and nose. What Hermione noticed the most, however, was that she was several inches shorter and several years younger. She was twelve again. She smiled and her mood soured. The job Madam Pomfrey did on her teeth when she was 15 was no more and her too large front teeth were again a prominent feature on her younger face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Looking around, Hermione tried to put the background of her new life together. Her bedding was soft and of high quality, her room was spacious with an ensuite bathroom. The robes and dresses in her wardrobe were exceptionally tailored acromantula silk and the shoes were dragon hide. Glancing out the window she saw stables and a large garden situated on a large plot of land with a makeshift quidditch pitch. On her bedside table, Hermione noticed a picture frame where a family presented themselves smiling at each other. Hermione picked up the frame and smiled. It would be tricky to navigate this new life of hers, pureblood customs not quite drilled into her yet. However, Euphemia and Fleamont Potter appeared too relaxed to be considered the stereotype of a perfect pureblood parentage. They stood closer together than aristocratic etiquette allowed, with Hermione up in the arms of her father and her mother’s hand resting on James’ shoulder. Hermione remembered this photo. It had been taken during their Christmas holidays during their first year at Hogwarts. Seeing her best friend’s face broke her heart and brought forth the image of him resting in Hagrid’s arms, cold, lifeless and pale. His green eyes were no longer laughing, the weight of the world, for once, not shown on his features.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione sighed and put the photo back onto the nightstand, before sitting at her vanity with her head in her hands. Tears came unbidden to her eyes as she thought about the steps she’d have to take to secure the future. She cried for the losses, and she cried for her new life. Little Hermione Potter was no more, and in her place was a war veteran. Heart scarred, terrified of failure, and tired of carrying the world on her back. She needed to make this world a better place for everyone she loved in the future, and hopefully more people would survive with her knowledge. At twelve years old however, it would be tricky to get anyone to listen to her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She opened the drawer to her vanity. Amongst a small collection of cosmetics sat a diary. Her new memories told her that she only wrote in the diary when she was stressed or excited, but at that moment Hermione decided to use it for something else. Taking a quill from the drawer, she made a list of all of the events she could remember. The first step Hermione could think of was to reform or get rid of Peter Pettigrew. He would never be given the chance to tell Voldemort where to find the Potters.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A knock sounded at her door and a head of dark hair and glasses poked in. “Oh, thank Merlin you’re awake!” James scrambled into her room, throwing his arms around her. “You shouldn’t be out of bed, you were very weak yesterday.” He scolded her lightly. Hermione heard a sniffle in her ear, and brought her hand to ruffle his hair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm better, but I still have a headache.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Mum will have a fix for that if you think you can come downstairs." Hermione stood,  stashed her diary and followed James down the stairs into an informal dining room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She wasn't sure what to expect. Euphemia and Fleanont were purebloods, she knew that from the magical genealogy book and the Black family tree. However, it would appear that they did not care for the riches that purebloods seemed to flaunt. Hermione couldn't help but feel that the Potters were similar to the Weasleys in the sense that they valued family over opulence. The home was large but cozy. She knew they were a bit more financially secure than the Wesleys, as her new wardrobe could attest to, but the family didn't feel the need to have a large manor house with only the four of them. She sifted through Hermione Potter’s memories to remember the layout of her new home. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The house was definitely larger, not quite a manor with separate wings, but plenty of bedrooms. The second story consisted of one master suite and six smaller rooms, each with their own en suite. The ground floor consisted of a formal dining room, a breakfast nook, the kitchen, a receiving room, a guest bathroom, a family room and a small room for the family’s house elf. Walking down the stairs, Hermione took in the hallway. The color scheme was warm, white on red wainscotting lined the walls leading into the dining room where the walls were painted in a dark emerald green. The dining table was polished cherry wood and the chairs were elegant, yet comfortable. Her new mother sat at one end of the table set for four, her father nowhere in sight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, my sweet girl.” Euphemia cooed, standing up and making her way over to envelope Hermione in a hug. Brushing her hair from her still warm face, she dropped a kiss on her forehead. “You seem to have beat the worst of it, sweetheart. How are you feeling?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She has a headache.” James chirped from behind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“James, darling, Hermione is perfectly capable of speaking for herself.” Euphemia chided with a smile. Resting her hand on Hermione’s back, she steered her to a chair and called for the family house elf. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione stiffened, not quite getting over her dislike of house elf slavery.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What can Chip do for you, Mistress?” The small elf asked with a smile. Euphemia looked down at her daughter, noticing her tense body language.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hermione, really. Have you not talked to Chip yet about the elves? Chip, Hermione’s been under the weather, can you get her a light breakfast? Oh, and a potion for her headache would also be appreciated. Thank you.” Chip popped away after a brief bow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s slavery, Mum.” Hermione whispered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Euphemia stroked Hermione’s hair before easing herself into a chair next to Hermione as Chip sat breakfast in front of the small girl.“Chip, Hermione believes that you are a slave. Would you mind telling us your thoughts on this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh no, young miss, Chip is not slave. Chip wants to serve the good Potter family! House elves need good homes to take care of or house elves lose magic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So it’s a mutually beneficial partnership?” Hermione asked curiously. Chip nodded happily. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t say it’s a partnership, dear. Chip is part of the family.” Chip seemed to beam with happiness at being included before popping away to continue  cooking breakfast.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Here, take this first and then you can eat.” Euphemia held out a vial of potion, which Hermione drank down without checking. How would a twelve year old explain how she knew the scent and color of specific potions? ‘Professor Snape would be rolling in his grave if he knew I was taking potions without checking...But there’s no way for me to explain why I would check without suspicion,’ Hermione reasoned silently. ‘We aren’t at war...And this is my mother. In this timeline at least.’ </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mum, when is Sirius going to be here?” James asked, taking his seat across from his sister, grinning when Chip sat his breakfast in front of him. Hermione perked up at his name. She had forgotten he’d be here. Hermione remembered the broken man he had been before he died. Sirius spent so much time on the run, and then more time locked up in Grimmauld place, drowning in the pain of betrayal and the loss of the only family who cared with a bottle of firewhisky. But here? In this timeline, Sirius was having some of the best years of his life. Hermione knew that he was abused at home, so he would likely be spending all of his summers with the Potters before finally running away at sixteen. Her new memories showed her a boy she didn’t expect. A boy who only acknowledged her when he had to, who was only ever rambunctious with her brother and the other Marauder, Remus. A shy boy, contrary to the stories she had been told in her fifth year.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I will be flooing over and speaking to Walburga in an hour. There’s no guarantee that he can stay however, it’s up to his mother.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James seemed to look disturbed by the thought of Sirius being forced to go back to that house. If Euphemia noticed, she didn’t comment on it, busying herself with sorting the post., However, Hermione noticed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The twins quieted and ate their breakfast, both lost in thoughts about Sirius. She could do so much good here, so many changes she could make to make their world a better place, and maybe, just maybe, Hermione could start with the Marauders.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When Euphemia stepped into the floo to make her way to the Black home, Hermione curled up on a chaise in front of the fireplace with a book that she couldn’t focus on. James sat cross legged on the floor in front of her waiting as patiently as he could for Sirius to walk through the floo. She could remember that in this life, she hadn’t been close to her brother's best friend. However, Hermione from the future knew him well. He had been a shell of a man with lifeless hair, haunted eyes, and aged beyond his years. Sirius was snarky and rude, and not at all the kind of person Hermione would prefer to be around. To meet his younger self, and see what kind of person he had been before Azkaban was intriguing. The fire flared to life, and a small boy stepped out of the fireplace. His hair touched his shoulders with a slight wave, his grey eyes were piercing and full of the promise of mischief. The difference between the eyes of the child and the eyes of the man was striking. Had Sirius had the chance to live his life without Azkaban, and the pain and suffering... She could easily see how he had such a reputation. Hermione could admit that even she could see herself falling into those eyes and for the boyish grin.  Sirius was full of life, his stance confident, and while his features were soft with childhood, she could already see the aristocratic features just beneath the surface. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey!” James exclaimed, hopping up from off of the floor and walking up to Sirius.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, yourself.” Sirius grinned before noticing Hermione glancing just over the book in her hands. “Hi, Hermione.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hi Sirius.” Hermione stood to hug him. Hermione felt a small spark when his body pressed against hers that left her surprised. Sirius looked up at her with a question in his eyes, but neither spoke of the spark they were both sure the other felt. Sirius let her go and followed James out of the room. Hermione could hear both boys making plans for the rest of the summer. Two excited boys starting their second year at Hogwarts, finally allowed to have a broom at school and try out for quidditch. She smiled to herself and rolled her eyes before sitting down with her book and waited for Euphemia to walk through the floo.</span>
