    <p>“…Release Her!”<br/>
As Willow spoke the last word of the spell, the night fell silent. Willow glanced at Tara on her left, then Xander and Anya on her right; the three looked back at her expectantly, and Willow had to avert her gaze. Why didn’t the ritual work? She did everything she was supposed to, followed the ritual verbatim! Was it because she had translated the spell into English? Maybe if she repeated the ritual in its’ original language, there was still a little bit of the blood mixture in the urn…<br/>
Before she could suggest trying the ritual again, several things happened at once. The candles her friends held all went out, the sky turned pitch black, and lightning struck the grave in front of them. Willow cried out, covering her eyes, and was vaguely aware of her friends doing the same.<br/>
When the lightning stopped, Willow forced her eyes open, and saw a figure concealed in a black hooded cloak facing away from her, staring at Buffy’s grave marker. After a moment, the figure turned around, but all Willow could see was that the being was somewhat short, around Dawn’s height, and had bright green eyes.<br/>
“Why have you summoned me, Mortal?” The being-Osiris? Willow decided she would think of him as Osiris, to stave off the confusion- asked, in a surprisingly young voice.<br/>
“Osiris, Keeper of the Gate,” Willow said respectfully, “I have summoned you to bring back a lost soul. Buffy Summers does not deserve an eternity in Hell; she sacrificed her life to save the world. She was a soldier for the Greater Good and-”<br/>
“Give me a break,” Osiris scoffed, and Willow was shocked into silence, “The good of the many at the expense of the few? Like I haven’t heard that line a thousand times before.”<br/>
Osiris fell silent for a moment, and Willow felt as if those glowing green eyes were peering into her very soul. His gaze made her nervous and ashamed, as she remembered sitting in the sunlit meadow, her pure white dress stained with innocent blood. She didn’t know why she was so worried about his judgement-it was his ritual that required innocent blood. When Osiris let out a dark chuckle, Willow jumped, and she felt her friends standing close behind her, Tara’s slim hand slipping into her own for comfort.<br/>
“Oh, you dare summon me, witch?” Osiris demanded, “By what right?”<br/>
“By the blessing of Hecate, Mother of witches,” Willow replied, “I fight against the darkness-”<br/>
“Darkness is not the same as evil,” Osiris interrupted, “If you were truly in tune with the natural world, you would know this. But you-you have fallen off the path of so-called ‘goodness’. You, Willow Rosenberg, are well on your way to becoming an abomination.”<br/>
“Hey!” Xander stepped in front of Willow, drawing Osiris’ attention to him, “Willow is not an abomination! Willow is the nicest, sweetest girl in the world! Who are you to come here calling us names?”<br/>
“I am here because I was summoned,” Osiris snapped, letting the hood of his cloak fall back so they could finally see his face. Osiris had the appearance of a guy in his late teens or early twenties, with messy dark hair, alabaster skin, and-oddly- a pair of round, black glasses framing his bright emerald eyes.<br/>
“If you didn’t want to know the truth, perhaps you shouldn’t have summoned me,” Osiris continued, glaring at Xander until he took a step back. The green-eyed god of death then cast a sly glance at Willow, “Why, Miss Rosenberg, you’ve been keeping secrets! Come now, don’t you think your friends deserve to know just how far you’ve gone in your quest to resurrect the fallen Slayer?” Osiris glanced at the other people standing on top of the grave, “Did any of you even think to ask what, exactly, ‘vino de madre’ is?”<br/>
“Willow wouldn’t do anything that was truly dark-or evil,” Tara said confidently, and Willow felt a rush of love for her girlfriend.<br/>
“Willow is too much of a goody-goody to dabble in the really evil stuff,” Anya agreed, “I  mean, I’m surprised she even wanted to do this ritual. Do you know how much money we had to pay for your urn, by the way? I really hope it has a good resale value. Of course, we’ll have to clean it first, but-”<br/>
“Anya, Honey?” Xander interrupted, “Wrong time, wrong place. Worry about the resale value of the urn after Osiris here leaves, okay?”<br/>
“Fine,” Anya huffed, crossing her arms.<br/>
“By the way, death-guy,” Xander glared at Osiris again, “Even if Willow did have to cross over to the dark side a little, it’s your own fault; this is your ritual.”<br/>
“You are very amusing,” Osiris commented, tilting his head to the side, “And your faith in your friend is touching, even if it is misplaced. As for the ritual, it was not designed by me; it was designed by worshippers in ancient times, back when sacrifice was considered the norm. Nowadays, most gods don’t require-”<br/>
“Stop it,” Willow commanded, her voice deepening with power, “You were not called forth to make judgements on us; you were called forth to right a wrong, and return a fallen soldier. Now, do my bidding!” Wind blew around Willow, fanning her red hair around her face like flames. The god before her was unimpressed.<br/>
“Um, how about no?” Osiris replied, “First of all, I don’t take orders-not from you or anyone. Second of all, if you read the ritual through, you would know that I will not return the dead to life unless I find both the deceased and the petitioner worthy.” Osiris looked at the group of people once more. First, his eyes rested on Tara, and his expression visible softened. “You, Tara, are worthy. You are too good for this world. Your reasons for agreeing to this ritual are pure.” Emerald gaze flitted over to Anya, and his lips twitched upwards in a smirk, “You, too, are worthy, Anya. Yes, I have seen your past, but I also see who you have become, and the good you are trying to do.” Xander was the next to have his soul examined by the god-like being. “Xander Harris…yes, you are worthy.” Osiris frowned, looking between Xander and Anya, “Don’t let your doubts and fears rule you.” Green eyes turned back to Willow, and she felt herself stiffen.<br/>
“I have already passed your tests,” Willow tried to prevent Osiris from telling her friends what she had done; it was required for the ritual, but she could tell that Osiris didn’t approve-and she knew her friends wouldn’t approve either. Willow didn’t want to watch Tara’s warm brown eyes fill with disgust, “Now, bring her back!”<br/>
“You will cease ordering me around!” Willow shrank back when Osiris shouted, green eyes flashing as lightning struck the ground nearby, “I am not here to do your bidding! You, Willow Rosenberg, have been found unworthy! Your intentions are purely selfish, and you have already sacrificed one innocent life pursuing your selfish desire to return your friend to life! Tell me, Willow Rosenberg, how far are you willing to fall in order to assuage your guilt?”<br/>
“What innocent?” Tara’s question went unanswered, Osiris’ attention focused solely on the red-haired witch now.<br/>
“I-it’s not guilt!” Willow protested, “Buffy doesn’t deserve-”<br/>
“Doesn’t deserve-what?” Osiris interrupted, “Rest? Peace? She gave her life to save this world, why is that not enough? Why must you drag her back to continue fighting this battle? There are other Slayers, other warriors-her time is done!”<br/>
“NO!” Willow shouted, she could feel darkness under her skin as the wind whipped through the graveyard, “Buffy does not-she DOES NOT! Deserve to spend eternity in Hell! If you won’t bring her back, I’ll find someone who will!”<br/>
“Hell?” Osiris scoffed, “Buffy Summers is not in Hell! You know this, witch; I know you did the scrying spells before summoning me.”<br/>
“I-yes, but they didn’t work,” Willow replied, her power faltering as she felt the blood drain from her face-what she saw couldn’t be true; Willow couldn’t have gone through all this for nothing. She shook her head and gathered her power back around her, and only faltered a little when she spoke again, “I-the spells only showed Buffy with Joyce and-”<br/>
“That’s because she is with Joyce,” Osiris interrupted once again, “After all that you have seen, did you really think that The Powers That Be would let Buffy spend eternity in Hell? As soon as that portal was closed, Buffy’s soul was taken to Heaven. She has done her part, and deserves peace.”<br/>
“No, please,” Willow’s voice was small, and she felt tears burning in her eyes, “Please, Osiris…we need her. Buffy is-she holds us all together. You have to bring her back.”<br/>
“See, there’s that selfishness of yours again,” Osiris said, but his voice was gentle this time, “Losing a loved one is hard; I understand. If Buffy was in Hell, I would gladly bring her back for you, but she’s not in Hell. Buffy has earned her place in Heaven, and I won’t take that from her. You still have your lover and your friends; celebrate Buffy’s life, mourn her death, and start to heal. I’m sorry, there’s nothing more I can do for you.”<br/>
“Liar!” Willow accused, her voice a low growl, “You could bring her back, but you won’t! Even though I need her-we need her-you won’t bring her back!” Willow straightened to her full height, drawing her power around her like a cloak. “If you won’t use your power to bring her back, I’ll take it and use it myself!” Willow focused all her magic on the being, arms outstretched to reach though his body and pull his magic into her, but Osiris simply raised his hand and sent a blast of power at her, knocking her to the ground.<br/>
“You dare to attack me?” Osiris thundered, his magic creating a sphere that kept Willow’s friends from coming to her aid, “I am older and more powerful than any being you have ever encountered! I am old enough that my true name has been lost to time! Osiris is but one name of many I answer to! I am called Osiris, Hades, Hel, and Death-but none of those are who I truly am! I am not death, nor am I a pagan god-I am the Master of Death, and you cannot destroy me! With a single thought, I can rip your soul from your body and send you from this world!”<br/>
“Please!” Willow heard Tara crying, and Osiris-or the Master of Death, as he called himself, glanced up to where the other witch was pressing against the barrier, “Please, Master of Death! Don’t take her from us! Don’t take her from me! I know-I know she’s done things she shouldn’t have, but…please!”<br/>
Willow felt the Master’s power drop away from her, and she took a deep shuddering breath.<br/>
“For the sake of your friends, I spare your life,” the Master of Death told her, “And I will even give you a warning, free of charge. The path you walk is not only dark, but dangerous. You are delving deep into the magic, venturing into realms mortals are better off avoiding. Magic is a gift, but it is also a crutch-and it can cause immeasurable harm. If you continue down this path, I see danger-death, destruction, and possibly the end of the world. Listen to your friends-do not let the magic control you.”<br/>
Osiris took a step back and pulled his hood back up.<br/>
“I am needed elsewhere. If you call on me again, make sure your motives are pure-next time I will not be so understanding.” With another flash of lightning, the Master of Death was gone, and Willow was left lying on top of her best friend’s grave.<br/>
When she looked up, Xander and Anya were staring at her in shock-well, Xander was shocked; Anya looked curious. Tara though-Tara’s warm brown eyes were filled with disappointment, and Willow couldn’t stop the tears from spilling down her cheeks. Xander and Anya turned away, not saying a word to her, but instead seeking comfort in one another.<br/>
Willow hung her head, but then she felt movement near her and a warm arm wrapped around her shoulders. Her silent tears turned to violent sobs, and Willow leaned into Tara’s embrace. She cried out her anger, frustration and guilt; she cried for Buffy, who was dead, and Dawn, who lost her sister. She cried for betraying her friends’ trust, and she cried for the fawn she killed-the innocent life she had stolen, whose blood was smeared across her forehead and cheeks.  As the sky began to lighten and the stars faded, Willow cried, and Tara held her, offering love and forgiveness that she didn’t deserve.</p>
