    <p>“...they searched the whole area and couldn’t find the snake anywhere. It seems to have vanished after attacking you, Arthur...but You-Know-Who can’t have expected a snake to get in, can he?”<br/>
“I reckon he sent it as a lookout.” growled Moody, “‘cause he hasn’t had any luck so far, has he? No, I reckon he’s trying to get a clearer picture of what he could be facing and if Arthur hadn’t been there the beast would’ve had a lot more time to look around. So, Potter said he saw it all happen?”<br/>
“Yes,” said Mrs Weasley. She sounded rather uneasy. “You know, Dumbledore seems almost to have been waiting for Harry to see something like this.”<br/>
“Yeah, well,” said Moody, “there’s something funny about the Potter kid, we all know that.”<br/>
“Dumbledore seemed worried about Harry when I spoke to him this morning,” whispered Mrs Weasley.<br/>
“‘Course he’s worried,” growled Moody. “The boy’s seeing things from inside You-Know-Who’s snake. Obviously, Potter doesn’t realise what that means, but if You-Know-Who’s possessing him-”<br/>
Harry pulled the extendable ear out of his own, his heart hammering very fast and heat rushing up his face. All of the Weasley kids were staring at him, waiting to know what he had heard. They can never know. </p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Was this why Dumbledore would no longer meet Harry’s eyes? Did he expect to see Voldemort staring out of them, afraid, perhaps, that their vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet, with catlike slits for pupils? Harry remembered how the snakelike face of Voldemort had once forced itself out of the back of Professor Quirrell’s head, and he ran his hand over the back of his own, wondering what it would feel like if Voldemort burst out of his skull. . . .<br/>
He felt dirty, contaminated, as though he were carrying some deadly germ, unworthy to sit on the underground train back from the hospital with innocent, clean people whose minds and bodies were free of the taint of Voldemort. . . . He had not merely seen the snake, he had been the snake, he knew it now. . . .<br/>
And then a truly terrible thought occurred to him, a memory bobbing to the surface of his mind, one that made his insides writhe and squirm like serpents. . . .<br/>
“What’s he after apart from followers?”<br/>
“Stuff he can only get by stealth . . . like a weapon. Something he didn’t have last time.”</p><p>I’m the weapon, Harry thought, and it was as though poison were pumping through his veins, chilling him, bringing him out in a sweat as he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel. I’m the one Voldemort’s trying to use, that’s why they’ve got guards around me everywhere I<br/>
go, it’s not for my protection, it’s for other people’s, only it’s not working, they can’t have someone on me all the time at Hogwarts. . . . I did attack Mr. Weasley last night, it was me, Voldemort made me do it and he could be inside me, listening to my thoughts right now. . . . </p><p>“Are you sure that you’re alright, Harry, dear?” said Mrs. Weasley in a worried voice, as they walked around the unkempt patch of grass in the middle of Grimmauld Place. “You look ever so pale. . . . Are you sure you slept this morning? You go upstairs to bed right now, and you can have a couple of hours’ sleep before dinner, all right?”<br/>
Harry nodded dully, trying to smile. </p><p>I’m the monster.</p><p>Harry could feel his heart in his mouth. He attacked Mr Weasley. He could have killed Mr Weasley. The man who welcomed him into his home and his family like another son. The man who finds Muggles and rubber ducks interesting and collects batteries.</p><p>I’m the weapon. </p><p>He was half-way up the stairs. </p><p>“FILTHY HALF-BLOOD! STAIN OF DISHONOUR TO THE WIZARDING WORLD- YOU CHILD OF FILTH-” As usual, Sirius’s mother’s portrait screamed and wailed as Harry walked past, but unlike usual, he had absolutely no energy or real reason to force the curtains closed.<br/>
She is right. I am a stain. My darkness just spreads like spilled ink on fresh parchment, overwhelming and claiming all those who closest to me with insatiable wrath. </p><p>He reached his room. He was sleeping in Sirius’s brothers’ room as Sirius had offered it to him.<br/>
He probably thinks I’m too dangerous to sleep in the same room as someone else.<br/>
Harry laughed bitterly to himself. He was probably right.</p><p>I deserve to hurt.</p><p>No. He had promised- never again.</p><p>But I’m the monster. I’m the weapon.</p><p>This is a hole. He would never be able to get out again.</p><p>But I deserve the pain.</p><p>If he started again, he would never stop.</p><p>Just once, that’s all I need.</p><p>It was never just once.</p><p>I swear, just this one night.</p><p>He had made a promise.</p><p>“Don’t fall in. Don’t fall in. Don’t fall in,” Harry muttered in the silent room.</p><p>Just this once, he promised..</p><p>And then he fell in.</p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Harry jumped up from where he was crouched on the floor, suddenly filled with adrenaline. </p><p>His trunk. He needed his blade. </p><p>Harry had learnt many moons ago to use a disposable blade instead of his wand, so the spells could not be found when a certain person checked it. He always kept a blade hidden in the same old pair of Dudleys socks in his trunk. </p><p>Bad habits die hard.</p><p>He found the socks and tore them open, like a niffler searching for a gold coin. The second his fingers grasped the cool, brittle metal he lifted it up and brought it down on his forearm. Just under the elbow, faint scars still littered his pale skin.</p><p>One. Two. Three.</p><p>I’m the weapon.</p><p>Four. Six. Ten.</p><p>The beautiful scarlet paint was racing down his arm, landing on the cold, hard floorboards.</p><p>Fifteen. </p><p>Through the hole he fell.</p><p>Twenty.</p><p>I’m sorry Sirius.</p><p>He had lost count.</p><p>I tried. </p><p>You’ll be better off without me.</p><p>Lying, losing consciousness on the cold floor in the middle of a dead mans room, Harry realised something.</p><p>Maybe he likes the fall.</p>
