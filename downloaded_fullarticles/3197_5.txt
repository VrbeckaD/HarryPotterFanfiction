    <p>Harry Potter was sure he didn’t have a soulmate.<br/>
He is 18 and in his ‘8th’ year of Hogwarts, and yet he still hasn’t found his soulmate. Most people find their soulmate around 15 but not him, not Harry Potter. He isn’t even surprised really, the universe probably didn’t think he’d survive past the battle so why bother wasting someone on him? He should’ve died with Voldemort but somehow he’s still alive and he and the universe are both confused.<br/>
He knows he doesn’t have a soulmate because he has never once gotten a mark on his body he can explain away. See, when someone is born they will get marks on their body from their soulmate. It can be anything really, bruises scars, wounds of any sort. The difference is, the person who gets these marks from their soulmate can’t feel them, they can only see it, and after a while it’ll fade away. Bruises will fade in a half hour or so, scars will obviously start as the wounds which caused them and they’ll stay for a day maybe two, scratches fade very quickly in just a minute or two, and so on and so forth.<br/>
So the fact that Harry has never gotten one of these marks is quite concerning to him. And the only conclusion he can seem to draw is, he has no soulmate, no one will ever love him.<br/>
He just wishes that after all he’s been through, after all the people he’s lost, he could have someone to love him no matter what. That he could go up to the commons after classes and have someone there already, waiting for him, wanting him. But no the universe said fuck it when he was created, said well he’ll die quickly just let him be alone, and when he didn’t die, the universe said whelp, nothing we can do now, and left him alone.<br/>
And honestly, maybe he would die soon. Maybe he would die by his own volition, because currently he’s sitting at the dining table with Ron and Hermione sitting close together beside him, Neville and Luna aren’t too far away sharing laughs, and Seamus and Dean are right there in front of him snogging the lips off eachother. And then there is Harry sitting their in the middle of all this love and not being on the receiving end of any of it. And maybe you’re thinking, wow that’s really selfish of you Harry why can’t you be happy for your friends, and he’d tell you, well I was happy three months ago when it was all new and exciting but now every time I turn a corner I’m met with the slick sounds of lips smacking passionately while I haven’t kissed someone since Cho in 5th year! And I don’t even like girls!<br/>
Then he would flush bright red and stammer out an apology for getting so angry before looking to the floor and scurrying away quickly. Yes, it was sometimes hard to remember he defeated Voldemort when he acts so shyly.<br/>
But really, the problem still stands, Harry wants someone to love, but everyone has already been destined someone since the day they were born. So really it’s kind of impossible, which brings Harry to the ultimate conclusion of death. He’s pretty sure he wouldn’t actually commit suicide but on his darkest nights he has to think, if the reason I was able to defeat Voldemort was love then why should I stay alive when love will never be an option for me? But then he’ll remind himself he has familial and platonic love, he’ll just never get to experience romantic or sexual love. Which hurts, badly.<br/>
But there’s nothing he can really do about it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco Malfoy, on the other hand, is completely 100% sure of having a soulmate. The reason for this is because of the sheer amount of marks he’s gotten on his body since the day he was born. When he was younger he used to get big blooming bruises on various parts of his body, they didn’t hurt of course and they vanished within an hour but, everytime he got them he was filled with a confusing mix of love, and fear. Love because he knew they came from his soulmate and he was of course very excited to see any signs of life from them. The fear however came from the frequency with which he got these marks. They came almost daily, sometimes more than daily. And, sure, Draco was a very graceful child who didn’t get bruises much himself so there is always the argument he just doesn’t understand rowdy children who get hurt daily from playing, but he’s also pretty sure that even rowdy children don’t get such bruises so frequently.<br/>
When he started Hogwarts he noticed that the marks would almost stop coming completely during the school year. He would get a scratch or two every now and then but usually they were so minor he barely caught glimpse of them before vanishing. There was probably many more that he just never noticed at all. But when summer came the marks came with it without fail every year. He wasn’t sure what this pattern meant at first, but as he got older he started to understand. It was obvious his soulmate went to a boarding school, and he had an abusive homelife, that was the most logical conclusion, even if it hurt him to draw it. Really, he wanted to just find his soulmate as fast as possible and save them from whatever hell they were living in, but with Voldemort and everything in the past few years it was quite hard to focus on much of anything other than surviving.<br/>
When 7th year rolled around and the marks on his body came frequently once again, he was quite confused. It was the middle of the school year and the marks had yet to let up. He could only guess that the reason was because somehow his soulmate was being held at home rather than going to school. His concern for his soulmate skyrocketed that year but he couldn’t solely focus on that because the next thing he knew he was at meetings for the death eaters and crying every night not knowing what to do, the fear of him or his mum dying choking him up.<br/>
When the battle ended and Voldemort was defeated once and for all everything calmed down immensely. Not only for him but also for his soulmate it would seem. He started to wonder then if they went to Hogwarts, seeing as how the timing of the marks was always right when the school year ended and they stopped right when the school year started. This idea had always been in his brain but the fact that the marks also stopped with the battle he felt as though his suspicions were confirmed. It was obvious, his soulmate had been a part of the war, there was no way around it.<br/>
He knows they go to Hogwarts, and he knows they were a part of the war. The only question left to ask was, who exactly is it?</p>
