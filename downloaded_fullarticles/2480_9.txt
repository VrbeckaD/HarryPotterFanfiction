    <p>The blonde and redheaded girls had found a beautiful -- mostly empty -- apple orchard in the middle of nowhere. Luna had been driving in the old Ford truck they'd bought earlier that summer for what seemed like hours, when they saw it. </p><p>Luna parked in an area of grass, and climbed out. "Coming Peach?"</p><p>Ginny blushed at the nickname. "Comin', Sweetpea."</p><p>Coming together at the front of the black truck, Luna took Ginny's freckled hand. "Your outfit is adorable."</p><p>Ginny blushed again. She was wearing a pair of torn overalls and a gray shirt. "Thank you, Luna."</p><p>Luna swung their arms, skipping. This meant Ginny had to skip too, and her once long hair -- it was to her chin now -- hit her face repeatedly. "Where are we going?"</p><p>  "Oh, you know, to the apples! We can pick some, and then watch the clouds."</p><p>Ginny shrugged and looked her girlfriend in the face. "Last one to the first tree's a rotten Hippogriff!"</p><p>Luna laughed, which again made Ginny blush, and ran after her.</p><p>The two collapsed later -- having several apples in their pockets -- in the shade on dewy grass. "You're going to get awful stains on your dress, 'pea." Ginny said, feeling the soft, pale purple fabric.</p><p>  "Oh well, you can always teach me to wash it. You're so smart."</p><p>Ginny blushed. <em>Is this the millionth time already?</em> she thought. "Thanks."</p><p>  "And you're absolutely beautiful in the sunlight."</p><p>Her face felt on fire.</p><p>  "Not to even mention how cute your blush is."</p><p>Ginny covered her face, which felt like exploding. "God, you always make me blush so damn much."</p><p>Luna moved her hands and kissed them both. "I know."</p><p>They both laughed, as Luna laid her head on Ginny's rising and falling chest. "You know what Peach?"</p><p>  "What Sweetpea?"</p><p>  "I think I rather like you."</p>
