    <p>Granger was berating him again over something he once again had no control over. Harry was fed up. He slammed his fork points down into the Gryffindor table and stood up to stalk away in one last attempt at keeping his temper, leaving his fork embedded in the table as a lone flag of defiance. Being shrilly commanded to return was the final straw. His control over his magic slipped and flooded the Great Hall in palpable fury as he spun to face his so called friends.</p><p>"I am not a damn <i>puppet</i> for you all to control and order about as you bloody well please! Not a single one of you have asked me a damn bloody thing! You've ordered, you've presumed, you've forced me into playing the hero. Newsflash! I. Am. <i>DARK!</i> I'm also starting to wonder if old Voldemort's offer to join him is still open and if it will get you all to leave me the <i>bloody hell alone!</i> Hell, I'm wondering if <i>begging</i> him to <i>kill me</i> isn't preferable to what you damn Light people are doing to me! Snape, I'll be in the snake pit if Dumbledore rags on you to find me. I <i>love</i> the extra access parseltongue gives me to the castle and its secrets. Should have let the damn hat put me in Slytherin in the first bloody place. It might have even gotten me free of the Dursleys like I've been begging since first year," Harry ranted viciously, glaring at a scowling Ron and a shocked Hermione.</p><p>The school watched in speechless silence as he stalked out of the Great Hall which promptly dissolved into panicked chaos. The only thing that kept the school from charging after him en-mass was Slytherin house, lead by Draco Malfoy of all people, protecting his retreat.</p><p>Harry was given a blissful few hours hiding in the Slytherin common room suffering through the few weirded-out looks from those who skipped supper. He really hadn't been kidding when he told the school that speaking Parseltongue gave him extra privileges when it came to the magic of the school and he was relishing in the quiet.</p><p>Oh, he knew the old man would eventually force Severus to go get him. A simple command to the stone snake guarding the entrance had ensured only a Slytherin or Snape himself could get into the common room. He, along with everyone else hiding in the snake pit, was safe from the rest of the sheeple in the school... for now.</p>
