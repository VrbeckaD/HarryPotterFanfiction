    <p>Luna rested her arms on the balcony and looked out at the splendour spreading out before her eyes. The Astronomy tower was the perfect place to stand and stare at the scenery for hours. She could see the school grounds and Hagrid’s house, behind was the Forbidden Forest resplendent and menacing in all of their green and black foliage and beyond was the beginning of the rest of the world. Luna loved it up here; the breeze was fresh and playful today, whipping up her long hair and clearing her head from the last dregs of sleep. Dawn had risen half an hour ago and she’d watched it from this spot many times.</p><p>So transfixed she was with the pink sky and candyfloss clouds on a Sunday morning that she didn’t notice another in the tower with her. Sleek and graceful, the tabby cat peeked around the corner and padded towards the girl. She didn’t object to sharing the view. She sat at her feet and gave an experimental meow. Luna didn’t hear. The cat put out a paw. Batting the folds of the black cloak for a while, the cat stretched on her back legs and clambered halfway up Luna’s knee. The girl finally looked down and smiled at the sight of the tabby cat. She crouched down to stroke the soft fur behind the ears and under the chin. The cat purred and twisted herself around Luna’s gentle fingers, rubbing her cheek against the girl’s hand. Luna lifted the cat up to the wall next to her and stroked her head while she resumed her perusal.</p><p>‘Look at the sky, tabby. Isn’t it beautiful? Makes you want to fly right into the clouds.’</p><p>Kitty meowed in confirmation, or so Luna liked to think. For a while, cat and girl contentedly observed the view. Behind them Hogwarts was stirring slowly but surely, they could hear the sounds of waking up in the castle.</p><p>All too soon, the footsteps of an intruder invaded the peace of the open air and someone unwelcome stomped their way, someone who needed no introduction. Draco hadn’t had much sleep and his temper hadn’t been improved by the sight of dippy Luna in the spot he frequented at odd times of his choosing.</p><p>‘Hey there Loony. Doing some sightseeing? This must be a paradise compared to what you see in that little tower you live in. The river and some pigs perhaps?’</p><p>He laughed unpleasantly. The cat turned her head to look at him.</p><p>Luna observed his red rimmed eyes and tousled hair.</p><p>You haven’t slept very well, have you?’</p><p>‘No shit.’ The cat’s tail twitched. He noticed the glare of her eyes. He smirked.</p><p>‘Brought your kitty with you? Hope it likes heights.’</p><p>‘What do you do up here?’ Luna asked curiously.</p><p>He snorted and leaned on the balcony.</p><p>‘I need a reason to be here?’</p><p>‘No. I like to look at the sky and the scenery.’</p><p>‘Course you would. You’re some kind of nature loving idiot.’</p><p>Luna paid his insults no attention. She looked out across to watch the clouds drifting into vague formations.</p><p>‘There’s a hippogriff with one wing’ she pointed out. Draco rolled his eyes. ‘Sure there is.’</p><p>‘Right there.’</p><p>He knocked her hand out of the way and stared at her malevolently. ‘You really are an absolute freak, you know that?’</p><p>‘I’m just looking at the sky’ said Luna calmly. The tabby hissed and bared her teeth. Draco looked at her contemptuously and glared at the cat. He’d had enough of this company. He shot a hand out and pulled her tail. The feline screeched at the top of her lungs and swiped at him. He dodged and smirked.</p><p>‘Don’t!’ She put a hand on the cats back as if to calm her. Draco met her eyes and came closer. ‘Don’t come back up here again Loony or I’ll pitch you over the top.’ He could see she was smiling that irritating vague smile again, unfazed by his threat. He felt desperate.</p><p>He needed some space for his own to ruminate on the next step of his plan and she was stopping him. His hatred boiled over and before he knew it, he ended up doing what he said he would. But not on Luna. Before he could think about what he was doing, his hand shot out and pushed that infuriating ball of fur over the edge. Then ran.</p>
