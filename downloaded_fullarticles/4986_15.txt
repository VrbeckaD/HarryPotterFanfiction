          <div class="userstuff"><p>Astoria has never cared to live up to the legacy of her name. <br/><br/>She’s not a seer — although Daphne listened to Trelawney’s words as if Merlin himself spoke them, Astoria always thought the old windbag lived on Babbling Beverages. <br/><br/>She’s not a dark witch — and it’s frightening to know that her fiancé and her future father-in-law were Death Eaters.<br/><br/>But now that she <em>is</em> marrying Draco, a descendant of the starry Blacks, Astoria is suddenly grateful that she is named after the Titan goddess of astrology. Celestial divination is sketchy, but any advantage is welcome in the Malfoy den of snakes.</p></div>
