    <p>Maybe they taste like cherries. Or apples. Red, bruised and swollen, continuously abused by sharp teeth.</p><p>Maybe they’re as soft as they seem, even though he’s almost certain that kissing Draco Malfoy wouldn’t be soft in the slightest.</p><p>Harry licks his own lips again, his gaze transfixed on Draco’s mouth. He can’t help it, really. He’s been at it for hours now, McGonagall talking nonstop while Malfoy wore that bored mask, feet tapping under the table, eyes darting to the side every five minutes.</p><p>To his side, always meeting Harry’s face. And biting again and again those already abused lips.</p><p>Harry wants to run his hands through his own hair and pull hard in hopes he’ll finally wake up from this trance.</p><p>Then Draco finally turns his head towards him, slowly, letting his left cheek rest on his left palm, eyes still fixed on the board like he hadn’t noticed Harry’s burning stare.</p><p>That is, until their eyes meet.</p><p>Despite the angry atmosphere, always there when it comes to them, Harry knows there is something else, something new, building up in that moment.</p><p>The proof comes the moment Draco’s teeth finally release his lip and his thumb comes to replace them, stroking the soft skin while he’s still holding Harry’s gaze.</p><p>Or when Harry licks his own chapped lips again and doesn’t miss the way Draco’s free hand, as discreetly as possible, adjusts himself inside his pants.</p><p>And it all messes up Harry’s head beautifully.</p><p>Maybe those lips would look even redder wrapped around his cock, Harry wonders.</p>
