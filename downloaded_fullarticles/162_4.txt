  <i>I'm the rank outsider, you can be my partner in crime</i>
</p><p>Prologue. Late August, rural Hogsmead, 1975: </p><p>It is summer here, and Sirius is large and strong over him. </p><p>Two hands under the hem of his shirt, that pull his lower back up into a graceful arch. Then a change in precision, and Sirius hits a particularly gentle spot. </p><p>        	Remus keens, a soft wash of mournful, quietly honest the way he always is. </p><p>        	The day is cut too clean and bright. The sky, a great expanse of brilliant blue above the field they’re lying in, and August-burnt summer plants scratch and smooth naked flesh in equal measure. Great white clouds billow off in the distance, but closer, near the tip of Remus’ nose,  air glitters like gold, and he thinks this is what heaven must appear to be. </p><p>        	Sirius had laid down his jacket for Remus to lie on. Which Remus had, and then, before either really understood what happened, Sirius climbed on top of him and took what couldn’t be returned.</p><p>        	While it happens, Remus wants it to stop. Then he thinks it’s the only feeling worth anything ever and doesn’t want it to end. </p><p>        	That’s the last coherent thought to form before Sirius settles into striking his prostate with each toss of the hips, and Remus keens and lets it just wash over him like rain. </p><p>Sirius nuzzles against the cropped buzz of hair at Remus’ neck. Propped up on one shaky elbow, he stuffs fingers into Remus’ hair and neatly shoves him down to the Earth. Yet even his force is gentle, and Remus wants to cry. </p><p>Then Sirius comes, until Remus is full, and with a choked sob, he follows Sirius over the edge. </p><p> </p><p>October 1995:</p><p> </p><p>“She likes you, you know.”</p><p>        	“Who?”</p><p>        	“That girl, the Hufflepuff one.”</p><p>        	“Nymphadora?”</p><p>        	“Yeah, that’s the one!” </p><p>        	2 a.m. tea. Remus brewed it carefully, like ritual. Sirius, slumped at the table, watched him with sleepy eyes. </p><p>        	Midnight fuck and then tea, unable to sleep. The evening’s meeting weighed heavy in both their minds.</p><p>        	“And what could possibly give you that idea?”</p><p>        	“She kept staring at you the whole night.”</p><p>        	“Yes, that’s what being a werewolf gets you.”</p><p>        	“Nah, this was mighty different, love.” </p><p>        	Remus flipped the burner on and cast a look over his shoulder. Sirius had slipped on one of Remus’ button ups, large enough to fit him like a ridiculously improper dress. Except he’d only buttoned it up where it needed to be buttoned, half his chest exposed and cotton slipping off one shoulder. His hair was a mess, which he continually swept it out of his eyes and pulled it up into an unfastened knot, only to have it slip down again. </p><p>“How so, <i>sir?</i>” Remus put both hands on his hips, playfully square-jawed and defiant. Sirius snorted at ‘sir’, looking down at the near dress he wore and the little patch of thigh where it rode up because he’d primly crossed his legs. </p><p>“Because,” he said, grabbing the near-empty pack already on the table by a neglected fruit bowl and shaking a cigarette out, “she was <i>staring.</i>”</p><p>“And I told you, people <i>stare.</i>” </p><p>“She was staring at you like I used to. In the fifth year.” <i>Worn, loose loved sweaters. Rumpled sandy hair.  It went gold in the library, over wood and afternoon sun and dust.</i> Remus, mid-doling out the loose tea into cups, laughed. </p><p>“What? It’s <i>true!</i>” Sirius almost shouted. <i>Thin, pink scars, at your lip and bridge of your nose, high on the cheek near the temple. Little pained lines I could kiss.</i> </p><p>“She doesn’t like me, Sirius. If anything, I’m a curiosity. Waiting for my claws to sprout and hair to grow out my ears.” The kettle whistled, and Remus flipped off the heat, pouring out the scalding water carefully. “Oh, people never know what to do. The few who know now, when they found out, spent days skittering around and scurrying out of my way. It’s maddening.” He carried over their tea and took a seat at the table. “People <i>gawk.</i> It’s expected.”</p><p>Sirius had twisted his face into a mild snarl.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Remus fiddled with the jumper he wore, yanking it down past his underwear and naked legs. “Don’t like a lady staring?”</p><p>“<i>I </i>didn’t stare,” Sirius said pointedly. </p><p>“No, that’s not how I meant it.” Remus said. Sirius had a wonderful knack for thinking many of Remus’ criticisms either included him or were meant for him directly. “You and James and Peter did not stare.”</p><p>“Peter probably did.” Sirius sipped his tea.</p><p>“Well, Peter…” Remus had it in him to smile. “Peter did lots of things.”</p><p>They sat in comfortable silence for long minutes. Sirius lit another cigarette. Remus watched the dying fire at the kitchen’s far back. They’d cleared the Order out hours ago. Meeting first, then a meal, something to lift the spirits. Sirius had helped himself to a little too much firewhisky, Remus noted. Fingers found his hand, which rested flat on the table, and held on. Sirius looked at him with intensity.  </p><p>“Alright, Moony? What’s on your mind?”</p><p>        	“Yes, I’m alright. Thinking about the meeting tonight.” </p><p>        	“Oh…” Sirius murmured sympathy and held Remus’ cheek in his hand, thumb brushing back and forth under the cheekbone. “Of course. Yes, it’s all so awful, I know." </p><p>Taken out of time for twelve long years, he was quick to assume the strange composure he had now. Because, really, Sirius had been present for five years. Three in the first war, and nearly two now. He’d gone into Azkaban as a young man, still a boy in so many ways, and today…</p><p>
  <i>You missed so much. So much. Your pain is vast, but nothing compared to mine.</i>
</p><p>“You’ve talked to Harry lately?” Remus pivoted. </p><p>“Not as lately as I’d like.” Sirius frowned, disappointed with himself. “He’s quite busy, which is better, I suppose, than doing nothing. And, of course, I can’t tell him how worried I actually am.”</p><p>“Does he know you’re concerned?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“That’s good,” Remus said absently. Sensing a shift, Sirius returned to his tea. </p><p>Another silence less easy than the first. A pattern of clink, sip, clatter each time they drank. Sirius reached for a third cigarette, and Remus, without looking, dragged the pack away from him. They both vaguely figured they should return to bed soon, getting low-eyed and feeling the first enticing pulls of yawns. </p><p>And that was when it happened. </p><p>Sirius picked up his cup, drank the last bits down, and midway to setting it back on the table, froze. It was so strange, it caught Remus’ attention. </p><p>“<i>What?</i>”</p><p>Sirius merely stared at Remus with huge eyes. He looked just shy of ill. </p><p>“I have it.” It came out stuttered and breathless.</p><p>“What?” Remus asked again, irritated by the lack of answer and too sleepy to really think about what was so blatantly happening. </p><p>“I’ve it. It.” Sirius set the cup down and let go as if burned. He got up, braced two hands on the chair, and tried not to appear as though he was inching away from the table. Remus grabbed the cup and looked inside. And sure enough, Sirius had the Grim.  </p><p>        	Remus could not deny the clear canine formation of loose leaves settled and stuck to the cup. Pointed ears and thin snout, even a small line of leaves tracing up into a tail. Tea drank down, the cup was cold to the touch, and the hearth at the end of the kitchen burned less bright.	</p><p>“You don’t have the Grim.”</p><p>        	Sirius gaped at him. His lips worked wordlessly, and wearing only an ill-fitting button up and half naked, he started to look a bit silly. Remus stared back, equally still. His hands, settled in his lap where Sirius could not see, shook. Then Sirius nearly roared and hurled the chair halfway across the room. It cracked and splintered in a few places. A minor casualty of the animalistic fury they both possessed, Sirius’ the least tamed. No doubt worn down by time in prison, whittling away at an already volatile temper. </p><p>        	“I’ve the fucking Grim, you hear me!” </p><p>Sirius went for the cup, but Remus grabbed it. </p><p>“No, you don’t.”</p><p>“Look at it, Remus! Fucking <i>look</i>. I’ve it. It’s coming for me!” he yelled, spit flying. “While you sit there, fucking flat on your arse, so fucking calm. Telling me I don’t have it.” </p><p>His rage, Remus thought, was slightly surprising. But this was new-Sirius, After Azkaban-Sirius, he reminded himself, a different entity altogether. Quicker to claw and snap, a Sirius who shouted now, threw fits now, tossed in the night and hissed in his sleep, begged to be choked in bed and cried, fucked with some deadly edge in the silver of his eyes, and snuck elderberries and firewhisky when he thought Remus wasn’t watching. </p><p>“Because you don’t.” Remus repeated firmly. </p><p>Shouting again, Sirius rushed him, but Remus, quicker and stronger, caught the impact standing. He snarled into Sirius’ face, broad hands digging into his arms. For a second, they wrestled, snapping and spitting, taken by their own animals. Until Sirius stilled, slumped in Remus’ arms, and wept. </p><p>***</p><p>Dumbledore was waiting for him when he arrived. </p><p>        	Remus came shooting through the fireplace, floo-ed and knocked down, with an embarrassing lack of grace and a disruptive, hazy puff of smoke.</p><p>        	“Remus! How good to see you.” </p><p>Dumbledore stood by one of the crammed bookshelves and cast an amused look at Remus—who was presently picking himself up off the floor and dusting down his robes. He smiled warmly and settled behind his desk, transfiguring a small paperweight into a decent chair on the opposite side. Remus took a seat. </p><p>“Thank you for seeing me, Professor, on such short notice.”</p><p>“Why, not at all, Remus. Your owl seemed quite urgent. And I assumed your lack of explanation within the letter only further indicated the urgency.” </p><p>“Yes, sir. Yes.” </p><p>For a second, they stared at each other. Dumbledore was patient, and Remus so rattled he forgot where to begin. </p><p>        	“Well, Remus, why don’t you start.” Dumbledore held out a hand. Behind the half-moons, his eyes twinkled brightly, and Remus—not wanting to test such elastic patience—steeled himself and began. </p><p>        	“Sirius,” he said slowly “has the Grim.”</p><p>        	Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. </p><p>        	“After a meeting a few nights ago, I made us both tea, and he had the Grim.” Remus wasn’t sure what else to say. Dumbledore continued to watch him, unruffled as usual.  “He’s quite shaken up, even after I assured him the leaves bore no resemblance to the Grim at all.” </p><p>        	“And do they look something other than Grim?”</p><p>       	Remus crumpled a little then, eyes going pained. “Not at all, I’m afraid. Even someone half-blind couldn’t have seen it as anything else.”</p><p>       	Dumbledore laughed quietly. “Do you have it with you? The cup?”</p><p>Remus pawed through his robes, producing a small stone. Tap of his wand, and it transformed into the cup. “I placed a freezing charm on it. Here.” He handed it to Dumbledore, who peered into its bowl with the same mild curiosity and levity he did everything with. His lack of reaction was dissatisfying, and Remus wished he’d give some indication of the dark sign they all saw. </p><p>“Well,” Dumbledore said cautiously, “I cannot deny it’s certain resemblance to the Grim. It’s even a small tail there.” He squinted into the cup, amused, and Remus wanted to shake him. Then he focused on Remus and grew grave. “I feel the utmost sympathy for Mr. Black, Remus. He must be quite frightened.” Remus nodded. “Any omen, however unfounded, is never what we wish to receive. Please tell him that.” </p><p>“He doesn’t know I’m here, actually.” </p><p>“He doesn’t?”</p><p>“No. When he showed me the cup, I told him it didn’t look like the Grim.” </p><p>“So you lied to him?” </p><p>Remus felt old pangs of school day guilt. Then, remembering he was an adult, an Order Member, a former Hogwarts <i>professor</i>, he drew himself up and said, “I’ve always placed little value in Divination, and I didn’t want to add to any of his fears. He panicked, understandably, and I figured adding to his unease was unhelpful.”</p><p>“And yet you have come to me now, in regard to the cup?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“So you consider it concerning enough for a second opinion, other than your own? You’re a very capable wizard, Remus. I hope you know that.”</p><p>“But, Professor—”</p><p>“And you’re in agreement with Mr. Black and share his fears?”</p><p>Remus didn’t say anything. </p><p>“Ah...I see.” Dumbledore smiled. “I shall get Sybill, then?” </p><p>It wasn’t a question. If it had been, Remus would’ve said ‘no’.</p><p>During his year teaching, he’d barely spent an hour with the woman. She remained reclusive in her tower, and what he heard about her, he heard as whisperings and snickers amongst his own students. He may have possessed his own element of reclusivity, taking breakfast and lunch in his office and trying to appear busy and ‘involved’ whenever potential conversation passed, but he did not have the absolute oddness Sybill did. They’d spoken briefly a few times during dinner, and she’d given him the shivers. </p><p>Once, as he reached for the butter dish between them, she’d snatched up his wrist and read his palm.</p><p>For a second she just traced the lines with one taloned finger, spotting a thin scar by his thumb—Hoia Baciu, ‘87, painful Buck Moon—and tsking to herself. Remus hated himself for thinking she <i>knew</i>, could smell it on him or see it in his eyes. Instead, she’d turned back to the lines and said,</p><p>“Ooo, a great loss, Professor. Quite clear.”</p><p>“Had many of those,” Remus had said dryly, knowing she wasn’t listening. </p><p>“But no death,” she’d continued, “They’ll be living when you lose them. Yes, yes, yes. Prepare—” she stared up at him with freakishly large owl eyes, and said “—a funeral for the living.”</p><p>Remus had figured her mannerisms largely affectational and attention-seeking, and so he turned back to Hagrid, who was a much better conversationalist by far. </p><p>That night, however, her comment remained with him. He’d left the meal and locked himself up in his office, set the lights low, and brewed tea. Then he’d tried to make headway on the considerably lacking Hinkypunk essays but kept faltering, distracted and restless. He kept circling back to one particular individual, a possible candidate of her prediction. </p><p>But of course, it couldn’t be possible.</p><p>Locked up.</p><p>Guarded. </p><p>Mad and no doubt broken. Destroyed, Remus hoped, fucking slobbering and half-dead, the only fate someone so evil deserved. </p><p> </p><p>
  <i>Sirius was small under him, pinned in a dark corner and undone. Remus backed him into the shadowed spot and snogged his prey in the night. Three am, and the great taut shiver of getting caught. To see Minerva’s face, tight and disapproving.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Grey eyes hidden behind strands of coiled black, whimpering, and Remus didn’t know if Sirius was desperate or terrified. To think, both, and the thought thrilled him so much that he slammed Sirius up against the wall again, shoved a scarred, slender hand down his pants and pillaged the dusked sultry love right out of him.  </i>
</p><p><i>Sirius melted, scared and in awe of Remus in tandem. It ran him like a wire, hot and static. A sweet little thing taken by a big bad wolf. Unassuming in darned socks and nose stuffed in books, and sheepish little pink Humber smiles when girls teased him. But a beast he was! And Sirius begged to be taken.</i> </p><p> </p><p>Remus passed that corner each time he left his office. He’d never expected to retrace the worn castle steps of his adolescence, now here as order and mellowed maturity, instead of defiance and excitement.  </p><p>The corner pained him now. Just like the Gryffindor tables in the Great Hall and the stone ledge surrounding the courtyard outside, where Sirius had taken him in the sweltering May of their sixth year, just past midnight and kissed him under the waxing moon. The landing outside the common room portrait, a dell down the way of the Forbidden Forest, the low fence and reeds by the Shrieking Shack. Places where <i>love</i> had happened. </p><p>He passed these places quickly, eyes trained on his feet. Holiness had happened within the castle walls: indescribable elation and many nauseated just-turned nights, and friendship, and knowing for the first time in his life, he <i>belonged</i>. And he clung to that belonging like it was his own soul, terrified it would one day leave him, like smoke through his fingers, and that these years here were the best life he would ever live, and then it all came true. </p><p>And now he walked the castle alone, two friends dead and gone, and one friend a friend no longer. And every joyous memory he had made him feel agonizingly foolish. </p><p><i>I bore my soul to you and gave you my love. And I never thought, not once, that you were lying.</i> </p><p>        	Then the Hinkypunk essay before him blurred, wet and broken, and Remus didn’t even understand he was sobbing until he began shaking. </p><p>***</p><p>Dumbledore summoned Sybill through the Floo. She arrived, batty as always, draped in shawls and wispy robes, gaudy jewelry, looking dazed. When she saw Remus, her already big eyes widened to saucers behind the thick frames and she exclaimed,</p><p>        	"Remus!”</p><p>        	“Hello, Sybill.”</p><p>        	“Oh, forgive me,” she said, just out of the fireplace. She brushed past Dumbledore, who smiled at her peculiarity, and took Remus by the shoulders. “Remus, I should’ve seen earlier than I did!”</p><p>“Hm?” Remus felt a bit like a long-suffering house pet, the way she petted and fussed over him.</p><p>        	“What you are!”</p><p>        	Oh. He got it now. What she meant, through her garbled nonsense. A <i>werewolf</i>.</p><p>        	“When you left, I didn’t even get to say farewell,” she continued, straightening his robes for him. “You always had a strange aura around you, Remus, something different. I never knew what it was!”</p><p>        	“Oh.”</p><p>        	“Until now.” She beamed at him, like he was expected to be pleased. He grimaced back.</p><p>        	“But that is not why you’re here today, no!” He wished she’d stop being so exclamatory. It made him itch all over. With one long finger, she traced the air around his face, not touching him but skirting the surface, like she was reading him. Her eyes opened even more somehow, as if she’d been zapped. “A bad sign,” she said.</p><p>        	Remus gulped.</p><p>        	Then, noticing the cup on Dumbledore’s desk, she rushed over and grabbed it. “Yes! There it is.” She turned the cup in circles. “The Grim.”</p><p>        	Dumbledore, from where he stood, cleared his throat and intervened. “Sybill, Remus here has brought the cup to me because—”</p><p>        	“It’s not yours!” she shouted, whirling to face Remus and pointing. “Here, here,” she scurried over to him, gave him the cup, and closed her own hands around his. “See, there you go, I can feel it now. Can’t you?”</p><p>        	Remus just <i>stared</i> at her. Far off, he thought he heard Dumbledore chuckling.</p><p>        	“Love.”</p><p>        	“Hm?” Remus leaned forward, thinking he’d misheard.</p><p>        	“You love them. And that’s why you’re hear now. Because if it was your cup, you wouldn’t care. But you love them so much, and you’re worried.”</p><p>        	“No, I—”</p><p>        	“And you’ve lost them before, wrongly,” she whispered, searching his face. “And you don’t want to lose them now. Again.”</p><p>        	“Now you see—”</p><p>        	“Remus,” she laid a hand on his shoulder. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>        	“For what?”</p><p>        	She smiled sadly.</p><p>        	“No!”</p><p>        	“Yes.”</p><p>        	“Bullshit. Merlin,” he said, grabbing the cup back. So upset was he now that he didn’t even care if Dumbledore heard him swear, or if for one second, he dropped the serene attitude he put on every day. For his colleagues, for his students, for Harry, for Sirius, for himself. “You’re wrong.” Why couldn’t things ever go to plan? Why did something always have to go terribly wrong?</p><p>        	The Fidelius. Azkaban. His brief tenure at Hogwarts. Now this. What bad sign had he been born under to deserve it all? Who cursed him? What evil thing decided it would be amusing to watch his whole life constantly unravel itself, further and further?</p><p>        	“Remus!” Sybill rasped, hands aloft.</p><p>        	Remus rushed to the hearth. “Divination’s worth shit as it is. Don’t know why I came here in the first place.”</p><p>        	Dumbledore watched passively. Sybill stood, contorted, as if taken by a spirit, bug-eyed and distraught at Remus’ exit.</p><p>        	“Remus! Wait a moment. If you would just—”</p><p>        	Then the fire flared, and Remus disappeared into nothing.</p><p>***</p><p>They laid together, sensual and naked, hot skin to hot skin, watching light run across the ceiling from window to back wall as cars passed outside. Green-fern wallpaper, palmed and dark, bled into black paneled walls. Remus watched it move in the dark. Overtired eyes made the leaves sway and swish, as if an animal were rustling deep among the plants. Like the Congo at night, down the river—the bed, a boat, carrying them along. </p><p>        	Sirius gently untangled himself and dug around in the bedside table for cigarettes and a light. He clipped two in his mouth, lit them, and without a word, handed one to Remus.</p><p>        	“That was lovely,” Remus said softly, rolling onto his stomach, elbows on the rumpled pillow. Sirius remained sitting against the headboard. His eyes were trained on the far wall, and Remus wondered what he saw there. </p><p>        	“You still thinking about it?” Remus asked, smoking blowing out his nose. To smoke was a bad ugly habit; to smoke after sex with Sirius was elegance, a positively corrupt, un-professorial activity he loved. “It’s been a few weeks. I don’t think you’ve much to fret over. It didn’t even look like a dog.”</p><p>        	Sirius, cigarette halfway to his mouth, nodded, uncharacteristically silent. With a smooth stomp, the most-exasperated angry grace Remus had ever seen, Sirius pulled his trousers on and went to the window. Perched on the sill, he shimmied the old frame open, and remained there, tapping ashes into the tray on the little table nearby. </p><p>“Harry can never know,” he said at last. </p><p>“Of course not,” Remus said, still propped on his stomach. “The poor lad’s already got far too many things on his young mind.”</p><p>“If it were really up to me, I’d pull him out of school.”</p><p>“No, you wouldn’t.”</p><p>“I most certainly would.”</p><p>“But it is up to you now, and you haven’t.” Remus laced his fingers together and watched Sirius smoke nervously at the open window. He smiled. “Routine’s good for him, I think. Keeps a clear head in all this uncertainty. You’d corrupt him.”</p><p>“But he’d be safe.” </p><p>        	“Hogwarts is about the safest place for him to be. Safest place in Britain, I’d say. Additionally,” Remus pulled, “if you have the Grim, as you claim you do, why should Harry be with you?”</p><p>        	Sirius pensively watched the street below. If he bent to Remus’ logic, he didn’t say. The ashtray clunked the wood when he tapped more ash into it. His preoccupation was clear, all movements made strictly out of memory. </p><p>        	“I just—” he began. Cigarette stuffed between his lips, to tamp down the tremor, he kneaded and pulled at his hands. Tugging fingers, gouging palms and heartline, rocking the knuckles. Then, manically, he took the fag from his mouth, and said wetly, eyes glistening, “He just looks so much like James. So fucking like him, Remus. It’s all I can see when I look at him, saw it every single fucking day this summer. And knowing he’s in danger like this and—”</p><p>        	Overwhelmed, Sirius went back to his cigarette, shaking one leg and sniffling. Remus, still flat on his stomach, continued to watch him at the window without expression. </p><p>        	“We couldn’t save James, Remus. I wanna at least save his son.” </p><p>        	<i>But I don’t think you do,</i> Remus narrowed his eyes and smoked down the last bit of his cigarette. He sat up and grabbed Sirius’ dressing gown where it had been tossed over the footboard in their haste. Shrugging it on and tying it, he stamped his cigarette out in the ashtray and stood to his full height over Sirius and kissed his forehead. </p><p><i>I think you want to save James. And sometimes when you look at Harry, it’s not Harry you see at all. The past is what keeps you up, not Azkaban, not today’s war, but yesterday’s, and if Harry makes it through, then you’ll finally be able to sleep like the dead.</i> </p><p>“He is going to be alright, Sirius. We will make sure of that, yeah?” Remus tilted Sirius’ chin up and raised an eyebrow, awaiting his answer. Sirius nodded slowly. He winced when Remus pinched his chin, dug his thumb into the soft hollow underside of Sirius’ chin, urging more. “Whatever happens. With the world, with the war, with Voldemort. We’ll make sure it’s alright.”</p><p>        	“Yes,” Sirius whispered, breath catching on the ‘e’, so it cracked and barely made a sound. He tried again, nodding along. “Yes. Yes, we will.” </p><p>        	“Harry has you, and you have me, and we have each other. It’s going to be fine.”</p><p>        	Sirius, wordlessly, nodded. </p><p>        	“I just don’t want you worrying too much, that’s all.” </p><p>“I can’t help but worry.” Sirius looked up at him with tears full and fat on his lashes. “He’s my boy.” </p><p>“I know.” Remus took him into his arms and kissed his hair. “I know he is.”</p><p>You’re going to take Harry away, he thought, From everyone, from me. And I wouldn’t care, except in taking him as your own, he’s going to steal you just as much.</p>
