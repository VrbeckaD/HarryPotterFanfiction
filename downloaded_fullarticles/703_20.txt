    <p align="left">Something was wrong.</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She could feel it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was there in the sorting hat’s song.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was there in the food in the great hall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was there, as she walked towards the kitchens and the common room. She felt it in the air she breathed, the cold stone beneath her feet, the echoing whispers of the other children. A subtle coldness filled her. Portraits leered as they passed. They walked past a couple suits of armour standing guard in the shadowy alcoves; Hannah could have sworn that there were more of them than last year.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The ‘Puffs ahead of her turned around the corner and into the corridor that held the common rooms and paused briefly in front of the portrait that hid the entrance to the Kitchens so that the prefects could demonstrate how the door worked (tickle the pear) and to give everyone a glimpse inside while explaining how the House Elves were always nearby, ready, and more than happy to help. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hannah helped herd the first years past the kitchens and into the opening between the barrels, the entrance to the common room. (Third and fourth year Hufflepuffs helped the prefects in the first couple of weeks; this allowed Professor Sprout to choose her prefects while also giving the first years to the support they needed). She followed them inside.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The room was dimly lit by the three fireplaces set into the walls, the light emanating from them flickering and dancing, casting strange shadows that shifted and warped into humanoid figures. The lacklustre light reflected off the copper furnishings. Two large tunnels sank into the ground, these led to the dormitories and where lit with flickering copper lanterns; the portrait of Helga Hufflepuff hung between them, above the larger of the fireplaces. </span>
  <span>In one corner was a large table that was always stocked with treats from the kitchens, at the moment it was empty save for a half empty pitcher of pumpkin juice standing next to a large wooden bowl in which a handful of red apples lay. A spider scuttled out from behind a half eaten cauldron cake lying abandoned next to an empty paper plate. </span>
  <span>Pale yellow sofas and armchairs were scattered around the large fireplace, the shadowy figures upon them murmuring in low voices. There was a small first year sobbing quietly as one of the older years comforted them. Patchwork rugs blanketed the floor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thick vines with dark leaves of every colour hung from the ceiling, and around the room, on shelves, tables, chairs and even the floor there were more plants of every variety imaginable. Strange yellow flowers with red leaves that were letting out a low humming sound. Small round balls of prickly leaves adorned in crowns of tiny white flowers that smelled of caramel were dotted around the room. There was a large lumpy looking grey cactus in one corner that would shoot a disgusting goo everywhere if it was disturbed. Climbing up the walls were small vines with leaves that snapped insects out of the air. Sitting in one of the numerous pots was a large ornate black flower with paper thin petals that shifted and spiraled outwards in a mesmerising pattern, frods waving in a non-existent breeze all around it, curling and twisting in a complicated dance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The wind howled and screamed and rattled the windows, distracting her from the dark flower’s hypnotic movements. Fog clawed at the windows. Dark shapes tap tap tapping against the glass, begging to be let in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tired from the long day, Hannah crossed the room and descended into the tunnels that held the dorms. She nodded to Helga Hufflepuff’s portrait as she passed, who smiled widely in response. It was only then that Hannah noticed that she hadn’t been.</span><br/>
