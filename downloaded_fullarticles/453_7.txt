    <p>Dear readers, </p>
<p>Before doing my traditional speech, let's get some things straight first: One, I have took this book down and rewritten the chapters, so there will be new/edited content. Two, there will be a same-sex relationship and possibly more in the future of this book. Lastly, there will be smut but only in the later chapters because I don't want to move to fast. </p>
<p>Moving forward, if you have skipped over the summary, tags, or book cover, this is, in fact, a Harry Potter fanfiction crossover. Therefore, the characters and settings do not belong to me, but the original authors, unless I create characters or settings of my own. This warning covers the whole book because I'm too lazy to write it over and over again. This fanfiction will consist of my ideas and mine only. Please do not copy or post my book on another website without my permission. I do, however, allow translations of this fanfiction, but please get my permission first.</p>
<p>Updates for this fanfiction are completely random, so keep your eyes and ears open for any announcements I post because you don't know when I might update. In fact, you may want to follow me just so that you can see the announcement, but you don't have to since it was a suggestion.</p>
<p>If you like this story, don't be shy vote or whatever is it that you do here and comment to show your appreciation. Things like this make me feel warm inside knowing that someone out there likes my book and will continue to read it. I do accept feedback, so again don't be shy. If you feel like I have made a mistake, then comment and I will see whether or not I need to fix it. </p>
<p>Before you continue to the story, if you would like to message me then do so. I'm always open to conversation and making new friends. If you need someone to talk to, need help with ideas for an upcoming book, etc then feel free to message me because I'm willing to help. Down below I will list my social media and Wattpad username, so if you ever feel the need to talk then again message me.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
