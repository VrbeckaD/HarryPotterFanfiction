          <div class="userstuff"><p>Hermione stared at the young man standing in the middle of the courtyard. His brown eyes roamed around, unable to concentrate on a single focal point. She put her papers away and stepped toward him, her heels echoing across the stone floor. </p><p>His hair was a dark blonde and quite disheveled, reminding her of her best friend’s unruly locks. </p><p>“Can I help you with something?”</p><p>He whipped around and stumbled. His eyes were wide and he opened and closed his mouth. </p><p>She was startled by how familiar he looked. The arch of his brow and even the straightness of his nose and jawline. “I’m sorry, have we met before?” </p><p>He shook his head rapidly. </p><p>Her eyes narrowed. “Well, is there something I can help you with? Are you lost?” </p><p>“No,” he squeaked. “I mean,” he coughed into his hand, “I’m sorry. I was looking for Neville Longbottom?” </p><p>That’s what it was! He must be related to Neville. She knew there was something familiar about him. “Sure. He should be in Greenhouse B, right now. Are you a new intern?” </p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck. “Not exactly. I’m here on behalf of someone else.” </p><p>She led him out of the courtyard and through a set of double doors that led to the outer greenhouses of Longbottom Corp., Neville’s family business which cultivated and traded magical plants. </p><p>“I didn’t know you worked here mum-uh-Ms Granger,” He flushed. </p><p>Hermione couldn’t help chuckling. “I don’t. I’m here on ministry business.” </p><p>She led him to Greenhouse B and immediately spotted Neville bent over a raised bed of dittany. “There he is. Neville,” she called out. </p><p>Neville perked up and looked around. He waved them over. Wiping his hands over his apron, he met them halfway. “This is quite a surprise.” He looked between Hermione and the teen. A look of confusion spread across his face, but his smile remained. “What can I do for you?”</p><p>Hermione turned to the boy and frowned. “I’m sorry, I didn’t catch your name?” </p><p>The boy stammered. “That’s not important. I was just here to drop this off.” He stuck his hand in his coat pocket and took out an envelope.</p><p>“Who is this from?” Neville carefully looked it over. It was rather odd to receive anonymous mail like this. Odd and worrisome. </p><p>The boy looked between Hermione and Neville, a small smile on his face. “Just from a long-time supporter. I gotta go. See you later da-ah, Mr. Longbottom. Ms. Granger.” He bowed nervously. He took a quick look at both of them and then turned on his heel and jogged out of the greenhouse. </p><p>Hermione and Neville were silent for a moment. </p><p>“That was odd, right?” Neville finally said. He fingered the envelope, breaking through the seal. </p><p>“This whole time I thought he was related to you,” Hermione commented. “He looked like you.”</p><p>“He did?” Neville pulled out the letter. “I thought he looked like you.”</p><p>“How?” She watched him flip open the letter and read over its contents. </p><p>“Well, he had your eyes,” he said slowly. His eyes shifted across the paper as his face got redder and redder. </p><p>“Neville, is everything alright?” </p><p>He visibly gulped. He stuffed the letter back in the envelope. “Fine. Just fine.” </p><p>Hermione, however, was skeptical. Something in that letter obviously unnerved him. She watched as he stuffed the letter into his apron pocket, moving in a nervous fashion, not unlike the way the boy moved.</p><p>“Neville,” she scolded. </p><p>He grinned at her, running his fingers through his dark blonde hair. “You know, I’ve been meaning to ask this. I just never had the nerve because I was too scared to hear your answer.” He dropped his hands to his sides and took a deep breath. “But, now I don’t think I’m scared anymore. Hermione, will you have dinner with me?” </p><p>It was her turn to redden. “What do you mean? Like a date?” She said almost in a whisper. </p><p>He stepped forward. “Yes, quite like a date.” </p><p>She bit her lip but she couldn’t help the smile coming to her face. “I’d love to.” </p><p>A few meters away from the greenhouse a blonde haired youth watched as the two war heroes blushed and stood precariously close to one another. </p><p>He reached into his pocket and pulled out a photo. The image of his smiling face, along with his two younger sisters was now clear as day. </p><p>The letter was a good idea. His father had written it himself when he was nervous about confessing to his crush. It was in good hands. </p><p>He’d probably never truly understand what occurred to make his travel back in time necessary, but he was relieved to see his efforts had a satisfying ending. He did very much want to exist. </p><p>Seeing his parents, so young, but lacking any recognition of him hurt a little. He couldn’t wait to get home. </p></div>
