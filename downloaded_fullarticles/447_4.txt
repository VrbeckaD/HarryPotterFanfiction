    <p>There is very little in the world that Louis loves more than the smell of freshly trimmed grass on the pitch. With a deep breath, he takes in the wide expanse of gorgeous green field, broom in hand, and realizes how lucky he really is to be standing here. Here, in his final year at Hogwarts, Louis can recall exactly how he felt the first time he stood on these grounds. A wide-eyed boy who couldn’t comprehend what he was in for. For an incredibly long time, he thought the concept of magic, and a school for <em>wizards </em>was all part of an elaborate joke, played on him.  </p><p>He remembers receiving the very first letter, with its crimson wax seal, addressed to him from ‘<em>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.' </em> Perplexed, he read its contents, and crumpled it immediately in white-hot rage. What idiot thought he would believe <em>this </em>rubbish? He tossed in the bin, and dismissed it as a prank from one of his classmates. </p><p>Louis gave no more thought to the letter, until three days later, when he found another on the mat by his front door. Again, from <em>Hogwarts. </em>He rolled his eyes, wondering why someone would be so dedicated as to continue on with the same foolish joke, and it found its way into the bin. </p><p>The weeks after were quite hellish, as he found letters in places a letter should not be. In the medicine cabinet in the bathroom, under his pillow, in the refrigerator under the <em>milk</em>. Inside his guitar case? A letter. In his school bag? Another bloody letter. Each one only made him angrier, but he was determined not to let anyone get the best of him by blowing up over some joke. (Louis prided himself on his stubbornness.) </p><p>No, he was never convinced, not until a strange woman in a hideous brown suit and wildly unfashionable woolly hat came knocking at his door.  </p><p><em>They</em> <em>were sat on his couch, in his perfectly normal living room, having a perfectly </em><b><em>abnormal </em></b><em>conversation.</em></p><p>
  <em>"You've always believed yourself to a bit different, haven't you?" She asked, with knowing eyes. </em>
</p><p><em>“Well, yes, but this – this is impossible!” He sputtered, gawking at the woman. “How can you say all this with a straight face? Did somebody put you up to this?” </em> </p><p><em> “Have you ever been able to do things? Things you could never quite explain, that you’ve never shared with anyone for fear of being called mad?” </em> </p><p><em> Louis recalls last month, when he wanted to shut the door of his bedroom but didn’t want to move from his desk. He did it. With his mind. He attributed it to the wind blowing from the outside, a coincidental accident. Though, some small part of him knew... </em> </p><p><em> “Y-yes.” </em> </p><p><em> The woman merely smiled, and left one final letter in his lap. “Enclosed is a list of all necessary books and equipment. The Hogwarts Express will be waiting at King’s Cross Station, platform 9¾. Term begins on September 1</em><em>st. </em> <em>  I look forward to seeing you then, Mr. Tomlinson.”  </em> </p><p><em> From his doorway, she gave one final wave, and lit a roaring fire in the fireplace from where she stood. With a wink and a sly smile, she was gone. Louis’ jaw fell to the ground. </em> </p><p>Relaying this experience to his mother took the remainder of the summer. </p><p>Louis later learned that his mother and sister were, what wizards called, “Muggles.” And he was “Muggle-born.” He had obviously never heard this term in his life, but he never liked the sound of it. It sounded like an offense from the beginning.  </p><p>He remembers his first stroll down Diagon Alley. It was unlike anything he’d ever seen. He first stopped first at Honeydukes, (where he consumed <em>way </em>too many Fudge Flies,) before picking up his books from Flourish and Blotts. His heart skipped several beats as he read some of the titles. <em>A Beginner’s Guide to Transfiguration, Defensive Magical Theory, Basic Hexes for the Busy and Vexed, A History of Magic!  </em>It was thrilling for Louis, who never loved subjects in school back home. Now he knew why, look at what he was missing out on!</p><p>Above all, acquiring his wand may have been his favorite activity of the day. Twelve and a half inches, made of Rosewood, with a dragon heartstring core. Holding it in his hand, feeling the tingles up his spine – he couldn’t help but grin so wide he thought his face would split in two. </p><p>Then he was finally at Hogwarts, and the talking hat proudly proclaimed he was a <em>Slytherin! </em>Whatever <em>that </em>meant! </p><p>He joined his new Slytherin brothers and sisters, some friendly, and others not so much. He made friends with a lad called Liam almost immediately, bonding over their love for football and chips. He explained that if Louis liked sports, he would love something called <em>Quidditch.  </em>So many strange terms in so little time, and Louis did his best to keep up.  </p><p>By whatever stroke of fate, he and Liam ended up assigned roommates, and the rest was history. They spent the entire first night together going over Quidditch highlights and eating the junk comfort food that Louis’s mother had packed in his bag.  </p><p>Now, seven years later, he stands on the pitch with confidence. The smell of grass in his nose and breeze in his hair.  </p><p>The smell of a new day, of new beginnings, of-  </p><p><em> Whizz! </em> </p><p>Louis drops to the ground just as a Bludger passes over him. </p><p>“Oi, Antony, are you trying to take me head off?” Louis calls. A wide grin spreads across his face. “That is what I’m <em>talking about!  </em>Where was that action last year? Good work, lad!” </p><p>Antony, a fifth-year, waves from across the field. It was nice to see him practicing. He’d gone out for Beater last term, but didn’t make the cut. Beaters must be broad, big men, and Antony hadn’t quite put the muscle on required to send those Bludgers across the field. However, it was evident he’d been practicing over summer break, his biceps noticeably larger. </p><p>Louis tips his head back. The sun kisses his skin gently, and he basks while the weather is still in his favor. It’s a brilliant day for Quidditch trials.  </p><p>After years of bruises, one broken arm, and hours on the pitch, Louis was finally Captain. He’d been making the team since he was a first-year, (he was always a natural, if he did say so himself,) and he watched with starry eyes in admiration towards his teammates as they helped shaped him into the player he was today. The captain during his fifth year, Finnegan Byrne, went on to play for the Ballycastle Bats. Louis shivers at the thought of the day he could step onto a professional Quidditch pitch. </p><p>Today, however, was not that day. Today was Louis’ chance, to hand-select his very own team. The best of the best, to make certain that Slytherin would win the Quidditch Cup this year. His last year to proudly wear the emerald and silver colours, to represent everything he cared for. </p><p>He takes in a deep breath. It was a great turnout, what looked like twenty or so students chatting amongst themselves and catching up from summer break. He notes that there are a few who look like first years, and wonders if he was ever that young. Feels like a lifetime ago, now. </p><p>“Right then!” Louis shouts over the clamoring. After a moment all heads turn in his direction, and he feels a slight lurch in his gut.  </p><p><em> ‘Keep cool, Louis. You’re in  </em> <em> charge. </em><em>You’ve earned this.’ </em> </p><p>“For those of you who don’t know, I’m Louis, I’m a seventh year, and I will be your Captain.” This statement is met with a light smattering of applause, and Louis waves it away with a chuckle.  </p><p>“There’s no need for that. It’s nice to see familiar faces, as well as some new ones. I did want to begin today by mentioning that just because you made the team last year will <em> not  </em>mean you are guaranteed to make the team this year. Am I clear?”  </p><p>The prospectives nod their heads, and Louis smiles. “With that out of the way, we can begin! I want to start with a few basic drills just to get a sense of-” </p><p>“<em>Hey!” </em> </p><p>Louis cringes at the sound. That voice makes his skin crawl, and his face flush with angry heat. He turns to meet the one face he didn’t care to see, not on this perfect day. </p><p>Louis sighs. “What can I do for you, Styles?” </p><p>The captain of Gryffindor’s Quidditch team saunters over, in that horribly pretentious way that he does, and sneers at Louis. </p><p>“Gryffindors have the pitch reserved, today.” </p><p>Louis snorts. “That’s not at all true.” </p><p>“It is.” He’s all too pleased as he hands Louis a folded piece of paper. “Signed by <em>McGonagall</em>, as you’ll see at the bottom.” </p><p><b> <em> Due to a scheduling miscommunication on behalf of the administration, it has come to my attention that both Gryffindor and Slytherin teams are scheduled for time on the Quidditch pitch on Saturday morning. As the Gryffindor’s claim to the field came first, Slytherin House may have the pitch from first light on Sund- </em> </b> </p><p>Louis curses under his breath. Totally unnecessary, getting this document signed by the Headmaster. Louis knows it was only to shove in his face how much she’ll let slide for Styles and his team. Damn that ancient witch, and her completely unabashed bias towards these airheaded buffoons. <em>Scheduling miscommunication. </em>It’s bullshit, and he knows it. No one ever reserves the pitch as early as he did.  </p><p>He crumples the paper and tosses it to the side, hoping to Merlin that his face isn’t too red.  </p><p>“You heard ‘im lads,” There are collective groans from the group. “I know, I know. We’ll reconvene this time tomorrow.” </p><p>Louis recovers his broom from the ground, shoving past snickering Gryffindors on the way.  </p><p>- </p><p>“So bloody typical!” Louis exclaims, slamming his bag on the table. The Slytherin common room is mostly empty, as per usual, but the few people around look up with concern. It was normally this way. Peaceful, but never too silent. Louis liked the quiet company of someone else while he studied. He couldn’t imagine what the Gryffindor common room must be like, all that noise and barbaric activity. You probably couldn’t take nap there without having a willy drawn on your forehead.  </p><p>“Whoa, whoa, what’s happening?” Liam looks up from his book. He’s sat at a table near the fireplace, notes scattered all around him. “What’s got your knickers in a twist, Lou?” </p><p>Louis sighs, collapsing onto a leather couch. “My first day as captain, and you’ll never believe who comes to piss on my parade.” </p><p>“Who?” </p><p>“<em>Harry bloody Styles</em>.” </p><p>Liam glances up. “What? What was he even doing there?” </p><p>“Apparently he crawled so far up McGonagall’s arse that he got her to give him the pitch today.” </p><p>“I thought you had the pitch reserved a week ago?” </p><p>“I <em>did. </em>It was a ‘scheduling miscommunication.’ My arse. As if the administration ever makes a mistake.” Louis mumbles, sinking further into his seat. “It was a perfect fucking day for trials, too. Great turnout.”  </p><p>“I’m sure no one thought any less of you for having to reschedule tryouts. It was out of your control,” Liam states calmly, in the same tone he always took when Louis got panicky.  </p><p>“I don’t give a damn about having to reschedule. It’s that idiot <em>Styles  </em> that made me seem like I didn’t know what I was doing. He’s <em>always  </em>been out to get me, Liam. Big dumb bloke can never just let me live in peace. Today is a perfect example of that! I’m on the pitch minding my own, and takes sick pleasure in watching me fail. He loves to see it.” </p><p>“Louis. You didn’t <em>fail </em>anything. You had to reschedule Quidditch trials.” </p><p>“It’s the principle, Liam,” Louis groans, flopping dramatically back to the couch. “The fact that he got what he wanted, and was able to trample all over my plans on his way. I wanted to whack him with my broom.” </p><p>“I’ve missed your rambling.” Liam chuckles.  </p><p>“Oh, shut up,” Louis pouts, crossing his arms. </p><p>“I should be telling <em>you </em>to shut up. I haven’t been able to study all week.” </p><p>Louis makes a face. “Term only started five days ago.” </p><p><em>“Exactly</em>.”  </p><p>Liam was constantly studying, reading something new, or writing articles on his own blog. He was aiming to work at the Ministry of Magic one day, as an official. Louis knew that it would happen, too. Liam had always been the most intelligent of their group of friends, with only the exception of Zayn. Zayn, a Ravenclaw, was consistently bickering with Liam over who would be top of the class. Louis would wager Zayn and Liam may have the same grades, but Liam’s Slytherin tendencies of ambition always made him go the extra mile, even when not necessary. It pushed him far over the edge. Seeking extra credit, even though he’d aced a test. It drove Zayn wild. Around fifth year, Louis suspected there may have been something other than friendly competition going on between the two of them. As crazy as it seemed, when Louis carefully approached the subject, Liam was overly apologetic. </p><p>“I was only waiting for a way to tell you,” He explained, but Louis only hugged him. </p><p>It was odd, Liam’s feeling like he needed to apologize. Louis had <em>no </em>issue with Liam being gay. Liam was his best mate in the world, he could’ve been a serial murderer and Louis would’ve found a reason to love him through it. Besides, Liam was a good-looking lad, so his being gay only meant more ladies for Louis.  </p><p>In truth, Louis missed Liam more than he could possibly know. The summer months dragged for him, stretching from two months into what felt like <em> ten </em> . How could they not, with such an ordinary life awaiting him at home? It was always lovely to see his mother, and to spend time with his younger sisters, but his heart yearned for Hogwarts. For the magic, and the friends, and the alternate life that he’d built for himself. No matter how much of this world he explained to his family, Louis’s stories were always met with the same vague confusion. They would never  <em> really  </em>understand, and Louis knew that. </p><p>He felt guilty, as didn’t see his family often. But as he sat in his childhood bedroom, his trunk sitting at the foot of his bed and his wand lying dormant, he felt an itch he knew wouldn’t be scratched for another 9 weeks.</p><p>It was the most anxious he’d ever been to get back to school, but in the same breath, he knew it was his last time to get excited for a new school year. He wanted so badly for it to begin, while knowing that once it did, that meant it would eventually come to an end.  </p><p>Lost in thought, Louis doesn’t notice the sound of footsteps behind him, so when a kiss lands on his cheek, he jumps. </p><p>“Been looking for you all day, you avoiding me?” </p><p>Louis laughs at the sound of her voice, and turns to see his favorite face. </p><p>“No dearest, could never avoid you. Not without fear of you sending the hounds after me.” </p><p>“Hey, Elowen,” Liam smiles.  </p><p>Liam and El grew up together, as their fathers worked in the same department at The Ministry. When Louis became friends with Liam, he also gained a fiesty blonde that never failed to keep him on his toes.  </p><p>It wasn’t till December of last term that Louis even thought of her as something other than a friend, when Liam suggested Louis take her to the Yule Ball.  </p><p><em> “</em><em>Elowen</em><em>?” Louis sputtered. “Why on Earth would I take </em><em>Elowen</em><em>?” </em> </p><p><em> “I may or may not have inside information as to the fact that she would like for you to-” </em> </p><p><em> “Li. This is a once in a lifetime moment, we’ll never see another Yule Ball in our entire lives. You’re telling me I should take the girl who throws spitballs at me? She’s going to hit me in the bloody face before I even get through-” </em> </p><p><em> “She’s in love with you, you moron!” Liam instantly turned a shade of pink. “I didn’t tell you that.” </em> </p><p><em> “You’re taking the piss.” </em> </p><p><em> “I’m not!” </em> </p><p><em> “You are. There’s no way.” Louis sat back into his chair. “</em><em>Elowen</em><em> Stone,” he said, in slight wonderment. “I’ll be damned.” </em> </p><p>“<em>Y</em><em>ou cannot tell her I told you this way.” Liam said desperately.  </em> </p><p><em> “If this is some kind of joke, Liam, I swear to Merlin’s fucking beard-” </em> </p><p><em> “Why would I ever make a joke of this?”  </em> </p><p><em> After a day of threatening Liam within an inch of his life, he decided to ask El to the Yule Ball, hoping he’d make it out alive.  </em> </p><p><em> He caught sight of her after a class, and ran up to catch up with her quick strides. </em> </p><p><em> “Hey, El,” Louis said, matching her pace. </em> </p><p><em> “Lou-lou!” She exclaimed, greeting him with a punch in the arm. “Why are you coming this way? I thought you had Defense this hour, there’s no way you’ll make it in time.” </em> </p><p><em> “Well, yeah I know, I just had something I wanted to ask you,” Louis felt his stomach drop. Was he really about to do this? </em> </p><p><em> “If you’re going to ask me for my Herbology notes, you can piss right off.” </em> </p><p><em>  “No, not at all – El, would you just stop for a minute?”  </em> </p><p><em> Most everyone had disappeared into their classrooms by this point, and El shook her head firmly. </em> </p><p><em> “Louis, I’m going to be late for Magical Theory, you know Professor Condower gets crotchety when she can’t start the lesson-” </em> </p><p><em> “Elowen!” Louis stopped in his tracks. “Will you go to the Yule Ball with me?” </em> </p><p><em> She turned to meet Louis, and looked him very squarely in the eye. She said nothing. Louis thought what a monumental mistake he’d just made, until she broke the silence with a very definitive,  </em> </p><p><em> “Fine.”  </em> </p><p><em> And spun on her heel, and left him standing in the corridor. Through the next few days they barely spoke, and when they did, it certainly was </em><b><em>not </em></b><em>of their impending date. </em> </p><p><em> Flash forward to the night of the ball – where he stood nervously outside the Slytherin common room, in the itchy suit his mother had sent  </em> <em> him</em><em>, wringing his hands. Realizing they never set a time to meet, he appeared outside an hour before just to be safe, and sent up three messages to let her know he had arrived.  </em> </p><p><em> He started to think that maybe she was going to stand him up, which really shouldn’t have been a surprised, when she came down the stairs. </em> </p><p><em> Louis couldn’t fathom how she could look so different, but be the same girl he’d always known – her blonde hair curled and the  </em> <em> navy blue </em> <em>  dress she wore seemed to be alive with sparkles jumping off her skin. She was undoubtedly, the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. </em> </p><p><em> “Alright then, quit your gawking.” She said, but it wasn’t packed with the usual disdain in her tone. Instead a rosy blush appeared on her cheeks, and Louis loved it. “You better show me a good time. If you step on my feet even once I’ll turn your hair green.” </em> </p><p>Louis only smiled at her then, and he smiles at her now as she hops over the couch and swings her legs over Louis’ lap, smiling slyly. “Just so long as you don’t forget it.” </p><p>“Winnie, you never let me forget a thing that comes out of your mouth.” </p><p>El fakes a gag, tossing a pillow in Louis’s direction. “I told you to stop calling me that in second year, you idiot. I’m not a bloody bear.”  </p><p>“Force of habit. You’ll always be my Pooh-bear.”  </p><p>This time the gag comes from Liam, who’s begun packing his books. “Well, I should leave you two,” He says, and Louis recognizes the giddy energy that has come over him.  </p><p>“Y'going to see Zayn?”  </p><p>Liam nods. “Yes, well - not quite. Niall’s got him at Three Broomsticks and Zayn can’t get him to go home. I’m going to see what I can do.” </p><p>Niall, the fifth member of their friend group, was a Hufflepuff who liked nothing more than drinking and laughing loudly. Once you got him going, there was very little you could do to get him to come down.  </p><p>Louis checks his watch and laughs. “Liam, it’s only 9:00. Tell Grandpa to wait a few and we’ll all go.”   </p><p>El hops up from the couch with a grin. “I could use a Butterbeer.”  </p><p>“I’m going to tell Zayn you called him a grandpa,” Liam warns. “You know he likes to get up early to make sure his notes are in order for class.” </p><p>“Ah, Zaynie can shuffle papers the day after tomorrow. Besides, we haven’t really all been back together since the term started.” </p><p>Liam groans, but Louis knows he’s won this round. </p><p>An hour later, Louis is two and a half Butterbeers in, only a little tipsy. He takes stock of his friends around him, El's hand on his thigh, and his heart swells. They’re smiling and laughing and just generally being the greatest people he’s ever known. He can feel the weight of summertime anxiety sliding away, replaced with the golden warmth Hogwarts has provided for him since he first stepped foot onto the grounds. It's his last year with these magical people, in this magical place.</p><p>He is ready to make this the best one yet. </p>
