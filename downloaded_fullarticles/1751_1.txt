  <em>Insulted.</em>
</p><p>Her cheeks flushes with shame, incapable of pretending fake indifference before the scorn of the other Death Eaters.</p><p>In truth, though, they don’t matter to Bella.</p><p>It’s <em>His </em>icy laugh to wound her like a scorching iron.</p><p>
  <em>Taunted.</em>
</p><p>By her own Lord, the one she’d have never wanted to fail.</p><p> </p><p align="center">**</p><p> </p><p>She looks at her sister, now incapable of keeping high her gaze once so fierce.</p><p>She watches her nephew, a fearful boy who lacks of determination.</p><p>She thinks of the Metamorphmagus wedded to a filthy werewolf with no qualms, and she feels boundless rage realising the Blacks are only the pale memory – or not even that – of what they’ve been in their glorious past.</p><p>A past when no Black would have dared to contaminate his pureblood with a beast, a past when they couldn’t be forced to lower their gaze under the devious laugh of a handful of peasants.</p><p> </p><p align="center">**</p><p> </p><p>Bellatrix doesn’t to point that out, but there is no need for the Dark Lord to ask her to rectify it.</p><p>She already knows what she has to do.</p><p>Twisting a lock of her long, thick, ebony hair, Bellatrix realises she should engage a bit of <em>cleansing </em>starting from her own bloodline, now stripped of its noble prestige.</p><p>The idea of letting this hideous truth get past her becomes suddenly intolerable.</p><p>It’s time to eradicate the <em>impurities</em>.</p><p> </p><p align="center">**</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Hug her any change you get, traitor of your blood.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Soon one of those hug will become the last, pathetic act of love you’ll be able to share with your daughter… because she won’t see the end of this war.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And this is not a threat.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It’s a solemn oath.</em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">**</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>It’s fear what I read in your eyes, my beloved sister, but I won’t let the fright of seeing your son failing uproot your statuary tenacity.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I miss your haughty confidence… undermined by your husband’s mistakes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And an uncomfortable thought grows in my mind…</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Will you still be able to serve your Lord?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>No, I don’t want to question your loyalty… but I sense you don’t worship him enough.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>That you would never sacrifice everything for him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I try to get over this doubts, because if they are true, you’d be an obstacle to reconquering our ancient integrity of blood and thoughts.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>If they’re true, you may not see the end of this war as well…</em>

  <em>Anguish.</em>
</p><p>Suddenly, she realises the woman’s gaze frightens her. She sees in those eyes the same sparkle she’s glimpsed in her sister’s… and in Andromeda’s.</p><p> </p><p align="right">{<em>Unworthy to be called sister</em>}</p><p> </p><p>Another episodes crosses her mind.</p><p>Even that day she’d seen the same gaze…</p><p align="right"> </p><p align="right">{<em>Agonizing screams of a woman</em>.</p><p align="right"> </p><p align="right">Tormented to the bone.</p><p align="right"> </p><p align="right">
  <em>Despite everything, she still withstands.</em>

  <em>Nothing but harrowing howls leave her lips.</em>

  <em>I keep inflicting her pain.</em>

  <em>I wonder how she can endure it.}</em>

  <em>Perhaps, if I’d been a mother too…</em>
