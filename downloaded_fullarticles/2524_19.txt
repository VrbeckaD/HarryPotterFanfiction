    <p> </p><p>“And how would you like to be classified for our records, as a gay or straight Alpha?”  </p><p>The man looks at him, fingers poised above his keyboard, ready to decide Percy’s fate with the single push of a button. He swallows, feeling more nervous than ever.</p><p>“I had a bit of an erotic experience with a man in college, but usually I only date women… is there a bisexual option?” He gets a look that tells him he’s extremely shit out of luck. “No, I’m afraid not.”</p><p>There isn’t a hint of sympathy on the man’s face, and Percy sighs.</p><p>“Oh, well, I suppose... I was never very successful with women… so perhaps I’d better...” He trails off.</p><p>“So you’d like to be registered as ‘gay’ then?” The man asks, and Percy nods.</p><p>“Very well. This is not eligible for changing, so you need to be certain.” Percy’s head drops into his hands.</p><p>“Fuck. You’re already making this harder than it needs to be. Please don’t make it sound like… a death sentence.”</p><p>The man smiles tightly.</p><p>“And you don’t need be rude. There, you’re classified as gay. You may only attempt to court male omegas or betas that you may encounter in the facility. Now, should you fail at this, do you know which animal you would like to become?”</p><p>Percy doesn’t argue or even ask about other male Alphas, and frankly, he wasn’t even that <em> rude </em>, just trying for some compassion. Clearly the company is biased in the extreme, shunting everyone into strict categories based on outdated ideas about gender and sexuality. He swallows thickly, and pushes his glasses up the bridge of his nose, from where they’ve slid down as he begins to sweat from nerves. “I’ve given that a lot of thought, after losing my brother, I’d uh, like to be a lobster. They live long and happy lives.”</p><p>The man behind the desk doesn’t appear impressed or even surprised by his choice, simply making a note on Percy’s file, then smiling grimly. “Very well. Your profile is complete. As with everyone, the Company wishes you the best of luck with your love life. Good day, Mister Graves.”</p><p>Percy gets a <em> ‘welcome’ </em> packet and takes his own luggage to his room he’s been assigned for the month.</p><p>His pet, former brother Jason, rest his poor dog dumb mind, is waiting for him.</p><p>Percy pets him almost absentmindedly, grateful for him to be there, but also terribly afraid of his own life turning into this mockery. The room is sparsely furnished, and gives off a very clinical aura.</p><p>It’s hellish to an Alpha craving the sweetness or comfort of an omega’s scent. Or anything nicer than bleach.</p><p>Clearly it’s not meant to be lived in beyond the temporary stay that singles will be in need of.</p><p>Percy sets his things down and unpacks enough to change out of his travel clothing, sets out a hopefully appealing get up for the next day, and then strips to go take a hot shower.</p><p>The water pounds into his forehead, and does absolutely nothing for his headache, mainly due to stress and nerves. Jason whines at the door, pawing at it briefly, until Percy finally emerges from the bathroom in a cloud of steam, glasses left on the bedside table to prevent fogging over, so that everything in the room is a touch blurry, and far more comforting.</p><p>By the time he drifts off, completely naked under the crisp and cold sheets, the headache has subsided from a throbbing pain to a dull ache, with Jason curling up at his side, Percy closes his eyes and prays that he’ll have better luck than his brother.</p><p>Breakfast is the equivalent of a hotel, with hot coffee that tastes and smells only slightly burned, Percy chokes a cup of it down before trying the food. It’s scrambled eggs, possibly powdered, and biscuits that might have been fluffy coming out of the oven, but are now soggy under the weight of sausage gravy with far too much salt. He’s grimacing at his fork when he looks over to see a few other people eating alone at such an early hour.</p><p>The dining room is sparsely populated with other nervous singles.</p><p>By the scent of them, and the lack of eye contact, they’re betas and omegas.</p><p>Percy feels horribly awkward, despite being technically the most eligible single in the room.</p><p>Jason had woken him up around six with a cold nose pressing to Percy’s neck, and he just couldn’t fall back asleep, so he just got dressed and went down to the dining room.</p><p>The housekeepers were supposed to take care of his dog’s needs, so he wasn’t concerned about that.</p><p align="center"> <img src="https://i.ibb.co/MfPpz5F/Lobster-AU-1.jpg" alt="f1" width="1035" height="600" data-pagespeed-url-hash="3598927750" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/></p><p>Percy eyes the younger man, sitting by a window, looking out at the forest that flanks the edge of the compound. He’s someone who looks about twenty five or so, younger than what Percy would usually allow himself to notice, with long dark hair so silky it’s almost gleaming in the early sunlight.</p><p>He has dark eyes and red plush lips, temptingly so, making Percy’s slumbering libido jolt into overdrive. Instinctively, he knows that <em> this </em> must be an omega.</p><p>He munches on a piece of toast to distract himself, and puts his coffee cup back down to give himself something to do, while his brain whirls with questions.</p><p>How could someone so lovely and delicate be single?</p><p>Why would an omega like <em> that </em> ever be driven to join the Company?</p><p>Out of desperation?</p><p>Or force?</p><p>Percy isn’t sure he wants to know.</p><p>He’s at the point where it’s do or be condemned to a life as an animal, but he’s had almost forty years to find someone. Percy was just married to his work for so long that by the time the law passed, and his brother failed, that was all that gave him a stark reminder of his obligations to the family name.</p><p>The next time Percy sneaks a look over at the beautiful omega, he gets caught.</p><p>Being stared at feels wrong, and he knows he’s not worthy to even speak to such a creature, so he drops his gaze to the dregs of his coffee, swallowing the last few bites of toast.</p><p>He leaves the dining room as quickly as he can, going back to his room to retrieve Jason, and then taking the hallway out to the back of the compound.</p><p>There’s a big stretch of grass, and trees, along with a man made pond, all before the fenceline.</p><p>Jason runs off, intent on chasing a squirrel or something, while Percy follows at a slow pace.</p><p>He’s horribly out of shape, he knows, his back is sore from years at a desk, and his gut hampers him from running after the dog. He reaches the forest line, and can’t see through the trees, Jason is entirely hidden by the foliage. Percy calls out for him, feeling a touch of panic. He can’t <em> lose </em> his brother. Not again.</p><p>He’s practically the closest thing to a friend he’s got.</p><p>Percy damns himself for being so narrow minded with work, always work.</p><p>He may be rich, but all the good that money will do him with less than a month ticking away, til his life ends, if he remains single. “Jason! Where are you?” He yells again, and tries his best to run, chasing what looks like a semi new trail forged through the fallen leaves and dirt pathways.</p><p>Percy comes to a clearing and spots the familiar white and black fur, with the sweet face of a lab.</p><p>His entire body relaxes, until he notices there’s another person there.</p><p>“Oh god.” He says, because of course, it’s the omega from breakfast who’s found his dog brother for him.</p><p>Percy gulps down a lungful of air, feeling like his upper back and mid thighs are killing him.</p><p>“Thank you so much, I can’t tell you how glad I am to see him. You’re okay, thank god.” He gets out in a rush, the latter bit directed to the dog himself and the younger man looks at him kindly, rising from his knees where he’d been petting and apparently speaking softly to Jason, who doesn’t appear distressed.</p><p>The omega finishes brushing off his hands on his pant legs, before reaching out to Percy.</p><p>“You’re welcome. I noticed you earlier, and thought I’d come say hello. The next time I looked over you were gone. I was afraid I’d have to wait till lunch to see you again, but then this little guy ran past me and I knew you wouldn’t be far behind.”</p><p>Percy frowns, staring at the hand hovering in front of him, with elegant long fingers, perfectly manicured nails, and he swallows.</p><p>“You wanted to meet me?” Percy’s own voice sounds as disbelieving as he feels.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Credence can hardly believe his luck, the handsome man with the gentle eyes behind thick rimmed glasses that was adorably eating his toast with one hand, while drinking coffee in the other, he couldn’t help it, shyly watching who he suspected to be the nicest looking Alpha in the whole building, turns out to be the owner of the friendly dog he accidentally ran into. Now that he’s closer, Credence is sure of it. This is an Alpha.</p><p>He smells like fresh air, pine needles and smokey woods with a dark undercurrent of cherries and burnt toast.</p><p>Credence is grateful to be on suppressants or he’d already be wetting himself in automatic submission.</p><p><em> This </em> is the Alpha he wants to be courted by, he decides in that moment.</p><p>Credence licks his lips before he can stop himself, noting how the man follows the movement with his dark eyes, and then finally, the Alpha takes his hand, shakes it once, then squeezes firmly.</p><p>A soft whimper tries to sneak out his throat, but Credence chokes it down, attempting to maintain his cool facade. “I’m Credence.” He doesn’t really want to let go of the man’s hand, and he can feel a calloused thumb rubbing across his knuckles, before slowly relaxing under his fingers. “Pleasure to meet you, I’m Percy.”</p><p>As they make their way back to the building, Percy tells him about himself, being polite and ensuring to ask Credence a few questions here and there, which he appreciates.</p><p>Beautiful omegas may be required to be seen and not heard, but Percy doesn’t follow those guidelines.</p><p>“Are you enjoying your living space?” He hears, interrupting his line of thought, and Credence smiles, a bit shakily.</p><p>“I’m sharing with another omega, because we won’t possibly interbreed, and it’s a little crowded. He has six former friends who are animals. He watches over all of them, and hopes to find an Alpha who doesn’t mind his little menagerie. He brings a lot to the table.” Credence laughs weakly, but Percy frowns, mildly concerned.</p><p>“They <em> told </em> you this? That omegas cannot possibly be mated with one another? That’s so barbaric. What if I were to meet an Alpha who I fell in love with? Isn’t that all they need? A mated pair? So what if they’re a matched set… or not perfectly in line with what the Company considers an ideal match?”</p><p>Credence doesn’t know where the sudden spear of jealousy comes from, but it makes it very difficult to breathe for a moment. Percy is just speaking generally, of course.</p><p>“Well, I think they want people who will be able to procreate.” Credence says, trying to remain diplomatic.</p><p>Percy still looks disturbed at the strictness of the facilities guidelines, but they’ve arrived back to the building now, so all critical talk must be hushed.</p><p>The dog, whom he learns is named Jason after Percy’s brother who died, begins whining at them, eager to go in and have something to eat and drink. Credence feels much the same, having gotten more sun that afternoon than in his entire lifetime. His pale skin is meant to be appealing to Alphas.<br/>
It helps cultivate his fragile, doll like aesthetic.</p><p>He secretly thinks it’s bullshit, but it <em> does </em> mean his lingerie stands out on his body extra well, especially the black silk and navy lace, along with crimson or emerald.</p><p>Credence wonders how Percy would feel about him wearing lingerie. Would he like it? Or love it?</p><p>Could he find it distasteful?</p><p>He knows very well that some omegas can get off on that, the whole being talked down to and degraded by their mates while being knotted repeatedly schtick, but he isn’t sure he is one of them, much less if he would like it. Unless Percy touched him very sweetly while talking dirty, and mildly mean, perhaps.</p><p>He bites his lip as Percy says good afternoon, telling Credence to look for him at dinner sometime, but that he must go lie down now, as his old age, and his back pain are making things difficult.</p><p>“I will.” He promises earnestly, catching the hint of a smile Percy tries to hide.</p><p>Credence has met many Alphas before, quite a few with ulterior motives, which he had learned to spot early on<br/>
For his own survival, rejecting all of their suits. It’s how he ended up here, in the first place. But with Percy?</p><p>He’s never felt this way with anyone before, this heady sense of safety and comfort, yet after a while Credence finds himself hungering for something more.</p><p> </p><p>The next morning when Credence goes down to breakfast, leaving Newt behind in a foggy bathroom as he runs a super hot bath, not for himself, but his two dogs and three rabbits, he finds Percy at a table all alone, again.</p><p>He walks over and tries to hide his smile, unsuccessfully. “Hi there. Would you mind terribly if I joined you?”</p><p>Percy blinks up at him in a manner he can only describe as painfully shy, yet impossibly sweet. “Are you sure?”</p><p>The Alpha seems to be asking because Credence senses and smells two other Alphas in the dining room.</p><p>For once, they aren’t among the first customers. He swallows, then shrugs. “Yeah, pretty damned.”</p><p>Percy gestures across from himself, looking a touch cheerier. “Please do.”</p><p>Credence sits down and orders a coffee and scone, as before, from the waiter who approaches the second his ass hits the seat. When he looks over to Percy again, midway through sipping his own coffee, he notices a muffin crumb in the man’s mustache.</p><p>Credence reaches out, unthinking, not even bothering to ask, gently wiping it away and then bring his finger back to his own mouth, biting the tip and gazing at Percy in what he hopes is an alluring manner.</p><p>Caring for his Alpha. That’s all he’s doing. “What… was that for?”</p><p>Percy sounds so confused even as he looks adorable and lost.</p><p>Credence smirks. “There was a smidge of bran flake on your upper lip.”</p><p>“Oh… thank you. You saved me.” Credence’s smirk softens, “From what?”</p><p>Percy sounds as if he’s in pain. “From embarrassment of course.” Credence’s heart aches for the Alpha.</p><p>If it wasn’t obvious from the start, he’s clearly got some self confidence issues, and there’s really only one way to fix that, by continuing to show his interest. He’s got to prove to Percy that he can be a good mate for someone, in all the ways that count, beyond the surface ones and lazy stereotypes.</p>
