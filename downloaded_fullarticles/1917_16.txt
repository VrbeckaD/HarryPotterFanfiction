    <p>The sheer lack of information about Voldemort’s return was worrisome.  A captain, and tactical man at heart, Davenport felt most confident when he held all the cards-- or, at the very least, when he held enough good ones that he was sure he could fake himself the others.</p><p>But yes, Voldemort had returned last year at the end of the Triwizard (or perhaps more appropriately named Quadwizard) Tournament, after murdering Cedric Diggory.  Immediately afterwards, Mad-Eye Moody had become twitchier, dementors had descended upon Hogwarts once again-- and yet the Minister of Magic, a man for whom Davenport held a fair amount of dislike, Cornelius Fudge-- remained absolutely in denial that the Dark Lord had returned.</p><p>All that the newspapers and the Ministry of Magic were willing to acknowledge was <em> Harry.   </em>And even though he was the Triwizard Champion, Davenport couldn’t help but notice that they had only criticism for the boy.</p><p>Which meant that the Ministry was setting themselves up to be against him.</p><p>Where they fell in the light-versus-dark conflict that was brewing, well-- Davenport liked to hope that they would remain a neutral ground.  But although he didn’t voice his worries to his crew, he wasn’t so sure. Governments were so easily corrupted, after all.</p><p>Over the summer, the inhabitants of the Starblaster lay low.  Taako spent a good month visiting with the Malfoy family and making connections among the high and mighty of the purebloods.  Lucretia often visited with Daphne Greengrass and her family, quietly meeting the rich and famous. Even Merle spent time with the Diggorys and Macmillans, somehow managing to make friends among the biggest supporters of Dumbledore.</p><p>Even Lup and Magnus played Quidditch with the Weasleys, and Barry and Luna Lovegood apparently were working on combining “muggle” technologies with magic--</p><p>All of his crew, all of his <em> family </em>, were out there walking the walk and talking the talk.  They were making friends in this cycle, getting connections, playing nice with the powerful.</p><p>Gods, Davenport hated politics.</p><p>It was all about money and family and stature.  You could be the most skilled artist in the world, for example, and still be passed up for a painter with abysmal skills and a rich bank account.</p><p>And Davenport had never had any of those benefits.  Even in the “merit-based” IPRE, he’d had to fight tooth and nail to even get his pilot training, to become a captain.  In the end, he’d given it everything he had to be <em> the </em> captain.   <em> This </em>captain.</p><p>The one at the forefront of adventure and exploration.  The one who would discover the planes and the people.</p><p>And he’d made it!  He was here.</p><p>But somehow, the power struggles and politics of the rich hadn’t been left behind when Tosun V was destroyed by the Hunger.  If anything was constant among all the planes he’d been to, it was this. When there was sentient life, there was somebody in power, and there was somebody trying to wrest that power away from them.</p><p>Davenport really, really hated politics.</p><p>But he cared more about the plane than the politicians.  Which meant that Davenport was fancied up in dress robes (red, of course) with his wand sheathed at his belt, hair neatly brushed, looking every inch the rich pureblood wizard from America that he was pretending to be.</p><p>He sighed under his breath, and shifted a little, staring up at the ceiling.  He was attending as Taako’s plus one, which was a pretty weird dynamic altogether.  But even stranger was the party that he was attending.</p><p>Davenport knew that every other person there was a supporter of Voldemort.  Because Lucretia was with No Man’s Land, and Lup and Magnus had too many close ties in Gryffindor to play the villain, and because Merle had been aligned with Cedric last year--</p><p>And Barry couldn’t act to save his life, plus he was very obviously dating Lup--</p><p>Well, Davenport was the only one left who was still fairly unaligned.  Although, if this-- party? Gathering? Gala?-- went as planned, it looked like Davenport would find himself falling in with the dark side, as it were.</p><p>The Goyle Manse was large and spreading.  Davenport had almost expected a dark and dreary castle, with human skulls on the walls and large primitive flagons of drink.  He <em> hadn’t </em>expected a garden, strangely beautiful, with the stars pinwheeling above them.</p><p>“Oh, Davenport!” somebody said, and he turned, straightening his back automatically.</p><p>Up ran Daphne Greengrass.  “I’m so glad you could make it!  I didn’t know you would be here!”</p><p>She wore dark green dress robes, hair pinned up around her head.  Everything about this version of Daphne screamed <em> old money </em> and <em> pureblood </em>.  It was only through Lucretia that he knew her to be in No Man’s Land-- without that, he never would have guessed that her loyalties did not lie with the dark.</p><p>“I’m here as Taako’s plus one,” he explained, falling into step next to Daphne.  The two of them began to walk slowly around the garden, carefully steering out of the way of the adult partygoers.  As they passed the adults-- the actual Death Eaters and their supporters-- they went silent. Davenport figured that although he and Daphne were supporting them, that didn’t mean they got to know everything.</p><p>Which was unfortunate, because he’d probably have to go to <em> more </em>of these events.</p><p>“I didn’t realize the two of you were together,” Daphne said carefully.</p><p>“Oh, we’re not,” Davenport said quickly.  “We’ve just been friends for a very long time.  He thought I’d enjoy the company here and the, ah... political preferences.”</p><p>The Slytherin girl nodded slowly.  Davenport could almost see her thoughts-- ‘he’s a Death Eater supporter, I can’t get too close--’ after all, Daphne had no idea that <em> Davenport </em>knew she was part of No Man’s Land.  Had no idea that he was as undercover as she was.</p><p>“Well,” Daphne said firmly.  “It’s a good thing you’re not together.  Blaise is just <em> horrible </em>after a breakup.”</p><p>“Boys,” Davenport said, shaking his head a little with a smile.</p><p>Daphne smiled back.  “Yet who can fault them when they’re that handsome?”</p><p>Davenport was almost one hundred percent sure that Daphne was gay.  And he <em> was </em> one hundred percent sure that <em> he </em>was gay.</p><p>So what was Daphne doing?</p><p>“Have you tried the eclairs?” she asked.  They wound past a row of bushes trimmed into fantastical animal shapes and towards the tables laden with desserts.  “They’re simply marvelous. Lord Goyle truly outdid himself for this gala.”</p><p>“Indeed,” Davenport agreed.  Somewhere across the garden, somebody was laughing, high and loud.  “It’s been a wonderful night.”</p><p>“And... you would enjoy doing this sort of thing again?” she asked.</p><p>In for a copper piece, in for a gold.</p><p>“I would,” Davenport lied.</p><p>“Well, then,” said Daphne.  “I’ll have to talk to Mother about seeing that you’re invited!  I know most of us kids here, at least, are in Slytherin, but we do enjoy having Ravenclaws here.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Davenport said, and scanned the garden for Taako.  He hoped that their mission-- get both of them further entrenched with the Death Eaters-- had been successful.  All he wanted now was to go back to the Starblaster, see Merle, and get the gel out of his hair.</p><p>It’d been a very long night.</p><p>---</p><p>“So how’d it go, Dadn’port?” asked Lup when he trudged up the gangplank, yawning.  “Make friends? Influence people?”</p><p>“Well, hopefully,” Davenport said.  “I didn’t talk much to the adults, but I spent quite a bit of time with Daphne.”</p><p>“Greengrass?”</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Lup nodded right back.  “Cool. She’s not, like, the worst of the Slytherins though.  What about the others?”</p><p>He shrugged.  “Small talk with Draco, talked Quidditch with Vincent and Greg--”</p><p>“<em> Vincent </em> and <em> Greg </em> ?!  What, are they calling you <em> Drew </em>now?”</p><p>“Unfortunately.”</p><p>Lup cackled.  “Gotta hand it to you, Dadn’port, you’re all in on this.”</p><p>“Next time <em> you’re </em>infiltrating the enemy,” he told her.  “I had to talk so much shit I probably stink.”</p><p>She stuck her tongue out at him.  “C’mon, after all the times you tell us off, it couldn’t be that hard, could it?  It’s just pretending.”</p><p>“I don't like pretending.  Or politics.”</p><p>“Big worm.”</p><p>“...what?”</p><p>“Don’t worry ‘bout it.  Hey, where’s Koko?”</p><p>“He’s a lot better at talking to adults than I am--”</p><p>“<em> Bull </em>shit!  You’re Captain Goddamn Davenport, you know all about talking to adults!”</p><p>He sighed.  “I know all about talking to adults when <em> I </em>am also an adult.  And even that isn’t my best, er, area.  When you’re a kid, they listen to you even less than when you’re a gnome.”</p><p>“So you’re making Taako-- who is <em> also </em> a kid-- talk to them?  C’mon, Capn’port, you’re the <em> Captain </em>.  You’re the one we want making the adult decisions, not my baby brother.”</p><p>“I heard that!” Taako shouted, climbing up the gangplank.  “I’m older, thank you very much!”</p><p>“No, you’re not!” Lup retorted.</p><p>“Am too!”</p><p>“Stop!” Davenport said sharply.  Both the twins stopped and looked at him.</p><p>“See?” asked Lup, smiling.  “There he is?”</p><p>“Dadn’port?” Taako said.  “He’s been there the whole time.  You high, Lulu?”</p><p>“No, fuck off,” she said.  “<em> There’s </em> the Captain Davenport I’ve been tellin’ him about.  Listen. Dadn’port. You just gotta go up to those adults and <em> pretend </em>you’re an adult too!  That’s what we did!”</p><p>“Next time you’re infiltrating,” he muttered, and stepped around Lup.  A soft bed sounded really fucking good right now.</p><p>---</p><p>Fifth year approached like a summer rainstorm.  June passed in a blur-- July trickled by slowly-- and August picked up speed until they were in Diagon Alley, buying supplies.  And then before Davenport knew it, he was dropping off the rest of his crew at Platform 9 3/4, and flying the Starblaster to it’s warded copse of trees in the Forbidden Forest.</p><p>This year, Davenport walked through the forest all alone.  His footsteps crunched along through the dry underbrush, and he ignored the occasional creaks and moans coming from the deeper woods.</p><p>He’d never taken Care of Magical Creatures-- flora and fauna was always Merle and Magnus’s specialities-- but as he hiked alone back to the castle, Davenport wondered if he ought to have taken the class.</p><p>But he arrived at the edge of the forest without incident.</p><p>No problem, then.</p><p>He could live with that, though.  It was all about the illusions: he had no problem pretending to be something he wasn’t, as long as he remembered what was real underneath.</p><p>---</p><p>Davenport fell into step with the rest of Hogwarts’ students as they clambered out of the thestral-drawn carriages and up the steps to the sprawling castle.  It was nice to be back. This was the longest the crew of the Starblaster had been on one plane since they’d left Tosun V almost seventy years ago. Seventy-five years, counting their extra time on the plane of magic?</p><p>Well.  They’d spent five years on this plane, and although he hated to become attached to anything that wouldn’t reset when their time was done, Davenport couldn’t help but be... fond of the place.</p><p>He slid onto an empty space on the Ravenclaw bench next to Lucretia.  The Prefect badge on her chest sparkled, and he was almost glad he hadn’t been given one like she and Barry had.  Long gone were the days when he wished for more petty responsibilities. After all, Davenport was in the business of saving the known universe.  And although he loved being in control of himself and his crew, by proxy-- well, he wasn’t eager to patrol the halls and tell off troublemakers.</p><p>Lucretia would probably have fun with the extra authority, though.  He was absolutely certain that she’d find a creative way to twist her prefect duties into something a little more... useful.</p><p>Lucretia smiled at him, distracted, and then turned her attention back up to the staff table.</p><p>Davenport followed her gaze, tilting his chin up to try and see over some of the taller students.  He’d hit his full gnomish height over the summer, and although he was sure Professor McGonagall would be willing to transfigure him taller (like she’d hid Taako and Lup’s ears) he didn’t want to go that far.  He’d spent years on Tosun V literally wishing to be bigger, but petty worries like height got tossed out the window when the apocalypse came.</p><p>“Who is <em> that </em>?” he hissed as the first years tramped in.  A pudgy woman sat next to Professor Flitwick, looking distinctly toad-like in bright pink.  A large (pink) bow sat nestled atop her head.</p><p>Lucretia’s face was grim.  “I already asked Flitwick. <em> That </em>would be Professor Umbridge.  She is our new DADA professor.”</p><p>“She looks...” Davenport swallowed his next words.  He really should’ve learned to not judge people by this point, but... still.  Something about her was distinctly unpleasant, and Davenport was a pilot. He flew on instinct alone half the time.</p><p>“She was sent to us by the <em> Ministry </em>,” Lucretia said, painfully polite.  “Because Dumbledore couldn’t find a replacement DADA teacher who wasn’t actually Voldemort and/or connected to him in some dastardly way.”</p><p>“In fairness, Lupin--”</p><p>“Yeah, Lupin was great.  But, well...”</p><p>Her next words were cut off as the Sorting Hat begun to sing.  It went forward as always. Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff.  Four houses, founders, Hogwarts.</p><p>But the ending was... different than any of the songs Davenport had heard it sing before.</p><p>
  <em> “Still I wonder whether sorting </em>
</p><p>
  <em> May not bring the end I fear. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Oh, know the perils, read the signs, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The warning history shows, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> For our Hogwarts in in danger </em>
</p><p>
  <em> From external, deadly foes. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> And we must unite inside her </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Or we’ll crumble from within </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I have told you, I have warned you... </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Let the Sorting now begin.” </em>
</p><p>“Foreshadowing,” Lucretia murmured.</p><p>Other murmurs filled the Great Hall, and Davenport felt a cold chill grow through his two gnomish hearts.  The Sorting Hat itself-- created by the founders <em> them </em>selves-- had just warned the entire school about dividing.  Telling them that if they split Hogwarts at its seams, then they would fall altogether.</p><p>A horrible prediction, especially for the situation.</p><p>Davenport looked up at the teacher’s table, at toadlike Umbridge.  They were told not to split the school, but the Sorting Hat’s warning came too late.  Years and years too late.</p><p>Looking around the room, Davenport made eye contact with Daphne Greengrass, sitting prim and proper at the Slytherin table.  She nodded, ever so slightly, and looked away.</p><p>He desperately hoped that the hat was wrong: the dividing had already begun.</p><p>---</p><p>“Hem hem,” said Professor Umbridge, cutting off Dumbledore's opening remarks.  “Hem, hem. Now, isn’t it nice to see such happy, smiling faces before me!”</p><p>“What side is the Ministry on?” Davenport murmured to Lucretia, careful to remain attentive to Umbridge's little meandering speech, that said a lot but meant hardly anything.</p><p>“They don’t believe that Voldemort is back,” she scrawled onto her slightly-stained napkin with the pen she pulled from behind her ear.  “Because they’re ignoring it, they’re open to infiltration by Death Eaters and supporters. We have to assume that the Ministry is compromised.”</p><p>“Damn it,” Davenport sighed, still smiling up at Umbridge.  “So, since I’m following Taako into the metaphorical dark side, I should get on her good side?”</p><p>She nodded slowly.  “She’s not here because the Ministry actually wanted to help us,” she scribbled.  “She’s here to keep an eye on Hogwarts. The Ministry is going to interfere.”</p><p>“And that means I get to help them do so?”</p><p>“Unfortunately.”</p><p>“Next cycle,” he muttered, “We are spending a solid <em> week </em>in a spa.”</p><p>Lucretia smiled and pulled out her wand.  With a muttered “<em> Incendio </em>!” her napkin burst into flame.  Waiting half a second to make sure the potentially dangerous words were burnt to ash, Davenport casually tipped his water glass over, smothering over the fires.</p><p>Well, then.</p><p>In for a copper piece, in for a gold.</p><p> </p>
