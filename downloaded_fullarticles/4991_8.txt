    <p>In all honesty, Harry knew he shouldn't have been surprised. </p><p>Even though there was a small percentage of people inheriting such a thing, he should have known. </p><p>And now here he was, standing in front of the mirror in the bathroom the day before he left for his seventh year at Hogwarts. </p><p>Harry stared at his reflection. He looked between the small potion-vial in his hand to the new additions his body adorned. Around his biceps, wrists and ankles were two-inch thick gold bands. They made his dark skin looked flawless against the color, and even though any other time he would think they were a nice addition to his body, recently he read something that made his stomach clench and flip uncomfortably. </p><p>And then there was the fact he wasn't wearing his normal pajama pants he wore to sleep, those disappeared or were transformed into sheer green harem pants that hid nothing at all, and his glasses gone. Harry realized then he didn't need his glasses anymore. And his hair. </p><p>He was used to his unruly hair, he was actually fond of how unmanageable it is, but he never imagined having so much hair. His dark raven hair was thick and long, long enough to brush the top of his tail bone, and it wasn't quite considered curly, but it wasn't just wavy. It was somewhere in between. </p><p>He had laughed with Ron in their dorm last year when Malfoy walked into the Great Hall at dinner the week before school ended for the year. He was apparently early to present with his creature inheritance since his 17th birthday was a week away. Draco walked into the Great Hall that day with suddenly pointed ears and skin even paler than before, and his eyes were so vividly blue, they seemed to glow. Later, after Ron and Harry had their fit of laughter at how dainty the Slytherin Prince looked now, Hermione came crashing into their dorm to inform them that Malfoy was an elemental. </p><p>She went on and on about what this meant, and though Ron zoned out, Harry was much more interested than he would like to admit. With the fact that this inheritance could have been the reason why Draco ended up helping him and the light side back in his fourth year when he defeated Voldemort. </p><p>"Harry? Are you up yet?" He heard Sirius call, and footsteps that indicated that he was just down the hall. </p><p>Though he had a pretty good idea what creature inheritance he had been gifted, asking his godfather for confirmation would probably be best. Harry knew he could trust his godfather, right? </p><p>Slowly, Harry opened the bathroom door as he heard Sirius pass the door towards his bedroom. </p><p>"Oh there you are, I thought I heard you up." Harry could hear the smile in his voice before he saw it, "you're up earlier than normal." </p><p>"Uh," Harry started, waiting for Sirius to pop up in the doorframe, it didn't take long, "I woke up to a surprise..." </p><p>"What sur-- Oh, well this is certainly new." Sirius said as his eyes landed on Harry's new jewelry and pants that should rather be classified as lingerie.</p><p>He didn't know what to expect of Sirius's reaction to this all, even after living with him for almost three years. </p><p>There wasn't a negative reaction since a small smile formed on his lips, "This is quite the surprise," He mused, "I must say, you are probably the only one in the Potter lineage to be gifted genie inheritance." </p><p>"What does this mean then?" </p><p>"It means you're life is going to change once again." Sirius sighed. </p><p>Harry looked back at his reflection, "It's not like that's any different now," He mumbled and ran a hand through his hair and flipped it over his shoulder, "I was granted two years that were mostly normal, I guess I'm maxed out now." Harry added slightly bitter. </p><p>"Remus knows more about creature inheritance than I do, so I would ask him once you get to school tomorrow, or at least as soon as you can. I can tell you what I know so you can keep yourself safe before you can speak with him." Sirius turned to leave the bathroom, but remembered something, "You should change first." And walked out. </p><p>Harry blushed and instinctually covered his groin, quickly shutting the door after Sirius. </p><p>He grabbed at the sheer pants and tried to pull them off, but his hands slipping through the fabric as if it wasn't even there. Then he remembered his clothes vanished and nowhere in sight. </p><p>With a sigh, Harry left the bathroom and rushed down the hall to his bedroom to grab a random pair of jeans and tee. He knew the harem pants were no use, so he just pulled his jeans on over them, surprised to see them disappear as soon as the jeans were secured on his hips. But the gold bands on his arms and ankles refused to disappear. </p><p>Harry put on his tee as he walked to the Library where he knew Sirius would be waiting for him. </p><p>-- </p><p>"How many bands do you hand in total?" Sirius asked as he flipped through the book he just took off one of the shelves. Harry was sitting on the sofa obediently, sipping on the tea that was provided. </p><p>"Six." </p><p>Sirius hummed at his answer, languidly trailing through the pages of text, "Six," He repeated and paused as he stopped on a page, "That may be a good or bad thing." </p><p>"How so?" Harry piped, not liking the tone his godfather was using. </p><p>Sirius looked over at Harry, a pang of guilt slicing through him at how helpless the boy looked at the moment, "This book thoroughly explains the differences between the different types of creature inheritance. Whether it be something common like elvish or certain elementals, and it talks about the more rarer inheritance, like genies." Harry looked uncomfortable at the word. </p><p>"What does it say?" </p><p>"Not much, but Remus can probably fill you in on what this book doesn't tell you." Sirius sat down beside Harry, "Apparently there are three tiers of genie; the lowest, being the least powerful have one set of bands, the middle have two sets of bands and are the most common of the three types, and the highest tier have three sets of bands and are the most powerful. You fit into the highest tier as you can infer." He stopped to let the information sink in and only started talking again when Harry nodded slowly, "The highest tier has more power and therefore more rules pertaining to the power. A wizard inheriting such genie power is powerful him- or her- self, as you are Harry. You will find new strength in your wizarding abilities, and there won't be any limit on what you can learn from the added power." </p><p>"Wait, what?" Harry asked, he was trying to read over Sirius's shoulder as he spoke, but all the words jumbled before his eyes as he got more nervous with every word. </p><p>"In simpler terms, it means learning new charms or spells, probably even potions, you will no longer have any problem with them as long as your head is clear and in the right place." Harry nodded, "But your genie power doesn't work that way." </p><p>"Ok, just uh, talk slow. This is all really weird." Harry mumbled, rubbing his arm self-consciously. </p><p>Sirius smiled in understanding, "Not a problem Harry. Anyways, like I was saying- rules and limits. As a high-tier genie your power will be quite something, but tricky. There are the basic things you can't do, such as; you can't kill anyone, you can't bring anyone back from the dead, you can't make anyone love any other person, but lust is ok. If you ever get a master, you will need to tell them these basic things-" </p><p>"What?! A master? What the bloody fucking hell-" </p><p>"Language." </p><p>"What the heck does that mean?!" Harry said in an embarrassingly high squeak from his surprise. </p><p>Sirius sighed, "I know this is a lot of information to take in all at once, but one thing at a time. I will explain that as we go, understand?" </p><p>"Yessir," Harry mumbled, before adding sassily, "I am of age by the way, I can curse all I want." </p><p>Sirius's lips quirked up at the lip he was receiving, "Not as long as I allow you under my roof, no lip boy." Harry's mouth snapped shut as he nodded, "Good, now back to the limits. You will not be able to access your genie powers without a master, but that shouldn't hinder to anything else. But-" Sirius coughed, seemingly in an uncomfortable manner, "Once- or if you get a master, the genie magic will need to be regularly replenished. How this happens is through sexual stimulation." </p><p>"What?!" Harry squawked again, flushing an alarming shade of red as he shrank back into the sofa. </p><p>"The magic feeds off of another witch or wizards magical energy that is leaked through sexual acts. Everyone witch and wizard naturally has a magical energy or aura around them, but it is nothing compared to how strong it can get during sex or other sexual acts." Sirius explained, much less uncomfortable after admitting this to his godson. </p><p>"I can't possibly do such a thing!" Harry protested. </p><p>"Books don't lie." Sirius stated, "With you being a powerful wizard and now genie, it is all logical that you'll need a powerful witch or wizard to feed you." </p><p>"You sound like Remus." Harry commented offhandedly, "But still, I can't do that." </p><p>"Let me explain the rest of what it says here, even if it isn't much, and then I'll try to answer any other questions you have." Harry reluctantly nodded, "Good, now it doesn't say much about master-genie relationships, but what it does say is that your 'bottle' will allow itself to be taken by any compatible witch or wizard, regardless of their magical core being as powerful as yours, but you would want a more powerful master for your own benefit. But, the only thing that your bottle will be picky about in your favor is your master being sexually compatible." </p><p>Harry put his face in his hands as Sirius spoke in utter mortification, as well in hope to cool his fiery blush. Of course, he wouldn't ever have a break to live a normal life. </p><p>"Is getting a master unavoidable?" Harry asked in a meek voice. </p><p>There was a pause, "...More or less. I'm sure Remus will have a more informational answer." Sirius stopped himself, feeling as if there were more to Harry's words than he let on, "Why do you ask?" </p><p>"Because if you say they have to be, erm, sexual compatible then um, I have to tell you something." Harry avoided looking at his godfather, there was a sliver of doubt in his mind that it would end badly, "My hypothetical master will probably be a, erm, wizard." </p><p>Sirius stared at his godson, eyebrows furrowed as he still refused to look up, "Is this some fancy way to finally admit to me that you're gay Harry?" </p><p>Said wizard finally looked up at his godfather with a face redder than ever before, "Uh, yeah?" </p><p>Harry was surprised, to say the least. </p><p>Sirius beamed and slapped a hard hand on his back, "I was waiting for when you would finally tell me! I'm happy for you and wholly support you Harry, remember that." </p><p>"Wait, you knew?!" He gasped. </p><p>Sirius smirked, "Of course, I'm your godfather after all." </p><p>"Since when? I haven't even told Remus or-or Ron or Hermione." </p><p>"I was finally found innocent just before the tournament, remember? Your fourth year," Harry nodded, "Since then." </p><p>"How-what, I'm so embarrassed," Harry dropped his head back into his hands, "Does that mean I'm more obvious than I think?" </p><p>"Obvious to everyone around you who knew you well enough, but you were oblivious to yourself." Sirius rubbed a hand soothingly across Harry's back, "It was rather cute if you ask me, the way your eyes lit up whenever you were around Charlie or Cedric," Harry was blushing again, or rather he never stopped, "You were so easily dazzled by those two. When did you realize you were gay?" </p><p>Harry looked up miserably, he knew what Sirius was talking about. He thought Charlie was the coolest person ever, and Cedric, he was just so charming and good-looking, and just everything he wanted to be at the time. </p><p>"I realized when I desperately wanted Cedric to ask me to the Yule ball instead of Cho..." Harry muttered embarrassingly, "Who else knows?" </p><p>"Well Remus," Harry nodded, "And your little friend Hermione talked to me about it when you wouldn't leave Charlie alone one day." Harry groaned, "You'll tell them soon I hope." </p><p>"I was planning to tell them before Christmas as a goal for myself," Harry stated, "But since Hermione knows, I might as well just tell them tomorrow since it won't be as bad as I thought." </p><p>"Good, I'm glad you told me, and I'm glad you're going to tell them." Sirius nodded and changed the subject, "I will refer to specifically wizards than on your behalf. There isn't anything else in the book about genies and their masters or how a genie of your tier gets a master, other than that compatibility, you should try to speak with Remus as soon as you can." </p><p>Harry nodded, "I will try to catch him after the opening ceremony tomorrow." Harry stood, "I'm going to go take a walk." </p><p>"Only if you have everything packed for tomorrow." Sirius chided. </p><p>The raven-haired wizard smiled, "You made sure I was yesterday, so yes everything is packed and ready." </p><p>"Good. You look good with long hair by the way." Sirius commented, making a small smile quirk up on Harry's lips. </p><p>"Thank you." With a nod, he went back to his room to grab a sweater and his shoes and slipped out of the house to take a breather. </p><p>It was going to be a long school year.</p>
