    <p>Choking cinders and flashing flames, effervescent embers and ineffable infernos. A deep, burgundy red haze within the sky, bared feet buried in shallow pools of liquid, black like coal.</p>
<p>The gritty feel buries in between the toes and scrapes, an irritant, but not enough to detract. The pain is ever growing around, burrowing into the skin. Digging deep and pulling up and away, barbed hooks of guilt and distilled agony never before conceived.</p>
<p>And yet, here it is.</p>
<p>A groan of protest emerges from parched lips, harsh and rasping. The pain barely recedes with the sound, only to return with a vengeance.</p>
<p>A hiss of true pain slides free of gritted teeth, slipping through like melted butter and spilling down, slow and viscous like molasses.</p>
<p>Booming sound awakens ears that have not heard in, well, any time in this universe.</p>
<p>“<em> We need your help. </em>” The sound whispers, defeated and broken.</p>
<p>Eyes roll in exasperation.</p>
<p>“<b>This will be a true challenge this time, at least for your mortal form.</b>” Another voice rumbles.</p>
<p>A brow lifts in idle curiosity.</p>
<p>“<em> It will require all of your guile…” </em></p>
<p><em> “ </em> <b> <em>All of your charisma…”</em> </b> A third voice presses.</p>
<p><b> <em>“</em> </b> <b>All of your bloodlust…”</b></p>
<p>
  <em> “All of your truth… </em>
</p>
<p>
  <b> <em>“All of your loving heart…”</em> </b>
</p>
<p>The voices boom in unison, crackling with vibrance.</p>
<p>“<b>All of your power!”</b></p>
<p>Eyes open, each a golden-blue blinding nimbus that ignite like supernovas.</p>
<p>The mouth opens into a tiny smirk, of anticipation, thirst and interest.</p>
<p>“<b> <em>Very well, my children.</em> </b>” The mouth says, softly.</p>
<p>The universe rends in twain.</p>
