    <p>Christmas, if Teddy was being honest, was entirely too cheerful. Yes, he understood that for most people it was a religious holiday to celebrate the birth of Jesus and all, but he could do without the lights and the music and the jolly good atmosphere. It never really matched with his own feelings on the happy holiday, and he was pretty sure he was the only one who felt this way.</p><p>There was also the fact that the Christmas season often made his favorite café filled to the brim when it usually was sparse of any people, and he had to abandon it in favor of the student common room, which was always less than negative three degrees on any given day, even if it was in the dead of winter.</p><p>Maybe he just hated Christmas.</p><p>Slumping down in the chair seated in the secluded corner of Espresso Patronum, he glumly wondered whether this was what he’d be subjected to every Christmas season.</p><p>Grimacing, Teddy thought he’d rather die.</p><p>It was just that… his Auntie was just incredibly angering, and he really didn’t know what to do about all the pent up frustration inside of him.</p><p>Staring at the blank black screen of his phone, he, not for the first time, wished that this wasn’t his life.</p><p>He wished many a time that he didn’t have to deal with his Auntie, who was much too insistent on him coming home for Christmas even when he had come home to see her multiple times previously per her request.</p><p>Teddy thought frankly if he didn’t come home for a holiday that they didn’t celebrate for just one time, it didn’t matter. He’d spent many miserable Christmases with his tiny family of three, and he has had enough of them. Missing one holiday wouldn’t make a difference.</p><p>This time around, his Auntie had guilt-tripped—though not in her usual obvious way—trying to convince him that he was a horrible nephew for not visiting, and that he was abandoning his sister. She was trying to take the high-road, but what was the difference if both the high-road and low-road were down in hell?</p><p>For fuck’s sake. Hope could take care of herself.</p><p>Teddy didn’t understand the 'abandoning her' part either; he’d been taking care of her for the majority of his life—his sister could afford his absence for a few days, if he did his job right. And he did, even if he fucked up a few times. There was no doubt about that, at all.</p><p>He just wanted a few weeks of being by himself, or maybe just hanging out with his friends. That was all he wanted. Christmases at home were decidedly <em>not</em> that, because his Auntie preferred him in the home, where she could see him.</p><p>He’d just about reached the end of his rope with his Auntie, and one of these days he was going to do something incredibly stupid if he didn’t calm down and stop himself.</p><p>Hope had made the situation worse, taking the time to personally call to tell him that he was being unreasonable, that Auntie gave him much freedom at home too, and the fact that he was asking for time away came off as being ungrateful.</p><p>Teddy had scowled, replying, “I don’t know how you can defend her when you know exactly the sort of shit she pulls! Stop fucking making excuses for her and open your eyes; I owe fucking <em>nothing</em> to her, and it’s about time you learned that too. It’s just one Christmas, she can deal with herself,” and then ended the call abruptly, seething too much to see reason.</p><p>In retrospect, that was probably a bad idea, and he’d certainly be paying for that, one way or another.</p><p>Teddy slid down his chair, involuntarily releasing a sigh. He swept over the interior of the café, noting distastefully that the holiday rush was increasing. At this time, the customers always did get a bit more cross and a bit higher strung, and sometimes (most of the time) spilled over to the actual occupants of the café. Once, he’d been hassled for not giving up his table. The table that he’d been sitting in for hours before hand. The other person genuinely thought that they were entitled to his seat.</p><p>He probably would have given his table up if it weren’t for the fact of their nasty attitude and entitlement. Just for that, Teddy stayed at the table the whole day out of pure pettiness, even though that he had a test to study for, the materials of which were stored neatly away in his flat.</p><p>Completely and absolutely worth it. It was alright anyways; he’d gotten a straight 84 on it.</p><p>Snapping out of his reverie, Teddy gathered his things and tightened the scarf around his neck, adjusted his jacket, and walked into the frigid cold, dragon’s breath forming at his lips and swirling into the air.</p><p align="center">—</p><p>Teddy’s roommate was certainly something else, that was for sure.</p><p>When he’d first met Ellie Liu, he was immediately told that she was a people person, and that there’d certainly be a lot of people visiting their townhome.</p><p>He wasn’t an extrovert by any means, but he wasn’t awfully off-put about that; most of the time, he could get along with a lot of strangers, given that they were good at conversation and didn’t infringe on his own personal space.</p><p>Well, Victoire Delacour-Weasley didn’t break any of his rules, but sometimes she just made him feel like his body was eating him from the inside out with just the way she spoke about her family.</p><p>She’d told him that her sister loved to annoy her and pull pranks on her that often lead to one thing or another, and all he’d had to say about that was ‘<em>what the hell, I’d kill to have a relationship with my sister that regularly doesn’t include the other eroding my sense of self</em>’.</p><p>Yeah, so there was Teddy's saddening thought for the day.</p><p>Eventually though, he was able to find—not necessarily peace—a compromise that allowed him to have more patience with her, and told himself that she was only human.</p><p>Sometimes he did find it hard to empathize with others, yes, but he was working on that.</p><p>Victoire also made an appearance in his home many times a week, so he had to quickly get used to her presence anyways.</p><p>Today saw her coming to his home again, with the pretense of seeing Ellie.</p><p>So when she stayed even when Ellie wasn’t there, it confused him for a bit, but in the end was glad to have some company. Being home alone wasn't fun.</p><p>“Hello Victoire,” Teddy greeted as warmly as he could. He found it a bit hard to be polite when he was angry as fuck, but he could do with at least trying to be nice to one of the few people that bothered with him.</p><p>“Heya,” she greeted back cheerily, giving a cute wave. “Ellie here?”</p><p>Teddy shook his head, smiling sympathetically.</p><p>“Ah,” she said understandingly, but plopped herself on the couch anyways. “So, what’s up?”</p><p>He analyzed her for a second, and then shook his head slightly. “Not much,” he told her, and went into the kitchen. Popping his head out, he asked, “Want anything?”</p><p>“Would you have any of your Pocky?”</p><p>“Hey, now that’s mine,” Teddy chastised her, frowning.</p><p>“Please?” she asked sweetly with pout. God, it was like she spoke in pout all day, every day.</p><p>It was endearing occasionally, which happened to be the only reason why he was grabbing his last box from his family pack to give to her.</p><p>Yeah, that sounded about right.</p><p>He flung the last box to her, and then took a seat on the couch adjacent to the one she was on.</p><p>“So,” Teddy asked, “how are your classes?” He almost always began with this question because Victoire had a way with telling stories, and it was incredibly entertaining to listen to how she described her professors.</p><p>“Ugh,” Victoire groaned, flopping herself onto the couch. “God, it’s like my classes never stop with the bullshit. I can<em>not</em> believe that I have to take two more classes of Physics to get my fucking Information Systems degree.”</p><p>Teddy gave her a mix between a grimace and a smile, and half-heartedly wondered why she decided to concentrate in what she did if she hated the classes so much. Maybe she wanted a good job, maybe she wanted stability, or maybe she wanted to torture herself. Who knew?</p><p>“But,” she conceded, “today was nice. We pretty much played board games. There’s this game, called Photosynthesis? Anyways, whoever created it must’ve been a really creative bloke, the art’s really pretty and so is the game.”</p><p>“Games?” Teddy raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“Er, yeah,” Victoire laughed. “Today’s the last of classes, and our final was a practical project. So.” She gasped just then. “Today’s the last day of classes! Time really flies, huh? Except I had no fun at all.”</p><p>“At least its Christmas break now,” he tried to offer in some semblance of comfort.</p><p>“That’s true.” She smiled softly, seemingly thinking of something far away. “I’m going home for the holidays, and well, I know my family’s immensely annoying, but even I can’t deny that I’ve missed them these past few months.”</p><p>A tremor of envy rose in his chest, but he quashed it immediately. He’d made his decision today, and that was that. There was no point in regretting it now.</p><p>“I’m happy for you,” he said, and truly meant it. “Are you looking forward to anything?”</p><p>“Well,” she said, pausing to think for a moment. “My maman doesn’t often make Korean food a lot, but whenever I come home she always makes my favorite.”</p><p>“Which would be?” he prompted.</p><p>“Tteokbokki.” Victoire brightened, and he thought that her smile could light up the world if she so wanted. “It’s really good, and maman used to make it for me a lot when I was younger to make me feel better.”</p><p>Teddy nodded understandingly.</p><p>“Sorry for talking about myself—”</p><p>“It’s all good.”</p><p>Victoire flapped her hands dismissively and continued as if there was no interruption. “—but do you have any plans for the break?”</p><p>Teddy froze for a moment, and panicked as to how he should answer. Hell, he didn’t even know if this was something he should be telling people if he wanted to stay on the down low. Goddamn it. “Well…” Oh, fuck it. Nothing mattered anyways. “I’m not going home for the holidays. It’s gonna be me, myself, and I. Possibly Ellie as well, but there’s no telling with her.”</p><p>“Just… you?” Victoire’s tone was expressly aghast, seemingly making no attempt to hide it.</p><p>Teddy shrugged.</p><p>“But why?”</p><p>He knew that she was truly curious about the answer, but he wanted to snap back that not everyone had the perfect fucking family that she did, with all of her siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins.</p><p>But he didn’t.</p><p>He had to hold back rolling his eyes; he was annoyed, but he did not want to hurt Victoire in any way, shape, or form.</p><p>“I,” Teddy began, but then let out a deep sigh that was not entirely intentional. “My family is really small, but they're a lot to deal with on any given day. I decided to stay here for the time being. They—they’re not the <em>best</em> family, and a lot of the time my Auntie and my sister grate my nerves, we fight a lot, and…”</p><p>He wasn’t really sure whether he wanted add that they often fucked with his head a lot too and that he often didn’t know how to get out of the funk that it put him in. He was vocal to his closest friends about what happened on at home, but Victoire? She was different story. They were friends of some kind, but there was something really unfamiliar between the two of them, and until Teddy figured out what it was, it would likely stop him from sharing too much about himself. If she happened to be there when something happened, then he couldn’t help that.</p><p>There was no doubt this would also annoy him to no end.</p><p>Victoire grimaced, but otherwise looked highly sympathetic. “I’m sorry that your family makes you feel that way.”</p><p>Teddy nodded at her, not really taking in the words much. Sentiments such as these might have meant something to him when he was younger and more impressionable, but now, they only served to disappoint him.</p><p>Many people in his life had expressed these exact same feelings when he told them of what was going on at home, but it didn’t really translate into anything more. People say their part and then leave, doing nothing to help him out. Almost as if he was forgotten right after they got in their say so they didn’t have to feel bad anymore.</p><p>Teddy understood. He really did. Sometimes it just wasn’t possible to help someone out, or you couldn’t do the most, or whatever. But what were the chances of everyone he met not helping him?</p><p>At one point Teddy truly did believe that he wasn’t worth helping, angry and bitter as he was back then.</p><p>“Do you have anywhere to be now?” Teddy asked, steering the conversation elsewhere. He didn’t know if Victoire was uncomfortable, but he was, and that was all that mattered.</p><p>“I—no, not really.” Victoire didn’t elaborate, only biting her lip as if struggling to say something.</p><p>“Come on, out with it,” he told her. It was better to get it over with than linger on it.</p><p>She turned her gaze to him, eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>Shifting on his seat to make himself more comfortable, he told her, “Whenever you’re nervous or you’re holding back, you chew on your lip a lot. And you avoid looking people in the eyes.”</p><p>Victoire shrugged, conceding. “I didn’t know you knew me that well. But I, um…” She trailed off, and then seemingly gained back her confidence at the thought of something he couldn’t really decipher. “You should come over to my home for Christmas break.”</p><p>Teddy blinked, putting his head back a bit in surprise. Whatever he was expecting, it certainly wasn’t this. How odd.</p><p>“Yeah,” she continued, gaining momentum, “you should come over, I mean, if you’re only going to stay home alone. I talk about you to them a lot, and I think at this point they’re pretty much all waiting to meet you, and this is the perfect time. I think they’ll actually love you a <em>lot</em>—”</p><p>“Wait, wait, wait,” Teddy interrupted, waving his hands in an attempt to stop her in her tracks. “First of all, I don’t even know your family all that well. Second, I think it’s too late now, I mean, you’re probably leaving in a couple of days, and third, this is <em>really</em> sudden, I don’t want to surprise your family like that.”</p><p>She only waved her hands dismissively. “I’ll take care of all that—but I really want to give you one good Christmas. Even if it really doesn’t change your opinion, I want you to have at least some good memories, yeah? And I don’t leave <em>too</em> soon, I’m taking the tube home in about two days. That should be enough time for you to get your things, right? We have an extra guest room you can stay in too, so that’s not a problem either—”</p><p>“You’re really out here acting like I’m really coming home with you for Christmas, huh?”</p><p>Instead of looking offended, she fixed him with a point-blank stare. “Well, aren’t you?”</p><p>Teddy tilted his head, not really knowing what she was doing.</p><p>“If the reservations you stated were the only problems you had, then if they were solved, everything should be good right? Do you really have anything against staying with my family? I mean, you said it yourself, you wanted to get away from your family, and you’d still be doing that. If you have any other reason for not wanting to come, please tell me, and I’ll work around it,” she said sincerely, looking at him with such hope that Teddy felt like he couldn’t say no.</p><p>Damn, she was good.</p><p>“Yeah, alright,” he said, hanging his head slightly.</p><p>Victoire jumped up, doing a happy dance. She held her arms out for a hug, and he hugged her back. He may not be in the best mood, but he couldn't ever refuse a good hug. She continued to give a quick kiss on his cheek, and then bounded off to wherever the fuck she goes with a cheery goodbye, probably to take care of the very things she’d mentioned.</p><p>Teddy stared at his hands.</p><p>What the hell had just happened?</p><p align="center">—</p><p>In hindsight, Teddy realized that maybe he should’ve fought harder to refuse Victoire’s offer of going to her home with Christmas. As he looked at the mess of clothes in front of him, he became increasingly hopeless about getting his things packed up in time.</p><p>Needless to say, he was having a hard time figuring out what to pack, and how much he needed to pack of everything.</p><p>Teddy wanted to say that he needed four pairs of underwear per day, but what was going to do, piss his pants every day? For fuck’s sake.</p><p>Dragging his hands down his face, he resolved once more to get his packing done. It shouldn’t take as long as he was taking.</p><p>Finally after four more agonizing hours, right before Victoire was set to come, he managed to fit his things into a suitcase, though it had to be said that it was bulging a bit.</p><p>Eh, whatever. He can deal with the consequences later on, it didn’t matter.</p><p>Right as Teddy was entering the living room, he heard a light knock on the door, and quickly went up to the door to swing it open.</p><p>Victoire gave him a grin, and walked into the living room, and asked while absentmindedly surveying her surroundings, “Ready?”</p><p>Teddy nodded. “I packed everything I could possibly need while I’m there. Hopefully I didn’t forget anything…” A frown set on his face as he thought about what he packed again. Toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo, comb, socks…</p><p>He shook his head, trying to throw away any doubts. Going through the list twice was more than sufficient; there was no need to go through the list a third time. Hell, Ellie dropped by yesterday, and was shocked at the fact that Teddy even bothered to make a list.</p><p>It was fairly obvious that Ellie was not a very organized person.</p><p>Through the entirety of their travelling, Teddy could only think about the fact of what he would act like when he was with the Delacour-Weasley’s. He wasn’t quite sure what that would entail, but all he knew that he was a bit prone to fits of nervousness with new people, despite the fact that many people regarded him as somewhat charming.</p><p>He wasn’t quiet about it either; Victoire had to deal with him asking random ass questions having to do with her family or questions completely off the walls. It was a miracle that she hadn’t strangled him yet. <em>That</em> was how many questions he was asking.</p><p>When she finally felt annoyed, she cupped his face in her hands, looked him straight in the eyes, and told him with utmost confidence, “Please don’t worry more about this than you need to. My family is the sweetest—now I know that sounds like I’m biased, but you’ll just have to take my word for it. I promise you that everything you think will go wrong will not go wrong, and if they do, I’ll be there by your side. Now, are you good?”</p><p>At that point, Teddy honestly didn’t know what to say to that, much to tongue tied to get anything of use out of his mouth. He opted for nodding, and when she let go of his face, his cheeks were strangely warm. He still had butterflies in his stomach, but for an entirely different reason.</p><p>When they’d arrived at Victoire’s home—Shell Cottage as the Delacour-Weasley’s have dubbed it, according to Victoire—Teddy felt somewhat better.</p><p>Breathing in the fresh ocean air, and the tranquility of the ocean waves instilled a calm in him that couldn’t be done by anything else. If he didn’t enjoy his stay here, then at least he had the view of the ocean to enjoy.</p><p>Shell Cottage itself seemed like an extension of the ocean itself, from the outside at least. The exterior was a mix of all light blues and cool whites, which served to allow him a bit more peace.</p><p>“Your home is beautiful,” Teddy had murmured to Victoire, leaning in closer to her to allow her to hear.</p><p>She gazed down at him, beaming. “I love it, and I’m glad you do too.”</p><p>Teddy couldn’t help but smile back.</p><p>As they walked down the cobbled path, the feeling in his stomach started rising again. Once Victoire rang the doorbell, and the door opened to reveal her parents, he immediately plastered on the loveliest smile he had in his repertoire for them.</p><p>Her mother—Fleur, was it?—gave a lovely smile of her own, and Bill managed the same.</p><p>“Teddy, right?” Bill asked of him, the genial smile never leaving. “It’s nice to meet the person my daughter talks so much about.”</p><p>Victoire exclaimed, “Papa!” and Teddy couldn’t stop the disbelieving laugh that escaped him. “Oh, really? All good things I hope.”</p><p>There was a lull in the moment until both Fleur and Bill moved out of the way to let the two of them in.</p><p>Fleur put a hand on his shoulder with the lightest touch, and showed him where his room for the break was. He thanked her quietly, and entered the room he was given.</p><p>It was simple, with a bed in the middle and a nightstand next to it with a lamp. Opposite the bed, there was a small mahogany desk, a nice contrast to all the lighter colors in the room. There was a less than sizeable balcony to the right of the bed.</p><p>God, even the interior was stylish. His flat was basically a trash dump that he occasionally deigned to clean.</p><p>Setting his suitcase down, he pulled his coat closer to him, and walked out into the balcony out of curiosity.</p><p>The view happened to a perfect outlook of the ocean, and Teddy could easily see himself sitting out here to watch the sun rise or set. Now if only there was a small tea table there…</p><p>He shook his head of those thoughts almost immediately; this was not his home. But it sure would be nice if he could buy one for himself in the future, now wouldn’t it?</p><p>Teddy paused for a moment to watch the sun slowly go down, seagulls creating a cacophony of music. He could almost fall asleep to that, but he was brought out of his thoughts by the light knock on the guest room door.</p><p>He turned around quickly, surprised to find that it was Bill smiling at him. Even with the scars, he still looked kinder than Teddy would’ve thought. It was a bad thought, and definitely was wrong of him to think, but old biases die hard. He knew that Bill was kind and genuine person from the way Victoire talked about him, in the occasional moment where she felt soft and nostalgic.</p><p>“Oh, hello,” Teddy said, the same smile he gave before on once again.</p><p>“Hi. It’s time for dinner,” he told him.</p><p>Teddy blinked. That early, really?</p><p>He paused, and then chalked it up to his own fucked up eating schedule. Sometimes he ate dinner at eleven o’clock at night or five in the afternoon, no in between.</p><p>Shrugging, he followed Bill down the stairs, taking care to take off his coat along the way and hang it on the coat rack.</p><p>Victoire had changed out of her previous outfit and was wearing a comfortable pair of pajamas. Currently, she was haranguing her mother about stealing a rice cake out of the pan. Eventually, one whine too many later, she was kicked out of the kitchen to sit with the rest of the family, pouting.</p><p>Teddy had to hold back a laugh at her cute expression. As he was smiling at Victoire, he became uncomfortably aware that he was being stared at by someone, and he looked to see that there was a girl and a boy, both probably younger than Victoire, blatantly staring at him. The girl had the decency to look embarrassed, but the little boy gave him a toothy smile, which he returned.</p><p>“Hello,” Teddy began to the both of them, “who are you?”</p><p>The girl was the first one to speak. “I’m Minnie.”</p><p>“I’m Teddy,” he replied. “Is that short for anything?”</p><p>“It’s short for Dominique, but I think it works for Minyoung too,” Minnie said thoughtfully. “Anyways, that’s Louis.”</p><p>Louis waved cheerfully, smiling again.</p><p>“It’s nice to meet you both,” Teddy told the two of them. A moment later, he asked, out of a burning wonder, “Do you have a second name, Vic?”</p><p>Victoire looked up, now munching on a piece of cantucci, probably from the centerpiece of the table. “Yeah, it’s Mina. Louis’ is Minho.”</p><p>“That’s cool.”</p><p>The conversation cut off as the family was called all hands on deck to set the table for dinner. Well, except for him, and began fiddling with his hands. He would have tried to help, but they all seemed to be fine on their own.</p><p>As they begun eating, the conversation of the table immediately went everywhere, Victoire talking to Minnie, and Louis chattering to his papa excitedly about his day.</p><p>Teddy was happy to eat his food quietly and let them do all the talking; if they had engaged with him, he’d have no idea what to say.</p><p>“So, Teddy,” Fleur started.</p><p>Well, shit. Maybe he’d spoken too soon.</p><p>“We did not really want to drop this on you, but it just happened to turn out this way,” she continued, an apologetic note taking place in her voice. “But we are actually going to the Burrow for the second half of Christmas. You do not have to stay long, but I think our extended family wants to meet you.”</p><p>This seemed to catch Victoire’s attention. “Wait, what? I thought we weren’t going to go to be Burrow this year, you told us so.”</p><p>“Yes, but…” Fleur trailed off, but Bill finished her thought. “Well, you brought your boyfriend, and suddenly everyone decided they wanted to meet him, so. I’m really sorry about that, but the majority has spoken.” He gave a sympathetic grimace.</p><p>The moment he heard the word ‘boyfriend’ Teddy choked. He almost hacked up a lung, but was given water by an unknown hand, and he took it gratefully.</p><p>Teddy chanced a look at Victoire, trying to see if she intentionally told them that he was her boyfriend, but she seemed just as confused, if the slight frown on her face was telling of anything.</p><p>“Sorry, I just got like a really spicy pocket of flavor from the rice cakes and it just exploded in my throat,” Teddy explained, rubbing his throat the slightest.</p><p>“It's fine,” Bill told him, blinking.</p><p>Dinner went on smoothly from there, but all Teddy could think about why he didn’t explain that he wasn’t her boyfriend right there.</p><p>No—actually, he knew the answer. He really should’ve cleared things up right then, but in that moment, his pride took over, telling him that he shouldn’t embarrass himself more. The relationship between the time passed from that moment and the risk of his pride was positive, exponentially so.</p><p>He really got himself into the dumbest situations, didn’t he?</p><p>Occasionally, he was asked about himself, a topic that he felt really ambivalent about. If Teddy was being honest, he felt like he knew nothing and everything about himself, and only in situations where he actually needed to know about himself he forgot everything. His mind was never in his favor.</p><p>Fleur asked about his family, and despite him being angry at his sister, Teddy could really go on and on about Hope, like the fact that she’d passed her GCSEs with flying colors, or that just the other day she told him about how she’d finished her first oil painting, and that she was finally beginning on that portfolio she’d been saying she’d wanted to work on for so long.</p><p>His Aunt Bellatrix though? His Aunt Bellatrix can choke. He didn’t tell them that, of course. It was unlikely that it’d ever get around to her, but there was no such thing about being too safe.</p><p>Finally, the affair was over and they were all left alone, though both Minnie and Louis were given stern instruction to go to bed at eleven, but it was clear that it wasn’t going to be enforced by the smile that was pulling at their lips.</p><p>The Christmas cheer really did have a way of worming itself into people’s hearts, huh?</p><p>Victoire, on the other hand, was impatient about getting the two of them alone upstairs, so when they were all free to go, she immediately pulled him into her room.</p><p>“Jesus!” she exclaimed as soon as she was in her room. Teddy took the liberty of sitting on her bed and taking in his surroundings and—hell, was that a BTS poster?</p><p>That made him smile; they had at least one thing in common.</p><p>Victoire began pacing as she apologized to him. “I’m so sorry about all of this, I didn’t think that they’d actually—” She broke off into incoherent murmurs. “Why aren’t you as distressed as I am about this?”</p><p>“It just doesn’t bother me as much as you think it does,” Teddy replied with a shrug. Sure, he was panicked in the moment, but what was done was done. What mattered was what they did moving forward.</p><p>“Okay, okay, okay, cool, cool, cool, that’s good.” She pinched the bridge of her nose. “When I asked about you coming over, they asked me if you were my boyfriend, and I replied jokingly that you were. I shouldn’t have trusted them to take it as a joke.”</p><p>“Maybe that was a bad idea,” he offered, gaze flitting to the frilly green dress hung up on a hanger.</p><p>“You think?” she scoffed.</p><p>“So, what do we do now?” he asked, brightening again when he found a Red Velvet poster.</p><p>“You know,” Victoire mused, plopping herself next to him, “my parents were strangely excited about you coming over after I asked, and I never realized why. Oh <em>god</em>, maybe they were happy I finally had a boyfriend.” She gasped suddenly, and Teddy looked at her, startled. “Fuck, I can’t disappoint them! They’ll be so sad!”</p><p>“What do you think we should do then?” he reiterated his previous question. He had a few ideas, but he wanted her opinion first.</p><p>Victoire didn’t speak for a moment, and then winced a bit. “This is going to be off the walls fucking crazy, but… would you mind please dating me for fake? Just until the end of break or whatever, and later on I’ll tell them I broke up with you.”</p><p>Now, that caught his attention. “Are you sure there aren’t any better ideas? I mean I’m sure that they’d understand if you told them the truth—”</p><p>“<em>Please</em>, Teddy, please, please?” She took his hands, and put his knuckles up to her lips, and it was almost enough to get him to agree. Almost.</p><p>Teddy replied to her with a teasing lilt, “Listen, I don’t really know how I feel about you ruining my image in your parents’ eyes for your own benefit—”</p><p>“I’ll do anything, Jesus H. Christ.”</p><p>“Oh my god, I’m just playing with you. Fine, I’ll do it.”</p><p>“Thank you thank you thank you—” She squealed, bringing him into one of her signature bear hugs, and Teddy returned it, lying his head on her shoulders. This felt really nice, but she let go too soon, and he sighed.</p><p>“Okay, so how do we play fake dating anyways, sleep in the same bed or?” Victoire looked at him expectantly, absentmindedly tucking a piece of hair behind her ear. It was a little funny to him how he’d never noticed how long her hair was. It was extremely curly, but if it was straightened properly, it’d probably go way past her butt.</p><p>“Sleep in the same bed—Victoire. I don’t want your parents to think that we fucked in their home.” Teddy looked at her pointedly, but she merely smiled. “I seriously don’t think it’d take <em>that</em> much for them to believe that we’re dating. I mean, we both didn’t know that they thought we were dating, but they didn’t call us out on anything, like say we weren’t <em>actually </em>dating or whatever.” At that statement, he had to pause. Did they really act that much like a couple? Hm, they should really talk about that.</p><p>Victoire nodded thoughtfully. “Okay, so you think that we shouldn’t make it too over the top then. So… stuff like forehead kisses and hugs?”</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>“Okay, okay, I feel a lot better now,” Victoire told him, giving a long sigh. “I really am so sorry about this—I did not mean for break to go this way.”</p><p>“Honestly, I think this just sounds fun,” Teddy told her sincerely.</p><p>“Well I’m glad someone does,” she told him, though the effect was ruined by the slight smile pulling the corner of her lips.</p><p>Teddy definitely should not be staring at her lips, so he looked back up to her eyes. Fuck, they were really pretty, abort, <em>abort</em>!</p><p>He finally settled on staring on the BTS poster behind her. Poster Yoongi was looking especially nice today. Occasionally he got the comment that Teddy looked like him, but it wasn’t as annoying as it should have been.</p><p>“Anyways,” Victoire said too loudly for the atmosphere, “I’ll see you tomorrow Teddy.”</p><p>She stared at him indecipherably for a moment. Teddy made the move to go, but was pulled back by Victoire, who cupped his cheeks like she did earlier that day and kissed his forehead.</p><p>And the blush was back. He only hated blushing so much because his somewhat light skin made it noticeable.</p><p>“What was <em>that </em>for?”</p><p>“Practice,” she giggled. Then she gently pushed him out of her room, and Teddy was left alone to think about what the hell he’d just gotten himself into.</p>
