</p><p> </p><p>Her name is Hrodwunn, and she despises that no one uses the proper form of her name outside of the great duchy of Bavaria. She is Hrodwunn of Hrabanklawa, but others in the Empire call her Rowena of Raven’s Claw. It isn’t proper to use her magic against those who butcher her name, so she decides she will learn to speak around them instead.</p><p>Her tutors are tearing out their own hair in frustration by the time Hrodwunn is age nine. She takes this as a sign that she is succeeding in her quest to be more knowledgeable than those who think her name something it is not. Hrodwunn’s mother gave her this name: it is the joy of a good reputation, one who speaks well.</p><p>Rowena does not mean those things. It is merely a set of three sounds, ones that others find more pleasing, when instead they should be accepting the artistry of the duchy’s favored Bavarian. Her father’s name is Colobert and means <em>brilliant helmet</em>, a reference to the shining warrior helms of old. Her mother’s name Theudelinda means <em>tender people</em>, but those who believe Theudelinda leads with weakness will know regret—and forget that the most famous bearer of that name was the Bavarian-born Queen of the Longobardi, Saxons who once ruled most of the Apennine Peninsula. No one dares tell them to say their names as different from what they are.</p><p>When she is still very young, her parents are always quick to say how glad they are that Hrodwunn was born on the twenty-fourth day of October in 953, no sooner and no later. They say that she was born when their entire kingdom looked to be on the verge of tearing itself apart as everyone rebelled against their king.</p><p>“Not that we necessarily like His Highness very much,” is Theudelinda’s wry comment. “But the others would have left us with no kingdom at all. When we’ve so many enemies to the east, what others chose was not particularly wise.”</p><p>“Didn’t they think about that? The rebels?” Hrodwunn asks, with no idea that even her own parents had rebelled against Duke Henry’s mostly-absent reign over Bavaria. He tried to do better to his own people towards the end, but it is nearly the Winter Solstice in 955. Henry I has been dead since the first day of November last year, felled by mortal wounds sustained in battle against the invading Hungarians. Her parents have taken her on processions throughout Bavaria to show her the battle scars on the land, the burnt-out buildings and crops that were destroyed in their fields as armies crushed the fruits of many labors into the earth. Colobert and Theudelinda tell Hrodwunn that if it were not for the magical duchies like their own Hrabanklawa, there would have been starvation for many. Hrodwunn has already heard that word repeated often enough in her short life that she knows exactly what sort of terror starvation would mean.</p><p>“They thought about power,” her mother finally answers. “And little else but the ways in which they might acquire more for themselves.”</p><p>“Oh.” Hrodwunn wonders what four-year-old Henry II, Duke of Bavaria, might one day try to do for power. Then again, she has met his mother, Duchess Judith. She thinks maybe he wouldn’t dare.</p><p>When the warm weather arrives after winter’s end, the whole of Bavaria seems to be celebrating. It’s a terrible racket that makes it hard to concentrate on learning new words.</p><p>“Why?” Hrodwunn wails when it passes midnight and still there is shouting echoing throughout their keep.</p><p>Colobert sweeps Hrodwunn from the floor and carries her in his arms. “The king and queen’s youngest son, Otto II, has survived the winter of his birth. That is always a good omen. We certainly thought much the same for you, dearest.”</p><p>“Oh.” Hrodwunn frowns. She supposes if all of this noise is celebrating someone not dying, then she’ll be as majestic and gracious as her mother about it.</p><p>“Majestic? Gracious?” Colobert puts the back of his hand to her forehead. “Such words to come from my child who will not be three until hærfest season!”</p><p>“There is nothing wrong with my words!” Hrodwunn retorts. Her father laughs and bids her to tell her more of her words until she falls asleep in his lap at dawn.</p><p>Hrodwunn remains an only child, despite all her parents’ attempts, despite all of the Healers and their potions. She scowls and goes to find the primary Healer of their keep, Ewald. “Why don’t I have sisters?”</p><p>“What’s that? You do not wish for brothers, too?” Ewald asks, pausing in his work of rubbing a fresh coating of beeswax into his spruce wand.</p><p>“Fine,” Hrodwunn huffs. “Why don’t I have either?”</p><p>“Ah.” Ewald dips his cloth into the bottle and retrieves a fresh smear of sweet beeswax. “The Duke and the Duchess are but twenty-three and twenty years of age. There isn’t a reason, young Hrodwunn. We simply do not know.”</p><p>“How can you not know?” Hrodwunn asks.</p><p>“Because I am not a god, young one. You’d be best served asking one of them.”</p><p>Hrodwunn shivers. “No, thank you.” She decides to go back to her quill and the new jar of ink Mother brought her. If she masters her letters, she has been promised a new book. She has read every book in her chamber and every book she is allowed to touch in the Keep; she is going to <em>earn</em> that tome.</p><p>Perhaps her mother and father spoil her a bit, or perhaps they would have indulged her even if they had bred well enough to fill the family keep. Hrodwunn does not stop at learning her Latin letters and Saxon runes, reading in Bavarian and Latin and old Saxony. She learns magic and languages—so many languages. She will learn every language she encounters, a goal that makes her father groan and bribe the new tutors into making certain that no one knows his daughter plans on being the most intelligent magician in Bavaria. He does not mind her learning, but many have foolish notions in regards to a woman who is educated beyond the necessities of running a noble household.</p><p>The month before her fourth birthday fills the air with a cautious, fretful sort of quiet when Bavaria receives the news that the Heir to the Frankish throne, Prince Liudolf, has died while on campaign in Italy. “He was so young,” Theudelinda whispers when she thinks Hrodwunn isn’t listening. “Twenty-eight only.”</p><p>“The new queen’s first two sons have also died in infancy. Unless our kingdom sees good sense and looks to the princess, young Otto is the king’s only Heir,” Colobert says, looking grim. “Their Majesties should attempt more children.”</p><p>“Our king would have to spend enough time in East Francia to make such a thing possible,” old Steward Kunibert mutters.</p><p>Hrodwunn continues reading and keeps up with her studies. When the adults discuss their kingdom and its—politics, yes, that word—she wishes to join them. Not to be coddled, not to be cooed over. She wants to <em>speak</em> and be understood. She wants to have something useful to say.</p><p>When King Otto crosses back into Italy in 961, Hrodwunn is eight years old. Perhaps she does not yet have anything useful to say that isn’t a mirror to her mother’s comments over what men will do for power, but she is at least now allowed to sit among them and listen. Colobert and Theudelinda know that Hrodwunn may not speak, but she already understands.</p><p>In mid-February, word comes back from Italy that the Pope of the Christian Church has declared their king to be the new Roman Emperor in the West. To the surprise of many, Otto’s wife Adelheid was also named Empress of the Romans, not mere Empress Consort. The Kingdoms of East Francia and Italy are now one united realm.</p><p>Hrodwunn does not think she is the only one wondering at the point of acquiring such land. Otto rules by his authority and by the Church’s authority first. Only after the Church extends its mighty arm do the nobles have a say. How is Emperor Otto to control this much land when he wishes to control its entire doings on his own?</p><p>On Hrodwunn’s tenth birthday, before the evening celebration, her father introduces her to Åsa. She is a tall woman from the fiefdom of Normandy. She is still very Norse in appearance despite nearly a century of intermarriages, with pale skin, bright gold hair, and eyes the color of the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Hrodwunn has only seen a magician’s magical <em>Recordari</em> image of still water, but even witnessed in such fashion, the color is memorable and unmistakable.</p><p>“The Lady Åsa is a wandmaker, Hrodwunn,” Colobert tells her. “She wishes to speak with the youngest magician in Hrabanklawa.”</p><p>Hrodwunn grins and spends an entertaining afternoon speaking with the first wandmaker she has ever met. Åsa does not seem to mind her endless questions about wood and the cores that strengthen a wand. She answers Hrodwunn with gentle patience. Sometimes she asks questions of Hrodwunn as well. Only a few center on the idea of magic. Others revolve around her opinion of government policies, politics, the Church’s tithing of the whole of East Francia, the land of Hrabanklawa, the Black Forest—so many differing ideas that do not seem to be related at all, though each subsequent discussion is very interesting.</p><p>Åsa departs after the evening feast. Hrodwunn is sad to see the Norman woman part from the keep. There are few magicians in Hrabanklawa aside from herself and her parents, and the others are not nearly as patient with a young girl’s desire to learn.</p><p>To Hrodwunn’s surprise, Åsa returns on the Winter Solstice. She gives Hrodwunn a small parcel wrapped in good leather, instructs her to take good care of her winter gift, and then departs using magical Fahrend before Hrodwunn can even open her mouth to thank her—or to provide proper hospitality and invite Åsa to join them for the evening feast.</p><p>Inside the leather is a wand. Hrodwunn squeaks in delight, chokes back the undignified sound, and then explores her gift. She recalls from her birthday conversation with the Lady Åsa that by description, this must be a wand of pear, though she has never seen one of the trees for herself. It is carved in a spiral from tip to its handle, where the spiral is ingrained as a pattern rather than texture. It is longer than her arm, but when she grows to her full height Hrodwunn thinks it will be the perfect length. It has a gentle hint of flex, but there is nothing within the wrapping to tell Hrodwunn of its core. That, she muses, she will need to discern on her own.</p><p>Colobert looks pleased when Hrodwunn shows him her new wand. “Yes, I thought the Lady Åsa would be the best choice. The wand fits you well, daughter.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Hrodwunn says, and then asks to be excused until the proper start of the feast. She has practiced only with runes for magic before this time, and she wants to see what it is like to cast with a wand. Her father is kind enough to indulge her.</p><p>Casting with a wand feels amazing. It is as if her magic has been granted the freedom to be itself.</p><p>In 967, the young Duke of Bavaria is wed. Hrodwunn is twelve and has to be present, standing with her parents and ranking men from Hrabanklawa. Her head itches from all of her black hair bound up in ridiculous combs; she wants to get rid of their extra pinching weight at first opportunity.</p><p>Her mother might actually murder Hrodwunn if she were to cut her hair. Ridiculous Court traditions. As if she is of any sort of age yet to be wed.</p><p>Henry II is sixteen and marrying Gisela, Princess of Burgundy, who is twelve. Hrodwunn doesn’t think either of <em>them</em> should be marrying, either. Henry has often acted the complete lout when Hrodwunn is forced to spend time in her overlord’s company, and the princess is no older than she is.</p><p>“You are not marrying me off at age twelve,” Hrodwunn tells her parents in displeasure when they return home.</p><p>Colobert looks surprised. “Of course not.”</p><p>“Or thirteen.”</p><p>“No…”</p><p>“Not fourteen, either!” Hrodwunn blurts out in instant suspicion.</p><p>“Hopefully not,” Theudelinda intervenes before any potential shouting occurs. Hrodwunn is glad. She knows that a fiery temper often accompanies the growth of a boy to man or girl to woman, but she despises those moments when her emotions have no care for rational thought. “But Hrodwunn: we have no Heirs save you. If the worst happens, the duchy of Hrabanklawa will be lost.”</p><p>“There is magic in this land that is not found elsewhere,” Colobert says. “We would not be able to trust that another of the magical duchies would gain control of Hrabanklawa, not with our Empire’s…”</p><p>“Politics,” Hrodwunn finishes, nodding her understanding. It isn’t as if this is a new discovery. She grew up with the understanding that a suitable noble man would marry her to take on the role of Duke over Hrabanklawa. There is no doubting the necessity of it at all, not when it will require a strong alliance to keep the duchy within her bloodline. “Just make certain my new husband isn’t an idiot, please.”</p><p>She knows five languages by age thirteen. She is able to read and converse in her own Saxon-bred Bavarian, the common Frankish tongue of the Empire, Latin (Vulgar Latin she considers not a proper language at all, even if she can speak it), Greek, and <em>franceis</em>. She plans to learn the West Saxon English, which has become the most common tongue in the south of Britain, Hebrew, Arabic, and Aramaic—the latter three which are most useful for reading many of the scrolls and books that have not been copied in Greek or Latin. The moment she can find the proper texts and an excellent tutor, she wishes to add Catalan, Norse—it is best to know the trade tongue of the north as well as the south—Gaelic, Breton…and perhaps she will ponder a language from Iberia aside from Arabic.</p><p>She attains her first magical mastery at age fourteen, at a time when she should have just begun her first apprenticeship. Her father chastises her for being overly pleased about holding a mastery in Magical Mathematics at such a young age, but Hrodwunn knows he is proud of her accomplishment. The moment she silences her tongue, he brags on her behalf to anyone who will stand still long enough to listen.</p><p>Hrodwunn thinks no more of marriage until December, when it is announced that she will be wed the following September, a month before her sixteenth birthday. She nods, asks again if her husband is an idiot, and is assured he is not. “Very well.” Aside from voicing her approval in regards to the inevitable, she wants nothing more to do with the wedding unless she has no choice.</p><p>The news comes in early January that young Otto II has already been crowned co-Emperor by the newest Pope, done so on Christmas Day last year. “He is <em>eleven</em>,” Hrodwunn says, certain she must be making an improper face. “Does our Emperor so fear that he is about to drop dead that he wishes for his son’s claim to be utterly certain?”</p><p>“All of the Emperor’s other Heirs did exactly that,” her parents remind her. Hrodwunn grimaces, chastised. She’d forgotten that fact. She will not forget it twice, especially when word comes in March that queen dowager Mathilda, Otto I’s mother, has died at the age of seventy-one. It seems as if the royal family has all taken it into their heads to die within the same decade.</p><p>That summer is annoying. She does not need such a ridiculous dress. Her hair does not need to learn to curl around complicated golden combs rather than lying smooth and unbound, as is her preference. The only reason Hrodwunn does not stage her own revolt is her mother’s sadness: “I will only ever see one child wed.”</p><p>Hrodwunn thinks that Theudelinda is discounting the marriages of grandchildren, but does not voice the thought. Her mother meant a child of her loins, not the loins of another.</p><p>When Hrodwunn finally meets her new husband for the first time that hærfest season, she learns a very important lesson. She should have been <em>far more specific</em>.</p><p>Bernardus Thomas, younger son of a magical duke from Lorraine, is not an idiot. He is, in fact, quiet intelligent…but he is not kind. He is not interested in the marriage for Hrodwunn’s sake, or for the safety of Hrabanklawa. He is not even truly concerned for himself. Bernardus is interested only in the coffers of her duchy, money that will help support his desire to fight on behalf of their new Roman Empire.</p><p>“Do you care only for battle, then?” Hrodwunn asks, trying not to sound disparaging. They will be wed the following week. Perhaps she will be able to scrape the ale barrel and find hidden depths in this eighteen-year-old man. In the meantime, she will be certain the marriage contract stipulates that Hrodwunn, as Hrabanklawa’s Heir, will control the coffers of the keep.</p><p>Bernardus retrieves his wand and holds up the oak length. It is longer than his hand and forearm, a size that Hrodwunn finds amusingly excessive. “God gave me the strength to conquer the enemies of the Roman Empire, Hrodwunn. Why would I turn my face from my creator and not use them on His behalf?”</p><p>“You do not use them on behalf of God. You use them on behalf of Emperor Otto’s whim.”</p><p>Her husband-to-be stares at her in dismay. “You truly are not Christian. I thought your father was in jest.”</p><p>Hrodwunn makes a derisive sound. “If you paid the slightest bit of attention, you would have realized on your first meeting that my father does not jest about anything. My mother is not Christian, either. My pledge belongs to Baduhenna, the goddess of war.”</p><p>“War,” Bernardus repeats thoughtfully. “Would this goddess find favor with me?”</p><p>“That depends.” Hrodwunn narrows her eyes. “She does not judge men well and worthy if they treat poorly with women.”</p><p>There is a moment of silence before they’re both on their feet, wands raised, but Hrodwunn is faster. She takes her pledge to Baduhenna seriously, though she is otherwise devoted to scholarly pursuits.</p><p>Bernardus stares at her in shock when he is bound with ropes that immobilize him. They burn a vibrant sapphire blue, the color of Hrabanklawa’s magic.</p><p>“We will never be friends, I think,” Bernardus finally says.</p><p>“I did not think you were seeking friendship.” Hrodwunn dismisses the ropes and waits to see if he will be foolish a second time. “Were you?”</p><p>“No. I sought a good marriage only, as your father sought for you. I will bring great prestige to Hrabanklawa, but in my own way,” Bernardus declares. “Bear our Heirs, and I have no concern for what you do so long as you do not sully yourself with another man.”</p><p><em>I’m barely inclined to sully myself with you</em>, Hrodwunn thinks in displeasure, but she has no choice. This marriage will proceed no matter her opinion of its failings. “I was raised to understand the importance of making certain my family’s line continues, Bernardus. Never fear: we shall have our Heirs.”</p><p>“What of their religion?” Bernardus asks, dusting off his long tunic.</p><p>That is one thing Hrodwunn <em>will</em> fight for. “They will choose.” She allows frost to chill her voice. “Whatever path of faith our children walk, it will be of their choosing. There will be no forced baptisms in our duchy, which is something your holy book speaks against—Christ was of age to choose before he was baptized. If our Heirs wish to be Christian, as you are, then they may choose the holy font within a church. If they choose not to be Christian, you will treat well with them, regardless.”</p><p>Bernardus thinks on it before granting her a slow nod. “Your terms are not disagreeable. Your father did not jest about your grasp of logic and knowledge, either. I will not force our children to follow my faith, though I ask that they learn of it.”</p><p>“Easily done. Even I know of it, Bernardus,” Hrodwunn says. “They must be educated in Christian ways merely to survive in our new Empire.”</p><p>The wedding itself is tedious and dull, a long Christian ceremony performed for Bernardus’s pleasure. She normally doesn’t mind Christian services, but noble weddings seem designed to make one miserable. Her head aches from the combs that bind up her hair. Hrodwunn’s gown is too heavy and capable of blinding others due to sewn-on gems that reflect all the candlelight. The gown is a ridiculous expenditure that she resolves to sell the moment everyone else has forgotten its existence.</p><p>The priest drones on, speaking of love, of honoring and cherishing. Hrodwunn wants to scowl at the necessity of agreeing to such a falsehood. There will be no love between herself and Bernardus.</p><p>Hrodwunn uses part of the ceremony to hope that her new husband is not a terrible bed partner. She learned much by listening to the gossip of the servants, though her father would have disapproved. She knows what to expect and what should occur, and how it should be pleasurable. She also knows the reasons why it might not be, and how to identify the cause.</p><p>The priest is of their duchy, and thus not concerned when Hrodwunn and Bernardus cross wands as their final pledge to each other and the House of Hrabanklawa. However, there is murmuring from among the guests invited on Bernardus’s behalf, discontent that makes no sense. They <em>must</em> have known Bernardus was a magician already, if he is using his magic to fight for the Emperor. A bit of flashing light from their wands of oak and pear should not be so disquieting. None of those men and women seem happy when the ceremony is done, though irritatingly, most of their ire is centered on her.</p><p>The wedding feast is awkward, not because she feels out of place, but because Hrodwunn’s ire has been stirred. She spends the entire meal using her command of all she has learned to make Bernardus’s guests stutter and stammer like fools as she proves that she is more educated in matters they themselves could never hope to comprehend.</p><p>“It isn’t nice to treat our guests as such,” Colobert murmurs in a low voice.</p><p>“They should have remembered their manners during the wedding ceremony, then, and kept their ill thoughts to themselves,” Hrodwunn replies.</p><p>Hrodwunn waits until she is alone with her mother and two trusted servants. It takes all three of them working in tandem to get her out of this ridiculous gown. “Bernardus’s family seems leery of magic, given that they came to see magical kin wed,” she says, finally broaching the matter.</p><p>Theudelinda’s lips thin in disapproval. “After today, you need not concern yourself with them at all. Bernardus is joining our family; you do not have to treat with his kin unless they attempt to invade.”</p><p>“If they attempt to invade rather than seek hospitality, they will seek nothing else ever again,” Hrodwunn mutters. The servants giggle, and Theudelinda’s expression seems less harsh.</p><p>Bernardus is a <em>terrible</em> lover. He does not try to hurt her, but it is obvious that he lacks both experience and knowledge. That will never do. She is not going to spread her legs for this man in hopes of pregnancy unless she takes some measure of enjoyment from the experience.</p><p>“Allow me to educate you,” she hisses at him, taking his bristly-haired sack in an iron grip. “Or you will never stick that ridiculous pintel anywhere but the greased bore of a rotting tree.”</p><p>“You are a terrifying woman.” Bernardus winces when she gives his testiculis a warning squeeze. “Er—education. That might be best, yes. Where did you learn—?”</p><p>“By listening to those who could afford to lie with others without concern of it ruining their ability to make a good marriage,” Hrodwunn replies, irritated. “Now, you will listen to me, or there will be no telltale sign on the sheets in the morning for others to observe and be pleased by.” That is also ridiculous, a misleading notion crafted by idiots, but Hrodwunn is not above picking her finger to smear the sheet with blood. If it were not for a need to consummate this marriage for the Heirs that are necessary, she would do <em>only</em> that and then maker her new fool of a husband sleep by the hearth.</p><p>After Bernardus listens to her, their second attempt at joining as husband and wife is better. It is definitely not any sort of soaring glory, but practice might rectify that. At least Bernardus does not seem to be averse to the idea of practice.</p><p>Hrodwunn never gave her body much consideration before. Tonight she does so after Bernardus is asleep, snoring off the wine served during their wedding feast. She stands naked before her sleeping chamber’s gilded mirror and studies her reflection.</p><p>Now that she has escaped those uncomfortable combs, her hair is again almost sleek and proper. It is dark, the color of a raven’s wing instead of the pure black of perfect ink, and hangs almost to her waist. Others want Hrodwunn to grow her hair longer, but this is quite long enough.</p><p>Her face is not displeasing, her features rather angular and striking. She does not spend much time out of doors, but she’s always had a faint brown cast to her skin, coloration that still sometimes presents itself from the family’s ancient southern bloodline.</p><p>Her breasts are shaped like the lower halves of ripe pears, and almost as firm. Her waist is trim, perhaps bordering on too thin. The muscles on her arms and legs are solid from climbing the many stairs within the keep and the steep hillsides in her duchy. Her most obvious feature is her eyes, which would be the same color as her family’s magic but for the lack of glow.</p><p>She is symmetrical, with no visible deformities that would cause others to treat her unkindly. No one says she is beautiful but for her parents, but they are wise enough to see all of who she is. It is her intelligence and her spirit that they include in their measure of beauty. That will have to suffice.</p><p>Hrodwunn learns during the rest of September, October, November, and December that she does not like coupling overly much…or perhaps it is Bernardus she does not like. She sometimes touches herself when her husband is away on his tours of the duchy, learning the land he will one day be responsible for. While the physical sensations are interesting, they do not capture her attention the way that an ancient scroll will. She feels more joy with a quill in her hand.</p><p>Perhaps she doesn’t like the physical at all?</p><p>That doesn’t seem quite right, but she has only one partner with whom to experiment, and she’d rather avoid Bernardus as much as possible. When she realizes in late January that she is pregnant, Hrodwunn is filled with vast relief. Bernardus lingers for an entire day to toast his good fortune before he leaves to join their Emperor for Otto’s attempts at conquering the principalities of the Apennine Peninsula which lie south of Rome.</p><p>Hrodwunn hopes he stays away until the baby is born. She is concerned with more important things than her traveling husband. Pregnancy is not to her taste at all, which makes Hrodwunn wonder how other women bear it. She is uncomfortable all the time. Her hips and pubis ache. Smells that were once pleasurable are horrendous. Foods that she hates are enjoyable; foods that she loves make her ill.</p><p>Forty weeks of this is nigh intolerable, but Hrodwunn reminds herself that Colobert and Theudelinda’s hearts will be eased when there is another Heir for the family duchy. Hrodwunn will do her best to provide multiple Heirs; she merely has to do so before the overzealous warrior she is wedded to dies in one of his foolish battles. She will not see Hrabanklawa lost to others who would not understand it, so she endures the pregnancy with a smile that is all gritted teeth.</p><p>Bernardus returns the week the Healers estimate that Hrodwunn will give birth. Hrodwunn nearly hexes him on sight until she realizes that he has given no offence except for daring to exist in her presence while Hrodwunn is miserable.</p><p>“That is not quite the welcome I expected upon my return.” Bernardus’s fair skin freckled and turned red in the southern sun, but otherwise took on no sign of color at all.</p><p>“Very well. Next time, you will spend forty weeks growing a child in your belly, and I will fight against the enemies of our Emperor.”</p><p>Bernardus is outraged. “Women cannot fight in the Emperor’s armies! You are not fit!”</p><p>Hrodwunn stares at him before she starts laughing. “Can’t fight—not fit—you truly pay no attention to things of import, do you?”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Bernardus asks, looking wary. He learned to fear her tongue as well as her wand, and being away for eight months has not caused his wariness to fade. Good.</p><p>“Bavaria is an eastern duchy within this Empire. The duchy of Hrabanklawa is very close to our eastern borders. If the Slavic peoples decide to attack again—as they have before—then we <em>all</em> fight, Bernardus. Not just the men. Not just the magicians. We all defend our homes, man, woman, and child, and we do so very well.”</p><p>He is still disapproving. “Women should not fight. You are delicate, and it is a man’s duty to protect you.”</p><p>Hrodwunn rolls her eyes in disbelief. “Husband, I am about to squeeze a child larger than a calebasse gourd through a passage that is most decidedly smaller. Do not speak to me of things that are delicate until you have performed the very same feat!”</p><p>Her firstborn son comes into the world on the tenth day of the tenth month of 969, a fortnight before Hrodwunn’s seventeenth birthday. If Hrodwunn thought pregnancy was awful, then childbirth is exhausting. She has a non-magical midwife and a magical healer, and the pains are greatly lessened thanks to their efforts, but by her goddess, it is such <em>effort</em>.</p><p>By the time she holds an unhappy, red-faced bundle, the midwife is dealing with the afterbirth. Both of them wish for Hrodwunn to eat the child’s placenta, as is customary after harsh pregnancies. Hrodwunn would sooner eat a man’s greased bore in a tree stump. If they wish her to eat red meat, they can slaughter a cow. The placenta will be buried under one of the great trees as a tribute to Baduhenna. Birthing a child is also a battle.</p><p>Bernardus greets his new son and wishes to call him Houdin, a name from Auvergne. It is not an unpleasant name, so Hrodwunn agrees. Then Bernardus is gone again before the child is finished with his first meal. He is assured of an Heir; now Bernardus’s chief concern is once again fighting for Emperor Otto in the name of God.</p><p>If he dies, Hrodwunn is going to be far more particular about her next spouse, but she does not actually want Bernardus dead yet. She would prefer to have her Heirs while she is still young enough to recover from the difficulties of pregnancy quickly. She has no wish to be infirm.</p><p>Bernardus might fight on behalf of his Emperor, but Hrodwunn protects her duchy while learning from her parents how best to run the household. Colobert is an excellent duelist, and those who do not shield against his magic will bear those scars forever. Theudelinda is a master of water, and the sky will flood the fields of battle on her command.</p><p>Hrodwunn’s second mastery of the magical written word might seem useless in battle, but combined with her knowledge of runes and maths both magical and mundane, she is able to gain them advantages in trade, in siege situations, in diplomacy, and all manner of instances where a clever mind is of more use than a duelist’s wand. Mind Magic’s talents all but fall into place for her afterwards. Between those three specializations in magic and her own studies, Hrodwunn is somewhat content.</p><p><em>Somewhat</em>. Hrodwunn doesn’t understand why her contentment is not complete. She has a spouse who does not harm her and who is away much of the time. She has parents who love her. She has an excellent home and the means to study and learn all she likes. Her son is hale, growing strong and well with no signs of any fearful childhood ailments. Houdin is non-magical, but he is <em>hers</em>, and Hrodwunn loves her son with a fierceness that surprises her.</p><p>Hrodwunn is still not content. She has no idea how to fill this strange gap in her life.</p><p> </p><p>
