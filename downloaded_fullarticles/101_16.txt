          <div class="userstuff"><p>“I’m not saying that this isn’t one of your brightest ideas Tom. I’m just saying that usually, you don’t make such glaring mistakes.”</p>
<p>Harry’s arms folded across his chest as he stared down at Tom from outside the “safety circle” as Tom had deemed it. </p>
<p>“Harry, I do <em>so</em> appreciate the side commentary, but do you not believe your <em>astute</em> observations would be well directed toward the inner walls of your mind?” Tom frowned when he heard Harry cover a laugh. “Or better yet, you and your observations could walk a little deeper into the Forest. I hear the werewolves love chatting under the Full Moon.”</p>
<p>“Yes, well. We wouldn’t want to be out under the Full Moon. Would we?” Harry’s eyes drifted upward. In the clearing, the beautiful Moon in all her <em>Full</em> glory was even more apparent. “Aren’t you supposed to be some genius prodigy? How in Merlin’s name did you mix up the rituals?”</p>
<p>“They were incredibly similar. The only difference between them being the <em>Full</em> and <em>New</em> Moon. It was not my intention to lose order of the parchments, and if your little Weasley didn’t run book first into me, we would not be in this situation.”</p>
<p>Harry sighed and went back to watching Tom, who was very shirtless, continue to carefully pour salt into the shape of runes. A painstaking level of patience was <em>probably</em> required for such a task. Yet, Harry was <em>anything</em> but patient and just wanted to get this whole ritual nonsense on the road.</p>
<p>After all, Tom couldn’t back out now, the ritual promised swift death to those who stopped after laying the first rune, and the magically charged crystals seemed menacing enough to keep that promise. Harry had only started reading (thus finding the error) because Tom had wanted confirmation on a rune and Harry only continued reading past that information out of pure boredom. </p>
<p>And a <em>little</em> spite. Tom made an off-hand comment about Harry not understanding a children’s book, let alone an entire ritual book. So Harry was very smug about finding Tom’s error. Until the whole…potential death thing. But regardless.</p>
<p>“Tom, when you said you needed my help, being a chaperone wasn’t what I thought you had in mind.”</p>
<p>“Did you actually finish reading the book after your surprising Full Moon discovery? Or did you just stop there? </p>
<p>“Uh, why?”</p>
<p>“I’ve finished the last rune. I’ll explain your part later.”</p>
<p>Tom’s chanting was rhythmic and peaceful, and the wind seemed playful suddenly as if it was approving of their questionable at best choices. It ruffled the hair on their heads, and Harry couldn’t help his soft smile when Tom’s face grew tight. Probably at the thought of how dishevelled his hair now looked. Completely unacceptable for the Head Boy to have messy hair while attempting a very illegal ritual, <em>no sir</em>.</p>
<p>A faint glow surrounded the ritual circle, it’s light a pale yellow and the night around them felt darker than before when the north and south crystals started to pulsate slowly.</p>
<p>Tom wasn’t exactly forthcoming with information as to what the ritual was supposed to accomplish, but he wouldn’t put himself in life-threatening harm, so Harry felt pretty relaxed about the whole thing. He mostly decided to treat this as an exciting life experience. Using this to grow as a Wizard. <em>Blah blah blah.</em> Whatever else Hermione would like to hear when he inevitably spoke to her about this later. </p>
<p>However, as soon as the east and west crystals joined in, Harry started getting a bit nervous. </p>
<p>Harry wouldn’t say he was gifted with the Sight or anything like that. In fact, if not for Luna, he’d call all of that plus Divination a load of hogwash and be done with it. But there were some moments in Harry’s life, where the hairs on the back of his neck would raise, an uneasy feeling would shift his bones, and his eyes would start marking exists and safe routes away from some impending danger. He’s never been wrong about his strange sense before, which is why he wasn’t surprised when Tom stopped chanting and went horribly still.</p>
<p>“Tom? You all set?”</p>
<p>Harry also wasn’t surprised when he got no response.</p>
<p>“Tom, this is so not funny.”</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>“Tom, I’m going to leave your arse in the woods. Good luck explaining this one to Snape.”</p>
<p>Tom’s eyes, which had apparently shut at some point, blinked open. The eye contact was intense, but not in the hot and sexy way Tom liked to play at.</p>
<p>“You’re a bastard. I thought you were possessed or something, let’s get out of here if you’re done already.”</p>
<p>“Harry. Come into the circle.”</p>
<p>Harry’s nervousness <em>skyrocketed</em>.</p>
<p>“You specifically told me not to enter the ritual circle under any circumstances, remember?”</p>
<p>“Come into the safety circle.”</p>
<p>“The safety circle was a preemptive measure in case, and I quote: Your idiotic Gryffindor brain decides it is a great idea to get too close to the ritual circle. OR attempt to save me if something completely normal to me, but strange to you, happens.”</p>
<p>“Come into the safety circle.”</p>
<p><em>Fuck</em>.</p>
<p>“Fine. But if you’re possessed and are about to kill me, we are breaking up.”</p>
<p>Harry meant it too, he would not tolerate any of that. And it was a comforting thought as he hesitantly stepped over Tom’s detailed linework and moved deeper into the safety circle, stopping at the very edge of the ritual circle. </p>
<p>Tom crept slowly towards Harry until they were literally a line of carefully poured salt apart. Tom reached into his back pocket, and instead of pulling out the wand that Harry was expecting, he pulled out a sharp <em>blade</em>.</p>
<p>“Alright. Now, where the bloody hell did you get that?” Harry was taught not to point because it was rude, his mother would <em>definitely</em> scold him if she saw him now. </p>
<p>“Stab me.”</p>
<p>Harry paused, he must be losing his sanity because-<em>what?</em> And his face must have portrayed his shocked confusion because all Tom said in response to the silence was,</p>
<p>“No seriously, stab me.”</p>
<p>“You’ve lost your <em>fucking mind</em> if you think I’m about to <em>stab you.</em>”</p>
<p>“Harry, you didn’t finish reading, and I told you I would explain why I needed you. Well, here you go-<em>stab me</em>.” Tom thrust the knife into Harry’s hand, he adjusted Harry’s grip and pointed the knife at his lower abdomen. When he was satisfied with the positioning, he looked up at Harry and gave a firm nod.</p>
<p>Harry steadfastly ignored everything Tom was doing, shaking his head in slowly dawning horror. Tom seriously wanted Harry to stab him in the stomach—<em>what the fuck.</em></p>
<p>“Tom, when I said I was willing to try new things in the bedroom, bondage or roleplay was what I had in mind. Stabbing you is kind of a turn-off.”</p>
<p>“Harry, shut up and listen to me.” Tom’s hand gently caressed Harry’s cheek, tearing Harry’s attention away from the <em>fucking knife</em> he was holding in his hands to Tom’s eyes. </p>
<p>There was always a sureness in Tom’s gaze, it was infallible and unwavering and had <em>nothing</em> on the way he was staring into Harry’s eyes right now. </p>
<p>“I trust you. This ritual requires me to be completely out of control. With the knife in your hands, you have complete control. It requires a level of trust that I don’t have for anyone. Not a single person. Except <em>you</em>.”</p>
<p>Tom carefully slipped his hand under Harry’s chin to delicately close Harry’s gaping mouth. He hated it when Harry did that. </p>
<p>
  <em>“I trust you.”</em>
</p>
<p>With Tom Riddle looking him in the eyes and proclaiming such a level of deep trust, Harry didn’t know what to say, what to do. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So he looked back down at the knife and looked back up at Tom’s eyes and after a moment of pointless hesitation because really, he trusted Tom just as much and believed in everything he does entirely—</p>
<p>Harry stabbed Tom.</p></div>
