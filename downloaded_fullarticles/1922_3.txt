          <div class="userstuff"><p>It wasn't Draco's fault that Weasley was loud making Draco overhear their conversation. </p><p>"If you fancy him, just ask him out!" </p><p>"I can't…" Potter said. "I don't…" Draco wondered for a brief moment who they were discussing. It was odd he felt cold realising Potter fancied a 'him'. </p><p>"He has no prospects so it's not like he'll say no to you." </p><p>"Thanks, Ron. That's what I want," Potter said with derision in his tone. "I don't want Malfoy to be with me only because he has no other options." </p><p>"You know that's not what I mean." </p><p> </p><p>Worse than feeling cold was now feeling like his heart would explode. Draco had no reason to feel cold. Potter fancied him. </p><p>"I'm not gonna ask him anything. I can't trust him. If he says yes, I won't know if it's because he actually wants to. You seriously think he'd use me?" </p><p>"A snake's a snake." </p><p>Draco frowned at the accusation. He was a lot of things but, honestly? A snake? That's how they still saw him?</p><p>This discovery was quickly becoming a curse. </p><p> </p><p>Weeks went by but there was no invitation. Not from Potter. Not from anyone. It wasn't as if Draco would've said yes to anyone for a date. For ages now, he'd only had his heart set on one boy. </p><p>
  <i>His stupid, foolish, naive heart. </i>
</p><p> </p><p>For Easter weekend Hogwarts was almost deserted. Draco found Potter sitting alone in the Great Hall for lunch; he approached him and sat across. </p><p>"Malfoy," Potter said, looking startled. He'd started to smile but apparently thought better of it. </p><p>"Potter." </p><p>"Need something?" </p><p>"Maybe." </p><p>"And what's that?"</p><p>"I'm not a snake." Potter immediately stiffened but Draco trudged on. "If you fancy me, then do something about it." </p><p>Snake or no snake, at least Draco wasn't cowardly.</p></div>
