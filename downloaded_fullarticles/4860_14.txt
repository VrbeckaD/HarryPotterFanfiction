    <p>“It’s too quiet,” James hissed, then tried to poke Sirius but ended up elbowing him in the stomach.</p><p> </p><p>“Oof,” Sirius let out, but did not complain further. He agreed with James, and was looking around for a sign of danger. They had not heard a single Professor patrolling, nor seen a sign of Filch and his fucking cat.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you on about?” Remus whispered. He had barely heard his friend speak as he was using all of his brainpower to calm down and <em>not</em> think about how, at the age of seventeen, the Marauders were too big to all fit comfortable under the cloak and he was pressed flush against Sirius. He decided to ignore whatever James would answer - who cared anyway - and proceeded to make a list of the least sexual things he could think of.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Don’t get a hard-on, don’t get a hard-on. McGonagall’s nose. Dumbledore’s nose-hair. Peter playing the trombone in Third Year, until they made him stop.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Of course, his friends would not accept his silence, not for long. They wouldn’t just let him be quiet and <em>think.</em> Oh no, that wouldn’t do. He was expected to not only go along with them, but also actively participate. Sirius was looking at him in a weird way, obviously expecting a response to whatever they had told him while he was busy listening to himself making a list in his head.</p><p> </p><p>“Er— What?” the werewolf asked sheepishly.</p><p> </p><p>James rolled his eyes. Remus knew he had been doing this more and more lately, spacing out and thinking very, very inappropriate thoughts about one of his best mates. Thoughts that should never be conjured up in his mind, let alone outside of the safe confines of his four-poster bed.</p><p> </p><p>Before either of the dark-haired boys could answer Remus, Peter squeaked in the dirty blond’s pocket.</p><p> </p><p>They were almost at the Transfiguration classroom where the prank was to be executed. But right outside of it stood Filch, petting Mrs. Norris. He clearly was not taking a quick break as he walked. No, he was waiting in front of that door with purpose. They had not told anyone about their plans for tomorrow, so Remus could not imagine how Filch knew to guard it.</p><p> </p><p>“Bollocks,” James whispered as angrily as he could, “I knew it. It was too easy to get here. We didn’t even run into a Prefect.”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe Wormtail can distract them? If Mrs. Norris runs after him—” Sirius started, then stopped suddenly, after a quick sound as if he had been punched in the gut. His eyes were wide and his face scrunched up. When Remus looked down, he saw why. Peter had bit his finger. “Merlin’s <em>balls</em> Pete, it was a <em>suggestion,”</em> Sirius hissed, glaring down at the Animagus.</p><p> </p><p>“I actually like that idea,” James whispered, nodding as he thought about it, eyes darting across the floor as he visualized his plan. Peter froze, but did not attempt to bite anyone again. “If I summon my broom, I can fly quickly enough to get in there even if Filch comes right back. With the cloak, we would be invisible so he would never even know that we got in.</p><p> </p><p>“How would we get out, genius?” Remus asked quietly.</p><p> </p><p>James frowned. Sirius was still staring at his bit finger irritatedly.</p><p> </p><p>“We fly out of the window, of course,” the bespectacled boy answered with an eyebrow raised in mocking.</p><p> </p><p>Peter went as deep as he could inside Remus’ pocket. It was uncomfortable but at least a rodent being that close to his cock ensured that the werewolf would not get any unwarranted erections any time soon. He felt bad for his friend. Animagus or not, it could not be fun, being chased by a cat, especially one like Mrs. Norris.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think Wormtail’s quite comfortable with that,” he said carefully, hoping James and Sirius would decide to be kind, for once. They had calmed down considerably in the last few months, especially after Lily had started giving James the time of day.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m the ring leader,” James whispered solemnly, “What I say gets done.”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe we can scare her in a different way,” Remus said, an idea suddenly coming to him. “Prongs, summon your broom.”</p><p> </p><p>They stepped back far enough to be out of Filch’s sight, then James quietly whispered: “Accio my broom.”</p><p> </p><p>After almost a minute which James and Sirius spent being bored while Remus shifted uncomfortably, they finally heard the whooshing sound of James’ broom approaching. After years of getting up to tomfoolery that ended them in detention on a weekly basis, you would have thought the werewolf stopped getting anxious, but he still hadn’t. He was glad for it, though, as it gave him the adrenaline that he so wanted.</p><p> </p><p>“Ready?” he whispered, looking at James grab his broom swiftly in one hand.</p><p> </p><p>The Animagus nodded. Sirius was looking at the werewolf with raised eyebrows, a mixture of amusement and expectation written on his face.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Great, that’s what I need. Sirius Black staring at me. Because I’m not nervous enough. I said I liked danger and adrenaline, not the feeling of wanting to crawl into a hole and disappear.</em>
</p><p>He shook his head like a dog, and turned his head so that he could no longer see Sirius, even in his peripheral vision. They walked over again, close enough to see Filch.</p><p>“Aguamenti!”</p><p> </p><p>Mrs. Norris’ yowl could potentially be heard from the Slytherin dungeons, it was so loud. Sirius started snickering, and put a hand over his mouth in an attempt to be quiet. The cat kept screaming while Filch, shocked and worried, tried to calm her.</p><p>“It’s alright, love, it’s alright. We’ll get you dry in no time.”</p><p> </p><p>He was too worried about Mrs. Norris to think about <em>how</em> she had gotten wet in the first place. By the time his brain kicked into gear and he thought of it, the four boys were already inside the Transfiguration classroom.</p><p> </p><p>It had taken them months to perfect this charm. Well, come up with it at any rate, they still were not sure whether or not it would work, especially with McGonagall present. They had mixed a warding spell that did not allow transfiguration of any kind with a detection one that transfigured any already-transfigured item into something else to allow identification. Aurors used the latter one to find hidden objects in a room, by making every transfigured object turn into, say, a big red Quaffle, then collecting them and identifying whatever was hidden in the first place.</p><p>The Marauders, of course, had less pure intentions.</p><p> </p><p>They had mixed the spells to not exactly stop a transfiguration, but to trigger the detection spell to essentially make it so that whatever a student tried to transfigure in the classroom would end up as a taco. The thought of McGonagall at first believing that the students were simply being daft until she noticed the prank was quite hilarious, not to mention the challenge in creating the charm had been exhilarating. Wards and detections, usually used for defense against the Dark Arts, were Remus’ specialty.</p><p> </p><p>Ten minutes later the spell was complete and they were ready to leave. Unfortunately, one thing they had miscalculated was how high the Transfiguration classroom was and how, even with Peter transformed, three boys would be much too heavy to reasonably fly with, a hundred feet off the ground. The risk of falling when sneaking into the classroom had been small, but falling to their death did not seem like a grand idea.</p><p> </p><p>“I can take you one by one,” James reasoned, “That should work.”</p><p> </p><p>They all agreed, and James started with Peter. Only after they had left did Sirius think of the obvious mistake that they had made. “Could have taken Peter and one of us,” he said with a sigh. He was anxious to leave, now that they were done. He didn’t handle being in one spot for too long well.</p><p> </p><p>So they waited.</p><p> </p><p>And waited.</p><p> </p><p>And waited.</p><p> </p><p>Almost fifteen minutes passed before they finally had to accept that, in all likelihood, their two friends had been caught and had been taken back to the dormitory, as well as gotten detention for sneaking out after hours. They could only hope that whoever had caught them was female and would not check to see if their beds were empty or not.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius looked down the window. “The bridge is right there,” he said thoughtfully, “Maybe we can jump, then try to land on it after a cushioning spell of sorts?”</p><p> </p><p>The werewolf walked over to see. He looked down. “‘RIGHT THERE’?” he repeated, unable to keep his voice down. Then he looked behind him to see if the door would open to reveal an angry Filch. It did not. He sighed. “It is at least, what, a hundred and twenty feet away? I don’t want to die, Padfoot.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then we wait until breakfast time,” Sirius said quickly, looking Remus up and down, as if gauging whether or not the werewolf would make it.</p><p> </p><p>Remus tried very hard not to think about the fact that, in his haste to look down the window, he had not noticed that he was now<em> right next to</em> Sirius and <em>oh</em> their arms were touching. Through robes, but still. He felt his heart beat faster.</p><p> </p><p>They spent the next hour chatting about random things. First the prank, then the upcoming winter break, then the full moon and where they could go during it. Perhaps the path to centaurs, if they were lucky enough to be let in.</p><p> </p><p>Soon, though, the Animagus was too bored to be entertain by mere words, and the conversation died off. Remus started reading a book that he had in his robe pocket, despite Sirius snorting at the sight.</p><p> </p><p>“Have you ever gotten a handjob, Moony?” Sirius asked suddenly.</p><p> </p><p>“Wh—I—<em>What?”</em> the werewolf spluttered, feeling his face redden. He knew how to keep a straight face, but could not quite stop blood from rushing to it.</p><p> </p><p>“A handjob. You know. Pretty self-explanatory I had thought, but—”</p><p> </p><p>Remus cut him off. “I know what a handjob is,” he said, irritated and embarrassed.</p><p> </p><p>There was a moment of silence.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought since, you know, you went ’round with that one bloke. Davies.”</p><p> </p><p>“Not all of us are slutty like you, Sirius. It was only a week. We did not quite get that far.”</p><p> </p><p>“He was ripped,” Sirius commented in a far-away voice, “I would’ve thought you got your hands on that as soon as possible.” It wasn’t entirely untrue. Davies was the Hufflepuff Quidditch captain and did have, indeed, an amazing body.</p><p> </p><p>Just not the one Remus wanted.</p><p> </p><p>“You could, you know,” Sirius said quietly. “Get a handjob.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you trying it on with me, Padfoot?” Remus asked incredulously.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe, yeah,” Sirius said casually, as if it was the most normal thing in the world. Which it decidedly was not, Remus thought.</p><p> </p><p>“This is not going to be one of those times where you talk and I think we’re having a conversation when in fact you have been quoting muggle songs at me the whole time?”</p><p>Sirius barked out a laugh, breaking the slight tension between them. “I solemnly swear I am not quoting Sex Pistols.”</p><p> </p><p>“Were you— Were you offering?” Remus said nervously, heart beating so fast he was sure - <em>sure</em> - it would jump out of his chest any moment now.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Sirius said, voice quiet again, “I’ll give you a handjob. Or a blowie. Might even let you irrumate me.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so <em>invective</em> Padfoot,” Remus laughed, “I regret ever teaching you that word.”</p><p> </p><p>“You taught me so I could offer myself for the job.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus couldn’t help but chuckle. “I don’t know about irrumation, but I’ll take the handjob.”</p><p> </p><p>“C’mere then,” Sirius said.</p><p> </p><p>And Remus did.</p>
