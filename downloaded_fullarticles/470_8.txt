    <p>
  <span>It was February of 1965 when it happened. Remus, your best friend since birth it seemed, had invited you to stay over with him while your parents, Aurors, were off on a mission together. This wasn’t an uncommon occurrence, you knew your parents had to work and didn’t hold it against them. They were just providing for you. They loved you.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus’ father, on the other hand, worked at the Ministry of Magic and was attempting to get Fenrir Greyback, who had killed two young children, sent to Azkaban. However, he’d been released on a technicality. Lyall was outraged at this and publicly refuted the werewolf., saying he deserved nothing but death. Unfortunately for you and Remus, he decided to exact his revenge, but not on Lyall. No, that wouldn’t have been painful enough. Instead, he targeted Remus, and by extension, you.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The night had started fine. You and Remus stayed up later than you were supposed to, quietly giggling at each other’s jokes, and talking, telling stories. You didn’t even notice the werewolf outside the window until it had forced its’ way in. You shrieked, terrified. You gripped your best friend as the beast grew closer, snarling, until it finally lunged, latching onto your joint arms, infecting the both of you. Lyall burst into the room, wand at the ready, and managed to force the beast away from Remus and you. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But the damage was already done. The Lupins tried everything to help Remus and you, seeing as your parents had died on their latest assignment, but nothing worked. You were werewolves, and there was nothing that could be done. The first transitions were the worst, as you were unused to the pain, not that you would ever become used to it, but at least you had Remus. The Lupins would set aside a small patch of forest for the two of you to transform, warding it off so that no one would stumble upon a couple of werewolves and know what had happened to the youngest Lupin and his best friend.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Six years later, Remus would be sent to Hogwarts for his first year, while you, a year younger than him, stayed home with the Lupins. Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, was kind enough to even let Remus in, let alone set aside space for his monthly transformations. He was sorted into the Gryffindor house, the house known for their bravery and determination. You could think of no better place for him. As for your house when you entered the next year… Hufflepuff, though it never stopped you from seeing him anyway. None of the other students from your house minded the Gryffindor hanging around the common room or vice versa. You were well liked among the Gryffindors, especially Remus’ friends: James Potter, who seemed to be the leader, Sirius Black, a pureblooded wizard out to spite his family, and Peter Pettigrew, a shorter blonde boy who usually stood to the side and cheered his friends on rather than join in on the fun. They could be considered troublemakers, but you liked them anyway. There were an interesting bunch, to say the least.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Years later, Remus and the rest of the Marauders had graduated, leaving you at Hogwarts for your last year. It was significantly less interesting, though you did get to attend the wedding of James and Lily Potter. After that year, James and Lily had conceived the first of what everyone thought would be many children. Unfortunately, the year after that, they were brutally killed by He-who-must-not-be-named: Lord Voldemort. Sirius, accused of betraying the Potters as their secret keeper, ran, but couldn’t outrun Peter Pettigrew, who cornered him in an alleyway, proving his guilt by sacrificing his own life. Sirius was sent to Azkaban for the murder of Peter Pettigrew as well as a dozen Muggle bystanders. Rumors say he laughed as he did it. Sent to Peter’s family was nothing but a finger, all they could find of him. Harry was sent to live with his Muggle Aunt, Uncle, and cousin, the Dursley’s.</span>

<p>
  <span>And that brings us to now. </span>
