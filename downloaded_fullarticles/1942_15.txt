She was an assistant librarian, and she liked it well enough. It was not glamorous or exciting, but Miriam Susan Smith, who went by Miriam in Laving but still though of herself as Sue, was not a particularly glamorous or exciting person.</p><p>Sue felt the work suited her. She enjoyed being surrounded by books, even if, contrary to popular opinion, she had too much to do to allow reading during the work day. She enjoyed helping people find what they needed. She enjoyed the quiet. It was a simple job that allowed for plenty of time to let her mind wander and daydream, while her hands did their routine work by rote. She liked that most of all.</p><p>Sue had lived in Laving for nearly a year. Except for one or two day trips to see the Alamo and the like, she had spent the entire time within the county lines. In her imagination, she explored many worlds, but in her daily life, her routine was the rule and hardly ever varied.</p><p>She had a few acquaintances in the town, but no real friends, and no family. If Sue did not go in to work, she might not speak a word to a single soul. For the most part her thoughts dwelled between the pages of books; above all she tried never to think about her life before Laving. This had been her way of existing for some time, and she expected it would continue to be so for the foreseeable future.</p><p>That period of time, however, is generally a much shorter one than most people suppose.</p><p>On Thursdays the library closed at eight; at ten minutes to the hour, Sue conducted her customary closing routine, checking the restrooms and the stacks for any dawdlers, collecting stray books, shutting off computer monitors, so on and so forth. The Laving library was a small one, but even so, usually Sue had to usher out at least one or two people at closing time. On this evening, however, the library was deserted. Even the other full time librarian who usually closed the library with Sue on Thursday evenings was gone; she’d left earlier complaining of a stomachache.</p><p>Alone, Sue switched off the lights, put on her coat, and carefully tied her scarf over her frizzy, pale curls. At the entrance she paused to admire the stillness of the dark, empty building. The lack of sound other than that of her own body’s tick of life was so total, she fancied it had an aura all its own, humming just barely beyond the level of human perception. She could hear nothing, not the radiator nor the wind rattling in the eaves, not even a passing car or a night bird’s call from outside.</p><p>The other full-time librarian often complained that the silence of the empty library at night gave her the creeps, but Sue obtained an odd thrill from the sensation. In that moment, she was perfectly content with her current existence, of which she had approximately seventeen minutes left to enjoy.</p><p>Sue set the alarm, locked the doors and left the building at 8:01 p.m. At that same moment, the driver of the car that would end her life, Lori Smith (no relation), was scolding her Chihuahua puppy, Tito, who was once again chewing on the upholstery in the backseat of her car. Distracted by the damage to her pleather seat cushions, Lori ran a stop sign. Fortunately for Lori and Tito, no one was coming. Unfortunately for Sue, now walking down the flagstone steps and thinking vaguely of dinner, Lori and Tito continued on their way without incident.</p><p>Night had fallen; the sky was cloudy, the air cool and smelling of rain. Sue looked up at the sky, hoping for a glimpse of stars, but the clouds were thick and total overhead, like a dark wet blanket. A chilly, damp breeze stirred the ends of her scarf and made the hem of her coat flap against her knees. Sue sighed. She could practically feel her hair frizzing, even with the scarf covering it.</p><p>Sue walked slowly out of the parking lot and down the sidewalk, her hands in her coat pockets and her head down, watching her feet. She fingered the mp3 player in her pocket, but decided against it. Instead, as she approached the corner where she would turn onto Brewer Street, she picked up the thread of her current favorite daydream. Brewer Street had no sidewalk, so Sue stepped over the curb and into the street heading downhill, lost in her imagination. It was now 8:16 p.m. She had approximately three minutes left.</p><p>Sue reached the bottom of the hill and paused automatically at the intersection to look for traffic. Behind her, Lori’s car crested the hill. Tito, whether by fate or merely poor timing, chose this moment to sink his teeth into the back seat once again and tug enthusiastically. Lori’s head whipped around at the sound of squeaky Chihuahua growls and tearing fabric.</p><p>“No, Tito! Bad Tito! I SAID NO, BAD TITO!” Lori shrieked shrilly. Tito paid no notice.</p><p>Lori glanced back at the road just as Sue turned to face the approaching headlights, eyes wide. Lori’s car had drifted with her attention until it was all the way over on the left side of the road, with Sue directly in its path. Lori shrieked again and stomped the break, managing to avoid a head-on crash, but it had been raining. The car skidded on the slick road, back wheels continuing forward while front wheels locked, spinning the car broadside.</p><p>Sue did not even have time to scream before Lori’s car was upon her. The collision resembled a pinball stroke, with the pivoting car playing flipper and Sue starring as the hapless pinball. As the right passenger side suddenly filled her field of vision, she suddenly, inanely thought, <em>I will never finish re-reading </em><em><u>Harry Potter</u></em>, and felt a sharp stab of sincere regret.</p><p>Then she and the rear car door connected, and the pain blotted out all other concerns. Her arms, thrown out in an automatic, useless warding-off gesture, made contact first; her right wrist snapped, her left elbow dislocated with a dull pop. Less than a beat later her left hip socked into the door handle recess with a hot flare of agony, wrenching a high, inhuman shriek from her throat. Almost in the same instant her skull kissed briefly and violently with the window, leaving behind a white star of cracked safety glass like a lipstick mark.</p><p>Adrenaline flooded her brain, kicking it into a higher gear, where thoughts came in flashes of understanding beyond the speed of words or language. <em>I’m going to die,</em> Sue realized. <em>Not eventually, but right now, this fucking minute, I’m about to die.</em></p><p>As Sue’s feet left the ground and her body went flying backward through the air, a face flared to brilliant life in her mind’s eye. It was a face she had never seen, yet she knew it immediately, recognized it with a burst of surprised delight from a thousand hazy fantasies and imagined exchanges.</p><p>She saw every detail in astonishing clarity, from the dark eyebrows and darker eyes to the large, aquiline nose, thin lips fixed in a scowl, and strong, blunt chin. Sue saw even details she had never pictured clearly before: his eyes, for example, were not quite black after all, but so dark and deep a brown that his pupil could hardly be distinguished from his iris. His eyelashes were thick and short, a black fringe along the line of each eyelid, made more striking by the pallor of his skin. The oily black, pin-straight hair, just long enough to brush his shoulders in the back and a bit shorter around his face and sharp jawline, was parted slightly to the right, not dead center as she had always imagined. Although it looked as though it could do with a wash, it was neatly combed.</p><p>It occurred to Sue dimly that she was only having a vivid hallucination, brought on by a possibly fatal head injury. But that hardly seemed important, enthralled as she was by the vision. It was so real! Every line and pore of the man’s face, each individual hair and crease of flesh, stood out in vivid detail. There was a glow all around him, framing his features like some sort of ill-tempered, gloomy angel; despite the fact that she was very aware of her own imminent grisly death, Sue nearly laughed aloud at the idea. As if in response, the man’s dark scowl deepened further.</p><p>Sue realized that her eyes were closed. The passage of time stretched like warm taffy as Sue fell, each moment expanding into a small eternity; or perhaps it was her consciousness that had expanded, surpassing linear thought to perceive several layers of reality at once. Shouldn’t she have hit the ground by now? Was it ironic that she was spending her last few seconds mooning over a lovesick vision of a deceased fictional character, or just horribly pathetic?</p><p>Sue decided that it did not matter in the slightest. She was filled all at once with a sweet and aching sadness, a deep regret that this was the closest she had ever, would ever come to fulfilling her secret, shameful longing. She was flooded with an overpowering, warm rush of affection for her vision, no less real for all its object’s fictionality.</p><p>Though the man’s features seemed to Sue the most perfect in this universe and possibly in several neighboring ones, she could plainly see that they were worn and tired. There were heavy bags under his eyes and his skin was sallow and wan over his hollowed cheeks, as if he hadn’t been eating or sleeping properly for some time. Sue’s heart swelled painfully in her throat, throbbing with a mute passion too huge to give sound. Her whole being stretched out in yearning in response to the weary bitterness she glimpsed in the pinched set of his pale, lined face.</p><p>What she would give to be able to do something to help him, even the tiniest bit! <em>What </em>wouldn’t<em> I give, </em>she thought,<em> for just the chance, one fucking chance, to try? </em>She had only ever wanted one other thing as much as she wanted <em>this</em>, and that too had been an impossible wish.</p><p>For every force there is an equal opposing force. The velocity of Sue’s flight after being struck by the car should have landed her in the street nearly twenty feet away from the intersection where she had stood. But Sue did not land there at all. Instead, Sue felt something <em>shift </em>deep inside her, like an unused muscle suddenly clenching, straining with the effort to contract.</p><p>That well-loved face vanished like a star winking out in the dawn; Sue had a brief glimpse of a long line of doors, all shapes and sizes and colors, all flying wide open at once. The many doorways grew and stretched like dark mouths opening up, bleeding together to swallow her; she flew headlong towards the black, but before she reached it, Sue passed out.</p><p>________________________________________________________________</p><p>Lori Smith’s car finally skidded to a stop, facing almost 180 degrees opposite its original course. Lori opened her door and climbed out, shaking. Slowly, reluctantly, she turned to look at the carnage she knew was behind her.</p><p>But nothing was there.</p><p>Lori stared, then rubbed her eyes and stared some more. She stood there for a moment, stunned, then turned abruptly and dove back into her car, scrabbling for the flashlight in her glove compartment. She fumbled and almost dropped it, but finally managed to turn it on and train it on the road behind her car.</p><p>Lori searched up and down Brewer Street and Poppy Lane in both directions of the intersection, then in the ditches, and then finally in the yards of the houses on either side. Minutes passed and became hours. Lori found the woman’s scarf, lying in the middle of the street, and one shoe in the ditch which might or might not have been the woman’s, but the woman herself was nowhere to be found. Lori finally went back to her car and checked it all over, thinking perhaps she had somehow imagined the whole thing.</p><p>But no. The flashlight beam revealed a cracked window and a definite dent in the right rear side of her car, much bigger than any of the car’s many other dings and scrapes. She had clearly struck something large.</p><p>And she <em>remembered </em>hitting the woman. She had <em>seen </em>her caught in the headlight beams like the proverbial deer. The ghastly thunk of her body bouncing off the side of the vehicle had struck Lori’s ears as hard a physical blow. She could not possibly have imagined that. Could she?</p><p>Lori ran her thumb over the new spider-webbed star marring the rear passenger window glass, lost in thought. When she closed her eyes she saw the woman’s head striking the window and bouncing off, again and again, bushy hair flying free of her scarf and obscuring her face.</p><p>Yet the woman was gone.</p><p>In the back seat, Tito chewed happily on the frayed seat cushions.</p><p align="CENTER"> </p>
