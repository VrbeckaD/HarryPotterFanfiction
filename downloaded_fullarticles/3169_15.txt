Why should I play this game of pretend?<br/>
Remembering through a secondhand sorrow?<br/>
Such a great son and wonderful friend<br/>
Oh, don't the tears just pour?</p><p>[harry talking about sirius, shes in the anger phase of grief]<br/>
I could curl up and hide in my room<br/>
There in my bed, still sobbing tomorrow<br/>
I could give in to all of the gloom<br/>
But tell me, tell me what for</p><p>Why should I have a heavy heart?<br/>
Why should I start to break in pieces?<br/>
Why should I go and fall apart for you?</p><p>Why should I play the grieving girl and lie<br/>
Saying that I miss you<br/>
And that my world has gone dark without your light?<br/>
I will sing no requiem tonight</p><p>[dumbledore mourning about his failure over tom riddle]<br/>
I gave you the world, you threw it away<br/>
Leaving these broken pieces behind you<br/>
Everything wasted, nothing to say<br/>
So I can sing no requiem</p><p>[remus is remembering his time with james and sirius]<br/>
I hear your voice, I feel you near<br/>
Within these words, I finally find you<br/>
And now that I know that you are still here<br/>
I will sing no requiem tonight</p><p>[harry &amp; petunia questioning their grief]<br/>
Why should I have a heavy heart?</p><p>[harry questioning herself about snape]<br/>
Why should I say I'll keep you with me?<br/>
Why should I go and fall apart for you?</p><p>Why should I play the grieving girl and lie<br/>
Saying that I miss you<br/>
And that my world has gone dark without your light?<br/>
(I can see your light)</p><p>[draco honoring snape and lighting a candle for him]<br/>
I will sing no requiem<br/>
Tonight<br/>
'Cause when the villains fall, the kingdoms never weep<br/>
No one lights a candle to remember<br/>
No, no one mourns at all<br/>
When they lay them down to sleep</p><p>[harry and and petunia talking about snape and lilly]<br/>
So, don't tell me that I didn't have it right<br/>
Don't tell me that it wasn't black and white<br/>
After all you put me through<br/>
Don't say it wasn't true<br/>
That you were not the monster<br/>
That I knew</p></div>
