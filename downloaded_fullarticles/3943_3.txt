    <p>After the endless issues with Sokovia, the complications with Ultron, and the famed Civil War between him and Tony, Steve Rogers was beyond exhausted. The physical, psychological, and emotional strain during those hard times was nearly overwhelming. That's why when an employee of the Avengers Tower tossed a thick file at him one day on orders of a higher authority, he was beyond grateful for the much needed break from superhero work.<br/>
The file in question interested him for a personal reason. It was information about the Winter Soldier. Steve's job was to gather information on him and work on 'reviving' him. Ever since they found him and brought him to where he was safe and not a threat, the Avengers tried everything to restore even bits and pieces of his memory, to no avail. Steve’s heart broke over and over every day that he watched. The first day, when he mentioned Sarah, Steve's mother, putting newspaper into Steve’s shoes, Steve saw a glimmer of hope. But it was a seemingly false alarm.<br/>
Bucky was doing very well, though, even without his memory. He had begun adjusting to living his life with a HYDRA background and not a Howling Commandos one. He had been taken off of his feet as well for the time being, given easy puzzles to help gain back some lost intellect instead of having to endure the vigorous training that the rest of the heroes were going through.<br/>
Steve, desperate to rekindle their previous 1940s relationship, tried striking Bucky’s fancy across their desks. He didn't care whether or not it ended up being platonic or even romantic, as long as he had his James back. It was difficult at first. Bucky was significantly more shielded (pun intended) and cautious of those around him. But Steve had always been more stubborn than a bull, a fact evident in the countless scars he had gotten from fighting disrespectful boys in the streets.<br/>
And when Steve finally was lying with Bucky sprawled along the sofa in Steve’s room in the Tower, Bucky's head pressed against against Steve’s chest and hair like flames licking his body, Steve knew instantly that that glimmer of home he had felt before had returned.<br/>
“I guess history really does repeat itself,” he muttered to himself, gazing lovingly down once again at Bucky's sleeping form.</p>
