          <div class="userstuff"><p>Â </p><p>It's 1978, and "Werewolves of London" is a musical hit in the muggle world. Remus takes the lyrics hard, but the Marauders are there to cheer him up, make him feel like it normalizes lycanthropy.</p><p>James and Lily blast the record whenever the others come over, James reenacting the first verse with Remus through the living room.</p><p>
  <em>I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand, walking through the streets of SoHo in the rain</em>
</p><p>Sirius pulls Remus to his feet to dance, stretching his neck long to howl when the song does.</p><p>
  <em>AAWOOOOO Werewolves of London! AAWOOOO!</em>
</p><p>Peter giggling on the couch at Remus's red face. He's embarrassed but laughing.</p><p>
  <em>I saw a werewolf drinking a pina colada at Trader Vic's. His hair was perfect.</em>
</p><p>Moony is okay.</p><p align="center">-.-.-</p><p>It's 1982, and "Thriller" sweeps the world with its dark theme but fun choreography. Remus takes the lyrics hard, and there's no James and Lily to play it.</p><p>Sirius is not there to mimic the dance, finding funny ways to change the harsh words.</p><p>Peter is not on the couch, laughing at his embarrassment.</p><p>Moony is not okay.</p></div>
