    <p>“Ugh..” Harry moaned where he sat, head a blurry mess. He blinked, trying to get a sense of where he was and what was happening, every cell in his body screaming that he was in trouble.</p>
<p>“Oh, look who has joined us.”</p>
<p>That voice was familiar, too familiar. Harry shook his head and the world slowly cleared up around him. He looked up into a smug face.</p>
<p>“Riddle.”</p>
<p>Said person raised a hand, flattening an imaginary flaw in his immaculate black hair. “Good, I see my men didn’t manage to do any permanent damage. It would be terrible, for a man with your limited intelligence.”</p>
<p>“Oh, ha-ha.” Harry said, wondering what he had done wrong to be faced with the bastard Tom Riddle, of all people, first thing after waking up and with a head that throbbed with each heartbeat. “Still like to kick people while they are down, I see.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t need to, if they hadn’t been foolish enough to fall in the first place.”</p>
<p>That was right, Harry remembered why he was in that situation now. The expedition that filthy warlord was taking to find El Dorado, of all places. Harry had gone to beat him to the punch and make sure that the smug ass couldn’t get his hands on… whatever it was he was after. God knew what he hoped to find. Only they had expected him and Harry remembered being surrounded on both sides and then darkness. Judging by his throbbing head, someone must have bashed it good.</p>
<p>Harry glared at Riddle and the bastard had the audacity to look amused. That was usually Harry’s prerogative, after he stopped another of Riddle’s attempts to find ancient treasure that would help him take over the world.</p>
<p>“So what now? Did you bring me here so you could have the pleasure of killing me yourself?” He gave his head a nonchalant throw, regretting it when pain stabbed at him. “Then what are you waiting for?”</p>
<p>Riddle stood and looked down at him. “Oh, killing you would be such a waste. I have other plans for you.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah?” Harry said, lifting an eyebrow. “Well, get started then. We’re not getting any younger here.”</p>
<p>Riddle laughed a silky laugh that did more to Harry’s nether regions than he wanted to admit.</p>
<p>“So impatient. But you’ll have to wait until I get back. There’s this annoying pest – other than you – that’s following in my footsteps, and it wouldn’t do to welcome him without a party.”</p>
<p>“You’re gonna have me wait here? Like this?!” Harry was incredulous. “It could take you days to find the place, much less..!” He shut his mouth, not willing to reveal that he didn’t have a clue as to <em>why</em><span> Riddle was there.</span> “What are you even keeping me for, anyway?”</p>
<p>Riddle was close now, Harry hadn’t noticed when he crossed the short distance in the tent and stood right in front of him.</p>
<p>“What am I going to do?” There was a gleam to his eyes that Harry did most certainly <em>not </em><span>like. “I’m going to continue what you started in the cave of Aphrodite.”</span></p>
<p>“<span>What I started? You mean making a fool out of you, once again?”</span></p>
<p>There was a twitch of an eyebrow which indicated that Harry had successfully annoyed Riddle. He took it as a win, because in that situation there wasn’t much to celebrate. The expression was quickly replaced by that of a cat about to pounce. Harry didn’t like that.</p>
<p>“<span>Don’t you remember?” Riddle leaned closer, his mouth close enough to touch Harry’s ear. “You rushed over to me and asked to </span><span>that I do some less than savoury things to you</span><span>. Right there and then.” Harry was frozen. Riddle pulled back, enjoying Harry’s shell-shocked expression. “And that’s exactly what I’m going to do. </span><span>You won’t be able to walk for a week once I’m done with you.</span><span>”</span></p>
<p>Harry’s breath stuttered at the thought. “No...” He said, shaking his head, clearing it. “I’ve never said anything like that to you! I wouldn’t touch you even with a five foot stick! As a matter of fact, you are much too close right now!”</p>
<p>“<span>Why, are you getting aroused?” </span><span>Strong fingers gripped Harry’s chin, a long finger tracing his jawbone. “</span><span>There was a time when you claimed to feel nothing for me but hate, but we both know that isn’t true.”</span></p>
<p>Harry tried to pull his head out of the grip. “It is true! I feel nothing but hate for you!”</p>
<p>“<span>Back in that cave,” Riddle said, voice low and velvety, “I held the staff of Aphrodite. You know what it does, right?” Harry knew,</span><span> but the warlord told him anyway.</span><span> “It makes those who are chosen by it </span><span>act on</span><span> their inner desires,” Riddle said, “and I decided to test it on you. </span><span>Do you know what you did?</span><span>”</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Harry remembered that much, but after there was a blur until he had blinked and found himself standing much too close to Riddle, before Hermione had been there and pulled him away. </span>
  <span>He didn’t know what had happened and was dearly hoping that Riddle wasn’t about to tell him.</span>
</p>
<p>“<span>You rushed over to me, in front of all my men, and you grabbed my lapels, clinging to me for dear life. And then you said, </span><em>whined</em><span> even, ‘Tom, please take my virginity.’”</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Harry felt sick. </span>
  <span>There was a part of him, a dirty, hidden part, that found something </span>
  <span>incredibly attractive</span>
  <span> in Tom Riddle. </span>
  <span>But no matter what attraction he might feel he wouldn’t act on it, because Riddle was a moral-less bastard who sold weapons to both sides in a war and used this as a step to further his goals. And Harry had long since decided that he would do his part to mess up the man’s plans. </span>
  <span>Getting in bed with him had never been a part of that.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>R</span>
  <span>iddle was enjoying his reaction too much, one hand on Harry’s t</span>
  <span>h</span>
  <span>igh – when had that got there? – and the other still gripping his chin, making sure Harry couldn’t turn away. </span>
</p>
<p>“No..” Harry said, “You’re making this up!”</p>
<p>“<span>I’m not. I have no need for lies.” His fingers were caressing Harry’s leg now, moving upwards. “And while you might deny it, you</span><span>r</span><span> body is being honest.”</span></p>
<p>Hot lips engulfed Harry’s, pulling them into a bruising kiss that overwhelmed the younger. As that clever tongue made it’s was into his mouth Harry couldn’t help the moan that started deep in his throat. He was embarrassed to find that Riddle’s pushy manners were arousing him. Being tied up didn’t exactly help either.</p>
<p>When Riddle finally pulled back, he did so with a look of utmost satisfaction. The hand still resting on Harry’s thigh twitched, getting the briefest of touches to Harry’s hardening member.</p>
<p>“<span>Well…</span><span> I should go, before I change my mind. But don’t you worry, I’ll be sure to take your virginity once I’m back.”</span></p>
<p>
  <span>S</span>
  <span>tartled and panicked by the whole situation Harry blurted out “I’m not </span>
  <span>one </span>
  <span>anymore.”</span>
</p>
<p>The rage that clouded Riddle’s face was terrifying. Harry had only seen it once, and then he had been well out of range.</p>
<p>“<span>Say that again.”</span></p>
<p>“I’m..” Harry swallowed. “I’m not a virgin anymore...”</p>
<p>
  <span>H</span>
  <span>arry’s leg hurt from where Riddle was squeezing it. “</span>
  <span>Is that so? Then won’t you kindly tell me who the lucky man was?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry shook his head. He wasn’t going to tell Riddle anything, because of two reasons. First, judging by that expression the warlord was going to kill whomever he mentioned, and second, it wasn’t actually true. </span>
  <span>Harry had had his dalliances with some girls, but he had never been with a man. Up until that moment he hadn’t even shared so much as a kiss with one. </span>
</p>
<p>“<span>Harry…</span><span>” Riddle’s eyes were fixated on his face. “Tell me.”</span></p>
<p>
  <span>H</span>
  <span>arry shook his head. “What’s it to you, anyway!?”</span>
</p>
<p>“<span>Do you think I will be denied that which was promised to me? You,” he practically hissed the word, “promised it to me.”</span></p>
<p>“You can’t take the word of someone under a spell seriously!” Harry snapped back.</p>
<p>“<span>Spell or not, it was mine to take!” His grip tightened even further. “So you will tell me!”</span></p>
<p>“It doesn’t belong to you! And it’s mine to give to whomever I please, when I’m ready!”</p>
<p>Riddle opened his mouth to answer and froze, the rage slowly sliding into glee. “You lied... You haven’t done it yet.”</p>
<p>
  <span>S</span>
  <span>hit. Harry realised his mistake too late.</span>
</p>
<p>“Well, then,” Riddle let go of Harry and rose up to his full height. “I think it’s time I stopped letting you distract me. We’ll have plenty of time for that after I get back.”</p>
<p>He moved towards the exit.</p>
<p>“Wait!” Harry shouted. “Come on, you can’t leave me here! Take me with you. I can be helpful...” he didn’t add the fact that he wouldn’t be.</p>
<p>“<span>That’s sweet, Harry, but I really must insist you wait here. God knows you would probably find a way to slither out of your bonds otherwise. But don’t worry,” he winked, “I’ll leave you in the company of one of my most loyal guards. You can keep each other company.”</span></p>
<p>
  <span>And then he was gone and Harry was alone with his inner turmoil. </span>
  <span>Had he known things would turn out like this he would have found another way. Riddle had revealed things Harry was not comfortable with knowing. </span>
  <span>He could barely handle knowing that he was attracted to Riddle, much less that it was apparently </span>
  <span>very much </span>
  <span>mutual.</span>
</p>
<p>Luckily – or not – Harry didn’t need to stay in his turmoil for very long because his guard entered the tent.</p>
<p>“Geh.” Harry said.</p>
<p>“I assure you, Potter, the feeling is mutual.” The slow voice of Severus Snape drawled. He was Riddle’s right hand man and a real jerk, if you asked for Harry’s opinion. Where Riddle had always seemed to hold a strange sort of amusement toward Harry, even after he got in the warlord’s way time after time, Snape only held contempt for Harry.</p>
<p>Like always, he was eyeing him like one would look at a bug, and deciding whether or not to crush it beneath his boot. And right at that moment it wouldn’t be hard, considering Harry was completely helpless. But he was also pretty sure that Snape wouldn’t dare to do anything that went against his master’s orders. <em>Pretty</em> being he keyword. The slimy git might just decide that he would better serve Riddle by getting rid of Harry. The man had never been one to simply follow orders.</p>
<p>“Get out and get another guard! Anyone else would do!”</p>
<p>Snape’s eyes narrowed. “Much as I’d love to this role has been ordered for me, specifically. I’ve been told not to let you out of my sight.”</p>
<p>“Please,” Harry scoffed, “Like I haven’t seen you going against orders a million times!”</p>
<p>“There are orders and then there are <em>orders</em>, Potter. It would do you much good to learn to differentiate.” The man sat down on the chair Riddle had vacated, running a hand over his greasy hair, pushing it back even further.</p>
<p>Harry felt like arguing that just saying the word twice didn’t give it any specific meaning, but that would mean he had to talk to the git even more, and it just wasn’t worth it. Instead he huffed and looked the other way, turning his head to the right.</p>
<p>“Good, you can be quiet. Stay that way.”</p>
<p>Harry bit his teeth together, refusing to be goaded.</p>
<p>An hour later and his neck was hurting, pain shooting up his spine and nudging the base of his brain. He really ought to turn his head, but doing so would mean he ended up having Snape in his line of sight. Harry stubbornly kept staring right.</p>
<p>It really hurt, though. Harry winced as pain burst, making his head feel like it was under attack. Maybe this could be his protection, if he told Riddle he had a headache. Harry let out a bitter chuckle, there was no way that was going to work on Riddle. If anything it might even get him going.</p>
<p>“What are you laughing at, boy?” Snape snapped, sounding frightfully annoyed. Maybe if Harry could push him enough he’d be kind enough to end his misery.</p>
<p>“The pathetic exc..!”</p>
<p>The loud bang of a firearm interrupted his insult and Snape swore, vaulting over toward Harry. Within a second Harry felt himself get thrown to the floor, chair and all.</p>
<p>“Goddamnit Snape, that hurts!” He yelled, pain lacing up his left arm and neck. The latter might have been his own fault, since the sudden movement had thrown his head around, and the sudden movement made it feel like something stretched.</p>
<p>“Quiet, Potter!” the man hissed, crouching above him. “As much as I loathe it, my lord would kill me if I let you be hurt… So,” he looked around, then started moving to the exit in a crouch, “be quiet and don’t go anywhere.”</p>
<p>“Oh, ha-ha.” Harry said. Snape gave him a lifted eyebrow before lifting the flap of the tent and sneaking out.</p>
<p>“Shit.” Harry said. The sound of battle outside was clear now, gunfire ringing through his ears. There was even a shot whizzing through the canvas, thankfully far above his head. But, Harry noted, approximately where his head would have been, had he still been upright.</p>
<p>Now then, while lying on the floor was fun, it wasn’t exactly a good plan. The chair had unfortunately not broken from his fall and Harry found himself just as stuck to it as he had been previously. He had a memory of seeing a knife on the desk. All it would take him would be a couple of skips and worm-like undulations. He could do that.</p>
<p>Raising his hips and pushing off with his feet, Harry managed to move himself forward. Perhaps no more than a centimetre, but that too was progress. Again.</p>
<p>As he did his slow shuffle Harry suddenly became aware that things had quieted down outside. There was the occasional shout of men, but no more shooting. That might have been a good thing, had it not been for the fact that anyone who dared to attack Riddle’s fully manned camp wouldn’t be anyone good. So at this point, Harry was pretty certain he was screwed, whether it be Riddle’s men or the attacker who had won. Screwed then, in two completely different meanings.</p>
<p>He shuffled on, trying to move faster. He had got so far as to reach the desk when the flap to the tent was opened, sending in a spray of wetness. Huh, was it raining outside?</p>
<p>Harry looked up as well as he could, noting immediately that it wasn’t Snape. The legs were much too shapely for that and the hips too wide.</p>
<p>“Well, well, what do we have here? An ickle baby being tied up and left all alone. And in the head-honcho’s tent, no less!” A shrill voice, tinged with madness. Oh no, Harry knew who that was.</p>
<p>A second pair of legs joined hers. “Well, darling, what do we have here?” Cloth rustled and Harry was suddenly face to upside-down face with Fenrir Greyback.</p>
<p>The bearded face was just as disgusting as Harry remembered, the hair untrimmed and wild, greasy and the remains of someone’s blood. Greyback grinned and it revealed his yellow teeth. The breath was atrocious.</p>
<p>“What happened to you, little man?”</p>
<p>Harry would have felt insulted, but in comparison to the bounty hunter, Greyback, most people were small. Harry had – gratefully – never had the pleasure of meeting him before, but his reputation far preceded him. Greyback was said to be ruthless when pursuing a bounty and just plain violent otherwise. He didn’t care if the person was old or a child, woman or man, if they got in his way he would take them down with all he had. Being in Riddle’s captivity seemed good in comparison.</p>
<p>“Uh,” Harry said and tried to go for a smile. He felt it came out rather crooked. “I seem to have been caught by Riddle. Any chance you could help me out?”</p>
<p>Greyback tilted his head in consideration.</p>
<p>“I know what he is!” A voice cackled behind him. Bellatrix Lestrange, Greyback’s second in command and even more dangerous than him, was jumping from foot to foot in excitement. Harry wondered why no one had ever put her into a mental institute, but figured no one had found it worth the trouble. “He must be Riddle’s boy!”</p>
<p>Greyback’s eyes narrowed. “Riddle’s boy, you say...”</p>
<p>“No, no, I am definitively not that!” Harry shook his head. “Look at me, I’m clearly not here of my own free will, right?”</p>
<p>“Think about it! He’s right here in Riddle’s tent, aaaaall wrapped up like a gift. And we saw Snapey coming out from this tent.” She cackled. “Now whyyyy would dear Riddle leave his most favourite henchy behind?”</p>
<p>The beard twitched as Bellatrix spoke. Greyback looked straight at Harry and now there was a gleam to his eyes that Harry did not like.</p>
<p>He shook his head. “Are you crazy! I told you, I’m not here of my own free will!”</p>
<p>“Well...” The bountyhunter lifted a long knife and scratched his beard with the tip of it. “I hear you, little man. But here’s the thing. My dear Bella is right. Here you are, all tied up like a turkey for thanksgiving, waiting in Riddle’s own tent with Snape as your personal guard. Even if you aren’t here willingly, there’s certainly something with you that means something to Riddle. And that,” he grinned wildly, “means it’ll be to our advantage.”</p>
<p>Grabbing Harry’s arm, ignoring the brunette’s shouts of no, you’re wrong, Greyback pulled him upright on the chair and proceeded to undo the ties. It was a great time to run, but the strong hand still gripping his arm made that impossible. And even if Harry had the strength to pull himself loose Bellatrix looked like she was itching for a fight and Harry really didn’t want to get into that. He had heard she liked to play dirty tricks.</p>
<p>“There, there, good boy...” Greyback said, pulling Harry up from the chair and grabbing his arms, tying them firmly behind his back. “Here, Bella, catch.”</p>
<p>Something flew through the air and the woman caught it deftly. A rope, and as Harry followed it back to its origin he realised that it led back to him. Bellatrix pulled it and Harry yelped as the force made him stumble and yanked him around. As she laughed Harry frowned over the being leashed like a dog.</p>
<p>“I think that’s all we have to get from here. Time to visit our friend Riddle, don’t you think?” Greyback said and ducked out of the tent.</p>
<p>Bellatrix giggled and followed him, rope pulling taunt and forcing Harry to walk out backwards. It was not an easy task and he really hoped she would see sense and at the least let him walk in front of her.</p>
<p>As he was led out ass-first, Harry didn’t quite see the carnage that surrounded them. When he was finally allowed to turn around and pushed in front of Bellatrix the sight made him gag. Riddle had no shortage of men and it looked like most of them were currently occupying the ground, lying where they had fallen. A couple closest to them had had their bellies split open and their guts were spilling out. Harry was glad he couldn’t see any details of those further off, because he was sure they were in a similar state.</p>
<p>Greyback laughed as Harry gagged. “Can’t believe Riddle would choose someone with such a weak stomach. I’ve seen places where he’s passed through that makes this look like a field of daisies.”</p>
<p>Harry was well aware of that, he had once seen Riddle punish a man for getting to the treasure before him. The sight had not been pretty and Harry hadn’t been able to sit by and do nothing. The end result… well, let’s just say getting blasted by the staff of Aphrodite hadn’t been in the plans. Hermione kept cursing him for being so reckless.</p>
<p>Speaking of Hermione, Harry hoped that she had the sense to keep hidden. His comrade didn’t need to get caught up in all of this. Harry thanked the stars she had been waiting back in camp while he scouted.</p>
<p>Greyback walked onwards, flanked by his men. Bellatrix gave Harry a push in the back.</p>
<p>“Time to go meet your lover boy~~” she sang and Harry didn’t even bother argue. He had a feeling it would just delight her.</p>
<p>Up ahead, Greyback kicked over a prone body. Harry recognised that greasy hair. The bounty hunter let out a loud guaff.</p>
<p>“Some second-in command, huh? Causing so much trouble and now you’re just as dead as the rest of them!” He kicked the corpse again and Harry blinked. Had it just twitched?</p>
<p>But no, the company moved on and it wasn’t moving, looking as dead as everyone else. Harry was just grateful Greyback had settled for a couple of kicks instead of ripping his guts open in front of them all. He didn’t think he would have been able to handle that.</p>
<p>The path through the excavation was rather easy to follow. Although it was old, Riddle had had his men clear the path and build walkways where the ground fell out. Even after the excavation site had ended doors stood open and no soldiers were waiting for them.</p>
<p>“So nice of him to show the way!” Greyback had laughed. “It’s almost like he’s welcoming us in!”<br/> Harry wouldn’t be so happy about that, if it was true. Riddle set mean traps.</p>
<p>So in the end they were able to just rush into the final chamber where Riddle was standing with his back to them, weighing something in his hand. Seeing him like that was frightfully familiar and Harry had not liked how it ended last time, not that he could remember much.</p>
<p>At the sound of their entrance the warlord and all his soldiers turned, weapons at the ready.</p>
<p>“Riddle, you sad excuse for a warlord!” Greyback called out, earning nothing but a raised eyebrow in return. “How about you tell your men to put their guns down and come over here, nice and easy.”</p>
<p>“Greyback, what a pleasant surprise.” Harry didn’t think he had ever heard Riddle speak in such monotone before. “Now why don’t you tell me why I should do that?”</p>
<p>Greyback pulled Harry forward and put a gun to his head. How lovely.</p>
<p>Riddle’s eyes met Harry’s and there was a brief tinge of irritation in his eyes. But when he addressed Greyback his voice was neutral.</p>
<p>“What, are you playing with hostages now? That’s a little beneath you, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Someone swore behind them and Harry turned his head enough to see that there were other’s behind them now, caging them between two parts of Riddle’s men. Oh, it was a trap. What an absolute surprise, Harry thought, sarcasm dripping.</p>
<p>“Tell your men to back off, or your little pet here won’t be so pretty no more!” Greyback roared, clearly taken aback by the situation. For a ruthless bounty hunter he really didn’t seem to consider his actions much. That was really no way to impress Tom Riddle.</p>
<p>The warlord just shrugged. “Go ahead, if you would like to die slowly.”</p>
<p>“Well,” Harry said, acting braver than he felt. “You guys are clearly at a stalemate. So how about you just handle this like gentlemen and duel it out? No need to involve anyone else.”</p>
<p>Riddles laugh was silky. “Oh Harry… this was never a stalemate.”</p>
<p>A loud bang echoed through the chamber and the hand holding the gun to Harry’s head exploded in blood and bone. Harry ducked and ran, throwing himself behind the first cover he could find as bullets rattled around him.</p>
<p>They were insane, certified insane the both of them. Working hard to saw his ropes against a sharp piece of the rubble, Harry glanced over his shoulder and saw Greyback fighting one-handed, firing his gun with ferocity. Riddle was… he was standing, practically out in the open and not even looking where he was firing, but Harry could bet his bullets hit their intended targets. Instead, the warlord was looking over at the point where Harry was crouching and then gave a small nod.</p>
<p>Shit. What did that mean? Harry sawed harder at his bonds, finally feeling them break when a shadow swept over him and he looked up at the figure of Severus Snape looking as casual as a person could be when standing literally in the middle of a gunfight.</p>
<p>“What?!” Harry croaked. “Weren’t you dead?!”</p>
<p>Snape grabbed his arm. “Come on then, Potter.”</p>
<p>Uh, Harry thought, I don’t think so.</p>
<p>He launched himself forward in a move that startled the older man, tearing through the remaining rope as he did so. Taking advantage of his element of surprise, Harry aimed another kick and then stepped over him and ran.</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure where he was going – the obvious exit being the entrance, but that was completely blocked off by Greyback’s men. Downstairs were Riddle and his men. Harry begged the gods that he hadn’t noticed what happened. However the chamber was large and there were strange holes in the wall. If only he could get high enough to reach them…</p>
<p>While broken and battered there was decorations around the room, tall statues of ancient men and demons alike. Now they made perfect stepping-stones as Harry jumped and flailed, clinging to the side and climbing. It took him time, more than he was comfortable with, and just as he reached the cave Harry noticed how quiet it had become in there. Hands gripping the cave floor and ready to pull himself up, Harry looked back.</p>
<p>Just like the camp had been, the chamber was now a site of massacre. It wasn’t as bad, but that was because Riddle clearly was the winner and he didn’t have any particular need to bathe in people’s guts. Not that Harry knew of. The man himself was standing where Greyback had last been, prodding at an unmoving body with his foot. As if sensing Harry’s eyes on him he slowly turned his head. Harry could have sworn that Riddle’s eyes glowed red in the dim light of the chamber. The warlord smiled.</p>
<p>“Come on down, my dear Harry. It’s safe now.”</p>
<p>Safe wasn’t the term Harry would use and there was something about those eyes that were different, and terrifying. He tightened his grip on the rock and pulled himself up, begging that the cave could lead him out. If it was a dead end Harry was lost.</p>
<p>Down below Riddle as walking in his direction without any sense of hurry. The smile on his face was one of fond amusement.</p>
<p>Harry stumbled into the cave, letting his eyes adjust to the darkness. He couldn’t see well, but as he went forward there were no obstacles in his way. “Oh thank god...” he mumbled.</p>
<p>Soon enough he was lost in the darkness but he could still hear an echo of movement from the chamber. There was no doubt that they were trying to follow him. Shit. He should have pushed harder and made that wobbly statue fall over. But there was no time to ponder, he was outnumbered and outgunned, didn’t even have his handy torch with him. There was nothing to do but continue.</p>
<p>Feeling his way along the walls Harry moved forward for an indefinite amount of time. There was a strange loud bang and after a while he couldn’t hear any sounds of pursuing and he slowed down, letting himself properly feel the way forward.</p>
<p>The darkness stretched forwards and backwards, making him feel like he had made a mistake. Who knew where that cave led? Just because it didn’t stop it didn’t mean that it would help him get to an exit. But the walls beneath his hands were smooth, as if they had been made by man. Surely that meant the path had a purpose and an exit.</p>
<p>More time passed and Harry walked and walked until he suddenly noticed a small spot of light ahead of him. The exit. He hurried his steps up, stumbling and almost tripping over an unknown obstacle in his hurry to get there. It hadn’t felt like a rock.</p>
<p>Harry paused and crouched, letting his hands feel the texture. Brittle and kept together by something that felt like cloth. Harry had an uneasy suspicion of what it was. But why…</p>
<p>The light up front was getting closer and it moved. Crap. A torch?</p>
<p>Fear of being caught by Riddle’s men had Harry flatten himself to the wall, trying to hide behind a pillar. He didn’t think it would work, they ought to have heard the rattle as he fell over the pile of bones, but if they were stupid enough to pass him by he could take them by surprise.</p>
<p>Waiting for the person to get closer seemed to take an eternity. There was something familiar with those steps, but Harry couldn’t quite put his finger on what. One of Riddle’s men that had been loyal for a long time, for sure.</p>
<p>They were close now and Harry pushed himself flat against the wall, muscles tensing. The light swept past him in an arc, not quite able to illuminate where he was standing. It flashed over the skeleton, wearing the remains of fancy cloth and plenty of jewellery, and stopped there. There was a gasp – once again, familiar – and the steps moved faster in a slight run.</p>
<p>Harry was halfway out when the person crouched down and he caught sight of a head of bushy hair. Harry stopped himself in the last minute, flinging himself to the side and landing on his shoulder. Shit that hurt.</p>
<p>“Hermione!” He said and the person turned to him, revealing the features of his friend. “What are you doing here?!”</p>
<p>He gasped as she flung herself around his neck, squeezing his aching shoulder and the air out of him.</p>
<p>“Harry! I can’t believe I found you!”<br/> “I can’t believe you’re here!” Harry said in return. “What are you doing here? It’s dangerous!”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “This wouldn’t be the first time I fought against Riddle, remember? I wasn’t about to leave you at his mercy.”</p>
<p>“But Greyback!” Harry argued. “We both know he’s completely crazy. He could just as easily have killed you if you had showed up!”</p>
<p>“Which is why I followed behind.” Hermione said, matter of factly. “And when they reached the chamber I found a way around, looking out at the action from one of the caves. Thank god you managed to get away in the scuffle. I don’t think me and my stun-darts would have been any good against the whole army.”</p>
<p>Harry hugged her again. “You have no idea how brilliant you are! Now, please tell me we can get out the same way you came?”</p>
<p>Hermione frowned. “I had to jump down to a lower cave to get here, you see all caves are connected to one directly opposite it. I managed to get lucky and find one where the wall had cracked enough for me to squeeze through. I don’t know if we will be able to get up that way.”</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. “It’s better than going back and running into the hands of Riddle. Let’s go check it out and we’ll see where to go when we get there.”</p>
<p>Harry rose to go, but Hermione stopped him. “Hold on, Harry. Have a look at this corpse!”</p>
<p>He crouched down next to her, looking it over. It looked like it had felt, like a pile of bones dressed in the remains of textile. “What am I seeing?”</p>
<p>“This.” She nudged the head to fall further to the side and revealed a strange squiggle pained on the back of the skull. No, not painted, etched. “I saw more of these along the way. They all had that same inscription.”</p>
<p>“So what does it mean?” Harry asked, frowning.</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head. “I don’t know. All the research we did before coming here, all the myths… I don’t recognise this symbol from any of them.”</p>
<p>Unease raced through Harry. When they had first found out that Riddle was planning this both Hermione and Harry had been surprised. Pettigrew had only been able to tell them that their destination was an old excavation out in the desert. Riddle had been unusually secretive about it, but rumours among the men was that they were searching for El Dorado. But this wasn’t the right place for it at all.</p>
<p>“Do you think...” Harry said and Hermione nodded.</p>
<p>“It’s surely connected to what he’s after.”</p>
<p>Harry shook his head. “We’re not going to find out here. Let’s see if we can make it out of this alive.” He flashed a smile that Hermione returned. So far, that sentence had been like a lucky charm for them.</p>
<p>They walked back the way Hermione had come, a trip that was much easier now that they had light. There was a couple of other skeletons along the way, but Hermione had already checked them and they were much the same. Harry picked up and a locket from one, running his fingers over the intricate snake design on the front.</p>
<p>“Harry!” Hermione said in outrage.</p>
<p>“What? It’s not like it needs it anymore and we need to get some money to get back home, remember?”</p>
<p>The trip to the Saudi desert had been a sudden move for Riddle and Harry and Hermione had been forced to use up most of their savings to get there. They hadn’t been able to plan for a way home, but Dumbledore had assured them he would get them back. They’d pay him back, somehow, but Harry hoped that he wouldn’t have to use up the last of the money his parents had left him to do so.</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head but said nothing, which Harry took to mean that she acknowledged his wisdom.</p>
<p>As light streaked into their cave from the chamber Hermione turned the flash-light off and they sneaked forwards. There hadn’t been much sound from outside and Harry hoped that this meant Riddle had decided to quit his hunt and to move out. Peaking his head around the wall Harry took in the sight.</p>
<p>Bodies still littered the ground and no one seemed inclined to pick them up, much less care that they were jostled around as they walked past, carrying boxes and objects. There was a section of soldiers who looked like they were building a sort of scaffolding to get up to the cave Harry had climbed up to – one of the pillars he had used was on the ground now, most likely having fallen when someone else tried to climb. Good riddance. He hoped they were properly busy with trying to get in there.</p>
<p>The rest of them were carrying things out, Harry caught sight of gold shimmering. And Hermione thought him a thief for taking a single necklace.</p>
<p>Riddle was… thankfully he was nowhere in sight. In fact, neither was Snape – and how the man had survived was a question for another time – or any other of his lieutenants. Had they left the grunt work to the… grunts and gone off to do whatever evil warlords did in their spare time.</p>
<p>No one was even looking in their direction so Harry chanced to have a look upwards. It wasn’t too far to the next cave, he could probably give Hermione a boost up and then get up if she gave him a hand.</p>
<p>“We can do it,” Harry whispered. “No one’s paying attention, so...” He crouched with one knee on the ground for stability, forming a platform with his hand. “Come on, I’ll give you a boost!”</p>
<p>Hemione nodded and got in position, reaching the cave and pulling herself up easily. Good girl, Harry thought. When a hand reached out over the edge a moment later Harry jumped up and grabbed it, getting a grasp on the ledge with his other.</p>
<p>A large hand gripped his tight. Hermione’s pull was surprisingly strong, Harry thought as he heaved himself over the edge and came face to face with Riddle.</p>
<p>Had it not been for the grip on his hand and the hand that grabbed his other arm and pulled him up, Harry might have fallen right there and then. Riddle pulled him up and pushed him against the wall. Behind him, Hermione’s mouth was covered by Snape’s filthy hand. He didn’t have time to dwell on that as Riddle grabbed his chin, forcing him to face him.</p>
<p>“While I do find your attempts of escape to be adorable, please remember that when you are in my presence your focus should only be on me.”</p>
<p>Harry lashed out, aiming a hit at Riddle with his free hand. The warlord caught it with his face, but he didn’t even blink.</p>
<p>“So forceful… always eager to get away. I think it’s time we did something about that, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Harry wanted to say no, but he was too occupied by the glow of Riddle’s eyes and being suddenly spun and shoved face first into the wall. Riddle pressed close, keeping him pinned to the wall. A finger traced Harry’s neck and he was suddenly aware that the other was hard. Was he planning to…?! In front of Snape and Hermione, no less!</p>
<p>The warlord chucked as he felt Harry tense. “Don’t worry,” he whispered in Harry’s ear, “those things will come later. For now...”</p>
<p>The finger that was still tracing his neck suddenly hurt, feeling like they were biting deep into his skin. Harry bit back a scream but couldn’t stop the pained moan from rushing out.</p>
<p>“The first King did this on the back of the skull, but I find that rather odd. Why mark your property where no one can see it?”</p>
<p>Harry whimpered, feeling tears running out the corner of his eyes. The agony just kept going as Riddle slowly, slowly traced his fingers. It was like he was cutting with a knife, only it went deeper than skin into Harry’s bones and into his very soul.</p>
<p>When Riddle finally was done he backed off slightly, letting Harry sag tiredly against the wall.</p>
<p>“There’s just something about your face in agony, Harry...” A hand was running through his hair, massaging the scalp and then pulling, forcing his head back. “I can’t wait to see it in the throes of passion..!”</p>
<p>There was a sudden commotion outside, down in the chamber. From where he was pressed Harry could see a woman shooting wildly. Her black hair left no doubt of who it was. Bellatrix. Riddle stiffened in annoyance behind him and Harry suddenly saw his chance. He buckled and pushed back, catching Riddle of guard. The man stumbled by the edge and went down, hanging by his knuckles.</p>
<p>Harry stared at them, urging himself to move forward and step on them, but he was pushed away by Snape as the man rushed forward to help his master. While Snape grabbed Riddle’s wrist Harry contemplated the idea of shoving him, getting rid of them both in one fell swoop. But before he had the chance to make up his mind Hermione grabbed his sleeve and pulled him deeper into the cave instead.</p>
<p>“Come on! We have to get away.”</p>
<p>Harry’s entire body ached from whatever Riddle had done to him, but with Hermione’s insistent pulling he made it forwards, turning a sharp left and creeping through a slim crevice as she urged him on. Riddle and Snape weren’t far behind and a hand reached in, grabbing at his sleeve.</p>
<p>“Harry!” Riddle’s eyes were wild and desperate. “Don’t even dream about getting away from me!”</p>
<p>The brunette pulled and the warlord’s grip on his sleeve slipped. Harry shuffled through the opening in a hurry, but neither Snape nor Riddle followed. He realised with a start that they were probably too big, too tall to get through. Trust Hermione to find the one path that only they were able to fit through. As a matter of fact, they were damned lucky Harry had been able to fit.</p>
<p>Looking back Harry could see Tom staring at him. Eyes following his shape with frightful accuracy.</p>
<p>The other side of the crack was a small path, just wide enough for one person to walk across. Far below Harry could see Riddle’s men carrying their looted treasure. Any second now the man himself might rush out there, hunting for them.</p>
<p>Harry followed Hermione’s back as she led the way back. “How did he know, Hermione?” He asked in a quiet voice. “How the hell did he know?”</p>
<p>His friend paused and looked back at him, face pale. “He must have seen me, Harry!” She shook her head. “For all that he’s a right bastard he’s not stupid. I led you straight to him.”</p>
<p>“Ah, shit. No, Hermione it’s not your fault. If you hadn’t come to help me I would just have been stuck there! And then he’d have found me anyway.” And done things that were even worse. Harry didn’t say that, it didn’t feel right.</p>
<p>“Still..”</p>
<p>“No. Come on, we gotta get out of here before they come looking.” Harry looked around. “How are we getting down? How did you even get up here in the first place?”<br/> Hermione couldn’t help but flash him a satisfied smile and pointed to a rope hanging down the side of the mountain. It led upward, to a hole in the ceiling.</p>
<p>“Sometimes you need to approach things from a different angle.”</p>
<p>Man, his friend was awesome.</p>
