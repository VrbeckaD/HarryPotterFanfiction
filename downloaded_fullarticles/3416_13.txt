    <p>“Andromeda?” she whispered.</p><p>Draco stood taking a step between the two women.</p><p>	Andromeda stood and spoke stiffly, “Narcissa.”</p><p>	The sisters stood staring, Draco waited nervously to see what they would do, looking rapidly back and forth between them. He stopped when he saw tears form in his mother’s eyes.</p><p>	“Andi… oh Andi...I...I.” Her hands flew to her face to hide.</p><p>	“You what Cissy?” </p><p>	The blond’s hands dropped back to her sides, eyes widened at the sound of her sister using her nickname, she took a step forward and stopped, “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>	Draco looked again at each woman and then said to the room “I’m going to go see if Harry found that toy broom for Teddy,” as he walked quickly to the door.</p><p>	Narcissa stepped forward once again, “I’ve missed you so much for so long Andi.”</p><p>	“Oh really?” Andromeda snapped, “And I’m supposed to believe that? You never once tried to contact me. You never reached out to me when I got married, when I had a child, when my daughter got married, when my grandson was born, when my husband was killed, when my daughter and her husband were killed by our dear sister. The war has been over for more than a year and I’ve not heard a word from you. The last time I talked to you was on the Hogwarts Express on the way home for the last time. I can understand why you never tried while you were still at home that summer but once you went back to school you could have sent me an owl. Once you were married you could have Flooed me. At any point in the last two decades you could have tried at least once to contact me.”</p><p>	Narcissa nearly collapsed to the floor under the tirade from her sister, tears streaming down her face.</p><p>	“And yet,” Andromeda’s voice softened a bit, “Draco tells me you told him stories of our childhood together as bedtime stories and I know that has to mean something, but I’m not sure it means enough.”</p><p>	Narcissa waited to see if her sister would say more before replying, “I wrote to you. I wrote almost every day for the first two weeks back at school but I never heard from you. I tried again after Lucius and I were married, I sent owls, I even tried sending one of the house elves but I never heard back from you. I thought you’d decided to disown me as mother and father had you.”</p><p>	Andromeda scoffed, “You wrote to me? Then why did I never receive any letters?”</p><p>	“I don’t know. Someone must have intercepted them but I did write. I can show you the memories in a Pensieve, I’ll take veritaserum, Draco might have some around he’s been working on his potions all summer or I can go get some from the local apothecary. Or...Wait I know. Please stay here, I’ll be right back.” She turned and rushed to the Floo, tossing in a handful of powder and disappearing into the green flames, less than two minutes later she stepped back out with a book in her hand. “Here take this, read it please.”</p><p>	“What is it?” Andromeda took it carefully in her hand as if expecting to be cursed.</p><p>	“A journal, letters to you really, though I daren’t use your name so they’re all addressed to M-31.”</p><p>	Andromeda’s eyes watered, “You remembered?”</p><p>	“How could I forget? I’ve often thought our little exploration into Muggle science and astronomy was the first step in your move away from the family. Your love for Ted must have been something really special to leave behind all you knew.”</p><p>	“He was my world. I knew I’d lose Mother and Father and even Bella, though I never expected to lose you, but I wouldn’t trade my time with Ted or my Nymphadora for anything.”</p><p>	“And now you’re a grandma?”</p><p>	“Yes, Teddy is all I have left.”</p><p>	“You have me, if you want me. I won’t pressure you, read that journal and then we can talk if you want,” Narcissa walked to look out a back window, “The boys seem to be getting along, if you decide you don’t want to reconnect with me I hope you will at least stay in touch with Draco. I think he could use someone like you in his life right now. He’s been so strained since the war, he’s not happy at the Manor anymore, for that matter I’m not so happy there anymore. I’m thinking of redecorating. It is rather drab and dreary. It needs lightening up, removal of some of the dark things or relocation of them anyway, maybe I can put them all in Lucius’s personal study.”</p><p>	“Cissy stop,” Andromeda injected, “You’re babbling on and on. I’ll read this but I won’t promise anything other than that I will stay in contact with Draco so long as he wants to and doesn’t start behaving like his father.”</p><p>	“I don’t think that’s a concern, he can’t even stand to be in the same room as Lucius anymore. Lucius has been rumbling about disowning him and at this point I wonder if that would even bother Draco, however I’ve told him if he does I’ll be leaving as well and taking all of the Black family inheritance with me. Actually would you let me set up an account at Gringotts for Teddy. I’m sure his parents left him what they had but you and he should have some of the Black money to help with his needs through the years, especially once he goes to Hogwarts.”</p><p>	“You would do that? Can you do that?”</p><p>	“Yes I would do that, and why wouldn’t I be able to do that. The money is mine now, it’s more than I would ever need, more than Draco would need and he seems to be on a path that’s leading him to take care of himself and not fall back on family money.”</p><p>	“I...thank you Cissy, but what will Lucius say?”</p><p>	Narcissa laughed, “Lucius has no say, the Black family vaults have my name and my name alone on them, besides if he gets angry and mouthy over it I’ll just leave.”</p><p>	“You’d leave him? Really? Don’t you love him?”</p><p>	“Andi, you have to know you’re the only one of the three of us that married for love. Bella married for power and though he was from a Pureblood family our parents never quite liked him but he was a suitable match so when she insisted the agreed. You ran off and married for love, then Mother and Father married me off to Lucius to save the family name.”</p><p>	“Why did you go along with it?”</p><p>	“I was never as strong as you or Bella, not when it came to our parents that is. I did come to care for him through the years though I never quite understood his devotion to the Dark Lord but that was something else I just couldn’t actively fight against.”</p><p>	“You did you’re stay quiet and stay out of the way thing you always did when Mother or Father were arguing with Bella or me right?”</p><p>	“Yes,” she half laughed.</p><p>	“Harry told me you saved his life.”</p><p>	“That was purely selfish. It was the only way I was going to find Draco. I don’t know how I would live without my son. He is my world.”</p><p>	“That I can understand. Teddy is the reason I get up every morning. If it weren’t for him, I don’t know what my life would have been after losing everyone else I loved.”</p><p>	“I can never apologize enough for not being there for you.”</p><p>	Harry knocked as he came in the door, “I’m sorry for interrupting but Dromeda I think it’s time for Teddy’s nap. He’s getting quite tired and cranky. Draco has him distracted but it won’t last.”</p><p>	Andromeda nodded, “Well then let’s get him and go.”</p><p>	“Wait, just for a second please,” Narcissa said, “Do you have an owl?”</p><p>	“No.”</p><p>	“Then I have an idea, it will only take a moment, no longer than it will take for Mr. Potter to go get your grandson.”</p><p>	“All right.”</p><p>	“Tippy,” Narcissa called and seconds later a smaller than normal house elf clad in a flowered dish towel popped into the room, “Tippy this is my sister Andromeda, should she call for you, please go directly to her house,” she then turned to her sister, “You can call her to send me a letter if you need or if you simply need some help with Teddy or the house. Tippy is a wonderful cook and housekeeper.”</p><p>	The elf beamed in delight, “Mistress Narcissa is too kind to Tippy.”</p><p>	“That is very thoughtful of you Cissy. I’ll...I’ll be in touch,” she said as Teddy launched himself into her arms when Harry brought him through the door.</p><p>	“It was good to see you Andi.”</p><p>	“Yes it, it was.”</p>
