    <p>There were permanent indents in the carpet as Remus followed his path back and forth in front of the fireplace. His eyes were fixed upon the ground in front of him and he was stroking his chin as if in contemplation, though Sirius doubted there was any real thought in his head.</p>
<p><br/>Sirius heaved a great sigh and leaned forward from where he was lounging on the couch. He rested his elbows on his knees and stared daggers at his roommate. “Would you just sit down? You’re making the whole room spin, Moony.”</p>
<p><br/>Remus did not, in fact, sit down. Or even stop moving for that matter. “I can’t help it. I need to go do… something!”</p>
<p><br/>“It’s been two days, Remus.” Sirius reminded him.</p>
<p><br/>“And this quarantine is supposed to last an entire month, Pads. What am I supposed to do!”</p>
<p><br/>“What you always do… read?” Sirius offered. “It’s not that big a change from your normal life. You’re inside most of the time anyway, why are you freaking out about this?”</p>
<p><br/>Remus finally stopped his incessant pacing and turned, dumbfounded, to his friend. He opened his mouth as if to say something and then promptly shut it again. “I don’t know,” He said, wiping his hand down his face in exasperation. “I just feel… trapped all of a sudden.”</p>
<p><br/>“And I’m sure you’re not the only one. You’re free to go anywhere, even if you don’t want to, and then suddenly that freedom is gone. It’s a big change, Moons.” Remus plopped himself down on the sofa next to him and groaned. “But, think of it this way; we get a whole month's vacation to do anything we want, just the two of us!”</p>
<p><br/>Remus lolled his head towards Sirius who leaned back into the sofa to be level with him. “I suppose…”</p>
<p><br/>“We could play endless Mario Kart or you could finally get around to reading fucking… War and Peace, I don’t know, Re.” He slung his arm over the back of the sofa, Remus’ hair brushing softly against his skin.</p>
<p><br/>“I wonder how James and Peter are holding up.” Remus said, adjusting his head so that it rested more on Sirius’ arm than on the sofa. Sirius made no move to correct this and resisted the satisfied smirk that was threatening to creep onto his face as he studied the man next to him.</p>
<p><br/>They had been friends since grade school, forming an unexplainable bond between them and their friends James Potter and Peter Pettigrew. Even now, after they had all graduated, they strained to stay near each other, to stay connected and preserve that friendship that was so dear to them. Peter lived alone in a little flat two streets away, even though Remus and Sirius had offered to get a three bedroom with him, and James lived with his new and very pregnant wife, Lily, in the town over.</p>
<p><br/>“I’m sure they’re just fine. We can all do a group video call once a week if it makes you feel better.”</p>
<p><br/>Remus met his eyes and gave and Sirius saw that some of the stress had gone from his face. “It would, actually.”</p>
<p><br/>Sirius smiled and shook his head at him, knowing full well that he would soon begin to miss his friends too. But he also saw this as an opportunity to spend as much time as possible with the man he loved, whether or not that love was requited.</p>
<p><br/>“You mentioned Mario Kart?”</p>
<p><br/>Sirius ruffled the golden locks and pulled his arm from where it was trapped behind them. He grabbed the game remotes from the coffee table and handed one to Remus.</p>
<p>“I call Yoshi!” He said elbowing Sirius in the side to sabotage him scrolling to the character quicker. The grin on Remus’ face made Sirius’ eyes light up. When Sirius’ icon didn’t move, Remus looked over at him in anticipation, his eyes alight and the smile still playing on his lips. They caught eyes and it took Sirius a moment to break from his gaze and finally choose a character. He felt Remus bump his shoulder and was suddenly glad they were living in the middle of a world-wide pandemic so that he could see that smile whenever he wanted.</p>
<p><br/>Yes, Sirius thought, he was going to enjoy this.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sirius had beaten him six times now, Remus usually beating the computer players and getting second place. Without a word, he placed his remote back on the coffee table and brushed Sirius’ arm as he stood up. “I’m going to make dinner, any preference?”</p>
<p><br/>Sirius didn’t look up from the game as he switched it from two players to one. “No,” he said simply, sinking further into the couch. Remus had a sudden urge to lean down and place a small peck at his roommates temple but shook his head and retreated to the kitchen. They were pretty well-stocked, not hoarded level but normal, sane person in a pandemic level.</p>
<p><br/>Remus wasn’t a master chef or anything but he could follow a recipe. He searched the pantry for a moment before deciding he didn’t want to spend too much time cooking tonight. It may be the third time this week he made pesto pasta but he didn’t really care, and he knew Sirius wasn’t one to complain when he didn’t have to do the work himself.</p>
<p><br/>They ate on the sofa, discarding their bowls on the coffee table for later. Sirius was still distracted by his game, having swapped Mario Kart for Legend of Zelda. Remus grabbed a book and curled into the corner of the couch, beginning right where he left off.</p>
<p><br/>Several chapters later, he was yawning and his eyes drifted lazily from sentence to sentence. He closed the book to find that somehow in the past couple of hours, Sirius had worked his way to Remus’ side of the couch and now lounged comfortably in his lap. He reached to put the book back on the coffee table, startling Sirius. He heard a distant yelp from the television, telling him his character had probably taken a good bit of damage and the warmth Sirius had brought to him was suddenly gone.</p>
<p><br/>“Sorry, I didn’t realize.” He said, retreating back to the other side of the couch.</p>
<p><br/>“No worries, Pads.” It wasn’t as if they hadn’t sat that close before. Sitting four people on a couch wasn’t easy and they ended up entangled quite often. He didn’t know how to ask him to come back, to lay his head back against his stomach so he could run his fingers through his hair and fall asleep in his scent.</p>
