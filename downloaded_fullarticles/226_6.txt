</p><p>Dorea Rose Potter-Black took a deep breath and kept the tears that so wanted to escape back as she grounded Teddy's Wolf. The casket that contained Andromeda Tonks, the grandmother of Teddy Lupin and recently adopted mother of Dorea "call me Rose dammit" Potter-Black, was lowered into the grave that was beside Ted Tonks, Nymphadora Tonks-Lupin, and Remus Lupin.</p><p>It was the same graveyard where James Potter, Lily Potter, and Sirius Black all rested. Their family rested in just one graveyard made a dull ache run through Dorea and reminded her of just how tired she was.</p><p>Tired of losing those close to her, making her heart feel more dull day by day, the only thing keeping it still beating were her close friends Hermione and Ron, and her cub.</p><p>The Weasley Family had long since went back to the house, after double-checking with Rose that it was alright to leave her and Teddy.</p><p>"Whenever you're ready, Cub," Rose said softly, her right hand that contained the Lady Rings for Potter and Black shining in the soft light of a fading sun.</p><p>"I don't want to leave her," Teddy said, his lip wobbling softly.</p><p>"We'll always have her in our hearts. Even for the days that seem blue and where we just want to sleep all day. They're always with us," Rose said as her hand ran through his hair softly.</p><p>"Like Mum and Dad?" Teddy asked softly.</p><p>Rose nodded softly even though Teddy couldn't see her. "Just like them."</p><p>They stayed in silence for just a few more minutes before Teddy turned and buried his face in the helm of her black skirt. "Okay," he said softly.</p><p>Rose rested her right hand back on his shoulder and apparated both of them back to the empty two-story apartment that had been Teddy's home for the past four years.</p><p>"Our flight leaves tomorrow, Cub, why don't we get some dinner and then get some sleep?" Rose asked her adopted son softly.</p><p>"Okay, Mama," Teddy said just as softly.</p><p>They walked out of the apartment as they had no need to apparate around London. Instead, they took their time, watching the sites they might not see for a long time.</p><p>"What will America be like, Mama?" Teddy asked, his blue eyes shining with a question in them.</p><p>"Hopefully quiet," Rose said as they found a nice Diner.</p><p>Enjoying the dinner while still lost in thought, the duo had gotten back home where Rose had helped Teddy with his bath and then told him a story about her third year at Hogwarts.</p><p>It was his favorite year beside fourth year where she exaggerated the events slightly and kept the ending more kid-friendly.</p><p>----------------------------------</p><p>Rose exited the plan roughly 12 hours after they had let the UK around noon. But because California was eight hours behind UK time it was roughly 4 pm.</p><p>Teddy was sleeping in her arms when she had gotten him into the soft silver Mercedes-Benz she had bought. Strapping him into the car seat she had bought and asked them to install with a little extra money, Rose was tiredly driving to the four-bedroom house that she had bought that was close to the Preserve that was surrounding Beacon Hills.</p><p>By the time they arrived at their new house, Teddy was sleepily awake and hungry. Getting the Toddler out of the car, she let him explore the house while she double-checked that the fridge has been filled.</p><p>She had sent Willow, the Head House Elf for the Potter Family, and Kreacher, the Head House Elf for the Black Family, ahead to get their new furniture and food for the house while also setting up the wards with the American Goblins.</p><p>That didn't mean they didn't have things to unpack though, in the hallway that lead upstairs was littered with boxes that she specifically as for Willow and Kreacher to just set it aside for her. Most of the items in the box were magical in some fashion; as a result, she wanted to enchant a room to exist that only she could open where she could put the books and artifacts away herself.</p><p>The reason most families didn't just make a room exist is that it required a large magical core for the initial creation and the ability to manipulate the same magic to tie it to a ward stone. Meaning you need the advance knowledge of runestones to be able to do it.</p><p>Rose had never really felt as grateful until that moment that she decided to take Ancient Runes instead of Divination.</p><p>With relief in noting the fridge was full of food and drinks, Rose made herself and Teddy sandwiches before turning in for an early night. She knew that it would take a few nights before their bodies got used to this time zone instead of the UK's.</p><p>----------------------------------</p><p>By the time the full moon was on them, Rose had managed to tie the Magical Room to the ward stone where only she and Teddy could get into it and see the actual door that was behind the downstairs closet.</p><p>"Ready, Cub?" Rose asked as she watched Teddy strip down to his boxers.</p><p>They've done the full moon numerous times and while Rose was happy Teddy bones didn't break like Remus' and were actually all things smoother, she still felt bad that he had to do it each full moon.</p><p>Perhaps that would change when he got older and got more control, but for now, he had to change each month because of the full moon.</p><p>Teddy nodded as he finished removing his pants and felt the pull of the moon. "It's time Mama, change! Change!" Teddy said excitedly as he watched her eagerly.</p><p>She felt a smile dance on her lips as she smoothly changed into her animagus. A Red Wolf that was bigger than a coyote, but smaller than the common Grey Wolf that was said to be the in-between for said two species.</p><p>

</p><p>Teddy grinned happily and clapped his hands before shifting into his own wolf form. A small reddish-black Grey Wolf pup that had a darker red than her own coating.</p><p>Â <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/11/25/e9/1125e94e7355ab71b18a0ce6144a264e.jpg" alt="Image of Grey Wolf Pup that has Redish Coloring" width="176" height="261" data-pagespeed-url-hash="3248801246" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/></p><p>Smiling at her cub now in front of her, she gave him a few licks on his head before carefully grabbing the extra fur in the back of his neck before heading deeper into the preserve, making sure she knew the way back home.</p><p>She had gone through the forest the day before during Teddy's nap time and explored it herself. Finding the open field she found earlier, Rose let Teddy down and let his wolf smell all around them.</p><p>Settling along the soft grass, Rose kept an eye on her cub as his tail wagged back and forth happily. He played with some of the long grass briefly before tackling her softly and nibbling on her left ear.</p><p>Amused, Rose stood up and decided a run would help Teddy with the extra energy he's gotten from her trying to fix their sleep schedules. Keeping pace with her cub, Teddy and her explored the forest. Teddy panting heavily but his tail continuously wagging as his energy didn't seem to deplete at all.</p><p>It wasn't until the wind shifted just slightly and she caught onto a scent that had her tensing instantly and bringing her ears forward.</p><p>Teddy instantly noted the change as she watched his ears pull back and his tail instantly still as he hid under her front legs.</p><p>While the wind had shifted back to its initial direction, the damage was done and Rose was on high alert.</p><p>She gave a warning growl to the scent of wolves that was downwind of her. A full black wolf with red eyes emerged from the foliage that had surround Rose and her cub. Behind her were other wolves who's eyes were mostly golden in color but there were a few that had sky blue.</p><p>Though there were also the werewolves that were in Beta Shift instead of Full Shift which made Rose uneasy.</p><p>She knew she should've let Kreacher look around when he was here like he wished. Informing her of any presences that might cause her and her heir distress.</p><p>Rose gave a warning growl as her head lowered in front of Teddy and felt her magic shift under her skin, ready to harm those around the two of them if need be.</p><p>While many didn't realize it, an animagus could access their magic even while shifted. It just took a large magical core and being trained in wandless magic, because that's what it was essentially.</p><p>Rose had mastered it when she was on the run from Voldemort.</p><p>The Alpha of the werewolves stepped closer to her and she gave another snarl. She noted how the Alpha's Left and Right Hands were right beside her, also full shift.</p><p>Alpha's Right Hand was second in charge and acted in the Alpha's position should the Alpha be indisposed. While the Alpha's Left Hand worked more behind the scenes and often did things that the Alpha could not be seen to do.</p><p>It surprised her because the right hand was snarling right back at her, but the left seemed almost intrigued. And it wasn't until she actually made eye-contact with the wolf that she felt it.</p><p>Her inner wolf whined slightly at him, wanting to be submissive to him, but now wasn't the time for her wolf to want a mate, not without doing more research on the pack that had now surrounded her, keeping her from leaving.</p><p>She fought her wolf briefly. The older, wanting to mate part of her wolf wanted to stay and learn more about the light grey wolf that had caught its attention, but the other side, the one that was winning out, was telling it that they didn't know this pack, that they had to watch out for their cub.</p><p>It kick-started her wolf instance when she reminded her mating wolf of her cub that was now shaking slightly under her. Her maternal wolf instincts flared so when two wolves from her left stepped closer than she liked, she turned and snarled and let her magic dance out of her.</p><p>Pushing the two wolves two feet away, she whirled around and did the same to two other wolves that had stepped closer to her with her back turned.</p><p>Her magic was dancing under her skin angrily. How dare they. She didn't know this was their territory, most of the smells having been washed from the recent rain, but it didn't warrant the way they were surrounding her and her cub.</p><p>The Alpha snarled as Rose whirled around to face her, her teeth bared and her magic ready to fling the Alpha away from her and Teddy.</p><p>But the snarl wasn't directed at her, it was directed at the four werewolves that had gotten too close to her. Taking the distraction, Rose grabbed Teddy's scruff and forced herself to apparate in her wolf form.</p><p>She instantly flinched at the feeling of lack of skin on her front left leg and remembered why textbooks always said to never apparate in your animagus form, let alone side-apparate with someone.</p><p>Whining softly, Rose gave the still shaking Teddy a once over before carefully picking him back up and limping back toward the house where the door magically opened as she sent a spark of magic toward it.</p><p>Never ideal to handle a full moon in the house, Rose took Teddy upstairs to her room where she hoped her scent would help calm Teddy as she curled around him. It seemed she was going to do more research before announcing her presence to the town.</p><p>If she did it now, she had no doubt the werewolf pack would put two and two together. She wanted more information before the confrontation occurred.</p><p>Especially as it seemed her mate was part of that pack.</p>
