  <u> <strong>Prologue</strong></u>
</p><p>
  <u>Saturday 5th September 1998</u>
</p><p>“Potter, you’ve lost your mind! You can’t break into the Department of Mysteries! You’re the most recognisable face in the country, if not the world. More to the point, it’s <em>illegal</em>! You’re not above the law just because you’re the sodding <em>Chosen One.</em>” Malfoy’s fists were clenched so hard by his sides that his knuckles were turning white. He was flushed red with anger and disbelief, his hair beginning to fall across his forehead and into his eyes as his composure failed him.</p><p>“I’ve done it before,” Harry shrugged nonchalantly, “I don’t see why I can’t do it again.” He was beginning to regret having this conversation in the Leaky. It had seemed wise to pick a public place to meet Malfoy, mostly because Harry wasn’t quite sure he trusted him. People had been staring at them since the minute they stepped through the door, despite Harry’s reassuring glance at Tom. If Harry had anticipated telling Malfoy about his plan, or Malfoy’s subsequent anger, he probably would have suggested somewhere more private. The other customers looked ready to spring to Harry’s defence which he found both touching and amusing, since he was supposedly more powerful than all of them put together. </p><p>“And how well did that turn out for you?” Malfoy raised a perfectly arched eyebrow at him haughtily. His heart squeezed. Even for Malfoy that was a low blow. Malfoy hadn't even been there when they had broken into the Department of Mysteries, and even if he had, he couldn't understand that every since that day he’d faced Tom Riddle at Hogwarts, the space Sirius had filled in his life had become larger and more cavernous. The way the entire wizarding community had pulled together to rebuild had only made his lack of family even more stark. As much as he loved the Weasleys, he felt like an imposter in their grief.</p><p>“I’m older now. I’m wiser, better prepared.”</p><p>“Look, Potter. Don’t be under any illusion that I care about you. If you want to run off on another one of your hare-brained schemes so be it. But for once put your Gryffindor bullishness to one side and actually think about it. There’s a reason no one has tried to go there before. There’s a reason why it’s buried so deep in the Ministry only someone as idiotic as you has discovered it. Do you really think you stand a chance? Has it ever occurred to you what might happen if you don’t come back?” There was an edge to Malfoy’s tone, one of desperation and most likely fear. He was still pale, even with the angry red splotches on his cheeks, and although he was looking better than he had when Harry had last seen him, he didn’t exactly cut the healthiest of figures.</p><p>“You don’t understand,” Harry said quietly. He had only come here to give him his wand back... he should have kept his mouth shut.</p><p>“What don’t I understand?” Malfoy leant forward, folding his arms on the table, his face softening into an expression that was almost pleasant... for Malfoy. Harry didn’t say anything. For all that Malfoy had gone through during the war, and Harry wouldn’t be the one to deny everyone had lost something, he had no comprehension of how Harry felt to have been so close to having a real family only for it to be ripped away again.</p><p>Malfoy leant forward even further and gripped Harry’s forearm across the table. Harry’s eyes widened at the unexpected contact. Malfoy's hands were icy cold but his palm felt surprisingly smooth against Harry’s skin for someone who had played a lot of Quidditch at school.</p><p>“I don’t presume to know what it’s like to be you,” Malfoy began carefully, “but I do know that you should think very carefully about what you do have before you go chasing after something you don’t. You might be surprised to find that the grass isn’t always greener.”</p><p>Harry would have been hacked off - hadn’t he already died and decided to come back? Hadn’t he already seen for himself that the grass wasn’t always greener? But he was so shocked by the intimacy he daren’t say a word. People all around them were openly gawking at them.</p><p>Harry scrambled up from the table feeling utterly wrong-footed. He had come here to help <em>Malfoy</em>, not to ask for help <em>from</em> him. How dare he presume that there was anything he could advise Harry about. How dare he pretend like he hadn’t made one disastrous choice after another. How dare he tell Harry he shouldn’t pursue happiness when he had the one thing Harry had always wanted but had never had. </p><p>“Please, Harry. Don’t do something you’ll regret. No one will save you this time.” Malfoy pinned him with such a piercing look that Harry’s insides turned to jelly, his name rolling off Malfoy’s tongue like he’d been using it for years. Was it possible that Malfoy knew more than he was letting on? Surely not. No one knew anything about the Department of Mysteries except the Unspeakables, and there was no way on earth Malfoy held a position as important as that.</p><p>Harry left the pub quickly, feeling fettled. Malfoy had the ability to strip Harry’s outer layer off like he was pealing an orange. If Harry had been less flustered, he might have noticed that the crowd of people nearby were not just the regular punters. If he had been less disconcerted by Malfoy’s display of something akin to warmth, he may have noticed the flash of a camera. As it happened, Harry noticed neither of these things. However, unbeknownst to him, Malfoy definitely had, and it would come back to bite them both later.</p>
