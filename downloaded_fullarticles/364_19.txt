    <p>It was a hot August day when somehow, indirectly, I managed to almost kill an owl, and may I stress that it was not my fault.</p><p>Sitting on the back stairs of the Big House with my best friend, Dominick Carson, playing a beat-up game of <em>Uno</em>, I felt all was at peace. School started in a little over a week, no fights had broken out between the Athena and Archne cabins in a couple months, and no one had gotten more than a broken arm in any of the capture the flag games. My eleventh birthday had happened almost a month ago, and Lou Ellen had gotten me a new set of bangles and earrings. She always joked about how, with so many big pieces of jewelry I wore, I had come straight from the eighties. Even then, I wore two big golden bracelets: one on each wrist. Everything was going great in my life. Until the owl crashed into the window just behind Dom and I.</p><p>"Draw-" Dom started off with a smirk, starting to lay down a card, only to jump up and drop all of his cards into the discard pile as a gray blur whizzed past us and crashed into the window with a dull <em>thud. </em>I jumped back, landing in the dusty walkway leading to the stairs.</p><p>"What the <em>hell</em>?" I murmured, getting up and dusting myself off as I climbed the stairs. Dom was examining the gray lump of feathers, and as I looked at it, all that time passing the Athena Cabin gave me insight of just what the hell I was seeing. Crumpled below the window, lay a large, gray-</p><p>"Is that an <em>owl</em>?" Dom said, rolling it over so it lay face-up.</p><p>"Dude. Isn't this animal abuse? Where did it come from? It's the middle of the day, and not to mention we're in <em>Long Island." </em></p><p>I looked back down the path to see any Athena kid had lost an owl- <em>Why would any Athena kid have an owl? And that still doesn't explain why it's awake right now-</em> but saw no one. "Should we tell Chiron, or maybe Tobi?" Tobi Wolfe was the Athena head counselor, and they probably wouldn't appreciate being left out of owl maintenance.</p><p>"I'll go get Chiron and Tobi, and you can watch it," Dom said, jogging off down the porch to find our mentor. Crouching down beside it, I noticed an envelope tied to its' leg with a thin, silver string. Untying it, I looked over the address and was surprised to find what was there.</p><p align="center">
  <em>Ms. Sibyl Krauss</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Big House back stairs</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Camp Half-Blood, Half-Blood Hill, Farm Road 3.141</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Long Island, New York 11954 </em>
</p><p> Okay. Couple questions. First off, how the <em>hell</em> did whoever sent the letter know my address? And why had they been so specific to even put that I had been sitting on the Big House stairs? And why had they tied the letter to an owl, for the gods' sake? The letter had no sender, so I turned it over to see that it was closed with a red wax seal- a shield divided into four squares, one with a snake, a badger, a lion, and a raven, with a large <em>H</em> in the middle. Looking at it, a strange sense of deja vu hit me. I had seen this symbol before somewhere, and I was sure of it. I just wasn't exactly sure how.</p><p>"Hey, Sib! Is it any different?" Dom called, jogging from around the corner with Tobi and Chiron behind him.</p><p>"No, but.. it's got this weird letter on it, addressed to me."</p><p>Chiron frowned, and while Tobi rushed to the owl to make sure it was okay, I stood by Dom and let him read the address.</p><p>"May I?" Chiron said, holding out his hand for the letter. Shrugging, I handed it to him and watched curiously as he glanced over it, frowning even more deeply as he looked at the wax seal on the other side. He sighed and looked back up at me.</p><p>"Go and get Lou Ellen and come back to the Big House, Sibyl. When you get back, we'll.. discuss what this letter means," he said, finally.</p><p>I pressed my lips in a thin line before passing Chiron and heading in the direction of Cabin 20, leaving Dom and Tobi and wondering what he meant by "discuss the letter." I mean, it was only a letter, right?</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sib, this is- this hard for me to explain."</p><p>Pause. Lou Ellen sighed before continuing. "Well- I- long story short, you're a witch."</p><p>I blinked. Really? <em> This </em>  is what Chiron and Lou Ellen'd been so uptight about? For fuck's sake, I was a daughter of  <em> Hecate </em>. "No, duh. What'd you think I was? A platypus?"</p><p>"No- I mean an <em>English </em> witch."</p><p>"I speak English, yes." Smirking, I imagined if I smoked, I'd have just taken a long drawl from my cigarette before boredly blowing the smoke out in Lou's face.</p><p>"Sibyl-"</p><p>"Miss Blackstone, maybe we should start from the beginning?" Chiron butted in from his wheelchair. We were sitting in the Big House in the main room, Lou Ellen, Chiron and I. I'd told my older sister about the owl when I'd gotten her from the strawberry fields, and she'd gotten suspiciously quiet. She wouldn't say anything until we'd gotten here, no matter how hard I pestered her. Lou sighed, twining her knuckles together and resting them in front of her face.</p><p>"Okay," she muttered, closing her eyes for a second. "Sib, do you remember anything about your life before you got here?"</p><p>I stilled and gulped quietly. "Yeah, but only one thing. And- and you know what it was." I never liked to speak about what I could remember. Besides, why would I? I was so happy here at Camp, and I'd never wanted any other life until I was an adult. And my one memory was not a good one- one of my worst.</p><p>"Okay, it's you learn about your father. And the other half of your life. You used to live in London-"</p><p>"London?" I laughed nervously. "What, it's not like I'm a royal, am I?"</p><p>"No, sorry," Lou Ellen said, giving a small smile. "You used to live in London with your dad, and your grandparents- when you were, like, two, your dad came over to America on a business trip. He was sent here to inspect some things. Your dad- your dad was a wizard."</p><p>"Mm-hmm. What a surprise- I wonder what else he could've been to catch dear old Mom's attention," I replied sarcastically.</p><p>"No- your dad was a, like, a real, magick-in-the-blood, wand-waving, spell-casting wizard."</p><p>"And we aren't?"</p><p>Lou Ellen groaned and buried her face in her hands. "Chiron, it's obvious I'm not getting through that thick skull of hers-"<em> "Hey!" </em> "-so could you maybe try to explain it to her?"</p><p>"Of course. Miss Krauss?" Chiron said, an amused smile flickering on his face.</p><p>"Yeah?" I asked, turning my attention on him.</p><p>"Do you realize that there are different types of magick- Egyptian, Greek or Roman, and Norse, for example?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"Well, your father was a practitioner of a different type of magick, also- except his was very different from any of ours. His magick is less god-related and more.. blood-related. Inheritance-related. For example, a mortal couldn't wield on of his kinds' wands, no matter how adaptable it may be. A muggle- that would be they call mortals- couldn't, say, whip up a potion to get rid of poison ivy or a burn as fast as that," Chiron said, snapping his fingers. "You have inherited that type of magick as well- making you one of the most powerful children of Hecate, and one of the most powerful witches in a very long time."</p><p>Sibyl paused. "You're shitting me."</p><p>With Chiron faltering, Lou Ellen's face snapped up.</p><p>"What?" she asked.</p><p>"Really? Over with the Brits, there's a whole community of wizards and witches that no one- and I mean<em> no one, </em> because I have asked if there would be magick users in other places in the US- has ever known about? Chiron, you know I respect you, but do you really think I'd believe that load of-"</p><p>"Sibyl!" Lou Ellen interrupted. "The reason no one knows about it is that they take measures to make sure no one knows about it. They can control the Mist somewhat, with their spells, and they can erase certain memories when mortals see things they're not supposed to-"</p><p>"Chiron?" I interrupted her, her face slightly pink. "What was that letter for?"</p><p>"You, my dear, have been invited to go to a very important place for young wizards and witches- a school called Hogwarts. Many famous wizards have trained there: Dumbledore, the Weird Sisters, even Merlin."</p><p>"The Weird Sisters? Dumbledore? Who are <em>they? </em>"</p><p>"Have you ever read <em>Hamlet </em>, my dear?"</p><p>I shook my head. "Oh, well. You'll learn about all of them soon enough," Chiron said with a sigh. "I current question on the table is whether or not you want to return this summer."</p><p>"What? Of course, I want to return this summer! Where would I even stay if I didn't?"</p><p>"There will be arrangements made with the headmistress about you staying on campus over the summer, and after all, this is in London. It is a very long trip for you to take twice a year." Chiron paused to think. "How about this: this June, before you get let out, you can decide whether or not you want to stay in England then."</p><p>"If I have to choose, then yeah, I guess that'll work. But you should expect the same answer at the end of the school year," I announced. Chiron nodded.</p><p>"But now what? The school year doesn't start for another week," Lou Ellen asked, sitting up.</p><p>"Well, Sibyl should get packing. I'll return them their owl, and tomorrow, she'll be on her way to London, where Headmistress McGonagall will be waiting for her," Chiron informed her.</p><p>"That sounds a lot like you already had all this planned out," I said, only to be responded with a small, secretive smile from our mentor. Lou Ellen and I stood to leave, and Chiron held up his hand for us to stay.</p><p>"Here," he said, handing me the letter. "You should read over it before you're sent to London; we'll send a separate letter to inform them."</p><p> </p><p> </p>
