    <p align="center">"<em>Please</em>. Don't go."</p><p align="center">The words were a gentle whisper within the dim light of the Slytherin dorm room but Lucius knew who spoke them. His pale eyes looked down at the younger boy besides him, the small figure with odd bruises around his bare body. He never spoke in such a spooked, fearful manner before.. It worried him. A sigh escaped Lucius lips as he pulled Severus closer. "I wouldn't dream of it." He said, trying to reasurre him. He knew it hadn't worked when the boy replied a moment later. "But you are. You leave Hogwarts in two years and I'll be alone. Narcissa is leaving along with you. Who will I have then?" Severus muttered, looking up to the other with a frown, his dark eyes staring at him with worry. Lucius had to think for a moment, picking his words carefully. "Well.." he started, "You'll still have Regulus-" He was quickly cut off.</p><p align="center">"Oh piss off. I don't want him around me, hes a <em>Black</em>! You know exactly how they feel about us half bloods.." Severus scoffed.</p><p align="center">Lucius sighed and pushed a few strands of his bleach white hair behind his ear. "Severus. What did I say about that type of language?" </p><p align="center">This gained a groan from Snape. "Not to use it around you." He mumbled quietly, knowing better than to anger Lucius.</p><p align="center">"Exactly. Now, do you mind moving off? I offered to take Narcissa to breakfast this morning." He said cooly. Severus obeyed. He sighed as he shifted out of the bed, moving off of Lucius. There was the sound of a soft thud as his bare feet hit the floor. He only wore his oversized, white with blue stripes, baggy pajama bottoms during the night - it was far too warm to wear a top, and of course, he enjoyed the feel of Lucius' skin on his own. But before Severus could leave, his arm was taken into a tight grip. "Never interrupt me again.." Lucius growled. The words sent a terrible shiver down his spine and his ears grew red. The hand around his arm was released after a few moments of tense silence and Severus scuttled out without a moment to loose like a frightened cat.</p><p align="center"> They'd kept there relationship hidden from the others as Lucius felt it would be a '<em>mockery to the Malfoy name</em>' if he was caught acting the way he did with Severus in public. However, as hurtful as the words once were to him, Severus had grown numb to insults as the years passed, knowing it was simply in Lucius nature to make such comments. Both boys parted and got ready for the day.</p><p align="center">Snape arrived within his own dorm with a little frown, a gentle ache within his arm - Lucius must have grabbed it where a pre existing bruise was. It was empty in the dorm apart from one boy, Scabior. Severus was growing close to the boy but he was pleasantly, and sometimes uncomfortably, surprised by him now and then by the way he acted. Severus took his bottoms off and headed into the dormitory bathroom. The cool water hit his body and ran down his pale skin as he stared at his scrawny, thin body. Severus had always been skinny, no matter the amount of ate. His eyes looked upon the bruises across his body - it was a rainbow of different shades of reds, blues, purples, and yellows. Some from his father after the hoilday when he foolishly decided to spend it at home, one or two from the gang of four boys who made his life a living hell and a couple from Lucius but that was another story. He cleaned his hair with great effort, praying to Merlin himself that it would stay clean but he knew it was going too look greasy no matter what he did. Severus thoughts twinned around within his mind, budding ideas and schemes of what he should do that day but they always returned to Lucius. His pointed, pale face. His silvery, steel coloured eyes.. and the best part was his long, beautiful hair. Severus had the honour of brushing it once and he would never forget the feeling of it on his hands little hands. His lips curved into a grin at the memory. Finally, he stepped out of the shower and dried himself. Snape got dressed into his oversized robes, all of his clothing were like this; oversized. His mothers words ran in his ears - 'You'll grow into them, my sunflower. Last a few more years.'</p><p align="center"> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">Once dressed, Severus made his way down to the main common room. He wondered if he was acting a bit clingy and suddenly felt anxious but his thoughts were cut off shortly by a pair of hands wrapping around him, those familiar lips pressing upon his neck. "Lucius.." he murrered gently, quickly being replied with a deep chuckle. The idea of the pureblood leaving his neck covered in hickeys made his body squirm needingly. Lucius was going to pull him closer when Narcissa entered the room. "Lucius I-" She gasped softly, a bit confused about the scene she walked in upon but Lucius saved the day before either of the boys could respond. </p><p align="center">"-And thats how to tie a tie, you silly half blood.." he ruffled Severus coal coloured hair and tugged on his tie, tightening it around his slim neck as he would do whenever Severus upset him. Lucius turned to the Slytherin girl. "Oh, hello Black." He smiled his usual popular boy smile, the pretty one which made many girls' eyelids flutter. "I was teaching the young Slytherin here how to properly tie his school tie, it was awfully crooked. Are you ready to go?" He held his hand out. Narcissa didn't know how to respond. She shrugged off what she saw and took his hand. The pair left, neither glancing at the boy behind them.</p><p align="center">Severus felt destroyed to say the least, tost away like yesterdays trash, but he wouldn't tell Lucius that. Why bother him with his own queeries? Severus looked down at his tie and loosened it with a soft growl. If he wanted to be replaced so easily, forgotten and used, picked last for everything, then he would have gone to Lily! Or his father. Either would give him that feeling. He scoffed and turned to see the dark eyes of Andromeda Black staring down at him. Her lips turned into a grin and all of a sudden Severus felt his cheeks turn a dark red - how long had she been there?</p><p align="center">"I saw it, you know." She finally said, strolling over to him. He'd caught her plenty of times sneaking off with a muggleborn; Ted Tonks. What a silly name! He wouldn't say anything, though. The Black sisters had taken him under their wing when he arrived but he figured it was because of how pathetic he looked, how poor he was.. the motherly love he got from them was simply out of pity but Andromeda had been the kindest to him, that was sure. If she had the power, she would have surely adopted him by now. Only her and Lucius knew about his home life. </p><p align="center">He took a step back as panic washed over him like a wave engulfing a small beach. "A-Andy Please! No no no, don't tell your sisters." He began to beg but apart of him wanted Narcissa to know. She'd dump him, Lucius would be upset and he'd come running to Severus and they'd live happily ever after- oh wait. He forgot, the world wasn't like that. Happy endings weren't real. Nor was a relationship with Lucius. Her eyes darted around the room, checking for anyone else who had the same idea of lurking in the shadows. "I won't, I promise. Bella would be after you without a moments notice and I don't want her laying a hand on you. Just.. be careful. Please. I don't want to find you on the floor, laying in a puddle of your own blood one day." And with that, she slithered out of the room before Severus could thank her. A bead of sweat ran down his forehead, he quickly wiped it onto his sleeve. A sigh of relief leaving his lungs.</p>
