    <p class="p1">“I gather you have come to slay the beast?”</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> “Uh.” Sirius stared at the man lying on the grass. There was not a line of tension in his body, and he hadn’t dignified Sirius—<em>Prince</em> Sirius—with a single glance. “Er, yes. Right. The beast. Werewolf. Do you, uh, know where…it dwells?”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> The man snorted and turned the page. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> Sirius shifted on his feet, he had never been more humbled in his life. He imagined James’ uproarious laughter if he could have seen Sirius right now, speechless. He continued standing, waiting for a response, feeling incredibly stupid wearing armor in the most non-threatening meadow to ever exist. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> Eventually, the man heaved a sigh. Still not looking up, he said, “The beast you are after is closer than you’d believe. If you must, a riddle you shall receive. First, the gender in which you assigned. Second, the person closest to everyone from the moment they are birthed. Third, what do you call a man? Fourth, how do you measure a person’s intelligence?”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> Sirius opened and closed his mouth twice.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> “I will not repeat myself. Now leave me be, Arnold called Jacob pretty and it is quite the momentous occasion.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> Sirius would have sat on the ground if his armor didn’t make it so difficult. His mind was spinning in so many directions. <em>Arnold and Jacob? Aren’t those…boy names? Is he reading a book about…two boys…</em> Sirius flushed.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> He stood for another thirty seconds, blurted out “good day!” and then ran—sprinted far, far away.</span>
