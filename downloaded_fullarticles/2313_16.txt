    <p> </p><p>"So, I told him that he can fuck off because I maybe many things but I certainly am not a man who shags women who are already taken." finished Sirius Black with a bold grin to an amused Remus and a bored Regulus "And besides why would I fuck her when I have my own delicious Moonpie?"</p><p>Remus laughed in amusement at his boyfriend and Sirius leaned into kiss Remus gently and sweetly making Regulus roll his eyes and elicit retching noises. The couple broke apart at the sounds of vomiting that Regulus was making and Remus laughed again happily and Sirius pretended to be offended.</p><p>"Wow. That was rude, little brother." said Sirius pretending to be offended but he knew that Regulus had meant no harm with his behavior.</p><p>"Sirius, it's 9.00 a.m in the morning. It's way too early for your lovey - dovieness." said Regulus rolling his eyes at his brother "And not in front of my croissant and coffee."</p><p>"Awww, Reggie. Don't be cranky because you haven't had some action!" replied Sirius with an infuriating grin.</p><p>"I am not -" began Regulus in protest but decided to shut his mouth at seeing Sirius' triumphant grin "Whatever. Anyway, my love life is none of your concern."</p><p>"You mean, the lack of your love life." replied Sirius and Regulus shot him a withering glare that could wilt a flower. "You are literally the definition of a walking gay disaster."</p><p>"Sirius, don't be rude." said Remus but he was biting his lip to keep his laughter inside.</p><p>"What? I'm just concerned for my brother's lack of dating life!" protested Sirius making Remus grin and Regulus groan in misery "He hasn't dated anyone in ages! Seriously, you're like a desert flower, waiting to be water -"</p><p>"Wherever you're going with that metaphor, please stop right now!" said Regulus closing his ears and shutting his eyes wondering why he had agreed to meet for breakfast with his brother and his fiance.</p><p>"Why, I heard from Nymphadora who talked Ted who had heard Kingsley talking to  -"</p><p>"Oh for Godric Gryffindor's sake -" sighed Remus Lupin as he shook his head at his fiance in exasperation but there was fondness in his eyes.</p><p>"If he doesn't stop, I will kill him." muttered Regulus under his breath, wondering how a croissant could be used for murder.</p><p>Remus who heard it, smiled at Regulus as he mouthed the words "No, you won't."</p><p>Regulus smiled lightly at Remus who smiled back and they heard Sirius finish up his rant " - who heard that Regulus Black has been single for quite a long time and hasn't gone out on a date in like - FOREVER!"</p><p>"You're over - exaggerating, Sirius." said Remus, coming to Regulus' rescue and Regulus felt grateful to have Remus as a future brother - in - law. "And besides you shouldn't really listen to rumors. They are unnecessary and unreliable."</p><p>"Yeah, listen to Remus!" added Regulus, wanting this to be over.</p><p>"You're right Remus!" said Sirius with a soft smile directed towards Remus and then a conniving smile towards Regulus "I shouldn't listen to rumors. I should just ask dear Reggie himself!"</p><p>"No, don't listen to Remus!" protested Regulus weakly but his protests fell on deaf ears.</p><p>"When was the last time you went on a date?" asked Sirius seriously as Remus sipped his tea peacefully.</p><p>"I don't see why that's any of your business!" fired Regulus but Sirius wasn't buying it.</p><p>"It is my business because I'm your brother and I want to see you happy." said Sirius and Regulus fell silent not knowing what to say because moments where Sirius confessed his concern over him were very rare. Regulus knew that his brother cared about him and Sirius showed that through joking with Regulus, making him laugh, supporting him and always having his back but it was very rare for Sirius to verbally say that he actually cared about Regulus. "So why haven't you dated anyone?"</p><p>"I don't know" said Regulus, giving up, knowing that the only way out was to surrender "All the guys I've been with - we've never really had a connection. It never works out."</p><p>"That's because you have a lousy taste in guys." replied Sirius after a moment of silence making Regulus glare at him again "But fortunately for you, your drought of dating is over."</p><p>Sirius smiled, and it was the smile that Regulus knew too well. It was the smile that he wore when he was about to spew trouble. It was the smile he wore when he had planned something so spectacular and mind-blowing. It was the smile he wore when he knew something that others didn't. And it was the smile he wore, when he was going to get Regulus into trouble.</p><p>"Oh no." began Regulus shaking his head "Whatever you're thinking, whatever you're going to say, stop right there because the answer is no."</p><p>"Care to make a bet?" asked Sirius with a mischievous smile and Remus groaned.</p><p>Regulus knew that this was a trap because Sirius knew that he would never back away from a challenge "Depends on what the bet is."</p><p>"I set you up on one date with a guy who is perfect for you in every way and you will thank me for helping you find your soulmate for life." said Sirius leaning forward, ignoring Remus' mutterings on what a bad idea this was.</p><p>"That is never going to happen." said Regulus raising his perfectly arched eyebrows "So if you win -"</p><p>"You will publicly declare me as the best big brother in the whole wide world." said Sirius happily "And you will also help me with all of the wedding planning."</p><p>"I just hate you." said Regulus shaking his head at his brother, but at the same time admiring his cunning thinking "And if you lose?"</p><p>"Never gonna happen." replied Sirius confidently.</p><p>Remus groaned again and opened his mouth to settle this once and for all "And if Sirius loses, what do you want, Regulus?"</p><p>"Well, that's tough because anything that Sirius possesses, I wouldn't want." replied Regulus sarcastically making Remus spit out his tea in laughter and Sirius protest indignantly "I want Sirius to stay the hell away from my personal life."</p><p>"Done." nodded Sirius quickly.</p><p>"Oh and I want one more thing." said Regulus and Sirius nodded "I want your motorbike."</p><p>"WHAAAATTTTT?" screamed Sirius in shock, standing up, making a mess of the table and making everyone in the cafe turn around look at him disapprovingly. </p><p>"For fucks sake, Padfoot, sit down now!" ordered Remus mortified at how everyone's attention was on them.</p><p>Sirius sat down immediately and Regulus smirked "He's like a little lap dog."</p><p>"What can I say?" said Remus with an equally evil smirk "He is my bitch."'</p><p>"Okay that escalated too fast and let's stop it right there!" said Sirius entering the conversation between his fiance and brother who were having too much fun, making fun of him "Regulus, you cannot have my motorbike! I absolutely forbid it!"</p><p>"Okay then, I guess I'll just have to settle for your record collection." said Regulus casually as he took a sip of his coffee and to his great pleasure watched his big brother's face turn pale.</p><p>"You wouldn't!" hissed Sirius and his lips began quivering and his eyes began watering as he began to plead with Regulus "My record collection - David Bowie, Queen, ABBA !!! My record collection is precious to me, Reggie! They're all my babies! Please don't take away my children away from me!"</p><p>"Padfoot, just give him the goddamn motorbike and you'll still have your children." said Remus sensibly and Regulus nodded.</p><p>"Remus is right. Give me your motorbike and I'll spare your children." said Regulus, amused and satisfied at the same time.</p><p>Sirius stared at Regulus for a few moments "What are you planning to do with Eleanora?"</p><p>Regulus was taken aback for a moment and then asked "Who?"</p><p>"Eleanora. That's what he calls his motorbike." said Remus Lupin in the voice of a man who had to deal with the many endless shenanigans of Sirius Black.</p><p>Regulus looked at Sirius and then Remus "Are you fucking serious?"</p><p>"Yes!" answered Sirius and Remus together with mischievous smiles, way too enthusiastically, making Regulus groan. </p><p>Sirius laughed and then asked in all seriousness "But, really, Regulus, what do you plan to do with her? You aren't going to hurt her, right?"</p><p>"Okay, first of all, please stop talking as if the motorbike is a real, breathing, living woman. It's weird." said Regulus rolling his eyes at his brother "And second of all, no I won't do anything to your motorbike, I just want it as a memento of your defeat to me."</p><p>Sirius stared at Regulus coldly "You cruel, cruel, cruel man. You are a vicious snake. You are the devil incarnate!"</p><p>"Alright, let's cool down on the dramatics." intervened Remus as he patted Sirius' back comfortingly and soothingly and Sirius seemed to calm down. "Sirius, if you want your brother to go on a date, you have to sacrifice Eleanora."</p><p>"Oh god." muttered Regulus under his breath "Stop calling it - whatever."</p><p>Sirius inhaled and exhaled a few breaths preparing himself and Regulus watched him unfazed and Sirius finally gave up "Fine. You can have Eleanora. But that is if I lose. And I certainly won't lose."</p><p>"Keep dreaming brother." replied Regulus with a triumphant grin "I can't wait to watch you fail miserably."</p><p>"Oh good." said Remus Lupin as he took a sip of his tea "Just good old normal sibling rivalry."</p><p> </p><p> </p>
