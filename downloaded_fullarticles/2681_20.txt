  <em>FLASHBACK</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Your heart pounds in your chest as they get closer and closer to your name. The girl in front of you is sorted as Ravenclaw and runs past excitedly, joining the table in which you had noticed a guy with dimples the size of craters sitting.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You look at the four tables.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Please let me be sorted in Gryffindor.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Please.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>They call your name ("(Y/N) (L/N)!") and you scuttle up to the stool, taking the hat gingerly and placing it on your head. You can see your sister staring at you from the Gryffindor table. You wonder if she told them about you- probably not. She's ashamed of you: you were never a brave one.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The sorting hat begins to speak in your mind.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Gryffindor, hmm?" A voice murmurs in your mind. "Certainly the right heritage."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yes. Yes! Send me where my heritage belongs.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"But...." he sighs. "So much ambition. So full of potential. And so competitive."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>No, no, those are the qualities of a Slytherin! No!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Not Slytherin, hmm?" He sounds amused. "And yet you have the perfect capabilities of one, and would be perfect if not for the...." he rolled the r. "...fearrrrrr."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Just.... even Hufflepuff. Any house but Slytherin.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I've made my choice." He murmured. "And you, my dear, have nothing to be ashamed of."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The hat shouts, "SLYTHERIN!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>There is absolute, dead silence.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Then Slytherin bursts into slow claps and whoops as you climb down from the stool and try to hide your tears.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The Gryffindor table is filled with boos, and your sister's is the loudest.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The teachers have to silence them.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You just stand next to the table, your eyes cast downwards, as you search for a place to sit. Boys are offering their places to sit- they won't stop bothering you- one of them's touching your hair but you're to afraid to tell them to stop it- his hand is now creeping down the back of your robes- one of them puts an arm around you- they laugh- one of them jeers-</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And they all suddenly stop. You're so thankful because then your tears fade away.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A boy kneels in front of you and offers you a roll of tissue.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Thanking him, you take it and wipe your face, ridding them of the tears.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I'm Yoongi." He says. "I'm a second year. Hey, you can trust me. Hey, hey, it's okay." He comforts you as you hug him, your small frame gripping his midsection tightly as you hug him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You bury your face in his torso, just not knowing why you're trusting this guy with a gummy smile, but you do.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Soon enough, you realize you've befriended one of the scariest people in Hogwarts, Min Yoongi. AKA Suga, he's scary and downright terrifying, even, when he wants to be. He doesn't need spells to frighten.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He's your only friend for the past three years- the Gryffindors soon realize your weakness, how pathetic you actually are, and take it upon themselves to bully you in the hallways.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>That had been the start of your misery.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Two days later, you had received a howler from your parents saying how stupid they were to trust you, and how weak, pathetic, how worthless you were and how you shouldn't even think about returning for the holidays. How your sister was the perfect sibling while you weren't even wanted.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Basically, they had disowned you.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>FLASHBACK END</em>
</p><p>You try to hold back the dam of tears as the group of Gryffindors and other houses jeer at you. One of them pulls your hair, yanks your head backwards and makes tears come to your eyes. "You know, if you get past the fact that she's a Slytherin she's actually really pretty."</p><p>"Yeah. Sure. Leave you to your sexual fantasies."</p><p>One of them kicks you and you recoil, the pain almost unbearable. You feel the dam break and start to cry, sobbing loudly.</p><p>"Oh, shit, she's crying."</p><p>"Someone's gonna hear! Muffle her or something!"</p><p>One of them shoves a wad of cloth in your mouth and your body is wracked in silent sobs as they continue, taking your stuff and spilling ink across the essay you had taken two sleepless nights to write.</p><p>You let out a sound of protest and they dig through your bag. They find your journal, and start to open it. With shaky fingers coursing with pain, you pull the wad of cloth out of your mouth and grab weakly at the journal. They laugh and one of them swats your hand to the floor before stepping on it. You can hear a crack and whimper with pain.</p><p>One of them squats down to your level. "God, she is actually pretty. Look at her eyes."</p><p>The last of them is standing uncomfortably at the corner, and has been ever since they had started tormenting you on this empty hallway. "Guys, I think this is kind of getting out of hand."</p><p>"Yoongi-oppa is so nice, he helped me get my essay done today." The tallest one mimic your voice, sniggering. "So lame. Oh, look at this!"</p><p>The three of the others, apart from the one crouching next to you and the one standing in the corner with the handsome face, look at it. "Ooh, it's a picture of her and her dear Yoongi-oppa together!"</p><p>"I wonder how she'll like it if we rip it to shreds."</p><p>You choke back a sob- that had been one of your only pictures of him and you together, and you made a grab for it. You didn't want to ask Yoongi for another one- he was suspicious enough and you were running out of excuses to give him.</p><p>"Guys." The one at the corner speaks louder. "This is getting out of hand."</p><p>"Please." You whisper. "Please don't."</p><p>"What?" The tallest one kicks your injured hand. "Speak up, bitch."</p><p>"Please don't." You sniff. "I beg you, I'll do anything. Please."</p><p>"God, she's so pathetic." He laughs. "No wonder she wasn't put in Gryffindor."</p><p>"Shame to the family." One of them say.</p><p>The one crouching down takes a fistful of your shirt and jerks you up. You squeak and he examines your face with a sort of lust. "Hey, how bout this. Give me a quick fuck and I'll give you back your diary."</p><p>You stare, wide-eyed and terrified at the thought of losing your virginity to someone like him.</p><p>"You're going too far." The guy at the corner says.</p><p>The tallest one just turns back to him. "She deserves it, filthy Slytherin who betrayed her family like that. And stop being a spoilsport, Taehyung."</p><p>Taehyung just frowns and presses his lips together. "I'm pretty sure <em>raping </em>her is out of bounds."</p><p>"It's not rape if she agrees to it." The crouching guy says, whom you're pretty sure is a Hufflepuff now. "And you want your precious diary back, don't you, Slytherin?" He tilts your chin up a bit and you nod a tiny bit. He sneers.</p><p>"But you're threatening her." He argues.</p><p>One of the others elbow him. "Come on! Don't be such a spoilsport. Don't tell me you haven't had fantasies about these things before. The girl, helpless at your feet. You fucking her. What could be better?"</p><p>The tears are streaming down your cheeks now. "Please don't do this." You breathe. His hands drop down and before you can react, grabs your ass. You yelp and try to pull away, but he just laughs, his fingers inching towards the spot between your legs.</p><p>"We'll be late for class." Taehyung says. "We're already ten minutes late."</p><p>The guy's eyes widen. "Shit!" Then turning back to you as he collects his stuff. "See you later, girly."</p><p>Then the whole lot of them disappear.</p><p>You quietly collect your stuff, minus your diary, and cry.</p>
