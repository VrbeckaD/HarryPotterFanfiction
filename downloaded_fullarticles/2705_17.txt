    <p>„Welcome to Ilvermorny, Mr. Scamander.“ Helen Montgomery, Headmistress of Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry said as she shook Newton Scamander's hand after he had gotten off the floor. Taking the floo network had never really agreed with Newt. Taking the international floo network was even worse. </p>
<p>“Thank you.” Newt mumbled as he looked over her left shoulder, focusing on a small statue of an impressive looking Thunderbird on a shelf next to the only door in the room. </p>
<p>“Please have a seat.” She gestured at a chair standing in front of her large, dark mahogany desk. She sat down behind it, folded her hands in front of her on the desk and mustered him intently. “My name is Helen Montgomery and I am the Headmistress of this school, it's nice to meet you. Albus has told me a little bit about your situation Mr. Scamander. I'd like to hear your version of the events leading you to my office today. And why I should allow you to finish your last year at my school.”</p>
<p>Newt gulped nervously, looking at her for a split second. He immediately ducked his face and hid behind his copper colored fringe as her piercing gaze registered in his mind. </p>
<p>“Um, it's nice to meet you too. You see, there was a small misunderstanding. A Jarvey got scared and bit a student. Everyone was fine but the teachers and ministry thought it was bad enough to call it an endangerment of human life.”</p>
<p>Montgomery raised an eyebrow. “And what was your involvement in that incident Mr. Scamander?”</p>
<p>Newt started fidgeting. “I've been taking care of the Jarvey before the incident.”</p>
<p>“On school grounds?”</p>
<p>Newt nodded. </p>
<p>“As far as I know, keeping unregistered magical creatures on school grounds is illegal at Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>“And you just ignored this rule?”</p>
<p>Newt dared to look up for a moment, trying to defend himself, but the watchful eyes of the Headmistress changed his mind rather quickly. The fabric of his dark brown pants was much more interesting anyway. It had become rather thin around his knees but there was no hole to find. Yet. </p>
<p>“Mr Scamander?”</p>
<p>Newt jumped. “Sorry. Yes, he needed my help, he was injured when I found him. And he wasn't dangerous. I've been keeping him away from other students. Nobody was ever in danger, I promise.”</p>
<p>“And yet, he bit another student. Why?”</p>
<p>Newt started sweating. It wasn't like he could tell her the truth. Leta betrayed him, but he didn't want to be the same as her. Just thinking of her betrayal still hurt but he couldn't just throw away years and years of friendship. He took a deep breath and looked at the Headmistress properly for the first time since arriving in her office. She had dark eyes and dark hair, a few silvery strands woven into her long braid. She was wearing a simple short sleeved shirt and no jewelry. A simple pair of round glasses sat on the tip of her nose, framing her face nicely. She looked like a nice middle aged lady. Only the sharp gaze in her eyes betrayed the fact, that there was more to her than what meets the eye. </p>
<p>“It was an accident.”</p>
<p>Montgomery sighed. “That's not the whole story. But I'll let it go for now. Maybe you can answer my other question for me then. Why should I allow you to finish your last year at my school? The teachers at Hogwarts thought the incident with the Jarvey deserved the highest punishment. You weren't even allowed to take your graduation exams, your were sent straight home. I don't need troublemakers or rule breakers.”</p>
<p>“I'm not a troublemaker. I didn't intent for the Jarvey to get out, it was unfortunate accident. To be honest, I don't really care if you allow me to finish my last year. I don't need to finish school for me to find a job. I've been working with my mom's Hippogriffs for the whole summer, I don't see a reason why I can't continue doing just that. My parent's don't agree with me though.”</p>
<p>“You don't want to be here.”</p>
<p>“I don't.”</p>
<p>“Well, I'm sorry to tell you, that you have been accepted. Albus used a favor to get you into my school, don't waste it. Last question. Albus has told me that you are overly fond of magical creatures. Do I have to be worried about you bringing unregistered magical creatures onto my school grounds?”</p>
<p>Newt swallowed, thinking about the small green Bowtruckle currently hiding in his left breast pocket. </p>
<p>“No Headmistress, I won't be bringing any magical creatures onto school grounds.”</p>
<p>Technically, Pickett was already here. He's been with Newt for a few month now and he didn't think he could get rid of him now even if he wanted to. </p>
<p>Montgomery looked at him for a moment and inclined her head. “Very well. You'll have to get sorted now. Do you know about the different houses at Ilvermorny?”</p>
<p>“Why do I need to get sorted? I already belong to a house.”</p>
<p>“Yes you do, and I'm glad you are so loyal to your house but if you are staying with us for the next year, you'll need to be sorted into one of our own houses. Now, do you know anything about them or should I give you a short introduction?”</p>
<p>Newt already knew a little bit about the houses but he wanted to know how the Headmistress would describe them. “A short overview would be quite helpful.”</p>
<p>“Alright. There are four houses at Ilvermorny. Horned Serpent, Wampus, Thunderbird and Pukwudgie. It is said that the Horned Serpent generally favors scholars, the Wampus favors warriors, the Thunderbird favors adventurers and the Pukwudgie favors healers. There is more to the houses than that, of course, but we don't have all day. You can ask the other students more about the houses later if you want to. I'll be leading you downstairs to the entrance hall now, where you will stand on the Gordian Knot. A house will choose you then.”</p>
<p>Headmistress Montgomery stood up and motioned for Newt to follow her. He hurried after her, quickly grabbing his suitcase. “Um, how exactly will they choose me?”</p>
<p>“There are four statues of the magical animals the houses are named after in the entrance hall. You'll know if they want you to belong to their house, don't worry about it.” </p>
<p>Newt hated these kinds of answers. What's wrong with answering a question directly? Why did people feel the need to stay vague or keep them in the dark when they clearly know more than they are sharing? He probably won't be getting any additional answers out of Montgomery now, trying again would be a waste of his time. He put his hands in his front pockets and shuffled after her. It wasn't like he had a choice to be anywhere else so following her was his only option. He didn't have to like it though. </p>
<p>They walked through the halls of the school, past various doors and a lot of students walking to or from classes. The students looked at him with interest but the scowl on his face made it clear that he didn't want to be bothered by anyone. </p>
<p>After a few minutes of walking, they arrived in the entrance hall. A few students were standing together in groups, talking and laughing. When they noticed the Headmistress walking past them, they all smiled and greeted her. Montgomery nodded to all of them and responded to their greetings. She knew all of their names. Newt was a little surprised about that. Ilvermorny was not a small school, in fact, if he gauged the amount of students he had already seen and the little research he had done on this school over the summer (he knew he wouldn't get out of attending this school, so he thought it better if he came as prepared as possible), Ilvermorny housed even more students than Hogwarts did.  </p>
<p>“Mr. Scamander would you please stand in the middle of the Gordian Knot now?”</p>
<p>Newt had barely noticed that Montgomery had stopped walking, still thinking about everything he had read about Ilvermorny, and nearly walked into her. Thankfully, he had stopped just in time. Walking into anything or anyone wouldn't be the best first impression. And even though he didn't want to be here, he was still self conscious enough not to want to make a fool out of himself on his first day. He nodded at Montgomery and stepped out onto the Gordian Knot. </p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>He started getting nervous, thinking he failed some unknown test, but just as he was about to turn his head to look at the Headmistress, the statues started coming alive. The crystal in the head of the statue of the Horned Serpent started glowing at the same time as the Thunderbird started beating it's wings. </p>
<p>A few students murmured excitedly for a moment before an uncomfortable silence swept into the room. Newt was looking at the statues with interest but when nothing else happened, he turned his head to look at the Headmistress. “Um, what now?”</p>
<p>Montgomery looked surprised but couldn't help the smile from showing up on her face. “Well, that's a surprise. Sometimes, more than one house chooses a student. It's your choice now, Mr. Scamander. Choose wisely.”</p>
<p>“How am I supposed to choose wisely, I don't really know much about the houses.”</p>
<p>“Use your instincts, Mr. Scamander.”</p>
<p>Newt sighed. Another one of those useless answers. Okay then, he told himself. Horned Serpent or Thunderbird?</p>
<p>He looked at the statues, waiting for some kind of clue, but they remained still. What did the headmistress say? Scholars and adventurers? To be honest, I'm not particularly studious and adventures are exhausting. </p>
<p>Newt shuffled around for a little. Looking at the statues, the students, the Headmistress and the floor. He hated all of this attention. To hell with this, I'm only going to stay here for one year, what does it matter which house I belong to. I'll always be a Hufflepuff. </p>
<p>Looking at the statues again, he made up his mind. “Um, Thunderbird?”</p>
<p>The statue of the Thunderbird beat it's wings excitedly for a moment before going still once more. The statue of the Horned Serpent stopped glowing as well. </p>
<p>Montgomery walked up to him and clapped him on the shoulder. “Congratulations. The house elves are going to prepare your room. You've got your wand, yes?”</p>
<p>Newt looked at her strangely. “Of course I do. I've had it since I was eleven. And I am 18 years old. I'm an adult.”</p>
<p>“Of course you are Mr. Scamander. Follow me please.”</p>
<p>Newt started shuffling after her, hands stuffed deeply into his pockets. Another year at school, great. I could use my time so much better if I helped mom with the Hippogriffs. He didn't pay much attention to his surroundings, just blindly following the dark brown leather boots the Headmistress was wearing. </p>
<p>They arrived at their destination after a few minutes of quiet walking. “This is your room, Mr. Scamander. I trust you'll find your way back to the entrance hall? Dinner will be at six in the large dining room next to the entrance hall. Just follow all of the other students, you can't miss it. Your class schedule should be on the desk in your room, your robes should be in your closet. Classes start tomorrow. I'll leave you to unpack your things now. If you do have a problem with your class schedule or in general, just find me or another teacher. Or ask another student, if you ask nicely, they'll probably help you.”</p>
<p>Montgomery turned around and started taking a step in the direction they had just come from when the things she had said registered with Newt. “Wait!”</p>
<p>She stopped walking and turned around again, one eyebrow lifted questioningly. “Yes?”</p>
<p>“Um, you said this was my room. As in my own room? You don't have dormitories? I won't have to share a room with the other boys in my year?”</p>
<p>“That is correct Mr. Scamander. We do have dormitories for the younger students, to encourage friendships and getting to know your classmates, but as soon as you start your sixth year, every student gets their own room. You should be able to concentrate on your studies and not be distracted by your classmates. You do have a lot of catching up to do, Mr. Scamander. I expect you to use the peace and quiet of your room to catch up on the things you have missed while missing your classes. We don't have the same requirements for graduation as Hogwarts does. I'm sure you'll notice that soon enough. You only have one year to catch up on topics the other students have been studying for six years.”</p>
<p>“Um, okay. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Was that all or do you need anything else?”</p>
<p>“Um, I'm good.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Montgomery nodded at him. “I expect you to try your hardest at graduating in a year, especially if you don't want to be here. Repeating a year for a second time isn't going to look great all things considered.”</p>
<p>Newt looked at her with wide eyes, before he noticed her staring back and switched his focus on a painting of a bored looking middle aged gentleman, reclining in a deep red armchair and petting the white cat lounging in his lap over her left shoulder. “I'm going to try my best, Headmistress.”</p>
<p>“Excellent. I'll leave you to your things now, alright? Don't forget, dinner is in three hours, don't miss it or you'll probably go hungry until the morning.” With that, Montgomery turned around and left him standing in front of his door. </p>
<p>He looked after her for a few more minutes, ordering his thoughts. Eventually, he turned around and opened the door to the room he would probably be spending most of the next year in. </p>
<p>There was nothing special about it. He had a window, a single bed pushed into the far corner under the window, a dresser and a desk with a wooden chair in front of it. It wasn't a big room, but Newt was just glad that he didn't have to share the room with strangers. He hadn't really gotten along with the boys in his year at Hogwarts even after knowing them for seven years. </p>
<p>He stepped into the room fully, closing the door and locking it and put his suitcase on his desk. There was another door in the room he hadn't really seen when he had walked in. It was positioned slightly behind his dresser. He walked towards it and opened it curiously. There was a small room, containing a bathtub, some buckets and a place to relief himself. Newt couldn't help but be impressed by the comfort this school seemed to offer it's students. A private bathroom directly next to his room. He hadn't even had a private bathroom at home. His parent's mansion was quite big and they did have a few bathrooms scattered around the long halls of it but not directly adjourned to the bedrooms. He was starting to like this school. </p>
<p>“Hey Pick, want to take a look at our new home for the next year?” Newt asked as he fished the small green Bowtruckle out of his front pocket. Pickett looked around the small room  and chirped approvingly. Newt chuckled. “Yes, it's better than at Hogwarts. I'm glad I don't need to hide you in the case all the time. You can run around freely here, but when somebody comes in, you hide somewhere, got it? Not that I think I'll ever get visitors, but better save than sorry.”</p>
<p>Pickett nodded his small head and slowly made his way down Newt's arm until he reached the small wooden desk. He mustered the dark wood for a moment, deeming it acceptable and walked over to the piece of paper laying on top of it. </p>
<p>“What do you have there Pick?”</p>
<p>Newt snatched the paper from Pickett, earning himself a rude gesture from the small creature. “Don't start, Pick. I'll let you play with it when I'm done reading it, okay?”</p>
<p>Pickett looked at him with wide eyes and crossed his little arms in front of his tiny green chest. “Don't pout Pick, I'll be done soon.”     </p>
<p>Newt unfolded the piece of paper and quickly memorized what appeared to be his schedule. </p>
<p>Apart from the usual classes like Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, History of Magic (he could already hear Professor Binns sleep inducing monotone monologues droning in the back of his head), Defense against the Dark Arts, Care of Magical Creatures (he was very interested in that particular subject) he also had a class called Native American Magic. He had never heard of a class like that in all of his time at Hogwarts. He guessed he would have the most trouble in that class. If he had to learn everything the other students had learned in the last six years, he would definitely not have time for anything else. </p>
<p>There was also a list of books he needed for his classes included in the timetable. And a reference that he didn't need to buy them, he could just borrow them from the school's library.</p>
<p>I guess the library will be my first destination then. He went over to the closet and found his blue and cranberry colored robes. He quickly put them on, fastening the front with a gold Gordian Knot.</p>
<p>“Pick, do you want to accompany me or do you want to stay here?” He asked, coming back to stand next to the wooden desk.</p>
<p>Pickett started running to him on spindly legs, trying to ascend his home tree as fast as possible, lest he be left behind. Newt chuckled as Pickett made himself comfortable in Newt's new breast pocket. Thankfully these robes had pockets as well. He didn't want to deal with any tantrums if there hadn't been a pocket for Pickett anywhere on his person. “I guess I didn't really have to ask. Let's go and search for the library.”</p>
<p>Newt turned around, opened the door and stepped into the hallway. Colloportus, Newt mumbled, aiming his wand at his door. He didn't think that people would try to break into his room, but if they did, he didn't want to make it too easy for them. </p>
<p>Now, where would I find the library, he asked himself as he started walking in the direction they had came from earlier. Going to the entrance hall, finding some students and asking them for directions seemed to be the fastest way of finding the library. He couldn't quite remember the route the headmistress had taken when she had led him to his room, but going straight seemed like a good plan for now. He looked around the halls for the first time since arriving and noticed that Ilvermorny didn't look all that different to Hogwarts. Rows and rows of paintings lined the walls, ranging from magical portraits to simple muggle landscapes. He followed them until he reached the end of the hallway. Listening closely to the sounds of chattering students, Newt chose to take a left turn and after a few more minutes of walking, he reached the entrance hall. </p>
<p>That wasn't so hard. Now, who looks friendly enough? Newt looked around at the students. Some of them were standing around in groups, talking among themselves, but most of them were just passing through. He stood there for a few minutes, trying to find the right moment to interrupt a group of friendly looking girls when a voice next to him surprised him. “Are you looking for something, honey?”  </p>
<p>He jumped, not having noticed the girl approach. She looked at him with big friendly eyes and a nice smile on her face. She had short blonde hair that stopped just shy of her shoulders, framing her face nicely and warm blue eyes. She looked a few years younger than him and barely reached his shoulders. She was looking at him expectantly, while he stared. </p>
<p>A small pinch from his breast pocket made him aware of his rude behavior. He jumped again, raising his eyes to look at her left ear. “I'm terribly sorry for my rude behavior, I hope you can forgive me. I didn't mean to stare. Um, would you be able to point me in the direction of the library? I'm new around here and I don't really know where anything is except for the headmistress' office, my room and this hall.”</p>
<p>The blonde girl giggled. “It's quite alright. You're British, right?”</p>
<p>“Oh, um yes. How did you know?”</p>
<p>“The accent. My name is Queenie Goldstein and I would be happy to show you around a little.”</p>
<p>Newt's eyes widened. “I'm so sorry, I don't know where I left my head today. My name is Newt Scamander, it's very nice to meet you. If you tell me where I would find the library, I can just go and find it on my own. I don't want to inconvenience you any further.”</p>
<p>Queenie smiled at him brightly. “You're not inconveniencing me in any way. I don't have anything important to do at the moment, I'd be happy to show you the way.”</p>
<p>Newt swallowed but nodded slowly. “Thank you then.” Good job Newt, that's exactly how you make new friends. Could you be any more awkward?</p>
<p>Queenie giggled and turned around, taking a few steps, waiting for Newt to follow her. “It's really no trouble. Come on, the library is this way.”</p>
<p>Newt followed her, observing the halls as they passed them. He was used to the talking paintings from Hogwarts but they usually didn't pay him much attention. The witches and wizards in these paintings all watched him curiously, chatting among themselves quietly, some even following him by jumping from painting to painting. </p>
<p>“So, Newt. Am I allowed to call you Newt?”</p>
<p>“Um, sure Miss Goldstein.”</p>
<p>Queenie swatted his arm playfully. “None of that, Newt. Call me Queenie please.”</p>
<p>“Um, okay.”</p>
<p>“You're cute. Anyway, what brings you to Ilvermorny? You're not exactly the right age to start your education.”</p>
<p>Did she just call me cute?</p>
<p>Queenie giggled again. Newt looked at her uncomfortably. “I'm just finishing my last year here. There were some... problems at Hogwarts and I couldn't finish my education there.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you went to Hogwash! I mean, Hogwarts, how exciting! You have to tell me everything about Great Britain and Hogwarts. I've never been out of America you know, and I find the British wizarding society just so interesting. Is it true that the student's can keep their wands even when they are not in school?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Why would they take our wands away?” Newt asked, confusion coloring his voice.</p>
<p>“When students go home for the holidays, their wands need to stay at school. I guess they want to prevent underage magic in places that aren't as safe as Ilvermorny. I don't really know why, they've never taken my wand but that's because I've never left school since I started attending. Anyway, here we are!” Queenie motioned to a huge wooden door, adorned with thousands of small beautiful carvings. </p>
<p>“You've never left the school? What about your family?” Newt blurted out before he could stop himself. The brief flash of hurt and sadness that showed up on Queenie's face made Newt feel particularly bad about his rude question. “I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it just...”</p>
<p>“Queenie!”</p>
<p>Newt and Queenie turned around, searching for the voice that had spoken. </p>
<p>Queenie's face lit up when her eyes fell on a tall, brown-haired and brown-eyed girl, standing a few feet away from them. “Teenie!” Queenie hurried over to the girl, embracing her in a tight hug. </p>
<p>Newt shuffled awkwardly from one foot to the other. He really wanted to get going but it would be rude to not thank Queenie for her help. But interrupting her quiet conversation with the other girl would be equally as rude. </p>
<p>As if noticing his discomfort, Queenie disentangled herself from the taller girl, grabbed her hand and pulled her over to Newt. </p>
<p>“I'm sorry Newt, this is Teenie, my sister. Teenie, this is Newt Scamander. He's new here. And he is British.”</p>
<p>The tall girl mustered him for a moment, causing him to start sweating. He wasn't used to such scrutiny. After a few moments, she extended her hand. “I'm Tina Goldstein, it's nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>Newt gulped, grabbing the outstretched hand for a weak hand shake. He hoped his hands weren't sweating too much. “Um, yes, it's nice to meet you. My name is Newt Scamander.”</p>
<p>Tina nodded at him. “Okay.” She turned her head to look at Queenie. “I have to talk to you, can we go somewhere private?”</p>
<p>“Sure.” Queenie nodded, turned around and smiled brightly at Newt. “You'll find your way back, right?”</p>
<p>Newt nodded hastily. “Yes, of course. Thank you for your help Queenie.”</p>
<p>“My pleasure.” The blonde girl giggled again and walked off, being pulled away by Tina. “Maybe we'll see each other at dinner!” She called before they rounded a corner. </p>
<p>“Um, maybe.” Newt muttered, sure that nobody had heard his reply. </p>
<p>That was weird, he thought. Nice, but weird.</p>
<p>He shrugged and turned to face the library doors. He made his way over and opened one of the doors. What greeted him were rows and rows of tall dark wooden shelves filled to the brim with all kinds of books. He couldn't even see where the room ended. He took a few steps into the room, looking around in awe. He had always loved books of all kinds and had spend countless hours in the library at Hogwarts and in his father's private library at home, but they couldn't compare to the size of this room. </p>
<p>A dark, friendly chuckle next to him startled Newt. He turned around to see a friendly looking boy around his age looking at him. He had dark short hair and the beginning fuzz of a mustache on his upper lip. His eyes looked warm and very kind.</p>
<p>“That's everybody's reaction when they first come in here. It's an amazing sight, isn't it? Even after coming in here for over six years, I still get the chills sometimes. So much knowledge confined to a single space. It's amazing. Oh, I'm sorry, the name's Jacob. Jacob Kowalski. I help the librarian out sometimes. You look like you're looking for something. Can I help you?”</p>
<p>“Um, I'm Newt Scamander, it's nice to meet you. And I'm looking for some school books for the seventh year. I was told that I didn't need to buy them and could just borrow them from here.”</p>
<p>Jacob nodded. “Certainly. What subjects are you taking? I'll go and get the books you'll need for your classes.”</p>
<p>“That's really nice of you, thank you. But I can get them myself, I don't want to inconvenience you.”</p>
<p>Jacob laughed good-naturedly and clapped him on the shoulder a little harder than Newt had expected, making Newt stumble for a moment. </p>
<p>“Sorry pal. It's really no problem. Why don't we go and get them together?”</p>
<p>Newt nodded, following him into the maze of shelves that opened up before them. Newt told Jacob which books he needed and the two of them started walking to get them. Jacob kept on chattering cheerily to Newt while Newt just smiled and nodded, not knowing what to say. This didn't seem to bother Jacob, looking quite content while keeping up a conversation without any input from Newt. </p>
<p>After they had found every book Newt needed, they made their way back to the front, checking out the books for Newt. He thanked Jacob profusely for his help, whipped his wand out, muttered Wingardium Leviosa, and made his way out of the library, the borrowed books following him on their own, flying lightly through the air. </p>
<p>He arrived at his room without any problems, put the books on his desk, pushed off his shoes and sat down on his bed. Pickett crawled out of his pocket and made himself comfortable on top of Newt's head. Newt summoned one of the books, cracked it open and immersed himself in his studies. </p>
<p>He had a lot of reading to do.</p>
