          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story starts in Marvolo Gaunt's house, he's been having some doubts about his relationship with his ancestor Gormlaith.</p><p>Gormlaith asked, "What's wrong, Marv?"</p><p>Marvolo muttered, "I've been having some doubts about, well about us and our relationship."</p><p>Gormlaith frowned. "Are you regretting saying yes to going out with me?"</p><p>Marvolo scowled. "No, I'd never regret that; Gorm."</p><p>Gormlaith insisted, "Then tell me what is wrong with you?"</p><p>Marvolo sighed. "After I said yes to you, well the neighbours have been talking. They think that our relationship is wrong because we're related. I know that it's just idle gossip, but I can't help hearing them. I'm doubting us, I love you; but this chatter is driving me up the wall."</p><p>Gormlaith mumbled, "You're doubting us?"</p><p>Marvolo stated, "I want to stop, but I cannot."</p><p>Gormlaith glared at him and told him, "If you're doubting us after a week, how can you expect us to be together for a month or even a year?"</p><p>Marvolo whispered, "I want to push past this, but it's harder than it looks."</p><p>Gormlaith took his hand and smiled weakly. "We can do this, Marv. Together. I believe in us."</p><p>Marvolo beamed back at her, "I believe in us too, Gorm."</p></div>
