    <p>I threw a wish in the well,<br/>Don't ask me, I'll never tell<br/>I looked to you as it fell,<br/>And now you're in my way</p>
<p>I'd trade my soul for a wish,<br/>Pennies and dimes for a kiss<br/>I wasn't looking for this,<br/>But now you're in my way</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The newest Ministry of Magic fountain was downright understated compared to the ones that had been in the hall before. In the center of the fountain, was a plain looking well, done in bronze, and the plaque reads, “To magics we cannot define, and those we can.”</p>
<p>Percy Weasley doesn’t know when the fountain grows on him, but it does. Soon enough, he stands by it for a few minutes at the end of his day, watching the water flow upwards from the well, and puddle in the standing water around the dish part of the fountain. It becomes part of his routine, until one day, as he stands next to the fountain he fishes out a knut, and tosses it into fountain.</p>
<p>A flash of movement catches his eye, and he focuses his sight on the figure standing on the other side of the fountain. The face is familiar, and the man seems to recognize him, but Percy can’t quite put his finger on who it is. The man waves, so Percy waves, and when the man flashes a bright smile, it’s obvious to Percy. Oliver Wood is waving at him across a fountain. Percy realizes that he had forgotten to make a wish, but he doesn’t really need to make one as the other man circles round the fountain to meet up with him.</p>
<p>“Perce, gods, how long has it been?” Percy smiles, and counts back the days in his head.</p>
<p>“It was the ten year banquet, for the battle, wasn’t it?” Oliver swears under his breath.</p>
<p>“Has it really been four years since we’ve seen eachother?” Percy nods. “How are your girls?” Percy flinches.</p>
<p>“The girls are fine. They live with their mother now, pretty much full time.” Oliver’s eyes widen and he rubs at the back of his head nervously.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean ta... I just thought... you were so happy last I saw you.” Percy adjusts his glasses.<br/>“We were, we’re not now, and the girls are fine with it I think. Lucy starts Hogwarts this September.” He remembers Audrey’s pleas for him to understand. That it wasn’t working anymore, that he was different now. Percy has always been dedicated to his work, and he doesn’t know how else to be.</p>
<p>“Well, I just got into the Department of Games and Sports, so, I’ll be seeing you around then?” Of course he’d go that route. He’s retired now, and Percy thinks that a ministry job after a Quidditch career makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>“Owl me, we’ll get lunch sometime.” Percy says, not really meaning anything by it, but Oliver’s gaze turns a bit heated.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we just go get dinner tonight?” There’s something in Oliver’s voice that Percy can’t quite pin down, but he just nods. “Great.” Oliver gestures towards one of the floo exits, and Percy follows dumbly behind.  “Leaky Cauldron okay for a first date?”</p>
