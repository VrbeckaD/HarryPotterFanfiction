  <strong>ACT FOUR | SCENE FOURTEEN</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>HOGWARTS, CLASSROOM</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>SCORPIUS <em>and </em>ALBUS<em> run into a room, full of excitement. They slam the door after themselves.</em></p><p>SCORPIUS: I can’t quite believe I’ve done it.</p><p>ALBUS: I can’t quite believe you’ve done it either.</p><p>SCORPIUS: The team! The actual Slytherin Quidditch team and I am a part of it.</p><p>ALBUS: Scorpius, you—</p><p>SCORPIUS: I know, I know, fifth reserve isn’t exactly top billing—</p><p>ALBUS: You know you aren’t technically on the team—</p><p>SCORPIUS: But it’s a start! You watch, this time next year Malfoy the Unanxious will be Quidditch Captain.</p><p>ALBUS: You are aware that you’re an utter fantasist.</p><p>SCORPIUS: And I’d agree with you – only I have recently been described as ‘wonderfully athletic’…</p><p>ALBUS: In an alternate reality where you were significantly – really significantly, cooler—</p><p>SCORPIUS: Bit harsh.</p><p>ALBUS: And besides, I thought we hated Quidditch?</p><p>SCORPIUS: People can change. And— I’ve been practising.</p><p>ALBUS: Is this another part of your plot to seduce Rose?</p><p>SCORPIUS: Well, I think I have finally learnt to recognise a lost cause when I see one. No, Quidditch is just for me. My dad played you know, he wanted to go professional at one point, but never – well, some other things got in the way. Not that I’m doing it for him. I just think I might – enjoy it, I suppose.</p><p>ALBUS: If it’s really what you want—</p><p>SCORPIUS: I think it is.</p><p>ALBUS: Then – well, I’m proud of you.</p><p>
  <em>Scorpius grins and nudges his friend’s arm playfully.</em>
</p><p>SCORPIUS: Thanks, pal.</p><p>
  <em>A pause. Both begin to speak at the same time.</em>
</p><p>SCORPIUS: Are you—</p><p>ALBUS: Scorpius—</p><p><em>They both stop. Then, all in a rush</em>—</p><p>ALBUS: Look Scorpius, I wanted to say – you know, in Godric’s Hollow we never – when we were interrupted – and you’d said that if you had to choose someone to be with for the return of – well – I’d choose you too.</p><p>
  <em>SCORPIUS stays silent. </em>
</p><p>ALBUS: I just wanted you to know. In case you didn’t. Know, already, I mean. I—</p><p>SCORPIUS: Albus. I know.</p><p>
  <em>They hold a moment’s gaze. Nervous, in uncharted territory.</em>
</p><p>ALBUS <em>(looking away, awkward)</em>: O-okay then.</p><p>
  <em>SCORPIUS pauses, then launches himself at his best friend. They hug, close.</em>
</p><p>ALBUS: What’s this? Are we deciding that we definitely hug now?</p><p>SCORPIUS: I wasn’t sure. Whether we should. In this new version of us I had in my head.</p><p>ALBUS: That’s okay. I think I can cope with the new version.</p><p>SCORPIUS <em>(with a relieved smile)</em>: That makes two of us then. Anyway, are you coming to the library?</p><p>ALBUS: I can’t. My dad’s arranged to come up—</p><p>SCORPIUS: He’s taking time away from the Ministry?</p><p>ALBUS: He wants to go on a walk – something to show me – share with me – something.</p><p>SCORPIUS: A walk?</p><p>ALBUS: I know, I think it’s a bonding thing or something similarly vomit-inducing. Still, you know, I think I’ll go.</p><p>SCORPIUS: You’ll be fine. What’s the worst that can happen? He gives you a well-meaning but misguided gift, you destroy the world as part of an ill-advised teenage rebellion?</p><p>
  <em>ALBUS glares. SCORPIUS pokes his tongue out in jest.</em>
</p><p>SCORPIUS: Okay sorry, sorry, still too soon. We can talk about it though. When you get back.</p><p>ALBUS: Yeah – yeah. That would be good.</p><p>
  <em>They share a smile.</em>
</p><p>ALBUS: I’ll see you at dinner.</p></div>
