    <p>“Shit.” Harry muttered, covering his head and ducking as his potion exploded.<br/> <br/> Outraged shrieks and exclamations filled the room.<br/> <br/> “<em>Mister</em> Potter,” Snape growled, casting a nonverbal scourgify, “Your ineptitude will <em>never</em> fail to astound me. Detention with me, every night, at eight o’clock. For a <em>month</em>.” He finished.<br/> <br/> Harry stood up, his fists clenched at his sides. “But that’s until the end of the year!” He argued. <br/> <br/> Snape smirked. “I’d be glad for that, if I were you. Otherwise, I could make this punishment last even longer.” He said with obvious satisfaction. <br/> <br/> Harry glowered back, sitting down heavily. “Yes, <em>Sir</em>.” He said, spitting out the last word as though it were a curse. <br/> <br/> Hermione sent him a sympathetic look. Harry shrugged sullenly in response.<br/> </p><p>*****<br/> <br/> “Seriously, mate, I feel for you. That greasy git is the stuff of nightmares, and no one should have to spend that much time with him. If you ask me, Dumbledore should have left him with you-know-who to die.” Ron said in between bites of his dinner. <br/> <br/> Hermione sighed. “Honestly, Ron. Say it with me: Vol-de-mort. Anyway, I’m sure it can’t be all that bad, Harry. What’s the worst that could happen?” <br/> <br/> Harry sighed. “I don’t even want to think about it. I might make it happen.” <br/> </p><p>*****<br/> <br/> Harry walked into the Potions classroom at exactly eight o’clock. “Sir?” He asked, seeing Snape seated at his desk, grading essays. <br/> <br/> Snape looked up. “Potter. You will be brewing a potion tonight. I expect you to follow the directions <em>exactly</em>. If you make a mistake, I will know. Directions are on the board. Begin.” He said, then turned back to his papers. He knew the potion would be inadequate, but maybe the boy would be able to learn the value of paying attention to detail, as he had obviously not done earlier that day.<br/> <br/> Harry got the things he’d need out of the supply cupboard, and sat down in front of the cauldron he was obviously meant to use. He concentrated on following the directions exactly, and before he knew it, he had finished the potion. <br/> <br/> He looked up and met Snape’s thoughtful gaze. “Finished, Sir.” <br/> <br/> Snape walked over and examined the potion. He bent and inhaled deeply. “Very well.” He said, his eyes narrowed. “You may go.” <br/> <br/> Harry stood and hurried out. <br/> <br/> ‘If he managed to botch a simple potion such as the ones we made today, how could he brew one that exceeds N.E.W.T. standards so easily? Moreover, how did he manage to do it <em>perfectly</em>?’ Snape wondered. He quickly poured some into a vial and went to send it to Malfoy Manor.<br/> <br/> *****<br/> <br/> “So, he’s punishing you for exploding your potion by having you brew more potions?” Ron asked. “Not the best idea, if you ask me.” <br/> <br/> Hermione shrugged. “He may think you just need more practice.” She pointed out. <br/> <br/> Harry sighed. “I honestly don’t understand his reasoning, but it’s better than scrubbing cauldrons.” He conceded.<br/> <br/> *****</p><p> </p><p>The next few nights, Harry was again unwittingly brewing extremely difficult potions perfectly.<br/> <br/> After the fourth perfect potion, Snape decided to confront Harry on the subject of his deliberate idiocy. <br/> <br/> “Potter.” Snape drawled as the Gryffindor walked into the room for his detention. “Why is it that you manage never to brew a perfect potion in class, but you can perfectly brew the potions I’ve been assigning you for these detentions? They are all at least twice as difficult as those you’re screwing up in class on a daily basis.” He said acidly.<br/> <br/> Harry gaped at him. “I... Didn’t know that, Sir. I guess it might be because you never insult me during the detentions, so I can concentrate on the potion. In class, I can’t think of anything but trying to avoid losing Gryffindor points.” He admitted.<br/> <br/> Snape narrowed his eyes in thought. “Very well. We will need to try to overcome our differences in order to further your progress in class. I would like your assistance with a potion I am trying to create. It should counter the effects of Dementors. A simple cheering potion has, thus far, proven insufficient for the task.” <br/> <br/> Harry nodded. Did this mean that Snape finally saw him as an equal? ‘Well, whatever brought this on, I might as well accept it and seize the opportunity to make another powerful ally.’ He decided.<br/> <br/> “However, that is a job for a different day.” Snape continued. “Tonight, you will be brewing another batch of the first one you brewed.” He finished.<br/> <br/> Harry nodded. “Sir, may I ask what it’s for?” He asked.<br/> <br/> Snape smirked. “You may. It is a potion to help ease the strain a difficult pregnancy can put a woman under.” <br/> <br/> Harry felt a brief flash of anger at the thought that Snape was to be a father, which was totally irrational. “Congratulations, Sir.” He said softly.<br/> <br/> Snape sneered at him. “<em>I’m</em> not the father, idiot boy! It’s for Narcissa Malfoy. She had trouble enough carrying Draco to full term. Without this potion, another pregnancy may well kill her. Unfortunately, the fool desperately wants a girl, so she refuses to listen to reason and take a contraceptive potion.” <br/> <br/> Harry blinked. “Oh.” Was all he could think to say. He was now privy to details of Malfoy senior’s sex life that he could have spent a blissful eternity ignorant of. Namely, the fact that it still existed.<br/> <br/> Snape sighed. “Lucius has defected to the light, or I wouldn’t be doing this for him. If you tell anyone about his new loyalties, however, I will be forced to kill you.” He said tonelessly.<br/> <br/> Harry took a deep breath and nodded. “Yes, Sir.” <br/> <br/> Snape nodded once. “You may begin, Potter.” He said, heading to his desk.<br/> <br/> Harry worked on the potion, finally realizing why Snape loved the subject so much. It was exact, subtle, and impersonal, much like the man himself. He finished the potion twice as fast as he had last time. “Finished, Sir.” He said softly.<br/> <br/> Snape looked up from the essays he was grading in surprise. “Already?” He asked. <br/> <br/> Harry nodded.<br/> <br/> Snape walked over and examined the potion. Once again, he was forced to deem it perfect. He blinked in shock. “Very well.” He said, his voice even. “You may spend the rest of your time here brewing another potion of your choice. My books are there,” He said, gesturing to a cupboard the class never used. “You may choose any potion you like.” <br/> <br/> Harry blinked in surprise. He was sure that no other student had been given permission to even <em>touch</em> any of Snape’s books. So, why would Snape choose him to have the honor? He got up and opened the cupboard, then gasped. It was actually a library, and it looked as though some of the books hadn’t been touched in centuries, yet they were all perfectly preserved. “Sir?” He breathed in awe.<br/> <br/> Snape’s smirk was evident in his voice. “I’m sure you know that the dungeons were Salazar Slytherin’s domain of choice? That, Potter, is his personal library. However, if you touch a book of his that does not view you as worthy, rest assured that it will make its indignation clear to you.” Harry could clearly hear the amusement in his tone.<br/> <br/> “Yes, Sir.” Harry said, heading into the large room. He saw a book that had a red-and-gold binding, and began to reach for it, curiously. Before his hand touched it, a small bolt of lightning zapped his hand. “Ow.” He muttered. “Temperamental bloody book.” He left it alone and felt a bit of a pull towards the back of the room. He followed it and his hand was drawn to an emerald green book with silver lettering that warmed in his hands as he picked it up, as if to welcome him. After reading the title, ‘Potions of the Skilled,’ he realized that the handwriting looked slightly off. Then he realized why and gasped. “The book is in Parseltongue!” He whispered to himself. He brought it out of the library. <br/> <br/> Snape looked over at him and saw the book. “How in the name of Merlin did you manage to get that book?! It won’t even let me touch it! And how do you plan to read it if it’s not in English or even Latin?!” <br/> <br/> Harry looked up at him. “It was calling to me. And I <em>can</em> read it, Sir. It’s written in Parseltongue.” He explained. <br/> <br/> Snape stared at him for a long moment. “Indeed? Could you tell me what the subject matter is?” He asked.<br/> <br/> Harry flushed. “Potions. The title is ‘Potions of the Skilled.’”<br/> <br/> Snape sighed, burying his face in his hands. “So it is a book of potions that only a Parselmouth can brew. Wonderful. And it chose you to be the one to use it.” He looked at Harry. “Would you mind reading some of the potions aloud for me so that I can write them?”<br/> <br/> Harry nodded and opened the book, then began to read. <br/> <br/> “All of these potions are intended to enhance the life of a Parselmouth in some way, whether by helping one to develop their fledgling gift, or to increase their power, or even to find their perfect mate.” <br/> <br/> “Potter.” Snape sighed.<br/> <br/> Harry looked up, noticing that Snape was a bit flushed. ‘Shit.’ He thought. ‘I’ve made him angry.’ <br/> <br/> “Potter, you are speaking Parseltongue.” He said evenly.<br/> <br/> Harry flushed. “Right. Well, it says--” Harry paused as his throat refused to produce sound. “It seems I can’t tell you.” <br/> <br/> Snape growled—actually <em>growled</em>—and Harry shivered as the sound shot straight to his cock. “Damn book! Bloody founders!” <br/> <br/> Harry laughed, abruptly turning it into a choke. <br/> <br/> Snape shot him a glare for his trouble. “If the book chose you, Potter, then you should keep it, for the time being. If you wish to brew any of the potions it contains, you may do so, but if you use the last of any of my ingredients, it is your job to replace them. You can have unlimited access to this classroom. However, at night there are wards on this room. I will adjust them to allow you in, but do not bring any of your little friends, as they will be severely injured by the wards.” He finished.<br/> <br/> Harry nodded. “Yes, Sir.” He said, then began to get a cauldron ready to brew one of the potions he had noticed. It would let him into the mind of the person that best suited him while keeping that person oblivious of the presence spying on them. That way, he’d be able to decide how to approach that person best at his own leisure. It would take a week to brew. And he was more than willing to put time into it to get the one thing he wanted most: someone to love him for <em>who</em> he was, not <em>what</em>. <br/> </p><p>*****<br/> <br/> Snape sighed, massaging his temples. He heard a sound coming from the table Harry was working at and nearly groaned when his ears finally caught the sounds of soft hissing. Apparently, Harry was muttering to himself in Parseltongue. After trying off and on last night, they had concluded that the instructions to the potions in Salazar Slytherin’s book could only be spoken in Parseltongue or not at all. <br/> <br/> ‘Why,’ Snape wondered, exasperated, ‘must Harry speak the instructions as he works? Moreover, why must Parseltongue sound so bloody sexy coming from him? <em>And since when is he Harry</em>?! <em>Damn</em>!’ He gritted his teeth, laying his forehead on his desk.<br/> <br/> “Sir, are you ill?” Harry’s voice cut through his mental tirade against Parselmouths everywhere. <br/> <br/> Snape raised his head and glared at him. “No. Get back to work, if you please. Be glad that I’m not having you scrub cauldrons.” He snapped. <br/> <br/> Harry’s cheeks colored and he bit his lip before replying, “This potion needs to stand for twenty-four hours before I continue.” At least he was allowed to say that much in English. <br/> <br/> Snape sighed in disgust, secretly relieved. No more muttering would do wonders for his mood. “Then find something to do.” He said, bored. <br/> <br/> “I was wondering if I could talk to you, Sir?” Harry asked, nervously. <br/> <br/> Snape raised a brow. “About?” <br/> <br/> “Well,” Harry began, “I’ve heard that wizards aren’t as uptight about some things as Muggles are.” He said, flushing further.<br/> <br/> “What things, specifically?” Snape asked, trying to keep a hold on his temper. If Harry was going to skate around the subject, this discussion could very well last all night.<br/> <br/> “Well, homosexuality, for one.” He said quietly. “Is that true?” <br/> <br/> Snape smirked. “As there are many potions that can make it possible for a man to carry and give birth to a child, it is more acceptable in our world, yes. But this begs the question of our Golden Boy’s sexual tastes. <em>Are</em> you homosexual, Potter?” <br/> <br/> Harry turned a remarkable shade of red. “Yes.” He whispered.<br/> <br/> “Well, well, well. Who would have thought? How very... Deviant of you, Potter.” Snape purred.<br/> <br/> Harry met Snape’s eyes suddenly. “What about <em>you</em>, Professor?” He shot back. “I’ve heard rumors about you.” <br/> <br/> Snape’s eyes hardened. “What I do in my spare time is <em>not</em> your concern!” He hissed angrily.<br/> <br/> Harry gulped. “What if I wanted you to do something with <em>me</em> in your spare time?” He asked in a whisper, staring at the floor.<br/> <br/> Snape hardened at the thought. “You aren’t of legal age to decide that in our world, you have to be seventeen, and I have no wish to kiss a Dementor for <em>forcing</em> the Boy-Who-Lived.” He said.<br/> <br/> Harry blinked in shock, looking at him again. “But I <em>asked</em> for it!” He protested. <br/> <br/> Snape snorted. “And do you think society would accept that? You forget, <em>Harry</em>, that I am a Death Eater.” He declared, unabashed.<br/> <br/> “What about when I’m of age?” Harry pressed. <br/> <br/> Snape sighed. The boy was stubborn, he’d give him that. “Then, if you still feel that way, we will discuss the possibility.”<br/> <br/> Harry bit his lip to force his voice not to waver. “And what if one, or both, of us die before that? What then? I don’t want to look back and wonder what could have been!” He said, nearly yelling. <br/> <br/> Snape stood up and leaned over Harry, his eyes full of fury—and no small amount of fear at himself. “First, I will ask you to please keep your voice down, as sound carries quite well in the dungeons. Second, if either of us should die in the war, it will be for a more important cause then the satisfaction of your libido. Please remember that what we will do must be done to ensure safety for millions of children, wizard and Muggle alike, throughout the world.” He hissed. <br/> <br/> Harry swallowed. “My libido? Fine. Right. Good night, Sir.” He forced out through a throat tight with tears, then gathered his things and left. At least he’d be able to have love from <em>someone</em>, if this potion worked. Even if it wasn’t the one person he admired the most.<br/> </p><p>*****</p><p><br/> Harry watched Snape throughout the next potions class. He had stopped antagonizing Harry, whose work had improved as a result, and he found himself wondering more about why he had propositioned Snape if he was going to find out who his perfect match was in just two days’ time. <br/> <br/> After all, he wanted to give <em>that</em> person his virginity, right? It wasn’t like he was looking to just throw it away on anyone. <br/> <br/> But Snape <em>was</em>, after all, one of the few people Harry felt he could relate to. He was just as involved, and had as much risk, in the war going on as Harry himself was and did. Not to mention that he was extremely attractive for his age, skilled in his art, strong enough to protect someone he cared about deeply enough and, when it came to the Dark Arts, a force to be reckoned with.<br/> <br/> “Potter?” Snape’s voice broke into his thoughts and Harry realized that everyone was putting their things away. <br/> <br/> “Sorry, Professor.” Harry mumbled, blushing a bit at being caught daydreaming in potions class, of all places.<br/> <br/> “Ten points from Gryffindor for daydreaming and you may stay after to make up for what you have missed from my lecture.” He said, leaving to snap at Neville for knocking over a vial of boomslang skin.<br/> <br/> Harry sighed, laying his forehead against the desk in defeat. Now he really <em>was</em> in trouble. Snape <em>had</em> to know what he had been thinking about; there was no way he <em>couldn’t</em>.<br/> <br/> Hermione and Ron gave him sympathetic looks and got up, leaving him behind as the classroom emptied. <br/> <br/> Harry looked up to see Snape talking to Draco in low tones by the door. Draco smirked and said something Harry couldn’t make out completely, but he knew he heard his name. Snape’s lips thinned and he grabbed Draco’s arm roughly, shoving him out the door as the teen snickered. <br/> <br/> Snape then turned to Harry. “Potter, I talked to Dumbledore last night, and he has told me that there are a few changes he wants to make to your schedule for the last few weeks of your schooling. He felt it would be beneficial for you to learn some of the common curses and counter curses that the Death Eaters will be inclined to use against you in the war, should you have to face them in combat.”<br/> <br/> “And you’re the only one here that can teach me.” Harry finished.<br/> <br/> Snape nodded. “Indeed. We will be starting as soon as you have the potion you have started finished, so that you don’t risk ruining it and wasting all the time and ingredients you have used on it thus far.” He said.<br/> <br/> Harry sighed. “Okay. Sir?”<br/> <br/> Snape narrowed his eyes. “What?” <br/> <br/> Harry flushed. “I’m sorry for how I acted last night. I suppose it’s just the fact that I’m all too aware of my own mortality now that caused me to propose what I did. I shouldn’t have overstepped the bounds of the teacher-student relationship.” He said.<br/> <br/> Snape nodded. “Accepted. See that it doesn’t happen again.” He said, turning to walk back to his desk. “You may leave now, if you promise to use Ms. Granger’s notes to study.”<br/> <br/> Harry nodded eagerly and left, deciding to find Ron and Hermione and let them know that he was going to be looking for a relationship, or at least a fling, before he had to dedicate his life to killing a madman. Best that they be aware of it so he didn’t have to lie to them when he found someone.<br/> </p><p>*****<br/> <br/> Harry smiled, walking to the potions room to finish his potion as he looked forward to the night he had planned. After his apology to Snape the day before, he had come clean to Hermione and Ron about his sexual preferences, and they had accepted them (Hermione had already known for some time). <br/> <br/> He had also approached Seamus Finnegan about a one-week period of experimentation so that he could learn more about what his orientation entailed and, after a bit of coercing, Seamus had managed to get his boyfriend, Justin Finch-Fletchley, to not only agree to it, but to help educate Harry. They were going to be meeting in an abandoned classroom that night at eleven. Harry was both excited and nervous about it, having never even kissed another guy before. He had no idea how far they wanted to take things. <br/> <br/> He walked into the class to find his potion shimmering, slowly turning emerald green. He ran to get the last ingredient and a knife. As he added the tiniest amount of lacewing flies, the potion shimmered and turned silver. Harry took a deep breath and held his arm over the potion, pressing the knife to his skin. He gritted his teeth and drew the knife quickly across his arm, cutting deeply enough to cause his own blood to drip rapidly into the cauldron.<br/> <br/> Snape hissed and averted his eyes, trying to keep his reaction under control. Once he heard Harry spell the wound shut, he stood and stalked over to the boy. “Potter, did you deliberately fail to mention that this particular potion was <em>blood magic</em>? You <em>are</em> aware that blood magic has been illegal for centuries?”<br/> <br/> Harry filled a vial and used a spell to dispose of the rest of the potion. “It isn’t harmful, and no one will ever know that it even existed, so I didn’t see the problem, Sir.” He replied calmly.<br/> <br/> Snape gritted his teeth. “Fine.” He snapped, stalking to his desk to grade essays. “On your own head be it.” <br/> <br/> Harry placed the vial in his pocket, where he would let it sit until tomorrow morning, when it would be ready to take. Whether or not he would keep meeting with Seamus and Justin after he took it would depend on who it was and if he had time to kill waiting for that person to notice him.<br/> <br/> Harry decided to hang out in the library for the rest of his “detention” and explore some more books in there. He walked in and began moving along the shelves. Again, he tried to retrieve the red-and-gold book, and again it rejected him, though not as strongly this time. Harry frowned and moved on. <br/> <br/> He felt himself drawn to a small cupboard, which had a lock on it that seemed to be made of solid gold. He wondered if it could be unlocked magically, but if it could, then why was there such a thick layer of dust on the handle? <br/> <br/> He used alohomora on it, just in case, and it clicked and swung open. Inside was a small gold book with maroon lettering on it that read: For My Heir, When the Time is Right. Underneath the words was a picture of a rearing lion. Harry recognized the book as Godric Gryffindor’s and put it in his pocket, deciding he’d read it later. The cupboard shut on its own, and no matter what he did, he could not reopen it.<br/> <br/> Harry shrugged and turned to leave, but instead found himself staring at a door that had just appeared in the wall. It was behind the closet that Snape kept his supplies in. Why would there suddenly be a door there?<br/> <br/> Then, he saw Snape walk into the room. Snape stopped as he caught sight of the door that had Harry so transfixed. “When did that appear?” He asked.<br/> <br/> Harry shook his head, dazed. “Just now, Sir.” He answered.<br/> <br/> Snape met Harry’s eyes and looked back at the door. “Let’s find out what’s in there, then.” He said, heading for it.<br/> <br/> Harry gasped as Snape opened the door. Inside were portraits of Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin... together. And not just together, but... <em>Doing things</em> together! <br/> <br/> Harry’s face flushed as he looked around at the pictures of the two men in rather amorous situations. One of the pictures, in which the two men were lying in bed with the covers over their bottom halves, was the only animated one in the room. Thankfully.<br/> <br/> “Hello!” The form of Godric Gryffindor called cheerfully, waving at them. <br/> <br/> Salazar glared at them from over his shoulder, where he was spooned up against the other man. “<em>That</em> is the boy? Godric, you said he was attractive.” <br/> <br/> Gryffindor flushed. “Well, he is! Look at him! Looks a lot like me at that age!” He argued. <br/> <br/> Slytherin raised a brow. “Indeed. Pity.” <br/> <br/> Gryffindor smiled. “And you must be the present Potions Master? Severus Snape, was it?” <br/> <br/> Snape nodded curtly. <br/> <br/> Gryffindor hummed, thoughtfully. “There is a lot of tension between you two. This will simply not do. I had hoped that you would have discovered by now that some things can’t be left to chance, Severus.” Godric said, sounding exasperated.<br/> <br/> Slytherin sighed. “Let me, Godric.” He said, kissing the other man on the temple. “Severus, you have let things keep you from what you want, and sometimes, what you <em>need</em>, for far too long. It is past time for you to just take what you crave, no matter what anyone else would say about it. And I assure you, the time to do it is now. If you do not act soon enough, all will be lost. Not only your sense of self, but also the whole of the Wizarding world’s future will be ruined. Once you have taken hold of that one thing you need above all else, that book which so intrigues both of you will be yours to read. It will not open for you until you both are ready to read what it is that must be done to ensure that your mission is successful.” He finished. <br/> <br/> Gryffindor rolled his eyes. “Yes, and that wasn’t cryptic at all. I’m sure Harry knows exactly what you were talking about.”<br/> <br/> Slytherin sighed. “It wasn’t <em>his</em> message to understand. You know he is not ready to hear the whole of it.” <br/> <br/> Gryffindor shrugged. “True. Severus, you know that your time is running out. When did you reach maturity?” <br/> <br/> Snape ground his teeth. “Enough already! Bloody nosy portraits! Come on, Potter. Let’s get out of here.” He snarled, leaving the room. <br/> <br/> “His plans for tonight will ruin it all!” Slytherin called after them.<br/> <br/> Harry checked the time. 10:57.<br/> <br/> “Professor, it’s almost eleven-“ <br/> <br/> “Leave.” Snape sighed.<br/> <br/> Harry smiled and left.<br/> <br/> *****</p><p><br/> Severus sighed, massaging his temples. They had to go and remind him of his damned race and his darker side. He wasn’t feeling the call to kill <em>that</em> strongly yet. Although the scent of Harry’s blood still filled him with a desperate longing that bordered on excruciating pain, even if it was now just a memory. <br/> <br/> He thought back to their words. He couldn’t just take Harry yet. He was too young, and he had to stay innocent until he was ready for their bonding. <br/> <br/> ‘His plans for tonight will ruin it all.’<br/> <br/> Severus’ eyes snapped open and he stood, striding out of the room. “Damn that foolish boy!” He snarled, pulling out his wand. “Point me Harry Potter!”</p>
