    <p><em>"I am going to strangle you,"</em> Professor Erwood threatened, glaring at his husband.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Awstin just laughed, "I'd like to see you try."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I will <em>literally</em> strangle you." Professor Erwood repeated, clutching the knife in a deathly white grip.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Pretty sure it's illegal to kill somebody," Awstin said, popping a strawberry in his mouth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Is it illegal to kill a <em>prat?"</em> Professor Erwood demanded, slamming the knife down on the counter. "I <em>told</em> you not to eat any more strawberries."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"What is <em>happening?"</em> Draco asked, hovering in the doorway with the letter that his mother had just sent him in his hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Oh! Morning, Draco." Professor Erwood said. "I was wondering if—<em>can you not listen for one minute, you dollophead? Stop eating the strawberries!</em>—you wanted to go to the Quidditch World Cup? I'm not that interested in it, but this prat—" he jerked his thumb at Awstin, "—wants to see a game and I know that you like it a lot—obviously, because you're a seeker, but—"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Really?" Draco asked. "That'd be incredible!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Okay, I'll book the tickets—" Professor Erwood paused as Draco grabbed a strawberry off of the cutting board. Then he sighed, picked the knife back up, tossed it carelessly in the sink, and walked out the door.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco panicked for half a second that he'd crossed a line he shouldn't have, but Awstin just smiled at him and grabbed another strawberry. "How's your summer homework coming?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Er—it's going well. I was just about to write a letter to Mother." Draco said, sitting down at the table. "What are these strawberries for?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"No idea," Awstin grinned, popping another one in his mouth.</p>
