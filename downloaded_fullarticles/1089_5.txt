    <p>Hadrian</p><p> </p><p>Chapter 1: summers end</p><p> </p><p>This summer has flown bye, or perhaps I've just been so busy.  There's my normal classes that have been going well.  I also have a new tutor named Callum who is teaching me anatomy and physiology and basic first aid.  It's pretty fascinating and he teaches an EMT course that he says I can sign up for as soon as I get my GED.  </p><p> </p><p>Then I've been meeting new hexens.  Mrs. Rosa has been working really hard, not just teaching me but searching out hexens to bond into our coven.  So far five have shown up.  Dad suggested three of them, Josie, Madeline, and Selene.   Mrs. Rosa has found the other two, Miya and Peyton.</p><p> </p><p>Josie and Madeline have been together for like a decade and are mostly looking for a coven that will let them live their own lives.  They want to remain together but they also want children and are hopeful that I will help them whether or not we bond.  Or even if I only bond one, like with Mrs. Rosa and Mrs. Lupita.</p><p> </p><p>Then theres Selene.  A tall pale brown skinned woman, beautiful with pale lavender hair braided in two rows down the back of her head to hang over her shoulders.  She was nervous when she got here, cautious and restrained.  She seemed polite if a little standoffish and wary still.</p><p> </p><p>She's married to a blutebad named Sculley.  But he was friendly, a bit challenging, but not really threatening.  He's a big biker type with thick brown hair down to his shoulders and a bushy beard.  Beyond a bit of posturing he hasn't caused any problems.</p><p> </p><p>Of the ones Mrs. Rosa chose, Miya is small with pale blond hair and big blue eyes in a soft round face.  She's only twenty and currently in school to be a nurse.  She's friendly enough, third daughter of five from a mother who isn't bonded into a coven.  She's quiet and helpful.  Both dad and I agree that she seems a good fit so far.</p><p> </p><p>Then theres Peyton.  She's a halfbreed, her hexen mother is married- Married!- to her steinadler father.  Her mother is dark skinned with a head full of long thin braids that end in vibrant ruby red.  Her father is pale with curly red hair going grey at the temples and pale blue eyes.  </p><p> </p><p>Peyton has her father's pale blue eyes, soft curly black hair, her mother's nose and smile, and a splatter of freckles across her light brown skin.  She's bright and happy and excitable but also nervous when she first woged.  Not that I blame her.  Even dad doesn't like to woge because of the stigma attached.  </p><p> </p><p>When she does woge, you can see the flesh twist and ripple across one eye, over her nose, and up both sides of her jaw.  The only portion unchanged is one blue eye and a bit of skin near that temple.  She's a halfbreed just like dad.  So we don't comment, we just withdrawal our woge and carry on the conversation.</p><p> </p><p>She's young too, only eighteen, and excited for college.  She wants to be a lawyer, do a lot of good that way.  And she's smart, quick witted.  With a bright smile and hopeful looks to her parents who relax more and more throughout the meeting.</p><p> </p><p>I don't have any objections to these hexens but as Mrs. Rosa suggested we are having a trial run of sorts.  We don't want to bond someone who won't fit with our family so they're going to stay for a few months to decide if we all want to go forward.  Truly, I appreciate the advice and caution Mrs. Rosa offers.</p><p> </p><p> So while the summer is coming to an end and the younger two will begin classes soon dad and I need to make a decision.  So I make supper, a grilled chicken breast with a lemon butter sauce and some lightly breaded zucchini and sweet potato fries.  Dad smiles as he settles at the table.  </p><p> </p><p>It's just the two of us today.  Most evenings we have Carmen, Nina, or Mrs. Rosa over with one or two of the other hexens.  It was Mrs. Rosa's idea to share meals so that we can get to know each other.  And its been nice, really nice.  But tonight its just dad and I.</p><p> </p><p>Dad takes a bite of the chicken, offering a compliment with a sip of wine.  I nibble on one of the sweet potato fries, noting the flavors of salt and rosemary.  He huffs, amused, and waves me to speak up.  </p><p> </p><p>With a blush at my own impatience I ask dad what he thinks.  He hums and answers, "It's your opinion more than mine that is important here.  But my opinion is that they are all good, but do you want them bound?"</p><p> </p><p>And that's the question isn't it.  I start with the ones dad suggested, "Josie and Madeline seem nice.  I'm not sure how invested they would be in the coven.  They seem more interested in starting up their own family."</p><p> </p><p>He nods along as if he already made that realization.  So I add, "I don't think I mind them living here but I'm not sure they would fit well with our coven."</p><p> </p><p>Again he nods like he expected as much.  So I continue, "With Selene and Sculley, I think it's the same.  She doesn't like Zauberbeists and I don't think she would be comfortable in a coven.  I don't see a problem with them living here but I don't think we should bond them in."</p><p> </p><p>He smiles, "I agree.  Sculley is a mechanic, they both are, and they've already asked for permision to open a garage."</p><p> </p><p>I nod agreeing and answer, "I'll let Mrs. Rosa know and we can meet them for lunch tomorrow and discuss it."</p><p> </p><p>He agrees.  So I approach the next two.  "Miya," I start, "is nice.  I think she could probably make herself comfortable in any coven.  I also think with her personality, calming as it is, that there would be less tension during the integration."</p><p> </p><p>He smiles, "And your a little sweet on her."</p><p> </p><p>I blush but he waves it off with a calm, "That's all part of a coven so no worries there.  You're right, I think she's a good choice."</p><p> </p><p>I grin bashful as I bring up the last.  "I like Peyton as well," I confess.  "I think she's funny and brilliant and smart.  She has an awesome smile and she loves to laugh.  I think she would fit well."</p><p> </p><p>He chuckles, "Yes, I've noticed.  You and her manage to keep the whole table in stitches during supper."</p><p> </p><p>But he approves so I take the teasing.  I'm glad we agree.  And dad offers to have the bonding before the next council meeting.  I agree as long as he requests that the eisbieber's lodge doesn't go crazy with gifts again.  As much as I loved them, and I did, it was all a bit too much.  Although the carved wooden table does look beautiful in our living room.  And the armoire still smells wonderfully of cedar.</p><p> </p><p>At least it wasn't as bad as what they did for detective Burkhart.  Poor fella helped them out on a case against some hasslishlin and they totally overwhelmed his house in gift baskets.  At least they're not afraid of him now.  Especially after he took out two Reapers.  Dad thought that was funny.</p><p> </p><p>I nudge dad's foot and ask, "Have you thought anymore on whether or not we should bring Nick in on the council."</p><p> </p><p>He hums but takes a minute to answer.  "I will talk with him and the council.  But yes, I think it will be good."</p>
