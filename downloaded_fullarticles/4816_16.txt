    <p>Harry leaned against the compartment door, waiting for Ron and Hermione to finish with their prefect meeting. He sighed. They were five minutes late already. Chuckling, he assumed Hermione made everyone review the rules. Twice.</p><p>Finally, the compartment door slid open and he found himself face to face with Malfoy. He stuck out his foot, trying not to laugh as Malfoy tripped over it. Old habits died hard.</p><p>"What the hell, Potter?"</p><p>Harry shrugged. "Oh, did I do that?"</p><p>Malfoy whipped out his wand, narrowing his eyes, and Harry followed suit, both glaring at each other. Without Harry noticing, Ron had exited the prefect's compartment, standing behind them, clearly torn between encouraging Harry and stopping him from fighting.</p><p>Hermione rushed between them. "Are you <i>kidding</i> me? Malfoy, we <i>just</i> reviewed the expectations for behavior on the train. Twice!"</p><p>Harry smirked at how he guessed correctly, but then Hermione turned on him. "And <i>you</i>. You should know better than to pick a fight before we even get to Hogwarts!  I expected more from you, Harry."</p><p>He shrank, slumping his shoulders and avoiding her stern gaze. He put his wand away. "Sorry, 'Mione."</p><p>Malfoy didn't put his wand away, but he lowered it and stalked off, shoving his way into an empty compartment toward the end of the train and slamming  the door shut.</p><p>Hermione turned to Harry. "Ron and I have to patrol the corridors. Can you stop yourself from starting any other fights or do you need to come with us?"</p><p>Harry sighed. "I can handle myself, Hermione."</p><p>"See that you do."</p><p>With that, Hermione and Ron walked over to a compartment filled with first year students. Harry watched them leave and exhaled, thankful that he had survived Hermioneâ€™s wrath. Once he made sure the coast was clear, he walked down the train hallway, sliding the door open and slipping through.</p><p>Strong arms spun Harry around quickly and pushed him down onto the bench, his mouth suddenly assaulted by Malfoy's lips. Harry moaned and wrapped his arms around Draco; he had missed doing this all summer.</p><p>"Did you <i>have</i> to trip me, you berk?"</p><p>Harry adjusted his glasses and looked up into Draco's eyes. "Sorry, I just wanted to get your attention."</p><p>"Do you think they've guessed that we're together yet?"</p><p>He shook his head. "No, but we've probably only got a few weeks until Hermione figures it out."</p><p>"Let's enjoy the privacy while we can, then." Draco licked his lips and suddenly, Harry couldn't remember what they were talking about.</p><p>Draco dipped his head down for another kiss, and Harry melted into the kiss, forgetting about everything else going on outside of the Hogwarts Express. For now, it was just him and Draco.</p>
