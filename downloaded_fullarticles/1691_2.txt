          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story begins in Horace Slughorn's office beside the potions classroom. His boyfriend Elphias Doge is visiting him.</p><p>Horace grumbled. "I'm too old for this teaching malarkey."</p><p>Elphias smiled. "Maybe, but no one can teach potions like you. Not even Severus Snape, Merlin rest his soul."</p><p>Horace grinned. "You're right, my dear Elphias. I shall be teaching here until the day I die."</p><p>Elphias smirked. "I certainly hope not, Horace. I don't want you to be working here when you're eighty."</p><p>Horace sighed. "Making potions makes me happy and teaching others how to make them makes me even happier. But I suppose that I must retire one day."</p><p>Elphias suggested, "Maybe you can create your own line of potions after you retire, that way you can hire proteges and still make potions."</p><p>Horace beamed, "What an excellent idea!"</p><p>Elphias replied, "I think that we'll survive when we're retired."</p><p>Horace concurred, "We'll be just fine."</p></div>
