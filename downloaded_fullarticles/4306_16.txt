<p>Reaching for the knob<br/>She waits for him<br/>Heart in her feet<br/>Scars on her arms</p>
<p>Searching in the dark<br/>He aches for her<br/>Sapphires reflect his soul<br/>Legs fail his body</p>
<p>Leaning into the door<br/>She aches for him<br/>Amber holds her heart<br/>Hands fail her truths</p>
<p>Turning against the tide<br/>He wants her touch<br/>Ginger ruffled in his touch<br/>Wishes in his heart</p>
<p>Walking into the tide<br/>She wants his voice<br/>Curls tossed in her tremors<br/>Worries in her mind</p>
<p>Leaning on the door<br/>He opens to her<br/>Sapphires searching her soul<br/>Legs fail her body</p>
<p>Searching in the dark<br/>She falls into him<br/>Amber shimmers for him<br/>Hands fail his truths</p>
<p>Reaching for the knob<br/>He closes her in<br/>Heart in her hands<br/>Scars on his soul</p>
<p>Staring at the wall<br/>She pulls him in <br/>Heart in his feet<br/>Scars on her arms</p>
<p>Turning against the tide<br/>He touches her face<br/>Curls wind around his fingers<br/>Wishes in his heart</p>
<p>Walking into the tide<br/>She touches his face<br/>Ginger slides through her fingers<br/>Love in her heart</p></div>
