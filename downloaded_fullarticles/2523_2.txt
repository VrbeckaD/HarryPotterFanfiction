    <p>It was a crisp November morning. The first of November to be exact. The moon had just set, and Remus John Lupin laid in the cold dark basement of his house with his eyes closed. Next to him sat a big black dog waiting. When Remus opened his eyes, he groaned and looked at the dog as he turned back into his best friend Sirius Orion Black. “Sirius?” Remus said voice raspy and quiet.  Sirius nods and smiled at him but it did not reach his eyes. “How did,”</p><p>“He’s not a werewolf. Edward, Teddy is not a werewolf we went through this Moony,” Remus smiled and closed his eyes. “You are going straight to bed Moony,” Sirius helped Remus up and led him out of the basement.</p><p>              Remus was asleep for most of the day however when he woke he was not in his bed nor was he in his house. Remus looked around and sniffed the air. His werewolf nose picked up the smell of trees and mud. Remus then sat up patted his coat for his wand and tried to sit up but he fell back down making a noise. Remus sighed and looked around. “Where in the name of Merlin am I?” the werewolf asked out loud. Half hoping and half not wanting someone to hear him.  “Sirius were are you?” he asked himself now as his eyes slowly closed.</p><p>              A young warlock was walking through the wood along with his king and friend. The warlock’s name was Merlin and his king, well Arthur Pendragon.  “Hurry up Merlin,” Arthur called as they walked through the woods. Merlin rolled his eyes as he walked faster. Merlin was glad that he told Arthur that he has magic. It took the young king a while to accept him but he finally did a few weeks later after he told him. “Merlin?” the young king called again. Merlin was still his servant of course but he got a lot more respect and time off now. Merlin rolled his eyes again as he looked at where his friend was pointing.  The warlock froze as he looked at the man that was lieing on the ground motionless through the trees. Merlin and Arthur quickly ran through the trees to where the man was.</p><p>“He’s alive,” Merlin said when they got to the man. Merlin then checked him over. Arthur looked at Merlin then at the man. He had light brown hair that made him look older then he already is for his hair had a little bit of gray. He wore weird clothes that look like they were not from this time, but that can't be true because time travel did not exist. He had a series of scars on his face. One of them started with his eyebrow and it ended on the bridge of his nose on the right side of his face. The next one was also on his right side on his cheek. He had another on the other side of his face in the same place.  </p><p>“Who is he?” Arthur asked quietly after a pause. Merlin shook his head.</p><p>“I don’t know, but he’s hurt. We need to get him back to Camelot,”  Merlin said simply. Arthur sighed and thought for a moment then he nodded.</p><p>When the king and the warlock got back to Camelot they quickly rushed the unknown man back to Gaius. “What happened?”  Gaius asked as he and Merlin got the medical supplies and medicine.</p><p>“We don’t know. We found him in the woods when we were hunting,” Merlin replied.</p><p>“I don’t think he’s from this time,”  Gaius said suddenly as he fixed the man up.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Merlin asked his mentor as Arthur left the room. However, Gaius did not say anything.</p><p>              It was about moon rise when Remus woke. His eyes slowly opened as he sniffed the air just like when he was in the woods. However, instead of mud and wood, he smelled medicine and old stone. He looked around the room. It looked like Hogwarts to him but smaller and older. It seems that he was in some kind of living corners built for two. “Where in the name of Merlin am I?” He asked out loud but he got no answer. Remus pulled out his wand and small cane that he had shrunk from the pocket of his shabby coat and unshrunk the cane and carefully he stood up. He winced in pain as he started to walk around the small room. What he saw was an old man asleep on a bed by the window. The werewolf nodded to himself as he made a note in his head to thank him later tomorrow. Remus saw a staircase. He then climbed it to see a door. The werewolf realized that he was being creepy but he needed to know who was else in this room with him. When he opened the door he saw a boy also sleeping. Remus smiled at the boy with black hair. It was the same shade as Harry, but darker then Sirius’s hair color. Remus slowly closed the door so he does not wake the boy. <em> Where am I?</em> he thought as he looked out the window to see trees and wood. However, when he saw the new moon he shivered with fear and sat down in a nearby chair.</p><p>              Merlin woke with a start after a nightmare. He slowed his breathing and closed his eyes, and sighed. Then he got out of bed and went out of the room and down the stairs. He was surprised to see the man from yesterday sitting in a chair reading one of his spell books with an intrigued look in his blue amber eyes. “Hello,” Merlin said to the man who put the book down in his lap to look at him and smiled</p><p>“Hello,” the man said back in a calm quiet voice, but Merlin heard fear and pain behind it.  Merlin could sense something about this man but he could not place it.</p><p>“Can I ask your name?” Merlin asked calmly but his voice shook for some reason. The man thought for a moment then he answered:</p><p>“Remus Lupin,” Remus said with a smile and a raised eyebrow. “Can I ask for yours and where I am?”  Remus added as he looked around the small room. Merlin looked at him confused and laughed a little.</p><p>“I’m Merlin and you're in Camelot,” Merlin said making Remus laugh.</p><p>“I can't be in Camelot. Can I? No, I went to bed yesterday morning along with my best friend after my, my condition took over,” Remus used air quotes. “I was in my house so how can I be here?” Remus ranted as his eyes turned more amber. Merlin took a few steps back from the werewolf who was breathing hard. A few seconds later and Remus calmed his breathing and calmed down. “I’m sorry, I’m, just not from this time,” Remus said as he looked around again then he looked back down at the book</p><p>“You're interested in magic?”  Merlin asked pointing at the spell book. This made Remus chuckle.</p><p>“You can say that,” Remus smiled but then something clicked in his mind. “Wait your name is Merlin? The Merlin. The greatest sourcer of all time?” Remus smiled. “Sir, my boy it is an honor,” Remus added making Merlin bush a deep red color.</p><p>“So, your magic?” Remus nodded as he stood up wincing in pain and weakness. At this point, Arthur walked into the room.</p><p>“Merlin?!” Merlin sighed as Arthur walked in. “Merlin, Oh your awake,” Arthur said as he looks at Remus up and down. He noticed that Remus was tall and thin, and he was putting what it looked like all of his weight on a wood walking stick.  “Who are you?” Arthur demanded. Remus nodded realizing that this is the king. Remus sighed and said:</p><p>“Remus John Lupin at your service,” Remus bowed a little but winced in his own weakness.</p><p>“Do you have magic too?” the young king asked as Remus nodded but did not say anything for he was too weak to speak.</p><p>“I think he does Arthur,” Merlin said speaking for the werewolf. Again Remus nodded as he closed his eyes with a sigh. The young king hummed and looked at Remus more closely.  </p><p>“Are you injured Mr.Lupin?” Arthur asked the werewolf who opened his eyes. The werewolf sighed and nodded weakly.</p><p>“Yes. Long story. I don’t want to scare you about my, my condition,” Remus cleared his throat and looked around. Arthur nodded and looked at Merlin.</p><p>“Why don’t you get some rest Mr. Lupin,” Remus nodded as he walked over to where he had woken up from.  “Come on Merlin we got work to do,” Merlin nodded and followed the king out.</p>
