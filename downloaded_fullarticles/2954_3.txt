    <p>Harry stumbled away from her. He felt like there was a great wave crashing down on him. "No," he said. "You <em>couldn't </em>have done what you're saying, Ginny! Tell me you didn't."</p><p>"Harry, listen—"</p><p>But whatever Ginny'd been about to say was lost. There was a great clap, and a fiery rush. A phoenix appeared in the center of the room. The veil whooshed backward at the force of it. And then Dumbledore was there, down at the center of the amphitheater, staring up at them. Harry felt another, great shock at his appearance.</p><p>"Good evening, Harry, Miss Weasley," he said pleasantly.</p><p>"What – you—"</p><p>Dumbledore was shaking out his robes. "Oh, my. My, my, my. Back where it happened, are you?"</p><p>Ginny grimaced.</p><p>But then Harry only had eyes for Dumbledore. "You!" he said loudly. "You were there in my vision… you stopped me going with my parents!"</p><p>"I believe that was Miss Weasley's aim," Dumbledore said amicably.</p><p>"You said – you told me that I had no idea how much I was loved," Harry accused. "You could have <em>told me</em>. I thought it was – just, you know, my friends… the Weasleys. You didn't tell me that <em>someone else </em>had to—"</p><p>Dumbledore shrugged eloquently. "I did not think it the appropriate time to reveal such a thing to you. I knew it would happen eventually."</p><p>"You knew—" Harry was too angry to even finish his sentence.</p><p>"Of course I didn't know when I was living, but there are few things obscured from the dead, as long as the dead know where to look," said Dumbledore. "There is a bit of a learning curve, but I think I have got the hang of it now. With Fawkes's help, of course."</p><p>Harry made a small sound of outrage. He jabbed a finger at Ginny. "She's <em>dead </em>because of me!"</p><p>"I'm not dead," Ginny said.</p><p>"She's not dead," Dumbledore said at exactly the same time.</p><p>Harry looked at her. Her shoulders were firm, her jaw was set. There was only determination on her face.</p><p>"Watch, Harry," said Dumbledore.</p><p>And then the room was suddenly full of Death Eaters and teenagers, all of them battling their hardest. Harry was dueling Bellatrix on the dais upon with the Veil stood. All of her spells were missing him, but then he – he tripped, whirled, and his arm went beyond the Veil. At the same instant, Sirius slashed Bellatrix in the back with a curse, and she fell in a heap.</p><p>Harry pulled his arm out of the Veil, looking down in panic at how it looked—</p><p>There was a great cry of a loon. It echoed through the room. Everything disappeared and turned to mist. He could hear Ginny crying… sobbing as though her heart were broken…</p><p>And then everything shifted again. It was the same battle, with a few key differences. Harry watched in horror as he saw it was now <em>Ginny </em>battling Bellatrix. She was graceful in the duel, she made it a dance. But she too tripped, and it was her entire body—</p><p>"NO!" shouted Harry.</p><p>And he watched his own stunned body jolt as though struck by lightning, was buffeted across the room, and just managed to close his fingers around Ginny's ankle before she disappeared entirely.</p><p>"I was separated from my body," said Ginny. "I was floating… drifting. Then – after you defeated Voldemort, I could <em>feel </em>you—"</p><p>"I do believe that once the Horcrux was gone from Harry, he was open to the connection you share," Dumbledore said. "It was bravely done, Miss Weasley."</p><p>"You aren't… angry?" Ginny said tentatively.</p><p>"Angry that my death brought about the continued life of Harry?" Dumbledore shook his head, laughing a little. "No. Oh my dear, no. Goodness, no."</p><p>"It wasn't purposeful," she said firmly. "I just wanted him to be offered the choice that was his right to make. You told me so, after all the funerals. You told me that he could've come back. And he would've, if only he'd <em>known</em>."</p><p>Harry swallowed hard. Ginny was brave, there was no denying that. But the last thing Harry'd ever wanted was for someone else to make a sacrifice for him, the way his mother had. <em>You have no idea how much you are loved</em>. And he could see it, in Ginny's face, in her posture, how much she loved him.</p><p>It hurt.</p><p>"How is this real?" Harry said faintly. He did not know whether he was asking this of Dumbledore or of Ginny.</p><p>"We're soulmates," Ginny said simply.</p><p>Harry closed his eyes; a muscle jerked in his jaw. "Yeah, I…"</p><p>"With a passionate connection," she added.</p><p>"That I know," said Harry. "I just want to know… those fantasies I've been having are real? Er – they <em>were </em>real?"</p><p>Ginny nodded.</p><p>"But how did this <em>happen</em>?" Harry turned to Dumbledore. "I didn't know she was calling for me. I just knew I would – would look for her in my dreams—"</p><p>"I think you ought to at least acknowledge that the dreams you are sharing with Miss Weasley are very nearly reality," Dumbledore said. "Your two souls are creating this place where you can meet—"</p><p>"And this is all we'll have," Harry said tonelessly. "The rest of my life. All I'll have are memories of a life that isn't really mind, not anymore, and dreams."</p><p>Harry sat on the edge of the amphitheater and put his head in his hands. Movement whispered, and he felt Dumbledore sit beside him. "Intent <em>matters</em> when a wizard acts," he whispered. "Sometimes you aren't told everything because if you know it, your intent changes. Remember that, Harry."</p><p>"We have a <em>passionate connection</em>, Harry," Ginny said again. She sounded very far away.</p><p>"Remember that," Dumbledore said again.</p><p>At those inexplicable words, the phoenix cried one piercing note, and Harry woke.</p><p>HPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHP</p><p>Harry's waking thought was that he was trapped somehow in a nightmare. Added to his pain at the knowledge that Ginny had taken a vile curse upon herself on his behalf was the sour stomach and sore head of too much firewhiskey. He conjured a basin just in time.</p><p>He did not leave his bed for hours. At one point, Sirius came. "All right, Harry?" Sirius asked.</p><p>"Go away," Harry said quietly.</p><p>His new knowledge battered at him. He thought endlessly of that — that fantasy he'd had the day before. <em>I guess it's not a fantasy, but a memory, </em>he thought resentfully. He'd gone to Voldemort, and fully died, leaving Voldemort to kill some of Ginny's family before Dumbledore could kill Voldemort for good. When the dust settled, she and Sirius, both tormented and alone, had hatched a plan between them to "set things right. And damn the consequences. He was so angry with her his heart hurt. He suspected it may even be broken.</p><p>It was another couple hours before Sirius came back. "Harry. Come out."</p><p><em>I'm just coming out because I was getting hungry anyway</em>, he told himself. He struggled out of bed, and did not bother to change. Harry smelled like a distillery.</p><p>Sirius, on the other hand, had obviously taken some time to clean up after last night's ill-advised amount of booze. Harry glared at him balefully. Sirius had been so adamant last night that the egg was not to be used. But with Ginny, he'd obviously been completely spineless! He'd thrown her into danger, laid the mantle of his family's curse over her shoulders. And he had no idea what he'd done.</p><p>"God damn it, Sirius," Harry muttered.</p><p>He threw himself into the same chair he'd been sitting in last night. "Where's Ron?"</p><p>"Went home after I set him up with a hang-over potion," Sirius said. He thrust a steaming mug into Harry's hand. Harry had the absurd urge to throw it at him. Then he took a sip, and his thoughts toward Sirius gentled.</p><p>The worst of the physical pain went away, leaving only the ache of Ginny's sacrifice.</p><p>"Ginny Weasley?" Sirius asked in a low voice. Grey eyes met Harry's startled ones.</p><p>"I, uh—"</p><p>"Don't try to deny it, last night, you were—"</p><p>"Drunk," Harry said shortly.</p><p>"Heart-broken," Sirius corrected. "I think even Ron noticed, bless him."</p><p>Harry wanted to tell him that however crushed he had been last night, it was nothing compared to how it had felt to discover who made the wish that dashed his hopes. "Yeah, well, I..."</p><p>"I didn't know you felt for her like that," Sirius said, watching him closely. "None of us knew. In fact, I thought about it a bit this morning, and I wonder if there's something you aren't telling me. About you. And Ginny. And why you're suddenly not someone who lost a friend, but a man who lost his love." Harry squirmed like a worm on a hook. "All those questions about Capella, and if I thought it was possible for people to be in love even though they aren't near each other."</p><p>Harry was quiet for a moment. "She called to me," he said. <em>We had — have a passionate connection, Harry</em>, she'd said.<em> We were already tethered before you used Badeea's spells, but I was drifting so far, and it always took you so long to find me. </em>She'd called to him using their connection. No wonder why Harry kept coming the second he found her. He envisioned a long string tying from her straight to his penis.</p><p>"She called to you," Sirius said.</p><p>"In my dreams," said Harry. "She isn't lost, not totally. She just can't find her way back to her body."</p><p>"Harry..."</p><p>"You're the one who said it," Harry said resentfully. "She's my soulmate. I'm supposed to be able to find her."</p><p>"I don't know if soulmates are real," Sirius said gently. "At least, not the way you are describing."</p><p>"I just got done having someone else's soul living in me," Harry pointed out. "I think I—"</p><p>"And I think that may be partly why you're feeling this way," Sirius said. He drummed his fingers on the arm of his chair, and shook his hair out of his eyes. "Harry, I wish your dad were here. This is one of those moments..."</p><p>"It's not one of those moments. Ginny's my soulmate, I know she is. There is no question," Harry said with great irritation.</p><p>"You don't sound very happy about that," Sirius pointed out.</p><p>For several reasons, Harry had to admit, chief of which was the fact she was living in a suitcase, unresponsive to the world. No wonder why Hermione'd always been so irritated with him for his "saving people thing". What was the point of saving his life if she couldn't be in it? There was no way he was going to be able to come back from this. Ginny'd basically died to save him. And now he was cursed to live an entire life without her.</p><p>That wasn't <em>saving </em>him.</p><p>And, Merlin help him, he knew exactly why she'd done it, and he knew if the situation was reversed, he'd do the same thing. He'd been ready to make Ron do it, and it hadn't been the drink. He'd been willing to do everything for her... and she'd done the same thing for him.</p><p>"Damn it, Ginny," he whispered.</p><p>"—I wish for both our sakes the old stories were true," Sirius said. "If only you could kiss Ginny, or I could kiss Capella, and everything would magically—"</p><p>"What did you say?" Harry said sharply.</p><p>"You know," Sirius said, surprised. "You know. The old stories, where you wake someone with a kiss. True love's kiss, or some such rot."</p><p>But Harry's brain, less sluggish now than it had been before he'd drunk Sirius's potion, began to churn through possibilities.</p><p>
  <em>Can people fall in love in a dream?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Oh, Harry. I'm hoping so.</em>
</p><p>What if she'd needed him to fall in love with her because that was the only way she'd be able to wake up?</p><p>And Dumbledore, telling him that intention mattered. That actions mattered.</p><p>Harry was already standing, already heading toward Ginny's suitcase. He was so far gone over her, he'd begun resenting the time he spent awake. Sirius's words — that being in love didn't necessarily mean being happy about it — rang true here.</p><p>It didn't even matter that his best hope was stolen out of the pages of a fairy tale. Hadn't Harry spent the last few weeks learning that the oldest stories had an element of truth to them? The Hallows, the loon...</p><p><em>Please work, </em>Harry thought.</p><p>He was standing in front of her. He pulled off his glove, murmured a spell that released Ginny from her constant revolution. She hovered there on her back. <em>Please be this simple</em>, Harry begged. He ran through every memory of her he had, from this life, and from the alternate reality from which Ginny had come. He thought of the radishes, and how beautiful she was, and how much he needed her. He thought of their passion for each other.</p><p>And then, after taking a deep breath, Harry moved so that his lips pressed against hers. There was no pressure. It felt like kissing cool mist.</p><p>He focused on the radishes, the love he'd felt in all those memories, the love that was growing impossibly so during his dreams. The pure passion she made him feel. He poured all of that into the kiss...</p><p>And her lips firmed under his. His heart pounded, and he feared opening his eyes. But she was kissing him back. Fiercely. Her tongue slipped into his mouth, and she was <em>kissing him back.</em></p><p>Her arms went around his neck. Her fingers went into his hair. Her body surged toward his.</p><p>She was real, and in his arms.</p><p>They broke apart.</p><p>Harry finally dared open his eyes. When he finally did, he found her there, standing before him. Her eyes were wide and brimming. He inspected her, head to toe, and found no trace of the ghostly aspect on her.</p><p>
  <em>She was real.</em>
