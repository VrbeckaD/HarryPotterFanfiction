          <div class="userstuff"><p>Dudley Dursley was not a really intelligent boy, and if he was a little less angry about that fact he would be the first to recognize it. The gist of the matter was that he was not a genius, but he could very well understand things, sometimes even the complicated ones, like the fact that he was left without his cousin while he was playing in the beach.</p><p>His cousin, the eternal constant in his home, gone.</p><p>He could say that he was sad, but that would be a big lie. True, he felt like his knees became jelly and his stomach made a good impression of being made of ice when he received the news, and he totally cried in a way he had thought was very girly afterwards, but he was not sure of the cause.</p><p>Dudley and his parents had reached their house that Sunday night and had been welcomed by police lights and ambulances, and all was very exciting (it was like they were some kind of national heroes being welcomed after winning a war) until they were told that Harry was in the ambulance (and here Dudley had thought that Harry had been crying <em>again</em>, and that this time some neighbor had heard him and made a fuss) and that Dudley’s parents were required to accompany some agent or other, and that Dudley was supposed to go talk with some lady, and everything after that was a rush of movement and sound that he couldn’t completely follow.</p><p>His mum had asked what Harry had done this time, that they could take care of it, and that nobody should worry about what a little liar like him said: ‘<em>he is in Saint Brutus, after all’</em>, and the police guy and the big bald detective that accompanied him had looked at her the same funny way his Math teacher looked at Dudley every time he said that he didn’t care about numbers because his parents had money.</p><p>They talked then in hushed tones, his parents looking paler with each passing second, and when a lady came towards him and took his shoulder, his mum started screaming that they couldn’t take him away, but she couldn’t move past the officers and he was soon left with the lady and the memory of his mother screeching and trying to kick the agents in their front yard and in the presence of their neighbors.</p><p>And now he was here. In Piers’ house, trying to come to terms with everything whilst Piers tried to overheard the lady (who was, according to his friend, from Children Services) talking with Mr. and Mrs. Polkiss.</p><p>Amanda, the lady, seemed very nice, and had sat beside him, told him everything in a very simple way and had even hugged him when he started crying.</p><p>He couldn’t tell her that he didn’t know why he was crying. That he didn’t feel anything towards Harry, and that his memories of him consisted mostly of him making fun of his abnormalities. He couldn’t even tell her that in reality he felt somewhat relieved that Harry had taken a way out of their lives, because he (Harry) would never again do <em>magic</em> against him or have one of his friends do it (he still shuddered every time he saw a fur coat), and Dudley would never <em>ever</em> fear the day Harry would be allowed to do his freakish things outside his freakish school.</p><p>He felt like he was free.</p><p>“Hey, Dud” whispered Piers, tiptoeing from the top of the stairs towards the room he was in “That lady says that your parents are going to jail!”</p><p>“What? Why?”</p><p>“She says is because they negle… they did something to your cousin”</p><p>“And me? What about me?!”</p><p>“Dunno” Piers shrugged and scratched his head “But that lady says that your dad said that your aunt told him to do things to your cousin and she’s also going to be investigated”</p><p>“Oh”</p><p>“So, you’re going to stay with us!”</p><p>“Fine”</p><p>“Is going to be fun! My parents gave me that new Nintendo console that you have, and we can bunk together and play until is late!”</p><p>“Fine Piers”</p><p>“Don’t be a bore, Dud” huffed Piers, irritated “You told me that you wished something like this happened”</p><p>“Shut up Piers”</p><p>And Piers effectively shut up, but also pursed his lips and marched stiffly outside the room.</p><p>Alone, finally, but in the guest room of one of his friends and in the aftermath of what Amanda had told him was a ‘very traumatic event’, Dudley thought that he preferred to deal with his fears than the uncertainty of his future.</p><p>It was all Harry’s fault.</p></div>
