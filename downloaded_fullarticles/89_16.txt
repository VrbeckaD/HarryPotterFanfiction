    <p>There is a big disadvantage in being the sister of a little girl like Lily, Petunia Evans broods silently as she watches herself in the mirror.</p>
<p>Their mother can say they’re both pretty and as beautiful as each other, Petunia isn’t convinced – and she’s neither blind nor deaf. The people’s comments on ‘what a pretty little girl you have’ Mrs Evans receives with a look or beaming pride aren’t addressed to Petunia, no. They’re for Lily and Lily alone. Lily, with her thick mane of red hair, her vivid green eyes, her charming smile, her fair skin, her large smiles. How can Petunia compare, really, with her thin blond hair, her dull blue eyes, her long neck, her awkward limbs, and her laughter that shows too long teeth?</p>
<p>Petunia doesn’t think of herself as ugly, but she isn’t… she isn’t pretty like Lily. The world ‘plain’ crosses briefly her mind before she rejects it vehemently. Petunia isn’t plain, she’s just… average.</p>
<p>She’s always average, no matter what.</p>
<p>And perhaps that’s what bothers her the most, because it seems so unfair for Lily to have everything and leave Petunia nothing for her to take pride in. In the fairytales and bedtimes stories their parents read them, there is always the ugly but smart sister and the fair but empty-headed sister, and Petunia wishes it was the case with her family. Who’d care if Lily had all the beauty, if Petunia could have all the brains?</p>
<p>Sadly, life isn’t a fairytale, and Lily has a brain as well under those red locks. She’s always bringing good grades as it is nothing, while Petunia feels like she has to struggle all the time to keep herself above average.</p>
<p>Unfair. So, so unfair.</p>
<p>But Petunia has to have something of her own, something to shine on her own and not just be stranded in Lily’s shadow. If she’s not the prettiest and not the smartest, then Petunia at least can be the most obedient and helpful of the two sisters. It’s not Lily who help their mother dress the table, it’s not Lily who help cleaning the house, it’s not Lily who proposes to do the laundry, it’s not Lily who pull weeds out of the lawn or carefully carry over a drink to their father as he works in their little garden under the hot summer sun.</p>
<p>It’s not Lily Mr and Mrs Evans smiles at and says ‘thank you, sweetheart’ with gratitude, and Petunia can look at Lily with a tiny bit of pride of her own, because see little sister, you’re not the one they thank. If anything, you should follow my lead and be a good girl too instead of a rule-breaking miscreant.</p>
<p>Because Lily is a rule-breaker, no matter how you look at it.</p>
<p>Mrs Evans always said ‘don’t do that outside the house’, reminded them, warned them, ordered them, forbad them, begged them and, in one memorable occasion, threatened them (though being sent to bed without dessert was hardly going to be a deterrent to Lily, ever, Petunia has to admit privately).</p>
<p>For all she loves her daughters dearly (especially Lily), Mrs Evans also worries about appearances, and it’s something Petunia is worrying about as well. For all she is (a little) jealous of Lily’s looks and smarts and would love nothing more than to see her sister being given a taste of her own medicine and become the average (plain) one for once, Petunia also doesn’t want people to say her sister is weird.</p>
<p>Or worse, to hear them say Petunia is just as weird, because what Lily can do, Petunia also can.</p>
<p>Sometimes, at least.</p>
<p>She can’t make the flowers dance in her palms like Lily do (now that’s a trick she’s like to be able to imitate, because if Lily can, surely Petunia can as well), but Petunia can jump high and fall slow, as if she was flying. She can change the color of her dresses and she can make her dolls move on their own, just like Lily.</p>
<p>Only, nobody knows, because Petunia isn’t a rule-breaker, unlike Lily. Mrs Evans has forbidden them to do ‘that’ outside the house, and so Petunia is a good girl and she obeys. She just wishes Lily would listen. But Lily, bless her bold streak, never listen.<br/>
Worse, their parents don’t even punish her when Petunia complains, and that’s a bitter pill to swallow because Lily is deliberately disobeying; she shouldn’t be praised for having done something against the rules! She is a bad girl!</p>
<p>No wonder the Snape boy seems to be attracted to her as if Lily was a magnet, she thinks snidely. He’s a bad boy, so it’s fitting he’d be after a bad girl.</p>
<p>Her mother would find Petunia uncharitable, and perhaps she’d be right; it’s hardly the Snape boy’s fault if his family lives in one of the (too many) poverty-stricken neighborhood of Cokeworth. It’s also not the boy’s fault if he has unpleasant parents – and Petunia is using one of the nicer euphemisms she knows of, because Tobias and Eileen Snape are infamous in this part of Cokeworth.</p>
<p>Then again, the Snapes are not the only distasteful residents of Spinner’s End – if anything, Petunia has heard Mr Evans call them somewhat tame in comparison to the Spudges or the Spinks. Why, the Spudges even got visits from the police, and the Spinks’ two older boys had been arrested for something having to do with weed, whatever that meant. No, Spinner’s End isn’t a good neighborhood and Petunia perfectly agrees with Mrs Evans when she strictly forbids her daughters to go anywhere near the place, especially alone.</p>
<p>Though honestly, she should have forbidden Lily to even try and pick a friendship with Spinner’s End urchins altogether.</p>
<p>But Mrs Evans hadn’t, and because the Snape boy has made an outrageous claim…</p>
<p>
  <i>(“You’re a witch!”)</i>
</p>
<p>It makes Petunia clenches her fists, because the nerves of that boy!</p>
<p>It’s not that she doesn’t believe him, because she does – the word ‘witch’ just explained so much about what Lily and Petunia could do, it’s funny how they had never thought about it themselves.</p>
<p>No, what bother her, what makes her furious… is the way that boy’s dark eyes had skipped her over, his gaze reserved to Lily alone, the one true witch he could identify, and dismissing Petunia as being nothing, as being a ‘Muggle’, someone… normal. Average. Plain.</p>
<p>And she isn’t! She isn’t! If Lily is a witch, and Petunia is one as well, because she can do the same things as her little sister (well, almost everything, but that got to count, doesn’t it?)</p>
<p>Not that she tells the Snape boy this (“His name is Severus, Petunia, you could call him by his name, you know.”), because what does that boy even know? He can’t even identify another witch when she’s right in front of him! For all he talks about magic with Lily (not with Petunia, who has to follow them and spy on them to hear most of it, because Lily doesn’t think about inviting her in to join the conversation either, too caught in her own giddiness at hearing there is a whole world of magic out of there, more children and adults like her, too busy begging for scraps of Severus Snape’s knowledge to remember that her sister, that Petunia would like to know as well), he doesn’t seem to know that much, Petunia thinks snidely.</p>
<p>But she’s going to show him, oh yes, she’s going to show them all. She’s no ‘Muggle’, that’s for sure, and she turned eleven last month, and she’s going to have a letter soon and go to that magic school she heard the Snape boy mention to Lily.</p>
<p>The Evans got two witches in the family, and Petunia is just waiting for a chance to prove it.</p>
