  <span>Dark Mousy had never thought he would get the chance after what had happened with the Dark Wings. By a sheer accident both he and Krad were called back but not by what they would expect. They were called back by the pain of an abused child. A child who had with one look had calmed Krad instantly. Dark had watched as Krad had practically melted to his knees in front of the abused child. “Little one.” A being talked to the child had jerked away only to cry out in pain. The child was so scared of everything and everyone. “We mean you no harm little one. We only wish to help and get you to safety. I am Krad and this is Dark. You called us here.”</span>

  <span>Dark moved to look around. He noticed a lot of things he didn’t like. They were in a shed and the child was tied up. He moved to touch the chain that was clamped around the child’s leg. The boy started crying and yanking the chain to hide in the corner away from them. Krad frowned at what he was seeing and the amount of blood they were seeing come from the child’s wounds. He nodded to Dark and Dark quickly used one of his feathers to unlock the chains. “There now. See, we are here to help.”</span>

  <span>The boy looked at them warily. After he realized they really weren’t going to hurt him he allowed them to carry him away. “I’m Harry.” The child whispered as Krad carried him. Both men smiled down at the boy. They had never though that someday they would have their own bodies and a child to take care of. Neither realized as they held the boy that the wards around the property had latched onto the two kaito. Items within a dark cupboard under the stairs disappeared too. “Thank you.” </span>

  <span>Across town at a police station one Vernon Dursley was admitting to ‘killing’ his nephew after ten years of abusing the boy. Across magical barriers a paper within a bank had glowed alerting the caretakers that something powerful was changing. In the shed that was left behind a ‘corpse’ had appeared. Inside a castle nestled deep in Scotland a book’s page had a name shift. As Krad and Dark left with Harry a new life began. </span>
