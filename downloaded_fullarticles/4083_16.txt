  <em>         1 August, 1965.</em>
</p><p>          Beneath a thin crescent moon on the coast of Fylde, all was still but for the gentle waves lapping against the shore and a breeze that whispered of rain.  Great clouds loomed over the sea, shrouding even the stubbornest of stars.  It might have been impossible to see clearly on such a night on another beach, but this beach happened to be home to a very popular amusement park.  Dazzling lights from the roller coasters and Ferris wheel blazed and stretched their way down the coastline for nearly two miles.  It was precisely here, where the lights from the park met the edge of darkness, that a short, porcine man by the name of Mr. Niles Smudgeworth stood waiting.</p><p>          It was cool for an August night, and Mr. Smudgeworth hugged himself.  Someone’s tattered, castoff old scarf lay in the sand beside him, but he was not tempted.  He was unconcerned, as well, with the chance of rain.  In fact, he felt very calm as he listened to the waves.</p><p><em>          Schlap.  Schlap,</em> they said.</p><p><em>          Ahh,</em> Smudgeworth thought, <em>such a delightful sound.  </em>He smiled to himself.</p><p>
  <em>          Schlap.  Schlap.</em>
</p><p>          Mr. Smudgeworth had been sent to deliver a confidential message to some very dear friends of his.  He had been waiting now for a few hours.  Not one person had passed by in all this time.</p><p><em>          Yes,</em> he thought, <em>they really chose the perfect spot.</em></p><p>
  <em>          Schlap.  Schlap.</em>
</p><p>          In time, two tiny silhouettes appeared in the distance from the direction of the park.  Mr. Smudgeworth watched their approach.  The two newcomers stopped and embraced.  He smiled again.  His friends’ happiness really was his own.  It brought such peace and joy to see couples in love.</p><p>          Before long, he could hear the sounds of conversation and laughter.  As they neared, he could make out the words.</p><p>          “I couldn’t take my eyes off the drummer <em>all night</em>,” came the voice of the female.  “It’s incredible what someone can do with just a couple of sticks!”</p><p>          “You know, I think he’s one of your kind,” a man replied.</p><p>          “One of ours?  What makes you say that?”</p><p>          “I think it’s obvious, really.  He’s great with sticks, for one.  Not to mention, no Muggles in their right minds would name their child ‘Ringo’.”</p><p>          “What?  I think it’s a perfectly ordinary name!”</p><p>          “You’ve hit the nail on the head, my dear.”</p><p>          None of this made any sense to Mr. Smudgeworth.  He had certainly never heard of anyone called Ringo.  As he watched, the couple began to embrace again and fell to the ground this time, still laughing.  He chose this moment to announce himself.</p><p>          “Ahem,” he said, stepping into the last fingers of light.</p><p>          “Oh!” and “Good heavens!” came the cries of alarm from his friends.</p><p>          “Terribly sorry for interrupting,” Mr. Smudgeworth said in a high, squeaky voice.</p><p>          “Oh!  Niles, it’s you!  How did you know we would be all the way out here at this hour?” said the female.</p><p>          He noticed the 13-inch piece of blond wood in her hand.  He raised his own hand, almost instinctively, in which he, too, held a long stick of wood.  “<em>Expelliarmus!</em>” he heard himself cry.  The piece of wood flew up out of her hand and landed in the sand several yards behind them.  They both stared at him, bewildered.  Then, after a mere second, he saw realization dawn on both of their faces.</p><p>          “Darling, get to the Portkey!” shouted the man, running and stumbling in his dash for the piece of blond wood.</p><p>          The woman saw the scarf at Mr. Smudgeworth’s feet.  His eyes locked on hers.  He raised his wand arm again.</p><p>          “<em>Avada Kedavra</em>!” he cried.</p><p>          A bright green flash filled the night sky, reflecting off the waves, and the woman fell to her side, dead.</p><p>          “<em>NO!</em>” the man screamed.  “Niles, what have you done?  What have you done!?  Think of Astrid!  She’s not yet three!”</p><p>          Mr. Smudgeworth pointed his wand at the man, who froze, as though making up his mind about something, and then charged Mr. Smudgeworth.</p><p>          “<em>Avada Kedavra</em>!” Smudgeworth screamed again.  Another flash of green, and now there were two dead bodies at his feet.</p><p>
  <em>          Schlap.  Schlap.</em>
</p><p>          All was quiet again, yet the waves were no longer calming to Mr. Smudgeworth, who was beginning to feel as though he had just awoken from a terrible dream.  He looked down at the bodies of his beloved friends, his vision slowly clearing.</p><p>          “Oh!” he squeaked.  “Oh dear, oh <em>dear</em>!”  He fell to his knees, his eyes filling with tears.  “What have I done!?  Oh, Merlin’s <em>beard</em>!”</p><p>          The waves continued to lap at the shore as Mr. Smudgeworth began to sob.</p>
