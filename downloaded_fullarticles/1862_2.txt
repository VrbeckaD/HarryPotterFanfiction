          <div class="userstuff"><p>Hermione walked down the steps into the Great Hall and placed her hand <span class="adverb"> neatly </span> into Krum’s. Her blue dress shimmered in the candle lit room in a way that made her look like Cinderella. <span class="hardreadability"> (The Grimm Brothers were famous wizard historians, who’s work somehow made it to the muggle world as fiction</span>.) Ron couldn’t help the glare he directed at his best friend and his idol. He didn’t <span class="adverb"> really </span> understand these feelings, why he felt so weird about the two of them together. What did it matter to him? Hermione was Hermione, his bushy-haired, bookworm best friend.</p><p> </p><p>Viktor Krum was a different story.</p><p> </p><p>He was Ron’s idol, a legendary Quidditch player and <span class="adverb"> genuinely</span>, if Hermione’s accounts were to go by, a lovely person. As they danced around the room with the other champions, Ron bubbled and boiled away in silence. His steadfast anger pointed at them, and then his date when she tried to engage in conversation. He felt bad for Padma, he <span class="adverb"> really </span> did. It wasn’t her fault he didn’t have the guts to ask who he wanted to go with. <span class="veryhardreadability"> She huffed and rolled her eyes, turning back to watch where her sister and Harry danced, Hermione and Viktor danced, Cedric and Cho, Davies and Delacour</span>.</p><p> </p>
<p></p><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p><span class="hardreadability"> Across the way, leaning against Draco in a bored stance and </span> <span class="adverb"> idly </span> <span class="hardreadability"> wishing she weren’t there, was Pansy Parkinson</span>. <span class="hardreadability"> She glanced around the room from her vantage point and spied her cousin talking to <em> Oliver Fucking Wood</em></span>. When did that happen? Oliver smiled <span class="adverb"> shyly</span>, cute dimples shining through and Marcus immediately looked stricken. <em> ‘Dumbass gay’ </em> she thought, smiling <span class="adverb"> softly </span> to herself.</p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“Alright, Pans’?” Draco muttered. She nodded <span class="adverb"> lightly </span> and continued surveying the room. Her eyes <span class="passivevoice"> were drawn </span> to the dancing champions, as they so <span class="adverb"> frequently </span> were. Granger looked beautiful in her dress. That was obvious to anyone with eyes. She was captivating in a way that only someone <span class="adverb"> truly </span> beautiful could be. She danced while whispering, laughing with abandon at her partner. It was so unfair. Pansy dragged her eyes away and they locked on the redhead. That friend of Hermione’s, the Weasley. Ronald. Letting go of Draco’s arm, she placated him into waiting for a few minutes and made her way over to the other. <span class="hardreadability"> Her footfalls were loud from the click-click of her kitten heel shoes, determination stained her face</span>.</p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“Weasley,” she said when she had reached him.</p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“Parkinson,” he replied, confused <span class="complexword"> as to </span> why she was speaking to him. </p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“I can’t figure you out.” There was a pause, Ron muddled over the sentence in his brain. He came up with nothing. He furrowed his eyebrows at her. The breath of air that fell from her lips couldn’t <span class="passivevoice"> be helped </span> as she rolled her eyes.</p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“You’ve got it bad, but I don’t know if you’re in to Granger or the champion. Krum.”</p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>His face coloured, the flush seeping from the edges of his ears and up over his cheeks. The sea of freckles covering his face <span class="passivevoice"> were masked by </span> the red.</p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“I- Uh-” he stuttered, trying to force out a response to no avail.</p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“It’s Granger, isn’t it. Of course it would be. She’s pretty, she’s smart. I’d bet she’s funny too, you’re into her aren’t you?”</p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“It, uhm, it sounds like you fancy her more than it sounds like I do,” Ron managed to say. Pansy was at a loss. Of course she had considered it but she didn’t think it would <span class="passivevoice"> be actualised</span>. <span class="veryhardreadability"> When she had figured out that she was a lesbian, she ran through a mental list of the girls in her grade and picked the ones with qualities she could feel attraction to</span>. Hermione was <span class="adverb"> fairly </span> high on the list. <span class="hardreadability"> Having a list of potential… crushes was all well and good but the likelihood of any of them being real was unfathomable to Pansy </span>. But here she was, a dunce redhead figured it out before she had.</p></div><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“Oh my fucking Merlin. I like <em>Hermione Granger</em>?” She exclaimed, more to herself than to Ron but he heard anyway.</p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“Glad you’ve admitted it, then.” </p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>She stared at the dancing because, mind you, her entire revelation of her world as she knew only took a few minutes. The dance was long, in the grand scheme of things her life <span class="passivevoice">being flipped</span> upside down was nothing. Miniscule. Infinitesimal. The world kept turning and she <span class="qualifier">just</span> <em>stopped. </em><span class="hardreadability">Hermione and Krum looked happy, whispering in each others ear like the rest of the cohort of Hogwarts weren’t even there</span>. </p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“So, we like the same girl?” And they were back to square one. Ron stuttered and stumbled but <span class="adverb"> eventually </span> he got his words out.</p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“I- Uh- No. <em> No. </em> Not her. She’s my <em>best friend. </em>Not her.” Oh. So Krum, then.</p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“I see it. If I liked guys, I could see myself finding Krum attractive. Bit too much like my cousin, though. Buff, Quidditch, the like.”</p><p>“You have a cousin?” Ron said, before realising <span class="qualifier"> just </span> how dumb that sentence was. She rolled her eyes but this time it bordered on fond. Both of them had their eyes locked on Granger and Krum as they spoke.</p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“Marcus Flint, currently chatting up your Quidditch captain. Hogwarts <span class="adverb"> really </span> is the school for gays, huh?” </p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“Oh, shit. Didn’t realise he was, you know, your cousin.”</p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“You know what, Weasley. You’re alright.” He smiled <span class="adverb"> unabashedly </span> at her and she couldn’t contain a smile back.</p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“Uh. Hi,” came the voice of one Draco Malfoy from behind them. <span class="hardreadability"> Ron looked around, saw Pansy addressing Draco and saw that Padma had wandered off to one of her Ravenclaw friends</span>. Ron bristled as Pansy turned to involve him in the conversation but she was having none of it. </p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“Look,” she started, voice leaving no room for argument, “I get that you have this animosity thing. The whole <em>'g</em><em>otta stay loyal to my xyz'  </em> but, <span class="adverb"> frankly</span>, this is school dance. You know what happens at school dances? People mingle, they talk to people they don’t <span class="adverb"> normally </span> and they do it with civility. <span class="veryhardreadability"> Ronald, you know full well that we wouldn’t have spoken under other circumstances, but if you think for one second that I’ll allow us to go back to the whole hating each other thing then honey, you’ve got a big storm coming</span>.”</p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>So, they mingled. It was awkward but they talked and watched. <span class="hardreadability"> The </span> <span class="adverb"> abnormally </span> <span class="hardreadability"> long dance finished, the champions and their dates dispersed into the crowd</span>. Harry and Parvati wandered over, looking awkward and uncomfortable with each other. Hermione and Krum didn’t have the same problem. Hermione dragged him over to the small group of six that had formed. (Parvati had gone off to see her sister.) </p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>The conversation <span class="passivevoice"> was stilted</span>, <span class="qualifier"> just </span> as awkward as when Draco first arrived and it was only Ron and Pansy. Pansy looked like she had no idea how to carry herself now that she had realised herself. Draco and Harry kept glancing at each other and <span class="adverb"> quickly </span> looking away. Ron couldn’t tell if it was in contempt or <em> something else.</em></p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“Hello, you are Ronald, yes?” Ron was, once again, turning bright red. He gulped <span class="adverb"> softly </span> and nodded.</p></div></div><div class="">
  <p>“I was <span class="qualifier"> just </span> speaking with Hermione,” he said, slowing down on Hermione’s name to sound it out <span class="adverb"> correctly</span>. “She said that she thought you may like to spend time with me. <span class="qualifier"> I was wondering </span> if you would like to <span class="complexword"> accompany </span> me to the Quidditch pitch tomorrow on a romantic outing?”</p>
</div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>He was forward then. Ron nodded again, smiling <span class="adverb"> blindingly </span> at the Bulgarian. <span class="veryhardreadability"> Pansy and Hermione were flirting </span> <span class="adverb"> softly </span> <span class="veryhardreadability"> , <em>‘</em> <em> The Arctic Monkeys were right, Granger, you do look good on the dancefloor. </em> <em>’</em> and Harry and Draco hadn’t killed each other yet, so all’s well that ends well </span>.</p><p align="center"><strong>-epilogue-</strong> </p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>The Yule Ball. What started as the makings of the worst experience of Ron’s life ended pretty alright. Pretty Alright. He got a boyfriend out of it, all his friends got relationships out of it. Viktor had to go back to Bulgaria, but they owled <span class="adverb"> frequently </span> and, well, they made it work. </p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>Ron wandered into the Great Hall, no longer decked out for the Ball, and meandered over to Hermione and Harry. Hermione and Pansy had gotten together in the weeks after the Yule. Draco and Harry were a bit surprising. <span class="hardreadability"> They had some kind of tension between them but then Harry told Ron, late in the night, that he didn’t </span> <span class="adverb"> really </span> <span class="hardreadability"> feel any romantic attraction.</span> Like, at all. Which was fine. <span class="veryhardreadability"> He did say that he and Draco had entered into a </span> <span class="adverb"> vastly </span> <span class="veryhardreadability"> platonic relationship where they were </span> <span class="adverb"> mutually </span> <span class="veryhardreadability"> exclusive and snogged a lot, but they weren’t dating</span>. Queerplatonic or something like that. That was also fine.</p></div></div><div class="">
  <p><span class="qualifier">Maybe </span> <span class="veryhardreadability"> the Yule Ball had a romantic atmosphere because the reveal of many romantic (and queerplatonic) relationships came around the time</span>.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><span class="veryhardreadability">There was Oliver Wood and Marcus Flint, which surprised </span> <span class="qualifier"> just </span> <span class="veryhardreadability"> about everyone except the respective Quidditch Teams they captained</span>. Then there was Luna and Ginny, who weren’t even at the Ball but <span class="qualifier"> maybe </span> it was some kind of magic. <span class="veryhardreadability"> Cedric, Cho and Roger Davies had formed a polyamorous relationship as had Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones and Neville Longbottom</span>.</p>

<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p><span class="hardreadability"> Hermione laughed </span> <span class="adverb"> lightly </span> <span class="hardreadability"> as Viktor twirled her around the room in a grandiose and playful fashion </span>. The music was loud and seemed to course through her veins. Her watching peers didn’t bother her. She felt good, she felt happy.</p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“So,” he said, “We are both of the same-sex inclined, yes? Would you tell me of that ginger haired, freckled friend of yours?”</p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>She smiled back in reckless abandon and launched into a tale of bisexual messes and ‘<span class="qualifier">just </span> ask him out, he’ll say yes’s.</p></div></div><div class=""><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"><p>“Okay, then. I will ask him after this dance. What about you, any girls you have your eyes on?”</p><p>His laughed sounded through the Hall when she flushed from neck to forehead.</p></div></div><div class="">
  <p>“Only the one, she’s talking to Ron right now.”</p>
