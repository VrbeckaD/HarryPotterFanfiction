    <p align="center"><u> <strong> <span class="s-bl">Meet Naerys Avery:</span> </strong> </u><br/>
<br/>
<span class="s-rg">Naerys</span> Avery was born on the 13th of June 1973 in Dorset, England.<br/>
She is the daughter of <span class="s-rg">Ailean</span> Avery and Astrid Nott.<br/>
She is a <span class="s-rg">pureblood</span>.<br/>
She is a Slytherin.<br/>
<br/>
Her paternal grandfather was suspected to be Death Eater but never faced trial because he was diagnosed senile and claimed that all he did was under the Imperium Act. The charge being too weak, he was sent to Saint Mungo until his death, when <span class="s-rg">Naerys</span> was only 4 years old. Her grandmother died during childbirth and his grandfather never remarried.<br/>
<br/>
Her mother wanted them to learn about the Muggle World and secretly took Jacob and her to visit the Muggle part of the United Kingdom. Her father despised the idea but never openly voiced hatred for muggles. <span class="s-rg">Naerys</span> and Jacob were always told that he reacted this way because he was afraid that his children could be accidentally exposed to a muggle and get hurt.<br/>
<br/>
Her mother is a very nice and caring one. She is very close to both her children and suffers a lot from Jacob’s disappearance. She is a tall and carries herself with a lot of confidence. Her hair is black and her eyes are of a warm brown colour with a gold light. She always stayed at home and raised her children by herself, even though she sometimes helps her husband for administrative works.<br/>
<br/>
Her father is a very busy man, he occupies a high rank in the International Confederation of Wizard. He nwas never really around. <span class="s-rg">Naerys</span> always respected him a great deal because he seemed to be working twice as hard to make the Wizard World forget about his father’s actions and wash the Avery name. He is very close to the <span class="s-rg">Malfoy</span> Family, and <span class="s-rg">Naerys</span> sometimes babysit their only son Draco and her cousin Theo Nott.</p>
<p align="center"><br/>
He father is strict and not very demonstraruve. <span class="s-rg">Jacob</span><span class="s-rg"> and her</span> always had to work a lot to earn a praise, and <span class="s-rg">Naerys</span> has the feeling that this played a huge role in Jacob’s obsession for the vaults. She always thought that he wanted to make their Dad proud. </p>
<p align="center">Her dad forbids Astrid and <span class="s-rg">Naerys</span> to talk about Jacob at home.<br/>
<br/>
Physically, <span class="s-rg">Naerys</span> pretty much took after her Irish father. She has long wavy brown hair with natural red highlights. Her eyes are blue-green, and she has a very soft face, long eyelashes and strong cheekbones. Her lips are plump, and she has small dimples whenever she smiles. She isn’t very tall but has a <span class="u-bl">curvy</span> figure.</p><hr/>

  <u> <strong> Relationships: </strong> </u>
</p>
<p align="center">She has a very strong friendship with those she called jokingly her “gang.” It consisted of Tulip, Rowan, Penny, Tonks, Charlie, Ben, <span class="s-rg">Barnaby</span> and Bill who left Hogwarts already but continued to write to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="s-rg">Barnaby</span> and Charlie became best friends during Year 4 and only became overly competitive when it came to Quidditch. Charlie never joined Gryffindor’s team but <span class="s-rg">Barnaby</span> joined as a Beater. In year 6 he became Team Captain after their previous one left Hogwarts. They are both very close to Ben that they took under their wing and it made him gain a lot of confidence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="s-rg">Naerys</span> actually is closest to Tulip because she loves her dry sense of humour and her sarcastic side.<br/>
<br/>
Tulip openly loves to jab Ben because of his awkwardness and <span class="s-rg">he</span> fights back each one of them because he isn’t afraid to voice his opinion when it comes to his friends.<br/>
<br/>
Rowan’s crush on Bill never faded but she never acted on it. Bill actually knew she liked him but didn’t reciprocate the feeling. He never voiced it to her because since she never acted on it he didn’t want to ruin their friendship by breaking her heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="s-rg">Barnaby</span> became quite popular among the other students and actually got poisoned with a Love Filter during Year 5 when a Ravenclaw girl offered him a drink after a training session. He got so mad that he never ever accepted any gift again. Tonks punished the girl by hexing her and she smelled like fish for a week. She exclaimed: “<span class="s-ja">Hey</span>, I smell something fishy with this girl” every time they came across which made every one laugh.<br/>
<br/>
The <span class="s-rg">Bowtruckle</span> that Professor <span class="s-rg">Kettkleburn</span> offered to <span class="s-rg">Naerys</span> was named <span class="s-rg">Barnaby</span> Jr. and the gang calls him Junior. <span class="s-rg">Barnaby</span> was so deeply touched by the attention that he nearly crushed <span class="s-rg">Naerys</span> with his bear hug.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="s-rg">Junior</span> once bit Tulip’s finger when she tried to scare <span class="s-rg">Barnaby</span> in the library by putting her finger in his ear.She screamed so loudly that she lost her house 20 points.</p>
