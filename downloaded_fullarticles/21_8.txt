    <p>"MUM! MUM, GET DOWN HERE!" </p><p>Jackie Dursley groaned and slammed her pillow over her head as her brother, Dudley's voice thundered throughout the house, jolting her out of a dream in which she'd been flying on the back of a dragon. On the other side of the room, her cousin, Harry Potter, lifted his head sleepily, an annoyed look on his face. Today was June 23, which meant it was Dudley's thirteenth birthday. It didn't take much to figure out what he was screaming about. He had counted his presents and found a lower amount than the previous year, which meant the entire household was about to be subjected to one of his tantrums. </p><p><em>Yep, there goes the table, </em>Jackie thought wryly as a loud crash sounded throughout the house, shaking the walls. <em>Well, if that didn't wake up the entire neighborhood, nothing will. Then again, nobody ever seems to notice the earthquake that undoubtedly occurs every time Dudley tries to walk somewhere, so who knows? </em></p><p>"Well, here we go again," Harry remarked, looking extremely irritated. "Guess it's about time for us to start cooking breakfast." </p><p>"Yeah," Jackie muttered. "I wonder if Mum would notice if we cut his portions. God knows he could use it; I'm amazed he can even get up anymore." </p><p>"Believe me, Jackie, you're not alone in that." </p><p>When the two cousins arrived downstairs, just as Jackie had expected, they found the dining table upended and about forty unopened presents scattered about the floor. Petunia was trying to console Dudley, who was wailing in a way reminiscent of a five-year-old that had been denied ice cream. Deciding it would be in their best interest to ignore him, Jackie and Harry walked into the kitchen without a word and began preparing to cook breakfast. Harry placed a pan on the stove and turned it on while Jackie rummaged through the refrigerator for the eggs and bacon. </p><p>Unfortunately, as often happened to be the case, ignoring a Dudley tantrum was far easier said than done. </p><p>"I only got forty presents! You said I would get forty-one this year, Mum! You promised!" he yelled, his piglike face going an impressive shade of red. </p><p>"Oh no! What a tragedy!" Jackie sneered under her breath. </p><p>"I wonder how long it took him to count to forty," Harry stage-whispered over the sizzling of the bacon. </p><p>Jackie snorted with amusement. "Knowing him, there's probably more than forty presents but he thinks there are fewer because he forgot his numbers." </p><p>She loved her brother, she really did, but there were only so many years that she could endure his birthday tantrums before she lost any ability to feel sympathy for him. Dudley had gotten everything he wanted for as long as she could remember, while she was forced to go every year without so much as a cake from their parents. Harry was the only one that had ever given her a gift, although until he started attending Hogwarts, he hadn't been able to buy her anything as he wanted. She had tried to tell him that there was no need to spend money on her, but that hadn't stopped him from buying her boxes of sweets every year on her birthday as soon as he was able. </p><p>"It's okay, popkin," Petunia soothed, and although she wasn't looking, Jackie could imagine her running her hand through Dudley's hair. "When we go out today, we'll buy you another present. How does that sound?" </p><p>As Harry was taking the scrambled eggs and bacon off of the pan, a knock at the door caught Jackie's attention. At first, she assumed it was one of her brother's friends-Dudley evidently thought so as well, for he stopped crying immediately-but a yelp from her father as he opened the door quickly let her know this wasn't the case. Her curiosity getting the best of her, Jackie ran into the hallway to see who could have caused Vernon to react the way he had. When she got there, she found herself face-to-face with a tall woman dressed in black robes. Her hair was pulled into a tight bun and her eyes surveyed the Dursley house sharply, almost like a cat. </p><p>"H-hello," Jackie stammered. "Is-is there something we can do for you?" </p><p>To her surprise, the woman smiled kindly. "My name is Professor McGonagall, deputy headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry," she replied. "And I am here to speak to you, Miss Dursley." </p>
