    <p>Harry was really not sure what was happening. One thing was certain, he didn’t like one bit of it.</p><p>It had all happened so fast. There had been screeching. A phoenix had been writhing in pain. Five pairs of hands had rushed forward in confusion to hold the bird down, trying to help the screaming creature. And then before Harry could blink the floor vanished under his feet and he was thrown hurtling into madness.</p><p>The world spun around him in a storm of golden flames. There was no up, no down, no sense of where he was. Harry scrambled as he fell, trying to find something, anything to hold on to, buffeted by the winds whipped up from the vortex around him. Familiar shadows flew in and out of the flames, whipping past before he could identify them. Somewhere, carried by the wind, he could hear screams and yells. He was screaming too, for Ron and Hermione. They had been with him, but now he couldn’t see them anywhere.</p><p>He kept falling, spinning faster and faster until the flames blurred into one long wall of light and he could see no more.</p><p>It was a while before Harry registered that he had stopped moving. He lay still, wherever he was, keeping his eyes tightly shut. Listening for the roar of the flames, he heard only his heart beating in his chest. The world had gone quiet.</p><p>Harry slowly opened his eyes. The flames were finally gone. It was dark, too dark to really see where he was, but he could make out a slanted ceiling above him.</p><p>He remembered that he’d been in the hospital wing with Ron and Hermione. Ron’s leg was still broken, and Ginny and Neville had joined them. And then… something had gone wrong with Fawkes. But as he fumbled to understand what exactly had happened Harry felt the memories float beyond his reach, like a dream slipping quietly away.</p><p>A wave of drowsiness washed over him and in that moment Harry couldn’t bring himself to care. His head was so heavy, as though it had been filled to the brim with water. His eyes drifted shut. He was so tired, he wanted so so badly to sleep…</p><p>A harsh rap on the door jolted him awake.</p><p>“UP!”</p><p>---</p><p>It was snowing outside. Ron blinked at the window in confusion. Why was it snowing?</p><p>His first thought when he’d woken up in his own bed was that he’d been sent home. Except that made no sense. Madam Pomfrey could heal broken legs easily, and there were still a few weeks of lessons left. Plus he couldn’t feel any pain in his leg. Ron sat up in his bed and made to stand up, testing the weight of his leg. It seemed fine. Ron rolled up his pyjamas to examine it. Expecting to see a mess where the giant dog had bitten him he was surprised to find his skin smooth and unmarked.</p><p>So… He was home. His leg was fine. And it was snowing. In June. And was it just him or did everything in his room seem… bigger?</p><p>The smell of bacon and eggs cooking downstairs wafted through the door. His stomach growled at the scent but he ignored it, his mind was buzzing too loudly with questions. He could hear the usual cacophony of shouting and protesting coming from the kitchen. Ron hesitantly made his way to the door and peered his head out into the landing. It sounded as though Fred and George had broken something downstairs, and now Mum was in the middle of a lecture.</p><p>Ron hovered for a moment, figuring it might be best to wait until Mum had finished before he interrupted to ask why he was home and, most importantly, <em>why was it snowing in June</em>, when he heard a distressed gasp from Ginny’s room.</p><p>“Ginny?” he asked uncertainly. He stumbled to her door, sending the home-made ‘Ginny’s Room’ sign clattering as he shoved the door open to see Ginny standing wide-eyed in the middle of her room. Ron gaped at her for a moment, taken aback by how tiny she was. Then he saw the tears streaming down her face.</p><p>“Ron, I- I think I lost time again” her voice trembled. The terror raised in her voice and Ginny burst into sobs. “The last time like this was with Riddle, but I don’t know how- I thought it was over-”</p><p>Ron hurried over and quickly drew his sister into a hug. He could feel her shaking violently in his arms, so he held her closer. Questions of how and why could wait for now.</p><p>---</p><p>It was important, Hermione thought, that she remain calm. Try to figure out what exactly had happened, and then she can think about her next best move. Panicking was not going to help in this situation.</p><p>Except the situation was that she was looking in the mirror and seeing her younger self staring back at her. Hermione gaped in astonishment at how much rounder her face looked, how tiny her mouth was, making her front teeth look all the more too big. The last time she’d looked in this mirror she could see most of her torso. Now her shoulders only just about came into view.</p><p>In the corner of the room, folded neatly in the armchair by her bookcase, was a green dress and a soft white cardigan. Hermione slowly reached out to touch the cardigan, rubbing the soft fabric between the fingers. Both it and the dress looked brand new. She remembered getting these clothes. They had been a Christmas gift from her granny years ago. If her memory was correct then that meant she was in her 9-year old body.</p><p>It was impossible. Absolutely impossible. She must be in some sort of dream. Time Turners could turn back the clock but they did <em>not</em> make you younger. And they were never, <em>never</em> used to go this far back.</p><p>Hermione tried to piece together what had happened.  She and Harry had gone to visit Ron in the hospital wing. They’d been talking about Sirius and Buckbeak, wondering how far they had managed to get away, when Ginny and Neville turned up and they quickly changed the conversation. And then…</p><p><em>The phoenix</em>. Hermione’s hand flew to her neck, to where the Time Turner should be. It was gone. It was more than gone, she realised in horror. The chain had been cut by Fawkes’ talons as she tried to help calm the screeching bird. The tiny, fragile hourglass had shattered to pieces on the floor just as the phoenix burst into flame.</p><p><em>Don’t panic</em>, she told herself again. <em>Don’t panic, don’t panic, don’t panic</em>. But Hermione was panicking. Because something had just gone terribly, horribly wrong.</p>
