    <p>     “What- why?” The dark haired boy’s brow furrowed.</p><p>     “Because Father has threatened to disinherit me, and he’s transferring me to Ecole de Réforme pour Garçons, in the Alps this coming school year.” Draco stared at his bare feet, unable to meet Harry’s gaze. He didn’t want to see the hurt there.</p><p>     “He’s sending you to France- because of this- us? Seriously?” There was the anger Draco had been waiting to hear.</p><p>     Draco sighed. “Switzerland, technically. But yes. I told you he’d be beyond angry if he ever found out, didn’t I? It’s my fault anyway for getting us caught.”</p><p>     Harry tilted Draco’s face up and caught his eyes. “It’s not your fault. None of it. Understand? It’s not your fault your dad is a bigoted piece of shit who’s more concerned about the continuation of the family name,” Harry rolled his eyes, “than the happiness of his only child. And I still don’t understand why this means we have to break up. We can still write letters, right? Or talk on the phone?”</p><p>     Draco sighed again. “No. They screen all the letters in and out. If my father finds out we’re still in contact, he <em> will </em> disinherit me. He’s made that very clear. He’d rather have no heir than have one who’s a poof.” Draco couldn’t keep the bitterness from his voice. “Besides. Why would you want to continue such a long distance relationship with someone you won’t be able to see? You’d have better prospects here. We both know there’s plenty of people at school who would love to be with you; people who can do so publicly.”</p><p>     “Yes. but I don’t <em> want </em> any of them, Draco. I want you.” Harry was staring so intensely that Draco had to look away.</p><p>     “Harry, please. I don’t want to do this any more than you want me to. But I don’t have a choice. Please,” his voice broke, and it took all his willpower to keep his tears away,” don’t make this harder than it already is.”</p><p>     “Alright,” Harry said quietly. “I won’t fight you on this any more. But, know this: I love you, and if ever you need me, you just have to contact me. I don’t care if it’s been ten years since we last spoke.” With that, Harry pulled him into a tight embrace. Draco hugged him back, his control finally broke and he found himself sobbing into Harry’s shoulder. When they finally broke apart, the still-visible tears in Harry’s eyes nearly set him off again, but he took a deep, shuddering breath and stepped back. Then, before he could talk himself out of it, he turned and walked away, keeping his eyes forward, knowing that if he turned around, he wouldn’t have the willpower to leave.</p>
