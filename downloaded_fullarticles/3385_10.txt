    <p>“You should have seen Snivillus’ face when…” James’ voice which was just seconds before filled with laughter suddenly took a more serious tone. “I mean… Pads have you done your Astronomy homework yet?”</p>
<p>Sirius didn’t even have to look up- he knew the reason for his best friend’s sudden change of subject- but he looked up anyway. Sure enough there was Lily Evans entering the Gryffindor Common Room. He rolled his eyes. They weren’t dating yet, but James had finally woken up and realized that he was going to have to act a bit more mature to attract the object of his affection. </p>
<p>James was now looking longingly over at Lily and it was enough to make Sirius want to barf. </p>
<p>“Oi, Moony why don’t you ever look at me the way this git looks at Lily?” He tilted his head to indicate that their friend had that lovestruck look about him again. James snapped out of his trance just in time to punch Sirius hard in the arm.</p>
<p>“Well…” Remus began. “It could be that you aren’t a glass of butterbeer. I reserve my madly in love glances for butterbeer.” </p>
<p>“Well that’s grossly unfair. I have been told I taste much better than butterbeer,” Sirius teased wiggling his eyebrows.</p>
<p>At this point James had enough of the teasing. “Oh sod off Padfoot. No one’s told you that before.” </p>
<p>Prongs did have a point. Despite all the girls who tried getting Sirius’ attention- few could resist his bad boy good looks and luscious black locks- the boy wasn’t interested in any of them.  His friends didn’t ask why because it really didn’t matter to them.</p>
<p>“Anyway to answer your previous question I did finish my homework and now I am very bored. What are we doing today?” Sirius looked around at his best friends expectantly. </p>
<p>“I’ve got a date,” squeaked Peter. This surprised everyone, but they tried not to let it show. </p>
<p>“Good for you Wormy,” James cheered, patting him on the back. “I do too actually.”</p>
<p>“Fuck you both,” Sirius grumbled. “Remus please tell me you don’t have one too.”</p>
<p>“I don’t actually. So I guess you’re stuck with me. What do you want to do, Pads?” </p>
<p>“I definitely don’t want to be at Hogsmeade with those two over there. We’ll just stay here,” Sirius replied decisively. </p>
<p>Remus gave a shy smile and looked down again at the book he was holding. </p>
<p>While James and Peter described the finer points of wooing their new lady friends, Sirius took awhile to study Moony. Ever since he’d first met him Padfoot felt differently about the other boy than he’d felt about anyone else. He didn’t know what it was at first, but as he got older he started to realize what he felt for Remus was what he was supposed to be feeling for girls his age. There were times when Sirius wanted to protect his friend and other times when he wanted to snog him senseless. One was a normal reaction the other… not so much. </p>
<p>Remus’ soft voice interrupted his thoughts. “Padfoot. You’re looking at me funny.” </p>
<p>“Oh was I?” he mused, trying to sound casual. “I was just thinking how particularly nerdy you look today in that jumper.”</p>
<p>“I wear this jumper all the time…” </p>
<p>“Yes, but today it makes you look like a complete dork. I mean that with love of course.” Sirius was a bit shocked at his word choice, but he hoped Remus wouldn’t pick up on it.</p>
<p>Before Moony could retort both Peter and James got up from the couch they were lounging on. </p>
<p>“See you losers later,” James said with a wink. He immediately walked over to Lily with Peter scurrying behind, presumably to meet with his own date. </p>
<p>Sirius paid them no more attention, however. He immediately grabbed Remus and pulled him onto a chair large enough for the both of them to sit in. They were close- possibly uncomfortably so for Remus, but it was hard for him to tell with his face buried in the other’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Moony?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Pads?”</p>
<p>“I really like you.”</p>
<p>“Well I would hope so. After all I consider you one of my best friends.” </p>
<p>“Mhmm,” Sirius hummed. He did not want to ruin the moment by telling his friend how badly he wanted to shag him right now. </p>
<p>“If we’re going to cuddle why don’t we go upstairs and get in my bed? More comfortable up there.” </p>
<p>Sirius, who had all of the sudden become quite sleepy, simply nodded. It delighted him that the other wanted to cuddle. Not that they hadn’t done so before, but it was usually done out of necessity thanks to bad dreams. </p>
<p>Remus was smiling, he could see that much through his tired eyes. The other boy got up first and lifted Sirius up. They made their way up the stairs to the boy’s dormitories. </p>
<p>“Why aren’t we cuddling in my bed?” Sirius muttered. </p>
<p>“Because your bed is gross. Come on now.” </p>
<p>The next thing Sirius knew he was opening his eyes. “Fuck! Did I fall asleep?” he asked. </p>
<p>“Yeah you were out for awhile,” Remus smirked. “You looked so peaceful I didn’t want to wake you.”</p>
<p>“B-but..” Sirius stammered. “I wanted to cuddle and talk and…”</p>
<p>“I’m not going anywhere Padfoot. We can still do all those things.”</p>
<p>Maybe it was because he was still half asleep, but Sirius found himself saying, “I want to do more things.”</p>
<p>“Oh really?” Remus’ tone was light. He cocked an eyebrow and replied, “What other things would you like to do?”</p>
<p>“I want to kiss you.” </p>
<p>“Then why don’t you?”</p>
<p>Sirius’ automatic reply was, “Too tired.” That was before he realized what was going on. “Wait… you want me to?”</p>
<p>Remus rolled his eyes and pressed his lips to his friend’s as a reply. That really woke Sirius up. </p>
<p>“Moony. I believe you just kissed me,” he said after they broke apart. </p>
<p>“And to believe I’ve called you one of the cleverest guys in school before…” </p>
<p>“Oh just shut up and do it again will you?”</p>
<p>After their lips pressed together for a second time Sirius couldn’t help but wonder what this meant for the two of them. But the future didn’t matter right now. Right now they were together and that’s all that mattered.</p>
