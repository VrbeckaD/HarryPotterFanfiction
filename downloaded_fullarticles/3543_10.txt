    <p>
  <span>     “I don’t see why we can’t kill him right after loser potter kill’s the Dark Lord.” A muffled voice says quietly in one of the train compartments of the Hogwarts Express.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “You know that we need him to marry Ginny and then once Gin pops out a child or get’s pregnant then we can kill him, it’s all a part of Dumbledore’s plan.” A female voice rings out.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “But he clings to us so much, and now since the mutt is dead we only have to really deal with the Wolf trying to care for him, we keep the twins busy enough that they don’t notice anything.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “And your brothers are useless Ron. I don’t know how you and Gin are related to them.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “I don’t know, so after Ginny and Potter marry we can finally kill him for his money, I wish seventh year would hurry up, that’s when Ginny can marry that idiot, the sooner we kill him off the better, he is so needy and whiney. And having to pretend to be poor around him sucks, I mean I have the money from his vaults, as do mom and Ginny, and you, but we can’t use it in case he finds out! I can’t wait till he’s out of the picture.” Ron sighs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “It will be over soon enough, Gin is dousing him with love potion number nine, and the Headmaster has him on multiple loyalty potions, and to keep him docile and not powerful, though I doubt that idiot has any, the Headmaster bound most of his core.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “I hope the headmaster can get rid of the wolf, and the clutz, Honestly why he keeps them around I have no clue.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “The headmaster said he was going to send them on more dangerous missions over the summer, hopefully we can get rid of them this year.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “We need to kill them before Potter or they might get suspicious, possibly Kingsley to, he would investigate Potter's death.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     The figure that was underneath the invisibility cloak moved swiftly past the compartment not wanting to listen in anymore, he fell into an empty compartment in the Slytherin area and took off his cloak. Harry Potter rubbed his face tiredly, not wanting to believe what he overheard. The raven haired teen has had a suspicion about his friends that last year or so after Ron blew him off during the tournament issue, and Hermione kept trying to get him to forgive that redheaded menace, he did to keep everyone happy, but he was still pissed, that was when he started to befriend other’s back in fourth year, he even had friends in the other schools. “God this is so fucked up. I mean I’ve known they’ve been lying to me for the past two years, but really stealing my money as well.” Harry shakes his head. “And now that Siri is gone, I bet that the Order is going to tell my Uncle about it and so I will start being treated like a slave again. FUCK!” A few seconds later there’s a knock on the compartment door and it slides open.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “What do you mean about being treated like a slave again Potter?” The Blond Slytherin Prince himself barges into the compartment followed by Theo Nott, and Blaise Zabini.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Well my only chance at staying safe in my relatives home is gone since Siri died at the Ministry, that means I might turn back into what I was before I came to this school, a docile little submissive, beaten down slave.” Harry spits out. “And on top of it I found out that Dumbledick has been stealing from my vaults, and so has the Two youngest Weasleys, Granger, and Molly Weasley at least, there’s apparently a plan to get me to marry Ginny so when I kill off the Dark Lord, they can kill me off and they will get all my money, I also just figured out I have more than just my trust vault.” Harry sighs and rubs his face again. The other three teen’s in the compartment stare at his in shock.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Well that is a lot to take in Potter, what are you going to do now that you know the light isn’t good.” Zabini asks.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Well I know I know nothing about the Dark side’s actual plans, I was only ever told that they killed my parents, murdered and tortured hundreds of people, and that I have to kill their leader for good, I am a child still a teenager, I don’t know as many spells as the Dark Lord, and he’s a genius! How am I going to kill him! I don’t want to! I never wanted to fight! So I want to know about the Dark Side’s ideas, and if I find I like them I will ask the Dark Lord to one not kill me, and that if I find I agree with almost all of his ideas, I would work with him to bring down Dumbledore.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     Draco and Theo are openly gaping at the raven haired teen, while Blaise is snickering behind his hand. “Oh I like you Potter, How are you going to contact him?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Hedwig can get through any wards, or I could just write a letter now, and give it to Draco to give to Lord Malfoy so he can give it to the Dark Lord.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “I would do it, but Potter what about Longbottom and Lovegood, I know you are friends with them.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Luna already know’s most likely, and she will inform Nevile for me, Luna always knows.” Harry waves it off. “But can you please call me Harry.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “As long as you call us by our names.” Theo tells him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Fine Theo, Draco, Blaise.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Harry.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     For the next hour or so they sat and talked about various things, the three teens found out that Harry was abused for his entire life after going to the muggles. And Draco was furious that He was never told he was and Heir to the Most Ancient and Most Noble house of Potter, and Black. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “You really need to go to Gringotts and have a lineage test done, it will show you what houses you are in line for, I am in Line for Malfoy, and Rosier, I was in line for Black, but you are the new Lord I believe.” Draco tells him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “I can’t get to Gringotts until I get out of my relatives house, and then I am usually with the Weasleys, and I know they won’t let me go alone. Unless one of you can break me out of the Dursleys house and then get me to the bank I have no way of doing it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “I’m assuming that Dumbledore blocked out anyone who has the Dark Mark, but he didn’t ward it from anyone who is neutral.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Blaise that is brilliant!” Theo exclaims.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Wait what are you talking about?” Harry asks.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “My mother is technically neutral, she didn’t want to get marked, and is a Grey witch, so the Dark Lord left her alone, my mother can pick you up and bring you back to Zabini manner.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Blaise I could kiss you right now. That is brilliant! Within two weeks your mother needs to come and get me, I will either be in a room on the second floor with a lot of locks, the cupboard under the stairs, or in the basement. The address is number 4 Privet drive little whinging surrey.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Okay Harry, and you could kiss me I wouldn’t complain.” Blaise winks at Harry, the teen in turns blushes a bright red.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Oh look at that Harry are you blushing.” Draco teases him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Shut up Draco.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     Blaise motions for Theo to switch sides and then Blaise slides close to Harry. “That blush is lovely on you darling, I wonder if I can keep it on you for the entire train ride.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Blaise!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Come now love, do you like me?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “You’re an arse Zabini.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “I want to know Harry, because I quite like you little lion.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “You’re such a charmer Zabini, but you can’t make me answer.” Harry huffs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     Blaise cups Harry’s chin and turns his head to him. “Please po ' d'amore.” Harry turns even more red at the sound of Blaise’s native italian. Blaise leans forwards and kissed the smaller Gryffindor on the lips, Harry in turn wraps his arms around the taller teens neck, kissing back. There’s a flash and the two break apart. Draco holding a photo in his hand.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “I am so keeping this. Do you want a copy?” Harry groans and buries his face into Blaise’s shoulder.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Draco.” Blaise growled at the blond.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “So not sorry.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     Blaise takes one of Harry’s hands, and kisses his knuckles. “ Don’t worry about it piccolo leone. We have the rest of the train ride, and hopefully the rest of our lives to kiss one another, and have more pleasurable activities.” Blaise winks at Harry.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     Harry groans, his face red and he punches Blaise lightly on the arm. “I so hate you right now.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Come now love, you don’t hate me.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Draco and I are going to go get some food from the Trolley want anything?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Chocolate frog, and a pumpkin patsy, please Theo.” Harry was about to take out his money but Blaise stopped him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “I’ll pay love, Theo you know what I like.” Blaise gave him a gallon and the two left the compartment leaving Harry alone with Blaise.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Harry, would you… Would you be my boyfriend, and allow me to court you?” Blaise asks looking down at their entwined hands, the dark skinned italians face even darker from his blush.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     Harry removes one of his hands slowly from their place and cups Blaise’s chin bringing his face up to look at him in the eyes, Blaise’s chocolate brown eyes searching Harry’s emerald green ones. “I would love to be your boyfriend Blaise, I don’t know much about courting, but I believe the gist of it is the dominant of the relationship buys the submissive presents over a certain length of time, and then at the end of the courting period is the engagement...” Blaise leans down and captures Harry’s mouth in a kiss, he tongues the seam of Harry’s lips, who opens his mouth to let Blaise’s tongue sweep into his mouth. They snog until Draco and Theo knock and enter the compartment. Both Harry and Blaise try to regain their breathing. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “So are you two an item now?” Theo asks them, passing their candy to them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “I caught our little Gryffindor, he’s mine now.” Blaise smirks at them, pulling Harry into his side, wrapping one arm around Harry’s waist.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “You two are cute together.” Draco muses. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Now we just need to get you with the two you like.” Theo teases the blond.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Oh shut it Theo, their family hates mine, how could I get them to look at me.” Draco huffs, crossing his arms.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “If the two you like are the Weasley twins, I can help with that Draco. Remember they are two I still consider family from that horrid family. Actually Bill and Charlie would be on my side as well. Bill started courting Fleur, and Charlie is about a mix of Bill and the twins, he would listen to me.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>     “Really! Do you think I would have a chance with them?” Draco asks quickly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>     “They might have mentioned to me in private that they like a certain blond boy in Slytherin, that hated them, and would never give them the light of day, but planned to send him presents over the next year until revealing themselves to him.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “The presents are from them! YES!” Draco punches the air and fall’s against the seat.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Well that is very amusing, both the twins and Draco thought they wouldn’t like one another because of their idiot families. Oh I wish I could be a fly on that wall when they see one another next.” Blaise snickers.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Well when your mother rescues me from my relatives after two weeks, you could write to the twins and they would gladly come over, they know how to get around their parents, and that stupid clock that Mrs. Weasley made to track everyone, to bad for her it only shows if the person thinks they are in danger, or if they think the place is home, so the twins told me they have to force themselves to think of the burrow as home.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “So if they were to hang out with the Dark Lord, and they don’t feel like they’re in mortal danger they wouldn’t show on the clock.” Theo muses.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Precisely Theo. Blaise just tell them that We need to manage mischief on the bumblebee and flamingos, that the Basilisk and munchers are safe for time being, that Raven is safe and hidden, if you wish to see the raven speak to Dragon and meet with him in darkness.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     Blaise looks at Harry wide eyed. “I feel so confused but okay love.” Blaise kissed Harry’s cheek when he huffs at him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “It is a code speak. Luna speaks it all the time, and only those she considered family are brought in, Draco take a guess on what I said.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Bumblebee is Dumbledore, Flamingos are the Order, Basilisk I am assuming is the Dark Lord, munchers are Death Eaters, Raven would be yourself, I am the Dragon, and darkness would be knockturn?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “Yep. the Mischief is a code that only a few people know about, and the twins love causing it.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “That is very smart, no one would know what you’re talking about unless you tell them what the code words are. Or you’re a Ravenclaw.” Theo muses out loud.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “That’s the plan, we don’t usually talk out in the open though, so it’s usually just in letters. But they will trust you since I told them to make some mischief. Now then we only have a few hours left, I want to write that letter to the Dark Lord, and spend time with Blaise.” Harry announces standing up and rummaging in his trunk after unshrinking it and taking out parchment, ink and a quill. Harry sits curled into Blaise's side, writing quickly, after giving it to Theo to correct, he writes it once more that meets the other's approval. After that they spend the rest of the train ride playing various games and chatting away, about an hour before they are set to arrive at the platform Theo and Draco hug Harry and say their goodbyes before leaving the compartment again. Blaise kisses Harry deeply after setting the compartment to lock. Harry moans into the kiss pulling Blaise closer as the older teen dominates the kiss. “ I really wish you didn’t have to go back to those horrid muggles.” Blaise sighs kissing Harry’s lips once more.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     “You’ll see me in two weeks B. Then you’ll get me almost all to yourself.” Harry teases him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>     Blaise growled lowly and kisses Harry again, Harry ends up pinned to the seat with Blaise on top of him, they both snog until the train conductor announced that they would be arriving shortly. Harry groaned and kissed Blaise one more time before getting up and making sure his trunk was shrunk. “I will see you soon love, just be careful.” Blaise kisses him one more time before leaving the compartment, Harry follows after a few seconds. He spots the twins and nods to them and then goes out to the muggle side where moody, kingsley and Mr. Weasley are talking to the Dursleys. Harry sighs and know’s that it will be a long two weeks.</span>
