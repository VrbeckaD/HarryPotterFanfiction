    <p>"Well it seems like your little girl is doing just fine and will be here in the next few weeks."</p>
<p>Two heads turned at the comment made by the doctor.</p>
<p>"Don't you mean our little boy?" the woman on the examination table asked. The doctor frowned and turned toward the ultrasound equipment that was showing the baby inside her womb.</p>
<p>"All signs show that it's a baby girl," he said. "And there's no chance of any confusion. Your baby is turned facing towards us, legs spread."</p>
<p>Laura Barton glanced down at her stomach and tightened her grip around her husband's hand, keeping him from speaking up. She would deal with this.</p>
<p>"I understand that you're filling in today for Doctor Peterson and haven't been with me for the whole process, but for the last three visits, Doctor Peterson clearly noted that we were expecting a boy," she said. "The paperwork should say so as well."</p>
<p>The doctor glanced down at the paperwork and sure enough, there were notes about the child being a boy. He glanced back at the screen again and there was no doubt in his mind that the child was a girl.</p>
<p>"If you'll excuse me for a moment," he said before quickly exiting the room.</p>
<p>"Let's go," Clint Barton announced as soon as the door closed. Laura shot him a sharp look.</p>
<p>"The appointment's not over yet," she told her husband, who snorted in reply.</p>
<p>"I don't trust this doctor," he said. "He can't even read a screen right."</p>
<p>Laura glanced over to the screen, where the image of their child was still being shown.</p>
<p>"Do you trust me?" she asked. Her husband looked offended by the question and refused to answer, causing Laura to roll her eyes in silent amusement. "I've given birth to two children and I've gone to several of my sisters and my cousins' appointments. I know how to read these ultrasounds just as well as any doctor."</p>
<p>"Where are you going with this, Laura?" Clint asked, beginning to feel like there was a big reveal just around the corner.</p>
<p>"For the past few appointments, I could see just as well as Doctor Peterson that I was going to have a boy. Now, however, I'm seeing a girl inside me. Clint, I think our baby has changed genders on us."</p>
<p>Laura's husband's hand twitched, as if it wanted to reach for his bow or arrow that Laura had insisted remain at home. He may be an Avenger but that didn't mean he needed to bring his weapons out in public, especially not when he could defend himself and her without them.</p>
<p>"That shouldn't be possible," he said, in disbelief.</p>
<p>"It shouldn't be," Laura agreed. "But lately a lot of things that shouldn't be possible have been happening around us."</p>
<p>"What are we going to do?" Clint asked.</p>
<p>"I'm going to give birth, you're going to be proud of this child no matter what gender it ends up being, and we're going to raise him or her like we've raised our other children," Laura stated. "And there won't be any complaints about it."</p>
<p>Any further conversation was cut off by the doctor returning, this time with a nurse in tow. She glanced at the screen and looked astonished by the results. The Bartons were sure that the rest of the clinic would have been called in had they not firmly reminded the medical professionals that they had other appointments that day that they couldn't miss. Less than half an hour later, Laura was dressed and was walking out of the clinic, ready to head home and watch her husband spend some time with their family for once.</p>
<p>As they exited the building, Clint snorted, drawing a look from Laura.</p>
<p>"Natasha's going to love this," he said. "She might get her little Natasha after all."</p>
