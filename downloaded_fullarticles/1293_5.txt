          <div class="userstuff"><p>He hadn’t asked for this to happen. Not really, not at all, not even in the corner of his mind that supplied every other inconvenient wish. And his mother would’ve been devastated, and she would’ve covered it up with anger, and she would’ve told him that he’s an even bigger stain to respectable blood that she thought before.</p><p>No, he hadn’t asked for any of this. But if he had, perhaps it wouldn’t have happened, and where would that leave him now? Alone, fighting this war and coming home empty. He’d be left without that brownish goldish hair, without sibilant morning whispers, without this hand on his waist and without this slow pianohorncrooning sound in the air. Without honey-colored eyes to follow him and notice him and give way to that little crinkle that only he’s allowed to see.</p><p>
  <em>Everything falls into place in the end, isn’t that right, Moony?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Only for you, Padfoot, only for you.</em>
</p><p>Sometimes Sirius liked to pretend that their house was still. That the rotation of the earth and the spinning that made children perish and masks raise couldn’t find their flat, and they would be able to forget, one day, about everything besides dog-eared books and chipped mugs and gasping kisses and fireside naps.</p><p>When he moved in, he brought all of the adult things that Sirius supposed he should’ve had by then. He’d looked around the empty apartment (not <em>totally</em> empty; a Bowie record was on the kitchen counter) and told Sirius that he knew a good charity shop and told Sirius that they’d be going that day, because his mother raised him better than to live like an animal. Then he raised his eyebrows and managed to make both a werewolf joke <em>and</em> Black family joke, all in the same breath.</p><p>It was the first time he went outside in a week.</p><p>Remus also noticed his nightly cigarette smoke brooding hours on the fire escape, and his eyebrows lifted in what is colloquially known as his <em>you’re all so fucking stupid</em> expression. He said he had <em>had enough, Padfoot,</em> and brought in some dusty french record that he said his mum loved. By the fifth rendition of Remus’s interpretive dance, Sirius knew two things:</p><p>One, he would never be able to hear the words, “ne me quitte pas” again without picturing gangly, corduroyed, legs plieing, and two, he was irrevocably in love with Remus Lupin.</p><p>And not the fresh, infatuated love of James and Lily, or the settled, comfortable love of Mr. and Mrs. Potter. The sort of love that was devotion and ballads and sunlit rooms and never wanting to be anywhere else, but that was mostly was a knowledge that forever did exist, and it took residence in Remus John Lupin.</p><p>Sirius was not one to wait. After these realizations, and after he was done laughing until he felt as though the stitch in his stomach would need a quick <em>episky,</em> he told Remus Lupin, in no uncertain terms, that: one, the dance he performed would truly only be rivaled only by the Salle Le Peletier, and two, he would like very much to snog him and never quite stop.</p><p>Remus, in a breathy, not <em>terribly</em> hysterical laugh, told him he quite agreed with both statements.</p><p>If they showed up to the Order meeting seven and a half minutes late with matching dazed faces and rumpled shirts, nobody but Lily gave them a second glance (with a smirk and crossed arms, a quick, “alright, mate?”).</p><p>Sirius most certainly was not waiting by the door when Remus came back from his Order mission that <em>you know I can’t talk about, Padfoot</em>. He brought a gash in his side and the burnt-hair smell of dark magic. Sirius knew he was supposed to be suspicious and vigilant and hardened and questioning but all he could think as he traced the crow's lines by Remus’s eye was, <em>I’ve become quite the doting housewife</em>, and then, as Sirius watched Remus’s eyes crinkle, <em>he’s going to love the new record</em>.</p><p>After Remus had washed most of the smell out, Sirius sat him in front of the fire and the kettle and replaced any doubt with antiseptic and bandages. He didn’t ask, but he knew that the cut was one that wouldn’t be healable with magic. A grateful tap on the hand let him know that he was correct. A slight hiss slipped from between Remus’s teeth as he applied the disinfectant. It was a slight, <em>alive against all odds</em> hiss, and it killed the lump in Sirius’s throat that he hadn’t realized had been building ever since Remus left.</p><p>An instinctual part of him, mindful of the cut, took Remus into his arms.</p><p>The disbelieving, lightly adoring look on Remus’s face provided even more proof that Sirius was quickly turning into a fifth year Hufflepuff girl. And, really, Sirius did not need any more proof.</p><p>Blushing, though he’d adamantly deny it, he grasped under the couch for a dusty box. Remus’s eyebrows lifted. Sirius shot him a debauched (constantly, constantly debauched) grin and opened the box to reveal what the Marauders referred to as Remus’s only vice: weed (that Sirius got through Peter who got through Marlene who got through her Muggle cousin).</p><p>With a contented sigh, a carefully rolled blunt, and three smell reducing charms (they were still paranoid twenty year olds in a muggle flat, okay?), Remus shook off the residual tenseness from the Order mission that <em>you know I can’t talk about, Padfoot</em>. He seemed younger. Not happier, he couldn't be - Sirius liked to pride himself that he made Remus the happiest he could be - but freer. Less inhibitions. Like he was still a fifteen year old kid, telling his friends about how he’d snogged Henry Ackerman the Hufflepuff in Filch’s office.</p><p>A week later, Sirius decided it was about time to properly celebrate. Something. In his head, it was Remus’s alive-hiss and how they were a couple of months into this war and how Sirius had forgotten the color of his father’s eyes. So, he flooed Peter and told him to floo anyone he knew, used the mirror to yell for James until Lily’s tired face popped in, and serenaded Remus with that new Kate Bush song as they cleaned the flat.</p><p>Somewhere between firewhiskey two and three, while the party has reached it peak and that Kate Bush album is blasting (<em>“It’s fucking good, Prongs.”</em>), Remus slides a hand across his back to his waist. And, he really isn’t drunk enough to justify the glitter in his eye or the languidness of the entire thing, but he still pulls Sirius into his arms anyway. The kiss they share, as Dorcas will sigh and James will laugh and Gideon will smirk, is possibly the most explicit thing anyone at the party had seen (that week) from Remus. It’s slow and sloppy, half-drunk but thrumming with heat, and Sirius is at an unfamiliar loss for words when they part.</p><p>He turns, and James is whooping, Peter is gaping, Marlene can’t seem to stop laughing, and Dorcas has a hand over her eyes. Everyone else can’t quite seem to act casually fast enough. Lily, <em>god bless her soul</em>, throws an arm over each of their shoulders.</p><p>With a smile bigger than the room and mirth overflowing in her eyes, she loudly exclaimed, “how’d you boys know what I’ve been dreaming about?” And everything seemed to have gone back to what it had been, though James didn’t really ever stop talking about their kiss (Marlene and Dorcas didn’t stop talking about it either, or how their status as <em>‘gayest wizards to date'</em> was finally challenged).</p></div>
