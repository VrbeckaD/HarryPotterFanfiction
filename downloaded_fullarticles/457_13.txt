    <p>I remember the day I met Gellert Grindelwald for a good many reasons. Perhaps strangely, all these years later what I remember most is how I felt when I slipped into bed later that night, utterly exhausted, utterly alive, and filled with a sense of luck that for once was not accompanied by guilt.</p><p>For of course, I have always been very lucky. In a world filled with magic, one should never underestimate the forces beneath us that remain unseen. I’ve learned to appreciate my luck rather than regret it, but that is a story for another time. People far my better have received much less than they deserved.</p><p>The night before I met him was a rough one. Ariana was inconsolable, as she had been every night since our mother’s death. She used to stay with her throughout it—flawed though my mother was, she was endlessly patient with Ariana, but our mother is gone, now. No one knows quite what happened.</p><p>The month that I was home alone with her, called back from Hogwarts right after my NEWTS, was perhaps the loneliest of my life. The good friend of mine that I planned on travelling with come autumn was still at school. Everyone was, really. And I was alone with Ariana, as I’d insisted, because Aberforth was a fifth year, and still had his OWLS and his NEWTS. I could afford to come home and be with her.</p><p>But when Aberforth came back for the summer, I must admit that I let him take care of Ariana. I’d used every bit of my magical ability to bolster the house with protective spells—to limit her ability to hurt herself and others. I’d invented a dozen different magical solutions to problems most couldn’t imagine. Glass that turned to jelly when met with force. A music box that could predict her mood and soothe her. I gave her piles of books, and when she was herself, she loved them. But even so, she must have been lonely. In the month before Aberforth was there, I do not think I left the house. I painted the constellations on her ceiling, made a potions laboratory in the basement to see if I could cure her. Nothing I could conceive of could make any improvement. It was all I could do to keep up with her, so that she wouldn’t get worse.</p><p>And so when Aberforth came home, I’m afraid I abandoned him to the house more than I should have. I felt, so wrongly, that I’d done my part. And so, the day I met Grindelwald, Aberforth was at home.</p><p>I left the house early that morning, as I often did. On the days that I did not hole up in my room and study, I walked. Godric’s Hollow was small and quiet. It still is. And the only thing unusual that happened that morning was a run-in with a rather nice neighbor, a woman I’d seen and who had come to our door on multiple occasions but whom my mother had never used to let in. She hadn’t been by in a while, perhaps almost a year.</p><p>She had a round, small face, and seemed to be always carrying something. She could have been very young or middle aged; it was hard to tell. And though I’d passed her several times on my morning walks, this time she stopped.</p><p>She gestured at me, clearly at a loss for my name, and dutifully, I approached. She looked me up and down, and I remember feeling nearly offended. Nobody’d really looked at me at all, since Ariana had taken ill. She frowned, and said, “I don’t see much of your mother.”</p><p>It would have sounded accusing had anyone else said it, but when she said it, it felt a little like recognition. I had no reason to tell the neighbors of our situation, but that was the first time that I’d considered it. It was in the middle of the night when the aurors were called, and few knew that Kendra Dumbledore no longer resided in Godric’s Hollow.</p><p>“You have a brother, yes?”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>“Well, bring him, and perhaps that secretive mother of yours along. The neighborhood is meeting for a nice little garden party. 8 o’clock. Midsummer, and all.”</p><p>She must have seen the hesitation on my face, because she followed it with, “It’ll do you good. My nephew needs someone to talk some sense into him, anyway, and you’re around the—how old are you?”</p><p>“Seventeen,” I replied.</p><p>“You’re around the same age,” she finished, and left me with a smile.</p><p>I never told Aberforth about the garden party. I suppose it was selfish of me, but it felt special, just for me. I justified it with the fact that someone had to stay home with Ariana.</p><p>I was just seventeen, you see. But I’m afraid I’ve used that excuse for my behavior far too much. Perhaps you will forgive me for my jealousy towards Aberforth, because I’d convinced him to stay at Hogwarts until he took his NEWTS—and you see, that was at my expense. I could’ve travelled the world, I could’ve invented a new potion and become rich; I could have gone to the chateau of Nicolas Flamel, whom I had met through an alchemy seminar. I am not exaggerating when I say that my skill and my hard work had made a genius out of me, no matter how self-aggrandizing I must sound. I could’ve been anywhere, but instead I was in Godric’s Hollow, by myself, debating whether or not to go to a garden party because I was so sick of myself.</p><p>I debated going to the garden party. I wasn’t sure what I would have to say. I’m not naturally social, but nor am I opposed to company. And perhaps I would find someone of interest. I knew myself well enough to know that I rather needed a distraction.</p><p>When I decided on it, it was a little late. There was the lure of voices over a high garden wall, and so I knocked on the door, twice: once softly, and again a little less softly.</p><p>The neighbor opened her door wide, a smile on her face and still half turned towards a friend of hers standing in the kitchen.</p><p>She looked surprised to see me.</p><p>“I’m Albus,” I said, “Albus Dumbledore. We’re next door neighbors?”</p><p>She smiled. “Welcome in. There’s dinner out back, and wine, too, if you’re really seventeen like you said.”</p><p>“I am,” I said.</p><p>“Almost graduated? Or did already? from Hogwarts, then,” she replied.</p><p>“Yes ma’am,” I said. “I just had my NEWTS.”</p><p>“Well, go on then, go talk to someone your age,” she said. She ushered me towards the back, and as soon as I stepped outside I was rather unsure of why I’d come. Most of the people there were twice my age, the sort of people that managed to make me feel odd just by looking at me.</p><p>I meandered towards the wine, or maybe it was mead. I poured myself half a glass—I wanted to look purposeful more than I was thirsty—and was surveying the garden when I spotted them. There were four boys, perhaps my age, perhaps a little younger, lounging around a table that looked like it had been half-heartedly transfigured.</p><p>I approached the table with more confidence than I thought possible, with the vague idea that if all else failed in my attempts to be social, I could fix the table rather well. Transfiguration—well, that’s always been what I’m rather good at.</p><p>When I finally reached the group—it had only been a few strides—I was almost surprised by how quickly time had moved. Two of the boys looked at me expectantly.</p><p>“I’m Albus,” I said.</p><p>One of them looked at me another moment, before turning back to what a third boy was saying. In my self-conscious insecurity, I had interrupted what seemed to have been an enchanting story, one that kept the three other boys in silent rapture.</p><p>The third boy caught my eye, winked, and carried on with the conclusion of his story. I remember feeling shocked by the eye contact itself, let alone the wink. It wasn’t flirtatious, necessarily, but it was—it was brash, genuine, personal. I was confused for a minute and thought perhaps I’d met him before and didn’t remember.</p><p>But surely I would have remembered.</p><p>I think, much to my embarrassment, I stood staring at him for a minute, him with his long, light-brown or maybe blond wavy hair, his wide, smiling mouth and bright green eyes. And while I was watching him, feeling almost as if I didn’t exist except as an observer—that I couldn’t be interacted with, he stood up.</p><p>“I think it’s time for some more wine, don’t you think, boys?”</p><p>The speed at which the boys stood up to fetch the wine from the table set out for it was astounding even to me, and I was at that moment both dumbfounded and perhaps a bit bewitched.</p><p>He extended his arm in a fluid, large action. “Gellert Grindelwald,” he said. “Don’t worry, I saw you there.”</p><p>I shook his hand. “Albus,” I said. “I live next door.”</p><p>“Bathilda’s my aunt. Well, great-aunt, really.”</p><p>“Bathilda,” I said, and I realized she must be the neighbor, the one that invited me. “So you’re living here?”</p><p>“Just for the summer,” he said, and for some reason I was shocked when the rest of the boys came back with the wine. They put down their cups on the table, but Gellert didn’t move to take any. He was waiting for something.</p><p><em>Am I a Gryffindor or not? </em>I asked myself, and I decided, in that moment at least, that I was.</p><p>“Care to go for a walk?” I asked, as nonchalantly as I could muster—which was admittedly not much.</p><p>“I rather would,” he said, and turning to the boys, he said, “I’m afraid I have some catching up to do with a very old friend. Please do enjoy yourselves.”</p><p>He said it like it was the simplest thing in the world, and he followed me out of the garden, through the house, and out the front door before we spoke another word.</p><p>It was a lie, that we were very old friends. But it was the sort of lie that felt true, and feels true, even now.</p>
