<p>“Guess who’s the new celebrity model for the Nimbus Racing Broom Company!” </p>
<p>Severus looks up from his book. “Model of what, exactly?” </p>
<p>“Decorum? Health?” Grinning, Harry abandons his pose, flopping onto the sofa beside Severus. “Hell if I know. But the money’s brilliant, and it all goes to the War Orphans’ Fund.”</p>
<p>“How altruistic.” Severus sets aside his book. “How much money?” </p>
<p>“Two thousand Galleons!” Harry coughs. “They’ll double it if you’ll pose with me.” </p>
<p>Severus raises an eyebrow. “Why would they want a dour model?” He smirks. “Even if I <i>do</i> have a height advantage.” </p>
<p>“Oi!” Harry pouts, then ruins it by laughing. “So, what do you think?”</p>
<p>Severus snorts. “About?”</p>
<p>“The offer. I’m serious. They want us both.” Harry sits up. “Could be fun.” </p>
<p>“Sounds invasive.” </p>
<p>Harry frowns. “How?”</p>
<p>“They would probably suggest we pose in intimate positions, show off our…relationship.” Severus scowls. </p>
<p>“How’s that a problem?”</p>
<p>“How’s—?” Severus huffs. “Salazar, you’re serious! Neither of us are exhibitionists! It could be disastrous.”</p>
<p>“Oh, so it’s not—” Harry looks away. “Never mind.” </p>
<p>“Not what?” </p>
<p>“Because you’re ashamed of me?” </p>
<p>“Ashamed?” Severus blinks. “Of having a gorgeous, young lover?” </p>
<p>“Well I don’t know!” Harry mutters. “It just seems like whenever there’s an opportunity for us to be seen together, you find a way to say no.” </p>
<p>“And you believe it’s because I’m ashamed?” Severus clasps Harry’s hand. </p>
<p>“I—maybe?” Harry links their fingers. </p>
<p>Shaking his head, Severus shifts, pulling him close. “For years I thought my heart a black hole — dense, no room for light, but then you entered my life, and now <i>you’re</i> the black hole, sucking me in despite myself.” Severus kisses Harry’s temple. “If I seem reluctant to display my feelings for you in public, it’s only because I want to keep you all to myself.” </p>
<p>“Wow.” Shifting, Harry leans on Severus’ shoulder. “Every time I think you can’t be romantic, you come out with a line like that.” </p>
<p>“Is it working?” </p>
<p>Grinning, Harry kisses Severus’ neck. “If your goal’s to get laid, yes.” </p>
<p>“Always.” Severus smirks as Harry rolls his eyes. “And to evade photographs.” </p>
<p>Harry sighs. “Fine, no joint pictures. You will come to the photoshoot, though, right?” </p>
<p>“Absolutely.”</p>
