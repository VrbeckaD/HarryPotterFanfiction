  <strong>WEDNESDAY</strong>
</p><p>12:35 – Sirius mate! Finally got a new phone</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>12:35 – Sorry, I’m not Sirius</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>12:36 – Who the hell are you?</p><p> </p><p>12:38 – Sorry, didn’t mean to be rude</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>12:39 – Don’t worry. I’m his brother, actually</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>12:39 – Sirius has a brother?!?!?!?</p><p> </p><p>12:39 – Just hold on for like half an hour until Sirius gets home</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>12:40 – Um, ok then</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>13:10 – Oh my god Sirius has a brother I did NOT know this I asked him and he was like "Yeah what the hell, didn't you know?"</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>13:10 – Well, I did already tell you…</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>13:11 – Yeah, yeah, doesn’t count. You could have been a creepy Mongolian stalker who can’t even pronounce Marmite for all I knew</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>13:12 – Ok….?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>13:14 – VOICE MESSAGE RECEIVED</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Marmite. There, I can pronounce it. Happy?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>13:15 – Deliriously happy, thanks. You sound so much like him</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>13:15 – Ahem, brothers</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>13:16 – Oh, yeah, right</p><p> </p><p>13:16 – Forgot sorry</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>13:17 – That’s alright</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>13:17 – So, what’s your name, Sirius-Black’s-brother-who-I-totally-didn’t-even-know-existed? I’m James</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>13:18 – Oh, so you’re James. Didn’t expect to meet you like this tbh</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>13:19 – Oh, and I’m Regulus</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>13:20 – Well, very nice to meet you, Regulus</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>13:20 – Yeah, lovely to meet you too, now that you know I’m not a random stalker</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>13:21 – Eh, I didn’t think you were a random stalker, just a stalker. Now, however, I know you’re just random</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>13:22 – Thanks ever so much, you’re really making me happy that I’ve met you, I must say</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>13:23 – Please, do continue to make me feel welcome</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>13:24 – Oh fuck, you really are his brother, aren’t you. You sounded just like Padfoot then</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>13:25 – Padfoot?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>13:26 – Yeah. Nicknames we gave each other at school. Where’d you go to school?</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>13:27 – Eton. I wasn’t the family disgrace</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>13:28 – Yet.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>13:28 – I definitely am now. Well, the other family disgrace, at least</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>13:29 – Why, what’d you do?</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>13:30 – Well, after Sirius started dating Remus, I realised that maybe I also liked boys</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>13:30 – So you’re gay too? And they disowned you for that as well?</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>13:31 – Nah, bi. I was very nearly disowned, but only just wasn’t because a) I wasn’t dating an army boy like Sirius, b) I wasn’t dating and they hoped it was a phase (wasn’t), and c) you can’t have an heir if you disown both your sons</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>13:33 – Oh. Alright then. I suppose that’s fair enough, even if it’s slightly cruel and manipulative</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>13:34 – You haven’t met our parents, have you?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>13:34 – They are the literal definition of cruel and manipulative</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>13:35 – No, and I count myself lucky that I never did, based on Sirius’ stories</p><p> </p><p>13:36 – Listen, I’ve got to go to work now, so have a good day, yeah?</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>13:37 – Oh, sure</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>13:38 – You too!</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <strong>THURSDAY</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>06:09 – Did you ever get Sirius’ actual number in the end?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>09:15 – Yeah, I did thanks. Sorry, I was asleep. Y’know, like a normal person…</p><p> </p><p>09:15 – What the hell does anyone do at 6AM?</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>09:16 – Oh, sorry. I just couldn’t sleep. I forgot that most people don’t like being awake at 6 in the morning</em>
</p><p> </p><p>09:17 – Ah, don’t stress it. I should’ve been up anyway, got work again this afternoon.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>09:18 – Where do you work?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>09:18 – Oh, and now the stalker side comes out</p><p> </p><p>09:19 – Bookshop in the middle of London</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>09:20 – Not actually a stalker, sorry. I only follow you around and take notes every 2<sup>nd</sup> day hehehe</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>09:21 – “Not actually a stalker” he says</p><p> </p><p>09:21 – Riiiiiiight</p><p> </p><p>09:22 – Well then, Mr Stalker, what’s my full name?</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>09:23 – James Fleamont Potter</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>09:24 – Oh my God you are a stalker!</p><p> </p><p>09:24 – Help!!!!</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>09:25 – I feel like texting said stalker for help in escaping is not the smartest move</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>09:26 – Nah, but really, I’m a police officer, CID, and I just found your file</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>09:27 – Well, consider me impressed, Mr Black!</p><p> </p><p>09:28 – Or is that Detective Black?</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>09:29 – …Well actually…</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>09:30 – You’re actually called Detective Black? Hahahaha</p><p> </p><p>09:31 – Wait didn’t you just say you were at work? What the hell are you doing just texting me?</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>09:31 – Fishing for criminals…got anything to hide?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>09:32 – Ok, I admit it, it was me. I ate the last cookie. Just don’t tell Sirius</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>09:33 – God, no. I don’t want you to die, odd as you are</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>09:34 – Hey! Not nice. *pouts*</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>09:35 – Are you actually a toddler? Bc I’m kind of getting that vibe here…</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>09:36 – Anyway, have to go. Real criminals to catch</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>09:37 – Have fun arresting people!</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>09:38 – I will :)</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>FRIDAY</strong>
</p><p>07:41 – So. Arrest anyone interesting?</p><p> </p><p>07:41 – Any up-and-coming Moriartys?</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>07:42 – Moriartys? Other than my brother, no. But I did question several people. Very fun. Threatened them with Celine Dion</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>07:43 – That’s the way to do it! Cruel and unusual punishment, Detective Black</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>07:44 – You’re never going to let that go, are you?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>07:45 – Why are you up so early, anyway?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>07:45 – Nope. And I’m up because I’m cooking breakfast for a very hung over Sirius</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>07:46 – Oh, that sounds awful, you poor thing</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>07:47 – It’s truly terrible. He’s glaring at me across the table because I’m reading aloud what you’re saying</p><p> </p><p>07:48 – Fuck off Reg, I’m too hung over for this and I need Prongs to cook me breakfast, not just stand there texting you and smiling like an idiot</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>07:49 – Don’t call me Reg. You shouldn’t have been so drunk if you didn’t want a hangover. Make your own fucking breakfast you lazy sod</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>07:50 – Sorry. He insisted that he was only going to say good morning</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> 07:51 – That was good morning</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>07:52 – Prongs? Nice nickname…</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>07:53 – Oi, don’t knock it, Detective Black</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>07:54 – Alright, alright. You or Sirius ever going to tell me the story behind them all? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>07:55 – Nope. Never.</p><p> </p><p>07:56 – If you’re such a good detective maybe you should just deduce it or something</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>07:57 – James I’m not fucking Sherlock I hope you know that...</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>07:57 – You’re not? I was looking forward to meeting you for the first time because I was expecting you to wear a deerstalker</p><p> </p><p>07:58 – Unless you’re the Benedict Cumberbatch kind of Sherlock. In which case, that’s hot</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>07:59 – You what now?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>07:59 – Actually, I don’t want to know</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>08:00 – Smart decision</p><p> </p><p>08:01 – I have to go. Sirius is glaring at me because I wasn’t watching the toaster and his precious toast is burnt</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>08:02 – Sirius is a wuss. Tell him to just suck it up and eat it anyway</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>08:03 – Will do. If I die, it’s your fault. Inform your department of this in advance</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>08:04 – Sure. Have fun with my hung over brother!</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>08:05 – Ugh I hate you</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>08:06 – No you don’t</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>08:07 – You’re right, I don’t. Got to go for real this time now</p>
