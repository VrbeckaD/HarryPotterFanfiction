          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry could never be sure what to expect when he returned home to Teddy and Draco. </p><p>He’d found his fiancé teaching Teddy rudimentary flying techniques, (<em>‘Honestly, Harry. A boy has to learn. I’ve put down some cushioning spells’</em>) found the pair brewing up a basic Confusing Concoction (<em>‘We weren't really planning to use it on you Potter’</em>) and on one memorable occasion found the pair hypnotising those plate-sized spiders that hid in the dark corners of Grimmauld Place’s attic.  </p><p>So to find the pair playing a terribly domestic game of tea-parties? Harry thought that was the biggest surprise of all. </p><p>Draco appeared to have brought the Manor’s most luxurious tea set with him, and the two-hundred-year-old one-of-a-kind goblin antiquities were filled with fizzy pumpkin juice. Draco wore a slightly wonky transfigured crown. Teddy had turned his hair the same white-blond as his cousin and was wearing his Elsa dress.   </p><p>“Harry’s here!” Teddy cried, his face shiny with joy. “I’m <em>Elsa</em>, and Draco is <em>Anna!</em> You’re just in time!”</p><p>Harry laughed. He didn’t think he’d ever get used to the happiness that his simple <em>coming home</em> elicited from his family. Harry pulled up a chair and sat down. Teddy pushed a third sticky cup in his direction. </p><p>“You make a pair of very beautiful princesses,” Harry said, sipping the warm juice delicately. Draco  preened beneath his crown, but Teddy pouted at the comment.</p><p>“I’m the <em>Queen!</em> Queen Elsa.”</p><p>“Ah,” Harry replied, “I’m sorry, Your Highness.”</p><p>“I always thought I’d look good with a tiara,” Draco said, adjusting the crown upon his head. “After all, my lineage is the closest thing we wizards have to royalty.” He twisted his wand, and Harry’s cup turned into a knight’s helmet. </p><p>“I’ve been telling the Queen here all about your Dragon defeating exploits while we were at school. So after our tea-party we thought we’d go dragon hunting around the garden. We <em>have</em> to protect the Queen,” Draco said primly. </p><p>Harry, Knight of the Wizarding Realm looked at Princess Draco. </p><p>“I’ll take my chance against a dragon,” Harry smiled, “But I'll be doing this for you. After all, it’s customary for the Knight to win a <em>kiss</em> from the Princess.”</p></div>
