    <p>Tom is three, he has heard that he is small for his age, the women who work there say that, as do the couples that occasionally come to the orphanage to look for a child to adopt. Acting as though they are browsing through the merchandise of a store as they make comments, and inspect the children, turning their faces this way and that, grabbing their hands to check their nails. Pulling down their chins to get a look at their teeth. </p><p>They all seem to find him pleasing to look at, they say he has lovely features and big eyes, but a sallow, gaunt look to him that keeps them from adopting him. Tom thinks he has that look because he is not given enough to eat, the older boys have taken to stealing his dinner roll ever since the nurses stopped hand feeding him. He used to lie awake at night due to the hunger, and that made dark circles appear beneath his eyes that made a woman say he looked possessed, and so he learned to roll up in on himself until the hunger wasn't so pressing and he would fall asleep easily. The dark circles went away, but still no one expressed any interest in him. </p><p>Tom does not get along with the other children. At first they did not like him because he was a baby, and the couples that came in always cooed over the babies, giving them toys, or treats if old enough. Now it is as though they have made a habit of disliking him. Tom sits alone against the wall watching the other kids play together. The kids split up into groups of the same gender, organized by age. </p><p>The girls like to play house with dolls and using their imaginations, clap games, and they talk. Tom imagines house is a terrible game to play, the nurses seem to hate doing the chores and often complain about them to one another. The clap games look as though they would hurt your hands from the repeated slapping, and the songs they sing in their high-pitched whiny voices are irritating and most likely hard to remember. </p><p>Tom doesn't understand how they have so much to talk about, every day in their lives is the exact same. Wake up, wash your face, change your clothes, sit on your knees in front of a statue of a man suspended on a cross and pray to him. Have watery porridge for breakfast with a little circle of sugar in the center on some days. Other boys usually scoop it off his porridge when he has it so Tom prefers not to, that way their dirty spoons stay out of his porridge. They are then split up by age, Tom in the youngest group who are read to, while the older ones scratch words, sentences, and answers to math problems into the dirt while they can or share one small chalkboard when the ground freezes. They are then given a small lunch to hold them over until dinner, a bit of bread and cheese or some fruit. They are let out to play then until dinner which consists of his always stolen dinner roll and some sort of watery stew, or on bad days mashed beans. After dinner they are told to get changed into pajamas and go to bed, candles are to be blown out fifteen minutes after they are sent to bed. </p><p>Tom has nothing to talk about, even if someone were to speak to him daily, he would have nothing to say. Perhaps that is why no one takes him out of here, because he does not chatter like the other children. </p><p>The boys like to play around with the few battered footballs and tennis balls they have, or wrestle with one another. Some of the older ones spend some time staring at the girls but rarely approach them. Their methods of play too different for Tom to be able to understand why they would want to. Tom does not understand why the boys will sometimes begin to cheer as they pass around the balls, or why they will become enraged, towering over others and yelling angrily the way they sometimes do to him. The wrestling looks like it hurts, and it gives them bruises and ruins their clothing making it less likely someone will pick them. </p><p>Tom does not wish to do any of those activities and yet he continues to watch them every single day. One of the nurses even gave him permission to borrow some of the books or a tennis ball, but Tom still watches them. He takes the books on occasion but reads them at night instead, getting changed very quick so he can lay in his bed and look at the words and pictures that are on the pages. Sometimes Tom can even make them dance, those are his favorite nights. When he makes the pictures do as he pleases, the words he cannot make out disappearing off the pages entirely. </p><p>Tom wishes he could make the other children dance around the way he can the pictures in the book. How much more interesting they would be as puppets. Tom had once been given a puppet by a visitor, but an older boy had ripped it to shreds when he found it. Saying only girls played with dolls, angered when Tom corrected him, saying it was a puppet not a doll. Tom had gotten his first bruise that day, it was big and purple, and on his cheek. The visitor had winced when she saw it, but said nothing. It soon faded, becoming an ugly yellow before it went away entirely, leaving the skin blank and pale as before, but not taking with it the memory of being hit. After that Tom often had a bruise. </p><p>The other boys would hit him when he would tell them they could not take his food, they would hit him when he read words they couldn't, and they would hit him when grownups said he was adorable. </p><p>Tom wasn't sure what the word meant exactly, but it was bad because it would make others hit him, even if it was said cooingly. Not everything said in a coo was good, sometime the boys cooed at him mockingly, perhaps the grownups were mocking him too. Tom hated not knowing things, but no one answered his questions, from some of the women he would get exasperated sighs, and others would tell him to shut it so he learned to stop asking but never to stop wondering. </p><p>Tom wanted to know what adorable meant exactly, he wanted to know what the sugar on the porridge tasted like. He wanted to know why the other children didn't like him, why they ignored or mocked him. He wanted to know why he was in the orphanage, he had heard from an older boy that his mom was a whore. He wondered what a whore was, and why the whore had left him here. Why she wasn't here with him. 

He wondered why none of the couples ever decided to take him with them like he had seen them take other children. Tom wondered what was inside the statue of the hanging man they prayed to that made it so powerful. He looked to be in quite a predicament himself so how was he going to protect them and grant their wishes. Tom wondered why none of his wishes ever came true. Tom wondered if they ever would. Tom wondered if he would ever get out of here. 

Most of the women who worked here had started off like him, abandoned children in the orphanage and they had never gotten out. One of the older girls said they might become like those women.</p><p>Tom did not want to stay here forever. He fantasized that one day he would get out and explore the lush green lands in his books. Just him and the wilderness. Maybe he would learn to make the leaves dance for him. No one would hurt him there, no one would sneer at him, spit at him, or inspect him. He would be free to wander. He had once told the only nurse he liked there about these fantasies of his and she had asked if he would be lonely. Tom thought maybe he would, but people didn't seem to like him so he was better off wandering these lands alone.</p>
