The rustlings of the leaves have lulled them to sleep. One second long, the soft summer breeze allows her not to think.</p><p>Of course the quiet can’t last. Little Osborn comes running, calling out for his auntie. Temples throbbing, Molly turns around and smiles at the little boy. </p><p>He jumps on the low brick wall next to her, dirtying his blue trousers. The corners of his little mouth turn upwards as he asks, “What you thinking about?”</p><p>Molly can’t tell him the truth. She can’t tell him she’s thinking about his uncle, who is far away in Africa and who probably about now has found out that his brother died. Molly has been thinking all day of the painful grieve he must be feeling. </p><p>Red lips turn upwards as Molly tries to distract little Osborn from the sadness in her eyes. “I was thinking about how happy everybody is going to be when your uncle arrives home.” </p><p>“I can’t wait to meeting him,” little Osborn tells Molly in his broken English. The Squire does not spare expenses to teach his grandchild his father’s tongue, hiring a tutor as well as teaching him so words himself, but the boy still has some things to learn before he can speak English as well as his mother’s tongue.</p><p>“I bet he can’t wait to meet you too,” Molly assures the little boy. “He’s going to love you even more than we do.”</p><p>Molly is sure she’s speaking truth. Roger loved his brother -  they were two sides of the same coin, twins separated by years - Osborn’s child is going to be one of the two people who matter the most to him. </p><p>Sometimes Molly tries to believe that she too is important to her best friend, that he holds her in an even higher esteem then Cynthia. Maybe he has realized Molly would make him a good life companion. But she knows it is only wistful thinking. He sees her the way she saw him up until recent times. </p><p>Little Osborn’s eyes sparkle in the light of the June sun, the pair of them still fixed on Molly’s pale face. His little chubby legs swing, propelling his little feet against the red brick of the wall. </p><p>Roger’s return will be good for the little boy as well as for his grandfather. He will tell his sire that having the mother around is beneficial for the boy. Little Osborn will not have to part with his mother. </p><p>As for the Squire himself, Molly can tell he is still suffering, even when his demons have lost some of their power now that the pitter-patter of little feet can be heard in the halls of the house. He needs his son at home, where he can touch him, look at him as a reminder that he still has a son left. </p><p>The only one who wouldn’t benefit from his return would be Molly. She is going to need to face him, knowing that he means more to him than she does to him. </p><p>“Why you sad?” little Osborn asks, head cocked to the side as he looks at Molly with curious eyes. </p><p>Suddenly, Molly can feel wetness on her cheeks. Tears have started falling down without her knowledge. With hurried hands, she wipes them away. </p><p>“It is the sun, it’s hurting my eyes,” Molly lies, sinning to preserve the innocence of the little boy. She smiles at him, an attempt to ease his worry. “Maybe I should go inside before its beams blind me.”</p><p>“I did not know sun could do that,” little Osborn tells Molly, his eyebrows dipped downwards to indicate his confusion.</p><p>“Only if you’re not careful,” Molly assures the little boy. “That’s why I need to go back in the house. Would you mind accompanying me?”</p><p>Little Osborn puffs up his chest and nods his head. He seems eager to help Molly. Eyes earnest, he looks like a small gentleman, causing Molly to bite back a fond chuckle. </p><p>“Shall we go, then?” Molly asks. She rises from the brick wall to smile down on little Osborn. The small boy curls his lips upwards in return as he jumps off of the wall without any help. </p><p>He holds out his arm for Molly to take, like his grandfather taught him and Molly takes him up on the offer, as her father taught. </p><p>The wind is still rustling the leaves as lady and small gentleman make their way beneath the green trees back to the house.</p>
