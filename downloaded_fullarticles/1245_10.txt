    <p>And so it went, Professor Mcgonagall telling everyone in the great hall that the whole of Slytherin house are to be locked in the dungeons. No exceptions. No if, but’s or maybe’s. The Slytherin house as a whole must surely be evil, from the seventh years to the first. From the ones who know more illegal spells than Mcgonagall could think up to the ones who only learnt to float a feather this year.</p>
<p>So this is where it changes. Slytherin house will accept this no longer. Professor Mcgonagall says that Slytherin house is to be locked in the dungeons and one lone Slytherin steps forward and dares to say “no, you don’t get to do that to us. You don’t get to stand there and condemn us. You don’t get to call a whole house evil because you think you know us better than we do. Maybe you are right, and some of us have joined, or some of us have parents, aunts, uncles, possibly even siblings, standing with you-know-who even now, but you don’t to make that assumption. How dare you say we are to be locked up. We who stood in this hall at eleven, excited and ready to be sorted, only to be boo’d at for being ambitious. And if you think the next seven years are any better, then you are not only blind, but stupid. So no, you don’t get to do this to us. We will do what we’ve always had to do— look after ourselves.”</p>
<p>With that spoken, as though preplanned (and maybe it was, maybe the slytherin’s have always been waiting for this moment, the moment hogwarts gave up on them) the sixth  years, grabbed hands with the first years and walked out. The fifth, fourth, third and second years grabbed their nearest partners and followed with the seventh years being the last to leave, always ready for an attack from behind.</p>
<p>In the dungeons, amongst the green of their house, a choice is made. Those who want to fight for Hogwarts, stand by the ones who may refuse to see them as anything more than a Slytherin, can. Those who want to stay with the younger years, to guard them in case someone decides to do something about those to young to fight back, they are welcome. Those who want stand beside their family outside these very halls, stand behind the man claiming to be the best of House Slytherin, they too can. Words are spoken, first softy, then loudly. Slytherin house while cunning and ambitious, will look after their own. Hogwarts may no longer welcome them, but their family has always been in this very common room. So while some leave to join family, others shepherd the younger years in dorm rooms furthest from the entrance, while those who can and are willing stand ready to keep them safe.</p>
<p>“Or perhaps in Slytherin, you’ll make your real friends.”</p>
