She didn't even need to be fully awake for her brain to send the adrenaline rushing through her system, for her to grab her wand from its usual place under her rumpled pillow and run toward the source of the sound.</p>
<p>She skidded into the kitchen, and it took several moments for her to process exactly what she was seeing. Which was her husband, standing on the countertop with one shoe on his left foot and the other in his right hand. And a two-inch-long brown cockroach on the tile on the other side of the kitchen.</p>
