    <p>Â <em>"</em> <em>When beings die, most fall into the welcoming arms of Death - finally able to escape the sufferings of the mortal world. But some, some of those who are neglected by Death itself, become spirits which we know as ghosts, devils or angels. However, only a few take the obscure form of a Conscious.</em></p><p><em>The Conscious is not a spirit: it is only the mere longings of a dead being. They cannot be seen, nor heard, nor be free from their sins. They are just there - wandering silently - as everything goes past them. They cannot change, nor stop things, nor warn their loved ones on what is </em> <em>to happen</em> <em>. They are unable to do anything.</em></p><p>
  <em>They can only exist, whilst others are lead to believe that they do not."</em>
