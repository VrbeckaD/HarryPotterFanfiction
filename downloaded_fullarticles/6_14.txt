    <p> </p><p>Harry woke up with a start.  The bed was soaked with sweat.  In his head were the vague recollections of the nightmare that had woken him.  Memories of the accident swirled in his head, combined with the old nightmare.  The flash of green light and the scream.  His leg ached, another reminder of the injury nearly 9 months previously that had ended his career. Getting up he noticed that the bed was empty, Ginny’s side unslept in.  With a wave of his wand he cleaned the sheets leaving the bed pristine and limped towards the shower.  He hoped that the lingering memories and the nightmare would be washed away in the hot water. </p><p>The first one up as usual, Harry set himself to making breakfast. Looking at his watch he saw it was approaching 7am.  The boys would stay in bed for hours longer if he let them, but Lily, like himself, was an early riser.  He started making a batch of scrambled eggs, whisking them the muggle way.  He’d never bothered to learn all of Molly’s tricks in the kitchen, instead utilising the skills from what felt another lifetime; making breakfast for the Dursleys.  It was rarely with fondness he looked back at his past life; the one before the day Hagrid came and changed everything.  He still enjoyed cooking however, and scrambled eggs and bacon on toast felt like the perfect cure for the remaining unease left from his dream that the shower hadn’t quite managed to dispel.</p><p>Lily, as Harry had predicted, stumbled down in her PJs before Harry had even started putting the toast on.</p><p>“Sweetheart, can you start the toast whilst I finish the bacon” he called without turning around. </p><p>“Sure Dad, brown or white”</p><p>“You know I don’t mind which, but given your mother seems to be out still and Al and James prefer white, we can go with that.”  Ginny always disapproved of white bread, but then she would probably also disapprove of the large amount of butter, salt and cream he had mixed into the eggs, as well as his failure to trim the fat off the bacon.</p><p>“Can we have black pudding too?” Lily asked. </p><p>“Sorry honey, we seem to be all out”.  There was a slight look of disappointment on Lily’s face, but she carried on making the toast.  She had cut the loaf of fresh white bread into thick slices.  Al and James could devour a loaf by themselves.  When the first four slices came out of the toaster Harry put a warming charm over them. </p><p>“Once you’ve put the next four in try and wake your brothers up for breakfast, I want to get to Diagon Alley before it gets too crowded.  Your mother said she was going to come with us but as she’s not here we’ll have to manage without her.”</p><p>Harry finished the bacon and toast, and placed them, along with the eggs in the middle of the table under warming charms.  He got the brown sauce and the ketchup out of the fridge as the noise of a herd of baby elephants came down the stairs.  Lily had obviously managed to get the boys up. </p><p>“This looks great Dad” exclaimed James as he started piling his plate with breakfast.</p><p>“Yeah, love it when mum’s not here for breakfast and we can eat like this” Al said, mouth already half full of food.</p><p>Harry didn’t feel quite so happy about Ginny’s absence.  Since his accident it was becoming a more and more frequent occurrence.  He knew he probably hadn’t been the best husband since it happened, sitting at home and feeling sorry for himself in between throwing all his effort into physio didn’t make for the best relationship, but she hadn’t even bothered to tell him she wasn’t coming home yesterday.  She was also breaking her promise to the kids that she would be joining them for back to school shopping.  Instead he would have to manage the three of them plus the shopping by himself.  It wasn’t that this was a chore in particular, Diagon Alley still seemed a place of wonder, even after all these years.  It was just that with his leg, moving around the crowds wasn’t so easy anymore.</p><p>“Are you all done?” Harry asked his three children.</p><p>“Yes Dad” came back the chorus of voices.</p><p>“Ok, I want to leave for the shops in 45 minutes.  Be clean, and dressed, and ready by the fireplace in in that time.” Harry said trying to sound authoritative.  Then as an afterthought “and please remember your booklists, I do not want to have to go back later and get anything you’ve forgotten”.</p><p>“Thought mum was coming” Al exclaimed.</p><p>“Something came up, and she can’t.” The excuse was feeble, and Harry knew it.  Harry didn’t even know where Ginny was at that moment. </p><p>The kids ran upstairs to begin the fight over who got to use the bathroom first and Harry cleaned up the remains of breakfast.  Although he always cooked the muggle way, there was no denying that being able to clean the mess left afterwards with a quick wave of his wand was easier.  Going into the living room, he thought about the prospect of shopping and started dreading it.  His leg seemed to be feeling particularly spiteful today, aching and tingling at the same time.  If only Ginny were here, maybe she could take them, and he could join them in a couple of hours for coffee or something.  At that moment, the front door opened, and she waltzed in.</p><p>“Thank God you’re here, I thought you had forgotten about the school shopping” Harry sighed in relief.</p><p>“Oh… yeah, school shopping, about that Harry…umm, I have to go straight back out, I just popped in to pick up…uh, yeah…anyway, I have to head straight back to work.”</p><p>“Oh, okay” Harry said feeling irritated.  He knew there was something she wasn’t telling him, but he didn’t really have the energy to press the issue of shopping.  Instead Harry decided to ask about the other thing that was bothering him.  “Where were you last night anyway?  I didn’t know you were planning on not coming home.”</p><p>“I was covering the British Magical Sporting Awards.  I told you I was going to those and would probably be late.  Anyway, Lee and I were invited out to the party afterwards. I couldn’t exactly say no could I, it’s part of my job.  It didn’t finish until 2am so we crashed at a nearby hotel because I didn’t want to wake you.  I know how badly you sleep these days.”</p><p>Harry listened to her rambling explanation passively.   It seemed there was always some event that Ginny just had to go to.  She was a sports reporter and commentator.  Lee Jordan who used to commentate the Hogwarts quidditch games was her co-host, and had introduced her to it after becoming pregnant with James, closely followed by Al and Lily, had prematurely ended her quidditch career. </p><p>“Hey mum” Al said bounding down the stairs, the toothbrush still in his mouth muffling his words slightly. “You coming to Diagon Alley with us then?”</p><p>“Sorry, I’ve got to go back to work.  I met Marvin Kingston, the captain of the England quidditch team last night.  He promised me an interview and a chance to watch the team training today.  I should be back for dinner though.  I thought we could have poached salmon and new potatoes with fresh greens.”  ‘Nice of her to have decided what I’m cooking for dinner tonight’ Harry thought to himself, still feeling resentful about that his wife hadn’t deemed him important enough to inform that she would be out all night.</p><p>Al seemed to accept the explanation and ran back upstairs to finish getting ready.  Ginny followed him up the stairs and went up to their bedroom.  She was showered, dressed and back out of the house before James and Lily had finished getting ready.  She pecked Harry on the cheek on the way out but didn’t say anything.  Harry was left pondering the behaviour of his wife.  Maybe he should talk to Hermione about it, but he didn’t really want to involve Ron in his marital difficulties.  That fact that he was married to Ron’s sister made it decidedly awkward whenever Harry tried to talk about his relationship problems with either of his best friends.</p><p>It was more like an hour before all three of his children were ready to head out.  Harry looked over at his stick next to the fireplace.  He didn’t need it round the house anymore, and the thought of going out in public with it wasn’t appealing.  Given the way his leg was feeling this morning he also didn’t think he’d manage traipsing round the shops without the support, even if he hated people staring at the thing.  He grabbed it and shrunk it into his pocket.  He would resort to it if he had to and not before.  He threw a handful of Floo powder into the fireplace and the flames changed from red to green. </p><p>“In you go, James you first”.  He watched his three children whirl away through the flames, then followed.  He stumbled slightly as he got to the other end.  He was glad the Leaky Cauldron was pretty much empty.  He could only see Hannah Abbott reading behind the bar.  She had bought the place with Neville several years earlier after Tom, the old barkeep, had retired.  After the breakup of her marriage 4 years ago, someone else had taken over briefly as manager, but 6 months later Daphne Greengrass moved in and the two of them had been living here and running it ever since.  Hannah looked up and nodded at him and the kids, and then went back to her book.  He hadn’t spoken to Hannah since she and Neville had split.  Neville had never shared the full story about the breakdown of his and Hannah’s relationship.  All Harry knew was that Neville hadn’t been too surprised when Hannah had told him she was leaving him for Daphne.  Maybe Neville would be better to talk to than Hermione about Ginny, he hadn’t spoken to him in a while, but he still considered him a good friend.  Maybe Neville’s experience with Hannah would give him insight into what was going on with his and Ginny’s relationship.</p><p>“Okay you three, can we please get this done as efficiently as possible. I don’t really want to be here all day if we can help it”.  Al and Lily nodded.  James, Harry noticed, looked like he wanted to say something. He was shifting slightly nervously on his feet and kept looking round as if he was waiting for someone.</p><p>“James did you hear me? “</p><p>“Yes, you want to be done quickly.  It’s just I wanted to meet up with a friend and maybe do my shopping with them, rather than going round with you?  And then we were thinking about going for lunch” James said this rather hurriedly, as if he was scared, or embarrassed, of what Harry would think.  Harry didn’t have any experiences to draw on to empathise with how James was feeling.  He’d never had any real parental figures he’d needed to ask for permission to go off by himself and meet someone.  He’d only had himself to depend on and who cared where he was for most of the time when he wasn’t at school.  Ginny though behaved in a way, that to Harry, was very reminiscent of his experiences of Molly Weasley’s overprotective nature.  She rarely let any of the children go off by themselves during the holidays.  It seemed slightly ridiculous to Harry, given he had wondered freely in Diagon Alley without supervision from the age of thirteen, but whenever Ginny was there Harry tended not to fight with her, even though he felt much more laid back about the matter.</p><p>“You’re 17 James, of course it’s fine.  But I will be very annoyed if you don’t manage to do your school shopping or are late for dinner. You’re old enough to manage by yourself, even if your mother seems to forget it sometimes.”</p><p>Harry gave James enough money for lunch and his school things then left with his younger two through the back of the pub, into the busy shopping centre of Wizarding London.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
