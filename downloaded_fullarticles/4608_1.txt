    <p>Draco Malfoy was sitting in the now familiar waiting room at St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies, waiting to be called, when a copy of the Daily Prophet caught his eye. Curious to know the latest news on his former rival, Draco picked up the paper and quickly scanned the short article:</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <em>The Chosen One Returns to Hogwarts</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>By: Rita Skeeter</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Since defeating He Who Must Not Be Named, Harry Potter has secured his return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Mr. Potter missed his seventh year at Hogwarts, due to his pursuit of the down fall of You Know Who and was therefore unable to complete his N.E.W.T’s. “I wish to finish my education so I can fulfil my aspirations of becoming an Auror,” stated Potter in an interview with yours truly. </em>

  <em>Mr. Potter will not be alone in his return to Hogwarts. A handful of students who also missed school due to the War will be returning to Hogwarts on September 1st—</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Draco, I’m ready for you,” said a kind old witch sporting Healer’s robes.</p><p>Roused from the article, Draco looked up and followed the witch, bringing the paper with him. Once inside the brightly lit office, and comfortably seated on his usual chair, Draco placed the prophet on the desk in front of the witch. “Did you know about this?” inquired Draco.</p><p>After glancing down at the prophet, the witch slowly tilted her head up to Draco and responded hesitantly. “I did see that and I planned on speaking with you about that today in fact.” The witch paused, waiting for a reaction from the blond teenager in front of her. Draco continued to look at her expectantly, so she pressed on, “I am of the opinion, that you should write to Headmaster McGonagall and request to return as well–”</p><p>“Are you mad?” interrupted Draco.</p><p>“Please let me finish,” begged the witch. “If you still so strongly desire to distance yourself from your father and the reputation that he has made for your family, and if you truly wish to change and have a chance at a future free from his oppression, then I believe it is imperative that you obtain a job and not just live off your inheritance. If you too return to school, many more doors will be open for you, thereby helping you achieve your goals. This is a chance to prove yourself and forge a new path.”</p><p>“After everything I’ve done?” exclaimed Draco, throwing his arms up in frustration. “McGonagall would never allow me to return; they would never trust me. They think I am scum.”</p><p>“You won’t know unless you are willing to try. I believe the new Headmistress would be open minded and willing to hear you out. By just asking to return, you are displaying a new side to yourself, a more vulnerable side,” said the witch with almost a pleading tone. “That is not something that would just be ignored. Also, I could see no reason for her to think you had any ulterior motives.”</p><p>Draco sat lost in thought, mind racing. He had not contemplated the possibility of returning to Hogwarts. Healer Jones had a point; if he could finish school, he would have a better chance at obtaining a decent job and perhaps build a new reputation for himself. But could he do it? Could he endure another year at Hogwarts surrounded by people who hated him, especially Potter and his gang? Working with Healer Jones the past few months had really changed Draco; opened his mind to new beliefs and possibilities for the future, but had he changed enough to be able to endure returning to Hogwarts? Could he put into practice what he had learned the past couple months and learn to let things go, to not retaliate, or let anger arise within him? Had he really changed or was he just fooling himself with grand ideas?</p><p>“Healer Jones, do you really think I could do it?” Draco asked hopefully. “Do you think I am ready?”</p><p>“I do Draco, I do not believe you were ever an evil person,” said the Healer honestly. “As I have told you before, your father tried to push his beliefs on you, and you, wanting to please your father, tried to follow in his footsteps, to make him proud; yet you knew the difference between right and wrong in the most critical moments. You chose to do the right thing, Draco. You are a good person, I am completely confident that you are changing into a better person, a kinder person; the man you were destined to be.”</p><p>Draco’s chest swelled with confidence, beginning to believe the witch’s words. He would do this; he would show the world the man he wanted to be, he would show them that he was not his father. He had chosen to be his own person and take a new path. With new hope surging through him, he stood to leave, pausing in the doorway. “I hope you are right. I’m going to send an owl to Professor McGonagall immediately. Wish me luck.”</p><p>“Good luck Draco, and remember you can always write to me if you ever need advice or someone to talk to,” said Healer Jones. Draco nodded and gave her a feeble smile before leaving her office.</p><p>****</p><p>Professor McGonagall was sitting in her new office, lost in thought. The new school year would begin in a few short days and she was supposed to have been addressing her new Headmistress duties but she couldn’t help feeling as if she did not belong in this office. To her, it would always belong to Dumbledore.</p><p>A sharp tapping on the nearby window stirred her from her reverie. A large tawny owl was perched on the window’s ledge, eager to deliver its letter. Professor McGonagall arose from her desk, crossed over to the window, and opened it for the owl. With a soft hoot, the owl hopped over the window’s threshold and stuck out its leg. She untied the letter and offered the owl a few treats she had near the windowsill. Professor McGonagall unfurled the letter and read:</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Dear Headmistress McGonagall,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I have read in the Daily Prophet that Harry Potter along with a few other students from my year will be returning to Hogwarts this fall to make up their 7<sup>th</sup> year. I will completely understand if you do not trust me or do not wish for me to ever walk the halls of Hogwarts again. However, I wish to finish my schooling so that one day I may find employment and support myself. I wish to distance myself from my family legacy and one day repair my reputation. Will you please consider allowing me to return to Hogwarts as well?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Regards,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco Malfoy</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>As Professor McGonagall finished reading the letter she sighed deeply. So, Draco Malfoy wished to return to Hogwarts? Clearly there could be no malicious or devious intentions behind this. The war was over. Voldemort was dead. As far as she knew, Narcissa Malfoy was keeping a low profile ever since she ran off with Draco the night of the Battle. Lucius was in Azkaban along with the other Death Eaters the Ministry had captured so far. She could see no reason for Draco to return to Hogwarts, unless he truly did desire to finish his education. Besides, after the War ended, she has been promoting the unity of the wizarding community. She would be a hypocrite for denying him of his request to return.</p><p>Professor McGonagall wrote a quick reply to Draco, instructing him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual and that she would be meeting with him directly after the Welcoming Feast to discuss the terms of his return.</p><p>“Return this letter to Mr. Malfoy,” she said as she tied the letter to the tawny’s leg. The owl hooted in response and took off out the window into the early evening.</p>
