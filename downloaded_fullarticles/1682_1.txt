</blockquote><p> </p><p> </p><p>        Severus was sitting on the counter eating a bright green apple much to his husband’s frustration, who said “counters are for cooking not eating on Severus”. The longer haired husband rolled his eyes, and took another bite of his apple. They both were twenty nine years old.</p><p>       Their oldest was twelve years old, they had him last year of Hogwarts. Harry James was in many ways what James wished he could of  been in school, but with Severus’s striking eyes and pale skin. Everything  had also come from his papa. He was a Gryffindor, though he didn’t seem to enjoy teasing others, though that may have been Sev making it clear he would be heavily punished for such behavior by him, if not Dumbledore himself. The boy had been named after Harry Evans Severus’s adopted father from thirteen on. </p><p>   Their next child had just turned eight. They had waited for Severus to finish his masters in potions, before trying for her. Her name was Lily Helena. After Severus’s closest friend who had passed away fighting the dark lord. Lily was their sunshine. She looked very little like her parents. Her eyes were striking blue, like her grandmother’s, her skin pale, but with touches of rose to her cheeks. Her hair was proper spiral curls, unlike James’s wild hair. It was black like both of her father’s. She was cunning, quick witted, but so caring of their youngest. </p><p>  Ava Grace was three, (named after Severus’s own mother and his adopted mother) and the only of their three children with James’s eyes her hair was brown, nearly black, but still very much brown and straight as a board. She inherited James darker tan skin.</p><p>  James snapped him out of his thoughts about his children, who were still asleep it was summer  or as much as Scotland moors had a summer. “We are going to that orphanage again aren’t we?”</p><p>Severus’s tossed the apple core in the kitchen bin and nodded. “Yes we are, I still feel drawn to it, like we haven’t done what we are supposed to”.</p><p>          James groaned, he hated Wools Orphanage, he hated the Mistress of it, Mrs Miller was a harsh old woman who seemed to think it was her duty to harden the children under he care to the world. There was only so much their volunteering on weekends could do. Along with the clothes they sometimes brought, along with the toys that they collected which were muggle approved. But Severus insisted they had to, that they were searching for a child that he would only know when they met them. And that’s just the way it was. If it took another three or even ten years Severus would continue. He preferred if James joined him, but even if he did not, Sev would still be there most Saturdays. </p><p>  James looked at his husband dressed in a light brown button down shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbows, this man wore no binder like he had done throughout their teenage years and his chest was flat (muggle surgery being the cause), and a nice pair of dark muggle jeans. He was barefoot, pale feet on the tile floor. There was nothing James wouldn’t do for this wonderful man, who made himself uncomfortable to bring their beautiful children in this world. His love was a child puppy love, as a teen it was thinking he was in love, and as a adult it was as tall as a mountain and deep as the ocean. He knew no greater love besides their children, which were only here because his and Severus’s love.</p><p>  So James got ready for their weekly ritual. He brushed his teeth, and dressed in jeans lighter than those Severus wore, a short sleeved shirt maroon, and a pair of well worn boots. He long ago accepted his hair was the way it was. If Mrs Miller had a problem with his hair then so be it. They were doing her a great favor by helping. </p><p>He called for Nana the house elf who had cared for him as a small child. She was wearing at Severus’s request actual clothes, which she would only take if they promised to never free her. She wore a pale pink smock like dress, and wool socks. If out she had a pair of leather shoes, and a coat that was made for a small child. Along will hats, scarves and gloves. She was a well taken care of house elf. She was and would always be part of the Potter family. </p><p>She popped in to his room, “Master James be needing Nana?” </p><p>“Yes keep a eye on the children, and feed them breakfast when they wake up. I don’t know how long we will be, but feed them lunch as well if you must. Harry needs to do his homework for the summer. Make sure Lily practices her reading before going out to play in the yard. Ava is....” </p><p>The house elf finished his sentence for him “doing accidental magic, but isn’t old enough to reason with on it. Correct her with no’s, timeouts and corner time if it gets too out of hand. She’s got the problem master Severus did as child with the ability to understand what she’s doing to a point. Take her in the yard to play as well. Don’t allow her to jump of the swing set. Anything else Master James? Anything Nana forget?”</p><p>”No Nana your the best. Your always going to be the best house elf ever.”</p><p>”Thank you Master, Nana loves taking care of the children, I was so sad for many years when your parents couldn’t have kids, and was so happy to take care of you. And now I have many children to take care of. Did Master Severus Mention Orion, is being dropped off by Sirius tomorrow?”</p><p>”No Nana it must of slipped his mind. Thinking of Severus’s god son, the son of Lily and Regulus. Merlin bless their souls who were killed when the boy was only one years old. </p><p> </p><p> They Apparated a few blocks down from their destination in an alley. They walked hand in hand getting a few dirty looks from muggles. Severus kept them out of his thoughts, they were just muggles. While it made James’s blood boil. How dare they? He had been with this man since he was thirteen years old! How many freaking muggles could say the same? How many had a stable happy relationship who cares if they were two men? </p><p>   When they reached Wools there was no dirty looks from Mrs Miller, Ms Graves the other employee they generally interacted with. They while did not approve of the two men, were grateful for the two men who took it upon themselves to help this place, where most people simply ignored them. </p><p> The one to greet them was the grey haired Ms Graves, her mud brown eyes lighting up when she recognized the two men. “Good you came, I really need the help, we got a large bunch children from the east end. They had nowhere else to send them. “ </p><p> Severus thought to himself maybe the child they were waiting on was in this bunch of children. “We would love to help with those new children Ms Graves. They likely are the ones you need the most help with anyway.”</p><p>    She nodded, telling them to follow her. They did their eyes scanning the rooms they passed, still keeping their eyes on the children might be the one they are looking for. There was no child that they passed that they were looking for. Not that they were bad children, surely they were not, but they were not the ones who called to him like a siren song of sorts. They child who needed them as parents, that if they did not seek that they would not find them.</p><p>      They reached their destination the farthest room from the front room. It was cold, dirty, and sparse. Beds in long lines, with thin blankets, ratty pillows and not much else, until he noticed the clothing folded neatly under the beds. Most of the children were playing hand games on the floor, others laid on their beds, others stared out the windows, others yet stared at the men who had entered the room. And one little child was sitting a old stool getting their long rather busy hair short. The child was shaking and begging the person to stop, please stop, it hurts. </p><p>      Severus was about to ask the women to work when the woman finished cutting the child’s hair short. She had made quick work of it. Hacking at it with not a care in the world. She stared at Severus. Her brown eyes flaring, anger bubbled with pure anger and hatred. They howled, screaming like nothing any of the people in the room had ever heard before. The child’s hair sprouted back to what it was before. Collar bone length, bushy, curly and a red brown. The woman who cut the child’s hair letting out a scream. The children just stared. They were not un use to the child with the cinnamon colored eyes doing things just like that.  </p><p>Ms Graves turned pale and screamed “I have heard about you Henry! I was warned! I told you when you came here no funny business and that rat’s nest you call hair would have to be cut!”</p><p>”That’s the child we want Ms Graves. Henry or whatever his name is. We will take him home with us today if you will allow us.” Said Severus trying desperately to hide his anger. That was a magical child, and they did not belong here. The look in the child’s eyes not unlike his own at that age. That was the child for them. That was the child who called to him like a siren song, pleading for help. That was the child who needed his protection. And the child was other gendered like himself. </p><p> James nodded along agreeing with everything Severus said that was a magical child, and now he wouldn’t have to come back to this wrecked place ever again. Or be kind to the worst type of muggles on this earth.</p><p>Ms Graves hissed “then come to my office to fill out the forms, I do not understand why you want this freak, but you can have him. Pack your things Henry your going home with your new parents.”</p><p>  The child who may have been between five to seven nodded smiling, grabbing their things. Thinking to themselves maybe just maybe these men were like them. </p><p> </p>
