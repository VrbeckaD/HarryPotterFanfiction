The night after each transformation was always the hardest on him, but this one seemed especially rough. His bones ached, his body trembled, and his head throbbed. Some nights it was so bad, he had to go to the infirmary. A virus. Exhaustion. There was a new excuse every time. But, tonight, Sirius was determined to make everything better by himself.</p>
<p>Remus' eyes fluttered open, landing on the silver gaze just above him. He was abnormally pale, and his usually full cheeks were sunken in. Sirius' stomach churned as he studied the beautiful, battered boy.</p>
