He can feel Harry’s gaze on him, appraising, as he removes the lid and the tissue paper to reveal a dark wood photo frame holding a beautifully painted rendition of their soulmark. It’s larger than it appears in real life, and the artist has added a hint of color -- dark green along the leaves, a soft yellow on the star -- but it is a perfect replica of the ink that adorns their skin.”</p><p align="center">
