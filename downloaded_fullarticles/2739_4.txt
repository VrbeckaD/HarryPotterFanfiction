    <p>Cedric’s scarf is a vivid shade of yellow, bright as a sunflower on a lazy Sunday.</p><p>Cho’s nails, when she twines her hand in his, are the same soft grey-blue of the clouds outside the Ravenclaw common room.</p><p>The torches in the dungeons bathe everyone in a warm orangey glow that belies the cold and clammy air, and the potion in his cauldron is an eye-searing magenta.</p><p>His owl, Hume, has feathers the color of tree bark, except around her eyes, where they fade to a tawny brown.</p><p>Apparently, anyway. Cedric has never actually seen any of these colors for himself. Only had them described to him by well-meaning friends, who always explain colors by comparing them to things, not realizing that doesn’t really help at all. He was diagnosed with achromatopsia when he wasn’t yet a year old; most of those descriptions don’t mean a thing to him. His world doesn’t exist in shades, only light and shadow.</p><p>So when he hears the words, “Kill the spare!” followed swiftly by “<em>Avada Kedavra!</em>”, he doesn’t see green, only a sudden and searing flash of light.</p><p>And after that, nothing.</p><p align="center">♠</p><p>“‘Don’t kill Cedric! Don’t kill Cedric!’ Who’s Cedric- your boyfriend?”</p><p>Harry should probably take off his glasses. You can’t punch what you can’t see, and Harry very much wants to punch his cousin right now.</p><p>Actually, no. He wants the world to work the way his vision does. He wants Dudley, and especially the leer crawling up his face, to go away. He wants him to fade to greyish-brown fuzz, become something inconsequential, amorphous and easy to ignore. He wants the world to be as dark and barren and lonely as his mind.</p><p>And then, suddenly, horribly, he gets his wish. The temperature plummets, the sweat on the back of his sunburned neck goes clammy, darkness descends but the stars don’t come out. They run, him and his cousin, fear pumping adrenaline through their legs and driving them faster, faster, as the dementors give chase, making them shake when they collapse to their knees, when they can’t possibly run anymore. Slimy hands wrap around their throats and rotting mouths hover just over their faces. Smelling putrid, smelling <em>hungry</em>.</p><p>In the past, Harry always heard his parents. Had to listen to their desperation, their pain, until the choking moment when suddenly there was nothing more to hear. But Cedric didn’t say anything. He didn’t have time to. So instead, Harry sees it, over and over, the green light and the staring, unseeing eyes and the handsome face slightly blurred out because Harry’s glasses got knocked off. The last time he saw Cedric’s face, before he stopped being Cedric and started being a corpse, and he couldn’t even see it properly. His last chance, his final memory. Damaged.</p><p>And then he hears a whimper, low and defeated, coming from his cousin. So Harry raises his wand, and <em>doesn’t</em> think of Cedric, and once again evades death by the skin of his teeth.</p><p>Later- after the bombshell that is the entire conversation with Mrs. Figg, after the swarm of owls and contradictory letters, after nearly getting kicked out of the house he never wants to be at in the first place, when he’s sitting in his room by himself in the dark- it occurs to Harry that maybe, this should’ve been a bonding experience for him and Dudley. Facing death together, saving the person he’s always hated, should probably leave some kind of mark. Force them to understand one another, just a little bit, just a tiny scrap of empathy that makes them realize how pointless their former feud had been. But Harry just feels as he always does these days- angry. Trapped. Willfully misunderstood. Dudley’s earlier comment pricks like thorns weaving themselves behind his eyes.</p><p>
  <em>Who’s Cedric, your boyfriend?</em>
</p><p>What would Dudley know about it. What the <em>fuck</em> would he know about Cedric. Nothing, that’s what.</p><p>Nobody knew.</p><p>Because Harry didn’t tell them.</p><p align="center">♠</p><p>Full colorblindness means a lot more than not being able to color-coordinate his outfits. For one, Cedric is nearly blind, at least during the day. Without color as a filter, bright sunlight makes the world white out, makes his eyes water and screw themselves shut. There’s a spell that was invented just after he turned ten, and it helps tremendously; but Cedric still prefers the night, when circumstances reverse themselves and everyone else is left squinting and stumbling, while the world for him is as crisp and neat as a book illustration.</p><p>So, Cedric often has trouble picking out fine detail, but <em>movement</em>...well, that’s a different matter. It’s more than being able to see it; it’s like he can sense it without any input from his eyes at all. He knows when something moves, follows it instinctively- his eyes getting caught up in his mum’s hand gestures as she talks, his feet wanting to stomp in time with his dad’s when he walks inside and shakes the mud from his boots. He gets distracted, in his classes at the muggle primary school, whenever any of his classmates so much as fidgets.</p><p>Then, Cedric makes the second-greatest discovery of his life.</p><p>On the one hand, Cedric is aware that he shouldn’t be friends with Luna. She’s the kind of person who believes in crumple-horned snorkacks and outlandish political conspiracy theories. His dad always calls the Lovegoods “nutty”.</p><p>On the other hand, he likes listening to her stories, and Luna is also the type of person to invite a nearly-blind boy to try out her new Cleansweep, so Cedric privately thinks everyone else can go stuff it. Of course, he’s been forbidden by both his parents to so much as glance at a broomstick, and Luna might not care much for rules, but Cedric does. But almost every summer evening he can see the Weasleys just over the hill, their laughter carrying to him as he watches them swoop and dive and soar, and Cedric <em>wants</em>. He’s not used to wanting. His parents give him everything he could ever need and withhold almost nothing, so long as he asks politely first. He has no idea what to do with this aching in his chest, this pull of his heart towards the sky and open air, this <em>need</em> to be among them.</p><p>So when Luna says, “You can have a go, if you want,” Cedric breaks the rules without a second thought.</p><p>“Mum! Dad!” Cedric bursts into his house, overjoyed and tracking mud everywhere, Luna right behind him. He finds his parents in the backyard, sharing the Daily Prophet and a jug of pumpkin juice. His Dad smiles at him indulgently, but jumps up when he sees the broomstick, nearly overturning the jug.</p><p>“What do you think you’re doing with that!” he demands, his brow like a storm front.</p><p>Cedric holds the broom in front of him like a shield. “Wait, wait! Hold on a moment, I’ll show you-”</p><p>“Cedric Amos Diggory,” his Mum interrupts, “you give that broom right back to Luna, and-”</p><p>“Please!” Cedric pleas, beginning to feel desperate- he has to show them- “You’ll <em>see</em>, I can-”</p><p>“Oh, just do it, Ced,” Luna says placidly, and throws the Bludger and Snitch into the air.</p><p>Cedric hops onto the broom and speeds away from his parents’ outraged cries. In fact, everything fades away as he goes up and up and up, until there’s only clouds above and the gentle sway of trees below. He takes a huge breath- this feels <em>marvelous</em>- and then there’s a glimmer of movement in the corner of his eye. He races after the Snitch, knowing he won’t catch it right away, but the chase is almost better. Because he never loses the sense of it, the sharp, sudden bursts of speed as the little golden ball speeds around his backyard, and his body tells the broom to follow almost before he’s aware. He feels the Bludger swoop in from the side in a sneak attack, but Cedric just barrel rolls and keeps going. The broom is like a part of him, as natural as his racing heartbeat, the wind and sunlight worming their way into his blood. He catches the Snitch almost unconsciously, his hand grabbing what he can’t quite see, exactly, yet still knows is there. He catches the Bludger, too, when he lands and it dives straight for him.</p><p>His Mum and Dad aren’t yelling anymore. They’re not speaking at all, just staring, open-mouthed.</p><p>When he goes to Hogwarts the following year, they won’t let him try out for the team, insisting that eleven years old is still too young. But they buy him his own broom, and his second year, he makes Seeker.</p><p align="center">♠</p><p>Harry brings the note home on a drizzly March afternoon. Going from the rain to the over-warm house makes his glasses fog up, fuzzing out the lower half of Aunt Petunia’s face as he hands her the envelope, given to him by his teacher. It has his name on the front, but he hasn’t opened it. They’d know if he had, and then he’d be in even more trouble than the note will bring.</p><p>She opens it with a little scowl. “What have you done this time?” she asks.</p><p>“I don’t know,” he answers honestly.</p><p>“Only seven and already a delinquent, I just knew when we took you in-” her voice cuts off as she reads the note, and her scowl deepens.</p><p>“What is the meaning of this?” she hisses, waving the paper in his face.</p><p>“What’s R-E-P-L-A-C-E spell?” Harry asks. The word is hovering over his right lens.</p><p>“Replace,” Aunt Petunia says, like it’s a filthy word. “They’re telling us your glasses need replacing.”</p><p>Harry’s only had his glasses for three months. They’re heavy-framed, black, and square. Dudley broke them a fortnight ago, trying to flush them down the toilet. He’s been using sellotape to hold them together, and the left lens is cracked down the middle.</p><p>Aunt Petunia takes the note to Uncle Vernon, who’s sitting in front of the telly watching EastEnders. He reads it and grunts. “Just take him to the discount warehouse in Twickenham. And you, boy,” he points one of his sausagey fingers at Harry, “if you break this next pair, there’s no replacing them. If you can’t take proper care of the things we buy you out of the goodness of our hearts, it’s your own ruddy fault.”</p><p>“Yes, Uncle Vernon,” Harry says, because there’s no use saying anything else.</p><p>The warehouse itself is enormous, bigger than his young eyes can comprehend. Shelf after shelf, bin after bin, of overstocked and undersold frames- he wanders through the aisles as Aunt Petunia argues with a salesman, waving his prescription papers around like a battle flag, while Dudley wanders around looking for more things to break. Most of the frames all look the same as his old ones, which are still barely dangling off his nose. There are some lime green cat-eyes that Harry hides at the bottom of the bin and prays Dudley won’t find and force him to try on, a few that look like Mrs. Figg’s reading glasses, and another with rhinestones falling off. He wanders farther and farther, the sound of Aunt Petunia snipping at the salesman fading into background noise.</p><p>The dust gets thicker the farther back he goes, making him sneeze. Harry likes the glasses here better, though. They’re wire-framed instead of plastic, not easily broken, something he could bend back into shape himself when something inevitably happens to them. He tries on a circular pair, and they make him feel like that singer- John Lennon. There’s a poster of him in his classroom at school, with the word “Imagine” under his face. There’s no mirror, so Harry has no idea whether he looks stupid or not. Still, he likes the glasses.</p><p>“Can I have these, Aunt Petunia?” he asks.</p><p>She frowns as she takes the glasses and looks at the price tag, but the frown doesn’t deepen. “Oh, all right,” she says after a moment. “I want to be out of here as quickly as possible.”</p><p>He has to give them back, so they can pop out the fake plastic lenses and pop in his prescription, and the order won’t be ready for a few days. They have to drive all the way out here again, which makes Aunt Petunia suck on her teeth, but Harry doesn’t mind. He so rarely gets what he wants, and even more rarely gets what he dares to ask for.</p><p align="center">♠</p><p>“Your problem, Diggory old chap, is that you see the world in black and white,” Stebbins says, smirking and making his chair balance on two legs.</p><p>“Your problem, Stebbins,” Cho replies, before Cedric has a chance to open his mouth, “is that you thought that joke was funny the first time. Which, so you know, it wasn’t.”</p><p>She’s a bit touchy, Cho is, whenever they bring up Cedric’s little quirk. Not that she needs an excuse to argue with Stebbins.</p><p>“All I’m saying,” Stebbins says (ignoring her completely, and <em>Merlin</em> is he going to pay for that later), “all I’m saying, is that really, I don’t see what’s so damn hard for the goblins to understand. You pay for it, you own it. ‘S that so bloody difficult?”</p><p>“But the culture is different,” Cedric argues. “Ownership means something different.” And really, if he’d known it would’ve come to this, he could’ve done his essay alone in his bed. Usually the library is a guaranteed excellent study spot, and Madame Pince lets him in at any hour because, in her words, he is One of the Good Ones. Clearly, though, today is not a day for usual.</p><p>(“Also, you’ve completely misused that phrase, you’re the one with the overly simplistic argument, not me,” he doesn’t add, though it’s pushing three a.m. and he’s feeling rather prickly and he’d very much like to.)</p><p>“And they’re always starting wars with each other-”</p><p>“Mate, look,” Cedric says. “Can we continue this discussion later? Only I’ve got two rolls of parchment left to write and it’ll be sunrise in a few hours.”</p><p>Stebbins rolls his eyes. “Fine, Mr. Social Justice. I’m done with the chapter anyway.” He stuffs parchment and book and quill unceremoniously into his bag. “Don’t get caught by Filch on your way back,” he says, by way of parting thoughts, and with a jaunty two-fingered salute, he’s gone.</p><p>“It’s not like humans don’t start wars with each other all the time,” Cedric says to Cho quietly, because despite Stebbins’ complaints, he really feels it does need to be said.</p><p>“I know,” she says, lacing her fingers through his (her nails, she told him earlier, are sunrise pink). They often hold hands, and if it isn’t her and him, then it’s her and Marietta, or her and any other of her friends. Cho must always be touching <em>somebody</em>, and Cedric doesn’t mind. He’s happy to be someone’s point of security, to say over and over with simple touch, <em>Here I am, right next to you, not going anywhere</em>.</p><p>He does worry about her, though, sometimes. They worry about each other.</p><p>“I can proofread what you have, if you like,” Cho offers, perhaps sensing that the words he’s just written look alien to him, blurring together on the page, that even the dim glow of the candles is starting to leave angry spots in his vision. He pushes what he has of his essay towards her. She might be two years younger than him, but her grammar is miles better, and she’s probably the only reason he’ll pass his OWL’s.</p><p>He sits silently and watches as flickering shadows play across her face, and maybe he can’t tell one shade of pink from another, but he can admire the way the candle flames play with the angles of her cheekbones, dance in the hollow of her throat and glance off her black hair. Cho is beautiful like a swan, irritable as one too, emotions fragile as feathers. Her eyebrows furrow as she concentrates, the corners of her mouth turning down at some of his more egregious errors.</p><p>Yeah, he still knows beauty when he sees it.</p><p>It’s almost four a.m. when Cho passes back his ruin of an essay, and they both agree that this abuse of their brains must end. They steal quietly through the hallways from shadow to shadow, though the chances of getting in trouble even if they do get caught are slim. Cedric has noticed that he’s rather immune to trouble. He tries not to abuse it.</p><p>They’re almost to Ravenclaw Tower when Cedric rounds a corner and smacks right into something invisible. A voice says “Oh God, sorry,” and suddenly Harry Potter is there, glasses askew and hair sticking up in all directions.</p><p>“Where did you come from?” Cedric asks, rather stupidly.</p><p>“Sorry,” Potter says again, then blushes when he catches sight of Cho. She smiles at him, dimpling sweetly, and Cedric watches as the dark stains on his cheeks spread. It’s rather fascinating.</p><p>“Um,” Potter says, after they’ve all stared at each other for several seconds. “I won’t say anything if you won’t?”</p><p>“Right,” Cedric hears himself reply, a little faintly.</p><p>Potter gives a sharp nod. “Right. Um. Bye, then.” And then he disappears again -and really, he’s only <em>twelve</em>, how is he <em>doing</em> that- and Cedric and Cho are alone again.</p><p>“He’s cute,” Cho says.</p><p align="center">♠</p><p>“Mate. You’re staring.” Ron jabs Harry in the ribs, jolting him to attention. Harry slides his gaze away from the Hufflepuff table, back to the egg yolk dripping over his toast.</p><p>“Sorry,” he mumbles. He picks up his fork, only to drop it immediately and let it clatter to the floor. “I just- I don’t get it! Why would he offer a rematch?”</p><p>Ron groans. “I dunno. He’s a Hufflepuff, s’what they do, innit? Fair play, and all that?”</p><p>“It was a fair win,” Harry admits, though it feels like he’s speaking around a stone in his throat. He lost a match. <em>He lost a match</em>.</p><p>“Hardly,” Hermione sniffs. “The dementors weren’t supposed to be anywhere near the pitch. If they hadn’t swarmed you, you would have won, and Cedric knows it. Not that it was his fault,” she amends, “but he’s right. It isn’t fair.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Ron adds, gesticulating forcefully with a bit of kipper, “Diggory thinks the dementors are an easy excuse for your loss. Maybe he wants to <em>know</em> he beat you.”</p><p>Hermione frowns, but clearly can’t think of a good argument, and Harry can’t, either. It makes more sense than any other explanation.</p><p>It shouldn't matter. It <em>doesn't</em>. But...it's kindness, and from a completely unexpected source. Harry doesn't even know Diggory, not really. His eyes travel back to the other boy of their own accord. They track Diggory’s gravely handsome face, try to puzzle him out like he’ll discover his motivations in the way he butters his toast.</p><p>“Maybe-” Harry starts.</p><p>“No,” Ron interrupts firmly. “It’s too early for this. We can deal with your new crush after breakfast.” He takes an enormous bite of toast to make his point.</p><p>“I don't have a <em>crush</em>,” Harry argues, and Ron and Hermione roll their eyes in perfect tandem. Harry gives up while he's behind, and doesn't mention Diggory again.</p><p align="center">♠</p><p>The flames are blue, according to Cho. They look white to Cedric, hot enough to melt his fingers, but when he goes to slip his name in, there’s only a tickling warmth.</p><p>He hesitates, hand trembling very slightly.</p><p>“Oh, go on, Cedric!” Cho half-whispers from just behind the Age Line. She gives him a winning smile that she probably thinks is charming. It is. “You know you want to.”</p><p>“I dunno,” he murmurs. “What if I make an utter fool of myself?” He can only imagine, has imagined too often: standing in front of a cheering crowd, facing a dragon or a manticore or a quintaped and freezing in his tracks, his mind wiped blank, cheers turning to catcalls and laughter as he stands there and stands there and stands there-</p><p>“Oh, rubbish,” Cho snorts, jolting him out of his daymare. “You’re the best Hogwarts has to offer, and everyone but you knows it. The Cup will pick you, and then it’s a Hogwarts victory, guaranteed.”</p><p>Cedric smiles ruefully. “Thanks, Cho. That was very stirring.”</p><p>“Anytime, dear.”</p><p>He turns back to the Cup and does the math. He doesn’t know yet whether he’s the type to freeze and run when facing danger, but he supposes if he is, the Cup will never choose him. And if it does, then that means he is the best option (well, according to an inanimate object, whose judgment Cedric doesn’t entirely trust), so he must have some kind of fighting chance.</p><p>Right?</p><p>“Cedric,” Cho says. “You do realize what time it is? Classes will let out in a moment and everyone will see you.”</p><p>Right. Decision made. Cedric tosses the slip of parchment right into the middle of the flames. Instantly, they roar higher and grow even brighter, pulsing like a heartbeat. They’re properly hot now, hot enough that he can feel his eyebrows singe. But in the next instant, they die down, go back to crackling cheerfully, as if trying to convince him that they’re completely benign.</p><p>They don’t say anything on the way back- Cedric’s still too keyed up for conversation. But Cho squeezes his hand comfortingly before wishing him good luck and disappearing into Professor Flitwick’s classroom, and Cedric walks back to Transfiguration feeling as though a bit of weight has fallen off his back.</p><p>He considers owling Dad -he can clearly picture the surprise and delight on his face- but ultimately decides against it. You know, just in case.</p><p align="center">♠</p><p>“I was telling the truth,” Harry says, already knowing it won’t do any good.</p><p>“Ah...Okay,” Diggory says, right on cue. Harry’s not a complete idiot, and Hermione is his best friend- he know what equivocation is. Classic Hufflepuff trait, and right now Harry couldn’t be more frustrated by it, because it’s not even giving someone the benefit of the doubt. It’s certainly not what he wants from the boy next to him.</p><p>They continue down the corridor in uneasy silence, footsteps echoing softly off the stone walls, gaits perfectly matched for all that Diggory is a head taller. Harry comes up with another retort with every beat:</p><p>
  <em>This is the opposite of what I wanted.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Why won’t you just say what you mean?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>What do you even care? They’ll side with you anyway. You know they will.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Just because you know my name doesn’t mean you know me.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>This was supposed to be a good year.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I’ve never had a good year.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sometimes my dreams about Cho turn into dreams about you and I have no idea what to do with that.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Why won’t you even look at me? How can you judge me when you don’t <strong>look</strong>?</em>
</p><p>They come to a fork and Diggory pauses. “Well...see you, then,” like he has no idea what else to say, and good. At least Harry’s not the only one completely mortified by this entire situation. Harry is completely and thoroughly sick of being the only humiliated one in the room.</p><p>Diggory walks away, but Harry stays put, listening to a lone pair of feet slowly dissipate down a dark hallway. His heart hurts and he both knows and doesn’t know why.</p><p align="center">♠ ♠ ♠</p>
