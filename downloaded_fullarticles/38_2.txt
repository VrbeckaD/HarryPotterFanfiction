"But I like to think that we are not always Hermione Granger or Draco Malfoy."</p><p>Her eyes squinted. "How so?"</p><p>"For example, we call this world we are in Earth one, but it could be any Earth, really."</p><p>She nodded and waited for him to continue.</p><p>"And here, I'm Draco Malfoy and you are Hermione Granger. But in earth two, you could possibly be a girl named Sam or Belle or whatever. And me, Julian or Logan or some other weird name like Rufus."</p><p>"Like Draco is not weird?"</p><p>"Well, Hermione isn't common either." he quipped.</p><p>Hermione shrugged. "Touche."</p><p>"You know, for a Muggleborn, I'd honestly think that you might be more knowledgeable about Muggle theories like the Multiverse."</p><p>"I consider myself a realist. And Science fiction never really boggled my mind."</p><p>It was odd considering magic is still much of a foreign concept in the muggle world and no more than a fantasy for them, but it's real. Yet a theory regarding parallel universes was absurd for Hermione Granger.</p><p>"But," she added, quite hesitantly. "If it were real, do you think we know each other in those other Earths?"</p><p>Draco blinked. "Maybe."</p><p>He heard her sigh.</p><p>"I'd rather not know you, to be honest. Than live in a world where we're enemies andâ€”"</p><p>She stopped to look at him. The breeze blew her hair, and the moonlight gave the crown of her head a sort of halo.
