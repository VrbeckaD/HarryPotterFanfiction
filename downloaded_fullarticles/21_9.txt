  <em> She was standing all alone, atop a cliff side, gazing down unthinkingly into the abyss of a crashing waterfall. The sight was a familiar one.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Slowly, her head raised, and from beyond the loud, rushing water streaming into sunlit air to create dazzling rainbows, she could see. She could see it.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Only her peripheral vision caught the blurry sight of a brown hand carefully weaving much larger, but well loved, fingers into her own. The action was a familiar one.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The man walking up to stand beside her did not look at her, and she did not look at him. Instead, their eyes only stayed gravitated to the horizon, and waterfall beyond. They did not look at each other, nor behind them, not even when the sunset began to flare a bright, unnatural green.  </em>
</p><p><em> The color pierced the sky, and neither knew anything further. </em> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Lily jerked awake from where she was laying on the couch, wild hands going immediately for her wand before leaf green eyes came to rest on her world, steadying her. From his spot atop her chest, her baby rested on, unworried. Harry did not stir with her beyond a light fluttering of his little lashes, and a minuscule tightening of the tiny fist that held a lock of her fiery red hair. She couldn’t help but smile warmly as she sunk back into large, downy cream cushions. </p><p>She sighed. </p><p>“That dream, again?” A low, quiet voice asked, and Lily smiled wanly. </p><p>“Yeah,” she murmured, moving a hand to rest on Harry’s back. Their child only lolled further into slumber at the calming action. James huffed a quiet laugh through his nose. </p><p>The couch at the end of her tucked legs dipped as he sat down, a book in his hands closed between his fingers. Likely, he’d seen her sleeping and had stopped reading to move to sit with her, not bothering to fold a page in lieu of just holding the thing open instead. </p><p>When Lily looked up to his face, his eyes were worried. Her smile dimmed. </p><p>James lent forward against her raised knees and placed his book- <em> Arcane Chinese Trapping Methods</em>, a recent import they’d gotten from southeast Asia- face down on the chestnut coffee table only a few feet from the plush couch. </p><p>Lily watched as he settled, placing a warm hand on her knee as his gaze dropped to their son- his eyes lit up when they reached little Harry, but the worry that clouded his vision didn’t dissipate any. If Lily were to be asked, she would have said it’d only grown. </p><p>They both stayed silent for a long moment, content to live in the brief period of peace the present offered. It didn’t last long.</p><p>“Dumbledore brought up a safe house, again,” James murmured, large dark eyebrows twitching downwards as he spoke. Lily resisted the urge to sigh. Absently, she ran her hand up and down Harry’s back from where it had been resting still. Her baby slept on. </p><p>“What did he say this time?” Lily asked, eyes raising to meet James’ brown. </p><p>He puffed out his cheeks in exasperation. “Nothing really new. Still thinks it’s the safest option, what with Scrimgeor’s reports of new Death Eater waves being met closer.” She tilted her head back against the arm of the couch. </p><p>“And what do you have to say about it?”</p><p>James snorted, and gave her a pointed look, that would be more level had he genuinely looked serious. This had become an old conversation. </p><p>“I still think Potter Manor is safer.” </p><p>Lily hummed. They let the old, same sided debate fade into quiet breathing, as had become much more often as of late. </p><p>“Has Remus written back yet?” James shook his head, and the hand on her knee tightened just a little. Lily moved her head up to lean against the couch back. If she stared long enough at his profile, she could spot a few more shadows of tired wrinkles to be. She was certain that if she looked in a mirror, her face would be the same. </p><p>“What do you want for dinner tonight?” He asked, and Lily smiled. Twirling a finger through Harry’s steadily growing raven locks, she thought for a moment. </p><p>“How’s spaghetti sound?” James leaned his head down to rest on her knees over his hand, and grinned. </p><p>“That sounds perfect. I’ll make Padfoot grab some boxed noodles from the grocer a few towns over.”</p><p>Lily pretended to balk. “James, don’t be mean, you know Sirius doesn’t know how to go through a check out aisle!” James laughed at that, a real laugh that melted her heart and reminded Lily of less tense moments from before, barely even years ago. Months, really. </p><p>“He’ll be fine- He’s bought cigarettes before.” </p><p>“Mhm, in seventh year, <em> once</em>.” </p><p>She felt James’ smile turn into a grin more than she saw. </p><p>“Does he even know what boxed spaghetti <em> looks </em>like?” </p><p>At that James laughed again, loud and warm, and Lily swatted at him with her free hand. </p><p>“Jamir Potter you evil, evil man!” </p><p>Her husband had the nerve to look completely uncowed. In his defense, Lily thought as James moved forward to brush a hand against Harry’s head, it was rather funny. </p><p>It was still funny when, almost an hour late, Sirius did indeed show up with boxed spaghetti, looking like he’d fought his life for it too. </p><p>They’d shared a warm meal, with home cooked sauce and family banter as Sirius explained that he had, in fact, gone to war for the boxed noodles- he’d fought an old muggle women for the last box on the shelf. Harry had laughed and laughed his small lungs out as Sirius had flamboyantly animated his stunning victory, despite still being too young to really understand the words. </p><p>Lily and James had done the dishes, while Sirius played with Harry in one of the closer, non formal living rooms of the manor. That night, they’d lied close to a firelit hearth and cozy blankets as they listened to new adventures Sirius had to regale about what stupid this or that the Aurour corps had gotten into, since James was currently on a leave of absence due to Harry, and hadn’t been there to experience the shenanigans first hand. </p><p>The night stayed warm and cozy, though eventually grew somber and heavy as light drinks were poured, Harry was put to bed, and friends were reminisced. The three fell asleep on the large red sofa of the back living room, close together yet missing two of their most important links.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Five months later, Dumbledore opened his mouth, and his words finally pierced faltering shields of once unbreakable will. </p><p>“I only wish the best for your family,” the man said quietly, no contempt or schemes hidden in his tone. Only a small, silent hope. A hope for survival. </p><p>James bowed his head. Lily sighed. </p><p>“You promise that this place is well hidden? That no one will find us?” </p><p>The corner of Dumbledore’s mouth twitched up in something resembling a knowing grin, a borderline smug smirk. Smug, in his confidence, in his assurance. “I do believe it to be.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The scratching of a heavy quill on thick parchment was the only sound in the early, pre-breaking dawn hours of the morning. A tired hand kept writing. Its counterpart had long gone still. </p><p>“...I don’t like this, James.” </p><p>Sirius was only met with a long, steady silence for several moments as James finished a final rune set, before moving to another. Just before he redipped his quill into the deep indigo inkpot, he met his friend, more so brother’s eyes, in weary agreement. </p><p>“Neither do I, Padfoot. But it’s safer, this way.” </p><p>Sirius was silent. </p><p>James kept writing.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“I still can’t believe you want to go through with this, Lily.” The woman in question laughed, though part of it sounded irreparably hollow. </p><p>“It’s the safest option, Sirius. James and I need to know that someone will always be around to care for Haradian if something...happens to us.” Lily pressed Harry closer to herself as she spoke, and over his shoulder, the boy gazed at him with brilliantly green eyes. His mother’s eyes. </p><p>“Blood rituals are a Black tradition though, not a Potter.” </p><p>“Well I suppose it’s a good thing I’m not a blood Potter, Padfoot.” </p><p>Sirius snorted, opening his arms to take Harry in preparation for what they were about to do. </p><p>“James is getting everything?” He asked, watching in faint amusement as Harry let the lock of Lily’s hair he always held onto slide out of his little hand, only to gently grasp a handful of Sirius’s own once he had the baby properly in his arms. </p><p>Lily nodded. In a nervous habit she had never quite dropped, she twirled the beaded, yellow and red thread woven band around her wrist, over and over. Sirius reached out until he had steadied his own hand over one of the many friendship bracelets they’d made for each other. The red and yellow, he remembered, had been made in March of their seventh year. </p><p>Lily’s eyes flicked up to meet his own. </p><p>“It’ll be okay, Lily,” he murmured, the only thing he could think to say. She looked tired. So, <em> so </em> tired. He knew they all did. War didn’t come without a price. “Just...promise me, Sirius,” she started, and Sirius curled the arm holding Harry a little tighter, a little closer to himself. “Promise me that if anything happens to us, you’ll take care of him.” </p><p>Sirius choked on his voice. Instead of speaking, he nodded, holding her hand tight. Lily gave him a sad, weary smile. </p><p>“You promise to write to us, too? And Moony?” He smiled crookedly, though it probably wasn’t as large as he wanted it to be.</p><p>“I’ll write to you <em> about </em>Moony.” </p><p>They chuckled, until weighted smiles faded. </p><p>They stayed silent, Sirius holding both Harry and Lily’s hand as they waited for James to come back with the ritual blueprints. She rested her head on his shoulder, and for a brief moment, Sirius let himself pretend that they were only waiting for James to get ready, so they could go out and meet Moony for dinner- a family night. They would laugh when James would pull on his coat inside out, and Harry wouldn’t be falling asleep in his arms. They’d get lost trying to find whatever little corner restaurant Remus had chosen for the night. </p><p>When they’d finally find him, Remus would be a little exasperated, tell both James and himself, <em> “Honestly, you two are supposed to be hit wizards,” </em>  and take Sirius’s hand in his own and kiss him hello. They would bask in a warm atmosphere instead of one anxious, and cold. Exchange stupid jokes and prided statements of what amazing little thing Harry had done that week, rather than labor over meticulously planned blood rituals and freshly banned laws. Be a family, not a broken mockery of one. </p><p>Eventually, the great doors to Potter Manor opened, and gray light from the harsh storm outside spilled into the foyer, dulling the warm golden and red tones. A man walked through the doors, shaky hands pushing them shut once he’d stepped inside. Large parchment scrolls tucked under his arms completely covered in water repelling charms complemented his thunderous eyes, and Sirius felt what little warmth of his daydream that remained, vanish. Through the downpour, James had arrived, and Sirius knew that with him, arrived change as well. </p><p>“Hey, Evans,” He murmured, squeezing her hand a little tighter, holding Harry, now asleep, a little closer. </p><p>“Hm?</p><p>“Would you? If there wasn’t a war, or death looming. Would you still do it?” </p><p>Lily lifted her head, though it must've felt a ton too heavy, to look him in the eyes. </p><p>“I would.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Peter, then.”</p><p>“...What?”</p><p>“No one will suspect him. And if we keep it quiet, no one will have a reason to.” His eyes looked almost manic. </p><p>“James, are you sure?”</p><p>“Lily, he may as well be my brother.”</p><p>Maybe, if it had been earlier in the war, she would have argued further. Maybe, if they’d been less tired, less pressed for time, less <em> scared</em>, she would have protested. </p><p>“Okay, okay. We’ll pick Peter, then.” </p><p>They picked wrong. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The night of Samhain struck twelve, and the loud thump of a lifeless body hitting the floor stood in place of a clock chime. She held her child, and ran. </p><p>The Monster followed. </p><p>A yew wand batted away her pleads and bloody palms, stole a second soul and turned to child when Mother fell. The spell was an unnatural, sickening green; a direct contrast to dulled red hair, and cooling blood.</p><p>Just before she died, all Lily Potter could think of was the Avada Kedavra sunset belonging to her dreams; and with the setting of the dreamt sun, Harry Potter was alone. </p>
