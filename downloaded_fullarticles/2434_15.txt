          <div class="userstuff"><p>It was cold. Professor Granger tried not to shiver too obviously in the staff room. Even with warming charms the diamond paned windows persisted in frosting over.</p>
<p>“Cold, are we?”</p>
<p>Snape’s voice broke smoothly into her thoughts. He had claimed with a sneer that his warming charms were superior, but just happened to be sitting by the fire, reading a newspaper.</p>
<p>His eyes glinted mockingly at her.</p>
<p>Words tumbled out of her mouth before she could stop them.</p>
<p>“I’ll be going to a beach for a holiday.”</p>
<p>“A beach.” Snape echoed.</p>
<p>“Yes. Where the air is warm and the water just the right shade of blue. It will be like summer so I can sunbathe.”</p>
<p>“Sunbathe?” Snape echoed again, but this time pink spots appeared on his pale cheeks.</p>
<p>“When was the last time you went to a beach?” she asked, curious.</p>
<p>His lips thinned.</p>
<p>“I don’t go to such places,” he said curtly, but there was a wistful note to his deep voice.</p>
<p>Hermione edged closer.</p>
<p>“We could both go… as work colleagues. Separate rooms, even,” she offered.</p>
<p>He stared at her, emotions flashing through his eyes.</p>
<p>“Separate rooms? Maybe. Perhaps. Yes,” he said then blinked.</p>
<p><i>“Perhaps</i>,” he stressed.</p>
