    <p>Draco looked over at Hermione as she gnawed on the tip of her pencil, only used to seeing her in this much of a state when exams were near - it was the space just before end of the school year where it was too early to worry about things, even for Hermione, and exams had passed so that you couldn’t worry about those either. He watched her for a few more seconds and then prodded her as one would prod a possibly dangerous, possibly affectionate animal. He wasn’t very sure what he and Hermione were at the moment. They were good friends, for definite. Draco just wanted to do all that stupid, sugar coated romance shit and take her away to a place of infinite tea and jumpers and that muggle music she liked - jizz? No, jazz…. Yeah, jazz.</p>
<p>She looked up from the grain of the oak desk they were sitting at, her honey eyes looking deep into his, the pupils getting smaller for a split second and then larger, like a refocusing camera. Another thing he had learnt off of Hermione. “Yes?” The academic girl asked, resting her chin on her palm, flexing her fingers around her jaw and looking directly into his ice blue eyes, pinning him to the ground without moving. Draco would be lying if he wasn’t a bit turned on. Then again, she could be tying her hair up and he’d still fall for her all over again.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?” He asked, the tone coming out too soft for a disgraced pureblood heir, just soft enough to be considered caring. “If you need a break from planning the meetin-” Draco had begun to propose that Hermione take a breather from her array of highlighters and ballpoint pens before she sharply interjected.</p>
<p>“No! No, I’m fine” Hermione shook her head feverently, gripping her pencil even harder and closing her eyes slightly. “I’m just under a lot of stress at the moment… and I’m practically a homeless orphan” She admitted, wanting to sink into the floor “Still fighting Ron so I can’t stay with the Weasleys. Haven’t found my folks. Think Harry’s nightmares are coming back and if they are, that means he’s sleep screaming. Means I can’t stay at his. Don’t exactly have the funds to buy a flat”</p>
<p>“You could stay with me? I’ve got a flat in London” Incorrect - Draco had not got a flat, but if Hermione needed somewhere to stay and it meant that they could live together outside of Hogwarts then he would be happy with buying a flat. Fucking hell, Granger really didn’t know what she did to him, did she? </p>
<p>A look of relief washed over her face and Draco knew he had simultaniously fucked himself and given himself a gift. “Are you sure, Draco? I’ll pay you back in full once I get a job” Hermione promised.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. We probably owe you it anyway” He shrugged it off as if it was nothing, but he was so excited. He was sharing a flat with Granger. That speckly ginger fuck might actually die of an aneurism, but that was fine.</p>
