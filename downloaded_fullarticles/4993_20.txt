  <u> </u>
</p><p>It was a Thursday evening at Hogwarts, Harry potter sat in the library alone to study potions. Harry was in his third year. He sat alone in the library because all of his friends didn’t talk to him anymore. They were mad. Last year with the Chamber of Secrets, they thought that Harry was an attention seeker and don’t forget dark. They discovered that Harry could talk to snakes.</p><p>They didn’t Take that well. Now we were the beginning of September, the beginning of the new school year. Still nobody talked to him. They were still furious. But he didn’t care. He was better off without them. A freak like him didn’t deserve friends, the Dursleys said so. Nobody wanted him anyway, so why bother.</p><p>So, there he was, sitting in the library trying to do his homework. But he couldn’t quite concentrate, he was thinking too much. He gave up. He checked his watch and saw that it was nearly curfew. He packed all his things and went to the Gryffindor tower.</p><p>Harry really didn’t like it there anymore. The whole house looked at him strange, like he was the next Dark Lord. They hex him or his belongings or his bed. He didn’t feel safe there anymore.</p><p>They attacked him once by sixth years, he ended up in the infirmary. He had three broken ribs and a concussion. Harry had to stay for a week in there. Of course, Professor McGonagall didn’t do anything. She just said it was a prank and they didn’t mean to do it.</p><p>Harry reached the common room. He walked to his bed, he put his pajama on and crept in his bed. He hoped that he didn’t get any nightmares. He just wanted to sleep.</p><p>Harry had nightmares of the Dursleys, what they did to him. He was beaten a lot. He just thought that it was normal. That he was just bad and they punished him. But that was not true. He didn’t do anything, they just enjoyed it. Just when he fell asleep one thought went through his head, he didn’t deserve to be loved.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Harry woke up with a headache, it was Friday. Just one day and then it was weekend. He crept out of his bed and saw that everybody was already gone. He frowned, normally he was the one that was up early. He checked his watch, it was already half 9. Classes started in 15 minutes. He hurried to the bathroom. He put his clothes on, picked up his backpack and ran to his next class, potions.</p><p>He ran through the corridors to the dungeons. He ran past a corner when he had to stop. In front of him stood Ron, Seamus and Dean with their wands drawn.</p><p>“Well, well, what do we have here” Ron said.</p><p>Harry tensed, ‘They are going to do something awful to me’ he thought. He said nothing only stared at them. He was too scared to do something. Fighting back didn’t help either. That was proven by the Dursleys, it only made things worse.</p><p>“well, nothing to say?” Seamus said.</p><p>Harry shook his head. They laughed.</p><p>“Look at him so weak, I don’t know how you survived the Chambers of Secrets though. But don’t worry about that. We will show you just how much we like you” Dean said while he had an evil grin on his face.</p><p>They hexed him with some nasty spells. When they were done, they kicked him some and Seamus urinated on him too. They left him there unconscious, broken and covered in blood to rot on a cold dungeon floor. What they didn’t know that they did was, that they broke a spell that was on him. A spell that changed him to his normal self, his true self.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Draco was walking to the potions classroom. When suddenly Ron, Seamus and Dean ran past him. He looked where they came from. He saw nothing, but he wanted to look anyway. He had enough time left until classes began. He walked in a corridor when a smell hit him. It smelled like urine. He walked forward until he saw somebody laying on the floor. He walked to the person and knelled beside him.</p><p>The body was full of cuts and blood. He didn’t look good at all. Draco carefully turned him over and gasped. The front was even worse than his back. What was even more shocking was, who the person was. There lying in front of him was Harry Potter.</p><p>Draco was still shocked when suddenly a bright light was around Harry. Draco pulled his hands from him and watched as Harry potter changed in someone else. When the transformation was done, the bright light was gone.</p><p>Draco stood perplexed. ‘This couldn’t be happening’ he thought. Because in front of him was no longer Harry Potter but someone else. Draco knew who this was, it was his little brother, Elias Malfoy.</p><p>His little brother who he lost 9 years ago, Elias was 1 year when he was taken from him and his family. They did everything to find him, there was just no lead, no clue.</p><p>The Malfoy family were at a park when Elias was kidnapped. Draco and Elias were playing when suddenly Elias was gone. They searched everywhere, nobody had seen anything but there was nothing.</p><p>Draco was pulled out of his thoughts from a whimper of Elias. Draco reacted immediately.</p><p>“Sssh little brother everything is going to be okay.” Draco reassured his little brother while he picked him up.</p><p>Elias was so small and thin. He weighed nothing. He ran to the infirmary. He reached it and threw the doors open. Madam Pomfrey hurried to him and ordered him to put him down on a bed.</p><p>While Madam Pomfrey stabilized Elias, he sat shocked in a chair next to the bed. He couldn’t understand it. ‘Who did this? Were it the Potters who kidnapped my little brother? I have to go get mum and dad’ Draco thought.</p><p>Madam Pomfrey walked to Draco when she was finished and said “Mr. Malfoy what happened and who is this?”.</p><p>Draco looked up and explained “Madam Pomfrey, it is complicated, I don’t understand it myself but it will try. I was walking to the potion classroom when Ron, Seamus and Dean ran past me. I didn’t trust it why they were running so I walked to where they came from. That was where I found Harry Potter I turned him around and when I touched him he changed in Elias, my little brother.” Draco stopped talking and looked at Madam Pomfrey. She smiled warmly at him and he continued “I don’t know how it can be my little brother, but he was kidnapped when I was 3 years old. And now I found that his was Harry Potter all along. I just don’t understand.”.</p><p>When he finished talking tears were streaming down his face. Madam Pomfrey handed him a hand chief and went to the fireplace, to floo the headmaster. </p>
