    <p>“I didn’t expect this place to be quite so…desolate,” Graves says, looking around, up and down the beach. There are no footprints on the sand but theirs.</p><p>“Well, I had to make sure that the eggs would be well away from predators,” Newt says. “Of course nowhere is truly safe, but at least out here there’s no people to complicate things.”</p><p>Queenie, busy taking off her shoes, spares them half a glance. “We’re people to complicate things.” She wiggles her toes in the sand.</p><p>“You know what I mean!” Newt says, tossing a shell at her. She catches it with a laugh and turns it over in her hand before tucking it in her pocket.</p><p>“Mozambique, of all places,” Jacob says. He shakes his head. “Who knew I’d end up here?”</p><p>Tina, hauling a tent out of the suitcase with Credence’s assistance, calls, “I did!”</p><p>“Stop chattering and carry your end!” Credence, still inside the suitcase, yells. Graves watches, highly amused, as Tina drags the fabric out and Credence emerges bit by bit from the suitcase. He pops out at last and, with his legs below the knee still in the suitcase, collapses melodramatically on the sand.</p><p>Squinting into the sun, Jacob points down the beach. “That big mound of sand where you buried the eggs?”</p><p>“That’s the nest,” Newt confirms. “Shall we?”</p><p>Jacob links his arm through Graves’. “Yeah, let’s go.”</p><p>Graves follows, letting the chatter wash over him. He’d forgotten just how easy this kind of easy friendship really was. Living alone with Credence has been a wonderful thing, but…this is a different kind of good. Graves is glad to be here.</p><p>The eggs are in good condition and Newt is optimistic they’ll hatch in the next fortnight. They pitch the tent at the edge of the beach. The sands are white, sliding down into calm, clear turquoise water. Inland, there’s lush vegetation, plants that Graves can’t name, whose Latin classifications rattle off Newt’s tongue. Birds, and plenty of creatures in the clear water. Eden, Credence calls it, and the name seems to fit, though Credence adds wryly that Eden never saw such a group of sinners.</p><p>Nights are clear and warm; days are hot and sunny. They pass the time freely. During the day, Newt and Queenie race each other in the calm water while Credence and Tina wander inland, looking at animals and plants, leaving Jacob and Graves to sit on the shore and philosophize. On some evenings Graves walks alone, far up the beach, enjoying the solitude, while the rest play cards and charades in the tent on the beach. One boring day Tina and Graves mock-duel on the beach; in a two-day-long rainstorm, Credence and Queenie teach everyone to sing; one day, Jacob and Newt bring back a butterfly with enormous wings that magically hypnotize the onlooker.</p><p>The rest of the world, at least for a little while, has ceased to exist. Graves finally has the time to sit down and talk for a long time with Newt, discussing Newt’s affairs and hearing about all of his myriad adventures, past and present. Credence and Jacob play catch all up and down the beach, with Jacob telling Credence about the latest baseball news from America and informing him with great excitement about the merits of Quidditch. Queenie and Tina <em>gossip</em>, sitting on the sand and tanning in stylish bathing suits, foregoing the shoes and stockings that Graves is used to seeing women wear on the beach.</p><p>It’s clear that Newt and Jacob enjoy <em>that</em> view just as much as Graves enjoys the view when Credence joins the two of them, lying shirtless on the sand with his pants rolled up to his knees.</p><p>It seems that they’ve fallen into paradise.</p><p>One evening, they light a fire on the beach and sit around it for hours. They reminisce about old times, and Newt rattles off a sonnet or two in honor of the days in Wyoming when they’d performed Shakespeare’s plays. It’s typical nostalgic camaraderie, but somehow it leaves Graves feeling unsettled tonight. He hasn’t thought much about the past, lately; things have been so good with Credence that there hasn’t been a need. But now, reflection is revealing some things that he’d rather not recall. He doesn’t remark upon it—but he knows Queenie sees it.</p><p>Tina pulls Newt and Jacob away to lie on the sand and stare up at the stars, while Credence puts his head in Graves’ lap and promptly falls asleep. Then it’s just Graves and Queenie, sitting at the fire together. Graves looks into the flames for a bit, and when he looks up Queenie is watching him.</p><p>“Do I look that melancholy?” Graves asks. He keeps his voice low, so that he won’t wake Credence and the other three—picking out constellations further up the beach—won’t hear.</p><p>Queenie smiles. “No, you just look pretty thoughtful,” she says. “You want to talk?”</p><p>Graves shrugs. “What’s there to say?”</p><p>“Whatever you want.”</p><p>For a moment, Graves genuinely stops and thinks. He hasn’t really spoken to anyone but Credence in some time now, and perhaps he’s forgotten the art a little. Isolation, while necessary, is perhaps not the healthiest choice they could have made. “It’s always difficult, standing in the shadow of the past,” Graves says.</p><p>She draws up her knees and folds her arms around them. “Yeah, I get that.”</p><p>“I feel like a different man, now,” Graves says.</p><p>“We’ve all come a long way.”</p><p>Graves shakes his head. “No. You don’t…that’s not what I meant.”</p><p>“What did you mean?” Queenie asks. Her eyes are big and bright in the firelight; her hair, shorter now than Graves has ever seen it, shines coppery gold.</p><p>For a moment, they’re both silent. Graves needs to say this correctly. He doesn’t even really know what he wants to say. He’d rather listen to the sound of Jacob and Newt heckling Tina as she tries to teach them basic Astrology, or the sound of the waves on the sand.</p><p>“I mean,” he says at last, “that I’m not the man I was before Grindelwald.”</p><p>“Of course you ain’t,” Queenie murmurs. “He took you apart, honey.”</p><p>Graves feels it like a punch to the chest. “I know,” he says, thinking of all his scars. Credence could have healed many of them, but Graves somehow still wants them. Wants the reminder of what had been, of what had happened to him. He knows what it is to be taken apart.</p><p>“I mean he took you apart inside,” Queenie says. She rises and comes around the fire to sit down beside him. She rests her hand over Graves’ heart. “And you had to put yourself back together on your own. Ain’t your fault the pieces didn’t fit the same way again.”</p><p>He doesn’t answer, but puts an arm around her shoulders. She hums and snuggles closer. An ache that Graves didn’t know he was carrying subsides a little. He knows that he isn’t well, that he may never be truly well again. But just now, he knows for certain that this is enough. Here, with all his strange family safe, he can simply <em>be</em>. And that is more than enough.</p><p>The Labbu eggs hatch fifteen days after their arrival. The sand begins to shift as the sun starts to set, and they all move to hover around within watching distance. Newt won’t allow a light, since other lights might confuse the babies as they tried to reach the water. When the first baby emerges, it’s obvious that they wouldn’t have needed a light anyway.</p><p>A small silvery creature, nearly transparent, wriggles free of the sand, bursting out into the starlight. It has the same body plan as its parent, almost eel-like, but isn’t even as long as Graves’ forearm. Its arms are vestigial, its eyes too big for its head, and its teeth seem to be of a piece with its skull. And it glows: the same electric blue that it had in its egg.</p><p>It flops ungracefully down the mound and wriggles toward the water. It hasn’t gone four feet before a second and a third break from the sand. Graves watches them with bated breath: the first baby reaches the calm edge of the water and slides in. The second that it sinks into the water, it changes from an ungainly thing to a lithe and graceful creature, shooting off in a glowing blue streak into the darkness.</p><p>Each is a glowing blue creature, like blown glass come to life, and the sight is hypnotic. It’s hard to believe that these fragile, beautiful little creatures will become the titanic Labbu that they’d met those years ago in Lake Michigan, but so it is. In the dark sand and water, they’re as bright as flashing neon, but so much more beautiful.</p><p>“Only sixteen,” Newt murmurs, after the last baby has slipped from the collapsed sandy nest and gone into the water. “One of the eggs must not have been viable.”</p><p>“Oh no,” Credence says softly. “Is there anything to be done?”</p><p>“That’s the way of things,” Newt says. “With seventeen eggs, most of them will hatch. Two or three of the babies will grow to adulthood. Labbu live so long that they’ll find a mate for certain, and the cycle repeats. Nothing ends.”</p><p>Graves watches the flat, dark surface of the water, where the Labbu have vanished, and wonders which of the babies will make it. He can hope, of course, that they all will: but there are sharks and merfolk and fishermen out there in the sea. The odds are not in their favor.</p><p>“I hope they all make it,” Jacob says fiercely. “Sixteen Labbu, out there in the ocean. Imagine it!”</p><p>“I will,” Newt says. “But you and I won’t be around, by the time that they’re fully grown. They take a century to mature, and we’ll only see them if we’re really lucky, and live a long time.”</p><p>For a while, the six of them simply stand and watch the water, and wonder.</p><p>The very next morning, they pack up.</p><p>“It’s a long trip north,” Tina informs the rest. “We’ve got to go to Egypt, of all places.”</p><p>“The last time I was there, I stole a Thunderbird,” Newt says cheerfully, folding up the tent. “This time I heard rumors of someone breeding Serpopards. Classification quadruple-X! We’ll probably have to take them and run…”</p><p>Graves sighs, and prepares himself for the return of worry. “Please. Please do not turn us into wanted fugitives again. It will be hard enough going unnoticed as it is.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, honey,” Queenie says, taking his hand. “We’re all together. Nothing will go wrong!”</p><p>“Yeah, what she said,” Jacob says. “It’ll be an adventure!”</p><p>“Besides,” Newt says, “I have permits from the Egyptian Ministry. As long as I register my presence and call for Auror support, they won’t mind me trying to take care of the creatures.”</p><p>Credence smiles, bright and beautiful. “I, for one, can’t wait!”</p><p>To Graves’ surprise, neither can he. Looking at them all, at Newt with the infamous suitcase in one hand and Tina’s hand in his other, at Tina with her freckled skin and confident stance, at Jacob with his smile and sleeves rolled up for action, at Queenie with her daring grin and bright eyes, at Credence with his squared shoulders and wand in his pocket…it’s easy to believe that this will go right. That this adventure will be for the better.</p><p>They’re all together again, and that is exactly how things should be.</p>
