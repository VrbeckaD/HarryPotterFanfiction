          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco didn't have to open their front door to smell roasting chestnuts; he'd thought as he got closer to home that it must have carried from the seller on the corner. He'd passed by a few times, but always in a rush. It was a nice little cart, decorated with holly, and he had wanted to stop. He loved roasted chestnuts in the winter; it always reminded him of being a child and going shopping with his mother. There was a faithful seller at her favorite book shop and she always got him a bag as a treat at the end of the day.</p><p>He smiled and opened the front door. "I'm home!"</p><p>"Welcome home!" Harry called. He was dressed in a sweater and jeans, tending to the fire. A bowl of chestnuts was set on a hook, kept warm.</p><p>All of the day's stress melted away. Draco took off his shoes and coat, left his bag on the floor. "You got some?"</p><p>Harry grinned and picked up a bundle of holly. "And I got you these. I know they're not flowers, but the florist said that at this time of year, holly represents eternal things."</p><p>Draco laughed. "Like our love?"</p><p>Harry nodded. "I know you've been overworked lately so I wanted to cheer you up."</p><p>Draco crossed the room and Harry stood up to meet him. Draco kissed him, once, and took the holly branches. "Thank you, Harry."</p><p>Harry kissed him again and Draco let everything else go. He was home and Harry had gotten him things to make him happy. What more did he need?</p></div>
