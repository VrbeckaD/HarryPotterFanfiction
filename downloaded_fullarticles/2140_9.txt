    <p>A young man with neat blond hair sprinted across the street headed straight for a bar. Hanging on the door were many posters advertising various shampoos (Scourgify in liquid form!) or some concert or another (Oh, would you look at that; the Weird Sisters are having a concert tomorrow!); but what stood out to most eyes was the bounty poster, the same one was hung on every lamp post, every door, and every bulletin board.</p>

</p>
<p>A sigh fell from light pink lips as the blond scurried into the bar. The young man sat down on a wobbly bar stool and waved the bar tender over.</p>
<p>“Blishen’s Firewhiskey on the rocks, please,” he ordered. The bar tender nodded and sauntered away to the back until he was out of sight. A pale head down to rest on equally pale arms with another hefty sigh; go he hated his life, maybe Firewhiskey would take the nerves down a notch.</p>
<p>“Why, hello! I didn’t expect to see you here, Malfoy!” an overly cherry and obviously drunk voice exclaimed right next to his ear. Stormy grey eyes moved to the side to see a dark skinned man with a light blush coating his cheeks like frosting. Who was he again? He was sure he had talked to him once in school… Luckily the bartender came back to set his Firewhiskey down in front of him before he had to come up with a reply of any sort.</p>
<p>He took a sip from the tumbler before him, enjoying the fire that ignited as it ran down his throat.</p>
<p>“Malfoy, did you hear? There’s going to be a full moon tonight! You better watch out for them Undesirables; especially that scar head, he might report you to the old coot! But wait, the old man’s deader than a doornail!” the dark skinned man – Zabini? – laughed violently. Then, just as another delightful flame rushed down his throat, the young man’s words struck him like a ton of bricks.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to go, Zaaabiiini…. Catch you later,” Malfoy dragged out the name in uncertainty before walking out of the Leaky Cauldron with as much poise as he could pull off in his panicked state.</p>
<p>He had only just ducked into an alley and taken a swig of a repulsive potion that smoked faintly when his eyes widened and his ears seemed to pull back allowing them to grown pointed, and letting hair take their original place like weeds growing in a garden. Pale fingers gained a dark smattering of hair and nails elongated into sharp claws. Long screams of agony turned to howls of pain. The hairy body fell with a thud to the damp ground and twitched about like it was a fish out of water. When the minor seizure stopped, bright green eyes opened wide, turning, searching in the darkness that devoured everything else.</p>
<p>He broke out into a run.</p>
<p>He was starved.</p>
<p>His prey would not easily escape him this time.</p>
<p>A cave was nearing in his heightened vision, a cold looking place, with ragged stalagmites protruding from the rough ground, only smoothed in places with reflective puddles. No light entered despite the moon’s relevant position to the opening. It would be described as rather ominous if one were to ask; but not to the wolfish man running at it. No, to him it was a home he would find nowhere else.</p>
<p>The dark furred being broke through the curtain of darkness that hung just outside like a waterfall, and clamored inside where it was bright and burned his eyes. He moved about the inside, furniture that could be found in the home of a rich man was sitting nicely; completely symmetrical to what was on either side of it. That was, of course, if you didn’t look at the scratches on the arms too hard or the fluff that was coming out of the corner of one of the throw pillows on the floor. Or maybe if you simply over looked the peeling wallpaper that was crudely covering the rugged wall, maybe if you could turn a blind eye on the scrapes and gashes and blemishes on the closet doors or the in the coarse carpet under your feet, then this would be a fine home in your eyes. Still, it was perfect for the man who had just come barreling in.</p>
<p>Bangs were coming from the other side of the closet door that you were meant to overlook. The young man stalked over and opened it just a crack. That was all it took for the weight on the other side to come out and push the poor man to the floor. The breathing of the creature on top of him was as ragged as the walls, and vicious red eyes were unfocused but predatory.</p>
<p>The strangled word “Tom…” fell from the lips of the one underneath the beast, an obvious protest to the massive weight above him. A great paw-like hand came out and covered his muzzle. The smaller body struggled against it, a silent plead for breath.</p>
<p>“Do not call me that name!” was growled out. Of course, of course, he should have remembered that. Tom was especially irritable during a full moon in December. The paw was removed and a large gasp was heard.</p>
<p>“Come on, my great Lord Voldemort, my boredom is overwhelming!” the small one exclaimed. Voldemort gave a wolf like sigh but nodded.</p>
<p>“Fine, of course, Harry. Anything for you.”</p>
<p>And so they played the night away, the way only animals acting purely on instinct could.</p>
<p>It was when the sun finally broke past the wall of darkness hiding them from the world they awoke.</p>
<p>The small body of Undesirable No. 1 wriggled on the uneven ground, ignoring the new scratches on the once posh couch, and snuggled farther into the larger body next to him. The other, obviously none other than Undesirable No.2, wrapped his arms around the shifting body in an attempt to still him before they both fell asleep once more.</p>
