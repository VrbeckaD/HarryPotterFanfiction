          <div class="userstuff"><p>I. Odi</p>
<p>He remembers the first time he saw her. <br/>Brown unruly hair and tan skin. <br/>Freckles and wide brown eyes.<br/>A book between her tiny hands clutched firmly to her chest.<br/>A shield.<br/>He remembers thinking that maybe he should introduce himself.<br/>Maybe he could ask her to sit with him and his friends on the train.<br/>Maybe…<br/>The train whistle calls them to board and he loses sight of her in the crush.<br/>It wasn’t until later that he learns of her true origins.<br/>Disgust and self loathing burn hot in his belly as he realizes what he almost did.<br/>He will never make that mistake again.</p>
<p>II. Amo</p>
<p>He almost remembers when his feelings became… more?<br/>Is more the right term in which to explain what he thinks of her?<br/>They had been paired in a class.<br/>In most of their classes, actually. <br/>He found out that they both shared a voracious appetite for knowledge and he wasn’t sure if he liked that shared trait.<br/>Some last ditch attempt by the staff at unity but that sentiment had died long ago.<br/>He wondered  if at some point the staff understood that they were desecrating a corpse but simply did not care.<br/>He remembers muttering that sentiment to himself and was surprised to hear a laugh.<br/>He can’t remember anything else about that class or project.<br/>But what he does remember is a quiet laugh and a quick upturn of lips.<br/>Sparkling eyes and rosy cheeks.</p>
<p>That night he stared at his bruised hands.<br/>Bruises like ink spilling over his pale skin.<br/>Dark and stagnant and he thinks of her.<br/>He curls his hand into a fist and finally drives a hole through the top of his trunk.<br/>He wakes in the morning to bloody fingerprints on his sheets and his skin.<br/>When he sees her again, he wonders if she can see the stain she left on him.</p>
<p>III. Quare id faciam, fortasse requiris? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He couldn’t remember a time when he didn’t see.<br/>He saw her.<br/>He saw everything.<br/>And it made him want to claw his eyes out.<br/>He had buried himself deep in the ground.<br/>In courses. <br/>In others.<br/>But all he saw was her.<br/>Her in the sunshine.<br/>Her in the library.<br/>Her.<br/>If anyone were to ask...</p>
<p>IV. Nescio</p>
<p>“What do you think of her?”</p>
<p>[unsent letter] ...I have hated and killed you a thousand times and yet you still remain. Have I finally succumbed to the madness of my mother’s line? I wish that was the case. I wish I had never seen you on that platform...</p>
<p>[torn piece of parchment] You have left a mark on my soul and I can feel it clawing its way through my lungs. </p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>[a whisper in the cold night, cold bloody fingers tracing x’s over his heart, scent of perfume all wrong all wrong lingering in the air] I am yours...</p>
<p>V. Sed fierei sentio et…</p>
<p>She had rooted herself so firmly that by the time the world crashed around his ears she was the only thing left.<br/>In the early hours before the horrors woke from their slumber, he finally thinks of her.<br/>He had feared that just the thought of her would break him.<br/>Shatter him into a thousand pieces and then those pieces would continue to break until there was nothing left of him but dust.<br/>He tries to remember her scent and the way the light bends around her.<br/>He tries to remember her laugh and her smile.<br/>The only thing he remembers is her eyes.</p>
<p>Later it is her screams, her blood, her tears that will haunt him for his cowardice.</p>
<p>Her memory is tainted now.</p>
<p>VI. Excrucior</p>
<p>It was over.<br/>Finally over.<br/>And he watched as she jumped into the arms of another and kissed him.<br/>He knew then that fate had a cruel sense of humor.</p>
<p>VII. Vivamus...</p>
<p>Time and distance.<br/>That’s what his healer had said.<br/>So he took the train as far as it went and settled.<br/>His mother wrote to him often.<br/>He avoided the newspapers.<br/>If asked he would say it was because he didn’t want to see any articles about him.<br/>Death Eater scum turned Hero.<br/>In a way it was partially true.<br/>Mostly he did not want to see her.</p>
<p>Two years passed before he saw her again.<br/>She was standing outside the gate of his cottage.<br/>He stares at her through the gaps in his blinds.</p>
<p>[Is she here for him?]</p>
<p>She still pulls at him.<br/>He still thinks of her in the night.<br/>His memories and dreams of her have lost their frenzied edge.<br/>Softened by time and perspective.<br/>He sees her now.<br/>He sees all of her.</p>
<p>[whispered breath in the cold air: I am still yours. If you’ll have me. I am yours.]</p>
<p>He makes a decision.<br/>And opens the door.</p></div>
