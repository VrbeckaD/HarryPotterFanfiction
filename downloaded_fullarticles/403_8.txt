    <p>Brit looked at the letter the crazy owl dropped into his lap. The letter felt weird. He used the skills he learned from his two snakes to checked the letter out. He usually did so anyway but this one really felt weird. He got rid of all the little charms on the letter, crossed out the name Harry Potter. He wrote Britannicus Peverell above Harry Potter. Just like he had been instructed to do. He had another letter sitting on the desk but this was the one he had been warned about. He turned the letter over and saw the seal.</p><p>~It arrived?~</p><p>~Yes, Tom, it did. Nagini was looking for you.~ </p><p>~I saw her. Did it say Harry Potter?~</p><p>~Yes, already fixed it and removed the charms. I was about to open it.~ Brit opened the letter as Tom slithered up his leg and settled around his neck to read the letter.</p><p>HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY</p><p>Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore<br/>

Chief Attendant of Witchcraft Provisions</p><p>~Interesting they removed snakes. Lousy book list too.~ Tom hissed. ~You read all those two or three years ago.~</p><p>~Wonder how it got addressed to Harry Potter?~</p><p>~He might have had it handwritten out. It shouldn't have.~</p><p>They heard the floo sound. A few minutes later, Severus stepped into the room. He bowed. "My Prince, I see you got the letter."</p><p>"Yes, it was even addressed to Harry Potter." Brit handed the letter to Severus. ~Tom, go and smack him for me.~</p><p>~You know why he does it.~</p><p>~I know, so formal.~</p><p>"Dumbledore has been sitting in Minerva's office for days. Since no one can see the addresses of the envelopes and the elves deliver them, he has been waiting for an answer from Potter. When none came, he actually sent a few directly to your former relatives' house. When that didn't work he just sent a generic address one." Severus ignored the hissing. He knew Brit most likely told his Lord to smack him for his formality. He hid his enjoyment of seeing his friend's son annoyance.</p><p>"That explained the envelope. It was covered in spells. I removed them as I was taught."</p><p>"Good. Did you eat your lunch?"</p><p>"Yes. Severus, do you think he will know?"</p><p>Severus knew Brit had been worried about Dumbledore getting his hands on him. It had taken a few years to get the boy enough confidence in himself. Tom and Nagini had found Harry Potter at the Dursley home so beaten that if Tom hadn't been able to summon Severus the boy would have died. "No, you don't look like Potter. The scar is gone. Dumbledore won't suspect a thing. You have been in Diagon Alley and no one recognized you."</p><p>"True. I just don't trust him." Brit sighed. It was going to be a long seven years unless he could test out early but that would only knock off two years.</p><p>"I don't either." Severus knew that Tom and Nagini would protect Brit. "Go and get your assignments, I want to review them." Tom slithered over to Severus. "My Lord, I do believe it's time to get you a body." Tom nodded yes. "I will speak to Lucius. He invited Brit to stay at Malfoy Manor overnight on the 31st so that he could take the boys to the station."</p>
