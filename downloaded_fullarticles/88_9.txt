    <p>“Thi<b>s </b> i<b>s </b> the la<strong>s</strong><strong>t </strong>time I’ll a<b>s</b>k, <b>S</b>everu<b>s</b>,” Lord Voldemort growled at his spy, his anger causing him to drag the ‘s’ in every word he said. Lord Voldemort brought up his snake-faced glamour, knowing that that particular glamour scared his followers into complying with his orders more than enough times.</p><p> </p><p>For once, his spy didn’t hide his emotions, his own fear clear on his face. “Please, My Lord, don’t make me do this,” Severus nearly begged, his tone desperate. </p><p> </p><p>Voldemort snarled, and that was what broke Severus’ resolve. The spy shuddered and dropped every single glamour and concealment charm he wore, finally revealing himself to his Lord and Dominant mate. </p><p> </p><p>Gone was the greasy hair, sallow skin, and crooked nose that the population of Hogwarts students like to make fun of. Instead, soft and silky hair reached Severus’ back as was traditional of Submissives, his skin a pale, smooth alabaster that made his dark eyes stand out, and his nose, although a bit long, was normal and pretty and matched his face beautifully. </p><p> </p><p>However, that was not what Voldemort was looking for. No, he instead focused on the spy’s lovely scent, further confirming his suspicions:</p><p> </p><p>Severus Snape was <em> his </em>Submissive, and Severus had hidden himself from his Dominant knowing fully well that Voldemort was searching for his mate. </p><p> </p><p>“Into my private room<b>s</b>,” Voldemort finally hissed after inhaling more of the delicious scent, watching as his mate nearly ran. </p><p> </p><p>He wanted to go after his errant Submissive right away, but he knew that he had to calm himself down first so that he wouldn’t end up hurting Severus during his punishment and cause his mate to be even more scared and terrified of him.</p><p> </p><p>Sighing, Voldemort went to take a walk throughout Riddle Manor. </p><p> </p><p align="center">+++ </p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <em> Two hours later:  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Severus thrashed as Voldemort delivered the last swats of his punishment, tears streaming down his cheeks and his face flushed red. </p><p> </p><p>Fifty swats, that’s how many Voldemort forced him through with a riding crop. And yes, Severus said forced because that’s what it was when you are a Submissive. You have next to no rights the very second your Dominant recognizes you as their property. </p><p> </p><p>Those restricting laws were what made Severus wear that ugly glamour and the many concealment charms for so long, and even then he still ended getting exposed due to none other than Peter Pettigrew, the same filthy rat Animagus that had been hiding in his room when he dropped only the glamour and then ran to their Lord to tattle on him. </p><p> </p><p>And just his bloody luck that Severus was that monster’s Submissive. </p><p> </p><p>Severus opened his mouth to grovel and apologise to his Lord, only to realize that Voldemort had already cast the charm that made him silent unless his Dominant wished him to be vocal. The charm made talking impossible, only allowing him to make some quiet noises. </p><p> </p><p>He whimpered, flinching when Voldemort began patting his burning backside. “My Submissive won’t pull a stunt like this ever again, will he?” The Dark Lord asked idly, never stopping his patting even though Severus twisted this and that way to get away from the pain.</p><p> </p><p>Severus shook his head and his mouth moved silently, slumping on the gigantic bed in relief as his Dominant finally released him from his position. He trembled, his limbs heavy and his body a sweaty mess on the silk sheets. </p><p> </p><p>He was then repositioned so that he was laying on his side, his Dominant near him. Voldemort had dropped his own glamour again, the only thing connecting him to said glamour being his red eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“You shall address me as either Master or Domine from now on, my pet,” <em> Master </em>said, wandlessly and non-verbally casting a Cooling Charm on his Submissive, and then casting a Scourgify to clean him from the sweat. </p><p> </p><p>Severus tried to say ‘yes, Master,’ but remembering the Silencing Charm he had no choice but to nod his head, his eyes lowered so that he wouldn’t disrespect his Dominant and get another punishment so soon. </p><p> </p><p>“Look at me, pet,” Master ordered. When Severus did so, he continued talking. “Normally a newly mated Submissive will be kept in their Dominant’s place for two months, but <em> you, </em> after we mate, will stay here in my Manor for the next <em> three </em>months, dear Severus,</p><p> </p><p>Severus flushed in unwanted shame and whined, cutting the noise off as soon as he could. Still, he did not miss the dangerous predatory glint in his Master’s eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“As for the Silencing Charm, I will only remove it if you’ve been exceptionally good and during special occasions.” </p><p> </p><p>At hearing this, Severus felt his heart clench in fear. <em> Will I ever be good enough for such a privilege?  </em></p><p> </p><p>Seeing his fear, Master ran a hand through Severus’ hair and hummed. “Don’t worry, pet,” he said. “Just be on your best behavior and you won’t have to deal with the Charm.” </p><p> </p><p>It did not comfort him. </p><p> </p><p align="center">+++ </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
  <em> Two weeks later:  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Master, please,” Severus begged, struggling against the restraints that kept him tied to the spanking bench in the Playroom. His body was heated to an unbelievable point and yet all his mind could focus on was the sharp ache in his groin. </p><p> </p><p>All the results of a charm that his Master had cast on him. </p><p> </p><p>“Beg more, my pet,” Master purred, trailing his fingers along Severus’s naked thighs to collect the slick dripping from the rosebud that he loved playing with. </p><p> </p><p>Severus bucked against the restraints. “Let me cum, Master,<em> please </em>!” He cried out, desperation in his glazed eyes. His cock was rock hard, pre-cum collecting at his slit. Even the tight, leather ring around his cock and balls felt too hot and painful. </p><p> </p><p>“I want to, my dear pet,” Severus sighed in relief, only to jolt and cry out at what Master said next: “But unfortunately I have a meeting to attend–” </p><p> </p><p>“No, no,” Severus mumbled to himself. </p><p> </p><p>“But no worries, pet, I shall leave you with a gift.” And then, something small but cold slipped inside of him, buzzing to life immediately and making Severus gasp loudly. </p><p> </p><p>“Have fun, dear,” Master laughed, and then left him all alone in the Playroom. </p><p> </p><p align="center">+++</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
  <em> After two months:  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“You will stay like this unless I say otherwise,” Master said coldly, tightening the ropes around Severus’ wrists. </p><p> </p><p>His Submissive flinched and nodded from where he was kneeling on the floor, mouth opened to accept his Master’s cock. The Silencing Charm, of course, was once more on him. </p><p> </p><p>After making sure that his cock won’t slip out, Master went back to reading the reports that the Death Eaters delivered him, not even paying an ounce of attention to his Submissive. </p><p> </p><p>It was a punishment, after all. And all good Dominants had to punish their Submissives for any rule breaking. </p><p> </p>
