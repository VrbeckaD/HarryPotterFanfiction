"No silly, you can't visit my family during a full moon."</p><p>Fenrir said, "Why not? It might make them like me."</p><p>Daphne stated, "Don't be ridiculous and they do like you."</p><p>Fenrir replied, "If you say so, by the way I have an idea."</p><p>Daphne asked, "What?"</p><p>Fenrir told her, "I think that if I stay on my best behaviour in front of your family then maybe just possibly you would consider becoming a werewolf."</p><p>Daphne gasped. "What?"</p><p>Fenrir sighed. "I know it will be a hard decision for you to make, but please think of me when you make it."</p><p>Daphne frowned. "I love you more than anything Fen, but I don't think I want to give up my humanity just yet."</p><p>Fenrir smiled. "So you will eventually join me?"</p><p>Daphne beamed, "Of course."</p></div>
