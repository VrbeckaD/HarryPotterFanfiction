    <p>Hermione prepared supper for her and Severus, singing various songs while gathering ingredients in the kitchen.</p><p>Severus heard her bustling, fixing their dinner.  He recognized some of the lyrics while she was setting up the table.</p><p>"Dinner's ready!" Hermione called out to her husband.</p><p>Severus was impressed with Hermione's decoration ability.  She had it decorated with Slytherin colors, red candles lit, music playing softly in the air as their plates were set across from each other. Food in the middle waiting to be eating.  And a glass of red wine.</p><p>They sat down, and he started to serve the meal when a song he was familiar with came on. "Stand by me." </p><p>"Severus, are you alright?"  she grasped her husband's hand when he was going to pass her a roll.</p><p>"This song reminds me of my spying days, dear.  The lyrics remind me of how tough some days could be. I'm just as glad that you are by my side."</p><p>Hermione smiled. "Of course, I support you! You don't know how many times I've played this song to make Ronald cringe every time it came on!"</p><p>Severus chuckled. "I would've loved to have seen that!"</p><p>"We've got dinner with the Weasley's tomorrow night. I can plan this as a surprise for Harry's birthday party! Molly would definitely go for it!"</p><p>"Dinner at the Weasley's?"</p><p>Severus remembered what day it was. As it was nearing the end of the school week.  He felt like the song was love in the air.  When it ended, he frowned as the next song came on.<br/>"Please, play that again, Hermione." </p><p>Hermione grinned as she pressed the repeat button for "Stand By Me"  "This song is quite catchy.  Careful, you won't be humming or whistling during class tomorrow?"</p><p>Severus smirked.  He made Hermione repeat the song at least ten more times before they retire for the night.</p><p>The next morning….Hermione woke up hearing Severus mumbling in his sleep. She listened carefully to what he was mumbling too and smiled. <i> I knew that song will be stuck in his head all day!</i></p><p>Quietly getting out of bed, Hermione started singing the song to herself in the shower.  She got ready for the day when Severus was waking up well.  "Hermione, did I mumble the song in my sleep?" he licked his lips when reaching for his glass of water.</p><p>"Of course you did, dear!" she replied, kissing him on the cheek. "See you tonight!"</p><p>Severus smiled and began to prepare for his day.<br/>==</p><p>Severus Snape whistled to the tune to "Stand by Me" as he placed his potions ingredients in order, for the next class.  <i> Why am I whistling to this tune? I know why…</i>  He wiped the sweat off his brow, climbed down the ladder.  One last look at his work, feeling satisfied, he started humming the tune.</p><p>He gathered his lesson for the class, tune still in the back of his mind.  Severus remembered the supper he shared with his wife last night as she played some favorite songs of hers.</p><p>Severus shook his head,<i> I even suggested playing this particular one. Because it reminded me of my spying days.</i></p><p>As students started to pile in. They noticed their Professor was not his usual self.</p>
