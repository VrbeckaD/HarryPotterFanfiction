          <div class="userstuff"><p>Down, down, down.</p>
<p>You're not sure it's possible to fall any further. </p>
<p>You like it, though.</p>
<p>It's soft and peaceful here, just falling. </p>
<p>Faces and landscapes blur past, not long enough for you to lock on to. </p>
<p>Something tugs at the edges. Like a memory. </p>
<p>
  <em>Remember when…</em>
</p>
<p>Her voice is familiar. You relax into the memory. Of a wedding. She's describing someone's wedding. It sounds so beautiful, just the way you'd have liked it. Lilies and laughter and love. Her words are warm and cleansing. </p>
<p>She quietens and you think about books and wards and dittany. Effortless spell-motion and almond oil shampoo.</p>
<p>
  <em>Remember you and he used to…</em>
</p>
<p>She's talking again. Not a memory. A fable. An unlikely tale of two stubborn boys; not enemies, just lost. </p>
<p>There's someone else. Making a soft noise. A laugh? A sob? The sound claws at your heart.</p>
<p>
  <em>Remember how you…</em>
</p>
<p>Another story. Of forgiveness, of friendship. Of a partnership. Aurors: you know that word.</p>
<p>Someone’s mumbling. </p>
<p>You try to open your eyes but nothing happens. </p>
<p>I'm here, you say, I'm still here. But the words don't come.</p>
<p>You reach for your magic, and it's not where it usually is; there, coiled in your core. Vibrating with potential, ready for you to draw on it. Only whiteness. Calm. Too quiet. </p>
<p>
  <em>I remember.</em>
</p>
<p>A man's voice. Low and sad.</p>
<p>The sterile, uneasy smell of disinfectant.</p>
<p>A rush of sensations: slender fingers; cold words; hot tongues; tea, fragrant and strong; pale eyelashes against your cheek; leather and clary sage; green woollen socks.</p>
<p>And you remember this man. This love.</p>
<p>You’ve stopped falling now. </p>
<p><em>I'll never forget</em>, he says.</p></div>
