    <p>i.<br/>Although he knows that he should think of Number 4, Privet Drive as home, home is where the heart is, and walking into the red and gold common room, Harry realised that this was what coming home truly felt like.</p><p></p><div>
  <p>Looking around at the squashy red armchairs and the bright red tapestries scattered around the common room, Harry felt his shoulders finally loosen as he allowed Ron and Hermione lead him towards their chairs by the roaring fireplace.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>It was in this room, in all its red splendour where Harry learnt the true meaning of family. He was surrounded by the bright Gryffindor red when he first learnt to play chess with Ron, when he rushed his potions essays, and when he listened to his two best friends bicker and laugh together as they grew up, side by side.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Red meant house pride, red meant comfort, and red meant home.<span> </span></p>

  <p>ii. <br/> It was chaos.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>People were screaming, they were crying, shouting, laughing as spells were thrown around, as bodies fell to the ground or moved onto their next opponent, momentarily victorious in their battles.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>With Hogwarts as the backdrop, Harry watched as a student fired a red disarming spell at a cackling figure in black, only to be hit by the sickly red of the cruciatus, <em>screaming</em>, thrashing in jerky movements, until her torturer finally moved on to fire that ugly red at another defender of Hogwarts.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>The ground was stained with the dark red of blood, bodies of death eaters and teachers and aurors and students alike strewn across the lawn, and wasn't it funny, Harry idly thought, that he couldn't tell the difference between the pure blood of the death eaters and the 'dirty' blood of all the half bloods and muggleborns, when it was spilt onto the ground. </p>
  <p>When Harry finally stood opposite Voldemort, staring into those deadly bright red eyes, he knew that this was his only chance of stopping him, of ending the war and making sure that the grass of Hogwarts would never be stained red again.</p>
  <p>After it was all over, he didn't think he ever wanted to see the red of pain, suffering, and death ever again. </p>
