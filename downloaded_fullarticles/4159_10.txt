    <p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>It was a crisp winter afternoon only two weeks before Christmas. James, Albus, and Lily Potter arrived at home just coming from Hogwarts. </p>
<p>James the oldest was in Gryffindor he was a sixth year. Albus the middle child was in Slytherin and the only one in his family to be in it, he was a fifth year. Lily the youngest was in Ravenclaw and in her fourth year.</p>
<p>As far as Albus could tell something was very wrong there was a weird feeling in the air. His father was acting very strange and seemed tired.</p>
<p>“So when's mom supposed to get here?“ Lily asked from her spot, hanging upside down on the armchair in the living room.</p>
<p>“She should be here any minute.“ Their father Harry answered from the kitchen where he was preparing lunch. Albus sat next to James on the couch across from a very bored Lily. Several long minutes later the doorbell went off. Lily was the first one there to greet mother followed by James and then Albus.</p>
<p>Albus couldn't help but notice the way his father was standing in the kitchen doorway, he didn't move from the spot and was creating a distance between him and Ginny.</p>
<p>In the past years he had always been just as anxious as Lily to see their mother and his wife, to greet her with a passionate kiss. But now he looked like a kicked puppy that just wanted to be loved. Something was very wrong. This coupled with mother sudden disappearance. “It was work-related” Albus was told when he questioned it. Albus was sure something was about to happen. Something big?</p>
<p>After she had hugged both her younger and oldest children quite fiercely Ginny couldn't help but feel a little guilty seeing her younger son stand back, looking at her as if he couldn't comprehend her very presence here as if he could already sense what was coming. </p>
<p>“Well get over here!” The redhead exclaimed to her youngest son, she tried to hold him tightly to put all of her love for him into that to try and explain herself in that hug. After a few seconds he wiggled out of her arms, giving her a big smile but it was fake.</p>
<p>“Well… dinners ready.” Harry announced his voice sounding depressed like it had been let down in the worst way possible.</p>
<p>“I think we should talk first.” Ginny said holding onto Lily's shoulders, Harry only nodded. Ginny sat on the armrest with Harry next to her. Lily was seated on the couch in between her brothers. James had his arms wrapped around her shoulders but he was watching their father.</p>
<p>“Me and your father are getting a divorce.” Ginny stated trying to keep her voice even. </p>
<p>“Why? What's wrong?“ Lily blurted out her anxiety building up. </p>
<p>“Things aren't working out between us but it's nothing you need to worry about. All you need to know is that both your mother and I love you and we always will.” Harry kneeled down to her level and looked at all his children.</p>
<p>“We will always love you, no matter what happened between your father and I.“ Albus just nodded but James threw himself into his father's arms and then his mother's.</p>
<p>“I love too!“ Harry held his eldest son close to him. Ginny did the same to Lily and then James, Ginny placed her hand on Albus’s knee. </p>
<p>“I'll be staying in my own house from now on during the summer you'll see me on the weekends and of course during the holidays.” Ginny explained “Well I should get going but I'll see you tomorrow I have a big surprise. I love you all very much.“ Ginny hugged all three of her children before making her way into the night.</p>
<p>“Teddy should be here in a hour. Apparently he got caught up at work with an emergency of sorts. Let's eat.“ Harry motioned to the kitchen. As far as Albus could see not even Teddy could make this better. Although on second thought Teddy could make almost anything better he was magical like that. <br/>By the time they were cleaning up the doorbell went off for the second time that night. But this time it was Albus who got to the door first.</p>
<p>“Teddy!“ He exclaimed excitedly while hugging the twenty year old man.</p>
<p>“How have you been Al?” Teddy was the only person allowed to call Albus that.</p>
<p>“I'm alright, dad made spaghetti.”</p>
<p>“Good. I'm starving!“ Teddy said his hello’s to the rest of the family before Albus lead him to the kitchen. </p>
<p>“... How are you feeling about everything?” Teddy asked always first to be concerned for others.</p>
<p>“It's sad and I wish it didn't have to happen but I wasn't really surprised you know.”</p>
<p>Teddy nodded chewing before speaking “What do mean by that?” it wasn't an accusation just a question, that was Teddy for you always taking an interest in everyone else.</p>
<p>“Well starting around Easter when mom would come home he didn't kiss her or ask how her day was he seemed really distant and sad whenever she was around. And today was the worst, he looked like a kicked puppy. It's really hard to see him like this. That's really the terrible part, seeing how sad they both are, how their both trying to keep it together for us.” Harry hadn't meant to to listen in but once he started he couldn't stop . In all truth it completely broke Teddy's heart to see Albus like this. Sweet little Albus.</p>
<p>“I'm sorry.“ He said placing his hands on the younger boys hands.</p>
<p>“I'm just glad you're here at least I won't be so gloomy.“</p>
<p>“Hey. I'm here if you need to talk, anyways I should probably unpack.” </p>
<p>“Can I play some music I just got a guitar in Hogsmeade it took all summer to get the money for it!”</p>
<p>“I’d like that a lot.”</p>
<p>So they went up the attic were Teddy slept, Albus grabbing his guitar on the way there. Teddy glanced over to the younger boy who looked like he was sweating buckets </p>
<p>“No worries if you don't want to show me though I'm sure your great!“ </p>
<p>Albus closed his eyes in concentration “Come on pull yourself together.” he mumbled under his breath.His voice was the sweetest thing Teddy had ever heard.</p>
<p>[Pale Blue Eyes by The Velvet Underground (not the full song though so I suggest you check it out)]</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel so happy </p>
<p>Sometimes I feel so sad </p>
<p>Sometimes I feel so happy </p>
<p>But mostly you just make me mad </p>
<p>Baby you just make me mad </p>
<p>Linger on your pale blue eyes</p>
<p>Linger on your pale blue eyes </p>
<p>Thought of you as my mountain top </p>
<p>Teddy could feel himself being carried away to another world as if he were dreaming as if the voice and the light strumming of Albus's guitar could take him away. It was in this moment he realized something that would change his life forever he wasn't just fond of the boy pouring his heart out to him but in love with him. In love with the way he looked completely at peace with eyes closed strumming his guitar, getting lost in the music.</p>
<p>I thought of you as everything I had but couldn't keep </p>
<p>I've had but couldn't keep </p>
<p>Linger on your pale blue eyes </p>
<p>Linger on your pale blue eyes </p>
<p>If could make the world as pure and strange as what I see </p>
<p>I'd put you in the mirror </p>
<p>That I put in front of me </p>
<p>As Albus sang Teddy continued to complete deciding it wasn't fair to bring this on Albus when he wouldn't even turn 16 for another week. No if he ever brought it up it wouldn't be before he was seventeen and Teddy probably never would but he also knew this wasn't the kind of thing that faded ethier. </p>
<p>“What do think?“ Albus voice fragile and nervous waiting for Teddy's response. The whole thing made Teddy want to cry it was like he found a piece of himself that he didn't even know was missing.</p>
<p>“It was absolutely beautiful and I hope you share more with me.“ </p>
<p>“Really!” Albus's eyes sparked with happiness.</p>
<p>“Yes. I have an idea.“</p>
<p>“What?“</p>
<p>“I have one of those Muggle tape recorders, we can record the song like a real Muggle rockstar!”</p>
<p>“Cool!“ </p>
<p>So they did and then they spent the night in Teddy's bed talking about all their favorite bands and when Albus left. Teddy fell asleep to the sound of his new favorite song.</p>
<p>Linger on your pale blue eyes </p>
<p>Linger on your pale blue eyes </p>
<p>She said money is like us time </p>
<p>It lies but can't stand up down for you is up</p>
<p>Linger on your pale blue eyes </p>
<p>Linger on your pale blue eyes </p>
<p>But it's truly </p>
<p>Truly a sin</p>
