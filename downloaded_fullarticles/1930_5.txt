    <p>
  <span>Winter brought fatigue to the sun. It usually sat high in the sky, diligently lighting the grounds of Hogwarts. As the solstice approached, it spent more time hiding behind thick clouds or letting the moon take over. Wood remained diligent through the cold and dark, insisting that Quidditch practice in the dark would allow the team to practice without worrying about Slytherin spies. The team had assured Wood that he was the only one worrying about such spies. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry stood in the locker room, trying and failing to stay warm. Before leaving the common room he had put on three pairs of socks, two Weasley jumpers, gloves and a scarf, but the wind found a way to blow right through him. He had always been smaller because of the way he ate at the Dursleys, and was no stranger to being incurably cold. Baggy, worn out t-shirts could only keep so much heat in. It was warmer in the locker room, if only by two degrees. At least the wind was limited to the draft by the door. Harry shivered and pulled his scarf tighter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oliver Wood was usually the first to arrive for practice, eager to get the most out of their time. Angelina and the girls would follow soon after. Harry was usually moderately on time, and really wasn’t early, so he found it strange that he should be the first person to arrive. As his teeth began to chatter, Harry really wished Hermione was with him. She would probably know a clever spell to stay warm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello Harry,” came a voice. It was Fred, whose freckled face was flushed red from the cold. His red hair was windswept. His knitted red neckwarmer was held in place by one of his hands, with cold red fingers. He had on a large sweater and flannel pajama pants- most certainly not the gryffindor uniform. “Came to tell you there’s no practice today.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s not?” Harry asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nope. Oliver made an announcement about it yesterday in the common room, I think you and Hermione were in the library or something.” Fred replied. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.” said Harry, feeling embarrassed. Hermione had been helping him research ways to breathe underwater for the second task. They hadn’t had much luck. He started to feel the stress and sleepiness sink into him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And I came to check on you because I know you’re the sort of diligent chap who comes to practice without being told.” Fred walked from the doorway over to Harry, who felt sort of zoned out. “Which I admire about you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You what?” Harry wanted to say, but it came out as more of a squeak. He was suddenly very aware of small things, like the pattern of Fred’s pajama pants or the felted surface of his slippers. Or the way the cold turned his lips just the tiniest bit blue. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Was I not clear?” Fred whispered. The heat from his breath made clouds that fogged up Harry’s glasses. From this distance, he could smell the soft scent of pine that seemed to radiate off Fred. They spent so much time goofing off in the forbidden forest instead of going to classes that all of his clothes stunk of it- the fresh leaves and fall fern. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The cold must have been turning Harry delirious, because he sank right into Fred’s chest and inhaled deeply. Strong, warm arms wrapped around him, enveloping him in that sweet smell. It was the smell of cookies freshly baked in the oven and a dinner being kept warm on the stove. It was the first present under the Christmas tree. It was home. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry felt the pressure of Fred’s chin resting on his head, in his messy hair. He had done his best to brush it this morning, but it hadn’t done any good. “I think I love you,” Harry whispered, and realized that he really had gone mad. There was no way he would say those things when he was in his right mind. Fred had said it already, of course, but Harry wasn’t sure if it was in the same way. Harry loved Fred’s freckled face and pointy nose, and the way his bright hair stood out in the autumn leaves, and how he somehow managed to drag him away from all of his problems and keep him grounded in the same sentence. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, me too.” Fred said quietly, mostly into Harry’s mop of hair. He could feel his face going red, and the sudden warmth emanating from Fred’s neck suggested he felt the same. Neither of them were good at addressing their emotions. “Wh-what now?” Harry asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I guess we can do this,” Fred muttered, leaning in. Their lips pressed together, chapped from the cold, but still soft. Fred pulled away, looking redder than ever. “I mean, if… if you want.” he whispered. Ever-confident Fred acting embarrassed sent Harry even further down his spiral. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The scent brought Harry back to the first time Fred had convinced him to skip class. He had been stressed about making it to classes on time while still sticking to his Quidditch responsibilities.  “Potions with Snape is for masochists, Harry. Think about your well-being.” Fred said, tugging on his arm. They were stopped in the hall, surrounded by a sea of other students rushing by. “I’ve got a </span>
  <em>
    <span>pop quiz, Fred.” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Harry replied, a bit more loudly than he should have because of the noise in the hall. “We’re going!” Fred exclaimed, running out the building and dragging poor Harry behind. The forest in fall was beautiful. It was an ocean of auburn, pulling Harry away from his worries and into Fred’s arms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Here he was, once again, in those arms. He stared into those deep eyes, flecked with honey, as they stared right back. Harry could see the gentle flicker of the fires they had built together. “I think it’s safe to say…” he whispered. “That I do.” </span>
