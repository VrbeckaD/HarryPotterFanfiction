          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry is not broken.</p><p>Around him, Hogwarts – postbellum, smeared with black soot and crow feathers, twisted and half-ruined, filled with groans and weeping. Ashes are waltzing in the air, covering the earth with a coal blanket, filling the lungs and not letting breathe freely. The lake is filled with gloomy rotting, the trees creak with dead silence. The world is plunged into irresistible grief; it crawled under each stone, absorbed every blade of grass, devoured the sun and destroyed the light.</p><p>Harry can’t hear anything said to him. He’s seeing faces – exhausted and stained, bloodied and tearful. All of them are passing by like blurred spots, all of them are too insignificant and miserable. He doesn’t focus on Hermione’s wavy hair and quiet voice; he doesn’t focus on Ron, whose lips are trembling with the experienced loss; he doesn’t focus on people who’re giving him oblique glances. They are afraid to approach him because he – their hero, their savior, the freaking boy-who-lived – is dangerous. Because he’s a battered dog sitting by a dead fountain, because he’s barely audible whining in pain, because he lost the dearest thing he had.</p><p> </p><p>Harry remembers it like yesterday – once it rained. He was running away from the Quidditch field, with nose ungodly squishing, with wet mud on his shoes. Hogwarts greeted him with warmth and comfort; only one of the corridors was deadly cold. And of course, Harry slipped there.</p><p>Malfoy was a mess. He curled up in the furthest corner, under a frosty stained-glass window, clinging to his hair and swaying from side to side. He was crying for sure; but didn’t let out a moan nor a single sob. He didn’t notice Harry and was hardly noticing anything around. His magic uncontrollably burst out, without the slightest help of a wand.</p><p>And Harry, of course, couldn’t pass by. His breathing spilled out of his mouth with white curls; arms barely noticeably pricked from the cold; but not giving a damn about his possible frostbite, he sank down beside and took the Slytherin’s hands in his. He shuddered and raised his head – Harry was almost sure now he would be trampled down and humbled. But the blond silently and sharply leaned forward, weightlessly touching his lips and immediately recoiling.</p><p>Then he was only Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>A year later he became Draco. Harry remembers they were lying by the lake, very close to the edge of the water; both perfectly happy. He wove a wreath out of scanty snow-white flowers and stoutly tried to put it on a beloved blond head. Slytherin threatened, Slytherin laughed, Slytherin kicked; but the damn wreath eventually ended up on him, and Harry was kissing his neck, inhaling the smell of spring. In front of him was the one to whom he once presented his heart. They spun a web of sun-sparkling moments, ignoring the opinions of others, world-saving, and the whole Hogwarts.</p><p> </p><p>Harry remembers the only thing he thought about after Dumbledor’s death was Malfoy’s betrayal. It scattered him on small pebbles, strangled the flowers of their love with poisonous ivy. He tried to suppress the hatred inside, not realizing that it wasn’t the thing eating his heart. It was a <em>worry.</em></p><p>When Harry fared at the Malfoy Manor, all he was trying to do was to catch at least the slightest sign of the traitor. And he was there – looking at him with an impassive face, like a gloriously trained snake. Harry’s world staggered under his feet; yet, when the wands flew up, guided by their owners' magic, he grabbed Malfoy’s hand and pulled to himself; so silly, childishly awkward and naive, as if saving his princess.</p><p>Malfoy didn’t thank him for this, but then he became Draco again.</p><p> </p><p>Harry remembers that he missed out Ron’s amazed glance and Hermione’s soft smile. He clung to Draco as if they hadn’t seen each other for a century. He said they could save Narcissa and Lucius; said they would complete their mission; said a lot of things, yet practically didn’t believe in anything. He was tired. All he wanted was to grab Draco by the wrist and run far, far away, to where the war had never shaken the earth and the skies. Hardly such a place ever existed.</p><p>Harry said a lot more balderdash, always receiving silence in response. But one evening they were watching the fireflies dancing in the night, and he heard: “I will die for you.”</p><p>So when the Lord Voldemort raised his wand, hanging over the weakened enemy, Draco didn’t doubt for a second.</p><p> </p><p>And now Harry’s cradling Draco Malfoy in his arms, around him Hogwarts and blurry faces.</p><p>Harry is not broken. He is dead.</p></div>
