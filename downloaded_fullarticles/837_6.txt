    <p>A heavy silence had fallen over Godrics Hollow, full of fearful anticipation and an unnerved sense of the unknown. To a stranger nothing would appear amiss. The hedges were neatly trimmed, and the cobbled paths were swept clean, but it would only take one closer look to reveal that all was not as it seemed. No light gleamed merrily from within the cottages and no smoke puffed from the chimneys. The place was still, waiting with seemingly bated breath for the dreaded climactic reveal. </p><p>Lily potter also waited silently. She sat in the dark, her wand at the ready, expecting hell to come crashing through her door at any moment. It had been hours since James had left her, hours of sitting beside her son’s crib, casting paranoid glances over at the sleeping infant every few seconds to make sure that he was still there, that he was still breathing, that he was safe.  But Harry slept easily, unaware of the danger that seemed to lurk beyond the walls of his quiet little home. He didn’t wake when his mother placed a gentle hand on his chest, and he didn’t stir when she began to cry frightened tears. He didn’t see as the proud, brave mask that Lily had spent her whole life creating began to crack at the thought of losing her son. </p><p>He didn’t even move when the door to the cottage was thrown open with a deafening bang. The noise seemed to echo in each crevice of the tiny house and then silence fell once more. Lily leapt to her feet, positioning herself in front of Harry’s crib with her wand raised. Then she waited once more in the darkness, her ears straining to hear for the sound of footsteps on the staircase. But there was nothing. Nothing moved within the house. Suddenly, a thin strip of light appeared beneath the nursery door, illuminating the room with a dim glow. Lily’s breath caught in her throat and all the nerves in her body seemed to come alive. She had fought people before, battled and defended and she never felt afraid. But now it was different, now it truly mattered if she failed because now there was someone else to protect, someone who couldn’t fight for himself, someone she loved.</p><p>The door creaked open and a shadowy figure began to edge their way slowly inside. Without a second thought Lily flicked her wand and shouted ‘crucio’. It was the first spell to come to her mind and she cast it instinctively. All thoughts of right and wrong flew from her mind as her entire body was ensnared with the desperate need to protect her child. The assailant fell to the floor, a shriek erupting from their lips as their wand fell to the floor, illuminating the room even further and allowing Lily to finally set eyes upon her victim. </p><p>Except that it wasn’t the cold, dead expression of a Death Eater’s mask, nor the snake-like eyes of Voldemort staring up at her. These eyes were a tortured hazel, gazing up at her through thick glasses. Lily gasped and let her wand fall to the floor. The shrieks of pain ceased, and she rushed to the man laying twisted on the floor. ‘James?’ her voice was breathy with panic and shock ‘James can you hear me? I’m so sorry.’</p><p>James Potter was breathing heavy, panting in a desperate attempt to regain his breath. He didn’t answer Lily’s question, but he did manage to pant out a few words and she listened intently. ‘It was Wormtail. Wormtail was the traitor.’ And then the tiny house in Godrics Hollow fell into silence once more. The only sound to be heard was Harry’s steady breathing and James’ ragged breaths.<br/>
A fire ignited in Lily’s eyes and her hand reached back to snatch her wand with a white-knuckled grip. ‘I’ll kill him’ she spat, the venom in her words more evident with each syllable. </p><p>But James’ hand was gentle when it found her own, his fingers tenderly tugging the wand from hers and letting it roll away from them on the floor. ‘Don’t worry about Wormtail’ he told her, and the tone of his voice was all the explanation that she needed. Wormtail wouldn’t be a problem anymore.</p><p>‘How?’ in all honesty she wasn’t entirely sure that she wanted to know, but something inside was imploring her to ask, to know how her old friend had met his demise. </p><p>‘You know Sirius’ James sighed, his breath finally returning ‘he could be a Hufflepuff he’s so loyal. Luckily Moody saw everything or they’d probably be carting Sirius off to Azkaban with the rest of them.’</p><p>‘The rest of them?’</p><p>James smiled, and this time it glinted in his eyes ‘It’s over Lil, it’s really over. He’s dead and his following are being carted off to Azkaban as we speak. We did it.’</p><p>Lily didn’t answer for a moment, unsure what to say. They’d spent months living in terror, waiting for the day when Voldemort would come crashing through their door to steal away their son and now he was telling her that it was over? How was she supposed to cope with that? ‘But the prophecy’ she managed after a moment of heavy silence.</p><p>James shook his head, his smile still painted across his face ‘Smashed. We’re going to make our own future Lily. You, me and the Prongslet. Just how it was meant to be.’</p><p>He wrapped an arm around her and she nestled her head against his. And they stayed like that, entwined with each other, listening to their son breathe quietly from his crib, knowing that they could finally rest.</p><p> </p>
