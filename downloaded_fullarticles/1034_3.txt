    <p>Harry had thought her hair was red, once.</p><p>Everyone else in her family has hair that's red. Muggle firetrucks are red. Apples are red. Bricks are red. There really isn't much variation to any of those, not that he's noticed.</p><p>But the four of them are walking back from playing Quidditch one day and he sees the colors from her hair catching in the dying sunset. She's looking at him and rolling her eyes about Ron and Hermione, but suddenly all he can focus on is how the little strands dance around her face. He sees that it's actually more of a <em>redblondebrownbronze</em>. It's not <em>all</em> red, not individually...it's just tiny pieces that come together to give off the general red appearance. And her eyebrows aren't even red – they're closer to a blonde/brown. He doesn't reckon he's ever met someone who had different eyebrow and hair colors.</p><p>Of course, it escapes him completely that he's never looked at anyone else's eyebrows that closely, either.</p><p>But now that he's noticed her hair, he spends the next several days thoughtfully considering how the different pieces play together. He doesn't even do it on purpose – his mind just happens to drift to it whenever she's nearby, especially if her hair is looking especially tousled or wavy or even if it's damp from the shower. It's something that always manages to catch his eye, something flashy and fascinating, something that's undeniably interesting in way he can't quite put his finger on.</p><p>He swears he sees a black hair on her head once, too, but it passes by really quickly before she bends down and swoops up her whole thick mane in a ponytail. He shakes his head and tells himself he's probably just looking too closely. This is a fact soon confirmed when she deftly performs a mid-air intercept of their makeshift Quaffle.</p><p>The next night, Harry glances over at Ron's sleeping form, at <em>his</em> red hair, before he falls asleep himself. And the fact that Ron's hair doesn't interest him— not in the slightest— is lost on him, too.</p><hr/><p>Ginny knows that boys – and men – tended to look at her. This is not groundbreaking.</p><p>Of course, if you ask, she'll deny this within an inch of her life. There's a difference between being aware of your appearance and being a complete cow about it. And as Ginny matures into her teen years, she's determined to stay on the left side of that line, <em>thankyouverymuch</em>.</p><p>Lee Jordan had been the first boy she'd caught staring at her. It had happened in the summer before her third year at Hogwarts, and he'd dropped by to visit the twins. She'd been innocently swimming in the pond near the Burrow when it happened. She hadn't been wearing a proper swimming costume, only an old pair of shorts and a t-shirt. Wearing a proper swimming costume was one of those things she saw little point in, much like refraining from swearing. Flying with shorts or trousers on was simply far more comfortable, and she'd know, because she'd tried it both ways.</p><p>You see, flying— or even a <em>chance</em> at flying— had influenced all of her wardrobe choices that summer. Due to the fact that her brothers are overprotective <em>berks</em> who still wouldn't let her fly with them, she'd needed to be ready to sneak in a good fly <em>when</em> and <em>if</em> one of the aforementioned berks happened to accidentally leave a broom lying about. Unfortunately for Ginny, this level of carelessness with personal belongings was a very rare occurrence in the Weasley household; being poor tends to give you an appreciation for things like that. Thus, Ginny'd simply had no option but to be constantly ready to ride a broomstick (and to do so in comfort), <em>just in case </em>the rare chance to fly presented itself.</p><p>Thus, at nearly 14, Ginny— who had only started to <em>need</em> a bra a few months ago, and who had certainly never worn one while swimming— had never been in a situation where she'd had to consider the fact that her shirt was white (<em>which it was</em>) or that her bra was black (<em>which it was</em>), and that she was currently soaked from head to toe (<em>which </em>she<em> was</em>). She soon realized, though, that these were things that boys noticed, regardless of if she paid attention to these things herself.</p><p>And so this was how Lee Jordan had stumbled upon Ginny's peacefully floating form on that warm summer's day— and by the time he was caught doing so, the look on his face suggested that (to his utmost humiliation) he'd simply forgotten that she was Fred and George's baby sister.</p><p>Ginny had felt rather than heard that someone was there. A strange prickling sensation had spread in a cobweb-like pattern beneath her skin, starting at the nape of her neck and sending a shiver down her spine. And almost in a whisper, from somewhere deep in the instinctual recesses of her mind, Ginny heard the three words that chilled her to the bone: <em>You're. Being. Watched.</em></p><p>At this, she'd gasped a little and opened her eyes, immediately placing her feet down to stand in the soft mushy clay at the bottom of the pond. As she'd pushed her damp hair out of her face, she'd found Lee Jordan standing at the edge of the pond, his jaw slack and mouth agape as he stared at her.</p><p>"Uh…L-Lee?" she'd ventured, confused. She hadn't even been aware he was planning to visit.</p><p>Her inquiry had broken him from his vacant stare, and his skin had immediately darkened beneath her gaze.</p><p>"Bollocks," he'd muttered hastily, shuffling from one foot to the other and determinedly looking away, "I mean, <em>sorry</em>, Ginny…so sorry…was looking for um…" He'd trailed off, clearing his throat and vaguely gesturing to the house.</p><p>She'd blinked twice.</p><p>"Lee, you'll probably find that Fred and George are inside."</p><p>He'd nervously chuckled a little too loudly in response and run his hand hurriedly over his hair.</p><p>"<em>C-course</em>, Ginny! Don't know where I thought they'd be! <em>Right-o</em>! Thanks!" With that, he'd managed to look everywhere but her – the trees, the clouds, the grass, the pond – before turning on the spot and bounding for the Burrow.</p><p>Ginny had stared at his retreating form, filled with a mixture of confusion and…what was this…<em>empowerment</em>? And for a brief, shining moment, she'd felt good about herself, felt good about the fact that boys— and maybe even one <em>particular</em> boy, one day — could see her as more than just a little girl. She'd smiled happily as she strode out of the pond, water sloshing merrily around her thighs.</p><p>But as she'd stood at the water's edge and glanced down at her calves to check for leeches, she noticed in horror <em>exactly</em> what Lee had been staring at.</p><p>He'd been staring straight through her soaked shirt.</p><p>Right through to certain anatomical details of her chest – ones which had been undeniable, one which were <em>clearly</em> visible through the soft fabric of her bra. Her fleeting sense of empowerment had instead been replaced with mortified disgust. She'd never felt more exposed or violated or <em>naive</em>. She'd reckoned she hated that last feeling more than any of the others — it was a feeling that made her feel like she was three years old, like she was a stumbling toddler who should've known better than to believe that Lee was looking at her face or thinking about the merits of her personality.</p><p>She'd known that Lee was a decent bloke, of course — she just hadn't been ready to show that to <em>anyone</em> yet. She wasn't even 14, and while her poncy ancient pureblood ancestors may have been content to marry at that age, she certainly wasn't. No, she wasn't ready for that type of attention… not now, anyway. And certainly not from a friend of her brothers, which just amplified the awkwardness, since she'd most certainly have to see him again. Still, she reckoned that Lee would take the details of this little incident to the grave; if that experience had to happen with anyone, Ginny was glad it'd happened with someone who wouldn't bring it up again.</p><p>And as much as Ginny'd hated to admit that her brothers were right about <em>anything</em> once they got into that stupid pack mentality, she'd had to concede that, <em>yes</em>, they'd hinted that something like this might happen, even if those hints hadn't come in the form of exact words on the subject. Every time she'd returned from a break at Hogwarts, she'd noticed them taking an increasingly protective stance towards her. It had happened slowly at first — shared glances between Bill and Charlie when she wore a shorter summer dress out of the house, the cocked eyebrows of the twins if she sent an owl to a male friend.</p><p>This had reached the peak of obnoxiousness sometime between the Lee incident and the Quidditch World Cup. It was hot, it was <em>summer</em>, and Ginny had decided to wear a vest on a trip down to Ottery St. Catchpole. She hadn't gotten that far in this endeavor, though, because Percy had taken it upon himself to corner her and insist that her wardrobe choices were inappropriate. Ginny had sputtered and glared at him and asked what <em>that</em> was supposed to mean, but he'd only turned up his nose in that sanctimonious way of his and noted that "<em>ladylike </em><em>witches</em> wear jumpers over their vests."</p><p>This had bothered her so much that she'd had a hushed conversation with her mother about it. This was something she rarely did, because she knew how the trickle-down effect worked; Mum would tell Dad, Dad would tell Bill or Charlie or Percy, one of them would tell the twins, and then <em>they'd</em> make her life at Hogwarts particularly unlivable. (And Ron was also annoying, but he tended to be more oblivious, so she didn't mind him as much.)</p><p>Still, Percy was being an absolute <em>arse</em> (and over more than just his Ministry job), and Ginny was starting to feel like things would get worse if she didn't take steps to avoid future smothering.</p><p>Molly, however, had not been on the same page.</p><p>"Your brothers are only trying to <em>protect</em> you, dear," she'd said, folding laundry. She'd explained this pedantically, like it was the most obvious thing in the world, like Ginny was a moron for not understanding as much.</p><p>Ginny immediately felt like a fool for ever questioning where Percy had gotten that from.</p><p>"And if I do say so <em>myself</em>," her mum had added, a hint of that holier-than-thou tone rising to the surface, "they are not wrong to be concerned." Then, she'd put a folded shirt down on the sofa, giving her daughter a pointed stare.</p><p>Ginny had gotten the distinct feeling that this entire conversation had been building up to whatever her mother was about to say; a second later, she was proven correct. </p><p>Her mum sniffed, turned back to the laundry and casually noted, "And you don't <em>always</em> make the best choices, you know."</p><p>Ginny had rolled her eyes so hard that she thought they might've gotten stuck there, but the woman had made her point. No one was ever going to let Ginny forget fucking Tom Riddle and his fucking <em>diary</em>. For some perverse reason, Ginny'd knows her brothers take responsibility for that whole thing, not that it had involved them in the slightest. Still, her mother had all but confirmed one of Ginny's longstanding beliefs: Based on an incident that had happened was she was eleven — <em>eleven</em>!— her brothers were likely to monitor her interactions with the opposite sex, likely to make vague comments about her, likely to drive her to take a damned vow of celibacy just to get them to <em>shut the hell up</em>.</p><p>Which, she supposed, was probably the point. Not that she'd ever actually go that far.</p><p>Despite her brothers' best efforts, the <em>looks</em> from boys at Hogwarts had followed shortly thereafter. By the end of her fourth year (and after two boyfriends), she thought she'd seen all of the ways that boys could look at her. This "catalog"— if you will — had ranged from the grotesque (a leering up-and-down glare beneath waggling eyebrows) to the innocent (bumbling, blushing, unable to meet her eyes).</p><p>But Harry's gaze had been different, even from the very first time he'd truly noticed that she wasn't simply another anonymous extension of the Weasley family. Naturally, Ginny remembered every moment of this encounter, even if she hadn't dared look into it too much.</p><p>They'd been walking to the field to play two-a-side Quidditch. Ron and Hermione had been walking ahead of them, lost in their own world as they bickered softly about sun cream.</p><p>"But <em>Ron</em>," Hermione had implored, "Your skin is so fair! Surely you'd prefer to fly if we could find a way to cover the sunlight, perhaps through an engorgement charm on an umbrella, or-"</p><p>" –But the whole <em>point</em> of Quidditch is that you're playing in the open air, Hermione!" Ron had cut her off, incredulous. "Why would I <em>want</em> to play underneath an umbrella if I'm trying to fly around in the air?"</p><p>Harry and Ginny had shared an eye-roll, a habit that they practiced often when it came to Ron and Hermione.</p><p>But this time, Harry had stilled a bit after he rolled his eyes, his brow furrowed in curiosity.</p><p>"Huh. Your shirt is the exact same shade as your hair."</p><p>His tone had been observational — <em>interested</em>, even — like he'd just learned a new fact worthy of sharing. His green eyes were focused intently, but they weren't critical or appraising. Instead, his gaze was akin to how he might observe a complicated transfiguration spell, as if Ginny had just been shifted into something else, something completely different, right in front of his eyes.</p><p>And Ginny suddenly realized two things, in very quick succession: One, that Harry had never really looked at her that closely before. And two, that he was absolutely, beyond a shadow of a doubt, doing that. <em>Right now</em>.</p><p>As such, she'd been caught off guard, but she'd righted herself almost immediately. Just because Harry was <em>looking</em> at her didn't mean he was interested in her. And besides, she was sure she'd worn this shirt several times this summer. And besides <em>that</em>, she had a boyfriend.</p><p>Ginny'd suddenly found herself a little embarrassed that Dean was the last thing she'd thought of in that sequence.</p><p>In an effort to rectify the feeling of guilt that had settled in the pit of her stomach, she'd just shrugged back at Harry, her face the epitome of nonchalance. "Red is red, I guess." The garment wasn't anything special, really.</p><p>Harry had paused in his path and cocked his head like he was about to refute this. He was interrupted, however, when Hermione stepped in an old gnome-hole and began shrieking.</p><p>Since Ginny had spent most of her first three years at Hogwarts analyzing every single one of Harry's comments, she hadn't read too much into this interaction. He may have been a <em>decent</em> bloke, but he was still a bloke; living with six brothers had taught her that they weren't exactly hardwired to notice things like hair colors.</p><p>Still, she couldn't deny that he'd looked. And that his <em>look</em> was different.</p><p>It wasn't lascivious or suggestive or lewd. It wasn't entitled, demanding. It didn't make either of them uncomfortable in its awkwardness. In fact, the look in his eyes was so pure, so <em>open</em>, that she didn't even feel the need to offer a single thing to propel the conversation forward.</p><p>...and with a complete degree of certainty, <em>that </em>was something that Ginny had never experienced before.</p>
