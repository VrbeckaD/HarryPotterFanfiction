    <p>Another year at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>	Summer had come and gone. For Draco, the time between school years seemed to pass at both an unfamiliarly fast and uncomfortably slow pace.</p>
<p>	That Harry Potter...</p>
<p>	He was in his head, tangled up in his thoughts like a nuisance.</p>
<p>	Even when he wasn't around, he was such a bother. The pest had no idea. And that just made it all the more infuriating.</p>
<p>	He was just an ordinary boy. Unremarkable. He received praise for doing absolutely nothing, attracted friends and admirers with no effort, and he didn't even need to open his mouth for his reputation to be heard and known around the wizarding world. His school life was everything Draco wanted his own to be, full of achievements and glory. (Except he didn't want all the hassle and danger. Potter could keep the danger to himself.)</p>
<p>	His summer was idled away with his thoughts stuck on him.</p>
<p>	He had to find a way to make Harry pay for all the time he'd made him waste. His thoughts deserved to be occupied by better things, like... Like things that <i>weren't</i> Harry, that was for sure.</p>
<p>	When he returned to school, Crabbe and Goyle were loyally waiting for him. They tried to make small talk, asking what he did during his summer. Draco made up fanciful stories for them that were only loosely based on true events. In reality, he barely remembered all the days he'd daydreamed his way through. At least they had his back when it came to Harry Potter. As soon as he uttered his name along a seething breath, their faces lit up with familiar wicked grins.</p>
<p>	Although his summer had been spent pondering Potter, he hadn't plotted a proper plan to put him in his place.</p>
<p>	Fortunately, Hogwarts presented him with an excellent opportunity.</p>
<p>	Each house was going to organize their own events for a cultural festival. For three days, outsiders would be welcome to the school for entertainment provided by the students. It was everyone's chance to show their their skills and garner points for their respective houses. It was an especially valuable opportunity for the young wizards who had their eye on a certain position within the wizarding world. Recruiters and prospective employers visited the festivals each year to gauge the potential of the students. Without a doubt, the ones who stood out were remembered, their names written down to be contacted after graduation.</p>
<p>	Although it was certainly an entertaining affair, it wasn't all fun and games. It was necessary for costs to be taken into consideration as events and activities were being discussed. They were limited by nothing but their imaginations – and their wallets. The school wasn't funding any of their efforts. Those three magical days were the responsibility of the students themselves.</p>
<p>	It wasn't a competition, but Draco's competitive streak couldn't help but feel provoked. It as an opportunity for him to elevate Slytherin above Gryffindor.</p>
<p>	They needed an impressive amount of money to put on an impressive show.</p>
<p>	Draco had a foolproof money-making scheme in mind. As always, Crabbe and Goyle followed him from one place to another as he gathered the necessary items for his plan. They seemed to get the idea on their own as they watched his collection grow.</p>
<p>	A long and elegant feather of an exotic bird.</p>
<p>	Brushes of exceptional quality, each featuring unique and interesting bristles.</p>
<p>	A well-worn book of uncommon hexes and their remedies.</p>
<p>	“Hexes?” Crabbe had muttered uncertainly. “Thought I knew what you were up to, Draco, but now I've not got the foggiest clue...”</p>
<p>	Goyle had also looked at him with a confused face. “When I saw the feather and those brushes, I thought you were plannin' on tickling Harry Potter to death or something.”</p>
<p>	Precisely.</p>
<p>	That was exactly what he had in mind. ...Not to <i>death</i>, of course, but he had a brilliant plan that involved Potter and the fine tip of a feather. If there was one thing the Slytherins and the other houses had in common, it was a mutual distaste for Potter and his 'heroics'. None of them wanted to see Gryffindor back up at the top as the heroes of the cultural festival. Draco was going to be their savior.</p>
<p>	...And he was going to snatch their money at the same time.</p>
<p>	He had a bit of light entertainment planned, and his big helper was going to be...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	“Harry Potter.”</p>
<p>	“Malfoy.” Harry stopped where he was walking in the hall and turned around to face him. “What is it this time? I have to help with Gryffindor's fundraising for the festival, so I hope you don't plan on wasting my time.”</p>
<p>	That was rich.</p>
<p>	“Me?” Draco asked, his lips twitching into a grin. “Oh, Potter, if only you realized how much of my time you waste every day...”</p>
<p>	“What's that supposed to mean?”</p>
<p>	“Nothing. You didn't hear a thing.” Draco stepped toward him and laid a friendly hand on his shoulder. He didn't miss the way his touch made Harry jump. “I was looking for you, you know. You were just heading toward Slytherin House, weren't you?”</p>
<p>	“Huh? No, I said I was just heading back to-”</p>
<p>	“Great, great. Well, let's get a move on. It was so kind of you to volunteer to help the Slytherins. I'm quite surprised, to be honest. What an unexpectedly generous move from the shrewd Harry Potter. Are you trying to get on our good side? Oh, you sly boy, you. I imagine the other Gryffindors will be quite cross with you... But that's alright. The other houses are going to have newfound respect for you.”</p>
<p>	Harry forcibly extracted himself from under Draco's grasp and took a step away. “Hold on. What are you talking about? Volunteer? For Slytherin? When did I ever do such a thing?” He paused, making a face, and shook his head to dismiss the idea altogether. “No... Better question: What makes you even think I'd help you?”</p>
<p>	“Hm? You won't help?” Draco asked, giving him an innocent look, tilting his head to the side in mock curiosity.</p>
<p>	“Of course not. Gryffindor needs me right now.” He paused again, except his expression faltered that time. He seemed to be succumbing to the facade Draco was feeding him. “Draco... Look, I'm sorry. It's actually not half-bad to hear you asking <i>me</i> for help, but... This unfortunately isn't the time. Now, if you'll excuse me...”</p>
<p>	Draco stepped in his way and prevented him from leaving. The few other students who were moving between houses hurried their way past them, not wishing to involve themselves in their business. No one was going to be coming to Potter's aid.</p>
<p>	Dropping the innocent act, a wicked grin widened across Draco's face. “So naïve... I'm afraid you don't have a choice. Didn't you hear what I said? You've already volunteered to help us. Everyone is waiting for Harry Potter to make his appearance.”</p>
<p>	“You... haven't set me up with something dangerous, have you?” Harry asked warily, looking at him with suspicion.</p>
<p>	“Dangerous? I'd call that a matter of opinion.”</p>
<p>	“I don't like the sound of this,” Harry muttered. A tense moment passed as he looked around the hallway. There were ways for him to escape. If he really wanted to, he could have tried to run, but Draco could tell that his interest had been captured. Harry was a curious creature by nature.</p>
<p>	Danger?</p>
<p>	Danger was thrilling to that boy. He was attracted to danger just as much as danger was attracted to him.</p>
<p>	“Fine,” he said, relenting. “Take me there. Let's find out what you have up your sleeve. As long as this doesn't take too long, I suppose I... don't mind helping...”</p>
<p>	“Atta boy, Potter!” Draco slapped him on the back and chuckled as he watched Harry stumble forward a couple steps. “You're a real chum. Let's be along, then. Mustn't keep the people waiting!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	When they arrived at the Slytherin common area, a small crowd had already formed, filling the seats that were set up around the unlit fireplace. Crabbe and Goyle were there, diligently collecting the admission cost from the students who came to watch.</p>
<p>	As soon as Draco walked in with Harry in tow, the lot of them turned to look at them, their eyes widening and gleaming with mischievous interest. There were a few low chuckles and excited whispers among the group. All of the boys fidgeted in their seats, anxious to see what they were going to do. Although Draco hadn't explained a word of what he had planned to Harry, Crabbe and Goyle had already helped spread the word to entice the other houses. The boys filling the seats knew what they'd paid for.</p>
<p>	“Welcome, everyone!” Draco said, raising his voice. He greeted them with a broad wave of his arms. “Thank you so much for coming! I see a few familiar faces here today. Let me tell you, you're in for an incredible show. As you can see, I have with me the one, the only, Harry Potter! Give him a round, wouldn't you? He's a busy boy. Show him how much you appreciate his time.”</p>
<p>	There were cat calls and wolf whistles.</p>
<p>	Draco enjoyed the uncomfortable look on Harry's face. He sidled up next to him and rubbed his shoulder up against Harry's, leaning in to whisper.</p>
<p>	“Just play it cool, Potter. You wouldn't want me to look like a fool in front of all our lovely guests, would you?”</p>
<p>	“Why wouldn't I?” Harry muttered, an edge in his voice. He sent Draco a searing glare from the corners of his eyes.</p>
<p>	“Because,” Draco whispered back, his breath hot against Harry's ear. “In a right minute, I'm going to have the ability to do absolutely whatever I want with you. It would only be wise to behave yourself. Doing any less might make things... <i>unfortunate</i> for you.”</p>
<p>	Draco slipped away slowly, keeping his eyes locked on Harry's. He felt such a rush, seeing the fight in his eyes. Very soon, he was going to test him and see how long that obstinate attitude of his could last. He took out his wand, letting Harry see it to lure him into a false sense of security. He imagined what kind of thoughts had to be frantically flying through his mind. Likely, Harry was thinking of every counter-curse he knew, reciting them in his head to be prepared.</p>
<p>	Reluctantly, Harry followed Draco to the front. Students were still filtering in, but most of the seats had already been filled at that point. Knowing how much each of those seats cost, Draco knew that he'd already secured his house a small fortune for the festival.</p>
<p>	“Alright, now stand right here,” Draco said, lightly grabbing Harry to arrange him where he wanted him to be. Still, he hadn't explained what they were going to do. Draco flashed a smirk at their spectators. Before Harry could open his mouth – before he could even reach for his wand – with lightning-fast reflexes, Draco pointed his wand in Harry's direction and shouted, “Immobulus!”</p>
<p>	Instantly, Harry froze where he stood, posing awkwardly, unable to move.</p>
<p>	“Ah, perfect. What do you think, everyone?” Draco asked. He received nods of approval from the gathered students.</p>
<p>	“Make him strip!” someone shouted from the seats.</p>
<p>	“And how do you expect me to do that?” Draco asked, pretending to be unaware. They were even more unscrupulous than he was. Harry probably hadn't realized how devious some of his classmates were. Draco was honored to be the one who would disillusion him. “You couldn't be suggesting... Oh... No, no... I could never use <i>that</i> spell...”</p>
<p>	“Y-You're right,” Crabbe stammered. “That spell's forbidden, isn't it? You could get in serious trouble. D-Don't they send people to Azkaban for-”</p>
<p>	Draco sent Crabbe a glare that immediately made him shut up.</p>
<p>	“A student? To Azkaban? Over a paltry bit of mischief? You must be joking.” He shrugged and turned his favor back toward the audience. “I mean... As long as everyone here agrees that such a thing never took place, then there's no way anyone else would ever know what really happened in this room today. Isn't that right?”</p>
<p>	The other students nodded their agreement.</p>
<p>	Their money was as good as their word.</p>
<p>	“So it's decided.” He faced Harry and calmly raised his wand. “Imperio!”</p>
<p>	As soon as the spell connected, Harry's body became limp. His shoulders sagged forward. Even though he seemed able to move, he wasn't able to move without a word of command. It was no wonder the Imperius Curse was considered one of the ultimate forbidden curses. Draco could barely contain his excitement. He received such a rush, knowing that he could literally make him do whatever he wanted...</p>
<p>	From the seats, once again, came a low, insistent chant of <i>Strip! Strip! Strip!</i></p>
<p>	“Potter, why don't you remove some of your clothes for us?” Draco asked nicely. When he saw Harry's hands immediately reaching for his belt, Draco shot out a hand and caught his wrist. “What? Not there! You must be easier than I thought... You're going to make me sweat here, Potter. Start somewhere else, like... Take off your top. How about that?”</p>
<p>	Harry nodded mutely. By the unpleasant twist in his brow, Draco could tell that Harry was trying to fight the curse's effects, but it was a losing battle.</p>
<p>	With a shrug, Harry's robe fell from his shoulders to the floor. His movements were automatic and mechanical like a doll's. He clasped the bottom of his dark grey vest and raised it up over his head with no complaints. His fingers stiffly unbuttoned each of the buttons going down the front of his shirt, then pushed it open and let it fall to the floor with the rest of his things.</p>
<p>	Everyone had gone quiet. They sat on the edges of their seats, stupefied by the scene before them, amazed that <i>the</i> Harry Potter, boy of legend, was seriously undressing before their very eyes.</p>
<p>	As for Draco, he was also in disbelief. Even though he was the one who cast the spell, he hadn't prepared himself. His heart was pounding at the sight of Harry's pale skin. Shutting his jaw, he shook himself out of his stupor and nervously gathered up the clothes that Harry had discarded and pushed them off to the side, out of the way.</p>
<p>	He returned to Harry and placed a hand on his shoulder. He opened his mouth, ready to speak, but he stopped when he felt Harry's shoulder shudder under his hand. Draco's face became hot with a sudden realization. It was perfect...</p>
<p>	“Could it be... You're ticklish, Potter?” In the hall, he'd noticed Harry's strange discomfort when he touched his shoulder. He hadn't expected him to be ticklish in such a spot. “Oh dear. That must be troublesome for you. I wonder where else you're ticklish.”</p>
<p>	Nervous, Harry visibly swallowed, but he remained frozen in place and unable to act on his own.</p>
<p>	“Now you must realize why everyone came here, yes? These students parted with their money – money that could have gone to their own houses – for the chance to see you humiliate yourself. Do you even know how many of us have been waiting for a moment like this? You may have your fair share of admirers, but there are also those of us who think you could use more humility. I think it's up to us to keep that ego of yours in check.”</p>
<p>	Harry's eyes narrowed. His fingers twitched, trying to curl into fists.</p>
<p>	“First of all, give us a bow,” Draco directed.</p>
<p>	Harry did exactly as he instructed, bowing politely at the waist. After a second, he stood back up, shoulders squared, back straight.</p>
<p>	“Now... What would be embarrassing? How about a jig? Give us a foolish little dance, Potter.”</p>
<p>	Once again, he did as he was told, failing his arms and legs about in an oafish dance. His face became red with embarrassment as the boys in attendance laughed and pointed at him. As silly as his dance was, it still wasn't enough to satisfy Draco. There were 'better' things that they could do to him.</p>
<p>	Draco walked around him, pretending to admire him.</p>
<p>	“Alright,” he said. “That's enough of that. You can stop now, Potter.”</p>
<p>	Harry looked grateful that he'd let him stop so soon. He also appeared to be a little winded.</p>
<p>	“For a Seeker, you aren't in very good shape, are you? That's surprising. I wonder what your fellow Gryffindors would think if they saw you like this.” Draco leaned toward him and pinched one of Harry's sides, squeezing a bit of pudgy fat between his fingers. Again, he noticed the way his touch made him shiver. He seemed to be getting closer to Harry's weak spot. “Don't you come from a poor household? Where did all of this flab come from, Potter? Your summer must have been filled with treats. How irresponsible.”</p>
<p>	A few tears of shame appeared at the corners of Harry's eyes. It must have finally occurred to him that he was completely under their control, there to be mocked and teased, that other students had <i>paid</i> to be given that privilege.</p>
<p>	However, no one else was going to lay a hand on Harry unless Draco allowed it.</p>
<p>	Very lightly, Draco squeezed Harry's side again and smiled when he saw him squeeze his eyes shut. Coming up behind him, he pinched both sides, showing everyone how squishy Harry'd become during the summer. Despite the spell he was under, Harry still shook when Draco touched his sides. Interested in getting an even stronger reaction out of him, Draco danced his fingers up his sides, thrumming the tips of his fingers up to his ribs. He seemed to be getting closer... Harry's quivering grew more intense as Draco went higher.</p>
<p>	“You haven't spoken a word this whole time,” Draco said, backing away from him. He came around to look Harry in the eyes. “I suppose you wouldn't be able to speak unless I granted you permission. You'll have to forgive me – this is my first time using the spell. Go ahead and speak.”</p>
<p>	“D-Draco!” Harry sputtered, his voice rising with irritation. “You're... You're going to pay for this!”</p>
<p>	“Oh? I could make you forget that this even happened if I wanted to... Behave yourself, Potter.”</p>
<p>	Thankfully, Harry closed his mouth and simply nodded to show that he understood.</p>
<p>	“Now, spread out your arms,” Draco commanded. Harry did so, holding his arms out at his sides, leaving his whole upper body exposed.</p>
<p>	Draco toyed with Harry's lower belly, but there wasn't much of a reaction. Harry only bit his lower lip, trying to hold in his voice. It would have been easy to ask him where he was most ticklish, but Draco liked watching him squirm in anticipation, fearing the moment when he'd discover it on his own. Harry was practically sweating by the time Draco made it up to his chest. His breathing had become rough with the effort to resist laughing. Everyone else also seemed to be holding their breath, leaning forward with intense interest. Even Crabbe and Goyle were standing by, wringing their hands as they watched.</p>
<p>	“N-... No...!” Harry cried suddenly as Draco got closer to his chest.</p>
<p>	“Here?” Draco asked, running the tip of one finger down the sweaty center of his chest.</p>
<p>	Harry remained quiet and averted his eyes. However, he wasn't able to <i>not</i> answer him. “No, that's... Not the spot.”</p>
<p>	“Then what about...” Draco lightly poked the sensitive skin under Harry's arms.</p>
<p>	At once, the breath that Harry had been trying to hold in burst out of his mouth.</p>
<p>	“Ahaha! N-No...! Not there! Anywhere but there!” he cried, his body shuddering and straining with the effort to break free from the spell.</p>
<p>	Pretending to be forgiving, Draco nodded sympathetically and stepped away. Harry hung his head and breathed heavily, seeming apprehensive yet relieved for the moment. As he caught his breath and relaxed, Draco waltzed away and picked up one of the items that he'd brought with him for the occasion.</p>
<p>	When he returned, he showed the item off to the crowd. There were a few hushed gasps and chuckles.</p>
<p>	Turning back to Harry, Draco put two fingers under his chin and lifted his head to look at him. He held up the long, elegant feather for him to see. It was quite a beauty, though Harry didn't seem to share his appreciation for it. There was a distinct look of horror in his eyes as he looked at its delicate, fluffy tip.</p>
<p>	Draco wagged the end of it under Harry's nose.</p>
<p>	“Hha... Hhaa... <i>HaaaCHOO!</i>”</p>
<p>	Draco stepped out of the way a second before Harry sneezed. While Harry was still disoriented and reeling, Draco waved the end of the feather around his collarbones. It was very curious how ticklish his shoulders were. Draco hadn't expected that. Harry struggled, whining unpleasantly.</p>
<p>	As soon as Draco moved it lower, teasing his sides, Harry started feeling it. Despite the curse, his body squirmed uncontrollably, writhing with his arms out as if he were struggling against invisible bonds. The sight of the brave and esteemed Harry Potter struggling so pitifully was enough to get the other students riled up and excited. They wanted more. They wanted to hear him laugh, and so did Draco. Harry wasn't going to be able to hold on for much longer.</p>
<p>	Draco whisked the end of the feather gently below one of Harry's arms. For a second, Harry froze, trying to hold it in. Draco took the feather away to make him think he might be relenting. When he heard Harry sigh, he gave his tender underarm a few more whisks with the feather and was finally rewarded with some of Harry's sweet laughter.</p>
<p>	“Ha...! Ahaha...! Oh no... No, Draco, please! Ahaha... Ha...”</p>
<p>	He pursed his lips and tried to seal his laughter, but it was no use.</p>
<p>	Draco stood in front of him. As he teased under his arm with the feather, he used his other hand to tickle Harry on the other side, lightly using his nails to scratch and graze the skin from his ribs to his armpit. It wasn't long before Harry was howling with laughter, his face red, barely able to breathe from the intensity of the ticklishness.</p>
<p>	“N-Nooo...! I can't! Please! Draco, y-... You don't underst-stand!”</p>
<p>	Curious, Draco paused for a second. He waited, letting Harry catch his breath. He grabbed Harry by the jaw and lifted his face up to look at him.</p>
<p>	“What don't I understand?” he asked.</p>
<p>	“I...” Harry's eyes were damp and glazed. “I'm... I'm too ticklish. Look, I'm sorry. If you guys have a problem with me, then I'm sure we can resolve it in some other way. My cousin used to tickle me and it was always a nightmare. If you keep tickling me, I might pass out or something, and then what are you going to do? M-My friends are waiting for me. They'll get suspicious. If they come over here, then what are you going to do?”</p>
<p>	Draco tapped his foot and narrowed his eyes. “Is that a threat, Potter? Have you forgotten the position you're in? If you were looking for mercy, then that was a poor way of asking for it...”</p>
<p>	“You're right!” Harry said, his voice desperate, eyes wild. “You're right, Draco. If you have your heart set on doing this, then... Could you... Go easy on me?”</p>
<p>	Hm. So Harry knew how to beg. That was interesting.</p>
<p>	That cousin of his must have really messed him up. Perhaps Draco would write to him and ask him for some advice.</p>
<p>	There was also the chance that Harry was bluffing and that he had something up his sleeve. That always seemed to be the case with him. Either way, the pathetic tone of his voice was irritating. It just made Draco want to torment him even more.</p>
<p>	“Rictusempra!”</p>
<p>	With a simple wave of his wand, Harry began to convulse with uncontrollable laughter. The other boys praised Draco's clever application of the tickling charm with approving cheers.</p>
<p>	The Imperius Curse may have already started to wear off under the stress from the tickling. Harry automatically fell to his knees and braced himself with his hands on the floor.</p>
<p>	“Ha! Haha! AHA! Oh no... No! Ahaha... I can't! Draco, please! Aha haha ha...!”</p>
<p>	“How does it feel, Potter? Tell us with as much detail as you can muster.”</p>
<p>	Harry shook his head, but he wasn't able to disobey the order to speak. “It fee- Heee! F-Feels like... Ha haa! It feels like... Ahaha! Like I'm being tickled everywhere! B-By s-... So many hands! Haha ha ha ha...!”</p>
<p>	“<i>Everywhere?</i> That's interesting. Do you remember how you embarrassed me by using the same spell on me in the Dueling Club? Bloody humiliating, that was. It tossed me back at least three meters... You could've given me a concussion. I wouldn't say I'm very ticklish, however. This spell seems to work differently depending on how ticklish you are. For someone as ticklish as you, it must be absolute torture.”</p>
<p>	“It is!” Harry cried. He tossed his head back with a howl of uproarious laughter, showing everyone the helpless tears that were streaming down his face. “I-It's too much! Hah... Ahh... I can't stand it! P-Please...!”</p>
<p>	“But you're laughing so much. Ironic how something so tormenting elicits the same response as something funny or enjoyable. But who am I to say? Maybe a part of you finds this enjoyable. You seem like the masochistic type to me.”</p>
<p>	Harry didn't have a comeback that time. He just looked up at Draco with a pitiful look on his face, utterly broken and lost.</p>
<p>	A pathetic sob left his mouth with his next breath. “I-I feel it everywhere,” he muttered. “Even inside. Hhh-...! Ah! Ahahaaa... Ugh- I f-feel it in my... throat...”</p>
<p>	“Even in your throat?”</p>
<p>	Draco got down on one knee in front of Harry and put a hand around his neck. Lightly, he moved his fingers up and down his neck. Tears streamed down Harry's face as he dug his nails into the carpet, unable to grab Draco's hand to make him stop.</p>
<p>	“Rather than 'The Boy Who Lived', they should start calling you The Most Ticklish Boy Who Ever Lived,” Draco said with a laugh. That one earned him a few groans from the other students. When he glared in their direction, they realized their fault and hesitantly laughed along with him to humor him.</p>
<p>	Grabbing a hand in Harry's hair, Draco gave him a rough yank and pushed him onto his back, leaving him laying in front of everyone.</p>
<p>	“Stay,” he said, commanding him like a dog. He snapped his fingers and Goyle quickly hustled to his side with the rest of his implements. Draco took the collection of brushes from him and held them up in front of Harry. “Alright, Potter, tell me – which of these brushes worries you most?”</p>
<p>	Harry's eyes hesitantly went from one brush to another. He grimaced, clenching his teeth. The tickling curse was still rampaging throughout his body, making difficult for him to do a single thing without laughing.</p>
<p>	“Th... The one... Aah-... Hahaa! With the long bristles!”</p>
<p>	Draco had suspected that that one would be the most displeasing. The brush was made with pony hair. It wasn't the most expensive one, but he knew from the second he laid eyes on it that it was the one that would be best for his purposes. It was light, the touch of its fine bristles as soft and gentle as an angel's whisper.</p>
<p>	He gave Harry's underarm a little flick with the end just to hear him cry out.</p>
<p>	“Ahhh...! Ahaha ha ha HA!”</p>
<p>	“Crabbe. Goyle. Would you mind helping me for a moment?” he asked.</p>
<p>	“Yeah, of course. What do you need?” Goyle asked.</p>
<p>	“Each of you, take a shoe,” Draco said, pointing down. “I don't want to touch Potter's feet with my hands. If he was irresponsible enough to let himself go, then I don't have much faith in his bathing habits.”</p>
<p>	Although they didn't seem pleased to handle the task, they set about it without argument. Each of them removed Harry's shoes and socks, baring his toes for Draco.</p>
<p>	He was only kidding about Harry's hygiene. He followed him around enough to know that he visited the boys' bath regularly, so he wasn't that worried about touching his feet. In truth, he didn't know what he expected, so he was surprised by the lovely pink color at the tips of his toes. The center of his soles were pale and looked surprisingly soft. A part of him wanted to touch them...</p>
<p>	With a lump growing in his throat, Draco grabbed one of Harry's ankles and raised the brush. He wasn't even concerned with the others who were watching anymore. At that moment, it felt like it was just him and Harry. His ears were filled with the gratifying sound of his giggles and laughs and all of the breathy gasps for air in between.</p>
<p>	When he ran the soft brush down the center of Harry's twitching foot, Harry tossed his head back and shouted out loud.</p>
<p>	“AhhhhH! Noooo...!”</p>
<p>	“Hush, Potter! Don't get too loud, now. We wouldn't want any outsiders coming to see what's the matter.”</p>
<p>	He trusted that Harry was going to heed that as a command. Harry shut his jaw tight.</p>
<p>	Keeping his hand around Harry's ankle, Draco rested the back of Harry's heel on his knee and gently ran the tip of the brush around his toes, zigzagging in between each toe. Harry groaned with the effort to hold back his shouts, his teeth chattering, eyes rolling back. Only pained noises made it out from between his lips along with some errant giggles he couldn't control.</p>
<p>	Draco was almost jealous. He wasn't as ticklish as Harry, so he knew he'd never experience what Harry was experiencing. However, just by looking at the suffering look on his face, he felt like he could get an idea. The image of his face covered in tears and snot was going to be burned into his memory, and Draco was going to treasure that memory. If Harry was going to intrusively occupy his thoughts, then Draco wanted to always imagine him with that pitiful face.</p>
<p>	After giving his foot a few more torturous flicks with the soft pony hair brush, he moved to the other foot and gave it the same treatment.</p>
<p>	“Hee hee... Draco... Draco, no- Hee! Ha ha haa... Haa! Ahahaa! Oh no, it's- It's too mu- huh ah ha ha HA!”</p>
<p>	Ah... He couldn't resist anymore.</p>
<p>	Dropping the brush, Draco placed both of Harry's feet in his lap and finally touched them with his fingers. He was surprised that they were just as soft as they looked. His heels felt so smooth and warm. For a boy who grew up in rugged conditions, he had awfully pretty feet. Draco felt like he may have found Harry's only good quality.</p>
<p>	“Do you want me to release you from the Imperius Curse, Potter?” he asked, teasingly running the blunt tip of his nail along the tender edge of one of Harry's soles.</p>
<p>	Harry nodded emphatically. “Please! Th-The tickle charm, too! Aha ha... Please!”</p>
<p>	“No, that one will stay for now. The people want to see you reach your limit. If you promise to be good, however, I'll give you some freedom. It looks awfully painful to be frozen like that...”</p>
<p>	“Yes! Anything! Please remove it!”</p>
<p>	Just to be careful, Draco motioned toward Harry's wand. Goyle picked it up and held it firmly in his strong hands to be sure that Harry wouldn't be able to get it.</p>
<p>	With a little flick of his own wand, Draco released Harry from the control of the Imperius Curse and the lingering effects of the freezing charm. Finally, he was able to move – and <i>move</i>, he did. He couldn't stop flailing about wildly, hugging his middle as he laughed torturously. Crabbe helpfully came over and grabbed his wrists to stop him from thrashing about so much, letting Draco get back to work.</p>
<p>	Harry's chest heaved and his back arched as Draco played with his toes. Harry seemed to be in serious distress, much to Draco's delight and the delight of the other students. He bit his lip and little giggles snuck past his lips as more hot tears of exhaustion rolled down his cheeks.</p>
<p>	Draco lightly scratched between Harry's toes and raked his nails down the middle of his soles.</p>
<p>	“Cry more, Potter!” someone in the crowd shouted.</p>
<p>	“Look at him! He's losing his mind! He can't even speak!”</p>
<p>	“You're the best, Malfoy!”</p>
<p>	What an ego boost. Draco was proud to be putting his talents to use. He knew that there was no one who could torment Harry better than him. From the moment he was born, Harry was destined to be tormented for the rest of his life, and Draco wanted to be the one... Just him. No one else deserved the honor of being the one to make Harry cry and laugh helplessly.</p>
<p>	Harry shook all over, face bright red from his endless laughter. His eyes were getting hazy again, but it wasn't from the Imperius Curse anymore. His ticklishness was really bringing him to the brink.</p>
<p>	“To think that the great Harry Potter could be undone by something as simple as tickling... You truly are pathetic. Ah, but that's what we love about you, Potter!”</p>
<p>	Everyone agreed wholeheartedly. They loved how ticklish and weak Harry was. The next time he annoyed them to the point of frustration, they knew how to handle him.</p>
<p>	Eventually, Harry's laughs started to become more infrequent. His head fell back and his body stopped shaking as much. There was just a slight tremble. Saliva rolled down from the corner of his mouth as his eyes stared mindlessly up at the ceiling.</p>
<p>	Draco let go of him and stood over him proudly. With another flick of his wand, he released him from the tickle charm.</p>
<p>	“Looks like he's had enough.”</p>
<p>	Crabbe let go of Harry and waved a hand in front of his face. “Hello? Anyone home?”</p>
<p>	“Ha... Haha... Uhh... Ughh... Mnn...”</p>
<p>	As the other students began to disperse, Crabbe grabbed Harry's robe off the floor and covered him with it.</p>
<p>	Draco gave him a light kick in the side with the point of his shoe. Even that little contact made Harry squirm. “Pull yourself together, Potter. Didn't you say your friends would come looking for you? Hmph. Maybe they've given up on you.”</p>
<p>	“D-... Draco...”</p>
<p>	“Yes?”</p>
<p>	Harry weakly lifted one of his hands and scrubbed at his face. Slowly, he turned onto his side and pushed himself up. “Um...” He stared blankly at his lap for a moment. He looked up, but he turned his face away again before Draco could understand the feeling in his eyes. “Sorry. Nothing. Never mind.”</p>
<p>	“What was that?” Draco said, leaning closer.</p>
<p>	“Never mind,” Harry repeated.</p>
<p>	“Not that part, you dolt. The other thing.”</p>
<p>	“...Sorry? You just want to hear me apologize?”</p>
<p>	“That's right,” Draco said, grinning proudly, hands on his waist. “I'd like to hear it again sometime. If you ever feel like begging for my forgiveness again... You know how to find me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	Harry shivered.</p>
<p>	Despite the hell he'd been put through, there was something there...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	Perhaps the forbidden curse had awoken something 'forbidden' in him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	Draco turned his back on him with a swish of his robe. He motioned for Crabbe and Goyle to follow him out as he started to walk away.</p>
<p>	“See you around, Potter.”</p>
