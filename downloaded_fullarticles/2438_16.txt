    <p align="justify"> Harry sat in the empty Gryffindor common room with Ginny leaning against her as she worked on some essay Umbridge made her write for talking back <em>once </em>again. Some of her fellow classmates still whisper as she walks down the corridor's, unable to defend herself without someone calling her a liar. Seamus was still mad at her for calling his mother stupid, Well to her defense the entire Ministry is stupid, they turned against the girl they once called their <em>savior. </em>She was so engrossed by her thoughts that she didn't even notice Ron or Hermione enter the room and toss their bags onto the couch.</p>
<p align="justify"> "That <em>bloody</em> women!" Hermione exclaimed sitting by Harry's feet and grabbing a pillow. Ron sat next to her as Hermione continued to rant. "We aren't learning how to defend ourselves! Book work is fun, but in order to learn defense against the dark arts, we need to do hands on work!" Ron looked at her and simply said "Did you just say that book work is <em>fun?"</em> </p>
<p align="justify"> "Honestly Ronald, Hermione made a great point, but the only thing you heard is that <em>book work is fun?</em>" Ginny said, still leaning on Harry.</p>
<p align="justify"> "She's taking over the entire school!"</p>
<p align="justify"> "<em>Harry</em>!" </p>
<p align="justify">  Harry turned towards the fireplace and kneeled down to face the burning logs. "<em>Sirius! what are you doing here?" </em>she whispered as Ron and Herminoe crawled towards them</p>
<p align="justify"><em> "Answering your letter. You said you were worried about Umbridge? What's she doing? Training you kill half breeds?" </em>He replied with disgust in his voice.</p>
<p align="justify"> Ginny joined them with a puzzled look on her face.  </p>
<p align="justify"> "<em>She's not letting us use magic at all!"</em></p>
<p align="justify">
  <em> "well i'm not surprised. The latest intelligence is that fudge doesn't want you trained in combat."</em>
</p>
<p align="justify">The hushed conversation goes on for a while but ends when they hear noise coming from the dorms. "He really is out there isn't he?" Hermione says facing the window as the storm outside gets worse by the minute. "We need to be able to defend ourselves. We need someone who is willing to teach us." She implies looking into Hara's eyes. </p>
<p align="justify"> "Me? I don't know. Half of the school thinks i'm fame hungry and the other half thinks I've gone mad." Hara replied, brushing stray strands out hair out of her eyes. "I can't even walk in the halls without someone shoving me into the walls. What makes you think the kids here are going to listen to me if i teach them how to defend themselves?"</p>
<p align="justify"> "Because you're Harry Potter! You know how to defend yourself against the dark arts! I'm sure loads of Gryffindors will be willing to listen." Ginny says throwing her arms around Hara. "I'm pretty sure Hermione can set everything up!"</p>
<p align="justify">"She's right. Just say the word and i can arrange everything." Hermione confirms looking at Hara with hopeful eyes. </p>
<p align="justify"> Harry pauses for a moment and thinks about it. She knows they need to learn how to defend themselves but she also knows one slip and they could get caught and expelled. She didn't want to risk anyone getting kicked out, but she knows getting kicked out is better than being dead. Sighing Harry agrees and is smothered with hugs and thank yous.</p>
<p align="justify"> Hermione and Ron then retreat back to their dorms as Harry and Ginny return back to the couch.</p>
<p align="justify"> "You're brave. You know that" Ginny says looking up from her paper. Ginny always loved Harry. No matter if the other girl wasn't ready to say it back. She remembers sleepless nights in her second year. She remembers the diary and it's power. She remembers waking up in the chamber and seeing Harry glasses broken, robes torn with a huge gash in her arm. "You need to get out of here okay? Don't worry about me. Ron is waiting for you." She remembers watching the girl fall from her broom while  Dementors flew around the Quidditch pitch. She remembers watching the girl being forcefully torn from Cedric Diggory's dead body. But now, she watches the girl stare back at her with her green eyes that holds so many questions, and her long jet black hair that stands at odd angles. The lighting bolt shaped scar that irritates her when she sleeps is what most people seem to notice when they first see her. </p>
<p align="justify"> Harry smiles at her then brings her in for a kiss. Ginny knew Harry didn't know how to respond to that. But for now, She would let her lips answer her praise.</p>
<p align="justify"> Harry pulls away with the biggest grin on her face and simply starts to sing <em>"Her eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad, Her hair is as dark as a blackboard. I wish she was mine, she's truly divine, the hero who conquered the Dark Lord."</em></p>
<p align="justify"> "Piss off Potter! I was 11!"</p>
<p align="justify"> "11 years old and flirting with someone who you barley talked to over the summer?" Harry fires back </p>
<p align="justify"> "Mum told me to stop staring at you!" Ginny says turning into a deep shade of red</p>
<p align="justify"> "<em>Her eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad-"</em></p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>   "POTTER!"</em>
