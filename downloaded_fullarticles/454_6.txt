          <div class="userstuff"><p>The sun was shining through the few clouds visible in the sky. Harry was on his way to the quidditch pitch, alone, to prepare himself for the upcoming game in a week.</p><p>What he expected was to see other students, players, training or playing on the field, but there was only one. And of all the people who could have crossed Harry's plans for the day, it was Draco Malfoy.</p><p>Harry was already about to leave and meet Ron or Hermione, but as it seemed Malfoy was done practicing anyway. Normally Harry wouldn't stress about it, but it's their final week at Hogwarts and he didn't want to mess it up.</p><p>"Potter" Malfoy said, chill, as he was walking towards Harry. "No friends?" Malfoy realized too late that he was alone on the quidditch pitch himself. </p><p>The sun lit his whole face, which made his skin shimmer in the light, and his eyes more silver than they have ever been. And only then Harry realized what he has never seen on Malfoy before. He stepped forward.</p><p>He had freckles. All over his face, on his nose, on his cheeks and even on his chin and forehead. They were not dark, but very much noticable. </p><p>When Malfoy realized what Harry was looking at, he turned away quickly, murmuring something that Harry didn't catch and turned around once again.</p><p>"What-" Harry was about to ask what he had just done, when he realized that Malfoy's freckles were all gone. </p><p>"Why did you do that?" Harry took the smallest step forward to look him in the face, and Malfoy turned his head "Stop that, Potter,"</p><p>Malfoy took a step backwards, trying to come up with a slur, or something mean to say, Harry guesses, but he started blushing instead.</p><p>"Are you ashamed of your freckles?" Harry asked after thinking about it. It would have made a lot of sense.</p><p>"Don't be stupid, Potter, Malfoys don't have freckles" He titled his chin, "And anyway, don't you have something else to do?" he said, bumping his shoulder when passing him.</p><p>Harry was struck by his action, although it was typically Draco Malfoy to act like this.<br/>
Maybe it was so surprising because he didn't think Malfoy would just leave an embarassing topic at where it had been.</p><p>"Don't remove them, they look beautiful" Harry turned around, watching Malfoy stop a few meters away from him. </p><p>"I like them"  Harry said, and he knew he could have kept it to himself, but he said it anyway, only because he wanted to. Malfoy continued walking towards the castle.</p><p>Right there after he left, Harry thought he had said something stupid, but, from that moment on, whenever he met Draco in the halls of the castle, he saw these tiny beautiful freckles on his face, and smiled to himself.</p></div>
