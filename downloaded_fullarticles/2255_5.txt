          <div class="userstuff"><p>She laughed loudly. A loud, screeching laugh. (Y/N) was not jealous. Ever.</p>
<p>So what was this emotion she was feeling right now?</p>
<p>She just wanted to spend as much time with Draco as Pansy or Blaise. Was that really too much to ask?</p>
<p>"Shh Pansy!" Draco hissed at the girl who was currently laughing so hard he was surprised she hasn't fallen over yet.</p>
<p>"Why are you saying that Draco?" Parkinson wheezed. "She's practically your girlfriend."</p>
<p>The blond haired boy scowled silently as his fellow Slytherin student continued chuckling. Quieter this time.</p>
<p>(Y/N) and he had spoken before. But they weren't even friends. Let alone dating.</p>
<p>Well, he was going to fix that. Soon.</p>
<p>"Pansy if you don't shut up this instant I will hex you so hard that your dead grandmother will feel it," he said calmly.</p>
<p>"Why?" questioned the girl, looking around. Aha! </p>
<p>There, by the fountain was poor, innocent, little (Y/F/N). Oblivious to Draco standing there, blushing.</p>
<p>"Oh! Because there she is!" Pansy said as loudly as she could while obviously pointing in the direction of (Y/N).</p>
<p>"Pansy!" Draco panicked and tried to drag her away.</p>
<p>The commotion grabbed (Y/N)'s attention. She looked up to see Draco Malfoy and his girlfriend Pansy Parkinson messing around a few feet away.</p>
<p>Draco's hair had gotten sort of messy from trying to get Pansy away. It glinted softly in the setting sun.</p>
<p>Sighing loudly she got up from her space, dusted herself off and set off to her dorm.</p>
<p>"(Y/F/N) how nice to see you?" Pansy smiled as the girl passed her.</p>
<p>"Parkinson. Malfoy." the girl acknowledged them, briefly looking into Draco's dazzling grey eyes.</p>
<p>Draco who was still trying to drag Pansy off just nodded and blushed even more.</p>
<p>How was he going to go through with his plan if he couldn't even say one word to the girl?</p>
<p>"Rude." (Y/N) muttered as she walked away, just loud enough for her to hear.</p>
<p>"(Y/L/N)!" Draco yelled, catching up to her. "Glad I caught you."</p>
<p>"Hello, Draco. Why is that?" she questioned, suspicious that something was going on.</p>
<p>She rarely spoke to the brilliantly blond-haired boy.</p>
<p>"I just wanted to ask if you could help me study for the potions test next week?"</p>
<p>"Malfoy. What are you playing at? Is this a prank?" (Y/N) asked.</p>
<p>"What?" the blond said, utterly confused.</p>
<p>"You're the best at potions. Top of the class. Except maybe Granger. Why would you need my help?" </p>
<p>"Fine. Then maybe I could help you?" he offered, running his hand through his hair as (Y/N) tried not to pass out.</p>
<p>"No, thanks. I don't need your help," she answered, slightly offended.</p>
<p>As she started walking to herbology he continued.</p>
<p>"Maybe I can walk you to lesson? Or to dinner later?" he suggested.</p>
<p>"Why? Don't you have plans with your girlfriend?"</p>
<p>After a confused look from Draco, she whispered. "Parkinson?"</p>
<p>He just laughed.</p>
<p>"No need to be a jerk about it! I get it you're in a happy relationship and I'm not! Happy now?" she yelled before setting off down the corridor.</p>
<p>Draco came to his senses quickly after and grabbed her arm gently.</p>
<p>"No! No! That's not it at all." he explained. "She's not my girlfriend. Honest."</p>
<p>"Oh. I didn't know. Sorry." (Y/N) replied. She still had a chance. "So why were you asking to walk me to dinner and stuff?"</p>
<p>"I'm just trying to find reasons to keep us talking, honestly. So that I could ask you something."</p>
<p>"Ask away."</p>
<p>"Would...Would you..."</p>
<p>"Yeah? Go on." she prompted.</p>
<p>"Would you be my girlfriend?" Draco mumbled.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I knew you were going to say that. This was stupid. I shouldn't have asked. I knew...Wait! What?"</p>
<p>"Yes!" (Y/N) giggled.</p>
<p>He lifted her up and spun her around as they both laughed.</p>
<p>"Thank you (Y/N)," Draco whispered before kissing her passionately.</p>
<p>When they pulled away all he said was "I guess my plan worked."</p>
<p>This made his girlfriend laugh.</p></div>
