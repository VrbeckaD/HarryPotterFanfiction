  <em>Hello Everyone! This is just a quick intro. Most of the information I want you guys to be aware of before I start writing is already written in the summary. I just have to write here in order for this first part to post. Thank you in advance to everyone that will be commenting prompts. I hope you all enjoy these one shots. Please make sure to post your prompts in the comments of this first part because I will regularly be checking it and writing them as I go. I'll only write those that get requested. Remember, nothing is off limits but I may need to change the rating and/or the warnings as certain one shot themes may be requested that would require me to do so in order for them to stay a part of this book of one shots. Thank you in advance for all the love and support I'm sure you'll be shooting my way, I really appreciate it. </em>
