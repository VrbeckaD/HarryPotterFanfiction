    <p>It was a warm day towards the end of the year, and the 5<sup>th</sup> year students were studying hard for their O.W.L.s. Most had stayed indoors, but some had decided to study outside.</p><p>Under a tree was Severus Snape, hunched over a book so his greasy black hair fell forward. Next to him a student lay on the grass, dressed in a T-shirt and shorts, with his robe tucked under his head. His blond hair, matching Severus’s length of hair, was kept together with a simple elastic band.</p><p>“Andy, you really should be studying.”</p><p>“I probably should,” Andy replied, “but maybe there is a reason why the Sorting Hat decided I was better off in Hufflepuff than Ravenclaw. It was all like: ‘oh, you would do well in Ravenclaw’, and then I was like ‘that sounds like hard work’ and then the Hat went: ‘very well. Hufflepuff!’… I love that Hat.” He took a moment to look at his studying friend. “Why don’t you come sit in the sun for a change?”</p><p>Severus glanced to Andy, shook his head and turned his attention back on his book. “Do you even know what you want to become later?” he asked.</p><p>“I haven’t got the slightest idea,” Andy admitted, closing his eyes again, “but whatever it will be, I will be awesome at it. I will be the best wizard there ever was! I’m surprised they haven’t given me the Order of Merlin yet.”</p><p>“If you want that boast to be true one day, you will have to work for it.”</p><p>“Someone as amazing as me?” Andy asked with a chuckle and only briefly opened his eyes to catch Severus’s annoyed glance. “Don’t worry, I studied. And to be honest, I really don’t care about the Order of Merlin.” When Severus didn’t respond Andy looked up and then followed his gaze. There was Lily, talking with a few female friends.</p><p>“She’ll never forgive me for calling her a Mudblood yesterday,” he muttered bitterly.</p><p>“She’ll come around and notice what a great guy you are,” Andy promised him. “You’ve been friends for so long; it may have given a dent, but I don’t think the damage is irreparable.” When some familiar laughter reached his ears, Andy turned his attention to a group of young men, some Gryffindors who seemed to enjoy bullying Severus. And people claimed all evil wizards came from Slytherin…</p><p>The leader of the group, James Potter, tried to impress Lily, but his efforts were fruitless. “They used your own spell against you and humiliated you,” Andy commented, moving his attention from the Gryffindors to Severus. “I can’t believe you’ll let it slide like that.”</p><p>“You think it will make them stop bullying me if I retaliate? Potter can’t do anything wrong, he’s their champion.” His voice dribbled with disgust.</p><p>“I will curse him for you, just say the word.”</p><p>“Don’t bother.” Severus looked at Andy. “And please don’t spread the word I invented the Levicorpus Jinx. There is a reason I used a pseudonym.”</p><p>“Your secret is safe with me.” Andy closed his eyes again, enjoying the sun for a while longer. He had been studying and felt confident in the O.W.L. exams that had yet to come, so for now he just wanted to take it easy and enjoy the day.</p><p>A gang of Slytherins approached and Andy looked up. They asked Severus to join them, who vacillated for a moment, then nodded and walked away with them. Andy watched him leave. Of course Severus wanted to be with his Slytherin friends, too; he couldn’t blame him. But he wouldn’t sit there by himself either, so he got up, put his robe back on, cursing its existence on the warm day, and went out to find some other Hufflepuffs to spend some time with. Once more he thanked the Sorting Hat for not putting him in Ravenclaw; he hadn’t seen a single fifth-year Ravenclaw outside today. They were most likely all either cooped up in their House, or in the library.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>During their sixth year, when Severus wasn’t spending with his Slytherin friends, which was most of the time, he looked for Andy’s company. Even though the Hufflepuff didn’t seem to take his studies very seriously, he always seemed to do well on tests. He recalled Andy once saying that just because he hadn’t seen him study didn’t mean that he hadn’t studied.  </p><p>They were on their way to Study of Ancient Runes, the only class they had together, and Andy was talking about what he had learned in the class prior to this, but Severus seemed far from interested.</p><p>“Why are you even taking Muggle Studies?” There couldn’t have been more disdain in Severus’s voice even if he tried.</p><p>“Because they are intriguing,” Andy said. “They can’t rely on magic like us and still they do reasonably well for themselves.”</p><p>The derogatory sound coming from Severus clearly illustrated how he felt about that. “I don’t know why I even spend time with you.”</p><p>“Because of my dashing good looks!”</p><p>Severus narrowed his eyes. “Try again.”</p><p>“I know…” Andy sighed. “I don’t have green eyes. If I did then I’m sure-”</p><p>“Careful now,” Severus interjected.</p><p>“Speaking of green eyes, have you asked Lily out yet?”</p><p>“She… carefully avoided the question when I tried to ask if she wanted to go to Hogsmeade together. She refuses to talk with me since the day I called her a Mudblood, but…” he made a helpless gesture with his arm. “I love her, Andy. And I want her to know I’m sorry, and that she’ll see me as more than someone she knows from her childhood.”</p><p>Andy put a comforting hand on the shoulder of his friend. “As long as she doesn’t say she doesn’t love you or starts dating someone else, you have a chance. Let’s just go look at some dusty old runes and be amazing at that! And tomorrow we will go to Hogsmeade together.”</p><p>“I’m going to study.”</p><p>“I will drag you there if I have to.” There was a daring look in Andy’s eyes, a look Severus had learned to recognise.</p><p>“Fine, I’ll go,” Severus sighed, knowing his friend wouldn’t let him study in peace now that his mind was set on going to the village. It was something he’d rather do with Lily, but as she seemed to be going with her friends… Severus sighed again. Maybe he would be able to show Lily how good he was, she’d definitely want him if he could prove his worth.</p><p> </p><p>The next day they went into the village and entered Hog’s Head. Fewer students came here, but it was a place where Severus’s friends went to. Since Andy didn’t mind where they would drink, as long as he could have a drink with Severus, he went to the Hog’s Head with him. Soon they sat at a table and both had a butterbeer in front of them. They talked about their classes when Lucius Malfoy suddenly stood in front of their table. “Andrew,” he greeted Andy as he locked eyes with him.</p><p>“Lucy!” Andy replied with a broad grin which grew when Lucius’s mouth twitched at the nickname. “I haven’t seen you since you graduated from Hogwarts! I hope you have been well.”</p><p>“Don’t call me that,” Lucius hissed.</p><p>“And I prefer to be called Andy, so…”</p><p>Lucius’s mouth twitched again, but he gave a slight nod. “Point taken. Well then, Andy, my family will be organising a party and as a pure-blood, I want to invite you. Severus is also coming.”</p><p>“I heard about that,” Andy said. “It’s very kind of you, but I will have to decline. Me and my pure-blood brother are going on a trip. I’d invite you, but it sounds like you will be busy with a party, so…”</p><p>Lucius bent over the table. “Don’t decline it so lightly, Bansing. This is the time you should be forging alliances that matter.”</p><p>“I will keep it in mind,” Andy promised him and watched him walk away, his eyes darkening. “That pure-blood nonsense again,” he muttered when he was certain Malfoy was out of earshot. He would have preferred to be invited because they wanted him, not because he happened to have a wizard and a witch as parents, who also happened to have wizarding parentage.</p><p>“At least you are one,” Severus replied. “It’s a good thing. You should be proud of it.”</p><p>“And that is coming from you? Wizards coming from a mixed background or Muggle parents can be great wizards. There are plenty of pure-bloods who get bad scores on their O.W.L.s and you, with your mixed blood, are an intelligent and talented wizard.”</p><p>“Will you not mention my background again?” Severus hissed. “Lucius is right, you should join us.”</p><p>“I’m not much of a group person, so I will decline his offer. I disagree with his views on Muggles or Muggle-borns.” Andy shook his head as he stared into his drink. “This pure-blood supremacy is not something I want to be a part of.”<br/><br/>“Be careful, people might think of you as a filthy blood traitor.”</p><p>Andy frowned briefly at him and he shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t care what people think of me. And neither should you.” The two stared at each other until Andy broke eye contact and drank from his butterbeer. “It’s a shame you didn’t take up Care of Magical Creatures. It’s hard to see the differences of each other’s background when covered in centaur manure together.”</p><p>“I don’t see the appeal of that class.”</p><p>“No, you like your potions and dark magic, I know. And you’re good at it too.”</p><p>“You’re almost as good as me when it comes to Defence Against the Dark Arts,” Severus mentioned</p><p>“Almost. But I’m better at Charms. And History of Magic.”</p><p>“I don’t even take history.”<br/><br/>“See? Even if I’m the worst of my class, I’ll still be better than you.”</p><p>“I somehow doubt you’re the worst of your class if you’re in the top five of Ancient Runes.”</p><p>Andy didn’t comment on that; he just winked and sipped from his drink. A rare smile appeared on the face of Severus as he too drank from the Butterbeer.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Even though Andy tried to help Severus win the love of his life, even going so far as trying to set up a date with Lily, it didn’t help. In their seventh year Lily started dating James Potter. In the end, she was never able to forgive Severus for calling her a Mudblood. She saw it as proof of how he viewed her ‘kind’ and that he had chosen his path. Of course she wasn’t wrong; Andy knew that. He too had tried to talk him out of joining the Death Eaters, but the Dark Arts appealed to Severus and he was drawn to the power of that group like a moth to a flame.</p><p>Severus watched Lily and James holding hands as they walked through the snowy streets of Hogsmeade, bitterness etched on his face. “Out of all people, why Potter?”</p><p>“How about I enchant a frog to climb up under his robe and bite him in his arse,” Andy suggested.</p><p>“Pranks won’t solve anything,” Severus spat. “If Lily is happy with him, then I won’t try to break them up. Her happiness… is more important.” He noticed some of his Slytherin friends and stepped in their direction. “I wonder why…” he began with a bitter voice, “it’s so hard to love me.”</p><p>“It’s really not,” Andy said and watched as Severus turned around to look at him. “If I can, I’m sure someone else can too.” He smiled when he saw how Severus tried, but hopelessly failed, to determine how he felt about that statement. “Your friends are waiting,” he said, gesturing with his head to the group of Slytherins. “I’ll see you back at Hogwarts.”</p><p> </p><p>As Andy had said, he returned to Hogwarts. Alone. Why was he so drawn to Severus Snape? Where Severus was pessimistic, he was an optimist. And they had disagreed on several occasions about Muggles and pure blood. Not to mention how he had witnessed Severus being drawn to dark magic. And yet, the way he took his studies seriously, his intelligence, it showed he had lots of potential. He certainly wasn’t evil in nature; James Potter would have mysteriously died by now if that had been the case. On the contrary, Severus was capable of a deep love many wouldn’t understand.</p><p>He recalled watching Severus in their fourth year once, sitting alone. Something about that self-chosen solitude had stirred something inside him. Andy had joined Severus and that had been the beginning of their friendship, even though Severus had seemed annoyed more than anything when Andy had first intruded his solitude. In the beginning he had tolerated his presence, but somewhere along the way Severus had opened up to him.</p><p> </p><p>After dinner in the Great Hall, Andy went on his way to his House, but when he heard Severus call his name, he stopped and waited for him.</p><p>“Why did you say what you said to me in the village?” Severus asked, poking Andy’s chest with a bony finger. “Was that some attempt to cheer me up?”</p><p>There was only one thing he had said that could make Severus react like this. “No,” he stated, putting a hand to his side as he took on a casual pose. “The offer of the biting frog was an attempt to cheer you up. You asked a question and I answered it. You are the one who wanted to know if it was difficult to love you and I say it’s not. And I can speak from experience.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“You have to be more specific.”</p><p>Severus grabbed Andy’s arm and dragged him to a more secluded place to talk. “Every dance that was held at school, you attended it with a girl.”</p><p>“Of course, I didn’t want to go by myself. And I don’t know if you have noticed, but we have some good-looking girls in Hufflepuff.”</p><p>“Then how can you say you love… me?”</p><p>“Because I do?”</p><p>Why?”</p><p>Andy rubbed the back of his neck as he tried to find a satisfactory answer for Severus. “Why do you love Lily?” he asked.</p><p>Severus blinked at the question, trying to come up with an answer.</p><p>“Exactly.” Andy scratched his head and sighed. “Look, I don’t know why I love you. I can certainly name a couple of things about you I like, but loving you was never a conscious decision, I just do. And I’m not asking you to return that love. I know who your heart belongs to. But I will be there for you if you need me, okay?”</p><p>Severus didn’t know what to say, but he nodded. And after Andy smiled, winked, and walked away, Severus stayed where he was, watching his friend go. But he didn’t want him to leave and he ran forward to grab Andy’s arm.</p><p>“I…” he began as Andy’s grey-blue eyes settled on him. “I’m not gay.”</p><p>“No, how you felt about Lily clearly showed that. But I’m not convinced you’re straight either.”</p><p>Severus blinked, releasing Andy’s arm. “Why do you say that?”</p><p>“Are you attracted to women in general, or just Lily? Because every time we talked about boys and girls, you seemed rather indifferent to it all.” He put a hand on Severus’s cheek. “It would be good if you would start dating someone else instead of longing for someone you can’t have. It might take your mind off her.”</p><p>“I’m not ready…”</p><p>“Of course you’re not. You’re still hurt over Lily and that is normal. Just don’t close your heart to everyone, okay?” He leaned forward, looking deep into Severus’s eyes, and pressed a gentle kiss on his lips when he didn’t back away. “Don’t be afraid to love.”</p><p>“You?”</p><p>“Me, you, a girl from your house. I don’t care, as long as you are happy.” He leaned forward so he could whisper in his ear. “The Death Eaters won’t make you happy, please don’t go down that path.” As he took some distance again he smiled at Severus. “If it’s not love you want but just a good time,” he began, the smile turning into a grin. “I’m down for that too. You know where to find me.” With a wink he walked away and he heard Severus walk away too, most likely back to his own House.</p><p>He still felt the kiss on his lips... it only made him want to do that again, but he couldn’t. It would be too soon; Severus would need time to come to terms with his unrequited love for Lily. Andy sighed; how he knew that feeling. It stung knowing he would never really have him, even if he would come to him. Severus would never stop loving Lily.</p>
