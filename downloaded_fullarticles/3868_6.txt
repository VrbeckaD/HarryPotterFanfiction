    <p>Sirius was supposed to be studying for his very important Divination test. He had successfully studied for the last two hours; but, his focus could only last so long. Besides, a marvelous distraction had appeared. Sirius had been reviewing his notes like a good student when a thump and a soft curse pulled his attention away from his very interesting textbook. He looked over just in time to see a male bending down to pick up a heavy looking leather-bound off the floor. The black school trousers tightened across his ass allowing Sirius to get an eye-full of round cheeks. The male remained facing away from Sirius as he stood, giving Sirius time to assess the situation. There were three other books on the table relating to Potions. The male was lean with brown hair that looked soft and well-maintained. Sirius diverted his eyes as the male turned to take his seat. Waiting until he could hear pages turning, Sirius peaked at the male through a curtain of black hair. His face looked soft, especially compared to the angular specter Sirius was used to seeing in the mirror. A slim neck connected to a round chin and rose petal lips, which were pursed in concentration. The nose sloped in a delicate manner, looking almost feminine paired with long eyelashes and arched eyebrows. The male would have been entirely inviting if not for the long scars that swept downward from the left side of his face. One cut across the bridge of his nose, while a second cut through his bottom lip. Averting his eyes back to his notes, Sirius tapped the pages lightly. The male was obviously a Gryffindor, as he was in Gryffindor Tower, but Sirius had never seen him before. He couldn't be a First Year. No First Year would need books about advanced healing potions. Sirius flipped his book closed carelessly, the snap drawing the male's attention. Green eyes briefly met Sirius's before retreating back to the text before him. Sirius took a moment to appreciate the way long, pale fingers cradled the quill. Sirius could have plucked the quill out of the male's hand without resistance. he was tempted to try it, just to see how the male would react, but withheld himself.</p><p>Finally forcing his feet to move, Sirius made his way to the dormitory he shared with his two best friends, James Potter and Peter Pettigrew, and Frank Longbottom. Not that Frank spent any more time than he needed to around them. As expected James and Peter were in the room hunched over a thick book whispering. Sirius dumped his book in his trunk before joining his friends on James' bed. "Do either of you know of a Gryffindor with scars on his face?" Sirius made a sweeping motion with his hand across his face.</p><p>"Lupin!" Peter squeaked.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Remus Lupin, that's who you're talking about."</p><p>"What year is he in?"</p><p>"Ours. He's in my Herbology class. Bloody brilliant that one is, always has his nose in a book."</p><p>"Why are you asking about Lupin?" James asked, setting his book aside.</p><p>"I saw him studying in the commons when I was down there. I figured I would have remembered him." Sirius shrugged ignoring the troublesome looks his two friends were exchanging.</p><p>"He keeps to himself for the most part. I don't think I've ever seen him talk to anyone. He's very awkward."</p>
