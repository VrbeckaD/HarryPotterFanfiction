    <p>Headmaster Albus Dumbledore's Office, 1976.</p>
<p>
  <em>They had been punished often enough. Peter Pettigrew should not have expected the watery weight of guilt and fear low in his gut. It was a familiar scene; he was sitting in front of Headmaster Dumbledore’s desk, with James Potter and Sirius Black seated beside him. A bright fire was dancing in the hearth of the office, filling it with warmth. James was flushed with exertion and shame, but Sirius seemed unaffected. His arm was draped lazily over the back of the chair; he tossed his head and looked up at Dumbledore.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“I didn’t tell Sniv-Snape to do anything,” Sirius shrugged. “He’s been on about Remus for years—surely you know that, Sir.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“I’m afraid that is not the matter at hand, Mr. Black,” Dumbledore said gravely. His silvery beard glimmered in the firelight. “He maintains that you took advantage of his…interest in Mr. Lupin’s monthly comings and goings, and purposefully offered him information with the intention to cause him harm.” He studied Sirius’s face carefully, but Sirius was all practiced impassiveness. Peter noticed James’s hands clenching and unclenching on his knees. His gaze was focused in his lap—Peter could see his jaw working under the sweaty skin.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Peter tensed as the headmaster turned to him. Peter had never been called to Dumbledore’s office before. Sure, he’d lost house points for cursing other students in the hallways, or for being out of bed past curfew, and especially for the old Bait and Switch plan, but the trouble had never been this serious.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Dumbledore gave Peter an appraising look and must have been satisfied by Peter’s abject terror, because his eyebrows lifted almost imperceptibly. He redirected his attention to Sirius and leaned back to prop his elbows on the arms of the purple, wing-backed chair. “Thankfully, Mr. Potter had an acute attack of conscience and chose to save Mr. Snape from a potentially terrible fate.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Still, Sirius said nothing. The glow of the fireplace reflected in Headmaster Dumbledore’s eyes, which had gone strangely hard and cold. A muscle in his jaw tensed. “Mr. Black, allow me to take a moment to explain something to you. I have made sure not to confirm or even address Mr. Snape’s suspicions about Mr. Lupin. If the truth about your friend’s condition were to leave this office, hundreds of letters would be pouring into my office, petitioning his expulsion.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>For the first time, Sirius’s cool demeanor slipped; he looked uneasy. Dumbledore nodded knowingly. “I suppose that did not cross your mind while you were planning this…prank. I also suspect that if it were discovered that I admitted a werewolf into Hogwarts, my own leadership abilities would be called into question. Many would call for my removal, as they would for Mr. Lupin’s.” </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Peter felt ashamed. It hadn’t occurred to him that Dumbledore’s influence was confined within the Hogwarts gates. He had always seemed omnipotent, full of influence no matter what he set his mind to.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Furthermore, you put one of my students in mortal danger. Mr. Snape could have lost his life, or could have been forced to live with the very same affliction that your friend is suffering from.” Sirius swallowed, the color in his cheeks rising. “Oh good, we seem to be making some progress. Might I also remind you that you exploited your friend’s condition without his knowledge or consent?”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Sirius looked a bit nauseated, but didn’t break eye contact. After a few long moments, Dumbledore spoke again. “I want to put you somewhat at ease—you will not be expelled. I have no interest in drawing attention to these events. However, Mr. Black, you will be serving detention with Mr. Filch every Saturday, Tuesday, and Thursday until the end of term. I hardly imagine anyone will question that.” Peter was surprised to hear the touch of spite in Dumbledore’s voice. Perhaps he had imagined it. “You may go.” </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>All three of them rose to leave, but Dumbledore raised a hand. “Mr. Black may go.” Peter felt his stomach turn as Sirius strode out. “Mr. Pettigrew,” Dumbledore began, peering wearily over his spectacles. “I hope this will teach you not to follow blindly where you know you ought not to go. Do not let the invincibility of youth and the security you may feel around your friends cloud your better judgment." Peter flushed and nodded numbly.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Mr. Potter, as much as I value your actions tonight, I don’t think I need to tell you that these events cannot and will not be spoken of again.” Dumbledore met Peter’s eyes as well. “Despite your valiance, however, I want you to take every word I spoke to Mr. Black into your own heart. Perhaps it is time to examine why it was a guilty conscience that motivated your rescue of Mr. Snape rather than an interest the well-being of a fellow student. Next time, let’s try not to cut it so close. Good night."</em>
