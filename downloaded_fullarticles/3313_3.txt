    <p>The store shook from the stampede of people that pushed through the doors the moment he had unlocked them. They weren't usually this busy so early in the day but they had new 'Pink Floyd' merch and fans had been waiting outside the store for way longer than reasonable to ensure that they got their hands on some. Stepping back, to avoid being plowed down, Sirius released a heavy sigh through his nose. The day had only just begun and he was already exhausted. Suddenly a sharp pain spiked through his foot and before he could figure out the cause he was rammed into a rack of 'Rolling Stones' T-shirts that were set up behind him.</p><p>"Watch it!" Sirius glared at the girl who'd shoved him. She was tall and slender with striking features. She had long auburn hair, her bangs were cut straight across her forehead. He looked down at her footwear to find thick heavy black boots. No wonder his foot was aching. Not to his surprise, the girl only gave him a once over and rolled her violent green eyes, which were cloaked in heavy dark eye makeup, before stomping away without a word. Gritting his teeth Sirius turned on his heel and rammed into another figure, this one taller and definitely masculine. Patience wavering, Sirius was about to lash out until he saw who it was.</p><p>"Blimey, James! Where are you going in such a rush?"</p><p>His co-worker and brother from another mother gave him an apologetic, but charismatic, crooked grin. James quickly adjusted his thick frames, which had begun to slip down his nose.</p><p>"Did you catch the name of that girl back there?" James asked as he ran a hand through his dark hair, making it look even more as if a tornado had just gone through it. As blatantly obnoxious and pretentious as he found his 'I-don't-even-have-to-try-to-look-this-good' hairstyle, the ladies fell over themselves to get their hands in it.</p><p>Sirius shook his head and made a face. "The redhead?"</p><p>His best mate's hazel eyes widened with warning and James hastily leaned past Sirius to fold 'Wings' shirts. Looking over his shoulder Sirius saw that their manager had poked her head out from her office door. Her lips were pursed as she looked around the store searchingly. Then she caught sight of them.</p><p>"The both of you get your arses over to the front and help the customers already!" A few people looked over to see what was going on. "Mister Potter I don't care how far back your parents and I go, I will fire you. And that goes for yourself as well Mister Black."</p><p>Cringing a bit at his last name, Sirius and James hightailed it to the front desk. Sure enough there was already a line of impatient teens and young adults.</p><p>"Do you think she means that," James asked Sirius. "About firing us I mean?"</p><p>Sirius scoffed as he started helping the first costumer. "It's McGonagall," he raised his eyebrows. "Have you ever heard her make a joke?"</p><p>James grimaced. "I haven't."</p><p>"Then that should be answer enough." Sirius bagged five identical 'Rush' shirts for a young boy and five more of the new 'Pink Floyd' hoodies.</p><p>"So you didn't catch that hotties name?" James asked again.</p><p>"No, and she wasn't even that good looking." A lie. The redhead had been quite attractive however, Sirius really did love 5to tease his best friend.</p><p>James, who was helping another customer fired back, "Siri, please, even a gaybie like yourself couldn't deny that she was heavenly."</p><p>Sirius pouted and gave James a heavy death glare as he scanned a 'Led Zeplin' dress for an older looking girl. "Just because I like blokes and not chicks doesn't mean I'm blind and can't spot out an attractive girl. Also, if you're into feisty redheads whatever, but I'm warning you, this one had fire burning in her eyes."</p><p>James shrugged in non chalance. "You know I like them independent and fierce."</p><p>Attempting, and failing, to not roll his eyes Sirius managed to at least not guffaw. James would flirt with anyone who had a vagina, independent and fierce or not.</p><p>Keeping his cool throughout the morning Sirius helped cranky hormonal customer after customer. Each time a boy with a piercing somewhere other than an ear or a girl with an eccentric tattoo grouched about the price of the cloths or how there weren't enough change rooms Sirius found himself wondering why he still worked here. The truth? He needed the money to pay for tuition and apartment bills. Well, not really, the Potters (James' parents who had practically adopted him a few years ago) were loaded and had made it clear to him that they had no issue helping him out. However, the problem was that he still felt guilty and hated having to depend on them, he wanted to be able to support himself. He was an adult for Christ's sake. He had to figure his life out. So he had applied and been accepted as an employee at a store that sold band merchandise with James. The other boy had decided it would be an interesting experience to have a part time job. Sirius suspected he had the Potters to thank for him getting accepted, considering how well they knew Minerva McGonagall, the store manager. So now he and James had morning shifts on Saturdays and then also worked alternating afternoons and evenings on week days when they didn't have class.</p><p>A clatter broke him from his thoughts. Turning, Sirius saw that James had dropped the pen he'd been twirling between his fingers and was staring at the obnoxious redhead from earlier. As if she were used to gaping boys she simply cocked an auburn eyebrow and placed her items on the table. Smirking at his friends shocked face Sirius turned away from James, whose cheeks were tinted pink.</p><p>"Potter, James Potter." Sirius heard his friend introduce himself with what he was sure was just barely mustered confidence.</p><p>"Pleasure," the girl muttered. However, it evidently was not as she didn't even fake a smile. Sirius tried, more or less, not to eavesdrop but it truly was far too tempting.</p><p>"So... you like 'Pink Floyd'?" James attempted conversation and Sirius saw out of the corner of his eye that she was buying the stores latest 'Pink Floyd' shirt design the store had ordered in.</p><p>"It's not for me," she replied in a curt tone of voice. Sirius scanned an 'AC/DC' sweater for a girl with a dozen facial piercings.</p><p>"Hang on I didn't catch your name," called James. Sirius peered up and saw the redhead leaving.</p><p>"I never offered it." She grinned and left.</p><p>Sirius watched James gaze wistfully after her, well more her ass. The other boy's shoulders caved once she was gone.</p><p>"Someone's been lovestruck." Sirius smirked. James groaned and looked away from the stores exit. Usually when a girl turned him down, which didn't happen often, James would simply shrug it off. Not this time though. Sirius gave a dramatic yawn and elbowed James in the rib. "I'm going to take my lunch break now. You okay to man the fort?"</p><p>"Sure mate," James responded glancing around the significantly calmer store.</p><p>"Alright, I'll be back in like a half hour or so." Sirius pulled on his vintage black leather jacket and blew a long strand of hair away from his eyes before departing.</p><p>-x-</p><p>A new cozy little caf√© had opened recently down the street and he decided to check it out. Once in line Sirius inwardly groaned upon seeing who was standing in front of him. The redhead.</p><p>"Hey Lily," the barista greeted her warmly. <em>So she's a regular</em>, Sirius assumed since the barista knew her name. "What can I get for you?"</p><p>"Hey Rem," she replied without a hint of the attitude from earlier, sounding quite chipper. "I'll take a tall vanilla latte."</p><p>"Nice choice. That'll be 1.76 pounds," the barista told her. Lily dug around in her black wallet for a while before she extracted the exact amount of change. "Your order will be up in a mo," the barista told her.</p><p>"When does your shift end?"</p><p>"Not for few hours but I can take my break in a minute or two."</p><p>"Cool, I'll wait at a table."</p><p>Moving up in the line he realized it was his turn to order. "Hey just a medium hot chocolate please," Sirius told the barista. He did a double take. Bloody. Fucking. Hell. The barista. Wow, okay, so he was hot. The other boy looked to be about Sirius' age, twenty three, with fair skin an undercut and locks of sandy brown curls that grew as a ruffled mess on his head. Was he ever tall too, 6,2 Sirius would guess. Sirius would be lying if he said he didn't have a weak spot for tall boys. Those thin curved lips, Sirius knew he must be staring, those lips that were slightly parted...and moving...like he was talking. Shit!</p><p>"Sorry. What was that?" Sirius tore his eyes from the boys lips up to his eyes.</p><p>The boy smiled politely. "I was asking if you wanted whipped cream?"</p><p>Sirius nodded rapidly, feeling shaken and a bit breathless. "Yeah, yes! Er-yes I would."<br/> Good God, those soft brown eyes, it wasn't fair. But perhaps the boys most striking feature were the thin white scars, one running diagonally across his face and the other, smaller one on his jaw. He wondered briefly what the story was behind them.</p><p>"Could I get your name?" The boy asked holding up a cup.</p><p>"Oh um," Sirius flushed, "Sirius."</p><p>The other boy's thick eyebrows creased. "Yeah, I'm serious."</p><p><em>How red is my face right now?</em> He wondered. "My name is Sirius."</p><p>For a moment the other boy just stared. Then he scribbled something on the cup in black sharpie. "That'll be 1.18 pounds."</p><p>Sirius dropped the money onto the counter.</p><p>"Gottcha!" The young man smiled and Sirius had to remind himself how to breathe. "Have a good day."</p><p>"Ahem," the person behind Sirius cleared their throat. Bloody hell he'd been staring again. He wasn't sure whose face was redder, his or the baristas. Looking away Sirius apologized under his breath to a lady behind him who looked a bit like a fat little toad.</p><p>When Sirius got to the end of the counter he waited impatiently for his order. A heart beat later a second barista, a squat young boy with watery blue eyes called out, "medium hot chocolate for...serious?"</p><p>Sirius grinned and stepped forward. The squat runty man's eyebrows drew together. Quizzically his eyes darted from the cup to Sirius then back to the cup before he finally handed Sirius his beverage and bustled away.</p><p>He took a seat at a booth that was close enough to the cashier to have a clear view of the attractive barista. He subtly watched the tall boy finish serving the long line of customers. Maybe he was imagining things, but Sirius thought he saw the other boy glance over at him a couple times. Then the tall boy patted the shorter barista on the shoulder and started untying his black apron. The boy, Sirius thought he remembered the redhead calling him Rem, was wearing a large grey sweater and jeans beneath his work attire. A surge of courage shot through Sirius and he stood up, about to make his way over to the attractive boy, planning to introduce himself. However, the redhead from earlier popped up out of nowhere and wrapped her arms around the tall boy's neck. "I've missed you so much! How are you, darling?"</p><p><em>Darling?</em> Sirius froze in his tracks and watched as Rem, if that really was his name, smiled brightly down at the girl.</p><p>"It's great to see you too, Lil."</p><p>"Don't avoid my question mister. How are you?" He heard genuine worry in her voice and her expression was taunt with anxiety.</p><p>The tall boy rolled his eyes at the girl's evident concern. "I'm doing fine."</p><p>Sirius caught on to the body language and the way the two of them were getting on, it was clear that they were a couple. He sighed to himself and threw out his empty cup as he left the cafe. All the good ones were either straight or taken. Apparently, in this case, it was both.</p><p>-x-</p><p>Two weeks. That's how long Remus had managed to avoid Lily this time. After the accident he'd moved back in with his mum. It was only supposed to be for a couple weeks but by now it had been more like a couple months. Now he had to start all over at day one. But first he'd have to get through this meet up. She'd cornered him at work and he'd had no where to go. Remus wasn't sure how Lily had found out about his job at the caf√©, he hadn't told her about it. It was probably his mum. She was going to replace him as Lily's best friend any day now with all the time the two of them were spending together, bonding over their worry for him. It was such a nuisance, coming home just to walk in to see them sitting together in the living room having tea and trying to get him to sit down and join them so they could try and pester him into talking about things he really didn't want to talk about. It was incredibly irritating to hear his mum whispering into the phone to Lily about how he was doing and how she wasn't sure how to help him. They both nagged him about his vampirish dislike for the sun, how he needed to leave the house more often or at least open the blinds and let in the nice fresh air. He hated the troubled looks he caught his mum wearing when she watched him, hated how she fretted over him as if he was a child. He'd just about had it. He'd have lost it with her a long time ago if it hadn't been for the overwhelming and all-consuming guilt.</p><p>"So what's new and interesting?"</p><p>Remus blinked dumbly at the question as he zoned back in to the real world. "Um nothing much." Yeah, he had a real way with words.</p><p>They were walking through a park, fallen brown leaves crunching underfoot. The sun was out but the air was cold, biting at his fingers and turning the tip of Lily's nose pink.</p><p>"Nothing has happened in the two weeks that you've been avoiding me?" She gave him a pointed look. She was too smart for him to try and trick her. Well then. He'd really been wanting to avoid this, a big confrontation but apparently Lily had other ideas. "I'm not daft Remus."</p><p>"I know that."</p><p>"I know you've been going out of your way to steer clear of me."</p><p>Fuck. "That's not-"</p><p>"Don't lie to me," Lily said in her 'I'm not in the mood to take your shit' voice. "You moved out of the flat without saying anything to me. Just packed some boxes and left. Do you have any idea how it felt for me to get home from work, walk into your room to ask if you wanted to have a night in just the to of us and find your room completely empty?"</p><p>"I didn't move-"</p><p>"You've been living with your mum for the last two months."</p><p>Remus was quiet for a minute. There was no way around this. "Sorry," he mumbled.</p><p>"Just tell me one thing."</p><p>Remus gave her an apprehensive look but nodded in agreement. Not that he actually had much of a choice, Lily was as stubborn as they came. His options consisted of telling her the truth or making a run for it. For a split second he legitimately considered the latter, however he hadn't exercised in god knows how long and concluded that he probably wouldn't make it very far before his lungs gave up on him and he'd have to stop or else collapse from exhaustion. When that happened Lily would be hot on his ass and then he'd have to explain himself while gasping for breath. He cursed himself for not being fit.¬†</p><p>"Why have you been avoiding me?" she asked. "What did I do?"</p><p>He sighed and looked down at his shoes, they were scuffed up and dirty. He didn't want to hurt Lily's feelings. "I don't want you to be so worried about me."</p><p>"You're my best friend Remus and you haven't talked to me since the accident. Is it so wrong for me to be worried?" Annoyance was creeping into her tone.</p><p>"I <em>do</em> talk to you."</p><p>"Not about any of the real things, just small talk. It's weird Remus. We've known each other for like nineteen years, why can't you talk to me about this?" she demanded.</p><p>"It's not something I want to talk about," Remus shrugged and picked up the pace, walking faster. Lily practically had to jog to keep up, she was tall but Remus was taller and his strides were longer than hers.</p><p>"You can't just bottle it all up Rem," she huffed indignantly. She was right, of course she was, but he chose to ignore the logical part of his brain. "It's not healthy and your mum and I can tell you're hurting,"</p><p>Remus snorted. "You and mum, huh? You guys are awfully tight lately."</p><p>Out of his peripheral vision he saw her give him a frustrated look, she narrowed her eyes at him. "She's your mum. You and I are best friends. I've known her nearly as long as I've known you. So yeah, we're close. Why are you acting like that's so weird?" Lily asked shortly.</p><p>"Oh, so I am your best friend?" Remus asked, tone dripping with bitter sarcasm. He knew he was being immature, but the words slipped out before he could filter them.</p><p>"What are you talking about?" Lily's face twisted with confusion.</p><p>"Well you know you and my dear mum have been spending so much time together lately that I thought maybe the two of you were best chums now," he said sharply.</p><p>"Bloody hell Remus! We're both worried. You don't talk to her and you don't talk to me which means you aren't talking to anyone."</p><p>He stopped walking and whirled around to face her head on. "Why do I have to bloody talk about anything and everything to begin with!" He took on a high, sour voice to mimic his mum and Lily. "'Sit and talk about your <em>feelings</em> Remus! Tell us about why you <em>feel </em>that way! What are you thinking about?'" He glared at his best friend who looked hurt by his sudden outburst. Remus told himself he didn't care. "Well sorry if I don't feel like sharing every personal detail of what goes on in my head!"</p><p>A woman walking her dog across the street stared at them, his cheeks flushed with hot embarrassment. His mouth set into a hard line and he shoved his hands into his pockets angrily.</p><p>"When was the last time you visited your dad Remus?" Lily asked biting her lip.</p><p>"I'm not doing this." He shook his head and turned around, ready to walk away.</p><p>"Tuney didn't invite me to her wedding," she blurted.</p><p>Remus stopped in his tracks and turned back around to face Lily. All the hard determination had seeped out of her with that one statement and had been replace by something exhausted and bleak. She looked at him with a sort of desperation in her eyes. "Look, we don't have to talk about what happened Remus, not if you really don't want to, at least not right now. I just want you to stop avoiding me. I want to spend time with you again. Maybe you don't want to talk to me but I need to talk to you. There are things I can only talk to you about and I haven't been able to talk to you, not really, for the last couple of months."</p><p>Remus considered this. He knew where she was coming from. He too longed for the late nights listening to vinyl and gossiping, popping each others' zits, splitting a bottle of alcohol, communicating in grunts and choreographing dances to their favourite songs. Okay, so he'd missed her a lot. He saw Lily's lip tremble and it was almost instinctual the way he stepped forward and wrapped her up into a tight hug. "I'm sorry Lily," he whispered into her wild auburn hair.</p><p>She squeezed him back, returning the fierce hug full force. "It's okay. I know it's been hard for you. I just want my best friend back."</p><p>Lily wasn't really who he was angry at. She didn't deserve the way he'd been treating her. With her here in front of him now he realized how ridiculous he'd been by trying to avoid her, thinking that by doing so he'd be able to avoid his feelings as well. "Wanna get pizza and ice cream and you can catch me up on what your idiot sister has done?"</p><p>She offered him a weak, watery smile. "Yes please."</p><p>-x-</p><p>Lily lay sprawled out across the foot of her messy unmade bed and stared up at the fan that was spinning on the ceiling as it went round and round and round. Remus lazily nudged her leg with his foot, he sat with his back to the beds headboard. "You want the last slice?"</p><p>Lily turned her head to look at the lonely sad last piece of pizza in the grease stained box. "Nah," she burped loudly. "I'm full to bursting."</p><p>Remus chuckled and tilted his head back so that it rested on one of Lily's many ginormous throw pillows. They'd been sitting like this in her room for the last few hours as Lily caught him up on what was going on in her life. "Mhmm same. Food baby." He rested his hand on his belly. "So what, that's it? Dorcas just isn't talking to Marlene anymore?"</p><p>"It's really stupid, believe me, I know. But it gets worse."</p><p>"It doesn't."</p><p>Lily snorts at his dry humour and sarcasm. "The other girls are getting involved and taking sides. Personally, I'm just trying to stay out of it." Lily paused, and he could tell she was choosing her next words carefully. "They've all been asking about you."</p><p>He could feel her eyes on him. He stubbornly kept his eyes on the ceiling fan. "Yeah?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>Remus bit at the skin around his nails as he thought about this. "It's been awhile since I've hung out with them."</p><p>"Marlene is having her birthday party this weekend. Are you coming?"</p><p>"You know that's not really my scene," Remus grimaced and squirmed a bit under her gaze. Marlene hosted a lot of parties. All of them were loud and chaotic and usually Remus went and hid in her room so he didn't have to talk to anymore drunk or horny young adults. Saying those parties wasn't his thing was an understatement.</p><p>"I know."</p><p>Things were quiet between them for a bit before he asked, "Who's going to be there?"</p><p>"Mary, Alice, Peter," Lily counted them off on her fingers. "Donna, John, David, some people I don't know but Marlene has class with. Um," she frowned in thought. "Even though they're fighting I'm sure Dorcas would come if I told her you were going to be there." She sounded so very hopeful, he didn't deserve her.</p><p>"I haven't got a gift."</p><p>"I only just got her a Pink Floyd shirt today. I'm sure we can find her something else at the same store tomorrow after your shift if your up for it?"</p><p>Remus sighed, going was the very least he could do to make up for avoiding her. "Fine."</p><p>Lily beamed at him, her eyes glittered with happiness. "Thanks Rem."</p><p>He smiled back at her. They sat in content silence, actually not complete silence. Africa by Toto was playing quietly from the turn table on Lily's bedside table. Remus unconsciously hummed along to the lyrics as he was thinking. <br/><br/></p><p>
  <em> Gonna take some time to do the things we never have</em>
</p><p>"It's been a month."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"You asked how long it'd been, since I last visited my dad. It's been a month."</p><p>"A month?" Lily repeated disbelievingly.</p><p>"It's hard." He knew it was a shitty excuse, that really it wasn't much of one at all. But he didn't know what else to say, how else to explain. <br/><br/><br/></p><p>"You don't have to talk about it."</p><p>"I know but you were right. I've been bottling things up and I guess who better to talk to about things than my best mate?" Remus grimaced. Lily gave him a small encouraging smile. "People keep saying it's not my fault but it was, Lily. The only reason he was in that car in the first place was because of me. If I'd just stayed home or decided not to drink that night then I wouldn't have gotten wasted and had to call him for a ride home." His eyes started to well up with tears and he tried to blink them away.</p><p>Lily reached out and placed a reassuring hand on his arm, not to get him to stop but as a sign of support. He took a deep breath and continued. "There are so many things that I could of, should have, done differently. I took everything away from him and mum. He can't live in his own house with his family anymore. He lives in a home for people who can't take care of themselves because I ruined him-" His throat closed up and he choked on his words.</p><p>"Hey, hey, listen to me Rem. It wasn't your fault okay? People keep saying that because it's true. You did the smart thing, the responsible thing, by calling your dad. The other driver should have done the same." The other driver who'd been driving under the influence and had swerved into their lane and caused the crash that had paralyzed his dad from the waist down, rendering his legs useless. The crash that was the cause for the scars that littered Remus' body. The driver had died on impact and left wreckage behind him. He couldn't remember much, apparently he'd gone into shock, his body coursing with adrenaline. When he tried to recall the event it was like a hazy dream, blurry scenes sewn together with blood and glass and wailing sirens. Remus tried not to think about it.</p><p>It was only when he'd woken up in the hospital days later that the doctor and his mum, face all blotchy, had helped him piece together what had happened so that it made some sense in his brain. Later his mum explained to him that his dad was recovering but wouldn't be able to come home. He was wheel chair bound and wouldn't be able to navigate the stairs, so he'd been staying at a home for people who couldn't take care of themselves, which was bullshit because Lyall Lupin could take care of himself, they just didn't have the money to relocate to a more accommodating house.</p><p>The first three weeks after the accident Remus had visited his dad constantly, but each time he'd gone and seen what he'd done it had been like tearing open the scars to nasty bloody gashes all over again. So he stopped visiting his dad. But the nightmares, they kept him up at all hours, they prevented him from getting enough sleep, prevented him from moving on. He moved back in with his mum because he couldn't take care of himself and he wanted to avoid his best friend who was always giving him searching looks for answers and explanations he couldn't give. That hadn't helped much because his mum gave him those same looks too. People said it would take time for the harsh bluntness of the memories to fade and it was true that some days were better than others and were actually bearable but then a stranger would ask him how he got the ugly scar on his face and it would all come roaring back.</p><p>After two months of pushing the memories away, of avoiding the important people in his life, he was caving. Clearly the pushing, the running, the avoiding wasn't working so he was trying something different. That's how he'd gotten here, where he was right now, talking to Lily. It wasn't a great bounding leap to fix everything but it it was baby steps. One thing at a time.</p><p>-x-</p><p>"Earth to idiot? Excuse me?" Sirius zoned back in. "Hello, yeah hi." Fuck. "I'd like to buy these Led Zeppelin pins." It was the couple from the cafe. Or really it was the redhead up front being an asshole and tall boy was being all gloomy behind her. Sirius stared at him and he stared back. He blinked and broke out of his momentary trance.</p><p>"Uh give me a minute," muttered Sirius. He turned away from the couple and went around back to find James. Thankfully McGonagall wasn't in today, she'd have fired him for sure if she'd seen him leave two customers alone at the cashier.</p><p>When he walked in James looked over at him with drooping eyes and flashed him a grin. He was sitting up on the window ledge smoking a joint. The young mans hair was sticking up all over the place and he looked like a mess. "Hey Siri, what's up?"</p><p>"James, you really shouldn't do that at work." He gave his best mate a disapproving look.</p><p>James just rolled his eyes. "Come on man, don't kill my buzz. Besides, McGonagall's not in today."</p><p>"Whatever it's your own brain that you're frying." Sirius leaned heavily against the doorframe. It took him a moment to remember why he'd come back here for. "Oh, and she's back by the way."</p><p>His friend gave hum a puzzled look. "Huh?"</p><p>Sirius cleared his throat. "Your feisty redhead," he clarified. "She's out there." Sirius jerked his head in the direction of the front of the store.</p><p>James' face lit up. "Asking for me?"</p><p>"No, she's not asking for you," Sirius snorted, making a face and rolling his eyes. "She's with her boyfriend. She wants-"</p><p>"Boyfriend?!" James yelped, interrupting, and slide down from the window sill. He crossed the room and took another inhale from the joint.</p><p>"-to buy something. Go deal with her."</p><p>"Boyfriend?" James repeated.</p><p>He sighed dramatically and shoved his hands into his front pockets. "Yes, you dolt. Did I fucking stutter?"</p><p>"How do you know?" James asked, brows furrowing as he crossed his arms. Sirius thought he looked like a child about to throw a tantrum.</p><p>He ran a hand through his hair, getting frustrated. "Just go deal with them," Sirius groaned.</p><p>"Why can't you?" James huffed, blowing out smoke into his face.</p><p>"You're the one who likes her!" he exclaimed.</p><p>"You said she has a boyfriend!" James retaliated.</p><p>"Just go!"</p><p>"I'm high!" The other boy argued in a whiny voice.</p><p>"So?"</p><p>James shook his head and passed the joint to Sirius. "Fine," he sighed and walked out of the room.</p><p>When the couple finally left the store, Sirius crushed the joint under his shoe and tossed it in a trashcan before he came back out.</p><p>"What the hell?" James turned on him.</p><p>"What?" Sirius asked leaning against the counter.</p><p>"What's wrong with you?"</p><p>"I don't know what you mean."</p><p>His friend laughed. "Don't give me that horse shit."</p><p>"James, you're going to have to be more specific."</p><p>"Firstly, you're an idiot. Secondly, you're an idiot. Thirdly, you're an idiot." James bent over at the waist he was laughing so hard.</p><p>Sirius tried to keep a straight face, but high James really was a riot. "Man, you need help coming up with better insults."</p><p>"Sirius," James was shaking his head vigorously back and forth, hazel eyes wide. "I don't think they're dating."</p><p>"I can promise you they are," he insisted. His eyes scanned the counter for something to fiddle with. They landed on a paper clip which he snatched up and started bending out of shape.</p><p>James stopped laughing and pouted. "Why?"</p><p>"I went to the cafe across the way yesterday and I saw them. They're dating. Trust me."</p><p>"What do you mean you saw them?" James' eyes narrowed.</p><p>Sirius looked away. He started bending the metal(wire?) around his finger. "I saw them being all touchy."</p><p>"Making out?" his friend prodded, leaning forward and nearly losing his balance.</p><p>"James, I really don't want to talk about it."</p><p>"Okay, okay, whatever Siri." James held his hands up in surrender and backed off. They sat in awkward silence for awhile. There had been a lot more of that happening lately. James trying to talk and Sirius pushing him away. "Will you take me to get food?" James asked changing the subject, he was apparently over Sirius lashing out. His chest filled with relief, James always forgave him but Sirius always worried that one day he wouldn't. He wasn't sure what he would do if that ever happened.</p><p>"As soon as our shift ends," Sirius assured him. The munchies were setting in and when high and hungry James had the weirdest cravings</p><p>-x-</p><p>"That guy totally wanted to jump you!" Remus cackled when the store door closed behind them.</p><p>"Fuck off. What are you twelve?" Lily scowled deeply and shoved the small plastic bag with the Led Zeppelin pins they'd bought for Marlene at his chest.</p><p>Remus folded the bag and put the small bundle into his front pocket. "Here's what I'm wondering, what's wrong with him? He's good looking. You didn't even try to flirt back. I don't even think you smiled once the whole time we were in there."</p><p>"He was high." Lily rolled her eyes. "They're the same guys that were working there yesterday."</p><p>His eyebrows rose. "You totally brought me back on purpose to see that bloke again, not because you remembered the pins."</p><p>Lily flushed pink and Remus howled with laughter. Then an image of the other guy flitted into his head and he sobered up. He cleared his throat and tried to make his next words sound as casual and uninterested as possible. "So that other guy, he was there yesterday too?"</p><p>"The one who stared at you like he'd just seen a ghost when you walked in?" Her mouth curved up into a smile. "Yeah, I almost ran him down."</p><p>Remus gapped at his friend. "You what?!"</p><p>Lily waved a dismissive hand at him. "Unimportant. What matters is the look he was giving you. Where have you seen him before?"</p><p>"Uh, just at the caf√© yesterday."</p><p>"He's cute."</p><p>He forced a chuckle. "I guess."</p><p>Lily snorted. "You know I know you've got the hots for him so don't even try hiding it."</p><p>"I do not," Remus protested.</p><p>"Please," she pronounced it like puh-lease, all drawn out and dramatic, "it's so obvious."</p><p>"I don't even know him."</p><p>"But you'd like to have his adopted babies?" Lily said, completely straight faced.</p><p>"Oh my fucking god Lily!" Remus' face went beet red. " You can't just say stuff like that!"</p><p>"Can't I?" Lily grinned at him, eyes glinting with mirth.</p><p>"No!" He cried out as they turned the corner and approached his truck.</p><p>Lily smirked. "It's okay don't worry. I can tell the feeling is mutual."</p><p>"What are you on about?" He asked confused, brows furrowing. He pulled his keys out from his sweater pocket and unlocked the car.</p><p>They both got in and Lily was putting her seat belt on when she answered. "He would suck your prick if you asked him to."</p><p>"LilyIsweartogodI'llkillyouifyou-"</p><p>"Calm down," Lily rolled her eyes. "You're twenty-two, you've <em>had</em> sex."</p><p>"I'll make you walk."</p><p>"Okay, okay, I'll stop."</p><p>Remus took a deep breath, started up the engine, and tried to get the dumb guy with long black hair out of his head. He was probably emo or a really heavy metal head. He probably smoked cigarettes that made his mouth taste gross and ashy. He probably thought he was too cool for school and couldn't hold an intellectual conversation.</p><p><em>That doesn't mean he wouldn't be a good shag</em>, an idiotic and illogical part of his brain interjected.</p><p>He hated the side ways look Lily was giving him, like she knew exactly what he was thinking, which, being his best friend and all, she probably actually did.</p><p>¬†</p>
