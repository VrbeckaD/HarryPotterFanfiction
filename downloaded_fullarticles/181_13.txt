    <p>              “So, Harry’s at the Weasleys’ house right now?” Melody asked as she slumped into the couch next to her twin.</p><p>               Marvus’s fingers were tapping away at the controller in his hand. He wasn’t doing so well on screen. His character had been killed several times during one of the boss battles. There are just too many minions and every time he thought he could finally get one hit at the boss, the boss slipped away and the minions killed him.</p><p>               On the coffee table between the TV and couch, there were two O.W.L.S. parchments. Both sported similar scores, almost all of the classes contained Acceptables, with a few Exceeding Expectations and Outstandings. The only difference between the two was that some of Melody’s wand work could still use some work compared to her twin’s.</p><p>               “Dumbledore said he wanted to take Harry on a field trip to recruit the next professor, so he’s going there at some point,” Marvus answered, frowning as the hit points on his character started to go lower and lower with every minion appearing. “Ugh, this is fucking ridiculous, they aren’t even powerful! They just keep blowing up right next to me!”</p><p>               Melody ignored her brother has he threw the controller on his lap, letting out a long and dramatic sigh as his character was killed once again.</p><p>               “Have ya been telling Nico what’s been happening?” Melody asked.</p><p>               “Yeah,” Marvus said, putting down the controller on the table to finally look away from the dark to his twin, “he’s coming back early. Two weeks before school starts.”</p><p>               <em>Just for meetings. There isn’t much he can do here other than that… much like us.</em></p><p>               Marvus didn’t have to say those words for Melody to know. Just from the frustrated and solemn look on his face, she could tell.</p><p>               Their mother had finally stopped being transferred through the different departments in the Ministry of Magic. Cornelius Fudge was being voted out of office, and in his place, another man by the name of Rufus Scrimgeour was going to have a try.  Rufus Scrimgeour had a meaner look compared the pigmy puff of Fudge. No, Scrimgeour was tougher looking with a stern look.</p><p>               It made people feel better about what the future knowing that the Ministry would be lead with the past Head of Aurors. However, Ms. Jones had said leading Aurors to lower crime and a country at the start of war were two very different things.</p><p>               Ms. Jones was alright with her job under a new department called Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. Mr. Weasley headed that mouthful and did just as the name said they did. People now, more than ever, were likely to buy anything to have a chance to protect themselves from what was going on outside.</p><p>               No, it wasn’t new, after all, the same thing had happened during the rise of Voldemort.</p><p>               There were even some Death Eaters coming to the Jones’ house. Watching. Waiting. Sometimes, when they thought the moment was right, attacking. But, thankfully, the small Jones family wasn’t doing too bad even if their grandmother began to taunt the Death Eaters.</p><p>               Marvus and Melody’s Aunt and Uncle spoke of only watchers. But the Jones family was a tough family.</p><p>               Besides, if Melody and Marvus had gotten used to monsters coming every now and again, so getting wizards too wasn’t too bad. Annoying, yes. Getting close calls, yes. But they were fine. At least, for now.</p><p>               Melody looked out the window to see that it was once again, misty. she frowned.</p><p> </p><p>               Even the Muggles had started to realize something was wrong. However, they couldn’t pinpoint it. They were getting bleary days, not feeling the best, and a bridge had collapsed, even though it was just built.</p><p>               Their mother had told them the cause of the mist were breeding of the Dementors It was just like the start of the last war. Voldemort wasn’t holding back either. Killed Amelia Bones, the current head of the Auror Office… or no so current anymore. A list of what to do during these times was sent home to the students to prepare them for the dark forces. Inferni could be about. Questions should be made to make sure people weren’t under the Imperius curse.</p><p>               But, Melody and Marvus were already prepared for this.</p><p>               They were, after all, children of war.</p><p>               “Ugh,” Melody groaned and flung herself sideways on the couch, “I wish we could kill Dementors with Patronuses, I need the sun to come out!”</p><p>               Marvus instantly smirked as he restarted the round. He was going to beat the boss before the summer was over, that was a definite since he couldn’t bring the game to school.</p><p>               “Your fish killing a Dementor? Salmon? Salmon that get eaten by bears?” Marvus teased.</p><p>               Melody glared at her twin and flung her legs over his lap as she laid down.</p><p>               “My fish is a fine fish,” Melody said, “and this round is going to be the last, we should go to the Magic of Ministry so we can have lunch with Mom soon. I call not waking up Grammy.”</p><p> </p><p>               “So, when are you going to go back?” Will asked.</p><p>               Nico was already packing. There wasn’t much to pack; all he needed was already in his trunk. The only things he needed to add were more swords, as well as ambrosia and nectar.</p><p>               After he had heard much of the news about England, not only from Melody and Marvus but a good portion of the Apollo cabin (who knew so many people were happy to look at other country’s news?) he knew he had to be ready. This year was going to be unlike the one before. People had already been killed…</p><p>               It was the start. The start of the war they had been waiting for.</p><p>               Nico had been dreading every moment of it. Still, he was ready. He was more ready to attend Hogwarts than he had been last year. Instead of floating through what he could possibly do, now, he had clear missions in mind. Not clear steps, but, hey, they were a start.</p><p>               It was hard to watch from the sidelines. Packing deluded him into thinking he was doing more than he actually was. Both Will and Nico knew this but didn’t bother to say anything.</p><p>              “In three weeks maybe four, it depends. I have to see some people before the school year starts,” Nico answered, still rummaging through his drawers to make sure everything he got everything he wanted. He grabbed his Mythomagic t-shirts and shoved them into his trunk.</p><p>               Melody and Marvus had mailed him some Floo Powder. Instead of using the shortcut to the Underworld and then Hogwarts, he could go through the Floo Network instead. Daphne had made sure it was possible, her cousin had made a permanent change within the network for him. Nico thanked her with a never-ending paragraph in a letter he sent a few weeks ago and he wasn’t the only one to be so happy, Will had certainly appreciated it.</p><p>               Of course, Nico couldn’t avoid using his powers forever. After a summer’s rest, he hoped it would be enough to get back to where he was, maybe even better than before.</p><p>               The son of Hades made sure to leave some of the powder behind. After all, Will still needed to use it at some point.</p><p>               “You are coming too, what are you talking about?” Nico said. Then his mind began to turn and then he frowned. “Okay, you aren’t coming that early… Maybe a few days before the terms start… That is, if you want to take up Dumbledore’s offer to study under Madame Pomphrey.”</p><p>               Will lounged on the pillows on the floor of the Hades cabin. He watched his boyfriend, knowing not to help (Nico wasn’t going to let him, those were his things! His responsibility!), and sunk deeper into the pillows.</p><p>               “I was thinking that I would come later during the year,” Will said, turning around a letter in his hand. Nico had gotten his results from the O.W.L.S. a week ago. No, he hadn’t opened them. “There are a few people that I need to look over here before I go.”</p><p>               Nico hid some of his disappointment. It did kind of suck that he wasn’t going to see his boyfriend as much, just like last time, but… Will needed to do what he needed to do. Nico couldn’t fault him for that.</p><p>               “What’s this?” Will asked, finally holding up the letter.</p><p>               Nico groaned.</p><p>               <em>I was wondering when he was going to start asking that…</em></p><p>               “It’s my O.W.L.S.,” Nico answered, slamming his trunk shut.</p><p>               Will’s eyebrows quirked up.</p><p>               “I thought you already took them?”</p><p>               “Grades,” Nico clarified as he leaned up against his trunk, “they are what I got for all the classes.”</p><p>               Will frowned as he began to look at the envelope more closely. It did look rather nice compared to the letters that Pansy and his other Slytherin friends had been sending. The paper was well kept, beautiful cursive handwriting danced across it, and dark wax seal showed intricacies relating to Hogwarts, the O.W.L.S. exams themselves.</p><p>               “You got this a while ago, didn’t you?” Will asked, letting the letter flop onto his lap.</p><p>               Nico let out a sigh and gave him a disgruntled look.</p><p>               “Yeah, about a week ago- okay, don’t look at me like that! I mean, what’s the point of looking when I know it’s going to be bad? Huh?”</p><p>               It might not be bad. With all of the help from Pansy, Tracey, and Millicent, he could have gotten some acceptable O.W.L.S. But it might also be bad. Not opening the letter allowed Nico’s perception to shift between the two without too much worry.</p><p>               <em>Bad or not bad? Could be both at this point, Schrödinger’s grades.</em></p><p>               Nico knew he’d have to tell his friends eventually what he’d got. He just didn’t know what he’d do if he had done horribly in all of his classes. What would his friends say? Well, it couldn’t be too bad, but…</p><p>               That only earned a worse look from Will. Yet, in a second, the son of Apollo smiled, and he held up the letter once more.</p><p>               “I’ll give you a kiss if you look at it with me,” Will grinned.</p><p>               Nico looked down at the envelope. He frowned, letting his hands tap the top of his trunk. He squinted at the envelope as if it had personally insulted him. Then, he removed his hands from the trunk and his gaze turned up toward Will.</p><p>               “Before or after?” Nico asked.</p><p> </p><p>               “No, I don’t want to see him,” Sirius Black said tersely to Dumbledore, glaring at the House Elf in front of him, “I don’t want to be here anymore and I don’t want to have to look after the house with this- this thing!”</p><p>               Harry had left the Dursley’s to live with the Weasley’s for the rest of the summer. It wasn’t going to be long before Hogwarts was going to start up again. Plus, Dumbledore wanted Harry there. Sirius couldn’t blame him; Harry was starting to get bored of their times together, itching to get back to school.</p><p>              As for Sirius, without Harry, he was returning to Grimmauld Place. Over the summer, he had virtually become cleared of all his charges. It was frustrating to Sirius, in the fact that he had to “die” to become a free man.</p><p>               But, now, with life as a free man, he had to deal with the same old things. He had to deal with what was handed to him when his mother had died: the house, Kreacher, Buckbeak, <em>everything</em>. Sirius had merely pushed it off by spending the whole summer with Harry.</p><p>               And Lupin did come too at some point.</p><p>               Harry needed the break. So did Sirius.</p><p>               <em>Maybe if we had stayed not at the Dursleys’ we could have spent the whole time together</em>, Sirius with a frown, Dumbledore insisted Harry stay in the house… It was frustrating, having to stay in the wretched house with those wretched Muggles.</p><p>               <em>Lily was right to complain about her sister, her, her husband, and her son were unbearable.</em></p><p>               Of course, though, you can’t avoid responsibilities forever. Dumbledore reminded Sirius of that as he went back to Grimmauld Place. Well, Remus did too, but there was only so much he could do. It was just like when they were kids, really…</p><p>               So, Sirius got the ball rolling.</p><p>               Buckbeak, or rather, Witherwings, went to Hagrid to enjoy the outdoors. Yes, Sirius had to say goodbye to a good feathered friend, but he knew the hippogriff would be happier.</p><p>               Grimmauld Place House was staying as a meeting place for the Order of the Phoenix. More protocols were created and extra spells were put in place to add protection.</p><p>               So that left the awful House-Elf to deal with. Sirius had managed a week without seeing the thing. But, with Dumbledore’s very hard suggestion, the ugly thing was summoned by Sirius. This was the final thing Sirius had to do.</p><p>               Kreacher stared back at Sirius with the same hatred, his eye twitching with anger at the insults. He didn’t have to tell Sirius what he thought of him for. After all, the wizard had heard it all a thousand times before.</p><p>               “Kreacher won’t be serving you anymore! Kreacher is meant to serve his Mistress Bellatrix, a true Black! Not- not- not Master Sirius! Not the Blood-traitor! Not the one who broke my mistress’s heart-”</p><p>               “Shut up, Kreatcher!”</p><p>               Kreacher let out a painful squeal as the last of his words were cut off from him.</p><p>               “You can’t treat him like this, Sirius,” Dumbledore said calmly, his blue eyes resting on the wizard before him, “you could have died once because of him, do you think repeating the same path will grant you a different result?”</p><p>               Sirius stopped. He stared at the House Elf with a blank expression, his face not showing what he was thinking.</p><p>               There was too much. It wasn’t so much that dying bothered Sirius, no. Surprisingly, it was how Kreacher could have caused so much pain to Harry and his friends. His g<em>odchild</em>.</p><p>               <em>James and Lily trusted me. </em></p><p>               Anger swelled up in Sirius.</p><p>               <em>I am going to do this the way I want to. I am going to live and Harry is going to be fine!</em></p><p>               “He isn’t allowed to speak of the meetings nor make reference to them in any way, talking, writing, dancing around it, nothing,” Sirius said as he glared at the House Elf, “he doesn’t clean, he doesn’t do anything, so I don’t want him here.”</p><p>               The House Elf returned the same hatred and anger. Though, he appeared to be struggling with something. The order and not order of staying there. The only thing that kept Kreacher there was… was…</p><p>               “If you want, he can work within the kitchens in Hogwarts,” Dumbledore offered.</p><p>               Sirius didn’t take another moment to decide.</p><p>               “Kreacher, I want you to work at Hogwarts,” Sirius ordered.</p><p>               With one last glare, the House Elf disappeared with a crack.</p><p>               Sirius knew that Dumbledore didn’t believe that was the right choice. However, Sirius couldn’t bring himself to care. If he was going to live any longer in this horrible house of his, he was going to really <em>live</em>.</p><p>               As a free man, he could also be free from his past. He could feel it, the light that shone in his heart. Something he had missed in Azkaban, something he had missed when he couldn’t go out and feel the sun on his skin…</p><p>               Then an echo sounded in his mind, shrouding some of the light.</p><p>               <em>Finish what I started.</em></p><p>               His brother’s voice. A brother who had served as a Death Eater and only lasted days when he turned against Voldemort… A brother Sirius had thought about more in the past two months than he had in a decade.</p><p>               A brother he thought he had left behind.</p><p>               And Sirius’s strong resolve in leaving his past began to fade.</p><p> </p><p>               Harry thought about his new professor: Slughorn. Slughorn did like to collect people. Even the little meeting with him had told Harry, the way he would go on to their achievements, that they would send him gifts, and the sadness in that none of his students knew where he was anymore. Moving around so much meant that Slughorn could no longer keep in touch.</p><p>               While Slughorn didn’t seem like the best man in the world for that job, he was at least better than Umbridge.</p><p>               Fred and George were living in a Flat in Diagon Alley since their business was booming. Even Mrs. Weasley admitted that they were doing surprisingly well. Still, the Burrow was rather full. Fleur Delacour was an addition since she was… Bill’s fiancé. Harry didn’t know whether to comment on Mrs. Weasley’s assertion that their relationship was moving fast.</p><p>               It might have been because she, Ginny, and Hermione weren’t having fun with the new possible family member, that she was full of herself, and her doting on Bill was going to make them throw up.</p><p>               Harry could neither deny nor agree with these claims either.</p><p>               Harry finally told Ron and Hermione about the Prophecy and… they took it well. Even took Dumbledore giving him private lessons really well too.</p><p>               In fact, the only thing that didn’t go well was seeing what they had gotten on their O.W.L.S. They may or may not have held each other screaming when they realized three owls were flying toward them with their results. No, of course not. Hermione definitely wasn’t a little upset that she had one Exceeding Expectations instead of all Outstandings. Not at all.</p><p>               And then, finally, it was Harry’s sixteenth birthday.</p><p>               Harry, Ron, and Hermione had played Quidditch with Ginny, but now they were waiting for the small celebration to come. Sirius and Lupin were coming with a cake (much to Mrs. Weasley’s dismay) and Tonks planned to join when the night wore on. Ginny and Mrs. Weasley were happy to know that Fleur was too busy making wedding arrangements to attend until much later.</p><p>               Harry, Ron, and Hermione started to spend the time complaining about one thing or another as they sat at the kitchen table, eating some snacks that were left out. The clock had already scared them once when it dinged to show Mr. Weasley and Bill coming home.</p><p>               Mrs. Weasley had moved the clock showing where all of the Weasley family members were to the kitchen, where she was cleaning. All of the hands pointed to mortal peril. Harry had noticed over the time here that Molly had taken up the habit of carrying the clock around the house, watching and worrying about everyone.</p><p>               It let a nasty feeling in his stomach.</p><p>               Finally, there was a knock.</p><p>               “Harry, open the door,” Mrs. Weasley said, frowning as she turned her wand and dishes flew out of the sink, “I’m sure that’s Lupin and Sirius waiting for you.”</p><p>               Harry didn’t need her to ask him Before Ron or Hermione could say anything or even comment about his absence in their conversation, he was already bounding straight past them and to the door.</p><p>               He had been waiting to see Sirius. It wasn’t that long since he had seen him, but…</p><p>               A little voice in his mind was wondering if Sirius was really alive. And if Sirius was going to stay alive. Harry had almost lost Sirius, he didn’t want to lose him again.</p><p>               “Wait! Before you open the door, you have to ask them a question-” Mrs. Weasley screamed from the kitchen just as the door was opened wide.</p><p>               Harry stared at Melody and Marvus’s forms, staring excitedly at him. Behind the twins, stood Sirius and Lupin. It was strange, though Sirius and Lupin appeared to be as worn out as they always had, there was also something aglow about them.</p><p>               “Harry!” Melody screamed as she tackled him.</p><p>               He couldn’t do anything as she squeezed his midsection, lifting him into the air, nearly breaking his ribs in the process. Luckily, she let him go onto the ground rather quickly.</p><p>               “Happy Birthday, you birthday boy!” Melody sang, “Nico says happy Birthday too, but he’s busy, but we’re here!”</p><p>               “Yeah, happy sweet sixteen,” Marvus added as he went through the threshold, sending a wave to the others in the room, letting his feet hit the ground with a loud thump. He frowned at Harry. “Where is your crown? All the sweet sixteen birthday people need crowns. Gods, if I’d known you didn’t have one, I would have brought one of mine for you.”</p><p>               Harry opened his mouth, but nothing came out as he watched as Lupin and Sirius finally wandered in, both of them carrying boxes, with a larger plain one in Lupin’s arms. They smiled at him and Harry realized he was right; they were a bit happier.</p><p>               Only a squeal took his attention from the two men.</p><p>               “Hermione is here! Oh, I didn’t know she was here!” Melody screamed even louder.</p><p>               Melody went and looked like she was going to give Hermione a similar spine bending hug, her hands going wide before ensnaring Hermione just as Hermione realized the sort of danger she was in. However, during the hug Hermione didn’t wheeze or beg for Melody to let go.</p><p>               Hermione was also surprised at the normal hug and quickly returned it.</p><p>               “It’s a pleasant surprise to see you too,” Hermione said as Melody pulled away.</p><p>               Melody practically glowed.</p><p>               “Yes! Letters were alright, but sometimes they got a little scratched up and it is always so nice to see friends in person- oh! Ron, you need a hug too,” Melody didn’t bother to see Ron’s suddenly wide eyes and the way he turned to find a place to escape.</p><p>               At least, that didn’t stop her from giving him a hug.</p><p>               Hearing the breath that was forced out of Ron, Harry could tell she didn’t hold back for him either.</p><p>               “It’s good to see you, too bad your brothers aren’t here,” Melody continued and then she turned toward all of the house, “wow, your home is quite comfy! Very nice, it’s like ours but no weapons!”</p><p>               “Yeah,” Marvus said with a matching smile.</p><p>               Ginny must have heard the commotion because she was edging into the kitchen area to see the new guests. Mr. Weasley was with her too, frowning as if he was confused about how there were even more children in his house.</p><p>               “Lupin, get over here so we can start cutting that cake you wanted to make so bad,” Mrs. Weasley said just as the man got into the kitchen.</p><p>               Harry watched as Lupin obediently went toward her, placing the cake on the table. He took it out of the box. It was decorated with red and orange letterings and what seemed to be a horribly made stag in white.</p><p>               “Harry.”</p><p>               Instantly Harry turned toward the owner of the voice.</p><p>               There stood Sirius, smiling. He still had bags underneath his eyes. Even with their time over the summer, those dark circles hadn’t gone away. What did go away were the bones showing under his skin and, for once, his grin was genuine.</p><p>               “After cake, I have a gift for you,” Sirius said.</p><p>               The box Harry had seen earlier was still in Sirius’s hand. The wrapping paper was of red and yellow stripes, sloppily put together, with some glue dried and frozen in mid-drip.</p><p>               But it still made Harry’s heart overflow with gratitude and awe.</p><p>               “Oh,” Harry said, wide eyes as he stared at it, “thank you.”</p><p>               Molly Weasley gasped.</p><p>               At once, everyone’s attention went toward her and then her gaze.</p><p>               The clock’s hands had moved. Instead of pointing toward mortal peril, all of the members, except Fred and George, were pointed to the label of home.</p><p>               “Huh,” Arthur Weasley said in wonder, the handful of forks near the other plates by the cake was forgotten as he slowly let go of then, “it hasn’t been like that for a while.”</p><p> </p><p>               Pansy lounged on one of Tracey’s large black couches. Her legs were swung over the armrests, her back against the other, and her eyes on the mantle above the fireplace where Tracey and Pansy’s O.W.L.S. laid. Tracey had gotten all Outstandings and Exceeding Expectations. Pansy’s were a little more varied, but she was happy with what she had gotten. The classes she had cared about had high enough grades to continue in N.E.W.T.S. for them.</p><p>               She was happy that the owl had found her. Pansy didn’t know what would happen if she showed up to Hogwarts without knowing what she had gotten; there was no way she was going back to her house.</p><p>               <em>My grades wouldn’t have been useful for my parents either</em>.</p><p>               A frown was on Pansy’s face as she waited for Tracey to finish cleaning her room. The Davis parents had had enough of their little “garden gnome” and wanted to be able to see the floor.</p><p>               No, Pansy hadn’t heard a word from either of her parents. The Death Eater and the Ministry worker was apparently too busy for her. That wasn’t surprising.</p><p>               No one was after Pansy Parkinson either. Deaths and disappearances were appearing almost daily in the newspapers and Pansy still sat comfortably in a house that wasn’t hers.</p><p>               <em>Maybe it was because they wanted me to be safe. My parents are letting me slip under the radar by not talking to me.</em></p><p>               <em>Or maybe it’s too much of a hassle to bother with their only daughter.</em></p><p>               Pansy crossed her legs and her frown deepened. Her brown eyes began to wander to the table beside her, filled with the open letters from Nico, Daphne, Millicent, and even Blaise. There were no letters from Draco. In fact, in one of Blaise’s long rants, he had complained about how <em>no one</em>has been receiving letters from Draco.</p><p>               Pansy didn’t know if she cared. If she did, she suppressed those feelings harshly.</p><p>               <em>Draco is getting what he deserved</em>, she thought, scowling and crossing her arms over her chest.</p><p>               Maybe the way she was reacting was out of revenge. Revenge for being a follower for so long. The sense of betrayal that she had gotten after willingly doing so many things for Draco and- and he never did anything for her! All the time they had spent together was nothing! Wasted!! Something he obviously didn’t care about- and- and-</p><p>               Or maybe it was the fact that Draco did deserve it, after all the havoc with Harry Potter. Every moment Draco saw the Gryffindor it was like he had to do something to taunt him. At least the rest of the Slytherin House wasn’t so… dedicated.</p><p>               Or maybe it was all of the above.</p><p>               Pansy’s eyes finally wandered to the book Nico had given her during the year. Pride and Prejudice.</p><p>               Draco had never given her books. He had given her things, like jewelry for the Yule Ball but never something like a book.</p><p>               Even though Pansy had told Nico it “wasn’t the right time” to read it, that was a lie. In reality, she wanted to wait until she really, really wanted to read it.</p><p>               There was only going to be one chance to read this book for the first time. One time to read and have all of the raw emotions filter out. One time to feel the ultimate shock, betrayal, and love.</p><p>               Her hands went over the cover and she picked it up and put it on her lap.</p><p>               <em>I guess the time is now.</em></p>
