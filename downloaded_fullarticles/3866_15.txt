</p><p>	Harry looked around.</p><p>	He tried to blink. Nothing happened.</p><p>	Harry tried to touch his face, his
arms, his- anything. He tried to flex his hands. He couldn't feel
them. He couldn't feel anything.</p><p>	A wave of panic hit him, he scrambled,
reached, ran, screamed, or he tried to. Nothing happened. He didn't
even feel winded. He- he had no body.</p><p>	<i>Think rationally,</i><span>
Harry told himself sternly; </span><i>Panicking won't help.</i></p><p>	The last thing he
remembered was getting ready for a massive raid on a group thought to
be behind a string of muggle attacks in Poland. The group had already
attacked three muggles in London. 
</p><p>	The raid must have
gone bad.</p><p>	Harry had been
knocked out before. He'd been unconscious for a week and a half after
getting caught by a blasting spell. He'd never been aware during it,
that he remembered anyway.</p><p>	It might be worse
this time.</p><p>
  <span>	</span>
  <i>It
could be a proper coma</i>
  <span>, Harry
thought. </span>
  <i>Or...</i>
  <span> fear
trickled in with the new thought, </span>
  <i>a curse.</i>
</p><p>	He had heard of
curses that put you in an enchanted sleep but... this didn't feel
like sleep. There were curses that made a person look asleep, and
when it was broken, the person was different than before, sometimes
they were so far gone they ended up in the Janus Thickley ward for
the rest of their lives. There were a lot of curses that messed with
your mind.</p><p>	Whatever it was,
he wasn't going to let it break him. He had no doubt that the Healers
at Mungo's would figure out what had happened to him and fix it.</p><p>	He just had to
hold on and wait.</p><p><br/>

</p><p>
  <span>	</span>
  <i>Eggs.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>	Bread.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>	Probably extra bread- the nice
stuff</i>
</p><p><i>	Orange marmalade- </i>
</p><p>
  <i>	</i>
  <span>Harry
grinned to himself; Gin'd be wanting the gross brand with little
weird sugary bits that she only liked when she was pregnant.</span>
</p><p>
  <i>	Pumpkin juice</i>
</p><p>
  <i>	Instant Coffee</i>
</p><p><i>	Flowers-  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>	</i>
  <span>Harry
knew Ginny had to be worried sick. Was she alright?</span>
</p><p>	It was going to be
fine. Everything was going to be fine.</p><p>	And he should pick u<span>p
some tea and some instant coffee for the office...</span></p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
</p><p>	Polyjuice potion
was... fluxweed, knotgrass, stewed lacewing flies, leeches... horn of
a bi-corn, more lacewing flies, boomslang skin and hair.</p><p>	Harry ran through
the ingredients in his mind again</p><p>	That was right. He
was certain... Yeah.</p><p>	Wiggenwald Potion
was made with Horklump juice, flobberworm mucus, chizpurfle fangs,
billywig sting slime, boom berry juice, stewed mandrake... honey
water, sloth brain, moondew drops, salamander blood, lionfish spines,
unicorn horn and wolfsbane.</p><p>	There was... what
was missing? Something...</p><p>
  <span>	</span>
  <i>Mint.
A sprig of mint.</i>
</p><p>	Harry sighed
mentally.</p><p>	What if they never
figured it out? ...What if he was a vegetable, trapped in a catatonic
body. And this was the rest of his life.</p><p>	No.</p><p>	He wasn't going to
go mad.</p><p>	He wasn't going to
lose his mind.</p><p>	He shook himself
and picked another potion.</p><p>	Pepper-up:</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
</p><p><i>	</i><span>Harry
tried to remember his very first memory. Not the one where he saw his
mother die, that had been Riddle's memory, not his. </span>
</p><p>	It was at the
Dursley's. He'd been four or five; it was definitely before he
started school. He'd been carrying the plates from dinner into the
kitchen and going slow because they were heavy... heavy because he'd
tried to take all of them at once instead of one at a time. 
</p><p>	There was a step
stool in front of the sink so he could reach it. Harry had used that
stool until he was nine. When he only took one plate, he could hold
the plate in one hand and grab the counter with the other to help
keep his balance as he climbed the small narrow steps. He had to hold
the plates with both hands this time, but he must have thought he
could manage if he was careful and went slow.</p><p>	Harry could still
vividly remember the top plate slipping off and trying to catch it
and dropping all of them instead. And the noise. It had been the
loudest noise in the world. Nothing had broken, but he still knew he
was in trouble. He'd just stood there, looking at the mess and
waiting for what was to come.</p><p>	In what was
seconds but he remembered feeling like forever, Petunia had stormed
in, yelling, calling him a good for nothing and smacked the side of
his head. It hadn't hurt, but it made him want to cry all the same.
He didn't because it would get him in even more trouble. He'd just
stood there, trying not to cry, clutching his oversized shirt as
Petunia dumped the dishes in the sink, so loud it made him jump, and
shoved a sponge and a rag in his hands to wipe up the floor before he
did the dishes.</p><p>	Petunia had warned
him to finish before it was time for bed and went back to the living
room where Vernon and Dudley were watching the telly. And Harry had
cleaned the floor and hated them all with all his heart. 
</p><p>	No. He hadn't
hated them yet. It was a few years later that he finally realized
nothing he ever did would be enough.</p><p>
  <span>	</span>
  <i>Lovely
times</i>
  <span> Harry mused bitterly,
wishing he could stretch and take a walk, shake off the feeling of
it. He missed Ginny so much he felt like he might die, and James,
still toddling around and making nonsense noises- the look on his
face when he saw Harry back from work, he would light
up and laugh and- and-</span>
</p><p>	Harry felt the
despair sweep over him like a lead weight. He forced himself to be
calm. He forced himself not to think about it anymore.</p><p>	He did his best to
recall his next solid memory in as much detail as he could.</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry</span><br/>
could remember the way the velvet hangings felt, soft and a little worn. The way the light would stream into the common room in the morning. There was one floorboard on the way to the bathroom that squeaked so loudly any unlucky Gryffindor that stepped on it would be smothered with pillows for waking up their dorm mates-
</p><p>
  <span>	...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>	-Harry
</span>
  <i>heard</i>
  <span> something.</span>
</p><p>	He strained after-
whatever it was... it was muffled, but it sounded like a
door opening. The door shut and there were... faint footsteps,
rustling and the click of something like metal boxes being opened and
closed. Then a box opened right- all around him, so loud he wanted to
cover his ears and a sound like someone rubbing a cloth over a phone
receiver.</p><p>	Light.</p><p>	Harry saw- He
could see-  a dark room and a face and-</p><p>	Gone.</p><p>	The metal slammed
shut.</p><p>	Darkness again.</p><p>
  <span>	Harry
tried shouting, tried screaming. He wanted- </span>
  <i>anything</i>
  <span>.
That glimpse had been- he needed more! He wanted to weep for wanting
anything more than being trapped in this hell for even a second
longer!</span>
</p><p>	If he could just-!</p><p>	It wasn't entirely
silent.</p><p>	Harry focused
everything on listening</p><p>	He could still
hear faint sounds, clinking and footsteps, once the murmur of voices and the wumpf of a floo.</p><p>	Harry waited.</p><p>	Something was
happening. 
</p><p>	Finally.</p><p>	That horrible
metal sound happened again but Harry ready for it this time. He was
flooded with light, it was so bright he couldn't make anything out
but outlines.</p><p>
  <span>	</span>
  <i>Is
anyone there! Hello! Someone! Anyone?!</i>
  <span>
Harry shouted, tried to shout, but it was still only the voice in his
own head.</span>
</p><p>	He still couldn't
feel anything.</p><p>	So he really was
paralysed?</p><p>	At least he could
see and hear.</p><p>	At least he wasn't
trapped in darkness.</p><p>	The ceiling. It
was so tall, and there was a chandelier. 
</p><p>	This wasn't St.
Mungos.</p><p>	Where was he?</p><p>	Harry heard papers
rustling and feet shuffling nearby. Whoever it was finally stepped
closer and Harry saw hands, pale, masculine, the sleeves of their
robes were black and tight fitted up to the elbow like potion brewers
tended to prefer. It looked tailored and made of expensive fabric. 
</p><p>	No healer Harry
had ever seen wore robes like that. Perhaps Ginny had hired a private
brewer or healer. 
</p><p>	Those hands
reached down, and in a heartbeat, Harry was lifted and moved- so fast
it would have made him sick if he could feel his stomach. They had
moved him like he weighed nothing and their hands-</p><p>	<i>Malfoy?</i></p><p>	Harry stared at
the face of the person holding him up. He'd know that pointy snobbish
face anywhere.</p><p>	Malfoy was staring
at him with a frown.</p><p>	Harry stared back.
Was he in Malfoy's house? In the Manor? Malfoy wasn't a healer. He
wasn't a potion master. 
</p><p>	What the fuck was
going on?</p><p>	<i>Malfoy?!</i></p><p><i>	</i>Malfoy laid
him back down, and Harry could see him draw his wand.</p><p>	<i>Don't you
fucking-!</i></p><p>	Several spells
washed over Harry that he didn't recognise. Nothing happened.</p><p>	Malfoy's frown
deepened. He picked up a book and flipped through it.</p><p>	Had he been
kidnapped? Was Malfoy behind everything? Maybe it wasn't a raid gone
wrong. Maybe Malfoy was going to – what? Kill him? Hurt him?
Torture him for information?</p><p>	Malfoy cast more
spells over him, more slowly than the last, referring back to his
book.</p><p>	“Can you
hear me?” Malfoy asked.</p><p>	Harry hesitated,
“...Hello? Oh, Merlin! I can- You can hear me-?”</p><p>	“I can hear
you,” Malfoy said, his eyes wide.</p><p>	“What the
fuck is this, Malfoy? What have you done? Let me go!” Harry
yelled.</p><p>	Malfoy shook his
head, “I didn't-”</p><p>	“You won't
get away with this! Just let me go now it-” <i>will be easier
for y-</i></p><p>	“That's
better,” Draco said, lowering his wand. “I know you have
no manners, but you could at least try to listen.”</p><p>	<i>Let me talk!
Let me-! Damn you! Fuck you fuck you!</i> Harry snarled.</p><p>	“I didn't do
this to you,” Malfoy said, “but I did bring you here.”</p><p>	<i>Let me go! Let
me go! Let me leave! Let me go back to my family! You fuck!</i></p><p>	Malfoy stared at
him thoughtfully, tapping his finger on the table.</p><p>	<i>Where's Ginny?!
And James? ...James... Please. Let me go back home. I want to see
them! Please! </i>Harry pleaded.</p><p>	“Perhaps, it
would be more expedient just to show you,” Malfoy said. He
picked up his wand and Harry could hear him conjure something.</p><p>	Malfoy picked him
up and turned, the world falling out from under him with a lurch.</p><p>	The walls were
entirely covered in bookshelves. There was a small settee and table
by a small fireplace, a door and Harry could see Malfoy. He couldn't
see himself. He could see Malfoy reflected in a mirror, but where
Harry should have been, there was another mirror.</p><p>	Harry didn't
understand. 
</p><p>	It didn't make
sense. 
</p><p>	Malfoy walked
closer, “Do you see now?”</p><p>	 The mirror in
Malfoy's hands was an oval, about the size of a dinner plate, the
surface cloudy like a grey mist was trapped beneath the glass.</p><p>	“Now, if
you'll behave. We can talk like civilised human beings,” Malfoy
turned and set him back down on the table, casting that spell over
him again.</p><p>	“...Was I
cursed?” Harry asked in a measured tone, fighting to keep the
panic out of his voice.</p><p>	“It's not a
curse, Potter,” Malfoy said.</p><p>	“If you take
me to the ministry. The aurors will-”</p><p>	“Put you
right back where I found you, I'd imagine,” Malfoy said flatly.</p><p>	“Put me
back?” Harry repeated numbly.</p><p>	Malfoy nodded, “In
the cupboard I found you in.” He held up a large thin metal
box, “Locked in this.”</p><p>	“In that
box,” Harry said flatly</p><p>	“And I would
be in quite a lot of trouble for theft,” Malfoy said.</p><p>	Harry want to
shake his head, to back away but he couldn't. He couldn't even hope
to, trapped in a mirror, “Why am I in a mirror? Why was I
locked away? Aren't they trying to save me? Isn't anyone doing-
something?”</p><p>	Malfoy sighed and
sat down, tipping Harry's mirror up he could still see him. “I
occasionally work for the department of mysteries-”</p><p>	“I hadn't
heard you were working there,” Harry interrupted.</p><p>	Malfoy narrowed
his eyes, “Unofficially, of course. They wouldn't want my
filthy name tainting their reputation.” 
</p><p>	Harry wasn't sure
he believed it. He'd been an auror for years and, they worked with
the Unspeakables pretty often. He couldn't remember ever seeing
Malfoy there.</p><p>	Malfoy sniffed and
went on, “The head of mind and memory research was working on a
spell that could copy a person's mind and store it in a primed
magical instrument.”</p><p>	“Why?”
Harry asked.</p><p>	“So
impatient, Potter.” Malfoy said distastefully, “Let me
finish if you please or I'll have to silence you again.”</p><p>	Harry choked down
his automatic complaint in a wave of panic at the idea of being
unable to speak again.</p><p>	“Better,”
Malfoy said, “The idea was that if a person had an accident
that damaged or destroyed their mind, they would have a back-up, a
copy,” he gestured to Harry. “Naturally, the aurors were
the perfect candidates to test the idea. It's a shame none of you
suffered any head injuries or tricky obliviates since the program
started.”</p><p>	Malfoy frowned in
thought and grabbed a sheaf of parchment from the desk, flipping
through the notes.</p><p>	Harry's mind was
whirling. It was horrible. It was just too horrible. It couldn't- It
just couldn't be.</p><p>	“How long
have you been aware?” Malfoy asked without looking up.</p><p>	“I-”
Harry couldn't focus. There had to be something- a better explanation
than this, “...I don't remember a spell that would copy my
memory.”</p><p>	“I wouldn't
think you would,” Malfoy said.</p><p>	“I would. I
think I would,” Harry said, grasping desperately after the
idea.</p><p>	Malfoy patiently
explained, “Memories are largely imprinted when we sleep, you
wouldn't remember the day the spell was cast-”</p><p>	“But I would
remember the days before, and we'd be debriefed first,” Harry
said, “We always have to sign disclosures and contracts before
we work with the Unspeakables. That's how it's always gone. This
isn't right-”</p><p>	“Yes, well
perhaps this time was-”</p><p>	“This is a
<i>trick</i> or- or a <i>trap</i>!” Harry raised his voice over
Malfoy's. Harry couldn't stand to hear any more out of his mouth. He
<i>couldn't</i>, “I was preparing for a massive raid, the whole
department was! Something went wrong! I've been captured and this is
a trick, or I'm delusional! This is just a potion fever, and none-”<i>of
it is real. And...and... I'm going to...wake up.	Soon.		soon.</i></p><p>	“Good
grief,” Malfoy said in utter exasperation. He put his wand back
down with a click and stood up, dropping his notes and grabbing
Harry.</p><p>	Harry saw the box
out of the corner of his eye, and he was flooded with panic, <i>No no
nonono, I'll be good, I'll be- don't. Don't, please!</i></p><p>	But Malfoy turned
him past the box and to the curtained window behind the desk. He
pushed the heavy fabric back just far enough to put Harry on the
windowsill, the edge of the mirror pressing to the glass.</p><p>	It was beautiful
outside. The lawns were green, trees were budding, roses were
blooming and, there were birds singing happily in the sunshine.</p><p>	It almost looked
like spring.</p><p>	A group of white
peacocks moved between perfectly manicured hedges</p><p>	It couldn't be
spring. 
</p><p>	It had been
september. 
</p><p>	It was autumn. Not
spring.</p><p>	Not...</p><p>	...</p><p>	Nightmares.</p><p>	Harry knew about
nightmares. He had them all his life. He knew the worst kinds a
person could ever get. He'd never had one like this. He'd never known
such a beautiful view could be the most frightening of them all.</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
</p><p>	He watched the clouds blow across an endless blue horizon that turned pink as the sun set. He watched the stars and the moon cross the sky. Days
came and nights passed. 
</p><p>	It was easier with
something to watch, to focus his mind on and a way to keep track of
time. For all his efforts though, sometimes, in the darkest nights
when clouds stole all the light from the world, and it was like being
in the box all over again, he would think about Ginny and James,
about Hermione and Ron, Molly and Ginny, Nev and Luna, his friends-
his <i>family</i>.</p><p>	He felt lost.</p><p>	But no one came to
find him.</p><p>	Did they know he
was missing?</p><p>	Was he missed?</p><p>	Or 
</p><p>	or</p><p>	was...</p><p>	was it-?</p><p>	The afternoon of
the fifth day, Malfoy grabbed the mirror again in a horrible blur of
movement.</p><p>	“Hello,
Potter. We're going on a little field trip,” Malfoy said, he
tapped his wand on the mirror frame, murmuring an illusion charm,
“You make a lovely painting.”</p><p>	Malfoy tucked
Harry under his arm and set off down the long endless hallways.</p><p>	“And- no I
won't be removing the silencing charm. Also, don't get any ideas
about this happening more than this once.” Malfoy said briskly,
“This is for demonstration purposes only.”</p><p>	Malfoy stepped
through a massive floo fireplace and into the Ministry atrium. He
walked along the edge of the room, lifting Harry and balancing him on
the top of a small display case that gave him a view over the whole
room. A podium had been set up at the corner in a very familiar way. 
</p><p>	This was a press
conference. Harry was used to being the one behind the podium, not in
the crowd but he still recognised the reporters from Witch Weekly,
the Prophet and the Quibbler. There also seemed to be a lot of folks
from the auror's and a few other departments. Everyone there looked
familiar.</p><p>	“Let's get
this over with, alright?”</p><p>	Harry watched
<i>himself</i> walk up to the podium.</p><p>	He looked tired.</p><p>	His hair was a
mess and his stubble was worse than normal.</p><p>	And-</p><p>	And he was holding
James on one hip. James looked half asleep, rubbing his cheek against
Harry's shoulder grumpily.</p><p>	James had grown.
So much.</p><p>	Harry at the
podium held up a hand for silence, “I'm only going to say this
once then I'm going back, and you lot can bugger off for-” he
sighed, “-at least a couple days? Have a heart?” He joked
and grinned tiredly.</p><p>	The crowd chuckled
in response.</p><p>	Harry nodded, “So,
Ginny's fine, no problems or complications. The baby's alright.”</p><p>	<i>the baby? It's
not- Ginny just told me she was-</i></p><p>	“It's a
boy,” Harry went on and couldn't hide the smile of pure delight
on his face, “he's called Albus Severus Potter, in honour of
some of the most influential people in my life, Albus Dumbledore and
Severus Snape.”</p><p>	Malfoy snorted
under his breath, “<i><span>Albus
Severus</span></i>?”</p><p>	“Who does he
take after?” The Witch Weekly journalist asked.</p><p>	Harry grinned, “Me
I'm afraid.”</p><p>	The crowd laughed.</p><p>	James whined
loudly, clutching at Harry's shirt.</p><p>	Harry laughed and
rubbed James back. “That means time's up. Black hair, green
eyes, eight pounds, seven ounces, healthy as a horse. Alright? You
can get your pictures later,” Harry said quickly, already
heading off the podium to the Minister's office where he'd probably
floo back to St. Mungo's.</p><p>	Malfoy picked the
mirror back up and carried it back to the floo and through the manor.
He set the mirror down on his desk and removed the silencing spell.</p><p>	“So now you
see. It's not a trick or a trap,” Malfoy said, sweeping his
cloak from his shoulders and dropping it on a waiting house elf.</p><p>	“...I <i>am</i>
the mirror.”</p><p>	Malfoy frowned, “I
suppose that's an acceptable interpretation.” 
</p><p>	“...It's
spring...”</p><p>	“The end of
March,” Malfoy clarified.</p><p>	“...”</p><p>	Malfoy sat down,
“Now we can have a decent conversation, I hope. No more yelling
or accusations?”</p><p>	The chair squeaked
as Malfoy leaned back. “How long were you aware?” he
asked.</p><p>	The chair squeaked
as Malfoy leaned forward, “Potter? Are you there?”</p><p>	He cast spell
after spell over the mirror with a frown and finally left in a huff
or annoyance.</p><p>	Night passed into
day, and it wasn't until late evening that Malfoy returned, throwing
a dark travel cloak onto the floor and dropping back into his chair
heavily.</p><p>	“Are you
there Potter?” Malfoy asked. He smoothed his hair, leaning back
with a sigh, “...I went back to storage they were keeping you
in. There were fourteen mirrors in all. They were all silent except
one. Weasley's copy spoke briefly-”</p><p>	“Ron?”
The mirror asked faintly.</p><p>	Malfoy sat
forward, “You're still- Thank Merlin.”</p><p>	“What
happened?”</p><p>	“To
Weasley?” Malfoy asked, “He didn't seem to realise it was
me. He rambled about Granger for quite a while. I thought he was
lucid at first and then he laughed for nearly ten minutes and went
just as silent as the rest. It seems you're the only one who made it,
Potter.”</p><p>	“Don't call
me that,” The mirror said quietly. 
</p><p>	“Don't call
you-”</p><p>	“That name!
Don't call me that name!” The mirror snapped, “That's not
<i>me</i>. That's him. I'm just a copy, I was just- I've only <i>been</i>
for seven months.”</p><p>	“Technically,
you were the same person until then,” Malfoy said.</p><p>	“No. <i>NO</i>.”
The mirror snarled, “He has a body, and a family and friends
and I have <i>nothing!</i> I can't touch or move or smell anything.
Until you came along, I couldn't even speak! I was trapped in hell,
thinking that if I held on long enough everything- e-everything-”</p><p>	“It's...
unfortunate,” Malfoy said.</p><p>	“I thought
of them,” the mirror whispered, “I remembered my- his
life. It kept me from going mad... I- I just wanted to go back to them.”</p><p>	Malfoy nodded
silently.</p><p>	The mirror added,
“And it was all a lie....”</p><p>	“And what
are you going to do?” Malfoy asked.</p><p>	“Do? <i>Do</i>?
I can't <i>do</i> anything! I'm a bloody picture frame!”</p><p>	“A mirror,”
Malfoy said, “And what I <i>meant</i>, if you'd stop and listen
for half a second, is are you going to give up or go on?”</p><p>	“Go on...
give up?” the mirror repeated numbly.</p><p>	Malfoy stood, “I
can, after all, destroy you if you'd prefer-”</p><p>	“<i>Destroy</i>-!”</p><p>	“<i>Or</i>,
you can make a new life, can't you? You could start over. You can
decide who you want to be,” Malfoy said.</p><p>	“I'm still
just a bloody mirror! What starting over is there?!” the mirror
asked.</p><p>	Malfoy smiled, “I
thought you'd never ask.”</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
</p><p>	Beside, what
turned out to be Malfoy personal study, was his workshop. There was a
multitude of glassware and cauldrons, a worktable and shelves filled
with bottles of strange and horrible things.</p><p>	Malfoy carried the
mirror into the corner of the room where a something... a figure of
some sort lay on the wood.</p><p>	“What...
what is that?” the mirror asked.</p><p>	Malfoy lifted the
mirror so he could see better, “Just a clay figure right now.
Do you know much about homunculi or golems?”</p><p>	“A- What?”
the mirror asked looked at the figure made of dark brown clay.</p><p>	Malfoy sighed,
“This is basic alchemy, Po- You. Even muggles know about
golems.”</p><p>	“I think
I've heard of them, golems anyway. They're clay men, like this?”</p><p>	“Yes. A
golem is a soulless servant made of clay or stone. It can be ordered
to do any task, but in the end, it's a tool. A golem cannot act or
think on its own.” Malfoy said. “A homunculus, on the
other hand, is a living, independent being formed mostly of blood
magic.”</p><p>	“That's....”</p><p>	“Illegal,
technically,” Malfoy finished. “I know. It's rather
useless to me anyway because a homunculus is small, only about a foot
high.”</p><p>	“Useless?
Useless why? What are you trying to do?” the mirror asked.</p><p>	Malfoy propped the
mirror up on the massive worktable in the centre of the room, “I
want to make a man of course. Living breathing, indistinguishable
from any other, man.”</p><p>	“And you
need me?”</p><p>	Malfoy nodded
excitedly, “A golem, made like a homunculus, with the mind of
man.”</p><p>	The mirror looked
at the diagrams and notes littering the table, “I could... I
could feel things again and walk and... taste? I suppose I wouldn't
need to eat...”</p><p>	Malfoy said, “It
might occur you can do everything a person can. You would be the
first after all. It's impossible to say for certain what will happen
or if it will even be successful.”</p><p>	“I see...”
the mirror said hesitantly.</p><p>	“You could
be anyone,” Malfoy said, his voice soft and cajoling,
“Polyjuice potion is mixed into the very fabric of the clay.
Since there's no overriding person beneath, no inherit magical
signature, once changed you would never change back.”</p><p>	The mirror felt
numb, mentally holding his breath as he waited for what he knew
Malfoy was going to say.</p><p>	“You could
even have <i>his</i> body, Potter...You could take the life, take his
place. No one would ever know,” Malfoy murmured, a wicked gleam
in his eye, “So. Who do you want to be?”</p><p>	“I-”
he hesitated, “...Let me think.”</p><p>	“Of course,”
Malfoy said, leaning back. “Where do you want to think?”</p><p>	“The
window.”</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
</p><p>	“You said I
could be anyone?” the mirror asked.</p><p>	Malfoy took the
mirror out of the window, an excited gleam in his eye, “Anyone.”</p><p>	“Just one
person or could I mix two people?”</p><p>	Malfoy's brow
furrowed.</p><p>	“I don't
want to be anyone else. I want to be someone new. If I mixed two
hairs, would I be like a mix of the two of them?” the mirror
asked. 
</p><p>	Malfoy took out a
quill and wrote down a few lines on a sheet of parchment,
“Perhaps...” he tapped the feather against his chin,
“I'll do some tests.” He turned to the mirror, “You
know who you want to be then? Is it-?”</p><p>	“Not <i>him</i>.”
the mirror said, “I want to be a Black. Sirius Black was the closest
thing I ever had to family- ...he had to family.”</p><p>	“My mother
and I are the only living Blacks in England,” Malfoy said.</p><p>	“Sirius grew
up in Grimmauld place-”</p><p>	“That-”
Malfoy shook his head, “Potter owns that property-”</p><p>	“And I know
where it is,” the mirror said, “I know how to get past the
wards. I know where Sirius' room is, and his brother's. I want both
of them. I want to be a mix of Sirius and Regulus. </p><p>	Malfoy was silent,
tapping the quill uneasily on the desktop.</p><p>	“He never
fixed the place up or cleaned it out. Finding a hair or two wouldn't
be hard. Especially in Regulus' room, it was left untouched,”
the mirror said.</p><p>	“You're
asking a lot,” Malfoy said.</p><p>	The mirror said,
“The least you can do is make me who I want to be.”</p><p>	Malfoy frowned.</p><p>	“You <i>need</i>
me.”</p><p> 	Malfoy grimaced
and nodded reluctantly, “Very well, Mr Black.”</p><p>	“Mr Black,”
Black repeated with vindictive satisfaction.</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
</p><p>	It was raining.
Black could hear it all around them as Malfoy carried him up the dark
streets to Grimmauld Place. He didn't have to ask when they arrived;
he heard the building sliding out from where it was concealed once
Malfoy was close enough. Malfoy shifted his grip on the mirror as he
took out his wand and began murmuring the spells that would allow him through the wards.</p><p>	As soon as they
were inside Malfoy shook off his water sodden cloak with a muttered
complaint.</p><p>	“Who are
you?” a shrill woman's voice asked.</p><p>	Malfoy froze only
for a moment then answered smoothly, “Walburga Black. Don't worry. I won't be long. I'm just causing some trouble for the filthy
half-blood that stole this place.”</p><p>	The old woman's
portrait was still curtained over, but her silence seemed to be
permission enough. Malfoy would have to hurry regardless. <i>He</i>
had set all his wards to be in tune with his magical signature. If he
wasn't asleep, he might notice the change, and they'd find themselves
in an unpleasant situation. 
</p><p>	Malfoy trudged up
the stairs, trying his weight on every creaking step before moving
up. Black would have chastised him but Malfoy's caution proved
prudent when one of the steps, damp with rot, snapped like a
soggy crisp.</p><p>	“Regulus' room is on the right,” Black said when they reached the top
floor.</p><p>	Malfoy stepped
inside, lighting the room with a lumos and setting the mirror on the
bed. Regulus was a very tidy person but, amongst the settled dust, he
found ten black hairs in between the floorboards.</p><p>	Sirius' room was harder; he'd run away when he was sixteen, and the Kreacher had
been very thorough in his departure.</p><p>	“Are there
any clothes?” Black asked, staring at a stained ceiling from
the small desk he'd been left on. “Muggle clothes might have
been left untouched; there might be something caught on them.”</p><p>	“...There's
an ugly leather jacket,” Malfoy said, “and three long
hairs caught in the zipper. There might be more-” Malfoy's
breath caught, “The wards-”</p><p>	And down below the
door opened.</p><p>	“Who's
there?” <i>His</i> voice boomed through the house, “You've
broken into private property!”</p><p>	“Hey! We
have to go!” Black hissed, “We have to leave now, before
he changes the wards!”</p><p>	The floors
creaked as <i>He</i> moved slowly down the entrance hall towards the
stairs, “I don't know what you're after but if you surrender
now things will be a lot easier.” 
</p><p>	“Pick me up
and apparate us out of here!” Black snapped.</p><p>	“I've
already called for backup.” <i>He</i> shouted as he started up
the stairs, “I'd rather finish this before they get here.
Wouldn't you?”</p><p>	“Damn it!
Move you useless fuck!” Black shouted.</p><p>	Malfoy moved,
stumbling over to the desk, as below <i>He</i> started running up the
stairs.</p><p>	“shitshitshit”
Malfoy repeated like a mantra under his breath as he fumbled for his
wand, his face even paler than normal.</p><p>	There was a crash
and a snarl of pain as <i>He</i> fell through the broken stair.</p><p>	“<i>Go</i>,”
Black ordered.</p><p>	Malfoy nodded and
apparated them back to the manor.</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
</p><p>	Malfoy sat panting
on the floor after they landed, hands shaking. He was still holding
onto Sirius' old leather jacket, his eyes too wide.</p><p>	“You got
everything?” Black asked.</p><p>	The jacket
crumpled as Malfoy's grip tightened, “You complete and utter
asshole!”</p><p>	“Me?”
Black said, “I wasn't the one that froze.”</p><p>	Malfoy shot to his
feet, hurling the crumpled leather onto the floor, “You're a
bloody useless mirror! Whose ego and- and brash, moronic tendencies
haven't changed at all since school!”</p><p>	“I've never
been to school,” Black said icily, “<i>I'm not him.</i>”</p><p>	“<i>HA</i>!
In everything but body. And we both know you would give anything to
have your life back!” Malfoy snapped and stomped out of the
room before Black could respond.</p><p>	Black seethed,
“<i>Fuck</i> Him. <i>Fuck</i> His perfect little life. <i>Fuck</i>
Him for making me and leaving me to die.” Black wished he could
hit something, do anything other than stare at a vaulted ceiling.
“And we both bloody well know you came to find me in that
room!” he yelled into the empty room for his own satisfaction,
“<i>You</i> picked <i>me</i> you fucking prat!”</p><p>	Too soon the anger
passed and left boredom in its wake, with only the slowly changing
light and the stretching shadows to tell him the passage of time.</p><p>	Malfoy didn't
return until the next morning, picking Black up with a frown. Dark
circles ringed his eyes, “I've decided I can't be around you as
much as I have. It's bad for my nerves.”</p><p>	Black laughed,
“Your nerves?!”</p><p>	Malfoy sneered at
him and went on, “But of course, I can't have you going mad.”</p><p>	“That would
certainly be a tragedy,” Black said flatly.</p><p>	Malfoy's face
twitched. He turned and turned the mirror towards the floor, showing
Black a child-sized clay person that looked like a peg doll with
stumpy round legs and stumpy round arms that ended in little round
fingers. It had no mouth or nose, or any features whatsoever aside
from two eye holes filled with red light.</p><p>	“This golem
is for your use,” Malfoy said, “It will take you anywhere
in the manor and out in the gardens. It can get books, hold them and
turn pages for you. Just stay inside the walls. My golems are
powered by the core of this estate. If you leave, it will dissolve.
Understand?”</p><p>	“Yeah, I
think so-”</p><p>	“Fine.”
Malfoy interrupted shortly and turned the mirror around, putting it
into the outstretched arms of the golem, “I have a lot of work
to do. So don't interrupt me.” He started leaving and paused,
saying over his shoulder, “You ought to pick out a proper name.
I left an astronomy book out on one of the tables of the library.”</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
</p><p>	Black didn't go to
the library. He ordered the golem to take him outside. The golem
moved slowly but so smoothly it was almost like he was floating.
The faint <i>tmph tmph</i> of the golem's little feet was the only
sign he was being carried.</p><p>	He had the
golem to circle the massive, dour Malfoy manor and then to the many
flower beds. It was nice, at first, seeing all the blooming flowers and pale
green grass up close. But somehow it made everything worse. When he
watched through the window, he didn't have to think about how he
couldn't feel the wind or the sun. He didn't have to think about how
he was forever bound to a window. That.... that he'd never actually felt the
sun or wind. That every food he had a memory of eating was a fabric of His
life. It was all a lie of something he'd never had or would have. 
</p><p>	The golem held him
on a low sloping hill, and Black watched a breeze move across the
grass. He watched the sunset and the stars move across the sky and
sunrise again, covered by clouds. It rained all day and into the
night. The next day dawned in heavy blankets of fog that weren't
burned off until the sun was high and yet by evening it was drizzling
again. Black lost track of how many days passed.</p><p>	The world startled
into movement when the golem picked up the mirror without warning and
trundled him back inside. The golem didn't respond to any of Black's
orders. Black wasn't even sure where they were going until the golem
pushed its way into Malfoy's workroom. 
</p><p>	“There you
are,” Malfoy said as the door closed, not bothering to look up
from the mess of papers strewn across his table, “I thought
maybe you'd gotten lost. Or the golem had fallen down the stairs and
smashed. They're not good at stairs.” He looked up and frowned
faintly, “You're starting to rust.”</p><p>	“... I was
outside,” Black said faintly, not certain of his own voice.</p><p>	Malfoy
straightened up, “What? Since I saw you last?”</p><p>	“Yeah,”
Black said.</p><p>	“It's been
over two weeks! What were you doing?” Malfoy asked.</p><p>	Black felt
confused, “Watching.”</p><p>	“Watching
what?”</p><p>	“Everything,”
Black said.</p><p>	Malfoy stared at
him, his breathing a little too fast. He looked down at the table and
shook his head, “It's just as well I called you here to tell
you I'm going to do it tomorrow.”</p><p>	“Do-?”</p><p>	“The
transfer, to the new- <i>your</i> new body,” Malfoy said,
gesturing to the clay figure. It looked far more human now, like a
mannequin.</p><p>	Black stared at
the figure.</p><p>	“Po-Black?”</p><p>	“Will... you
be able to control me like you do the golem?” Black asked.</p><p>	Malfoy started to
shake his head.</p><p>	“Because I
think I'd rather be dead.”</p><p>	Malfoy started,
“Merlin, Black. <i>No</i>. I can control the golems because
they have no free will. The entire point of using your consciousness
is that you have free will.”</p><p>	“That's
good,” Black said.</p><p>	Malfoy hesitated,
“There is-” he cleared his throat, “The only way to
maintain the new golem is to tie it to the house core.”</p><p>	“I won't be
able to leave the grounds,” Black said.</p><p>	“This body
is more fragile than a human one. If it crumbles your consciousness
will die. You will die,” Malfoy said reluctantly.</p><p>	“Fine.”
Black said.</p><p>	Malfoy tapped his
fingers on the table, “Did you pick out a name at least?”</p><p>	Black said the
first constellation that came to mind, “Orion.”</p><p>	Malfoy nodded,
“Hopefully it will be a name I can actually put to use. You may
go. I'll have the golem bring you in the morning when I'm ready.”</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
</p><p>	Black wondered
what it would be like to die. But then he also had to wonder what it
would be like to live as well, truly live. 
</p><p>	He had the golem
take him back to the window in Malfoy's study and watched the world
until the morning came and the golem carried him back to the
workroom.</p><p>	Malfoy picked him
up and set the mirror beside the clay figure's head, “I can't
guarantee this will work. I can't guarantee anything will happen for
certain.”</p><p>	“Just do
it,” Black said. 
</p><p>	Malfoy raised an
eyebrow, “I plan to.” He lifted his wand, “This
might hurt. Or it may feel like nothing at all.” He began
chanting a string of spells, his wand moving between the mirror and
the clay form in a figure eight.</p><p>	Everything went
dark.</p><p>	Black couldn't
hear or see.</p><p>	It was just like-</p><p>	And then he was
being stretched, his seams being pulled loose, threads snapping with
a sort of breathless shock and then a breath- it hurt to take. Black
felt so heavy. He felt like a thousand pounds, a mountain laid on the soil
and begged to move. He breathed. The wood under his back was too hard
and rough. So rough- it was too much. It was- he wanted it gone, it
was so much it hurt.</p><p>	He groaned with a
far deeper voice than he remembered.</p><p>	“Merlin-”
Malfoy said faintly, “It worked?”</p><p>	Black pressed his
hands to the table, tried to push himself up, but it hurt. He
clutched his hands to his chest. He could touch his own skin at
least. It was smooth and delicate as a child's.</p><p>	The smell hit him
all at once- chemical and rot mixed with sweet cloying herbs. He
gagged and covered his nose, tears pricking at his eyes.</p><p>	“What is it?
Are you in pain?” Malfoy asked.</p><p>	“Too much,”
Black choked out, “stinks, table hurts.”</p><p>	Malfoy nodded, “Of
course, after being without those senses for nearly eight months you
would be overly sensitive to them.” He waved his wand and
levitated Black up off the table and out of the room.</p><p>	The smells eased,
but the hall was cold and he was soon racked with shivers. Black
couldn't keep track of what was happening. All his mind seemed to be
able to focus on was the new and overwhelming sensations that
assaulted him from every direction. 
</p><p>	The world slowly
began to make sense. Smells were the easiest to get slowly used to.
Malfoy had put him in a bed with silk sheets that were not awful, in
a room that smelled only faintly of freshly laundered linens. He was
able to manage the blandest foods, gruel, unbuttered toast, and
worked to incorporate more flavours over time. The carpets would
still made his feet ache when he got up to piss, but he got used
them. He got used to everything. 
</p><p>	He pulled on his
first shirt and trousers, spelled to fit him and made of a soft,
delicate fabric woven with heating charms. He had to use a cane to
lean on, his feet still aching from trying to stand for more than a
few moments at a time. 
</p><p>	Malfoy was there,
as he always seemed to be, his eyes glittering with fierce pride,
“How do you feel?”</p><p>	“Better,”
Black said, his voice still sounding strange in his own ears.</p><p>	Malfoy nodded,
“You look better. Your appearance- It's quite uncanny how much
you resemble the Black brothers, but you're just different
enough.”</p><p>	“I look-?”
Black said reaching up to drag his fingers through the black hair
that reached past his shoulders.</p><p>	“You look to
be a teenager I would wager.” Malfoy went on taking out his
wand, “I had doubts about your request, but mixing two hairs of
people already dead was quite clever.” he conjured a
full-length mirror in front of Black. “You see?”</p><p>	Black saw himself
reflected in a mirror-</p><p>	His knuckles
burned as he pulled his hand back, glass shattering to the ground
around his feet.</p><p>	Malfoy stared in
shock. It took him several seconds to gather his wits about himself
enough to vanish the broken mess, “I suppose I should have
anticipated that.” Malfoy said flatly, “I shall have all
the mirrors in the manor removed in all due haste.”</p><p>	Black grimaced at
his bleeding knuckles. He could remember the brief flash he saw of
himself, pale and thin, and dark of hair, looking like the haunted
corpse of a man.</p><p>	“Let me heal
that,” Malfoy said, holding his wand out and then freezing. He
spun back towards the door his eyes widening in alarm, “Someone's
here. You-” he waved at Black as he hurried through the door,
wand still clutched tightly in hand, “I'll be back.”</p><p>	Black tightened
his grip on his cane, grimacing with each step as he followed
Malfoy's disappearing back down the hallway. Once he lost sight of
Malfoy, he followed the faint sound of voices, familiar voices that
made his jaw clench tightly in unnamed rage. Black finally reached
the foyer where he found Malfoy, tense as a coiled spring, stiffly
answering questions from two aurors.</p><p>	“If you
didn't find any trace of my being there,” Malfoy said, “I
don't see how you can accuse me of-”</p><p>	“We're not
accusing you of anything, Malfoy,” Ron Weasley said.</p><p>	“You said I
was a suspect in, what? Some sort house robbery?” Malfoy said
sourly, “Do you really think I would stoop so low?”</p><p>	“We have a
lot of suspects,” Harry Potter said, “We'd like your
fingerprints.”</p><p>	“My what?”
Malfoy snapped.</p><p>	Potter held up his
hands and wiggled his fingers, “Fingerprints. Everyone's are
different. Even muggles have managed fingerprinting.”</p><p>	Malfoy frowned, “I
don't see why I ought to give you anything with all these
accusations-!”</p><p>	“It's not
looking good, you putting up this much of a fuss,” Weasley
said.</p><p>	They all turned as
the floor creaked under Black's cane. 
</p><p>	Potter went ashen
as Black slowly limped his way down the hall.</p><p>	Weasley's eyes
widened, “Is that-?”</p><p>	“Sirius...?”
Potter asked faintly.</p><p>	Black slowly
passed Malfoy. He stopped just in front of Potter and stared down at
him.</p><p>	“This is my
cousin,” Malfoy said, “Orion Black. He's staying with me
to recover from a long illness.”</p><p>	“O-Oh,”
Potter said, “You look like- like someone I knew. Sirius
Black.”</p><p>	Black nodded,
“Yes.”</p><p>	“They're
related, distantly,” Malfoy said, “I've been telling
Orion about them. Now, why don't you leave and let my cousin get back
to his rest.”</p><p>	“Fingerprints,”
Weasley prompted Potter under his breath.</p><p>	Potter swallowed
hard and shook his head.</p><p>	Weasley sighed,
“We'll be back, Malfoy.”</p><p>	Malfoy watched
them go with his arms folded tightly across his chest. When the door
clicked firmly shut, he muttered darkly, “When you come back
you can speak with my lawyer.”</p><p>	Black turned back
towards Malfoy, his mind a muggy whirlwind of things half remembered
and half forcibly forgotten, “I hate them.”</p><p>	Malfoy smirked
faintly, “Yes. I do as well.” He stretched out his hands, “Do you know anything about
fingerprints?”</p><p>	“I know what
he meant,” Black said.</p><p>	Malfoy slowly
dropped his hands, “They'll have to be changed.”</p><p>	“Yes,”
Black agreed.</p><p>	“And there's
one particular mirror that needs to be vanished just to be safe.”</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
</p><p>	 The aurors came
back, but by then Malfoy had transfigured his fingerprints. He let
the aurors take them but referred all other questions to his lawyer.
Black's mirror was destroyed, and the wards and secret walls hiding
Malfoy's study and workroom had been reinforced several times over as
well.</p><p>	Black walked, as
much as he could, as far as he could and slowly got stronger. He
couldn't bring himself to stop, being able to see and move and feel,
he never wanted to be without ever again. So he moved and looked at
everything, smelled touched everything he could. </p><p>Black properly explored the Manor for the first time. And found it empty. Half the rooms were locked, a great many of the rest were full of sheet-covered furniture and an untouched layer of dust. There was no sign of Malfoy's parents. There were no house elves. It was just Malfoy, his silent golems and Black.
</p><p>	Black didn't like
sleep. His body demanded so much of it and that moment he had to lay down
with his eyes closed as sleep came felt far too much like
being trapped in the mirror all over again. So he didn't sleep. He avoided it as much as he could, even when his mind felt like it was
unravelling at the edges.</p><p>	The aurors didn't
come back again, though Black had been certain they would. Instead,
it was Malfoy, returning in a flurry after one of his rare outings.</p><p>	 Malfoy tracked down Black in the gardens, snarling through his teeth, “Those
<i>bastards</i>!”</p><p>	Black waited,
knowing Malfoy would fill the silence.</p><p>	“They barred
me from the Department of Mysteries! What right do they have-!”
He broke off to growl in frustration.</p><p>	“You don't
work there,” Black said.</p><p>	Malfoy glared at
him, “As if that absolute moron in Alchemical studies would
have managed even a modicum of the work he has without my help! And
they're monitoring my potion ingredient purchases. I've been barred
from buying several very important things I <i>need</i> for my work.”</p><p>	Black cupped his
hand around a rose, running his thumb over the soft petals.</p><p>	“Potter has
gone too far this time. He thinks he can do whatever he likes. He'll regret this," Malfoy hissed and stormed back to the
manor. 
</p><p>	Black slowly
unclenched his hand, letting petals flutter to the ground. 
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
</p><p>	Malfoy stayed in
his workroom for- Black didn't know. He wasn't sure how much time had
passed before he realised he hadn't seen Malfoy for a while. Black
couldn't enter Malfoy's workroom nor was there anyone to ask what he
was doing in there. The small golems that worked around the manor had
neither minds nor voices and wouldn't obey Black anyway. 
</p><p>	One night, Malfoy burst into Black's room when he was meant to be sleeping but couldn't stand the blackness behind his eyes.</p><p>	Malfoy was thin,
his hair a greasy knotted mess, he looked like hadn't slept for days,
and his clothes were wrinkled and thin from repeated reckless
cleaning charms. He approached Black with a long necklace clutched in
both hands, a silver gilded, blood coloured gem hanging from the
heavy chain. He placed it over Black's neck and slipped the stone
under his shirt where it buzzed faintly against his skin. In one hand
Malfoy pressed two glass marbles, in the other, a knife.</p><p>	“The gem
contains enough power to keep you alive for an hour, perhaps more,”
Malfoy said, his voice shaking, “The marbles are portkeys, I
made them. They're very very illegal,” he grinned manically,
“One will drop you right on Potter's doorstep. The other will
bring you back. You only have twenty minutes, but that should be
plenty.”</p><p>	Black lifted the
knife.</p><p>	“Just a
knife,” Malfoy said.</p><p>	“You want me
to kill him?” Black asked, his voice hoarse from disuse.</p><p>	Malfoy shrugged,
“Kill him, scare him, destroy his couch. It's up to you.”</p><p>	“Why me? Why
not you?” Black asked.</p><p>	Malfoy shook his
head, “Me? No. HA. <i>No</i>. I'd be caught. I'd freeze like I
did before. I'm a coward. But you-” He wrapped his hand around
Blacks holding the knife. “You hate him.” Malfoy nodded
encouragingly, “Potter did this to you. He took everything from
you. Look at you! Look at what you've become!”</p><p>	Black caught a
glimpse of his reflection  in the window and flinched at the gaunt
figure he saw there, looking more like Sirius than ever, the Sirius
he- Potter had known, a prison haunted man.</p><p>	“You hate
him,” Malfoy repeated softly, “He made you- he selfishly
made you and left you to suffer and die in the dark. He left you to
go mad with nothing- <i>nothing</i> of your own.”</p><p>	Black picked up
his leather jacket and squeezed the marbles tight to his palms,
“Twenty minutes.”</p><p>	“Yes,”
Malfoy nodded.</p><p>	“When?”
Black asked.</p><p>	“Any moment
n-”</p><p>	Black's feet hit
the cobbled path of the front garden of the neat little house with
the blue trim. The night was pleasantly cool, and Black took a moment
to slip his jacket on. Clouds blocked most of the light from the sky.
A single muggle porch light cast a gloom across the untidy bushes and
neatly trimmed lawn. 
</p><p>	Black could feel
the wards of the place at his back Malfoy had somehow managed to
transport him inside them. There were no lights coming on, no shouts
or even whispers of warning. He had twenty minutes.</p><p>	Black didn't
bother with the front door. He knew Potter would have covered them in
detection spells that would hurt anyone unfamiliar. The back door
would be even worse, but it had been a hot day, and the breeze was
gentle. He quietly walked around the house, testing every window
until he found one that slid open under his fingers. 
</p><p>	He put the marbles
in his pocket, and climbed into the kitchen. It still smelled faintly
of fish. Ginny always opened the windows after they had fish, even in
the middle of winter. He moved slowly, letting his mind guide his
feet automatically, to avoid the squeaky floorboard, the picture of
the Weasley's that stuck out a little too far and up the steps,
stepping on the outside, so only the faintest creak was left to give
him away. At the top of the landing, he turned toward the end of the
hall and master bedroom at the end.</p><p>	Black tightened
his grip on the knife.</p><p>	He took a step
forward and froze when he heard the soft sound from an open door, a
small sound like a gurgled sigh.</p><p>	Black followed the
sound into the room with its walls painted like a quidditch pitch
with players flying around in a silent match. A night-light shaped
like a star showed Black the crib against the wall.  
</p><p>Black leaned
over the side. There was a
beautiful little baby with just a trace of black hair
that already was already unruly, and a face that was so familiar. The baby
sleepily opened his eyes and blinked at Black with vibrant green
eyes.</p><p>	Black dropped the
knife, the point sticking in the wood, and slipped his hands
carefully under the little bundle. The baby starting to flail and
make soft noises, not certain if he was going to cry.</p><p>	Black held him
gently to his chest, stroking the back of the baby's head, “Shhh,
it's alright. Everything's going to be alright,” he murmured.</p><p>	The baby gripped
his shirt, and Black placed a hand on the baby's back. Outside, a
door quietly clicked open, and the hall floor creaked as sleepy feet
stumbled down towards the nursery, arriving only to find an empty
crib and an abandoned knife.</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
</p><p>	Malfoy started
forward in his chair as Black appeared in his study, spilling whisky
across his robes, “You're- What- What happened?”</p><p>	Black ignored him,
gently rocking back and forth, rubbing a soothing hand over the
baby's back, who was starting to cry in great heaving sobs from the
shock of being portkeyed.</p><p>	“Merlin.”
Malfoy said faintly, “Fucking Merlin,” he hiccuped and
looked a bit ill, “You took the baby. You- You took- Merlin.”</p><p>	“Everything's
going to be alright,” Black said softly, bouncing the baby
gently in his arms.</p><p>	Malfoy started to
laugh and forced his hand over his mouth to stifle the hysterical
giggles.</p><p>	“I'll need a
crib and bottles, diapers, food,” Black nodded as he spoke, “And toys, lots of toys, and books and stuffed
animals.”</p><p>	Malfoy stood,
wobbling on his feet, “This is- is <i>perfect</i>. This better
than I could have ever imagined.”</p><p>	“You're
going to be so happy,” Black said, “You're going to have
a perfect life.”</p><p>	“Glamours
can make him look like he's mine. I'll find someone I can say was the
mother, a few memory modifications and enough galleons to keep them
quiet...” Malfoy mused, “I could make some polyjuice
variations with my hair, I think my mother kept some from when I was
young. A polyjuice that works like yours Black.”</p><p>	“I'll keep
you safe,” Black murmured as the baby finally began to quiet
even though he continued to squirm.</p><p>	“And we'll
call him...” Malfoy thought for a moment, “...Scorpius.”</p><p>	“That's not
his name,” Black said.</p><p>	Malfoy tsked at
him, “Of course not. It's just for the aurors and the papers.
It's so we're not caught, Black. You don't want them to take him away
do you?”</p><p>	“They can't
have him!” Black snarled, and the baby started crying again,
“He's mine! He's my- my-” he stuttered and broke off.
Black looked down at the little bundle in his arms, squeezing out
tears between wails. Out of the corner of his eye, Black saw his
reflection in the window.</p><p>	“There's so
much to do,” Malfoy said, heading out the door, “I have
so much to get done and not much time to do it in.” he pulled
the door shut behind him.</p><p>	Black sat in one
of the empty chairs in front of the fire. He gently rocked and
murmured soft promises to the baby until he finally began to doze off
from sheer exhaustion.</p><p>	Black gently
touched his cheek, and the baby grabbed his finger for just a second
before he fell asleep, “That's right. Go to sleep.  I'll keep
you safe because... I'm your godfather, and I'll keep you
safe, Harry.”</p></div>
