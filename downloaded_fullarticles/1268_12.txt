    <p>A trio of footsteps pounded through the courtyard, the only thing blanketing the commotion down toward the black lake. All eyes followed the friends as they shot their way past, robes loose and tousled save for the straggler at the end--who couldn’t run as fast as the others, but tried his best to keep up. At the front was James Potter, with his glasses askew on his straight nose, perhaps with a broken arm unable to cling to his right ear. He held above his head an old book, ragged and frayed.</p><p>“Peter!” he yelled, “Peter!”</p><p>Directly behind James was Sirius Black, whose curly black hair was whipping against his cheeks, stray strands caking to them with the blood that dripped from his nostrils, bruises forming around the flesh of his upper lip. He was eagerly pushing James’ back with his hand, urging him to run faster than he could manage. He was thirteen again, almost thrilled by a hunt.</p><p>And then there was Remus Lupin. He was breathing heavy and falling further and further behind. He looked less like their friend and more like a prefect who couldn’t catch a couple of troublemakers. Perhaps, in a different timeline, that would have been what Remus was to them--but, even as they ran down the hill to the lake, leaving Remus in their dust, he knew better.</p><p>Normally, nobody messed with Peter Pettigrew much. Truth be told, there was a lot to tease the guy for; he wasn’t particularly good looking, wasn’t particularly smart, nor particularly brave--and he liked questionable things, like speaking aimlessly into his ham radio, or sitting with and feeding stray vermin on the grounds. One could say that Peter fell behind on a lot of levels. However, there was a kindness to him--a vulnerability of the heart that made him a good and loyal friend. His friendship with Sirius and James protected him--just as it protected Remus. They were a tight knit group of struggling kids, and they held onto each other tighter than family. Of course, things could only ever be so easy.</p><p>Peter’s biggest flaw was that he was gullible. They all knew he was gullible. Sometimes, Sirius’ teasing would go a little too far, but they never intentionally used this fact against Peter. His naivety was a part of his charm--to be jaded, Peter would lose all the spark that drove him to be the friend that he was. Still, while the trio never hurt Peter, that didn’t stop other people from picking at him when their backs were turned. School had hardly started for their sixth year when chattering had filled the common room, everyone surrounding the windows to try to catch a glimpse of the hubbub down at the water.</p><p>Eli Avery stood at the start of the dock, watching with a cruel smirk as Peter stood frozen at the end and peered over the edge. He and his shitty friend, Tristram Mulciber, made a split second decision to take Peter’s book and toss it into the black lake--a choice they wouldn’t have made the year before, but now there was a strained relationship between the boys. Those who would once ignore the likes of a Potter or a Black now didn’t care of their relations--or even Peter’s relations. As Remus caught up with them, he had no wonder that this was just the start of a series of petty revenge.</p><p>“Peter!” James shouted again, before their peer suddenly teetered near the edge of the dock. Before he could go plummeting into the black water below, James lunged forward and grabbed him by the arm. From the crowd, there were some gasps and some grumbles. This wasn’t quite the show they had expected, it seemed.</p><p>“J- James, they took my--” he stopped as he gazed up at James, his fear wiping away from his expression quicker than it came. “Wh- Where did you f- find that?” What relief he had was masked by the tears that lingered. He took his book from James with both hands and hugged it close to his chest.</p><p>“We found Mulciber with it,” James told him, catching his breath quickly, “had to beat it out of him, but you know.” He shrugged with that goofy smile of his. One could think he was proud of how they handled Mulciber, but Remus recognized that smile as a friend happy to help. He, however, did not join them on the dock. He stopped a decent distance away from Avery, panting much worse than his friends, though he kept his glare on the Slytherin as he tried to level himself.</p><p>Avery turned away from the dock, still amused with himself even if his plan hadn’t quite worked out. He stowed his wand back into his robes casually but stopped in his tracks when he came face to face with Remus, that smirk dripping off his pointed face.</p><p>“What were you trying to do?” Remus asked. “This is beneath you two.”</p><p>“Is it?” Avery snorted, his grin playing on his lips yet again. “I don’t have to tell you shite.”</p><p>“Maybe not me, but I know Slughorn would love to hear it,” Remus threatened, “though I guess detention isn’t so scary to you two anymore, is it?”</p><p>“Please.” The Slytherin rolled his eyes. “Grow up, Lupin.” He tried to step around him then and a surge of confidence forced Remus’ legs to intercept him once more.</p><p>“You could have killed him, asshole.”</p><p>“Shame.” Avery’s eyes were void of sympathy. Remus knew this was because of James’ joke on Snape the year before--it <em>had</em> to have been. Snape was <em>still</em> whining about it, and he heard he was still trying to apologize to Lily. Remus… had a hard time finding any sort of heart for the likes of Snape. If he was so sorry, would Avery and Mulciber still be there, trying to prove something on his behalf?</p><p>“You think your daddy can keep pulling you out of your messes?” he pushed. “At some point, you won’t get a free ride. I just hope you don’t kill someone before then.”</p><p>“I have a lot more than my daddy to thank,” Avery snorted again. “Merlin, you’re original. Are you going to call me inbred next?”</p><p>Remus stopped, unsure what to say. He had expected him to be more up in arms about his relationship with his father… but some purebloods merely embraced their strange relations.</p><p>“Why don’t you and your liddle friends go play already?” Avery continued, looming over Remus. “Or, would you fancy they played with you? I heard that’s what you like, right?”</p><p>“<em>Excuse me</em>?”</p><p>“You know what I mean,” Avery stepped closer. “Will lil’ Pete get sympathy knob from you? Or would you let him put--?”</p><p>Before Avery could continue, a figure came flying off the dock and slammed into his side, tossing him to the ground. Remus stepped back quickly, his freckled cheeks burning red hot with the Slytherin’s words. There was a moment’s pause before he realized Sirius was on top of Avery, his fist pulling back and snapping forward against his face. Avery was doing his best to push Sirius’ face back, but his fingers slipped too close to his teeth, and a sickening shriek echoed throughout the grounds.</p><p>It was too late to run before professors finally showed up.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

</div><p>“How did you know Mulciber had it?” Peter finally asked. They were calming down in the darkness of their dorm, each gathered along the far window, beside James’ bed. Sirius’ head was backwards on the frame of his bed as Lupin supplied him clean washcloths, having managed to stop the hex that Avery pulled prior to their escape. Bats had been escaping through Sirius’ nose for far too long for Remus not to feel a little sick. However, it was done now. All that was left was to clean up the blood.</p><p>“Oh, Remus guessed,” James said, looking up from his newspaper,</p><p>“It wasn’t as simple as a guess, but,” Remus started, handing Sirius a cleaned washcloth, “I saw him skulking toward the dungeons when we were looking at the map. I thought it was a little odd he wasn’t down there with you and Avery…”</p><p>“I just wanted to beat his ugly mug in,” Sirius sniffed. “And he had the book on him.”</p><p>“Right. We found it on him. It was just a hunch, but I knew he was up to something.”</p><p>“I don’t know how to thank you guys,” Peter beamed, his round cheeks flushed with amazement. “This was the last thing my dad gave me before he… you know.”</p><p>“Of course, dear Wormtail,” James leaned over to pat his back, grinning that big, stupid grin. Remus couldn’t help but grin as well. “Don’t worry about it. It was the least we could do.”</p><p>“I think this is all because of the shite you guys pulled on Snape last year,” Remus admitted, gaze flicking between Sirius and James,</p><p>“So?” Sirius murmured. “I don’t regret knocking that creep around.”</p><p>“You heard the shite he called Lily,” James sat up in protest. “I don’t care!”</p><p>“No--No, I know,” Remus put his hands up in surrender. “I’m just wondering if we’re being targeted now.”</p><p>“Fuck that guy,” Sirius breathed through the rag, eyes flicking to Remus.</p><p>“I’m not afraid of some wannabe death eaters,” James added. “I’ll throw that birdy bitch in the lake next time, see how he bloody likes it.”</p><p>Beside him, Peter’s knuckles were white along the spine of the book as he held it to his chest. There was a distant look in his eyes, where he didn’t seem quite there--or like he was having difficulty listening to the conversation suddenly. Remus lost it now, no longer hearing the insults James and Sirius shared about the three Slytherins. He blinked in confusion when Peter seemed to be withdrawing completely by standing up and starting toward his bed.</p><p>“Peter,” Remus interrupted. “Hey, Peter. What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Oh,” he stopped. “N- Nothing, I just--”</p><p>All eyes were on him now--James’ still crooked from being socked by Mulciber earlier.</p><p>“Well. Uh. I don’t know. I don’t think you guys will believe me,” Peter finally caved and turned to them.</p><p>“Of course we will,” Remus promised, “why wouldn’t we?”</p><p>“C’mon, you can tell us anything,” James said to him so casually, yet he gave up instantly. If anyone could convince Peter to talk, it would be James, and there’d be no effort to it.</p><p>There was a long pause as Peter sat down beside James again. Sirius straightened in his spot and tossed the bloody washcloth into the bucket of water before Remus. His bleeding had stopped, but his face was still a mess. Remus offered out the other, cleaned washcloth and Sirius shook his head. It took multiple quiet moments of Remus wordlessly pointing at his own face before Sirius took the hint. He took the washcloth to his face with a frown and began cleaning it like a child told to wash up before dinner.</p><p>“I saw myself… in the water,” Peter stated, eyes searching around the room,</p><p>“That’s called a reflection, mate,” Sirius joked as he passed the cloth over his own cheek.</p><p>“No, I mean--it looked like I was in the water. I could barely make it out, but it was as if I was watching myself stare back up at me. Bubbles, um, trickled up from my nose,” Peter’s fingers brushed his nostrils. “I just floated there. A- And when I was falling in, I swear I looked, well, <em>happy</em>. Like I was welcoming myself into the lake...”</p><p>The room was silent.</p><p>“And when James pulled me away, I just sunk,” he added. “And I smiled up at me.”</p><p>James shot Remus a look, hoping for any sort of explanation. But. He didn’t have one.</p><p>“I’ll go to the library tomorrow,” Remus scratched his head. “I’ll see what I can find--I feel like the concept sounds familiar, but not quite, uh, aquatic?”</p><p>“So, you believe me?” Peter sighed with relief.</p><p>“Absolutely,” Sirius quickly told him, his excitement shining through his bruised eyes. “Oh, what if something creepy is living in the Black Lake?”</p><p>“Well, <em>yeah</em>, mate. It’s the Black Lake,” James sizzled out a booming laugh, and Sirius followed suit, weak to how contagious James’ laughter was. It was easier to laugh than dwell on what Peter had just told them, anyway--not that Remus could really share in their amusement. Peter’s relief seemed to loosen him, however, and he was able to laugh along with them after a few, wide eyed seconds of confusion. Remus really, really wanted to join them. He took to a distraction just as well.</p><p>Remus took Sirius’ washcloth again and pushed it into his cheek, where he completely missed where blood and hair had stuck to his skin. “Do I need to give you a bath?” Remus tutted like a disapproving mother. “You fleabag.”</p><p>“I tried!” Sirius protested, turning back toward Remus. “Here, you just do it. You’re the one who cares so much.”</p><p>That was true… he was.</p>
