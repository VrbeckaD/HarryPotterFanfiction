  <em>N O T E S</em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>This story will be centered around the female version of Harry Potter (Hari)! This story will also be endgame Hari Potter and Draco Malfoy. As a result, Draco's storyline and general attitude will be altered to better fit the role of a heroine's love interest — cause my baby Hari deserves happiness. But as this series begins when they are at the adorable age of eleven, they will not be getting into a relationship until at least book three (I'm indecisive and I have not made it to book three yet so we shall see).</p><p>In this story, Hari will be of some African descent (Afro-Brazilian to be exact) and Hermione will be Middle Eastern (Iranian)-British. This is just how I picture these characters and it's my story so I can do what I want :)). That being said, I am <em>not</em> Iranian or African. I never want to offend anyone and I try my hardest to do my research but I am ignorant about many things. If along the way I DO offend someone (this applies to more than just race) please do not get angry with me. Explain to me what I did wrong, that way I can learn from my mistakes and work towards being a generally good person.</p><p><u><strong>WARNING</strong></u>: This story will not shy away from the Dursley's abuse of Hari. Harry Potter was <strong>deliberately neglected and emotionally, verbally, and physically abused</strong>. Anyone who tries to downplay Harry's abuse is either misinformed or an extremely shitty person. Petunia and Vernon are child abusers and they will rot in hell. </p><p>Another less serious warning for all my Snape lovers out there:<em> I do not like Snape</em> and that is my opinion, you can have yours. I would just like all the Snape fans out there to know that this story will not be very kind to him. Nothing too bad but Hari will definitely not be naming her child after him. (Everyone pray for Albus Severus. Nothing's wrong with him, he just has a shit name.)</p><p>Also I — for some unknown and utterly idiotic reason — had decided to write this story in British-English... I am not British if you could not tell but I am in too deep and I do not feel like going back and fixing everything I've written. So Brits if my British-English set Grammarly, UK version of Harry Potter, and extensive research fail me, please help a brother out and comment on what I did wrong (I know some of my metaphors/figures of speech may be extremely American but what can I do). This also applies to general typos/grammar fuck-ups and to all those English speakers out there who are much better than me at writing. Much appreciated :))</p><p>Sorry that was so long! Thank you for reading and I really hope you guys enjoy this book. I put a lot of effort into it and I would love it for you to comment your thoughts! I will add a new chapter every Monday and Thursday :)) Or at least I will try very hard to. I've been trying to work on my horrible procrastination habits. So wish me luck!!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Katya ♡</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
