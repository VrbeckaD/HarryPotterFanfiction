  <strong>Chapter One: A Look Into the Past</strong>
</p><p>Harry leant up against the glass wall, cringing as Nagini attacked Snape against his will.  He heard him cry sharply, then he stopped when the Dark Lord called his snake back to him, leaving Severus Snape to die. </p><p>Harry felt the tears beginning to form in his eyes as he stumbled to the other side of the glass.  His face sagged devastatingly when Snape looked up at him.  Harry grabbed his neck to hopefully stop the bleeding, but he knew it wouldn’t do much good. </p><p>Snape’s coal black eyes bore into Harry’s gaze.  Harry had never seen the man so utterly frightened.  Harry wept softly as Severus Snape’s head was cradled in his hands.  Up until this point, he still thought of Snape as a Death Eater—a man who had betrayed Dumbledore by killing him. </p><p>But now, as his tears fell onto Severus’ open wounds, he finally understood that this man—this<em> brave</em> man—was always protecting him, and him alone.  <em>He’s dying for me,</em> Harry thought, as Snape started to cry. </p><p>“Take them,” Snape motioned to the tears on his cheek, “Take them all!”  He cried more, as Harry got out an empty vial from his pocket.  The tears streamed into the vial.  Harry shakily took it away from his face, putting a stopper over it, shoving it quickly but carefully into his pocket.</p><p>“<em>Look</em> at me, Harry.”  Snape said, as Harry’s eyes snapped back into the fading black ones. </p><p>“You cry for me…” He wiped a tear from Harry’s cheek. Harry leant into the pale hand, cupping it with his own.  He didn’t know why, but he kissed the back of Snape’s hand.  It seemed like a silent way of saying <em>I’ll miss you</em>.  The professor squeezed Harry’s hand in response, with their fingers intertwined.</p><p>Harry scooted closer to the brave, dying man before him.  He embraced him very gently, as not to cause more bleeding.  “You…” Harry stammered, catching his breath, “It’s always been you, Snape—Severus.”  He corrected, knowing it would mean more to Severus if he used his first name.  After all, the man was dying in his arms—it <em>is</em> an intimate moment, Harry admitted to himself.</p><p>“<em>Always</em>.”  The raspy voice said in Harry’s ear.  Both their cheeks were wet with sadness and tears, dripping down to Snape’s wounds.  Harry looked down at his lashed neck, all from Voldemort’s doing.  <em>The bastard,</em> he thought, as he leaned his head down to touch his lips lightly above the bleeding scratch.  He couldn’t have said why he did it; it just seemed like the right thing to do at the time.  Harry moved up to Severus’ damp cheek, kissing it softly, then to his feverish forehead.  He even kissed his nose—which, strangely, now seemed to be more beautiful in this moment to Harry. </p><p>“Harry,” Severus breathed on the student’s neck.  Harry looked into his eyes, placing his forehead on Snape’s, gently rocking him back and forth.  All of this seemed to happen so quickly, it was almost like a race to show each other kindness within their final moment together.  Snape too, now saw Harry as a completely different boy.  <em>A man, in fact</em>, he thought as Harry was gently pressing his forehead to his own.  Of all things in his final minutes, he would never have guessed that the Golden Boy would be comforting him, let alone <em>crying</em> for him.  He felt so safe in Harry’s grasp, but so devastated to leave him alone to fight Voldemort. </p><p>Severus had no idea what came over him, but he had a sudden burst of energy.  His neck, his arms, then even his legs had stopped hurting. </p><p>“Oh, S-Sev-erus…don’t leave…” Harry begged, closing his eyes.  As much as he used to hate Snape, the so-called “Evil Potions Master” at Hogwarts, he never wanted this for him. </p><p>As Harry’s tears trickled down thickly upon Snape’s other neck wounds, both men looked down.  The wounds clasped shut, just like Fawkes had done when he cried on Harry in the Chamber of Secrets. </p><p>Severus was in disbelief, but he wanted to live so badly, he brought a finger to wipe a tear from Harry’s face then dragged it across another wound on his arm.  The wound tightly closed, and Severus felt no pain at all.</p><p>Even Nagini’s poison was clearing itself from Snape’s bloodstream.  Neither men knew why this was happening, but they went along with it.  They worked together on taking more of Harry’s tears and wiping them across each wound—which wasn’t a problem, since Harry was still weeping pretty hard from the fear and shock of it all.</p><p>Severus’s eyes were no longer dim and faded, but full of life.  He stared into Harry’s shiny emerald eyes, as if looking into them for the first time.  Although neither men knew what to say, Harry broke the silence.  “How did—I mean, I didn’t know I could do that.  How did I do that—how do you feel?”  He stammered so quickly, he thought about saying it all over again.  Snape opened his lips, then closed them, thinking for a moment. </p><p>He remembered reading something a long while ago, after Harry had been saved by Fawkes in his second year.  He wanted to do research on Phoenix tears, when he came across a book called <em>Phoenix Tears: Love’s Match and Savior</em>.  It was quite intricate and complex, the way Phoenix tears could work in the human body.  Once someone had been healed by a Phoenix, they could also heal others, but the other individual <em>also</em> had to have been healed by a Phoenix.  <em>That’s strange</em>, Severus thought.  He had never been healed by a Phoenix—certainly not Fawkes.  The damned bird always squawked at him whenever he accepted lemon drops from Albus.  He doubted the thing cared for him at all.  Once Fawkes even set his robes ablaze when he was the new Headmaster.  <em>The daft creature,</em> Snape thought bitterly.</p><p>After this quick thought, Severus opened his chapped lips, still recovering from being so very near death.  “I…I feel <em>alive</em>.  Merlin, I thought…” He trailed off, not knowing what to say to the boy—the <em>man</em> that saved his life.  Harry smiled so big, in such a relief, that he started laughing, with his arms still wrapped around Severus.  He let out a big sigh, and hugged the man before him.  “Always.”  He repeated to Snape.</p><p>Harry couldn’t see, with his head against Severus’ but Snape actually <em>smiled</em>.  He held Harry close and grinned like a fool, knowing he was alive and could still protect him.  It’s what Lily would have wanted.  How he loved her—as a best friend, and no less than that.  It was James he’d lusted after—the one who always teased him and picked on him.  A handful of times, James had even reciprocated that lust, but James didn’t like Severus’ obsession with Dark Magic, so he chose Lily. </p><p>Severus pulled Harry away from him, who was still trying to comprehend the situation.  He attempted to stand up, but his legs felt like Jell-O.  He grunted in irritation.</p><p>“No, Severus,” Harry said sternly, “you can’t move.  If you move, he’ll find you again, and try to kill you.  I won’t let that happen.”  He stated with newfound bravery.  “It’s far from over, but I’m going to fight him soon.”</p><p>“I can’t let you go unprotected, Pot—Harry.  It was what your mother would have wanted—for me to protect you.”  Snape said just as sternly as Harry.  “You can’t protect me this time.  It just has to be me and him.”  Harry said, slowly getting his wand out of his robes.  Somehow, he knew Snape wouldn’t believe him.  Before Snape could get another word out, he cast a spell putting the older man into a deep slumber.  He then bent down to him and whispered, “If I make it out of this, I’ll come back for you.” </p><p>He decided to scribble a note for Snape on a piece of parchment for when he woke up.  By then, he should be fully healed anyway, Harry thought.  He lied the note on Snape’s lap and spread his invisibility cloak over the body.  Harry then wiped away his tears, remembered the vial of Snape’s memories, and decided to go to the Pensieve.  Then, he’d find Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest to finally end this war.</p>
