          <div class="userstuff"><p>request:Cute Draco malfoy imagine about him helping you study please? </p><p>You were sitting in the library trying to understand a potions text, and by this point you were honestly thinking about giving up.</p><p>“y/n?”</p><p>You looked up to see Draco Malfoy and smiled, “Hey Draco.”</p><p>“Need help?”</p><p>You didn’t want Draco to see you fail. He was basically perfect, and his scores too.</p><p>But if you didn’t accept his help Snape would kill you.</p><p>“Sure.” You said and pulled over a chair.</p><p>After almost an hour you were starting to understand the basics of the potion and felt like maybe you could make the potion without too many problems.</p><p>“Thank you Draco, you have no idea how you just saved me.”</p><p>“So you can say that I’m your knight in shining armour?” He had a cheeky smile on his face.</p><p>You could feel the heat rising up on your cheeks.</p><p>“I- you- what?” You said and mentally scolded yourself for sounding like a complete idiot, but he only laughed and smiled a real, honest smile.</p><p>You quickly sat straighter on you chair and hoped you looked more confident than you felt and smiled back at him, and really hoped that your blush wasn’t too noticable.</p><p>You started packing your things and when you looked at Draco you could see him staring at you, and suddenly he said “Would you like to go out with me?”</p><p>The book that you were holding fell out of your hands and both of you went to pick it up and your hands touched, you raised your head and your y/e/c eyes met Draco’s shining grey ones.</p><p>Your heart was beating so fast that you were sure that it would burst right out of you chest.</p><p>He was so beautiful that you actually wondered if it was even legal to look like that.</p><p>You realized that both of you were crouched on the floor for longer than necessary so you picked the book and got up, with Draco soon following.</p><p>"Wait!" He took your hand in his, and your eyes gazed upon each other.</p><p>You were still staring into each others eyes and Draco put his right hand on your cheek and got closer.</p><p>“Is it okay if I kiss you?” He asked.</p><p>You were afraid that if you tried to say something you would end up mumbling, so you only nodded.</p><p>He got closer until you could feel his breath.</p><p>He put his other hand on your waist and leaned towards you.</p><p>You closed your eyes and his lips were instantly on yours.</p><p>He had the slight taste if mint, you couldn’t help but notice.</p><p>You put you hands on his neck and soon you hands were roaming through his perfectly soft hair.</p><p>He was smiling. You could feel it.</p><p>You smiled too.</p><p>After some time you had to break the kiss for air.</p><p>You pressed your forhead on his, and you both were breathing hard.</p><p>“Wow.” You said, and he chuckled.</p><p>“So was that a yes about going out with me?” He asked.</p><p>“Yeah, I would like that.” You answered.</p><p>You both smiled, and this time you were the one to kiss him.</p><p>You might just ask for his help to study again.</p></div>
