  </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why did I let you talk me into this?” Harry asks Ron. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though they have only known each other since the beginning of the school year, and they are already best friends. In September they had tried out for field hockey together, and though Harry had made the team and Ron hadn’t, they’d stayed friends. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And now, they were currently in the audience section of the school auditorium along with all the other dance team hopefuls. Harry absently tugs at her sports bra as she glances around. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because it’ll be fun!” Ron says. “The worst that can happen is we don’t make it this year and have to try again next year.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry rolls her eyes. “But why </span>
  <em>
    <span>dance</span>
  </em>
  <span>? I’ve never danced before! We could’ve done something like swim.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, at least one of my siblings has done all the other winter sports, and I want to do something </span>
  <em>
    <span>else</span>
  </em>
  <span>. And besides, the flyers all said that beginners are welcome, and I swear the way that you play field hockey looks like dancing. ” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you say so,” Harry says skeptically, shrugging. The motion causes her shoulders to brush against her hair, which she realizes that it must still be down. So she sighs and begins the laborious process of collecting all of her messy hair into a ponytail.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before Harry can say anything else to Ron, Harry notices that someone is striding over towards them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She’s about Ron’s height– a bit taller than Harry– and has silky blonde hair that’s braided flat against her head, her silver eyes glinting. She’s wearing workout gear that looks expensive and seems perfectly tailored to fit her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry thinks she’s seen this girl around, though Harry can’t quite put a name to the face, nor think of anything specific about her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The girl comes to a halt right in front of Harry and Ron and says, “My name is Draco. Draco Malfoy.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry’s lips quirk up at the sound of the name, and she hears Ron snort beside her. Harry decides that she must not have met Malfoy before, because she would have remembered a name that was that ridiculous. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Think my name is funny, do you?” Malfoy asks. Then she runs her eyes over Ron, and says, “I don’t need to ask what </span>
  <em>
    <span>yours</span>
  </em>
  <span> is. With hair that red and gear that cheap, you must be a Weasley.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry frowns at that and angles her body slightly away from Malfoy and towards Ron. In the few short months since they’d met, Ron has become one of her best friends, and Harry can’t help but feel irritated with this girl who seems to have walked over just to insult her friend.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron splutters incoherently and Harry glances between Ron and Malfoy, trying to decide what to do. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Malfoy rolls her eyes dramatically, then makes eye contact with Harry again. Harry feels one of her eyebrows raise slightly without even thinking about it, and she decides to wait for whatever Malfoy is going to say next. Harry can always roast her ass after whatever she says next, after all. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure you’ve noticed that some groups are </span>
  <em>
    <span>better</span>
  </em>
  <span> than others at this school. I can introduce you to my friends, and you’ll see,” Malfoy says, sticking her hand out for Harry to shake. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry lowers her brow and rolls her eyes. Harry already </span>
  <em>
    <span>has</span>
  </em>
  <span> a best friend and she certainly doesn’t need a new one that trash talks her actual best friend. Harry shoves her hands into her pockets, and says, “I think I can make my own friends. Thanks anyways.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Whatever Malfoy was going to say in response is cut off by the dance team coach calling them to order, so Malfoy scoffs and walks off with a final glare at Harry and Ron. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry hopes that she never has to see Malfoy again.</span>
</p>

  <strong>
    <em>January, 2015</em>
  </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You have to be the one to get the solo, Harry,” Ron says. “You worked so hard and your audition was </span>
  <em>
    <span>amazing</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry nods absently. In the two years since she and Ron made the dance team, dance has quickly taken over her life– despite the constant annoyance of Malfoy’s presence. Harry, Ron, Malfoy, and Malfoy’s friend, Greengrass had been the only freshmen to make the team, and this had led to a fierce competition: Harry and Ron versus Malfoy and Greengrass.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Since then, Ron and Harry have been joined by Ron’s sister, Ginny. Unfortunately, Malfoy’s side has also grown, as she and Daphne were joined by both Daphne’s sister, Astoria, and another girl named Parkinson. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Honestly, the thing that annoyed Harry the most about Astoria joining was that her presence forced Harry to refer to both sisters by first name, which didn’t really fit the enemy vibe they were going for. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The in-team competition between them had only increased in intensity with each passing month– even when dance was out of season– to the point where Harry had chosen to go to dance camp instead of playing field hockey during the fall, just to get an edge on Malfoy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ginny says, “Yeah, McGonagall would have to be blind not to see that Harry obviously deserves the solo.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry jumps when McGonagall, who has appeared out of nowhere, says, “I’d have to be blind not to see what, Ms Weasley?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Harry hadn’t even noticed that McGonagall was in the room. McGonagall’s presence causes Harry’s nerves to act up again. She nervously twirls her hair around her fingers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nothing, nothing,” Ginny says hurriedly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>McGonagall scrutinizes Ginny for a long moment, then sweeps her gaze over the rest of the team.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry bounces forward nervously onto the balls of her feet, then settles back down onto her heels. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron reaches over and squeezes Harry’s forearm reassuringly. Harry glances over at her best friend gratefully. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve made a decision for the solo,” McGonagall says, pausing dramatically. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry’s heartbeat picks up and she starts bouncing again. The solo was up between Harry and Malfoy, and Harry thinks that she would have to die if she lost the solo to Malfoy. Especially since this is the first time they’ve ever truly competed against each other; being on the same team doesn’t give them much opportunity for true competition. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well?” Ron interjects impatiently. Harry thinks that as much as she wants to be the one to get the solo, Ron might actually want her to get it more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was getting there, Ms Weasley,” McGonagall says primly. “I’ve decided that the solo will go to Ms Potter. I’m sorry Ms Malfoy, but your technique just didn’t bring the </span>
  <em>
    <span>right</span>
  </em>
  <span> emotion to the performance. I’m sure there will be a solo better suited to your talents soon.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry whoops excitedly, then gasps as Ron hugs her, driving all the air out of her lungs. Ginny slaps her on the back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can’t– breathe–,” Harry says breathlessly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron releases the hug and says, “Right, sorry. But you did it!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry grins broadly and says, “I did!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She finally remembers that she had had competition for the part and glances around curiously to see what Malfoy is doing. It takes her mere seconds to determine that Malfoy is no longer in the auditorium. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did anyone see where Malfoy went?” Harry asks the group at large. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why, did you want to gloat?” Daphne asks scathingly. Parkinson has her hand around Daphne’s arm in a vice grip, which Harry eyes oddly before deciding it’s none of her business.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry frowns and shakes her head, then says, “No, that’s more Malfoy’s style. I was just wondering where she’d gone.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Whatever,” Daphne says, rolling her eyes. “If you must know, she went to the bathroom.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry frowns and glances over at the door to the bathroom just in time to see it slam shut. Harry knows immediately that Malfoy must be upset. Harry wonders for a moment why none of Malfoy’s friends have gone after her, then sees that Daphne is caught in an argument with Parkinson, Daphne’s arm still held in Parkinson’s hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to the bathroom,” Harry says to Ron and Ginny. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron narrow her eyes and says, “Are you sure she’s worth it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry shrugs. “I don’t know. And if nothing else, I do have to go, so: two birds, one stone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good luck, I guess,” Ginny says. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry throws another look at Parkinson and Daphne, then says quietly, “If you can, you should figure out what they’re arguing about, it seems intense.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron glances over as well and says, “That? Parkinson’s into Malfoy, that’s probably all it is.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry nods and says, “Nevermind, then.” A distant part of her mind notes that Malfoy is way out of Parkinson’s league, even accounting for how annoying they both are. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shaking off this irrelevant train of thought, Harry finally walks off towards the bathroom. The walk across the gym seems to take longer than normal as she tries to think of what she’ll find when she gets there– and what she’ll do with what she does find. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When Harry makes it to the bathroom she opens the door, and the first thing she hears is the sound of the sink running. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry steps around the corner and sees Malfoy standing at the sink, her hands held under the stream of water. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well? Did you come here to gloat?” Malfoy asks snidely. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry shakes her head and steps further into the bathroom. “I–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Whatever,” Malfoy says, interrupting her. “We all know that McGonagall is friends with your parents and that’s why you got the part.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before Harry manages to get over her shock, Malfoy has turned off the water and brushed past her towards the bathroom door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry whirls around to stare at Malfoy’s back as she pulls the door open. Harry wants to protest, to say that she worked hard for her audition, that she’s earned it, but before she can, Malfoy has gone, the door slamming shut behind her once again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As if in a dream, Harry walks over to the toilet stall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>By the time she walks out of the bathroom, Harry has managed to shake off her stupor, replacing it with a determination to dance her heart off and prove, once and for all, that she’s earned her solo.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>February, 2015</em>
  </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It is the day of the dance competition, which is the day where Harry will perform her very first solo. She’s been practicing as much as she can– to the point where her dad had said that he’d heard her humming the song in her sleep. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry is now running through her routine backstage for Ron and Ginny. The way her body mindlessly flows from one move to the other makes it clear that all the practice was worth it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As she finishes, her friends burst into applause. She grins broadly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How was that?” Harry asks, after she catches her breath. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Absolutely amazing,” Ron says. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ginny nods in agreement and says, “Yeah, you definitely deserve that solo.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry smiles again, shakes her head, and says, “Thank you, but I mean, is there anything I need to fix?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve got something,” Malfoy says, “I don’t think you’re bringing the right– </span>
  <em>
    <span>emotion </span>
  </em>
  <span>to the performance.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry throws a look at where Malfoy has seemingly appeared from nowhere, then turns her back firmly. “I feel like there has to be something,” Harry says loudly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron glances over at Malfoy, then fixes her eyes firmly on Harry and says, “I think you’re losing the beat a little bit at the middle part, but you pick it up again so quickly that it </span>
  <em>
    <span>should</span>
  </em>
  <span> be okay.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry nods. She has been trying really hard to fix that, but it’s hard when all her extra practice at home is with her parents. As hard as they try, they’re not dancers, and therefore they can’t really tell her when she’s messing up, especially when it’s something as fleeting as the timing during one part of the song. “Do you–” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Malfoy interjects, “Only you, Potter, would be able to land a solo, and then not manage to keep the beat. Oh wait, maybe it’s because you didn’t deserve the solo in the first place… We’re doomed.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck off, Malfoy,” Ginny says, getting to her feet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry throws an annoyed look at Malfoy, then says to Ginny, “Just ignore her, she’s just jealous I got the solo and she didn’t.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It’s times like this that the close quarters of their warmup space really gets to Harry. Though, with how persistently Malfoy has been harassing her, she can only imagine that even if they did have more space, Malfoy would probably still find a way to hang around and be fucking irritating.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Obviously,” Ginny says, “but that doesn’t mean her bleating isn’t fucking annoying.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Five minute warning!” McGonagall calls. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck,” Harry mutters to herself. She’d been hoping to manage another run through before they went onstage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s a shame ‘break a leg’ is an expression for luck, because I really do hope you break a leg,” Malfoy says. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry can tell that Malfoy thinks this was supposed to be clever, but really Malfoy just sounds so </span>
  <em>
    <span>stupid</span>
  </em>
  <span>. “You think you’re so </span>
  <em>
    <span>clever</span>
  </em>
  <span>, but we all know better,” Harry says with a glare. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry knows its petty of her to care at all what Malfoy says, but all the snipes that Malfoy has been aiming at her over the past several weeks have been increasingly aggravating, and Harry is nearing her breaking point. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Malfoy smirks and says, “I suppose lesser minds must have trouble understanding the things that greater minds already know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Forget nearing her breaking point, Harry has just reached it. She snarls and launches herself at Malfoy. She’s had </span>
  <em>
    <span>enough</span>
  </em>
  <span> and she </span>
  <em>
    <span>will </span>
  </em>
  <span>teach Malfoy not to fuck with her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before Harry can manage anything more than an angry sound and a lunge in Malfoy’s direction, Ginny and Ron each grab one of Harry’s hands and tow her away. They end up where everyone is grouping up to make their way to the stage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“C’mon Harry, you gotta get your head in the dance, we probably only have a minute or two left before we’re on– before it’s time for your solo,” Ron says. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry mutters incoherently for a moment, running her hand through her hair, then says, “Fine, fine you’re right. I need to focus, but god, I just wanna teach her a lesson.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And we’ll help you,” Ginny says. “Just, you gotta wait till after the dance.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry nods. She sucks in a deep breath, then lets it out slowly. It’s time for her to focus on one thing, and one thing only: her solo. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>By the time Harry has settled and refocused herself, McGonagall is back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is everyone ready?” McGonagall asks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry nervously nods her head along with the rest of the troupe. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The walk to the stage entrance takes no time at all, and before Harry knows it they’re all lined up, ready to step on stage. Harry is at the back of the line because her solo calls for a late entrance. She nervously resumes bouncing onto the balls of her feet before settling back down onto her heels. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The rest of the troupe heads on stage without Harry. She and McGonagall are the only two people left.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>McGonagall turns to her and says, “You’ve got this, Potter. I chose you for a reason, and you’re going to do us all proud.” Then she turns and hurries off to sit in the audience with the rest of the troupe leaders. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>McGonagall’s vote of confidence only serves to strain Harry’s nerves further despite the intention. She stares blankly at McGonagall’s retreating back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then the song begins, and Harry has to hurry to her start position. From here she is able to watch her troupe-mates performing, and she almost starts to lose herself in the rhythm of watching her friends. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But then her nervousness about her impending solo returns, pulling her out of her enjoyment. She rolls her shoulders, takes a deep breath, and shakes out her arms. Then she makes the mistake of looking out into the audience, spotting the judges. Her stomach swoops nervously before she’s able to yank her eyes away, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then she hears the musical cue that means there are mere seconds left until it’s time for her to go on stage. Harry gets into her starting position and takes one last deep breath. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The music comes to a sudden halt, cueing Harry to release her breath and run to her starting point on stage. She slides between Colin and Daphne, as she’s supposed to. The troupe is arrayed in a semicircle, and Harry comes to a halt with her back to the audience– and the judges– so that she’s facing the midpoint of the semicircle– as though she’s a conductor of an orchestra. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Unfortunately, it’s Malfoy who holds the point of the semicircle. Malfoy has just enough time to mouth something that Harry is sure is insulting before the music crescendos again and Harry is launching into motion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As Harry shoves down her annoyance with Malfoy, she snaps her arms out, twirling around to face the audience, her head coming up to boldly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry stalks to the front of the stage and drops into a crouch. She only stays down for the briefest of moments before she leaps to her feet again, spinning off to the side. She rushes at the semicircle of trope members, and the people closest to her lean onto their toes, reaching their arms up above their heads. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry cowers back in response and backpedals away from the circle. She loops around and then approaches from the back of the circle. As she nears her troupe members she makes eye contact with Malfoy, who takes the opportunity to wink– mockingly– at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry ignores it as best she can as she responds as she ought to to the semicircle rebuffing her: by recoiling once again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then she circles around and repeats the approach and rebuff for a final time, ending at the opposite side of the circle from where she had begun. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry moves to the front of the stage and flows into the most important part of her solo. It’s a flurry of motion meant to represent the uncertainty and rejection of the part she had just finished. And despite the emotions she’s portraying, her chest swells with pride as she lands each move perfectly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The finale of this part is a forward somersault that ends with Harry on her knees before the crowd, her arms raised to the sky. The music mellows out for a moment to allow her to catch her breath, and in the interlude, the crowd bursts into applause. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry has to do her best to keep her mind on the performance, because the dance isn’t quite over yet, but it’s hard to when there is something about the applause that hits differently, deeper, now when Harry knows it is for </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But she can’t dwell on it yet, because the music is swelling once again. Harry gets to her feet and lowers her arms slowly as she turns to face the semicircle again. She takes a few hesitant steps towards the circle, then comes to a halt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She is still holding the pride of successfully completing the most difficult part of her solo close to her chest as she moves into the finale of the performance.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry whirls back around to face the audience, then walks backwards towards the circle. She is grateful that Ron and Ginny are part of the troupe because this next part would be near impossible without people she trusts here. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When Harry feels the presence of bodies behind her and knows that the rest of the troupe has closed their ranks like they are supposed to, Harry comes to a halt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She spreads her arms and falls backwards. Harry sighs in relief when she feels the press of hands against her back, catching her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>From there it’s smooth sailing to the end of the number, and the next thing Harry knows, she’s taking her final bows with the rest of the group and running offstage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As soon as they are clear of the stage, Ron and Ginny stop and clap Harry on the back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That was amazing!” Ginny says. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron nods and says, “You nailed it!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They resume walking, then. They’re heading towards a hallway near the auditorium where they can meet with their parents while they wait for the rest of the troupes to perform, and for the final scores all around. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thanks guys,” Harry says. “I can’t believe–” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>I</span>
  </em>
  <span> can’t believe that you fucked it up so badly,” Malfoy says, interrupting Harry. “I mean c’mon, you had how long to practice that? And you </span>
  <em>
    <span>still</span>
  </em>
  <span> nearly lost the timing.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry looks around and is disappointed to see that they’ve arrived at the hallway and that there’s a crowd of parents gathering. In other words, there’s witnesses. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lay off, Malfoy,” Ron says. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m just saying,” Malfoy continues, “if we lose this thing, it’s on Potter.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think that to find the person responsible for our potential loss, Malfoy, you ought to look in the mirror.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With that, she grabs Ron’s and Ginny’s hands and turns and walks off into the small crowd of waiting parents, cutting off any chance Malfoy might have had to respond. A part of Harry is trying to tell her that this is a cowardly move, but Harry thinks that it’s better to end the confrontation now, before it escalates to violence– again. </span>
