From the restroom’s window, he could see Diagon Alley woke up in a rare and quite September light, people running around, chatting lightly and laughing with a renovated hopeful spirit. The war was over, again, and it looked like forever.</p><p>George wasn’t so sure about it, he knew way to well that conflicts usually return with devastation and death, no matter how hard everyone try. It was just human nature.</p><p>But, right now, there were fine. They will be for a bit.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, he got out of the tub, the cold crawling under his skin and into his bones. Avoiding the mirror on the wall, like he had being doing for three whole months, he dried himself with a clean towel, brushed his teeth, shaved, put deodorant on and out of there. He went directly in his (theirs) bedroom, changing in an everyday outfit, jeans and a dark blue sweater, before heading toward the little kitchen for a brew.</p><p>The voices outside were increasing in volume and George could not stand them anymore. He closed all the windows and silence returned.</p><p><em>Better</em>.</p><p>He drank his tea slowly, sitting on a used wood chair. There were two of them, on each side of the small table. One was less ruined, less warm, still in the same position as months ago like time had never passed.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <em>“We should really change them, all of them. We should change everything!”</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>“Why is that, Freddie?”</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>“Because now we can, Georgie. We could have all marble interiors.”</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>“I don’t know; marble is cold.”</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>“I’ll keep you warm.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>He stood up immediately as that specific memory showed up in his mind like a bulb, heart aching and strangled with so many strings he couldn’t breathe. He shook his head, watching desperately his hands behind a wall of tears. He didn’t notice he had started crying. That house was his personal inferno, like muggles used to say. But at the same time it was the only place he could call home, not even their parent’s house felt right to him.</p><p>George knew he should probably move somewhere else, just for peace of mind and spirit. But not yet, maybe not ever.</p><p>A knock rescued him from his thoughts and the moment was gone. He fixed his face with his hands, trying to be presentable, and with a deep breath, he opened the main door. Angelina was there, in front of him, with a sweet smile on her beautiful face.</p><p>
  <em>How could she?</em>
</p><p>“Hey, ‘morning.”</p><p>“Morning, George, hope you didn’t had breakfast ‘cause I bought some really good muggle pastries and, let me tell you, we should all gave them more credit for these!” said enthusiastically, entering the flat with a laugh and heading towards the small table in the living room, without mentioning his red eyes. She already knew, it was not necessary to talk about it.</p><p>“Thanks, but I’m not that hungry, Angie, and also… I was going to open the shop, I’m already late.”</p><p>She didn’t see that one coming, because she turned around so fast that the bag she had in her hands almost fell to the floor. She left all her stuff on the couch before speaking.</p><p>“Come again?”</p><p>“Yes, well, Ron… I mean, he couldn’t this morning, and he asked if I- ”</p><p>And Angelina wrapped him in a tight hug. She had some muscles.</p><p>“I’m glad.” She didn’t add anything else but he knew what she was saying. All the words not said out loud were a huge subtext but they were there, pulsing and meaningful.</p><p>She released him, watching him in the eyes like he was a frightened deer ready to run away. But George did not had the strength to act, to stop her, to pause the moment and reflect, to think. And what happened a second later was very clear and predictable. He knew that it would ended like this, all along.</p><p>The kiss was smooth, fragile, kind. George remained still with his eyes closed, hoping it ended soon enough.</p><p>It didn’t last long, at all, but it seemed an eternity.</p><p>“You ok?”</p><p>Angie was looking at him in a very different way, right now, attentive and scared to hurt him with her words. George was scared too.</p><p>“Yes, you?”</p><p>“You know I am. We should just… you know, take it slow.”</p><p>That single phrase was a really good summary of their relationship in the last months.</p><p>They were always close, since first year at Hogwarts, good friends. But then, Fred had been starting dating her, inviting her at the Yule ball, and George couldn’t stand the thought of it. It was their very first fight, and it went so bad that Lee had tried talking them through it with the help of Ron and Percy and Ginny. They couldn’t do anything else other than discuss the matter with Fred, who had no idea why his twin brother was acting that way.</p><p>George had treasured those moments so dearly and intimately in his mind, in order to recalled them during the worst nights, when all he could feel was pain.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <em>“Are we really fighting for a girl?”</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>“No.”</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>“Please, George, for fuck’s sake, talk to me! Are you jealous of me because I’m going with her to that stupid ball?”</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>“I said no! Just leave me be, ok?”</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>“You know I can’t.”</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>They started understanding the nature of their feelings that evening, almost five years ago. Another life, without war, pain, distress, death.</p><p>“George?” Angie brought him back to reality.</p><p>“I agree. Slow, yes.”</p><p>“You sure about this? I’m not here because I need any of it, I just care about you in every way you’ll allow me.” Her eyes were so trustworthy and safe, not passionate or burning but, at least, they were there. Alive.</p><p>“Yes, I’m sure.”</p><p> </p>
