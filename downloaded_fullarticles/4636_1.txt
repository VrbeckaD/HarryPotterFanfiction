          <div class="userstuff"><p>His life begins with a flash of light, a ringing emptiness rippling through his skull.<br/> <br/> There are piercing blue eyes very close to his own, gazing so intently at him, it's as if they can read his soul. Then those eyes fill with tears and the face pulls back, resolving itself into a wrinkled old man with a crooked nose and an incredible wealth of white hair. "It's gone," says that deep, ancient voice--seeming to come from the center of the earth itself. "All of it."<br/> <br/> And then the old man smiles tremulously, eyes spilling over from behind his half-moon spectacles. A weeping woman, stout and wreathed in bright red hair, places a steaming plate of chocolate biscuits on the table before turning away to mop up her face with her apron.<br/> <br/> “Thank you, Molly. These look delicious,” the old man says, not bothering to wipe his tears away. “Would you care for one, my boy?”<br/> <br/> He takes one and nibbles on it. It tastes even better than it looks. But as soon as it’s gone, his attention starts to wander to the house around him: a scrubbed wood table, a clock with seven hands on it, the whistling of a kettle in the next room. On the table in front of him, there is an odd assortment of objects: a stick of wood, a vial of shimmering white liquid, and a gold medallion in a velvet box. It is strung on a green ribbon and it is engraved in long, looping letters: <em>Order of Merlin - First Class.</em><br/> <br/> Something about looking at it makes him feel anxious, upset. So he looks at the rest of the room instead, noting a bit of holly tacked up around the window. Snow falling softly, silently outside.<br/> <br/> He has the sudden feeling that he’s asked these people for something terrible and tremendous, and that they’ve given it to him.<br/> <br/> “You look very at peace, if you don't mind my saying so,” the old man says—mournful, relieved, seeming to peer into his soul again.<br/> <br/> And into the hush he answers, “I think... I think I am.”<br/> <br/> The woman gives a gasping a sob into her apron, her shoulders heaving as the old man says, "Happy Christmas, Harry."</p><p> </p></div>
