    <p>The Dancing Dragon - Prologue</p><p>---</p><p>Harry James Potter was a small and rather beautiful little boy abused by his relatives and had been treated like a slave since he was four years old, he knew how to cook and clean better than a full time house wife by the age of six and he hated himself for it, he didn't want to be a pushover but his relatives petrified him making him obey their every command.<br/>
The first time Harry decided to change himself was when he was seven, he had been dusting the picture frames and shelves when there was a knock at the door, before he could move to open it he was grabbed by his aunt who snatched the feather duster from him and threw him into his cupboard.<br/>
Harry clutched his arm to his chest having jolted the already injured appendage in his fall, he turned to the cupboard entrance and watched his aunt petunia straighten her clothing and walk towards the door through a small split in the frame work. She often did this in fact she always did this, taking credit for his work, wanting to appear to be the perfect wife to their small little whinging community.<br/>
He heard the front door open and the sound of high voices ensued gossiping and chatting away like there was no tomorrow. It was Piers's Mother and she was dropping him off to play with Dudley for the evening.<br/>
Harry turned to lay down on the thin cot and closed his eyes, he had no idea how long he would be inside his cupboard it varied from a few minutes to the next day, when ever they remembered that he existed.<br/>
---<br/>
The next time he opened his pretty emerald eyes it was pitch black and very obviously night time, his stomach growled painfully and made the tiny child whimper, they had forgotten him again and while he was use to it his chest still tightened with sadness every time.<br/>
Usually they would remember him be tea time but it was a Friday and Dudley had a friend over which meant it was a takeaway night this also meant he would be left without food the evening.<br/>
Harry sighed and held back the tears as another painful cramp tightened in his stomach, he brought his legs up to his chin and placed his hand on the door handle to ride out he pain. When the cramping was over he relaxed and resumed a careful breathing so he wouldn't induce another when he noticed something, the handle moved, which meant the cupboard wasn't locked.<br/>
Excitement set in when the door clicked open and he stepped out cautiously into the corridor, the adrenaline in his system allowed him to hear better, the only sound that could be heard were the snores of his much larger whale like relatives and this assured him he was safe to move.<br/>
Harry crept along the hall way to the kitchen he moved slowly to avoid the squeaky floor boards. When he reached the kitchen he found himself almost overwhelmed by the choice of food, after all he usually only had bread or his relatives leftovers. Harry's first stop was the fruit bowl in the conjoined dining room where he snatched one banana, Apple and orange which he quickly stuffed into his overly large shirt then he made his way to the pantry where he grabbed one tin of vegetable soup and a bottle of water, he knew that these items would not be missed as his relatives avoided anything healthy like it was the plague but his aunt brought them in case she fancied eating something different and for Dudley's friends.<br/>
He was quickly making his way back towards the door when he froze in fright, someone was making their own way down the stairs and were more than likely on their way towards the kitchen, Harry watched as his uncle came into sight at the bottom of the stairs, panicking slightly he ran to the double doors that separated the kitchen/dining room from the living room and fled through them.<br/>
Harry would wait until his uncle was in the kitchen before running to his cupboard through the living room door, the tiny child watched in absolute silence as the behemoth of a man stumbled sleepily down the corridor mumbling and cursing every few seconds before he entered the kitchen, Harry listened carefully to the sound of Vernon rummaging through the cupboards before he ran for the safety of his 'bedroom', he closed the door and hid the food under his meagre blankets before realising that the door was still unlocked and his uncle was in the habit of checking on him during the night to make sure he wasn't trying any of his 'freakishness'. Knowing that there was no way to lock the door himself he scrunched his eyes together as he lay on the cot, tense and terrified of being discovered he wished with all his might that the door would remain shut.<br/>
Hearing his uncle come down the corridor he held his breath and listened to the handle turning, but the door didn't open<br/>
"Locked? Could'a sworn..." Came the confused sleep addled voice before the thumps of feet sounded above him.<br/>
Harry was more than relieved he was elated he had gotten away with stealing food from his relatives and the door had magically locked itself... 'Magic? Huh, that's cool' that's what he would call his freakishness he would be like that wizard man Merlin the one they had been told about in a book at story time in school.</p><p>---</p><p>The years of young Harry Potters life passed quickly, he would practice is special magic every day and experiment with its limits, he could move things and shrink them and even make them into something else. Harry knew he was special he just didn't know how special he truly was.<br/>
His Hogwarts letter came when he was eleven and on the same day as its arrival he left for Diagon Ally in secret, the details on how to get there were in the back of the letter, and because his relatives didn't know he had gone he was able to read and reread the books it was safe to say the then Gryffindor made quite the first impression with the highest grades in the school even higher than one of his first friends Hermione and his school 'enemy' Draco Malfoy.</p><p>Harry's school life was never simple or easy, the philosopher stone in first year the basilisk in second, a supposed serial killer, Dementors and werewolf in third and the Triwizard tournament in fourth. However what topped even that was the revelation of his second gender when he was fifteen.<br/>
All wizards and witches had a second gender they were either Alpha, Beta or Omega. The most uncommon was a male omega, only 1 in about 6000 were Omega males so Harry was the first one in about 50 years, this was most likely because it required a tremendous magical core to create and sustain the Omegas body.<br/>
Omega males were androgynous, shorter than most males, appeared delicate and were structured almost like women. They had curves and would develop breasts when pregnant they had a penis and instead of a vagina there was a small opening in the rectum that lead to the womb, their shortened tail bones meant they were able to birth naturally without c-section.<br/>
Male Omegas were highly sort after as it was rumoured that any child they birthed would be extremely magically powerful and highly valued by wizarding society, this gave Harry many problems as people, mainly men noticed his appearance and put two and two together.<br/>
It was only when he was seventeen years old, a few months before he would defeat Voldemort that people had their suspicions confirmed. Harry went into his first heat and was confined to the hospital wing, heats were the only time any Omega could get pregnant and happened about twice a year, the pheromones excreted during that time would attract alphas like bees to honey often making them go into a frenzy, so when he was locked in the hospital wing for a week and was not permitted to see anyone that was when the marriage proposals came to him in the bucket loads either by owl from Gringotts or in person by several desperate men.<br/>
---<br/>
After Voldemort's defeat Harry was depressed and it was clear to his friends but they had no idea what was going on inside his head in their minds he was free and should be happy no more people would die because of Voldemort. However he had lost so many people he cared about in the final days of he war that he had never felt so truly alone and hopeless, seeing his remaining friends happy and moving on made him realise he had nothing left for him other than piggy backing off of Ron and Hermione's relationship to feel loved. </p><p>It was a cold December night when the wards in the department of mysteries alerted the Auror's to an intruder but by then it was too late, Harry James Potter had stepped through the veil of death and disappeared from that world.</p>
