  <em>Hello Hermione!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So so sorry that I haven’t been writing to you/responding to your letter as much as I should have! Just wait I can explain—as a matter of fact, I only got most of the letters today. Even with technology it’s not that easy to communicate with Earth from Asgard…so if this envelope appears out of nowhere in your room all of a sudden, don’t panic, it’s my Papa’s magic working.</em>
</p><p>Hermione chuckled slightly as she read that line, unconsciously pinching the corner of the envelope. <em>Right, you scared me already</em>, she thought. It’s lucky that she didn’t scream out loud when the package appeared...if she had attracted attention from outside the household, it would make infinite more trouble.</p><p>Her eyes scanned through the last line in that paragraph and raised an eyebrow curiously. It reads: <em>P.S. both you and Draco should stop sending me snacks. I mean, since they’re not getting to me, my Dad is eating all of them and he’s definitely taking in too much sugar.</em></p><p>(Maybe I’ll attach a healthy-diet-suggestion next time, Hermione thought, making a mental note to herself.)</p><p>
  <em>To very briefly sum up the situations and answer your questions, I’m well, Tom’s well, my parents are well, Dreki’s well, and we don’t have a cat. Why are you asking about cats anyway? We don’t keep cats around here, you know. These guys are too soft and squishy.</em>
</p><p>(<em>Did I ask him about cats?</em> Even though she sent him multiple letters she was pretty sure she did not ask about cats...wait, did she?)</p><p><em>Tom and I went on a secret-mission-ish-trip at the start of the summer break with Aunt Natasha. Can’t tell you where we went or what exactly we were doing because of some secrecy policies, but there were quite a bit of fighting and spying and most importantly, training.</em> (Hermione started hiccuping nervously.) <em>Don’t worry, I didn’t get injured or died. Tom was super good at spying because he could get intel from the most impossible place while remaining unseen. Technically I could too, but none of Aunt Natasha or Tom would like me to get in danger. I’m just happy that magic is useful too.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>
  <em>Very unfortunately the first letter you sent got lost in the crossfire somewhere. It’s marvellous how owls can actually track me down even when I’m in hiding in a place like that! Then the base’s defence system triggered and a lot of people ran out to shoot the owl. The letter burned itself and hopefully the owl escaped.</em>
</p><p>(Hermione remembered that...that poor owl came back, looking very alarmed, and squeaked all night that night, trying to tell her something...except she didn’t learn owlish languages at school. She should probably resend a copy of that letter just for the record)</p><p><em>For the same reason, you weren’t able to contact me through my phone. Then, directly after the mission ended, Tom and I got shipped to Asgard, which tellingly made it harder for communications. It was made worse because there’s a rare thing called Convergence happening—I’ll tell you more once I come back—which disrupts the usual enchantment that allows my phone to work on Asgard. So, nope, no more signal, no more phone games…</em>(“Convergence.” Hermione mumbled. She jotted the word down on a sticker, thinking that she should look it up in Hogwarts library books when she get back to school.)</p><p><em>There still is a lot of fun stuff to do on Asgard, like hunting, but because Asgard was having a war with the Dark Elves I was more or less limited. Still is.</em> (Still frowning, Hermione bit her lips.) <em>It’s not affecting me or anything since literally nothing affects the palace and since the war isn’t actually happening on Asgard, but Papa had increasing amount of paperwork to deal with and can’t help me with receiving/sending letters as much. I didn’t want to bother the Gate Keeper either, since he looks over all of the Nine Realms, and distracting him from his task sounds like a bad idea. As for myself, I’ll be honest and admit that I’m not that advance in the brach of realm-crossing teleportation magic yet. Even with Dr.Strange’s ring it’s hard—even harder to target a destination as precise as your room. Good thing is that it sounded like the situation have been getting better, and Papa actually had the time to read me a bedtime story yesterday—maybe he’ll have time to help me with the letter tomorrow.</em></p><p>
  <em>I sent you a book from Papa’s collection on elves—you were trying to study them, right? I found more interesting books in the Asgardian library, but I can’t take them out of the palace. I hope you get to visit Asgard sometime, maybe during Uncle Thor’s regime, then you can enjoy the books too. The food here are all super high quality, but, honestly, Asgard needs House elves!! I could only imagine what food would taste like if House Elves cook them on Asgard. Btw I threw in a few grapes in the package. Try them!</em>
</p><p>(At that, Hermione blinked and jumped out of her seat. She rushed to the package—darn, she totally didn’t notice there were grapes in them! Hopefully those fruits didn’t get crushed...)</p><p><em>Speaking of which, I’m having another friend on Earth visiting us right now. Not </em> <em>my</em> <em> friend really, she’s Uncle Thor’s human girlfriend. She’s a muggle too, and a scientist. The thing though, is that normally, humans from Earth aren’t allowed to visit Asgard. My Dad and I were exceptions because we were officially accepted into an Aesir family. It’s like a citizenship/passport thing—you get a green card by marrying one of the citizens, you know? Maybe that means Uncle Thor will be getting married soon—if he does then I’ll surely send you pictures of the wedding—but something in me was saying it’s wrong. Tom said it didn’t make sense either—at least Asgard didn’t have a custom of holding the wedding of a soon-to-be-King prince during a war. Something fishy seems to be going on here, but Papa’s not telling me what.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>(Hermione frowned. But being this far from where Harry was, she couldn’t do anything. Not that she could do anything about Asgard anyways...but she <em>does </em>want to.)</p><p><em>A—nyways. I’ve been ranting on about irrelevant stuff—sry I got too excited somehow :P Dreki’s getting big now—she’s the size of a rabbit right now and still loves grapes. Still refuses meat too. The only problem about her right now...is that I think she’s fallen in love with a flying key. </em>(As she read this Hermione completely choked on her own saliva.)<em> Remember that key with blue wings we took at the end of last school year? Yea, Dreki’s hoarding it in her nest and displaying what was recorded as standard Pygmy courtship behaviours towards it...it’s getting a bit worrying. I mean, what if she actually falls in love with a dead object??? I tried to take it away but she wouldn’t let me.</em></p><p>(Hermione really had to stop reading and get a sip of water in order to calm down as she finished this paragraph. What in Merlin’s name???! When she thought she wouldn’t choke and spit water on the letter paper, she sat down and continued reading.)</p><p>
  <em>I’ll be honest and say it’s a bad idea, but I got to practice magic here—Hogwarts-magic too! I didn’t suppose the Ministry could track if an underage student was using magic in another realm, plus I have my grandmother watching over me. It’s sort of a wonder, but apparently, not a lot of Aesir are magic users. Weird, since they all have the perfect inner-body construction to store and use seidr, and lots of technology here’s magic based too.</em>
</p><p>(Most probably a cultural thing, Hermione took note. They were a warrior race after all...but didn’t Harry also say both his Papa, who was a prince, and his grandmother, who was the queen, are magic wielders?)</p><p>
  <em>How’s your summer going? I mean, classes that teach you how to make food sound great...but then I won’t really trust British cooks. Are you still studying muggle science though? If you’re still interested in Dad’s gifted youth program you’ll reach the minimum required age by next summer. It would totally be WORTH it haha, and Stark Industry covers all the fees. Even if you’re not continuing science, don’t worry, Dad would definitely take students gifted in magic for his other projects too :P I really hope we get to work together sometimes.</em>
</p><p>(Hermione sighed. Right, now that Harry had reminded her about that...she’s not planning on giving up her sciences, <em>then</em> adding all the magical subjects and her own research projects. Time. She seriously needed more time.)</p><p>
  <em>I’ll be coming back to Earth real soon, then we can go to the Diagonal Alley together. I wanted to ask Draco and Ron but I thought they would prefer going with their family.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>P.S. I know you like keeping records of letters...but things get really complicated when we’re using Aesir magic and stuff. I’ll keep it simple by stating that this letter will burn itself after you finish reading. Just be prepared!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yours</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry Stark-Lokason</em>
</p><p>Wait. Hermione blinked as her brain tried to catch up with what she just read. What? This letter is going to...</p><p>Burn?</p><p>And right before her eyes, the thin, elegant piece of paper burst into green flames. Hermione yelled and threw the ball of fire away, then watched it continue burning with wide eyes. “Dear Merlin.” She only mumbled after a while, as the fire also disappeared, not leaving a single mark on her table. She stared at her table some more, before picking up a pen and starting to write a reply.</p><p><em>At least the grape tastes great</em>, she thought.</p>
