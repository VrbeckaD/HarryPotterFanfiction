    <p>James and Lily Potter had two beautiful newborn children, both born on the 31st of July. Harry, being the oldest by 30 minutes, has his mother's eyes and father's looks. </p>
<p>And for Adaisha? They weren't quite sure who she looked like more. Either because, the little hair that she had, was a much darker color than Lily's or the fact that she is still a baby. Although one thing is for certain, she had her father's playful eyes. Some would say mischievous but James would just laugh it off and say 'Bright.'</p>
<p>And they happily lived in Godrics Hollow where they had little visits. Only because a dark lord was hunting them down and none was to be trusted.</p>
<p>And they were happy, to say the least.</p>
<p>Until their children started showing their powers. Now that was a huge struggle for Adaisha, their 11-month-old daughter.</p>
