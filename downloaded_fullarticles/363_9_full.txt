      <p>Allow me to begin by thanking you for selecting this story. I originally started this project with the intention of simply covering the prologue of the game leading up to the sorting ceremony. But it has since grown into a full adoption of Hogwarts Mystery year 1.</p><p>Be aware that, while I will try to stick to the lore of the books and the story of the game as much as I can. I am willing to make changes if I think it serves to improve the narrative. I will, of course, strive to make such changes fit within the spirit and tone of what came before as much as possible. It is, however, not my intention to do a scene-by-scene adaption of the game. I am willing to make changes in order to tell a version of the game's story I wish could be told.</p><p>Please note that English is not my primary language. And that this is my first attempt at a story where each chapter is released as they are written. I try to work as fast as I can, but my job often leaves me with no energy left to write when I get home. </p><p>With all that out of the way. Enjoy the story!</p>

  <b>PROLOGUE: Last Day of August</b>
</p><hr/>
<p>The sun was setting on the last day of August, as two brothers stood on a verdant field. </p>
<p>The day had been as bright and warm as any could hope for, a last breath of life before the arrival of autumn. They traveled out here every year on this day. To celebrate the older brother’s birthday and commemorate the last day before school began again. Enjoying a picnic with all their favorite meals served. But evening was coming to an end and the two boys watched as the pale-gold orb clung to the horizon. </p>
<p>“Do you really have to go, Jacob?” The youngest of the brothers, a boy of ten, spun around to the other with pleading eyes. The older sibling slowly turned to face him, shaking his head.</p>
<p>“Lucas, you ask this every year. You know I have to,” Jacob stopped to observe his younger brother looking only more miserable hearing the answer. The older sibling gave a smile in response. Stopping only when Lucas did not return it. He leaned slightly down. Resting his hands on his brother’s shoulders “It’s just one more year. Then you’ll be on your way to Hogwarts with me.” </p>
<p>Lucas averted Jacob’s gaze. Staring into the ground as a small foot kicked into the dirt “And then there will only be a year before you’re gone again.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. After one year at Hogwarts you’ll have friends all of your own.”</p>
<p>Lucas looked up to his brother again “You think so?” </p>
<p>“I’m certain of it,” Jacob gave a nod. His voice confident. The lines of Lucas’ face brightened.</p>
<p>“I hope so,” Lucas’ tone was wistful for a short moment. The young boy’s smile faded away as his eyes turned downcast for a second time “I hate my current school.” he murmured.   </p>
<p>“I know,” Jacob’s words and expression were nothing but somber now. Silence stood between them for a moment. Only a distant cry from their mother, Kelly Blackburn, signaling them to come back to the rest of the family drew the older brother’s attention.</p>
<p>“Dessert is ready. Let’s go back and have some,” Jacob’s words were edged with feigned enthusiasm. Seeing his brother’s mood lighten up, however, made his own genuine. Both brothers now turned and walked towards a small table where their parents and grandparents awaited. They had only gone a few steps before Jacob motioned Lucas to stop “Wait - There is something I need to say while we’re still alone.” Both brothers turned to face each other once more. Lucas stood completely still. Attentive of his brother’s words. His eyes the only thing to betray any movement. Jacob continued. </p>
<p>“I wanted to say this at Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, but I doubt there’ll be time for it there.” The teenager’s gaze drifted away for a brief moment as his brows furrowed before returning to Lucas who remained mute. The brother proceeded “I’ve been working on something very big at Hogwarts for the last two years - Something important. And if I succeed; it’ll help everybody beyond imagining.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand, Jacob,” Lucas rubbed the back of his neck and his mouth tensed and contracted.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure if I can say more,” Jacob paused. Closing his eyes as he took a deep breath “You not knowing may perhaps be for the better. Some people would certainly try to stop me if they knew what I was doing.”</p>
<p>The younger child’s eyes widened “Jacob, are you in trouble?” The older brother shook his head.</p>
<p>“No..” Jacob let out a weak laugh “...at least not yet anyway.”  Once more he rested his hands on Lucas’ shoulders as he leaned down to look his little brother directly in the eyes.</p>
<p>“Lucas, listen… “ He let out a small sigh before resuming “What I am trying to say is that in the future you might hear others speak poorly of me, but know that what I do, I am doing for a good reason. And no matter what bad things these people might say about me. Understand this - It’s only lies.”  The end of the small speech left Lucas slowly nodding as he absorbed every word of what his brother told him. </p>
<p>“Jacob! Lucas! Dessert is waiting for you - Come on!” Mrs. Blackburn yelled at them once more. Both brothers turned towards their mother and the rest of their family awaiting them. Jacob quickly turned back to face his sibling.</p>
<p>“And Lucas, don’t tell Mum and Dad any of this no matter what, okay? It’s hush-hush,” </p>
<p>Lucas frantically nodded at his brother’s command. Provoking a smile from the teenager. Clapping him on the shoulder; Jacob rose back up again “Great. Now let’s get back. I’m starving for some chocolate pudding!” </p>
<p>And with that, both brothers turned and walked towards a small table where their parents and grandparents were. Allowing themselves to enjoy the day as they were wonted to. Finishing up the last course of the picnic. The entire family would afterwards return to the grandparents’ house. Spending the remainder of the evening there and to stay overnight.</p>
<p>First of September would always start with a hearty breakfast as the Blackburn family enjoyed one last meal together before they journeyed to London. The entire family would travel by the floo network and always Kelly would panic over the prospect of George Blackburn, their muggle grandfather, using it. George would always, in return, balk and laugh at Kelly’s worry before going through first. Much to the amusement of both children. And in the end, they would arrive at Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. Where the old and magnificent Hogwarts Express stood ready to bring both wizards and witches forth to the magical school.</p>
<p>Having found a compartment and place to store his luggage. Jacob now stood outside the train once more. To say goodbye to his family one last time before departure. Having said farewell first to his parents and then his grandparents, the teenager turned to Lucas and leaned down to face him.</p>
<p>“You remember what I said yesterday,” The older sibling’s words more a wish than a question “You stay strong, little brother, alright?” </p>
<p>Lucas nodded. A half-choked “Yes,” the only words to escape the young boy as he struggled to hold back tears. Both brothers embraced, clinging to each other as if they would never let go. Stopping only when it was clear it was time to leave. Jacob entered the train. Looking out to his family through the window of his compartment. All waving goodbye as the signal for the train’s departure rang throughout the station. Lucas began running, desperate to follow his brother as long as he could. Forced to stop at the end of the platform. The last thing Lucas saw of his brother was him looking back with a sad smile on his lips.</p>
<p>The last of his brother Lucas would ever see.</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Twilight still ruled the sky as a young boy laid awake in his bed.</p>
<p>Huddled under his duvet, Lucas looked out the window, waiting for the sun to rise and the day to begin proper. It was the second of July and today was the day he would go to Diagon Alley to buy his wand and many other items needed for his first school year. He had awoken during the midst of dawn. Anxious and restless, it was no wonder he had been unable to sleep any further.</p>
<p>Lucas had always loved this day in times past. Whenever Jacob had to buy new equipment and books for his next year at Hogwarts. His parents would always make a big trip out of it. Stopping for lunch at one of the small cafés before ending at Fortescue’s for the biggest ice cream imaginable. He was certain that today would be like that once more, even if things were different now - even if Jacob was gone.</p>
<p>Just thinking about his brother made Lucas’ heart ache. It had been ten months since Lucas last saw his brother and seven months since he officially disappeared. Days had been hard enough without Jacob around and to know that he was gone forever… </p>
<p>Lucas began tumbling and moving around in his bunk. Hoping he could find some new position to lay down in that would relax him. He gave up soon enough. Unable to stay in bed any longer. The young boy jumped out of it. Putting on trousers and his favorite sweater. Lucas proceeded to sit at his desk.  </p>
<p>On the table laid a large book already opened. It had been given to him as early as yesterday as a gift from his grandparents for his eleventh birthday. The book itself was the latest edition of <em> Hogwarts: A History </em>, and although Lucas did not have the biggest passion for history. The boy had still read through the first two chapters with an intense interest brought on by the promise of soon starting at the same magical school.</p>
<p>Jumping through the pages of the book. The young Blackburn lost himself in the work. Spending dozens of minutes reading through interesting excerpts or looking at all the living pictures the book had to offer. Those who weren’t still fast asleep would either greet him or be busy reenacting historical moments for him to watch. Everything in it excited him. To know that he would soon study in such an ancient school that had taught so many powerful and famous wizards. It all left Lucas wondering; would he one day earn his own place in a book like this too? His eyes trailed away from the writing.</p>
<p>Gazing into nothingness. Lucas realized that his room was fully bathed in sunlight. Turning his attention back to the outside world. He looked at the clock in his room to read the time; 7:02. </p>
<p>Smacking the book close. The boy ran out of his room.</p>
<p>“Mum! Dad! It’s morning! You have to wake up! You have to get ready!”  Lucas blurted out as he rushed into his parents' bedroom. Running to the edge of the bed. He pulled at his mother’s duvet to help motivate her to get up. Lucas quickly looked over to the other side of the bed and realized it was empty. In the midst of all this. Mrs. Blackburn let out a loud groan as her son forcibly awakened her.</p>
<p>“Lucas...” She murmured, still struggling to open her eyes, her voice groggy “Why are you waking me?” Lucas’ attention returned to her.</p>
<p>“Because it’s morning and we’re going to Diagon Alley!” The wizard cried out. His enthusiasm nearly making him shout out the words. Kelly’s eyes moved to look at the nearest window.</p>
<p>“What time is it anyway?” She asked as she turned to glance at the alarm clock at her bedstand.</p>
<p>“Seven o’clock.” The child answered.</p>
<p>Kelly did not immediately reply back, taking a good read of the time on the clock. She let herself fall completely back into the bed. Covering her eyes with a single hand “Lucas, the stores don’t open until ten o’clock.” </p>
<p>“But I’m hungry too and I want breakfast!” Her son argued, tugging at her duvet once more. Kelly let out a long sigh before uncovering her eyes. She gazed at Lucas “Alright, just give me a minute.” </p>
<p>Soon enough both parent and child were down in the kitchen. Mrs. Blackburn was preparing a quick and simple breakfast consisting of toast, eggs, and bacon. As food was being served Lucas spoke up.</p>
<p>“Where is Dad? Is he out running?” The boy asked. He knew his father, Adam Blackburn, would sometimes wake up early for a morning run, an activity some of Adam’s colleagues considered eccentric, but usually, he would be home for breakfast. Kelly remained quiet as she put on food on both of their plates. Putting the frying pan back on the stove. She finally looked at her son.</p>
<p>“Your father left for the ministry earlier in the morning. He won’t be joining us for the day - I’m sorry,”  The words made Lucas’ jaw drop. </p>
<p>“But…” The words choked on him “But he promised he would...” Lucas’ eyes turned downcast. Fighting to keep his disappointment in check. His father had always ensured he would be with them on days like these.</p>
<p>“I know, Lucas.” Kelly reached out to hold her child’s hands “But the ministry demanded him at work. You know how important father’s job is.” Lucas did not respond. He knew his father was an Auror, one of the ministries’ elite agents trained to combat and apprehend dark wizards. He was used to his father being away at odd times or days at an end. In fact, his father was going to France to help train foreign Aurors sometime in September.  And yet he had always managed to be there when it was Jacob who needed something. Sensing her son’s sorrow, Kelly’s left hand moved to caress his cheek.</p>
<p>“Don’t cry, pumpkin. We can still have a good day today.” Kelly tried to reassure the junior Blackburn who returned with a weak nod. Both ate their breakfast in silence afterwards. Though Lucas found it considerably harder to finish his plate. His appetite seemingly shrunk.</p>
<p>With breakfast over and plenty of time left. Lucas went back up to his room to wait while his mother did chores on the floor below. He tried his best to distract himself with books and other things but found his mind always going back to the growing disappointment inside of him. Spending what felt like an eternity waiting. His mother finally entered his room and informed him to shower and get ready. </p>
<p>The boy complied. Having showered as ordered. He approached the bathroom mirror, comb in hand, to ensure he looked alright. Not a habit he usually practiced but seeing as he was to start a new life away from home. Lucas had the urge to prove that he could show off his best side to anyone. Once he figured out which side that was, of course!</p>
<p>Lucas Blackburn might have only been eleven years old but he was quite tall for his age, much like his father and brother. Unlike them, however, he was far thinner in his build which exaggerated his height. He wondered whether this would hinder or help his chances of making the quidditch team and wondered what position would be his best fit. Beyond that, his short hair was brown and slightly wavy in its nature, which made the comb seem like a futile gesture.</p>
<p>His own blue eyes stared back at him in the mirror as Lucas continued combing his brown and wavy hair into something resembling a distinguished look. He struggled figuring out which style of hair might best compliment his Roman nose and sharp, narrow eyes. He tried different methods, indecisive in his end goal.</p>
<p>Lucas combed his hair to the left and right. Even spending minutes correcting his clothes before surrendering. He was no good at this. His current effort just had to be enough.</p>
<p>He went downstairs where his mother waited for him. Mrs. Blackburn shared only a little with either of her children. Her two sons having inherited more from their father than her. Kelly was a petite woman of average height and modest face. Her blonde hair pulled to the back in the style of a bun; once it was of a strong, golden color, its hue had now faded over the last year. </p>
<p>“Lucas, put your shoes on,” His mother spoke as she handed him his footwear. Obeying her words both parent and child now stood fully ready. Walking over to the fireplace. Kelly did a last-minute inspection of her son to ensure he was fully tidied up, much to his annoyance.</p>
<p>“Mum, please, can we go now? I’ve already done this!” Lucas pleaded. Kelly continued her examination. Finished with straightening out his shirt. One hand then moved to lift up his chin as the second ensured there was not a single hint of dirt left on his face with a handkerchief.  </p>
<p>“There - Now you look ready,” Mrs. Blackburn did her best to smile at her child. With everything prepared, Kelly gestured Lucas to go first through the floo network. Taking a dash of the glittering powder stored next to the active fireplace. Lucas threw it into the flames which roared and turned green in response.</p>
<p>“Diagon Alley!” The young wizard shouted as he stepped into the fire and vanished.</p>
<p>Lucas had traveled by the floo network enough times not to be uncomfortable with the method of transport and arrived safely at the Leaky Cauldron. The old pub served as a gateway for those traveling to and from Diagon Alley, be it physically or via the floo network. The establishment had multiple small rooms dedicated solely to the use of the magical network. Having nothing more than a fireplace in them. It was one of such rooms Lucas arrived in, as did his mother who came through the same fireplace as he only a moment afterwards.</p>
<p>They proceeded onwards. Traveling through the Leaky Cauldron to get to the entrance of Diagon Alley proper.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Missis Blackburn!” The bartender behind the counter spoke out as mother and child crossed through the main hall “Here to get the young wizard ready for Hogwarts?” </p>
<p>“Good morning, Tom,” Kelly greeted as she and Lucas stopped and approached the counter instead. Even at this early hour the main hall of the pub was half-filled with people. Looking over his shoulder, Lucas noticed how some had turned their attention towards him and his mother upon hearing the Blackburn name. Kelly reached out to hold Lucas’ hand “And yes. I’m here to help get Jacob what he needs for school.”</p>
<p>Lucas’ concentration turned back to his mother immediately. Silence stood between all three and murmurs could be heard from several spectators. Kelly visibly blushed and let out a hollow chuckle realizing what she said. She gave a quick glance at Lucas who was staring back at her. Looking into her eyes Lucas couldn’t help but notice how vacant they seemed. </p>
<p>“I meant Lucas of course!” Kelly tugged her son’s hand before looking back at the bartender who gave a small nod in response. </p>
<p>“Aye, of course,” The man smiled. His eyes went to Lucas “Big day today for you; must be excited?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” The junior Blackburn answered in a curt manner, not feeling too much up for talking. Tom returned his focus to Kelly.</p>
<p>“I see your husband is not with you. Adam too busy?”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately yes. Office called him in at the last minute.” Kelly paused to look at the time on her watch “Listen, Tom, I wish I could stay and talk, but me and Lucas have so much to do today!” She tugged the child’s hand again.</p>
<p>Saying goodbye to the bartender. The two Blackburns proceeded to their destination. Lucas overheard the hushed talks of the bar as they left.</p>
<p>
  <em> “Poor woman.” </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> “Hope you don’t lose this one too, Blackburn.” </em>
</p>
<p>Neither Kelly nor Lucas spoke leaving the Leaky Cauldron. Arriving at Diagon Alley. Lucas looked up to the sky. His mood felt soured and seeing how London’s weather today was a miserable shade of grey did little to change that. The young wizard turned to his mother hoping for some reassurance that the day would still be as good as he hoped for, but she offered nothing but a weak smile and somber eyes.</p>
<p>They continued walking towards their first stop. </p>
<p>Standing before Flourish and Blotts. Kelly asked Lucas to go in and find the literature himself while she would buy the equipment he needed. Entrusting him with a Galleon and ten Sickles (<em> don’t you think of spending as much as a Knut on anything else! </em>) to buy the eight books mandated. His mother left to make other needed purchases.</p>
<p>Entering the bookstore, Lucas felt a rush of excitement. He had never carried so much money on his own before. He relished the idea of being on his own. To prove he could handle it.</p>
<p>The store was busy with dozens of customers browsing through it. Reaching for the shopping list. Lucas came to the realization that his mother had forgotten to give him the piece of paper. Blackburn’s first instinct was to leave the store and look for her, but she had given express orders for him to stay there until she returned.</p>
<p>He looked around to find a shop assistant to help him, but all were too busy. Struggling to remember any of the books on the list aside from <em> Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them </em>. Lucas started searching for it rather than standing in the store looking lost.</p>
<p>“Are you also looking for <em> Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them </em>?”  A curious voice behind the young wizard asked. Blackburn froze for a moment, not used to having other kids speak to him. He ceased his scouring to face whoever it was.</p>
<p>In front of Lucas stood a skinny boy of his own age. He was of British-Indian descent, his skin a light-brown hue. Facing each other. Lucas only responded with a raised eyebrow and a muted expression. The boy had a long face with a sharp chin, marked cheekbones, and large ears. He also wore large glasses that were sliding down his nose, making him quickly readjust them.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. You just looked like somebody who is also going to start at Hogwarts,” The British-Indian adjusted his glasses a second time. His voice now shy “And I thought…” </p>
<p>Lucas grinned. It felt good to finally meet someone else in the same boat as him “Actually I am!” He gestured at the bookshelf behind him “And yes. I am looking for that exact book!” </p>
<p>The other boy’s expression lightened up “Great! We can help each other find it!” He approached the bookshelf next to Lucas. Both started searching.</p>
<p>“I’m so excited to start at school!  I’ve already read <em> Hogwarts: A History </em> in anticipation, so I’m something of an expert on it,” The boy explained as they first looked for the zoology section. Blackburn’s eyes went from focusing on the shelf to his compatriot.</p>
<p>“I’ve just started that book myself!” Lucas paused his search. The other boy looked back at him. His expression brightening even further.</p>
<p>“Really?” The other wizard suspended his own sifting “Who do you think was the best of the four founders? From everything I’ve read I’d say Slytherin.”</p>
<p>Lucas’ eyes darted upwards for a moment “Him or Gryffindor. Godric sounds like he was the best duelist, but I bet Salazar knew some wicked magic - a shame he left though.”</p>
<p>The other boy scratched his chin before nodding at Lucas’ answer. Both of them turned back to their original task. With the zoology section found, it was just a matter of finding the books starting with F and soon both young wizards held a copy of Newt Scamander’s magnum opus in their hands. The other boy glanced over the text on the back of the book.</p>
<p>“I think that’s the last book for me,” He looked at Lucas “What about you? Do you have what you need?”</p>
<p>“No,” Blackburn glanced at a nearby bookshelf for a brief moment “I still need all the others, but I forgot the list and my mother told me to stay here until she returns.” Lucas blushed as he explained the last part, ashamed to still be relying on his parents so much. </p>
<p>“That’s okay! My parents already helped me find all the other books,” The boy pointed at someone at the other end of the store. Lucas turned and saw a well-dressed man and woman who had to be his parents, they were busy talking with the store owner. The boy continued “I can help show you where they are if you want.”</p>
<p>Lucas looked back at him, smiling “I’d appreciate that.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I nearly forgot!” The boy reached out with one hand for a handshake. Struggling to hold the large textbook with the other “My name is Rowan Khanna. What’s yours?”</p>
<p>Lucas took it.</p>
<p>“I’m Lucas … Lucas Blackburn.”</p>
<p>The book nearly slipped out of Rowan’s grasp as they were shaking hands. Forcing Khanna to withdraw his right to help assist holding the tome. They stared at each other for a moment before both laughing. </p>
<p>Rowan gestured Lucas to follow him. Going from bookshelf to bookshelf. They found the remainder of the needed literature, one text at a time. Khanna spent it talking about his family.</p>
<p>“My parents own the biggest tree-farm here in Great Britain. We supply wood for both wands and brooms!” Rowan explained as he handed Lucas a copy of <em> Magical Theory </em>. </p>
<p>Blackburn raised an eyebrow “You’re a tree-farmer?” Khanna shook his head.</p>
<p>“My parents are, but…” Rowan shrugged his shoulders ”I’m not very good at it. That’s why I love reading books so much. It gives me an excuse to be inside instead!” The British-Indian grinned at the last part of his words. Lucas nodded, content to let Khanna do most of the chattering.</p>
<p>Finding the last of the eight books. Rowan helped Blackburn carry the texts to the counter, where they were allowed to place them until it was time for Lucas to purchase and leave. He looked at Blackburn</p>
<p>“What about you? What do your parents do?” </p>
<p>“Well…” Lucas looked down at his feet “My dad’s an Auror.”</p>
<p>“Your father is an Auror?!” Rowan’s eyes widened in revelation “Wait! Are you the brother of Jacob Blackburn? The one who was expelled from Hogwarts and went missing?” Lucas’ eyes slowly traveled up to face him.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Lucas answered in a meek tone, struggling to meet Rowan’s gaze “Jacob Blackburn is my brother.”</p>
<p>“I read all about it! Did your brother really get expelled because he was searching for cursed vaults hidden under the school?” Rowan asked in the same curious and enthusiastic tone as when he first spoke in the bookstore.</p>
<p>“That was the reason the headmaster gave.”  </p>
<p>“It was a massive story in the <em> Daily Prophet </em>. Everyone at school is going to know about it!” Rowan exclaimed. Lucas’ mouth and eyebrows curved downwards in response. Blackburn looked away again. </p>
<p>“I know. I just hope they won't all think I'm weird because of it," Lucas’ voice was gloomy. He had looked forward to going to Hogwarts. But after the Leaky Cauldron and the way Rowan talked about it; a fear had started to creep into his mind. Khanna’s curious demeanor vanished seeing the other boy’s reaction.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to trouble you,” Rowan scratched the back of his head as his eyes shied away as well. Silence stood between them for a brief moment before Rowan’s features brightened up once more “But you don’t have to worry if you are weird! People usually think I’m too weird - we can be weird together!” </p>
<p>Lucas gazed back at Rowan who awaited his answer with a large smile. His depressed demeanor vanished at the sight of Khanna’s sincerity. </p>
<p>“What? Like friends?” Blackburn asked cautiously. He had never had any friends back in his muggle school nor any from the wizarding world either. It felt strange having someone so suddenly be open like this.</p>
<p>“Yeah, like friends! If you don’t mind, of course…” A hint of nervousness could be traced in Khanna’s words at the end. Blackburn let out a small laugh. Rowan might indeed be a little weird, but that was okay. </p>
<p>“Don’t worry!” Lucas answered in a reassuring voice “I don’t mind at all.”</p>
<p>The two soon-to-be-students talked for several minutes before Khanna was signaled over by his parents to return. Lucas watched the three of them speak for a short minute. Rowan then pointed and waved at him to join them.</p>
<p>“Lucas, these are my parents” Rowan gestured towards the two adults as Blackburn approached “Mum, Dad, this is my new friend Lucas Blackburn.”  </p>
<p>“Hello,” Lucas offered his hand for a shake. Feeling nervous.</p>
<p>“Pleasure to meet you,” Mr. Khanna greeted him, giving him a firm handshake. Mr. Khanna was a well-groomed man with a trimmed beard. He wore a tailored suit that Lucas could tell was expensive.</p>
<p>Mrs. Khanna greeted him next “It is nice to meet you, Lucas,” She wore a simple casual dress of a deep purple color. Mrs. Khanna spoke her English fluently, but with an accent that betrayed the fact that she did not originate from the UK. She continued “I understand that you will also start your first year at Hogwarts in September?” </p>
<p>“Yes, I’m--” </p>
<p>“Lucas!” A new voice interrupted Blackburn before he could finish. All four turned to face the new arrival. Kelly Blackburn was walking up to her son with a shopping bag in her left hand. Standing next to Lucas, she gave a quick glance at Rowan “I see you made a new friend!”</p>
<p>“Mum, this is Rowan Khanna, and these are his parents,” Lucas motioned at the Khanna family. Kelly quickly lowered her shopping bag to the ground and introduced herself to each of them.</p>
<p>“Pumpkin, I’m so sorry I forgot to give you the list!” Mrs. Blackburn spoke out after the greetings were done. Her words made Mrs. Khanna smile and Lucas’ cheeks turn red.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, Mum. Rowan helped me with finding the books!” Lucas pointed a finger at the counter where all eight of the texts were stacked and waiting for purchase.</p>
<p>“Did he now?” Kelly gave a nod of approval towards Rowan “What a fine man you are for helping Lucas!” She looked at all members of the Khanna family once more.</p>
<p>“Listen, I’m so glad to have made your acquaintance, but I’m afraid me and Lucas have to go now,” Kelly explained. Lucas and Rowan were left looking at each other.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess we’ll see each other soon then!” Lucas spoke, trying his best to sound cheerful. Wishing there was more time to stay. </p>
<p>“Hopefully, we can sit in the same compartment on the Hogwarts Express,” Rowan suggested in a wistful tone “It would be nice to have somebody else to talk to.”</p>
<p>Lucas gave a faint smile at the suggestion “I like that idea.” </p>
<p>Saying their goodbye to Rowan and his parents. The two Blackburns went to the desk and purchased the books. As they left the store, Lucas turned to look back into the shop. Waving goodbye to the Khanna family, though hopefully not for the last time.</p>
<p>Returning to the streets of Diagon Alley. Lucas walked next to his mother who now carried a shopping bag in both hands. Observing all the stores they passed by; an exciting idea came to Lucas’ mind.</p>
<p>“Can I get an owl, Mum? A new one?” Lucas’ voice snapped Kelly’s attention back to her son.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, pumpkin, You’ll get Cypria with you for when you start,” Kelly answered. Cypria was the family’s owl and had been for the last Eighteen years. </p>
<p>“Cypria?!” Lucas protested in disbelief “But she’s old! Jacob got Spitfire when he started!” Spitfire was the owl Adam and Kelly had given their first son as a gift when he began. Jacob had named it in honor of the muggle aircraft their grandfather had flown.</p>
<p>“Your father needs a new owl. Cypria is too slow for him now, but she can still serve you just fine.” Kelly declared with finality in her tone. Lucas did not answer back beyond pouting, knowing it was no use.</p>
<p>Parent and child walked in silence towards their last goal of getting Lucas his wand. Despite the disappointment of not getting a new owl. The young wizard could feel a fresh mixture of excitement and tension brewing inside of him at the prospect of finally getting his own wand. For getting one was perhaps one of the most important parts of any wizard’s journey.</p>
<p>For such a renowned place, Ollivanders had quite a humble front. Behind an old, dusty glass laid only a wand on a faded purple cushion. And above the door stood the name of the shop followed by a simple statement proclaiming itself “Maker of fine wands since 382 B.C.”</p>
<p>A small bell rang as the pair entered the store. Behind the desk of the shop stood Ollivander himself, scribbling away in a notebook.</p>
<p>“Welcome Missis Blackburn,” Ollivander spoke out in a soft voice as he continued writing, not even looking at the new arrivals. Mother and child approached him. Lucas had never been in this store before, and he found himself shudder instinctively. There was something greater resting in this place whose mere presence pressured him from a thousand sides. </p>
<p>“Hello, Mister Ollivander,” Kelly answered. Slowly walking towards the desk. With the pair standing at the counter. Ollivander finally raised his head. His pale eyes fixated solely on Lucas.</p>
<p>“Ah, I’ve been looking forward to seeing you in my store Mister Blackburn,” The wandmaker drew a faint smile. Lucas felt petrified under Ollivander’s gaze who studied him like a curator examining an artwork “If you are anything like your brother and father, you will make for an excellent challenge.” </p>
<p>“I hope you are not planning to spend two hours finding a wand like you did last time,” Kelly commented in a tone struggling to be humorous, drawing the store owner's attention.</p>
<p>“I make no promises, Missis Blackburn,” Ollivander replied in a coy manner.  Kelly nodded and turned to look at Lucas.</p>
<p>“Listen, Lucas, is it alright if I leave you here to go buy some things we need in the meantime? Just like at Flourish and Blotts,” She returned her attention to Ollivander and raised one shopping bag “Would it be okay if I left our items here until I return?”</p>
<p>“No worries, Missis Blackburn, everything will be in good hands,” Ollivander declared as he took one shopping bag at a time to place behind the counter. Mrs. Blackburn thanked him and wished Lucas luck with finding a wand before parting ways.</p>
<p>“Now then, shall we begin?” Ollivander spoke out to Lucas after Mrs. Blackburn went out the door. Lucas turned to look at him and gave an excited nod. The wandmaker retrieved a measuring tape from his pocket “Show me your wand arm.”</p>
<p>Lucas held out his right arm. The measuring tape, driven by magic, began floating on its own, gauging the length between Lucas’ shoulder and finger, wrist and elbow, and on and on. All while Ollivander was looking through his shelves.</p>
<p>“Your brother carried an Ebony wand. Fourteen inches - little flexibility - with a phoenix feather as its core,” Ollivander took down several boxes from the shelf “Perhaps one of the finest wands I ever had the pleasure of creating. A pity they broke it following his banishment.”</p>
<p>Lucas stared at the old man. Unsure of what to say. It felt odd hearing someone else talk about his brother after his disappearance. His own mother and father certainly were reluctant to. The measuring tape had finished its examination of Blackburn and had fallen lifelessly to the ground. Ollivander had retrieved several wands from their boxes, ready for Lucas to test.</p>
<p>“Here, try this one,” Ollivander handed the young wizard a wand “eleven inches, Ebony with unicorn hair. Decent flexibility.” Lucas reached for it. </p>
<p>“Ow!” The boy cried out, withdrawing his hand. Before he could even touch the wand he had received what felt like a big static discharge. Ollivander immediately discarded the wand.</p>
<p>“Obviously not that. Let’s try something different,” The wandmaker offered a second wand “Ash with dragon heartstring, eleven-and-a-half inch, quite bendy. Closer to your father’s.” Lucas barely got a hold of the wand before Ollivander snatched it out of his hands, shaking his head “No, no, that won’t do! Here! Thirteen inches cypress wand with phoenix feather as its core.”</p>
<p>Lucas swung the cypress wand but nothing happened. Blackburn frowned at the lack of results.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, sir, but am I doing something wrong?” Lucas asked while handing back the artifact.</p>
<p>“Oh no! Do not fear, Mister Blackburn. Few wizards rarely find their wand quickly.” Ollivander explained while setting aside the third one. The wandmaster went back to the shelf to bring more boxes. Lucas could only watch and wait.</p>
<p>The store owner returned with half a dozen packages. Like before Lucas tried each and every one of them and like before none were a match. Doubt crawled into Blackburn’s heart as the cycle repeated itself, and a pyramid of boxes had gathered on the desk next to a pile of tried wands. By now, they were at their sixth batch.</p>
<p>“Here, Applewood with dragon heartstring, twelve inches and rigid. Give it a twirl!” Ollivander exclaimed enthusiastically, handing Lucas the last of this round of wands. The young wizard swung the magical item only for the loose papers in the store to wildly fly as if a gust of wind had blown through the shop.</p>
<p>“I knew you would be a good challenge, Mister Blackburn,” The wandmaker spoke with a bemused expression seeing the spectacle and another batch of wands failing. </p>
<p>“Sorry,” Lucas sheepishly handed back the wand. His ears red. </p>
<p>“It’s not your fault,” Ollivander reassured; if he was irritated or angry at Lucas’ difficulty, it was not showing “I recall your brother exploding my favorite inkpot all those years ago.” Lucas grinned at the words. Imagining Jacob and the entire store smudged in ink. His joy was short-lived. The pain of his brother’s absence striking back. He looked away. </p>
<p>The wandmaker gazed at the young spellcaster. His pale eyes alert and observant “Your brother was a talented wizard from what I understand - Best in his year.” </p>
<p>“Yeah…” Lucas’ tone was melancholic. The young wizard returned Ollivander’s gaze with his own “I remember him getting straight Os in his O.W.Ls.” </p>
<p>“That must have put a lot of expectations on you. And now that he is gone…” Ollivander’s words trailed off at the end. Unable or unwilling to finish the phrase. Blackburn broke his gaze again.</p>
<p>“I just hope I can live up to him,” Lucas answered with an uneasy voice. He remembered how proud mother and father were of Jacob. Would they ever look at him the same way?</p>
<p>Ollivander gave the young wizard a pensive look. Silence ruled the shop for a moment. Then the wandmaker wandered off to a shelf hidden further in the back. He returned this time with another six boxes.</p>
<p>“I think one of these wands might just be the one!” Ollivander proclaimed. Drawing Lucas’ mind back to the matter at hand. The boy watched the opening of the first box with renewed interest.</p>
<p>“Willow wood, unicorn hair, ten inches, and little flex.”</p>
<p>Lucas tried the wand. Giving it a swing as he had with many others, but nothing happened.</p>
<p>“We’re getting closer! Willow wood is certainly part of the answer!” Ollivander acknowledged excitedly. Taking back the first wand and passing the second “Same core and wood, but twelve inches and good flexibility.”</p>
<p>The second did naught as all previously had done, yet Ollivander only seemed to grow more gleeful. Much to Lucas’ confusion.</p>
<p>“We have the wood, length, and flexibility of the wand. Now we just need to figure out the core!” The wandmaster declared as he rushed off to find new artifacts. Relief washed over Lucas. If everything but the core was settled and they had already tried Unicorn hair, that meant there were only two possible wands left! </p>
<p>Ollivander returned. First was the phoenix feather core. The wandmaker brought forth the package and opened it. Giving Lucas the honor of extracting the artifact.</p>
<p>Lucas smiled. Knowing that this might be the wand. The chance to finally be given the tool he needed to master the powers of magic. Taking a deep breath. He reached for the object and closed his eyes as his fingers wrapped around the handle, drawing out the finely crafted wand.</p>
<p>And then … Nothing…</p>
<p>Lucas opened his eyes. Giving the wand a twirl, he could do nothing but glare at it as not even a hint of magic sprung from it. The young wizard looked over at Ollivander who raised a single eyebrow in response</p>
<p>“Well then, I suppose that leaves only one candidate - Dragon heartstring!”</p>
<p>The wandmaker reached for a new box. Lucas watched intensely as the content of the package was revealed. Inside laid a wand not that different than any of the previously tried. It was smooth and plain in its build. Its grip covered with dark leather. A part of his mind thought it rather unassuming in its appearance, especially given the time spent hunting for it.</p>
<p>“Go on, try it,” The wandmaker suggested. His eyes fixated on Lucas’ hand as it reached out for the wand. Watching with bated breath as the young wizard’s fingers closed in around the grip.</p>
<p>Lucas slowly raised the artifact from its rest. Holding the wand, a cold surged from his fingers into the very heart of him. A part of his mind told him to drop the wand and beg for another, that this was wrong. He tightened his grip in response, strangling the idea before it could grow any further. </p>
<p>Lucas was not sure if it was his imagination or not, but it felt as if the wand struggled against his hold like some living animal. The cold had spread to the rest of his body and it sharpened in its intensity. He ignored it, knowing there was no option but to endure. Lucas’ hand was now violently shaking trying to hold the artifact. Cold turned to pain as the wand continued to challenge the child. </p>
<p>The cold withdrew from his body, and his hand now held steady. Lucas raised the wand in triumph, but where he expected to conjure a flash of light or spark of fire, something different happened. Light dimmed and Blackburn watched as every shadow on wall and floor grew stronger. </p>
<p>And then it all ended. </p>
<p>“Magnificent… most magnificent,” Ollivander murmured, motioning Lucas to hand him the wand. Holding it for himself, the wandmaker gazed at the object with an inquisitive look “I did not expect the wand to bond in such a way.”</p>
<p>“Is there something different about this wand, sir?” Lucas asked, his own eyes focused on the item. Ollivander’s attention moved to the other wizard.</p>
<p>“No,” The wandmaster handed back the artifact “Not at all.”</p>
<p>Lucas held the wand in both ends. Slowly spinning it around “Then why did you find it so interesting?” He asked with trepidation. Wondering if he would like the answer.</p>
<p>“There is a saying in my family `He who has furthest to travel will go fastest with willow.´ And to see such powers emerging from that kind of wand. Well…” The wandmaker’s pale eyes now gazed right into Lucas’ own “Be wary on your journey, Mister Blackburn, especially of yourself.”</p>
<p>An eerie stillness followed Ollivander’s words. Lucas’ eyes widened and his twisting of the wand ceased. The warning froze Lucas in his place, too stunned to say anything. </p>
<p>The small bell rang in the background. Heralding Kelly’s return “Hello, hope I am not disturbing anything!” </p>
<p>Ollivander’s eyes moved to her, his expression and tone cheery as if nothing had happened “Oh no worry Missis Blackburn, we have just found a suitable wand for the young wizard here!” Kelly gave her son a quick glance.</p>
<p>“That’s wonderful, how much?”</p>
<p>They parted with seven galleons for the wand and were out of the store soon after. Kelly had purchased even more items while she had been away, so now Lucas was carrying two shopping bags as well.</p>
<p>Walking down the street Lucas realized that they were close to Fortescue’s. Snapping his thoughts away from the ominous words spoken in the shop.</p>
<p>“Can we go get ice cream?” Lucas asked. Stopping at Fortescue’s had always been one of the highpoints in previous years.</p>
<p>“No, Lucas,” Kelly declared, not breaking stride or looking at her son. Lucas stopped, however, forcing Mrs. Blackburn to do the same.</p>
<p>“We’ve always done it previous years!” Lucas blurted out. His voice more raised than it should have been. </p>
<p>Kelly sighed. Freeing one hand to point it at the sky “The weather is not up for it.” Lucas looked up. From what he could see, the weather didn’t seem any worse than it already was. Mrs. Blackburn took a step closer.</p>
<p>“I know you hoped to do lots things here - I promised you, but things aren’t just allowing that today.”</p>
<p>Lucas’ sight drifted away and gazed into nothingness. The child shook his head. His disappointment so strong he could not feel any anger. Even if he objected, what was the point? To drag his mother around who clearly didn’t want to be here? Previous years were fun because they all were together; because Jacob was back…</p>
<p>“Come, let’s go home,” Kelly said. Trying once more to smile for her son. Lucas simply nodded. Accepting that defiance was meaningless.</p>
<p>They were home soon afterwards. Lucas spent the next hours alone in his room. Having nothing else to do than to continue reading his book. But the excitement and interest he had previously read with was dimmed. And then there was Ollivander’s warning. What did the wandmaker mean? Was there something wrong with him?</p>
<p>Day turned to evening and Lucas’ father had still not come home by the time it was seven o’clock. Leaving Kelly to eat dinner with her son alone. It was a plain meal by previous standards Lucas thought. He remembered his mother always cooking the most delicious food, but whatever passion that inspired such work had disappeared like so much else in the last seven months.</p>
<p>Sitting around the dinner table. Mother and son ate their food in silence. Neither taking much on their plate. Lucas didn’t feel hungry; his thoughts still darkened by the wandmaker’s words.</p>
<p>“Are you still looking forward to Hogwarts?” Kelly asked. Breaking the stillness that had ruled the house for hours. </p>
<p>“Of course, Mum,” He quietly answered, not lifting his eyes from his food.</p>
<p>Kelly gave a faint smile “Promise me you will do well at school, pumpkin. I don’t want to get another letter saying you haven’t done your homework.”</p>
<p>The child glared at her. Aware of what she was referring to. Lucas had never liked his muggle school one bit, but in years past, he had always been quiet and able to stay out of trouble. After Jacob disappeared, however, he started to ignore his homework, yell at his teachers, and managed to get into scuffles with the other boys from his class. In the end, the school sent several warnings to his parents and even brought them down to talk about him. His father had been furious with him that day.</p>
<p>Lucas Stabbed at a small piece of meat with his fork “I promise I will do good.”</p>
<p>“You’ve said that before--” </p>
<p>“It’s different this time!” Lucas interrupted his mother “I want to study at Hogwarts! I never wanted to study at a stupid muggle school with stupid muggles!” He spat out the last words. His anger and distaste for his old teachers and classmates resurfacing. He hated them. Had he been strong like Jacob, he would have cast a curse on every one of them before leaving.</p>
<p>“Lucas!” Kelly’s voice was exasperated “Don’t talk like that! Your father and I didn’t raise you to speak of people in such a way!”</p>
<p>Lucas stabbed the food one last time with force. His eyes narrowed in “It’s the truth!” </p>
<p>Kelly’s brows furrowed and she pinched her lips. A flash of green light emerged from the living room, a sign of the floo network being used. Making both mother and son turn their heads towards that direction. From the glass-panel doors Adam Blackburn arrived, lit cigarette in mouth.</p>
<p>“Evening,” Adam wearily spoke out. Giving a glance at his family as he stamped out his cigarette in a close-by ashtray. Adam Blackburn shared many of the same features his sons had, compared to Lucas however, it was clear Adam was far more broad-shouldered and his face more square-jawed in nature. A relaxing scent of tobacco usually surrounded Adam, but as he approached the table to join his family. It seemed today less a smell and more a stench of spent cigarettes.</p>
<p>“Sorry I am home so late, love,” Adam gave his wife a small kiss before pulling out a chair and letting himself fall into it. A sigh of relief emerged from the man who looked as if he was ready to fall asleep. Adam turned to look at Lucas “So, how was your day, son?”</p>
<p>Lucas shrugged his shoulders “It was okay,” he mumbled.</p>
<p>Adam nodded but said nothing. Mrs. Blackburn was in the process of filling up a plate with food for her husband. </p>
<p>“Lucas got a new friend today;” Kelly stated as she handed her man his plate. Ending the quiet that was brewing between them. </p>
<p>Adam raised a single eyebrow “Did he now? Who was it?”</p>
<p>“Rowan Khanna,” Lucas answered “I met him at the bookstore. He’s going to start his first year as well.”</p>
<p>“The tree farmer’s son?” Adam repeated “I forgot he was the same age as you.” </p>
<p>Lucas said nothing further, and his father began eating his dinner. None of them spoke any words until Adam was half-finished with his meal.</p>
<p>“How was your day, dear?” Kelly finally asked. Adam let out a deep groan hearing the question.</p>
<p>“Dreadful! Twelve hours spent hunting down a dark wizard fleeing from France and hiding in London supposedly. It was nothing but a wild goose chase.”</p>
<p>“There are dark wizards escaping from France?” Kelly asked.</p>
<p>“Just one apparently, but we never even found a hint of him entering our country.” Adam paused to let out a large yawn before continuing “Speaking of France…”</p>
<p>Both Lucas and Kelly now stared attentively at Mr. Blackburn. Adam looked at both of them. Scratching the back of his head and letting out a new sigh.</p>
<p>“There’s been a development regarding the exchange program,” Adam explained. Lucas knew his father referred to his upcoming trip to France with the ministry to train other Aurors. Adam continued “The ministry has made a last-minute change of date. They’ve moved it to start one week earlier.” </p>
<p>Lucas knew his mother was also planning to travel to France with his father to visit friends and he knew it was supposed to happen very early September. </p>
<p>“But that means…” Lucas spoke out loud as his mind put the facts together. </p>
<p>“It means that I won’t be there to say goodbye to you on the third of September,” Adam finished the statement. He glanced at his wife as he reached out to hold her hand before turning his gaze back to Lucas “It also means your mother won’t be there to say goodbye either.” </p>
<p>Lucas’ jaw dropped and his eyes widened in disbelief. He stared at his parents, too shocked to say anything. They both started talking, explaining and justifying their decision. Why it was necessary for his father to go on the trip and how impractical it would be for his mother not to change her plans to follow suit. But their words were like wind in Lucas’ ears and he did nothing but feebly nod at their every point. He left the table at the earliest moment convenient. Returning to his room and crashing onto his bed.</p>
<p>Lucas had started the day looking forward to everything it would bring. But as the young wizard laid in his bunk, he was left wondering what he had done wrong.</p>
