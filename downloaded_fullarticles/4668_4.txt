    <p>Lucius Malfoy was basically an assistant to the Minister of Magic, as such it was his job to perform a last minute check of all departments within the Ministry. So far he was the only one in the building, at least until he stopped at the final department, The Department of Muggle Artifacts. </p>
<p>Peeking into the office he smirked a bit. The ginger haired head of Arthur Weasley was setting at the desk still at work. Lucius slipped into the office quietly and stepped over to the married man, gently Lucius slid his hands down Arthur's sides and ribs to rest gently on the arms of the chair.</p>
<p>Just as Lucius knew it would this caused Arthur to shudder and sigh in pleasure. Lucius had found this small detail out by an accidental incident where he'd brushed against Arthur and Arthur had very nearly came right then and there. Since that time Lucius had made it a point to torment his rival in this way.</p>
<p>Lucius leaned in to whisper in Arthur's ear. “And just why are you still here Arthur?” He asked quietly. “Need the money, Malfoy. Got kids to feed.” Arthur responded curtly. It was a well known fact that he and Lucius despised one another. </p>
<p>“But you will do them no good if you wear yourself out.” Lucius whispered and gently pressed a kiss to a particular place behind Arthur's ear. Arthur, despite trying to fight it, let out a small groan. Lucius smirked and attacked that very spot with an onslaught of licks, kisses and the occasional very slight nip of his teeth while at the same time gently rubbing and caressing Arthur's ribs and sides.</p>
<p>The effect was instantaneous. Arthur arched and moaned, much louder than he would have liked. Lucius continued like this until he had Arthur positively writhing at his touch. “Oh shit… L-Lucius… Oh Merlin…” Arthur couldn't fight the moans as they kept coming. His pants were getting very tight, why the hell was he unable to fight this? He arched and his hips bucked on their own as the onslaught continued. “Lucius… Oh fuck…”</p>
<p>It was well known that Arthur hated that word, but the sudden overload of pleasure forced the word out of his mouth. Arthur winced a bit, he didn't want to expose himself to this man. But his pants had become painful and he had to do something about it. Slowly, he moved a hand and undid his pants and unzipped them, his erection was quite noticeable like this, but it did offer some relief; albeit not much.</p>
<p>Lucius chuckled against Arthur's neck he leaned in a bit and slid his hands down to rub Arthur through the boxers his wore. Arthur arched with a gasp and loud moan his hips immediately bucking into the hands. “Oh Merlin Lucius…” He moaned, his head tossed back to rest against his rival's shoulder. His hips bucked again, desperate for skin to skin contact. His body willingly asking the words his mouth refused to say. </p>
<p>“Who knew you were such a slut Arthur?” Lucius degraded, this only made Arthur need it worse. Lucius could feel a section of Arthur's boxers dampen, signaling the fluid that is expelled shortly before a good hard ejaculation. It was time! “Slut!” Lucius degraded again. Arthur writhed and moaned, he was desperate for release.</p>
<p>“Arthur's a little slut!” Lucius degraded continually while moving to kneel before Arthur. He gently pulled the leaking shaft out of Arthur's boxers and gave it a hard stroke. </p>
<p>Arthur nearly yelled in delight. “Luci...us… Oh fuck… Please…” Arthur couldn't believe he was actually begging for this. Lucius chuckled and jerked Arthur again, precum dripped from the head. Lucius gave another sharp jerk. This time Arthur arched of the chair. His breathing erratic, his moans loud and his voice pleading. “Please, Lucius please… Oh Merlin Lucius… Please… I… I need you…”</p>
<p>Lucius shivered as Arthur begged for it. He loved the sound, loved forcing the moans and begging from Arthur. He jerked Arthur again, this time his thumb was pressed firm against the main artery on the underside of the shaft in his hand, and when he got to the head, he rolled his thumb up over the tip. Arthur came completely undone in that moment. He bucked and arched, begging… Pleading for it as he never had before. “Lucius… Oh dear fuck… Lucius… Please… Please just fuck me… I need you… I need you fucking me… Please… Just make me yours…” </p>
<p>Lucius chuckled and quickly adjusted them both so that Arthur was laying on his desk. Lucius had been planning this and unbelted his pants then undone the button and zipper, he slid them down to reveal his own rock hard erection. “You're going to have to wet this down if you want it Arthur” He moved and helped Arthur to roll so that he could reach the shaft before him.</p>
<p>Arthur gladly took the shaft into his mouth sucking and licking it gracefully, as if he'd done it before. Lucius moaned loudly and arched a bit. “You're a good little cocksucker!” He degraded which made Arthur lick and suck harder. Lucius threw his head back and moaned. Arthur liked being verbally degraded Lucius realized. “Suck slut!” He ordered and Arthur did. </p>
<p>Lucius forced himself away before he came but he did allow Arthur a few drops of precum. He groaned as he pulled back and readjusted them both so that Arthur was once again on his back, his legs up. Lucius draped Arthur's legs over his own shoulders and began pressing his shaft head against Arthur's quivering entrance, he pushed forward watching as the head slowly popped into Arthur.</p>
<p>Arthur grunted a bit but he moaned as well. His entrance wasn't really prepared, but they both knew he could handle it as Lucius pressed in further. Arthur grunted some, but it was quickly replaced by a moan. Again Lucius pressed into Arthur, he was about half way in now. He slid out completely and pressed in again further now, he repeated this slow process until he was fully inside Arthur. </p>
<p>Arthur was secretly thankful that Lucius had been slow and patient, but now… He needed to move… And move Lucius did, slowly at first, pulling out just a bit and pushing in again until he had worked up a good steady rhythm. They both let out soft moans as Lucius began to work up his pace until he was practically slamming himself into Arthur, and Arthur was matching him pace for pace. Each moaning in nothing short of absolute pleasure, desire and lust.</p>
<p>Arthur had never been fucked by a man before, but it felt amazing. He gave himself over to the carnal need and desires bucking his hips up into Lucius with each of Lucius’ hard quick thrusts. He could feel a tightening in his groin. He knew he was close. Then suddenly, it happened… Lucius had struck something deep inside him, and Arthur unhinged completely. He jerked, arched and screamed out as thick white ropes of fluid exploded from his shaft landing on his waist and abs. </p>
<p>Lucius arched at that time as he too hit his climax and filled Arthur full of cum. He came hard, thick and fast, this only adding to Arthur pleasure high. Arthur wrapped his legs around Lucius’ waist riding out their intense climax as he raised his upper torso some, pulled Lucius to him and roughly crushed their lips together, their tongues battling for supremacy.</p>
<p>When only a few drops trickled out into Arthur, Arthur finally let go of Lucius’ neck and lay back on the desk, his head resting on some papers. He panted hard, fighting to catch his breath. His erection now gone, he simply lay there… His mind was in a complete fog.</p>
<p>Lucius smiled gently and watched Arthur recover, he had a smile on his face as he too, caught his breath then gently pulled out and cast a cleaning charm to clean both him and Arthur and then the room. He tucked himself back into his briefs and pulled his pants up, buttoning and zipping them before replacing the belt.</p>
<p>Arthur finally moved, he blinked and looked at Lucius. “Wow…” It was all he could come up with. Lucius chuckled. “You enjoy that did you Arthur?” He asked smirking. Arthur simply nodded. His throat was a bit dry now. “Why?” He asked hoarsely. Lucius looked at him. There was a silence before Lucius spoke. “Because I love you!” He said simply before turning and walking out of the room.</p>
