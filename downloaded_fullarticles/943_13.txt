</p>
<hr/><p>Hogwarts castle was dark and silent as Hermione surreptitiously exited the kitchens with a handful of treats. She let out a muffled shriek, spewing buscuit crumbs as she bumped into something solid – and invisible.</p><p>"Ssh." The invisible object hissed.</p><p>"Harry? What are you doing here?"</p><p>"The same as you, I expect. Couldn't sleep. Nightmares, again. " He whispered.</p><p>She put a hand on his invisible shoulder in solidarity. "So you came down for a 2 am snack?"</p><p>He shushed her again. "Quiet – I heard footsteps a minute ago."</p><p>His warning had come too late, as the imposing figure of professor Snape billowed towards them.</p><p>They were not exactly students, but not quite apprentices either. They had access to the entire library, studied mostly on their own, and met with a different professor for an hour each day for any necessary tutoring. Professors often requested their help in the classroom. Technically there were still bound by school rules such as curfew, but most professors tended to look the other way, knowing these students were not children anymore. They had lived through a war – fought in the war – and they deserved some leeway.</p><p>Snape looked at her, since Harry was conveniently still under his Cloak.</p><p>"Detention, Miss Granger. Tonight. 7 p.m. Wear protective clothing." He sneered.</p><p>Hermione just sighed as he strode away. "You'd think after helping nurse him back to health, then spending the next two months rebuilding the castle together he'd be a bit less of a bastard."</p><p>"Yeah - y'know, when we thought he was evil, his nastiness was expected. Now it just bothers me even more." Harry mused.</p><p>"I suppose after playing a role for twenty years, that persona comes naturally, even after it is no longer necessary. I do wonder who he could have been, had things played out differently. Perhaps I'm just too forgiving?"</p><p>Harry snorted something that sounded like "Umbridge!".</p>
<hr/><p>As usual, the Potions classroom was dimly lit and poorly heated. "<em>No wonder Snape is always wearing so many layers"</em>, she thought to herself as she entered, then corrected herself. "<em>Professor Snape, I mean.</em>"</p><p>With that thought, the man himself appeared. "You will be sorting the Potions store-room today. I do believe it has been sorely neglected for the past two years, and some of the supplies have expired. There are also a number of unlabelled potions. You will deal with them accordingly." At that, he sat down at his desk and started disfiguring essays with angry red quill marks. "What are you waiting for, the marching band to announce your arrival?"</p><p>Rolling her eyes, but still pleasantly surprised that she had been allowed to keep her wand, Hermione quickly made her way through the storage room. A quick <em>Evanesco</em> took care of the spoiled ingredients, and most of the unlabelled potions were simple first-year brews that she could identify in her sleep. She slapped a 'Babbling Beverage' label on a flask and reached back to grab the next one. She frowned. This potion was an unusual sparkling violet. She popped the cork and took a tentative sniff. It definitely contained Ashwinder eggs, but she couldn't quite discern the other ingredients. She made her way over to her professor, who was now fully engrossed in a giant grimoire.</p><p>"Professor? I can't seem to..."</p><p>She was cut off as Severus, nerves still highly strung from decades of espionage, torture and duelling, displayed his excellent reflexes with a silent Expelliarmus. Her wand flew out of her sleeve, loosening her grip on the potion flask. Hermione tried to snatch her wand back, but succeeded only in dropping the flask, which proceeded to plummet towards the corner of the desk, crack, and explode in a cloud of steam and broken glass - all over the two accidental combatants.</p><p>"Granger!" Severus hissed. "What, by Merlin's left testicle have you done?" He brushed bits of glass off his robes.</p><p>"I was just coming to ask for your help in identifying this potion!" Hermione retorted. "You didn't need to disarm me!"</p><p>Severus suddenly felt a warmth rush through his body, and a fog descend on his mind. He looked up in panic at Miss Granger, and froze. She was glorious. Fierce, with an earthy natural beauty. His arms ached to embrace her.</p><p>Hermione's pupils had dilated, and she was gazing at her professor as if he were a steak and she was starving. The miniscule portion of his mind not enraptured by her forced him to concentrate on what potion he had been exposed to. He gingerly picked up one of the glass shards, holding it close to his discerning nose.</p><p>"Amatorium Claritas. Slughorn, you bloody fool!" He bellowed. Hermione stroked his hand, unable to prevent herself from attempting to soothe him. He brought her hand to his lips and kissed it gently, before turning suddenly in a giant billow of robes and pacing quickly to the other side of the room. His eyes shut and a crease appeared on his forehead as he called forth every ounce of occlumency he could muster in his compromised condition.</p><p>"Miss Granger. What are the properties of Amatorium Claritas? Be thorough."</p><p>She stood up straight at his professorial tone, and started speaking automatically.</p><p>"Amatorium Claritas is a fourth-level restricted potion, meaning it is legal but requires permission from the Ministry to brew or purchase. Though what valid reason anyone could possibly have for obtaining a potion that is virtually <em>imperio</em> in a bottle... I mean, the whole idea of love potions in general..." She digressed, seemingly unable to control her tongue.</p><p>"Focus!" He snapped.</p><p>"Fine. The potion causes the drinker to obsess over the first person they see after imbibing it. They see said individual in the most favourable light possible. It has strong aphrodisiac qualities as well. The compulsion to be in physical contact with the target is almost overwhelming." At this, she stepped towards him.</p><p>"Be still!" He commanded. She stopped, castigating herself mentally. She was stronger than this.</p><p>"This potion is the one the previous King of Swaziland - Sobhuza II – used to keep his 125 wives in line. Continuous exposure over an extended amount of time can cause apathy and dull-wittedness. Though I suspect King Sobhuza would not have cared a whit if his wives were drooling idiots."</p><p>Severus relaxed at the melodious tone of her voice. Such a knowledgeable witch. Kind of heart, but with a good grasp of sarcasm and a ruthless streak that could almost match his own. Formidable. He made his way towards her...</p><p>"Sir!" Her exclamation broke him out of his trance. He had reached her, but with an enormous strength of will, prevented himself from reaching out to stroke her smooth face, or run his fingers through her spectacularly horrid vivacious hair.</p><p>The recitation of knowledge had cleared Hermione's head a bit, so she continued.</p><p>"The potion is effective for approximately ninety minutes when taken orally. I don't know the effects of an, er, spilled cauldron."</p><p>"Absorption through the skin should cause the potion to take effect more quickly, but be less potent and have a shorter duration. The effects are already weakening. I estimate we likely have another twenty minutes in which to restrain ourselves from molesting one another, then we should return to normal."</p><p>"Would it be easier if we were separated?" Hermione really didn't like this option, but it seemed like the right thing to say.</p><p>"Possibly. But there is no way I'm letting you out of my sight to sing my praises to your dimwitted Gryffindor friends. You 're staying here where I can keep an eye on you." <em>And gaze upon your radiant beauty,</em> he did not say, and barely allowed himself to think.</p><p>With sudden inspiration, he turned as if to apparate and strode quickly into the store room, exiting a minute later with a flask in hand.</p><p>"Here, Miss Granger. This won't counter the effects entirely, but it should distract us enough to make the next twenty minutes easier. He downed half, and handed it to her.</p><p>"Befuddlement Draught, sir? " Hermione asked bemusedly, then shrugged and quaffed the remainder.</p>
<hr/><p>Hermione had never had any desire to do drugs; she was a sensible girl. But she imagined this is what an LSD trip must feel like. The world shrunk and became a surreal bubble surrounding her.</p><p>"Your eyeballs are so round." She proclaimed. "And black. Like your robes. They make you look like the Count." She was imagining Dracula, but Severus interrupted her. "One! Mwa ha ha ha. Two!..." He pulled her into an impromptu salsa dance.</p><p>Hermione broke away and burst into hysterical giggles. "Y—You're a muppet! A Muggle Muppet. Mugglet." She stroked his shiny hair. "My shiny Mugglet." He took off his shoes and wiggled his toes. "My toes are moving." He mused.</p><p>Hermione replied, relatively soberly. " that's 'cause you are moving them. You are the master of your toes. A toes-shuns master." At that, they both burst into laughter.</p><p>"Poff – Profsh – "</p><p>"Name's Severus. Use that one. Nicer."</p><p>"Then call me Hermione."</p><p>"Hermy."</p><p>" You call me that and I"ll call you Sevvy." She was drawing faces which looked like they were in various stages of torture on his toenails. He swatted ineffectually at her and ended up stroking her nose.</p><p>"I'm sure my nose is very jealous of yours." He whispered to her, as if divulging a great secret.</p><p>Hermione laughed so hard she had to sit down on the floor. Severus simply smiled adoringly at her.</p>
<hr/><p>Twenty minutes later found them still giggling sporadically, sitting side by side against the wall and leaning into one another.</p><p>"I think the befuddlement draught is wearing off." Severus said, finally somewhat sober.</p><p>"I still think your fingers are beautiful."</p><p>He frowned at the apparent non-sequitur. "I mean the other potion can't have worn off yet. I'm still terribly attracted to you." She clarified.</p><p>He studied her face. "I'm no longer feeling any compulsions to attack your person, and my mind has cleared. However, the thought of kissing you is still invading my mind. Perhaps we ought to sleep on it." He noticed her eyes widen. "Separately."</p><p>"Agreed, sir. May I return tomorrow morning so that we can ensure we're back to normal?"</p><p>"Tomorrow is Saturday. You may come to my office after breakfast. You are dismissed. Goodnight, Miss Granger."</p><p>"'Night, Sir."</p>
<hr/><p>Hermione woke up the next morning in a very cheerful mood. The sun was out, birds were chirping, and colours seemed brighter than usual. The usual nightmares had not occurred – instead, he had dreamed of a smooth, silky voice talking and laughing with her, stroking her hair, making her feel...</p><p>Oh shite.</p><p>When she arrived at the door to Professor Snape's office, she faltered only a few seconds before gathering her courage and knocking.</p><p>"Enter." Oh, his voice sent shivers down her spine. As she walked through the door, he stood to meet her, his fathomless black eyes meeting hers.</p><p>"Miss Granger. Has your situation... remedied itself?"</p><p>"Not as such, sir. The intensity and lack of control is gone, but... "</p><p>"I must apologize for my behaviour yesterday. I had not anticipated the reaction the Amatorium Claritas would have on the Befuddlement Draught. While the latter did serve its purpose, it did rather... intoxicate us."</p><p>Hermione snorted. If she could figure out how to record memories in a Pensieve, she'd have some great blackmail material. Severus Snape mimicking a muggle children's television character? Priceless. "Are you fully recovered, then?"</p><p>He paused. "As you say, the intensity and lack of control is no longer an issue. However, the ... attraction ... has not abated. You are my student , and this feeling is potion-induced. It is an untenable situation. We must inform the Headmistress, then perhaps Madam Pomfrey or St. Mungo's can have a cure prepared. I do not trust myself in creating one as I would undoubtedly sabotage myself."</p><p>Hermione's heart sank, even as she intellectually agreed. "Would you kiss me, once, before we go?"</p><p>Severus looked longingly at her lips before he caught himself. "I will not, Hermione. You will hate me again as you did before, once you are in your right mind, and I could not bear it."</p><p>Hermione nodded then turned away, blinking rapidly. She did not bother to correct him.</p>
<hr/><p>Headmistress McGonagall looked from her Potions professor to her prized student. "So you are saying that this Amatorium Claritas has failed to wear off, and you would like to be excused for the next week to seek medical help?" Severus gave a curt nod. Minerva sighed. "Severus, I can give you two days. After that, I'm sure Poppy will suffice, once she has consulted with the Healers at St. Mungo's. Hermione, you could take your NEWTs at any time, so you can have as long as you need.</p><p>A cough sounded from the opposite wall.</p><p>"May I help you, Albus?" Minerva sounded resigned.</p><p>The portrait twinkled. "Hermione, when do you think you'll be ready for your NEWTs?"</p><p>"I'll need three more weeks to finish revising the seventh-year curriculum, then I should be confident enough to give them a go. Why do you ask, Headmaster?"</p><p>"No reason, no reason." He twinkled. "Just promise me that you'll come see me once you're done. And bring Severus along. We should all have a chat, I think."</p><p>Hermione only nodded once.</p>
<hr/><p>Severus watched as the nine eighth-year students filed out of his classroom, then rested his head on his desk. Miss Granger – Hermione – had been the epitome of a dutiful and respectful student, but he could see in her posture, in the sadness and longing of her eyes when she regarded him – that she had no more been cured than he had. The myriads of potions they had downed at St. Mungo's had effected absolutely no change. Madam Pomfrey had continued to monitor them both, and neither displayed any additional effects, so she had eventually declared them both healthy and shooed them away. They both took care to avoid one another except when necessary, and his heart felt as if it were shrivelling up from lack of contact. He had experienced enough unrequited love for one lifetime – not that this was unrequited, exactly, but potion-induced was even worse in a way. He sighed, and turned to his marking.</p>
<hr/><p>Hermione mentally reviewed her answers for the last test she had taken. She was quite confident she had managed at least an 'E', but...</p><p>She barely avoided running into a tall, dark figure.</p><p>"Professor!"</p><p>"Miss Granger. I understand are taking your exams?"</p><p>She nodded. "Yes, sir. I just had Arithmancy. It was the final one."</p><p>"Then congratulations are in order." His mouth twitched at the corner. She smiled back. "Sir, I believe Headmaster Dumbledore wished us to speak with his portrait, once my exams were done. Would you like to accompany me?"</p><p>"I am available now, if you would like. And as I am no longer your professor, I suppose you may call me Severus even while not intoxicated."</p><p>"And Sevvy?"</p><p>"Only if you desire to experience my permanent tonsil-engorgement curse first hand."</p><p>"Understood. Severus."</p>
<hr/><p>"Severus. Hermione. How lovely to see you both!"</p><p>Severus grunted. "Headmaster, you wished to see us?"</p><p>"I understand Miss Granger has completed her NEWTs?"</p><p>"I have," Hermione replied. "...but why did you want to see us?"</p><p>She had a sneaking suspicion, but did not dare voice it aloud.</p><p>"I just have a few questions for both of you. Firstly, have either of you been unable to concentrate on your duties since the potion incident?" They both frowned, and shook their heads.</p><p>"No," Severus stated. "While my mind has been prone to... wandering... while idle, I have no difficulty concentrating."</p><p>"Have your interactions with others changed?"</p><p>"Not as far as I can tell. Except, of course, in relation to each other." Hermione replied. Severus just nodded.</p><p>"And the Healers have cleared you and given you all possible antidotes?"</p><p>They nodded.</p><p>"Did either of you harbour any feelings towards the other before the incident?"</p><p>Hermione blushed. "Not like that, sir! I admired the Professor's steadfastness and intellect, and perhaps wondered about what lay behind the Death Eater persona he has hidden behind for so long, but never... romantically."</p><p>Severus stared at her. "I was under the impression all the students hated me."</p><p>She looked sadly at him. "I never hated you. I was furious with you after ... " She sent a surreptitious glance towards the portrait. "... you know. I was frustrated with you when you denigrated us in class. But I knew you had other roles to play, that I wasn't privy to all the information. I never hated you." She reiterated.</p><p>Severus was taken aback, but the erstwhile Headmaster interrupted. "And you, Severus?"</p><p>"Miss Granger was an irritating little swot as a child, but she grew into a woman deserving of respect. Without her, the Boy-who-lived-to-be-a-pain-in-my-backside would never have made it to the Final Battle. I admired her courage and fire. But that is all!"</p><p>Albus smiled at him. "Well, mutual respect is a fine foundation. Sometimes love just needs a little push. Your potions accident was just that – a push. I'm quite confident that the effects wore off naturally within an hour of exposure. Everything since then has been quite real. Love cannot be produced artificially – these so-called love potions can only mimic an inferior mixture of lust and obsession. "</p><p>Hermione was frozen. She had suspected as much, but had not dared voice her hypothesis. Severus, on the other hand, denied the possibility vehemently.</p><p>"That is utterly and completely impossible, Albus."</p><p>"You don't think you could ever have come to love the most intelligent, courageous witch of the age?"</p><p>"Don't be deliberately obtuse. What self-respecting young woman could possibly want anything to do with a bitter old ugly ex-death eater?"</p><p>"I'm certain she can see past that facade, Severus."</p><p>"<em>She</em> is right here and can speak for herself, thank you very much. Now you –" she pointed at the portrait, "can stop being such an interfering old coot. And you –" she poked Severus in the chest, "can shut up and listen. You spent less than two years as a Death Eater, and suffered through the next seventeen years enduring torture and worse to atone for your sins. Without you we would most certainly have lost. You are a hero. You are one of the most intelligent men I have ever met. And I certainly don't think you're ugly. Perhaps not classically handsome, but you have a gravitas that many would envy. "</p><p>The portrait of Albus Dumbledore smiled widely.</p><p>She turned towards the door, looking back only once. "Now, we are both adults here. I am no longer a student. I'm willing to see where this leads, if you are."</p><p>"What, the brightest witch of her age, tied down to her greasy professor right after school?" He scoffed. "I was under the impression you had somewhat more lofty career plans!"</p><p>"Come now, Severus. That wasn't a proposal. But surely you have heard of owl post? Or even apparition? Wizarding University is not Azkaban."</p><p>He followed her out the door, walking away from the portrait without a word. "I may be amenable to correspondence." He said quietly, once the door was closed behind them. "But I will not hold you to anything. You are young, yet."</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at him. "We shall see." She was a tenacious Gryffindor. She would sway him, eventually.</p>
