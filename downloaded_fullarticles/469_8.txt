    <p>
  <span>He was beginning to lose hope. That happiness that had bloomed in his chest when he woke up had slowly started fade throughout the day. The excitement that seemed to fill in every fiber of his being was starting to darken. His eyes were shiny and bright when the day started. One could say the stars had decided to rest there, but by noon they had faded away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He tried to catch their attention. He’d gone up to Sirius first. He caught him in the hallway after he emerged from the restroom. The man had smiled at his Godson, but before he could have told the man about his exciting news, Sirius had started to talk about his Hogwarts years. Harry had smiled and nodded along. He would open his mouth between’s the man’s breath but when he started to talk he would be spoken over. After the third attempt at trying to explain why he was excited he stopped. He then just hummed at the other man not listening. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The second person he tried to talk to was Remus. He sat next to his professor from the year before at the dining room table. He was flipping through the print and moving pictures of the daily paper. When the paper was finally out of his hands, Harry leaned over to him ready to talk but was cut off. He was cut off by Tonks tripping into the room, seeing Remus, then pulling him away from Harry. Harry sighed frustrated before picking at the bread in front of him. He could feel someone watching him but he didn’t care. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Molly didn’t give him a chance to speak about anything other than school. When she finally seemed to be done questioning him about that, he felt maybe he could talk to her. Then a group of redheads came in and he was pushed against the wall. He grabbed a glass of orange juice and carefully slipped between the bodies of his friends. He slipped past Severus who had stopped in the hallway watching the loud children before turning and following Harry down the hall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He started to talk to Ron about it but once he found out it wasn’t about Quidditch he complained and changed the subject. This was before Harry could get to the good news. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Minerva had shown up shortly before lunch. She said hello but didn’t make any attempt at a conversation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now he was sitting next to Hermoine who was curled into a ball on the bed. He waited for her to pull her head from her chest before passing her a pain potion. Her hair had been pulled back into a messy and frizzy bun. She was pale and shook when she took the vial from her friend. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Half the lunch that he had brought her an hour before still sat on her white plate. She had eaten two slices of the apple and half the peanut butter sandwich. Molly had tried to argue about Harry taking food upstairs but he had slipped up when Ginny started to shout at Ron. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As I say every time,” He said while taking the empty vial from her fingers, “I wish I could take the pain away.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looked up to him with a smile and patted his cheek, “I know. It makes me happy knowing you care.” Her voice was quiet and laced with pain. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She dropped her hand and scooted closer to the wall so Harry could lay beside her. After he had gotten comfortable she looked at him sadly. “I’m sorry no one is listening. I know this is a big thing for you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I should be used to be invisible. I mean the Dursley’s did a great job at pretending that I was.” He watched as his friend’s face dropped. She was the only person that Harry had confided in about what happened in that house. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I really wish I could be there,” She told him wrapping an arm around his shoulders and pulling him towards her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’ll be there in spirit,” He said as she let go, “that’s more than I can say for anyone else.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“When do you have to be there?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They want the participants there at four. Doors open at six.” He looked at the clock on the nightstand. He had two hours until he had to leave. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The next hour and a half were spent talking with Hermonie about runes. He had thankfully changed his electives last minute before starting his third year, much to Ron’s annoyance. He was now taking Runes and Arithmancy with Hermoine. After the first week of taking the class, he was happy he decided to take it. He made easy friends with Susan Bones, Terry Boots, and Lily Moon. He even had a few friendly conversations with Daphne Greengrass. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He had changed before he decided to sneak out. He was wearing dress pants, dress shoes, a navy blue button shirt, and the ensemble were completed with a solid black tie. Thankfully Hermonie had some extra hair taming potions that he could borrow. He was on the staircase patting his pockets to make sure he had his wand and wallet when someone cleared their voice catching his attention. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His eyes snapped up to see his potion professor watching him with a raised eyebrow. “Going somewhere, Mr. Potter?” His deep voice drawled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” He said confidently. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Snape’s eyes looked him up and down, “I don’t think the Headmaster would be pleased to find out that you left the safety of this godforsaken house for a date.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry’s cheeks redden in embarrassment, “Um, it’s not a date.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What is so important that entails you leaving the safety of the wards?” Snape asked. When Harry hesitated the teacher attempted another approach. “Does it have to do with what you’ve tried to tell the other’s earlier?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry froze. So someone had noticed, he thought. He took a deep breath. He then looked straight into his Professors’ eyes. “Several pieces of my artwork have been selected to be featured in a charity exhibition in London.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He thought that the man would laugh. Ron had when he told his best friend of his hobby in his first year after the troll incident. Harry had shown him the tattered notebook that he kept in his bag. It was stained and bent but he was proud of it. He carried it around with him until it filled up with his ideas and shaky lines. He was so confident about the small book that he felt it safe to show his friend. Ron had taken one look at the pages filled with petals and plants and laughed. Harry had tucked it under his mattressed and cried that night after Ron told him he should draw more manly things like Dean. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He had become so self-conscious of his work then. He would stay in the furthest corner of the library and draw under candlelight until curfew. He had gotten a new book at this point, one with thick paper and was designed for art. It was one of these nights that Hermoine had found him. He didn’t notice until she exclaimed at his fern her was drawing. She had pulled his sketchbook to her body and traced every line with her eyes remarking about the detail. When she asked why he never showed her, he admitted at how Ron had reacted. She scoffed and told him true friends support each other's hobbies. She happily started a conversation about different artists as they walked back to the common room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Snape had stilled and tilted his head. He seemed to be looking at Harry like he’s never seen the teenager before. There was something in his eyes, a fondness? It blinked before straightening up and opening the front door motioning him out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sir?” Harry asked confused while moving onto the front steps. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It seems you’re going to go no matter what, I may as well make sure you’re safe.” The man quickly shut the door behind them. “How did you plan on getting there, exactly?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Knight bus,” Harry answered. He could have sworn he saw panic cross his professor’s face. It quickly smoothed away but his voice seemed a little tight when he acknowledged the mode of transportation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry told Snape that the could walk back when they got off and saw the green complexion. There was no protest from the man who had his hands resting on his knees and was breathing heavily. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They entered the Gallery from a backdoor. There was a man with a clipboard who seemed to know who Harry was. Snape asked the teen who he was and was rewarded with a shrug. It wasn’t until he walked through the back hall into the storage room that he saw a familiar face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello Robby,” Harry cheerfully called over several moving heads. The man with dirty blonde hair twisted on his feet until he found the source of the voice. When his eye caught Harry his smile widen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry!” Robby cheerfully called back while pushing past a girl who was covered in blue and green tattoos. Once the man with blue eyes managed to get to him, he clapped Harry on the back. “How exciting! I’m so proud of you!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry’s chest burst with pride. He could help the smile that filled his face. It wasn’t often that someone had told him they were proud, but yet here was Robby doing so with a smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Robby,” He caught the man’s attention from the redhead that bumped into him, “This is one of my professors at my school.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Robby turned and grasped the Potion’s professor hand and shook it firmly, “Robert Tin,” He said cheerfully, “Many just call me Robby,” He added after letting the hand drop. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Severus Snape,” the taller man replied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Snape. Snape,” He hummed quietly before snapping his fingers and pointed at the man, “My older brother had you as a teacher for about two years.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Snape raised his eyebrows and shot a quick look at Harry before turning back to the man, “Is this a-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No,” Robby stopped him. He had guessed where the conversation was going. “This is a non-magical event. My older brother, Mark, just happens to be a wizard.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I got in contact with Mark halfway through my first year and he introduced me to Robby. Mark helps me with my magical things while Robby helps with my muggle things.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And those things are?” Snape asked looking at Harry with a raised eyebrow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We should save this for later,” Robby said when a short blonde woman walked in. She called for everyone to overlook their work to make sure all the titles and framing was correct. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It didn’t take long for six to roll around have the gallery open. Once the glass doors to the front were opened, men and woman wearing expensive clothing and thick jewelry walked in. Many grabbed a flute of champagne on their way to an art piece. Some grabbed the little finger treats that were being thrust towards them by servers in ties and black aprons. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus had grabbed a flute and was walking around the gallery. The floors were polished concrete and the walls were a stark white. The only color came from the works mounted on the wall or sat on pedestals. He was walking around a colorful morphed sculpture of a man when he looked up and saw some artwork that belonged to Harry. The boy was standing to the side with a glass of water talking with an older gentleman who had white hear and wore a flashy three-piece suit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He walked up to the work, it was hung directly in the middle of the wall and took up over half of the space from the floor to ceiling. The piece itself was behind a glass frame and a white border that seemed to be slightly thicker on the bottom. He appeared to be looking at a skull that was sitting directly in the middle of a wooden table. Leafy vines that were covered in flowers were growing out of the skull and claiming the space around it. There were pieces of the skull that were broken where a vine had pushed through. The work was painted lightly with strong black outlines. Looking at the plaque he found that it was a watercolor and inked artwork. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I did this piece after the whole ordeal with Quirrell in the first year,” Harry said drawing the attention away from his artwork. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You did this at eleven?” Severus asked surprised. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Harry drawled, “The first draft I did when I was eleven. I just got into watercolors at the beginning of last year. I really felt connected to this one so I redid it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s well done,” Severus admitted. It was weird for him to compliment the child of his old school enemy but he did feel it was deserved. Then again this night was turning out to be quite enlightening for him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry beamed at the praise, “Thank you, Professor.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus wasn’t sure why that made things click in his head but they did. For the first time, Severus could honestly say he saw a genuine smile on the boy. The smiles that the boy gave after a quidditch game seemed forced and awkward. The ones that he wore when award points for reckless behavior were too wide and appeared more like a grimace in his mind. The smile he wore now? It reached his eyes. It lit up his face and seemed to come from his soul. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He didn’t want praise for things his father would likely do, he wanted praise for things he did. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After the viewing pieces were actioned off and each artist would declare the charity the profits were going to. Many went to places he wasn’t aware of, smaller charities that needed the help. Harry had declared that half of his profits were going to an organization that he had no idea were. After the small briefing of the charity, Severus deduced it was a research facility for woman’s health. He had declared that it was going to be donated in the name of Hermione Granger. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The second half of the profits had the man raise his eyebrows. It was a being directed to </span>
  <em>
    <span>St. Raphel’s Healers</span>
  </em>
  <span>. It was a place that he studied potions at for a brief period of time when he was getting his Mastery. It was a small center in France that focused mainly on werewolf health. Severus had created the wolfsbane potion there. Thinking back to the small place he decided that the donation would greatly help their research. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After the artwork was sold and Harry had picked up some supplies a framed piece of work from Robby that left the gallery through the front door. The decided that they would walk out of the city before apperating close to Grimmauld. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It meant a lot that you came,” Harry admitted. His fingers were curled tightly around the frame of his artwork. Harry had been excited about it when Robby placed the wrapped frame in the boy’s hands. Severus hadn’t seen the artwork and was quite curious about it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They lapped into silence for a few minutes before Severus cleared his throat catching Harry’s attention, “Would you like to hear some stories of your mother?” </span>
