    <p>Newts eyes bulge out when he opens the door to his townhouse to find her standing there. A suitcase at her feet. It’s raining hard outside around them but when his shock dissipates the woman in from of his is all he can focus on.</p><p>His blue eyes meet her dark brown ones and they communicate better then any words could.  The longing the past two weeks, being parted just after they seemed to be on the same page. The fear, as they heard of attack after attack. Two weeks of separation that seemed to be too much now.  All the love and feelings between them that had only been brought to light before they were pulled apart again.</p><p>For an unknowable amount of time, their eyes stayed locked. Newt somehow ends up stepping outside. Into the rain in front of her.</p><p>Tina breaks the silence with a small laugh. Wrapping her arms around him. After a second Newt takes the cue, wrapping his arms around her and settling his head on hers. Holding her back.</p><p>They stay like that till their hair is completely damp. When Newt pulls back, he considers doing something terribly brave. Catching Tina’s eyes, the ones that have entranced him for the longest time, makes his choice. Leaning forward to press his lips softly to hers.</p><p>Without a second thought, Tina returns the kiss. Happy to allow him to warm her from the cold rain still drizzling on them.</p>
