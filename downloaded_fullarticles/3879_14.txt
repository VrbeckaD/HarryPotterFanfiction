    <p>
  <span>Evelyn Jennifer Nigma was both excited and saddened at the thought of going back to School.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She went to a special school in Scotland which meant she was away for most of the year, only ever coming home during the holidays, this was all fine at first however recently she began to feel guilty for leaving.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Eva lived with her grandpa, but recently his health had begun declining and this made her feel guilty for leaving, although their neighbours visited daily and had reassured her that they would look after him whilst she was gone she still couldn’t help the guilt, no matter how many times they reminded her that he supported and her and wanted her to go the school. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She couldn’t help but feel bad for leaving him on his own, she knew he was lonely, he truly had been ever since he had lost his son. The neighbours often said that they didn’t want to think what would of happened to him, if he had never found her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>One evening, when she had less than a week to go, one of her neighbours invited them over for a ‘goodbye’ dinner. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Eh, who’s leaving then Jimmy?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I am Gramp’s.” Eva said smiling softly at her old man.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Again? You only just got here!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve been back for three months now. Besides I’ll be back for christmas before you even know it”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Christmas ey, didn’t realise they celebrated that at your school… so proud of you Jimmy, you’ve got your mothers brains that’s for sure…” Eva continued to smile as she listened to her grandpa trail off, though her eyes had turned sad. It was at time’s like this she wondered who he saw walking next to him, her or Jefferson. He named her after him. He used to call him Jimmy too.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Come on gramps, we don’t want to keep Mrs. Anderson waiting.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Eh I wouldn’t worry about it Jimmy, Gerald was just telling me how that woman needs to learn some patience, and remember you’re never too old to learn.” The man said laughing, oblivious to his companions flinch. Gerald Anderson was his best friend for many decades now, and often joked about his wife lovingly, he had passed away not to long ago.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sadly he would remember this fact during the visit, he’d then spend the rest of the night thinking about his losses, then his own when the time was to come, and just who would be there to take care of his little girl? Eva would be wondering the same.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The first of September finally rolled around, it didn’t seem like much time at all since saying goodbye to her grandpa and neighbours, next thing she knew she was walking to the great hall with her fellow Ravenclaw and best friend Evi at her side. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They had meet back in first year, during their potions lesson a girl from Hufflepuff had been causing trouble and when Professor Snape had to intervene the girl had said “Don’t blame me blame Evelyn!” At this both girls had stood up from opposite sides of the room called out in sync that “It was not!” Looked over at each other in shock, before laughing loudly at each other, needless to say they both had to serve detention and had been inseparable ever since. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They had shockingly also made friends with the girl from Hufflepuff.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oi! Evelyn, Evelyn, have you guys heard?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Speaking of..</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Both Evelyn’s stopped turning to look behind them as a mousy haired girl ran up to them, her yellow and black robes slightly rumpled from all the running.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hello Chrissy, it’s nice to see you too.” Evi said politely</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes Chrissy, it’s oh so nice to see you, I’ve definitely missed your voice.” Eva also said politely, a big smile on her face.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh shut up you two! Haven’t you heard the gossip?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No what gossip?” Evi asked with genuine curiosity, if it had Chrissy running around then it must be something important.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Harry Potter! He’s here coming to Hogwarts!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Some of the nearby students had turned to listen to the girls exclamation, turning to their own friends talking excitedly amongst themselves. Both Evelyn’s exchanged glances before turning and walking with their new companion into the great hall.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span> “Poor boy.” Evi said pityingly.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hopefully he’ll find real friends in whatever house he ends up in.” Eva said.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Chrissy looked at them both in confusion. “What are you two on about? He’s a hero of course he’s going to have friends!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No, he’s going to have people who ‘worship’ him and want to know all about how he defeated the dark lord, I’m sure they’ll be disappointed when they find out he doesn’t know how, because he was, you know, a baby… Who lost his parents by the way… It’s not something I’d want to be famous for.” Eva said, plonking herself down in her usual seat.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Wouldn’t he be used to that by now though?” Evi asked, sitting opposite Eva.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I dunno,” Eva began, twisting in her seat slightly so Chrissy was able to sit on her lap before she had to go to her table, “I’ve heard rumours that for his safety he was raised by muggles.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Chrissy hummed thoughtfully from her place on Eva’s lap, they normally had a good 20 minutes before the first years were due to come up and be sorted, so this left them with a good bit of time to speculate about the boy who lived and what house he would be in, the three girls decided to have a wager on just that.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Gryffindor.” Said both Chrissy and Evi in sync.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hmm… maybe Slytherin.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Slytherin?!” The two girls exclaimed before giggling. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I guess we’ll soon find out. I can hear them coming.” Chrissy said as she got up from Eva’s lap and ran over to sit with her housemates at the Hufflepuff table. True to her word the doors opened up and the scared faces of the new first years appeared. Eva chuckled as Evi began cooing at her cute they looked.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It wasn’t difficult to spot the Boy-who-lived, the other first years kept looking at him in awe, and as he nervously kept sweeping his hand over his bangs he ended up making the scar on his forehead visible, Eva couldn’t help but find herself morbidly curious about how and why the scar was shaped like a lightning bolt.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>As her thoughts trailed off to the kinds of curses that could leave a physical make on a person she almost missed it when said boy was about to be sorted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was perhaps one of the longest wait to be sorted in a while, she remembered her own was the same.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“GRYFFINDOR!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The hat finally cried out the houses-bar Slytherin-erupted into applause, the Gryffindor table even did a standing ovation.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“So Eva, you owe both me and Chrissy some chocolate honeycomb on are next visit to Hogsmeade.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She couldn’t help but groan in response. </span>
