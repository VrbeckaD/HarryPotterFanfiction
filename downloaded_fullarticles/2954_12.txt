          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Cissa! They're at it again! When I agreed to Draco dating Potter, I did not realize I would gain a zoo!" Lucius sputtered as he almost tripped over the black and white blur that wound between his legs.</p>
<p>Narcissa let out a short giggle. "Hush Lucius, they're having fun. You know how long it took Draco to accept his animagus form."</p>
<p>Lucius sighed. "Fine, but if they keep fighting over the last piece of chicken like this I'm going to put my foot down. They're scaring the house elves."</p>
<p>"I doubt it. I found the house elves giggling in the kitchen last time. I'm starting to think they feed them on purpose."</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, the house was suspiciously quiet. After searching the Malfoys finally found Harry and Draco sprawled over their bed, still in their animagus forms. Black cat Harry was draped across the rumpled blankets and silver ferret Draco had buried himself between the scattered pillows. Connecting their two mouths was that ridiculous piece of chicken.</p>
<p>"Aren't they adorable Lucius?"</p>
<p>"They wore themselves out fighting. You think they would have grown out of it by now."</p>
<p>"Like you Lucius?" Narcissa raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>Lucius huffed. "I got better."</p></div>
