    <p><i>Taste the whip, in love not given lightly</i><br/>
<i>Taste the whip, now plead for me</i><br/>
Velvet Underground, Venus in Furs (1967)</p><p>
I: Defiance
</p><p>
  <i>11 February 1962 </i>
</p><p>That stupid, traitorous Fawley—Hortensia should have known that dumb girl would grass on her. When Briana Fawley had joined the Witches’ Legion earlier this year, Hortensia had been suspicious of her for seemingly no reason. Now she knew why: Fawley was no good. Hortensia was angrier with herself for not going with her intuition. </p><p>Professor Slughorn clearly didn’t know what to do with the situation. He sat at his desk, across from the two girls, and rubbed his walrus mustache. “Well, thank you for telling me, Briana. You are excused. Hortensia, please remain seated.”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” said Fawley in her annoying wispy voice, rising from her seat. Hortensia gave her the strongest glare she could muster, but predictably, Fawley kept her ice-blue eyes cast downward as she left the room. </p><p>“I’m not in a good position right now, my dear,” Slughorn sighed as soon as the door closed behind her. “You’re one of my best students—that Draught of Peace was flawless! However, this ‘Witches’ Legion’ has kicked up quite a fuss. What was your motive for creating it?” </p><p>Hortensia cleared her throat, confidence growing. She could talk her way out of almost anything, especially to Slughorn, who was generally unwilling to punish Slytherin students. “You see, sir, I don’t agree with the restrictions on witches partaking in certain activities here at Hogwarts. Those who control them seem to think we are only here to catch the attention of wizards, but that’s not always the case. For example, many want to enter the Ministry, become Healers or even Aurors. But how can we, if the Dueling Club excludes all witches on principle, even those with more magical talent than the wizards?” </p><p>Slughorn nodded, reached over, and patted her hand. “Yes, I agree that it’s a bit unfair, my dear, but you realize that ganging up and tossing hexes at male students at random and sabotaging Quidditch practices are not effective in getting your point across?” </p><p>She scratched her neck and looked away, shifting uncomfortably. “We may have gotten a bit…carried away at times, but it succeeded in bringing about the general message, which is that we shall not be so easily dismissed.”</p><p>“I take it that you’re not planning to stop, then?”</p><p>“We will not hurt anyone else,” she quickly assured him. “I will no longer allow that. We never intended to do harm. We only wish for our voices to be heard loud and clear.”</p><p>“Well, you’ve succeeded in that,” Slughorn told her with a wry smile. “Perhaps we can start thinking about dismantling the witches’ group, eh?” </p><p>Although his suggestion was given gently, kindly, it incensed Hortensia all the same. She wanted to correct him, to tell him that it was called the Witches’ <i>Legion</i> and it was much more than just the silly group he clearly thought it was. However, he, like many of the other professors, often discounted it from the start and arguing wouldn’t change that. She settled on simply shaking her head. </p><p>Slughorn let out another sigh, this time with some voice in it. “You see, my dear, the problem is that other students, particularly our young wizards, are getting frustrated, and we need them in sound mind. Now with Leach in office, I’m afraid Hogwarts will be shifting to a more…forceful opposition of current regulations. We need our wizards in top shape.”</p><p>“But we wish to back Hogwarts up, too,” Hortensia protested, wringing her hands together. “Perhaps not in combat, but if you take our brothers, fathers, sons, and husbands away, whom do you expect will keep our society afloat? Witches will have to work and take on a wizard’s role while they defend, like they’ve done in Grindelwald’s war! Why not give us the tools to do so?”</p><p>“You’ve got to ask the Magical Education Department, my dear, not me!” he answered, slightly flustered now. “Write a letter to the Head, Abraxas Malfoy, maybe he’ll listen to you. But please, for the sake of Hogwarts, you must dismantle the group!”</p><p>She stared stone-faced at him, refusing to agree. As much as she wanted to avoid trouble, she could not agree to give up the Witches’ Legion. They were the forerunners of a national movement, she could feel it in her heart. </p><p>“Well, alright then,” said Slughorn dejectedly, rolling up the piece of parchment Fawley had given him. “I suppose I’ve got to bring you to the headmaster.”</p><p>Hortensia’s mouth dropped open before she blurted without thinking, “But he’ll expel me!” No one was taken to the headmaster unless it was for serious misconduct. Last year, Ferdinand Church had been sent for luring his nemesis, some other Gryffindor boy, into the Forbidden Forest in the middle of the night and had never returned. Of course, rumors were flying that the mysterious headmaster—who hadn’t been seen outside his office since 1957 after being appointed from Defense Against the Dark Arts professor—had murdered Church somehow and Vanished his remains. That was later squandered when Church’s younger sister, Halcyon, had revealed that he’d simply been expelled. </p><p>“Well, I’ll suggest that he not do so, as you’re doing well in lessons,” Slughorn replied, standing up and picking up the scroll, “but ultimately the decision is his. Come along.”</p><p>With a heavy sigh of her own, Hortensia rose, smoothed down her skirt and robes, and followed him out of the Potions classroom. </p><p>The Headmaster’s Tower was on the seventh floor, so she had plenty of time to ruminate over what her fate might be. If she was facing expulsion, she wasn’t sure how to recover from such a huge blow. Her parents wouldn’t be fussed—her mum would push her even more to find a wealthy pureblood boy to marry, and her father ran off in ’55. Hortensia, on the other hand, could think of nothing worse than being barred from education. How much would her family name pardon her?</p><p><i>Stupid Fawley</i>, she seethed silently, <i>and stupid me for assuming all witches are trustworthy by default, when a great lot of them are lying sneaks.</i> </p><p>Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, they arrived at the great stone gargoyle guarding the office. Slughorn leaned in and mumbled the password in barely above a whisper, but Hortensia managed to catch it: “Merope.” </p><p><i>Who on Earth is Merope?</i> She wondered, but there was no time to dwell; the gargoyle moved aside and Slughorn was guiding her to step on the moving spiral staircase. It took the pair to a small platform, where they faced huge oak double-doors. Slughorn rapped on the left one twice. </p><p>“Enter,” a low voice called from inside. </p><p>The doors swung open and they entered a grand circular room adored with many portraits of old wizards, half of them dozing since it was nearing ten o’clock at night. Hortensia recognized one as the previous headmaster Armando Dippet. His nightcap was sliding down his face, a spot of drool leaking from his gaping mouth. On an elaborate golden shelf in the center of all the portraits was the Sorting Hat, also snoozing. </p><p>Slughorn nudged her to take a seat, so she sat down on one of the velvet-coated chairs in front of the enormous desk and assumed the position of repentant student: rigid posture, hands folded in lap, eyes on knees pressed together. </p><p>Meanwhile, she was trying to catch a peek at Headmaster Riddle, who she had never seen before in her life. He’d been appointed headmaster the same year as Hortensia’s first at Hogwarts, so she hadn’t taken a Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson under his instruction like the sixth and seventh-years had. He did not give speeches at the ceremonies, leaving it up to Slughorn and Septima Vector, Head of Ravenclaw, along with the Sortings. In fact, he never stepped foot in the Great Hall, which the younger ones never saw as odd as the older ones. According to them, he had been a very strict professor. </p><p>“I’m sorry to bother you at this late hour, Tom,” Slughorn was saying, standing behind Hortensia as if she was about make a run for it. “But I’ve just been alerted that Miss Travers here is the ringleader of this witches’ group that’s been causing a bit of mayhem lately.” </p><p>Hortensia wrinkled her nose at the word “ringleader,” as if he was implying that she was running a circus. </p><p>“I do not recommend expulsion, as her marks and magical ability are above average for a fifth-year, but perhaps you could…er…” He trailed off, hesitant to give input to the headmaster, which was a bit odd considering he’d once been Riddle’s professor. Slughorn often praised him tremendously, claiming he was the most brilliant wizard of the 20th century.</p><p>However, the 20th century was only a little over halfway through, so there was likely an underlying cause to Slughorn’s reverence to the headmaster. That was of little concern to Hortensia as long as he didn’t expel her. She closed her eyes, wishing the next few minutes away, that she was back in her dormitory and the whole thing was over. </p><p>“The evidence is this speech here,” Slughorn continued. “It’s cleverly written and she makes a fair point, but I’m simply worried she’ll incite a riot.”</p><p>Out of her peripheral vision, Hortensia saw a white, long-fingered hand extending outward. Slughorn placed the scroll in the hand and a second later, she heard Riddle opening it. She wondered what he was thinking as he read the words scrawled in her script, the next speech:</p><p>
  <i>Ladies of Hogwarts! Let us meet in the Come and Go Room at seven o’clock in the evening of Friday next, 18 February, for our own defense lessons! Not against the Dark Arts, no, but rather these boys who think they can decide our fates at will! Physical aggression and emotional manipulation will no longer be tolerated by the strong, capable witches at Hogwarts! This will be henceforth treated as not a debate but the final verdict! </i>
</p><p>“You wrote this, Miss Travers?” </p><p>Feeling his eyes burning into the top of her head, Hortensia raised her eyes and finally looked at the headmaster full-on. She was surprised to see how young he was—mid-thirties, perhaps. She’d seen his Special Services Award he’d earned as a student in 1943, but since maths was not her strong suit, 1943 seemed like ages ago. </p><p>Riddle’s skin was very pale, giving him a slightly withdrawn appearance, and his dark eyes had an odd, reddish tint, but overall, he was supremely attractive. Despite his age, he had a clear aura of command, a tight hold on himself and all of Hogwarts. He certainly didn’t look like someone named Tom. His gaze was piecing through her, as if he was inspecting the dark recesses of her mind. </p><p>“Yes, sir.” Hortensia’s voice, raspy from non-use, sounded terrible. </p><p>He stared at her for at least another few minutes, Slughorn shifting awkwardly behind her. She lowered her eyes to her knees again, unable to take the intensity. </p><p>“Surely you see the danger in teaching a bunch of emotionally-charged young witches jinxes and hexes to use against other students, Miss Travers?” </p><p>Hortensia shook her head defiantly, although she didn’t dare look up.</p><p>“She gave me the same answer when I proposed a similar question,” Slughorn offered. </p><p>The headmaster let out a breath and said to him, “You may leave, Horace. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I will take care of it now.”</p><p>“No problem at all, Tom. Goodnight.” </p><p>Hortensia turned to look at Slughorn wistfully, wishing she could follow him out.</p><p><i>“Incendio,”</i> Riddle said casually, pointing his bone-white wand at the parchment in front of him. She watched as the flames turned it into ash, fists clenching. Then she blinked and it was gone, as if nothing had been there. </p><p>“I’m going to tell you kindly once more,” he said quietly, and she could hear a slight trace of suppressed fury. “Cease this ridiculous nonsense and return to your proper place as pureblood witch, or suffer the consequence. Is that clear, Miss Travers?” </p><p>“That depends on what the consequence entails, sir,” she replied in a steady, calm tone despite her shaking hands. </p><p>Riddle stared at her in disbelief. It was both frightening and satisfying. “You dare challenge me, little girl?”</p><p>She gave him her best good-girl smile and shook her head. “Not at all, sir. I’m merely asking for clarification.”</p><p>“It would be irrelevant if you’d just do as your told,” he snapped, but then he switched tones and gave her his own charming smile.  “Let’s make an agreement. You will cease the group, and I will let you go without punishment. Not even a single point from Slytherin since I’m partial to the House.”</p><p>Hortensia knew he had been a Slytherin as a student. Prefect, Head Boy, model wizard, according to Slughorn. Supposedly, his mother was a direct descendant of Salazar Slytherin. </p><p>Hortensia also knew that if he was going to expel her, he would have done so by now. He didn’t want to expel her, she realized, possibly because of her own pure, Slytherin-descended bloodline. Students from the Sacred 28 families had quite special status at Hogwarts and, in turn, the Ministry of Magic. Even after the mayhem resulting from the Legion, she was still an asset to the school. </p><p>Ever so stubborn, she shook her head once more. “I cannot agree, sir. I shall suffer the consequence.”</p><p>They held eye contact for another minute, him glaring and her trying with all her might not to look away. <i>We shall not be dismissed so easily,</i> she told herself, the Legion’s mantra.</p><p>Abruptly, the headmaster stood and she flinched before she could control herself. “Very well, then,” he said quietly, dangerously. “Please place your wand on the desk, Miss Travers.” He was very tall, she realized. His seat at the desk had deceived her.</p><p>“W—which spell will you be using, sir?” she asked, slowly sliding her wand out of her robes. </p><p>He smiled down at her, but it was more condescending than anything else. “Silly girl, if you followed the rules at Hogwarts, you would know professors are forbidden to punish students with magic. I’ll not risk my position for your insolence. Now place your wand on the desk.” </p><p>She obeyed, catching herself before slamming it down, wondering just how on Earth did a student face punishment if not expulsion, House points deduction, or any type of magic. There were also lines and detention, but Hortensia wasn’t counting on either of those two. </p><p> “Now follow me. Disobey any command I give henceforth, and you will be expelled. Is that clear?”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” she replied, slightly distracted. What in Merlin’s name was he planning on doing without magic?</p><p>He turned, took a few steps away from the desk, and opened a narrow door she hadn’t noticed before. The portraits that were awake were eyeing him curiously, as if this was the first time they’d seen this, which awakened tiny alarm bells in Hortensia’s head. The panic started when she entered the room.</p><p>Her eyes had to adjust to the darkness—there was only one window, and it was covered in a thick curtain. On the far side of the room, there was wardrobe and a four-poster bed like the ones in the dormitories, except double the size and covered in a dark green quilt. Next to the bed was a fireplace, empty, with three lit candles on the mantel, casting the tiny room in a golden yellow glow.  The small desk underneath the window was covered in parchment and thick books with yellow pages. They scented the room like the Hogwarts Library, which would have been calming if Hortensia wasn’t frantically wondering what she was doing in there. </p><p>The door slammed shut behind her and Riddle cast a nonverbal spell that shot bright red light at it. The light branched out, covering the circular walls with grid-like beams. It burned her eyes and she covered them with her palms, ducking her head. </p><p>A cold hand wrapped around her wrist and pulled her forward. Her eyes snapped open and through the fizzling red spots in front of her, she made out a large, high-backed leather armchair in the corner between the fireplace and door, where the headmaster seemed to be leading her. </p><p>He sat on the chair, knees about a foot apart, and stared up at her, still clutching her wrist. She hadn’t the slightest clue what was going on or what to do. Then he yanked her wrist and kicked out her leg from under her. </p><p>“Augh!” She tripped, trying desperately to catch her balance, but he grabbed both of her arms and pulled over his knees. She turned her head just in time to avoid her face smashing into the arm of the chair. He held her around the waist to keep her from rolling off. </p><p>“Ah, there we are,” Riddle said calmly, as if there wasn’t a 16-year-old girl draped over his lap, ready to have a panic episode. <i>This can’t be happening,</i> Hortensia thought desperately. <i>I’m having a bizarre, convoluted dream and I shall wake up now…NOW! </i></p><p>She did not. Her arms were being pulled behind her, wrists pinned together. Her breathing was labored and her eyes were wide in anticipation, even though the extent of her view was the dark wooden floor, a bedpost, the tail end of Riddle’s robes, and a shiny loafer. </p><p>“So quiet you are now,” he teased, holding her still by her wrists. “Are you finally learning your lesson, Hortensia? See, hardly anyone possesses such great magical power like I do, but there a couple of things handled better the muggle way. Not that I expect you to have encountered this in your privileged upbringing, but no matter, I am ever so glad to punish you properly. <i>Accio belt!”</i>  </p><p>To Hortensia’s horror, the wardrobe door swung open and a black leather belt flew toward them. Riddle caught it in the air and released her arms, which had gone entirely numb. She felt something—the belt, presumably—slide across her back as it was being folded, and then…</p><p>Cold fingertips were sliding up her inner thigh, taking her robes and skirt with them. Slowly, silently, the headmaster was running his hand up her leg, eliciting chills and goosebumps across her whole body. As soon as it met her knickers, he pulled up her robes and skirt to reveal them. Before she could form a single thought, he’d taken the belt and brought it swiftly down upon her backside. </p><p>SMACK! </p><p>“Augh!” Hortensia yelled in anguish. SMACK! Jolts of white-hot pain were shooting through her legs and up her spine as welts rose on the soft, sensitive skin. </p><p>Again and again he whipped her as tears poured out of her eyes and she yelped in agony. She tried to squirm away, but he had one hand on her throat, pulling her taut, while the other dropped the belt onto the floor. Against her stomach, something she hadn’t felt before: the erection between his legs. </p><p>“Oh, Merlin!” she cried, breaths ragged and cheeks streaked with tears. “Professor, <i>please</i>!” </p><p>“More?” he chuckled close to her ear, running his fingers over the welts on her rear, causing them to sting even worse. </p><p>“No! Please, it hurts!”</p><p>He responded by smacking her bottom hard as she let out a roar of pain. He was laughing, she realized, at her anguish. He was enjoying it. </p><p>“I hate you,” she hissed before she knew what she was saying. </p><p>Riddle clutched her jaw, pulling her closer. “That’s a pity, darling, because I’m rather fond of you.”</p><p>His other hand was caressing her now, providing cool relief to her red, swollen skin. Despite her anger and fear, Hortensia felt her muscles relaxing, her eyes closing. Gently in sharp contrast to his previous handling of her, he released her throat, stroking her hair away from her neck. Her cheek rested against the leather of the armchair as her body sagged, exhausted. </p><p>Meanwhile, he had slipped his thumb slowly between her skin and knickers, pulling them down. Her mind was in uproar—did she dislike it, was she averse to it? Her stillness was a telling clue. </p><p>Her knickers slid over her rear and down her thighs until she was exposed to him. For one aching moment, he didn’t touch her at all except for the hand resting in her hair. Then she felt cold fingertips right <i>there</i>, on her entrance, which was starting to grow wet with desire. </p><p><i>This is wrong,</i> her mind was screaming. <i>He shouldn’t be touching you in this manner!</i> However, her body was singing a different tune: her back arched and her hips tilted, trying to get her closer to his touch. </p><p>“Do you hate me now, darling?” he asked softly, “or have you changed your mind?” Very faintly, he dragged his fingertips back and forth over her entrance.</p><p>“No, sir,” she whispered, her breath quickening again but this time with heavy arousal. </p><p>“Speak up, Hortensia,” he commanded, bunching her hair into his fist and pulling her head away from the chair. </p><p>“No, I don’t hate you, sir,” she choked out, suppressing a moan as he lightly rubbed her, sending tingles of pleasure all the way down to her toes. </p><p>“Good.” Without further ado, he plunged two fingers inside of her, his knuckles slamming into the slick surrounding skin. </p><p>Hortensia scrunched up her face and let out a howl as she felt a painful, snapping sensation inside. No one had ever touched her that way. The furthest she’d gotten was letting Marcus Rosier squeeze her breasts while rubbing his clothed erection against her. It hadn’t been satisfying in the least, but he’d paid her the ten galleons and kept quiet about it as promised. </p><p>Riddle paid no attention to her reaction, sliding his fingers in and out as little cries escaped from the pit of her throat. As soon as it morphed from excruciating pain to building pleasure, he pulled his hand away. </p><p>She couldn’t turn her head to see what he was doing. Not having his hands on her was unbearable, even though he still had a hold on her hair. Then he answered her question another second later: “You taste so sweet. You’ve not been punished enough, have you?”</p><p>“No, sir,” she breathed, wishing for him to continue touching her. He did, but not in the way she anticipated. Without warning, he gave her a hard shove and she slid off his lap, crashing to the floor. </p><p>“Ouch!” she cried, frowning in confusion as she sat straight, hastily pulled her knickers up, and rubbed her hip, which had slammed the hardest against the wood. </p><p>Riddle was unconcerned, watching her intently. His face was blank, but she could see a gleam of lust in his eyes. “Rise, Miss Travers, and remove your robes, blouse, and skirt.”</p><p>Hortensia was not ashamed of her body. On the contrary, she was proud of her appearance, knowing many a wizard found her attractive. Tall, with a dancer’s figure, smooth auburn hair, and large dark eyes, she was either an instant enemy of other girls or they gravitated toward her. This was an advantage; the Legion may not have gotten so far if she’d been plain. Her appearance and blood status were tools to garner attention easily. </p><p>That did not mean, however, that she would strip down in front of a man more than twice her age, the <i>headmaster of Hogwarts</i> no less. This madness needed to end. Sitting on the floor, looking up at him, she shook her head. </p><p>His lips tightened as he raised his dark eyebrows—she had angered him again. “Insolent brat. I said <i>rise.</i>” </p><p>“I will not, sir,” Hortensia challenged. At this point, she was sure she’d be expelled after all of this, simply for being a risk. If anyone grew suspicious of the headmaster’s “punishment,” he would likely be looked upon unfavorably if not outright sacked. </p><p>He did not threaten to expel her. Instead, he stood, reached down, grabbed another fistful of her hair, and yanked her up, forcing her to stand. Eyes stinging with tears again, she gasped as he pushed her face-first against the wall, his fist pulling her hair at the root. A tiny whimper escaped as he pressed into her from behind, pinning her to the cold stone wall. </p><p>Since he was several inches taller, his mouth didn’t quite match up to her ear, so he hissed the words in her hair. “You dare defy me, you insubordinate little bitch? You’d better think twice about that.”</p><p>Something poked her in the cheek. She cast her eyes down and saw that he was pointing his wand at her. “I thought punishing students with magic was forbidden at Hogwarts, sir?” she blurted recklessly. </p><p>“You know what else is forbidden at Hogwarts?” he asked in a pleasant tone, pushing her legs open with his knee and lifting it until it fit snugly against her knickers. “Trying to seduce the headmaster to get out of trouble. Oh yes, the Magical Education Department won’t look so fondly on that, my dear. Who will they believe? He who rules this entire castle or a filthy little slag with a history of causing ruckus?” </p><p>“My family is more respected…” Hortensia knew she should just shut up, but she wasn’t going down without a fight.</p><p>“Is that so?” Riddle snickered, rubbing his leg slowly back and forth against the heated, damp spot between her legs. “Which one of them will fight on your behalf? The father who left you or the mother who wishes to sell you off to the highest bidder?”</p><p>“I hate you, Professor Riddle,” she replied viciously, but she couldn’t keep herself from rocking slightly against his leg as he chuckled in her hair, knowing he’d gotten her. She felt the bulge in his trousers, this time on her raw, aching backside. Suddenly he released her, and she quickly turned to face him. </p><p>He pointed his wand between her eyes. “Would you like to see what will happen if you disobey me again?” </p><p>“No, sir.” </p><p>He flashed her a sardonic smile as he took a seat back in the armchair. “Good girl, you’re finally learning. Now remove your robes, skirt, and blouse.” With a lazy flick of his wand, he conjured a bottle of firewhiskey and a glass filled with ice. “Take your time, darling. I’ve got all night.”</p><p>Wondering vaguely what time it was and kicking herself for forgetting to put her watch back on after her bath, Hortensia unbuttoned her blouse and pulled it off, along with her skirt. Standing uncomfortably in her bra, knickers, knee-high socks, and Mary Janes, she held her clothes neatly in her arms, unsure what to do with them since her mother had beat it into her to always hang them immediately after undressing. </p><p>Riddle took his time assessing her, looking her up and down as he sipped his drink. “Come here,” he told her, setting the glass down on the small table between the chair and fireplace. </p><p>When she was standing toe-to-toe in front of him, he took the clothes out of her arms and tossed them carelessly over the arm of the chair. They fell into a heap in front of the door, and now Hortensia was completely exposed, her arms hanging stiffly at her sides. </p><p>He reached up, slid his index finger under her bra, and snapped it against her chest. “This too. Take it off.”</p><p>A blush was starting to bloom on her cheeks as she reached behind her and unhooked the bra. He snatched it away and tossed it in the general direction of her other clothes before seizing her hips and pulling her on his lap. She managed to throw her palms out against his chest just in time, narrowly avoiding a collision. </p><p>Her bare breasts were inches away from his face, but that seemed to be the goal, that and grabbing her bottom and rocking her roughly back and forth over his erection. It shouldn’t have felt so good; she didn’t want this, but damn, it felt <i>wonderful</i> and she couldn’t stop, especially when he wrapped her knickers around his fist. They dug painfully into her battered skin, but they were also hitting that spot, the little pink nub Hortensia spent many a night playing with in her dorm after the other girls had fallen asleep. </p><p>Amid her heavy breaths was the sound of fabric ripping and the pressure on her skin was released. Letting go of the knickers, he held her breast, sucking on the sensitive flesh, leaving crescents of dark purple against milky-white. Her head was tilting back…until a sharp pain jolted her out of the trance. </p><p>“Relax, sweetheart,” he said softly, straightening up and burying his face into her neck, his hand on her back, pulling her closer. His breath tickled the spot below her ear, curling her fingers and toes as his long fingers slid deeper inside of her. The pad of his thumb was pressed against the sweet spot, gently stroking it. </p><p><i>“Ohhh,”</i> she gasped as the pain dissipated, replaced by intense, unyielding pleasure. All else—the time, her clothes, this insane circumstance—was unimportant as a deep, hot pressure built up inside of her. “Oh, Professor!”</p><p>“Yes, you like that, don’t you, you naughty little thing?” Riddle was growling into her neck. “Come on, pretty girl, come for me…”</p><p>A minute later, her muscles clenched against his fingers as she threw her head back and let out a howl. Unlike the last one, this was a howl of glorious release. “Oh, Professor,” she sighed, her voice hoarse. Stars were dancing in front of her eyes and her ears were ringing. </p><p>He raised his fluid-covered fingers to his mouth and briefly ran them through his parted lips. Hortensia watched until she collapsed against him before she could restrain herself, burying her face into the thick forest of his dark wavy hair. He simply lifted her up and threw her on the bed like a rag doll. </p><p>“Lie on your back with your legs open,” he commanded as the mattress creaked underneath her. “Spread yourself for me. That’s it, slut. Give yourself to me.”</p><p>As her fingers pulled her slick folds apart, she lifted her head slightly and saw that he’d unbuttoned his trousers to stroke himself. Before she could catch a glimpse of it, he climbed on top of her, pinned her wrists to the bed, and drove himself into her. </p><p>She thought she was prepared, yet another wave of pain spread through her. Thankfully, it didn’t last long. Now Riddle was the one breathing heavily as he thrust into her. His mouth met hers, and she tasted her own fluid and alcohol on his tongue, a bittersweet combination. </p><p>“Oh, please don’t stop!” she cried, forcing her eyes to stay open and meet his. Oddly, the eye contact prompted him to thrust faster and harder. </p><p>“You like it, darling? Yes? Hortensia…”</p><p>“Yes! Oh, yes!” Wonderful, colorful spots were bouncing in front of her eyes, the ringing starting back up…the pressure was building…</p><p>Unfortunately, he finished before she could have a second orgasm, but she was so thrilled with the first that it hardly mattered. He lay on top of her for a moment, catching his breath, before pulling out. With one hand adjusting his trousers, he spread her apart with the other, watching the hot liquid dripping out. Then he abruptly stood straight and turned away. She took the opportunity to trot across the room and grab her clothes. </p><p>His fluid was leaking down her legs and since her knickers were torn, she hadn’t a barrier to absorb it. Squeezing her slippery inner thighs together, she hurriedly dressed and picked up her knickers with the intention of mending them as soon as her wand was back in her custody. However, Riddle had other plans. </p><p>“Those are mine now,” he told her, snatching them out of her hand and tossing them on the armchair. “Stay there for a moment.” He pointed his wand at the door and the red grids appeared for a moment before dissipating. </p><p>Wobbly from exhaustion, Hortensia stood in place and watched him poke his head into the office, where snoring of various octaves filled the air. Riddle waved a hand, beckoning her forward. </p><p>While the office still had the same ray of moonlight flooding through the window, it seemed much different now, peaceful and less intimidating. Everyone in the portraits had nightcaps on, wrapped in quilted cocoons. One even had on a pair of earmuffs. Hortensia couldn’t blame him; the headmaster clearly hadn’t bothered to light a fire in a while. The room was as cold as outside. </p><p>He held the oak door open as she tiptoed through it. Once it was closed again, they stood on the platform, simply looking at each other. The vast circular window above the staircase acted as a spotlight, casting them in shadow, though she could see that he was studying her, not with a lewd expression but one of ambivalence. She wondered what he was thinking of so intently. </p><p>“I’d rather not have to explain why I’ve kept you in my office until 1:32 in the morning,” Riddle said at last, “so you are to conjure the Room of Requirement and spend the remainder of the night there.”</p><p>“The Room…?”</p><p>“The Come and Go Room,” he clarified impatiently. “Where you hold those absurd little meetings. Conjure a bedroom and go to sleep. Return to your dormitory at a reasonable hour.”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” she replied, wondering if she should take a step toward the staircase. </p><p>He raised his wand, causing her to flinch terribly. Instead of pointing it at her and uttering an incantation, however, he tapped the top of her head twice. A chilly, tingling sensation spread through her skull, as if he was pouring a glass of cold water over her head. </p><p>“It’s a Disillusionment Charm,” he explained. “It will wear off in less than an hour. However, just because no one can see you doesn’t mean they can’t hear you, so you must move as quietly as possible. If that clear?”</p><p>Hortensia nodded, but then she remembered that he couldn’t see her either. She was quite grateful to be invisible, as she must’ve looked a complete mess. “Yes, sir,” she whispered. </p><p>“You are dismissed.”</p><p>She was at the bottom of the stairwell, her hand reaching for the door to the gargoyle, when he spoke again. “Miss Travers…am I correct in assuming I won’t be hearing about these ridiculous Legion meetings any longer?” </p><p>She smirked, her face tilted up and staring boldly into his eyes, jaw set. He was gazing back at her, and for an absurd moment it felt like he <i>could</i> see her, for he appeared to be staring right into her eyes. Not only seeing her face but reading her thoughts. The smug look dropped from her face as she silently scolded herself for being paranoid. </p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>“Very well,” Riddle said before turning and opening the door to his office. She climbed over the sleeping gargoyle and crept down the corridor, trying to get out of the Headmaster’s Tower as soon and silently as possible. </p><p>Once in the seventh-floor corridor, the journey was considerably less daunting, as the Come and Go Room was right around the corner. The residual fear and anxiety from the ordeal lifted slightly, and immediately her mind flooded with racing thoughts and questions, the primary being what in hell had just transpired? Did the headmaster punish all the students in that manner? That answer was a no—firstly, she had never heard of a witch in all five years of Hogwarts who’d been sent to his office. Also, she recalled the confused faces in the portrait when he’d led her away. </p><p>Hortensia was conflicted: had she enjoyed his brutal treatment? Her logical, prideful side was saying of course not, but that was overruled by the tingling between her legs as she replayed the memory. </p><p>On the subject of memory, she had thought Riddle would modify hers to squash any risk of anyone finding out, but she realized as she reached the corridor of the Come and Go Room that he already knew she would never speak of it. No one could <i>ever</i> find out that Hortensia Travers, proud and strong leader of the Witches’ Legion, had gotten whipped and berated by Headmaster Riddle, and <i>enjoyed</i> it. </p><p>Yes, she had thoroughly enjoyed it. She wasn’t sure at first, but now that she’d gotten a moment to think about it, she had wanted it from beginning to end. </p><p>After pacing three times, repeating in her head <i>I need a single bedroom</i>, the door to the Come and Go Room appeared, leading to a tiny room with a bed and desk identical to those in the dormitories. The bed was tantalizingly inviting, and she longed to collapse upon it and close her eyes, but there were too many things bouncing around her head. She had to write a particular one out before it flew away from her for good. </p><p>She sat at the desk, where a pot of ink, quill, and parchment were waiting for her. Aches were blossoming from her sore, sticky legs and rear, but she ignored it all, dipping the quill in the ink and writing furiously: </p><p>
  <i>Ladies of Hogwarts! Let us meet in the fourth floor of the Astronomy Tower at ten o’clock in the evening of Friday next…</i>
</p><p>Yes, Riddle had been correct in assuming he wouldn’t find out about her ridiculous Legion meetings, because Hortensia was going to trim them down of untrustworthy members and bury them further in secrecy. Under no circumstance was she going to cease the Witches’ Legion, not when it brought her so much power and potential to bring change. </p><p>And if she was caught and sent to the headmaster again, well, she would have to suffer the consequence. She wasn’t exactly opposed to this. In fact, to be perfectly honest, she was looking forward to it.</p>
