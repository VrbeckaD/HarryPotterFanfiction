    <p>Harry slid into the train compartment. Malfoy was on his own, curled on the seat with his forehead pressed to his knees. <em> Crying. </em></p><p>Harry felt a shiver of guilt, but stepped forward. “Hey, Malfoy.”</p><p>“<em>What</em>?” Malfoy tried to sound rude, but the sob that escaped him was broken and pathetic.</p><p>“I wanted to check on you.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Harry closed the distance between them. “Well, I don't know, but you clearly need it.”</p><p>Malfoy snorted. “Just leave, Potter.”</p><p>“Ugh, Malfoy. Could you stop being rude for one bloody second and actually listen to me?”</p><p>Harry's growl of frustration had the desired effect. Malfoy raised his head, wiping his eyes with an angry gesture.</p><p>When he didn't speak, Harry sat by his side. “I just wanted to know how you feel. You're not my enemy anymore, I don't want you to feel alone.”</p><p>“Then go tell my friends to move their arses back to Hogwarts and stop being cowards,” Malfoy spat. “Go bring Crabbe back from the dead.”</p><p>“I can’t do that… but I can be here for you if you let me.”</p><p>Malfoy smiled weakly. “You might regret that offer.”</p><p>“Try me.”</p>
