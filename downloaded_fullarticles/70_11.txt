  <em>Closer Than Brothers: Part III</em>
</p><p>
  <em>.~.</em>
</p><p>Chapter 35:  Home For The Holidays</p><p>.~</p><p>Albus glanced up at the stone vaulted ceilings that adorned the Room of Requirement, which had gradually started to blur.  He’d been listening to Gellert speak about the Brotherhood, specifically the magical faction for a good while now.  If Albus was honest with himself, his sense of time was way off.  <em>I’m never drinking again.</em>  Albus’ head throbbed and his stomach roiled, but he ignored his discomfort.  Now was the time to be supportive.  He’d already let his bondmate down enough, he wouldn’t do it again this night.</p><p>“So let me get this straight,” said Albus.  He voiced one of his biggest fears, which had come up when he’d spoken with Adalia earlier about this uberwealthy group of men who’d formed a pureblood secret society and were plotting to restructure the world to only benefit them and their dark agenda.  “I know the Wizarding Brotherhood believe that muggles are expendable, but do you believe they want to rule over the non-pureblood wizards as well?”   He squirmed a bit in Gellert’s arms, which were a little too tight.  </p><p>Gellert immediately lessened his hold, letting Albus breathe a little easier.  “I’m afraid so.  During my time living in Grindelwald Manor, I overheard my father and his associates speaking about setting up a caste system to put in place when they finally reveal themselves to the world and take control.”</p><p>“A caste system?  You mean like a hierarchy?”  Albus asked.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Shit, Gell.”  Albus trembled in his arms, wanting to scream at the injustice of it all.  “I don’t know… I don’t understand.”</p><p>“I know it’s a lot to take in.  Let me try and explain better.  Think of it like a pyramid.”  Gellert’s right hand found Albus’ as he tried to explain further.  “On the very top will be the pureblood wizards, with the pureblood muggles just under them – the pureblood muggles agreed to that, as there are very few of those families.   Then the non-pureblood wizarding population is below them.  They’ll be able to practice magic freely without having to hide, but the rest of their lives will be tightly controlled by the purebloods.   The non-pureblood ordinary muggles are at the very bottom of this system, as they make up most of the general population.  They will function as what are essentially mind-controlled slaves for both factions of purebloods.”</p><p>Albus shivered at Gellert’s dire picture of the future.   Then he frowned, as his cognitive skills were failing him at the moment.  “It’s still not quite coming together.  I can’t seem to connect all the dots right now.”</p><p>“That’s alright,” Gellert said bracingly.  “I’ll tell you more after you’ve sobered up.  I’m just glad that you don’t think I’m crazy.”  He kissed Albus’ forehead and caught his bondmate’s unfocused gaze.  “I’m glad we’re finally on the same page.”</p><p>“Me too,” Albus agreed as he struggled to process all that he’d heard.  “But it’s so hard to believe!  Mind controlled muggles?  The lives of wizards and witches tightly regulated?  Purebloods ruling from on high?  Gellert, this is really fucked up.”</p><p>“Yes.  Yes, it is,” Gellert said softly.  “And you know what else is fucked up?  Having this knowledge and no one believing you when you share it.”  <em>Fuck</em>.  Gellert watched as Albus’ face crumpled.  “Shit, Albie, I didn’t mean to say that out loud.”</p><p>“Yes you did.  I-I deserved it.”  Albus sucked in a few breaths and swallowed hard.  “You know, I don’t feel so good.   I think I’m gonna-”  Albus gagged and then promptly threw up on Gellert’s favorite black high boots.  The taste of lemon cake, raspberry-pineapple punch mixed with stomach acid would be something he would remember for quite some time. </p><p>“Ugh.”  Albus wiped his mouth on his sleeve.  “I’m sorry about that.  Gell, why…why is the room turning in circles?”</p><p>“Oh boy,” Gellert sighed as he vanished the sick and struggled to help his bondmate stand up.  “I see you’re one of those people where it hits you all at once.  Here I was going on and on about the Brotherhood when you are in this state.  We need to get you to bed.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m so irresponsible,” Albus cried, leaning on Gellert’s shoulder.  //I didn’t mean to get drunk! I just didn’t know how to… talk.  About this.  How I messed up your life with my assumptions.//</p><p>“You didn’t mess up my life,” Gellert insisted.  “You just… complicated it.”  He smiled fondly at Albus.  He was still deeply hurt that Albus hadn’t originally believed him about the Brotherhood and would be for a while but he pushed that aside, knowing he needed to care for his bondmate at the moment.  “But I’m glad you did.  As I said earlier, I love you, Albus, and I wouldn’t trade any of our time together for the world.”</p><p>“How can you love me?  I’m the worst person in the world.  I shouldn’t be allowed to liiiive,” Albus said dramatically, gesturing to himself.  “Put me out of my misery, Gellert.” </p><p>Gellert rolled his eyes at Albus’ theatrics, which at times could rival his own.  Apparently his bondmate was a maudlin drunk.  <em>That </em>was going to be fun dealing with over the course of their hopefully long lives as bonded mates.   //Albus, it’s alright.  You’ll sleep it off and be fine in the morning.//</p><p>//I looove you, Gellert.  So much.  I never drink this much, I swear.  Or do I?  I can’t remember.//  Albus rested his forehead against Gellert’s and sighed.  //Mmm, you’re beautiful.//</p><p>Gellert hid a smile.  Despite everything, Albus using their bond while intoxicated was adorable.  “Don’t worry about it.  You’ve been an exemplary example for everyone the entire term, including me.  You’re only seventeen, Albus.  You’re allowed to make mistakes.  You’re<em> definitely </em>not the only one to get drunk tonight.  Now, let’s get you to bed.” </p><p>“Okaaay,” Albus said agreeably as he straightened up.   “As long as I’m with you.”  He giggled as he playfully tapped Gellert’s forehead.   “Gell Gell Gell Gellert Grind… Grindel… wart?” </p><p>“Not even close,” Gellert rolled his eyes.  “Grindelwart?  Thanks a lot!  You’re drunker than I thought.”</p><p>He carefully helped Albus out of the secret room and steered them down a staircase towards their bedroom.  They passed several couples making out in the corridors, one of which was Nadia Nott and Bill Bulstrode. </p><p>“Gross,” Albus shuddered as he watched as the couple messily attacked each other’s lips in front of the Head Girl’s bedroom door.  “Am I that drunk or did I just see…”</p><p>“You saw it, Albie,” Gellert confirmed, making sure they gave the pair a wide berth.  Watching Bianca’s rather easy older sister snog her current boy-toy was something he’d rather avoid. </p><p>They were almost home free before they happened upon Adalia and Bianca, who were loitering around the entrance to Albus’ bedroom. </p><p>“GELLERT!”  Bianca stumbled towards him, dragging Adalia with her.</p><p>“I’m afraid she had to see you straight away,” Adalia said, sounding apologetic.  “I told her to wait until tomorrow but she insisted.” </p><p>“Muffliato,” Gellert cast the spell over the foursome, as well as a Notice-Me-Not, just in case.   “What’s wrong, Bianca?”</p><p>“I’m sorrrrry,” Bianca cried, several tears streaking down her cheeks.  “I should’ve told you about my past earlier, but I was afraid they’d lock me in the...”  she frowned.   </p><p>“Hospital Wing, darling.”  Adalia was supporting Bianca, keeping her upright as the brunette started to slip.  “Goodness, you’re completely soused.”</p><p>“I only had one glass,” Bianca pouted. </p><p>“It will be alright.” Gellert caught her gaze and gently touched her shoulders.  He knew getting upset at Bianca wouldn’t help things.  “I understand why you held back that information.  Thank you for telling Adalia when you did.  We’ll talk about it further tomorrow on the train.”</p><p>Bianca nodded, struggling to process that information.  “Good.  Hey, Adalia, you work in the Hospital Wing!  You’re a what’s it called?”</p><p>“Healer,” Adalia supplied.  “Alright, Bianca, you’ve had your fun.  Time for bed.”</p><p>“Yes, please,” Bianca giggled before she kissed Adalia’s cheek. </p><p>“Not like that!” Adalia groaned as she blushed to her roots.  “Behave!” </p><p>“Bianca, you should know that if you break Adalia’s heart, I’ll turn you into a toad,” Albus announced, shakily pointing his finger at her. </p><p>“Noooo,” Bianca placed her head on Adalia’s shoulder.  Her voice was muffled.  “Your fake boyfriend doesn’t liiiiike me.”</p><p>Adalia and Gellert shared an exasperated look. </p><p>“This was<em> not</em> the way I envisioned this night going,” said Adalia.</p><p>“You’re telling me,” Gellert agreed.  “So much for a romantic evening alone.”</p><p>“Gellert, you should know I feel awful for doubting you,” Adalia said softly as she struggled to hold up Bianca, who wasn’t nearly as light as she looked.   “I don’t think I’ll ever forgive myself.”</p><p>“I’m not happy with you.”  Gellert gave Adalia searing glare.  Waves of intense energy radiated from him.  “However, I’m afraid Albus got the brunt of my anger just now.”</p><p>“I believe you, Gellert!”  Albus said tearfully.</p><p>“I know you do, darling.”  Gellert whispered into Albus’ ear.  “Thank you.”</p><p>“Albus shouldn’t take all the blame.  It was as much my fault as it was his, if not more,” said Adalia.  “<em>I</em>  was your healer, not Albus.   It was me who misdiagnosed you.”</p><p>“True,” Gellert allowed before stating softly, “That misdiagnosis caused me a lot of pain.”</p><p>Adalia’s eyes filled with tears.  “I made a grave mistake and for that, I’m truly sorry.”</p><p>Gellert sighed. “I know you’re sorry.  But that doesn’t make up for what you did to me.  You blindly followed your superior.  You didn’t even try to research my claims.”</p><p>“I had a tiny suspicion that it could be true, but I discounted it.”  Adalia shook her head.  “How can I make it up to you?”</p><p>“I don’t know if you can,” was Gellert’s grim answer.  “We’ll talk about this tomorrow.”</p><p>He redirected his attention to his boyfriend.  “Now, Albus, we <em>really need to go</em>.”</p><p>“But Gelllllllllll.”  Albus draped his arms over him.  “They just got together.  We need to celbra-celery-celebrate.”  He cracked up.  “I can make new words!” </p><p>“Now is not the time, Albus,” Gellert said sternly.  “It’s time for bed.”</p><p>“But <em>Gell</em>ert, we need to talk and figure this shit out.  All of us,” Albus whined. </p><p>“We will talk tomorrow on the train.  Albus, right now you and Bianca both need to sleep it off.”</p><p>“Heeeeheee Gellert, sleep with me,” Albus started to slip, causing Gellert to readjust his grip.</p><p>“Good luck,” said Adalia as Gellert repositioned Albus so he wouldn’t slide to the floor. </p><p>“You too,” Gellert indicated Bianca, who was happily sniffing Adalia’s hair.</p><p>“Gellert, do you think you’ll ever forgive me?”  Adalia stared at him unflinchingly.</p><p>“I will,” Gellert promised.  “But, as I told Albus, it will take time.”</p><p>“I understand,” Adalia said, her expression downcast.  Then she remembered something.  “Don’t forget, the train leaves at nine tomorrow morning.  Make sure he’s ready.”</p><p>“I’ll remember,” Gellert insisted.  “Well... goodnight.”  He gave Adalia a curt nod.</p><p>“Adalia, can we sleep in the same bed like you told me Albus and Gellert do?  Pleeease?”  Bianca asked as Albus and Gellert moved away. </p><p>Gellert wished he could’ve heard Bianca’s answer but he had his hands full.   He slowly dragged the intoxicated Albus to their bedroom, and deposited his bondmate on the bed face down.  He flopped on the bed next to Albus and went boneless, exhausted from the events of the night.   //You’re heavy, do you know that?//</p><p>Albus turned over and held out his arms.  //Gell, have we had sex yet?  I can’t remember.//</p><p>//No, Albus.// Gellert groaned.  //All we’ve done is snog.  A lot.  Well, I did fondle you but it was just for a moment.  But now is not the time for that.//</p><p>//Aw…why not?  I think sex is a… great idea.//  Albus yawned cutely and rubbed his eyes.</p><p>Gellert’s expression softened.  //Because you’re inebriated and I won’t take advantage of-// </p><p>Albus gave a loud snore, cutting Gellert off midsentence.</p><p>Gellert shook his head as he removed Albus’ boots and then his dress robes, making sure to hang them up.  Then he managed to get Albus’ pajamas on before climbing into bed beside him.   He set Albus’ pocket watch for quarter ‘til eight so he’d have plenty of time to pack for Albus and get him a potion to cure what was sure to be a terrible hangover.  Gellert pulled Albus close and drifted off to sleep, relieved this very weird night had come to an end.</p><p>.~.</p><p>
  <em>The next morning</em>
</p><p>Albus’ gold pocket watch jingled, abruptly yanking Gellert out of slumber.   He yawned hugely, wishing he’d had more time to sleep, estimating that he’d slept for around six hours.  He questioned the sanity of whichever brilliant adult decided on a nine o’clock train departure the day after the Yule Ball.  Gellert forced himself out of bed and started to dress.  Then he gathered his belongings that he needed to take with him over the holidays and magically arranged them so they’d fit in his trunk. </p><p>Naturally, Albus slept right through the alarm so Gellert had to pack for him as well.  He finally halted the alarm and poked his bondmate in the stomach.  “Albus.  <em>Albus,</em> you have to get up.  The train’s going to leave soon.”</p><p>“Five more minutes,” Albus whined and turned back over.</p><p>“Albus, come on!”  Gellert raised his voice, but Albus was out cold.  Gellert couldn’t hold back an eye-roll before he left Albus to take a brief trip to the Hospital Wing to pick up a potion to relieve hangovers.  He ran into several other students on the same quest, including Adalia, but Madam Dilys was nowhere to be found. </p><p>Gellert quickly returned to their bedroom.  “Albus, I’m back,” he announced.  “Wake up.”  Gellert shook Albus’ prone form but, predictably, Albus didn’t budge.</p><p>Gellert didn’t want to experience the consequences if they missed the train, especially since he didn’t know where he was spending the holidays.  He’d hoped he wouldn’t have to resort to this, but he was past his breaking point. </p><p>//ALBUS PERCIVAL WULFRIC BRIAN DUMBLEDORE!  WAKE THE FUCK UP!//</p><p>“Owww.”  Albus groaned as he struggled to sit up in bed.  “Why are you yelling at me through the bond?”</p><p>“Because I’ve tried everything else short of dousing you with water,” Gellert said, sounding exasperated.   “The Hogwarts Express is leaving in thirty minutes and we can’t be late.”</p><p>“But Gell, my head hurts.”  Albus winced as he rubbed his temples.  He wandlessly closed the drapes, trying to avoid the sunlight streaming in.  “What happened at the ball last night?”</p><p>“You got completely wasted.”  Gellert smirked as he passed the vial filled with a hangover-reducing potion to his bondmate.  “Drink this – it will help your head.”</p><p>Albus downed it and shuddered.  “It tastes like goblin piss.  Disgusting.” </p><p>“I’m not surprised you don’t remember.  You downed an entire goblet of spiked punch,” Gellert informed him.</p><p>Albus gave a tiny frown.  “Why would I do that?  I don’t usually drink much.” </p><p>Gellert’s smirk faded.  He was not looking forward to rehashing this, as it had been painful enough the first time.  “You had a sobering conversation with Adalia, and decided it would be a good idea to get smashed.”</p><p>“Oh,” Albus said in a small voice, his memory suddenly jogged.  “I remember that.  So the Brotherhood is real.  Adalia and I were wrong.  You’ve really been possessed this whole time.  And I didn’t believe you until last night.”</p><p>“I’m afraid so,” Gellert confirmed.  “But right now we have other problems.  You’re going home to your family and we still don’t know what the hell is happening to me.”</p><p>Albus staggered out of bed and peeled off his pajamas.  He reached for his Gryffindor robes hanging in his closet, appreciating Gellert’s thoughtfulness.  “Did you try to find one of the Madams?”</p><p>Gellert nodded.  “I went to the Hospital Wing and Madam Dilys wasn’t there.  Now, get up so we can go to breakfast.”</p><p>“You’re bossy this morning,” Albus commented.  “There’s no need to rush.”</p><p>But Gellert stood firm.  “Don’t ask me to deal with a ravenous Albus for the duration of the train ride to London.”  </p><p>“Very funny,” Albus sighed as he ran a brush through his hair and then messily tied it back.  “They sell food on the train, you know.”  Not that he would be partaking in any, but Gellert didn’t need to know that.</p><p>Gellert raised an eyebrow.  “You need real food, Albus.  Contrary to your belief, you can’t subsist on sweets.”</p><p>“I don’t have time for breakfast.  I haven’t even packed yet!”  Albus whirled around in a panic.  “Where’s all my stuff?”</p><p>“I packed for you,” Gellert said smugly.  “Now, come on.”  </p><p>“Right.  Thanks, darling.” Albus blushed, as he did one last sweep around the room to make certain Gellert hadn’t forgotten anything. </p><p>“Thank me later when we’re alone,” Gellert declared before ushering him out of the bedroom, floating their trunks behind them.  </p><p>.~.</p><p>After dropping off their trunks in the foyer, Gellert led them down to the Great Hall and to their respective tables. </p><p>Taking a seat at the Gryffindor table, Albus filled up on waffles, eggs, and pumpkin juice as he chatted with his friends to hear their stories from the ball.  Apparently someone had seen Professor Zartoza sneaking off with Professor Chemiste, which was the biggest topic of gossip, along with other unlikely students who had coupled up.  Justine Finch, a Hufflepuff, had asked Shacklebolt to dance the last dance and they were making eyes at each other across the room.  Elphias was glum because the girl he’d chased after had chosen to leave with a Ravenclaw prefect.  McClaggen was jubilant as he introduced Beth Creevey as his new girlfriend to the group.</p><p>“Congratulations, you two.”  Albus wished the unlikely pair well.</p><p>“Thanks,” Beth blushed as McClaggen reached for her hand. </p><p>“How did that happen?” Albus asked.</p><p>“I’ve been interested in Beth for a while,” McClaggen admitted, sharing a fond look with his new girlfriend.  “She never really gave me the time of day, unlike my female admirers.  I guess I felt like she was a challenge.  I got up the courage to ask her to dance at the beginning of the ball and then we kept dancing another dance together, and then another.  Soon, we realized we’d been dancing most of the night.  We took a brief walk in the gardens and we kissed soon after the fireworks went off.” </p><p>“He was a perfect gentleman,” said Beth, squeezing her boyfriend’s hand.  “How was your night with Adalia?”</p><p>“What?  Oh.”  Albus blushed.  He’d spaced out for a moment worrying about Gellert’s home situation.  “It was lovely.  I’m just glad I didn’t make a fool of myself on the dance floor.”</p><p>“I think you did fine.  You know, someone saw Grindelwald helping you to your room,” McClaggen mentioned offhandedly. </p><p>Both Albus and Elphias tensed. </p><p>“Not to worry, mate,” said Shacklebolt, patting Albus’ shoulder.  “No one’s going to snitch to the teachers that you got drunk and needed assistance.”</p><p>“Good,” said Albus, letting out a tiny sigh of relief that they hadn’t discovered the real truth about him and Gellert.  “I’d rather not tarnish their image of me.”  </p><p>“Merlin forbid,” said McClaggen, rolling his eyes.   The conversation turned to holiday presents and visiting their families.  Before Albus knew it, breakfast was over and it was time to board the train to return to London. </p><p>.~.</p><p>Once he vacated the castle, Albus fell in line for the train with the other students.  Gellert quickly joined him near the back of the line. </p><p>The Hogwarts Expressed whistled, announcing its impending departure as steam filled the air.</p><p>“Why so glum?” Gellert asked, noticing Albus was looking rather downcast.</p><p>Albus pursed his lips.  “I wish we could find an empty compartment so we could talk with the girls about the you-know-what.”</p><p>Gellert just stared at him, looking exasperated.  “Are you Head Boy or not?”</p><p>“Oh yeah.”  Albus stepped out of line and escorted Gellert to the front.  He stared back at the line of students, who were looking at him quizzically.  “Pardon me, I must inspect the train before you’re allowed on.  Check it for nargles and all that.”</p><p>“Yeah right,” Mercury Flint growled, who was waiting at the very front of the line.  “You just want the first pick of compartments.”</p><p>Albus just winked at him as he pulled Gellert onto the train.  They took the first compartment, and then Albus returned to the queue of students and gave the ‘all clear’.  Adalia and Bianca soon joined them and Gellert cast a ‘colloportus’ on the door so they could talk undisturbed.  Adalia, Bianca, and Albus all shared nervous looks, not sure how to proceed.</p><p>“So…” Adalia trailed off, taking Bianca’s hand in hers for moral support.</p><p>“So… we need to talk about this,” said Albus, his hands shaking a bit.  “The Brotherhood, I mean.”</p><p>“Before we get into the details about the Brotherhood, I did want to mention that you may not have been completely wrong about me,” Gellert said, hoping to soften the blow.    </p><p>“What do you mean?” Adalia frowned.</p><p>“I don’t think my depression was clinical, but for all intents and purposes, I <em>did </em>have a manic episode.  Everything was textbook, all my symptoms fit,” Gellert pointed out.</p><p>“But you said you’ve been possessed all along,” said Albus, his forehead knitting in a frown.</p><p>“I know.  But how does that explain why the potions are working and keeping me mostly stable?”  Gellert wondered.  “There was one thing I considered.  You mentioned my brain chemistry being changed due to the disease.  What if being possessed did that and the potions are acting to reverse it?”</p><p>“I suppose that’s possible,” Adalia considered. </p><p>Bianca frowned.  “Do you think that means that other people, like Madam Thomas’ son who have been diagnosed with mental illnesses have been-”</p><p>A loud rapping on their door abruptly cut Bianca off.  Gellert reluctantly removed the Colloportus charm, to reveal the trolley witch. </p><p>“Anything off the trolley, dears?” The elderly woman smiled at the group.  Albus’ mouth watered as he drank in the sight of all the sweets for sale.</p><p>“No thanks, I’m all set.”  Albus gave her a smile, holding up a bagel that he’d snagged from the kitchens.  The pumpkin pasties looked very tempting but Albus couldn’t justify paying for one, even if it was a minuscule expense.  Right now his family deserved every knut that he had.</p><p>“We’ll take two pumpkin pasties and four chocolate frogs,” Gellert announced.  Before Albus or the girls could object, Gellert had handed her some money and made the exchange.  After the trolley witch moved on, Gellert cast ‘colloportus’ again.  He passed out the chocolate frogs, and broke the pumpkin pasties in half so everyone could enjoy them. </p><p>“Thanks,” Albus smiled gratefully at Gellert.   //How’d you know?//</p><p>//You were thinking about how much you wanted a pumpkin pasty.//</p><p>//I wasn’t deliberately projecting that.  Huh.//</p><p>“Don’t mention it.  Anything to keep my bondmate happy,” Gellert teased, giving Albus a quick peck on the cheek. </p><p>They slowly ate their treats, all the while dreading the looming conversation. </p><p>“I guess I’ll start.  Gellert, I owe you a true apology,” Adalia bravely spoke up.  “I should’ve listened to you instead of dismissing your claims.  I take full responsibility for what happened.”</p><p>Bianca chimed in.  “And I never should’ve held back what I’d seen at that ball when-” </p><p>Gellert abruptly cut them off, holding out his palm for silence.   “I don’t want to hear it.  While I’m still not thrilled with either of your choices, the important thing is, you believe me now.”  He reached for Bianca and Adalia’s hands and gave them an encouraging smile.  “The time for apologies is over.  If you want to help, help me make a plan of action.  That goes for you too, Albus.”</p><p>“First, we need to figure out how you’re being possessed and try to stop it from happening in the future,” said Albus, determination evident in his voice.  “I can work on that, do research over the holidays if I can.   Although we’ll have to hide this from the adults.  Gellert, you’ll have to play along with the Madams and pretend you still have a mental illness.”</p><p>“I know,” Gellert said with a sigh.  “I don’t have much of a choice.”</p><p>“Oh!  I remember what you said last night, Gell.  We need to contact Selene Lovegood and see if we can get our hands on her father’s magazine,” said Albus.  “I think it’s called the <em>Quibbler,</em> not the Quabbler.  It’s independently owned, and apparently it has covered the Brotherhood quite extensively.  I can owl her during the break.” </p><p>“That would be very helpful,” said Gellert, squeezing Albus’ hand.  “Thanks.”</p><p>“I’ll see if I can subtly get more information about the Brotherhood out of my father,” said Bianca.  “Ask an offhand question here and there.”</p><p>“Good idea,” said Adalia.  “I can do the same with mine, although since we’ve distanced ourselves from our pureblood status I doubt he knows much.”</p><p>“Bianca, I hate to ask, but do you think your father is part of the Brotherhood like mine is?” Gellert asked.</p><p>The pretty brunette shivered.  “I don’t know.  He certainly has connections to it since we hosted that ball.   But I don’t know if he’s a member or not.   Honestly, I’m afraid to find out.”</p><p>“We’ll eventually need to find out who the members are if we’re going to expose the Brotherhood,” Gellert said.  “Most likely it would be the fathers of the chosen children and other purebloods.”</p><p>“Do you think that’s a good idea?” Albus worried. </p><p>Gellert gave him an incredulous look. </p><p>“No, hear me out.  If we go eventually public with what we know, they would do their best to discredit us, or even blackmail or make us disappear.  Is it truly worth the risk?”</p><p>Adalia and Bianca remained quiet, but Gellert couldn’t sit idly by.</p><p>“I want them to pay for their crimes, against me and against the other children,” Gellert growled.  “Exposing them is what they fear most, the loss of their power.  Now that you three know what’s really going on, it’s our responsibility to do so.  Besides, Albus, they need you and me for their revolution.  They’re not going to do anything that drastic.”</p><p>“They need you?” Adalia frowned.</p><p>Albus and Gellert quickly explained about the prophecy, that Gellert was the dark one, and Albus was the light-bringer.</p><p>“Wow.  And you’re sure the prophecy is talking about you?”  Adalia asked.</p><p>“I’m sure,” Gellert said firmly.</p><p>Adalia squeezed Bianca’s hand as they took a moment for that to sink in. </p><p>“What about the girls?” Albus worried.  “I don’t want to risk them getting caught.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, we’ll keep their involvement secret.  Only you and I would go public,” Gellert explained.  “But only when we have enough evidence.  It will probably take years to gather enough.”</p><p>“But what should we focus on?” Adalia asked.  “What does our plan of action entail?”</p><p>“We need to figure out who the members are, where and when they meet, what their goals are,” Albus said, sounding excited now.  “I know that we can do it.”</p><p>“We already know their goal,” Gellert reminded him.  “They wish to create a New Wizarding Order in conjunction with the muggle purebloods and rule the world.”</p><p>“True.  But they might have a timeline for how they will slowly take control.  If we can thwart some of those key events, maybe we can stop them, or at least stall them until we figure something else out,” said Albus.  </p><p>“That would definitely help,” said Bianca, although her expression was downcast.  “But how are we supposed to go on with our lives knowing that this is going on behind the scenes?  Gellert, you’ve managed.  How did you do it?”</p><p>“I try to focus on other things,” Gellert said quietly.  “My relationship with Albus, my friends, my schoolwork, Dueling Club, recreational reading.  I distract myself as much as possible so I don’t dwell on it.  But sometimes, I remember the truth and it greatly distresses me.   However, I’ve had years to accept the fact and that makes it easier.”</p><p>Bianca didn’t look convinced. </p><p>“But you can’t give in to fear,” said Gellert, catching Bianca’s fearful gaze.  “That’s what they want, its what they thrive on - spreading fear and lies throughout the world.  If you stay positive, you are taking a small stand against them.”</p><p>Bianca gave him a small smile.  “That’s a good way to look at it.  I’ll try that.”  Then she sobered.  “I just wish there was some way I could help you from being possessed in the future.”</p><p>“It will help now that you all believe me,” said Gellert.  “We can talk about it freely.  That makes it less intimidating, less frightening now that I don’t have to bury it deep inside.”</p><p>“Indeed,” said Albus.  “But we should make a pact not to tell anyone else what we know.   I think it would be safer for us that way.  I also don’t think it should be anyone else’s burden to bear.”</p><p>“Agreed,” said Gellert.  </p><p>The girls quickly murmured their assent.  “We promise not to tell.”</p><p>“Excellent.  I’m not sure what else we can do over the holidays that we haven’t already mentioned,” said Albus.  “I’d say we should enjoy our time with our families and we’ll tackle this head-on when we return to school.”</p><p>“That sounds reasonable,” said Adalia.  “There is much to celebrate this Christmas.”  She threw her arm around Bianca, who gave her a shy smile. </p><p>“How did that happen?” Albus asked, eager to turn their conversation to something more light-hearted.  “Was it a romantic moment?”</p><p>Bianca chuckled.  “No, she just blurted out that she liked me and asked me to kiss her.”</p><p>“You didn’t have to tell them that,” Adalia muttered, ducking her head.</p><p>“I didn’t mind.  It was very Adalia and I wouldn’t have you any other way.”  Bianca rested her head against Adalia’s shoulder.  “We’re officially courting now.”</p><p>“I’m so glad everything worked out for you two,” said Albus, beaming at his best female friend and her new significant other.</p><p>“Yeah, especially since you were so awkward towards each other during the ball,” Gellert added.  “It was pretty painful to watch.”</p><p>Albus smacked him in the arm.</p><p>“Hey!”  Gellert protested.  “It was a joke.”</p><p>“We were just nervous,” said Bianca.  “But we figured it out in the end.”</p><p>“That you did,” said Albus.  Then something wonderful occurred to him.  “Do you think that we could go on double dates during our trips to Hogsmeade?”</p><p>“I’d certainly like that,” said Bianca, nodding him.</p><p>Adalia looked cagey.  “Um, before I answer that question, there’s something I need to discuss with Bianca first.”</p><p>“Gellert and I can go for a walk while you talk it over,” Albus generously offered.</p><p>“Thank you,” said Adalia, giving him a grateful look.  “I’ll feel better once I tell her.”</p><p>“Be back later,” Gellert promised before he ushered Albus out of the compartment.</p><p>Albus took a few steps down the corridor but Gellert hadn’t budged.  “Aren’t you coming?”</p><p>“Going for a walk, yeah right,” Gellert winked.  “We’re staying right here to eavesdrop.  I found something that makes it possible.”</p><p>“That’s not polite,” said Albus as he crouched down to listen.  “Note that I’m objecting.”  He cast the usual charms to conceal them.</p><p>“Noted.”  Gellert pulled something out of his pocket, which looked like a yoyo only the string was attached to a fake ear.  “One of the Weasley girls left it in the Great Hall.  I’ll return it to her once we arrive.” </p><p>Gellert placed it against the window.</p><p>“…don’t want to leave you,” Adalia said.  “But the rumor is that Madam Dilys is looking to retire after this spring term.  I haven’t even told Albus about this because I wanted to tell you first.  I’ve been offered a new position.  If I take the internship at St. Mungo’s, that could give me enough diverse experience to apply for the vacant position at Hogwarts next fall.  Then it’s possible we could be together at Hogwarts during your final year.”</p><p>“I see,” said Bianca.  Her tone had gone frosty.  “Well, I must say, I wasn’t expecting that from you.  Why would you bother getting together with me if you’re planning on leaving?”</p><p>“I know that’s not what you wanted to hear, especially since we just got together.  But I’m looking at this from a long term perspective,” said Adalia, sounding apprehensive.  “But I need to know that I’m not risking us in the short term by not being here every day with you.  If I work at St. Mungo’s, I can visit you probably every other weekend, but I don’t know if that will be enough.”</p><p>“Ohhhh.”  Bianca’s tone lightened.  “You still want to visit me.  That’s different.”</p><p>“Did you think I didn’t want that?”  Adalia sounded incredulous.</p><p>“I didn’t know what to think.  But I’m more than willing to do long distance,” Bianca assured her.  “You have your career to think of.  That should always come first.”</p><p>“Are you sure?  I mean, I’ll owl you most days but that’s no substitute for meeting in person.”</p><p>“Absolutely.  And I might be able to visit you at the hospital on weekends if you can’t come to me.”</p><p>“You’d do that for me?”</p><p>“What do you think?”  Bianca said teasingly.  “Do you think I plan to lose you after I just found you?  No.  No way.”</p><p>“So you think I should take it?”</p><p>“Do you want to?”</p><p>“More than anything.  I need to see what it’s like working in a large hospital.  And it’s a great opportunity to learn new skills.  Madam Dilys says she’s taught me all she knows.”</p><p>“What about Albus?”</p><p>“He and Gellert will just have to be extra careful.  I don’t think I should stay here because he needs a fake girlfriend.  Do you think that’s being too selfish?” </p><p>“Not at all.  I’ll be here to play Gellert’s girlfriend.   That should keep them safe.  I think you should take the job.  I’ll still be here.”</p><p>They heard a loud rustling and kissing noises, prompting Gellert to remove the ear. </p><p>“I can’t believe she’s leaving,” Albus said in an odd voice.</p><p>“She’s got an amazing opportunity to continue her studies,” said Gellert.  “I thought you’d be happy for her.”</p><p>“I am, it’s just… I’m going to miss her.”</p><p>“Of course you are.”  After looking to make sure the coast was clear, Gellert gently rubbed his back.  “But it won’t be forever.  And we’ll see her on some weekends.”</p><p>“Yeah.  I guess I’m not used to the fact that I’m not the most important person in her life anymore.”  Albus gave him a wry smile. </p><p>“But you are in mine,” Gellert reminded him.</p><p>Albus beamed at him.  “Yes.  That will keep me going this holiday season while we are apart.”</p><p>Gellert stiffened as his panic face surfaced.  “Apart?”  //I don’t want to be separated from you.  Albie, please don’t let me be taken away from you.//</p><p>//It will be alright, Gell.//  “Come on,” Albus said softly, ushering Gellert forward as they walked past the full compartments.  “We need to find a place where we can be alone and talk about this.”</p><p>.~.</p><p>The only place that was empty was the baggage car, so Albus and Gellert hid amongst the haphazardly tossed trunks and suitcases.  After locking the door and casting the proper spells, Albus pulled a quivering Gellert into his arms. </p><p>“Albus, what’s going to happen to me?”  Gellert asked, sounding forlorn. </p><p> “I don’t know, love, but our teachers have a plan.  I asked around earlier but they aren’t on the train – they probably apparated home.  But I still think we should trust them.”  Albus gently combed his fingers through Gellert’s golden curls in an attempt to soothe him. </p><p>“You get to go home for Christmas to your family and I’m happy for you, but I don’t want to go back to my father.  I-I don’t want to be tortured again.”  Gellert rested his brow against Albus’, their foreheads tingling pleasantly at the contact as the bond sang.</p><p>“Gell, I swear to you, I won’t let you go back there,” Albus whispered before gently kissing the tip of his nose and nuzzling him.  “I won’t.”</p><p>Gellert trembled in his arms, even as he sighed into the touch.  He started to shiver, even with Albus’ hot breath on his neck.  The baggage car wasn’t properly insulated and the chill was starting to seep through.  “There may not be anything you can do.  I’m a minor and my father is my legal guardian.”</p><p>Albus had been thinking the same thing.  //We’ll always have the bond, though.  We can use it to communicate.//</p><p>//Not if we’re separated over a great distance.//  Gellert reminded him.  //The headaches will be unbearable.  Albus, please don’t let my father take me away!  What if he never lets me come back to school?//</p><p>Albus shivered.  Gellert not come back to Hogwarts?  Unthinkable.  //Then I’ll fight it.  Somehow, I will.//</p><p>//I don’t think you could do much.  Even though you’re my bondmate, you don’t have any legal claim on me.//  A tear leaked out of Gellert’s grey eye and Albus gently wiped it away.  They stayed like that, wrapped around each other until the Hogwarts Express arrived at Platform 9 and ¾. </p><p>.~.</p><p>The train came to an abrupt halt, jolting Albus and Gellert out of their comfortable embrace.  They quickly exited the car so they wouldn’t be caught inside, toting their luggage behind them.  Soon the halls were clogged with children and teenagers, who were hugging and cheerfully saying goodbye to their friends.  </p><p>Albus and Gellert fell into line behind the students and disembarked.  They waited off to the side, away from the crowd of students and parents who were being reunited after months being apart.</p><p>“Now what?”  Gellert glanced uncertainly at Albus, who was scanning for his mother although it was rare she could leave the house to meet them.  Kendra Dumbledore was nowhere to be seen. </p><p>“I really thought Madam Thomas and Madam Dilys had a plan,” said Albus, trying to keep the apprehension from his voice as not to upset Gellert.  “They said the answer would reveal itself to us.  They know we can’t be separated for long.”</p><p>Gellert shrugged, trying to hide his growing panic.  Then he remembered what was in his pocket.  “I’ve got to return this.”  He pulled out the eavesdropping ear to show Albus.  “I’ll be right back.”   </p><p>Gellert managed to locate Mary Weasley in the crowd and return her eavesdropping ear, who was excited she hadn’t lost it.  She was surrounded by a plethora of adults and children, all with the same fiery red hair. </p><p>Gellert was filled with bitter longing as he watched as Mary shrieked with delight as her father picked her up.  What he wouldn’t give to live in a large family like that, with lots of brothers and sisters to play with.  To experience the love of a parent.  To enjoy time with his friends at home without fear of one of them being tortured. </p><p>He pushed his way through the throng of people towards Albus as thoughts swirled in his head, each one more terrible than the last.  He just knew that he would end up back at Grindelwald Manor, stuck in that little room, the victim of more twisted experiments.</p><p>For his part, Albus stood in a far corner of the train station, feeling lost.  He barely noticed when Aberforth joined him, holding his suitcase. </p><p>“Albus, are you alright?”  Aberforth asked in a low voice.</p><p>Albus realized he must be looking pretty worried if his brother was concerned about him.  “I’m just scared about what’s going to happen to Gellert.”</p><p>Then a familiar face appeared out the crowd and came to join them.   A middle-aged witch smiled at the Dumbledore brothers before ruffling their hair.  “Hello, dears.  Did you have a good time at school?”</p><p>“Hello, Miss Bagshot.”  Albus nodded at his neighbor.   “Are you picking us up?”</p><p>“Yes.  Your mother said your sister was having one of her bad days, so I told her I’d be happy to step in.”  Bathilda smiled at him.  “Our portkey leaves in five minutes.”</p><p>“Thank you, we appreciate it,” Albus said absentmindedly, knowing he wouldn’t take it unless he knew his bondmate was safe.  He spotted Gellert approaching them.  Albus decided he would let Aberforth go with Miss Bagshot and claim to miss the portkey.  But beyond that, he had no plan, no idea how to help protect Gellert from the horrors that awaited him at his home. </p><p>//Gell, my neighbor is here to take me and Aberforth home.// Albus nodded at Bathilda.  //What are we going to do?//</p><p>Gellert’s face started to crumple even as he fought to keep it together in public.  //Don’t leave me.//</p><p>//Never.// Albus promised.  //But I don’t understand.  I thought arrangements had been made.//</p><p>Gellert came to a stop next to him and had to clench his right fist to stop himself from reaching for Albus’ hand.  Then something happened that neither Albus or Gellert could’ve predicted.   </p><p>“Gellert, there you are.”  Bathilda approached the blonde wizard and patted his arm.  “It’s good to see you after so many years.”</p><p>Gellert gave her a practiced smile.  “Pardon me, ma’am, but who are you?”</p><p>//She’s Bathilda Bagshot, Gell.  She lives a few streets down from me.//  Albus informed him.</p><p>//Holy shit!//  Gellert stared at Bathilda in awe.  “We’ve never met but we have briefly corresponded.  You’re my great-aunt.” </p><p>Albus vaguely remembered Gellert mentioning that Bathilda was related to the Grindelwalds on his mother’s side.  A curious notion popped into his head but he couldn’t be that lucky, could he?  If it were true, it would solve all of their problems.</p><p>“I am indeed,” Bathilda agreed, giving Gellert a warm smile.  “My, Gellert, you’ve grown since the last time I’ve seen you.  Then again, you were only four.  You had these chubby rosy cheeks and the softest golden curls.  You were so adorable.  And look, you’ve grown into such a handsome young man.” </p><p>“Thank you.”  Gellert uncharacteristically blushed.  “I must say, I wasn’t expecting to see you today.  It was good of you to pick up Albus and Aberforth.”</p><p>Bathilda gave him a knowing smile.  “I’m not here just for them.  Gellert, I have good news.  I’m your new guardian.” </p><p>.~.</p><p>End Chapter 35</p>
