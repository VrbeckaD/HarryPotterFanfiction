    <p>Sixty seconds. You, and the rest of the late comers, had sixty seconds to get onto the train heading to Hogwarts before its doors sealed shut, leaving the muggle world for a much more magical kingdom. You clutched the ticket in your hand and ran towards the wall separating platforms nine and ten, feeling your heart pump hard against your chest. Once you emerged to the other side, you quickly grabbed your luggage and ran onto the train just in time before the train’s horn echoed through the station and took off. Pushing yourself through the crowd, you started to peer around, looking into each compartment. If only you’d caught the earlier bus to London, perhaps then you wouldn’t be stuck haling around your bags, trying to get past the first years eager to explore their first taste at their new school.</p><p>Reaching near the end of the train, you finally spotted the raven-haired boy you’d been looking for. He was dressed in an oversized black shirt, no doubt a hand-me-down from his father, and a pair of washed out jeans that had begun to tear at the knees. Predictable as always, you’d found him in the fair corner of the compartment with his nose buried deep in a book. Smirking to yourself you slowly opened the door, careful not to disturb him. First time you’d met he was already in his school uniform. Last year, you’d managed to snag a compartment before him, thus marking the first day you’d ever seen him in muggle clothing and judging by how quickly he’d changed into his uniform, muggle wear was definitely not an aesthetic he fancied. But this year, he’d diverged. He had plenty of time to change into those black and green robes before you arrived, and yet he’d chosen to stay in the clothing he’d put on that morning.</p><p>Severus looked up from his book to see the girl he had gotten so close to over the last few years, smiling at him by the door. Finally. Just on time too as some measly first years had clearly been eyeing the empty seats across from him the last few minutes, pacing the hall, trying to devise some sort of plot to force their company on him. Naturally, he wouldn’t have allowed it either way. Still, it was an encounter he’d rather have avoided seeing as how hexing students probably wasn’t a good way to start his sixth year at Hogwarts.</p><p>“Hey Severus.” Your soft voice filled the enclosed space, withering into his core like sugar dissolving in tea.</p><p>“(Y/N).” He felt so flustered all of a sudden. Funny how he’d been dreaming of this very day, this very encounter all summer, yet in the present moment, he’d gone completely stiff. His mind filtered all thought of starting a conversation as if he hadn’t played out what he’d say to you ever day the past month.</p><p>Looking back down at the words on his page, he tried to resume reading while you put away your luggage, but that was no good either. The ink had gone fuzzy as his focus shifted back to the girl across from him, standing on her toes with her arms stretch, pushing her bags into place.</p><p>Finally sitting down across from him, you sighed in relief as your adrenaline finally began to die down. Peering over, you noticed the book he was reading didn’t display the usual scuff marks, chipped corners and yellow pages you were so used to seeing in his hands. This book was new. But all his books were always second hand, so where had this one materialized from?</p><p>“What are you reading?” you asked curiously.</p><p>He noticed you examine the crisp detailing of the cover and knew you were wondering where he got it from.</p><p>“It was a gift from my mother. She slipped it into my bag right before I got on the train.”</p><p>“What’s it about?”</p><p>Severus shifted in his seat and cleared his throat before responding.</p><p>“I just started it,” he replied, his eyes returning to the pages on the book. You paused for a second examining him. Even his demeanor had changed. Had something happened in the past month to cause such drastic changes? Well… it didn’t really matter to you anyways. In fact, it was kind of refreshing to see him acting so much softer and less agitated with life.</p><p>“Can I read with you?” you asked nervously. If his attitude had changed, perhaps his tolerance had too, you thought.   </p><p>Severus looked at you before replying, searching your face for something he couldn’t quite explain himself. Once his gaze landed on your wide eyes, he scooted over, knowing how much you liked the window seat, and flipped back to the front of the book. You eagerly jumped up and seated yourself beside him, taking one side of the book. You both read together in silence for a few chapters before you spoke up and shared your thoughts on the book. It was quite the read and you could definitely see why his mother had gifted it to him. It was an intensively detailed analysis of the history of Potion Making. One you’d never seen or even thought of reading before. It shed a lot of light on certain techniques you’d never been able to understand until now, though, of course, it wasn’t really anything too new to Severus. Still, it was detailed enough to enlighten even him, giving you both the chance to have quite an in-depth discussion on the topic.  </p><p>You talked for a while before Severus took out a bookmark, marking the page you both were on and put the book away.</p><p>“How was your summer?” he asked you.</p><p>“It was okay. Kind of boring really. You know me,” you gave a giggle. The smirk he gave in turn told you he very much did know you, all too well in fact. “I was made Quidditch Captain actually! A letter from McGonagall was sent along with the usual Hogwarts letter.” You looked at him enthusiastically, so proud of yourself for retrieving such a rewarding price for all the effort you’d put in last year. “Glad summer is over though, I missed Hogwarts.” You smirked and looked down at your hands before whispering “I missed you.” You could feel your cheeks heat up in embarrassment. Had you really just said that? You wanted to tell him how you felt, you did, but you were afraid that if those words spilled out of you, he’d be appealed, ruining the friendship you’d worked so hard in gaining. “How was your summer?” you asked in return.</p><p>“Fine,” he shrugged, clearly not wanting to talk about it. He never enjoyed going back home and never liked talking about it either. “Congratulations on making captain.”</p><p>Your lips twitched as you eyed his hands, sitting gently on his lap. Slowly snuck your hand in his palm and intertwined your fingers with his, giving a small squeeze before settling. “Thank you,” you whispered.</p><p>A part of you half expected him to pull back, but to your delightful surprise, he didn’t. In fact, you felt him squeeze your hand in return, making your heart race and your minding filling with all sorts of unrealistic lustful thoughts as you smiled at him.</p><p>You spent the next few hours talking about everything and nothing at the same time. The compartment simply filled with jubilation energy, both of you feeling so comfortable and content around one another, it just didn’t really matter what you talked about.</p><p>Last thing you remember, you were staring out the window of the Hogwarts Express in the company of the only person at school that you trusted. Lifting your head, you blinked a few times before your eyes focused when you felt a light nudge on your shoulder.</p><p>“(Y/N)? (Y/N) wake up, we’re almost there. We have to change into our robes.”</p><p>Rubbing your eyes, you looked around and realized you had nodded off on his shoulder. “Sorry,” you mumbled, sleep still hovering over you like a heavy blanket as you quickly stood up, doing your best not to stumble over. “I guess I was more tired than I thought.”</p><p>“That’s okay,” he gave you a little smirk. Truth be told, he was enjoying your silent company and definitely wouldn’t object to more moments like this.</p><p>You both began to take out your robes from your luggage before he spoke once more. “I’ll let you get changed first,” he said as he closed the blinds and went to open the door.</p><p>“I trust you won’t look then,” you gave him a smile, his hand freezing, ghosting over the latch of the sliding door. His face tinted pink as his hair fell forward when he turned his back to you as you reached to remove your shirt. Finishing up, you noticed his robes neatly folded, ready for him on one of the seats and just couldn’t help the urge that overtook you as you grabbed his tie. Placing a hand on his shoulder, you let him know you were ready to switch positions. “Your turn.”</p><p>Severus saw the green and silver tie, obviously belonging to him, in your hand but said nothing. Instead, he made his way to the rest of his uniform as you took his original spot facing the door. Once he finished getting dressed, he turned towards you. “I’m going to need that tie you know.”</p><p>You giggled as you turned around and unraveled the tie, the silk of the fabric running between your fingers. Pausing you looked up at him as you bit your lower lip, wondering how far he’d let you go with your little shenanigans tonight. He’d been patient enough thus far, what would it hurt to push a little more?</p><p>Severus opened his palm in front of you, gesturing for you to hand it over wondering why you’d simply stood there with no notion of fulfilling his inquiry. You decided however, to deny his request and instead stepped forward, throwing over his head and around his neck carefully while pushing his hair aside. You smiled to yourself as he stood there, let you tie it.</p><p>Just as you finished, you let your hands slide down and rest on his chest as you looked up into his dark eyes. If only this moment would last forever, you thought. But as the train came to a stop you both detangled yourselves from each other’s gaze and reached to put away your muggle clothing. He opened the door for you as you went to grab a small book out of your bag, tucking it into your robes. Staying close to one another, you walked off the train towards the carriages. It was important you cherished moments like this as the segregation of the Hogwarts houses forced you two apart more often than you liked.</p>
