Severus lets out with the most heart reaching cry and with it magic pules out of him in waves, Sensing the anguished cry of his child Darth looks to the sky and sees Severus high above the quidditch pitch.     </p><p>Everyone is still in morning when they hear flapping of wings and look up to see another vampire everyone assumes is Darth Severus sire, the elder vampire tries calming Severus down but nothing is working the place around them is getting destroyed so he did the only thing he could do he takes the baby vampire by the shoulders looks at him dead in the eye, and says  “Severus as your maker I command you to stop.”</p><p>As if on instinct Severus stops unleashing his magic, “good now look at me” said Darth, Severus does so “you are unable to sense it because you are still young but I can your mate is not dead she and your unborn a hanging on by a thread” said Darth.  “How can you know?” asked Severus his voice is raw and he chocks on a sob, Darth lays a comforting hand on the black haired vampire’s shoulder, “Severus I have lived for 190 years I’ve developed the power all vampires have this ability but because you were only turned a year ago your still young in vampire terms and alas do not have the power yet” said  Darth.</p><p> “How can I save them?” asked Severus.</p><p> “The only way you can the only chose you have” said Darth</p><p> “You mean I have to….?” Asked Severus       </p><p> Darth nodded</p><p> They touched down on the ground and walked over to where Hermione’s body lay, Darth pulled back his hood “you” Voldemort growls as he saw Darth, “My Lord this is…. Severus gets cut off, “I know who he is Severus, he’s the vampire who took you before I could give you the punishment you deserved” Voldemort seethes. “Darth this is Lord Voldemort Hermione’s father,” Severus replies, he then goes on to explain to everyone present, “Darth says Hermione and the baby still live but are hanging on by a thread so there is a chance we can save Hermione” said Severus with a hope in his voice.</p><p>“How can you save her?” asked Mystique  as she turned to Darth. “Not me Severus” said Darth. “The only way they can be saved is if I turn Hermione into a vampire” said Severus, “what would that mean for my granddaughter what will happen to her?” asked Voldemort Severus turned to Darth “the unborn baby will be born a full blood vampire” said Darth.</p><p>“How’s that possible?” asked Severus.</p><p>“The baby is half vampire due to having your blood within her but when you turn Hermione the human blood in Hermione will turn vampire so the human blood within the baby will become vampire blood you child will be a pure blood vampire. Meaning the baby will have every weakness those vampires that include the biggest weakness of all the sun,” said Darth. “When the baby is 10 she will have developed her magic but she cannot go out in direct sunlight the sun will kill her she may go out in the pre-dawn hours and that it all" said Darth</p><p>Severus nodded.</p><p>“May I, my lord?” asked Severus,</p><p>“Save them Severus bring my daughter and granddaughter back to me” said Voldemort</p><p>“Severus nodded.</p><p>Severus walked over and knelt down beside Hermione he took the witch in his arms “I love you” whispered Severus he then placed a hand on her stomach and felt his daughter give a weak kick “don’t worry baby Daddy’s going to save you and mummy” said Severus.</p><p>Severus then put his lips to Hermione’s neck and sank his fangs into her when Severus felt Hermione heartbeat stop he pulled his fangs out and slit his arm and put it to Hermione lips “come on Hermione sweetheart drink, it will save you and our baby” said Severus. Hermione suddenly begins to drink when he knew Hermione had, had enough he pulled his arm away. “Now what?” asked Draco as he stepped out of his mother’s arms then whipped the tears from his face. “Now we wait” said Severus, “tomorrow she will awake a vampire.” Severus picked Hermione up and they all walked back into the Castle.</p><hr/><p>Once inside Severus carried her down to their room, walking into their room Severus walks over and places Hermione on the bed. He then lies down beside her kisses her stomach wraps his arms around her and closes his eyes, the day wore on and by the time Severus woke again the sun was just about to set. Severus looked out at the enchanted window, and saw the sun was about to set so he got up and conjured up some bottles of blood for Hermione   the sun sets and Hermione wakes with a gasp she lays there looking around wildly until she hears the soothing voice of Severus.</p><p>“Calm down love here sit up and take this” said Severus as he helps Hermione to sit up and hands her a bottle of AB+blood, once Hermione has drunk all the AB+bottles she is feeling strong and new “what happened I thought I was dead?” asked Hermione. “You were honey you were hanging on by a thread, but I saved you and our baby by turning you into a vampire” said Severus, “you what?” asked Hermione as she turned her body to face her mate and sat back on her heels. “I turned you into a vampire to save your life,” said Severus. “Our baby?” asked Hermione as she rested her hand on her stomach and felt the baby move.</p><p>“Our child will be born a full blood vampire" Severus explained.</p><p>Hermione was silent for moment before throwing herself at Severus and kissing him after a while she pulled back, Severus smiled and ran his finger though her ruby red hair, “shall we go see everyone?” asked Severus. Hermione nodded, “OK let go” Hermione gets up and goes for a shower 4 minutes later Hermione walks out drops her towel on the floor and does a drying spell on herself all the while Severus as yet to move from the bed. Hermione put on her underwear and just as put her bra on she felt eyes on her and looks up to see Severus watching her she smiles and walks over to him; Severus takes her by the hips and turns her away he then reaches up and claps the bra closed before turning her back around. Severus magically lifts Hermione’s black corset dress off the hanger from the walk-in closet, the dress floats over and into his hand, Hermione lifts her arms up and Severus resizes it to fit her before putting the dress on her. Once Hermione is wearing the robe, she walks off and grabs her black high heels. Hermione walks back to Severus, sits next to him, and puts on her high heels.</p><p>Meanwhile Severus moves to sit behind Hermione with flick of his wrist, Severus has Hermione’s hairbrush in his hand and brushes her hair for her.  Once that was done he sets the brush on her bedside table and gets off the bed, Hermione puts on black mascara eye shadow and eye-liner highlighting her amber eyes, before putting on blood red lipstick and blood red nail polish, after the finishing touches she puts on a black hooded cloak, before she and Severus, walk out of their bedroom cross the living room and out of their quarters, they walk up out of the dungeon and all the way to the great hall.</p><hr/><p>Everyone turns as they see the doors open, Voldemort and Mystique stand up when they see their newly made vampire daughter walk through the doors, Mystique walks around the table and runs down the aisle to her daughter and throws her arms around her beloved daughter and starts crying. “Mother” whispers Hermione as she wraps her arms around her mother; Hermione looks over her shoulder to see her father walking towards them, Mystique lets go of her daughter and turns to face her husband and steps back. Voldemort steps closer and reaches out his hand caressing his daughters face while saying, “you saved my life my child.” </p><p>“You hurt me daddy when you drove Severus away I have yet to forgive you for that, but I wasn’t going to let you die” replied Hermione.</p><p>Voldemort smiled.</p><p>They all walked up the isle Hermione spotted Draco and her friends and smiled they returned the smile, as the family stood on the platform, Hermione stood smiled at the death eaters showing off her new fangs, “stand and welcome back my daughter Hermione Riddle” said Voldemort. They all stood up and clapped, Hermione nodded to her friends and Draco along with Augustus Malik Goyle Sr Crabbe Sr Evan Lucius and Narcissa clapped the loudest and were wearing big smiles on their faces       </p><p>Hermione smiled and suddenly the great hall went black and music began playing, the room lit up with flashing lights Hermione pulled her hood down and unties the cloak lets it drop and walks down the stairs she flings the tables to the side of the room and starts dancing to the music shortly Draco and her friends join in as does the other junior death eaters.</p><p>Hermione closes her eyes and gets lost in the music swaying her hips to the beat, she then opens her eyes turns to her sire/ lover and smiled before saying “kiss my eyes and lay me to sleep," Draco grabbed Hermione’s hand and started dancing with her he spun her out before spinning her back in. Everyone was enjoying the party as Hermione was dancing she felt arms wrap around her. Hermione placed her arms on top and lent back into her mates strong body. The song ended but the party and dancing continued until just before Sunrise.</p><p>Everyone went back to their rooms, Severus picked up his Child and carried her off back to the dungeons were they celebrated with a glass of blood before heading off to bed</p><p>RCS</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Updated Finished it on the 7/10/19 </p>
