    <p>Hermione pushed a large lock of hair from her face to properly gaze upon the map in Harry’s hands. He traced a dotted path from the large landmass to the West to the tiny island on the far Northeast end, carefully diverting a sketched-out triangle smack dab in the center. His finger then followed the path right back, this time going straight through the shape and stopping at it’s Southwest point. They raised their heads from the map and looked out onto the sea.</p><p>“That is where we are,” Harry said gravely, pointing out to the calmly crashing waves, the foam crashing up against the side of the ship and misting into the air. The crew behind them leaned over the two, their eyes washing the browned paper. </p><p>“How did this happen?” Hermione’s voice was so hoarse it was barely heard. Her skin broke out in tiny prick points of goose skin.</p><p>“We miscalculated our positioning and never changed course over the night,” Harry said, “There's no time to avoid it now.” </p><p>Hermione shook her head, “No, you can't be serious.”</p><p>“You've heard the stories,” A member of the crew said frightfully, “we'll be tore apart!”</p><p>“Captain what are we going to do?” A voice behind them cried.</p><p>“We’re going to die,” said another.</p><p>Hermione squinted down at the map again. <i>Bermuda Triangle</i>, the charcoal shape read. A shiver ran down her spine. In her mind she could see the destruction their path led; the violent storms and wood torn up in the crying sea. </p><p>Hermione had, of course, already knew the risks of making this expedition, though. There were too many stories of the horrible Bermuda Triangle as it was, and too many more untold. It was that beautiful mysterious Island on the other side of it that everyone wanted to reach, her included. Since she was a young girl Hermione had been entranced with the idea of an exotic island, magical almost, with wonders never before seen.</p><p>And so, she'd taken that risk, fully and knowingly. And the crew that she'd assembled had as well. They'd all left home prepared to return as heroes or never return at all. Hermione could only hear the crowd rumbling behind her with indifference.</p><p>“Enough!” Hermione pushed herself out from them. She pulled the leather wrap from her wrist and tied her messy hair onto the top of her head, then stood up on the high point of the deck, looking out at the crew; <i>her </i>crew.</p><p>“So, someone on this ship has made a mistake, a <i>terrible </i>mistake. We know this,” Hermione addressed. She eyed no one person in particular.</p><p>“At this moment we are headed off towards certain death, but you all knew what you signed up for! Punishment shall be dealt out when we are sure to live, and we will! Is that understood?” She could see in the men’s eyes that they were unbelieving, doubtful. Hermione took in a deep breath, she'd be damned if she was to allow disobedience. </p><p>“Potter!” she barked, “Take Smith and help her navigate the safest way to get us through this!”</p><p>“You want to try and go through the Triangle?” Harry cried, outraged.</p><p>“Did I stutter!”</p><p>Harry’s face blanked over and he replied an automatic, “No Captain!”</p><p>“Good! Yamil, raise the anchor! Brown and Thomas, for now you’ll work on raising and manning the sails with the rest of the riggers. And, as for everyone else, you know what your jobs are! Nothing changes! Get back to work and for God’s sakes be on the lookout! I'll be damned to let this sneak up on us.” Hermione commanded the group as a true leader.</p><p>Her crew echoed out consent with a wave of salutes, yelling, “Aye aye Captain!”, all except for Harry. He stood in the back of the crowd where he hadn't moved from before, only approaching Hermione when all others had left.</p><p>He stalked over to her side, looking harsh and solemn. Harry; her Quarter Captain; her trusted confidant; her best friend. He looked into her eyes saw fear hidden beneath her confident guise.</p><p>“Are you sure about this, Mione?” He asked in hushed tones, though she was sure he knew she was not.</p><p>The side of her mouth twitched. “Yes. I'm sure,” The Captain said. Then, quietly and intently, “Please don't think of me as your friend right now. I don't need a friend. I need a good sailer, a navigator. I need Potter. Not Harry.”</p><p>Harry’s back stiffened tightly. “So be it,” He said leaving, so hesitantly.</p><p>Hermione walked down to the forecastle of the vessel, down by the hull, and gazed out onto the foggy distance where Poseidon’s wrath boiled the sea. She could see that they were fast approaching the Triangle and though they wouldn’t pass through the center it would be a tumultuous passing. She only hoped they would make it through alive.<br/>
