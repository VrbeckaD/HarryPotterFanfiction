  <strong>Game Changer Prologue: Brains</strong>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>"Hey!" said Ron, who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly toward Harry, giggling.</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>"Hey, Harry, there are brains in here, ha ha ha, isn't that weird, Harry?"</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>"Ron, get out of the way, get down —"</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>But Ron had already pointed his wand at the tank.</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>"Honest, Harry, they're brains — look — Accio Brain!"</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>The scene seemed momentarily frozen. Harry, Ginny, and Neville and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish. For a moment it seemed suspended in midair, then it soared toward Ron, spinning as it came, and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it, unraveling like rolls of film —</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>"Ha ha ha, Harry, look at it —" said Ron, watching it disgorge its gaudy innards. "Harry, come and touch it, bet it's weird —"</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>"RON, NO!"</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>Harry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain, but he was sure it would not be anything good. He darted forward but Ron had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands.</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>The moment they made contact with his skin, the tentacles began wrapping themselves around Ron's arms like ropes.</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>"Harry, look what's happen — no — no, I don't like it — no, stop — stop —"</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>But the thin ribbons were spinning around Ron's chest now. He tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like an octopus's body.</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>"Diffindo!" yelled Harry, trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around Ron before his eyes, but they would not break. Ron fell over, still thrashing against his bonds.</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>"Harry, it'll suffocate him!" screamed Ginny, immobilized by her broken ankle on the floor — then a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eater's wands and hit her squarely in the face. She keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious.</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron heard Neville's voice yelling something and some footsteps, fear immobilized him as he finally registered that Ginny had gone quiet. Neville walked over to him and tried something but he would have none of it as he renewed his struggle against the brain as thoughts invade his mind.</p>
<p>"Go! Go and help – I'll be okay! GO NEVILLE!" he bellowed as Neville sprinted somewhere. He hopes its either Ginny or Harry receives Neville's help as one of the tentacles wrapped around his waist, his hips, and his diaphragm.</p>
<p>He screamed in pain as the thoughts flow all over his torso, then he gasp as one tentacle also wrapped around his neck. Ginny's right, the brain will suffocate him as he felt other tentacles wrap around his ankles, legs, and thighs then position his body as if he's being crucified.</p>
<p>Ron let a tear slip through his eye, blood poured from his arms as his sweat intermingles with his wounds. He soundlessly watched as the brain transfigured into a wooden cross and the thin ribbons of images turn a fierce orange he'd seen on tigers in one of his father's muggle encyclopedias.</p>
<p>He watched in fascinated horror as the cross sunk into his chest where his heart would be, then everything went black.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Silver Lining opened his eyes as he heard a familiar scream, a scream of someone being Crucioed. He gripped a wand –</p>
<p>'Wait! Whose wand was this?' he thought as he stood up. He saw three unconscious girls and wandlessly put up a shield over them, pointed the wand he's holding to a girl with bushy hair and recite the incantation of the curse she suffered from after a diagnostic spell then point it to the redhead to fix her ankle.</p>
<p>"RON! WHERE'S HARRY?!" Sirius yelled as he opened the door and strode over to Ron.</p>
<p>'Ron' looked at him as he mumbled follow me before sprinting to the room where he heard the scream. Silver Lining filed that his name is 'Ron' now, mentally listing all the curses and hexes he knew to protect the boys named Neville and Harry ('Wait, Neville and Harry? Do I know them?) as they burst from the door and descended on the Death Eaters.</p>
<p>Silver Lining took Dolohov and MacNair out with a stunning spell enough to induce cardiac arrest when he accurately aimed at their chests. He then found Harry and Neville on the floor just as someone tried to choke on Harry, a <em>Petrificus Totalus</em> did the trick as he pulled the two boys to the direction of the exit just as Sirius duel another Death Eater.</p>
<p>"Ron! You're alive!" Harry exclaimed. 'Ron' put up a shield around them and smiled at Harry as he nonverbally cast <em>Episky</em> on Neville. Moody appeared beside them just as 'Ron' is about to reply.</p>
<p>"MOVE POTTER AND DON'T LET THE PHROPECY FALL ON WRONG HANDS!" Moody ordered as he blasted Jugson with his staff.</p>
<p>'Ron' placed a cushioning charm on where Tonks fell as Bellatrix whooped in joy to join into the fray and 'Ron' welcomed her.</p>
<p>"Harry! Neville! Get away from here now or break the bloody prophecy! Let the adults handle this mess!" 'Ron' ordered to the two teens as he sidestepped an <em>Avada Kedavra</em> just as he aimed at Bellatrix's feet for the floor to become quicksand while Bellatrix taunts him. Bellatrix gave an indignant screech when she was trapped and as he <em>Stupefy</em> her three times. Wandlessly and nonverbally cutting her shoulder with a cutting curse to damage her wand arm just for survival issues and Harry cursed her with a <em>Petrificus Totalus</em>.</p>
<p>Sirius took a hold of Harry and Neville forcing them to move just as Neville screamed Dumbledore's name. 'Ron' felt almost everyone feel relieved, that they're finally saved as Dumbledore descended down looking like an avenging angel to them.</p>
<p>He saw Moody attempting to revive Tonks just as Dumbledore rounded up the Death Eaters. 'Ron' <em>Accioed</em> both Moody and Tonks to him, they landed in front of him softly.</p>
<p>"Put up shields on us Sirius and Moody!" he ordered hastily ('Who were they anyway?') as he pocketed his wand and put one hand below Tonks's collarbone and another at her belly as he began to chant and helped Tonks's magic to heal herself. Tonks hastily sat up gasping after 10 seconds of his chanting and he pulled her up to stand.</p>
<p>"Ginny, Hermione, and Luna! Where are they?!" 'Ron' acted panicky, he's a 'teen' after all and one of the girls is his sister. What? He has a sister?</p>
<p>"We don't know! We're hoping you know where." Tonks replied as she hastily pulled her wand out. "And let's get you kids out of here already!"</p>
<p>An image of an infirmary passed through 'Ron's' thoughts as he held Tonks on his left then grabbed Harry on his right and his magic held on the three girls as well as the three men within the shield. He teleported and dumped the people he left with on the vacant beds. A matronly woman shrieked just as 'Ron' put his hands on Harry's chest and forehead where he can feel something dark.</p>

<p>Silver Lining wished he never had to sing that song again (he does not have a choice he has to sing it twelve times for the ritual to take effect but wished that a Horcrux would never be created again), that Damned Man… Hoping for immortality, split his soul… the secret spread like the plague, the Damned Man desperately sought those things. Horcruxes… he succeeded in helping the Damned Man contain the secret and mend the broken souls along with the Coven and have a Treaty with the Unspeakables about this particular case as the Damned Man regrets his act.</p>
<p>Silver Lining now knew the reason why he is here after 333 years of his death. What? How does he know it is 333 years after his death? The Treaty has been broken, he sacrificed his Magical Core along with his Brain to the Unspeakables in order to protect the Treaty and the Secret.</p>
<p>Harry's finally asleep as 'Ron' finally felt the weighing exhaustion his new body has felt. He withdrew his hands after the orange glow diminished, feeling accomplished he can still do the complicated ritual of isolating the Dark Soul apart from the boy's soul. Having another layer of protection along with his mother's Sacrificial Protection Ritual will protect the boy as 'Ron' collapsed into unknown arms.</p>
