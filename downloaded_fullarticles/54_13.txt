  <em>“MOTHER! FATHER! NO!”</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Five, can you hear me? Five? Five!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>“I’m sorry! Come back, please! Please!”</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Five! Five, wake up! FIVE!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Five woke up in a jolt, shooting up into a sitting position as his eyes flew wide opened. He was panting hard as he blinked his eyes into focus. He could feel his shirt sticking to his clammy skin, and his sore throat told him that he’d been screaming. All around him, he noticed that his dorm-mates were staring at him warily. They all probably had heard about his <em>literally </em>explosive magic from the Daily Prophet. After all, dear ol’ Reggie always loved to tell the world about all that his freaks could do. When Five’s eyes landed on the familiar figure of his ‘sister’, he felt his heart calmed down even though his magic still buzzed restlessly under his skin. Vanya was perched on his bed, her knee brushing against his as she eyed him closely, worry shone brightly in her brown eyes. However, it took Five another minute to reach out for her, wrapping an arm around her waist so he could pull her into a hug. He let out a sigh at the contact, feeling his magic finally calming down as he buried his face in Vanya’s stomach.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I didn’t…” Five began, struggling to get the words out. He took deep breaths, swallowing the bile in his throat before he finally found his voice. “I didn’t hurt anyone, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The last thing he needed would be his roommates to report him to the Ministry for his volatile magic. Reginald Hargreeves’ words rang in his head about how they <em>would </em>put him down if Five ever lost control of his power.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No, you didn’t,” Vanya replied gently, carding her fingers through his hair. “Are you feeling alright, though? Do you want to go see Klaus and Ben? Or do you want to get an early breakfast instead?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Five took awhile before answering in a strained voice. “Breakfast. But let me shower first. I’ll meet you at the common room in half an hour.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sure,” Vanya replied with a smile. She gave a kiss to his hair before she exited the boys’ dormitory, leaving behind Five with his room-mates who did a poor job of pretending like they hadn’t been staring at the girl.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t even think about it,” Five drawled out threateningly, glaring at those boys who quickly busied themselves. Satisfied with what he saw, Five then slid down his bed and reached into his trunk for his towel and uniform. He made it a point to ignore the shiny glint from the thin band of charmed cold-iron that had circled his left wrist since Reginald first brought him to England.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do you need any help?” Elphinstone Urquart said. He was the only person in Five’s House that the Prefect could tolerate and even consider as a friend of sort. “If you don’t feel like coming to class today, I can always tell Professor Slughorn about it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you, but there’s no need for that. I’m fine,” Five replied as he made his way toward the door. Before he left though, he turned to Urquart and said, “Also, thanks for getting my sister, Urquart.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He heard one of the boys wondering out loud how Five could have known that it was Urquart who had gone to get Vanya, but the Prefect chose to ignore him. There were five people in his dorm, including himself, and except for Urquart, he found them all to be a waste of space. In fact, Five found nearly everyone in the world to be a waste of space – even his family. Starting from his ‘Father’, although he was probably someone Five could have tolerated, if he wasn’t such a cock nearly 24/7. His ‘Mother’, kind and gentle that she was, hardly mattered for him. After all, everyone knew <em>who </em>was her favourite child. His ‘Uncle’ was sort of decent, but Pogo was too much of Reginald’s man for Five. So, nearly all of the adult figures in his life were useless, and Five had known since a long time ago that he was better off without them anyway.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then there were his siblings. Luther was obviously his least favourite siblings. Other than his looks, the pretty bastard was an absolute idiot. So what if he could turn into some sort of giant bird? It didn’t mean he was a talented wizard. It was just something he got as someone who was part-Veela, unlike if he’d worked hard to be an Animagus. Besides, it wasn’t really that special anyway. On the other hand, it wouldn’t take much effort for Five, and his magic could level Hogwarts to the <em>ground.</em> Diego, Mother’s beloved child, was much too emotional to be a properly functioning wizard. It was a pity though. Even Five had to admit that Diego was an accomplished wizard, what with his abilities to cast magic without any incantation.  And Five simply couldn’t <em>stand </em>Allison, that two-faced snob. The fact that she always tried to get into his head was cemented the Prefect’s dislike of her, on top of her habit of flaunting her Head Girl badge.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">His last three siblings were another story though. Klaus, his <em>very first</em> friend in his life, was someone Five considered to be even more traumatised than he was. The part-fae lived in a constant state of fear that his prophetic nightmares would happen – which, for nearly ninety eight percent of the time, was true. Obviously that could mess up anyone. The fact that Klaus was also the first person to accept Five into their fucked up family was also another plus. Then there was also their brother Ben, who literally turned into a nightmare every full moon. Not to mention, the sixth Hargreeves spent his childhood being experimented by Reginald in hopes that Ben could transform at will instead of once every full moon, which he succeeded. Five remembered when they were younger, Klaus once called them the Rotten Trio – the complete opposite of their older siblings, who were definitely Reginald’s priced Golden Trio.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But even more so than Klaus and Ben, it was Vanya who was Five’s most <em>favourite sibling. </em>No. She was more than that. Despite what she believed of herself because of her Obscurus – a result of the way her horrible parents raised her – Vanya was the single most important person in Five’s life. From the moment Reginald brought her home, Five knew that he would gladly lay down his life for her. There was nothing that Five wouldn’t do for his ‘little sister’. He wouldn’t hesitate to give up his magic if it meant keeping Vanya save, even with the knowledge that his life force literally fed from his magic. Unfortunately, their dearest father knew about it as well. If there was another reason for Five to hate Reginald, other than the cold-iron around his wrist that had been blocking the true extent of his magic, it would be the fact how Reginald would always use Vanya to punish Five whenever he failed in his training.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Five?” Vanya’s soft voice rang loudly in his ears, dragging him out of his reverie. The girl was standing over him, one hand cupping his cheek. She was already dressed, her own Prefect badge glinted on her chest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Making sure that he had a reassuring smile on his face, he turned his head slightly to the side to kiss her palm before gathering himself onto his feet. “I’m fine, Vanya. Don’t worry about me. Let’s just go have breakfast. Hopefully we will have enough time to spend with Klaus and Ben before class starts.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m afraid it’ll just be Ben,” the girl said as she led him out of the common room. “I just asked him whether he and Klaus wanted to have breakfast with us. Ben said he would love to, however Klaus wouldn’t be able to join us because he’d gone with Dave.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Five stopped abruptly, causing Vanya to collide into him. It was only luck that Five had quick reflexes, quick enough so he could grab hold on Vanya as well as steady himself at the same time, or else they’d have fallen down the stairs.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Who the bloody <em>hell </em>is Dave?” the male Prefect almost growled, his protectiveness toward his oldest friend growing. Even though Klaus was technically his older brother by a year, there was just something about the half-fae that urged Five to protect him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In fact, if Five was to be honest, he always felt that surge of protectivenes toward Klaus and Ben, who were not only older, but probably the only one other than Vanya who were almost as powerful as he was – Klaus with his fae-blood and Ben with his wolf.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Dave Katz is Diego’s best friend,” Vanya said. “He’s the transfer student from Germany, who come just before the end of Diego’s first year. His father, Erik Katz, is the current of Head of Incarceration. With Nurmengard being so close to Germany, he decided to move his only son here, to make sure that Dave and his wife would safe from Grindelwald.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And how did Klaus get to know him?” By then, they were in the Great Hall. Ben was still nowhere to be found, so they decided to head to their table and wait for their brother.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“He helped Dave with his English. You know how Diego really is under his tough persona, right? He got along almost instantly with Dave despite the language barrier, something he had problems with the rest of his House mates. So, he asked Klaus to help him.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“But Diego can speak German! <em>All </em>of us can!” Five exclaimed incredulously. Reginald made sure that they all could speak multiple languages, especially their respective first ones. So, growing up, the Hargreeves kids learned to speak English, German, Spanish, Italian, Korean and Russian.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Diego’s always struggled with languages, remember?” Vanya reminded patiently, knowing that although the seven of them were smarter than everyone else in Hogwarts – thanks to Reginald’s training – no one was as brilliant as Five was. “I mean, I don’t mean to be rude, but Diego has a stutter. So, I guess he figured that if anyone were to help him and his new friend, it would be someone who speaks German fluently. He couldn’t possibly ask Luther, not when the both of them were always an inch away from ripping each other’s head off. And he couldn’t ask you because you’d consider it a waste of time. So, that left him with Klaus. Besides, out of the seven us, Diego’s always gotten along the best with Klaus.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>Like me, </em>Five added grumpily in his mind as he viciously stabbed his bacon. It was no secret that Five and Diego were the most problematic of all the Hargreeves kids, and that before Ben came along, there was a time when Five and Diego would compete for Klaus’ attention.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Fine. So Klaus helped the asshole teaching his best friend English. I get it. But <em>why </em>did Klaus choose this Dave’s so-called company over us?” Five spat out, already feeling the start of resentment for the bloke he hadn’t even met yet. “What’s so special about <em>David</em> that we don’t have?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re already taken by Vanya, and I’m our resident lone-<em>wolf</em>,” Ben’s voice came out of the blue, answering Five’s demand. The werewolf flashed a greeting smile toward Vanya before he sat across them, stealing Five’s bacon stealthily before the Ravenclaw could stop him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ha-ha-ha. You’re so hilarious, Benjamin,” Five drawled out monotonously, though it lacked the usual snark because he was too busy fighting back a blush. Beside him, Vanya was lowering her head so she could let her long hair cover her blushing face like a curtain.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Ben chuckled as he munched on Five’s bacon, winking mischievously at the still-blushing Vanya. “Well, if you don’t like that answer, I suppose I have no choice but to go with the one about Klaus and Dave dating.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Five froze, his hand stopping mid-air from pushing his bacon into his mouth. He stared at Ben for awhile, hoping for the Hufflepuff to tell him that he was joking. When Ben kept silent, he turned his attention to Vanya so he could share his absolute shock. But, one look at her, he knew instantly that Vanya had known about it too. It only got worse when he saw Klaus walking into the Hall with the smarmy <em>idiot</em> Five remembered as someone who often tailed after Diego. Ben and Vanya apparently noticed where he’d set his eyes on, and in unison, they let out an identical sigh.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Here we go – “</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“<em>WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU’RE DOING?” </em>Five hollered in Italian, cutting off their words mid-sentence. He knew that only five other people in Hogwarts would understand what he was saying, and that all of them were his siblings – including Klaus.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Klaus’ head instantly snapped in his direction as he faltered in his way toward the Hufflepuff table. His eyes widened almost comically as realisation dawned in his mind at the sight of a furious Five sitting with a guilty Vanya and an amused Ben. Five noted with satisfaction that at the sound of his voice, <em>Dave </em>seemed to shrink in fear behind Klaus’ smaller build. The Hall was starting to fill out, but there was no sight on either Diego or Allison yet. If there ever was a time when Five wished his hot-headed brother was there to help him, that would be it. The Gryffindor Quidditch Captain was just as protective as Five was about their siblings, especially when it was Klaus. Hell, even Ben looked satisfied about Five’s reaction, and it didn’t take the Ravenclaw Prefect long to realise that he’d walked right into Ben’s trap. It was obvious that Ben felt just as protective toward Klaus, whose mannerism made him an easy target for bullies for almost all his life. However, everyone knew that out of all the seven of them, Five was the one everyone feared. If they wanted to scare Dave off, Ben would have to get Five on his side.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lucky for the Hufflepuff, Five was more than glad to help.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Now, he only had to make sure he could scare Dave Katz off before his annoying his big sister came. Wouldn’t want the Head Girl to rat him out to their ‘Father’.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ah, <em>mio fratello!”</em> Klaus greeted, his voice a pitch higher than normal. “I’m sorry, didn’t see you there, Fivey. I was uh, I was just going to eat. You know, breakfast? Most important meal of the day, according to Mum. Do you want to join me? I see you’re in the middle of your breakfast too. So, I guess not? Well, that’s it then. Laters, bro—<em>why are you standing so close to Dave?</em>“</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In the middle of Klaus’ nervous babble, Five had gotten off his seat to make his way toward the taller boy standing behind his brother. When Klaus tried to get in his way, Five expertly side-stepped the half-fae to get to Dave. After all, albeit Klaus being the skinniest one of the Hargreeves brothers, Five was the one who was light on his feet. Growing up, their mother always remarked that she sometimes thought Five was Apparating away whenever he was throwing his tantrum and had left the room inhumanly fast. Reginald almost thought that wandless Apparition was also another thing Five could do at such a young age, but after locking Five for two days in the manor’s cellar fruitlessly, Reginald realised that Five was just that—<em>fast.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hi, I’m Five Hargreeves,” he said coolly with a mirthless smile as he gave Dave his hand, completely ignoring his brother.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Uh, I’m Dave. Dave Katz,” the Gryffindor replied as he shook Five’s hand, biting back a flinch at the obvious pain he felt because Five had just sent his magic to shock him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’d say it was pleasant to meet you, but that would be lying,” the Ravenclaw said. “So, I suggest that we should just cut the bullshit pleasantries and go straight to business.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t—“</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I want to know that if you have any vile, dastardly, <em>heinous </em>plans for my brother, I’m going to stick my hand down your throat, pull your insides out, and feed it to whatever monster I can find in the Forbidden Forest,” Five snarled, pulling Dave closer toward him in a threatening manner. Despite the fact that the blond was older and taller <em>and </em>bigger, it was obvious how terrified Dave was.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Five would never know what Dave’s response might be to his threat, because just before Dave could make a sound, the castle shook as the front doors exploded. It was a powerful explosion, and it would have probably reached everyone in the Great Hall if Five hadn’t been quick enough to create a Shield to stop the force of the explosion. But it was still strong enough to send Five flying after his Shield was hit by the explosion. He heard Diego’s voice shouted something just before he landed on the floor, and he supposed he had to thank his brother for the Cushioning Spell. It didn’t take long before his siblings surrounded him, Diego being the first one to reach him and help him onto this feet. Five mentally nodded that Diego seemed to have just appeared out of nowhere, but he was too disorientated to ask Diego about it. The Ravenclaw blinked his eyes a few times to focus them, finding Vanya’s face as the first one he saw in his line of sight. Behind her was Klaus and Allison, and he could feel Ben standing on his other side.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Are you okay, Five?” Dumbledore asked as he pushed his way through his siblings. For a split second, Five found it worrying that he hadn’t even realised the old man was there. That would make two people that Five missed their presence, and this had <em>never </em>happened before.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m fine. I’m okay. <em>Really, Vanya</em>,” Five added to his sister. Vanya was running her hands all over him to check for possible injuries, and he pushed them away gently so he could focus on Dumbledore. “What do you reckon that was, professor?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“A modified Exploding Charm. Stronger than even <em>Bombarda Maxima,</em>” Dumbledore said. His blue eyes took one, last scanning look at Five before he turned his attention on the other professors who were heading toward the ruined entrance grounds, where the other professors had gone. “I’m glad that you’re alright, Five. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to—“</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I AM TALKING TO THE HARGREEVES CHILDREN!” a voice boomed all over the castle. “THIS IS GELLERT GRINDELWALD, AND I HAVE A MESSAGE TO DELIVER FROM YOUR FATHER.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What the…” Diego muttered under his breath, looking alarmed. Five was sure that the look was mirrored on him too, and every single one of his siblings.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do we…go?” Klaus asked. He was shifting restlessly on his feet, his eyes kept on flying toward where Dave was standing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No,” Dumbledore said firmly. “All of you stay here and help the other children. Keep them safe. Let me deal with Grindelwald.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“But he said—“</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“IF YOU DON’T BELIEVE IT, I HAVE YOUR BROTHER HERE TO VOUCH FOR ME.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Luther,” Allison breathed, snapping her head to the side. Before Klaus or Vanya could stop her, the Head Girl had run off toward the front door</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“<em>Allison, no!”</em> Vanya cried, and then she was running after Allison.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With their sisters <em>stupidly </em>running toward danger, the Hargreeves brothers knew right then and there what they had to do. So, before Dumbledore could stop them, Five led his brothers to go after Vanya and Allison. The four of them navigated through the crowd of students to the front doors, and Five couldn’t help himself from using his threatening presence as a Hargreeves to get everyone move out of his way. He found the rest of the professors were standing by the doors, making a sort-of barricade between the students that were trying to sneak a peek and the group of possible-threats that were standing in front of them. Allison and Vanya were standing with the professors, and the older Hargreeves sister was struggling with all her might to break out from Vanya’s grip. When Five and his brothers finally reached the sisters, he could see that Luther was being held under a wand point by none other than Gellert Grindelwald, forced to kneel down in front of the criminal. Even though Five didn’t like Luther, like <em>at all, </em>he still hated the sight of his supposedly older brother being manhandled by a maniac like Grindelwald.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ah, we finally have everyone with us here,” Grindelwald said. “I have to say, children, I do wish that we have met under better circumstances. It <em>is </em>a pleasure to finally meet the Lucky Seven.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Release Luther,” Allison demanded. “You said you have a message from our Father. We’re here now, we believe you. So, tell us what the message is and let Luther go.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Grindelwald tilted his head to side, narrowing his mismatched eyes at Allison as if he was sizing her up. Five was suddenly reminded that Grindelwald was a powerful Legilimens <em>and </em>Occlumens, and there was no doubt that the maniac was having a little psychic battle with Allison. It took almost a minute before Grindelwald took his attention of Allison, an oddly satisfied look crossed his face. He half-turned his head to the side and gave a nod to the woman standing beside him. The woman’s painted lips started to pull into a malicious grin as she brought a small pouch into view. Whatever inside it must be horrible, because Luther started to trash violently against the magical hold Grindelwald had on him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Allison, don’t look!” Luther yelled. “<em>Everyone, don’t—“</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And the woman threw the severed head of Reginald Hargreeves.</p>
