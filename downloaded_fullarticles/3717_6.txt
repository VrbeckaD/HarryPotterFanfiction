    <p>Yaxley was pleased, which only meant that things were well for him, but not likely beneficial for very many others. He had solidified his position at the Ministry of Magic when Lord Voldemort told him to place the new Minister, Pius Thicknesse, under the Imperius Curse and manage him for the benefit of the world the way the Dark Lord wanted it to be. Thus, appropriate speeches had been made, policies had been implemented, and new committees had been formed to enforce the laws which Yaxley alone had developed. He was finally running the magical world, far more than any other individual was, save The Dark Lord himself. He was clever enough to be the seemingly-obedient servant, but above all, his Slytherin ambition burned to his core. Now, having achieved what he could, was there some way to undermine The Dark Lord? It all had to be subtle, done little by little with the lightest of touches, and infrequently too. He was ambitious, but he was no fool.</p><p> Things were going quite well at the Ministry for him with the exception of a visit from an irate husband of one of the witches who Yaxley had been fucking. The witch was new to the Ministry, having graduated from Hogwarts only a month earlier. She was a half-blood, Hufflepuff, blonde and na√Øve. Yaxley surmised someone had witnessed him with her and told her husband, a Ravenclaw with an unwisely impulsive streak. Yaxley knew that the witch hadn't told anyone since he always Obliviated his targets after using them. He suspected Umbridge had been the snitch. The couple had been packed off to Azkaban on false convictions, but he knew he would need to be careful in his handling of Dolores. He didn't need her to spoil his hunting ground. His vices were minimal and he was not about to allow any subordinate to rein him in. </p><p> In the Wizarding world, the hunt for Potter went on, with Voldemort becoming more impatient. And so it was in late July, on an unusually chilly night, Yaxley was summoned to a meeting with his fellow Death Eaters and the Dark Lord. Fog enshrouded Malfoy Manor and Yaxley was glad to come in and escape the cold. There were others entering also and they filed up the stairs with few words, knowing that if Lord Voldemort wanted to hear from them he would tell them to speak. Few had the temerity to speak unbidden. Yaxley was glad to come there with news to share. Whether Dawlish's information was accurate or not mattered little to Yaxley, but the telling of it would likely make him more valued. </p><p> They all gathered around the substantial table. The lipless mouth did not speak, and so his acolytes maintained their silence, staring either down at the table, or nervously glancing around, eyes coming to rest on the empty seat at their master's left hand. Voldemort seemed unperturbed by the missing Death Eater, maintaining his icy calm while his red-eyed stare made its way around the group. </p><p> Yaxley estimated that it was five minutes later when they heard the front door, followed by footsteps making their way upstairs. There was a brief, pleasant exchange between the Dark Lord and Headmaster Snape who filled the empty seat. The deed had been done and Dumbledore was dead. Then Yaxley spoke up with his news of Dawlish but Severus crushed it immediately with his word of the plans laid by The Order of the Phoenix. Yaxley had enough self-control to not show his emotions, but he felt as if he had been slapped. There was little else for him to say. And no, he was not about to volunteer his wand when the Dark Lord made his way along the table. He stayed focused when Nagini swallowed up the corpse of the Muggle Studies teacher. He hoped her death threw off Severus a bit, as there was something to talk with him about. Yaxley worked hard and once in awhile he enjoyed a bit of indulgence.</p><p> Once Nagini had swallowed her dinner and slithered off, additional matters were discussed, mostly along the lines of rounding up sympathizers and undermining the Order. When the Dark Lord had satisfied his curiosity, he was done. Chairs were pushed back as they were abruptly dismissed. He caught Snape's attention and made his way over to the dour wizard who stared impatiently at him. "What's on your mind, Yaxley?" </p><p>"I've been thinking about the idea of having internships at the Ministry for a select few of your students. Perhaps some between their fifth and sixth years, as well as some between their sixth and seventh years. Even though the summer is half gone, spending a bit of time in the larger world could help with some career-building. Finding some good prospects to move our remaking of the Ministry forward would be helpful." </p><p> Snape's eyes narrowed ever so slightly in suspicion. "What would you selection process be like?" </p><p> "A letter of application, followed by an interview." Yaxley's voice was casual. </p><p> They were intruded on by a disheveled-looking Lucius who looked somehow even worse than he had at the start of the meeting. He appeared shrunken down within himself, as if withering up slowly from the abrupt loss of his wand. No doubt the glass of scotch in his hand was meant to steady his nerves, but it only made him more sloppy. "Internships at the Ministry? That sound like a good idea! Something useful for Draco to put his efforts towards. Or," he leaned towards Yaxley, "are you only going to consider girls for the sorts of positions which you have in mind?" He snickered at his own attempt at humor. </p><p> Yaxley was only mildly surprised that the smell of whisky rolling off Lucius was some cheap brand, rather than the brand which Lucius preferred. "Both witches and wizards will be welcome to apply," he replied tersely. </p><p> "I'll consider your proposal, Yaxley," Snape murmured before turning in place to Apparate, leaving Yaxley alone with Lucius. Lucius cleared his throat, somewhat taken aback by his colleague's swift departure. Snape would sometime linger and discuss matters with Lucius, so the swift exit made Lucius feel even more in need of a friend. </p><p> "Well, if you're looking for a student, a witch, to trial as an intern, I have one in my dungeon," Lucius helpfully offered with a distinct slur to his speech. Yaxley considered the possibility that Lucius had reached the state where he would have no recollection the following day of what was taking place. Yaxley's father had that relationship with alcohol and Yaxley had witnessed his father do the most witless things at night with no recollection in the morning. </p><p> The beplaited Death Eater nodded at his host. It wouldn't hurt to look at her. He absolutely wasn't considering her as a candidate for an internship, but he had a long-held fantasy in the back of his mind. </p><p> The locked dungeon door would open without a spell for anyone bearing the Dark Mark. Lucius had set it up that way since he was such a frequent visitor over the many years. He was especially glad now since he did not have a wand, thus saving himself the embarrassment of asking a guest to unlock his dungeon door. The door swung open and a torch flared in the darkness. Two pair of eyes shone in pale, thin faces at the far wall. Yaxley recognized Ollivander, little-changed in the four decades since Yaxley had stepped into the wizard's shop in Diagon Alley. Still, it wasn't the sight of Ollivander that sent a push of blood into Yaxley's groin. He liked the look of the wee witch -- quite a bit in fact. </p>
