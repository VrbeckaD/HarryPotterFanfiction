    <p>
  <span>One of the greatest perks to being Minster for magic had to be, Hermione thought, the office that came with it. The spacious floor plan had its own private Floo connection through an ornate fireplace taking up half a wall, opposite from her floor to ceiling bookshelves that took up the entirety of the wall. Her desk was enormous to the points where it was almost comical but overall anything smaller wouldn’t have fit the palatial space. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As the workweek came to end during a sunny afternoon ( per the enchanted window), she looked at her already extensive to-do list for the following week and sighed. Smoothing down her favorite deep crimson pencil skirt and slipping on her black patent leather heels from under her desk, she stepped outside the office to ask her secretary if there - </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her secretary, a young witch hardly out of Hogwarts was currently occupied but </span>
  <em>
    <span>someone. </span>
  </em>
  <span>A tall blonde someone who was leaning on her desk, cheek resting on his fist. The witch was wide eyes and infatuated, knocking an empty teacup, an inkpot, and several quills off in the process of trying to find a way to hold herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Malfoy. What do you want?”  she snapped. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stood slowly, giving the other witch one last wink and straightened his robes. Even though they were his preferred all-black work robes, the way the garments were tailored to his frame was just...</span>
  <em>
    <span>unfair.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Really the younger witch hadn’t stood a chance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There were some last-minute changes to the fiscal year budget I was hoping you’d sign off on, Minister. “  His sharp gaze flicked over her form standing in the doorway and she didn’t miss the way his throat bobbed when he got to her legs.  “It’ll only be a moment of your time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione tilted her head into the office. “Come on then I’m busy. “  He was behind her in two strides, placing a piece of parchment into her outstretched hand.  Pacing around the room, she scanned the numbers, frowned and looked up. “This is the same budget I approved last time. “</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was locking the door and silencing the room. “I know. I had to see if the rumors were true, and they are. “  He slipped his wand into his robe pocket. “You’re wearing that fucking skirt again. “ Grey eyes flicked over her and his mouth pulled into a tight line. “It was being </span>
  <em>
    <span>discussed</span>
  </em>
  <span> by two wizards in front of me in line to get lunch.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She perched herself on the edge of the desk, crossing her legs at the knee and folding her arms across her chest.  “ Again, I’m busy. What’s your point?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With slow yet deliberate movements, he unhooked the buttons at the end of each sleeve and carefully rolled up his elbows. Heat pulsed between her thighs and she licked her bottom lip in anticipation for what was going to come next. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What did I say would happen the next time I saw you wear that thing?” he didn’t look up at her, instead shrugged off his outer robe and hung it up on the hangers next to the Floo. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You said that you’d have to punish me and then fuck me where I stood. You said that you’d ruin any other man for me and I’d better decide if it was worth it. “ She swallowed hard, trying not let her voice betray her excitement. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He crossed the room and finally met her eye. His pupils were blown, drowning out all the grey in his irises. Gripping her chin lightly while stroking the skin with the pad of his thumb he smirked. “I’ve come to keep my promise.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Their mouths crashed together in a frenzied symphony of movements. His tongue invaded her mouth as her fingers tangled in his hair scraping at his scalp, earning her the first break in his mask as he groaned into her. His fingers were making quick work of her blouse while his knee pushed her legs apart. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Draco. “ she gasped as he trailed down her neck, sucking on the sensitive skin with almost painful pressure. Both of his hands were prying her legs further apart, rucking the skirt up. “Don’t leave a mark, I have a thing tonight. Also, I have a meeting in-  “ She looked at her clock on shelves “10 minutes. You have 9 I need to put myself back together- “ she was cut off by the pressure of his hands gripping her hips and flipping her over on the desk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Grip the edge of the desk and don’t move your fucking hands. “ he growled, tugging on the obnoxiously tiny zipper of the skirt.  “Your arse looks magnificent in this and I suspect you know this. “ The zipper gave way and the fabric pooled at her feet. “But no one else gets to see you like this, no one else - “ he made a strangled choking sound “Witch you </span>
  <em>
    <span>are</span>
  </em>
  <span> trying to kill me.”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like them?” her knickers were a white scrap of fabric that concealed nothing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Very much so. You knew exactly what would happen. “ Draco pulled the knickers down, letting them pool with the skirt.  “ and you did it anyway. “  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before she could respond, his hand came down on fleshy part of her arse, making her hiss at the sudden sting of pain, but his other hand caressed her thighs, sliding up just shy of where she wanted his touch the most, making her whimper and arch her back up further. He landed another blow on the opposite side.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She keened as the pain turned in a jolt of pleasure up her spine, surely sending a fresh wave of arousal to her core. One hand soothe the burn on her arse and the other </span>
  <em>
    <span>finally </span>
  </em>
  <span>found its way up to her clit, making identical circles to the backside. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He kicked her feet even wider as her thighs shook with the need for more.  The metallic clink of a belt buckle made her bit her lip to quell the anticipation. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Keep holding on to the desk. “ </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He impaled his length into her in one smooth thrust. She heard him groan as he stilled inside her, dragging himself out slowly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Draco…” she hardly recognized her own lust-fueled cry, shocked at her needy her voice sounded. It must have stirred something in him too because his next thrusts were a sharp snap of his hips, burying all of himself inside her sopping cunt.  One finger swirled on her clit as all her attempt at speech became breathy gasps against the coil low in her belly tighten with each snap, screaming at her to keep going, she needed, </span>
  <em>
    <span>she needed - </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His fingers picked up speed, and his finger curled against her hip bones. Her pebbled nipples rubbed against the fabric of her bra and the wood of the desk. Turning her head as much as she could manage, she could see Draco, eyes closed and face contorted in pleasure and the image sated the last thing she needed before the coil snapped loose and her vision went white.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t move,” he whispered pulling out her.  “ You’re mine, this arse, this pussy, this mine. Other people- “ he cut himself off with strangled grunt  “aren’t supposed to think about having what’s mine. My beautiful...my little cum slut. Mine. “ She felt the hot sticky liquid hit her arse, her thighs and her still wet cunt.  Turning her head again she glimpsed him staring at her like he wanted to commit the scene in front of him to memory. It made her own ego sing to know he was looking at </span>
  <em>
    <span>her,</span>
  </em>
  <span> splayed out on her desk like this, like she was the most precious thing in the world. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t move. “ He repeated and with a flick of wandless magic, Hermione’s knickers and skirt were back on and Draco was grinning like the cat who just caught the canary.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stood up and scrambled for her wand. “ Draco this is going to leave a stain- “</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then you better go home and change. “ he was securing his sleeves back around his wrists with more wandless magic. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“ I don’t have time. “</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you don’t?” he feigned ignorance. She had her wand ready when he grabbed her wrist. “ Don’t clean it up. Leave it and think about this. Think about us. “ He gave her the lightest kiss on her forehead. “I’ll see you at the thing tonight. “. Sliding on his outer robe back on, he opened the door and strode away, leaving Hermione to flick her wand at her buttons and hair to put herself back together quickly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She took a steadying breath and ready herself mentally for her next meeting. Her revenge would just have to wait until tonight. </span>
