          <div class="userstuff"><p>Reader's Notes: I wanna apologize up front for the minor changes in volume and accent, because I recorded this over the span of a few days and I for the love of god, don't know how to do accents, especially scottish accents. If you're scottish, I hope you don't feel personally insulted.<br/>
Also, this is the longest podfic I have ever done, and I was damn close to throwing myself out the window editing this because I apparently can't talk properly.<br/>
I hope you enjoy it anyway and go to drop a kudos on tamers account if you like the fic and maybe even here if you liked the podfic.<br/>
