    <p>“NO! It can’t be true!!” Bella stared at her husband, aghast. “You’ve heard wrong.”</p><p>“I assure you,” Rodolphus told her, “that it is correct. The Dark Lord has fallen.”</p><p>“But how?” Bella’s voice was little more than a whisper.</p><p>Rodolphus shook his head. “No one seems to know. He went to the Potters’ on the spy Pettigrew’s information, and he never came out. Neither did they, but no one knows what happened to the Dark Lord.”</p><p>Bella went pale. “No one knows? But … but … he is infallible! He cannot be defeated!”</p><p>Rodolphus shook his head. “It would appear that he in fact can be defeated. Snape says there wasn’t even a body. He’d just – disappeared.”</p><p>“Snape!” Bella spat the name out with distaste. “He’s just a child! Barely out of his teens. What can he know?”</p><p>“He was there,” Rodolphus said. “Not at the time, but shortly afterwards. Remember, he desired the Potter girl?”</p><p>A gleeful smile flashed across Bella’s face. “And she’s dead? Good. Snape is getting too close to the Dark Lord, it will do him good to have things go against him for a while.”</p><p>“While I don’t disagree,” Rodolphus said evenly, his eyes boring into her, “we must remember that with the Dark Lord gone – yes, gone – things have gone against us as well.”</p><p>Bella sank to the floor in despair. If this was true, as impossible as it seemed to be, then everything she believed in, everything she had fought for, was gone. She had gone as far as anyone and further than most to obtain the Dark Lord’s favour, had been promised a post as lieutenant once the war was over and the Dark Lord was in his rightful position as leader of the wizarding world. But now, it seemed, there was nothing left of that dream, and all her hopes had vanished with it.</p><p>“One thing,” Rodolphus was saying over her inner turmoil, “that surprised everyone even more, was that the Potter boy survived. The child.”</p><p>Bella looked up, her senses awakened. “The child?” she asked, her gaze sharpening. “He survived? But that was why the Dark Lord went there in the first place! The parents were immaterial, it was the boy who needed to be disposed of.”</p><p>“I know about the prophecy as well as you do, Bella,” her husband said gently. “But again, it appears the Dark Lord failed in that venture. The child lives.”</p><p>“Well, what are we waiting for?” asked Bella, standing up with determination written all over her face. “Let’s go! We need to get to the boy, we need to finish the Dark Lord’s work!”</p><p>“Not so fast.” Rodolphus put a hand on his wife’s shoulder. “Dumbledore –” and he spat the name out with disgust – “has taken him. Word is that the boy has gone to his mother’s sister’s house and is under an enchantment so he cannot be touched.”</p><p>“Dumbledore!” Bella’s treatment of the name had even more violence and vehemence than her husband’s had. “Why did he have to interfere? We should be able to finish the job as the Dark Lord would have wished.”</p><p>“I am afraid, my dear,” Rodolphus said tenderly, putting his arms around her, “that, for the time being, our hands are tied.”</p><p>There was no response, just the shaking shoulders and heaving sobs of his wife as she cried into him. Bella was aware that Rodolphus was probably a little taken aback, as she rarely let her emotions take over like this, but then again she had no idea what to do if this could possibly be true. What she did know, however, was that she was going to find out exactly what had happened, and then extract revenge on whoever was responsible. In light of this impossible news, it was the least she could do.</p>
