    <p>Fenrir inhaled sharply, his working eye scanning the area. Forest: trees, tall grass, rocks, insects, and animals. He growled low in his chest, a deep rumbling vibration that verbalized his frustration. He moved forward, swiftly and near silent. Peeking around the trunk of a large oak tree he saw his prey. That pitiful wolf in wizard’s clothing sitting by the large lake on the school grounds. Alone. Perfect.</p><p> </p><p>Today was a beautiful day. It wasn't too cold, not too warm, and the breeze still carried a hint of winter's chill that made the entire day perfect. They had all agreed to meet here after their respective tasks. James and Sirius were at the Quidditch pitch, Peter was finishing up a detention with McGonagall and Remus was enjoying the few minutes of quiet to catch up on the reading for Slughorn. He wasn't nearly as talented at potions as James and Sirius were, so he needed every advantage he could get.  That was, until a sound echoed off the surface of the lake. His head lifted looking for the source, thinking that maybe Padfoot and Prongs had gotten back early. It wouldn't be the first time that he had been tackled by the bear sized dog. But upon seeing nothing, he frowned and returned to his reading.</p><p> </p><p>Fenrir made sure the coast was clear before leaving the cover of the forest. He moved across the grounds swiftly, the ache in his muscles weren't bothering him as bad when he focused his mind on this delicious prey. The werewolf came to a stop next to the pretend wizard, his heavy boots crushing the grass beneath them. He crouched down beside the seventeen year old, a pleased purr ripping itself from his throat as he spoke, causing his voice to come out deeper, "Hello, Pup."</p><p> </p><p>That voice.... the one that haunted his dreams and dominated his nightmares. Hearing it while he was awake made him jump. He scrambled to his feet, wand out and aimed at Fenrir’s heart. </p><p> </p><p>"What are you doing here?"</p><p> </p><p>"Wooah, now." Fenrir smirked, got to his feet, and held up his hands at chest level in surrender. "No need to be so rash, Little One. I'm just here to <em> talk </em>. You looked so lonely."</p><p> </p><p>"You never want to just <em> talk </em>." Remus snapped back, keeping his wand lifted. He knew Fenrir, he wasn't here without a reason. "And I won't be alone for long. What. Do. You. Want?" The elder of the two smirked, showing elongated canines. He shrugged his shoulders, hands staying up as though to defend himself.</p><p> </p><p>"Just checking on my favorite little Pup. Is that so terrible to do? How did you fare the blood moon? Not too well by the looks of it, hmm?" Remus' grip tightened on his wand before he slowly began to lower it. He didn't put it away, but he wasn't going to get any answer if Fenrir didn't want to give it. </p><p> </p><p>"You didn't come all this way to check up on me, Fenrir." He said softly. Yes he was still sore, still healing. He had refused to let the others be with him for the blood moon. It was too dangerous for them; there was too much that could have gone wrong. He had a new scar cutting across his nose, one that still ached if he slept on its wrong.</p><p> </p><p>"Of course I did." Fenrir’s working eye scanned the area beyond Remus every so often, making sure no one was approaching. He lowered his hands from their defensive position when the younger wolf lowered his wand. "I could smell you from the forest. The blood, the sorrow, the <em> woe is me </em>." He took a step forward, his boots crushing the neatly trimmed grass, leaving marks in their wake. "Such a rare occasion, the blood moon. You're never quite ready for it, are you?" </p><p> </p><p>Remus didn't like Fenrir moving closer so he took one step moving back, his eyes never leaving the man in front of him. It disturbed him that the older wolf could smell him like that and Remus didn't detect him at all. Though, he wasn't able to smell much since he had clawed his face. But each step Fenrir took, he took another back. Where were James and Peter? Where was Sirius? </p><p> </p><p>"So you came all this way to check up on me because the blood moon was three days ago?" He found that hard to believe.</p><p> </p><p>"I was in the area..." Fenrir waved a hand in the air idly. He stopped moving forward when Remus moved back, he just had to be patient. "The pack needs growing, so I was out and about. Scouting the area." His smirk became a smile, showing slightly blood stained teeth. "It's a shame they can't put up anti-werewolf wards because you're taking classes here, Little One. A real shame." </p><p> </p><p>That made his blood drain away from his already pale face, his mind racing. Who had he turned? Where were they now? Was it another child? The thought made him sick, nausea curling in his stomach. </p><p> </p><p>"Who did you turn?" Remus whispered, his fingers tightening on his wand. Why hadn't anyone come outside? Where was everyone? It felt as if the entire world had stopped and he and Fenrir were the only two living beings left. Fenrir moved closer but Remus couldn't move. Not when his mind was scrambling to figure out who his presence had condemned.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, no one. Not yet, Pup. Like I said, I was just scouting. I've got until you graduate." He stepped forward again, inhaling deeply, smelling the fear that was dripping from Remus like sweat. "Everywhere you students get to go, I can go now. It's refreshing, don't you think? Hogsmeade is fair game. The grounds of this castle is wide open to my pack." He spread his arms, motioning to the grounds. "And you can't say anything because you're a wolf too. No hiding behind wards from me, <em> Remus </em>."</p><p> </p><p>Remus tried to stop himself from trembling. He had to tell Dumbledore, McGonagall. Someone. He couldn't put the people of Hogsmeade or the students of Hogwarts in danger. Fenrir was less than a yard away, and Remus couldn't bring himself to move away. If sacrificing himself meant that the others would be safe, then he would do it. In a heartbeat. </p><p> </p><p>"Is that really all you came for?"</p><p> </p><p>"Today?" He arched a brow, far too elegantly and smoothly for someone like him. Fenrir felt that pleased rumble grow in his chest again, a deep sort of purring noise. "No, not today. Like I said, I came to check in on you." He waved his hand again, dismissively, "Blood moon, injuries, and all that."</p><p> </p><p>"Okay, well, I'm fine thanks. You can go now." Before the others get here. Before someone looks out the window and sees them. All it takes is one witness. Just one to recognize Fenrir's face to know what he's here for.  "Next time you could just send an owl." He was standing too close. The deep rumble sounded like the sounds that Padfoot would make when he was relaxed. It made Remus feel equally safe and sick. Fenrir chuckled, a deep and rough sound. He crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p> </p><p>"I don't use your wizard methods of communication, Pup. When I want to speak to someone, I <em> find </em> them." He smiled, those fangs glistening, "And you can be sure that I always find who I want to speak with."</p><p> </p><p>"Don't call me that." Remus snapped, voice barely over a whisper. He couldn't understand it, why it felt like the air was thinner, why it felt like he wanted to move closer to the elder wolf rather than farther away. His knuckles bled white, the uneven wood of his wand digging into his hand. The pain brought some clarity, however it wasn't enough to quell the <em> want </em> rising in him. "And I think you should go now. Before one of the professors see you."</p><p> </p><p>"No one's going to see me. No one's going to see you. I have all the time in the world. I've planned this, <em> Pup </em>." Fenrir tilted his head to the side, nodding subtly at Remus. His voice dropped lower, that rumbling from his chest grew louder. "Drop the wand."</p><p> </p><p>He almost nearly did. His fingers twitched, loosened on the polished holly and Remus couldn't mask his surprise quick enough. What was this? He had never felt the sudden urge to obey anyone like this. He had never thought to find out if there truly was a connection between a werewolf and his sire. A problem that he would rectify immediately. If only Fenrir would <em> leave </em>... </p><p> </p><p>"You <em> planned </em> this?" Remus repeated, heart pounding in his chest, in his ears. In fear or want, he didn't know. He couldn't tell the difference anymore. <em> Where was Sirius? </em></p><p> </p><p>"Of course I planned this, Little One. Have you ever known me not to plan something?" The soft sort of lilt to Fenrir's voice was gone, replaced with something more feral. More instinctual. More wolf. He took another step forward. He bared his teeth and drew his lips back in a snarl; the growl erupting from his throat as he spoke. "Drop. The. Wand."</p><p> </p><p>The wand fell through numb fingers, Remus not even recognizing that they moved until he clutched empty air. But he couldn't move, couldn't even look down to see where it had fallen. He was frozen, trapped in the glowing gaze searing into his own like a deer. Words were gone, thoughts were useless, and there was nothing Remus could do to snap out of it. He had only felt helpless like this on nights of the full moon, just before and after the change. Fenrir knew it. </p><p> </p><p>And Remus hated it.</p><p> </p><p>The single working amber eye looked him up and down. Fenrir purred, "Good. Very good, Pup." He moved forward swiftly, catching the younger wolf's chin in his hand, forcing his head to raise. "And just now... what will you do?" The long claw-like fingernail on Fenrir's thumb pressed harshly to the flesh of Remus' chin, cutting in, drawing blood. "You're pack. You're <em> my </em> pack. You belong under my control." </p><p> </p><p>The touch, the first brush of contact made it so much easier to breathe, like the first gulp of air after breaking the surface of water. The pain only heightened the high and Remus was helpless against the surge. A soft whimper slipped from his lips, his head lifting up to meet the single golden gaze. His legs weren't working, they barely supported his weight but Fenrir had not given him permission to move yet. Somehow Moony understood. Moony knew that Fenrir spoke only the truth. And the wolf, so close to the surface still due to the waning moon, wanting nothing more than to obey.</p><p> </p><p>"Good." Fenrir whispered, low and soft. He forced Remus' head to turn to the side slightly, then back the other way, examining the extensive scarring on his face. So much more so than Fenrir had himself - the only scars one could see on his face were the harsh jagged ones that ruined the vision of his other eye. But Remus had not treated his wolf right. So Remus had paid dearly in body and mind. "Your wolf wants to come home, <em> Remus</em>. I see it there, hiding in your eyes. But is it only that? Or do <em> you </em> want to come home as well?"</p><p> </p><p>It was right there, on his tongue trying to get out. Moony wanted nothing more than to go with him. To go home to be with the pack. Because that's where they belonged. They didn't belong here with humans, locked in chains and in shacks that were too cold for humans to survive in. They were never meant to be alone, and yet Remus refused to let them run free with their own kind. The need curled in his stomach, so much that his hands rose to clench in Fenrir's dirty clothes. </p><p> </p><p>"I...I don't.." His voice shook, his body trembling as he fought to push the wolf back into the recesses of his mind where he belonged. But Remus had never felt power like this. He never felt complete like this before. Fenrir was Alpha, Fenrir was pack. He was <em> home </em> and it felt more complete and <em> right </em> than anything else did.</p><p> </p><p>"You don't?" That soft lilt to the voice was suddenly back, begging to soothe the younger man. Those dirty, sharp claws pierced deeper into soft flesh as Fenrir forced Remus' gaze back up. Back to meet his own. Back to gaze into the milky blind eye and the sparkling amber one. "It sure sounds like you do, though, Pup. Like you're <em> fighting </em> . Haven't you fought all your life? Isn't it time to <em> submit </em>?"</p><p> </p><p><em> Yes. </em> It would be so easy. So easy to just let go and let someone else make the decisions. To not have to worry about getting loose, or being a monster. Fenrir, <em> Alpha </em>, understood. Another whimper pushed past his lips, his fingers tightening on the dirty flannel not to push Fenrir away, but to pull him closer. He smelled of dirt, of sweat and blood and <em> home. </em> </p><p> </p><p>Fenrir was <em> home </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Fenrir purred, deep and low in his chest, once more. He pulled his hand from Remus' chin and moved it to take purchase in his hair. Soft, slightly messy, curled hair was gripped tightly in one hand. Fenrir's other arm wrapped around the younger wolf and pulled him close. He inhaled, smelling the heavy fear give way to more pleasant emotions. Ones that told him that the wolf was, indeed, submitting to him.</p><p>"Very good, Pup. You'll come with me, yes? Your classes are over for the week. I will return you to your peers by the time your classes pick up again next week. You need your education, after all. How does that sound, Little One?"</p><p> </p><p>Remus could barely speak, barely even think with the Alpha, <em> his </em> Alpha so near. It was like the final piece of the puzzle slipping into place. His hands moved to Fenrir's chest so they wouldn't be crushed between their bodies. He needed to fight this. He had to... but it was hard to remember <em> why</em>. He felt his head tilt back with Fenrir's encouragement, baring his throat in submission. Remus fought once, twice before the control snapped. This was right. This was <em> home</em>. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes..." He whispered, eyes closing for a brief moment, overcome with the wolf's pure joy.</p><p> </p><p>"<em> Good </em>." He pulled himself away, breaking himself away from the younger man. Taking one step back toward the forest but not turning away from Remus. He kept their eyes locked. "Come, Pup." He held one hand out for Remus to take. "We need to go to the forest and cross the barrier to apparate to my territory. Leave your things. You won't need them."</p><p> </p><p>Remus' mind was in a fog, he barely knew what his body was doing. But all he knew was that he was going with his Alpha, back to his pack, his <em> home </em>.  Remus stepped forward, his hand sliding into Fenrir's and when the alpha ran, Remus had no trouble keeping up with him.  This was how it was meant to be. Just like this, running wild and free through the woods. He left the Hogwarts grounds without a second glance, drowning in the acceptance, the <em> rightness </em>. This was where he was meant to be. And he never wanted to leave. Upon crossing over the invisible barrier that protected the school grounds, Fenrir pulled Remus tight to his chest. He wrapped his arms around the younger man and let out a possessive growl.</p><p> </p><p>"Hold tight to me, Little One." He closed his eyes and, with side-along apparition, he got the two of them to just outside the border of his pack's territory. He stepped back once more, keeping an eye on Remus. "Just a short walk. And then, you're home."</p><p> </p><p>Remus didn't respond, instead he looked around in an attempt to figure out where he was. They hadn't learned to apparate  just yet. That was supposed to come later in the year. Moony brushed it off as useless, Remus wanted to make sure that he could find this location again. </p>
