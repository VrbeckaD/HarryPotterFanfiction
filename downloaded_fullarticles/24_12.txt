  <strong>Chapter 1 : Discovering The Truth</strong>
</p><hr/><p align="left">Violet Potter had escaped from the muggles within the first week of the summer holidays after her third year was over. She had started to feel strange after a few days and she looked completely different so she decided a visit to Gringotts was in order. As she looked down at her lineage results, she was stunned at what she was seeing. She has always known she wasn't the late Lord and Lady Potter's daughter but to have it confirmed was surprising. She has always been different. She knew she was dark but to see the proof, it gave her a sense of freedom. She has never liked muggles or muggleborns aside from what the Wizarding World believed about her. It turned out, she had been kidnapped just after she was born. She hated that she had been raised in the muggle world and not in the world where she rightfully belonged. She was a dark pureblood witch, the daughter of two of the most notorious Death Eaters around. Lord Rodolphus Corvus LeStrange and Lady Bellatrix Druella LeStrange nee Black. And Violet's real name was Isabella Pandora LeStrange. </p><p align="left">She had been born on October 31, 1980.</p><p align="left">But the most shocking was finding out that Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy were her aunt and uncle along with being her Godparents. She was also the heiress to some surprising families. Magic had declared her so. The families were Potter, Peverell, Gryffindor, Emrys, Black, Ravenclaw, and Le Fay. Isabella was hoping she didn't have to look after all of these estates by herself. That took a lot of time and she wanted to study magic more than anything.</p><p align="left">And as it turned out that the reason she had such a strong connection to Voldemort was due to him being her Soulbonded. That also explained about him disappearing that night. Magic always punished the one who tried to kill or injure their soulbonded with malicious intent. Soulbonded's were sacred in the magical world.</p><p align="left">Anyway, Isabella's whole life was a lie. She had also been abused by the muggles until she turned six-years-old and had enough control of her magic to make them pay. She had made them relive her worst memories and pain along with being starved and beaten as revenge. She had finally said enough. They never bothered her again.</p><p align="left">Now her luck as finally changed for the better.</p><p align="left">Isabella could finally get rid of her tagalongs and switch houses. She could finally be who she really was and stop holding back all she has learned over the years. She was way more advanced than she let on.</p><p align="left">Everyone thought she was ignorant but that couldn't be further from the truth. They also thought she hadn't known about the Chamber of Secrets until her second year at Hogwarts but that wasn't the case. She has known about it since she started at Hogwarts due to her connection with Hogwarts.</p><p align="left">She has been studying everything she could get her hands on since she has known she was a witch. During her first year, she had mastered the first and second-year curriculums with ease. The reason classes and spells have been so easy was due to one of her abilities. She had an eidetic memory. Everything came easy to her.</p><p align="left">Isabella's abilities were cloning, parseltongue, parselmagic, legilimency, occlumency, wandless magic, metamorphmagi, and of course an eidetic memory. She has spent years mastering those skills since she had turned six-years-old. The professors at Hogwarts thought she had been in their classes all of the time but it had only been a clone of herself so she could study in peace without worrying about someone looking over her shoulder.</p><p align="left">Anyway, Isabella mastered the third and fourth-year curriculums in her second year at Hogwarts. The reason she had even saved Ginny Weasley from a young Tom Riddle that year was due to survival. She was not going to take the chance of being made to go back to the muggle world earlier than she wanted. She hadn't even killed the basilisk like she told everyone. She never even stabbed the diary. She managed to convince Tom to go back inside the diary in exchange for her loyalty. He had even taught her to master legilimency and occlumency.</p><p align="left">And in her third year, Isabella mastered the fifth and sixth-year curriculums. She had even mastered two animagus forms. The first one had been a surprise due to the magical creature she had turned into. No one has turned into a magic creature since Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin. From Slytherin's journals, he had written that he had been a basilisk and Godric had been a Gryffin. Anyway, her magical form was a Knight Phoenix. Not many knew that it was a dark phoenix. Everyone thought all Phoenix's were light creatures but there was a balance to maintain so everything had a light and dark side. And her second form was a Vipera Berus, also known as Marlies, Prags, Bardas or the common European adder or common European viper, is a venomous snake that is extremely widespread and can be found throughout most of Western Europe and as far as East Asia.</p><p align="left">This year she was going to start on the seventh year curriculum along with the Grey Arts and Parselmagic. But before all of that, Isabella was going to write to her aunt to see what they wanted to do now that she knows who she really is.</p><p align="left">
  <em>Dear Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy,<br/></em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>I am writing this in blood so you'll know I am being honest with you and not playing a cruel joke. I have just discovered that I was not who I thought I was. You see, after my third year, I started to feel and look different so I arranged a visit at Gringotts to find out what was going on with me and received some surprising results when I did the lineage test. My name is Isabella Pandora LeStrange and up until now, I have been raised in an abusive home in the muggle world. I thought I was a half-blood but as it turns out, I was wrong. The Goblins had told me they have been looking for me all of these years due to being kidnapped.<br/></em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>I know you will be surprised, but I really hope you come to Gringotts to see the proof for yourself. I am very proud of my parents and of you for everything you have done for this world to try and make it better for Purebloods. It's going to be shocking for you when you see me because you have known me by another name for the past fourteen years. I am so relieved that I can finally be myself and not have to hide who I really am. I look a lot like my mother, Bellatrix now that I am no longer under a glamour.<br/></em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>I know my parents are in Azkaban but please let them know I am alive when you can. They need to know I am alive to give them hope because I KNOW that they will be getting out, I just have no idea when. I am so very proud to be their daughter.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>I just ask that the filthy muggles I've been forced to live with get what's coming to them for the way they have treated me. I think they may have known about who I really was with the help of the old man after I was dumped on their doorstep like a piece of trash. There is no way I am letting them get away with that. <br/></em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>I want you to know that I am not asking for anything from you but I do think you should know the truth about me. Aunt Narcissa, I know you are my mother's sister so if you would be so kind as to write me sometime and tell me things about my mother and father I would be greatly appreciative.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>Well, that's all for now I'm sorry to bother you all and thank you for reading my letter.</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>Always,<br/></em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>Isabella LeStrange</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>P.S,<br/></em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>I am at Gringotts if you'd like proof that I am telling the truth.</em>
</p><p align="left">She sent the letter using a Gringotts owl instead of using Hedwig. Hedwig was too noticeable. Everyone in Wizarding Britain knew Hedwig was her familiar.</p><hr/><p align="left">Lucius, Narcissa, and Draco were at Malfoy manor having dinner with there oldest and dearest friend Severus Snape when a Gringotts owl landed on the table in front of Mrs. Malfoy.</p><p align="left">"Well I wonder who this could be from," she said taking the letter and shooing the owl away.</p><p align="left">"Don't know dear why don't you read it," her husband said taking a sip of his whiskey.</p><p align="left">She unrolled the letter and read it to herself. Everyone at the table watched as her eyes got bigger and bigger and tears started to fall down her face. Once she was done she dropped the letter staring at it strangely.</p><p align="left">"Mother are you alright?" Draco asks alarmed by his mother's tears.</p><p align="left">"She's... She's alive, Lucius," she choked out as her husband looked at her concerned.</p><p align="left">"Who Cissa? What did it say?" he asks reaching for the letter but Narcissa snatched it up before he could get it. She read it again this time the tears of sadness turned to pure raged.</p><p align="left">"That filthy old fool! Meddling in other's lives! I'll kill him!" she yelled at no one.</p><p align="left">"CISSA!" her husband yelled trying to get answers. "Who are you going to kill?" he asks.</p><p align="left">"Dumbledore," she spat in disgust. Everyone at the table hated him for something but Narcissa had never threatened to kill him before. Her husband opened his mouth to say something but she cut him off.</p><p align="left">"She's alive Lucius. Alive," she said over and over.</p><p align="left">"Who?" he asked again getting impatient.</p><p align="left">"Isabella," she said looking at the letter. Draco stared at her not knowing who she was talking about but Severus and Lucius knew.</p><p align="left">"WHAT?!" they both said at the same time. She handed over the letter wiping her eyes watching as her husband and there friend read it quickly there eyes and mouth doing the same hers did before.</p><p align="left">"Oh Merlin," Severus whispered.</p><p align="left">"I can't believe it," Lucius said looking back at his wife.</p><p align="left">"Mother. Father, what's going on?" Draco asks.</p><p align="left">"Your cousin is alive honey. Your auntie Bella had a daughter that we all thought died after she was kidnapped. But she's alive and living with filthy muggles. Lucius, we have to get her out of there. She thought she was a Half-Blood up until now. Bellatrix and Rodolphus would be livid. And let's not forget what the Dark Lord would do," Narcissa said in rage.</p><p align="left">"Mother what's the Dark Lord have to do with this?" Draco asks and everyone looked at him.</p><p align="left">"Draco, Isabella's parents performed the soulmate spell on your cousin, and as it turned out, the Dark Lord is her soulmate," Severus told him and he looked at them in shock.</p><p align="left">"What? Did Dumbledore know that when he kidnapped her?" he asks.</p><p align="left">"No one knew aside from the inner circle. You must keep this information to yourself, honey no one can know," his mother told him and he nodded.</p><p align="left">"Cissa, I'll floo the Minister now and see what we can do," Lucius said running to his office and floo-calling Minister Fudge.</p><p align="left">"Don't worry Cissa will get her back," Severus told her handing her a drink to calm down. She may be a nice caring woman most of the time but she was originally a Black family Witch and was fierce when it came to her family. She was scary when mad just like her sister.</p><p align="left">It took an hour but they finally had custody of their niece. They then went to Gringotts to see her lineage results for themselves. When they arrived at the bank, they were stunned that she had been closer than they had thought. Their niece had been known as Violet Potter, they were shocked, then outraged that someone could do that to a child. Just take them away from their family while making everyone believe them to be dead.</p><p align="left">The vowed then and there that Dumbledore would die for everything he had done.</p>
