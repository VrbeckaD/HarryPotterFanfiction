    <p>*~*~* <br/>       “Thee! Thee!” Theseus heard the excited shout and turned away from the set of aurors he’d been debriefing in the bullpen outside of his office just in time to catch the little boy flying toward him. Shattering his stern, no-nonsense persona by breaking into a wide grin, he tossed the child lightly up into the air, making him squeal happily.</p><p>      “Hello there, little man! What’re you doing here? Where’s your mum? Surely she didn’t just let you loose on the building?” Looking over Cree’s head, his eyes scanned the hallways for his sister or his brother-in-law, frowning when he didn’t see either of them.</p><p>       “Mama missed the box,” Cree explained, “Pickett was h’ving a tantrum ‘n she didn’t see the gb’lin and run into him.”</p><p>       “And you didn’t wait for her?”</p><p>       Cree looked sheepish, his cheeks going a little pink as his fingers played with the buttons at Theseus’s throat, carefully not meeting his uncle’s gaze. “I wanted to see you. And there was shouting.”</p><p>       “Enough said, poppet,” Theseus gentled his tone and pressed a kiss to Cree’s temple before turning back toward his men, who were looking at him as if he’d been replaced with someone else. “Off with you lot. Ryan, I expect to have that report by the end of the day, and for Merlin’s sake, Addison, close your mouth before you catch flies. It’s like you’ve never seen a kid before.”</p><p>       Turning his attention back to Cree, he said conspiratorially, “I’ve got some sugar biscuits in my office, the ones with ginger and chocolate you like so much. You want some?”</p><p>       Artemis tried to keep their sugar intake to a minimum, so any kind of sweet treats were treated like gold, and the little boy’s face lit up. The mention of the biscuits did the trick and made Cree relax back into his usual happy chatter. For the most part, his former life was nothing but a foggy record in a box somewhere, but the little one still had moments where it reared up. He hated raised voices and would get very quiet and still if there was any sort of heat behind it. Art had confided that he still had some nasty nightmares and couldn’t sleep in the dark. Any kind of extreme temperature would put him off, resulting in a sullen, almost frightened disposition, as if he were waiting for someone to get angry and strike out. Cold was the worst of it, and his parents were careful to keep him wrapped in warming charms through the dreary winter months.</p><p>       He was slurping up a cup of hot chocolate and sorting through crumbs, all the while talking Theseus’s ear off about their upcoming ‘Sc’lnd’ trip, when a red-faced and harried Artemis hurried through his door.</p><p>       “Lord and Lady, what a nightmare. One would think that the goblins would be a bit more forgiving! I apologized, and tried to set things right, but you’d have thought I tried to murder him with the way he was carrying on.” She noticed the chocolate and biscuits, and Theseus saw the momentary cringe flash through her eyes before it dissipated just as quickly as it came. No doubt she was thinking of the sugar rush followed by the inevitable grumpy crash. He felt no shame, whatsoever. It was an uncle’s prerogative to sugar them up before handing them back.</p><p>       “I see you found your uncle well enough without me,” Artemis grinned at her son, reaching out to stroke his hair lightly. She and Percival were letting him explore his boundaries without them hanging over his shoulder at all times. It was difficult sometimes, being that there were very real dangers and they both had seen more than their share of awfulness. It varied from situation to situation, like here at MOM, Art had seen him dart into the elevator with the operator and at least two of Theseus’s aurors, so she knew it would stop at her brother’s floor. Cree was a very sharp child with instincts that were almost too developed for a boy his age. It broke her heart a little that it mostly had to do with his former existence. Some things would probably never change, and while it relieved her to know that he had more defensive skills up his sleeve than a normal little one, it was still sad to think of where he’d carried it from.</p><p>      “Thee gave me biscuits,” Cree pointed out gleefully, then held out the last half of the remaining biscuit for her to take. Her heart melting at his generosity, she took it with a bright smile, though the edges were a bit mangled.</p><p>       “Thank you, darling,” she said and delicately popped it in her mouth. That, right there was a huge indication that motherhood had changed his sister in a significant way. Theseus had never seen her take half-eaten food from anyone. She’d done some strange things to get her creatures to eat, but when it came to other humans, she wasn’t as keen. It had been funny when they were kids and anyone had offered her a bite of something, her nose had scrunched up just so and she’d politely turned it down, no matter what it was. He had a feeling that if he were to do the same exact thing, she’d look at him like he was mad. This was only for Cree, to make him more comfortable and not turn her nose up at anything the little boy offered. Affection swelled his chest and Theseus cleared his throat against the lump.</p><p>       “So, what do I owe this unannounced visit,” he asked, “Not that I mind seeing two of my favorite people, but you don’t normally just pop in.”</p><p>       “We came to take you to tea.” Artemis carefully avoided his eyes, her cheeks going suspiciously pink. “We’ve got some news.”</p><p>       Eyes narrowing, Theseus looked between her and Cree, who was eyeing the biscuit tin with hopeful eyes and kicking feet. “All right,” he said warily, “I’ve always got time for tea. Where’s Percy?”</p><p>        “He’s… he’ll be meeting up with us later for dinner.” That wasn’t suspicious, at all. But she wasn’t in tears, and Cree wasn’t acting off, so he’d hold off on thinking murder on his brother-in-law. “I thought we could go to McCleary’s. I haven’t had their pie in a very long time, and I promised Cree a taste of their ice cream.”<br/>  Cree beamed up at him, “Mama said they have chocolate dragons!”</p><p>        Theseus laughed and shook his head, “I’d forgotten about those blasted things. Didn’t they nearly ban them after the charm nearly charred the place to ruin?”<br/>  Artemis shook her head, “Allie fixed it so that they don’t actually breathe fire. It’s just lights and smoke now.”</p><p>        “Well, let me clear my books really quick and we can make an afternoon of it, yeah? It’s not every day you lot come around.”<br/>  Artemis took the chance to clean up the chocolate mess on her son’s face while Theseus spoke with his secretary, who was eyeing them with a curious glare once her boss turned back around to swing Cree up onto his shoulders. It was strange, but Artemis didn’t pay it any mind as she followed behind, making sure Pickett wasn’t poking his head out of her pocket again. That’s how the earlier trouble started in the first place, and she’d rather not have a repeat performance.</p><p>        By the time they’d gotten to the pub, Theseus was a little worried about exactly what kind of ‘news’ his sister was going to impart. Visions of dangerous expeditions and instructions on how to care for Cree if she and Percival were to get eaten by some exotic beast no one had ever heard of, ran through his mind. He was lining up every argument he could think of in a short amount of time, as well as a head of steam about his brother-in-law and broken promises to keep Art out of life-threatening situations.</p><p>        When they’d taken their seats, placed orders, and got Cree settled in with a coloring paper and muggle crayons, Artemis slid a parchment across the table toward him. She nervously tucked a loose curl behind her ear and smiled at the girl that brought their tea. He read the simple message three times before it sank in, and he broke out into a grin. <em>‘Will you do us the honor of being the godfather to our newest addition? Date of arrival- late May. We couldn’t think of anyone more deserving or trusted.’</em></p><p>        Surging to his feet, he rounded the table and pulled Artemis out of her chair so he could gather her up and swing her around, laughing in relief. “I thought you were going to tell me you were off to Peru, hunting something with nasty teeth and flesh-melting venom!”</p><p>         “What?” Artemis burst into laughter, swatting at his chest when he finally let her down. “No! Well, not for a while yet. The dangerous adventuring will have to wait.”</p><p>        “Your definition of dangerous differs greatly from mine, sister. But yes, I’d love to be the godfather to the newest hatchling.”</p><p>        Cheeks pink with pleasure, Artemis couldn’t contain her grin when Cree joined in the hug, wrapping his arms around one of Theseus’s legs, and one of hers, his face beaming up at them. Theseus scooped him up and swirled him around quickly, before asking, “What do you think of all this, Cree? A new brother or sister is a lot of responsibility. Are you ready for it?”</p><p>        Cree nodded his head vigorously, his eyes wide and earnest. “I am, Thee, I am! Papa says I’m gonna be the best.”</p><p>        “Just like your uncle, then,” Artemis commented softly, and Theseus couldn’t help the rush of pride that swelled his chest. He looked at her for a moment with suspiciously shiny eyes, then drew her in with one arm to crush the two of them together in another hard embrace. Cree squealed in delight and wrapped his arm around his mum.</p><p>        “You do know that I’m going to give your husband a hard time, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p></p><div>
  <p>*~*~*</p>
</div><div>
  <p><br/>         Back at his office, he saw his sister off to Diagon Alley to meet her husband and find their lodgings with a kiss to her forehead and a hair ruffle for Cree. They were going to meet up again later that evening for dinner, and he was looking forward to giving Percy a hard time before taking the other man out for a few drinks to celebrate. Artemis was fine with it, as long as there were no fights or dueling. She just said that if they got in trouble, they could sort it out themselves, because she wasn’t being drug up out of bed at Merlin knows when to bail them out.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>         His secretary was giving him an odd look as he paused to take any messages, but he shrugged it off and went about his business. But when Tina arrived to knock on his door a while later, he was bewildered when she smirked at him and asked about the ‘mysterious woman’ that had come to take him for tea. She’d been out on an assignment when Artemis had come through, otherwise she would have been invited along; as it was, she wasn’t even aware that her friends were in town as yet.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>         “What are you on about,” Theseus demanded, reaching out for the steaming mug Tina was holding out to him.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>        </p>
</div><div>
  <p>          “Everyone’s all in a titter about this woman and little boy that made the boss act all human,” Tina teased, the humor in her dark eyes telling him that she knew exactly who it was and hadn’t done a bloody thing to sort out her fellow aurors. It was their own damn fault for not paying attention. “This incredibly tall, awkward, but gorgeous woman that their boss ushered away before they could get any sort of information about.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>          Theseus rolled his eyes. “I really need a new bunch of aurors. Maybe a training seminar on observational skills is in order, yeah?”</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>          “So, what is Art and company up to now? Are they staying in London for any length of time?” Tina took a seat in the chair across from Theseus’s desk and nursed her own cup. The American auror had thrived here at MOM, taking a place among his people with a new attitude and pride in herself and her skills. It really helped that she hadn’t had to work too hard to prove herself, being actively recruited by someone she admired and thought of as a friend. London had been good for her and her sister, Queenie going all in to work with her new husband on the bakery.<br/>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>           Jacob had been in utter awe over the magical community here, where he wasn’t necessarily unwelcome. He wasn’t completely welcome either, but with his bubbly personality and overall good-guy energy, the locals were coming around. It helped that they were in the process of expanding and opening yet another bakery, this one in the heart of Diagon Alley, where the first was in London proper. The permits for that had been a bloody nightmare to procure, but Theseus was annoyingly persistent, and Jacob’s creations had spoken for him in the end.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>        </p>
</div><div>
  <p>          The minister had been swayed by the niffler pasty when it was all said and done, and with a promise of unlimited access to the menu whenever he felt like it, the older man was finally sold. It was the kind of tongue-in-cheek harmless bribery Theseus was okay with.<br/>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>         “So, when is Roman coming back into town,” Tina asked after a few moments of talking about Artemis, Percival, and their stay in London. “Speaking of love interests.”<br/>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>         “He’s coming in tomorrow or the next day,” Theseus answered, completely unaware of the dopey smile that crossed his face at the mention of the Romanian man he’d met at his sister’s wedding. They had hit it off in a spectacular way and had exchanged letters after spending nearly a week together. He’d found out that Roman was a dragon handler at the reserve in Romania, which didn’t surprise him in the least, knowing Artemis. Of course, she’d be close with someone who worked with the bloody things. The dark-haired man was just as mad as she was, only on a more localized level.<br/>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>         “Oh, sir, you are in so much trouble, aren’t you?” Tina looked a little too gleeful as she grinned and got to her feet.<br/>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>         “What?”<br/>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>         “Tell Roman I said hi, and hopefully we can all get together while everyone’s here, okay?”<br/>  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>          “Sure, fine. What do you mean, I’m in trouble?” Theseus called out to her, but she waved at him and laughed as she went out the door. “Goldstein!”</p>
