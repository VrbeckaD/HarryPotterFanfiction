  <span>Imagine it, power swirls all around you, it grants you the abilities to create, morph and destroy. All of it is gathering up in the center of your soul — this power has responsibility that you must channel — it is called magic. If you had the power to create, would you create your own treasure? If you had the power to destroy, would you use it to protect only yourself? If you had the power of knowledge, would you keep it to yourself?And, if you had the power to love… would you smother them…? Would you only make them-the-being that holds your heart in their hands, become locked up in a cage to be only yours?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once upon a time, lived a man who had everything he could desire, he held the world in his hands. Accompanied with three other mages the world turned all eyes onto the quartet as they held in their hands traits of true power; Ambition, Bravery, Loyalty, and Wisdom. Ambition strived for excellence and had strict beliefs and standards that were to be met in accordance of so. Bravery was a gallant man who wanted to protect the world and be a hero, he had no set standards except for one rule, “You must have great courage to be a hero, do not doubt anyone of their capabilities unless their wear their heart on their sleeve.” Loyalty was a patient woman who accepted all and had a heart of gold. Wisdom was a seldom lady, she had class and elegance with each step she took, her philosophy was that all power came from knowledge, to know the strength you must learn it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of all the founders, each held to themselves a secret. Ambition hid himself a small angel, his love and heart was hidden away and kept safe in a golden cage that would be worn around his neck. Bravery held remorse and put up a strong front, as he had lost everything to become who he wanted to be, rejected and disowned was his past, love and freedom was his future, broaden in his sword was etched the name of his lover, his prince. Loyalty held her kindness due to loss, she was barren, she was loyal and caring to all around her because she desired closure but could never truly receive it, her pain immortal and her sorrows trapped in her treasures, all cursed, but one would have her pride, the one thing she cast away. Wisdom, she used to rule a kingdom, overcome by those who detested her and burned down her faith and hope, tied to a stake and cursed away from her own land, she locked away all of her feeling that would steer her away from her true path, her emotions and memories were cast away into the one thing that connected herself to the past, a shining shimmering crown.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Darkness gloomed in all of their hearts, and with that darkness were the light and truth that resided in their past sins and memoirs. Life was precious to them, it always would be. Only to the descendants of Salazar would it be seen as worthless. But by that time those relics of lost time would be broken, the treasures of past once destroyed were tossed aside. From those broken pieces came out memories. Memories of the past in a physical form - bodies.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And once broken...They are corrupted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Antagonists in a new age, broken heroes of a tortured past.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Truth of Legends is revealed, the truth of the founders is broadcasted, not only does history crumble… The mirror of their stories… is shattered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Death looked upon these little gems with a sharp gleam of mischief in his eyes, he was getting bored of watching the last play through of his little master playing around in his tutorial world, and now, he would drop his good fated friend from his demo, to the full version, where new scripts, adventures, and characters awaited him.</span>
