    <p>Hi my name is Takashi Sven Kuron Kuro Ryou Shirogane and I have short ebony black hair with a white tuff (that’s how I got my name) and balck eyes liek my soul and a lot of people tell me I look like Bruce Lee (AN: if u don’t know who he is get da hell out of here!). [[I’m not related to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he’s a major fucking hottie. I’m a vampire but my teeth are straight and white. I have skin. I’m also a pilot wizard, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in Space where I’m in the seventh year (I’m seventeen). I’m a goth (in case you couldn’t tell) and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a tight black shirt that professor Coran made me wear. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside the Hogwarts Castle of lions. We were in space so there was n o sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of aliens stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.</p><p>“Hey Shiro!” shouted a voice. I looked up. It was…. Slav!</p><p>“What’s up slav?” I asked.</p><p>“Nothing.” he said shyly.</p><p>But then, I heard my friends call me and I had to go away.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>AN: IS it good? PLZ tell me fangz!</p>
