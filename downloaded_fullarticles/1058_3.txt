    <u>Prologue</u>

</p><p> </p><p>         Severus found himself pacing his office yet again in anxious contemplation. There had already been so many shifts within the last year alone, and yet, he knew this shift would ultimately come he just didn’t know how to face it. Severus Snape was not a man who often allowed himself to wallow in his own emotion, it was easier to store it away and take it out when it was most convenient for himself than to face it head on. However, every now and again he found himself faced with moments where storing his sentiments away for a more appropriate time unviable; such as now.</p><p> </p><p>The Hogwarts professor knew time was closing in on all of them, and not just himself. He knew the time for any sort of action was becoming smaller and more minuscule at every moment. Severus had long stopped caring for his own outcome but spent many anxious moments of late pacing with apprehension over the outcome of those he cared about most, as unfeeling as he hoped to make himself seem to the people who continuously surrounded him.</p><p> </p><p>Severus’s mind continued to shift from Albus, to Potter, and then back to Draco who was incessantly the primary anxiety that plagued him on a daily basis. The boy was someone he saw himself in, unlike Potter who was wholly like his own father; arrogant, assertive. Severus knew how Draco portrayed himself, not unlike himself he put out to the world a defense to keep everyone shut out, to only allow people to see what he wanted them to. He knew that Draco’s time was up, he was about to take the dark mark, and become a servant to the Dark Lord. He knew Draco wasn’t ready, he would never fully be ready for what Voldemort, his family, and his name asked of him. And he wasn’t so sure he could stand idly by and let the boy shatter his world, and possibly die in the process.</p><p> </p><p>Severus stopped pacing abruptly and sat down at this desk, folding his hands and placing them gently atop the apex. He let his mind travel back to his most recent discussion with the Headmaster, and how he’d explained why Potter must return to the Dursley’s each summer despite the Order’s desire for him to stay at the headquarters’; feeling that it was safer, and alleviated the need for guards in Little Whinging each night. He idly wished that there was some place Draco could go to receive the same kind of protection from the Dark Lord. He raked his fingers through his long unctuous hair in frustration, leaning his forehead down onto his desk.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, Severus’s head shot back up in realization. He was apt at charms, surely there was a way to bind Draco to the Potter boy, although, he knew neither would comply willingly, no. Of course, it would have to be done with much finesse, he knew the headmaster would not be too keen on his irrational and plainly selfish plot. Conversely, it didn’t seem to matter to the potions master how any of the parties affected might feel about his plot to keep young Draco safe from the Dark Lord’s plans, it did not seem significant enough that both boys clearly loathed one another, or that Dumbledore would be less than pleased at how this might hugely complicate his own intricate design of Potter’s function in his own scheme against Voldemort’s downfall.</p><p> </p><p>He thought deeply for a moment at his own implication in this scenario he’d constructed, he knew Albus would be surprised, maybe even slightly annoyed with him but he could not see any catastrophic outrage over Severus’s decision. He knew with time Draco would forgive him, and maybe even learn to understand why he had to do it and he was honestly least concerned with the slight nuisance this would be to him and to Potter. Ultimately, he needed to consider how this might affect his relationship with the Dark Lord. He needed to devise a scenario that would not implicate him in the extraction of Draco. He knew that if he was suspected in the disappearance of the boy the Dark Lord would be ruthless, and he knew the role he played was one of importance. If the Order was to prevail, he would be needed, and with this new narrative he knew he would in turn have to make a large sacrifice to Voldemort to deepen his trust in the spy.</p><p> </p><p>Without a second thought he knew he was set; his mind would not change. Now all he had to do was consider the how, and the rest would come easily enough. Armed, and ready to take on the consequences knowing there were only a few weeks before each boy would be on the Hogwarts express headed away from the castle for the summer, Severus contrived a plan.</p>
