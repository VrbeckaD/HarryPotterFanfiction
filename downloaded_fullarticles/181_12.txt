    <p>Prologue<br/>
Hope Sawyer woke on the bright Wednesday morning to the chirping of a rather large bird outside her window. She sat up in bed, said her morning prayers, and quietly shuffled down the stairs, as not to wake her sister Rey. She was greeted, as always, by her doting mother, Evan, who was reading a newspaper, and her father Jack as he cooked breakfast. Her sleepy sister wandered dryly down the stairs and said a faint “Morning” before plopping down at the kitchen table and burying herself in a book as usual. Jack and Hope served breakfast, and everyone ate while casually chatting about the day to come. All was normal.<br/>
Little did the Sawyers know that this morning, of all mornings to come in the future, could very well be the most abnormal morning.<br/>
Evan began to pack up her belongings to head to work when she heard the mail slot produce a sound that unlike to other: they had mail. Hope hurried to grab the bundle of letters, bills, notices, and postcards from her aunt on vacation. She quickly rifled through them and noticed something very unexpected… there was a letter for her. She took in the crisp parchment and Ruby red lettering. She found it very odd the way her address was listed… “Hope Sawyer, Number 15 Moonlight Drive, The Second largest bedroom, Surrey.”  The second largest bedroom was her bedroom, but how had the sender known that? Curious, she wandered into the kitchen and showed it to her parents. They gazed at the letter with the same curiosity as Hope had before. “Well open it already!” Rey exclaimed, looking up from her book. Sometimes her 8 year old logic came in handy.<br/>
Hope carefully pulled apart the red wax seal on the back. She pulled out three sheets of paper. She skimmed one, but was confused. She tried another. Worse. Taking a deep breath, she read the last paper. She let out a slow, silent breath as she got to the end. She let out a happy bit perplexed smile as she faced her parents.<br/>
“Hogwarts.” She breathed. Her parents looked at each other, confused.<br/>
“What?!” They said in unison. Somewhere in the background, Rey groaned.<br/>

As these events took place, a very different morning went on, across the country.<br/>
Aria Rookwood was awoken by Gorn, her family’s house elf. He tapped lightly on her door to wake her, and brought her in a tray of breakfast foods. He bowed and left, leaving Aria alone. She picked up her hairbrush and pulled out all of the knots that had developed in the night. She watched herself in the mirror as the did this, studying her broad shoulders and tan skin. Her electric blue eyes pierced her reflection as she set the brush down. Turning, she thrust open the blinds and let the brilliant sunshine into her room. She loved the way everything glowed when the sunlight hit it just right. She smiled as she watched an owl fly by her window towards the door.<br/>
An owl.<br/>
She had been waiting weeks for her letter. Maybe, this was it. She heard her name called from below her, presumably the kitchen. She raced downstairs, but every step seemed to happen in slow motion.<br/>
This was it. Sink or swim.<br/>
She reached the front hall and saw her father standing by the door. He turned slowly. In his right hand was a crisp parchment with emerald green lettering. Aria reached for the letter and her father handed it to her. She skimmed the page, anxious. Finally, she smiled. “Yes.” Her father smiled back, a rare occurrence. “Welcome to Hogwarts, Aria.” He paused. “I never doubted you.”<br/>
And so the girl who never hugged her father was embraced, and the girl who was never not embraced for once stood on her own. Little did the two know, was that their fates were… crossed.</p>
