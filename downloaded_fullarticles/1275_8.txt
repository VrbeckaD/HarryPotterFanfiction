    <p>
  <span>Ever since he was a young boy, Lucius had been taught the importance of siring an heir. Not only the importance of siring an heir, but siring the </span>
  <em>

  </em>
  <span> heir. He’d been paired off with the Black family, specifically the youngest of the sisters, Narcissa. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They’d come to an agreement upon meeting each other at Hogwarts, that they would produce the perfect heir for their respective parents. They’d also agreed that their son would be the perfect pureblood, and when the day came for him to produce his own heir, everything would be as it should be. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucius and Narcissa were far from a loving couple, but they took their jobs as Draco’s parents very seriously. That’s not to say that they didn’t love each other. Lucius loved Narcissa for being the mother she was to his child, and Narcissa loved Lucius for always being fiercely protective of his family and their image; a sentiment she returned with vigor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unfortunately, despite how protective they were over Draco, they couldn’t have protected him from the horror show that was Astoria Greengrass. She was as un-Malfoy-ish as it was possible to be. She had no respect for her family name, or, it seemed, the pureblood community as a whole. She had no urgency for producing an heir, she threw frequent tantrums, and, unlike the rest of their peers, she had an art of making old money look gauche.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was their new goal to either a, get Draco out of the marriage contract, or b, kill her the moment they produced an heir.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco was strongly in favor of the prior; as he had no desire to lay with her. He also believed, as did most of Hogwarts, that she'd broken the contract by being unfaithful. It was in all respectable household's contract that until an heir is born they must share no other's bed than their betrothed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Draco had made his decision plain that he'd rather not be wed to the beast, Lucius and Narcissa had been more than pleased to postpone the union. They were hard at work searching for evidence to prove Greengrass' breach of contract.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Father," Draco sighed. “Despite Astoria's complete lack of maternal desire, she will not stop pushing for the wedding to be as soon as possible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We will figure this out my son,” Lucius frowned, stroking Draco’s locks out of his face. They sat in Lucian’s office as a family. Lucius could breathe easy in these times. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She won’t have you,” Narcissa sighed, shaking her head as she shook the Daily Prophet open and continued reading. “She doesn’t deserve to be blue.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mother!” Draco gawked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucius chuckled at his wife’s crass words. No matter how elegant and graceful Narcissa presented herself, she couldn’t fully cover her Black family blood. She wasn’t mad like her sister, but rather she had a sharp temper and an affinity towards foul language; Lucius loved this, too, about her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was, of course, referring to the fact that when a pureblood becomes pregnant they are alerted to this fact by glowing bright blue for several hours.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All three of them hissed as a twinged of pain coursed through their forearms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Our Lord,” Draco said redundantly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let us not keep him waiting,” Lucius sighed, standing to offer Narcissa a hand up. She accepted, smiling softly. It was a softness that she only showed in the presence of her family. Lucius had earned that softness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He led his family downstairs. Draco walked in their wake, his hesitance in the Dark Lord’s presence was only natural in the beginning. He was learning, Lucius smiled to himself. One day, he was sure, Draco would be the first in line to have the Dark Lord’s ear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had been months since the Dark Lord stationed himself and the Death Eaters in their home. This, of course, was a great honor. When Draco had succeeded in killing Dumbledore, just five months prior, they had redeemed their name in his ranks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In truth, Draco had been unable to go through with the act, but, ever-present in his role, Lucius had stepped forward and done the deed. As only he, Bellatrix, the LeStrange brothers, and Severus were privy to this information, they had all agreed it was best that Draco gets the credit for the kill. It was a secret they seven (Lucius couldn’t not tell Narcissa) would take to their graves.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, Malfoys,” Voldemort leered as they entered the hall, “There you are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My Lord,” they said as one, dipping their heads in respect. The other Death Eaters already sitting around the table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have a gift for you,” Voldemort announced. “A great reward for your service young Draco.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucius noticed Draco’s jaw twitch as he nodded, accepting the praise. “This is most generous of you my Lord,” Draco smirked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For you to use at your will, I present to you, the precious boy who lived.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucius could hear Draco’s gasp, as his own throat went dry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come,” the Dark Lord called, and just like that, the dark-haired boy was there before them; Severus by his side, though not controlling him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s under the influence of an Agreement Charm. He will bend to your every whim,” The Dark Lord leered, stroking his hand roughly through the boy’s wayward hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy showed no objection, and, if Lucius was seeing correctly, he even leaned into the touch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How shall we use him first my Lord?” Draco asked, a slight shake in his tone. Lucius was sure he would be the only one to have noticed it, and it was only because of how well he knew his son.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is for you to decide,” their Lord leered. “Though,” he said, as if an afterthought, “I would like to see the little whelp thoroughly used.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Lucius would have seen this as another test, but now, he knew that the Dark Lord really did want this to be a reward for their service. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Draco,” Lucius said smoothly. “If you would indulge me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s yours,” Draco nodded, waving his father forward graciously. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucius nodded and stepped forward. “Come here, Potter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy, his too-large, muggle clothing hanging on his already bruised flesh. He looked like the Death Eaters had had their fun with him before turning him over to their Lord. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Again, the boy stepped forward, no hesitation in his movements. He looked expectantly at him, his green eyes wide and tellingly young. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucius wasn’t the type that generally partook in lusting after the youth, but even he could see that it was not the time to refuse such a gift. This, and the fact that Potter’s incredible power had always attracted a certain amount of attention from Lucius. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucius bearly had to tug at the boy’s shirt before the boy was aiding him in removing the hideous garment. His golden skin, tanned by the summer’s sun, was taut and gleaming over his young quidditch-ready body. Though slender, his muscles were lean and easily defined.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dark hair trailed from his navel down into his trousers. Lucius pulled the boy closer to him by the waist of his jeans. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now these,” Lucius hissed, tugging the button undone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter didn’t even blink at the request. He simply shoved his pants and trousers down as one. Lucius ignored the laughs and hoots and hollers of the surrounding Death Eaters. He let his eyes slide over his prize. Potter was quite fit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He seemed not to mind being stripped down in a room of his enemies. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucius grabbed Potter by the back of his neck and shoved him towards the table, leaning him over it so that his chest now lay flat across it. He stepped between his legs causing him to spread wider for him. The sight of his young, tight ass causing a thrill of excitement to burst through him. He slapped his arse hard, causing Potter to cry out; though in shock more than pain. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sound made Lucius let out a shuddered breath. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucius, apart from Narcissa, was only accustomed to sleeping with an occasional call boy. Narcissa, being a fellow Slytherin, was not accustomed to making herself vulnerable, even during sex; which meant that vocalizing her pleasure was not the thing to do.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Call boys, on the other hand, always made themselves vocal, but it was alway overly fake, in a way that made Lucius long for silence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This, however, was not like either. Potter’s yelp of surprise was so really it elicited a sweet spike of arousal to hit Lucius’ groin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He slapped his arse harder this time. Another cry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Lucius freed himself from within his robes he was fully at alert. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He thrust between Potter’s arse cheeks, smearing him with pre-cum. Potter hissed as Lucius’ fingers dug sharply into his hips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gasped as Lucius cast a wordless prepping spell, cleaning and lubing him up in one wandless flick of his wrist. As Potter reached back, as if to explore the odd sensation at his rear, Lucius swatted his hand away and lined up to enter him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Holding Potter firmly in place with one hand, he helped guide his head into Potter’s entrance with one quick thrust of his hips forward.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter cried out, this time in pain, his hands grasping at the table for purchase. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy was as tight as… Lucius wasn’t sure what. So tight it was near painful, yet not. It was like pure bliss. He couldn’t help but thrust deeper into his hot, hot heat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter whimpered, then hissed, as Lucius began to slowly work his prick in and out; he moved torturously slow. He enjoyed the muffled cries of Potter as his cock pushed steadily deeper still. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then with a final quick thrust forward, he was all the way in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter was shaking beneath him, and yet still didn’t resist. He didn’t try to pull away from his touch or cry out for him to stop. The Dark Lord’s agreement spell was still holding strong. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucius reached forward to wipe away a fallen tear from the golden boy’s cheek.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then he pulled out to the head and thrust back into him with real force.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter keened, his head falling backward as he released his animalistic cries.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucius couldn’t help but smirk at the boy’s wincing and hissing. He reached forward to grab a fistful of Potter’s hair, pulling him into an upright position. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You like that Potter?” he hissed into the boy’s ear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“N-no,” he whimpered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucius laughed and rolled his hips harder into the boy. He bit down hard onto his shoulder, nearly drawing blood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He rolled his hips again, aiming for the boy’s prostate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter cried out, this time with a distinct lack of pain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You like that?” Lucius asked again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death Eaters laughed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucius sneered, as he remembered their presence. He wished they were alone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter’s yelps and desperate-sounding pleas were something he wanted all to himself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please,” Potter whimpered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please what, Potter?” Lucius hissed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please- Please!” he cried. “I want to cum.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucius groaned huskily. Knowing that Potter meant that so sincerely was enough to have him reach around his young body and grasp him in his fist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter moaned, throwing his head back so that it rests against Lucius’ chest, he pumped himself into Lucius’ palm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh! Oh, fuck!” Potter slurred out. “I’m gonna!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucius abruptly pulled his hand away, smirking as he heard Potter cry out in dismay. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh Please!” the boy cried. “Please!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now he was pushing back into Lucius’ thrusts, making him hit his prostate even harder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucius was on the verge. Just a little more and he’d be there. He gave in to Potter’s pleas and wrapped his hand around the boy's thick appendage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh!” he screamed. And then he was cumming. Thick strings of cum spurting up across his chest, and forward on the table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His cumming caused a tight squeeze on Lucius, and he, too, was cumming.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucius gave a few more feeble thrusts forward to empty himself before pulling out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He rests a moment, letting his eyes flutter shut in his high. Leaning the boy forward across the table again, he watched as his seed poured from the boy, to slide down his inner leg in a sticky mess.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then he started glowing blue.</span>
</p>
