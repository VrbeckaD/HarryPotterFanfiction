    <p>Ron sat across the table from me, and I flicked my wand to reduce the rancor from the rest of the pub.</p>
<p>We looked at each other uneasily.</p>
<p>“Hey mate,” he said with false ease. “What did you need to talk about?”</p>
<p>I opened my mouth, but the words wouldn’t come out on their own. I took a moment to marshal them, to drive them out.</p>
<p>“I think there’s something seriously wrong with me,” I said.</p>
<p>His expression evened out into a familiar concern. I saw his eyes dart to my forehead. I almost smiled as I saw him restraining himself from asking if it was about my scar.</p>
<p>“It’s not about my scar,” I said lightly. “It’s not about Voldemort, it’s about me. I think there’s something about me, something that does something to the people around me, to the people that get close to me.”</p>
<p>Ron frowned in thought.</p>
<p>“This is different,” he said, “than back in school? When you were afraid that being close to you would get us all killed.”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“I’m not worried that I’m putting people in a dangerous position,” I said, “I’m more worried that I’m actually changing the people around me.”</p>
<p>“Like me?” he asked, his expression surprisingly light.</p>
<p>“Not like you,” I said, and his face darkened.</p>
<p>“There you are!” we both startled as a familiar voice intruded.</p>
<p>I looked and I saw her. I swallowed heavily. </p>
<p>“Hermione,” Ron breathed as she leaned over the table, interposing herself between us.</p>
<p>“Hello Ronald,” she said politely. “I’m afraid I’ll have to steal Harry here back to our flat. I’m sure you wouldn’t want to be the cause of dooming Harry to work-induced oblivion. Isn’t that right, Harry?”</p>
<p>I gulped again before I even noticed the wand peaking out from her sleeve, just out of Ron’s view.</p>
<p>“I…” I sent a last, pleading look at Ron, “I suppose so. Good to see you, Ron.”</p>
<p>He looked puzzled as I was dragged out of the pub.</p>
<p>I hoped that he could piece things together, but I knew it was in vain. I hadn’t said anything meaningful. I thought I would have more time, and now I doubted I’d ever be given the chance to speak to him privately again.</p>
<p>Hermione side-along apparated us to our pristine flat. I fell down and stared at the freshly cleaned floor. Hermione pulled me up and stared into my face with a serious expression.</p>
<p>“You making loving you very difficult, Harry,” she said.</p>
<p>I let out a wet laugh, then I cried.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>The clues were there from the beginning, but it took me a while to put it together. </p>
<p>There were too many unknowns. Maybe this was how love was, maybe this was all hormones. I never considered the truth of the matter.</p>
<p>It started in a tent in the Forest of Dean. If you wanted to be mean about it, you could say it started with Ron’s self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>He accused us of getting together behind his back and then turned his back on us, leaving us together, and with no one else to lean on.</p>
<p>It didn’t happen that night, but it didn’t take too many more nights for it to happen. </p>
<p>We both needed so much, and all we had was each other. </p>
<p>There was the song on the wireless and we danced. We didn’t want to let go of that moment so we held onto each other. I pulled my head back and looked into her eyes. What I saw there was the fear, the loneliness, the insecurity that I felt.</p>
<p>With one hand I stroked her face and with the other, I pulled her closer. We pressed our lips together slowly and kept them there. There was a quiet, methodical urgency to what we did. We weren’t rushed, but there was a desperate need to all we did.</p>
<p>Our bodies pressed more closely together, my hand caressed her neck. She ran her hand through my hair and pressed my head deeper into our kiss. Her other hand ran down my neck to my chest and I moaned with need.</p>
<p>We broke from our kiss to look at each other again. We saw the same need and kept going, our jackets falling to the floor. I kissed across her jawline and down her neck to just above her collarbone while she started undoing the buttons on my shirt.</p>
<p>She succeeded and flung it over my shoulders, but pulled it tight, momentarily pinning my arms to my sides. She pulled with one hand and pushed against my chest with the other, walking me backward until my legs hit the bed and we both fell onto it.    	</p>
<p>She seemed surprised to find herself straddling me, so I pulled my arms free of my sleeves, pulled myself up into a sitting position and put my hands on either side of her face.</p>
<p>I kissed her. Slowly, hungrily. </p>
<p>She responded in kind and pulled my right hand down to her chest. I began to gently squeeze and caress her clothed breast as my left hand did much the same on her bare neck.</p>
<p>Her moan vibrated through my mouth. </p>
<p>She broke off our kiss and began moving down my neck with her lips and fingertips. The cool touch of her digits and the searing warmth of her mouth and tongue sent jolts through me.</p>
<p>I hurriedly grasped the bottom of her shirt and pulled it up to expose more of her skin to the same treatment</p>
<p>She backed off to let her clothes pass over her head, but before she could do anything I spun us around and pinned her against the bed and kissed her just behind hew jaw and under her ear. Her surprised squeal turned into a moan as my right hand stroked the other side of her neck and traced the lines of her collarbone.</p>
<p>I slowly worked my way down to her chest, waiting until her eagerness matched mine. I slowly orbited her nipples with my mouth, laying light kisses, tentative licks, and gentle bites on the very edge of her breast, while my hand traced meaningless patterns across her ribs and hips.</p>
<p>I realized that I didn’t have a plan for taking off her bra, but before I could panic, she arched her back, reached behind with both arms and undid it herself. As she did so, her torso pressed against mine and seemed to send a surge of energy into my body.</p>
<p>I must have paused overlong because she then wrapped her legs around my midsection, grabbed my head and pulled it back against her breast. One hand ran through my hair and the other began scratching against my back with her nails.</p>
<p>She gasped as I moaned directly onto her breast. I recovered myself and resumed my slow trip to her nipple, my right hand now executing a similar spiral on her other breast.</p>
<p>As I continued getting closer, her breathing came in great heaves, the movement of her chest pulling at the soft grip my mouth had on her breast. I heard a soft gasp as I ran my tongue lightly over her nipple, then around its edge in a circle. I kissed it and felt a nub just beneath her skin at the tip and I squeezed it between my lips. In response, her legs tightened around me, and her arms stiffened as they gripped my back. </p>
<p>I spiraled back out and back in a few times, moving a fair bit more quickly. As I started to pull away I felt her fingers run through my hair and pull me up to her face. She kissed me deeply and urgently, her pure need being communicated perfectly. Her hands trailed down my neck and chest and reached for my belt. I froze in surprise, but she just kissed me all the more urgently.</p>
<p>As I returned my attention to Hermione’s lips, tongue, and teeth, I felt my jeans and boxers slide down my legs. I absently kicked them off of my ankles as I leaned further in to kiss and nibble on her earlobe.</p>
<p>I wasn’t the only one moving, though, as she trailed her fingers from my neck, down my chest, along my side and ending in a grip on my penis. I pulled my head back and looked at her face.</p>
<p>She responded by flipping us over and standing up. She made quick work of her own jeans and panties and seemed about to jump on me before she caught me staring.</p>
<p>“What is it?” she asked.</p>
<p>“It’s just,” I looked from the elegant curve of her neck to her soft, round breats to her small stomach to her shapely legs. My gaze went back up to her distinctive hair, kind face, and brown eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s just that I know you so well, but it’s also like I’m seeing how beautiful you are for the first time,” I said.</p>
<p>The edges of her eyes crinkled as she smiled. She climbed onto the bed and set herself over me. Her hands supported her on either side of my head as she looked me in the eyes.</p>
<p>“I want this Harry,” she said. “I need this, just like you do.”</p>
<p>A final slow kiss and she leaned back, hands resting gently on my stomach. Her hips settled down on mine and she trapped my penis beneath her and against my stomach. A little more weight rested on her hands as she started grinding her lips against my penis. It felt warm, and wet and intoxicating. I wanted nothing more than to slip into her and cum right then, and also to drag out this moment for eternity. </p>
<p>I closed my eyes and focused on the feeling while running my hands up and down Hermione’s thighs. When I opened them again, I found myself hypnotized by the soft sway and jiggling of her breasts. I used a hand to brace myself and push myself up enough to kiss her nipple.</p>
<p>She moaned and I followed the kiss with a lick, a soft bite, and more kisses. Her hand wrapped around the back of my neck and held my head in place. She lifted her hips and grasped my penis with her other hand and slowly, tortuously slowly, began to lower herself onto me. </p>
<p>The urge to thrust into her immediately made itself felt, but I resisted and focused on focusing as much pleasure as I could through her breast and used my free hand to run laps from her ribs all the way down to the sole of her foot.</p>
<p>I tried not to concentrate on the warmth that was enveloping my penis. I tried not to notice the slickness that slowly spread throughout her as she moved up in down. I couldn’t even pretend to ignore the feeling as I slid fully inside her and her weight settled fully on my hips.</p>
<p>I pulled back from her breast and we kissed and we kept kissing.</p>
<p>She gradually started to rock her hips back and forth and pleasure filled my penis. As her movements grew, I started moving with her until every thrust was almost across my entire length.</p>
<p>We looked each other in the eyes and each laid a hand on the side of the other’s neck.</p>
<p>I thought of saying something but couldn’t think of anything that would do justice to this moment, to this connection that I felt with her.</p>
<p>So I said nothing as we looked at each other, as we shared of ourselves.</p>
<p>The pleasure and tension built and built. It could have been for minutes or for hours and I wouldn’t have known the difference. I tried not to come first. When she got close, she started moaning harder and almost grunting with effort. With the sight of her, I couldn’t stop myself from spilling into her immediately.</p>
<p>She kept going and was able to finish before my penis became flaccid, though for me the sensations grew sharper and rode the line between pleasure and pain. I was happy, though, that both of us had cum.<br/>She lay down and rested against my chest and we slept.</p>
<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>It was good, that night. I think I can still treasure it. I think she was still herself, then. Maybe I just want to believe that. Maybe I just want to believe that she really chose me at least once. I know it wouldn’t really change things, but it feels different. It feels as though that would be just the tiniest bit better.</p>
