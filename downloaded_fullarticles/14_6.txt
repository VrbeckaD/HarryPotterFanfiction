    <p>There was nothing but darkness. Severus felt at peace.</p><p>It hadn't lasted nearly long enough when light began to irritate his eyes. </p><p>He opened them, only to find himself in a bed. Green curtains were drawn around him and a dim light was penetrating them from his left.</p><p>He bolted upright, his hand instinctively exploring his neck. There was no trace of an injury.</p><p>Was he dead? He didn't feel dead.</p><p>He couldn't have lived. The blood loss made sure of that, nevermind the venomâ€¦</p><p>Was this hell? The bed seemed a bit too comfortable for that...not that it was great but it wasn't the bed of nails he would have expected. </p><p>Why was he in a nightshirt anyway? It looked like one of the ones provided for students.</p><p>He examined himself further. Why was he so skinny? Not that he was ever anything larger than 'slim,' but he was particularly scrawny. How long had he been laying here? His brain had more questions than Granger in first year.</p><p>Snatching his wand from the nightstand he noted his limbs felt entirely too short. Severus burst out of the curtained bed with a stumble, nearly crashing into a neighboring bed.</p><p>He was in a dorm. A slytherin dorm. </p><p>His dorm when he was a student.</p><p>The curtain of the bed nearest him whipped open and he nearly jumped out of his skin.</p><p>The face of a very young Avery frowned at him in the dim morning light. Sweet merlin, did he land on a time turner?</p><p>"Bloody hell, Snape! Did you find a spider in your trousers or something?"</p><p>A muffled guffaw came from the other side of the room. "Twas probably just his pubes! They finally grow in, Snape?"</p><p>Mulciber and Avery laughed at their oh-so-witty joke combo.</p><p>Ugh, teenagers. No, worse: teenage wannabe Death Eaters. Perhaps this was hell after all.</p><p>Snape scowled in disgust. "I didn't know you were interested, Mulciber. Though I suppose it's good<br/>you prefer men and not boys."</p><p>Avery snickered.</p><p>"Bugger off, Snape."</p><p>"Was that not what you wanted? I'm not really interested personally, but we could certainly find you someone willing."</p><p>Avery cackled at his friend's expense.</p><p>Severus continued, "Rosier might enjoy an extra pair of hands...among other things. If not, I believe Madam Rosmerta is single."</p><p>Mulciber made an indignant sound and Avery had nearly fallen out of bed in a fit.</p><p>Before Mulciber recovered enough for another retort, Snape went to the loo.</p><p>He came to a halt in front of the mirror. Had he ever looked that young? It had no inscription like the Mirror of Erised, but perhaps it was similar? He knew he had no desire to experience puberty for a second time.</p><p>Poking at his face he concluded it was simply his reflection. He was, in fact, young again.</p>
