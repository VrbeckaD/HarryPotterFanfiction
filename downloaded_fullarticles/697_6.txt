    <p>Perhaps when he first noticed that he was different was when he was still innocent to what different meant. </p><p> </p><p>He was always told he was a freak, that was simply a fact to him.  Yet, the moment when he appeared on that rooftop, the wind blowing in his hair, the people below him like ants… that was when he became <em>different</em>.</p><p> </p><p>He went down to the ground, in the arms of a fireman, and he went back to the child in the cupboard, but something in him remembered what it was like to be on the top for once.</p><p> </p><p>That rush… he never forgot that. </p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>The Wizarding World, when he discovered it, that he was <em>always</em> a part of it… it reminded him of that rush.  He wasn’t like his <em>relatives</em>, no, he was a <em>wizard</em>. </p><p> </p><p>He was something more. </p><p> </p><p>Yet he kept these thoughts to himself as he followed the half-giant.  There was no need for anyone to be alerted to his thoughts, not when he was new, not when he wasn’t sure how he fit into all this. </p><p> </p><p>There would come a time when he could make himself known, but that moment wasn’t then.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps there never would be a moment. </p><p> </p><p>That memory of the rush, though, he kept it close to him, and it kept him going. </p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>The first moment where he lost his faith in the Light providing that access to <em>the rush</em> was after the whole Philosopher’s Stone Incident.  The way those blue eyes twinkled at him while spinning sugary lies, the way his gut tightened and bitterness was felt… no, that was the first moment when the Wizarding World failed to give him what he expected, what he had wanted. </p><p> </p><p>That was perhaps the first moment when he let himself wonder at Voldemort’s offer… and then promptly discarded it.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>In the graveyard, the wind was once again whipping wildly, and the corpse of Cedric lay not too far away.  Cedric’s eyes were wide open and were vacantly staring in his direction.  He shuddered and forced his eyes back towards the figure rising out of a black cauldron, back towards the mind-numbing pain resonating from his scar. </p><p> </p><p>As the figure, as <em>Voldemort</em>, approached him, his voice sibilant and hypnotic, the rush, the rush he had almost forgotten, came upon him and he gasped. </p><p> </p><p>The pain in his forehead was forgotten as <em>the rush</em> was felt the closer Voldemort came.  Unconsciously, he began to pant and writhe, nothing in his mind except to get closer and never forget that feeling again. </p><p> </p><p>Voldemort paused in his steps and hissed out harshly, “What are you doing, boy?”</p><p> </p><p>It took a while for him to gain the ability to speak again, to push past the fog in his head, to push past the <em>pleasurerushadrenaline</em> and answer, “M-my Lord, is your offer still open?”</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort’s hand whipped out and wrapped around his throat, but he still didn’t care because now the rush was <em>everywhere</em> and <em>Merlin, but this was all he had ever wanted</em>. </p><p> </p><p>“What are you saying, you foolish boy?”</p><p> </p><p>He licked his cracked lips and croaked out, “I-I never formally stated what s-side I was on.  I never said I was Dumbledore’s, everyone just assumed it.  If you still wish it, then perhaps we can consider my joining your side.”</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort’s eyes narrowed and he went silent, the only noise in the graveyard was Wormtail’s whimpering and the wind howling.</p><p> </p><p>Then Voldemort’s eyes became piercing and <em>the rush</em> became deafening in his ears.</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort’s lips lifted in a parody of a smile and Harry’s heart thudded.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>All he had ever wanted was that rush… perhaps this way he could keep it.</em>
