    <p> </p><p>Eli had no intention of attending the Trials. She loathed crowds, didn’t want to deal with any of the “Ministry Clown Covens” and agreed with Jeanne-Marie that it was wrong to exploit dragons as one of the trials. She found it insufferable that the dragons were not asked for consent, but were forced to participate.</p><p>When Victor Krum used the Conjunctivitis spell during his trial, causing the Chinese Fireball, whose dragon name translated to Mei Ling, to crush half her eggs, Jeanne-Marie went ballistic. She summoned Eli to help her calm the other dragons, who, as mothers themselves, sympathized with Mei Ling and as a result, all of them were upset and acting out.</p><p><br/> “Of course they are mad at those stupid Terrans!” she snarled. “I need some help calming them down, and you speak Dragon, so come to their enclosure in the Forest.”</p><p>Eli saddled up Yojimbo and went to the Forest. The Terran dragon wranglers were all huddled at a safe distance from the enclosures. Jeanne-Marie was with Mei Ling, and she told Eli to join her. Both of them spoke to the dragon, whose eyes were covered. She turned her massive head to Eli, who put her hand on the dragon’s forehead. “She can’t even cry because of what that horrid boy did to her,” Jeanne-Marie said. “Would you give her this potion and give her these eye drops? I’ll go try and calm down the others, before they make some Terran Toast. And then these gits will execute them.”</p><p> </p><p>Jeanne-Marie went to the Hungarian Horntail, who was  the most agitated. “Younger Sister, would you show this lady your spirit?”</p><p><br/> Eli nodded, and produced her dragon patronus, which flew around the dragons, who were amused by it. Jeanne-Marie went to the Horntail and spoke to her at length. The dragon was angry at the Terrans who were using them as toys, and Jeanne-Marie agreed with her. It was clear that the Horntail, whose name was Tűztáncosokkal, spoke for the other dragons. Blodau Tân, the Welsh Green, and Vacker Krigare, the Swedish short snout, agreed that the only way to make this right was to release all of them from custody, to be allowed back to their native ranges, and never used as entertainment for the “puny furless two leggers” ever again.</p><p> </p><p>Eli opened her mind to Mei Ling, and felt the dragon’s grief over her lost eggs. She gently removed the bandages from the dragon’s eyes, put the soothing lotion on them, and gave the dragon the pain relieving potion. She stroked the dragon’s face, speaking in a soft voice, as Hagrid approached the pen. Mei Ling smelled him, and tensed up. Eli put her forehead to the dragon’s skull, and whispered to her.</p><p><br/> “You can come in, Hagrid, I told her you were not like the others.”</p><p><br/> Hagrid entered the pen and cautiously approached them.</p><p><br/> “Sit here next to me and give me your hand.”</p><p>Eli took Hagrid’s hand and put her other hand on the dragon’s forehead. “Let’s see if I can do this” and spoke a spell.</p><p><br/> Hagrid felt a tingling go up his arm to his brain. Slowly he began to hear Mei Ling’s thoughts, and could feel her enter his mind. She sniffed him up and down, and he felt her communicate “Friend.”</p><p><br/> He began to cry as he felt her sorrow over her lost eggs.</p><p><br/> “Now try it without me.”</p><p><br/> Hagrid put his hand on her forehead. He could feel her thoughts, as she rested her head in his lap.</p><p>Charlie Weasley watched from behind a tree near the pen. He’d never considered the feelings of the dragons he’d worked with. The more he thought about it, the more sympathetic he became to the dragon’s plight. They were captives. They had been hunted mercilessly over the years, until they were one of the most endangered species on the planet. It wasn’t their fault most of their ranges had been taken over by humans.</p><p><br/> He agreed with Jeanne-Marie and the Horntail. It was not proper to use dragons like this, in what amounted to a blood sport. They didn’t consent. He watched Hagrid caress the dragon, ashamed to admit he’d never even knew they had names. Never even thought about it. He fell in love with the Faerie woman. But he knew that he would he would never have a chance with her, and his mother hated Faeries, and the Morgans, and Eli le Fey in particular. He didn’t know why, and his father wouldn’t tell him anything.<br/> Fang ambled up, snuffled Hagrid, then yawned and lay down to sleep, between the eggs and Hagrid. He held his finger to his lips, mouthing the words, “she’s asleep.” Eli nodded, got up and summoned Yojimbo, who trotted up. She took out the food and drink she had in her saddle bags, and took down the bedroll. She touched Hagrid’s forehead.</p><p><br/> <em>[are you going to stay with her?]</em></p><p><br/> He nodded. She put the balm and the potion jar next to him.</p><p><br/> <em>[I’ll be back tomorrow at first light]</em></p><p>Eli left the pen with Yojimbo, and they left the Forest with Severus.</p><p><br/> Charlie realized he was jealous of Hagrid. He wished the dragons would like him that much.</p><p><br/> Draco Malfoy, who had been spying with a viewing glass and camera from a distance, wanted to meet the Faerie women who talked to dragons. He wondered how close Snape was to Eli. But he somehow realized that Snape would not talk about Eli to him or anyone else. Snape never discussed his personal life. He watched as his professor and the Faerie warrior walked along the lakeshore, deep in conversation, as the horse walked behind them. Neither of them looked very happy, and he wondered what they were talking about.</p><p> </p><p>Severus was talking about the disturbing things happening on campus. He asked her to try and keep an eye on Neville, on the astral plane, because Harry was taking all of his time and attention.</p><p><br/> “I miss being with you, but I can’t take my eyes off that boy for a minute now, there are too many enemies within striking distance.”</p><p><br/> “Ugh. Well, I suppose I could come to you here at night, much as I don’t want to . .. I just don’t like being here. Got a lot of bad memories and the future is looking really grim.” She sighed. “Don’t say it, I ‘knew the job was dangerous when I took it.’”</p><p><br/> “It sounds like a fun trip.”</p><p><br/> “You gotta be kidding me. We’ll be flying way up there, almost at the edge of space, and it’s freaking COLD up there, even with the thermostat on the dragon turned all the way up, I’ll need extra oxygen . ..gotta play chicken with all those junk satellites and military aircraft. I’ve got cloaking devices and all that, but it’s annoying. Once we get there it will be fine. We’re going to a the base of the Himalayas, there is a zone that has been used for centuries, with wards, protective spells, by the people of the temples, I met many of them during the war. It’s a valley between mountains so rugged the muggles still haven’t gotten anyone near them. They are overjoyed to have a dragon come back.”</p><p><br/> “Older Sister sure is good finding creatures homes”</p><p><br/> “Oh, yeah, like father, always taking in strays, then getting them where they need to be. It’s a gift.”</p><p><br/> “Yeah, like me,” Severus said, and squeezed her hand. “Stop by in a couple of hours, would you?  Take the floo to my quarters.”</p><p><br/> “Sure.”</p><p> </p><p>Eli jumped on Yojimbo’s back and rode back to the Farm.</p><p>The next morning Eli went to the dragon’s pen before dawn. Mei Ling, Hagrid, and Fang were still curled up together. She quietly brought out the food and jug of coffee she’d packed. She conjured a small Hestia’s fire, suspended the jug over it, and waited for them to wake up. Fang was the first. His nose began to twitch when Eli brought the food out. He got up immediately, shook himself, and ambled over to Eli, leaning on her shoulder and giving her his best “I am starving” look.</p><p> </p><p>Charlie Weasley came by with the dragon’s breakfast as Hagrid got up. Eli handed each of them a mug of coffee.</p><p><br/> “She has to keep her bandages on another day, so I’ll feed her by hand,” Hagrid said. “If you could send word to the Beastmaster of Durmstang, if he could take my students today for me? I would like to stay with Mei Ling until she’s ready to go home. If no one minds, of course.”</p><p><br/> Eli and Charlie smiled. “Of course not,” Eli said. “Older Sister trusts you. I’ll go find Nikolai and ask him to cover for you. How often do you get a chance to nurse a dragon?” She and Yojimbo left. “I’m going to see if I can find Firenze,” she said as she left. She ran along side him, she knew Centaurs hated to see horses being ridden.</p><p><br/> Firenze didn’t have much time for her that day. The stars were saying things no one wanted to know. This would be a time of great suffering, and most of the Centaurs were adamant about not getting involved. “They won’t listen to us anyway,” Firenze said, “And they hate you Faeries for always being right about the errors of their ways. I will see what I can do.”</p><p> </p><p>Eli rode back to the dragon’s pen and she and her sister rode their horses to the Farm and then to Avalon to collect the gear needed for the flight.</p><p><br/> “Mei Ling is in good hands,” Jeanne-Marie said. “Hagrid is a good hand with the creatures, not so much so with humans.”</p><p><br/> Eli collected the antigravity pods for the saddle and egg container, to lighten the load at high altitudes, a flying suit and full face helmet with O2 crystals. The Ovates made a custom fitted aerodynamically egg container with temperature control. She had always been a nervous high altitude flyer, and her sister liked to tease her about it.<br/> Of course, Jeanne-Marie’s animagus was a Phoenix, and she flew alongside any creature of the air with ease.</p><p><br/> The Environmental Elementals of the Pacific Rim Authority sent a formal demand that the dragon and her remaining eggs be returned to their jurisdiction immediately. The species was seriously endangered, and the loss of the eggs considered to be a blow to the effort to maintain a breeding population of the indigenous dragons. The Ministry agreed to these demands without a fight.</p><p> </p><p>Two days later, after Hagrid’s constant attention and devoted nursing, Mei Ling was cleared for flight. Her eyes had been healed, and she wanted to leave this place. The other dragons, with Jeanne-Marie’s help, had negotiated a treaty with the Rumanian Ministry, changing the terms of their status within the magical community. They would have equal legal standing to humans. The Druids of Avalon helped write the treaty and gave the dragons communication devices for future use. One of the Bards offered his services as a translator.</p><p> </p><p>On the day that Eli and Mei Ling were due to depart, the Welsh dragon went to Jeanne-Marie, bowed, and asked for sanctuary. The Druid lawyers brought out a copy of the treaty that the Ministry had signed with the Fey, which gave Jeanne-Marie rights over any sentient creature who asked for sanctuary, and since it was now established that dragons could communicate, were in all sense of the word, sentient, they must be allowed the same rights, under Rumanian law as well. Since the dragons were considered “property” of the Rumanians, their wishes must be honored. The Rumanian delegation declared that the Welsh Green Dragon, whose name is Blodau Tân, was given free and full permission to go to the Farm, thence to her home range in Wales, where the male Morgans had their original castle.</p><p> </p><p>Hagrid knew she had to leave and they would never meet again. He loved her more than any other of the creatures he’d cared for, and she loved him back.</p><p>“She says she will name one of the children Rubeus Hagrid,” Eli said. “ A dragon with your name flying free. Think of that when you miss her, she will be thinking of you too.”</p><p><br/> Hagrid embraced the dragon’s head and kissed her on the forehead. He laid his face along hers, as his tears fell on her face. She crooned at him, as a tear rolled out of her eyes and fell on the top of his head, and was absorbed in his hair, then into his head, straight to his heart.</p><p><br/> Jeanne-Marie was impressed by this. She was aware of Hagrid’s merit, and his true love of all creatures.</p><p> </p><p>Eli soon got ready for the flight. She put on the egg case, strapped it into position, then the saddle, and her gear bag. She put the safety harness on and mounted the dragon. Jeanne-Marie transfigured into her animagus, and they joined Blodau Tân. The group took to the air, heading for the Farm, to the cheers of everyone present.</p><p> </p><p>The journey took less time than Eli had anticipated. Mei Ling wanted to get home, and they took a direct route with only one stopover. They got to the temple earlier than expected, but no one there cared much. At last, a dragon back to guard the valley. If the dragons had not been driven out of their range, the daemons would have been vanquished immediately, and the war would have lasted weeks, not two years.</p><p><br/> That night, a comet streaked across the sky over the mountains. The aurora shown all over the world that night, and the Muggle astronomers were amazed at the celestial displays. A suitable cave was found near the secret pass, and Eli and some of the people of the valley helped Mei Ling set up a nursery for her remaining eggs.</p><p>Eli decided to stay for the party the next day. She took videos and still pictures on the memory globe she brought with her. She planned on making a copy for Hagrid. She portkeyed back to the Farm with the gifts the people had given her, saving a necklace made of native turquoise that would make a lovely bracelet for Hagrid, made of stones from Mei Ling’s mountain. He was touched to the point of tears when she presented him the sphere and bracelet.</p><p><br/> “Bless you, Eli, I didn’t get to have her long, but she will always be in my heart.”</p>
