    <p>It's the middle of December and the world is blanketed in the powdery white that typically tends to make itself known around that time of year. If Hermione didn't know any better she might have been tricked into thinking that everything that had happened- the war, the death, the pain- was nothing but a figment of her imagination... She almost wishes that it was. </p><p>Unfortunately, the bandage around her arm does nothing to hide the fact that her nightmares are all very, very real. </p><p>Her friends are gone, killed by a madman and the radicals that followed him, and all Hermione has left of them can either be found in her memories or at the very bottom of the beaded bag she's somehow managed not to lose. </p><p>Everyone she has ever truly loved is lost to her; and for what? </p><p>Voldemort is dead, his war pushed aside in favor of another more brutal one. Beyond these walls the world is nothing but blood and ash and ruin. Purebloods, Half-Bloods, and Muggle Borns left to their own devices in the wake of a completely governmental collapse. It's the textbook definition of Anarchy and the only reason Hermione isn't involved in it is because she's here. </p><p>The only thing still standing in relative order is Gringotts, and only because the bank has only ever been run by goblins. </p><p>With a sigh Hermione pulls the blanket she'd stolen from one of the rooms upstairs tighter around her shoulders. Even with the fireplace roaring behind her there's a distinct chill settling in her bones. Maybe it's because she's pressed against the large window where she's been watching as the world beyond the frosted glass turn into a haze of snow, bare trees, and only just visible cobbled paths. </p><p>Malfoy Manor truly is beautiful. </p><p>it's a shame Hermione can only bring herself to appreciate little bits and pieces of it. </p><p>Like the library, with it's towering shelves and the mural ceiling that reminds her almost a bit too much of Hogwarts. </p><p>"You look tired, Granger." </p><p>She doesn't turn to look at Draco but she does pull her feet closer to her bum so he can take a seat on the bench with her. </p><p>Draco takes the silent invitation and flops down across from her, a freshly opened bottle of firewhisky held in his slender grip. He looks about as exhausted as Hermione feels and it's either a result of the stress this entire situation has put him under or the lingering trauma. Probably bother. Hermione knows she's suffering from a fair bit of post traumatic stress herself. </p><p>Reaching out Hermione carefully plucks the bottle from his fingers, an easy task considering he doesn't fight her for it. The label on the bottle is faded and pealing, 'Oden's Olde' the only thing Hermione can really make out on the yellowing  tag. This wouldn't be the first time Draco's broken into his father's liquor store... But she's never stopped him from drinking and she's never refused a sip when he offers her the bottle.  </p><p>After taking a sip she places the bottle on the bench between them and watches Draco as he turns to face the window. </p><p>In the firelight he looks... Very dashing. </p><p>"I've been thinking, you know? I do a lot of that lately it would seem." Draco begins, tongue peaking out to wet his bottom lip. </p><p>Hermione blinks, nods, and says, "About what?" </p><p>"The war. What might have changed if we'd been on the right side of things." Draco shakes his head. "There wasn't a right side in the end though so I don't think it matters all that much." </p><p>"Would you have fought for him if he was the right side?" </p><p>"No," he says it with so much conviction that the little part of her that had tensed up in preparation eases, "I wouldn't have fought for him at all." </p><p>She doesn't comment on how Draco's fingers tug at the hem of his sleeve to pull it further down around his slim wrist. </p><p>Neither of them walked away from the war without a far amount of guilt and regret. Hermione's stems from her inability to keep Harry alive, her inability to help him win the war, her inability to die with everyone else. Draco isn't much different she suspects. He lost his parents, watched as his classmates were murdered, watched as his world crumbled around him. </p><p>If he were a terrible person it would have been different. </p><p>But there lies the problem. </p><p>No matter what he's done, no matter how badly he's messed up in the past, Draco Malfoy is a good person at heart and a human to boot. A defining feature of humanity is the ability to make mistakes and attempt to atone for them. </p><p>"You probably wouldn't have changed anything if you'd been on our side... There still would have been Voldemort, and  Dolohov, and Bellatrix. People still would have died." </p><p>Draco takes a large swig from the bottle before passing it to her. </p><p>"Maybe, but at least I would have done what's right." </p><p>"You did do what was right in the end, Draco, it's not your fault that Tom Riddle turned into a sadistic megalomaniac." </p><p>A horrible huff of laughter leaves the blond wizard's mouth. </p><p>"I feel bad for him... Tom Riddle... Sometimes." </p><p>Hermione's fingers tingle as she passes the bottle back. </p><p>"Oh yeah?" </p><p>"My parents might not have been good people but they loved me. I know they loved me. They did everything in their power to protect me," Draco's shoulders tremble. "He didn't have that. My father told me that Tom Riddle grew up in some filthy muggle orphanage in London after Merope died while his equally filthy muggle father drank and fucked and did whatever else it is rich muggles do." </p><p>Hermione rolls her eyes, "He didn't have to turn into a murderer though." </p><p>Silver eyes flash as Draco shakes his head. </p><p>"No... But he didn't really have anyone to teach him right from wrong when he was a boy either." </p><p>Anger, hot and reckless burns in Hermione's chest. </p><p>"Are you seriously defending the man who essentially murdered your parents?" Hermione bites out. </p><p>"... I could have ended up like him, Granger.... I just.... How can I not?" </p><p>"What? You're nothing like that <em>thing</em>." </p><p>"I might have been, once, if my parents hadn't loved me or if I hadn't loved them." </p><p>The anger fades away to a certain kind of pity? Sorrow?</p><p>Hermione isn't sure what she's feeling but he knows it's something that's allowed Draco to settle more firmly into a place of friendship then she might have previously allowed. Because Draco looks so incredibly sad, so defeated, and it's an act of vulnerability Hermione's never witnessed from him before now. Before tonight Draco had always expressed his sadness by consuming excess amounts of alcohol before seeking her out to talk about ridiculous muggle inventions that he never quite understood. </p><p>"Do you think that if someone had known what he'd become they would have changed it?" Draco murmurs. </p><p>"I don't know," Hermione replies, vaguely uncomfortable, "maybe." </p><p>A long moment of silence is all they need to finish another quarter of the firewhisky. </p><p>Hermione lets the fuzzy drunk feeling settle over her as she leans against the window where the chill from outside drives away the nearly stifling heat brought on by the alcohol. </p><p>She isn't aware she's begun to doze off until Draco nudges her with his foot. </p><p>"Could you kill a kid, Granger?" He asks and Hermione finds herself unable to formulate a proper answer. </p><p>"Could you?" </p><p>"No," Draco's voice is a broken whisper, "I don't think I could."</p><p>Deciding that they've had too much to drink Hermione takes the bottle from Draco before rising to her feet. But he looks so defeated, so wrecked, just as defeated and wrecked as she is that it brings tears to Hermione's eyes and without much thought she puts the bottle on the floor, reaches out, curls her arms around Draco's shoulders, and pulls him in for a hug. </p><p>After a brief moment of tension in which Hermione begins to regret her impulsive action Draco slowly, tentatively, wraps his arms around her waist and buries his face in her shoulder where he just breathes. Hermione wonders if he's ever hugged anyone aside from his parents. It doesn't matter one way or another she supposes. Neither of them are going to mention it tomorrow. </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p><em>Do you think that if someone had known what he'd become they would have changed it?</em> </p><p>Draco's question haunts Hermione over the next few days. Those words and something Harry had said in passing about Voldemort's childhood sparking a series of thoughts that make the young witch's head spin. And as she's never been one to give up when things get sticky Hermione just rolls her shoulders and takes it in stride. These ideas are, after all, centered around the thought of changing <em>everything</em>. </p><p>So she does what she always used to do whenever she wasn't sure about something. She scours the Malfoy library, pours over each and every single book to find anything even remotely useful. </p><p>Somehow Draco convinces her to take a break for Yule; they drink warm butterbeer, talk about holidays gone by, and exchange gifts near a roaring fire that smells of pine and hesitant joy. She gives Draco Rubik's Cube that she transfigured from a rock and gets a pretty, jeweled hair pin in return. It's nice, Hermione cherishes the memories she makes with Draco but Yule ends pretty quickly after, the pin gets put in a jewelry box in her room, and Hermione returns to her search.</p><p>It's the middle of February before she manages to gather enough information to determine if her plan is even possible. Thankfully, it's not an impossibility. Incredibly unlikely but not impossible. </p><p>Not if she can convince Draco to help her. </p><p>So it's with all her Gryffindor courage and a ritual book stuffed with marked parchment that Hermione seeks out the blond. </p><p>Avoiding the room where she was tortured, Hermione searches the Manor and finds Draco in the potions room in the basement. He's curled over a book Hermione can't make out and the furrow between his brow tells her that whatever he's looking at is important. </p><p>"Hey," She calls as she knocks on the open door, "got a minute?" </p><p>"Yeah." Draco closes the book, turns, and leans against the work table. </p><p>He's wearing a pristine white button up with the sleeves rolled to just above his elbows and the first two buttons undone, he's wearing black slacks, custom made shoes, and a signet ring made of silver and peppered with both diamonds and emeralds. Very Slytherin. </p><p>Hermione takes a moment to gather her thoughts. </p><p>"I've been thinking about what you said." She starts. </p><p>"I say a lot of things, Granger, please be more specific." </p><p>"About someone doing something about Tom as a kid." </p><p>Draco goes incredibly pale and clenches his jaw as he says, "And I'm sure that brain of yours came up with something extraordinarily you." </p><p>"I've been doing a lot of reading-" "Of course you have." "- and I think I've found a way for us to go back to when Tom would have been about six." </p><p>"Merlin's Saggy Balls Granger! You cant honestly be thinking about killing a child can you?" </p><p>Offended, Hermione reels back. </p><p>"What? No, of course not! Why would you even think such a thing?" She demands, arms crossed over her chest. </p><p>Draco throws his hands up in the air, "What else are you thinking of doing?" </p><p>"Certainly not killing him!" </p><p>"Then what Granger? What could you possibly do to change all of this?" He motions to the space between and around them, eyes wild, cheeks flushed. </p><p>Hermione wants to yells, scream, shake him until he sees stars! Because they talked about this! How could he even think she's condone the killing of an innocent child? Yes, Tom Riddle might have grown up to be the darkest wizard Britain had ever known but he was an innocent little boy once who had been let down by not only his family but by the very man who supposedly tried to teach him to be good. </p><p>But Dumbledore failed so many children over his life that it's not a surprise at this point. </p><p>Fortunately for Tom, Hermione won't make their mistakes. </p><p>"I'm going to adopt him." </p><p>Flushed cheeks go pale, wild eyes go wide with surprise, and a sharp jaw drops as Draco begins to comprehend what it is she's saying. </p><p>"You're... What?" </p><p>"I am going to go back and adopt Tom Riddle." </p><p>Skepticism clear on his face Draco asks, "And how is that going to change anything." </p><p>"You said it yourself. If your parents hadn't loved you then you would have ended up like <em>him</em>." </p><p>"Do you honestly think that you going back would change anything?" </p><p>"I don't know!" She screams, all the emotions she's bottled up over the past months bursting forth in a wave of anger. "I don't know but I can't keep living like this, Draco! I can't keep thinking that I didn't do enough or that I failed to protect them!" </p><p>"What if your plan doesn't work? Did you think about that? Did you!" Draco snaps back. </p><p>"What does it matter if it works or not? Everyone we love is already dead!" </p><p>Grey eyes widen before narrowing into slits. </p><p>Hermione should feel guilt but she doesn't. If doing this means she can bring back Harry and Ron and everyone else she and Draco lost then so be it. She'd jump through hundreds of years for even a chance at saving them. Well, most of them. She can't honestly say she would jump with joy if Lucius Malfoy came back to life but Draco probably would and so Hermione thinks that's a good enough reason as any for the pompous bastard to live again. </p><p>Making Draco smile, even if for a second, has become another incredibly important part of Hermione's day. </p><p>Their frienship is strange and it might not be just friendship anymore but she's in no position currently to explore what their relationship <em>might</em> be. Not when she's got something else, something more dangerous, to deal with first. </p><p>"So what? You're just going to go as you are name and everything else included? What happens when he runs into you in the future? What are you going to tell him? The truth? Ha! That would go over well." </p><p>"Don't be ridiculous Draco." Hermione stomps past him and slams her book down on the work table. "I found a ritual that will change my appearance just enough that the idea of a distant relation wouldn't be unheard of. Maybe I'll have estranged family, maybe I'll just change my name and we could be distantly related. Either way, he'll never know." </p><p>Pinching the bridge of his nose Draco merely shakes his head before flipping through her notes. </p><p>Several minutes pass in which the blond goes over every note, every scribble Hermione has made on the copious amounts of parchment now spread out over the table. Draco doesn't say anything as he reads, only humming or snorting on occasion. It annoys the curly haired witch watching him. </p><p>Finally, after what seems like an eternity, Draco turns to meet her gaze. </p><p>"I don't think this is going to work but you're going to do it anyways aren't you?" He asks. </p><p>"Obviously." </p><p>"You're not going alone." </p><p>"What? Of course I am." </p><p>"No, you're not." </p><p>Something in his tone tells Hermione that he's not in an arguing mood and honestly? Hermione's ok with Draco tagging along. </p><p>While she'd figured out how to throw herself into the past she's also thought of how she would support Tom and herself once she'd done so. Figuring out where they would live, how she would raise him, and how she would support them had all been carefully researched and debated upon. And realistically all of those things would be made much easier with Draco's help. Having a male role model of pure blood might help to curb any inferiority complexes Tom might acquire while in Slytherin, because obviously he would be sorted there being the Heir of Slytherin and all. It would also help to have a familiar face around to ground Hermione. </p><p>But still.... Hermione hadn't accounted for Draco wanting to follow her back in time to help her raise a young Tom Riddle so it throws her through a bit of a loop in all honesty. </p><p>A might sigh escapes through Hermione's nose, a sign of her reluctant acceptance, just before she offers the man across from her a brisk nod. </p><p>The smile he gives her in return is entirely too smug for Hermione's liking. </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>"We should get married." Draco remarks very suddenly a few days later as the two of them sit at the kitchen table for breakfast. </p><p>Hermione slowly looks away from the parchment in her hand to stare at Draco with shocked eyes. </p><p>"What?" </p><p>"Married. We should get married. It would be more believable for us to be adopting a child together if we were married." </p><p>"... I suppose..." </p><p>They're already giving themselves fake names and fake lives. What would a fake marriage be in comparison to all that? But would it be fake? Draco said 'get' as opposed to 'be' and while there are worse people to marry then Draco Malfoy their marriage would have to be a convincing one. </p><p>Could she do that? </p><p>Could she sleep in the same bed with him? Dote on him? Display her affections for him as publicly as her mother had displayed her love for Hermione's father? </p><p>Looking at Draco, with his wide grey eyes and hesitant smile that makes him seem more boyish then he is? </p><p><em>Yes</em>, she thinks and it's almost a violent thought,<em> I think that I could</em>. </p><p>Leaning back in the beautifully crafted wooden chair she'd claimed earlier that morning Hermione purses her lips. </p><p>"How would that work? Us getting married?" She asks. </p><p>"Sign a couple of papers and we're legally married." </p><p>"Can we even get those papers?" </p><p>This time Draco nods. </p><p>"I can get all the necessary paperwork from Gringotts as well as the contents of the Malfoy and Black vaults." </p><p>"You can still access those vaults?" Hermione hates the surprise in her voice. </p><p>"Sure, I'll just have to Floo in and maybe wait around for a few hours to get everything together but I'm the heir to both vaults considering... Well, considering everything that's happened." </p><p>Hermione doesn't push for any more information. </p><p>"Alright. So we're going to get married, we're going to get the money from the vault, where are we going to stay?" </p><p>"There's an old estate East of Edinburgh we could stay." </p><p>"You've got property in Scottland?" </p><p>"And France, and Germany. We Malfoys are a pretentious lot and we just love to throw our wealth around." Draco laughs. </p><p>Hermione giggles. </p><p>"What if I wanted to stay somewhere that isn't owned by your family? I think it would be safer to maybe buy a little country home in England, something that isn't owned by the Malfoys or Blacks... Just in case." </p><p>"That's," Draco swallows hard, "that's fair." </p><p>"I'm sure your home East of Edinburgh is lovely though." </p><p>"You'd have liked it. It overlooks the sea." </p><p>This smile is a softer one and Hermione says, "When I was young my parents would take me camping in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire. It was stunning." </p><p>She shoves the memories of cold nights and arguing and starving and a dark voice whispering promises of power into her ear when Harry and Ron couldn't protect her. Those memories are painful, they're raw, Hermione doesn't want them. So she thinks about her father's laughter and her mother's smile and how she used to try and count the stars in whatever little clearing they set up camp in. </p><p>Draco must see something in her face because he offers a soft smile that makes his eyes look closer to a soft fog then the hard steel Hermione became used to seeing in her youth. </p><p>"Your parents must have been great people." </p><p>"They were." Hermione says, voice thick with emotion, "They were." </p><p>Neither of them say anything after that but Draco reaches across the table and threads his fingers through hers, calloused thumb rubbing soothing circles against Hermione's knuckles. The small act of comfort breaks something in Hermione and she's not even aware that she's sobbing hysterically until Draco's wrapped his arms around her and pulled her into his chest. </p><p>She's going to ruin his shirt, tears and snot don't typically do well with such fine silk... But it's so nice to be <em>held</em>, to be allowed to choke on her own breath without the fear of bothering anyone with the noise of her sorrow. </p><p>So she chokes and gasps and cries into Draco's chest while he smooths down her hair and whispers comforting nothings into her ear as he does. </p><p>"It's ok. It's going to be ok." He promises as Hermione trembles. "We're going to change <em>everything</em>." </p>
