          <div class="userstuff"><p>There’s only one thought on Fredrick Gideon Weasley the Second’s mind when he sat on the stool to be sorted, ‘Not Gryffindor.’</p><p>	Frederick, not Freddie and especially not Fred, did not want to go into the house of bravery, even if that was the house his mother and father. For his namesake, the deceased Fred Weasley was a Gryffindor and for all of Frederick’s life, he was constantly being compared to his namesake. The young boy looked nothing like his uncle, acted nothing like his uncle, but jest because of name, he’s looked as if he is supposed to be his uncle.</p><p>	‘Not Gryffindor, eh?’ The Sorting Hat tells him in his head, ‘That’s the first time I’ve heard a Weasley say that before. Though, with how your family sees you, I understand the reluctance. However young child, Gryffindor is a path you should consider.’</p><p>	‘No.’ Frederick is adamant about it, he won’t get Gryffindor.</p><p>	The Sorting Hat chuckles inside of Frederick’s head, “Oh well then. How about Ravenclaw? You are quite the studious boy. Though, there is a drive, a purpose behind all of your actions. A deep seated desire to forge your own path. Yes, yes. I’ll place you in SLYTHERIN!’</p><p>His tie turns green and silver as the Slytherin tables solemnly claps. Select Wotters clap along, Teddy and Vict (who are already students) being the main ones. He gets up and heads towards his new house, pleased with the outcome.</p></div>
