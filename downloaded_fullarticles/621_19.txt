          <div class="userstuff"><p>As Draco walks into the room of requirement Harry notices that he is nervous. He can’t blame him, he had nightmares for weeks after watching 'the shining' for the first time. The picture of Jack Torrance breaking down the door of his Hogwarts dorm haunted him. Harry tried to make it as romantic as possible, he has set up a picnic-style dinner on the floor, except that instead of a basket he’s got popcorn and soft drinks. The projector is big enough to almost take up the entire wall. The candles are the only source of light and there are pillows everywhere. He knows Draco has never been to the cinema or seen a muggle movie for that matter. He wonders if a horror movie was the best choice, he probably should have picked something like 'legally blonde' or 'how to lose a guy in 10 days', but it’s too late to change it now.<br/>
“Are you sure you are ok with watching a horror film?”<br/>
Draco knows he is going to regret agreeing to watch a muggle movie about a guy who literally goes insane in a hotel and tries to kill his family, but Harry put in so much effort into this that it would break his heart if he said no. “Yeah,  I mean, it can’t be that scary,” he says trying to seem as relaxed as possible.<br/>
“Ok,” Harry says, with a soft smile now. ”Well, if you get too scared you can hold my hand”<br/>
Draco melts. He tries to sound tough but fails “What Potter? You think I a can’t handle a stupid muggle movie?”<br/>
Harry can see right through his act and knows that in the end, Draco will be so terrified that he probably will be too scared to walk back to his dorm so they will fall asleep here.  He made sure to bring blankets for when it gets cold and they can go get hot chocolates from the kitchens in the morning.<br/>
They sit down and the movie starts playing. Draco is already scared about what is going to happen, so he grabs Harry’s hand like he might die if he lets go and occasionally, pulling him into a big hug because if he is looking at Harry, then he is not thinking about the movie.  Harry sure as hell isn’t going to complain about it.</p></div>
