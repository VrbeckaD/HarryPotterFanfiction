          <div class="userstuff"><p>Rose Weasley walked into the heads dorm one Sunday morning. The day began an ordinary day. Rose sat on the couch, and proceeded to start her homework. Her roommate, or rather, the other Head, Scorpius Malfoy began to distract her, as usual.<br/>
“Morning Rosie.” “It’s almost eleven.” “That’s still morning.” Rose rolled her eyes. Scorpius sat next to her pulling out his potions essay. They sat in silence, both working on their homework.<br/>
Rose looked at the time. “Shit I promised I’d meet Dustin 10 minutes ago!” She groaned.<br/>
Rose ran out to the grounds, to find a very angry Dustin Woods. “You’re late.” “I’m sorry Dustin! I was doing homework and I lost track of time.” “Sure Rose. I bet that is exactly what happened.” “It is!” “What a lame excuse. You were clearly messing around with Malfoy again.” “What in Merlin’s name are you talking about?" “Don’t be dense Rose. I get it.” “GET WHAT?” “You’re cheating on me with Malfoy.” “Excuse me?” Rose spluttered. “It’s obvious. You don’t need to lie anymore.” “You’re insane Dustin.” “I’m done Rose. You can go back to your Malfoy boy now.” Rose stared at him, trying to tell if he was serious. As she began to walk away, he yelled “Elena Zabini has bigger boobs than you anyway!”<br/>
Rose walked into the dormitory in tears. “Merlin Rose, what’s wrong?” “That asshole thought I was late because I was SLEEPING WITH YOU.” Rose spat. “You weren’t.” “No shit, Sherlock.” Rose sniffled. “He broke up with me, and then told me that Elena Zabini has bigger boobs than me.” “He was cheating on you?” “Because of my boobs apparentally.”<br/>
There was a moment of silence.<br/>
“I think you have nice boobs.” Scorpius said. Rose looked at him with a look of pure insanity. “You’ve never even seen them!” “You don’t lock the bathroom door.” “You watch me bathe?” Rose screamed. “Never. That’s a violation of your trust in me.” “Then how did you see my boobs?” “I had to piss Rose. Really bad. I almost wet myself. The bathroom door was open so I assumed it was empty. You were in there, taking a bath, so I caught a glimpse of you, but I ran out almost as quick as I walked in.” “Where did you pee then?” Scorpius turned red. “I....couldn’t.” He mumbled. Rose looked confused, before her eyes widened, realizing what he meant.<br/>
"You really think I have nice boobs?” Rose said at last. “Yes.” Scorpius responded. Rose grinned, turning to straddle him on their couch. “You want to see them again?” She murmured. Scorpius nodded in delight. Rose leaned closer, sealing the gap between their lips. She knocked him over almost immediately, as her tounghe snakes into his mouth. Scorpius’s lips trailed down the side of her neck, down to her T-shirt. He unbuttoned it, still sucking on her shoulder. Rose used her arms to pull his bottoms off.
Scorpius fumbled with Rose’s bra, before it fell off. He could see her boobs now, and he knew he was right about them. 
A knock on the heads door made them sit up. “It’s Albus!” Al said. Rose groaned. “One sec!” She yelled. Just moments ago she’d been full of passion, the next, quickly slipping her T-shirt on. 
She opened the door. “I punched him.” Albus said. “Oh.... I. Good for you.” Rose mumbled. “What’s that on your neck?” Albus pointed. “Shit.” Rose said. “What do you think it is Albus?” “Did he do that?” “No....” Rose said. “Do you mean that finally after 7 years of sexual tension, you finally kissed Scorpius?” “Fuck off Albus.” “Hey! I was just letting you know I have detention for a week because I punched your ex.” Rose instantly felt bad. “I’m sorry Albus!! I really appreciate it. I’m kinda....busy right now. Now isn’t a good time.” 
“Eww, I don’t want to know.” Albus said. “See you later Rose.” 
Rose closed the door and jumped on Scorpius. 
“Now where were we?”
