    <p>Hermione looked in the mirror and sighed. She almost never let petty things like her insecurity get to her. Yet, for the past week or two, she kept finding herself in front of the full length mirror in her muggle bedroom. She wasn’t upset with how she looked necessarily, but how others would act around her when she got back. Puberty had finally caught up to her 17 year old body and it was starting to show. She didn’t wan’t her male friends or peers treating her any differently because she looked somewhat more of a lady now. Whether they’re trying to act more gentlemen like or obnoxiously trying to get her attention, she didn’t like the influence looks could have.  She had always known the majority of her classmates liked and respected her because of her intellect and the fact that she was a likable person. But now? Her now fuller breasts, lean body and elegant features might make the line between people just being friendly and people faking friendliness for attention get blurry.   <em>Hermione Granger, Brightest witch of my age, worried about boys and looks rather than my education, </em>she thought. Of course it was more than that, but it helped to just put it to the side for now. She scoffed at the vintage mirror and went to pack the rest of her things for the year. It wasn’t like her to worry about such things. She was smart and independent and even though Ron would probably notice the change more than anyone, she knew they would come around. She was still good old Hermione to them. “Hermione Granger. Brightest witch of my age and proud member of the golden trio.” That sounded better. Not excepting anything less, she finished packing and got into the back of her parents’ car. She smiled at the thought of seeing her friends again. Who cares what people thought of her? She could handle it. And besides, being treated differently just makes her true friends stand out more.</p>
