    <p>Seungkwan was late for potions again. Damn his stupid alarm clock. He swears it has a mind of its own. It either goes off too early or too late! You can pretty much guess which one happened today. So now Professor Slughorn was going to murder him for being late to class again.</p><p>Seungkwan really enjoyed potions, you could almost say he had a passion for it, especially for learning how to make different potions but one person always ruins it. Hansol Vernon Chwe. The most bigheaded, egotistic guy Seungkwan had ever met in his life. His hair was almost always perfectly placed in an updo, his black hair framed his blemish-free face in a way that Seungkwan had never seen before. Hansol was tall but he had a perfect body shape, muscle in all the right places. Seungkwan would be lying if he said he wasn't jealous but as his mother would say, good looks aren't everything. Hansol would make snide remarks throughout the lesson that usually were aimed at Seungkwan, making the older flip out which usually ends up with them both screaming at eachother and eventually leading to both of them being given detention. Its been the same routine ever since the first year that he was accepted into Hogwarts. Hansol would make snide remakes, Seungkwan would shout at him then they would argue and get into trouble. A constantly repeating cycle.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hansol found potions so boring. It would be interesting if Professor Slughorn actually let them produce their own potions but recently all he has done is drone on and on about Amortentia so of course Hansol wasn't listening. He already knew all about Amortentia since his roommate Chan (but as he liked to be called "Dino") was fanatic about potions and often rambled to Hansol about how theres a potion for basically everything, there's even a potion that can give you good luck and he can't deny that Chan really does excel in potions, he really does know his shit especially when it comes to making potions. Once he made a polyjuice potion for Hansol and his friends so they could play a prank on some poor first years.</p><p>The only thing, well more like person, that actually made Potions interesting and more bearable was Boo Seungkwan, the loud, happy-virus of a boy from the Hufflepuff House, he was often too loud and too happy in Hansol's opinion, especially when he strolls into the great hall during breakfast looking full of life with a big smile, his uniform perfectly neat and his hair immaculate. Lesson had started 10 minutes ago and yet the mentioned Hufflepuff was not present, Hansol realised he was probably running late usual.</p><p>Seungkwan ran from the Hufflepuff dorms to potions which was all the way down by the Slytherin dungeons. By the time he was near the steps leading to the classroom he was out of breath and panting but he didn't care because a bit of running was worth it if it meant that Slughorn wouldn't shout at him. Seungkwan ran to the door and pushed it open with such a force that it hit the wall behind it with a loud bang, nearly snapping clean off its hinges and scaring the shit out of everyone in the room. Hansol scoffed and rolled his eyes at the dramatic entrance of the red-faced Hufflepuff, a scowl formed on his face when he realised that Seungkwan's clothes and hair were still as perfect as ever even though he had clearly just ran all the way from the Hufflepuff dorms.</p><p>"I'm so sorry, professor! My alarm didn't go off so I woke up late!!" Seungkwan shouted, well more like screamed before scrunching his nose in disgust "and oh my god! Why does the whole room stink of Hansol's cologne?! Yuck!!"</p><p>The scowled was wiped straight off of Hansol's face and was replaced with a look of shock as both he and the other students in the classrom collectively let out a loud gasp, making Seungkwan frown in confusion. "What?" He asked to the now silent room as he connected his eyes with Hansol who had a look of suprise written all over his face. </p><p>Hansol had run out of cologne two weeks ago, he was waiting for his mother to send him some from America via owl which could only mean one thing. Hansol knew that the Amortentia potion smelt different to everyone in the room. He knew that it smelt like things associated to people that you really love. Seungkwan could smell his cologne in the Amortentia. Seungkwan loved him. </p><p>"My dear boy," Professor Slughorn said with a timid smile and a sly glint in his eye. He held up a small vial of bright pink liquid, "do you know what this is?"</p><p>"Yes? Of course I do. It's Amortentia." Seungkwan replied and in that moment he knew that he'd fucked up. His eyes went wide with shock and he could feel his face turning as red as a tomato once he realised what had happened. He had smelt Hansol's cologne in the amortentia; The most powerful love potion in existance. He had basically admitted that he loved Hansol in front of the whole of the Hufflepuff and Slytherin potions class.</p><p>"Oh shit." </p><p>Seungkwan covered his face with his hands in a attempt to hide his teary eyes before running out of the room. As soon as Seungkwan was out of the door everyone turned to stare at Hansol.</p><p>"Aren't you going to go after him then boy!" Exclaimed Professor Slughorn. Hansol stood there in shock for a moment before walking quickly out of the room following Seungkwan, slamming the potion classroom's door behind him.</p><p>Luckily for Hansol's long legs, he caught up with Seungkwan just enough to see him sneak behind one of the curtained windows next to the library. Hansol quietly lifted one of the curtains and slipped behind it to sit next to Seungkwan who was sitting with his face in his knees as he quietly sobbed.</p><p>"If that's Soonyoung or Seokmin go away I'm fine, I promise. If it's anyone else. Piss off." Seungkwan mumbled, he really couldn't deal with seeing anyone at that moment, he just needed to be alone. </p><p>"Well, what if it's me?" Hansol said timidly, a small smile appeared on his face when he saw Seungkwan whip his head towards the younger, eyes wide with shock and embarrassment. Hansol reached over and with the pad of his thumb he gentley wiped away the tears on his tear-stained face. Seungkwan's breathing hitched before he went back to burying his face into his hand, this time out of pure embarrassment, and he couldn't but feel a flicker of something in his heart.</p><p>"I'm sorry." Seungkwan whispered to the younger boy, "I'm sorry for embarrassing you infront of the whole class. I'm sorry for the amount of shit you're going to get from the assholes in this school."</p><p>"Kwan, why are you apologising?" Hansol replied. He reached out slowly and grabbed Seungkwan's hands, pulling them away from the others face which earned a whine from Seungkwan. "Do you want to know what I smelt in the Amortentia?" Seungkwan shyly nodded his head.</p><p>Hansol connected his eyes with Seungkwan's before saying "I could smell the delicious scent of Jeju tangerines."" Seungkwan let out a gasp as he realised what was happening. "It's a smell that plagues my mind every single day, it's a smell comforts me." Hansol took in a deep breath before he continued. "Seungkwan, I like you."</p><p>Slowly Seungkwan wrapped his arms around Hansol's waist, pulling him close to his body. Hansol's hands rested on Seungkwan's hips which were warm and slightly squishy but cute. Hansol pulled Seungkwan into his lap, wrapping his arms around the other boy's waist pulling him closer and closer. </p><p>"Hansol, I like you too." </p><p>Hansol never realised how beautiful Seungkwan eyes were before he saw them up close, they twinkled like stars. Slowly Seungkwan leaned towards Hansol, connecting their lips in a kiss that was slow and passionate. Hansol had, had his fair share of experiences in the past but this felt different. This felt... right, like he was destined to kiss Seungkwan. </p><p>Seungkwan pulled away and rested his head on Hansol's chest.</p><p>"Wow... That was-" "Unbelievable." Said Hansol breathlessly. </p><p>"Yeah" Seungkwan said as he admired Hansol's face. His lips were slightly more red and puffy then earlier on and his breaths were slightly ragged but he still looked as gorgeous as ever. </p><p>"So... You like the smell of my cologne do you?" Asked Hansol with a smirk. Seungkwan blushed and hit his arm. "Oh, shut up will you!!"</p>
