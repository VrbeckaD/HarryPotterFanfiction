  <strong>Timeless Addiction</strong>
</p><p align="center">SM &lt;3</p><hr/><p>Hermione sat in the dining hall, alone. As of late, she found herself eating at odd times; early in the morning, which led to an early lunch and dinner. Unusual times, where the dinning hall only had a couple of students. She avoided the Great Hall when there were many students--too many stares,  questions and murmurs. </p><p>Hermione shook her head clear and closed her eyes, searching for peace deep in her mind. Her mind was at upmost peace when she was alone, finding that if she were in the company of others she would become anxious. An unhealthy habit that she picked up while on the run with Harry and Ron. </p><p>Hermione still woke up at odd times of the night—1:15, 2:25, 3:10, 4:50, 5:30— because her brain was so programmed to checking up on the boys to ensure they were still there with her-still breathing, still alive. Her dreams were still haunted by the things she witnessed that year, the dead bodies lined up and ready to be claimed… the worst nightmares were the ones with Bellatrix Lestrange. She would be on the floor of the Malfoy Manor begging for her life, until suddenly it all stopped and Dobby's lifeless eyes were staring into her own. </p><p>"Hello Hermione!" A chipper blonde-haired girl took a seat across from her. Her name was Elizabeth Murdock, a second year Gryffindor. Every morning she would sit across from Hermione and eat her breakfast. Sometimes she would talk to her but other times she wouldn't say a word. On her silent days her eyes would remain on her plate, her mind clearly somewhere else. Hermione had yet to ask her who she lost or how. In return Elizabeth didn't ask Hermione about the war. </p><p>"Good morning Elizabeth." Hermione responded and continued to read the <em>Daily Prophet</em>.</p><p>"Anything good in there?"</p><p>Hermione wished it were a silent day, she didn't feel like entertaining anyone.</p><p>"No, the usual. They found a couple death eaters, fixed something in Hogmeade, someone got an award. Blah, blah."</p><p>"Exciting news."</p><p>"Very."</p><p>Hermione liked Elizabeth. She knew when to ask the right questions, when to continue a conversation and when to let it die, which was refreshing. Since the Battle of Hogwarts, being questioned and stared at was constant.</p><p>Harry, Ron and Hermione promised to put the past behind them. They swore to not tell anyone all of the specifics of their adventure which concluded just five months ago. All the world knew was that there was no chance of Voldemort returning. The wizarding world was not satisfied with that answer. Everyone tried to figure out how they took down the biggest threat to the Wizarding World. How’d they survived almost a year on the run. There were already books being written on their opinion and their<em> lies</em>. </p><p>Pictures were always taken, the Golden Trio was constantly followed and there always seemed to be someone holding a pen and notepad at their side at all times. So when it was announced that Hogwarts will open its doors in September, Hermione did not hesitate to pack her bags and march right onto the Hogwarts express. The perfect place to hide from everyone and everything.</p><p>When she first arrived, the other students were a bit obsessive but after the third day she was old news to them. Harry and Ron thought it would be worse, but when she told them that things were pretty normal they decided to join her.</p><p>"What's one more year?" Harry said nudging Ron.</p><p>"Yeah, I guess. I miss my girl." Ron gave her a kiss and it was decided. They were scheduled to arrive tomorrow.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, she wanted them here. Yes, she enjoyed her moments of solitude but just yesterday Hogwarts received another student looking to complete their seventh year and she thought it would be better if they were at her side...</p><p>"The Slytherin table seems to grow every day," Elizabeth said peeping over at them. This was true. When Hermione got to Hogwarts there were only nine Slytherins in total. Now, they racked up to twenty-nine. Everyone was weary of them. Even professors were told to keep an extra eye on them. Students of the other houses were warned to do the same.</p><p>Hermione thought it was very unfair for the Slytherin students brave enough to return to be put under further scrutiny not only by professors but also their fellow students. If they were present, they were cleared by the ministry, some she thought even Harry had vouched for.</p><p>But that didn't stop students in the other houses from tormenting them.</p><p>Elizabeth was still eyeing the Slytherin table, but Hermione didn't bother to look back. She knew he was watching her. He always was.</p><p>"I guess they feel safer in here."</p><p>Elizabeth scrunched up her nose. "But will we if there's more of them."</p><p>Hermione reached to hold the girls hand. "There is no reason to live in fear anymore. No one can hurt us. He’s gone. The students--the children--sitting at that table are all innocent." She smiled and stood up. "Now, I'll best be going. I'll be in the library if you want any company. If not, I'll see you tomorrow morning?"</p><p>Elizabeth grinned and nodded eagerly.</p><p>Hermione made her way to the doors. <em>Don't look up Hermione, don't look up Hermione</em>. But right before slipping out of the dining hall she glanced at the Slytherin table.</p><p>He was gone.</p><hr/><p>It was nine o'clock, an hour until curfew when Hermione left the library. She would've stayed longer if it wasn't for the fact that her eyes were closing on their own accord. And not to mention the fact that she begun to appreciate her room. She was given a single. It was large, not extravagant but it came with its own bathroom. Traditionally the room is given to the Head Girl but no one was assigned that year. McGonagall swore it wasn't special treatment and Hermione didn't argue it; she liked the privacy.</p><p>She spotted Neville Longbottom speaking to Seamus Finnigan in the Gryffindor common room. Neville came back another year so that the last memory he had of Hogwarts wasn't the mental, physical and emotional abuse he endured for almost year. He was one of the reasons Hermione returned, as Neville sent her and the rest of their year a letter asking them to return. He wanted desperately for this year to feel as normal as possible. Some were back, like Seamus and a couple others, but not many. Hermione told him Ron and Harry were going to return and he was very ecstatic to break the news to everyone.</p><p>Neville waved at her, "they'll all be back within a week for sure!"</p><p>"Definitely." She smiled and walked up the stairs.</p><p>When she got to her room she slowly stripped down to her underwear then walked over to the mirror. The year she spent out in the mountains, along with the stress of the war, did a toll on her body. The day after the war ended and she looked into a mirror she didn't recognize herself. She lost a lot of weight, her skin pale as a ghost and eyes were sullen with dark bags. So, she spent the summer eating under the sun and joined Harry in his daily morning runs to balance all the nothing she did. Mrs. Weasley's cooking helped assist in her weight gain and as she presently looked in the mirror, she looked healthier than ever. Her color had returned, as did round cheeks and her subtle curves. She didn't bother with her hair on the run, mostly keeping it in a braid so it had grown and her wild curls reached her mid back. In August she chopped a few inches and invested in healthy hair potions. Her hair was now fuller and curlier than ever. </p><p>Hermione walked away from her reflection and went to open the door of her closet when suddenly she was pressed against it by a male body. Her natural extinct would be to scream but she new who it was. </p><p>He begun to kiss the back of her neck, a trail of kisses from the top of her spinal cord to her earlobe. Soft kisses that gave her goose bumps and made her stomach flutter. He knew this, and his hands went down her arms and finally entwined his fingers with hers. He was still pressed on her, clearly taking advantage of her defenseless position. He smiled into her neck before biting down on it, softly. She gasped and within that breath he quickly released her body and turned her around to face him.</p><p>She was suddenly staring into molten silver eyes. The same eyes that she had adored for almost eight years. The same eyes that were still a mystery to her.</p><p>The same silver eyes that she missed terribly but would never admit aloud.</p><p>Her heart was beating so hard against her chest she was sure he could hear it. "You shouldn't be here." She whispered. She was suddenly dizzy and unable to breathe correctly. He stared into her wide eyes--looking for something in them. Whatever it was, he found it and it was followed by a kiss. </p><p>This wasn't a soft kiss. It was hard, longing, and<em> hungry</em>. He kissed her as if he was starving. He kissed her as if he hadn't had a meal in days. Hermione kissed him back just as hard until it became a battle, a competition. He was alway competitive but she always won. </p><p>He bit her lip and she pulled on his hair. He let out a low growl and picked her up. She wrapped her legs around his waist and moaned when she felt his bulge against her inner thigh. He started to move them towards her bed, and put her down gently, Kissing her down to her chest until he reached a pebbled nipple and slipped it into his mouth. His hand played with the other one, tugging and pulling until it pebbled in his hands. </p><p>Hermione moaned, her breath jagged. She grabbed his head and bought it back up to her mouth. Already missing his lips on her own. <em>She missed him.</em> Then she reached to pull his shirt over his head in one quick motion. She undid the buckle of his pants, started to pull it down but he quickly kicked it off him, never letting go of her lips. The only thing that separated them then was her underwear. He let go of her lips and started to kisses down her neck again. But this time slower.</p><p>He put his head into the crook of her neck, breathed deeply and said, "I missed you."</p><p>She didn't say a word, and he didn't expect her to, but the damage was done and his voice brought her back to reality.</p><p>She ended this a long time ago.</p><p>"S-stop." She whispered. She turned her head to the side, away from the spell he always seemed to cast over her.</p><p>He paused. "What?"</p><p>She quickly took the chance to push him off her and ran to her closet to pull on a shirt. She didn't turn around to look at him but she heard him get off the bed and put on his pants.</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath. "I told you I don't want to do this anymore." She turned around to face him. He was leaning on the canopy of her bed his arms over his bare chest. She stared into his eyes. He was not yet angry but he would be soon.</p><p>"You said after the war-"</p><p>"After the war, what?! We'll be back to sneaking behind everyone's back? Going out only when everyone else in the world is sleeping—"</p><p>"So we're back to the same bullshit, Granger? You're right back to making excuses."</p><p>"I ended this." She said sternly. "It was over the moment you let those death eaters into Hogwarts. The moment I<em> begged</em> you not to. The moment I told you I-I—" She paused. "You walked away from me." She said steadily. "<em>You</em> walked away from <em>me</em>.”</p><p>Before she could move he grabbed her face and kissed her. The same kiss that never failed to put her under his spell. She couldn't breathe when he kissed her, she couldn't think, she couldn't control herself.</p><p>He let go of her. His forehead on hers, their nose touching.</p><p>She closed her eyes and whispered, "I'm with Ron."</p><p>He froze and stepped back. She wasn't looking at his face so she couldn't read his expression. She heard him walk towards the bed and grab his shirt</p><p>"I love him."</p><p>He begun to laugh. "You were just moaning my name a minute ago Granger, that means <em>shit</em> to me."</p><p>Hermione glared at him angrily, unable to say a word.</p><p>"You can't lie to me." He put on his shirt then walked toward her and frowned when she took a step back. "But I'll leave, if that's what you want."</p><p>He then leaned into her, his lips brushing against ear. "Just remember--you're mine Granger. Always." He walked to her door and opened it.</p><p>"Draco." She called, stopping him in his tracks. "Just let me go." Hermione said barely above a whisper and the door slammed shut behind him.</p>
