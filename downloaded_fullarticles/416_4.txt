    <p>“I’m so tired of this, I can’t keep doing it anymore!” Scorpius cried out.</p><p>“Well then imagine how I feel! I’m so sorry you have to deal with MY bullshit!” Albus screamed back.</p><p>“Stop!” Scorpius yelled, and put his hands on the table to support himself. He was shaking. “Stop! You always do this! You always victimize yourself to not take any responsibility for your behaviour!”</p><p>“Oh, now you are just sounding like my father” Albus scoffed. “You know how I am. You know how this is. You’ve always knew.”</p><p>“You keep doing it!” Scorpius yelled in frustration. “You bring up your father, your family, your depression! There’s always some bloody excuse and at the end of the day you can never get your shit together!”</p><p>“I am trying! I’m sorry it’s not so fucking easy for me to get a job, to find a career I’m passionate about. Not everyone is so bloody perfect like you-“</p><p>“Don’t make this about me!”</p><p>“IT IS ABOUT YOU!” Albus screamed “It’s so fucking easy for you to pressure me! You had perfect grades, you were always so bloody smart and talented, and you knew I sucked!” his voice broke, unable to contain the emotions “You always knew, Scorpius. I’ve always been shit at magic, at school, at everything. You knew this was going to be hard and you said you were going to be there for me and now-“</p><p>“I’ve been there for 10 years Albus!” Scorpius yelled “ten bloody years and nothing has changed.”</p><p>Albus finally broke down, shaken by Scorpius’ tone, thick tears falling down his cheeks. “Oh I’m sorry this is SO hard on you!” He spat. “You are not the one who can’t find a stable job, you know? Or finish a fucking career, or figure things out, or just keeps being a bloody disappointment to everyone. I’m trying, I’m fucking trying. You know that better than anyone. I’m trying and I’m still failing and if you are tired of it imagine how tired I am!”</p><p>“This isn’t about your career!” Scorpius screamed, tears now running down his cheeks. “I don’t care if you don’t have a job, or a career or anything. I am tired of this!” He gestured around.</p><p>“What?” Albus asked. “Me?” The anger in his voice was becoming more visible.</p><p>“No? Yes?” Scorpius stopped for a second. “I don’t fucking know!” He cried out frustrated “I don’t know anymore! I am tired of you mopping around all the time, I’m tired of your sulky mood and our arguments and I’m tired of your self-hatred and of us going over and over the same issues all the time!” He was yelling.</p><p>“You said you understood.” Albus was shaking so much it was hard to speak. “You said there was nothing wrong with me-“</p><p>“I never said that.” Scorpius accused. “I always told you you had to get better, that you could get better.”</p><p>“And what is this all about now?” He mocked, darkly. </p><p>“We are 21 Albus.” </p><p>“I didn’t know there was a fucking deadline!” He cried, his voice breaking at the end, high and desperate. </p><p>“I’m tired!” Scorpius screamed “It feels like we are 15, like nothing changed.” He sunk into a chair, still crying, and covered his eyes with his hands. “I thought your moods would get better, that your relationship will your family would improve, that you would stop fighting with your dad all the time.” He swallowed with difficulty around his constricted throat, and continued with a voice shaking. “I thought your depression would get better, since you started seeing that therapist. That you’ll find a passion and a job but-“ He paused.</p><p>“But?” Albus asked.</p><p>“But nothing changed.” He looked at Albus, lost. He looked away. “I don’t know what to do.”</p><p>“Me neither.” Said Albus. He knew Scorpius was right, but he didn’t know what to do. He was as lost as Scorpius, and felt as tired and drained. </p><p>Scorpius looked up to him and they stared at each other in silence.</p><p>“You said you’d always be there.” Albus said softly.</p><p>“I am here.” Scorpius said just as softly.</p><p>“But you don’t want to.” Albus stated, his voice almost a whisper, as if he was afraid of the answer.</p><p>“I-“ Scorpius began. “I want to.” He said, but began crying again, and Albus’ heart broke for the millionth time that evening. “I’m just so tired.” He sounded truly pained and Albus felt his heart tugging. “It feels like we’ve been dancing around the same issues since we are 15 and it’s so suffocating, Albus, it’s so suffocating I-“ He sounded so desperate that Albus felt like crying again. “How much longer? How long will this be like this?”</p><p>“By this you mean myself?” Albus said. Scorpius remained silent. </p><p>Something inside Albus snapped, and the sadness was replaced by anger. </p><p>“Have you ever considered,” He began asking, his filled with venom. “That maybe this is me?” He paused, and Scorpius didn’t answer. “This is me. There’s no more.”</p><p>“Albus-“ Scorpius began.</p><p>“Maybe,” Albus continued, “you shouldn’t have started a relationship with someone you wanted to change. Maybe you should have accepted that this is just who I am.” He spat. “Why on earth are you dating me if I drown you so much?”</p><p>“That’s not…” Scorpius paused, taking a deep breath. “That’s not fair. This is just…. a part of you, not all. It’s not…“ He took a deep breath again, running his hand through his hair. “You were my best friend.” Albus was lost at the change in subject. “My only friend.” Scorpius continued. “And I loved you, so much. It was so much fun being with you, and yes, you were sulky, and moody, but everyone though it was just a phase, that you’ll grow out of it.”</p><p>“Yeah, the depression diagnostic hit everyone like a train.” Albus laughed darkly.</p><p>Scorpius shook his head. “But it never got better and… and we are not kids anymore. And now it’s just not fun.” Scorpius finished talking and the silence stretched across the room. </p><p>“I’m tired.” Albus finally said, and Scorpius looked at him. Without saying anything else, he turned around and walked to their bedroom.</p><p>“Albus, what are you-“ He heard Scorpius following him from the kitchen. </p><p>He ignored him as he knelt in front of their closet, opening a drawer and taking his clothes out.</p><p>“Albus what are you doing.” Scorpius’ voice was shaking, and he was clutching the door frame for support.</p><p>“I’m tired.” Repeated Albus. “And you are tired. And we are not kids and this isn’t fun anymore.” He looked at Scorpius as he paraphrased the words he had used.</p><p>“Albus-“</p><p>“No.” He stood up from where he was kneeling. “This me. This is us.” He gestured with his arms and dropped them in defeat. “There’s no more. You said it yourself, it’s been 10 years, we know each other inside out. This is us.” He paused. “Do you want it or not?”</p><p>Scorpius remained silent for a moment before speaking. “Albus-“</p><p>“Do you want it, or not?” He repeated, more sternly. </p><p>“We can fix-“</p><p>“Do you want it, OR NOT?” He yelled loudly, and Scorpius took a step back. “There’s nothing to fix. I’m tired of trying. This relationship seems to be built on your hopes that someday things will be different. And it’s not fair. You can’t be in love with the idea of the person I will someday become.”</p><p>“That is NOT it!” Scorpius yelled louder than Albus had ever heard him. “I love you! I’ve always loved you and you know it, don’t you dare imply that-!“</p><p>“But you want me to change!” Albus yelled back. “You’ve always wanted me to change!”</p><p>“For your own good! For Merlin sakes Albus I’m talking about your mental illness not about-“</p><p>“But it’s fucking there!” His voice was sore from screaming so much and it hurt. “My mental illness is bloody here. All my flaws are bloody here. My lack of talent, my lack of motivation, my moods, all of this has always been here and you keep saying that things will get better, but they don’t, and I can’t keep going because this-“ He paused and gestured at both of them. “This is what it is. That’s it” He said defeated. “It won’t change. So do you want it or not?”</p><p>Albus waited. Scorpius remained silent.</p><p>He kneeled down to empty the drawers. </p><p>(…)</p><p>“We said we’d always be friends.” The streets of London where packed with people, and the winter cold was harsh despite the bright sun.</p><p>“Yeah, well, we were kids, Scorpius.” Albus tugged at the strap on his shoulder, adjusting his backpack and avoiding eye contact.</p><p>The silence stretched for uncomfortable seconds until Scorpius broke it again.</p><p>“So you are leaving tomorrow?” It had been roughly 3 weeks since their break up, and Albus had done a fantastic job avoiding Scorpius ever since. But of course he had to run into him. England was truly too small.</p><p>“Yeah.” He didn’t feel like speaking, he wanted to run away. </p><p>“It’s official then?” He asked so softly that Albus almost didn’t hear him.</p><p>He finally turned his face to look at him. He looked terrible, Albus hadn’t seen him so bad since fourth year. The sadness in his eyes was unmaskable, his bottom lip was quivering the tiniest bit and he looked smaller than ever. In a horrible flashback, Albus found himself in front of a 14 years old Scorpius, small and fragile, asking him to come to his mother funeral. </p><p>It took all of Albus’ willpower not to hug him right there. He felt a knot on his throat, the pain of it threatening to let tears form in his eyes. His instinct to protect and comfort Scorpius was as natural and strong as breathing, and it hurt to resist it.</p><p>But he couldn’t. So he tugged at the strap of his backpack once more and avoided eye contact. </p><p>“I thought that was settled?” He said, his voice contained. </p><p>The silence stretched, and from the corner of his eyes Albus could see Scorpius’ feet fidgeting on the sidewalk. </p><p>“How long?” Scorpius finally asked.</p><p>“Does it matter?” He spat. Scorpius remained silent, so he just sighed. “I don’t know.” He answered.</p><p>Scorpius opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out. He closed it and tried once more, but finally gave up. He stood there, balancing on his feet. The silence was mortifying. </p><p>Albus finally broke it. “Goodbye, I guess.” He waited for another second before turning around.</p><p>“What if-“ Scorpius called back. Albus stopped on his tracks, but didn’t turn around. “What if you get a nightmare?” Scorpius continued. “What if I get a nightmare?”</p><p>Albus swallowed with some difficulty and turned his head back. “You can call me. You can owl me. I’ll always answer.”</p><p>“It won’t be the same.” Scorpius voice was a whisper. </p><p>Albus sighed and finally turned around. “Is this what we’ve become? Just a toxic coping mechanism?”</p><p>Scorpius let out a wobbly laugh, the tears prickling in his eyes. “We are the only ones that understand what the other went through, especially in fourth year I-“</p><p>“We can’t let our traumas tie us.” He interrupted, though the memories that Scorpius brought back clung at his heart and made it hard to breathe. “We’ve been through a lot… but our pain… we are just hurting each other because we can’t let go.”</p><p>Scorpius stood there, tears falling down his eyes. Albus clutched at the strap of his bag to contain himself from hugging Scorpius right there and then, like nothing else mattered.</p><p>But everything else mattered, so much.</p><p>So he turned around and walked away.</p><p>This time Scorpius didn’t call back. </p><p>(…)</p><p>Coming back to England wasn’t an easy decision. Five years had passed since he had decided to move to New York and the idea of coming back scared him more that he would ever admit. </p><p>But he missed his family, and his father had insisted in having him for Christmas and spending some time together. And Albus didn’t have much going on at New York anyways. </p><p>He had a small job, at a coffee shop. He wasn’t great at costumer service, but the smell of coffee and the catchy indie songs were a small comfort. And it provided an opportunity to meet new people. After all the city was full of tourists, each one of them with different backgrounds. He liked to think he learnt something new from every story he heard, though maybe it was wistful thinking.</p><p>He also had a small flat, too, with a view of a small park to one side and the blinding city lights on the other. And he also had some friends. They were wizards, but they also were New Yorkers who couldn’t care less about British history so they didn’t care what Harry Potter had done or what Hogwarts was like. </p><p>So he had friends, and he had casual one night stands, and a favourite restaurant down the block that made the best foreign dishes he had ever tried. He had a good time. But he still felt empty. </p><p>New York was nice, but it wasn’t him. It showed in the ways that Christmas never felt like they used to, it showed every time he remembered memories and had no one to share with. Every time he referenced and old inside joke and realized that he was the only one to understand it. </p><p>All his friends had different histories, different families. And New York was maybe too different from England, and traveling oversea to visit was hard and he missed his mom’s hugs. </p><p>So when his father called him via muggle phone, and he heard Lily screaming from behind and the explosion of one of Uncle George’s artefacts, he felt his heart tugging, and it only took his dad promising to make his favourite dessert to agree to go over for the holidays. </p><p>So there he was now, suitcase in hand as he knocked on the Potter’s door. His mother opened it, her bright red hair tied up in a messy pony tail, and her smile was so bright and familiar that Albus couldn’t help to smile back.</p><p>“Hey.” He said as he found himself crushed by his mother’s embrace. </p><p>“Baby…” His mother called him, as she kissed his hair, even though it’s been ages since he had become taller and bigger than her. “We’ve missed you.”</p><p>“I know,” He said, and tightened his arms around her. “I missed home too.”</p>
