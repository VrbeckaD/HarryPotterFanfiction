    <p>‘I’m going to tell you a story Clarissa and it’s a good one,’ Jocelyn told her five year old daughter softly. ‘About Solaris, the magic kingdom. Are you ready?’<br/>
Little Clary Garraway nodded, snuggling further into her mother’s warmth. She loved story time. The pair was lying on Clary’s bed in the dingy motel room they had rented with its peeling walls and slightly unappealing smell. This was the life Clary had always known. Motel rooms, sometimes free, sometimes not, shelters, empty apartments, the owners of which had gone on vacation. Never staying anywhere too long. This was how Clary had spent her first five years of life.<br/>
Through the gap in the curtains over the windows, the night sky was visible. A siren in the distance could faintly be heard. Clary liked her family’s travels. Liked visiting different places. She enjoyed falling asleep in the back of her parents’ car, never quite knowing where the family would end up. Her mother said these were ‘their adventures’.<br/>
Her father didn’t seem to like all the moving around though. Clary had heard her parents arguing as her mother had been packing to head to somewhere new only weeks after they had left their last place. But she had once heard her mother say that all the moving around was because of her job. Clary didn’t know what her mother’s job was but perhaps her father did. And perhaps that was why he always gave in.<br/>
Clary could see him now, asleep on the other bed in the room, black-skinned and handsome, his arm over his eyes. Her father, Luke Garroway.<br/>
‘Okay, so Solaris,’ Jocelyn, tightening her hold on her daughter a little, said, bringing Clary’s attention back to her. ‘Solaris, my little one, was a magical place. A place where magicwielders, nymphs and genies, faeries and pixies, centaurs, harpies and elves, fauns and satyrs, mermaids, griffins and more resided. Solaris was a beautiful place led by the Magisters. Everyone there lived in harmony. There was no jealousy or hatred. There was only happiness and love...’<br/>
Here Jocelyn trailed off.<br/>
‘Is Solaris a real place Mommy?’ Clary enquired innocently, and when Jocelyn, a faraway look on her face, did not respond, ‘Mommy?’<br/>
‘Hmmm?’ Jocelyn said, looking down at her daughter blankly for a moment before registering what she had said and smiling. ‘No. Of course it isn’t. Now come on, time to sleep.’<br/>
And as Jocelyn tucked a lock of Clary’s long red hair behind her ear, Clary’s eyes went to the tattoo on her mother’s neck. Reaching up a small hand, the wrist of which bore a bronze manacle, just as her other wrist did, Clary traced the tattoo with her finger. Black in colour, it coiled its way around an entire part of Jocelyn’s neck. Clary thought it was beautiful.<br/>
‘Good night mom,’ Clary said as she closed her eyes.<br/>
‘Night angel,’ Jocelyn whispered, her own wrists manacled too.<br/>
With a shudder, Clary shook her head of this memory. A lot had changed in the last eleven years. Her father, she had been informed at six years of age, had been mauled to death by a manticore one day when he had been out hunting for food in the woods near the shelter where they had been staying at the time. His death had caused her mother to lose her mind and now she was a patient in the Enfield Insane Asylum and didn’t remember anything of her old life, not even herself. Not even Clary. The doctors said she had been driven mad with grief.<br/>
Not any doctor nor any spell had been able to cure her. And it was because of her mother’s condition that Clary had had to move in with her uncles in their Nottingham apartment. They had been the ones to reveal and prove to her that the world of magic was in fact real. Clary had learnt that the beings in her mother’s story did actually exist. And so did Solaris.<br/>
She had learnt that the manacles her mother had made her wear had been magic stemming manacles, which had prevented her from using her magic for the first few years of her life. Why, she still didn’t know. And neither did her uncles who had been shocked to learn that they had a niece since Jocelyn had cut off all contact with them and all the rest of the family nearly a decade before.<br/>
But when her uncles, appalled that her mother had manacled her, had removed the manacles, Clary had discovered fragments of her magic, making her the fledgling she had been since birth, until she had turned thirteen and become a full fledged magicwielder.<br/>
With a sigh, Clary scanned her surroundings. She was sat in a little greasy spoon in Edwinstowe, the mundane- or non-magical- town outside the magical town, her hometown, of Felkirk. The name Liam’s was emblazoned on a neon sign that hung on the outside of the giant cafe window, the cafe itself situated beneath a sky that was presently dark, the crescent moon within it shining its radiance down upon the world.<br/>
Inside, the lights on the ceiling were blinking, threatening to go out altogether, and the Beatles were faintly emanating out of the speakers overhead. A couple of patrons were sat at one of the tables in the far corner. Behind the counter, the pudgy, balding owner Liam was pouring coffee into the grinder, intending on making another pot. A pimple-faced teenage boy was relaying an order to the chef in the kitchen.<br/>
Apprehensively, Clary sat waiting. Her skin the colour of caramel, a mixture of white and black, her body slender, dainty, her eyes hazel. She had left the party to come see her mundane boyfriend. She hoped he would show up soon so that she could be with him briefly before she returned.<br/>
She wondered if she should have dressed better. But she was comfortable in the shirt and jeans she was wearing and she supposed- or rather hoped- that was what mattered most. She regretted not having brought her sketchpad with her though. She liked to draw and could have<br/>
done it while she waited. Often it was her process of trying to cope with or make sense of whatever that was bothering her. Right then she would have drawn herself and Cory.<br/>
Only one person knew that she had left the party and Felkirk. Her best friend Simon Lewis. If her uncles discovered that she had come to see Cory after they had forbidden it... And today of all days.<br/>
She hoped they weren’t looking for her. There had been enough nocturnalites present on the rooftop that she had gone unnoticed for a while and she hoped that this was still the case. She had asked Simon to create a distraction if it proved necessary. Perhaps by singing a song, had been at Hogwarts. She knew that if her uncles found her missing, they would not be happy.<br/>
Jasper was going to be the angriest she was aware. Jerry wouldn’t be angry; he’d be disappointed, which was just as bad. And she knew they would be well within their rights to react this way. After all the time and money Jerry had spent to make sure this party was top notch, the last thing he or Jasper would want was for one of the guests of honour to go missing.<br/>
Today, the day of her, and her cousin Derrick’s, seventeenth birthday, was a doubly special occasion. Not only was it their birthday, it was also their pre- graduation party, both just excuses for Jerry, an avid party thrower, to throw a party. Clary knew that Jasper and Jerry wanted to celebrate both the birthday and the fact that she and Derrick would soon be graduating with her and Derrick; they had been talking about little else for weeks. She wasn’t going to deny them much longer.<br/>
The sudden sound of the door opening from over her shoulder had Clary turning in her seat. And she saw the one she had been waiting for entering the cafe. Cory. She smiled at the sight of him, butterflies erupting in her stomach, and when he spotted her, he grinned and approached.<br/>
‘Have you been waiting long?’ he asked when he had reached Clary’s table.<br/>
‘No,’ she replied, tucking a strand of her hair behind her ear and once he had sat down, ‘but, er, I can’t stay long.’<br/>
‘Oh,’ said Cory, his face falling. ‘I was kinda hoping we could hang out the rest of the night and celebrate your birthday.’<br/>
‘I’d like to,’ Clary said quickly. ‘But I’ve, er, got... sort of a party going on.’<br/>
Cory’s eyebrows rose.<br/>
‘You’re having a party? And you didn’t invite me? You never said anything so I assumed you weren’t having one.’<br/>
Clary hesitated. She hadn’t told him she was having a party before because she wasn’t having one in the mundane world. And him being a mundane, he was unable to see the magical world anyway due to the Sight that separated the worlds. Cory didn’t know that she was a magicwielder and it was against the Codex for her to tell him.<br/>
‘It- it’s complicated,’ Clary stammered in a low voice, conscious of the other people in the diner.<br/>
‘Complicated how?’ Cory asked, sounding both suspicious and intrigued.<br/>
‘I- I can’t say.’<br/>
Feeling slightly uncomfortable, Clary watched him give her a once over before he shrugged.<br/>
‘Whatever,’ he said, a sudden coldness in his voice. ‘Happy birthday I guess.’<br/>
Clary felt his distance, both in tone and demeanour. She hated it. She liked Cory. A lot. And she didn’t want him to not like her anymore. At twenty one old, he was a couple of years older and that had an allure all of its own.<br/>
‘You know,’ Cory said suddenly, bringing Clary out of her thoughts, ‘sometimes I wonder why I ever agreed to go out with you Clary. I mean, no offence but you kinda... freak me out a little.’<br/>
‘I freak you out?’ Clary asked, taken aback and a little hurt.<br/>
‘Well... yeah,’ said Cory, looking not at her but at Liam who had just started up the coffeemaker, resulting in a whirring sound ringing out throughout the cafe. ‘It was kinda exciting at first but- for one thing, you never let me come over and you never make an excuse either. It’s always just a flat out no and an apology. All the guys think it’s weird. No-one even knows where you live...’<br/>
Because, thought Clary, Felkirk is entirely magical and therefore mundanes cannot see it.<br/>
‘... or where you go to school,’ Cory continued. ‘And then there’s how you just show up sometimes. Like the other day, I was waiting for you. You weren’t there and I turn around and there you were, right there in the middle of the parking lot. It was literally like you appeared out of nowhere.’<br/>
Clary swallowed. She had known that casting a teleportation spell to bring her into the mundane world right behind Cory had been a bad idea. Reckless magic Jasper and Jerry would’ve called it. But she hadn’t talked to him in days and she’d been excited to see him.<br/>
‘And it was your idea for us to meet at night here,’ Cory went on, still not looking at her. ‘After that parking lot incident, I was even afraid I’d find you in my bedroom one night.’<br/>
Once thought Clary. Only once had she gone into his house, into his room, and watched him sleep. She had been in the magical world though so he wouldn’t have been able to see her even if he had been awake. It was after she had had a major disagreement with Jasper and Jerry. Hearing from her how she had begun to like like Cory, to her surprise and anger, they had forbidden her from seeing him any longer, afraid she would slip up and reveal to him what she was or what she was about to become. That was the reason Jasper or Jerry wanted her to make friends in the magical world, with those like her, who already knew everything and were going through the same thing themselves. Following the argument, Jasper had sent Clary to her room and she had snuck out and gone to see Cory, only to find him asleep. She had ended up watching him for a few minutes before feeling like a creep and leaving. Not that he would have known she was there even if he had been awake since she had been in the magical world. She hadn’t ever told him about this incident though. But now for him to say she freaked him out...<br/>
‘Look Clary,’ Cory said gently, turning to her. ‘I came here tonight... to call it quits. I- I thought we could have some drinks, some snacks, a few last hours together. But then, it was gonna be over. You’re just too... too peculiar for me. I don’t think we should go out anymore. I’m sorry.’<br/>
And he looked it. Watching him sigh and stand from his chair, she felt her mind race. She thought about what she could say to stop him leaving. If only she could tell him the truth. That magic was the reason for everything about her that he apparently deemed strange. Not that she could blame him, now that she thought about it.<br/>
She watched him walk back across the room, his hands in the pockets of his shorts. He didn’t look back once and she didn’t try and stop him, not knowing what she could say, what excuse she could give. Seconds later the door closed behind him.<br/>
Exhaling a breath as heavy as her heart, she thought the spell teleportus magical worldus. Now in the magical world, she watched Cory walk past the window. His words replayed in her mind and she bit down on her lip. She did really like him but even if she managed to somehow make things okay between them, she would still have to hide the biggest part of herself from him, just as she had done for the six months they had been going out.<br/>
Clary blinked and he was gone. But there was someone else standing on the other side of the glass, staring through it, frowning at her. Dressed in ripped jeans and a faded t-shirt, one of the beanie hats from his vast collection atop his head, Derrick. And he wasn’t alone; Kevin, the Garroways’ scruffy black tabby cat was by his side.<br/>
Clary swallowed as, leaving Kevin outside, Derrick entered the cafe. Prepared herself for the rebuking she was probably going to get, she watched him come and take the chair Cory had vacated moments ago.<br/>
‘Hey,’ she said quietly, meeting his questioning gaze. ‘How’d you find me?’<br/>
‘Followed your scent,’ Derrick replied, just as quietly.<br/>
‘Of course you did.’<br/>
‘You left the party,’ Derrick continued. ‘I asked Simon where you'd gone and he said you wanted to be alone, reckoned you'd show up again when you’d had a breather or two.’<br/>
Her eyes on the table, Clary did not respond and Derrick leaned forward on the table in almost an interrogatory manner.<br/>
‘Simon lied didn’t he?’ he asked. ‘You came to see that mundie boy didn’t you? I picked up his scent when I caught yours. I just saw him leaving too. You know you’re lucky Dad and Jerry don’t know that you never stopped seeing him, that you’ve been dating him or that you left the party for him. I told you you were running a risk a mundie wasn’t worth-’<br/>
‘Well then,’ Clary interrupted glumly, ‘you’ll be glad to know that he dumped me.’<br/>
And before a surprised looking Derrick could respond,<br/>
‘Come on,’ she sighed, getting to her feet, knowing there was no point staying in the cafe now. ‘We should get back to the party.’<br/>
Swallowing down the lump in her throat- because it was never nice to be broken up with- she exited the cafe, Derrick in tow. Once out on the silent street, beneath the orange glow of a streetlamp, she smiled down at Kevin who yowled at her in greeting while Derrick exited Liam’s.<br/>
‘Want a ride?’ Derrick asked her with an attempt at cheerfulness.<br/>
‘... Sure,’ Clary replied with a subdued shrug.<br/>
Derrick nodded and Clary observed as he transformed before her, turning from a magicwielder into an adolescent grey werewolf. More specifically they were crossbreeds; half-werewolves and half-magicwielders, which was why they possessed magic as well as everything werewolf. She envied this about him and Jasper. They were both werewolves. However, Clary was only too aware that theirs wasn’t an easy way of life. She didn’t envy the struggle.<br/>
In thoughts of Cory, Clary climbed onto Derrick’s back and held on as he set off at a pace that wasn’t fast but wasn’t slow either. Down the street, the bright light of the streetlamps flashing past, the moon following them, her hands wrapped in Derrick’s fur, Kevin trotting after them as they made their way back to the party.<br/>
Several thoughts ran through Clary's mind. So much was about to happen for her. She was set to graduate from Hogwarts. Sure she missed Cory. Sure losing him hurt. It hurt a lot. It was her first break-up after all. But he had dumped her. And it was up to him to realise his mistake. She wasn't going to- she was going to try and not to- sit and stew over him any more than she had already done so. Jasper and Jerry had taught her better than that.</p>
