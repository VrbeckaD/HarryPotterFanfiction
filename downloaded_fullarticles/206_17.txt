    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Aurors, Draco decided, could go piss on Merlin’s wand. All of them. Collectively. Make it a circle piss.</p>
<p>“Aurors Aid Former Death Eater in Relocation Project” the Prophet headline read. He closed his eyes, peeked again. It stayed the same. Right in the center Draco shook hands with Weasley. In a transparent attempt to keep his identity secret, his facial features had been blurred. Of course, that did nothing to obscure his white blond hair, his impeccable robes, the <em> Malfoy crest facing the camera. </em>Bloody Aurors had told him his identity could remain private.</p>
<p>The caption read: “Despite torture of his Fiancée, Hermione Granger, at the residence of this former Death Eater, Junior Auror Ronald Weasley magnanimously offers him a second chance.”</p>
<p>It was common knowledge that Voldemort used Malfoy Manor as his headquarters. And since Skeeter had published that ‘biography’ on Harry Potter, the wide Wizarding World knew Granger had been tortured there.</p>
<p>Lucius would be furious. He hated being <em> reminded </em>.</p>
<p>And there was the small problem that Draco hadn’t told his father about asking the aurors for a flat. Draco had been arranging to move away from the manor since his two-year house arrest ended. Six months since then, and he had an ugly flat to show for it. It was Friday. Lucius thought Draco was visiting Blaise. And Blaise was well acquainted with many young ladies, especially pure-blooded ladies, and especially Pansy. Lucius almost raised both eyebrows when Draco told him of his plans. That meant he was ecstatic.</p>
<p>Draco sighed and nearly incinerated the paper, then thought better of it. He needed a physical copy to threaten Weasley with. Instead, he simply set it on the table. It was an ugly folding card table, one of the four pieces of furniture <em> magnanimously </em> provided by Junior Auror Weasley and his compassionate team of aurors. The Relocation Initiative for Former Supporters (REFS) approached him a month ago with two options: suck its cock or humiliate himself further, and Draco had never enjoyed being humiliated. Turns out, sucking its cock had given him a cushy little flat in Merlin-knows-where Scotland that smelled like piss. Supposedly it would be better than dealing with gossip magazines back at the Manor.</p>
<p>At least there was a storefront downstairs and a floo. REFS also offered employment for their ‘cases.’ Draco was going to start a coffee shop. With any luck the Scots would appreciate fine coffee when they saw it.</p>
<p>The floo rang, stirring Draco from his thoughts. It was Mr. Magnanimous, Junior Auror Weasley.</p>
<p>“Malfoy!” He greeted, smiling professionally. “I trust you’ve seen the paper?”</p>
<p>Professional wasn’t a good look on him. “Good morning. How did you get my floo address?”</p>
<p>“I sold you the place,” He said, looking like he was making a real effort to keep from rolling his eyes.</p>
<p>Draco nodded. “But still dreadfully rude to call without asking. A real faux pas, even for you,”</p>
<p>Weasley opened his mouth to object.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t a dig at your mother, just at you. Percival and Charles have wonderful manners,” Draco let the hint of a smug smile creep onto his face. “And I’m not in the mood for talking politics, so if this isn’t a social call I’ll be very disappointed. How is your fiancee?”</p>
<p>“Er, great, thanks. I’m sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Malfoy, but–”</p>
<p>“One moment,” Draco said. He summoned his French press and Blue Mountain beans. He didn’t need any more bitterness this morning, so the Jamaican Arabica was perfect. Weasley fidgeted as Draco ground the beans with a charm and poured them into the press. Using a modified <em> Auguamenti </em> he filled the press with nearly boiling water, then stirred the mixture with his wand. Draco liked to put a little bit of magic in his morning coffee. It made him feel like a renowned potions master. He set a timer for four minutes precisely. Weasley looked ready to implode and cast subtle <em> Tempus </em> charms every two seconds. Draco kept his smirk to himself as he pushed the press down, trapping the crushed beans in the bottom of the contraption. He summoned a mug and poured his coffee into it. After an excruciatingly slow sip (Weasley’s eye twitched!), Draco was ready. “Disappoint me, please,”</p>
<p>“I trust you’ve seen the Prophet this morning?”</p>
<p>“No,” Draco said, making sure Weasley could see the paper he was using as a coaster.</p>
<p>“In that case, I would like to extend a formal apology on behalf of the Auror department that your image was taken and produced without your express consent, and–”</p>
<p>“You must have heard me wrong,” Draco summoned a bottle of cheap firewhisky, then poured about half a shot’s worth into his coffee. “I have not simply seen the paper. I have skimmed it and drawn the conclusion that whoever wrote it will receive several anonymous letters asking them to consider work they would be more suited to, like spying on people in the shower. After all, they seem quite interested in invading others’ privacy,”</p>
<p>Weasley sputtered, possibly enraged, possibly choking down a laugh. The green hue of the floo made it rather difficult to tell.</p>
<p>“Good day, Weasley.” Draco said, face carefully blank.</p>
<p>Mr. Magnanimous’s mouth opened, and words came out, but they were silenced by the roar of the closing floo.</p>
<p>Draco took a long sip of his coffee. It tasted rushed. Of course, that could just be the smell of piss seeping into his daily life.</p>
<p>It was time to begin cleaning. “<em>Scourgify! </em>” Draco shouted, pointing his wand at an entire wall. It turned grey. It was disconcerting to know it was supposed to be even more discolored. At least the stain disappeared. Merlin, it might be better to just tear the whole place down and rebuild. Maybe that way he could build furniture into the flat rather than rely on a crusty card table, single folding chair, beige sofa, and television stand. There was no television. He could transfigure it into more tasteful furnishings, but everyone knew transfigured items were vastly inferior. Besides, REFS had said his shipment would arrive within the week. Draco could stand a few days in squalor.</p>
<p>Speaking of squalor, he received a muggle appliance catalogue on his doorstep yesterday. He picked it up, then spent the next half hour on the musty sofa circling different ones and imagining their functions. The engenuity of muggles, if nothing else, was admirable.</p>
<p>The back page of the catalogue stared at him. Draco <em> incendio</em>-ed it, then dropped the ashes out his window into the back alley. They landed on some sort of black muggle box. He checked to make sure no muggles were around, then summoned it up. It was a clunky thing, black with dials and lines and a few holes. It also appeared to be smashed in several places. Lovely. Draco could feel a kinship with it.</p>
<p>The device was obviously the muggle version of a radio. It also showed the time. Or at least he assumed it would once it was fixed. Draco tinkered with the contraption for the two hours until lunch, then skipped lunch and tinkered more. It wasn’t like he could really buy anything anyways. There wasn’t a Gringotts in Merlin’s Armpit, Scotland where he could exchange his galleons for pounds and ounces or whatever.</p>
<p>Fixing things was something Draco considered a talent of his, and a remarkably Slytherin one at that. One might argue that fixing was something a Ravenclaw might enjoy, or even a Hufflepuff. Draco argued that fixing required precision, ambition, and calculation. A Ravenclaw would soon lose track of purpose and simply explore the object. A Hufflepuff didn’t even have the mental capacity. To repair, one must have an agenda in mind. One must know exactly what he wants and how to get it. For that reason, Draco was a Slytherin.</p>
<p>The floo rang again.</p>
<p>“Malfoy!” A familiar green-cast ginger opened.</p>
<p>Draco didn’t look up. “Weasley,”</p>
<p>“The person who wrote the article, in case you didn’t know, is Orion N Ager. He lives in Chelsea and his residence isn’t at all warded against owls from strangers. In case you were wondering,”</p>
<p>“In case I was wondering,” Draco repeated.</p>
<p>Weasley nodded. “Or an anonymous acquaintance,”</p>
<p>Draco nearly smiled at him. “I shall tell my anonymous acquaintance at once. Thank you, Weasley.”</p>
<p>He ended the floo on Junior Auror Ronald Weasley’s surprised face. One would think he’d never been thanked for a service before. Granger was obviously slacking.</p>
<p>He rummaged around in his expanded bag for parchment and a pen. The first letter he wrote told his dear friend Mr. Ager to apply for a job transfer. The second was a lovely flowchart of what would happen if someone were to ruin his reputation. It started with a Rita Skeeter exposé and ended with him spying on innocent men in the shower. Draco had always figured it was best to insinuate strangers were bent, since if they weren’t they would be paranoid about emasculation and if they were, they would be paranoid that someone found out. Either way, it struck them in a vulnerable place. Even Draco would be somewhat unnerved if he received an anonymous letter that confirmed his sexuality.</p>
<p>Blaise had always said it was obvious once you knew where to look.</p>
<p>Draco had always said anyone could tell Blaise liked both from a mile away.</p>
<p>The third letter was a detailed drawing of an arsehole. An arrow pointed to it. The arrow was labeled ‘you.’</p>
<p>He duplicated it and stuck the copy on the wall behind him.</p>
<p>Such actions were petulant and below him, but Draco didn’t really care. It was five o’clock in the afternoon and Mr. Ager was in for it.</p>
<p>Draco’s doorbell rang downstairs. He cursed under his breath, then mentally prepared himself for the journey through the empty shop.</p>
<p>Turns out, he only tripped over three objects on the way to the door.</p>
<p>A pimply teenaged boy stood on the step. “Package for a Mr. Drake Mallard?”</p>
<p>Draco sighed. “That would be me.” He grabbed the pen from the boy and drew squiggles on the reciept.</p>
<p>“Here’s your package, sir.” The boy awkwardly handed the large box to him.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Draco said, slamming the door.</p>
<p>Of all the awful names they could have picked for him… he had to be Mr. Male Duck Duck? He sounded like a cartoon character on some muggle show for children. Bloody aurors. Couldn’t even be trusted to preserve a simple man’s dignity.</p>
<p>Draco set the box on the floor of the shop. A cloud of dust arose. Draco conjured curtains for the display windows, then <em> scourgify</em>-ed the floor. It was still a dingy grey, but at least it was no longer dusty.</p>
<p>Inside the box was various coffee paraphernalia: a couple presses, some kettles, a few mugs, a live miniature coffee tree. The real coffee would have to wait until the whole design-scenario had been dealt with.</p>
<p>The muggle radio and his gripes with the ministry and the prophet disapparated as Draco begun the process of cleaning up the empty store.</p>
<p>Cleaning with magic was simple, but adding the proper appliances was another matter. It would be difficult charm-work to weave in spells that would allow his brewing to harness magical energy, but in such a way that the muggles would never think something was amiss.</p>
<p>A sharp knock on the front door had Draco scrabbling for his wand. Luckily, it was in his back pocket. In his <em> jeans. </em></p>
<p>The person knocked again.</p>
<p>Draco opened the door and began to greet them, but the person waltzed right in.</p>
<p>“Hello?” Draco tried. She dressed like a factory worker from the 1940s and fit the physical description, besides being around sixty years old and uncommonly short. Her brown hair was pulled into a loose ponytail at the back of her neck.</p>
<p>“Heya!” She stuck out her hand. “I’m Campbell. Aila Campbell,”</p>
<p>He took it. It was dusty. Her warm eyes crinkled, betraying years of crows feet in the corners.</p>
<p>“How long you plan to be here?”</p>
<p>Draco looked at her blankly, not wanting to give her an answer she didn’t like.</p>
<p>“That’s as good an answer as any,” She had a thick Scottish accent. “Come over to mine for dinner and you can tell me all about what you plan to put in this dump.”</p>
<p>She didn’t wait for his answer.</p>
<p>Campbell dragged him across the street into a little bookstore. Books were jammed into every shelf, nook, and cranny where they would fit, and even piled on the floor. A brilliant purple suede sofa sagged against the far wall. There was single table where Campbell must sell books to customers. A signed poster of David Bowie, along with a few of his records, gazed benevolently over the shop.</p>
<p>She didn’t give him a tour, instead opting to push him upstairs to her flat.</p>
<p>“Knock, knock!” She said, not knocking. She had a firm grip on Draco’s elbow.</p>
<p>“Heya!” A woman’s voice called. “Dragging home strays again?”</p>
<p>Campbell laughed. “Just one today. Moved into old Arnie’s store yesterday,”</p>
<p>“Ah, the elusive Mr. M. I’ll be out in a sec,”</p>
<p>Draco stood just in front of the door, unsure what to do with his hands or how to make his presence known.</p>
<p>At last, the woman made her appearance. She was average height, average build, average face. She was remarkably average if you ignored the paint-stained overalls, bright yellow belt, and bright white flyaway hair. Draco’s overall impression was that of a dandelion puff.</p>
<p>“I’m Elise. Nice to meet you,” She stuck out a hand, then retracted it when she realized it was covered in paint.</p>
<p>“Draco,” He said, continuing to stand in the entryway. Campbell pushed him further into the flat. It seemed to have a similar layout to his. The furniture was all blandly mid-century, but prints of various sizes hung about the walls. He assumed Elise had painted them.</p>
<p>“Draco’s an interesting name,” Elise remarked, washing her hands in the kitchen sink. “You’ll have to excuse me. I didn’t realize we were having company tonight,” See said with a pointed look at Campbell.</p>
<p>Campbell ignored it, equally pointy.</p>
<p>“I don’t have to stay,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“No, no–” Elise sputtered.</p>
<p>“–That’s certainly not necessary–”</p>
<p>“–I didna mean that–”</p>
<p>The women apologized profusely to each other and to him, interrupting each other and making a general kindhearted cacophony.</p>
<p>Turning to him, they said, “You’re staying,”</p>
<p>Draco gave them a halfhearted smile. “I don’t want to be any trouble, really,”</p>
<p>Campbell’s gaze turned firm. “You’re staying.”</p>
<p>And that was that.</p>
<p>Elise led him to one of the short sofas.</p>
<p>“Did you paint these?” Draco asked, gesturing to the prints.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, yes. I think it would be rather rude to have stolen someone else’s artwork and then hung it up in my home,” She had an urban Irish accent. “What are you planning on doing with the shop?”</p>
<p>“Coffee,” He said simply.</p>
<p>She waited for more. Draco simply looked at her.</p>
<p>“Draco’s an interesting name,” She tried again.</p>
<p>“My mother is an astronomy enthusiast,”</p>
<p>“Funny things, telescopes,”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Draco agreed. “Funny things,” His wand was pressing into his backside. If the muggles asked what it was, he would have to pass it off as fancy pen or something. He looked over to the kitchen. Campbell was busying herself making some sort of sauce.</p>
<p>“Funny thing, you’re building a coffee shop in old Arnie’s place,”</p>
<p>Draco remained silent.</p>
<p>“He would be rolling in his grave or whatever they put him in. Don’t know if he ever had a funeral, poor bugger,”</p>
<p>Draco’s pulse jumped. Hundreds of muggles had been killed during the War. Hell, Draco had murdered one or two at the Dark Lo- at Voldemort’s command. “Did he disappear?”</p>
<p>“Nah, just died in his sleep. You’ve gone all funny looking. Did you know him?”</p>
<p>“No,” Draco willed his face to stay neutral. Old Arnie had probably died of old age. It was a thing that happened. His place had only been for sale for about a year. Arnie had just croaked and the funeral people had put the house on the market. It happened. People died. The War was over. The muggles hadn’t even known it was going on.</p>
<p>“Good, then I can tell you how much of a stick he had up his arse. He absolutely loathed Aina and I, but I could never figure out why!”</p>
<p>“Bet you a pretty penny I could tell you, love!” Campbell called. So they were married, or as good as.</p>
<p>“Oh, piss off,” Elise retorted lovingly. “Anyway, whenever I sent him Easter flowers he shredded them,”</p>
<p>“Rude,”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, and his store was atrocious. I went in there once, about five years ago, and it smelled like a whole coven of raccoons had died of eating poisoned garbage,”</p>
<p>“Afraid it still smells like that,”</p>
<p>“Really? That’s even more atrocious. Have you tried vinegar? Dilute it a bit, make sure you don't leave it on too long or the wood will rot,”</p>
<p>“No. I’ve only started cleaning it out today,” Draco answered honestly.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. I’ll stop by tomorrow while Aina’s minding the shop. Busy moving into the flat yesterday?”</p>
<p>“Something like that.” Draco smiled weakly, then was struck with the sudden urge to open up to these women. “There’s a problem with my furniture. They said it should arrive within the week, but I'm rather doubtful that will occur. Yesterday I mostly spent calling whoever I could think in order to get it shipped,”</p>
<p>“That’s triply atrocious. Do you even have a bed?”</p>
<p>“No. I slept on the sofa last night,” For only a few hours. Draco had been having trouble sleeping since, well, since he was about sixteen. He was twenty-one now.</p>
<p>“You must stay here, then. Aina, lock the door so he can’t escape,”</p>
<p>“Elise, that’s inhumane,” Campbell said, not looking up from her dish. It smelled like pasta. “You should simply wait outside his flat until he feels terrible about leaving you out in the cold and comes over to sate you,”</p>
<p>Elise developed a mischievous glint in her eye. “You hear that, Draco? You’re staying until they get you your bed,”</p>
<p>“No, no. I don’t want to trouble you. I have a feeling it will take a very long time for them to ship anything,” Draco wasn’t accustomed to being aggressively cared for. He didn’t like it.</p>
<p>Campbell brought out three plates of pasta with red sauce and set them on the table. “Draco, I’m going to be very frank with you,”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Shut up and eat some noodles,”</p>
<p>Draco shut up, sat down, and picked up a fork. The noodles tasted nothing like the house elves’ at the Manor, and not at all like the ones at Hgwarts. Not over or undercooked, but the red sauce was excessively cheesy. Draco found it endearing, somehow. He could hear Campbell and Elise prattling on on the other side of the table.</p>
<p>“You really need to stop adopting random people off the street, dear,”</p>
<p>“He wasn’t off the street! I came into his store. And goodness knows he needed it. Poor kid probably hasn’t eaten in two days. He’s skinny as a rail!”</p>
<p>“I bet you’re scaring him. He’s made of the same stuff as the other one you brought in a couple years back,”</p>
<p>“Yes, and now you love him. We have a Wednesday lunch, for Chrissakes,”</p>
<p>“I cede, I cede. Draco,”</p>
<p>Draco looked up.</p>
<p>“Opinions on David Bowie?”</p>
<p>He blinked, swallowed his mouthful of pasta. This seemed like a test. “I don’t quite share his penchant for tight pants, but I believe if I had been alive when he was popular I would have had his poster,”</p>
<p>Elise nodded. “I thought so,”</p>
<p>“Great,” Draco said, attempting to stab another noodle but finding there were none left. “Thank you for the dinner, it was delicious,”</p>
<p>“Are you leaving?”</p>
<p>“I’ll have to collect my things in order to spend the night,”</p>
<p>Elise nearly fainted out of relief. “Aina can come with, to make sure you come back,”</p>
<p>“That sounds lovely, thank you,” Draco said, standing up from the table. “Where should I set my dishes?”</p>
<p>Elise grabbed it out of his hand. “Guests don’t have to do the washing up,” She waited while he remained standing for several seconds. “What are you waiting for? Go grab your things!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">xXx</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco woke with a start, unsure of where he was. A woman, nude from the waist up, stared aloofly from the print on the wall. Music blared from somewhere in the flat. The song was familiar, but he couldn’t place it yet. The clock declared it was 7:30 am. If that was true, then he had slept more in one night than he had the several days.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he packed the clothes from the night before back into their small duffel.</p>
<p>He opened the door of Campbell and Elise’s spare bedroom. He had not been surprised when they had retired into the same room at around 9:30 pm.</p>
<p>By 2:00 today, Lucius Malfoy would realize Draco was not going to be attending the traditional Malfoy Saturday lunch.</p>
<p>By 3:00 today, Narcissa Malfoy would send him an owl.</p>
<p>By 4:00 today, Blaise Zabini would be laughing himself silly over the whole affair.</p>
<p>By 4:05 today, Pansy Parkinson would be treating herself to Blaise’s house elf’s finest cuisine.</p>
<p>By 5:00 today–</p>
<p>“Put on your red shoees and daance the bluueeees!” Elise sang from the side room. She was painting and had a record player set at maximum volume. For a woman of at least sixty she had remarkably supple lungs.</p>
<p>Draco wandered into the main room and sat at the squat sofa. He had concealed his wand in a sort of disillusioned wrist holster. He would have to think of a new solution for the summer months, but for April it was easy to slip the holster up his sleeve. Maybe if he could find any wizards or witches in this town, they could share their wand-hiding strategies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Draco’s new self-declared Lesbian mothers were clearly not witches.</p>
<p>He had four and a half hours before he had to avoid Lucius.</p>
<p>“Thank you all for your hospitality,” He began. “But I’ll be heading over to mine now,”</p>
<p>Elise yelled a gracious ‘you’re welcome’ from her studio. Campbell gave him a salute over her cup –Draco was pleased to see– of coffee.</p>
<p>“Remember the vinegar!”</p>
<p>Draco nodded as he walked out the door. He made his way through the bookstore. As he was leaving, a tall dark-skinned man with wire-framed glasses and an utter mop of black hair approached the door. He set down an oddly-shaped brown paper package at the door before giving it a resounding couple of knocks. Draco didn’t get a good look at him, but he seemed exceedingly fit under the green jumper.</p>
<p>Maybe Campbell would introduce them sometime.</p>
<p>A pile of letters greeted him on the floor of the shop. Draco banished them upstairs. He sighed, then conjured a gallon of vinegar and a dust mask.</p>
<p>Right under the door seemed to bet he best place to start. He began rubbing the vinegar on the floorboards. It should be okay, he convinced himself. These were bare, unwaxed floorboards. Mother wasn’t about to burst in and demand to know what in Merlin’s name was going on. The Lesbian couple who lived across the way had told him to do this. They knew what they were doing.</p>
<p>It was half past eleven when Draco realized he was growing uncomfortably hungry. So he took a break. There was nothing much in his flat, but toast would have to do today. Maybe he would get groceries tomorrow. That’s what he said yesterday, but here’s to hoping.</p>
<p>He picked up one of his letters. It was an apology from the aurors about his furniture. Draco <em> incendio </em>ed it. The next was a complaint from Mr. Orion N Ager. He opened it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>Dear sir,</em></p>
<p>
  <em>I am very sorry you did not enjoy my portrait of you, or the article in which you were included. Since you did not include your name, I do not know exactly what it is that prompted your displeasure. If you would like to provide constructive critisicm, please do so. I am willing to accomodate any suggestions provided in a professional manner.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Mr. Orion N Ager</em>
</p>
<p><em>Photographer and Columnist</em>”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco smirked. Mr Ager clearly teetered on the edge of snapping. With a few more creative letters, Draco would get him to send a vaguely threatening letter. Then, he could simply tip off a rival journalist on Mr Ager’s violent tendencies. The resulting article would potentially end Mr Ager’s career, or at least condemn it to <em> Witch Weekly </em> grade.</p>
<p>For the next couple hours Draco amused himself with drafting the perfect response. Mr Ager had simply used a return owl, so there was no worry about being recognized via post. Merlin knows Draco’s had enough trouble for a lifetime.</p>
<p>At precisely 2:00 pm, the floo rang.</p>
<p>It was time. Lucius was calling.</p>
