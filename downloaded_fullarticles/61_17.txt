    <p>After about the ten thousandth “limp noodle” Harry couldn’t understand how he had ever thought he loved Ginny romantically. Must have been teenage hormones or something because nothing she did could make him hard. They had finally gotten some decent alone time the summer after the war. At 12 Grimmauld Place Harry had set the scene wonderfully (Ginny had thought that a gay man had moved in…turns out she wasn’t far off) but even then Harry still had problems getting it up.<br/>
<br/>
Ginny could kiss decently (better than Cho’s wet ones any day) but Harry couldn’t help realizing that he should be aroused at some point during their make out sessions…and he just wasn’t. Her kisses felt nice but he didn’t want to do anything beyond that…ever, the urge just never struck him. Ginny did though and so she did her best to lead the way. When she first blew him, Harry hardened slightly, but was rather unimpressed. Ginny, instead of being put off, just attributed it to nerves and had promised more fun next time.<br/>
<br/>
That was over three months ago, and they still hadn’t had sex because Harry couldn’t get it up. Ginny was furious hurt while Harry was simply confused. Finally after an extremely embarrassing doctor’s appointment; “are you healthy enough for sex?” among other fun questions were answered. To his slight dismay and relief Harry realized that his manhood wasn’t the problem per se, the partner choice was, particularly her lack of manhood… That’s right everyone, Harry thought to himself, the famous, Dark Lord defeating Harry Potter is gay.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with being the “famous” Harry Potter is that his personal life always seems to become news. And news travels incredibly fast in the wizarding world. To make matters worse, Ginny had decided to take the dramatic route upon realizing that Harry was gay. Had she not gone out of her way to take revenge or get out her frustration publicly, Harry might have been able to come out in his own time in a more discreet way, but that option was taken away from him the day Ginny found out about him. Granted there were very few ways that were worse than the way Ginny ended up learning the truth. It was all part of Ginny’s last ditch attempt to turn Harry on and fuck his brains out, she had decided the only way to turn him on was to surprise him.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, it was Ginny who had been surprised when she walked in on him jacking off to a very hot and heavy gay porno film. Ginny flipped the hell out and tried to hex him and everything else in the general vicinity. Harry was frighteningly reminded of Hermione’s attack on Ron in their 6th year. Hoping to avoid being pecked by birds, Harry jumped up and yelled, “Stop! Ginerva Molly Weasley stop right now or I will stupefy you!”<br/>
<br/>
Ginny stopped in the midst of her frantic spell casting and turned her most hate filled glare onto him. The look sent chills down Harry’s spine but having faced Voldemort, he wasn’t one to back down easily.<br/>
<br/>
“Look,” Harry said calmly as he put his hands up in a no fight gesture; “I can explain. I didn’t mean for you to find out like this…Hell I wasn’t even sure of it myself until about an hour ago. I was just trying to figure out what was wrong with me, and we had tried everything else under the sun. So I just thought that maybe I should try watching some...umm…stimulating videos. I started out with women one but nothing happened so I went to the only option left…gay porn.” Harry blushed. “I started to watch one and I was instantly turned on. I was hard as a rock within minutes… I am sorry Ginny but its true. Its not you, its me. I can’t go on pretending anymore Ginny, especially not now that I know for sure that I am gay. I am so s…”<br/>
<br/>
“Save it Harry.” Ginny responded coldly. With a wave of her wand her few belongings that she kept at Harry’s were packed and at her feet.<br/>
<br/>
“I have been nothing but faithful to you Harry James Potter. I have always loved you and stood by you. I wish we had realized this sooner since it would have saved me a lot of pain and a few wasted years. But don’t you dare ask me to keep your damn faggoty secret,” she said venomously as her anger echoed in every syllable. “Its over right here and right now. We are done and I don’t want to hear from you again. If you come around the Burrow, I still don’t want to talk.” And with that Ginny spun on her heel and disapparated with a loud pop!<br/>
<br/>
Harry let out a big sigh of relief at her disappearance but it was cut short by a loud commotion coming from outside his window.<br/>
<br/>
“What the bloody hell is going on now!?!?” Harry yelled, thoroughly annoyed. Harry hurried to his bedroom window and tried to open it. He struggled manually with the window for at least five minutes before resorting to magic. Harry proceeded to try every spell he could think of and some others that he made up on the spot, but the blasted window refused to open.<br/>
<br/>
All the while that carving noise had been harassing his eardrums. Resigned though he was about the window, Harry still wanted to uncover the source behind that horrid noise. Deciding to go outside and take a look Harry ran through his house and out the door…and stopped dead in his tracks.<br/>
<br/>
Ginerva Weasley was standing in the middle of the road, wand raised on his house. Scared of what he was going to see Harry slowly turned to look at Grimmauld Place…<br/>
<br/>
“I’M GAY COME AT ME MEN”.....was carved into the side of his home.</p><p>Harry blushed scarlet and turned to confront the graffiti artist but she had apparated to the end of the street by this time.<br/>
<br/>
“Have fun banging men Potter! This is one Weasley you should have fucked!” She yelled to him.<br/>
<br/>
“Why didn’t you use rooster blood like you did for your previous graffiti you…you…bitch!!!!” Harry yelled back.<br/>
<br/>
Ginny somehow managed to pale and flush at the same time before she flipped Harry off. As she turned to disapparate Harry replied “You wish!”<br/>
<br/>
So the bright side was that the words were carved into his house, rather than carved out his limestone walls. It would be easier for Harry to fill up the holes than to push random bits of limestone back into his walls. However Ginny had apparently bewitched the graffiti so that it would remain carved until, well whenever she saw fit. Assuming that the damage was done, Harry had seen Rita Skeeter in the distance earlier, Harry decided to leave his house as it was and go to bed.</p>
