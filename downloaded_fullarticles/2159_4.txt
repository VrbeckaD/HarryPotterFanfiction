    <p align="center">One </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was an owl pecking my forehead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I stirred underneath my silk blankets, my breath sleep-warm and slow. It sat on my chest, its talons digging through my pyjamas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Fuck off.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Peck. Peck, peck.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Ow.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Peck.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Will you stop.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Peck.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It broke the skin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Argh.’ I jolted upright, pushing the owl off. The dorm was in almost complete darkness. There was a rustling from my left – Vincent’s bed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘S’matter?’ he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Nothing.’ I pressed my hand to the blood welling up on my forehead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Then shut up,’ he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I glared into the dark. ‘You shut up.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Both of you shut up,’ Blaise hissed, his voice hoarse from sleep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I let the owl hop up onto my shoulder, and I staggered out of the dorm. The stone steps were freezing underneath my bare feet, and I pattered quickly out into the deserted common room. Light flickered from the fireplace, and I shuffled towards the warmth, yawning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The owl pecked my ear, and I lost it. The owl wasn’t even mine. It was some damned strange snowy owl, with a gleam to her amber eyes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Get off me.’ I shrugged violently, and she flew off my shoulder. ‘Give me the letter and never return.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She perched on the mantle above the fire, ruffling her feathers. The letter tied to her leg was rolled and tied with red ribbon, and sealed with gold wax.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I frowned and snatched the letter off her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It wasn’t a letter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was an invitation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To join a secret society, only known in whispered rumours around the school as the DA. The DA, I was sure, was headed by Potter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I turned the invitation over in my fingers. The parchment was thick; fancy. The presentation was too classy for anything Potter could come up with.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those whispered rumours said the DA was involved in the deposition of blood-purist Umbridge from her position as Headmistress of the school last year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My family was directly involved in repairing her reputation (and funds) to get her back on top at the Ministry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This made no sense.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unless it was a trap.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I chewed my nails, pacing in front of the fire. I could join, find out what I could, and then mess with them and turn them in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I snorted, a grin creeping over my face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But then, an image of Potter bloomed in my mind, and I froze my pacing, my gaze on my bare feet, and I lost all capacity for sensible thought.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Having anything to do with this secret society and Potter was not in my life plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I scribbled a <em>no, piss off </em>on the back of the invitation, and sent it back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>________________</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Weak streaks of morning sunlight filtered through my lashes. I sat cross legged on my bed, blinking slow over my transfiguration draft. Very firmly, I did not think about the secret society invitation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was not curious.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was a Malfoy. Intelligent. Ambitious. Utterly ruthless. And giving zero fucks about anything to do with Potter, Gryffindors, or some futile crusade to change conditions for muggleborns and halfbloods.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Early morning bird song filled my ears. Blaise swore a string of curses as he dug through his school things, looking for his spare tie. Snape’d kill him if he showed up to breakfast without it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I plugged my ears with my fingers, frowning at my draft. I could still the bird song, and Blaise’s damned ranting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Who the fuck has taken my fucking tie?’ Blaise’s face flushed red. He rooted through his trunk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A pair of his socks hit me in the face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘OK,’ I said, ‘if that happens ever –‘</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A pair of his Calvin Klein underwear missed my head by an inch.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The thing with my house – and I freaking love these guys – but if you show one speck of weakness, you’ll get shredded. Last year Gregory caught me conjuring dancing shadow puppets for a crying first year, and I told him I’d been trying to show the kid the Slytherin war cries and dances, and I just couldn’t stand the sound of the kid’s whimpering. You know, it was my duty, as prefect. I still got called mummy for the next six months.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Blaise was in love with this pair of underwear. With careful deliberation, I picked up my wand, levitated the underwear, and lit them on fire with a wordless spell.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘What!’ Blaise leapt over to the burning underwear. ‘Damn it, Draco.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Vincent and Greg started dancing around the burning underwear. Good men. I guess they’d gotten into the coffee early.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Blaise shoved me. ‘You need to get laid, you fucking uptight, squinty-eyed virgin.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I flicked ash off my robes. Blaise kept up a stream of insults about my sexual preferences – or lack thereof – which I coldly ignored. When he started prodding me in the chest, though, and compared me to Longbottom – worse, he said, ‘<em>even Longbottom’s fucked, and see how relaxed he is now, you utter icy bitch</em>,’ I felt my lip curl.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I turned my back on him, before he could see, carefully packing my satchel. ‘How has this rant found its way to my bed?’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Look at my Calvins. This wouldn’t happen if you would just fuck, like the rest of us.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Irrelevant,’ I said. ‘Anytime you throw underwear at my head, regardless of my fucking or not, I’m going to burn them.’ Satchel packed, I slung it over my shoulder. The thing was groaning under the weight of books. I arched an eyebrow. ‘Besides, some of us have standards.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘You’re unnatural.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Blaise, you’re making me blush.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Shit,’ he said, smoothly ignoring me, ‘I’d fuck you myself if I didn’t think I’d get my cock frozen off.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I levelled him with a cold gaze. ‘That sounds like motive enough for me.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Blaise swept me up and down with a scrolling look; from my carefully controlled face to my expensive dragon-hide boots, tightly laced. These looks had been coming with increasing frequency and were getting harder to ignore. He nibbled his bottom lip, his eyes heavy lidded. Horny bastard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I thrust my spare tie at him. ‘Breakfast. Let’s go.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We made to go down the stairs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Only problem was, a snowy owl stood in the doorway, blocking our exit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This time it was a torn scrap of paper, and it had one word on it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Unacceptable.</em>
