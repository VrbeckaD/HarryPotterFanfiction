    <p>
  <span>Harry slept soundly in the hospital wing. The Weasleys and Hermione had been persuaded to leave and get some rest not long after Harry himself had fallen asleep by Madam Pomfrey.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dumbledore entered the room closely followed by Severus Snape.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The older man pulled his wand out and started to cast over the boy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t think this is a good idea. Cutting him off from his senses from his essential nature on top of everything that has just happened could send him into depression or worse, Albus.” Snape said as he watched the old man. He knew that Dumbledore wasn’t likely to listen to him, after all, he had been campaigning for years to get Harry moved out of the Dursley’s and the old man hadn’t listened, insisting that Harry was safest there.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The boy will not be able to handle his senses on his own Severus. You know that. And he doesn’t even know what he is yet. It is dangerous to leave him out in the muggle world on his own with his newly awakened senses and no guide. Besides we don’t even know who his guide is. As far as I have been able to tell nobody has come online tonight with Harry. If he had his guide and even a preliminary bond was in place, he would be able to keep from zoning in the muggle world, but as it stands I think this is for the best. I will remove the charm once he returns after the summer.” Dumbledore said as he finished and stored his wand.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Both men looked down at the sleeping boy sadly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The poor boy has enough to deal with, what with Voldemort being back in the world and his connection to Harry. You will need to give him occlumency lessons Severus. He needs to be able to block Voldemort from his mind. Once his guide is found and they have a bond the guide should be able to block him easily, but until then Harry will need your help.” Dumbledore said, as he turned and walked to the door with a nod towards Madam Pomfrey.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, he’s going to </span>
  <em>
    <span>love</span>
  </em>
  <span> that. Just what we need to make things interesting next year.” Snape muttered sarcastically, as he followed the headmaster.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t be like that Severus. I know there’s no love lost between you both, but surely you can set aside your differences and teach the boy what he needs to know.” Dumbledore chided gently.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Snape just snorted and they left to go to their respective rooms.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry Potter slept on unknowing of the loss he had just suffered. He would not know what had been taken from him for months yet, but he would certainly feel its absence. For now, he would ascribe it to the shock of Voldemort’s return and Cedric’s death.</span>
</p>
<p><span>                                                                       </span> <span>~*~</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Draco Malfoy wasn’t having a very good night. He was sensing things he shouldn’t be able to. He could feel his housemates shock and barely suppressed excitement at the news that the Dark Lord had risen again. He could feel the shock and fear all over the school along with the disbelief and denial from some people and it wasn’t a very comfortable feeling. He wasn’t an idiot, he knew what this meant, but he wasn’t sure if this was a good thing or not. He had awakened, as a guide, somewhere during the third task and he had a sneaking suspicion that one of the champions who was his sentinel.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His father had told him all about his glorious heritage and the possibility that he would be either a sentinel or a guide, even though he himself wasn’t one. Lucius had been slightly disdainful of the fact that the Malfoy family had a long history of producing strong Guides. Draco guessed his father had been disappointed not to be one himself and he feared his reaction on finding out his son was a guide.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As much emotion as he was picking up now, he had a feeling that he was stronger than most and while that could be a good thing, he really needed to get control of his senses. He wished his sentinel would show up already. His father had told him that the sentinel most compatible to him would come online at the same time as him. There were other sentinels, who might be compatible, but the one who would fit him best would come online at the same time.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco really really hoped that his sentinel hadn’t been Cedric Diggory. The boy had been the best of Hufflepuff house and gorgeous to boot. It was bad enough that Potter got him killed, but if he had been Draco’s sentinel he would never forgive either the Dark Lord or Potter for it. As he was musing on the possibility of Diggory being his sentinel an even worse thought struck him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>What if Potter was his sentinel?</span>
  </em>
  <span> It would be just his luck to be stuck with the Gryffindor golden boy, as his sentinel. No matter he would just refuse to bond with him and find one of his slightly less compatible guides to bond with. There was no way he was going to bond with Harry bloody Potter. Fate just wouldn’t be so cruel as to saddle him with the Pride of the Gryffindors.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He had made it a point to commiserate with both Fleur and Krum on their loss and he knew that neither of them was his sentinel so now he just had to wait until Potter got out of the infirmary to test his theory. With any luck, his sentinel was someone not at Hogwarts. He hoped his sentinel was hot.</span>
</p>
<p><span>                                                                                       </span> <span>~*~</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Draco was trying to get near enough to Potter to see if the boy might be his sentinel, but the Gryffindorks seemed to have surrounded him and he was never alone. Draco could barely get close enough to sense him, and when he did all he could feel from the dark haired boy was a sense of immense loss making him wonder at the relationship Potter might have had with Diggory. The only thing that would explain the immense sense of loss and grief he could feel was if they had been involved, nothing else made sense.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco finally managed to speak to Potter on the train back, taunting him about the return of the Dark Lord and Diggory’s death. It barely garnered a reaction from his rival, he had seen fury flash through those green eyes for a minute before being hit by several spells and hexes at once. The only good thing about the encounter was the fact that he now knew that while there was something deeply wrong with the Gryffindor Golden Boy he wasn’t a sentinel.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco was relieved. His powers seemed to have calmed since they had first awakened and he had quickly managed to reign them in, not that they didn’t occasionally go haywire picking up every emotion in range, but his long practice in controlling his own emotions had helped him a lot in concealing his own awakened status from anyone else.  He would wait until he found his sentinel and see if they could help him get away from his family and all his father’s expectations before revealing anything to his father. He didn’t think he could deal with his father on his own.</span>
</p>
<p><span>                                                                                       </span> <span>~*~</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Harry was having an absolutely miserable summer. He felt an aching sense of loss that he couldn’t quite explain. Cedric’s death shouldn’t hit him this hard. He had liked the boy and he did feel guilty that he had gotten the other boy killed but he hadn’t thought he would be this affected by it. It hadn’t been this bad at Hogwarts. Harry shook off his lethargy and the depressing thoughts that had plagued him all summer and focused on trying to listen to the news from where he was lying hidden by the bushes under the front window.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He hadn’t heard much from his friends and nobody would tell him anything. He was getting really annoyed and frustrated by the lack of news or just simple human companionship. As loving and loyal as Hedwig was she couldn’t replace the feeling of talking to an actual human being who cared about him. This summer was making Harry wonder if there truly was anyone besides Sirius who truly cared for him or understood him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He focused again on the news and listened to the boring and predictable events around the world. No major disasters or deaths…good. When the news turned to water-skiing budgies he decided it was time to go. As he was preparing to creep out of his hiding place he heard a crack that sounded like someone apparating. As he jumped up hitting his head on the open window he felt Uncle Vernon’s hands close around his throat.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry was angry, frustrated and unhappy by the time he had managed to get free of his aunt and uncle as he made his way to the play park. He stayed in the park turning his thoughts over in his head and wondering why nothing seemed to make sense anymore. He needed his friends, but they seemed to have forgotten him being busy with something that they wouldn’t tell him about. Even Sirius was doing something to help, but Harry had been left all alone all summer to do nothing. He didn’t understand why nobody trusted him enough to help.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sighing to himself he followed his fat cousin home. So lost in his thoughts and unhappiness that he barely felt the creeping cold and sadness that the Dementors brought with them. As he noticed the cold breath leave his lips Harry shouted to Dudley to run, following him only to feel the cold approaching from the other side as well. They were surrounded. There were more than one of the creatures. Harry drew out his wand and tried to focus on a good memory. It took three tries before he could begin to feel anything remotely like happy and his stag when he appeared was not as bright as he was the last time Harry had seen him.</span>
</p>
<p><span>                                                                        </span> <span>~*~</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Harry was really beginning to wonder what was wrong with him. Hs emotions were distant from him, he felt like he was moving around under a heavy blanket and he couldn’t understand it. The longer it went on the less he actually cared. The only emotion he really felt was anger, anger at his friends, anger at Sirius and Dumbledore, anger most of all at Voldemort for returning to make his life even more miserable than it had already been.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Even joining Ron, Hermione, Sirius and the rest of the Weasleys at Sirius’s childhood home didn’t do much to change improve his mood. He finally knew what everyone had been doing, well as far as they would tell him, but it still wasn’t much. He was around his friends, but that was dampened by the pending hearing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Even the fact that the hearing went in his favour and he got to keep his wand and return to Hogwarts didn’t negate the feeling of desolation when Dumbledore wouldn’t even look at him. He didn’t understand why the old man wouldn’t even acknowledge his existence now when he had been so kind to him the last time he had seen him. The events of the summer just seemed to build and build and weighed down on Harry making him feel like he was almost ready to explode by the time they were on the train to school.</span>
</p>
<p><span>                                                                        </span> <span>~*~</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Draco’s summer had been peaceful. He still had no idea who his sentinel was, but his father had been very busy with the Dark Lord. There seemed to be something big being planned which nobody would tell him about, not that he really cared. As long as his father left him alone he was content to let things lie.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Narcissa had packed up and left for the south of France as soon as she had learned of the Dark Lord’s return and with his father busy elsewhere Draco was often alone in the manor with only the house-elves for company. He found he was glad for the solitude. It helped him focus his powers and kept the emotion he had to block to a minimum. He really wished his sentinel would show up already. Control would be so much easier if he or she would just show up and claim him already.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As Draco directed the packing of his trunks before the start of school, he wondered what was taking his sentinel so long. He really hoped it wouldn’t be much longer. Hogwarts was going to be a lot more difficult to navigate without even a partial bond with his sentinel.</span>
