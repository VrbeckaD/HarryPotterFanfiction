    <p>Confronting Professor Quirrel had not been the correct thing to do. She knew that now, but they say that hindsight is always 20/20. Without her, he wouldn’t have been able to even get the stone from that damn mirror. It would have stayed inside, hidden, just like Dumbledore had planned. Without her, Voldemort wouldn’t now be in possession of the sorcerer’s stone. </p><p>Dumbledore had come by her bed earlier, offering her consolations. Even to her eleven year old ears, they sounded plastic and fake. Far too sugary to ever be real. Dumbledore did have a fondness for sweets, she had noticed. </p><p>It was too late now, though, and she could do nothing more for it. Voldemort was gone, probably on to the next stage in his planning. And she was here, stuck in a bed in the infirmary because the man had knocked her around before leaving. She could still feel the sting in her scar from where they had made contact. Next time, she would be better. Next time she would fight back. </p><p>-</p><p>The moment she touched the portkey, she immediately knew something was wrong. The curious sensation rushed through her, and she stumbled onto the hard packed earth beneath her. Her aching leg was still bleeding, but she had dealt with worse injuries over the years. Cedric landed beside her, a look of victory painted across his face. </p><p>He jumped, whooping and yelling in victory. “We won! We did it!” He called, but Harry was more focused on their surroundings. She did not know this place, and the grey foggy sky was lending to the unsettled atmosphere. Headstones rose up from the dead ground, their grey tones only contributing a sharp sense of dread to her heart. </p><p>“Where are we?” She wondered out loud, the words thick and heavy on her tongue. She felt like screaming, but her entire body felt heavy. It felt like someone had cast a slow motion charm on her, and she couldn’t break free. </p><p>Cedric was still oblivious, and she needed to warn him. Her visions - </p><p>From the corner of her eye, she saw a dark figure. She tried to cry out, but it was too late. The Death Eater had already thrown a spell at him, disarming him and binding him. Cedric fell over, a look of terror and surprise on his face. The Death Eater threw another spell, and he was out cold. </p><p>“Cedric!” Harry called, taking a step towards him. The Death Eater was already there, though, and he was pointing his wand threateningly at Cedric. </p><p>“Move one more step, little girl, and your friend dies.”</p><p>The words effectively stilled her, and she waited for a tense moment. “What do you want?”</p><p>The man chuckled, shaking his head. “It doesn’t matter what I want. You are here for a reason. Now come - you have made the Dark Lord wait long enough.” The man flicked his wand and muttered a spell, and Cedric’s body rose from the ground and followed behind him as he made his way forward. </p><p>It was kind of a ridiculous sight, but the tension in the air kept her humor suppressed. She followed the man after a moment of hesitance, walking until she could see a great big cauldron in the distance. It was so large that both her and Cedric could probably fit inside. She shuddered, hoping that she would not have to become a potions ingredient. </p><p>A short and dumpy figure came out from behind the cauldron, carrying a small bundle in its arms. When she came closer, her anger and irritation spiked when she saw that the figure was in fact Wormtail. Her fists clenched, her teeth clicking together in anger. She wanted to destroy him for what he’d done. Tear him apart piece by piece. </p><p>She didn’t move forward to do so, however, because she would no doubt be cursed into oblivion by the other Death Eater. So, she reigned it in, narrowing her eyes at the anxious little man. It said a lot about his cowardice that he looked intimidated by her glare. </p><p>“I will kill you some day, Pettigrew,” She finally said, the promise in the air shimmering almost like magic. He flinched, but did not stop what he was doing. </p><p>He leaned down, seemingly listening to the bundle in his arms. Slowly, he nodded, setting it down carefully on the ground. The fabric shifted, and Harry could finally see what was inside. It was a small, shriveled, pathetic creature. Immediately, she knew that this was Voldemort. </p><p>Pettigrew went about drawing sigils around the cauldron, adding potion ingredients and chanting incantations at the already bubbling brew. One of the things he added, which was a bit baffling to her, was a book. She had never heard of a book being put into a potion itself before. </p><p>He stepped up to the cauldron, and in a motion that Harry did not expect, he pulled out a silver dagger and cut his hand off. It landed in the potion without so much as a splash. The liquid was thick and viscous. </p><p>As she hadn’t been expecting it, she cringed, her head turning away from the sight momentarily. Voldemort’s piercing red eyes followed the movement from his bundle of cloth. </p><p>“Now,” said the other Death Eater. She had almost forgotten he was there. “You will go to the cauldron, take the knife, and slice your palm. Allow the blood to fully drip into the potion. Do it now.”</p><p>She turned towards him, a scowl on her face. “And what the hell makes you think that I would actually do that?” She asked, anger overpowering her fear for a moment. </p><p>The Death Eater smirked, pointing his wand casually towards a still-floating Cedric. “Because if you don’t, then your friend will die.”</p><p>Harry swallowed, hesitating before slowly nodding. “Fine,” she said, voice thick. </p><p>She turned back towards the cauldron, staring at it as if it meant the end of the world. It probably did. She forced herself to be brave and took a step forward. Then another, and another, until she stood at the cauldron. </p><p>Pettigrew offered her the knife, and she looked at it with great contemplation. Slowly, as not to startle the man, she took the knife. Then, after drawing back, she quickly plunged it into his throat. He choked and spluttered, his blood spraying everywhere. It splashed across her face, and she grimaced at the warm wet sensation. </p><p>He gurgled before falling to the ground with a heavy thump, his hands clasped at his slit throat. </p><p>Surprisingly, neither Voldemort nor the Death Eater reprimanded her for it. They were probably done with him, then. </p><p>The fact still remained, though, that she had to bleed into this potion. Or else Cedric would die, and it would be on her hands. </p><p>She took another step closer to the potion, looking down at the disgusting bubbling fluid. She raised her hand and the knife, trying to steel herself for it. </p><p>“You will need to recite a few words while you add your offering,” the Death Eater said behind her, closer now than he had been previously. He had probably walked forward so that she could hear him better. </p><p>She nodded, waiting for further instruction. </p><p>“These are the words you must say: ‘Blood of the enemy, willingly given, I will resurrect my foe’.”</p><p>Harry swallowed, hoping that she would remember all of that. “Blood of the enemy, willingly given,” she started, trying to remember the rest of the words, “I will resurrect my foe.” She recited slowly, then, when she was not corrected, slid the silver dagger harshly against her palm. She let out a small noise at the sharp stinging pain of it, her hand clamping down naturally on the wound. </p><p>Her blood spilled into the cauldron, and the potion began to react immediately. The deep blood red of the fluid was quickly turning a blinding white, steam pouring up from the depths of the fluid. </p><p>She backed away quickly, and the Death Eater was walking past her with the bundle of Voldemort in his hands. He placed the small shriveled creature into the cauldron as if it were no more than a warm bath, then he too backed away. </p><p>There was a long moment as they watched white steam pour from the cauldron, almost obscuring the view. Then, the cauldron itself began to melt away and evaporate, as it had never even been there. A tall figure rose from the depths, but it was hard to make out due to the excess steam. </p><p>The figure shifted and moved, obviously taking form as the transformation happened. Then, before the steam even cleared, a man stepped forward. He was very tall and lithe, his hair dark black and shaggy. His cheekbones were high and defined, his eyes a piercing grey color. In this light, they looked metallic blue. </p><p>His eyes settled on Harriett, and she stumbled back, her sliced palm cradled loosely against her chest. The Death Eater stepped forward, offering the cloak that the man had been previously swathed in. Voldemort held his arms out and let the man drape the cloak over him, slowly hiding his previously naked form.  </p><p>He then walked towards her, and she resolutely kept her eyes locked on his. She did not want to show fear or weakness. </p><p>He stopped in front of her, his eyes piercing. </p><p>‘This is it,’ she thought. ‘This is the moment I die.’ </p><p>They both completely ignored the Death Eater, who was now prostrating himself on the Earth for his newly remade master. </p><p>“Finally,” he said, voice smooth and deceptively seductive in his new form. He lifted his hand and Harry flinched, turning her head from the finger that was pointed towards her forehead. “I can touch you,” He said, pressing his finger directly to her scar. </p><p>Harry braced for pain, remembering the searing contact she had had with Quirrel. Instead of pain, however, her back was arching into an entirely different sensation. Pure pleasure jolted into her at the point of contact, and she cried out in surprise, sounding too much like a cry of pleasure for her liking. Before she could register it, she was grasping for Voldemort’s hand, her body instinctually wanting to prolong the contact. </p><p>It was obvious from the way that he stiffened that Voldemort felt it as well. He, however, kept his composure under better control. </p><p>Harry, however, was faring rather badly, and her knees had gone completely weak beneath her. The sensation was much too overwhelming, and her knees buckled. She fell to the ground in front of Lord Voldemort’s feet, and he withdrew his hand from her scar. </p><p>She clutched at the hard-packed earth beneath her, the only sensation able to break through the previous onslaught being the cold damp dirt beneath her palms. Her eyes were screwed shut, and she opened them just in time to see Voldemort turning, his face completely impassive. </p><p>“Come now. There are plans that need seeing to.” He said, his dark voice velvet rough and alluring. Briefly, he glanced back at Harry. He raised his wand and shot out a silent spell over his shoulder, like an after-thought. </p><p>Harry was fully braced for death. And yet the spell didn’t come out green, like the killing curse. Instead it - closed the skin on her palm, healing and mending the sliced flesh. </p><p>She was very confused, looking down at the now fully-healed hand. </p><p>And with that, Voldemort apparated away, his servant following seconds afterward. </p><p>She was left sitting on the ground in bewilderment, her eyes finding a still-unconscious Cedric Diggory not far away. No one would ever believe this story. They never did. </p><p>In a daze, she rose to her feet and stumbled forwards to retrieve the portkey. She placed the cup against the unconscious boy’s skin and activated it, hoping that it would take her back to Hogwarts. </p><p>Everyone in the crowd seemed none the wiser when she finally stumbled out of the maze with a shoddily-supported classmate and a shell-shocked expression. Only a select few of the teachers seemed to be even concerned about the state they were in. Everyone else was celebrating the fact that Harry had won the cup and apparently helped Cedric out. </p><p>To her, the hollow victory was the last thing on her mind. How would she even begin to explain what happened? </p><p>Before she dealt with all of that, however, she needed a bath first.</p>
