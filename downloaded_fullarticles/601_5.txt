<p align="justify">‘I know we have an open relationship but I would tell you immediately if I was fucking someone other than you. You know that.’</p>
<p align="justify">‘Of course I do my love. How do I make it up to you, kitten?’ There was silence on the other end of the phone and then a small groan.</p>
<p align="justify">‘Damn it baby, how do we go from arguing to pillow talk?’ I giggled; knowing how turned on Sabrina was right now as the pet names did stuff to her. ‘Anyway I demand that you come to Greendale and meet my family and friends. Then we can work on our marriage issues, I know someone.’ Sabrina suggested, well more like demanded.</p>
<p align="justify">‘Okay. I love you.’ I said simply, I really cannot argue with my beloved for that long.</p>
