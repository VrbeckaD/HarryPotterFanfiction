    <p>It all became too much for one Harry Potter the night after his eleventh birthday. His Aunt, Uncle and cousin had left him alone with no food once again. He thought he would get even a small present but they just made up some slight and threw him into his cupboard. That was yesterday and now, a day later, Harry was worried they forgot all about him. Harry only knew a day had passed because his birthday fell on a Sunday and he heard Dudley being ushered out of the house the next morning, his Aunt saying they were going to be late. He was sitting miserably on his little cot, wondering why they didn't like him. What did he do so wrong that the locked him up without food or water for days? He wasn't even able to use the bathroom regularly and was constantly wetting himself waiting. It wasn't hard since they never really potty trained him and he was still in  pulls ups. That would be, if they got him pull ups. All they had for him was Dudleys old clothes which were three times to big for him. </p><p>Maybe he would be better if he just left? Someone would help him surely. He'd rather go into an orphanage than stay here where he really wasn't wanted. It was scary to leave the only home he ever had but what option did he have? He couldn't survive another week in the cupboard and he definitely wouldn't survive another one of his Uncle's punishments. Mind made up Harry gathered up a spare change of clothes, putting them on over the ones he already had on and got ready to leave. He hoped he was able to wish for the door to open and have it work again. It happened before and all he did was wish a lot for it. Closing his eyes Harry wished as hard as he could, eyes opening when he heard a creak of the door. Letting out a breath of relief Harry crawled out of the cupboard and stretched. He knew he was smaller than a lot of eight year olds but he still liked to stretch out sometimes and the cupboard made it difficult. Harry crept toward the kitchen to get a bag to throw some fod in it all the while looking around to make sure his Uncle wasn't still here and just being really quiet. Seeing the leftover turkey he smelt the night before Harry wrapped it in tin foil and put it into the bag, along with a lot of the snacks that was there for Dudley. He knew it wasn't healthy but he didn't care, it would keep him from starving. Taking a bottle of water from under the sink where his Aunt kept them, Harry filled it up and put it in the bag as well. The bag, now quite heavy, was thrown over his shoulders, nearly causing Harry to tumble back until he caught himself. Harry walked to the front door and took one last look back at the house that was never really his home. Taking a deep breath he unlocked the door and walked out into the warm August air. He closed the door quietly behind him and took off walking in a random direction, hoping it would lead him into the city. He never noticed the wards around the house coming down or the feint tingle of magic over his body. He also didn't hear the loud pop either as he looked around in wonder. He didn't notice anything until he ran straight into a tall man with long blonde white hair. </p><p>"Hadrian? Is that really you?" The strange man asked. Harry looked at him, confused. Maybe Hadrian was his real name and Harry was a nick name?</p><p>"I'm called Harry or Freak sir." Harry was a bit unnerved by the tall man. He looked really fancy, and his clothes were funny. </p><p>Harry's eyes widened in alarm when he saw the man took out a stick. Was he going to hit him like his Uncle did? Harry cringed and closed his eyes, not wanting to see the blow he was inevitably going to feel. It was because of that, that he didn't notice the spell working its magic and sending him off to sleep. </p><p>***</p><p>Lucius Malfoy was enjoying some lunch with his wife and eleven year old son when the alarm went off. It was an alarm that was specifically made for Hadrian. Their youngest son who was snatched from them eight years ago, just hours after his birth. He was only able to cast the one protection spell on him before he was taken when the mediwitch was checking his weight. She had been overpowered and Hadrian was gone before anyone could so much as blink. Lucius had never thought to hear the alarm from the protection spell he had cast, thinking his youngest son gone forever. Which is why he justified his unsophisticated behaviour of spitting his tea everywhere. </p><p>Draco looked wide eyed at his parents, knowing what the alarm meant. His baby brother had been found! He looked at his Mum in excitement, unable to believe that he had been found. </p><p>"Dad! Dad, you have to go get him! Before the person who took him finds out he's gone!" Draco knocked Lucius out of his stupor and he apparated away to the area Hadrian was. He apparition brought him to an estate in Surrey. Lucius looked around bemused at what he was doing in a muggle area, that was until he came across the little blonde boy walking down the road by himself, carrying a bag that looked too heavy for his frail little body. </p><p>He nearly ran to where his son was, only stopping short because Hadrian had run into his legs. Narcissa's eyes looked up at him in confusion.</p><p>"Hadrian? Is that really you?" Lucius was unable to stop the question. He knew it was likely that Hadrian's name had been changed but he couldn't help but hope. </p><p>"I'm called Harry or Freak sir." His little boy said shyly. It broke Lucius's heart. </p><p>Hearing the crack of other people apparating Lucius quickly took out his wand and cast a sleeping spell on his son. No way would he let them take him away again. Hadrian flinched at Lucius's sudden movement, and closed his eyes once he saw his wand, as if he was going to be struck. Lucius frowned but cast the spell, catching his son and apparating back to Malfoy Manor. </p><p>"Lucius!" Narcissa stopped her pacing and ran to her husband, Draco right behind her.</p><p>"Is it really him?" She whispered, lighting touching his baby soft hair, it was the exact same colour as her husband's she noted. </p><p>"Yes. Call a healer 'Cissa. He needs a full health check. He's extremely thin for an eight year old and I don't like the way he flinched when I took out my wand." </p><p>Narcissa looked like she wanted to continue the conversation but Hadrian's needs came first and she rushed off to floo call their personal healer. Draco followed his father into the bedroom on the left side of his parents. His being on the right.</p><p>"Dad, will he be okay?" Draco asked in worry. His little brother was so small. </p><p>Lucius placed Hadrian carefully in the bed, shushing him when the boy whined as he was laid down.  He looked over at his oldest reassuringly. </p><p>"He'll be fine Dragon, your Mum has the best healer on her way at the moment. She'll take a look and see if he's healthy." </p><p>Draco didn't look convinced and dove into Lucius' arms when he opened them for him. He didn't care if he was supposed to be too old for it, his Dad gave him the best cuddles. Well except Mum. Lucius smoothed down Draco's hair, ignoring the huff of annoyance. </p><p>"I promise he'll be okay Draco. We won't let anything happen to him." Lucius pulled back and sent his oldest a teasing grin. "And you're a big brother now, so you have all the duties of protecting him as well. Think you're up for it?" </p><p>Draco's eyes widened at the implication and he nodded his head, taking his role of big brother very seriously. He'd grown up knowing he was a big brother and hearing stories about him, but now that Hadrian was here he was a proper big brother. He took his Dad's words seriously.</p><p>"I promise Dad! I'll make the best big brother and protect Hadrian as well." Lucius ruffled Draco's hair.</p><p>"I know you will. I think I hear your mother. Let's hope she brought the healer." </p><p>Draco shyly moved away from his father, not wanting the healer to see him being cuddled by his Dad. Lucius rolled his eyes good naturedly at him, becoming more serious when his wife and the healer stepped through the door. </p><p>"Healer Avery, thank you for coming so quickly. You understand why this is urgent?" Lucius asked as the healer went straight to Hadrian, checking him over physically before she moved to magically checking. </p><p>"I'm aware Mr. Malfoy. I'm just going to check him over. Just by the physical he is extremely underweight and malnourished." She tapped her wand so that he would be changed into the common hospital pyjamas, frowning when the size that fitted him was for four to five year olds. </p><p>Looking at the worried family she sent them a reassuring smile. "I'm doing the magical diagnosis now. It may take a few minutes." </p><p>Taking her wand she muttered a spell, starting from the top of Hadrian's head down to his toes. Lucius, Narcissa and Draco stood at the bottom of the bed, looking on in worry as she ran her medispells. Draco leaned subtly against his mother, wanting the comfort as he watched his little brother. Narcissa wrapped her arms around him from behind, letting him huff in annoyance for the healer's sake, all the while he leaned back a bit more, soaking up the comfort. </p><p>The five minutes past in tense silence. Finally the results of her test shot out from her wand in a parchment. Healer Avery hummed at the results, not happy with what she was seeing. </p><p>"Well?" Lucius asked, running out of patience. </p><p>"Hmm, oh sorry!" Healer Avery looked up, startled. She was too used to doing this with more time to mull over the results.  "I have the entire list here. It looks like he suffered a broken bone sometime in the past eight years that wasn't healed correctly. His magic stepped in an helped with it though, so a potion to mend mishealed bones will do the job. He also has a lot of bruising, coming up to as recent as two days ago. As I've said before he is malnourished and severely dehydrated most probably cause is food being withheld from him. He'll have to go on an extremely strict diet to combat it, along with a vary of potions, I'll write out the prescription. I know you're close to a potions master?" She queried.</p><p>Lucius nodded. "Yes, Severus will be looking after his potions and the distribution of them." </p><p>"Good. Now on to the more serious aspect. He has a severe rash on his genitals and buttocks. I'd say it goes hand in hand with his malnourishment. He was not looked after properly and in doing so he was never toilet trained, that or he wasn't allowed to be near a toilet much which caused it. His height is also a bit worrying. He fits into the pyjama's for four to five year olds." </p><p>She paused at this part, letting the family digest it. Draco was now blatantly holding onto his mother, hating to hear how his baby brother suffered. </p><p>"Now for the last and most distressing part. It appears there was a powerful glamour put over him, aging him three years, which unfortunately was not good for his health as he was still mentally his own age. The glamour for some reason was broken a few minutes before you found him. I'm not sure what he looked like before this though, all I know is that Hadrian has never seen himself like this so he's going to get a bit of a shock." </p><p>Lucius balled his fist in anger. He would get to the bottom of who took his son and they would pay. Right now though, he had a little boy to take care of. </p><p>"What do you recommend to help his recovery Healer Avery?"  Narcissa asked, running a gentle hand through Draco's hair to comfort the distraught boy.</p><p>"I have a list of potions and instructions when to take them here. Potions master Snape will be able to explain about each on in detail to you. Also here is the name of the cream I'd advice you getting him as his rash won't go away by itself. Pull ups or diapers will help as well with the rash along with letting some air at it. Mostly what he needs is a quiet and calm environment. He'll need emotional support for the trauma he's suffered. I have a few recommendations for mind healers if you would like to look into them, all of them will be sensitive to the situation." Healer Avery smiled at the family as she wrote out the prescription for them, jotting down a list of mind healers as well.</p><p>"I'm going to start him with fluids here, to get his dehydration under control and I could write out a dietary plan for him, or you could ask potions master Snape as he is as equally qualified to do it. There's a pamphlet here, letting you know what foods he can and cannot have." </p><p>She handed it over as she spelled he necessary fluids into Hadrian's system. Then moving onto his bottom and spelling a diaper on, just in case. </p><p>"Mr and Mrs Malfoy, I must say, due to little Hadrian's mental and physical trauma he might behave like a much younger child. Seeking affection and wanting to be taken care of because he has never received it before. You should encourage it because it will aid in his healing. He needs a strong support around him so that he can look for that affection."<br/>
Lucius nodded, obviously they were going to support Hadrian throughout his issues. Looking to Narcissa, she seemed to share the same sentiment.</p><p>"Now how about we wake him and see what Hadrian thinks about it?" Healer Avery took her wand out once more and cancelled the spell Lucius had on the young boy. </p><p>Lucius watched in amusement as his little boy wiggled around the bed seeming to be content to just lie with his eyes closed. That was until reality washed in an he shot up into sitting position to see where he was. The first thing he noticed was the strange man that called him Hadrian earlier. There was also a pretty lady and a boy who looked really nice. They were all standing at the bottom of his bed looking at him.</p><p>"W-Where 'm I?" He mumbled, spotting another lady beside him.</p><p>The lady and man moved to the other side of his bed with the boy climbing over the rail at the bottom to sit at the foot of it. </p><p>"You're at home Hadrian. I'm your Mummy and this is your Daddy. At the bottom of your bed there is your big brother Draco." </p><p>Harry scrunched his nose up in confusion. Family? But his aunt and uncle told him his family were dead.</p><p>"B-but you're dead. Aunty said so." </p><p>"Who is aunty Hadrian?" Lucius asked, sitting on the side of his bed, looking on sadly when Hadrian shied away. </p><p>"Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. M'names Harry Potter!" Harry smiled at them tremulously, hoping they wouldn't get mad at him.</p><p>Lucius stared in shock. His little boy was Harry Potter? The Harry Potter who was supposed to have defeated the dark lord? The hero of the wizarding world? Lucius was furious. Someone had taken his little boy and used him as a tool for their own agenda. Lucius knew that many thought he defeated the dark lord, yet it simply was not true. Tom was not at the Potters manor that night as he was with Lucius looking frantically for Hadrian. The dark lord was somewhat of a horror story now but all Lucius knew was that Tom was also used as a pawn in someone else's game. </p><p>"Hadrian," Lucius began gently, "Some very bad people took you away from us when you were just a small baby and called you Harry Potter. Your real name is Hadrian Thomas Malfoy and we're your family here." Hadrian looked between Lucius and Narcissa before turning to Draco.</p><p>"Are they a good Mummy and Daddy?" He asked, shyly.</p><p>"They're the best." Draco smiled widely at his little brother turning to him for advice. </p><p>"They don't hurt you? Or lock you in the cupboard with no food or, or make you clean the house all the time even though you're really tired?" Harry's big blue eyes search his face intently as he answers.</p><p>"No Hadrian, Mum and Dad would never do that to us. They love us very much and I love you very much as well." </p><p>They all held their breath as Hadrian tried to make up his mind, finally after finding whatever answer it was in Draco's face, he nodded and looked up to Narcissa and Lucius.<br/>
"Okay. You can be my Mummy and Daddy." he said simply.</p><p>Narcissa let out a wet laugh, trying to hold back the tears as she took Hadrian up and hugged him, noting that he tensed until he realised what she was doing and then relaxed into her hold. Lucius put his arms over the both of them, running a hand down Hadrian's soft hair. </p><p>"Dragon, could you send floo call your Uncle Tom and Severus please? They need to know what happened." </p><p>Draco looked wide eyed at his father. He was never allowed to floo call normally. He wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth and took off to the living room where they kept the family floo. He flooed his Uncle Severus first. </p><p>"Uncle Severus? Are you there?" He called looking around the room from the fire, finding it odd. </p><p>"Draco? Does your father know you're playing with floo young man?" He asked in a chiding tone. Draco cringed even though he got permission. </p><p>"Dad knows. He found Hadrian and wants you to come over straight away." Severus gaped at his nephew. They found Hadrian? But how? They'd searched everywhere!</p><p>"I'll be right over Draco, please stand back so I can come through." Severus asked, knowing his nephew he'd try another floo call while Severus tried to come through.</p><p>"Okay!" Draco's face left the floo and Severus was able to step through, calling out the Malfoy Manor. </p><p>Draco hugged him tightly when he saw his Uncle. "I missed you!" </p><p>"You saw me yesterday brat." Severus said even as he hugged his nephew back, placing a light kiss on his forehead. </p><p>"They're in the room on the left of theirs. I've to floo Uncle Tom now." With a ruffle of his hair Severus left him to it. Better Draco than him. The only person Tom was sure not to get angry at for flooing unexpectedly was Draco, and maybe Hadrian now that he was found.</p><p>"Uncle Tom?" Draco called out to the room, unaware Tom was in the middle of a meeting.</p><p>"Draco? Why are you flooing? Does your father know you're using the floo?" Tom demanded, not happy to be interrupted when his followers were there.</p><p>Draco sighed, "Yes Uncle Tom. He told me to floo you. He found Hadrian and told you to come right away." </p><p>"He found Hadrian? But how? Stand back Draco, I'm coming through." Draco stood hastily back, waiting for his uncle.</p><p>"All of you, leave now!" He waited until the last follower left before stepping through, becoming victim to the same faith as Severus. </p><p>"Missed you Uncle Tom. " Draco said, giving him a squeeze. </p><p>Tom hugged his nephew back, loving how open Draco was with him. He hoped Hadrian would also be as open.</p><p>"I missed you too my warrior. How about we go see your little brother now. I have many questions that need to be answered." Draco took his uncles held out hand and dragged him down to where his parents, Uncle and brother were, along with the healer. </p><p>They walked in to Hadrian telling them all about his life with his Uncle and Aunt and how mean they were, all the while he was sitting in Narcissa's lap and playing with Lucius's hair. Tom could admit, if only to himself, that Hadrian was adorable. He had his mother's blue eyes but a slightly sharper blue, along with a button nose and a pouty lip. His hair was similar his Father's and brothers in that it was a blond white colour but by the looks of it, he got his mother's softness. He was a combination of the both of them and it looked like all their best pieces. He looked at Tom when he entered the room and Tom was lost. This little boy would have everyone wrapped around his little finger in no time. </p><p>"Daddy, whose the man?" He asked, looking at Lucius and curling into Narcissa for protection. </p><p>"That's your Uncle Tom. He's been looking forward to meeting you, just like your Uncle Severus.</p><p>"Oh. He's nice?" Hadrian looked at him from under his lashes. Tom would never say he was a nice person but Hadrian would never see that side of him.</p><p>"Yes Hadrian. He's nice." Lucius bit back a grin at the look on his friends face.</p><p>"Not like Aunty and Uncle?" he asked, to make sure.</p><p>"No. No one here is like your Aunty and Uncle." </p><p>"'Kay. Daddy?" Hadrian called again.</p><p>"Yeah?" </p><p>"Tired." He yawned as if to prove a point.</p><p>"You rest your eyes angel, Mummy and Daddy will be here when you wake up." Lucius said reassuringly. </p><p>"'Kay." Hadrian put his thumb in his mouth and promptly passed out against his mother's chest.</p><p>"Lucius, what's the meaning of this? How did you find him?" Tom asked quietly, not wanting to wake his nephew. Draco had drifted over to his father and mother and was now laying heavily against his father, looking like he'd need a nap as well, with all the excitement. </p><p>"From what I gather, he left the house he was staying in with no intention of going back and it took the shields down. It also reversed the glamour put on him, it was how I found him. I'm still not sure who took him though. It wasn't the Potters because they died the night he was taken. Someone else had a hand in this and I'm not sure who. I'm going to keep on the lookout though. I've already alerted the minister to the abuse he suffered at the hands of the muggles. They will pay." </p><p>Tom's eyes flashed red as Narcissa and Lucius recounted what Hadrian had gone through. Lucius was lucky he had gotten the ministry involved because otherwise Tom would be paying them a visit.</p><p>"We'll find who did this to him Lucius. You have my word. No one hurts my nephew and gets away with it."</p>
