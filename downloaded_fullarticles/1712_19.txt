    <p>The door opened without being knocked upon, causing the man to look up from the papers he was attempting to get into order. From the way the door was simply opened, without any semblance with carefulness or gentleness, Remus Lupin assumed that his visitor would be the hook nosed, black haired potion’s professor. He was right. Snape waved his wand behind him, causing the door to shut behind him as he strided over to the former professor’s desk. The werewolf watched as the man returned his wand to its hiding place within the man’s sleeve, and continued to, in the very same movement, produce a whole potion box from somewhere else within his robes. The box filled with potions was placed upon the desk in front of the professor, he reached out and opened it with his hand, showing the number of potions inside; Lupin managed to count to six before the lid was slammed shut again.</p><p>“Twelve bottles.” Snape stated, as he pushed the box over the desk, and took a step back, crossing his arms over his chest. “Twelve months, I hope you appreciate the time and effort it took to prepare this many of them for <em> you </em>.” The last word was spoken through the black haired man’s nose, with some further emphasis.</p><p>Lupin would have been bothered by that manner of speaking, if he had still been younger; these days, it seemed Snape had simply taking up the habit of talking down to everyone, unless they were, say, Dumbledore. Instead of letting it bother him, a soft smile spread over his lips, as he reached out and pulled the box closer. “Thank you,” he began “I don’t know how to thank you… These will help very much.”</p><p>Snape seemed somewhat taken aback by the genuine appreciation in the werewolf’s voice, so much so that the hateful man’s usually scrunched face seemed to un-scrunch for just a few seconds. Then it went back to normal. Lupin smiled slightly and walked around the desk, leaning back against it with his eyes on the wizard in front of him. “Why haven’t you come to talk to me, at all? Is it that very important to keep up appearances?” The words surprised both men, Snape looked at Lupin as if he had grown a second head, and Lupid looked at Snape as if he was the cause of the second head growth. Perhaps he should have considered his words better before blurting such a statement out…</p><p>The dark haired wizard realized that the rules of conversation relied on his response for the conversation to continue, thus he spoke, slowly: “I don’t recall us being friends.” He really did try to keep his voice as dry as old parchment. The werewolf could smell that he was making an effort, his scent did not line up with what he was saying.</p><p>“Friends? We were bloody lovers for a time.” The shock on the potion professor’s face was worth the words, even if it was very unfair to bring up their old connections. Then Snape turned to look at the door, and then back at the werewolf, looking as if he was about to bring forth his wand. Lupin closed his arms around his chest, avoiding the other man’s hawk like eyes, it was clear to any observer that the man was ashamed over his words. “My apologies… That, was unfit.” He probably had gone a bit too far.</p><p>“Were you hoping I would come running to your bed as soon as you arrived at Hogwarts?” The potion professor demanded, clearly insulted, the werewolf could smell hurt below his anger.</p><p>“No, I… I wasn’t expecting anything like that.” Lupin sighed, raising his hands in defense while shaking his head. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know you’d feel that disgusted by the very idea.”</p><p>“I didn’t say I was disgusted, I-” Snape stopped then he realized that he had admitted more than he wanted to, thus continued to quiet down and bite his own lip. Lupin smiled at the sight, it wasn’t often that the former slytherin student bit his lower lip like that. The werewolf reached out and lightly touched the other’s cheek to get his attention. Snape raised his shoulders in slight defense, but he did allow the man to touch him, and he stopped biting his lip.</p><p>“It’s Alright. I’m… sorry, I suppose, seeing as you are unmarried and all, I thought… Maybe you just would…”</p><p>“What, want it?” The professor snarled at him.</p><p>“I was going to say <em> needed </em>, but maybe that is equally bad.”</p><p>Snape surprised him with his answer. “I would hardly…  say that I… detest the idea, but things are very different now, compared to then…” The man before him was avoiding Lupin’s eyes. That was strange, Snape never avoided his eyes. Snape didn’t avoid anyone’s eyes. The werewolf thought of pushing him, but decided against it.</p><p>Silence hung over them for at least a minute, before Lupin stood up. “Tea?” He asked, heading towards the back of the room.</p><p>The potions professor hesitated. “How long until you leave?”</p><p>Lupin didn’t look back at him: “I planned on leaving in four days.” He began to prepare the tea for himself, doing so by hand to avoid looking at the wizard behind him.</p><p>“...Perhaps, I… might come by later, then.” The man left without any other word, leaving the werewolf alone with his boiling water, and the memory of days long past.</p><p> </p><p>---</p><p> </p><p>“No, Sirius, that was not funny!” James repeated for, at least, the fourth time, looking like he was about to go at his friend with a particularly nasty and painful spell, to which the other Gryffindor student simply shook his head, throwing his hands up over his head.</p><p>“Yes, James, it was bloody hilarious. I am jealous only you got to see Stinky’s face, as he was face to face with real danger.”</p><p>“You could have gotten him killed!” James was close to the other boy’s face now, snarling through his teeth.</p><p>“Good riddance! He is a snively, disgusting brat, who will definitely grow up to do something real shitty when he grows older, no one will cry over him.” Sirius got up from the chair he had been sitting on, staring back into James’ face.</p><p>“And what about Moony?” James was yelling still, his fists balled by his sides.</p><p>Sirius sidestepped him, walking over towards Remus and placed his hands on his shoulders, leaning over him from behind. Remus was pulled until Sirius’ cheek was pressed against his, as the animagus snuggled him. “He isn’t upset, are you? We’re actually friends who forgive each other for mistakes, right, Moony?” Sirius looked at him with his big, black eyes, behind his slightly curly fringe. He was attractive, Remus always felt embarrassed when Sirius was close to him. He was quite aware why the handsome teenager made him feel the way he did, but Remus didn’t want to imagine what Sirius might say if he knew that a werewolf found him attractive, or worse yet, how he would use it.</p><p>The scarred boy looked up at James, giving him a sympathetic look. “It’s alright, James. I mean, it isn’t… alright, alright, but… there is nothing we can do about it now; we’ll just have to wait and see what Dumbledore says about the matter.” Sirius responded by cuddling him, making very sure to avoid showing his neck to the werewolf. <span>Of course, it was the only sensible action, seeing canines and predators went for the neck, as a weak spot, and thus, didn’t openly display their necks to potential threats. </span></p><p>James snorted but backed down, walking over to one of the many dusty sofas in the Shrieking Shacks, where the four friends usually re-treated when they wanted to be unheard by the rest of the Gryffindor students. Peter, who had been staying back during the entire conversation, slowly shifted on top of the bed he was sitting on, looking his normal nervous self. He did seem less tense now that the two leaders had finished their fighting.</p><p>“So… are we going out tonight?” He squeaked, eager to change the topic. Sirius ruffled Lupin’s hair and turned towards the rat animagus.</p><p>“If we are!”</p><p>Lupin could almost see the dog wagging his tail when he looked upon Sirius. He smiled softly, looking down at his own feet. Below them, on the floor, he could see the many scratch marks which he himself had left there, in his transformed stage. Slowly, he breathed in through his nose, and out through his mouth.</p><p>All they could do was await Dumbledore’s verdict… Distracting himself from the thoughts seemed like a good plan. </p>
