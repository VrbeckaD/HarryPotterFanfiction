    <p>I sit on the benches and watch with the players as my mother enchants people in the crowd, right before the Quidditch game. Over the years it has always amazed me how Veela can put boys in a certain state, that being a trance. Even the look or just the move of their hips is a hypnotizing circumstance, and I like to think it's probably how she got my father to fall in love with her.</p><p>My father had come from Scotland to England a long time ago, a short time after a full moon. His "pack" was traveling down for reasons left unknown to me, but it was important so I've heard. In attempts of getting to know home, my father and his brother split from the pack and ventured on to see what kind of life they would start. My father began working in the ministry and my uncle grew fond of Quidditch, so took his professions there. On one of my uncle's game night's, one my father had attended, my mother took on her first show, and that's where they met.</p><p>Some time after, when they had fallen in love and had me, my mum was found in a bad place with some bad people and sent my dad and I to Scotland where he had raised me until I was the age of nine. A dark force had found us out and killed him before my very eyes. It came to me with welcoming arms, but when I denied it power, it sought to kill me, but failed. My strong fight against it had left a scar on my arm, one like my father's, that leaves a trace of remembrance every day of my life.</p><p>I will always remember my dad's scream as he jumped in front of me, saving my life. The colors that flashed before my eyes, blinding me until who had killed him had gone. His body was cold and limp, scaring the young girl that I was. His expression was pained, and he held so much sorrow in his eyes, so much that it had broken my young heart. His eyes were gold, he was horribly pale, and his hair no longer held its usual liveliness. He was dead, but it was so hard for me to admit...</p><p>I shake off the horrid memory and look down at my arm, where I see my scar laying across my forearm. It stares back at me, as if to have shared the same memory. My dad was a hero to many, not just myself, but his sacrifice was apparently not important to most. He is hardly ever remembered, for his great ministry work or for his savings.</p><p>Snapping myself out of my daze, I look up and see my mother walking off the field and over to me. Her elegant dress swayed behind her and she pulled her hair out from it's tangle bun, her beauty radiating for miles around us, still drawing the attention of the crowd.</p><p>She had silvery blonde hair that curled in thick layers, down, down, until it stopped and swept over her back. Her skin was fair and smooth, like a glass doll's, and the only intrusion was the faint rose hue in her high-boned cheeks. Her eyes were as blue as the ocean, and as soulful as an old woman who experienced the whole world; so wise. Her lips pouted just right and shone, ruby, glistening in the light. Her nose was rounded and pinched, cute, which she often complained about and was often complimented on. She held a breathtaking beauty that none could compare to, and I sometimes wonder, how could I possibly be her daughter?</p><p>"I'm done now, sweetheart. Do you want to go home? It's getting late and you can catch the game anytime. We do also have a big day tomorrow, with Diagon Alley and all," she tells me, giving weary looks up at the people who stare down admiringly.</p><p>"I would like to go home, yes," I reply, feeling as though I need a break from thinking of my father. She sends me a reassuring smile and we leave the arena, hand in hand.</p><hr/><p>As the time draws nearer, I jump around excitedly, waiting for my mother to finish readying herself to go, in which she often takes her time.</p><p>"Mum, let's go!" I shout in anticipation, my voice echoing throughout the halls around me, a voice so familiar, I can even pick my father's accent from it.</p><p>"I'm coming, I'm coming," she tells me, making her way down the big staircase. She opens her arms wide and does a small twirl, giving me a full display of her skintight black dress, as I would expect since she is one who dresses to impress. "Do I look okay?" She asks and pushes hair from her face.</p><p>"You look fine mum, maybe not fitting for the occasion, but fine. Now let's go!" I say and grab hold of her hand. With all of my focus, I push all of my energy and magic to my thoughts and we disappear from the manor. Everything around us spins, and a falling sensation strikes me, making my mother and I feel uneasy. Finally, after moments of dizziness, we appear in the busy streets of Diagon Alley. Apparation, an easier travel.</p><p>"Okay, mum I have this all planned out. If you would please go get my books and supplies, I'll deal with the robes, the animal, and the wand," I instructed her.</p><p>"Well, okay then, Ellie. Be safe, have fun, and once you finish collecting what you need, meet me out front of Ollivander's," she tells me and walks off to get my supplies.</p><p>For my first stop, I rush to Madam Malkin's Robes for all Occasions, eager to get it over with.</p><p>"Excuse me, madam, may I get fitted right now? I am on a tight schedule today and would love to get this going," I ask her kindly, batting my eyes for extra dramatic effect.</p><p>The woman looks down at me with a weary eye for a good minute, terror trapped behind the eyes, but in the end, nods. "Yes, come now child," she says with a thick accent and waves me over. She waddles to the back and I follow behind, not wanting to waste any time. Once we're at the back, she gestured me to jump up onto the pedestal to be fitted.</p><p>The woman spreads my arms out and starts measuring me with great haste. I feel like eyes were boring into me, so I look to my side and see a boy, a little older than me, with platinum blonde hair looking at me. He was probably having his robes refitted.</p><p>With an uneasy smile, I decide to address him. "Hello, there," I greet with an exhausted smile. He never responded to my greeting and just kept staring at me. After a couple of minutes of waiting, I address him once more.</p><p>"What?" I ask him.</p><p>From my stern gaze, he snaps out of his trance and looks me in the eye. "You're really pretty," he says.</p><p>"Thank you," I respond, shifting uncomfortably. I never get many compliments, but I know he only says so because every veela and half veela are attractive to people.</p><p>"I'm Lucius, Lucius Malfoy," The boy states hastily, outstretching me a hand to shake.</p><p>"I'm Elspeth, Elspeth Rummage," I reply, reluctantly shaking his.</p><p>"Rummage? Where have I heard that name before? Who are your parents? What blood status are you?" He asks with strong interest, batting his eyes nonchalantly.</p><p>"I'm half Veela. My father was a wizard, and an important one at that."</p><p>"Humph. I'm a pure-blood." He sneers as if he were superior in every way possible.</p><p>For the rest of our time in the shop, on the pedestal, there was only silence wedged between us. Finally, after an hour of standing side by side, it was over. I thank the woman in a hurry, and rush out of the shop, robes in my arms.</p><p>Next on my list would be Mr. Ollivander's wand shop, and it was quite an important stop. I hurried over to his quaint little shop and push the door open that triggers a little ring. I stalk to the counter and place my hands over the wood boards, peering over with curiosity.</p><p>"Hello? Mr. Ollivander?" I call out.</p><p>Behind the counter, and older man with fuzzy white hair and piercing blue eyes pops up and stares me down with a soft smile tugging at the end of his lips. He towered over me by a couple feet and his bright teeth gleamed down at me with such generosity.</p><p>"Ahh, Miss Rummage, I was wondering when you would make it in," he said with such wondrous fascination.</p><p>"You-you know me?" I asked with all the curiosity I had. I had only just met him, so how could he possibly know me.</p><p>"Oh, my dear, but of course. You look much like your father. The hair, the eyes, I've seen it all before." His smile fell at the mentioning of my father. It was obviously a topic so close to heart. "So, according to how I study, I may know a few wands that could be held suitable."</p><p>He walked to the back and scanned the shelves so quick, it was almost unnoticeable. His gaze shifted over one box far longer than the rest, and as he passed, he muttered under his breath, "Nothing but a last resort."</p><p>He finally slides over to a dusty, gray, shelf, and pulls out a redwood box that looks recently polished, as nice as if it were done by magic. He shuffles back to the counter, opens the box gently, and pulls out a cedar, smooth, wand with engravings of vines decorating the rim. He hands it over to me and stares with curiosity, awaiting the results.</p><p>With high adrenaline, I give it a flick, up into the air. Boxes spill from the shelves, and fly through the air until they hit the wall. Crashes and the sound of broken objects echo throughout the shop. Ollivander closes his eyes real tight and shakes his head lightly.</p><p>"No, no, not that one," he says and slips the wand from between my fingers, putting it back in the box. He picks up his own wand and without turning around, flicks his wrist, resulting in the boxes with wands flying back onto the shelves.</p><p>He shuffles back to the shelves and tucks it away, sliding through the shelves once again. Once he lands on the box he wants, he taps his finger on it and pulls it off the shelf. The box is smooth, a pearly black color that shines brightly in the candlelight. With a sly swipe, he places it on the counter before me. With a gentle tug, he opens it to reveal a carefully cut, dark wand with bumpy, intricate features.</p><p>I lift the wand from the box, and once again flick my wrist. The light above our heads shatters into thousands of shards and rains down upon us, a glistening shower that slashes at our skin. Quickly placing the wand back in the box, I take a few steps back.</p><p>"Sorry," I say.</p><p>"All is well, my dear," he tells me in a comforting voice as he once again flicks his wrist with his own wand and the light is repaired; all is well.</p><p>Once again, he takes the box and puts it back in its original placement.</p><p>He scans the shelves several times, each coming back with a wand that only causes more destruction. It was troubling how many kids came and left while I was stuck for nearly an hour. After having gone through dozens of boxes, he went to the back, once again taking a look at the box that he had muttered to at the start.</p><p>Giving me a quick glance, he mumbled to himself, "How could it be?"</p><p>He slides his palm across the box until it becomes silvery-white, reflecting a perfect image of himself that he looks into for what seems like forever. He studied it with eyes so full of what seems to be worry and fear, but he pulls it out anyway, and looks up at me. His lips move, but no words spill out of them.</p><p>He slides the white box in front of me and opens it slowly, taking a step back, as if he is waiting for a danger to arrive. I look over the wand with wonder, a devious smile playing at my lips. Pearly cream wood laced with a winter white inscription, almost taking shape of a vine with petals of gold erupting from the cracks. It hand incisions of cut wood, but still kept a beautiful shape.</p><p>"10 1/4", vine, phoenix feather core," he muttered lightly, staring down at it as if it were the ressurection of the Black Plague. "Carved from hands too pure to reckon and kissed with the flame of a phoenix. Beautiful and <em>powerful.</em>"</p><p>I gently pull the wand from the box, eyes glued, mesmerized, and I feel a great power surge through me. My veins glow a soft hue of gold and my eyes light bright like a vibrant flame. My hair defied gravity and falls above my head, flapping as if in an invisible wind. It was extraordinary, but nothing I would ever know, as I expect.</p><p>With a powerful flick of my wrist, the room tidied up into a neat fashion, and light burst from the tip, brightening up the world around us.</p><p>Stars fell to the board beneath my feet, illuminating the ground in a white light. The world around us spun and spun, then stilled itself. When all seemed calm, the wand vibrated like never before, and a blue blast of light blew from the tip, and a creature emitted from the brightness, only to be gone as soon as it appeared. Faint mist encircled us, closing in and falling apart, twinkling in the darkness. There was no candle in sight, not even a flicker of a flame. Wax poured from every gold encrusted candelabra, specks hitting the floor and refliecting the room in sun-licked light, only giving me a leverage of more power. Within a suck of breath, it all flowed together, creating a coil of light, slithering across the floorboards and wrapping itself around my body in a deep embrace. The power lapped at my cheeks and lept to the air, disappearing from sight in an instant.</p><p>As soon as my wand hit the countertops, the majestic world ceased to exist around me, and I looked around for Mr. Ollivander who was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>I spun in a full circle before peering over the counter, looking down upon the body of Mr. Ollivander whose eyes were glued to the ceiling, as if he had seen a ghost. For a moment, I was worried I had killed him before he blinked and opened his mouth, then closed it, sucking in a rasping breath.</p><p>His eyes drifted my way and he sat up as if he had been doused with electricity. He stood with a jump and leaned over the counter, looking me in the eye, and muttered in deep whispers that were quite unreadable.</p><p>"There are great wonders within you child, great wonders indeed. Wand or no wand, your father's spirit wanders deep within you, and I fear it may be your undoing. In the wrong hands, you are a dangerous weapon," his voice is below a whisper, and his hands shake violently as if he were having a seizure. "Promise me you will only submit to good! Promise me! Promise me!" Every word got louder the longer he held it.</p><p>"I promise! I promise," I whisper assuringly, more fearful of his worry than what I had just done.</p><p>He looks at me for another good minute before pulling away, as if he didn't trust me with the promise. He had to find assurance in my eyes, in my father's eyes.</p><p>Worried of what might happen if I stay any longer, I leave the shop with my back facing the door, running once I was in the outside world. It had been an intense meeting, and I was feeling rather skittish. Wizards swarmed around me, and each one spooked me more than the next. In order to get away from the paranoia in my mind, I continued on with my schedule, heading to the pet shop.</p><p>With a shaky breath and a wobbly step, I walk into the pet shop which echoed the many sounds of cheerful children and fascinating pets. The skittish emotion that had controlled me slipped away as my eyes wandered the shop. It was full of a variety of kittens, rats, and owls. All were unique in their very own way.</p><p>I looked through almost every section, stopping every now and again when I saw animals who would most likely appeal to me, but I felt none of them could emotionally match me. I had almost given up hope until I crossed paths with one little kitten who had instantly caught my eye. It was both ginger-red and silky black with golden eyes that shone like the sun. As children passed by, they showed no interest or care for the creature, some even showed disgust. In attempts to save it from unneeded solitude, I picked up the little thing and held it to the light.</p><p>"You. I choose you," I twirled him around and all my troubles flew away. "I'm going to call you...Checkers," I say and walk up to the counter. Grabbing a small bag of galleons and dropping them on the counter, I take Checkers along as my new friend. He purrs in gratitude and rests in my arms, assuring me that everything will be alright.</p>
