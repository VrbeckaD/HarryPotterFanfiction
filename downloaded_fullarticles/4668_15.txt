    <p>Harry looked dispassionately at Malfoy as the blonde boy sneered in his direction. They were glowering at each other from across the great hall. Little did Malfoy know, that Harry was his Lord’s Consort.</p><p>Wait, perhaps we should go back to the beginning. Back when Harry got the surprise of a life time. Not that he didn’t want it anyway. Nope, not at all…</p><p align="center">~*~</p><p>Harry grunted as he was slammed up against the wall. Strong arms holding him up with ease. Lips attached themselves to his neck, suckling at his pulse. It was all Harry could do but cling to his mate and hold on for the guaranteed pleasure that was about to come.</p><p>They were both naked. Sweaty bodies pressed against each other. They undressed the moment they were alone.</p><p>"For fuck's sake Tom! Please!" Harry begged.</p><p>Tom smirked at Harry as he readied to impale himsel- <strong> Woah! Sorry 'bout that. I meant to go back a wee bit further. And I'll umm...yeah, I'll try not to interrupt the story too much. Anyway, carrying on...</strong></p><p align="center">~*~</p><p>Harry woke up to an agonizing pain in his forehead. He shot up and went to grab his head only to collide with the body looming over him. Harry gasped and snapped his eyes open only to see Crucio red eyes watching him. Harry jumped back in surprise, which gave him the view of the face the eyes were attached to. Soft looking skin, the color of moonlight, topped with a halo of wavy black hair. A strong, straight nose that bubbled slightly at the end giving it a subtle edge. Thin lips with a perfect Cupid’s bow adding to the sharpness of the high cheekbones that reflected the pale moonlight just perfectly enough to accentuate the red eyes even more. Not that they needed it of course. They virtually glowed on their own.</p><p>Harry’s heart stopped. Not because the face was the most aesthetically pleasing face he’s ever seen, but because it was the face of the mass murdering man who had been trying to kill him his entire life.</p><p>“Potter?” Voldemort inhaled a sharp breath, almost as if he was stunned to be almost completely on top of Harry.</p><p>Harry felt a sensation finger itself up his spine at the sound of the slightly baritone voice. There was no way Voldemort was this attractive. Harry licked his lips as he tried to regain his rightful mind. Red eyes followed the movement of his tongue as if ensnared it. The pupils blown wide and mouth slightly parted.</p><p>It seemed Harry wasn’t the only one having a problem. Harry sucked in a breath, wondering why he wasn’t freaking out. Voldemort was still looming over him, leaning on his elbow on one side with his other arm caging Harry to the bed, inches from his own face.</p><p>“Wh-” Harry tried. He licked his lips again, Voldemort’s eyes still following the motion. “What are you doing here?” Harry whispered, just barely more than a breath.</p><p>Voldemort’s eyes snapped back to Harry’s and he could see the confusion bloom behind the silky red. “I should be asking you the same. <em>You</em> are the one who just appeared in my chambers.”</p><p>No, it couldn’t be. Harry felt a perfectly reasonable bubble of panic begin in his chest. Harry felt his eyes widen as he whipped his head to the side to take in his surroundings. It definitely was not the room he shared with Ron. It wasn’t grand like he had envisioned the Dark Lord’s rooms to be. Not that he had done that on a regular basis<em>. Nope, definitely not</em>. It was simple, almost Spartan-like, but it was too dark for Harry to fully inspect.</p><p>Harry looked back at Voldemort, who was still gazing at him with a curious stare. It was becoming rather unnerving. But that’s when Harry saw it.</p><p>Voldemort was naked. Well, he didn’t have his shirt on at least. The soft looking pale skin continued down, over strong shoulders and under a lightly haired chest and abdomen, to where the sheets stopped at his waist. Harry wasn’t brave enough to move to see if he had pants on or not. Harry glanced back to Voldemort’s face only to see an eyebrow arched in question, a slight smirk on his lips. Harry’s eyes narrowed even though his breath and heartbeat hitched.</p><p>Harry’s panic had been bubbling in his chest, almost violently. Then it hit him, he wasn’t dead. “You haven’t killed me yet?” Harry almost shocked himself with how demanding he sounded, even to his own ears.</p><p>“No, I haven’t.” the other man said simply, still staring at him.</p><p>“Why?” Harry licked his lips again. It <em>really</em> was a bad habit.</p><p>“I don’t know.” Was the response. “It seems you have shocked me rather thoroughly.”</p><p>Harry snorted before he could control it. Red eyes widened even more, surprised at the noise. “Potter, you do realize that you’re in <em>my</em> house, which is filled with Death Eaters might I add, in <em>my</em> chambers…” Voldemort seemed to gain control of his eyes because they narrowed almost to slits, “You are laying in <em>my</em> <em>bed</em>, <em>underneath</em> me…” He leaned impossibly closer to Harry to where his cheek was beside his own and lips brushed against his ear, “And yet you still have the audacity to laugh in my face.”</p><p>Harry’s breath and heart stopped, petrifying fear froze his blood. This was it. Voldemort had beaten Harry in the race to gain control of their minds. Harry was going to die, here in Voldemort’s chambers, in his pajamas.</p><p>“But,” Voldemort paused. <em>But? But what?</em> Harry’s mind panicked as Voldemort wrapped his long fingers softly around Harry’s neck. “I’m rather liking you in this position.”</p><p><em>WHAT??!!</em> Harry reeled and it seemed if body was an elastic band and snapped back into itself.</p><p>He shot up from his bed in Grimmauld place, Ron snoring in the other bed. Harry’s heartbeat was raging in his ears and in his throat. He could still feel Voldemort’s cheek against his own, could still feel his lips tickling his ear. Hear the haunting voice echo in his mind. Harry wrapped his own hand around his neck, his skin still warm from Voldemort’s touch.</p><p><em>This can’t be happening. This isn’t real! It had to’ve been a dream! There is no way this could be real! </em>Harry started hyperventilating, spots appeared in his vision. He looked around the dark room for something to calm him down but found nothing. His panic was becoming overwhelming.</p><p>There was a tapping at the window next to Harry’s bed, breaking Harry from his panic. Harry looked and saw Hedwig, letter in her beak. Harry cast a Tempus spell revealing it was nearing 3 o’clock. Harry let Hedwig in and took the letter from her, dropping it when he saw his name in familiar fancy scrawl.</p><p>Hedwig let out an offended hoot at Harry and took off out the open window. Harry’s hand was shaking as he picked up the letter. There was no return address but Harry knew exactly who it was from.</p><p>He flipped the letter over and examined the wax seal, there was no telltale marks or letters identifying who it was from, easily keeping its sender a secret. Harry broke the seal and pulled out a blank piece of parchment. Slowly, ink started appearing, forming words that chilled Harry to the bone.</p><p>
  <em>Potter,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You feel as if you can slip through my fingers that easily? Tonight gave me a rather sweet taste of what it would be like to have you in my bed. You’re probably wondering why the sudden change? Well, let me try to explain this plainly.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I have recently come unto some knowledge that helped me regain my horcruxes back into my body, restoring my soul, and my mind. After the ritual was completed, I came into what normal wizards experience at the age of seventeen, a magical inheritance. I did not have mine earlier due to my first horcrux being made at the age of sixteen, splitting my soul in half and unable to withstand such an intense situation. But what came as a surprise, was that I didn’t just have a regular magical inheritance, I had a creature one as well. You see Potter, I came into a dormant incubus gene. I do hope you are up to date in your classes to know what an Incubus is. Seeing as your seventeenth birthday is today, I feel you will come into an inheritance as well. The Potter line is riddled with creatures; I can only guess what you will turn out to be. I can only hope that it is something compatible with my Incubus. Even better would be you becoming a submissive Incubus, eliminating many problems that would arise otherwise.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>With my inheritance, I realize the reason I had wanted to kill you was the same reason as to why I now want you alive. You are destined to be something great, Potter. And now that I am of clear mind, I am no longer threatened by that. Now I wish to be a part of that greatness. I only hope that you will end up by my side as my Consort. Imagine the both of us, together, trying to make Wizarding Britain great again. No one would be able to stop us.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I realize I am being too forward with my opinions, but I refuse to lie to you Potter. And I will wait however long it takes for you to accept my offered hand. It will be only a matter of time.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>With this letter, I have attached an official courting contract for your godfather to go over after your inheritance. He is, after all, a secret follower of mine.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Until next time.</em>
</p><p>Harry didn’t know how to react as the words faded into the parchment again, leaving him staring at the blank parchment. His hands shaking from the aftermath of the adrenaline, his ears ringing with the absence of his heartbeat.</p><p> </p><p><em>This can’t be real!</em> Harry couldn’t help but think again. Harry peered in the envelope and, sure as shit, there were more papers. Harry pulled them out to look at them but there was nothing but the sentence,</p><p>
  <em>Not until after your inheritance Potter.</em>
</p><p>Harry gasped as right then his scar burst into agonizing pain that traveled through his head. Papers forgotten, he crashed back onto the bed, thrashing around, unable to alleviate the pain. He could faintly hear Ron calling his name over his screaming but that didn’t matter now, not with this pain.</p><p>What felt like ages later; the pain in Harry’s head slowly lessened. He started gasping for air, his throat raw and voice completely gone from screaming for who knows how long. Harry hoped it was over but just as the pain was becoming bearable, it started in his lower abdomen. It was as if someone had taken a white-hot poker from a fire and was stabbing his insides with it. The pain crawled up his spine at the same time and down his legs. Harry didn’t know how much longer he could hold on. He just wanted the pain to stop.</p><p>He could feel his body changing, shifting, into something new. He just hoped it would be worth it in the end. He could hear voices, they sounded close but he couldn’t hear what they were saying. Suddenly it went quiet for a second, then what Harry to believe was screams. But then there were cool hands touching his face, ice compared to his heated skin. <em>Safe</em>. He felt himself being wrapped up in strong arms. <em>Mate</em>. The scent of the forest and musk filled his senses. <em>Dominant</em>.</p><p>The pain started to lessen the more the arms held him, he could feel himself clinging to the stranger, breathing in his scent. Harry calmed down slowly, he heard a familiar baritone say, “You’re mine now Harry.”</p><p>Harry’s eyes flicked open just long enough to see red then he was surrounded by darkness.</p><p align="center">~*~</p><p>Voldemort could hear his mate screaming in pain from his manor. He was itching to go to him, help relieve some of his pain. It was nearing midnight again and Voldemort’s magic was vibrating with anticipation to see him. How would his mate change? Would he be an Incubus as well? Would he still have his Avada Kadavra eyes and delectably pale skin? Oh, he couldn’t wait. He hoped Harry wouldn’t make him wait too long to accept him as his mate, his dominant. Maybe he shouldn’t have been so forward in his letter. It was too late now.</p><p>There was a sharp knock on his door to his study. Voldemort wandlessly opened the door, hiding his surprise to find a frantic Sirius Black and a weary Remus Lupin. Both looked ragged and out of breath, almost as if they ran all the way here. Knowing Black, that was most likely true.</p><p>“Please my Lord! You have to help him!” Black yelled as he charged into the study. Black grabbed Voldemort by the shoulders shaking him slightly. “It’s Harry, my Lord please!” Black’s voice was borderline hysterical.</p><p>Lupin grabbed Black and reigned him away from Voldemort. “Please my Lord, Harry is not faring well.” Lupin was quiet in his request but his eyes were just as pleading as Black’s.</p><p>“What’s happened?” Voldemort could still hear Harry’s pleas off in the distance. The heart that he once believed did not exist felt like it was going to beat itself out of his chest. Harry had to make it, all the plans he had for the both of them.</p><p>“His magic is becoming out of control, lashing out.” Lupin said worriedly. “The Weasley’s are calling Dumbledore.” Black stiffened, visibly upset at the very idea of Dumbledore entering the ancestral home of the Blacks. “We know he’s your mate. Please help him!”</p><p>Of course, the werewolf and the seer would know. It was a well-kept secret that the Black family was a long line of seers. They would just rather have people think they were insane than have people try to use them for their gifts. Black was one of the strongest seers of the past few generations, Bella included.</p><p>“Take me to him” Voldemort ordered. He didn’t even bother grabbing an outer robe and he followed the couple to the Apparation point where Black gave him a piece of parchment with an address scribbled on it. He apparated to Grimmauld Place and poor Harry’s screams had intensified again. They sounded hoarse as if his voice would give out at any second.</p><p>Black and Lupin hurried through the door into the house with Voldemort a hairsbreadth behind them. Kreacher was standing at the base of the stairs behind the hoard of Weasley’s and the Order. Voldemort inwardly wished this was a different situation to where he could end this pathetic war once and for all. The prime Order members were right in front of him, like animals lined up for slaughter. Kreacher looked at the trio and gasped. “My Lord is here to saves the young master!”</p><p>Everyone turned at the exclamation, trying to see who it was the house elf was speaking about. The Weasley wench's face paled and the sight of Voldemort, still in his true, younger form. She gaped at him in a pathetic mimic of a fish. Voldemort pushed his way through the throng of blood-traitors to the room they were standing outside of.</p><p>Harry’s screams had diminished to little more than whimpers. Voldemort entered the room and was almost knocked back by wild magic. His magic instinctively reached out to try and soothe the defensive magic. Within moments Harry’s magic wrapped around his own as if happy to finally have a reprieve from the stress of trying to heal Harry. Next, he was assaulted by the delectable scent of sea mist and Sandalwood smoke. <em>Mate</em>! Voldemort worked his gaze to where Harry lay, still whimpering quietly in pain from his inheritance. He was laying on a sweat soaked flimsy mattress. His milky skin had a light sheen to it, making it appear translucent. Black hair in even more disarray than normal, his eyes were closed so their color still unknown to the Dark Lord. His body seemed longer and stronger yet delicate. <em>Submissive</em>. His inner Incubus growled happily.</p><p>He walked slowly towards Harry unaware of what he was actually doing. His instincts have almost completely taken over. He framed his mate’s face with his hands, waiting for a reaction. The effect was almost immediate. Harry stilled, still twitching no doubt from the after effects of such a painful experience.</p><p>Voldemort wrapped his arms around Harry when he noticed screaming. He looked behind him and saw Black holding the screaming Weasley wench out of the room. Black was yelling back while Lupin was holding the rest of the brood at wand point.</p><p>He had to get Harry out of here. Now. Before is Incubus took over completely and before Dumbledore showed up. He looked back at Harry, his mate finally seeming to be asleep. He couldn’t help but feel the absolute pride in having such a perfect specimen as his mate. All of Harry’s boyish looks had been replaced with a strong jaw and thin lips, strong cheekbones and a sharp nose. His hair had grown only a few inches like his own had. It was pitch black with a blueish hue to it. Harry’s body was stronger than it had been earlier that very day, longer too. Harry would easily be around five feet ten inches. Which was still smaller to his own six feet four inches.</p><p>He brushed his mate’s hair off his forehead, the iconic scar now faded and barely visible. “You’re mine now Harry.” He whispered, surprised when Avada Kadavra opened lazily just long enough for recognition to sharpen their gaze for a split second. Then, Harry completely collapsed in his arms, finally unconscious.</p><p>The Dark Lord picked Harry up gently, as to not disturb him, and turned to face the door. The Weasley wench stared at him in panic, “Put him down you monster! You will not harm him!” she screeched obviously trying her damnedest to imitate a banshee.</p><p>“I have no intentions of harming Harry.” Voldemort pulled Harry closer to himself. “But I will be taking him. He belongs with me.” Voldemort looked to Lupin and the werewolf cast a stupefy at the rest of the occupants of the residence. “Black, I expect that these blood traitors are obliviated and banned from this property by this time tomorrow. There is no way that Harry will be safe here if they can pop in and out whenever they please.” Voldemort paid no mind to the gaping Weasley wench as he simply walked past her, Harry wrapped protectively in his arms, and apparated out of the Black home</p>
