    <p>“Mum?”</p>
<p>The Burrow looked so much bigger, now that most everyone had left. Oh, it would fill again for family dinners or holidays. But if you dropped in on an average Tuesday, the house felt almost hollow. The bedrooms, worn from decades of constant use, now only saw occupants a few times a year and were kept from more than a thin layer of dust by Mum’s cleaning efforts alone.</p>
<p>“But of course, we’re keeping this house,” she always said. “What would we do with somewhere smaller? Imagine Christmas...no, our family will always need somewhere nice and big to come back to.”</p>
<p>Nice and big. And wild and messy and falling apart and wonderful. What other family could ever live there, could ever understand what it meant?</p>
<p>In spite of the circumstances, Ginny felt only relief as she heard the sound of clattering pans coming from the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Ginny? Is that you?”</p>
<p>Ginny entered the kitchen eagerly, but stopped short when she saw what was on the table: yesterday’s edition of <em> The Daily Prophet </em>, opened to the sports section. She stepped forward to grip the back of an empty chair, staring at the photograph in front of her.</p>
<p>Mona Wonckerson’s nose really <em> had </em> caved in without a fight. Ginny bit back the smile from her lips.</p>
<p>“A fine thing to open the paper and see!” Mum said, chopping up potatoes with a dangerous vigor. “My daughter, <em> mauling </em> another woman. A full-color photograph!”</p>
<p>“She deserved it,” Ginny said.</p>
<p>Mum sighed.</p>
<p>“Well, now <em> you’re </em>the one who’s out of a job, so it seems to me that you’d have been better served handing out your just desserts in a manner that didn’t involve a public brawl.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t lose my job,” Ginny said. “I’m suspended until the postseason.”</p>
<p>Mum glared at her, eyebrows raised.</p>
<p>“With pay?”</p>
<p>“Well...no. But that’s only because I’m technically a reserve still!” Ginny added, as though that changed anything.</p>
<p>“Making you <em> technically </em> without a job for the next five months, yes?” Mum hadn’t yet stopped making dinner, which Ginny supposed was a good sign. When she was mad—really mad—you were the only person in the world, and she was getting good and ready to pounce. This was just Mum fussing.</p>
<p>Fussing didn’t usually bother Ginny; the only trouble was when Mum’s fussing opened up doors that Ginny would really rather keep closed...</p>
<p>“Bill’s putting me at a desk job in Gringotts,” Ginny said, shrugging off her anxieties. “It’s all settled. I didn’t even write you until I knew for sure there was something for me back here. I’d stay with him, but they have Victoire, now, so there’s not much room.”</p>
<p>Mum stopped and turned to her, eyes wide.</p>
<p>“Well, you...of course, your father and I are happy to have you here,” she said, looking abashed. “That’s the last thing I’m worried about, actually—”</p>
<p>“—I’m going to take my things up,” Ginny interrupted. She suddenly would rather be anywhere else.</p>
<p>“Ginny…” Mum called after her, her voice thin and wary. Ginny closed her eyes and sighed.</p>
<p>“...yes?”</p>
<p>If Mum was going to pry, better to get it over and done with. Let her ask all the questions Ginny was dreading, so they could get to the part where everyone could just let things be.</p>
<p>Her coming out could never be ideal. Not after she’d broken up with Harry. That had soured things, cast every choice she made thereafter into a certain light. When she came out—whenever that was, however it happened—she wouldn’t be able to avoid tension. Not at first, anyway.</p>
<p>She had hoped, however, that the subject would come up with some grace, even excitement. Not because Ginny had punched another player in the nose for making what the <em>Prophet </em> had called “speculations about sexual proclivities.”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” Mum said, shaking her head. “Nothing. I’ll...your father will be home soon.”</p>
<p>Another time, then, Ginny thought. She headed up the stairs, feeling exhausted.</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>“Percy’s dropping by for dinner, dear. Isn’t that nice?”</p>
<p>They had to be kidding. But that’s how Mum and Dad were. Instead of just asking, they’d decided to reel in another sibling to get the answers they wanted. If Ginny had held onto any doubts that her parents suspected the truth, Percy’s arrival would have undone them entirely. Not only was he the appointed family inquisitor, he was also the first—and only— out Weasley sibling.</p>
<p>To Ginny’s immense gratitude, Percy showed far more discretion than she was used to seeing from him. He dodged the subject of why she’d come home until Mum and Dad meandered out of the room after dinner, a conspiratorial air about their movements.</p>
<p>“So, you’re working with Bill?” he asked delicately, swirling the wine in his glass.</p>
<p>“Not <em> with </em> Bill, exactly,” Ginny said, reaching for her own glass and taking a deep sip. “Not with anyone, actually. I’m sort of in the back. It turns out I don’t have many career skills, so I’m mostly fit for putting papers away.”</p>
<p>Percy shrugged. “Well, you have to start somewhere.”</p>
<p>“I’d already started somewhere,” Ginny said shortly. “I worked really hard to get where I was with the Harpies.”</p>
<p>“Of course you did,” Percy stammered. “I didn’t mean...well, it’s only for a few months.”</p>
<p>Ginny nodded. It wasn’t Percy’s fault that any of this had happened, and she had no desire to invent a conflict with him; they’d been getting along well the past few years. He was happier now, more relaxed (by Percy’s standards, anyway). If he’d made more mistakes than anyone else, he’d also done more to mend things; each time he found out Ginny was subbing in for someone (from Oliver, no doubt), he made sure to at least send her a note wishing her luck. She’d kept all of them; it made a difference, seeing the pile getting bigger.</p>
<p>“Sorry they pulled you in talk to me,” she said.</p>
<p>“Oh, I was thinking of coming by anyway,” Percy said smoothly. “I’m all alone at the house most of the time. Oliver tries to get back between games, but of course you know how it is. The team camaraderie and all that. He can’t be Floo’ing in every night; it looks standoffish.”</p>
<p>But despite his even tone, she knew he was lying. Ginny was willing to bet that all of three people playing for Puddlemere United knew that Oliver and Percy were more than roommates; <em> that </em> was why he couldn’t seem eager to come home every night, why he had to pretend he was just another player with nothing better to do than spend his nights with his teammates in cheap hotel rooms and seedy bars.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when Percy attended games, he came and left like any ordinary fan, only rarely stopping for a cordial but cursory conversation with Oliver.</p>
<p>Did he send Oliver notes when he couldn’t be there? Or would that be treading too close to living the way everyone else took for granted?</p>
<p>Everyone seemed fine with lying. Pretending. And Ginny was so tired of it. She was sure, looking at Percy, that he was tired as well. All alone half the time, and for what?</p>
<p>Merlin, Percy and Oliver even had an extra room in their flat, just so people wouldn’t ask questions. And it sat there, empty all the time because they—</p>
<p>—Percy had an empty room. And—for the first time in her life—Ginny was sure he’d be easier to deal with than Mum or Dad.</p>
<p>“Would you mind if I stayed with you?” she blurted out. “I’d pay for the room!”</p>
<p>Not nearly as much as it was worth, Ginny thought. But then, she <em> was </em> his sister.</p>
<p>Percy went pink.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry, Ginny...I’ve just had someone else move into the spare room,” he said, looking positively mortified</p>
<p>Ginny sat back in her seat, deflated. “Who?”</p>
<p>“Luna Lovegood.”</p>
