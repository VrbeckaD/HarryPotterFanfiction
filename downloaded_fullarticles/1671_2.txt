    <p>The day had come. September 1st was the day I had been dreading all year. I was going to Hogwarts. Most people would find this the most exciting day of their life. Not me. I was heading into the Great Unknown as an outcast. Being the son of the famous Harry Potter and the grandson of Death Eater Lucius Malfoy, wasn't going to help me fit in. But I had no choice. Like my dad always said, "Yes, I'm famous. Yes your grandfather was a Death Eater. But that doesn't mean people are going to hate you. Sure, you'll get a lot of stares and questions, but just be yourself. And if they don't like that, they're not worth your time."<br/>
So, with that in mind, I got on the Hogwarts Express, heading for my first year at Hogwarts. I just hoped maybe I could find a compartment with someone that will accept a gay son of a celebrity, and not judge me before they get to know me.<br/>
A pretty girl with brown hair looked up from her book as I looked in. "Glad to see I'm not the only one" she said.<br/>
I smiled. "Can I join you?" Then I hesitated. "I'll warn you though, we'll probably get a lot of stares and whispers because my dads are the famous Harry Potter and the renowned Death Eater's son, Draco Malfoy<br/>
"I don't care," she assured me. "My parents are muggles with rare mutations and I'm the definition of gay!"<br/>
We talked for hours before the trolley pulled up, and the witch asked if we’d like anything. I offered to get Lydia something. My parents are extremely rich, and gave me 75 galleons spending money, and there's no way I'd be able to spend it all on myself.<br/>
The witch said they had an extra stock on Cauldron Cakes, and they were only 1 Knut a piece. I offered to get three for both of us.<br/>
"I'm good thanks" she said, levitating some blocks from her pocket, a red, wispy magic flowing from her fingers. Her eyes, usually brown, were scarlet red, as she used her magic.<br/>
I saw her scarlet eyes, and told her that is the coolest bloody thing I've ever seen.<br/>
"Thanks," she said with a smile. "I get it from my mom. I'm glad to have someone who I can relate to."<br/>
"I have three older brothers," I told her, "Albus, James, and Scorpius, and an older sister, Lily. Do you have any siblings?"<br/>
Suddenly, a boy her age with silver hair ran into the compartment at the speed of light, "This is my twin brother, Pietro."<br/>
She telekinetically threw a block at Pietro, which he evaded.<br/>
"Wow," I said. "For twins, you guys don't look much alike."<br/>
"Well," she explained, "his hair is dyed. Naturally, it’s brown, like mine. Pietro gets his name from our uncle." she added. Suddenly, said brother stole her sandwich. "PIETRO ERIK MAXIMOFF! YOU GIVE THAT BACK!"<br/>
Her brother just waved it teasingly. "Come and get it, Lydia Drahomira Maximoff!" he yelled, returning the barb of using the middle name.<br/>
Smiling, I sneakily pulled my wand from my robes. "Accio sandwich!" The sandwich zoomed into his hand and I laughed as I handed it back to Lydia. "I might not have been to Hogwarts yet, but my whole family has."<br/>
Lydia used her gifts to make Pietro's own book whack him in the face.<br/>
I laughed at Pietro.  "A sandwich summoned away, then a book to the face. It looks like you've been tag-teamed."<br/>
"Sibling problems," Lydia said, rolling her eyes as Pietro ducked out of the compartment.<br/>
"Tell me about it," I told her. "I'm the baby of the family with 4 siblings. Sometimes they make you want to Cruciate the lot of them."<br/>
Suddenly the conductor's voice echoed through the train. "We will be arriving in Hogsmeade Station in 10 minutes. Please remember to change into your robes if you haven't already and make sure to grab all your luggage."<br/>
My stomach immediately went into knots. I looked at Lydia. "Am I the only one who feels like puking?"<br/>
"No," she said, throwing on her robes. "Try flying"<br/>
"I fly all the time," I said defensively. "My Dad was the youngest Seeker in a century. I meant I felt like puking because of the Sorting. I already have one Slytherin sibling, and I'm worried that's where I'll end up."<br/>
"Without a broom," she added. "Oh, I hope I'm in Gryffindor."<br/>
Suddenly the train came to an abrupt halt. I whimpered, and grabbed my suitcase from above my seat. As Lydia and I stepped off, Hagrid - my dad's best friend at Hogwarts - called "Firs' years this way!"<br/>
Suddenly my worries melted away. I'd just ask the Sorting Hat to place me in Gryffindor, just like my dad and Albus did. Plus, Hagrid was here, as well as my new friend. The sorting ceremony was going to be a piece of cake.<br/>
Lydia followed, nervous about what others might think of her, when she remembered something her mother had once told her dad, and had told Lydia before departing. She said it out loud quietly, "I can't control their fear, only my own."<br/>
"You're right," I told her. "Only you can control how you feel." Then I suddenly realized Lydia's lips hadn't even moved. Ummm....Then I realized her lips had moved a little, and I sighed, glad I didn't have yet another obstacle in this life.<br/>
Lydia raised an eyebrow. "I wouldn't be surprised," she said telepathically. "Besides being able to read other's thoughts, I can also send someone my thoughts, which I sometimes absentmindedly do"<br/>
"Oh," I said. "Good to know for future reference."</p>
