    <p align="left">A quiet had fallen over U.A high school. Students had long before returned to their dorms.</p>
<p align="left">In one particular classroom, the light filtered through the windows, casting an orange glow onto the only two students remaining. The sight was serene, however, in the eyes of the two boys, the sight was one of sadness.</p>
<p align="left">The dimming sunlight reflected brilliantly off their faces. Tear tracks glistened and sparkled under the gentle kiss of the glowing rays. Neither boy spoke. While the tracks still remained, the tears had run dry. The silence was calming to the two. One boy held his head low while the other seemed contemplative."<em>Sho-</em>" Once the silence was broken, the boy's eyes finally met.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"<em>Katsuki, I am so sorry.</em>" The boy's voice was ruff as he addressed the blonde opposite him. Never before had his voice contained such uncertainty as it did then.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"<em>I know Sho. I know you need to do this. I don't agree with it but I know it needs to be done.</em>" Katsuki Bakugou couldn't bring himself to be mad at Shouto for the job that had been forced upon him by the pro-heroes. His throat felt like it was being crushed under the strain of talking. Every word that was pushed passed his lips sounded wrong. He found himself biting his lip in a furious attempt to quench the sudden urge to sob. "<em>You need to go. I understand that.</em>" Bakugou couldn't hold back once he'd allowed his last defence down. He choked out a short sob, his breath shuddered as he tried to gain the upper-hand of his emotions once again. Warm arms wrapped around his lithe but steady frame. Despite his stuttering breaths, he smiled at a memory that surfaced within his mind. A memory of a time before they'd confessed to each other. Bakugou had asked Todoroki about his fire quirk. It had been an interesting conversation that had later turned into a confession from Todoroki. He'd confessed that he always listened if someone was complaining about the temperature of the room. He would then use his quirks to change it to suit them.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The remembrance and the constant supply of warmth calmed Bakugou down quickly, but he didn't release the other until he had his breath back completely. On one too many occasions Bakugou pulled away too soon and slipped back into disarray.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"<em>Still, I am sorry. I realise leaving will only hurt both of us, but it must be done. The place I am going doesn't have heroes as we do. I would feel guilty if I turned away someone who was asking for help.</em>" Shouto lifted Bakugou's chin and gave the recently taller male a small smile. Such an act was still rare even with how their lives had changed throughout their time at U.A, it brought a watery smile to Bakugou's own lips. A genuine smile instead of his usual cocky grin. </p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The classroom door slid open startling the two out of their soft silence. Into the classroom came Eraserhead, All Might and another man. The third man was old, with a long beard that tucked into the belt of his purple robes. His eyes twinkled behind half-moon shaped glasses and there was a kind smile on his lips. Even the need to punch Midoriya in the face didn't rival with Bakugou's urge to punch the old man in his already crooked nose. "<em>Bakugou, you can leave now. You know you can't be here for the briefing.</em>" Aizawa's words were plain and harsh, but they seemed to contain underlying care to them. He might act nonchalant, but Bakugou knew he did care for his students.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"<em>Whatever.</em>" The blonde grumbled. He stood up and turned back to Todoroki. "<em>You look after yourself Half 'n Half, you got it?</em>" He didn't let him reply before leaning down and leaving a peck upon the silent boy's lips. "<em>You'll send letters won't you?</em>"</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"<em>Of course. I will send one as soon as I have settled in, how does that sound?</em>" Bakugou just kissed Todoroki on the lips again, turned and left the room. Todoroki took that as good. </p>
<hr/>
<p>Todoroki sat with a suitcase resting against his chair leg. His red and white hair was untamed and his heterochromatic eyes reflected the glowing embers of the setting sun. Instead of his lover, sat opposite him were three men; two familiar and the third new. "<em>As you know, we chose you to do this job as you're one of our best students who's already ahead of studies up to this point in the course.</em>" Aizawa was the first to speak; completely business-like in his manner but still seemingly tired of everything at the same time. "<em>Due to the fact that you're underage, we still had to ask Endeavor's permission.</em>" There was a beat of silence.</p>
<p>"<em>Did he agree?</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>No, but we knew his opinion never really mattered to you so I'll ask you instead. Do you want to partake in this mission?</em>" Aizawa leaned forward. His eyes finally seemed to shimmer with something other than the will to sleep. Concern was not something common on his teacher's features, but none the less, the day had been filled with strange occurrences.</p>
<p>"<em>I do not want to go. However, I acknowledge that these people do not commonly ask for help from the outside world. If they are asking it must be important; this fact is not one I can ignore.</em>" Todoroki took a shaking breath and spoke with false confidence. "<em>It is not wanting to go. It is needing to go.</em>"</p>
<p>Aizawa nodded in understanding.</p>
<p>In the corner of his eye, the old man moved to retrieve something from within his robes. Todoroki turned his head to observe the two letters the man pulled from under the many layers. "<em>One is an admission letter to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and the other contains a key and a vault number for Gringotts bank.</em>" The man explained tentatively as he handed the parchment over to the teen.</p>
<p>Written in neat, curling Japanese was his name and an oddly specific address:</p>
<p align="center">
  <em> <strong>Mr S Todoroki</strong> </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em> <strong>Class 1-A, Seat No. 15</strong> </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em> <strong>U.A High School</strong> </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em> <strong>Musutafu</strong> </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em> <strong>Tokyo</strong> </em>
</p>
<p align="left">Slowly he turned the envelope over. Todoroki reached up with shaking fingers to break the wax seal. Breaking it would mean he was fully committing himself to the job he'd been given. If he returned it before then he could stop; he could live happily with Bakugou and never have to worry about it ever again. Only that was the problem. He would worry about it. He would be filled with guilt for not offering his help when a closed off society was asking for help.</p>
<p align="left">The sound of wax snapping and crumbling under strain filled the silent room. He'd chosen his path.</p>
<p align="left">Aizawa and All Might could be heard quietly releasing breaths. They'd understood the weight of his actions as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left"> The contents of the envelope consisted of two pages of parchment. One page was his letter of acceptance while the other was a list of items he would need. It was a long list of mostly books, but there were other practical things upon it as well. He was even allowed a pet; either a cat, owl, or toad. "<em>As you can see. The list of items you will need to be able to study at this school is extensive. The first place I will be taking you once we arrive in England is an area we can buy all the required items with ease.</em>" The man smiled across to Todoroki. "<em>You will also need a wand, but I thought it would be safer if that wasn't mentioned in the letter just in case someone reads it.</em>"</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">All Might, who'd remained silent the entire exchange, finally decided to join the conversation by speaking directly to Todoroki. "<em>Since this is something we're doing behind your father's back, I suggest you don't keep contact with him while you're away. He'll just believe you are staying at the school dorms.</em> <em>Headmaster Nedzu has agreed we can forge replies should he ever attempt to contact you.</em>"</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Todoroki nodded along with his words. He'd never been that close to All Might due to his father's hatred for the man, that didn't mean he didn't look up to him. He knew he'd never feel that connection to him like Midoriya did, but to him, that didn't really matter. "<em>When will we be leaving Professor?"</em> His words were carefully chosen. Despite having agreed to go, he still was uncertain whether it was the correct choice or not.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"<em>Since you will be joining Hogwarts in your fifth year, you need to study the spells and magical theory up until that point. This fact means you'll have to be joining us sooner rather than later so we can tutor you.</em>" The professor looked hesitant to reveal how soon Todoroki would have to leave. That thought didn't bring comfort to him in any way. "<em>You'll need to catch up with four years worth of work. Given you are extremely good at studying from what I've seen, I'd say the shortest time will be 10 weeks. You'll have to leave now.</em>" The weight of his words settled in Todoroki's gut, heavy as lead. None of his friends would be able to see him throughout the holidays. He would be able to send letters if he got an owl, but he didn't know how long it would take for it to arrive.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The sun had finally dipped behind the mountains in the distance, casting the school in shadows. The sky had turned purple, and it was reaching the point that reading would be difficult. Todoroki took another look at the books he would need for the year to come and sighed. "<em>Let us go then.</em>"</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The professor stood up and drew a stick from under his robes, similar to how he'd retrieved the envelopes. Todoroki watched in mild interest as the man pointed the stick at his luggage. "Reducio." The spell was in a foreign tongue, but it still had the desired effect. The half-red-half-white-haired boy watched as his suitcase and other bags shrunk down small enough for him to fit into his pocket. With another flick of his wand, the shrunken luggage was lifted off the ground and into Todoroki's open palm. He wasn't one to express his emotions, but the shock pulled his lips apart ever so slightly. Magic was pretty cool, even if it was similar to quirks. One person could do so many different things; they weren't limited to the stretches of their quirk. "<em>Now then my boy, follow me, please.</em>" Todoroki took one last look at the pro-heroes before turning and following the man out of the room. "<em>I do believe I neglected to introduce myself. I'm Albus Dumbledore.</em><em> I'm the headmaster of Hogwarts.</em>"</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"<em>Shouto Todoroki. There isn't anything that exciting about me other than my quirk.</em>" They walked through the halls to the entrance of the school. The silence that overfell them wasn't uncomfortable in any way. Todoroki presumed that was more on Dumbledore's part for radiating calm despite the teen's nerves.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The sky was dark by the time they'd reached the entrance of the building. Cars could be heard in the distance. There were several members of the press stood outside like usual. Todoroki pulled out a face mask from his back pocket and covered his face, even if his hair gave his identity away. On the ground in front of them was a dirty old boot. Dumbledore had stopped beside it and was smiling again at Todoroki. "<em>This will take us straight to England. We will need to wait a minute though, we're slightly early.</em>"</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The press seemed to have noticed their presence after a few seconds and started calling out questions. Neither of them even turned to acknowledge their being there.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Eventually, Dumbledore picked up the boot and held it out to Todoroki. "<em>Keep a hold of it and don't let go, my boy.</em>"</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">A pale hand reached out and wrapped around the toe of the brown boot. Dirt crumbled under the fingers making Todoroki scrunch up his face in disgust. However, his expression turned to one of shock when he felt his stomach clench as the boot seemed to pull his arm even though it wasn't moving. Todoroki tightened his grip on the boot as he was pulled forward.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The world spun and lurched in all directions at once. One moment they were stood in front of U.A high school and the next they were standing on a cold, dank street.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The pavements were glistening with rain in the sunlight. Each house was identical to the one next to it. Todoroki found it slightly strange, even with the sun peeking from behind the thinning clouds, the streets remained dark and dreary. The bricks that made up the houses were grey and each window had some layer of dirt hiding the inside from onlookers.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Dumbledore placed the boot back on the floor, in the same position as before, but in a different country. They waited a moment, both of them watched the old, browning boot for something to happen. It seemed like nothing would after a minute of waiting, Todoroki was inclined to believe it was a regular boot again. He was proven wrong when it started to vibrate. He watched in interest as it seemed to collapse in on itself and vanish from sight. "<em>Is that what happened to us?"</em> He didn't like the thought of that. The thought of being pulled into such a small space that you break through reality and appear in another place turned his stomach in all the wrong ways, but, then again, that was what using the boot had felt like.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"<em>Yes. It's called a portkey. We use them for longer travel. Shorter travel, we use apparition.</em>" Finally, Dumbledore turned away from the spot the boot had previously been in and as he explained, walked towards space between the eleventh house and the thirteenth. Wait. Todoroki did a double take. There wasn't a twelfth house. Before, it was as if he hadn't noticed the missing house on the street, but once he realised the house was missing, he was suddenly aware of a pressure in the air that made his chest feel tight and his legs slow to an uncomfortable pace. "<em>Ah, you noticed the missing aspect of this street. Number twelve is where we're heading. You'll see it soon.</em>" Todoroki frowned in confusion at Dumbledore's words.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"<em>How can we go to a house that doesn't exist?"</em> Todoroki looked up to the older man and saw him smiling over his shoulder. Dumbledore winked at the teen.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"<em>If I told you, it would ruin the magic of it.</em>" The closer to the houses they got the tighter the pressure gripped at Todoroki's entire being. It felt like it was repelling him away from the place. He didn't know if Dumbledore was feeling that same anti-attraction force or not, but he didn't seem affected by it nearly as much as Todoroki. Closer and closer they drew to the houses.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Then, they came to a stop before the small space of wall between eleven and thirteen. The pressure that had been pushing him away from the neat row of grey brick buildings vanished. He sucked in a breath that he hadn't previously been able to take. A frown formed on his face in confusion when the buildings in front of him began to shake and rumble. The only analogy he could think of was when Mt Lady tried to walk in giant form between buildings with only a single lane road separating them.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Confusion was only one of the emotions that flicked through Todoroki's mind as he watched the two building pull apart and contract to fit another house between them. Awe overtook any rational thought as he stared up at the building where the small wall had previously been. Despite the grey bricks being previously hidden from sight, they looked like they'd always been there. The edges of the new building blended perfectly with the surrounding clay work, and if Todoroki hadn't just watched it emerge from between two other buildings, he would have presumed it had always been there. "<em>Welcome to Twelve Grimmauld Place. Home to the Order of the Pheonix.</em>"</p>
