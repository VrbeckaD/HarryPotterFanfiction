    <p>“I love you.” I whispered to my new husband. I couldn't believe it. I am now y/n Malfoy. Draco and I had a traditional wedding. It took about a year to plan but it was worth it. Even though I had a stick up my ass the entire time because of Molly and I had cold feet before walking down the aisle, it was really worth it. I couldn't be happier if I tried. Not a lot of people came. Just family and friends. We were at the reception when Hermione stood up to give a toast. She quickly gathered everyone's attention because of her presence.</p><p>“Good evening everyone! How are you all doing tonight?” It was a rhetorical question so no one replied. The girl continued, “Well we are here tonight because of a very special couple,” she gestured towards Draco and I. I could tell she was nervous. I rubbed her back to try and calm the Gryffindors nerves. She took in a breath and exhaled to calm herself. “Draco and y/n Malfoy. When we were in school together there were a lot of rumors about the two. And like most, I chose not to believe them. I couldn't believe them if I wanted to. Like everybody else I thought that a couple like them could never happen. But I was wrong. I was so very wrong. Not a lot of people knew y/n during school. Everybody knew Draco. So when I first saw the popular jock with the unpopular outcast I was quite surprised. I'm glad I saw them together though because I could not think of a better match. I’ve never seen them both so happy. They changed each other in spectacular ways. Really the only way to describe it is unexpected.”</p><p>By the end of the speech I was grinning from ear to ear. I had forgotten that we only told Lucius and Narcissa how we met. Draco and I were originally planning to tell the story at our engagement party. But it would be too complicated with out all the details. You see, it all really started with a one night stand.</p><p>Euphoria. That's the feeling we were in. We were on a bed in the ROR and we were about sixteen so we didn't know the complications that would come with the one night stand we had that night. Things were getting heated when Draco started to kiss me down my neck giving me chills. Our hands were everywhere. In our hair, on our shoulders, on our chests, we couldn’t keep track if we wanted to. The kisses were rough and they sent waves of pleasure down my spine. Having never been touched like this, I could only imagine what the real thing would feel like. The tent in his pants was rubbing against my thigh as Draco sucked on my neck, leaving purple hickeys. I was in such a daze I didn't realize I was palming the boy. I had no idea what I was doing and was confused. I was scared but I was ready. I wanted this. Draco lifted up his head and while I had the chance I turned his head towards me and kissed him so I could unbutton his shirt. I was having trouble with it because my hands were fumbling everywhere and they were shaking. He let out a loud laugh making my face turn bright red. “Shut up.” I mumbled in a playful but serious way.</p><p>Still laughing he replied “How about you unbutton your shirt and I unbutton mine? Yeah?” He took my shaking hands and placed them on the buttons near my collar bone. I started to unbutton but I was still having trouble. I looked up to see a shirtless Draco staring at me with his signature smirk. He chuckled again and removed my hands to unbutton the frustrating piece of clothing. Once he slid my shirt off my shoulders I let out a breath I didn't know I was holding.<br/>
I looked at his toned body, my want for him only growing more. I placed a hand on his pale chest slowly pushing him down. It was like I was on autopilot. Like I had no idea what to do yet I did. Once he was lying on his back I decided to undo his belt and his trousers leaving him in his black boxers. I put each leg on the sides of his hips straddling him and he let out a deep groan. As I was grinding on him, Draco put his hands on the hem of my skirt waistband quickly undoing the button so they could fall off easily. Once he was done he put both hands on my shoulders and turned me over forcefully so that I was now the one on the bottom. The blonde gave me a light kiss on the lips and moved to my neck, slowly trailing rough kisses down my chest. The boy kept going lower and lower until his head was hovering over my skirt. He paused for a second and quickly took off the bottoms, throwing them to the side. Once the Slytherin boy was done he put his hands on my inner thighs and spread them leaving me in a very vulnerable position. He lowered his head so it was hovering right above my panties. This time he gently tore away the piece of fabric from my body. “Fuck princess, look how wet you already are,” he chuckled, the hot air meeting my exposed heat.</p><p>“Draco,” I whimpered.</p><p>“What was that princess?” The boy asked. He didn't wait for me to respond, instead he nibbled on my inner thigh leaving more purple marks on my body. I started squirming and letting out soft moans until he plunged his tongue inside me. This time I let out a loud moan. The pale hand that was resting on my stomach moved to my clit, slowly pushing down and rotating in circles. I moved one of my hands to his hair, slightly tugging while the other gripped the bedsheet in pleasure. It felt so good.</p><p>“Oh my god,” I breathed. “Just.. don't stop..” I shuddered this time. As I did, Draco switched so he was now fingering me and using his tongue to play with my clit. My gripping against his blonde tousled hair and the bedsheet got harsher as I was beginning to reach my climax. The knot in my stomach was getting tighter and it was starting to get harder to hold in my moans of pleasure. The boy was moving his fingers in ways as if saying “come here.” As I was about to reach my climax, he stopped. “DRACO!” I yell in frustration. He chuckled again looking up at me. He pulled his fingers out of my entrance and sat up pulling me closer to him. He put his hands behind my back and undid the clasp on my bra so it fell down my arms leaving me completely naked. “I’m gonna get you back for that.”</p><p>“Oh really? How?” Draco asked with a mischievous look on his face. I rolled my eyes and pushed on his chest with both my hands so he could fall back. I put my hands on the waistband of his boxers and slowly pulled down revealing his hard member. I gulped not knowing what to do with it. “Like what you see?” The boy laughed again.</p><p>“Um, yeah..” I hesitantly took him took him in my mouth and tried not to seem awkward (which probably wasn't working). I bobbed up and down on his shaft trying to go deeper every time but I couldn't. There was no reaction from him until he spoke up.</p><p>“Have you never sucked cock before? Replace your teeth with your lips and use your tongue more.”</p><p>I lifted my head up from the current position it was in to reply. “Um, ok.” I said in a small voice.</p><p>“What was that?” Draco asked looking down at me. I felt my face turn bright red as he smirked. I still had his manhood in my hand when he spoke up again. “Don't be shy darling, just know that I’ve got a hard on because of you. You might want to work to keep it that way, yeah? Don't want my cock to go soft?”</p><p>I cleared my throat before I could answer so I could prevent voice cracks and spoke with a deeper voice than I was meaning too. “No.”</p><p>“Yeah? Well get to work then, you can't have your hand on my cock forever,” the boy paused, still looking down at me. Then he continued with a remark that I wish I could self obliviate from my mind forever. “Actually, I wouldn't mind seeing you so desperate for me all the time.” He smirked.</p><p>Ignoring him I turned back to the erection in front of me just now noticing a bridge of saliva connecting the head of his penis and my lips. Feeling my cheeks turn fiery red I was quick to wipe away the bridge with my hand.</p><p>“Should’ve kissed it.” I heard Draco mumble. I ignored not wanting to kill the mood. And I started again, slower this time. First, I licked his entire length because last time I didn't and I had trouble. My hand was near the head giving it a gentle squeeze as I pumped my hand up and down his shaft. I heard a low groan come from the boy above me. I smiled knowing I was succeeding in returning the tease.</p><p>I positioned myself getting ready to take him in my mouth again. As I did, Draco spread his legs so I had better access. As I was about to take him into my mouth for the second time Draco called “Don’t be nervous, princess, just relax.” As if he could sense my teneseness he used both hands to hold my hair back into a makeshift ponytail. I took in a deep breath and exhaled causing the blonde to arch his back. With my new found confidence I went down on him.</p><p>Using Draco's advice really helped. It was easier to bob my head up and down his shaft and he let out short breaths as the pleasure was getting to him. Eventually, I dug my face so deep you couldn't tell his manhood was there anymore. Even though I was bobbing slow I could feel his hard member starting to twitch inside my mouth. I felt uncomfortable swallowing his seed so before I did, I raised my head to find another bridge of saliva connecting the both of us. Remembering Draco's comment I gave the head a light and gentle kiss. A few seconds after, when I still hand the blonde in my hands, a white, sticky substance shot out and landed all over me as a low groan slipped from his mouth. I shut my eyes closed as my face turned bright red.</p><p>Draco shifted to look down at me. He let out a chuckle as he firmly grabbed my elbow to help me get back to his eye level. I still had my eyes closed because some of his seed landed on my eyelids. His shaft was right under my thigh and next to my heat so I could tell that I was sitting on Draco's waist. I found Draco's chest with my hands and gently rested my hands on him. “Can you please wipe this off?” I asked.</p><p>“I could.. but I don't want to.” The Slytherin boy replied.</p><p>“Draco.” I deadpanned. “Please.”</p><p>“What’s that? Are you begging?”</p><p>“If I could roll my eyes I would, I hope you know that.. but yes, I’m begging you to get this off me.” I said sarcastically.</p><p>“One condition.”</p><p>“And what’s that Mr. Malfoy?”</p><p>“Be my fuck buddy.” The blonde said seductively. I felt my face turn so red it could blend in with a Weasley's hair color. I didn't think he was serious until I realized he was waiting for my answer.</p><p>“Oh.. um, sure?” I whispered. After that I felt a pair of warm hands on my face wipe away the white seed. Then two thumbs swept over my eyelids gently cleaning away the white substance signaling that I could open my eyes again. I looked into a pair of icy blue eyes that were looking right back at me. Dracos smirk grew wider as he showed me his cum covered thumb.</p><p>“Open,” he demanded. I did as he said and opened my mouth to be met with his thumb in my mouth. The taste was something different. It was bitter, salty, and sweet at the same time. The texture was a weird thing to have in your mouth. I took Draco's hand in mine but kept it it my mouth. I was still looking into the blue orbs that were now focused on my lips. I started to pull Draco's hand out softly and made sure to rub some of his seed on my lips. When his thumb was completely out of my mouth I whispered,</p><p>“I want you to know what I’m tasting,” and I leaned down for a kiss. It was chaste, and I could feel Draco parting his lips against mine. I felt his tongue graze against mine as he explored my mouth. His hands found their way to my breasts and lightly squeezed. The still wet cum/saliva covered thumbs grazed over my pink nipples and tugged causing me to start grinding on him once again.</p><p>I detached our lips from the kiss we had just shared only for Draco to pull me back into it. This one was hotter and wetter. My hands that were resting on his chest found their way to his cheeks and his found their way to mine, but not the type of cheeks that you’re thinking of. The boy gave me a light slap on my ass as I started to grind on him once again. I let out a gasp at the stinging pain that felt so good. Draco used his teeth to bite my bottom lip to bring me back to the kiss. The pale hands that were on my ass gave a tight squeeze causing me to moan out. “You like that, princess?” I gave a small nod as if saying “keep doing that, I like it.” But he stopped. I opened my eyes to see him focused on his member and my heat. He brought down his right hand from my ass and held his hard member with his hand. “Lift up,” he whispered in my ear sending shivers down my spine. My nerves were back but I did it anyway. I felt him lineup his cock with my entrance. He brought his right hand back to my hip and began to push down. A whimper of pain escaped my lips but he kept pushing me down. “You like that, baby?” He asked in his husky voice. I couldn’t answer, all I did was shut my eyes. Eventually Draco's entire length was inside me. I brought my hands back to the boys chest and put on pressure so he could let me adjust.</p><p>I opened my eyes as the pain was starting to feel better. I stopped holding on so tightly to the blonde and I relaxed. “Okay,” I breathed, “Okay, I’m ready.” Sensing the pain I was in Draco thrusted into me slowly. The pain I was in was now turning into waves of pleasure. I started to get eager and began riding him myself.</p><p>“Fuck, y/n, you’re so tight.” Draco grunted.</p><p>I ignored him being enveloped in my pleasure. I was reaching my climax when Draco lifted me from him and threw me to the side. He got on his knees and turned me so I was lying on my stomach. “Are you ever gonna let me cum?” I asked exhausted.</p><p>“Yeah, just not now,” I could practically hear the boys smirk from behind me as I rolled my eyes. “Face down arse up,” he commanded. With a red face I did as I was told. I felt one of Draco's hands on my ass as he slapped it causing me to moan again. When I was distracted with pleasure he lined his cock up with my entrance again and thrust hard into me.</p><p>It hurt. The angle he was thrusting in didn't feel good. “Ahh,” I yelped. I grabbed the bedsheets under my hands and twisted them in pain. I didn't like it at all. The pain wasn’t getting better as I bit my bottom lip to stop myself from letting out a choked sob. Draco's right hand found its way to my hair and tugged as the boy bent over to whisper in my ear.</p><p>“You like that, princess?”</p><p>I let out an inaudible sound of pain that the blonde must have taken for pleasure as he thrust harder into me causing the sob I tried so hard not to let out, to come out. “Stop,” I cried, “please stop.” And he did.</p><p>He took himself out of me and turned me around so I was on my back. He crawled on top of me and wiped the tears from my eyes. “I’m sorry,” he whispered, “I’m sorry I hurt you, I didn't want it to be like that. Please don't cry.”</p><p>I closed my eyes as more tears began to fall and Draco kept wiping them from my face.<br/>
I nodded just to let him know that I heard what he said. His hands eventually moved to brush the h/c strands of hair out of my face. I sniffled then opened my eyes to see a face covered with worry in front of me. I kissed the blonde lightly on the lips and whispered “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Why are you sorry?” He asked, his face now laced with confusion. To be honest I didn't know why I was sorry. I guess It’s become a habit after saying it so much.</p><p>“I don't know,” I smiled, “I really don't know,” this time I laughed and shook my head. “You’re not mad though?” I asked.</p><p>“No.. no, why would I be mad?”</p><p>“I don't know. I just thought, I don't know what I thought. I just- I thought you would be mad at me for wanting to stop for a moment.”</p><p>“No, I’m not mad, you were in pain and you wanted to stop. I wouldn't force you to do anything you didn't want to. I wouldn't force anyone to do anything they didn't want to, I’m not like that.”</p><p>“Okay, can we just not.. you know, do that position again? I didn't like it and it hurt.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah of course.” He moved his hand to brush the hair out of my face again. He bent his head down to kiss my tear stained cheeks. I stretched my hand down to his half boner and began to pump until he was completely hard again. He bowed his head next to my ear in pleasure as he whispered, “I thought you wanted to stop?”</p><p>“For a moment,” I whispered back, “I only wanted to stop for a moment.” Draco nodded as I lined myself up with him again, “Okay, I’m ready.” I said as a signal for the blonde to push himself inside me again. When he did I could still feel the pain from earlier but only a little bit since we took a break and we were in a new position. It started to get better though and eventually turned into pleasure. Draco was still thrusting slowly as if I were a delicate piece of glass that would shatter in his arms at one wrong movement. I turned my head so my lips were right next to his ear. “Go faster.” I whispered. This time it was Draco who whimpered. He nodded his head and slammed hard into me.</p><p>It felt so much better this time. I let out a loud moan of pleasure as my hands found their way around Draco's back. My legs wrapped themselves around Draco's torso trying to pull him closer into me. Draco kept thrusting into me and I started to dig my nails into his back and bite my lip in pleasure. “DON'T STOP!” I yelled. The familiar knot in my stomach became noticeable as Draco's thrusts became shorter and choppier. More moans escaped my lips as I clawed at Draco's back even harder. Draco lifted his head to look at me in the eyes. Before he could turn his head away I pulled him into a long and blissful kiss. Before we pulled apart he thrust into me again and it was like a tsunami of pleasure washed over me as I climaxed. I interrupted the kiss we were having to yell out in pleasure. It seemed like my moan pushed Draco over the edge because before his seed spilled inside me he pulled out and collapsed on top of me.</p><p>We stayed like that for a few moments before Draco got off the bed and covered me with the blanket. Still out of breath he spoke “I’m going to take a shower.” I nodded to let him know I heard him and started to drift off into sleep as my eyelids got heavier. The last thing I saw was a butt naked Draco Malfoy open a bathroom door that had just appeared before losing consciousness. Oh how lucky was I to no longer call myself a virgin.</p>
