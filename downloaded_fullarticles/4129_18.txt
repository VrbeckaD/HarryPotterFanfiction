  <strong>Chapter 1</strong>
</p>
<p>It was odd returning home after so many years, I left Britain seven centuries ago to get away from the hero worshipping and expand my knowledge, for me the years away from Britain had been interesting to say the least. Following my defeat of Tom Riddle, and he refused to use the man’s preferred title, I decided to leave the country and the bad memories of the place. The battle had been a bloody affair to say the least, the first person I lost in the war was Sirius Black, my godfather or dogfather as he preferred and the last was my girlfriend Daphne Greengrass. I was called a protégé in Hogwarts but still Tom was way more experienced and knowledgeable to be beaten by a 17 year old boy, I had participated and won some duelling championships but all was nothing in comparison to my duel with Tom. I wasn’t sure that I would come out of that battle alive and on the winning side but for some extreme luck I got an upper hand on Tom thanks to the Deathly Hallows.</p>
<p>The cloak of invisibility has been in my family for generations, the resurrection stone and the elder wand was the last gift I got from my mentor Albus Dumbledore. Following Tom’s defeat, I tried to get rid of the elder wand and resurrection stone but it was of no use, so I kept it a secret and moved on. The sorting hat took a long time for me debating in between Ravenclaw and Slytherin but my intelligence and love for knowledge led me to Ravenclaw, even after the war I didn’t lose my love for knowledge. In my travel around the globe I learned many old and ancient magical arts, I was very interested in muggle science and I spent a load of time in learning the technology, I also found a smart and beautiful wife, but my bad luck struck again. Due to mastering the three deathly hallows I couldn’t die, I watched as my wife died and my children aged in front of my eyes. I distributed my wealth and lordships between my children and now I am here to give one last attempt on going on my next great adventure.</p>
<p>So now I am back in Britain to pass through the veil that took the life of my godfather. Entering the Ministry Of Magic undetected wasn’t hard with the help of my invisibility cloak, without stopping anywhere I headed straight towards the department of mysteries. It wasn’t hard to find the death chamber as the magic of Veil was similar to that of Hallows. I stepped in front of the veil, “Well, who would have thought dying would be hard.” And with that I stepped into the archway.</p>
<p>It was a funny feeling, like my body was cleansed of all dirt and grime on it, suddenly I was choking, sputtering, flailing in the blackness seeping inside me, under my skin, into my bones and my core. I felt like I was being watched and suddenly every memory, every laugh, every tear of my long life was being played in front of my eyes, I felt like I was being judged by the blackness surrounding me. I don’t know how much time I spent like that but at last I found myself in front of the black lake of Hogwarts, it looked much cleaner and void of any life.</p>
<p>“We finally meet, master.” I looked over my shoulder toward the figure whose face was covered in hood like a dementor.</p>
<p>“Death?” I asked tentatively, even if I was here to die doesn’t meant that I had to pick up a fight with the end of all things that is death.</p>
<p>Death took of the hood and revealed her pale and ashen face of a beautiful aristocratic women, it reminded me of the old vampire lady who taught ne blood magic. “Yes master.” Her voice was sweet but it gave me chills, “I expected your arrival.”</p>
<p>“Then you know why I am here lady death, and please don’t call me master I don’t like that word.”</p>
<p>Death laughed and her voice filled me with dread, “You are the owner of my hallows and that makes you my master Harry Potter, you are the Master Of Death hence my master.” Even till the end, I always thought that the story of three brothers was a bed time story and not the complete truth, I always thought that the hallows were enchanted items created by a powerful wizard like Merlin but hearing the truth of the hallows from death herself was something else. “You can’t die master at least not yet.”</p>
<p>I was shocked, all of this and I still can’t die, I don’t know why fate hates me, “I don’t think I want to go back lady death. My life have no purpose and I want to see my friends and family, please reconsider.”</p>
<p>Death sadly replied, “It is out of my power master, even if you ordered me to do so, you can use the stone to meet the dead but I can’t kill you.” I laughed at that, “Death can’t kill me, what an irony.” Death smiled and continued, “But maybe I can give you something else.”</p>
<p>I looked at her, “What will that be?”</p>
<p>Death replied, “I know your childhood wasn’t that normal or fun, you had a hard life with your relatives but I can send you to one of many dimensions where this time you can enjoy your childhood.” Now that piqued my interest, the Dursley’s made sure to make my childhood a hell. “I like the sound of it, please continue.”</p>
<p>Death smirked, “I can send you to a dimension where you can have a happy life, where your body will age and you will come back here after your body dies. I can’t give you a family as it will disturb balance of the universe but you can live a happy life, your magic will be with you but it will be locked away and I will keep the hallows with me till you stay in that dimension. What do you say master?”</p>
<p>I had nothing else to do, I can’t die and there is a chance to stay in a world where I can live a happy life so there wasn’t any reason to not accept death’s offer, “I think I will take your offer, any other information you can share about the world I will be going to.”</p>
<p>Death smiled as I accepted her idea, “You will be a small child of 5 years again master, you will learn as you grow up but I can tell you this, the world you will be going to is full of mythical creatures that humans have befriended. Do expect a gift from me too master.” With those last words I was again surrounded by the blackness but this time it was nothingness.</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>Pallet town was more of a village than a town, it was mostly filled with farmers but what made the town special was the research facility and pokemon coral of the world renowned pokemon expert, Professor Samuel Oak. It was a small but beautiful town with no sign of pollution that is one of the reason Prof. Oak liked this place, it was also his hometown.</p>
<p>Samuel Oak was standing in his coral looking at the various type of pokemons staying in his coral, his trusty Arcanine running with his cubs, his Dragonite breaking fights and maintaining peace between the pokemon residing in the coral, the coral was home to many pokemon belonging to various trainers.</p>
<p>Prof Oak loved pokemons, he liked to help people understand the wonderful creatures that is the reason he became the regional professor of the Kanto region. His thoughts drifted towards a young boy who stayed in the Pallet town orphanage Harry Potter, he found the boy when he was 5 years old in the nearby forest sleeping with an unusual pokemon egg, today he talked to Harry again after almost 5 years.</p>
<p>
  <em>Flashback</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Prof Oak opened the door of his research facility and found a 10 year boy with unruly black hair and emerald green eyes standing in front of him. He was standing there with a smile on his face and holding a Togetic in his arms. “Hey prof Oak.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Prof Oak smiled, “Hello Harry, how are you? I see that your Togepi evolved into Togetic.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Harry nodded, “Yeah, she evolved a year ago. Actually, I need your help.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Prof Oak inspected Togetic and asked, “What can I help you with?”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“You know that after 3 years I can take the exam to get the Pokemon trainer’s license.” Prof Oak nodded so Harry continued, “I just wanted to know more about pokemon, I want to know about the pokemon in other regions and things like that. I know you have books on these with you, can I please borrow them. I will take care of the books and return them after I finish it.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>After seeing the expression on Harry’s face prof Oak laughed, “Sure Harry, you can borrow my books but you must take good care of them. You know you can come to the coral and meet the pokemon staying there.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Harry beamed, “I will do that professor.” Prof Oak smiled, “Then come in I will show you my book collection, you can choose from there.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Flashback end</em>
</p>
<p>Prof Oak knew Harry was a smart kid, when he found Harry he tried to look for his parents but he couldn’t find anyone with relation to Harry, so he put Harry in the town orphanage. He smiled at the prospect of another young talent interested in a journey full of pokemon and adventures.</p>
<p>XXXXXX</p>
<p>The said boy was sitting atop a tree reading the book he borrowed from prof Oak while his Togetic sat on his head. Harry liked Pallet town very much, covered with forest, pure and fresh air with visible stars in the night sky it reminded him of his first home Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Harry remembered the day he woke up as a 5 year old with an egg, he only told his name to prof Oak and nothing else, officer Jenny tried to find someone else with the last name of Potter but found no one. Harry lied to them by saying that he doesn’t remember anything and he was admitted in the Pallet town orphanage, the egg he was found with hatched into a cute Togepi, the moment Harry saw the intelligent amber eyes of Togepi he knew it was his first friend Hedwig. Harry’s Togepi was bigger than normal Togepi, which he later found out was called a king size trait.</p>
<p>Harry learnt about the mythical creatures that death talked about, he found out that they are called Pokemon, Harry was always interested in magical creatures in his world and he had done many research on them too but Pokemons were on a whole other level. Harry learnt about how a trainer befriends pokemon and catch it in a pokeball, pokemon fought each other in official battles with the help of their trainer. Pokemon love to battle even if they are friendly, they want to be strong and they are also a bit show off, that was the reason pokemon battles were quite famous in this world.</p>
<p>Harry always loved duelling and the prospect of battling another trainer in leagues was mind blowing for Harry, the moment he got to know that if he got the trainer’s license he can travel this world and meet new pokemon and compete in leagues he was set on that path. Harry started with training Hedwig with the help of some old trainers who knew what move Togepi can use, that is why he decided to ask prof Oak for help. Before becoming a professor, Samuel Oak was the Kanto champion, his Arcanine, Dragonite and Charizard are still strong enough to beat a regional champion.</p>
<p>The book he was reading was on the topic of pokeballs, Harry was amazed by the technology of pokeball, how a small ball can put such big pokemons inside them was amazing for Harry. Technology in this world was advanced in comparison to his home world but still it wasn’t surrounded by pollution, this is one of the main things Harry loved here after Pokemon.</p>
<p>Harry wanted to pass the trainers exam to get his trainers license, the trainers who would pass will get a starter pokemon from prof Oak and a Pokedex, which was a device containing all the information researched on any pokemon discovered. He was in for a tough competition as in his age group there were few other good students including the grandson of prof Oak, but Harry was a Ravenclaw and he wasn’t going to back down.</p>
<p>Harry looked around and said to his friend and first pokemon, “Hey Hedwig, I feel like exploring the forest today a bit. We’ll just stay nearby to the town, I don’t think we are ready to face the stronger wild pokemons. You also need to increase your training, come on.” Hedwig nodded as Harry put the book in his bag and climbed down the tree.</p>
<p>Harry surveyed the forest area nearer to the town and found some wild Pidgeys and Rattatas to battle with Hedwig, he finally got to a clear spot he used to train Hedwig.</p>
<p>“Come on girl, first we will work on your Magical Leaf attack then we will work on the strength and accuracy of your ancient power.” Harry said to Hedwig as she got ready to train, Harry deposited leaves nearby and said, “Try to make the leaves sharp and then attack at the tree, once you get hold on the proper power in the leaves we will work on your accuracy by using your psychic powers to hit moving objects.”</p>
<p>Harry watched as Hedwig tried to make the leaves sharp and hit the tree with all the power she could muster, Harry knew Hedwig was very intelligent possible more than he was, she always liked to read with Harry and her bigger size due to the king’s trait also gave a boost to her powers.</p>
<p>It took nearly a couple of hours for Hedwig to be able to do a decent Magical Leaf attack, “Good job girl we will work on improving it later, come have some bacon, you look tired.” Harry pulled a few bacons from his bag for himself and Hedwig, even in the new world Hedwig still loved bacons more than anything else.</p>
<p>Just when he was going to eat he heard a rustle in the nearby bush, Harry looked toward the bush and found a shape of some pokemon hiding behind it, he said loudly, “Whoever is there come out.”</p>
<p>After a few moments, the pokemon came out of the hiding and it was a shiny Charmander. Harry’s jaw dropped as he looked at the pokemon, Charmander’s are official fire type starter of Kanto region and they were very rare to find in the wild and here he was looking at a shiny Charmander.</p>
<p>Charmander eyed the bacon in Harry’s hand, Harry saw the Charmander’s look and said while smiling, “You are hungry huh, do you want some bacons? I think we have enough bacons for the three of us, what do you say Hedwig?”</p>
<p>Hedwig eyed the new pokemon and then nodded, Charmander happily ran forward and sat in front of Harry with Hedwig and started munching on the bacons. Harry laughed as he looked at the young Charmander, “You look hungry buddy.”</p>
<p>Charmander nodded his head while eating, “Char Char Mander.”</p>
<p>After finishing their food, they took some rest while Hedwig and Charmander talked in their own pokemon language. Harry got up, “Come on Hedwig let’s work on your Ancient Power.”</p>
<p>Hedwig started using Ancient Power again and again trying to improve the attack while Harry and Charmander watched from the side lines, after some time Charmander tugged Harry pants, “Char Charmander.” He said pointing toward Hedwig.</p>
<p>Harry asked, “You want to train too.” Charmander nodded happily, “Well then show me what attacks you know.”</p>
<p>Charmander nodded and showed all the attacks he knew, he started with Scratch which was pretty good, followed by Smoke Screen and lastly Fire Fang. Harry smiled, “These are good, you just need to work on the strength of these attacks. But I think I can teach you a new attack, Ember.” Charmander eyes lit up at that, Harry smiled “Well if you have a strong ember then it will be easier for you to learn Flamethrower in the future.”</p>
<p>Charmander nodded as Harry continued, “Now you already know Fire Fang so you can build fire inside your body, I want you to take a deep breath and then try and collect the fire in your math, when the fire gets too hot spit it out.”</p>
<p>Charmander walked a bit away from Harry and tried to do what Harry said, surprisingly it was a very good first attempt on Ember, “Char Char.”</p>
<p>Harry laughed, “Good work, you are a fire type and fire will be your main strength. Repeat the process till you can produce powerful ember quickly.” Charmander nodded and got into working on his new attack. “Well looks like I have got another friend.”</p>
<p>As the day ended the two pokemon were very much tired after all the practice so Harry gave them some pokemon food, “Hey Charmander if you want to train with us you can come here any day you want to as we train here every day, now we should be going.” Charmander nodded, “Come on Hedwig let’s head back, see you later Charmander and be safe.” With that Harry left with Hedwig following him behind.</p>
<p>In the following years Harry trained with Hedwig and Charmeleon every day, he kept it a secret and only told prof Oak. Harry found that prof Oak was very helpful, he always gave him small tips or suggestions, Harry made good friends with most of the pokemons in the coral. On his twelfth birthday prof Oak gave Harry a shiny stone to evolve Togetic to Togekiss, Harry got to evolve Hedwig and prof Oak got to record the evolution of a rare pokemon. While visiting the coral Harry met prof Oak grandson, Blue Oak and his rival Red Ketchum. Harry liked Red but Blue reminded him a bit of Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>Finally, the exam for the trainer’s license was conducted and as Harry expected he passed with the top rank followed by Blue Oak, Red Ketchum and a girl Green were the only others who passed the exam. As expected Gary threw a temper tantrum when he saw that he wasn’t on top but it was of no use, the four trainers who passed were allowed to pick a starter pokemon and pokedex from prof Oak.</p>
