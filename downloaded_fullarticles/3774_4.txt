is acceptable?”</p><p>“Absolutely”</p><p>“For Merlin’s sake, I’m not naming our baby something that ridiculous. I know you want to follow the family tradition, so please, find another name”.</p><p>“Fine, what about Orion?”</p><p>“No, it reminds me of an onion”.</p><p>“Scorpius, then?”</p><p>“Scorpius?”</p><p>“Yes, that’s what I said”.</p><p>“Alright then, any idea on what we should have for the middle name?”</p><p>“Scorpius Draconian Malfoy?”</p><p>“That’s a name and a half, Draco. Something shorter?”</p><p>“It’s a whole lot better than anything Potter named his kids”.</p><p>“Besides the point, what about just Draco?”</p><p>“No, it’s too close to my name.”</p><p>“Edward then?”</p><p>“Scorpius Edward Malfoy, it has a nice ring to it.”</p></div>
