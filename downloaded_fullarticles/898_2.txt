    <p>Bella loves me best in the dark, when shadows grow thick enough that she cannot see me and, more importantly, I cannot see her. Rustles of the leaves, creaks of the bed, moans and grunts. The noises mingle into a gentle cacophony, the lullaby that Bella needs to fall asleep. Even so, she tosses in the grips of Morpheus and claws at the sheets as if she needs desperate saving.</p><p>When she wakes, she does so in the manner of a disoriented prisoner, scratching at her wrists with the sharpened tips of her nails, frantic to undo chains she alone can see. It is only when she has drawn blood does she fall back with a sliver of relief. For a moment, she forgets that it will simply start all over again the next time she sleeps. For a moment, I can almost believe my elder sister is perfectly sane.</p>
