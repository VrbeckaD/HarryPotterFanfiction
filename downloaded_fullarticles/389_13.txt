    <p>The parchment fell from his hand and landed with a quiet thud on the brocade window seat. The sharp ink-stained corner catching against the threads before toppling to the floor. Scorpius slid to the floor and reached out for the parchment, only to rub his face and lean back, his hands falling to his lap. He turned to glance at the letter. How many years? Five? Eight? An empty laugh slipped from his lips. Sixteen. Sixteen years since James had sent him the letter with detailed reasoning as to why Gryffindor was going to beat Slytherin for the Quidditch Cup. With a small note at the bottom inviting Scorpius to join him the following night on the quidditch pitch. To try and settle once and for all who was fastest on a broom. The parchment had been folded and unfolded so often that the tears along each crease had threatened to destroy the letter. Scorpius picked up the letter, folded it, and let his fingers linger on the faded remnants of the wax seal James used when he was feeling particularly pretentious. Scorpius put the letter back in the box which he had managed not to look at for a year. A personal best. He sniffed, took a deep breath, and wondered how much of him was stuck in that box.</p>
<p>He knew James wasn't at graduation for him. James was there to see his brother graduate, to cheer on Albus, no matter how much grief he gave him for being in Slytherin. When James caught sight of Scorpius, there had been the reflexive beginning of a smile, before his expression was clouded by a poor attempt at self-control. Scorpius turned back to his parents and sister, and whilst his father and Cassiopeia made no suggestion of seeing anything awry, his mother's eyebrows arched by the smallest fraction. When the thud of footsteps running across the dry grass made him look up, his mother's smile was all he needed to know that she wasn't fooled by any of this. She was a Gryffindor in a family of Slytherins and Scorpius knew she could see what his father couldn't. Or wouldn't. Albus skidded to a halt beside Scorpius and flung his arm around Scorpius's shoulders. Scorpius's father was happy to welcome Albus, even if he was a Potter, because Scorpius had no plans to marry Albus. Scorpius glanced at his father and wondered if he knew how much it had cost him to send the letter to James. The letter which tore everything apart. The letter which ended everything. A letter shouldn't have had that much power. And Scorpius knew then that his mood was clear because Albus dragged him away from his family, and his mother silenced his father with a glance.</p>
<p>Albus barely said a word about Scorpius ending his relationship with James. He didn't need to. They had been friends since they were sorted into Slytherin together. Everything their fathers had told them about the other's family quickly dismissed in favour of a friendship which their mothers had reassured them would always be welcome. Albus's mother had only the qualification that if he was going to be friends with a Malfoy, he would have to keep up the family reputation for winning at quidditch. When they had both been sorted into Slytherin, his mother had written to say he was to be the best team mate he could. Scorpius's mother had told him that she had been best friends with Harry Potter since their first year and that Scorpius's father was talking nonsense. Yet for all Scorpius's mother ever said about the rivalry between his father and Harry Potter being a thing of the past, Scorpius was his father's son, and in the end did what his father had done to him, and sent a letter saying it couldn't carry on. Scorpius hadn't heard the argument between his parents the night after his graduation. The Silencing Charm on the study created an unnatural silence in the Manor. He sat on the stairs with Cassiopeia and they exchanged glances as the evening wore on, until their mother stormed out of the study and they did their best to scramble back up the stairs without being noticed. Hermione had come upstairs to where her children were hiding in the smaller library. She joined them on the large sofa which they weren't meant to have their feet on and had thus both curled up on with their feet up. She stroked Scorpius's hair and tried to take in the boy who was now a man. Who had done as his father requested. Who was trying to be a good son.</p>
<p>Scorpius dragged himself up from the floor and took the box over to his closet. There was a drawer near the back which lay open and he put the box inside. The drawer closed, he tried to tell himself he didn't need to use charms to keep the box safe. Letters. Just letters. And James's Gryffindor scarf. And the Chocolate Frog card from a Chocolate Frog James found in his robes when they ended up not revising in the Hogwarts library on Valentine's Day. The Chocolate Frog which was definitely not a Valentine's Day gift. Scorpius swore, put charms on the drawer, and changed into the robes he knew he would be expected to wear for the trip into Diagon Alley. Not formal robes but cut well enough to make sure no one doubted he was a Malfoy. He left his bedroom with a backward glance at the closet. This was why he didn't come home often. And now, not only was he home, he was being dragged into Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>His parents and Cassiopeia were waiting in the parlour and he groaned when he saw the satchel his father was carrying. He had been warned there was a visit to Gringotts awaiting him but this was one involving papers. Lots of papers. </p>
<p>"Ready, darling?" said Hermione, standing up and crossing the room to adjust Scorpius's robes though he knew they were on perfectly.</p>
<p>"No," said Scorpius.</p>
<p>"We've been delaying this for months, Scorp," said Draco. He looked in the satchel, nodding at whatever he saw inside before closing it again. "And I see no reason to keep putting it off. You're home, we might as well get it over with."</p>
<p>"Then let me sign the papers here," said Scorpius.</p>
<p>"Let me sign them," said Cassiopeia, shrugging. "I can forge his signature perfectly."</p>
<p>"I don't want to know why you learnt that," said Hermione, frowning at her daughter before turning back to Scorpius. "Scorp, it isn't just signing the papers, there's the process of being formally introduced to Gringotts as a Malfoy with the prospect of one day having control over the vaults." She stroked his cheek. "You can do this, darling."</p>
<p>"He's going to be there, isn't he?" said Scorpius, quietly.</p>
<p>Hermione nodded, and Cassiopeia looked round at her brother, surprised at the acknowledgement of James. Not even a name but him nonetheless. She had seen her brother go on dates from time to time, usually at the urging of their father who disliked that Scorpius remained unmarried. It was no wonder that Scorpius spent so much time out of the country. It was a point of contention between their parents that their mother knew where Scorpius would go but their father didn't. The unwritten rule that talk of marriage and men stayed in England meant Scorpius knew where he didn't want to be.</p>
<p>"And why would that matter?" said Draco. He crossed the room and took the jar of Floo Powder down from the mantelpiece. "That ended years ago, didn't it, Scorp?"</p>
<p>"It sure did, dad," said Scorpius.</p>
<p>Walking through Diagon Alley was an exercise in patience which Scorpius had no time for. Every few feet there would be someone his parents needed to stop and talk with. Cassiopeia could be the simpering Malfoy with ease, smiling and sweet while Scorpius stood by his father, nodding as necessary, occasionally shaking the hand of his parents' old friends or associates. Then, with a lack of decorum which made his mother shriek with delight, someone shouted Scorpius's name. He turned in time to see Albus running towards him. It had only been a month, but he met his friend's embrace as though it had been years since they'd last seen each other. They swayed on the spot for a moment before breaking apart. </p>
<p>"Albus," said Hermione, sweeping him into a hug and kissing him on the cheek. "It's so good to see you."</p>
<p>"You too, Mrs Malfoy," said Albus, stepping back and shaking Draco's proffered hand. "Mum and dad are around here somewhere."</p>
<p>"We've got business at Gringotts," said Hermione, "but maybe we'll see them later."</p>
<p>"Gringotts?" said Albus, glancing at Scorpius, whose attention was on the cobbled street. "You know - "</p>
<p>"Everyone knows," said Cassiopeia. "But we're pretending everything's fine because - "</p>
<p>"Shut it, Cass," said Scorpius. He missed the look his parents exchanged. "I'll owl you later, Albus?"</p>
<p>"Sure," said Albus. "I was just going to visit Uncle Fred and Uncle George."</p>
<p>"No," said Hermione, looking at Cassiopeia. "You're staying with us, this is family business."</p>
<p>With promises that he would definitely owl Albus by the day's end, Scorpius followed his parents and sister towards Gringotts. They were on the steps when his mother paused and held out her arm. Without thinking, he did what was ingrained in him by virtue of being a Malfoy, and took her hand. His father went ahead with Cassiopeia who knew exactly what was expected of her and nonetheless walked up the marble stairs herself.</p>
<p>"You can do this," murmured Hermione. Scorpius gave a small nod in response and kept his gaze on the doors of Gringotts. Hermione sighed and looked at Draco. Like father, like son. Doing their duty appeared to be a habit of Malfoy men. She glanced at her daughter who appeared to be taking well to the habits of Malfoy women and doing what she wanted.</p>
<p>Inside the main hall of Gringotts, staff were waiting for the family. Even if they hadn't been there by appointment, it would have taken precious few seconds longer for there to be a party awaiting them and their needs. Draco glanced back at Hermione, and for a brief moment, their smiles came with the ease of remembering arguments that went long into the night about wizarding rules. Arguments had while they had tumblers of Firewhisky in hand and clothes spread on the floor around them. The argument the night before hadn't been a blazing row. There had been no shouting. Simply a debate about Gringotts vaults and signatures. A debate which they both knew was about whether or not it was fair to drag Scorpius to the place where James was working. Where they would be forced to talk to each other. Managing the vaults was a Malfoy responsibility and Draco was determined that Scorpius do his duty. </p>
<p>As a member of staff led the family through corridors of marble, where gilt had been used with abandon, dread began to work its way through Scorpius. He rolled his shoulders and Hermione glanced at him.</p>
<p>The clunk of a heavy oak door against stone reverberated through the corridor and a voice Scorpius hadn't heard for fifteen years said, "Hello, Mr Malfoy." </p>
<p>Scorpius stared at James. He knew it was him. There was no doubting who the man was. And still he was different. Years of work abroad before coming back to England. Scorpius hadn't been immune to gossip. Albus didn't confirm news. They somehow always managed to dance around any mention of James. Though on the occasions of seeing Lily, she was obliged through being the youngest to blurt out information she thought he should know. It didn't matter. James didn't even stay in photos when Scorpius looked at them. The message had come through loud and clear. James's ambitions were fulfilled over the years, over seas, over the need to be anywhere near him. As if he was the reason James had left. </p>
<p>James and Draco shook hands as Draco introduced Cassiopeia.</p>
<p>"Mrs Malfoy," said James, holding out his hand. Hermione squeezed Scorpius's arm and let go to shake James's hand.</p>
<p>"James," said Hermione. "Thank you for seeing us."</p>
<p>"Mrs Malfoy," said James, still not looking at Scorpius, "it's a pleasure, and we both know my father wouldn't let me get away with delaying an appointment."</p>
<p>"Hush," said Hermione, "we both know your father barely knows how to keep an appointment." James laughed and Hermione leaned in to kiss him on the cheek. "But enough now, we can catch up on family later, you know we're here because of Scorpius."</p>
<p>James stiffened but maintained his smile and turned to look at Scorpius. He held out his hand without hesitation. Scorpius was determined that he wouldn't be the one to falter and he took James's hand. Calloused fingers gripped his hand for enough seconds that no one could say he was eager to let go or holding on for too long. They let go, giving up their hold, but not before Scorpius said, "Hello."</p>
<p>"Hello," said James. "So everyone's here because of you?"</p>
<p>"It's his legacy," said Draco. "Come on, Scorpius, we've got a lot to get through with James."</p>
<p>"We'll take the time we need to," said Hermione. "James, thank you again for this." </p>
<p>James smiled at Hermione, his attention drifting from Scorpius with apparent ease.</p>
<p>"Legacy," muttered Cassiopeia. She rolled her eyes and, arms crossed, bounced the toe of her boots against the marble floor. Draco coughed and Cassiopeia sighed before adjusting her posture.</p>
<p>"If you will follow me we can get started," said James, turning back towards the open doorway behind them. </p>
<p>Two hours of paperwork later, Hermione could tell Cassiopeia was contemplating how much she really valued her inheritance. Scorpius had adopted the facade when faced with friends of his father's who he was required to listen to over long dinner parties or dance with at balls. Hermione watched James and saw his expression almost a mirror of Harry's when he was trying, and failing, to do what Draco had perfected as a child. What Scorpius was doing as they sat at the large table which was inlaid with gold patterns that moved around the edge like a slow moving river.</p>
<p>The arguments between Hermione and Draco had lessened over the years. He was clear, Scorpius could marry whoever he wanted, so long as he didn't marry a Potter. Hermione's cries of Draco indulging a childhood rivalry had been met with the response that James wasn't good enough. And Draco was quick to bring up that Hermione couldn't argue that his problem was about money or marrying Purebloods. Draco considered himself to be protecting Scorpius. After all, James had let go of Scorpius with ease. It wasn't as if James had fought for him. Draco and Hermione looked at each other as Scorpius and James had their heads bowed over a particularly fierce piece of paperwork. Cassiopeia saw her father nod towards her brother and James. Saw her mother sigh and give the slightest shake of her head. </p>
<p>The words between Scorpius and James remained polite, as if they were strangers who had mutual friends. A strange tension of another lifetime in the past but not far enough away. The parchment was pushed across the table and they sat up. Scorpius rubbed the bridge of his nose.</p>
<p>"It's a matter of formalities," said James, "but I need to take Scorpius down to the vaults." He stood up and glanced at the papers, his fingers lingering on the parchment for a moment before looking up. "Who wants to join us?"</p>
<p>"Not me," said Cassiopeia. "And we all know mum won't go."</p>
<p>"Because your father and I aren't going to leave you to your own devices in Gringotts," said Hermione.</p>
<p>Draco walked around to where Hermione sat, and his hand on the back of the chair, leaned down to kiss her. "Nice try," he murmured, then kissed her again. "All these years and your mother still can't cope with the carts."</p>
<p>"Away with you," said Hermione, laughing as she took Scorpius's hand before he was out of reach. He turned back and his mouth pulled up in a small smile as she squeezed his hand. She held on a moment longer, her thumb stroking his hand. "Be careful."</p>
<p>Scorpius followed his father and James down winding corridors which became gradually less grand until they were in the sloping passageways which led to the carts. He tuned out the discussion his father was having with James except for the moments when he was obliged to agree or disagree. A goblin joined them, seemingly without being summoned, and minutes later they were in a cart. Draco crossed his arms and appeared unfazed by the bumpy ride. Malfoy tradition dictated that children go on trips to the vaults as soon as they were old enough. Scorpius knew his mother hadn't had the same introduction to Gringotts and subsequently managed to find herself busy on most occasions when a trip was deemed necessary. As the cart rattled along, Scorpius found himself smiling, his mother didn't like the carts but she had flown a dragon out of the bank. The carts weren't the same as flying, and still there was a thrill from the speed of the ride. Scorpius swallowed and glanced at James. How often had they gone flying together? Easy rides above the Forbidden Forest. Practice sessions which their captains always chastised them for. Matches against each other. </p>
<p>The cart slammed to a halt and taken off guard, Scorpius grabbed the side of the cart. The only light around them was from torches which lined the ragged walls. Still he looked up, as if he might see the stars in the darkness above them, but there was only the flickering of distant torches lit for other vaults.</p>
<p>"Scorp?" said Draco. "Come on."</p>
<p>Scorpius huffed and got out of the cart, swearing when he caught his foot on a piece of loose stone and stumbling against -</p>
<p>James grabbed Scorpius's arm, and his grip tight, he pushed Scorpius away and let go. Draco patted Scorpius on the back. James looked as if he was about to speak but he turned away and Scorpius followed James along the narrow path he remembered well as the route to the Malfoy vaults.</p>
<p>They stood surrounded by stacks of Galleons and gold. Scorpius caught sight of pieces of jewellery which had been flung in without being properly put away. He was sure he saw pieces which hadn't been moved since he was a child. Each vault was the same with glittering piles of family treasures. Each witnessed the same speech which James was obliged to give and which Scorpius was obliged to say he understood. And then they were walking back through narrow passageways carved out of stone to get back to the cart.</p>
<p>Draco and James talked easily about Gringotts while they walked and Scorpius watched James's body moving beneath his robes. There was no one to watch him stare and in the strange moment of being together again, he let himself have this. He let himself watch, each footstep another moment gone. The scripted conversation between himself and James shouldn't have held any weight, yet James didn't shy away from watching Scorpius. James knew his speech. The parchment in his hand going unused. Scorpius had needed his father's prompting in his responses. </p>
<p>"That wasn't so bad, was it?" said Draco, when they were back in the cart. Scorpius shook his head and slumped back. Draco tapped Scorpius's leg and Scorpius sat up straight. "I remember your grandfather taking me."</p>
<p>"Why didn't he come?" said Scorpius, unable to stop himself asking.</p>
<p>"Because you're meant to enjoy the father and son experience," said Draco. "You can go see your grandfather later."</p>
<p>"Right," said Scorpius. He glanced at James who was sitting in front of them with the goblin. James was bent over towards the goblin, nodding as the goblin spoke to him in a low voice.</p>
<p>The rest of the cart ride passed with Scorpius staring at the stone passageways and seeing the scars on the stone of his mother's exploits with a dragon which she had pointed out on the rare occasions she had joined them for trips to the vaults. He missed his father watching him when he glanced up at James.</p>
<p>"Still alive?" said Cassiopeia, lounging in her chair, and looking up when she heard the return of her father, Scorpius, and James. "No dragons get in your way?"</p>
<p>Hermione sighed and glanced up at Draco and Scorpius. "Everything go well?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly," said Draco, standing behind Hermione's chair and putting his hands on her shoulders, "and no, there were no dragons in our way." Hermione looked up at him and smiled. Scorpius watched his parents happy together. His mother reaching up to touch his father's hand. He forced his gaze to the papers on the table, the swirls of gold easing around them on the table beneath, only to see the calloused hand which had shaken his put papers down.</p>
<p>"Mrs Malfoy," said James, "your exploits are legend here at Gringotts." At her arched brow he coughed then grinned "And at home."</p>
<p>"I'm surprised they still let me in," said Hermione, laughing gently at the memories she had come to find some comfort in recalling. "We met Albus on our way here, James, he said your parents were around?"</p>
<p>"They mentioned they'd be around today," said James. "As to where - "</p>
<p>"Does this small talk mean we're done here?" said Cassiopeia, tapping her wand on her knee.</p>
<p>"Ever the lady," said Draco. "Yes, we're done for now."</p>
<p>"Excellent," said Cassiopeia, jumping up from her seat. There was a ripple of laughter around the room. Even Scorpius gave a grudging laugh as his sister's delight made no attempts at being polite. "Flourish and Blotts, here we come."</p>
<p>"Let me walk you out," said James, holding out his hand to Hermione.</p>
<p>"You didn't learn that from your father, did you," said Hermione. Draco snorted and James's mouth twisted in a grin.</p>
<p>James led the family back through the marble corridors to the entrance of Gringotts. Scorpius glanced at the portraits of notable wizards and witches lining the walls, noting a handful of ancestors. The main hall had become busier since they arrived and James took them out to the marble steps at the entrance of the bank. Scorpius stood back as James spoke to his parents. Then James held out his hand to Cassiopeia. She was still bouncing in delight that they were done with the Gringotts visit and when she took James's hand, she made to curtsy, laughing as she stepped back. Then James let go, Cassiopeia lost her footing, and she began to fall down the marble steps.</p>
