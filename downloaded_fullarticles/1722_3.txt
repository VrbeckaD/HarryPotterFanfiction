          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry says “I love you” before he stops calling Draco “Malfoy”. He immediately clamps his hands over his mouth. </p><p>They’d been curled up on the sofa, the radio on softly in the background, the Weird Sisters voices’ swirling through the air. </p><p>He expects the man to recoil, to get up and leave. They aren’t there yet, are they? Would they ever be?</p><p>Draco stares for a second, “Okay.” Then Harry feels Draco’s knuckles on his. He exhales on a breath he doesn’t even know he’s holding.</p><p>***</p><p>They’d been dancing around each other for months. </p><p>Draco draws a breath, short and sharp, and when Potter says “I love you” for the first time Draco just nods stoically. He swallows, but his jaw relaxes too. He sits back in his chair. Potter’s hands are fidgeting on his lap and Draco’s mouth goes suddenly dry. </p><p>“Okay.” Draco says finally. He feels like a pillock. But it’s how it has to be. He can’t say it. The time isn’t right.</p><p>That doesn’t matter though. It all fades away when he lifts his hand, seeking the familiar warmth of the body inching back down the sofa. He places his hand over Potter’s knuckles, brushing the rough skin with the back of his hand.</p><p>“Okay.” Draco says again a slight defiance in his voice. He swears Potter relaxes under his touch. Melting into the inevitable comfort Draco’s couch has provided for the last eight months. Draco snorts quietly. </p><p>“What?” Potter looks bonded to the sofa, as if a thousand winds won’t move him. </p><p>“Nothing, I’m going to bed… you can join me when you’ve stopped trying to conjoin yourself with my sofa”.</p><p>The stubble on the mans tan face is darker than it was last week. It doesn’t stop Draco from catching the smile playing at his lips as he buries himself deeper into the soft fabric. </p><p>“You’re going to have to levitate me up to the bedroom”. He jokes. </p><p>Draco rolls his eyes, instead holding his hands out impatiently while Harry ponders on taking them. He won’t admit it out loud, but he just loves the feel of Harry’s skin. </p><p>Draco’s love language is just different from Harry’s. But Harry doesn’t mind at all. </p><p>***</p><p>The Weird Sisters play at their wedding. </p><p>Harry pulls Draco close on the dance floor. Draco leans into the crook of Harry’s neck. He sways to the music, letting it carry him through the next few beats of his erratic heart. The time is never going to truly be right, he decides. </p><p>“I love you too.”</p></div>
