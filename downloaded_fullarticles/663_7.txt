  <b>January 2002</b>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“To Tokyo, please. Just me and two trunks.” Harry surprised himself a little bit when he ordered his portkey ticket at the desk. He’d actually planned to ask for the soonest available portkey, just needing to get out of London, away from all the pitying looks from friends, family and even his colleagues. Tokyo wasn’t exactly a bad choice though, he shrugged, remembering his first time in the city, a little under two years ago already, as the last extended period of time he’d been truly happy. “Well shit,” he muttered, suddenly realising that two years is a rather long time to feel unhappy.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The witch sitting behind the desk eyed him warily as she tapped the screen in front of her with her wand a couple of times to make the machine behind her spit out a ticket and two slips of parchment to stick on his trunks. “Anything else, mister Potter?” Her tone was polite but the look in her eyes told him she’d read every single article Skeeter’s written about him over the last couple of years. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His smile felt a bit strained, but he figured he could get away with that as it was only 5 in the morning. “That’ll be all, thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <b>May 2001</b>
</p><p>
  <span>The house was unusually quiet when Harry woke up. Ginny’d been having trouble sleeping since a few months, so he didn’t find it weird to wake up alone in their bed, even when her side of the bed was cold, indicating it had been hours since she’d been in it. She’d lain on her side of the bed, staring up at the ceiling when he’d snuck into their bedroom last night, not even bothering to pretend to be asleep when he’d crawled in, but not moving to cuddle him either. It’d been a long time since they'd cuddled before going to sleep, and even longer since they'd fallen asleep tangled in each other's arms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But even though things weren’t exactly well between them, when Harry woke up in the morning, the smell of Ginny's coffee would have made its way upstairs, and as soon as he stepped out onto the landing, he'd hear the murmur of the morning show on her favourite wireless station. He'd find her in the kitchen and they'd swap a good morning kiss. It would almost feel as if everything was okay. </span>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>This morning, the house still smelled of the dinner Kreacher had whipped up when he got home the night before, and there was no sound to be heard. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kitchen was dark, Kreacher apparently not around and Ginny nowhere to be found. He glanced around, feeling a bit disoriented in the silence and noticed a note next to the kettle, a half full glass of their strongest firewhiskey leaving a ring on the upper left corner of the parchment, as if Ginny had needed the liquid courage before writing it. </span>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I'm sorry that I left too late. I didn't want to say goodbye. I always have and always will love you, but I have to go before it hurts us both even more. Please don’t ask me why, I don’t have all the answers either. I'm sorry. X Ginny”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Being a Monday, Harry was due back at the castle in a little under an hour, so while everything felt like it was crumbling around him, while he himself felt like crumbling down, he swallowed the lump in his throat and went on with his morning as usual. Two cups of strong tea and a bowl of cereal in a semi-dark kitchen in order not to alarm Kreacher or give him the idea that he was needed, and then he was on his way. </span>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good morning professor!” Harry was greeted by one of his third year Gryffindor students, smiling cheerily as she walked out onto the grounds to catch some of the early morning sun before the lessons started. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Morning Helen,” he replied distractedly, walking up to his room to grab his lesson plans before heading to the defence classroom. He considered himself lucky to have planned a lot of practical exercises for the upcoming week, wanting his students to revise properly before their exams. After all, he still believed that the only way to properly learn how to defend yourself is by doing it. Preferably after gaining a solid theoretical basis, he’d admit that much, but still. No textbook had ever taught him how to cast a dementor. </span>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>**</span>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>At noon, Harry wrapped up the quite rowdy practice session of his sixth years, answering a couple of questions from his students before sending them down to the Great Hall for lunch and following suit himself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a buzz around the hall when he walked in, students talking and joking amongst each other now that the stress for their exams wasn’t at its peak yet, the sun blazing in the pale blue sky only adding to their cheer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sighed as he sank down in his usual seat at the head table, between Hermione and Hagrid’s empty seat. Hagrid usually skipped lunch these days as he was always too busy taking care of the newborn ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>secret creatures</span>
  </em>
  <span>’ as long as the sun was up. Harry had long since given up trying to find out what these ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>secret creatures</span>
  </em>
  <span>’ were, reasoning that McGonagall at least couldn’t hold him responsible if he didn’t know of it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione turned around from her conversation with professor Babbling, looking surprised to find him there. “Harry! You’re here!? I figured you would’ve uhm…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Called in sick?” Harry supplied, only barely suppressing an eye roll at her poor attempt at subtlety.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well. Yeah. Ron said… Well. Err.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She left. Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh Harry…” the pity in her eyes was pretty much unbearable. Harry felt grateful that they were here, in front of all of their students and therefore unable to express more than a few words of pity.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s… It’s fine, Hermione, just… can we please not talk about it?” he gritted out, loading his plate with spring rolls and fried rice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded, sadness and worry lacing her gaze as she turned back to her plate and her earlier interrupted conversation with the ancient runes-professor on her other side. </span>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>She tried to corner him a couple more times over the week, wanting him to talk about it, but Harry had never been a talker so he avoided her as well as he could. Instead, he went out to Hogsmeade, met George for pints once (the lovely man never even mentioned Ginny) and tried flying as a means of coping. Sometimes he just needed the quiet and the fresh air he only got when he was high up, preferably chasing a snitch but even without the purpose, he felt like it calmed him down a bit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>April 1999</b>
</p><p>
  <span>“See you tomorrow Harry, can’t stay for pints today. Hermione said she has a surprise for me,” Ron wiggled his eyebrows tellingly as he headed out of the locker room. Harry waved half-heartedly, not wanting to think about the kind of surprises Hermione had for Ron these days and tilted his head back under the hot spray of the shower. Their training had been rough and very physical today, yet Harry was not only trying to wash away the sweat, but also the thoughts that kept niggling at the back of his mind. It’d been a couple of months ago when he first started to doubt if auror training was really what he was supposed to do with his life. Well, it had always been what he was </span>
  <em>
    <span>supposed</span>
  </em>
  <span> to do, of course. Everyone had always expected it from him, and he’d just followed their lead, enrolling in auror training because obviously defence was something he was at least reasonably good at.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And he was, really, it wasn’t like he was struggling, not even that the theoretical lessons were too hard or anything. Yet somehow, it didn’t feel </span>
  <em>
    <span>right. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Not anymore. He felt like an unguided missile on the way to destruction. Destruction of himself or of someone else, he wasn’t sure.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He’d tried talking about it with Ginny, of course, but their time together was sparse, with her finishing seventh year and only being allowed to Hogsmeade in the weekends. If she wasn’t buried under coursework in preparation of her NEWTS or playing Quidditch in front of countless scouts who’d caught wind of the Weasley girl who flew like she was born on a broomstick.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The holidays had been spent at The Burrow, where everyone kept praising him and Ron for becoming aurors because it helped ease their pain over Fred’s death. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>All that together had resulted in Harry clamming up, like he’d done so often before. Usually, Ron and Hermione would pick up on it and get him out of his funk somehow. But this time, even they were too busy with themselves and their new adult life to notice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>**</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ginny had gone home to The Burrow for Easter, and while Harry knew he was welcome there (and had been told repeatedly by Molly in case he wasn’t sure), he’d told the Weasleys  he needed some peace and quiet after a couple of rough weeks in training. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He found himself alone at Grimmauld place, no training to distract him from his thoughts and only Kreacher around to cater to his needs. He’d learned to let the elf take care of him by now, finding out the hard way that not doing so would only make it worse as he would get offended and start messing up his household on purpose. Besides, it was a fact that Kreacher had been a great help in removing all pests from the house, as well as moving the giant portrait from the hallway to the attic, where Harry could still hear Sirius’ mother screech about filthy bloodtraitors sometimes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Other than that, the house felt silent and empty. He often told himself things would get better when Ginny moved in but the truth was he didn’t bother to decorate it, make himself at home, wasn’t even sure where to start. Especially when he hardly was home for anything else than sleeping.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In fact, the last time he’d felt at home…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was as if a light bulb lit up inside his head when he thought of it. Hogwarts. He scrambled to his feet and almost ran from the kitchen where he was drinking yet another cup of tea to his makeshift office. He quickly grabbed a quill and a piece of parchment and scribbled out a note before rolling it up and tying it to Eleanor’s leg. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He’d gotten the bright white snow owl at the magical pets shelter shortly after returning from Hogwarts and she’d proven to be a trustworthy courier as well as an easy pet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After sending her off, he went back to the novel he’d been reading earlier, suddenly finding it a lot easier to focus on the story. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eleanor was a bit slow and lazy sometimes,  so he wasn’t expecting her back yet when she sat waiting for him on the kitchen table when he came downstairs the next morning, a scroll of parchment tied to her leg once more. He took it off, distractedly throwing an owl treat her way while skimming over the lines.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Dear mister Potter, Harry,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>You are most welcome to have a chat about the options we might have at Hogwarts for you. Without further notice, I’ll be expecting you next Wednesday at 11am. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Kind regards,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Minerva McGonagall. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>From then on, things went quickly. A thorough conversation in McGonagall’s office on Wednesday, handing in his resignation with Robards on Thursday and facing his friends - and girlfriend - about it on Friday. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny was angry at first, but not as much as Ron had been. As Harry’s best mate, he felt left out because of Harry not telling anyone about his plans beforehand, and left behind since Harry would leave their training at the end of June.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione, she seemed to understand though. She just nodded and smiled, hugging him close before getting back into the floo. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knew Ron would come around eventually, probably after a long talking to by Hermione, but maybe Ginny’s quick forgiveness was what worried him the most. He was sure Hermione wouldn’t be as forgiving if Ron hadn’t told her about what was on his mind if it concerned such life altering decisions. He shrugged it off as having to do with her being preoccupied by the NEWTS and talent scouts, not wanting to divulge in it too much.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>July 1999</b>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mister Potter, how nice of you to join us again,” Harry had to consciously stop himself from flinching at the familiar sound of Snape’s voice. Even from his portrait at McGonagall’s office he sneered at him, dead or not. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Professor,” he greeted stiffly, nodding almost unnoticably at the man he’d hated so much. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry, sit down please, while Severus and I explain what curriculum we’ve drawn up for you,” the headmistress interfered, taking a seat before raising an eyebrow at professor Snape. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took them the larger part of an hour, explaining how the last half of this year would be spent at Hogwarts, learning about the didactics needed for teaching (Harry didn’t comment on how Snape had obviously lacked them yet had always been allowed to teach) and brushing up his theoretical knowledge of defence. After that, he’d be sent off to Japan to get tutored by a famous defence wizard and then, after another two months of supervision of Snape, he’d finally become a Hogwarts professor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It all sounded rather exciting, if he ignored the fact that he’d spend the next two months mostly alone with Snape at the castle, with all of the students and the professors gone for the summer holidays. Luckily professor Dumbledore had promised to keep an eye on them as well, though it seemed that he spent most of his days sleeping in his portrait that hung in his old office.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His arms laden with heavy books and scrolls of parchment he was ordered to read by next week, Harry picked his way through the castle, up to his very own quarters. Apparently he shared the hallway with Isabella Brant, the new potions professor he’d briefly met during the fall semester when he and some other students had returned for a NEWT crash course. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>According to Ginny, who took potions on NEWT level, she was a young witch who’d studied at Ilvermorny but had British roots and wanted to come back. Isabella had also had the dubious honour of becoming the new Slytherin head of house, which probably did the house good since it’s reputation had been more than severely damaged after the War. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh! You must be Harry!” Isabella happily said as she caught the books that had fallen out of Harry’s arms at their collision. “Sorry, I didn’t see you coming, I’m usually the only one who wanders this corner of the castle.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was hard not to like the young woman instantly, her smile bright and her dark curls falling loosely around her face. She helped him open his door and put the books and scrolls inside before properly introducing herself and sharing important details like how to get the moving staircase leading towards their hallway to behave properly. It had taken him three wild turns of the staircase before he finally got to the proper landing just now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m only here for another week or so, getting my classroom back in order and finishing the inventory, but please, feel free to call on me if anything bothers you or when you want to know something. I’m still relatively new, of course, and you might actually know the castle better than I do, but I’m here if need be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, a lot, really,” Harry sighed, a small smile curving up his lips. “It’s all a bit… bizarre being here again. And with Snape being my mentor, well…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh yes, I get what you mean. He mentored me for the first couple of weeks as well,” she nodded, her dark eyes big, before she lowered her voice to a whisper. “I think he’s a bit creepy, to be honest.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry giggled at that, and all of a sudden he felt a knot in his chest loosen a little bit. At last, he was home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Isabella proved to be excellent company during his meals or at night when he’d had enough reading done to numb his mind. She was kind, funny and upbeat, pretty much the qualities he appreciated most in Ginny, and it made it easier not to hear much from his girlfriend while she had started practicing with the Holyhead Harpies just that week. It was no wonder it saddened him a bit when she finally announced her leave for the next day, although he was absolutely certain Snape wouldn’t give him much reprieve when his lessons started after the weekend. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After two months of lessons with Snape and meals on his own at his desk, it was quite a relief to be able to count down to the arrival of his colleagues in the morning, and then the students in the evening. At first sight, it was easy to say nothing had changed after the war, but the change was mostly in the little things. For example, before the sorting ceremony, McGonagall told everyone about the positive characteristics of each house, warning the students once more that bullying people about their sorted house was considered a serious offense and could lead to expulsion. The seventh years now had their own table as well, apart from the house tables in an attempt to encourage house-transcending friendships in the class that was about to leave the school. Harry had actually liked being there last year, even if the eighth year students were only about 20 and they all gravely felt the absence of some of their peers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What was weirdest for Harry, was definitely his seat at the head table. Granted, only in a corner of it, to make sure no one took him for an </span>
  <em>
    <span>actual</span>
  </em>
  <span> professor, but still. He was there, as Hagrid had extensively reminded him when he came back from his holiday in France. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The next four months were a bit of a blur, filled with private lessons from both Snape and McGonagall, sitting in on their lessons and a lot of reading to do at night. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Most of his weekends were spent in Holyhead, watching Ginny play and spending some alone time with her if they were lucky. But still, even if he was busier than ever, his head full of facts and figures, he felt ten times happier than he’d ever been at the ministry. There was never the slightest doubt that his career switch had been his best idea in months. </span>
