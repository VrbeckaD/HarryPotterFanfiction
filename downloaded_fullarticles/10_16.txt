    <p>"I am most happy to announce that a new member has joined our staff," Albus Dumbledore said during his speech at the opening feast. "Alfons Vereiha." He looked at the young man beside him at the head table.</p>
<p>The man stood up and nodded to the students before taking a seat again. The students applauded for him as he did so.</p>
<p>"He will be your second Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, sharing the post with Professor Quirrell. You remember him from your last year of course, except for the first-years." He now gestured at the other younger man at the other end of the table.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell didn't stand up though, he simply nodded with a shy expression on his face.</p>
<p>"Let's make our new teacher feel welcome in our school," Dumbledore continued enthusiastically. "Now, I'd like to remind you all of a few rules..."</p>
<p>The speech didn't go on for very long, and soon everybody could dig in the plentiful meal that was magiced up before them.</p>
<p>Many of the first-years kept looking around the hall, amazed, especially the muggleborns because they had never seen anything so magical before as the ceiling like the sky. Others, the older students occasionally looked up at the head table and at the new teacher that had been introduced to them. Even some of the teachers sent infrequent glances at the new staff member.</p>
<p>Minerva McGonagall, seated as always next to the Headmaster, tried not to catch anyone's attention as she tried to get a good look at her new colleague. That was not an easy task because Albus was seated between them and was currently speaking to the man. Still, after a while Dumbledore started a conversation with Quirrell, sitting on the other side of McGonagall, and the new teacher turned his attention to his food. McGonagall leaned back in her chair so that she could see the man behind the Headmaster.</p>
<p>He was tall and slender. His black and wine red robes complemented his muscular arms and strong body. His blonde hair was cut only a little shorter than Snape's, but it was certainly much cleaner. From between his hair she could see a small ruby earring. His perfect nose and his chin that was just a little pointed created a beautiful profile. He had pale blue eyes and dark thin lips. His skin was complitely white, even paler than Snape's if that was even possible. His long slender fingers had nails just a little longer than men usually do. His posture was high, his movements graceful.</p>
<p>Although Minerva would have never admitted it to anyone, this man was beautiful, to say the least.</p>
<p>She was sure nobody had noticed her eyeing the new teacher, but someone just had to notice in the last moment.</p>
<p>Alfons Vereiha looked up from his food, probably feeling someone's gaze on him, and looked at the older witch. Minerva was momentarily taken aback by the stirke of these pale blue eyes, and she felt just a little embarrassed of being caught watching someone. To her surprise, the young man smiled kindly at her before consentrating on the meal again.</p>
<p>McGonagall let out a quiet sigh she hadn't realized she was holding. The friendly look that Alfons had given her brought a warm feeling to her heart. They would become friends, she knew that.</p>
<p>"Judging our new colleague, are we?"</p>
<p>Snape's voice made her look away from the new acquaintance and at the arrogant Potions Master.</p>
<p>"Not judging, Severus," she answered, deciding not to act on Snape's nasty tone. "Merely studying a new acquaintance."</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The Feast was over and the students had left, the first-years being lead to their houses by the prefects. Minerva stood by the entrance of the Great Hall, watching the last lagged Hufflepuff third-year turn the corner towards his house's rooms.</p>
<p>"Professor McGonagall if I'm correct?" a man voice with a slight Northern European lilt said behind the Transfiguration Professor.</p>
<p>Minerva turned around in slight surprise, finding her facing Alfons Vereiha, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor. "Professor Vereiha," she addressed him with a kind smile.</p>
<p>"I have heard a lot about you from the Headmaster, it is an honour for me to finally meet you," Alfons said. His voice was soft and friendly. Minerva couldn't quite make out of what language that slight accent was. "I hope I didn't startle you," he added with, surprisingly, a slight amount of concern in his voice.</p>
<p>"Of course not," she replied. She didn't let him speak again, but instead said, "I do hope that you were not bothered with me watching you at the Feast."</p>
<p>"Definitely not. I believe it is normal for a person to study a new colleague and hopefully a new friend," Vereiha answered. That look with which he looked at Minerva was benign. "I really hope that we become friends during my time here."</p>
<p>"As do I," McGonagall answered, and as usual when meeting a new person, she offered out her hand to shake his. But instead he took her hand and delicately, very gently placed a kiss on her fingers. Minerva blushed slightly when she pulled her hand back to her.</p>
<p>For a long moment neither of them spoke. They just didn't know what to talk about as they knew so little of each other.</p>
<p>"So," McGonagall started finally. "Has Dumbledore already shown you your rooms?"</p>
<p>Alfons shook his head. "No, he said another new colleague of mine would."</p>
<p>Just as he had finished that, Professor Snape appeared form the Great Hall. "The colleague has arrived," he simply said. "If you would come with me, Professor Vereiha? Good night, Minerva." With that he turned around and began to walk down the hall in his usual fast pace, his long black cape billowing behind him.</p>
<p>"I must go now, Professor," Alfons said to Minerva hurriedly. "I hope to meet you again soon." He then turned and hurried after Severus who was already halfway down the hall.</p>
<p>"Good night," Minerva called quietly after him, watching the two of them go. The two black billowing cloaks, two tall men, one blonde and one dark-haired. She turned towards her own rooms only when they were already out of sight.</p>
<p>"Minerva! How fortunate that I saw you," Albus said when she met him in the next hallway. "Do you think you could come to my office for a cup of tea?"</p>
<p>Minerva sighed, "Gladly." It was just what she needed at the moment, a nice evening with a dear friend whom she knew what to expect from.</p>
