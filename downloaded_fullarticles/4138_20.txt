  <i>It wasn’t fair.</i>
</p><p>Heavy rain clouds rolled above Merope’s Orphanage and the shadows inside the building thickened. Energy thrummed in the air; storm static, excitement. Like dolls, thirty children lined up in the main hall beneath the crystal chandelier. They wore neat black robes fitted down to the centimeter, their hair combed, coiffed, nails buffed to shine. Nervous smiles passed between them. On this one day every month, all childish grudges were swept aside, the hope and insecurity mirrored in their friends and enemies too raw and similar to their own to poke at.</p><p>One boy was missing and everyone knew it. </p><p>Secreted away in the orphanage’s most isolated room, Harry felt the massive iron gates outside groan open. His heart sank. Lunging over to the window, he pressed his face to the summer-warmed glass. A collection of little black dots swanned over the flagstone path, into the rose gardens, to the front door... He could hear them laughing and chatting amongst themselves.</p><p>There were so many people today. Maybe if he snuck out, one of them might whisk him away before Mr Aenaes noticed.</p><p>It would have to be later. After the man had a few drinks.</p><p>Harry eased back onto his mattress. Pain flowered where bruises met hard springs and scruffy edges. Suddenly the backs of his eyes felt crowded and loathing curled low in his gut, heart so full of venom it was hard to breathe. He tried studying the peeling wallpaper, the lopsided furniture, but the sight only made him more upset.</p><p>He startled when a key jammed into the door. Lock clicking open.</p><p>Soles clacked ominously against hardwood, slow, until shiny leather shoes rested within Harry’s down-turned view. A light, bony hand fell to his shoulder. Mr Aenaes crouched, so that they might see eye-to-eye. Harry hated the man’s eyes. Oh, they shined like everyone else’s, but there was a storm in them, different, <i>darker</i>, than the storm inside Harry, and Mr Aenaes was drowning. </p><p>“Why're <i>you</i> here?” asked Harry rudely. “They all just arrived, haven't they? Don’t you have work to do?”</p><p>“I understand you’re upset with me, Harry,” said the older man with an oddly urgent undertone. “But when will you see that you don’t need them? You already have me. This place is your true home. Yours and mine.”</p><p>Harry glowered at the floor.</p><p>A large hand dropped to Harry’s knee. Harry winced as a thumb brushed across the scrape an older boy had given him earlier. Harry wasn’t bullied very much. Others had it worse. But, Harry was what Mr Aenaes called ‘polarizing’. Most stayed out of his way. A few, mainly girls, liked to follow him around, giggling and bartering flower crowns for cheek kisses. Then there were older kids like Harfang Tripe who spat at him and called him Mudblood, shoved him in the hallways, took his things—</p><p>The crow’s feet around Mr Aenaes’s eyes deepened, and so did the finger on Harry’s cut. “Can you hear them? Downstairs? Your friends are all puffing out their chests, putting on a show like zoo animals, hoping for a father. I could’ve chosen any of them. But I picked you. Be grateful.” Caressing lips replaced Mr Aenaes’s thumb.</p><p>Harry’s throat went dry. This always seemed to happen when they were alone. Fatherly affection. What all dads did with their boys. Only days ago, Harry had kicked the man for reaching under his shirt, earning Harry a hard slap.</p><p>The silence between them hung like a threat.</p><p>Lightning struck in the distance.</p><p>“My, isn’t this one precious.” It was a woman’s voice, bored and honey-rough. She leaned against the entrance, tall and pale, wearing a slinky black dress, dark sunglasses, and holding the cane of a lacy black parasol. Diamonds glittered at her throat. Harry had never seen anyone so wondrous before. “Is this lovely kitten broken, is that why you’re hiding him away? How heroic of you. No need to fret. I’ll do you favor. Give me the boy.” </p><p>Mr Aenas stood upright. “Lady Chara! You’re mistaken. He’s not for adoption, he’s my son. Now, it seems you have lost your way, so allow me to escort you back to the Viewing.”</p><p>Lady Chara crossed her arms and ducked her head, her upper half trembling. She was laughing, Harry realized with no small amount of shock. No one ever laughed at Mr Aenaes.</p><p>“I’d say don’t make me laugh, but you already have.” Lady Chara elegantly separated herself from the door frame, gliding closer towards them. “Get out of my way.”</p><p>It all happened very fast.</p><p>Mr Aenaes grasped Lady Chara’s wrist—the woman whipped out a wand from nowhere, sending a blast which rumbled in Harry’s bones. Mr Aenaes crashed into the wall. The man didn't fall, staying there stuck to it. An angry flush crawled up the man’s neck. He yelled soundlessly.</p><p>Lady Chara crouched in front of Harry, but unlike with Mr Aenaes, that instinct to lash out and run didn't trigger. She pushed her sunglasses up so they nested in her long black hair, exposing high cheekbones and large eyes which were an impossible shade of violet. Beautiful wasn’t the word— <i>striking</i>. Harry would never forget her face. She cupped his cheek, thumb tracing his bottom lip. “Speak to me, child. What is your name?”</p><p>He swallowed uneasily. “Harry.”</p><p>“Surname?”</p><p>Harry shifted, hazarding a look at Mr Aenaes who was glaring at them both. “Kelsey.” Something about her changed; a tightening, a loosening, something—<i>mudblood, mudblood, mudblood</i>—and Harry couldn’t help but continue. <i>Don’t leave me here. </i></p><p>“The orphanage gave it to me. I dunno who my real parents are.”</p><p>Lady Chara’s gaze jumped slightly between his features, as if she couldn't decide whether to focus on his nose, his eyes, his mouth. “And how long have you been here, darling?”</p><p>“All my life.” Harry offered his most enchanting smile. The sort that made girls twirl daisies into his hair. “I’m eight.”</p><p>Red lips stretched into a grin. “Dropping by orphanages isn’t a habit of mine. Truthfully, I detest children. Yet… I hardly know how to describe it, some innate feeling I suppose, drew me here to this wretched place. Your silent pleas found my willing ears.”</p><p>“Do you have any idea how exquisite you are?” Lady Chara continued, brushing Harry’s fringe to the side. “Not quite veela… but that voice, the way you were able to call to me. There’s something dark in your blood. Your magic tastes delicate, alluring, but it’s a sorcerer’s magic. You must be a sort of half-breed. What luck have I, happening upon such a rare dove today.”</p><p>Harry couldn't help the blush. Everyone who called him a filthy mudblood, a nobody, was nothing compared to Lady Chara, and she seemed to quite like him. Maybe Harry wasn’t destined for greatness but he was at least better than the other boys and girls at the orphanage. He felt it in the way Harfang Tripe paused ever so slightly before knocking him down. And Lady Chara just confirmed it, hadn't she? He was somebody. Somebody special.</p><p>“No,” Mr Aenaes gasped like a wild animal. He had found his voice. “My employer… As soon as I’m free, I’m floo-calling him. He’s friendly with the Dark Lord! Take Harry! Take him if you want, but you’ll be running for the rest of your life.”</p><p>Like a serpent striking, Lady Chara lashed her wand and Mr Aenaes’s body split in two. The parasol opened. Blood and gore slid down the fabric, pooling at her feet. </p><p>Blood fell in sheets down the wall.</p><p>Harry shut his eyes but the image burnt into his mind. A dull thud resounded through room as what was left of the man landed landed.</p><p>No. He needed to watch this. He needed to remember.</p><p>Rising from her position, she prowled forwards. There was red. Red everywhere. Lady Chara stood in the middle of it, her black pointed boots sticky and slick. “You want to know a secret?” asked woman of the body. “Your vaunted employer, Old Man Burke? He works for me. He’s always worked for me.” And then, as letting go a secret: “I’m powerful, but so powerful as to tear through the enchantments placed by our very own Dark Lord to keep our children safe? You did have the bad habit of thinking far too highly of me.”</p><p>She kicked the severed head into the dresser.</p><p>“Such a gruesome sight.” These pleasure-curled words were addressed to Harry. “Loved ones are meant to shield their young from pictures like these, aren’t they? Well, my little nightingale, I’m no parent. And I don’t believe in innocence.” Lady Chara turned, slowly, to face him, blood flecking her skin and a slow smile on her lips. “This world isn’t a place of choices, it’s a place of power, and I think you know that as well as I. But I want to give you a choice—a <i>real</i> choice, not the illusion of one. Be as selfish as you can for a moment. Think only of yourself. Can you do that for me?”</p><p>Harry tentatively nodded. Lady Chara went on, “Two paths: the first... I send you to live with the Malfoys, who owe me a debt. They are an obnoxiously wealthy pureblood family of influence who will, once they warm up to you, love and spoil you endlessly. Send you off to Hogwarts on your eleventh birthday—” Harry’s eyes lit up and Lady Chara’s expression became sardonic “—and secure you both a proper wife and a well-paying job once you graduate. A privileged life. A good life.”</p><p>“Or?” she said. “You can come with me. There’s a good chance you’ll die before adulthood. There’s an even better one you’ll die penniless, unknown, and alone. It’s a brutal life. I’ll use you, I’ll take advantage of you, but I can promise you this: you <i>will</i> have power. Strength of your own.”</p><p>Harry’s thoughts raced. Even on the deepest level, he knew this was likely the most important choice he’d ever have to make. Small fingers played with the threadbare material of his sleeves. Getting adopted by a family, let alone one like the Malfoys had always been his greatest wish. And Hogwarts? The name of Britain’s premier magic school was his forbidden prayer, a dream he didn’t dare linger upon. He'd be a fool not to pick the first choice.</p><p>And yet, he felt as though he was caught in a fleeting moment. A rare flower on the wind. Lady Chara wasn't a thing people were meant to see, but Harry saw it. When he was older he could always get money, security, maybe even real friends. But if he let Lady Chara go, this was all over. Forever. That, he knew.</p><p>“I’ll go. With you.”</p><p>“You made the wrong choice,” she said as she pulled down her sunglasses. “But you know that. And it’s why you are officially now part of Ganymede. Welcome, little nightingale.”</p><p>She handed him the dripping parasol.</p>
