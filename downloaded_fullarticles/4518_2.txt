<p>Dressing for Dinner</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>It took a while for Harry to return to himself, and when he did he found Draco draped over him, face buried in the curve of Harry’s neck. </p>
<p>Slowly, Harry ran his hands over Draco’s back. </p>
<p>“Fuck,” Draco whispered. “I think you broke me.” </p>
<p>Harry laughed softly. “Well, I’m absolutely <i>sure</i> you broke me.” </p>
<p>“As long as the breaking was mutual,” Draco sighed, shifting off Harry to roll onto his back. “So, are you hungry?” </p>
<p>“I think—” Harry’s stomach chose that moment to rumble. He chuckled. “Apparently I am.” </p>
<p>“Lovely. Dinner it is.” Draco moaned. “Once I can stand up.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Wait, you’re planning to cook <i>yourself</i>?” Harry rolled his head, looking at Draco. “I didn’t know you could cook.” </p>
<p>“There’s a lot about me you don’t know, Harry.” Draco stretched. “And yes, I’ll have you know I’m a brilliant cook.” </p>
<p>“Great.” Harry grinned. “I’ll just lie here while you make us dinner, then shall I?”</p>
<p>“Oh no you don’t.” Draco sat up and smirked down at Harry. “You’re going to help me. I’ll need a sous chef.” </p>
<p>“A what?” </p>
<p>“Someone to chop up my ingredients.” Draco winked. “I’ll let you wear clothes.” </p>
<p>“Big of you,” said Harry dryly. </p>
<p>“I know.” </p>
