    <p>Being an emotionally dry individual and a Master Occlumens (not to mention a natural arsehole, but that was neither here nor there) really helped Severus Snape to have a great deal of control of his emotions. It didn’t, contrary to popular belief, make him a completely unemotional arsehole. He was one, mind you, just not completely.</p><p>So, that being a given, it still didn’t prepare him to see the corpse of the man he had considered one of his most hated enemies at a time, and who just recently he had come to respect, even if just a little. Lily Potter nee Evans was always a force of nature, and when she was pregnant with her first child she decided that, for some reason, she was going to fix her relationship with Severus. There was a lot of pain, particularly felt by the young Potions Master when he was forced to revaluate the decision he had made in his life while his former best friend beat the crap out him with a mace. For friendship.</p><p>It opened his eyes (and his skull), but they had managed to rebuilt a solid friendship. It also forced Severus to come in contact with James Potter, but while he could say that his opinion of the man would always be coloured by their younger days, Severus could admit that he had come to respect the man his former enemy had become. It didn’t change his opinion of the rest of his group, although he could also say he at least respected Remus` intellect. </p><p>Taking a moment to send a short prayer for his soul, he quickly ventured into the nursery, knowing but still hoping that he would find something different from what he expected. </p><p>His luck, as always, was rotten to the very core.</p><p>He knew that if seeing James had been bad, looking at Lily`s body would be the worst thing ever. But he didn’t expect the pain to be so great that he was brought to his knees as his chest contracted worse than the times he was subjected to the Cruciatus Curse. Cradling the inert body, he let his tears fall freely, sobbing and softly uttering apologies that he knew wouldn’t be heard.  The soft whisperings of a voice that was too young to be his own brought him back to reality and when he looked up, he was met with green eyes, which showed the same intensity that the mother had displayed on daily basis.</p><p>Suddenly, he knew what he had to do.</p><p>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</p><p>Cedric Diggory was a young but well known student of Hogwarts, and one of the most respected Hufflepuff in the school. Getting top marks, being a great Seeker and having the looks that at his age placed him somewhere between handsome and beautiful had given him more attention than what he had ever really wanted. Every teacher, from the strict but fair Professor McGonagall, the kind Matron of Hogwarts and even the Evil Professor Snape had nothing but good things to say about him.</p><p>It wasn’t a surprise then, that he was well received as soon as he was near the Hufflepuff table. The Welcoming Feast was the moment when friends who hadn’t managed to see each other during the summer could finally start to catch up. Of course, that was after the First Years had all been sorted. </p><p>The new students were barely inside for a few seconds, but Cedric`s eyes landed in one particular boy almost immediately. The younger boy was of slightly above average in height, being beat by a couple of massive, brutish looking boys, a platinum haired one and another one he easily recognized as a Weasley. </p><p>The boy, that had captured Cedric`s attention to a higher degree than even the flocks of girls that usually demanded it, had messy dark hair that was barely long enough to be held by a short, high ponytail, and his skin was healthy but pale. His eyes –oh, <em>his eyes</em>- were such a brilliant green that they almost glowed. They somehow reminded Cedric of the Killing Curse but in a completely different way -and yes, he had seen it, but the Hufflepuff would rather leave that in the past.</p><p>
  <em>*ba-bump*</em>
</p><p>The boy’s expression was relaxed and he was even smiling a little. He said a few things, and Cedric noticed a bushy-haired girl nodding along with him, while two other boys, one with sandy blond hair and the other with short brown hair and blue eyes listened attentively. Unexplainably he felt something coil inside his stomach when the green-eyed boy laughed at something the blue-eyed one said, but Cedric didn’t say anything before the first of the new students was called to be sorted.</p><p>The next minutes had Cedric alternating his attention between those who were Sorted, applauding when the rest of his House mates did and watching the boy. He was jostled out of his thoughts when he heard the name “Harrison Potter” being called, and then adopted a surprised look when the green-eyed boy moved in front.</p><p>“Can you believe it, Cedric?”  commented Benjamin Selwyn, one of Cedric`s closets friends. His brown hair was shoulder length and his eyes were hazel colour and expressive. Of the group, he was the most excitable. “Harry Potter! It would be awesome if he was sorted in Hufflepuff.”</p><p>“There are more possibilities of the Hat heavily considering placing him in Slytherin,” commented Sam Wells. He had green eyes, short brown hair and tanned skin. He usually spoke calmly, almost in monotone, but he was very musically inclined and it was only then that he openly showed any kind of emotion. “But I`m sure he will go to Gryffindor.”</p><p>“You want to bet?” challenged Benjamin. Sam`s eyes lazily landed on him.</p><p>“Guys, stop,” exclaimed Cedric. “Ben, you know that Sam almost always wins, so don’t bet against him. And Sam, don’t encourage him.”</p><p>“He sure is taking his time,” murmured Sam, seeming to ignore his friend. </p><p>He was right. The Hat normally just needed less than thirty seconds to know where to place someone, but Potter had already been sitting on the stool for at least two minutes. The boy didn’t seem too concerned, though.</p><p>“GRIFFYNDOR!”</p><p>“Told you so,” Cedric barely noticed Sam say while his eyes trailed after Potter, feeling, even if he didn’t know <em>why</em>, a sense of disappointment. Sure, it would have been nice to have someone famous share the same House as him, but it still didn’t explain why the fact that Harry wasn’t placed in Hufflepuff made him feel so bad.</p><p>Unfortunately for him, he didn’t notice the two pairs of eyes watching him curiously or the knowing looks they exchanged.</p>
