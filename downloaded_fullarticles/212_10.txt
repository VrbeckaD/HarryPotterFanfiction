    <p>The sounds of the battle were dying away, replaced by the sounds of despair and relief as Hermione made her way carefully through the partially collapsed tunnel towards the Shrieking Shack. Voldemort was defeated, his remaining followers were either arrested or had fled and the light stood victorious but not without considerable loss. </p><p>Lavender Brown had been mauled by Greyback, poor Colin Creevey had snuck back, only wanting to fight with his heroes and was felled by a killing curse from an unknown combatant. Some fifty other students had been caught up in the battle and lost their lives. The death of Fred Weasley was devastating for all, especially for George who was alone for the first time since his brief stint solo in the womb after Fred's birth. </p><p>The survivors had brought all of the fallen to the Great Hall after things had begun to settle and that was the first time that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had found out about Tonks’ and Lupin’s deaths at the hands of Dolohov and Bellatrix. Harry broke down at the sight of the couple laid side by side, together even in death.Ron fell into his mother's arms at the side of his slain brother, unable to console George. Hermione wandered around the hall, checking on survivors and paying respect to the dead before looping back to spend some time with the Weasleys as they mourned their loss and grieve with Harry. </p><p>Looking around the room at the ones they had lost, she suddenly realized that no one had retrieved the body of Professor Snape. No one but the trio knew what had happened in the shack and Harry had only briefly mentioned the memories he had viewed in the pensieve but Snape deserved to be remembered as well. She told Harry she was going to help out in the grounds to search for more survivors and victims but stole away to the tunnel under the Whomping Willow instead. </p><p>This far away it was eerily silent, the smell of dust and blood thick in the air as she made her way up to the derelict room. There was no reason to be quiet but Hermione stepped carefully, reverently across the creaking floorboards to the dark mass on the floor, barely noticeable in the dim light breaking through grimy windows.</p><p>“Lumos,” she whispered as she approached Snape’s body and knelt beside him, careful to avoid the large pool of congealing blood surrounding him. The bite wound on his pale throat looked more like a gash and even though hours had passed, the blood seemed to still flow sluggishly. She frowned and furrowed her brow. It shouldn’t be doing that. Then a gurgle startled her so much that she fell over, dropping her wand. She scrambled to right herself and fumbled for her wand, moving the lit tip closer to his face. His eyes remained closed but there seemed to be movement behind them. She lifted an eyelid tentatively and the pupil contracted in the light followed by a second gurgle. Bloody hell, he was alive! Without hesitation she plunged her fingers into the bloody mess of a neck and found a faint pulse. </p><p>“Professor. It’s Hermione Granger. I’m here. I'll do what I can. I'll call someone.” As she lifted her wand to send her patronus, a cold hand grasped her wrist weakly and she looked down. Eyes still closed, Severus Snape shook his head with an enormous effort and mouthed ‘You’ silently and then fell still once again. An internal argument took place rather quickly. On one hand, if she didn’t get help, he may die. Even then, transporting him might do him in. On the other hand, perhaps she could stabilise him before moving him. With a deep breath, Hermione righted herself and began to run diagnostic tests to determine what was wrong. Besides the tremendous blood loss, it seemed he had venom flowing through him, one she couldn't identify. It also showed that his magical energy was severely depleted and unable to recharge. He must have tried to heal himself, accounting for him still being on the brink of death and have yet to fall over.</p><p>With shaking hands that had nothing to do with the cold seeping through her muggle clothing, she began to rummage around in her pockets to see if she had any potions on her and cursed inwardly that she didn't have her little beaded bag. She had kept it on her for the better part of a year and when she needed it now, it was gone. Apologizing in a near whisper, she began to carefully pat down Snapes robes in search of anything. She found a small green vial and held it up to the dying light to see a grey liquid swirling inside. </p><p>A movement in her periphery her brought her attention down to the man beside her. He raised a finger, eyes open the merest of slits, and pointed at the bottle and then at his throat. She furrowed her brow and then it dawned on her. Of course. He had known of Nagini’s poison since she attacked Arthur Weasley in the Department of Mysteries in fifth year. He knew that Voldemort was likely to use her to attack. An accomplished Master Potioneer would have done all they could to find an antivenin and it seems he may have. And a spy would always keep an ace up his sleeve. </p><p>Hoping she was interpreting him correctly she pulled the cork and pried his mouth open, pouring the watery substance down his throat. His body sagged a bit, relaxing into the floor but no adverse side effects seemed to follow the dosing. Sitting back on her heels she fought with exhaustion and the injuries she had sustained during the battle. All she wanted to do was to hide away and not be the strong one anymore. Why was it always up to her? She wanted to cry and sleep and mourn and eat and run away but she couldn’t. Not now. Shaking her head to clear away the thoughts that would help no one, she began to plan.</p><p>Her brain was working overtime. She had to do what she could and no simple magic spell could fix this. He needed a transfer of Magical Energy. He needed to be brought back from where he was and she wasn't sure she could do it. Then a thought came to her, was she a witch or not? Was she not heralded as the brightest witch of her age? She was the one who studied dark tomes to find and research ancient magics nearly forgotten by modern wizarding society. She was the one that Snape had asked to help, so he must have known she would be his best bet. Closing her eyes, she went through her considerable library of knowledge until she remembered something she came across while searching for information on Horcruxes in Secrets of the Darkest Art, a book she had ‘borrowed’ from the library. It involved two of the most questioned and frowned upon forms of magic: blood and sex. </p><p>Hermione knew no one else would even attempt this spell, as it required the caster to be pure and she fit the bill in that regard. No one else would have quickly weighed the pros and cons of performing such magic, simply determining it too much, perhaps too dark. But Hermione did. And the pros far outweighed the cons in this case.  Her only worry was one of consent. Snape wasn’t exactly in the position to say yes.  But it had to be done and now. Taking a deep breath she removed her jeans and underwear, casting a warming charm over them both as she scrambled to move his robes and open his blood soaked trousers, shoving them down only as much as would be needed. She knew this was not an act that would bring either of them the pleasure that a normal coupling would so she had to resort to a charm to get him hard. Nervously, she climbed over and straddled his lap, taking him in hand and hovering above him as she said the incantation. “Tibi corpus meum de, castitatem, et vitam*.” </p><p>The last word spoken, Hermione sunk down on him with a small whimper of pain. Tears welled at the corners of her eyes as she bit her cheeks to stop from crying. After taking some deep, calming breaths she began to move. All of her weight was on her feet and calves as she lifted up and lowered herself in shallow movements. Hermione tried to think about anything that might make this more enjoyable for her but it was impossible. It bloody well hurt. But this wasn't about her and she had to come to grips with that. Harry had told her and Ron about the memories, of Snape's sacrifices. </p><p>This was not about romance or love, this was the act to save the life of the man who helped to defeat the Dark Lord. The wizard who had been terribly used by both the light and dark for so long that he had never gotten a chance to live life his own way. The one who deserved it beyond almost all others. Hermione swallowed back her tears once again and moved faster, the burning ache in her legs threatened to give in. Before that could happen though, she felt him twitch under her and knew that even in his unconscious, near dead state, his body was still reacting to the warmth and tightness around him and soon, he spilled inside her with a slightly pained groan. She stilled her hips, panting softly, and spoke the incantation once more. “Tibi corpus meum de, castitatem, et vitam.”</p><p>There was a kick up in the air and the dirt swirled slightly as Hermione felt an electricity flowing between them. Her back arched as her head fell back and she experienced her own unbidden release. The magic in the room reached its peak and exploded silently, the grimy boarded windows blowing out as she slumped, spent and gasping, over Snape’s still body. Her heart pounded and her breath was ragged from a combination of exertion and the adrenaline still thrumming through her from the spell. Muscles aching and slightly dizzy, Hermione eased herself off of him, grimacing as she felt the wet between her legs and seeping from her. </p><p>She felt dirty as she winced at the flare of pain between her legs. Looking down she saw the tinge of pink mingled with the rest of his release an a shiver ran up her spine at the visible proof of her deflowering. A hasty cleansing spell on both of them removed any sign of their coupling and she ran another diagnostic spell. Snape’s breathing had improved and his magical core seemed to be stronger. At least it seemed to have worked. Had there been no improvement and she had just done that, the shame would have been too much to bear. </p><p>The last thing she needed to do was a memory charm. It would do neither of them any favours for him to remember what she had to do to save him. Hermione knew she had to be careful. Severus Snape was a brilliant man and she had to cut out only the bits about this time with surgical precision so she didn’t damage any of his other memories. She had become proficient in them after deciding to erase herself from her parents memories to save them. Taking her vinewood wand, Hermione pointed it at Snape’s temple. She took a few calming breaths to steady her hand and spoke. “Obliviate.” Satisfied she had done all she could on her own to save his life and frankly needing a , she put their clothes to rights and gathered the man into her arms, pulling him up to lay almost over her shoulder and turned on the spot. Voldemort and his death eaters had destroyed the wards surrounding the Hogwarts grounds in the fight which allowed Hermione to apparate directly into the partially destroyed hospital wing with her patient in her arms.</p><p>“Madam Pomfrey! Someone! We need help!” She shouted as she lowered Snape onto an empty bed. There was a rush of movement as the matron hurried over, followed by a dirty and disheveled Professor McGonagall. “He was attacked by Nagini. I found an antivenin on him and it seemed to have helped. He has lost so much blood. Please help him.” She pleaded.</p><p>“My dear girl, you need to be looked at as well.” McGonagall hastened to her side as Hermione lost steam and slumped against her. She had been weak before and had just given away a huge amount of energy and magic. She was helped to her own bed and fell into an uneasy sleep. When she woke, she was informed that Snape had been moved to St. Mungos. That was for the better, she thought. Out of sight, out of mind. </p><p>When Madam Pomfrey released her the next day, Hermione vowed to never speak of what had transpired and to not seek out the man whose life she had just saved. She didn't want him to feel indebted to her and no doubt the magic she had used would disgust all who learned of it. No. Hermione would just move on and forward. Make a difference in the world and prevent something like this happening again. She straightened her back and exhaled as she walked into the Great Hall to be greeted by Ron and Harry, quickly followed by the other survivors. Hermione allowed herself to be caught up in the crowd, glad of the distraction. The future was theirs and there was work to do.</p><p>________________</p><p>*Tibi corpus meum de, castitatem, et vitam: I give you my body, my purity, and my life.<br/>(Thank you to my friend JF for the translation help)</p>
