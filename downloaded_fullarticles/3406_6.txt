<p>A Real Struggle</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“I’m struggling to come up with a legitimate explanation for finding you gentlemen in this position.” Headmistress McGonagall eyed Harry and Draco. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>Harry coughed. “Er, we’re, um, waiting for you.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” chimed in Draco. “Professor Binns indicated you wished to see us.” </p>
<p>McGonagall raised an eyebrow. “While I did send for you, I hardly expected to find you…entangled beneath my desk.” </p>
<p>“Right.” Harry did his best to tuck in his shirt as unobtrusively as possible. “Well you see, I dropped something, and as my vision’s not the best, Draco was…helping me locate it.” </p>
<p>“Exactly!” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>McGonagall’s lips twitched. “Ah.”</p>
<p>Draco cleared his throat, reaching for a button and handing it to Harry. “Found it!” He stood up. “Your struggle’s over, H-Potter.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Oh! Yes, thanks a lot, Malfoy.” Harry slipped the button into his pocket. “I appreciate your help.” </p>
<p>Draco hummed. “Anytime.” </p>
<p>McGonagall smiled faintly. “If you’re done, may I have my desk back?” </p>
<p>Flushing, Harry and Draco crawled out from under her desk, standing up. </p>
<p>“I asked you here to discuss inter-house cooperation and fraternity this year,” she continued. “Although it seems you’ve got a head start.” </p>
<p>“Headmistress—” Harry began. </p>
<p>“So never mind. Dismissed.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“How embarrassing,” muttered Harry as they exited McGonagall’s office.</p>
<p>Draco snorted. “She’d no clue what we were doing.” </p>
<p>Harry gaped at him. “Didn’t you see the way she was smirking at us? Of course she knew!” </p>
<p>“Oh please. She’s so old she probably has to struggle to remember what it’s like being young.”</p>
<p>Harry ducked his head. “I dunno. Another few moments and I would have been naked, and then there would have been no doubt what we were doing.” </p>
<p>“Admittedly, that would’ve been harder to explain.” Draco smirked. “Although maybe next time we’ll just say we’re…fraternising.” </p>
<p>“<i>Next time</i>?” </p>
