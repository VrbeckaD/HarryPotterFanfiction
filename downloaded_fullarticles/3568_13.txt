    <p>The final whistle on the train began to blow signaling the departure of the Hogwarts Express back to the train station and Harry still could not find Ron or Hermione. He had searched in all the compartments that griffindoors usually sit in but they hadn't been in any of them. He finally decided to just find a compartment and settle down without them. He walked along the long hallway of the train, looking in to each compartment to find an empty one, or just one with an empty seat, but with no luck. </p><p>     He eventually made it all the way to the end of the train to find a single empty compartment left waiting for him. He rolled open the door and walked in just as the train lurched forward and started to roll along the tracks away from the beautiful castle and towards the countryside. Harry pulled his trunk up onto the rack above the seats and sat down next to the foggy window. He sat in the silence watching the fields fly by when the sound of the compartment door rolling open disrupted to tranquillity. </p><p>     He turned to see Draco Malfoy standing in the doorway carrying his trunk. </p><p>     "Of course the only compartment left is the one where you're sitting Potter. Just my luck to have to sit with you. There's no more seats left anywhere on the train so I have to sit with you. Ok?" Harry paused and looked at Draco for a minute contemplating whether or not to let him sit in the compartment. </p><p>     On one hand it was Draco and he has always been rude and disliked Harry ever since their first year at hogwarts. But then on the other hand it would be nice to have someone else with him to talk to or just be with before he had to go back to hell for who knows how long since he had graduated this year. And although Draco was never really nice to Harry, he always had a good feeling about Draco. Like he was a good person, but just didn't show it very much. And plus, Harry always did wish he could get to know Draco better since he had always thought Draco was pretty cute.</p><p>     "Well? Can I sit in here or not?" Harry looked back up at Draco realizing he had just been spacing out while he had been contemplating his answer. </p><p>     "Oh, yea, sure thing." </p><p>     Draco walked into the compartment, and hoisted his luggage up onto the rack on the opposite side of Harry's. He then turned back around and sat down across from him and looked out the window. They both sat in silence watching the world pass by through the tall window and listening to the train clack along the tracks. After a while Harry look back up at Draco. </p><p>     "Is there a reason you don't like me so much or is it just a random decision?" Draco turned his head towards Harry and gave him a confused glare, </p><p>     "it's not that I don't like you, it's just that I don't particularly like you for any reason." They sat in silence again for a few for minutes when Harry has a follow up question.</p><p>      "Then why don't we just call a truce and be neutral friends then. Since it's the end the school we probably won't see each other anymore so it won't really matter, so why not?" </p><p>     "Well ok then." Harry gave a warm smile to his new official friend and looked back out the window. Draco blushed a bit when Harry gave him that goofy smile. He never really had friends like Harry who seemed kind and caring. He had always actually wished he was friends with Harry, but he thought he never could since from the very beginning of school they didn't really hit it off well. He had actually sometimes even had crushes on Harry at different times throughout the years. He just seemed so happy and kind and cute to Draco.</p><p>     "So then if we're friends now we should act like it. What are you doing this summer?" Harry looked down at his feet and wondered what he should say in response. For some reason something urged Harry to just be honest with Draco and tell him about the hell he gets to go back to each year. </p><p>     "Well I get to go back to my aunt and uncle's house where I get both physically and verbally abused by both of them and also my idiot cousin because they all hate me for no apparent reason ever since I was left on their doorstep when I was a baby." Harry immediately realized he shouldn't have just started telling Draco about his problems. </p><p>     "Ah merlin I'm sorry I didn't mean to just start dumping my issues on you, I don't really know what-" </p><p>     "Don't worry. It's not very different for me actually. I get to go home where my father just pressures me and yells at me about how I have to train to become a death eater and prepare myself to become a loyal follower of Voldemort. He doesn't even ask my opinion about what I want to do with my life. He just forces me to be like him. He doesnâ€™t even care about me at all..." They started to sit gloomily in silence again when Harry gave a small laugh. Draco looked back up at Harry confused as to why he had laughed at his problems. </p><p>     "It's kinda funny how we've been feuding for so long when we are pretty alike when you think about it." Draco laughed a bit too after a second and they both looked back at each other and laughed a bit more. They both started to get more dismal again when they remembered why they had been sad in the the first place. After a minute Draco looked back over to Harry. </p><p>     "Why do you even go back?" Harry looked back over and thought about the question. He never really had a specific reason. </p><p>     "I don't really have anywhere else to go I guess. There's not really much waiting for me either. What about you? Why don't you just leave your house?" Draco paused to think about his answer as well. </p><p>     "I guess it's the same as your answer really. I don't really have anything waiting out there for me and it's not like I have anywhere else to go where my family won't find me." After a moment a crazy idea popped into Harry's head. </p><p>    "What if we just don't go back? We both said how we don't have anything big out there making us want to leave, what if this is it? What if the thing that should motivate us to leave, is us?" Draco paused, wondering what harry meant by all of this. </p><p>     "I- I don't really think I get what you mean." </p><p>     "If there's supposed to be some big thing to motivate us to leave our crappy lives, then who says it's not us right now, realizing that we should run away?" Harry kept looking at Draco while getting more and more excited about his plan. Draco looked back up at harry after thinking more about his proposal to find Harry practically falling out of his seat leaning towards him with another big goofy smile on his face. It couldn't help but make Draco smile as well and want to go through with the plan.</p>
