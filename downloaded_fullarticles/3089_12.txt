    <p>Draco arrived at the common room past curfew once again that night. To all appearances the portrait opened and closed with no one to come in until Draco lifted the Disillusionment Spell that he was known to use more often these days. Everyone in their friends group knew he was sneaking off to somewhere, he wasn’t being terribly subtle about it, but no one knew where to or who he was with.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn’t any of anyone’s business who Draco was spending his time with. He didn’t like to keep anything a secret from his friends, particularly not from Pansy, but for now it was just easier. No one would get it anyway. So even when Daphne remarked that he looked like he had been making out with someone - there were some telltale signs like his reddened lips - like the gossip queen she was and the others were obnoxiously asking about it, he wasn’t going to tell.<br/>
<br/>
No, he would only get incredulous looks and remarks if he told anyone that the person he was seeing was Hermione Granger. He wondered if they would even believe him. Enemies for seven years, it seemed that both of them had come to their senses after the war and after rescuing one another from certain death. Draco had lost his belief system due to the war and felt generally lost. Hermione, on the other hand, finally learned that there was more than one side to a story and that good and bad were very relative concepts. They complemented each other.<br/>
<br/>
What had started with a few accidental run-ins at the castle and awkward small talk had soon grown into a mutually agreed on friendship. It hadn’t always been easy because of their very different backgrounds, but they came a long way with patience and understanding instead of immediate judgement and thinking they knew when they didn’t. About two months ago Draco finally found enough courage to kiss her and things had been good since, surprisingly good.<br/>
<br/>
Merlin knew that things may not be so good once other people started finding out. <em>The Brightest Witch of her Age </em>and <em>The Youngest Death Eater to Ever have joined the Ranks </em>was hardly a fairytale anyone wanted to witness. His friends weren’t going to take it well, never mind <em>her </em>friends. And even if they got past all that there were their families to deal with. He couldn’t tell what was worse: a muggleborn telling her muggle parents she was dating a boy that used to bully her and hated her kind until the war or a pureblood telling his pureblood parents that he was dating a muggleborn girl that they all used to hate due to her blood and alliance.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly said, it could not come to any good. The main reason why all the sneaking around was happening was so they could find out what was going on between them without anyone else having an opinion about it. It wasn’t theirs to have an opinion about, not just yet. And if didn’t come to anything there was no harm done and no one had to know.<br/>
<br/>
That was what Draco was thinking, anyway, when he went on his way to the dormitory to try to get some much-needed sleep. It was due to that that he visibly jumped when he heard another person’s voice. It was Pansy, who was sitting by the fireplace and who was glaring at him as though they were six years again and he just stole her favourite toy. He had never done any such thing, though, so she didn’t need to stare at him like that.<br/>
<br/>
“I know who you’ve been seeing,” she said. “When were you going to tell us that you’ve been screwing a mudblood, Draco?” Now <em>that </em>was exactly the kind of obnoxious and ignorant remark that he had been trying to avoid.<br/>
<br/>
Draco rolled his eyes and folded his arms over one another, glaring at her until she looked away. She didn’t. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said. “I’m not screwing anyone.”<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t lie to me, Draco,” Pansy replied instantly. “I saw you make out with Granger.”<br/>
<br/>
That still didn’t mean that he was screwing her, as Pansy so eloquently put it, but he wasn’t going to argue terms with her right now. He wasn’t sure what the right way to go about this was. Denying it seemed out of the question, because she wasn’t going to make such an accusation if she hadn’t been completely sure. That left dealing with it, but that couldn’t come to any good. His best friend was still a blood purist, after all. </p><p>“I’m not talking about it,” he simply said. “I’m going to get some sleep. Good night.” With that, he turned back around and wanted to head towards the eighth year boys’ dormitory, but Pansy’s voice stopped him again, this time around with a question.<br/>
<br/>
“Are you in love with her? Do you love her? Is that it?” Pansy questioned things she shouldn’t be asking because Draco didn’t know the answer himself. He was confused and Hermione was helping him figure it out just by being there for him. He could slowly learn to accept that maybe blood didn’t mean as much as he formerly thought it did. He could learn to realize that maybe it wasn’t his blood and his last name but his cleverness and sense of humour that were reasons that people liked him and wanted to spent time with him.</p><p>Draco turned back around to look at Pansy. Apparently his face expression spoke for him for once, because Pansy raised her eyebrows while she was looking at him and shook her head. Silence feel between them for a couple of seconds until she broke it. “You love her,” Pansy concluded, and her voice was soft. “That’s really screwed up.”<br/>
<br/>
He hated to agree, but he agreed. It was too difficult. They were too different. It would never work out between them. But maybe that was what their problem was: neither one did well when something was easy. They wanted difficult, they wanted someone that challenged them to be better (smarter, stronger) and they were that person for each other.<br/>
<br/>
“Good night,” was all he said before leaving for the dormitory at last. It would just be another sleepless night, but at least thoughts about Granger keeping him up were favourable to the alternative. </p>
