  <em>10 April 1925</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hallerbos Forest</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Halle, Belgium</em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>All is well</em>, the bluebell flowers whispered.</p><p>It was early evening; a curtain of darkness had only just fallen over the forest, following behind its sinking brother, the sun. Most of the birds and animals had burrowed down in dens and curled up in trees to await the next morning, paying little mind to the shouts and flashes of light deeper in the trees. And so the blooms were left alone to pass quiet messages about the events of the day—which new buds had flowered, which trees were defiled by territorial werewolves, which flowers had been crushed underfoot by the boots of men.</p><p>Bluebell flowers could not 'feel' the way the trees or animals could, though they too had become soaked over time with the supernatural powers of all the beings that had ever passed through Hallerbos, and so were not <em>quite</em> ordinary anymore. Still—it only made sense that when the first abnormally warm wind blew through the forest, the trees shivered and the animals cringed before the flowers registered any trouble.</p><p>A second gust of warm wind propelled itself through the forest, shaking some of the sturdier, younger trees still standing after the boots of German Muggles had swept through and taken the Older Ones away. With this new heat came the sound of crackling power, like a lightning bolt impendent. It startled a trio of hares hiding nearby, sending them bounding off in three different directions, unlikely to meet up again for some time.</p><p>The phenomenon was so strange that it prodded the beeches and the bluebells into talking <em>to each other</em> in their own limited way, rather than simply among themselves.</p><p>
  <em>A storm?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Not a storm.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But the wind—</em>
</p><p>
  <em>There is no rain, no life-water, no thunder. Only the wind.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The wind is warm but the light is gone.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Too warm.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Came from nowhere.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>This is no storm.</em>
</p><p>The heat and the crackle in the air built, reminiscent of ozone, lending strength to the unease rippling through Hallerbos' flora and fauna. A blue mist formed in a clearing near the forest's edge, wisps of magic which curled and swirled faster and faster.</p><p>Just before all hell broke loose, the bluebell flowers had time to quake, and whisper, <em>All is no longer well</em>.</p><p>Then the heat and the crackles of lightning-that-was-not-lightning and the blue wisps of magic all merged together with a loud <em>CRACK</em>.</p><p>Bright blue light shone from the nexus, as bright and blue as the surrounding cowering flowers. The blue wisps of before gained form and shape, creating a yawning mouth in the clearing—a portal of unknown origin. The not-lightning settled around either end of the portal, pulling it wider with spider-thin hands. The heat called to some distant shape within the portal, another source of heat and light and life coming from only-Merlin-knew-where.</p><p>Fully formed at last, the strange portal hummed patiently, emitting more of that heat which shriveled the nearest bluebells and peeled the bark off the nearest trees. It wasn't any more sentient than the flowers or the trees or the animals, yet any passing observer would have said with surety that the thing seemed content to <em>wait</em> for its passenger to emerge.</p><p>Its passenger took his sweet time. The portal spat sparks during his crossing that were blinding but too weak to set the grass ablaze. Magic hummed and hissed, patient and yet all too volatile; the wizard inside walked at an even pace, closer and closer to the exit which was less than one minute and over eighty years away.</p><p>When the portal yawned wider than the mouth of a cave, the young man who'd opened it stepped through at last. The wide crackling blue space pulsed with something like satisfaction, and some of the not-lightning dissipated. The traveler watched this with barely quirked lips.</p><p>He was tall, though not uncommonly so, and slender in a way that suggested he'd been better described as 'scrawny' when he was a boy. Black hair perched precariously on his head and brushed his shoulders, mussed as though it had been affected by the high winds which had preceded him in his journey here. His eyes were as startlingly green as ever, though slightly deeper and sharper now that he was past maturity. Although his black Muggle clothes and the black sweeping wizard's robes over them were quite nondescript, the features of his face ruined any anonymity he sought: over the compelling green eyes lay a well-worn pair of glasses (square rather than round), and right of center on his forehead was a lightning-bolt shaped scar which put the not-quite-bolts flashing around the portal behind him to shame.</p><p>Harry Potter took a moment to do a slow turn, absorbing his surroundings with one dark eyebrow raised—and the more he turned, the more his bemused expression turned sour. At the end of his rotation, a frown had taken up permanent residence on his face.</p><p>"Fuck," he uttered decisively. "This is <em>definitely</em> not England."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They must have overshot the destination—there was no other explanation.</p><p>Time magic was—not precise, exactly. But it <em>was</em> predictable, malleable, even when its consequences were anything but. And the work he and his colleagues and friends had been doing involved all the poking and pushing and molding necessary to make an endeavor like this possible: traveling inverse to the natural flow of time, faster and farther than an hour per trinket spin.</p><p>
  <em>…And speaking of.</em>
</p><p>He needed to smother his entry point, lest it lead to… <em>problems</em>. He'd promised there would be no problems this time.</p><p>
  <em>Right. Here and back, in a snap. Now where'd I stow that thing?</em>
</p><p>Harry stuffed both his hands in the pockets of his robes, questing for the object his life would be tied to for the duration of this journey. His right hand was victorious; he pulled the warm, glowing sphere from his pocket and held it aloft, with the tiniest of triumphant grins.</p><p>The little artefact was about half again the size of a Remembrall, though its glassy surface was pale blue instead of clear. Around that surface, too, were interlinking patterns of gleaming gold bands, revolving slowly but steadily around the sphere like planetary rings, and covered on all sides with tiny numbers: dates, times, calculations, all measurements of the one thing that could not truly be measured. Keyed as it was to him, the device hummed with the warmth of being recently used—and so too did the 5 grams of glowing silver sand sliding about inside the sphere.</p><p>
  <em>"What'd she say it was called again?" Ron's nose was scrunched up mid-examination. "A… tempura slider?"</em>
</p><p><em>"A </em>Temporal Slicer,<em> Ron," Hermione half-corrected, half-sighed. "Though I </em>doubt<em> that's the official name, it's supposed to be capable of making an incision in a previously-intact timeline, and transporting its wielders to the end of that cut."</em></p><p>Whatever the official name was, when Harry turned back around to face the portal, it was that very item he held even higher, showing no unease in the face of the hissing and snapping coming from his travel tunnel.</p><p>"Come on, you," he called out, "time to kip for a bit. Don't make things difficult."</p><p>And he threw the sphere forward, with unerring Seeker aim.</p><p>The Temporal Slicer flew straight as an arrow, halting an instant before it could go through the portal—immune, of course, to its own magic. Harry watched with no small amount of mingled disgust and approval as the silver sand froze in the sphere and a thin blue line appeared in the side of the ball, like a crack in the glass. Then the line became a gaping hole, as the Slicer opened its 'mouth' and <em>inhaled</em>.</p><p>
  <em>Screeee!</em>
</p><p>Harry winced at the noise—but it was working. The Temporal Slicer was <em>swallowing</em> the portal, drawing in the sparks of not-lightning and the blue wisps and the whole path back the way he came. It wasn't gone forever, of course, but preserved—frozen until he had accomplished his mission, and could go back to where he belonged.</p><p><em>Safer than leaving the portal open in the middle of Merlin-knows-where, anyway</em>.</p><p>With a tiny noise like a <em>bloop</em>, the Slicer finished its dirty work: there was no further sign of the portal in the forest, and blue wisps now danced with the silver sand inside the newly-closed sphere.</p><p>"Nice work," Harry praised it, before drawing his holly-and-phoenix-feather wand for the first time in this time and incanting, "<em>Accio</em>."</p><p>The brilliant little invention sailed back to his hand without a single spark or sputter of protest.</p><p>Harry's mind was already racing ahead to other concerns as he pocketed it and the wand, and retrieved the compact disc that waited in his left pocket. He needed to find out exactly where he was, and <em>when</em> he was. If he could nick a newspaper, or catch a radio broadcast, that would help immensely—especially as he was fairly sure he'd come to a time that predated television, and even in <em>his</em> time they hadn't yet invented a spell to tell one any more than the current time and day in their zone. He needed to make sure, <em>absolutely sure</em>, that his target was still in England, and that the spell actually <em>had</em> bungled by sending him <em>here</em> instead and giving the git a head-start. And he needed to lay low while he accomplished every one of those tasks.</p><p>Attracting the wrong attention could be deadly when he was at least eighty-some years out of place.</p><p><em>Not that I'm not used to attracting the wrong attention</em>.</p><p><em>Enough of that</em>. He shook his head, and turned his attention to the disc, popping it open.</p><p>His next motions were well-practiced, and so swift: a thumb and finger from each hand made a few swipes inside the container, then ran over his forehead and his right hand in turns. Over and over, until his most identifiable scars were smothered, and no strange discolored patches stood out on his skin. It was a method far more effective and subtle than wandless charms or glamours, one most wizards would not notice, or even <em>think</em> to notice. On his last two missions it had served him well—he hoped it would continue the trend now.</p><p>The disc was packed away quickly too, in favor of his wand. Harry glanced around once at the blanket of bluebell flowers, only closing his eyes when he was sure no one was near. He needed to concentrate, if he wanted the next spell he cast to latch on to the man he sought. Yes. He needed absolute focus, and—</p><p><em>Oh, right</em>.</p><p>The last item to come out of Harry's robe pockets was perhaps the most important: a strip of cloth covered in mostly-dry blood, recently shed. The smell of iron still bit strongly at the nose from the stain, and only partly because of the Preservation Charms Ginny and Luna had placed on it. He had no way of knowing when those would wear off—<em>will traveling through time speed up or slow down their longevity? Hermione and Neville would know</em>—so it was best to do this next part as quickly as possible.</p><p>Twisting his wand ninety degrees counterclockwise, Harry drew a series of ovals in the air just around the item he wished to use for his tracking spell. He prodded at the place on the cloth where the blood was thickest. Finally, he drew the point of his wand slowly outward, siphoning away a thin red line like a thread or ribbon, one only he could see.</p><p>"<em>Vestigium sanguis</em>," he commanded, watching the tip of the wand glow as red as the freshest blood on the cloth; then he added at last the name of the man he had come to collect. "<em>Felix Rosier</em>."</p><p>The bloody cloth glowed pink—a sign of success, and precursor to the last movement he needed to provide to activate the Blood Trace. Without tarrying another second, Harry jabbed his wand out away from the cloth, flicking like he was trying to dislodge the shining red thread—which indeed he was.</p><p>The red ribbon popped free of his wand a mere moment later, and began to wind through the air to his right, high enough to weave between the lowest of the beech trees' branches in the process. Harry honestly couldn't say whether or not it went toward England, where the portal <em>should</em> have spat him out; all he knew was that it was definitely heading west, based on the sliver of fading sunlight he could see in that same direction.</p><p>
  <em>But even if it's not going toward home, it doesn't matter.</em>
</p><p>The spell had worked just as easily as the last time he'd cast it; and the casting itself was easier, just like his handler had said it would be. It didn't matter that Harry still had no idea where exactly he <em>was</em>, now that he knew where he'd be <em>going</em>.</p><p>
  <em>I've got his trail. I'll find him.</em>
</p><p>Rosier might have thought he'd escaped persecution with the stunt he'd pulled, but he was in more danger now than he'd ever been before in his life, because a pissed-off Boy Who Lived had successfully tracked him this far—and wasn't planning on stopping until the little Death Eater-wannabe was in Azkaban.</p><p>
  <em>The sooner I track him down, the sooner I can take back those artefacts, throw him through the portal, and go home—without harming any of the sands of Time.</em>
</p><p><em>Rosier—you'd better hope you find what you seek before </em>I<em> do.</em></p><p>Harry Potter shook himself free of his thoughts and strode forward, following the red thread of Fate: one step at a time, one foot in front of the other. The trees whispered, the flowers cowered, and determination sang in his blood.</p>
