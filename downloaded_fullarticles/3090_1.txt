    <p>“MY FATHER WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS,” shouted Draco, chasing his hairbrush around the Slytherin common room. “...co. Draco!” He sees Pansy, but that just can’t be her, his Pansy would never wear that and she doesn’t have brooms as arms and bushy red hair. “It must be a Weasley,” he mutters charging.</p><p>“DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY, WAKE UP NOW BEFORE I HEX YOUR HAIR GEL!”</p><p>Draco sits up quickly and topples out of bed. His so-called best friends, Pansy and Blaise, are standing at the foot of his bed, smirking. Where was Theo?</p><p>“Pansy, I <em>swear</em> to Merlin-”<br/> “Yeah, yeah, time for breakfast.”</p><p>He cast a tempus charm and swore. It was only three am.</p><p>Just as he crawls back into bed, Blaise jumps in and takes the sheets from him.</p><p>“Dray, you <em>do</em> know what day it is, don’t you?</p><p>Draco curses, swiveling around and grabbing his wand, casting a charm. In giant red letters, his wand had spelled out his least favorite day, December 31st. Why is his least favorite day this, you may ask?</p><p>Well…</p><p>If you ask Draco, he’ll say it’s because he hates every holiday to exist, and this day is the eve of it all starting again.</p><p>But nobody would ask Draco.<br/> Pansy, Blaise, Theo and the rest of the Slytherin house disagree with him, obviously.</p><p>It’s because Harry Potter day is today. His least favorite holiday.</p><p>Anyone in Slytherin will tell you that Draco was obsessed.</p><p>He <em>WASN'T</em>. There was undeniable evidence though.</p><p>"Potter <em>this</em>, Potter <em>that</em>. Blah blah blah, perfect, wonderful <strong>Potter</strong>. Potter <u>holiday</u>, blah blah blah. Hey guys, you'll never guess what <em>Potter</em> did-"</p><p>Naturally, it drove everyone else insane.</p><p>He talked about Potter almost 24/7. The rest of the time that wasn’t spent whining was wasted on him cuddling, chatting, and laughing with Blaise, Theo, and Pans. Despite what everyone in different houses thinks, the ‘ice cold prince’ is a <em>complete</em> bloody Hufflepuff.</p><p>In fact, so was Blaise.</p><p>Pansy and Theo were the only Slytherins who actually were meant for Slytherin.</p><p>Actually, screw that, she was a lion in disguise.<br/> Who else would have the guts wake up Draco at bloody <strong>three</strong> <strong>am</strong> to say it’s time for breakfast, then have the <em>audacity</em> laugh and survive?</p><p>Pansy Bloody Parkinson is who.</p><p>“Unless you want to be hexed, leave my presence, Pansy. I need my beauty sleep.”</p><p>He got in the bed with Blaise and shut off the lights.</p><p>“Well, I’m going to find a <em>new</em> friend. And I’m going to bring them here.”</p><p>“Have fun,” Blaise mumbled, already half asleep.<br/> “Bye Panpan,” Draco slurred, burrowing into Blaise.</p><p>.</p><p>Pansy frowned a bit, hating how lonely she felt. Draco and Blaise just had a stronger bond because she was a girl, she reasoned. She just needed a friend right then.</p><p>.</p><p>Someone walked in, sniffling.</p><p>She stood and put on her best mask, which fell as soon as she looked over.</p><p>Pansy didn't know who she had expected, but she knew she was shocked to see Harry James Potter at the door, sobbing.</p><p>.<br/> Harry had been dating Ginny for a while. He had thought she had felt the same. He was always happy to see her and she was as well.</p><p>Or so he had thought.</p><p>But when he came back from Quidditch practice, he gave her a hug. She didn’t return it and glared at him. He had thought she was just in a mood.</p><p>Imagine his surprise when he had seen her snogging Sparrow Li, a petite girl who was dating Ron.</p><p>He was so embarrassed. He knew he should be mad, but he really wasn’t. Just really sad.</p><p>Heartbroken.</p><p>He had stumbled away and sprinted, blinded by tears, into the nearest classroom.</p><p>And looked up into the eyes of one Pansy Parkinson.</p><p>.</p><p>Pansy liked broken things, she would tinker with them and try to fix them. She would <strong>always</strong> try to help, no matter who it was, what happened and why. This was probably why when she saw Potter at the door, sobbing like there was no tomorrow, she jumped right into the action, tugging him to her corner and pulling him into her lap.</p><p>She had never seen Harry cry.</p><p>Except when Diggory died.</p><p>Pot- no, <em>Harry</em> was clutching onto her and looking at her with those <em>dazzling</em> green eyes.</p><p>Who had messed with this sunshine child, and how could they?</p><p>She pulled him to her chest and he burrowed his face into her strawberry blond hair.</p><p>.</p><p>Parkinson smelled like peaches.</p><p>.</p><p>After Harry was done crying, Pansy decided to drop the question.</p><p>“Harry, why were you crying?”</p><p><br/> “I saw Ginny snogging someone else.”</p><p>A tear slipped down his cheek.</p><p>She stood up and Harry plopped onto the ground.</p><p>“Cmon, we’re going to the kitchens. Comfort food, kay?”</p><p>Harry said nothing, just nodded.<br/> .</p><p>Harry didn’t know why he trusted her.</p><p>But he did. So he followed her.</p><p>After he explained what happened, Pansy told him to go with her to the Slytherin common room.</p><p>He agreed, but only because he couldn’t bear to see another red thing that would remind him of Gin.</p><p>.</p><p>After they got there, they chatted and found out that the had a lot in common.</p><p>Somewhere during that talk, they had become friends.</p><p>.</p><p><br/> Pansy didn’t know where the raven-haired boy would sleep.</p><p>So she brought him to the room that Blaise, Theo and Draco shared.</p><p>.</p><p>He saw the two boys curled up together and felt an unpleasant feeling in his gut.</p><p>Pansy saw his expression and smirked.</p><p>She had a plan.<br/> .</p><p>Little did Pansy know, Blaise was <em>completely</em> conscious, thank you very much.</p><p>Lucky for her, his mind was elsewhere.</p><p>He didn't care that Boy Wonder was in his bed.</p><p>He <em>knew</em>, he just couldn't be bothered.</p><p>He didn't care about Pansy's <em>creepy </em>looking grin that he <em>knew</em> would haunt his dreams forever.</p><p>It creeped him out, sure, but he didn't care.</p><p>Honestly though, Pansy was <em>scary</em>.</p><p>But he was thinking about Theo.</p><p>Like, where was he?</p><p>Blaise was sure that he didn't have classwork or home work to complete.</p><p>Blaise also knew that he didn't get up until just before breakfast, 7:30 where he rushed while Draco was still in the bathroom.</p><p>(Blaise was an freaking stalker)</p><p>Seriously though.</p><p>Draco was probably a bloody <u>girl</u> under all those clothes.</p><p>No one wakes up at 6:00, goes to the bathroom, and gels their hair for an hour and thirty minutes.</p><p>He was worried.</p><p>Theo was his top thought, no matter <strong>how</strong> concerning it was that his friend was <em>probably</em> the opposite gender and he hadn't realized it until <em>8</em> years later.</p><p>Theo didn't have a girlfriend... did he?</p><p>Blaise would ask him in the morning.</p><p>.</p><p>Why was Harry Potter in Blaise's bed?</p><p>That was Theo's only thought before he went to his bed.</p><p>What is <em>this</em>? This is probably some AU where Harry Potter is in Slytherin.</p><p>Theo had obviously read too much fanfiction, it had made him <em>hallucinate</em>.</p><p>He saw Pansy occupating his bed.</p><p>'Oh what the heck,' he thought as he joined the cuddle pile.</p>
