<br/>
He opened up to find a frustrated Hermione sitting on their bed, tangled up in yarn.<br/>
<br/>
“This isn’t possible! I’ve learned this in primary school, I should remember how to knit!” she exclaimed, tugging on loose strands, only making a worse mess.<br/>
<br/>
“Why don’t you use a knitting spell?”<br/>
<br/>
“It makes nicer jumpers, the Muggle way,” Hermione replied looking down at her work so far. “I just want to make something special for Molly. She’s given us so much.”<br/>
<br/>
Ron sat down in the space beside her on the bed and gently pried the knitting out of her hands.<br/>
<br/>
“Here, let me show you. Mum taught me the Muggle way before I could use magic.”
