</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was the middle of the night but the light of the full moon was steaming in through the window and she could see his face. He was looking down at her with love in his eyes. </span>

  <span>“Go back to sleep.” Lucius leaned down and kissed her forehead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But why are you awake? It’s the middle of the night.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I had a dream that we never got together and I wanted to make sure it wasn’t real.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione felt her heart clench. “I promise this is real. I love you”</span>
