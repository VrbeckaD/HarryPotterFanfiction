    <p>Listen.<br/>Lock the door.<br/>Close the curtains.<br/>“Lumos.”<br/>Go to bed.<br/>Listen.</p><p>The whispers you hear? They’re not real. The touches you feel? They’re not real. And you? You’re not real either?<br/>You left with the voices, with the scent of rotting flesh. You left this place the same way you left this earth, you haven’t, but you’re not here anymore either. You are stuck. Stuck in freedom and haunted by the ghosts of the past, the present, the future. The ghosts that you are. You’re not real either, no. Solely your name on the family tree speaks of your existence and proves that perhaps your nightmares are all too real after all. They tell you you’re alive. But if you were alive, would it not all be different?</p><p>Listen.<br/>Lock the door.<br/>Close the curtains.<br/>“Lumos.”<br/>Go to bed.<br/>Listen.</p><p>“Draco!” <br/>I would’ve gasped and looked over at my mother.<br/>She sighed. “I’m sorry, dear. You did not respond.”<br/>“It’s fine.” My voice would’ve been hoarse. If I hadn’t felt it vibrate in my throat I would not have believed it to be my own. I heard it so rarely recently. “What is it?” <br/>“I was just going to ask if you wanted to come with me to town. Get some fresh air.”<br/>She didn’t say it but she wanted me to get out of the house. I would’ve been grateful for that and nodded.<br/>The sun was shining outside even though it was a fresh autumn morning. But its light. Was it real? It felt dark. Like in a memory.<br/>I would’ve startled at every twig crackling under my feet.<br/>“Draco, dear, I’ll go into the flower shop real quick. You don’t have to go in with me.”<br/>I would’ve waited outside. <br/>If only the passer-bys, Muggle and Wizarding alike, wouldn’t have looked at me like a ghost. Like a resurrected evidence of evil. I felt sick and would’ve gone inside to look for my mother.<br/>Flowers. Humans. Full of live. Cut at their stems. Throats. Dying. </p><p>Listen.<br/>Voices, murmured, all around.<br/>Close your eyes.<br/>Their gazes. Heavy. Did they know?<br/>“Lumos.”<br/>No light. Darkness persisted. Darkness unchasable. Full of pain.<br/>Listen.</p><p>“Lumos!” I would’ve flinched. <br/>My mother’s hands were on my shoulders. “Let’s get out of here, dear.” An urge in her voice.<br/>Light returned, but not upon my command.<br/>I remembered it being difficult, when everything was still happening. Now it was over and you’d think it would be easier. But at least in the present, I knew it was real. Now it was the past and I didn’t know anymore what was real. Was it the future? Was it all me? If it was truly over, was I too?<br/>“Oh, look at the baby ducks.”<br/>I would’ve smiled. “So many of them.”<br/>“Following their mothers. How precious.”<br/>I would’ve watched them for a while. At least out here you could blame the voices on people taking a walk, blame the shadows on trees under sunlight, blame the sudden movements on animals taking flight. I would not have been able to go back inside.<br/>My mother paused in the entrance hall. “Is everything all right, dear?”<br/>“I forgot my coat,” I would’ve lied.<br/>“Your coat? But you’re wearing it.”<br/>I would’ve shaken my head. “The other-, The other coat.”  And I would’ve turned back around. Back to the pond and the park and the ducks until it would’ve turned dark and the shadows would have caught up with me there too. </p><p>Listen.<br/>Lock the door.<br/>Close the curtains.<br/>“Lumos.”<br/>Go to bed.<br/>Listen.</p><p>The nightmare woke me sweat-drenched and shaking. Cold and hot at the same time, in a feeling of utter inexistance. Both could not exist, light and dark, death and life, so where was I in all of this? <br/>“I can’t, mother. I can’t anymore.” <br/>Her hand was still on my wand, my tight grip not allowing her to take it away, her tight grip not allowing me to point its tip back at my throat. “I know,” she whispered. “I know. You must leave.” <br/>“How?”<br/>“Far away.”<br/>“Where?”<br/>“On your own.” <br/>“They’ll follow me everywhere.”</p><p>I started in the south. Spain. Italy. Morocco. It was warm there. Full of light. Full of colours. And the whispers outside my hotel rooms were all in languages I did not speak. They basked me into sleep.</p>
