    <p>Tom watched as Draco seemed to cling desperately to him. He had been like this since he had another panic induced sub drop after being left alone in the same room as Potter. It has not been intentional, but it was enough to set him into a flying fury, as well as Draco being in a very dangerous state and him having you face a bunch of people in a few hours, let's just say that Tom's mate was in a very precarious position. There was no way whatsoever that he was leeaving Draco's side, or allowing Draco to leave his.<br/>Tom grabbed Draco firmly by the shoulders, steadying the poor child. He was in a hell defying terror, and Riddle swore that those imbeciles would pay. Whether by his hand or another. Preferably his.<br/>Tom gripped the boy and steered him carefully through the mass of people. Once they were on the train Draco seemed to calm down substantially. He was still tense, but it was more than Tom was comfortable with. Not that he had a choice when it came to these things.<br/>"Draco," Tom said, trying to keep his voice soft and gentle. To his surprise it was not very difficult to do. Draco snapped his eyes up to his, well, just underneath his. Tom still had a very difficult time getting him to look anyone in the eye. He knew better than to give any sign of his disappointment, though, not in this state that Draco was in. All that would accomplish would be dropping Draco further down on the already dangerous spiral he was on.<br/>Once in an empty slytherin compartment, Tom sat the boy up, and said in his very obvious Alpha voice<br/>"Get dressed, now." Draco jumped to obey and without hesitation. He fumbled slightly, unable top button his polo from three amount his fingers were trembling. This would normally be rectified quickly, with Draco asking for help. Unfortunately Draco was now in his normal space of mind and he soon collapsed on the floor shaking and stuttering out every apology in the book. Tom just now was realizing how bad a space Draco was in.<br/>"It is fine. Hey, you are fine. Can you sit up for me?" Tom waited for Draco to sit up completely. He became aware of a few slytherins moving towards the room, but ignored them. He was in slytherin, and slytherin robes, so it wouldn't matter much. "Good boy," Tom felt Draco's breathing become easier, and less laboured at the praise. Tom breathed carefully, he knew he would be to proceed carefully. The next time he saw Potter, that boy would see just how much of a slytherin he really was. The impression he gave that kid was off, and he would officially be fixing it. He would make that boy fear him.<br/>"Lift your head up for me." Tom food not even wait, knowing that Draco would have a very difficult time following that particular order, he grabbed his jaw,  and lifted it, his nimble finger quickly buttoning his polo without any trouble.<br/>"I'm so-sor-sorry." Draco whimpered. "I-i am re-rea-lly sorry." Tom soothed the boy, pressing his head to his chest, forcing him to listen to the steady thump of his heart. His fingers curled around the back of the child's neck, calming him further.<br/>It was only then that he noticed two slytherins nervously standing just inside the compartment.<br/>--------<br/>When Blaise and Pansy had not seen Draco instantly, they knew something was off. First no owls, then no invites to super meals, now he was missing on the train. Drastic, they both scoured the train relentlessly, unapologetic as they pushed and practically threw people around them in their search.<br/>That's when they found him with...him. they did not know who the dark haired boy was with Draco, but the sheer power and dominance radiating of him was incredibly overwhelming. They both eyed Draco, and understanding descended on them like a splash of icy water.<br/>Draco was being embraced in an extremely possessive, dominating way, one that both Blaise, Pansy, and a few other more older alpha male personas in slytherin had volunteered to learn the hold this boy was currently using, for whenever Draco dropped.  Blaise remembered it as if it were yesterday.<br/>Flashback to 3rd year<br/>Draco? Draco didn't answer. Crabbe poked him again. No response. Draco was pressing his body into a corner of the library, his head was pressing against his knees, his hands were digging into the flesh of his neck. At the sight of blood Crabbe freaked and rushed out, finding the first slytherin he saw. Which just so happened to be Adrian Pucey.<br/>"What's wrong?" Adrian, a fourth year slytherin asked, seeing crabbe's pale face and shaky hands. <br/>"D-Draco." Adrian was instantly on alert. Although Draco could handle himself exceedingly well in a duel, it was well known that he was the most bullied slytherin in Hogwarts, despite the fact that he was a Malfoy.<br/>"What is it? Is he alright?" <br/>"I don't know."<br/>"Take me to him, now." Crabbe turned and rushed back towards the library, Adrian right behind him. <br/>When they reached Draco once more, Adrian was in a state of shock, but he quickly overrode that to grab Draco's shoulders, firmly, and pulling him up. He heard draco whimper pathetically.<br/>"Crabbe, help me take him to professor Snape." He demanded. <br/>When Snape was found Adrian tried handing him off to the young professor. Only, Draco... simply put... panicked. He grabbed onto Adrian, clinging onto him like a life-line. His entire body was shaking uncontrollably. Snape sighed, to Adrian, he instructed however. <br/>"Adrian, I need you to wrap one hand around his torso."<br/>"What?" Adrian sputtered.<br/>"Just do what I say!" Adrian grit his teeth, but did as told. "More firmly, press him closer to your chest, where his head is just over your heart. Good, now with your other hand, I need you to grasp the back of his neck, and hold it with firm pressure." Adrian did so, and he felt bewildered as the moment he placed his hand's gentle pressure on the boys neck, he fell lax against him.<br/>-----<br/>It had been the first time they had needed to learn the pose. Over the next two years, they had used that pose at least once a week, sometimes more. Usually it was Adrian, because he was best, his natural dominating feel seemed best suited for the job but ever so often Blaise or smoother had been forced to do the work.<br/>"I think we have some big things to talk about." The dark haired boy said with a smile</p>
