    <p>The Marauders had always thought it was a Padfoot thing, Sirius’ strong disliking of chocolate. At least, that’s what Remus would say when he couldn’t understand it. “Must be the dog in that boy,” as he’d ruffle Sirius’ hair.</p><p>Peter never cared much for speculation, and, as Sirius would never address it, left it alone much better than James and Remus did. To Peter, it just meant that when Remus split his Honeydukes chocolate bars, Peter got a third of it instead of a quarter.</p><p>Lily always took an interest in the idea of not liking chocolate. “Is it the taste? Or the texture?”</p><p>”S’pose it’s both.”</p><p>Marlene, however, couldn’t believe it. “I mean, it has to just be something he says to be <em>different</em>. You know Black, always has to show off.”</p><p>Now James, well, James was hardly the only one to realize Sirius’ dislike went beyond that, to the point of physical discomfort. No, Peter noticed, but he wasn’t one for confrontation. Remus noticed, as he was the most observant, but he didn’t have anything to say about it, and decided he wouldn’t like where the conversation would go if he did ask about it. But James, brash, loud, proud James decided he must know the reason Sirius would flinch every time a foil wrapper would be torn open in their dorm.</p><p>”Drop it, Potter.”</p><p>”But Paaaaaads,” James would whine. “Who doesn’t like chocolate?! Everyone loves chocolate! Every normal human being on the <em>planet</em> loves chocolate!”</p><p>Sirius, who had been in a particularly bad mood that morning already, stopped cold in his tracks, a bitter laugh escaping his lips. “Well maybe that’s just it, Jamie,” he paused, for emphasis. “Maybe I’m <em>not</em> normal.” </p><p>James’ face paled. “I didn’t— That’s not what— Sirius, you’re perfectly—“</p><p>”I have to go. Detention with Slughorn.”</p><p>”He gave you detention?!” James asked incredulously, jumping up from his seat in the common room to walk Sirius to the exit. “Doesn’t he know you have to study for his exams?! Blimey, what’s the bastard thinking?! The term ends in a week!”</p><p>”Don’t remind me,” Sirius hotly said. He brushed past the other Gryffindor and swept down the stairs toward the dungeons. There he let his mind wander.</p><p>Something flickered in the back of his brain as he thought about chocolate. <em>No</em>, he urged himself, <em>bury it. Bury it beneath the Whomping Willow</em>.</p><p>But Sirius knew how to get passed the tree, and before he could stop himself, the memory was hitting him full force.</p><p><em>A shrill shriek pierced his head. ”Why can’t you be more like Regulus, more like us?! Why can’t you just be </em>normal<em>?!”</em></p><p>
  <em>A dry laugh escaped Sirius’ mouth and a shooting pain went through his side. “Funny,” he managed to get out through clenched teeth. “I didn’t think using the Cruciatus Curse on children was very... normal.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The fifteen-year-old watch as his mother’s face darkened, her voice barely reaching above a whisper, far different from her previous anger. Walburga uttered the spell so quietly that Sirius would have strained his ears to hear the curse, had he not felt it and immediately known what his mother’s wand had cast.</em>
</p><p><em>”</em>Crucio<em>.”</em></p><p>
  <em>Pain coursed through his veins faster than blood did. Immediately, the Black family heir’s body was writhing on the ground. He always held his tongue during Walburga’s punishments, but with the Unforgiveable Curse, when pain overloaded his brain and his senses, Sirius’ mouth always unknowingly fell open as high-pitched screams tore apart the room.</em>
</p><p><em>”</em>Crucio<em>,</em> Crucio<em>, </em>Crucio<em>!”</em></p><p>
  <em>Sirius most likely would have realized he was screaming himself hoarse, but as his entire body felt like it was being stabbed and twisted a million times over, his sore vocal chords had no effect. Even after the curse had been lifted, it took Sirius over a minute to realize he was screaming. His eyes were screwed shut and his entire body felt like it was on fire, but the consistency of the pain dwindled, and slowly he felt himself regaining control of his bodies.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He was hurt all over, and Sirius let his body lie on the ground. Kreacher’s cleaning habits were atrocious and Sirius was covered in dirt and dust. His head was pounding and there was something wet on his upper lip. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>When he finally managed to stop seeing white, Sirius pushed himself off the floor, head reeling, to find himself alone. He touched a spot directly below his nose and when he brought his finger away, found blood. He was staring at the dark substance coat the tips of his thumb and index finger as he rubbed them together when he heard footsteps returning. Careful not to induce horrific vertigo, Sirius did not tilt his chin upwards towards the woman entering.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He heard a crinkle.</em>
</p><p><em>Walburga Black stood over her son, stiffly holding out a chocolate bar, a slight look of disgust on her face as she took in her son’s bloody and dirty appearance. Sirius pressed the palm of his left hand to his lip, attempting to wipe away some of the blood still pouring out of his nose, before using his right hand to gingerly take the chocolate. They both knew, with a flick of her wand, Walburga could stop the bleeding. Instead, she made a ‘</em>harumph<em>’ sound to herself, somewhat prideful—as if anyone could be proud of what she just did—and sarcastic, before turning away from the boy sitting on the floor.</em></p><p>
  <em>”Eat it, it will make you feel better.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sirius’ eyes raised from the chocolate bar to his mother’s back, and his mouth curled in retort. She, however, beat him to the punch.</em>
</p><p><em>”Sirius, you know I’m only doing what I must. I’m doing this </em>because<em> I love you.”</em></p><p><em>The confession hit Sirius over the head, harder than one of her pans would, and the dazed Gryffindor felt a prickle in his eye. He attemted to blink away the tear at her disapproving tone. As much as he hated her, he didn’t </em>want<em> to disappoint her. He didn’t </em>want<em> to disappoint his mum.</em></p><p>
  <em>“You know I’m doing this for you. For your own good.”</em>
</p><p><em> Was that—Sirius swore quietly to himself—was that </em>care<em> in her voice? Was that pain out of </em>empathy<em>?</em></p><p>
  <em>”Now, go clean yourself off quickly. We have guests coming for dinner and I don’t need you,” she paused, looking over her shoulder at the boy with amusement in her eyes, “bleeding all over them.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>And just like that, the subtle gentleness in her voice disappeared. It was as if she had lied to him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Walburga smirked as she walked towards the door, holding it open. ”Well, come on, then, I haven’t got all day.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sirius’ muscles screamed in protest as he stood up, the boy barely managed to keep a limp out of his step as he crossed the room. He met his mother’s eyes and she practically hissed at him. “Eat. It. Sirius.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Trying as hard as he could not to gag, Sirius carefully opened the wrapper and took a miniscule bite. Walburga Black’s eyes narrowed. “And what do we say?” She often treated him like a child, even though he was headed off to his sixth year at Hogwarts, only a few years away from being of  adult age in the wizarding world.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>”Thank you, ma’am.”</em>
</p><p><em>The woman dressed in dark purple nodded curtly and stepped out of the room. Sirius padded close behind, but separated from her as he went upstairs to draw himself a bath. His mother had charmed his bathroom to only run cold water two years prior when Sirius had hexed Kreacher to only say filthy curse words. Usually, he could avoid the freezing water by using Regulus’ shower, but after a torture session—or </em>discipline<em>, as she called it—Walburga kept a close eye on Sirius to make sure he didn’t toe the line.</em></p><p>
  <em>He crumpled himself onto the bed in front of him. Irony blood mixed with the vile taste of cocoa as he took another bite of the candy bar. His mother seemed determined to ruin everything that could bring him joy. No matter how much he detested it, though, Sirius knew he couldn’t throw it away or not finish the chocolate.</em>
</p><p>He’d made that mistake one too many times before.</p>
