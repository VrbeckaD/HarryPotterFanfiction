    <p dir="rtl">Hermione walked through Diagon Alley with Fred and George at her sides. It had been nearly a year since the battle, and the war had been kind to no one. The three friends desperately felt the need to get away from The Burrow and Grimmauld Place. The twins had headed to their shop and Hermione decided to join them to do some shopping of her own. The three were headed to a nearby cafe for a late lunch. Hermione stopped in front of Flourish and Blotts and wondered if they had a new edition of her favorite book. She stood there, lost in dreams of books before George called for her to catch up. Hermione turned quickly to leave and collided with something hard, falling back on her bum.</p>
<p>            "Oh, I'm sorry..." Hermione began to apologize when she looked up and realized who she had walked into.</p>
<p>            "Miss Granger. Surely a witch of your age should be able to watch where she's going?" Lucius Malfoy drawled, looking irritated.</p>
<p>            "You've got some nerve, Malfoy," Fred said helping Hermione up. "Talking to Hermione that way."</p>
<p>            "You know, Hermione's testimony for your wife and son is about the only thing that kept you out of Azkaban." The blonde wizard's expression quickly morphed to one of anger.</p>
<p>            "How dare you talk to me like that?” Lucius paused as if he were contemplating something. “Then again, with parents like yours, it's no wonder you don't have manners." Lucius sneered. The twins angrily drew their wands, and Lucius followed.</p>
<p>            "Now, BOYS..." Hermione stepped between the three men, putting one hand on Lucius' wand, and another on Fred's. "I'm sure we can all be civilized. Mr. Malfoy," she turned to face Lucius.</p>
<p>            "Agreed, Miss Granger. How are you, dear?" He smiled, but Hermione knew how the man worked and was ready to play his game.</p>
<p>            "I am well, thank you. I've been meaning to write to you, actually." The twins stared at her in shock and confusion.</p>
<p>            "Have you?" His silver eyes danced with amusement.</p>
<p>            "Yes." Hermione smiled sweetly. "I wanted to give my condolences about the loss of your wife. I'm sure it was hard for you to lose her so suddenly. Then again, I guess that's just how karma works, isn't it?" Fred and George both gaped at her. The wizard's eyes narrowed and his face grew cold. He stepped forward quickly and wrapped a leather-clad hand around Hermione's neck, hindering her breathing slightly, making her wheeze.</p>
<p>            "Quite the little smart-mouthed bitch, isn't she?" Lucius stepped down and whispered in her ear, "I'm sure the little Gryffindor wouldn't be so brave without her friends though." He pulled back, composing himself. "I must be off. I look forward to our next meeting." He bowed his head to Hermione and continued on down the street.</p>
<p>            Hermione was livid. Not only did he still think he was better than her, but he called her a coward and practically threatened her as well. She turned to the boys.</p>
<p>            "You know what, guys? I forgot I need to go to the bookstore. Go ahead and eat lunch without me. I'll meet you later at the shop." Without another word, Hermione rushed back the way she came from, searching for silver-blonde hair. She spotted him just outside The Leaky Cauldron.</p>
<p>            "Mister Malfoy!" Hermione called out. The wizard turned, caught by surprise. "I apologize for startling you, sir. I just don't believe we finished our conversation." He raised an eyebrow at her, and motioned to the small alley between the buildings, wanting to be clear of the crowd. The alley was only a few feet wide and widened at the end where the trash bins were kept. When Hermione realized how closed off the space was, she instantly felt nervous being relatively alone with a dangerous wizard. Lucius followed silently behind the young witch, his intrigue peaked. As they reached the end, Hermione turned abruptly and slapped him across the cheek.</p>
<p>            "How dare you speak to me that way, Lucius Malfoy! After everything that happened during the war, I could have made sure your sorry arse rotted in Azkaban! Do you really think you're better than me? Do you really think you should be insulting me after I saved your ass and your son's?" The wizard stared at her for a moment, still shocked that the witch had struck him.</p>
<p>            "Of course, I do, Miss Granger." he sneered. "I am the product of hundreds of years of impeccable wizard breeding. You are a fluke in a long line of muggles. I didn't ask for your help during our trials and I'm sure we would have gotten along just fine without your interference" Hermione's eyes burned as he spoke, and Lucius found himself strangely aroused.</p>
<p>            "You smug, arrogant, bastard!" She shoved against his chest "All you bloody death eaters haven't changed."  He glared at her mention of his dark past.</p>
<p>            "You will watch your words and tone with me, Miss Granger, or you will regret it." Hermione's response was to strike him again, but Lucius easily caught her wrist. "I wouldn't try that again, Miss Granger. I have already been far too lenient with you." She used her left hand to try and hit him again, and he caught that wrist as well. "I warned you, you little hellcat." Lucius shoved her against the wall, holding her wrists above her head.</p>
<p>            As Lucius looked into her angry eyes, he found himself losing control, falling into the deep pools of chocolate brown. He leaned forward and pressed his lips against hers. She seemed to respond for a moment, before biting down on his lip, drawing blood. He stepped back, cursing in pain. He looked up at her, ready to yell, and suddenly her hands were in his hair, pulling his lips down against her own. Hermione slid her tongue along his bloodied lip and Lucius groaned in response.</p>
<p>            "What, the big, bad wizard, coming undone at the hands of a mudblood?" Hermione asked sarcastically. Lucius didn't respond, he shoved her against the stone wall, grabbing her bum and lifting her up. Instinctually, Hermione wrapped her legs around the wizard's waist, her yellow sundress riding up, exposing her thighs. He ripped his gloves off and slid his left hand up her soft thigh, stopping at her center to caress her; finding her panties already soaked. Hermione wiggled and he moved, pressing himself against her.</p>
<p>            "Ah!" Hermione cried, grinding against the wizard's erection. He hissed at the action, leaning down to kiss her forcefully. "Spoiled, arrogant, arse!" Hermione hissed moving her hips against him with each word. Lucius heard a tearing sound as he pulled Hermione's dress down, exposing her creamy breasts and hardened nipples. He leaned down, taking one into his mouth and Hermione moaned in response. It only took one tug to tear Hermione's knickers to shreds, instead of taking his time removing them, and Lucius quickly undid his trousers. Just as he was positioning himself, Hermione stopped him.</p>
<p>            "Wait!" She put a hand on his arm. "Let me see it..." He looked up at her in confusion and realized she was staring at his left arm. He pulled back a little, unsure of why she was asking. She pulled at his sleeve, urgently. "Come on, let me see it." He rolled his sleeve up, exposing the faded snake and skull. Hermione stared at it for a moment, then leaned down and licked the length of the dark mark. The erotic action made his cock twitch, and he quickly thrust it into the witch's dripping cunt. Lucius put his hand around her throat, squeezing lightly and Hermione let out a load mewl.</p>
<p>            "All right, my little mudblood princess. You like riding a death eater's cock?" He asked, sliding in and out of her.</p>
<p>            "Oh, yes. Yes. You feel so good." Hermione moaned, meeting his thrusts with her hips. She could feel her core tightening, her release drawing near. "Merlin, fuck, I'm so close..." she gasped</p>
<p>            "No, no, pet. You don't come until I tell you to. Understand?" Hermione nodded, tightening her muscles to fight her building orgasm. He thrust into her, quickening his pace and pushing deeper inside her. Hermione dug her nails into his shoulders, every muscle in her body shaking, as she continued to fight her climax. "Alright, my little pet. Come now." As he spoke, he reached between them and flicked her clit and Hermione's will broke. Her vision went white as her orgasm hit her, stronger than anything she had felt before...</p>
<p>            "Oh! Fuck, Lucius!" She cried. As Lucius watched Hermione's raptured face, her walls clenched around his cock. Her climax and his name on her lips pushed the wizard over the edge, and he came immediately after. The two stayed wrapped around each other, leaning against the wall, while they steadied their breath. Hermione pulled Lucius against her, and kissed him again, passionately; this time all the anger was gone. When he finally pulled out, Hermione straightened herself and repaired her dress. "Well, Mister Malfoy, thank you, for allowing me to finish our conversation. I bid you a good day." With that, she turned and walked from the alley, leaving a bewildered Lucius Malfoy staring after her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">***Meanwhile***</p>
<p>            When Hermione rushed off after Lucius Malfoy's insults, the twins grew worried. Fred and George knew Hermione well, and they knew she was the type to challenge the wizard on her own. It only took them a few minutes to decide to go find her. They walked through Diagon Alley looking for Hermione's chestnut curls. The twins stopped in front of The Leaky Cauldron, thinking they would regroup.</p>
<p>            "Where do you think she could be, Forge?"</p>
<p>            "I dunno, Gred." The twins shared a worried look, but at that moment, they heard a soft voice.</p>
<p>            "Merlin, fuck, I'm so close..." The twins followed the voice and peered down the dark alley, their eyes widening as they watched what was transpiring between Lucius and Hermione.</p>
<p>            "Alright, my little pet. Come now." Lucius Malfoy's commanding voice instructed.</p>
<p>            "Oh! Fuck, Lucius!" Hermione cried out, her body arching as she came. The twins watched, still in shock as Hermione pulled Lucius against her and kissed him passionately. When they separated, and Hermione began to straighten herself, the twins scrambled away from the alley and back towards WWW.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">******</p>
<p>            Hermione entered the twins' shop about fifteen minutes later, a look of confusion on her face as she approached the twins. The shop still said "CLOSED" and the boys were just sitting in the back room.</p>
<p>            "Hey, guys. I thought you were going to lunch? I went to the cafe, but you weren't there. What happened?" The twins shared a grimace and turned back to their friend.</p>
<p>            "I don't know, Hermione, why don't you tell us what happened?" Fred sneered, looking angry.</p>
<p>            "I- I don't know what you mean, Fred." Hermione shook her head.</p>
<p>            "Really? So, where are the books you went to buy, Granger?" George responded. Hermione's eyes widened, unsure of how to answer.</p>
<p>            "Hermione, don't play dumb, alright? It really doesn't become you." Fred spit. "We saw you; we know exactly what happened when you left us." Hermione's face had begun to redden, but she didn't respond. She backed away from the twins, refusing to look at them, and turned to leave.</p>
<p>            "Hermione, wait." George reached out and grabbed her wrist, pulling her towards him. "What's going on?" Hermione blinked, still looking away, silent. "We know you, love, and this definitely isn't normal behavior. Talk to us." Hermione shook her head and pulled away.</p>
<p>            "Damnit, Granger!" Fred yelled, pushing his brother aside, gripping her shoulders and shoving her into the nearest wall. "What the bloody hell is wrong with you?" When she still wouldn't meet his gaze, something inside him snapped. "Fine!" He pulled at the front of her dress and she gasped. George stood, meaning to intervene.</p>
<p>            "Woah, Fred. What are you-"</p>
<p>            "Shut up, George." Fred turned back to Hermione, pressing against her. "Is this what you want, Granger? To be used?" Finally, a reaction, a pain in her eyes. "Answer me, Hermione!" Hermione looked up, finally meeting his eyes, her gaze watery.</p>
<p>            "Yes." she whispered, barely loud enough for him to hear, but it hit Fred like a hex to the chest. He pulled back, as though her skin burned.</p>
<p>            "But.... Why? Why would you want that for yourself?" She shook her head, her tears spilling down her cheeks.</p>
<p>            "You wouldn't understand..." She pulled her dress closed and tried to push him away, but he gripped her tighter.</p>
<p>            "Hermione..." George approached them, concern etched in every part of his face. "Help us understand, then. Please..."</p>
<p>            "Don't you get it?" She cried out "I don't even fucking know why I'm like this, how in the bloody hell could I explain it to you?" She pushed them both as hard as she could, but the twins barely took a step back. "Even if I did, it's not like you would understand. Two perfect fucking twins who can do no wrong! Two brothers who somehow managed to keep their whole family intact during the war, lucky fucking you! You know what, just forget it. Honestly, I'm sorry I came here." Hermione turned to leave and the twins shared a look. She only made it three steps before George grabbed her arm and spun her back around.</p>
<p>            "You're not going anywhere love. Not like this... Come here..." He pulled her close, wrapping his arms around her. The witch tried to battle him off, but he held her tight, murmuring sweetness into her ear. She slowly relaxed against his chest, letting out a sob. "Shh...." George whispered, kissing her forehead. "It's alright, Hermione... We're going to be here for you." He stroked her hair as she continued to cry. Fred let out a sigh, pulling them both into hug.</p>
<p>            "C'mon you two. I think we could all use a drink." The trio headed up the stairs to the twins’ loft above the store. George sat with Hermione on the sofa, his arms still around her, as Fred headed into the kitchen. Hermione's sobs had died out and she let out a hiccup followed by a sniffle. Fred brought back three glasses and a full bottle of firewhiskey. He poured a little for each of them and passed out the glasses, finally settling on the other side of Hermione.</p>
<p>            "Hermione, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have pushed you like that. I just thought it might get a reaction out of you. I'm sorry." Hermione nodded, quickly emptying her glass, which George leaned over and refilled."</p>
<p>            "I'm sorry, you guys. I really don't have a good explanation for you for why I'm acting out. It's just an impulse thing. Ever since the war... I guess I'm just a little fucked up." The twins both nodded. Even though their family was intact, they knew a lot of people had suffered and had issues, much like Hermione.</p>
<p>            The twins spent the entire afternoon, and into the evening, cheering Hermione up. They gave Hermione a t-shirt and sweats and she made herself at home. The three made dinner together and Hermione was quite surprised about how well the boys could cook. After dinner, the twins and Hermione curled up together on the sofa, once more, with drinks in hand. Hermione sat leaning against Fred, her legs on George's lap.</p>
<p>            "Thank you, for being here for me. I know Ron and Harry are my best friends, but ever since the war ended, they haven't been around much. I feel so alone..." The clock ticked on and the three of them sat in silence for a long while before George noticed Hermione falling asleep. Fred fetched a blanket for her while George tucked a pillow under her head. When she didn't stir, the boys headed to bed, emotionally exhausted.</p>
<p>            "Forge, did you have any idea, how badly she's been hurting?" George shook his head at his brother, heading into the adjoining room.</p>
<p>            "I don't think anyone did, Gred. She's kept it all bottled up..." The twins turned out the lights and tried to sleep. While neither of them spoke, they both were awake in the darkness, lost in thought, for a long time before sleep came…</p>
<p>            "No!" The piercing shriek ripped through the flat, jolting Fred and George awake. They each opened their doors and both met in the hall. Fred looked around, rubbing his eyes as George lit his wand. "Please!" They heard another cry.</p>
<p>            "Fuck, Hermione!" George whispered. The twins flew towards the living room.</p>
<p>            "We didn't take anything! We found it! Please!" Hermione was still screaming as she thrashed around on the couch. Fred leaned down, grabbing hold of her arms, trying to still her.</p>
<p>            "Hermione!" George called as she continued to struggle. "Hermione, wake up! It's just a dream!" Hermione sat straight up, letting out a loud gasp, quivering as sweat trickled down the side of her face. She peered up at the two familiar faces.</p>
<p>            "Fred? George?" Her hands were still shaking as she reached out towards Fred.</p>
<p>            "We're here, love." George whispered. Hermione's hands met Fred's hands at the moment George spoke and she let out a loud sigh of relief, leaning her head against George's stomach.</p>
<p>            "Thank Merlin... It was just another nightmare..." She closed her eyes, still gripping Fred's hand tightly.</p>
<p>            "Do you have these nightmares a lot?" Fred asked.</p>
<p>            "All the time." Hermione sighed. "I usually take a dreamless sleep and ward my room before I go to bed at Grimmauld Place. Obviously, I forgot tonight. I'm sorry."</p>
<p>            "Don't be sorry, love." George said, falling to his knees beside the couch. "We want to help, and be there for you."</p>
<p>            "So that includes things like this." Fred finished for his brother, squeezing her hand reassuringly.</p>
<p>            "You should try to sleep, Hermione." George said, rising.</p>
<p>            "No!" Hermione screamed. The twins stared at her, wide eyed. "I… I'm sorry. I just... I won't be able to sleep now. Please don't leave me alone." She whimpered.</p>
<p>            "Alright then," George smiled, scooping her up in his arms. "Let's go." Fred walked ahead of them and quickly transfigured his big bed into an even one larger one. George placed Hermione in the middle and then slid in next to her, Fred taking the opposite side. Fred pulled her back against him as George kissed her hand.</p>
<p>            "Try to sleep, love." Fred whispered in her ear, running his fingers through her curls. She pulled George closer, so they were touching as well, and for the first time since the war, she felt completely safe and whole. The twins were both surprised when less than a minute later, Hermione's eyes closed and her breath steadied...</p>
