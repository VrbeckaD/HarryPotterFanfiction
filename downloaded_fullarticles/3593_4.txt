    <p>“The Fidelius charm on the hideout has been broken,” you snapped, eyeing the other aurors around you. Inside your chest your heart was pounding, but you had a professional mask dropped over your features. “Their secret keeper revealed the information under torture.” Everyone stared silently, heads slightly bowed as they listened intently. “We’re going to apparate inside the house, so be ready for a fight. Use of any force you deem necessary is authorised, but remember the primary goal. Secure Director Graves above all else.”</p><p>You watched them intently, seeing nods and hearing murmurs of agreement. Some looked nervous, shifting from foot to foot. Apparating inside the hide-out of Grindelwald’s fanatics was not a pleasing idea to anyone, but nothing else could be done. Anything else may tip them off.</p><p>You drew your wand from your pocket, drawing strength from the reassuring touch of the familiar wood. Guilt, anger and pain thudded through your veins, thick and heavy. But you couldn’t dwell on it. Swallowing heavily, you pushed it to the back of your mind.</p><p>“Apparate on three,” you instructed firmly.</p><p>Around you, witches and wizards shifted. Fabric shuffled as they pulled their wands free, moving into formation behind you. You stood at the front of the triangular pattern, where Percival would have been had he been there.</p><p>“Two.”</p><p>
  <em> Please be alive, please. </em>
</p><p>“One.”</p><p>A loud pop sounded in your ears, like a balloon bursting. The world twisted for a few nauseating seconds, and then you were standing in a dark, musty living room. In a split second you took in eight figures sitting in armchairs around an unlit fireplace. Hearing your arrival, they instantly sprung to their feet. Shouts rent the air as they scrambled to pull their wands free. Around you, the other aurors appeared with various cracks and bangs.</p><p>“Stupefy!” You yelled, launching a burst of red at the nearest man.</p><p>The force threw him back, slamming in into the wall. He fell, hitting the ground heavily and didn’t move again. You’d already turned away, throwing yourself out of the way as a killing curse came screaming towards you. Your body collided with the ground heavily and you yelled in pain. Twisting, you saw the other man preparing to fire another spell.</p><p>“Accio!” You screamed, pointing at the chair.</p><p>Ripping your arm towards you, you managed to throw the object in-front of the next curse coming your way. It exploded on contact, raining splinters. You threw your hands up, halting them in the air and then sending them flying towards your adversaries. Some leapt out of the way, but three of them became impaled by the wooden projectiles, held against the wall by the force of the impalement. You struggled to your feet, eyes flickering around as the rest of the aurors finished off the remainder of Grindelwald’s followers. Once they were all down, only two left alive being restrained in the corner, did you relax slightly. Dusting down your long coat, you turned towards the others.</p><p>“Spread out. Search the house. Be careful, there may be more of them.”</p><p>They nodded, faces serious as they trooped from the room. Only one stayed with you, the one you could count on most. Tina looked at you with wide eyes, though there was a hint of admiration in them.</p><p>“Good thinking with the splinters,” she said quietly. “He’d be very proud.”</p><p>You dipped your head, feeling a warm lump grow in your throat at her words. Managing a wry smile in her direction, you turned on your heel as you began to inspect the room. Waving your wand, you checked for any signs of incantations or a ward spell. There was nothing obvious, and you chewed your lip in frustration. You were a strong enough witch, your powers being well above average in strength, but if Grindelwald himself had sealed Percival away there was very little chance of you finding him.</p><p>You could hear Tina muttering to herself as she checked the other side of the room, wand running along the walls. You moved around in a counter-clockwise formation, checking each-other’s work for something they may have missed. <em>Nothing</em>. When both of you had canvassed the entire room and still not found anything you felt your heart begin to sink.</p><p>It was only made worse when the other aurors began to return to the room, dejected looks on their faces. You glared at them, refusing to believe it. Your calm demeanor beginning to crack under brewing panic, you snapped. “Check again.”</p><p>Rather than argue, they did as they were told. Once more they came back an hour later, all repeating the same thing. They had found nothing. No trace. He wasn’t there. You shook your head firmly, and pushed past them. You checked every room in the house yourself, from the attic all the way down to the basement. With every passing minute the pit of horror grew in your stomach. Sweat shone on your forehead, and your wand starting to tremble slightly in your hand.</p><p>You were in what would have been the master bedroom, trailing your wand over the wall as your desperate eyes searched for any hint of a spell. The creak of a floorboard had you jump in surprise, wand snapping to point at the door frame. Tina held up her hands, a look of shock on her face. You relaxed when you saw it was her, running a hand across your brow to wipe off some perspiration.</p><p>“Have either of the captives spoken?” You asked, only just realising how hoarse your voice was.</p><p>Biting her lip, she sadly shook her head. “We’ve received word. They’re calling us back to headquarters.”</p><p>
  <em> No. </em>
</p><p>“They can’t call us back!” You exclaimed, placing a hand against the wall to steady yourself. Your legs felt weak all of a sudden. “This place is our last lead.”</p><p>“I know,” she said, looking upset, “but they’ve sent the orders.”</p><p>For a minute, all you could do was breathe heavily. It felt like you weren’t getting enough oxygen, the air rasping in your throat. You glared at the floors, trying to fight back the tears that threatened to overflow. Tina waited for you to speak. In the end, you shook your head and straightened up.</p><p>“Go get your sister.”</p><p>Her eyes widened in shock. “What?”</p><p>“Queenie. Get her. Now,” you repeated through gritted teeth. She just stared at you as if you had gone mad. “That’s an order, Goldstein.”</p><p>Not able to refuse a direct command from her superior, and obviously not ready to give up on Percival Graves either, Tina nodded hesitantly. You had to give it to her, for someone who seemed so timid she had some serious backbone. Her wand snapped out, and she disappeared with a loud crack. You simply waited, staring up at the ceiling and tapping your foot impatiently.</p><p>It didn’t take long. She was back in under a minute, her golden haired sister with her. You nodded at Queenie, knowing that you didn’t have to tell her what to do. She read it off your mind, seeming slightly surprised but then inclining her head. You smiled tightly, happy with her willingness to help. You didn’t have time for threats and persuasion. Any minute wasted was a minute that Percival could die.</p><p>Without a word, she wandered further in the room. She came to rest beside you, gaze turning inwards. She didn’t say anything for a couple of long moment, before her blue eyes came to rest on yours. “Do you mind sending the others away? Their thoughts are very loud.”</p><p>“Of course,” you replied, striding out of the room in an instant.</p><p>The rest of the aurors in the living room turned when you crossed the threshold. They seemed subdued, downcast. Everyone was feeling worried that the Director hadn’t been found yet. You gave them what you hoped was a reassuring smile, but catching sight of your murky reflection in the mirror over the fireplace behind them, you knew it was more of a pained grimace.</p><p>“You are all to head back to headquarters,” you told them softly. “Tina and I will meet you there soon.”</p><p>Some looked like they wanted to question you, but didn’t. You appreciated that. This team you had hand-picked yourself, fully trusting them and knowing they would have your back. Seven aurors, including Tina, all of various ages, races and gender. All firm of character, every single one you could rely on.</p><p>One by one they disappeared, until you stood alone in the living room. Closing your eyes, you listened to the footsteps of the Goldstein sisters on the floorboards above. They were talking quietly, but you couldn’t make out what they were saying. With everyone gone, you could make out the soft, continued ticking of old pipes.</p><p>After taking a few moments to gather yourself, you headed back out into the hallway and padded upstairs. When you reached the landing, they were just coming down from the attic. The sorrowful expressions on their faces told you everything that you needed to know, and you felt the thin hope you clung to ebb away even further.</p><p>“We’ll try the ground floor and basement,” Queenie said softly, dainty hand coming to rest on your arm.</p><p>You nodded, not daring to speak incase your voice broke. Queenie walked in the middle, with Tina on her left and you on her right. No one said anything anymore. You dipped into the kitchen, the dining room, until you stood back in the cob-web covered living room once more.</p><p>In there, Queenie paused, listening intently. Your heart almost stopped beating. After a few seconds, she shook her head. A guilty expression crossed her face. “Must have been someone in the next house…” She said sorrowfully.</p><p>You tried to stop your eyes from filling with tears. The others pretended not to notice you wiping them away with the pads of your thumbs. You checked the rest of the ground floor, before descending to the filthy basement once more. Your nose wrinkled at the smell, and Tina gagged slightly. Queenie just pulled out a perfumed handkerchief and held it to her nose. You didn’t spent long down there, something you were both thankful and pained by.</p><p>Trekking back up the stairs, you faced the terrifying reality that there was nowhere else to check. Nowhere else to look. You’d exhausted all options.</p><p>Percival Graves was gone.</p><p>Unaware that you did so, you stopped in the hallway. Your eyes were fixed on the stained glass window on the front door, the colourful evening sun filtering in. Realising you weren’t moving, Tina and Queenie turned to you. You struggled with words, feeling like you were choking. Finally, you managed to say, “you two go on back. I just… I need a few minutes.”</p><p>The sisters exchanged a look, before turning back towards you.</p><p>“We’ll stay,” Tina said and Queenie nodded vigorously.</p><p>Their kindness had you threatening to burst into tears, so you just nodded and half-ran from them. You didn’t want them to see, anyone see, the level of your grief. Queenie probably knew, had known for a while, but from what you could tell she hadn’t told a soul. No rumour of yourself and Percival Graves had ever circulated the office. Stumbling back into the living room, the place where you’d last felt any real hope at finding him, your legs gave out and you sunk to the moth-eaten carpet.</p><p>Placing your face in your hands, you let out shuddering breaths, trying to keep in control. You couldn’t hear Tina and Queenie talking, only the ticking of those damn pipes over by the fireplace.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p>
  <em> “Here’s your coffee, sir,” you smiled shyly, placing it on his desk. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Percival Graves glanced up at you from the rim of his glasses. He was holding a report in his hand, which he had been reading when you came in. A strand of dark hair fell over his forehead, and you noticed his eyebrows were raised in mild disapproval. You shrank back nervously, wondering what boundary you had accidentally overstepped this time. </em>
</p><p><em> “It was, um, they came around with the cart,” you tried to explain. You were nervously stammering your words and you both knew it. “I figured you looked a bit coffee…. I mean, you looked a bit </em> busy <em> and you probably didn’t notice.” </em> Deep breath. Deeeeeeep breath <em> . “And I know you like your morning cup.” You finished lamely, wanting the floor to swallow you up. </em></p><p>
  <em> For a long moment, Graves just stared at you while you nearly vibrated with anxiety. Before you could lose your nerve and run out of there, he moved. Swinging his legs off from where they had rested on the side of his desk and planting them back onto the ground, he sat upright. The desk chair squeaked under him as he moved. Leaning forward, he wrapped long tanned fingers around the cardboard cup and picked it up. You breathed a sigh of relief when he sipped it and didn’t flinch or anything. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Hands wringing nervously in-front of you, you waited for a reply. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “You should have knocked before you came in,” he told you after a few seconds. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> His intense brown eyes settled on yours, and you swallowed heavily. “I’m… I’m sorry, sir. I wasn’t thinking.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> He didn’t respond for a few more seconds, taking a small drink again. “Be sure to shut the door behind you when you leave.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Yes sir,” you responded meekly, turning to go. Face burning with embarrassment, you crossed the room as quickly as you could. Hand closing on the doorknob, you went to pull it closed. The Director called out to you before you could, and you halted. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Yes sir?” Your palms felt sweaty. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “You don’t have to keep bringing me things to get on my good side. However, coffee is always welcome.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> It was his version of a ‘thank you,’ and you felt a small smile grow on your cheeks. “Understood, sir.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> You went to close the door, when he spoke again. “And _____?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Yes, Director?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “You’re doing well here. Keep up the good work.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">

  <em> Wait… Pipes at the fireplace? </em>
</p><p>Lifting your head out of your hands, you stared before you in confusion. Why would there be pipes in the wall behind the fireplace? You didn’t know too much about housing and such, but something about that just didn’t seem right. Pushing yourself to your feet, you stumbled across the room. Crouching down before the fireplace, you brushed your hair behind your ears and listened, straining.</p><p>Up close, when really paying attention, it sounded different. Not so much like ticking, but more… solid? Almost intentional. And then you gasped, eyes opening wide.</p><p>That wasn’t ticking. That was faint, frantic tapping.</p><p>“Merlin’s beard,” you whispered, shooting to your feet. Turning around, you let out a roar. “<em> Tina! </em>”</p><p>You heard frantic footfalls and the Goldstein sisters ran towards the living room. Staggering backwards, you yanked your wand from your pocket. Pointing it at the fireplace, you screamed. “Reducto!”</p><p>The wall shattered inwards, a cloud of brick and rubble filling the air. You cursed, suddenly realising that exploding a wall inwards may have not been the best idea. Shouting rang out behind you as Tina and Queenie entered the room, but you paid no heed. You raced towards the fireplace, dropping to your knees and scrambling into the hole you had made in the wall.</p><p>Dusty air clouded your lungs and you coughed, feeling sharp edges of brick cut into your palms and your knees as you crawled inside. The air was heavy, and you could barely see. Outside you heard Tina shout a spell, and the musty air was pulled away from you. Blinking tears out of red-rimmed eyes, you made out a slumped figure in the darkness before you.</p><p>“Percival!” You screamed, pushing yourself upright and staggering towards him.</p><p>Dropping to your knees, you grabbed his heads in your hands as gently as you could. He was covered in grime and blood, his head lolling listlessly against his chest. Raising his face to look at yours, you leaned forward to see if he was breathing. A small puff of air against your ears told you he was, and you felt tears of relief begin to stream down your face.</p><p>Gently, you tried to wipe some of the soot and dirt away from under his eyes. He shifted, groaning softly. His lashes fluttered and then deep brown eyes slowly struggled open. Eyes that you had thought you may never see again.</p><p>“______?” His voice was hoarse, ragged. It didn’t even sound like him.</p><p>“Hey, handsome,” you managed to reply over heavy sobs. “Sorry I didn’t knock.”</p><p>A laugh escaped his chapped lips, before his eyes closed and he sunk into unconsciousness again. You checked his pulse, finding it weak, but still there. Scuffling noises behind you had you twist, wand held at the ready. Tina jumped, looking panicked. That was the second time you’d done that today.</p><p>“Sorry,” you whispered, “forgot you were there.”</p><p>“Is it him?” She asked. Her eyes were fixed on his face. You could see a mix of worry, concern and joy there.</p><p>You nodded. “It is, or at least I think so.”</p><p>“We need to be sure,” she replied. “We can’t just bring him back without knowing.”</p><p>Your mouth dropped, aghast. “He’s unconscious! He’s half-dead!”</p><p>“It’s protocol,” she argued. “I don’t like it either, but it’s what we have to do.”</p><p>You stared at her, hardly able to believe what you were hearing. In the end, you could only shrug helplessly. Deep down, you knew she was right. Moving up beside you, she placed a hand on your shoulder.</p><p>“He’s practised occlumency, that’s why Queenie couldn’t get a read on him. You need to ask him a question. Something only he would know.”</p><p>You just stared at her, heart pounding in your chest. There was something you could ask, something that you knew had happened before Grindelwald had taken over. Something that would irrevocably mean it was him.</p><p>You were gentle as you shook him, trying to wake him up. After a few seconds, he did. His bleary eyes fixed on you once again, and you swallowed. Not allowing yourself to glance in Tina’s direction, you spoke quietly.</p><p>“The first time you kissed me, what did I say?”</p><p>Beside you, you heard Tina’s sharp intake of breath. Still, you kept all your attention on Percival’s face. For a second it contorted in confusion and your heart clenched in fear. After a few seconds, he chuckled ever so slightly.</p><p>“That old lady is staring at us.”</p><p>Relief washed through you, making you weak. You leaned forward, touching your forehead against Percival’s chest as you tried to get a handle on your emotions. You felt Tina clumsily patting you on the back, and you straightened up.</p><p>“It’s him,” you told her raggedly, but from your reaction she had already known. “We need to get him back. I… I don’t know if we can risk apparating with him.”</p><p>Tina nodded. “I’ll call. You just sit tight and keep him awake.”</p><p>Technically, it should have been you giving the orders. However, in this one instance you found that you did not mind one bit. Tina moved off, crawling back out of the hole in the fireplace. For a few moments it was just you and Percival.</p><p>“Stay with me, alright?” You told him, stroking his hair with one hand and holding his face steady in the others.</p><p>He smiled exhaustedly, one of his hands coming up to catch yours. You let him entwine your fingers, pushing back on the rush of guilt and apprehension inside you. This moment… You wouldn’t have given it up for anything in the world. But it complicated things, and you were afraid of the time you would have to sit down and tell him everything.</p><p>“I’m glad it was you,” Percival whispered. “I knew it would be you.”</p><p>Biting down hard on the inside of your cheek, you felt blood on your tongue. Despite the pain and inner turmoil, you smiled reassuringly at him. He gazed back, a dreamy look on his face. You realised he was probably concussed along with everything else.</p><p>Another hand landed on your shoulder, and you looked back to see Queenie’s sympathetic face. Of course she knew what was going on in your head. Feeling embarrassed, you shied away slightly from her touch. She removed her hand, obviously knowing she was making you uncomfortable.</p><p>“Oh honey,” she said softly. “If you ever need anyone to talk to…”</p><p>“I’ll be fine,” you snapped, before turning your attention back to the injured Percival Graves.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>__________________________</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>He’d become accustomed to darkness and pain, which was why the lack of it was so disturbing. When he woke up in a hospital bed, he thought it was some sick joke. Either by Grindelwald, or by his own mind. Unable to move, he stared at the white ceiling, blinking heavily.</p><p>
  <em> Maybe he was dead? </em>
</p><p>He could have been dead for a while. He didn’t think he would have known if he was.</p><p>Someone shifted beside him, and a shadow fell across his face. Percival suddenly realised that his hand was clutched in something warm, and he yanked it away in blind panic. Scrambling back across the covers, he saw a silhouette move towards him. The glaring sun behind them blocked out their features, and he found himself cowering away.</p><p>It took a few seconds for him to register the shouting. It was urgent, but the tone was gentle. And the voice… The voice was aching familiar. “Hey! It’s me, Percival. It’s me. You’re alright. You’re safe.”</p><p>You moved closer, hands held out placatingly in-front of you. He could now see it was indeed your face, awash with concern and pain. His chest rose and fell rapidly, his fingers gripping the bedsheets tightly. You stopped, not coming any closer. For a moment you simply gazed at each other. He saw your chest shudder as you inhaled raggedly.</p><p>“It’s me,” you repeated in a near whisper.</p><p>For a long second he didn’t say anything, trying to figure out if this was an illusion or if he had finally gone mad. You simply stayed still in-front of him, not daring to move. He could see tears glistening in your eyes. Searching his mind, he came across a hazy, dim memory of an explosion, and the one face he wanted to see above all others coming to rescue him.</p><p>“Can you… can you close the curtain?” He said, in a voice that didn’t sound like his own. It was weak, fearful. Not the usual commanding tone of the Director of Magical Law Enforcement.</p><p>“Of course,” you replied, and he could see you breathing a sigh of relief.</p><p>You turned, and he could see dust rain off you as you did. It was only then he noticed that you were covered in dirt, bits of rubble mixed into your hair. Glancing down at his own hands, he could see he was spotlessly clean. All the dirt and blood had been washed off. He hadn’t seen his skin like this in so long… It seemed almost unnatural.</p><p>The shriek of the curtain pole had him jump in surprise, and you spun. Seeing his reaction, you winced. “Sorry.”</p><p>For a moment you hesitated, before slowly moving back to the armchair that you had been sitting in. Instead of reaching for his hand, you kept yours placed in your lap this time. He could see white bandages on them, and a small pool of dark blood growing across the white strips. Seeing his gaze, you turned your palms face down against your legs, hiding them. Once more, his eyes flickered up to you. You gave him a tight smile that seemed off somehow.</p><p>“What happened?” He asked.</p><p>“I found you.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>You sighed, rubbing a hand over your face. “We tracked a lead to some old abandoned house. Eight of Grindelwald’s followers were in there, but we took care of them. Kept two alive, but they didn’t give up where you were hidden. We checked all over.” He could see your eyes beginning to fill with tears once again, hear the slight shake in your voice. “We couldn’t find anything. They told us to go home, but I couldn’t just leave. I was… I was about to go when I heard it. Your tapping.” You ran a hand over your face, hiding your expression from him.</p><p>“I don’t remember tapping,” he answered uncertainly.</p><p>You gave him a sad smile, and then leaned forward. He put all his effort into not flinching as you carefully picked up his right hand, furling his index finger so he could look at the tip. Your skin was warm against his, and achingly familiar. Scars covered the top of it, raised and white against his skin.</p><p>“It was nearly destroyed,” you whispered, “all covered in blood. You must have been tapping for <em> weeks </em>…”</p><p>Something inside of you seemed to break. You hunched over, holding his hand against your chest as huge, messy sobs wracked your body. He froze, not knowing what to do. Your entire body shook. Reaching out, he clumsily patted your back.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” you choked out, “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>“It’s alright, it’s okay,” he found himself saying. “I’m back now. Everything will go back to how it used to be.”</p><p>It was meant to be a reassurance, but if anything it only made you more hysterical. Pushing yourself away from him, you curled up the armchair. Your hands clawed at the side of it, nails digging into the fabric as you cried harder than he had ever seen anyone cry before.</p><p>Across the room, a door opened and a healer rushed in. She looked confused when she spotted the source of the noise was not Percival himself, but was you instead. Snapping herself out of it, she rushed to your side.</p><p>“You’re having a panic attack, dear,” her voice was kind, “you need to calm down.”</p><p>You spluttered, eyes streaming and face red as you looked at her desperately. Percival watched, feeling disorientated and helpless as the healer rubbed your back comfortingly, helping you get a handle on yourself. It took around five minutes of gasping and choking before you had regained a relatively normal stage.</p><p>The healer drew away, and you blinked at Percival from red rimmed eyes. Twisting, you seized a tissue from the box on the stand by your chair, and mopped your face with it. Not knowing how to react, he waited. He felt useless. In the past, he would have leaned over and put an arm around your shoulder, maybe even helped you onto the bed and wrapped you in his arms. Now, it seemed like he couldn’t move, like he was stuck there.</p><p>Searching for something to say, he told the truth. “I thought about you the entire time I was in there.”</p><p>You stiffened, face twisting in agony. “Please, don’t.”</p><p>“I’m not lying,” he continued, feeling a bit stronger, a bit more like himself. “You kept me alive.”</p><p>“Stop,” you moaned, covering your face in your hands again.</p><p>“I didn’t tell you. We worked together for years and I didn’t tell you,” he ignored your pleas, how you clamped your hands to your ears. <em> You were back together now. Reunited. Everything could pick up where it left off. </em> “I lo-”</p><p>“He pretended to be you,” you spat out, with a wild look in your eyes.</p><p>He froze, all the air leaving his lungs. You couldn’t meet his gaze, just stared at the ground. Swallowing, he managed to get out one word. “What?”</p><p>“He pretended to be you,” you repeated miserably.</p><p>He had to close his eyes. He felt like he was going to get sick, or he was going to faint. “Did you…?”</p><p>“Merlin’s beard, no I did <em> not!” </em> You exclaimed in disgust. You took a few moments, shaking your head vehemently. “No. Nothing like that. He… He… Ended things with me. When he was pretending to be you.”</p><p>Percival couldn’t move, could barely even think. “When was this?” His voice sounded normal calm. <em> Why did he sound calm?! On the inside, he was anything but. </em> He wanted to punch something, he wanted to scream. Grindelwald had stolen his life.</p><p>“Eight months ago,” you told him sadly, guilt and anger colouring your tone. “I noticed something was off, but I just put it down to… You know. That you didn’t like me anymore.”</p><p><em> Eight months. </em> Percival looked within himself and found he couldn’t be angry at you. He should be. He should be furious. Above everyone else, <em> you </em> should have been able to recognise that it was not him. He had never been a very vocal man with regard to his affections, and you had only been on a few dates, but you still should have known that he would <em> never </em>just-</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” you repeated. “I haven’t slept since I found out.”</p><p>He took a deep breath. You were so sad, hunched in on yourself, with your head hanging and silent tears spilling down your face. Unable to stop himself, he reached out and took your hand. You started, face snapping up to him in surprise.</p><p>“It’s okay,” he found himself whispering. “You didn’t know. But you found me.”</p><p>You smiled shyly, and for a second he was back in the office, seeing that grin for the first time when you were introduced as the department’s newest auror. However, it didn’t hold the same sadness back then. His hand rose, fingers gently stroking your face. Eyes slipping closed, you momentarily leaned into his touch. His thumb brushed your lips, and he shifted a bit closer in the bed, leaning in-</p><p>You shot back, causing him to start in surprise. Percival stared at you in shock, wondering why you had reacted like that. Your hand clapped to your mouth, and you looked like you were about to have another panic attack again.</p><p>“I have something else I need to tell you-” you started, but you were cut off by a loud voice from the door.</p><p>“Darling! Are you alright?”</p><p>Percival’s eyes snapped to the door, wondering why some man he didn’t know was calling him ‘darling.’ When he followed the man’s worried gaze, he found that it rested on you. For a moment his brow crinkled, he couldn’t understand what was happening. And then you rose off the armchair, panicked eyes shifting from him, to the man, and then back again. Suddenly, it started to make sense.</p><p>He felt his jaw set, his fists tightening on the bedsheets once more. You walked towards the man, a strained smile on your face. Percival watched in anger as the man reached up, a concerned frown on his brow as his deft fingers examined the small cuts on your face. Tutting to himself, he pulled you into his arms, pressing a soft kiss on your forehead.</p><p>“I’m glad you’re alright,” Percival heard him whisper.</p><p>You nodded, and the man turned to look at him curiously. Percival shifted, straightening up as much as he could while sitting down. He would have preferred to stand, but he felt a bit shaky and didn’t want to run the risk of embarrassing himself. At that moment he realised he was in a goddamn hospital gown, and the expression on his face became thunderous. He looked utterly weak and ridiculous.</p><p>The man didn’t seem to mind, walking around to offer him a friendly smile and a calloused hand. “Director Graves, I’m sure you don’t remember me. I’m Alistair Night, from the Department of Unidentifiable Magical Objects. We met twice last year.”</p><p>Percival didn’t remember him, and didn’t want to, but he pretended he did for politeness sake. Taking the man’s hand, he shook it firmly, squeezing it as hard as he could without it being obvious that he was intentionally trying to cause pain.</p><p>Alistair winced, taking his hand back and shaking it out with a good natured laugh. “Now, that handshake was something I’m surprised I <em> don’t </em> remember.”</p><p>Behind Alistair, Percival could see you run a hand through your hair. It was a distinct sign of your agitation.</p><p>“Al, would you mind leaving us? The Director and I still have some things to discuss.” You sounded strained, obviously only pretending to be normal.</p><p>Alistair, however, did not appear to notice. “Sure thing, doll. Director Graves, it’s good to have you back. I bet we’ll be seeing a lot more of each other from now on.”</p><p>Percival wouldn’t have thought too much of that remark, except for the way you cringed visibly when Alistair said it. The man turned, and Percival glared daggers into his back. He could feel his teeth gritting when the man pulled you into a hug, moving to place his lips on yours. At the last second, you twisted your head. You eyes fell guiltily on Percival as Alistair kissed your cheek.</p><p>“Bye, darlin’. See you soon.”</p><p>“Bye,” you mumbled, not moving a muscle as Alistair left the room.</p><p>Percival heard his footsteps retreat down the corridor, before raising an eyebrow at you. He didn’t speak, because he knew it he did he may start yelling and not be able to stop. You simply chewed your lip, looking everywhere but directly at him. Your shoulders were tense, hands shoved in your pockets.</p><p>“I was about to tell you,” you eventually said softly, “he just has <em> the worst </em> timing.”</p><p>“How long?” It came out as more of a growl.</p><p>You hesitated. “Three months.”</p><p>“Is it serious?”</p><p>“To an extent.”</p><p>“And what may that be?”</p><p>“I like him,” you replied, looking bitter, “it hasn’t gone as far as you’re asking, but he’s a good man and he’s been there for me.”</p><p>Percival fought the urge to scream. He’d been locked up for months, holding onto the idea that you were out there, fighting to get him back, solely intent on him… All the while you had been gallivanting with some suit from a stuffy department.</p><p>“You have to understand,” you struggled, “after he, you know, ended things-”</p><p>“I don’t want to hear it,” Percival snapped. Fury rolled through him, along with a deep, aching pain in his chest. He felt like he was being torn apart. The pain on your face only made it worse. No matter how upset he was, he didn’t want to hurt you. “Look, I want to leave. Can I just get out of here?”</p><p>“Yes. Per the arrangements we have with the healers, you can leave whenever you’re ready.”</p><p>He closed his eyes. “Good. I want to go home.”</p><p>There a momentary silence. When he opened his eyes, you were shifting from foot to foot uncomfortably. “About that…”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You can’t go back to your apartment.”</p><p>“And why not?”</p><p>“A number of reasons, to be exact. The first being they’re still searching it for any clues on Grindelwald’s next move. The second is that the location of your apartment is pretty much public knowledge now. Despite that, Grindelwald and his followers know where you live, Percival. They could come back. And the last reason is that while they’ve healed your body, they’re not sure about your mental state.”</p><p>“But they’re letting me out.”</p><p>“Because I came to an agreement with them.”</p><p>He bristled, dark eyes flashing. “And what is that?”</p><p>“That you’ll stay with someone. Someone who knows you, who can take care of you.” He saw you swallow heavily, and if possible you began to look even more nervous than before.</p><p>“Who?” He demanded, though he was pretty sure you already knew.</p><p>Your eyes dropped to your shoes. Speaking so quietly that he could barely hear you, you softly said, “me.”</p><p><em> No. </em> He hadn’t realised he said it out loud. “Why would you even think that was a good idea?”</p><p>“I guess I was just hoping that you’d be alright with it.”</p><p>“No. That’s not happening.”</p><p>“Everything has already been arranged. All of the other aurors have assignments. They don’t have the time. No one knows you like I do, can see problematic changes.”</p><p>Vehemently, he shook his head. “No. I’m not staying with you.”</p><p>“Percival…”</p><p>“Bring me the Vice Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,” he snapped, turning away. “I’m sure we can work something else out.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Crossing his arms, he glared resolutely at nothing. He knew that he was acting difficult, but he fully felt he had reason to be. And he had never been a particularly easy man to deal with in the first place. Silently, he waited for you to get up and fetch whoever his second in command now was. When you didn’t move, he looked at you in annoyance.</p><p>You simply sat there, an awkward smile on your face. For a second, he continued to gaze at you, wondering why you weren’t moving. Slowly, he felt horror grow over him. <em> No. This wasn’t happening. </em></p><p>“You?!”</p><p>“Guilty as charged,” you sheepishly waved.</p><p>“When?”</p><p>“Fairly recently. After we discovered Grindelwald wasn’t who he said he was, he took out a few people on the way out. Frederick was one of them. They promoted me in his stead.”</p><p>“Well, you were always on your way there anyway,” he complimented gruffly, before he could stop himself.</p><p>This time the smile you gave him was genuine. It swiftly faded from your face, and you sighed loudly. “I’m sorry, Percival, I really am. But everything has been organised. You’re coming with me or you’re staying in hospital.”</p><p>You knew he wouldn’t stay here. He was too proud, and wouldn’t want to appear weak. Still, it slightly hurt you to see just how much he didn’t want to come with you. Averting your gaze, you waited for him to answer.</p><p>“Fine. I’ll stay with you. But as soon as I’m free to go, I will.”</p><p>You wanted to go to him, to pull him into your arms and bury your face in his chest. You wanted to tell him that you were sorry and that you’d missed him, and the only reason you’d moved on was because Grindelwald’s Percival made it easier to. Fear that he would push you away stopped you from doing all that. Your ignorance, it seemed, had made quite the mess of everything.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

  <em> “Director!” Your hand flew to your chest. “Merlin’s beard, you almost gave me a heart attack!” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> He was standing at the street corner behind you, illuminated by the street light. His dark eyes were intent on you, and for once he was showing emotion. A grin crossed his handsome face, amusement glinting as he watched you. Unable to be annoyed at him, you chuckled, straightening your clothes. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “My apologies,” he replied smoothly. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> You stared at him inquisitive, eyes shifting up and down the street before returning to his face. His expression once more became impassive as you began to examine him. He was hard to read, but you were getting better at it and you knew he was uncomfortable. Somewhat enjoying the fact that for once you had him on edge, you grinned at him and crossed your arms over your chest. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Mister Graves, were you following me?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> He hesitated, and after a moment nodded. “I meant no harm. I simply saw you leave the office, and noticed that you hadn’t apparated. These are dangerous times. I wanted to make sure you got back alright.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> You were slightly taken aback. “I wanted to enjoy the nice night we were having. And that’s… That’s very kind of you, sir.” He shrugged nonchalantly, but his appreciation of your praise was obvious by the upwards curve of his lips. “But how about you walk with me instead of lingering the shadows?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Pretending to consider it for a moment, he let out a slight chuckle. You smiled encouragingly as he stepped away from the wall, moving up to stand beside you. Together, you began to walk leisurely through the streets of New York. It was fairly quiet, even for night time. Instead of letting silence rule, you filled the air with chatter, talking about whatever you could. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Out of the office, Percival Graves was a lot less uptight. He seemed a bit easier to smile, to make conversation a bit more easily. You’d been working with him for three years now, and while he was a lot less formal with you than when you’d met him, you still didn’t know him all too well. While you had grown fond of him, it was indeed strange to spend one on one time with him. Whenever the department group went out, he opted not to go. This was… extremely unusual, but not entirely unwelcome. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> You reached your apartment earlier than you found you’d have liked to. Removing the keys from your pocket, you hesitated. Eyes flickering to him nervously, you weren’t sure if what you were going to say would be well received. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Mr Graves, would you like to come in for a drink?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Call me Percival. And yes, I would enjoy that very much.” </em>
