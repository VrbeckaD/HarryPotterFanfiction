  <em>1980-1981</em>
</p><p>In another version of the story, whispered the centaurs, who could read the stars and spoke truths humans knew not, Lily Potter would bring a boy named Harry Potter into the world on July 31, 1980.</p><p>In this world, the baby was named Rose instead, and not much was different at first. Rose was loved, that much was certain. She had her mother, who would sing her to sleep every night and charm all of her stuffed animals to dance along. She had her father, who would follow close behind as she flew through the house on her kiddie-broom and transfigure all the vases she broke back together. She had Sirius, who much to Lily’s behest, would regale Iris with tales of all the mischief James and him had gotten up to back at Hogwarts. She had Remus, who would read her stories from Beedle the Bard, and Peter, who still wasn’t quite sure how to hold a baby but was making a valiant effort. She had Alice Longbottom, who would bring Neville once a week for playdates, and Marlene McKinnon, who said that she never wanted children of her own but that seeing Iris almost made her reconsider.</p><p>There was still a prophecy, except this time it said child instead of boy.</p><p>Severus Snape still repeated this prophecy to Voldemort, not realizing until much too late that it would guarantee the death of the only person he ever loved.</p><p>In this world, Tom Riddle spent a little longer deliberating who the child in the prophecy was. After all, would a pureblood, traitor or not, truly dedicate their life to ensuring Tom’s downfall when they could find greater success far more easily by his side? A mudblood mother added a motive, but almost all of the girls he had ever met were quite stupid, giggling at everything he said because of his cheekbones, never able to get anything done on their own, always crying the moment they saw the cruel glint in his eyes. It was Bellatrix Black, later Lestrange, his fiercest and most competent Death Eater, who was able to convince him that the chosen one could be a girl. Bellatrix didn’t giggle at anything. She laughed, a violent guffaw, and only at acts that would make most sane witches turn around and vomit. She was able to get quite a lot done on her own, like murdering mudbloods in muggles and torturing blood traitors, always in new and creative ways. And, perhaps most notably, Bellatrix had only cried once since the day she joined him. Not when her beloved sister sent an owl telling her and Narcissa that she had left the family for good, not when she saw people she had known since she was a child murdered, not when her healer told her she was infertile and would never be able to produce a pureblood heir had maybe once considered friends, and most certainly not any of the times he had performed the Crutacius Curse on her. “Can you even cry?” he had asked her once, careful to make it seem like he was mocking her heartlessness and not asking a question out of genuine curiosity. Bellatrix’s eyes welled up with tears, without even a muscle on her face moving at all, and proceeded to have the calmest cry he had ever seen. Tom considered himself very fortunate to have Bellatrix on his side of the war. He had never really considered the idea that she could defeat him, but he supposed a witch like Bellatrix, intelligent, powerful, crazy, except with a vengeance against him instead of muggles, might have a slim chance of defeating him if she was able to catch him at a vulnerable moment and had previously ensured the destruction of his Horcruxes. So, of course, he still chose to hunt down Iris Potter before she had the chance to become a threat.</p><p>In this world, Peter Pettigrew may have hesitated a few moments longer when Voldemort asked him where the Potters were hiding, as there is nothing men find more innocent and worth protecting than a baby girl, but he knew that Voldemort would simply torture him if he refused to answer, and this was the one chance Peter had ever been given to make something of himself.</p><p>Severus Snape still bowed at Voldemort’s feet and asked him to please spare Lily Potter, and Tom Riddle still decided his faithful servant should be rewarded for his loyalty, and there wasn’t too much harm in giving him a mudblood pet.</p><p>Tom Riddle still broke down the door in Godric’s Hollow on October 31,1981, loudly interrupting what looked to be some sort of sad Samhain feast of only 3. Lily grabbed Rose and ran up the stairs faster than she had ever run before, and James made a very stupid attempt to punch Tom. The Avada Kedavra fell out of his lips, Unforgivable Curses more natural than any other words these days, before James’ fist could collide with his nose, and his dead body quickly slumped to the ground. He took his time walking up the stairs, fully aware that the strong wards placed on the property would prevent Lily from being able to apparate. What the wards hadn’t prevented, however, was Lily opening the window and sticking her leg into the cold autumn air.</p><p>“Foolish witch!” he spoke, enjoying the look of horror on her tear-stricken face. “You cannot escape from the Dark Lord Voldemort!” He gave her three chances to surrender her daughter, but Lily Potter seemed utterly determined to die. <em>Oh well</em>, he thought to himself, <em>Severus will recover</em>. Lily slumped to the ground just like her husband. Tom Riddle was no longer a man, had lost his last vestige of humanity years ago, and as such did not hesitate to cast the Killing Curse. The girl’s face hardened into an expression that was utterly horrifying on a baby, and her eyes seemed to gain decades all in an instant, but she was most definitely not dead. Rose Potter looked back at Tom as the green light bounced right off of her forehead, and for a brief instant he felt fear like never before <em>No no no how is this possible?</em> Then the pain, unimaginably wretched, Death trying to reap a soul that was still tethered to the world, a tug of war of sorts, and Tom Riddle’s body fell to the ground while the rest of him faded into something less corporeal than even a ghost and was promptly ejected far, far away from Britain.</p><p>Tragically, Rose Potter would never remember being so loved, would only remember a flash of green, the sound of a grown man sobbing, and then a decade of misery.</p>
