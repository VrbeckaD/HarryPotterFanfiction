    <p>Oh god. Someone, <em>please</em> tell you how you got here. </p><p>Your wrists are getting rope burns from squirming too much (you might’ve made a joke about aha, <em>kinky, </em>if you weren’t so confused), and you can probably break them— Surprise surprise, all those years forced to do fieldwork wasn’t so useless after all, you can probably untie the knot—</p><p>“Hi,” a woman abruptly says as she bends down in front of you. Everything about this woman is imitading— Leather jacket, short hair, dark— <em>fierce </em>eyes. And oh, that wand pointing at you. The hand is firm and the position is solid. </p><p>“Hi?” you attempt, but it comes out like the squeal of a dying whale and ends in a questioning tone.</p><p>“My name is Tina Goldstein. I’m an American Auror,” she says. “And I need you to help me catch Grindelwald—”</p><p>Your eyebrows shoot up so high you suspect they might have found God. </p><p>“Wait, wait wait,” a male voice joins the conversation. A man with tousled red-hair and a face dusted with freckles holds up his hands. He’s cute, in an unassuming way. “Shouldn’t we untie her first?” he asks. “We are, uh, asking her for help…”</p><p>“Newt,” the woman— Tina, Tina Goldstein begins. Her head is cocked and her words are said very deliberately. “We still don’t know if she’s a threat—”</p><p>“Uh,” you wave awkwardly. “I’m still here?” </p><p>Two pairs of eyes find you. Then to Tina. Who sighs with a hint of murder.</p><p>Clearing her throat, she starts again, “As Mr. Scamander was saying, we are in need of your help to capture the dark wizard Grindelwald and find a boy named Credence Barebone.” She looks at you with those fierce eyes of hers, glittering with something like trapped firelight. </p><p>She had you lost at the ‘help’ part. Weren’t you already helping? Why did she think you of all people could help? Also— “Just a question,” you say as they both nod. “Scamander, as in— <em>Theseus Scamander?”</em></p><p>The man looks mildly surprised. Boyish features pulled into puzzlement. “You know him? He’s my brother.”</p><p>If anything, you’re name has now just become Perpetual State of Confusion.</p><p>x</p><p>
  <b>EIGHTEEN DAYS EARLIER</b>
</p><p>Hot breath against the side of your neck, hands threaded into your hair and pulling you against him. Teeth bite, scraping against the skin of your neck, hard and bruising, you scrabble for a grip on his shoulders, pulling at the broad shoulders and the crisp shirt jacket.</p><p>Teeth clang against yours and he pulls on your hair — gentle enough not to hurt but firm enough to let you know what he wants. Slipping his leg between yours, he shoves you forward for a few quick steps and hauls you up against the wall. Moaning, you ball up the edge of his shirt as he continues to ravage your mouth. Your lungs burn, and abruptly you realize this is <em>wrong</em> as you push away against his chest—</p><p>Somewhere distantly, a door slams open followed by a few angry voices.</p><p>
  <em>“Of all the people you could possibly ask, Theseus—“</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“No, no, it has to be her, she’s the only one I trust with stuff like this—“</em>
</p><p>And then the door to the records room slam open, and with an ungraceful yelp, you tip backwards in your chair as you try to stack your papers into a pile before tumbling onto the ground. You take a pile papers down with you, and nervously, you give the one in front of you a shifty glance before snatching it off the ground.</p><p>“Uh, hi?” you offer, clutching the paper to your chest as you resist the urge to look at the pile of scattered paper around you. <em>Ah, you shouldn’t have been meddling with those reports on the Nundu terrorizing muggle hunters today—</em></p><p>Torquil Travers gives you a look of immense resentment and promptly heads out the door with a raised chin and an air of pompous superiority. You narrow your eyes and the next thing you hear is a sound of yelped pain.</p><p>“I didn’t train you in wandless magic just to have you terrorizing coworkers, [Name].” </p><p>You turn your head and raise it toward him. “I’ve known how for—” You shut your mouth with an audible click and offer him the most innocent smile you can. “Sir, yes sir,” you say, automatically resorting to the sentence because of the awkwardness. <em>Ha, anything to get out of getting reassigned to field ops. </em></p><p>Theseus Scamander raises an eyebrow before his eyes crinkle and he gives you a fond smile. “Easy there,” he teases you. “We both know you don’t work for me anymore.”</p><p>And thank the everloving God for that— You weren’t one for crushes, and infatuations came and left with the blink of an eye. But <em>Theseus— Theseus Scamander: </em>renowned world hero, charismatic (bastard with a sadistic work streak) Auror who can get just about anyone to compromise for him is completely different. And the fact that he was those things wasn’t even the thick of why you adored him. It was because of <em>Theseus</em>, and as cliche as it was, it was because of the passion he held in his work, the midnight oil you burned together and him diving desperately into any situation to save lives. </p><p>Having a crush on him was sort of like being in love with a celebrity (yes, you had a healthy dose of muggle media as a child) when you were a teenager and calculating the age difference because <em>ha</em>— As if <em>that</em> was the biggest obstacle.</p><p>(Also, there was also Christmas Party last year where you had gotten too bold, too drunk and— Well, let’s not have a repeat of that.)</p><p>You smile, if a little dryly. “Yes, which is why you’re dropping by <em>here</em>, a full four floors away from <em>Law Enforcement</em>.”</p><p>“Hey,” he protests good-naturedly as he leans down and you freeze, for a second, until he wraps his long fingers around your forearm and pulls you up. “Can’t I visit an ex-subordinate every now and then?”</p><p>
  <em>Why don’t you visit the guy who got demoted because you caught him slacking off on the job every now and then, too? </em>
</p><p>You brush him off, ignoring the red shade your face was slowly adopting. “If you wanted me to find something, you can just, uh, sent me a letter.”</p><p>He tucks his hands into his pocket and leans onto your desk as you finally take out your wand and resettle your chair, as well as all of the scattered paper across the floor, making sure to place the illegals ones as far away from Theseus as possible.</p><p>“You see, I need your help for some… Confidential matters,” he tells you. </p><p>You cross your arms. “I don’t do fieldwork anymore, boss. Sorry, maybe ask… I dunno, Wesley from your <em>own </em>department?” </p><p>He laughed and returns his gaze to you. He shifts, and the afternoon light from the window bathes him in soft light. “Travers said the same thing, you know,” he says lightly. “But the only one I can trust to do this is <em>you</em>.”</p><p>Your eyes narrow. “If I say no?”</p><p>Humming good-naturedly, Theseus walks around you and towards the other side of the table in the Record’s Office. Before you can protest, he reads one off. “<em>Potential Obscurus-Containing Households,</em> do you know what happens to people who possess confidential records outside of their jurisdiction?” He waves the paper around.</p><p>A moment of silence.</p><p>You brighten. “Does that mean you’ll finally fire me?” </p><p>“<em>[Name].”</em></p><p>You really wish he would stop saying your name like that—</p><p>“Oh wait,” you suddenly realize. “I could get stuffed in Azkaban for that.” </p><p>“[<em>Name]</em>,” he says again. “I’m asking this of you because I trust you. I know you despise fieldwork and what happened— Is… Well… But I <em>need</em> to know that someone I can count on to keep my back is on this mission.”</p><p>Oh dear, your black little heart actually does a little flip at those words.</p><p>But— You’re not stupid. There are a thousand people out there who are more qualified than you are, who can be counted on not to let their emotions affect their work and people who don’t kiss their engaged boss at a Christmas Party because they’re drunk. Being in love with Theseus— Being in love with a <em>taken</em> man had consequences and that night last year you told yourself that you weren’t going to make someone else suffer because of you and requested for a transfer. </p><p>Though, then again, were you really going to refuse him? Theseus, <em>hand on your waist, hand on your elbow as he tries to teach you wandless magic in a hushed murmur by your ear. </em>Theseus, who jumps into danger without a second thought because of that proud, righteous justice—</p><p>You owe him this. Not just because of that kiss, but for all the years he’s been looking out for you and all the things he’s taught you.</p><p>“Okay,” you say, chin raised, already dreading whatever’s coming. “I’ll help you.”</p><p>He beamed and lifts himself up from his desk to his full height. “Splendid,” he says and begins towards the door. Not before wrapping his hand around your wrist and pulling you with him.</p><p>You flail. “What’s this,” you gesture at the hand holding your wrist.</p><p>He gives you a stare. “I told you, it’s an operation of the highest degree of confidentiality—”</p><p>“Oh, did you now? I must’ve missed it.”</p><p>“—And I can’t discuss it with you until we’re in a secure location where I can be sure there is no third party.”</p><p>You give him a glare. “I <em>do</em> understand protocols— I have been working here for the last eight years. But <em>why</em> are you gripping my wrist like you’re trying to apply for a position as a human handcuff?”</p><p>He gives you a wicked stare that makes you weak at the knee. You stumble a bit, but Theseus just releases your hand lightning fast to catch you at the shoulders then return to gripping it. “So you can’t run.”</p><p>“<em>What?”</em> You give him a stare of utter betrayal. <em>No, nope, nope— Sweet Merry Lewis this was a mistake.</em> “You know,” you say weakly as he continues to smile. “I think I hear my mother calling for me.”</p><p>All coherent thought fades as he hushes you with a finger to the lips (and hear that— it’s you dying yonder) and all your retreat-route planning activities cease entirely. </p><p>The two of you step into the elevator. There are dozens of people, as usual, making you unnecessarily close to Theseus. Due to your small height, your temple is basically pressed against his chest. You lower your head, hair falling into your face as Theseus remains tall with back-straight confidence as one of his hands are in his pocket while another continues captivity over your wrist. </p><p><em>I should stop reading muggle romance novels, </em>is what you manage to take away from your elevator ride together.</p><p>Immediately, the chatter of the Law Enforcement Dept. greet you, and the extrovert inside you bloom as you see a few familiar faces you haven’t seen in a while. Admittedly, you’d been less than sad when you were finally taken off the field ops. roster and given a stable desk jockey position in the records, but you certainly missed your friends.</p><p>“Sir—” One of them greets Theseus before they brighten as they see you. “Unofficial Former Great Leader!” Aurelia Henley beams as she sees you. Standing up, she bounds up to you quickly. “Are you finally coming back? Finally got tired of those stuff parchments, haven’t you?” And then she winks and bumps your hips together lightly. </p><p>“Aw,” you grin. “I missed you too!” You try to shake Theseus’ handoff, when you fail, you offer him a nasty look that he only offers you a half smile in return and taps his pocket watch. </p><p>By the time you turn back, Aurelia has adopted a sly, understanding grin on her face. “Well,” she says cheerfully with Cheshire smirk, “I won’t keep you. <em>Do</em> have a <em>very</em> lovely day, sir.</p><p><em>Good luck, </em>she mouths as she returns to her desk. </p><p>“Traitor,” you mutter beneath your breath lightly. If Theseus understands what your friend had been implying, he doesn’t offer any indication. A few others greet you afterwards, but despite your best efforts to stall, Theseus drags you to your destination in record time. The two of you pull up at the familiar door of his office.</p><p>It swings open to greet the two of you and slam shut when you’re finally inside. You’re pretty sure it’s locked and even an <em>Alohamora</em> won’t be able to unlock it.</p><p>It’s then Theseus finally releases you. You break away from him, desperate to put some space between the two of you. </p><p>“Well,” you ask. “What was so bloody important that you needed to drag me <em>here</em>?”</p><p>“Oh, I just need you to help me find the dark wizard Grindelwald and capture him. That’s all.”</p><p>You make a break for the exit, lock door be damned.</p>
