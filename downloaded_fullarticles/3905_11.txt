    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>In Brussels, Belgium a pub was tucked away between a post office and an inn. Staying at that inn was a woman with dark, curly hair and a fair face, and her daughter. The daughter had similar hair, unless she was feeling particularly emotional, yet their nature and demeanors were quite different.</p>
<p>One was harsh and cold, with a sharp tongue. The other confident, albeit quick-tempered, and not as unwelcoming. </p>
<p>It was a brisk summer night and the mother was meeting a group of old friends. They were planning a surprise for the Ministry of Magic and the daughter quickly left the room as smelly, horrid people began to pour into the room.</p>
<p>She looked at the tattoo on one man’s forearm that matched hers, when she was not hiding it. She smiled to herself. Most mothers would never let their daughters get a tattoo, much less force it upon them. It hadn’t hurt as much as she was expecting what with it being dark magic.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes later the daughter found herself standing outside the door of the room.</p>
<p>“My mother broke out of Azkaban at the height of the war.” The mother hissed.</p>
<p>“Shit… this ain’t 30 years ago when we ‘ad the ministry run’n scared, is it? Saint Potter’s put everyone ‘way and those he ain’t, are too scared to do anythin’ bout it.” A man with a heavy cockney accent, and an even heavier stench, snarled back.</p>
<p>“Which is exactly why we must do this.” A man said in a proper voice. “Our friends, our family, all locked away in Azkaban. It is time to put mudbloods in their place and take back what belongs to us.” There were some agitated grunts of agreement and some murmurs.</p>
<p>BOOM!  The girl ducked as the wall exploded and dust clouded the air, providing cover for her.  Mother! She wanted to shout, but she knew better than to alert the Aurors to her presence. </p>
<p>“Expelliarmus!” “Avada Kedavra!”</p>
<p>“Stupefy!” “Sectumsempra!”</p>
<p>It was clear who the Aurors were and who the death eaters were just from the spells they cast. The daughter ran down stairs, wand in hand as other wizards were trying to escape as well. More people, clearly death eaters, were battling a couple of witches and wizards in the pub. There was a dead woman lying on the floor and no blood.  The woman had been the barkeeper under the Imperius curse. </p>
<p>The girl ran across the street where people were literally fleeing for their lives because the death eaters began targeting anyone who got in their way. As more death eaters were captures by Aurors, some stated to apparate. In a few minutes there were no more spells being cast and all death eaters were subdued or unconscious.</p>
<p>She saw her mother being taken and felt guilty when relief seeped into her emotions.</p>
<p>“Hey, you there!”</p>
<p>She jumped about two feet in the air when a voice shouted to her.  Her first reaction was to apparate, but the Aurors would know that she was under aged and therefore doing something illegal.  She could’ve cursed them, but she froze, all of her training leaving her in that moment. </p>
<p>“Ron! Don’t yell at her! She’s obviously terrified.” Another man berated the red haired Auror. They walked a bit closer to her, so they could speak without yelling.  Before they reached her, she changed her face slightly so they wouldn’t notice the resemblance between her and her mother.  She made her cheeks slightly rounded and her facial structure less… harsh. </p>
<p>“Are you alright?” The man with an Irish accent asked.</p>
<p>Her eyes widened.  Should she talk to them? No. And yet, there was no way to not answer, unless she pretended not to speak English.  In the end, she figured it was best to cooperate and hope they wouldn’t torture her.  “Yes…who are you?” The girl asked.</p>
<p>“My name is Seamus Finnegan and this is Ronald Weasley.” He motioned to the red haired man.  Her eyes narrowed at the mention of a Weasley, feel disgust gather in her throat.</p>
<p>“What’s going to happen to me?” Her lip quivered as she did not realize they didn’t know her mother was a Death Eater. </p>
<p>“Are you parents here?” Mr. Weasley asked. Her lips parted in surprise.  Did they think she was here on vacation?  </p>
<p>“I don’t have parents.” She replied, looking at the ground.  So they didn’t know who her mother was and now she had to lie and manipulate her way to freedom without the Aurors questioning why she was a fourteen-year-old wandering around without freedom. </p>
<p>Technically not a lie, she thought to herself.</p>
<p>The two men looked at each other and then a woman called to them.</p>
<p>“We’ll be right there.” Mr. Finnegan shouted back to her. “What’s your name?” He asked the girl.</p>
<p>“Atria,” She responded slowly, “Atria Williams.” That’s a nice neutral last name.  She shouldn’t have told them her first name, but she didn’t want to appear as though she was hesitating and she couldn’t think of a first name fast enough. </p>
<p>“Do you remember anything that happened? Any details that might help us?” Mr. Weasley asked with a slightly interrogative tone.</p>
<p>It occurred to her then they thought she was a muggle.  The idea horrified her, as if she could ever be a muggle. </p>
<p>“You won’t have to Obliviate me, if that’s what you mean. I’m not a muggle.” She responded indignantly. Mr. Finnegan laughed while the blood traitor turned slightly pink in the ears. Atria pressed her lips together as if she thought better of insulting an Auror.</p>
<p>“How old are you?” Mr. Weasley asked.</p>
<p>“Fourteen.” Atria replied, a bit coldly. She was frustrated by the fact that they were treating her like a child.  And she didn’t want to talk with mudblood sympathizers any longer than was necessary. </p>
<p>“Where do you go to school?” Mr. Finnegan asked curiously. His tone was not as babying as Mr. Weasley’s had been.</p>
<p>“Nowhere.” She whispered. Are they going to ship me off to school? Atria wondered. They can’t do that, can they?  </p>
<p>“Would you come with us Ms. Williams?” Mr. Weasley asked.</p>
<p>“Are you going to make me go to school?” Atria chewed on her lip. That was the least of her worries in the grand scheme of things, but the idea of going to school was terrifying.  </p>
<p>“Not right now. You know, since it's summer.” Mr. Weasley chuckled at his little joke and Mr. Finnegan and Atria glanced at him with a mildly disgusted look.</p>
<p>The woman who had been calling their name previously came over and pulled the two men aside. Perfect chance to escape, Atria thought. They returned a moment later though and the woman began speaking to her.</p>
<p>“Ms. Williams, we would like you to return to the Ministry of Magic with us so that you can relay details of what happened before our Aurors infiltrated the inn.” The woman said is a soft, yet commanding voice. She seemed more put together than either of the men.  And she also seemed like she wouldn’t take no for an answer.  Atria thought about arguing, but thought better of it when the woman gave her a hard look. </p>
<p>“Uh… sure. Not like I have anything better to do.” Atria muttered, hoping that if she went along with them, they wouldn’t suspect her.</p>
<p>A little while later, although it felt like forever to Atria, she took Mr. Finnegan’s hand and he told her to brace herself. She had apparated before so the puking sensation was not entirely new, but then remembered that this man probably wasn’t a pureblood and that made her want to gag even more. </p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</p>
<p>“So what are we going to do with her?” Harry asked Ron.</p>
<p>“Dunno mate.” Ron shrugged. “Figured the first step was to get her back here and find out what happened before we attacked… if she knows anything” They both glanced at the door where Atria Williams was being questioned.</p>
<p>“It seemed like they knew we were watching. The other Death Eaters were waiting for us to attack the ones in the inn, and then they snuck up on us. Caught us from behind.” Harry said, deep in thought.</p>
<p>There were very few Death Eaters left and it wasn’t a huge deal that they were gathering but it still didn’t sit right with Harry.  There had always been murmurs and meetings about the old days and pureblood superiority, but rarely were any attacks or threats ever carried out.  And there was no proof that any of the few attacks were leading to a larger cause. </p>
<p>“Yeah, and they had the place charmed so that we couldn’t pick anything up with the Extendable ears. It happened so quick we didn’t even see who the other Death Eaters that bolted were.” Ron said as Seamus came out of the room where Atria was.</p>
<p>“Guess what?” Seamus said excitedly.</p>
<p>“She saw all of their faces and named every Death Eater, so now we can go get them and lock ‘em in Azkaban?” Ron said hopefully.</p>
<p>“Eh… no.” Seamus said in a rather comical tone. “She’s a metamorphmagus.”</p>
<p>“What?” Ron and Harry said at the same time, both of their mouths hanging slightly open. </p>
<p>“Yeah, so I was asking her about the Death Eaters and—“</p>
<p>“Are you lot calling them ‘Death Eaters’ again?” A commanding voice said.</p>
<p>“’Mione, just because they haven’t formally announced themselves—“</p>
<p>“Ronald, you know very well we have no proof they are connected to Voldemort.” Hermione Weasley scolded. Harry rolled his eyes, not believing they weren’t Death Eaters. “All we know is that they are magical radical extremists connected to several violent crimes across Europe.”</p>
<p>“Of course, Hermione, but it takes so much time to say ‘magical radical extremists’.” Harry said with a straight face.</p>
<p>“Children, please.” Seamus put his hands out in a calming motion. “As I was saying—I was taking her through the evening's events and her hair turned bright red—“</p>
<p>“What?” Hermione gasped, “Whose hair?”</p>
<p>Seamus sighed impatiently. “If I could just get through the bleeding story”</p>
<p>He paused to wait for anymore interruptions.</p>
<p>“So I was taking Atria, the girl we picked up from the scene, through today’s events and her hair turns bright red, I looked shocked I’m sure, and she says ‘yeah that happens sometimes’.” He finished in a rush.</p>
<p>“Where are her parents?” Hermione asks, rubbing her hands together worriedly.</p>
<p>“She says she hasn’t got any. Must’ve been given up or orphaned.” Harry said with familiar sadness. </p>
<p>“Well, not everyone is cut out for parenthood.” Hermione sighed.  Harry couldn’t imagine any parent willingly giving up their child.  But Atria Williams had seemed extremely timid and skittish, especially around Ron and Seamus. </p>
<p>“’Ey, Dad!” A loud voice of a teenage boy called from down the hall.</p>
<p>“Speaking of failed attempts at parenthood.” Ron muttered with a cheeky grin. Harry glared, Seamus grinned, and Hermione elbowed her husband.</p>
<p>Harry’s oldest son, James, came running down the long corridor.</p>
<p>“Mum’s waiting for us. She sent me to find you. Said to tell you that we’re leaving without you and if you weren’t home in five minutes there would be anti-apparition spells up on the house.” James grinned at his father. With his black hair and green eyes he looked like a young version of Harry. </p>
<p>“I’m gonna get Atria out of the interrogation box.” Seamus says, already walking backward before turning around to open the big black door. A second later a redhead followed him out in place of a girl with black hair. Harry and Ron looked surprised, as if they expected Seamus to be twisting their wands about the metamorphosing.  But indeed, the girl’s hair was now red instead of black. </p>
<p>Before anyone could say anything James was in front of Atria with his hand outstretched.</p>
<p>“Hey, I’m James.” He smirked, running his hands through his hair.</p>
<p>She looked at him for a second.</p>
<p>Then her eyes went completely black, she opened her mouth and had fangs and then a snake’s tongue slither out. It happened in less than a second and James snapped his hand back and proceeded to trip over his own feet, falling on his butt.</p>
<p>The next second her regular face was back and her hair was black and she was laughing as though she hadn’t seen numerous people murdered.  </p>
<p>“What the bloody hell.” James said in a rush of a breath. He was still on the ground as though he didn’t have the strength to get up at the moment. He looked up at her and she smirked and flipped her long black hair, imitating him.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” She said monotonously. Ron and Seamus were cracking up in the back and Hermione looked disappointed.  But what did Atria care about a mudbloods opinion? </p>
<p>James stared at her for a moment, just to make sure she wouldn’t hurt him, and then pushed himself off the floor, looking very disgruntled.</p>
<p>“I’m James.”</p>
<p>“You said that already.” She smirked once more.  This boy acted like a bumbling idiot.  Maybe it was a mudblood thing. </p>
<p>“What the bloody hell is taking so long?” A voice hollered, startling serves other Ministry officials. </p>
<p>James shrunk back and Harry winced and looked fond all at the same time.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Ginny, we just had some last minute details to discuss.” Harry said formally as if they had been doing something serious.</p>
<p>Hermione snorted.</p>
<p>“So who’s taking the girl?” Seamus asked suddenly. Everyone looked at Atria.</p>
<p>“Me? What, I don’t need to be taken anywhere.” She said defensively.</p>
<p>“Dad, we’ll take her.” James jumped in. Ginny gave him a warning look and then Harry a questioning look.</p>
<p>“She doesn’t have any parents, no school, and was at the attack today.” Harry explained seeing his wife’s look. “We also weren’t able to find any trace of her in any database,” he gave Atria a questioning look, which she promptly avoided.  </p>
<p>“I like to wander,” she said by way of explanation.  They couldn’t just take her, could they?  </p>
<p>“Well, then we’ll take her. Send her to Hogwarts with the rest of the kids in a month.” Ginny said with no hesitation.  Atria’s eyes widened in alarm.  Surely, there were procedures that these people had to follow, even if they were uncivilized half-bloods. </p>
<p>“Wait a pixie,” Atria interjected, “I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself—“</p>
<p>“Absolutely not.” Ginny said with a certain finality. James was inching closer to Atria.</p>
<p>“You really should be going to school. To find a job these days you need at least 4 N.E.W.T.’s.” Hermione said and Ron rolled his eyes.  Atria wanted to scoff at the woman and tell her exactly how unnecessary N.E.W.T.’s were in her line of work.  “But Ginny, you can’t just take her.”  Atria sighed in relief.  Maybe this uptight lady could talk sense into the others.  </p>
<p>“Fourteen is not a proper age to live alone.” Seamus argued. Atria looked around for support but found none. “Of course, we’ll need to get you documented and put into the Ministry database…” as the Irish Auror prattled on about all the hoops Atria would have to jump through, panic started to seize her.  Seamus and Hermione began talking about logistics.  Neither of them asked about her parents, which was a relief.  </p>
<p>“Don’t worry you’ll love the Manor.” James assured her. </p>
<p>I cannot go home with the Potters, Atria though, panicked. James winked at her. The mark on her forearm tingled and her hand itched to reach for her wand.  Impulse control was not Atria’s strongest suit, but she knew that killing as many people as she could before they killed her wasn’t the smartest move. </p>
<p>But the idea of living with blood traitors and half-bloods was enough to make her want to abandon reason.</p>
<p>“Wait until you meet the rest of the family.”</p>
