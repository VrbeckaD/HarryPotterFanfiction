    <p>It was no secret that the Malfoy family to some degree had always supported Lord Voldemort, though no one spoke of it and it was never confirmed to what degree.</p>
<p>It was also no secret that the Weasley family supported Harry Potter and the effort to put an end to Voldemort once and for all. And they did so with religeous, classic red head tenacity and boldness.</p>
<p>So when Narcissa Black Malfoy, in her stunning gown and robes with perfect hair and a look of determination on her face, took her son by the hand and marched up to the Weasleys to proclaim,</p>
<p>"We're part of the order now."</p>
<p>in front of a large crowd just before the start of the new term.... Well shocked might be a bit understated.</p>
<p>Molly, bless the woman, was only stunned for a brief moment before coming back to herself and yet still couldnt come up with a proper response.</p>
<p>"Please, Molly, I know we never got on or even really knew each other, but from one mother to another, I can no longer stand the dark shadow hanging over mine and Dracos heads." Narcissa was never known to beg and for all that she loves her husband, her child will always come first. Pride and marriage be damned.</p>
<p>"Of course. We can talk at length once the children are settled. Were you looking for a place to hide out?" Molly asked, ever the optimist despite probably being the fiercest member of the large family.</p>
<p>"I am. Draco dear, behave yourself please, and don't worry about your father or his orders. Ill take care of everything." Narcissa spoke calmly, though her heart was racing.</p>
<p>"Mother, you aren't serious? We'll be hunted for sure." Draco, just removing himself from the shock, stated rather matter of factly.</p>
<p>"You'll be better off in the end and a lot happier for it. And isnt that all a mother really wants for her children." Narcissa countered, leaving Draco to board the train with the Weasleys and Harry himself.Â </p>
<p>"You're sure then? Youd tell us all you know and even stand against him? You might have to go against Lucious. May not care for him much but its never been a secret you love him dearly." Molly asked once the kids, as they always would be to her, had boarded and were out of earshot.</p>
<p>"And if were you? Would you fight Arthur if it meant your children would be happier and safer?" Narcissa countered.</p>
<p>"You have me there. All right then. If that's the case then I know exactly where to take you. The old Black family home if you'll believe it." Molly said motioning her tentative new ally to follow her.</p>
