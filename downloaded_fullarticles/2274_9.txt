    <p>Walking into his Gran’s house for the first time in six years had not been easy for Teddy. He had told Ginny and Harry when he’d left for America - nineteen and his heart so full of pain he’d thought he’d die from it - he didn’t expect them to keep the old house in order. A month after he’d left, however, he’d received a letter explaining that they were planning to do the exact opposite, and had already made arrangements to have the house cleaned once a month. When he’d walked through the door it had quickly become apparent that despite being cleaned regularly, the house had gone untouched since the day he’d walked out of it. All of his Gran’s belongings and all of the memories that accompanied them had been waiting for him to finally confront them.</p>
<p align="left">So, Teddy had been doing just that for the last week — crying, laughing, cleaning, remembering, mourning — and all of it by himself. The whole thing had been extremely lonely, which is why, without so much as an owl or a floo call, he finds himself on the Potter family’s porch. Yes, walking into his Gran’s house had been difficult, but confronting memories and ghosts was nothing compared to the feeling of standing only a few metres away from the people he’d walked away from all those years ago.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Sure he’d exchanged the occasional owl with Harry and Ginny, and his godfather had even insisted on visiting twice, but he hadn’t been home in all that time. He had stayed away too long and he knew it. It wasn’t as if he’d been worried he wouldn’t be welcomed with open arms, no, quite the opposite actually. The Potters and Weasleys were a loving, accepting family who were almost his own, but not quite; a distinction that had never really mattered before because he’d had his Gran waiting for him when he got home. He didn’t want to test the bond he shared with the family, didn’t want to feel that separateness and have it be a reminder of everything he didn’t have any more. So he’d left and stayed away long enough that any distance was his choosing.</p>
<p>Now that he’s standing on this porch, though, and the memories are flooding back, he wonders, not for the first time, if he’s made the wrong call. The last time he’d stood on this spot, he’d been saying goodbye to his favourite person, a thirteen year old James Potter. Despite the age gap, the two had always been very close and breaking the news to him had been excruciatingly painful.</p>
<p>
  <em> “I’m sorry. I have to do this,” Teddy said. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> “You don’t have to. No one is making you, Teddy,” James shouted frantically, his frustration noticeable in a way that Teddy had never seen before. “We can figure this out. Just…stay.” </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Teddy swallowed around the lump in his throat. “You don’t understand why it would be hard for me to be here?” he pleaded. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> “No!” James yelled, tears spilling over onto his freckles. “It should be easier because you’re here with me. I can take care of you, Ted.” </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> “Jamie – “ Teddy started, his own voice breaking. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> “No! You don’t get to call me that when you’re…when you’re leaving me,” he spat, his voice breaking into a sob as he ran into the house, slamming the door behind him. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> He was swiping at his eyes angrily when his godfather approached and laid a comforting hand on his shoulder. “He’ll cool down. Just give him some time.” </em>
</p>
<p>He hadn’t though. Teddy had sent James several letters over his first year away but all of them went unanswered. Assuming that James just needed time, that he’d come around and start corresponding eventually, Teddy stopped trying and just waited; waited for something that never came. The other Potters gave him vague updates on his former partner in crime but nothing in his life, not pseudo-family, friends, or lovers could ever take the place of the freckled-faced boy that he’d left behind.</p>
<p>The separation had hurt but he would never hold it against James. Teddy only hoped that he would be forgiven for his own wrongs – the abandonment, the cowardice – there was only one way to find out though. Steeling any nerves, he lifts his arm and knocks twice. Hearing muffled yells through the door has him smiling to himself; the Potters were never known for their quiet manner and he’s happy to hear that this, at least, hasn’t changed. After a few moments, the door is wrenched open and standing, bathed in dim light from the entryway, is none other than his godfather, Harry Potter.</p>
<p>“Oh my God!” Harry shouts, launching himself at Teddy with such force that they both stumble from the impact. Teddy laughs, bringing his own arms up to wrap around his godfather. “You’re here,” Harry states, pulling him back and shaking Teddy by the arms. “Ginny, get in here! Look who’s home!”</p>
<p>Home. Is he home? The comforting embrace and the familiar scent of the Potter’s house certainly has him blinking back a sudden sting of tears. He can’t help but feel an immense emptiness in his chest though. Maybe this is just what returning to his old life feels like without his Gran by his side.</p>
<p>He’s dimly aware of Harry firing questions at him and is about to devote more attention to answering them when a gasp sounds from over Harry’s shoulder. “Teddy!” Ginny yells as she rips him from Harry’s arms and pulls him to her, a stray strand of fiery, red hair catching on his lips as she hugs him. “How are you?”</p>
<p>Teddy leans back, his face breaking into a genuine smile at the sight of her. “I’m good. Happy to be back,” he says honestly.</p>
<p>“Teddy?” An unfamiliar voice pulls his attention into the hallway. The sight of a young man has his breath stutter for a moment, initially assuming it’s James, but with a hard look it’s rapidly apparent that that’s where the brothers’ similarities begin and end. The dark haired boy is still a head shorter than Teddy but no longer has the pudginess around his cheeks that scream childhood. The sight in front of him is a punch to the gut, a reminder of how long he’s actually been away.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to be kidding me. Albie?” Teddy exclaims as he forces the teenager into a reluctant hug.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely Albus now,” he says with an eyeroll and a smile. “How’ve you been Teddy?”</p>
<p>“OH MY GOD! TEDDY LUPIN!” The exclamation comes out as more of a screech than anything, startling everyone involved in the little reunion. Before he can fully process her presence, Teddy has an armful of Lily.</p>
<p>Lily had been his most consistent pen pal during his time away, the correspondence morphing from charmed drawings of dragons to heartfelt letters over the years. Despite her apparent maturity in written communication, he had still pictured the nine year old who he had left and is wholly unprepared for her looking so much like Ginny. He swallows hard; trying to shake the discomfort that accompanies the realization that little Lily Potter now has breasts.</p>
<p>“Lily, let him breathe,” Harry says, detaching his youngest child from Teddy’s shoulders and immediately pulling him to his side.</p>
<p>“Look who’s talking.” Ginny laughs, pulling at Teddy’s wrist. “Come on, Teddy. We were just about to sit down to eat.”</p>
<p>An hour later, and Teddy is well fed, and his face hurts from laughing so hard. It’s amazing how natural he feels being back with the Potters – playfully teasing Albus, chastising Lily, joking with Ginny and Harry – it’s so much more comfortable than any interactions with his friends in America had been.</p>
<p>“I know a guy, Maximus Blight, over in the American ministry. He says you do good work,” Harry says, taking a swig of his drink.</p>
<p>“You keeping tabs on me, old man?” Teddy asks with a laugh but the thought of Harry caring enough to watch over him, floods his chest with warmth. “I liked my work over there. Werewolf rights are important. It’s part of what kept me there so long.”</p>
<p>“Do you think you want to stick with it?” Harry asks, hopefully. “We have a Beings division, same as the States.”</p>
<p>Teddy smiles warmly. Honestly he knew it had been irresponsible to pack up and move back to England without a job prepared but he’d been worried if he didn’t do it then, he never would. “I’d like to continue with it but if it’s not in the cards, I’ll figure something out.”</p>
<p>“Let me talk to Hermione,” Harry says plainly, as if he’d been waiting for that response. “I’m sure, with your experience, they can put you to use.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to do that,” Teddy answers.</p>
<p>“I know I don’t have to do that, Ted. I want to,” Harry replies with a smile.</p>
<p>Teddy’s chest feels tight at the fondness in his godfather’s voice. He looks down, swiping his finger over the neck of the beer bottle in his hands. He opens his mouth to respond, assuming the quiet that has settled over the room is because of his hesitation. However, when his eyes flick up to meet Harry’s, he sees that no one is looking at him, but rather at the doorway to the kitchen.</p>
<p>When Teddy looks over his shoulder, all breath leaves him. Standing in the doorway, looking completely dumbfounded, is none other than James Sirius Potter and <em> he’s beautiful </em>. It’s a strange first thought to have when looking at a man, stranger still when it’s someone who Teddy has actual memories of holding as an infant. Still though, even after seeing Albus and Lily all these years later, he’s unprepared for the changes in James. His shoulders; filled out. His jaw; sharp and angular. His arms; muscular and very visible beneath his tight t shirt. Under that, however, are the features that have always been synonymous with James in Teddy’s mind – the unruly mop of dark hair, the spattering of freckles across the bridge of his nose, and the mischievous twinkle in his eyes that never seems to leave.</p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Jamie,” Teddy says, all breath.</p>
<p>James smiles, it’s uneasy but it’s there. “Teddy,” he replies. “You’re here.”</p>
<p>Someone lets out a chuckle at the obviousness of the statement but after being away so long, Teddy can’t say who. </p>
<p>“How long will you be visiting for?” James asks.</p>
<p>“Oh,” Teddy starts stupidly. “Um…I’m back, actually. I just moved my stuff back into my Gran’s.”</p>
<p>He watches dumbly as James nods and visibly swallows, his Adam’s apple bobbing with the movement. Teddy is sure that they are staring at each other too long but isn’t sure how to proceed. Can he hug him? Would that be weird? Why would that be weird when it isn’t with Albus or Lily? Why is this so awkward? And why is his mouth suddenly so bloody dry?</p>
<p> </p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Are you guys going to greet each other properly or just stand there?” Harry asks with a chuckle.</p>
<p>Teddy awkwardly stands at Harry’s words, moving cautiously towards James and is surprised to see that the boy – no, the man – now stands only an inch or two shorter than him. James offers him a quick, shaky smile before pulling Teddy into his embrace, the strength in his arms a surprise despite his earlier observation. There’s a brief moment of stiffness where Teddy considers pulling back but before he has the chance, James melts against him.</p>
<p>The smell of him is no longer familiar but it’s so good because it’s James. His James. He tries to fight the lump in his throat, to blink away the impending tears but he knows it’s a losing battle. A sob wracks through him and he would have hoped that James didn’t notice but by the way his grip tightens, he knows he already has. He feels immensely stupid, not for crying, but because he hadn’t realized. All that time away, even with all the unanswered letters, he hadn’t realized how much he had missed James.</p>
<p>They hug for what is probably too long and when they pull back, Teddy can see that James is just as affected as he lets out a sigh of frustration at himself before scrubbing his hands over his face. “Teddy Lupin,” he says in a deep, disbelieving voice, smacking Teddy’s arm and flashing him a lopsided grin. “Welcome home.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t Fred coming tonight?” Albus interjects in a way that makes it clear he’s been wondering since James stepped through the door. For the first time, Teddy feels embarrassed about the audience for their reunion.</p>
<p>James shakes his head. “He said he’ll meet us there. If we’re still –“</p>
<p>“We are!” Albus replies much too forcefully. “It’s my last night of freedom before school tomorrow. No matter how dramatic Teddy’s return, I’m getting properly pissed tonight.”</p>
<p>“Albus!” Ginny chastises.</p>
<p>“Jesus, that’s right you’re of age now,” Teddy says, rubbing the back of his neck, self-consciously.  “I really have been gone too long.</p>
<p>Albus flashes him a cheesy smile. “So what do you say? Wanna come out?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to impose,” he starts.</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous.” “Shut up.” The brothers respond simultaneously, making everyone snicker.</p>
<p>Teddy smiles warmly, his heart feeling fuller than it has been in years. “Alright. Let’s do it.”</p>
<p>George’s son Fred had never been someone that Teddy had given much thought. Being only three years apart, they should’ve been the best of mates but between being sorted into different houses and Teddy spending his teen years snogging Victoire, it had never panned out that way. This fact, Teddy learns tonight, had been a grave oversight on his part because Fred’s sharp wit and easy demeanor make him an absolute blast to be around. After only a few hours and a few glasses of firewhiskey, he has already agreed to join their regular nights out.</p>
<p>“Where’s Scor tonight?” James asks.</p>
<p>Albus shrugs. “He’s spending some time with his dad. We figure that we’ll see enough of each other this year –“</p>
<p>“Oh hello….” Fred cuts in. “Look up at the bar,” he whispers conspiratorially causing all three pair of eyes to swivel towards the bar. “No! Don’t look.”</p>
<p>“You literally just told us to look,” James replies, dryly.</p>
<p>“I meant look subtly.” His eyes are fixed on a rather mature looking woman. “Come on Albus, I need you to wingman for me,” he says, standing and pulling on his cousin’s sleeve.</p>
<p>Albus rolls his eyes dramatically in their direction but doesn’t hesitate, following close on his cousin’s heels.</p>
<p>An awkward atmosphere settles over the table as James seems to realize the same thing, that they’re alone for the first time in years. Teddy’s eyes shift to James who is picking nervously at the label on his beer bottle, worrying his lip between his teeth, the look oddly endearing on him.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” James says so suddenly that Teddy has a moment of confusion, but when their eyes meet, there’s no questioning that the apology is for more than the uncomfortable vibe.</p>
<p>“James...you were a kid,” he says.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but then I wasn’t,” James says with a weak smile. “I didn’t understand and then once I did, it felt weird…like too much time had passed, and I wanted to talk to you in person –“</p>
<p>“But I never came home,” Teddy finishes for him; the guilt settling, making his chest tighten uncomfortably.</p>
<p>“Right.” James says, his hands and eyes returning to the label as if he had paused an important task to apologize and needed to return to it immediately. A moment passes before he speaks again, so quietly that Teddy has to lean forward to hear him. “Why didn’t you? Come home, I mean. We missed you, you know?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Teddy says on a sigh. “It was just easier. I never wanted to feel like a burden.”</p>
<p>“Teddy. That’s –“</p>
<p>“I know that your parents never would’ve looked at it that way but I didn’t want to feel like that,” Teddy says, attempting to articulate his feelings and failing. “I just needed some time, I guess. And some time turned into a lot of time. For what it’s worth, I’m sorry too. It was selfish. I missed you, though…a lot.”</p>
<p>Their eyes meet, the hazel of James’s penetrating into him and Teddy feels inexplicably breathless. He swallows hard trying to understand why the air around them suddenly feels charged. Two things suddenly occur to him; 1) that it’s not normal to stare into a friend’s eyes in the middle of a pub, and 2) that he has clearly drunk entirely too much firewhiskey because despite that knowledge, he can’t seem to tear himself away. Saving him from his internal quandary, James shakes his head abruptly.</p>
<p>“It’s so weird,” James says thoughtfully, “I thought you’d have changed for some reason.”</p>
<p>Teddy swallows hard, willing himself to act normally. “I guarantee it’s much weirder for me,” he says with a laugh. “You were always my favourite but now…I don’t know, I guess it’s just cool that you’re a grown up. Remember when you started at Hogwarts and my mates used to take the piss because I let you hang around all the time?”</p>
<p>“I was always just mature for my age,” James says and Teddy can’t help but let out a snort.</p>
<p>“HA! No. Not at <em> all </em> what I was going to say.” He takes a swig of his drink, suddenly pensive.  “You’ve always been magnetic though. Even when you were younger. People are just drawn to you, Jamie.” There it is again, that shift in the air surrounding them and Teddy feels entirely wrong-footed.</p>
<p>“James, your fucking evil ex is here,” Albus announces, startling them both by falling into the booth, followed by Fred, his drink splashing dangerously around the rim of his glass.</p>
<p>“Ooooh, an ex?” Teddy asks. “Bad blood between you, I reckon?”</p>
<p>“You could say that,” James answers.</p>
<p>“Bad blood? More like your ex is a fucking, cheating wanker,” Fred supplies helpfully.</p>
<p>“Which one is she?” Teddy asks, straining in his seat to get a good look at the bar.</p>
<p>“She?” Albus blurts out, the effects of the firewhiskey apparent by his lack of volume control. “Do you seriously not know James is gay? It’s Cassius Blecher over there; he was a couple of years below you at Hogwarts. Remember?”</p>
<p>Teddy’s mouth drops open at the word ‘gay’ and he doesn’t seem to remember how to close it. How could Lily have forgotten to tell him? His eyes shift to James on their own accord and his heart lurches at the apparent discomfort on James’s face. Sweet Merlin, he’s gone and made himself look homophobic now.</p>
<p>“Yeah…right. I remember Cassius,” Teddy answers distractedly, his mind sifting through ways to let James know that he supports him that don’t involve naming every gay friend he’s ever had.</p>
<p>“He’s looking this way,” Albus shouts. “He saw you. Quick. Kiss Fred!”</p>
<p>“Ew,” James says, his face twisting into a look of utter revulsion, his apparent disgust overtaking the hurt from a moment earlier. “I’m not kissing my cousin. Besides he knows Fred is straight anyway.”</p>
<p>“Whatever - Teddy, then.”</p>
<p><em> Teddy, then? </em> Oh. Kiss Teddy? He could kiss James! They’re asking him to kiss James and what better way to let someone know that you’re okay with two men snogging than by snogging a man!</p>
<p>“Albus, Teddy’s not –“</p>
<p>Teddy moves so quickly that James doesn’t have time to finish his thought. He cups James’s jaw and tilts his chin up, bringing their lips together. It should hardly qualify as a kiss, just pressure where their mouths meet chastely, but even that small connection has Teddy’s heart beating rapidly. James, who at first is too stunned to move, smiles against his lips and brings his own arms up to wrap around Teddy’s back. He is dimly aware of Fred’s pounding on the table and Albus’s catcalls but can currently only focus on the fact that James’s mischievous tongue just swiped across his bottom lip. Not willing to let him win, he fists a tuft of hair at the back of the freckled man’s neck and pulls, deepening the kiss. James makes a quiet, startled sound in the back of his throat and Teddy feels like his whole body is on fire, his focus narrowing to only James in his arms. He’s suddenly hit with both the realization that he rather enjoys kissing James and with a peanut that Albus had chucked at the duo’s heads, causing the two men to pull apart.</p>
<p>“He’s gone,” Albus says, a curious expression on his face.</p>
<p>Teddy smiles and does his best to joke with the table, but his mind remains otherwise occupied. What the fuck is he doing? He’s never in his life kissed a man before, never kissed someone six years younger than him, never kissed someone who was practically family. Whatever the case, though, it is apparent that coming home is going to be a bit more complicated than he had originally expected.</p>
