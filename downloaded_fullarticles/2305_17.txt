          <div class="userstuff"><p>Summer was fast approaching when one morning as Harry checked the mail there was a letter for him with a familiar red wax seal and vivid green ink. The letter was addressed to <em>Mr H Potter, New House, unnamed gravel road, Godric</em><em>’s Hollow</em>. Harry raised an eyebrow as he opened it and set down the prophet he’d gotten as well on the table.</p>
<p>“What’ve you got Harry?” Ginny looked up from the stove as he frowned at the letter.</p>
<p>“Letter from Hogwarts.” He shrugged and leaned against their kitchen island as he opened it.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
  <em>Mr. Potter,</em>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
  <em>I understand you</em>
  <em>’ve never stated any interest in a career other than an Auror but as I hear you’ve quit I have a offer. I once again find myself with no Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. This one contracted a mysterious illness in the last week of term. So if  you would like to have the position you are welcome to it, I am not worried about your ‘lack’  of teaching experience. </em>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
  <em>Kind regards, </em>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
  <em>Professor Minerva McGonagall </em>
</p>
<p>“I like the quotation around lack, she’s very subtle.” Ginny rested her chin on his shoulder as she read the letter as well. “I wonder if there was a single teacher that didn’t know what you were up to.”</p>
<p>“Well we were hardly subtle near the end were we?” He chuckled and pressed his cheek to her head for a moment. “So?”</p>
<p>“They say the position is still cursed.” She laughed, wrapping her arms lightly around his waist. “But you’ve defeated curses before.”</p>
<p>“I liked teaching.” His voice got quiet as he read the letter a second time. “Felt like I was doing something.”</p>
<p>“What better way to stop dark wizards than to teach a whole generation?”</p>
<p>“That didn’t work so well for our teachers.”</p>
<p>“Mhm.” She agreed and slipped around him to look him in the face. “So be better than them.”</p>
<p>“You say that like it’s easy.” He rubbed at his face as his mind ran through the things they’d been juggling, the big games they’d been playing.</p>
<p>“It is.” Ginny shrugged. “Snape was a git and a bully, Dumbledore thought of children’s lives like pawns in his wars, Umbridge wanted absolute control, Fake-Moody tortured us, as did the Carrows.”</p>
<p>“Half of your examples were death eaters.”</p>
<p>“Exactly.” He frowned and she ran her thumbs gently over his cheeks. “Just teach children how to defend themselves, that’s all your job will be.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Harry felt himself nodding as he thought about it. “Teaching huh, who’d have guessed?”</p>
<p>“Literally anyone in the DA.” Ginny smirked and whirled away from him her hands itching for paper and a quill. “They’ll be thrilled.”</p>
<p>He laughed as she started writing up letters to each of them, they’d have a party no doubt. They’d already been planning on doing that now their house was finished anyway.</p>
