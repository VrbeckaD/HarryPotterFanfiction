  <b>Ms.LeStrange,</b>
</p>
<p>

<p>
  <b>Harry Potter.</b>
</p>
<p>Bellatrix Lestrange was wasting away in her cell, driven to the brink of insanity by the dementors, and her cousin being in such close proximity. So imagine her surprise when a large black owl swoops through the corridors of Azkaban until it reached her cell and waited patiently for her to take the letter from its leg.</p>
<p>Quickly ripping open the envelope and reading through it, Bellatrix thought she might have finally gone off the deep end and was now hallucinating. The little brat HARRY POTTER was writing to her as if to gloat, with his horrible spelling and overjoyed sloppy writing.</p>
<p>But upon looking at it a second time, and a third, the imprisoned Death Eater felt something stir within her, that she had thought long long dead. Something that made her want to find the little child that was confused and probably scared, and hide him far away. So with a crazed smile, she flipped the piece of paper, found something to write with and began to reply.</p>
<p>
  <i>Dear Mr. Potter,</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>It is very nice to meet you. You seem like a very nice boy. And I would love to keep writing to you. Though I will say this now, learn how to spell words or I will not write again.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>As for your question, that is how you spell it. Don't try and stop the weird things, they are good. If anyone tells you differently, you can just tell me and I'll step in for you.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Your new friend,</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Bellatrix Lestrange.</i>
