    <p>Get out more his mother said. Meet and socialize with people his father said. It's your final year, you got to learn how to talk to people for your career his Uncle said. He wants nothing to do with people both magical and No-Maj. No-Maj are people that born not a witch or wizard. There rare No-Maj-born that are born with magical talent. They are called No-Maj-born. Odd he knows, but right now all Ben wants to do is relax before going back to school for his seventh and final year. He was resting in a tree. His arms resting behind his head as he lean on the strongest branch. Birds tweeting away and the wind blowing through his hair. Calm sounds he can happily fall asleep to.</p><p>"Heeeeelllllllloooooo!" call a voice.</p><p>"Huh?" Ben woke and look down. He saw a girl waving at him. "Hello!?"</p><p>She had dark brown hair. Tied up into three buns and she wore a pair of blue jeans and a plain dark green chop top. She had on, black and white trainers (sneakers) and her skin was very tanned from the sun.</p><p>"Hi, you must be Ben?" the girl said. "Your mum said you'll be here. I'm Rey. Rey Palpatine from London. That's in England. I'm a foreign exchange student from Hogwarts."</p><p>"And?" Ben asked.</p><p>"Oh, I just got here and your mum told me to find you." Rey answered. "You know your dad said you'll be grumpy."</p><p>"That's a understatement! Wait, school doesn't start for another four weeks. Why are you here now?" Ben felt confuse.</p><p>"I know! It was your Uncle Luke's idea for me to come early to get use staying in America. Are going to come down?"</p><p>"Nope!" Ben went to laying on the tree branch.</p><p>Rey huff as she put her hands on her hips. "Then I just have to come up there."</p><p>Rey got out her wand. A ten inch pine wood with a horn of a welsh green dragon and unicorn hair wrapped around it, fuse to create a twist pattern around it. She had it since she was eleven years old in Ollivander's on South Side of Diagon Alley. Rey smiled as she shift and flick her wand and recall the charm Wingardium Leviosa on herself. She began to float up towards Ben. Rey rested herself on the branch and she saw Ben asleep. He was very handsome. Her mum said they can be very loud and big. Han was tall when she first meet compared to the small size of his wife Leia and his brother-in-law Luke Skywalker, but she looks at Ben and see he was tall and very well built with his black hair. It felt almost a shame to wake him.</p><p>"Hey, sleepy head." Rey said as she lean down towards Ben and poked his left cheek. "Wakey, wakey! You know it's rude fall asleep on a guest."</p><p>"Ow! Quit it." Ben said angrily grabbing Rey's hand. </p><p>"Ow! OK, you made you're point let go!" Rey said in pain. "You're hurting me. Ow!"</p><p>"Well, don't poke people in the cheek." Ben said as he let go of Rey.</p><p>"I'm sorry!"</p><p>"It's fine! Sorry for hurting your hand."</p><p>His eye widen with shock. Now he got a closer look of this British girl. He notice she has hazel eyes and freckles just around a small nose. For a Brit she was cute. He saw Rey check her hand. Her wasn't broken which was a good thing as Ben is quite strong for his age. He turns eighteen in November and so this was his final year of school. He wondered how old was Rey?</p><p>"Silly question, but how old are you?" Ben asked going red in the face. "Yep, silly question is right."</p><p>"I'm seventeen and so this is my final year of school." Rey answered. "Hey, your ears are red."</p><p>Ben pulled his longish hair over his ears becoming more red. "Stupid big ears. Thanks dad!"</p><p>"Better then freckles around your nose."</p><p>"The difference between my ears and your freckles is your freckles are cute."</p><p>Rey tilt her head as she sat down on the branch with her legs over the branch as she held on to it. "You think my fickle are cute? Well, in that case I think your ears are cute."<br/>

</p>
<p>Ben's cheeks got warm. Really warm. Someone thinks his big dumb ears are cute. These big ears that make him look goofy as it is that he inherit from his father. Someone thought they were cute. His big ear cute? No way! She was just making fun of him like everyone else does. One of the many reasons why he avoids people? You'll grow into them his father said to him when he first started school. Kids at school had already called him 'Big Ears Ben' and 'Biggy Benny Ears' all because his big dumb ears. So he grew out his hair and told his mom to only trim it and to never shorten it anymore.</p><p>Annoyed Ben jumped down from the tree branch. With his long legs he was able to jump down without hurting himself. He then ran off away from Rey. She saw him ran off and she felt like she had hurt his feelings. Then it hit her. His ears! She should have known. He doesn't like his ears. They are quite big and she was able to see them turn red from under his black hair. Rey felt awful for hurting his feelings. She wasn't a mean person. She hates bullies. She gets bullied at school herself and knows how he felt, but she had to make this right. She had to go after him and apologize to Ben. She wants them to be friends. She never had a friend in her life and was hoping this student exchange will help her make friends. Not make someone hate her. She had to make this up to him. After all sheâ€™s staying at his family home until term starts in September.</p>
