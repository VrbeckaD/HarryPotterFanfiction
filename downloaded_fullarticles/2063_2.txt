</p><p> </p><p> It was the end of her final Year-End feast and everyone had already begun filing out of the Great Hall. So much had changed over the past year, both in the school and outside in the rest of the world, that leaving Hogwarts was very bittersweet. Hannah wished, as she had often done the past few years, that her Mum could’ve seen what she had accomplished here: Head Girl, highest N.E.W.T. grades in Hufflepuff for Herbology, and, sadly, a survivor of the aftermath following the Battle of Hogwarts.</p><p>She took a moment to take one last look at her school, and how different it had looked just a year ago.</p><p>Professor McGonagall’s year-end speech had put a heavy emphasis on how proud the Hogwarts’ staff was of the entire student body for helping rebuild both the physical castle itself and the bonds within. Even though Ravenclaw had won the House Cup that year, everyone had been proud of how much they had accomplished together. Slytherin House was even included more than she had ever seen, and they had worked the hardest at rebuilding than all the rest.</p><p>“Hey Hannah, wait up!”</p><p>Hannah looked up to hear Hermione as she was wading through the throng towards her.</p><p>“Want to ride a boat back across the lake together?”</p><p>“That would be great,” Hannah replied.</p><p>She was happy to have at least one person from her original year to graduate with, and after they had both made Head Girl they had grown quite close over their final year.</p><p>“So what are you going to do first when you get home?”</p><p>“Well, I was thinking about reviewing my notes from all my classes this year. I only have two days before I start my work in the Auror office.”</p><p>“SEVENTH YEARS THIS WAY,” bellowed Hagrid over the din around them. He waved at Hermione as the two girls rushed over to a waiting boat before finishing.</p><p>“Somehow I’m not surprised,” Hannah replied, rolling her eyes slightly. Both girls laughed.</p><p>“I’m going to be enjoying a few days of peace before I start my training at St. Mungo’s. I doubt I’ll be getting much downtime for a while after that.”</p><p>“Well, here’s to a new beginning for both of us,” Hermione said as the boats began moving and they took in one final look at the castle.</p><p align="center"> -----</p><p>Neville was relieved to have finished his latest Auror assignment. No matter how hard they worked, there always seemed to be more dark wizards and witches to track down. He was spending his time between jobs the way he had done every chance he found that last year – visiting his parents at St. Mungo’s.</p><p>He had been trying everything he could find in his research with wizards around the world to help them come back from the powerful curse that had stripped everything but their lives from them. He knew it would be next to impossible, but having something to focus as an incentive to get through his daily job was helping him. He didn’t know how much more Auror work he could take.</p><p>Currently, he was working on a simple potion with Gingko leaves, fish oil, and chocolate. His mother’s eyes looked a little less glassy after he gave it to her, but not enough to really recognize anything. Still, it was more than she had shown since coming into the ward. Neville sighed, holding her hand before moving over to his dad to see how the potion did on him.</p><p>“I have the food delivery for – Oh, hi Neville.” Hannah entered the ward, nearly dropping the tray of food for his parents when she saw him. “I didn’t expect to see you here.”</p><p>Neville blinked. “Same. I mean- you- Erm, Well, it’s not unexpected that someone would bring their lunch, or come to check on them, but I didn’t know it would be you.” Neville sighed internally, he was supposed to be a big, tough Auror, but when faced with a girl he knew from school– especially <em> this </em>girl –he reverted back to the fumbling kid he was at school. “I always stopped by here when I finish a job. I’m trying to do what I can to revive Mum and Dad’s minds. I know it’s probably impossible, but I don’t think I could live with myself as their son if I didn’t try. I’ve never seen you here when I’ve visited, though.” He fidgeted a little with the cuff of his sleeve. “Finished at Hogwarts finally, huh?”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m a Trainee Healer right now. I just started today and wanted to meet your parents, so I offered to bring their food up today.” Hannah blushed. “You were so comforting after losing Mum that after all you told me about them that I was curious to meet them.” She balanced the tray on hand and gestured towards his own, “What was that you’re giving your dad?”</p><p>“This?” Neville held up the goblet in his hand. “It’s a potion I’m working on. The healers aren’t quite sure what the torture actually did to their minds, so I’ve been trying all kinds of memory, depression, and coma treatments. I’ve been sending owls to healers all over the wizarding world trying to find out whatever I can that might help, as we don’t know much about this field yet. I know Dad is still in there somewhere and I want to try to find him. And Mum as well.”</p><p>Tears started to form on his face as he tried to hold his emotions in check. He saw Hannah hanging on every word he said like it was the most fascinating thing she’d ever heard and it was somehow even harder to keep things together when he was talking to her. It reminded him of their time in the DA together. She was quick to at least try whatever they were working on, even if she wasn’t the best at it.</p><p>It was kinda cute, but he couldn’t think about that right now.</p><p>“Fascinating. Where are you getting the ingredients?” she inquired.</p><p>“Well, actually,” Neville leaned back, scratching behind his neck, “I’ve grown most of what I’m trying out in the garden behind Gran’s house. I’ve been getting seeds with my owls so I know I have the same strands others have had success with. It’s funny, I don’t know if it’s because Snape isn’t breathing down my neck or that I do better understanding how to use the stuff I’ve grown, but I’m actually been getting pretty good at crafting my own potions.”</p><p>There was that look again. “I’m sure growing things yourself is bound to be helping their quality as ingredients, too. Professor Sprout always said the best ingredients were ones you knew were grown well, and she would always praised your work in the greenhouses. You were better than most of us in Hufflepuff – and we had a bit of extra help there.”</p><p>Neville chuckled. “I wish Professor McGonagall had given us extra practice in Transfiguration. I would of better use in the Auror office.”</p><p>“Don’t talk about yourself that way,” Hannah told him, sternly gazing at him to make her point. “You sound like your Gran. You are much better than you think you are. Why, most wizards can’t create their own potions and you improved leaps and bounds in Professor Slughorn’s remedial potions classes. I still am amazed any of us learned anything your last year.”</p><p>This wasn’t the first time she had pointed out how Gran treated him. Neville saw the stern look that always accompanied these comments gradually fade into her unmistakable, deep, red blush.</p><p>“I mean, ah, oh I have to go.” She muttered awkwardly, thrusting the tray of food into Neville’s hands. “I have to, um, deliver more meals before they get cold. Have a good day!”</p><p>And with that Neville watched her run down the corridor. What had that been about. He turned his attention to the forgotten tray of food and then to his parents. “I have some dinner for you, Dad. Looks like I’ll help you and Mum eat before I leave tonight. Let’s get you sat up now.”</p><p align="center"> -----</p><p>“So, you froze after complimenting him and ran out of the room?” Hermione surmised over the phone.</p><p>“Yes. I don’t know what came over me! I thought I was over my crush on him after not seeing him for a year.”</p><p>Hannah was thankful that, having been brought up in a half magical, half muggle house that she</p><p>at least could talk to her closest friend over the telephone when stuff like this came up. Somehow it felt like a more private way to communicate since most of the people she worked with had no idea what it even was.</p><p>“Well, obviously you aren’t”</p><p>Hannah could hear the chuckle in her voice even through the phone. “And you said he comes in often?”</p><p>“Yeah, about every time he finishes an assignment. He’s trying to see if he can help his parents.”</p><p>“I thought magical maladies were untreatable?”</p><p>“That’s what I was taught as well. When I asked around, most of the staff think he’s daft for even trying, and the rest of them find it sad that he’s going after a presumably lost cause.” Hannah could feel a twinge of sadness creep up on her.</p><p>“And you?” Hermione inquired. “What do you think about it?”</p><p>“I - uh,” Hannah started. “I hadn’t really thought that much about it. Honestly, if anyone could do it, it’s him. He’s got more incentive than probably anyone else in the wizarding world to help his parents, he’s extremely talented at Herbology, much better at Potions than he used to be now that he’s found his niche-”</p><p>“-and handsome and sexy and oh my Neville how handsome you’ve become since year one.” Hermione finished in a mocking falsetto.</p><p>“HERMIONE!” Hannah could feel the warm blush overtake her cheeks and knew Hermione could hear it in her voice.</p><p>“Oh, please. It’s not like I’m going to tell him. I may work with him now, but you’re my friend and I can respect that it’s your crush and your duty to declare your love to him.”</p><p>“Ugh, why do I let you torment me like this? It’s not like he’s ever even going to like me.”</p><p>“Because I’m your friend and that’s also my job. You are far too hard on yourself. It’s getting late, want to call it a night and talk again tomorrow?”</p><p>“Yes, anything to get you to drop this line of conversation.” Hannah laughed, “night ‘Mione.”</p><p>“Night, Hannah. Have sweet dreams of Neville tonight,” teased Hermione, determined to get one final jab in before the night was over.</p><p>“Oi, shut it!” Hannah said, hanging up the phone. She sighed. She hadn’t thought that Neville might show up in her dreams tonight. Thanks to Hermione, it seemed it was going to be much harder to stop thinking about him. Hannah couldn’t tell if that was a bad thing or not.</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>“Earth to Neville – Hey NEVILLE!”</p><p>“Hmm?” Neville shook his head trying to clear it. “What did you say, Ron? Sorry, must’ve missed it.”</p><p>“I said, what’s up with you lately? You keep staring off into space on us. We can’t risk you doing that on a mission you know.”</p><p>“Yeah,” added Harry, “you’ve been more and more distracted lately. Is there something up with your parents?”</p><p>“Uh, yes. I’ve - um had some luck growing potion ingredients that I’m trying to figure out how to best use them.”</p><p>Ever clueless, Harry fell for it. “Well, don’t forget you do have a job to do here as well.”</p><p>Ron didn’t seem to buy it but he didn’t speak up, much to Neville’s relief.</p><p>“So, what is on our agenda for today,” Neville said hurriedly.</p><p>Looking down on his desk, Ron grumbled. “Ugh, training exercises. Looks like we get to drill on concealment and disguise. I HATE these drills.”</p><p>Neville gulped. Disguise usually entailed Transfiguration. This was going to be a nightmare.</p><p>“Well,” sighed Harry, “looks like we’ve got work to do. Let’s go.”</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Hannah sighed over her cup of tea. It had been a long shift and she was enjoying a few minutes in the visitor’s tea room to decompress before returning home. Having to assist in the surgery of a small child that had snagged his father’s wand and accidentally blew them and half their living room up took quite a bit out of her. The burns were terrible, over half of the poor boy’s body, and even with magical healing it was still painful to watch. She hoping she’d eventually become less shocked at what came through the doors of the hospital, but some of it was going to take time.</p><p>She took another sip of tea when she caught sight of Neville entering the sitting area with his own cup and a plate of scones. Before she had time to think she had started waving him over to the chair opposite of her at her table.</p><p>
  <em> ‘Oh my gosh, what on earth just possessed me to do that?’ </em>
</p><p>It was too late to do anything else now, he was already heading towards her.</p><p>
  <em> ‘Wait, what the? Is he – is he grinning at me? No, he can’t be...’ </em>
</p><p>Neville sat down in front of her. “Hi Hannah, um – adjusting to working her okay?”</p><p>She was relieved he had started the conversation – she wasn’t sure she could have thought up a subject on her own.</p><p>“I’m doing alright. Today was kinda hard – I still can’t handle having children brought through here yet – but basic care of patients is really coming naturally for me. In fact,” a slight blush came to her checks as hard as she tried to will it not to, “I was assigned to your parents’ floor often just for that reason. Not all of the trainees can handle that floor, but I guess I just see them as your parents instead of-” Her voice started trailing off.</p><p>“It’s alright,” Neville assured her. “It’s no secret to me that my parents make some people feel</p><p>uncomfortable.” He shrugged before continuing. “Honestly, if I hadn’t grown up around them like this, I would probably feel the same way, but this is all I know.”</p><p>‘<em> Wow </em> ,’ thought Hannah ‘ <em> Everyone that thought he was weak early on in school – but growing up like this has made him incredibly strong. No wonder he was such a good leader in the DA. His parents would be just as proud of him as I hope my Mum would have been of me </em>.’</p><p>“Hannah, are you okay? You seem distracted. I’m not bothering you, am I?” The puppy dog look of sadness currently plastered on his face almost broke her heart.</p><p>“No! It’s not that. I just – I just was thinking about some things. I’m sorry. Er, how is work at the Auror office? Hermione said they are trying to push her group up through to full-fledged Aurors as quickly as possible because of how crazy things still are.”</p><p>This did help him not look as sad, but it didn’t make him look any happier. Hannah cringed at the realization she hadn’t made him really feel any better.</p><p>Dropping his head, Neville sighed and waited a moment before answering. “Honestly, and I haven’t really told anyone this, I don’t know if I am cut out for it. I mean, I’m not exactly bad at the job, but I’m also not great at it. We had training drills today and I failed everything that had anything remotely to do with Transfiguration.” Neville looked up into her eyes. “I’m proud to follow in my parents’ footsteps – I really am – and while I’m still working on not having my Gran’s negative voice framing everything I do, I still truly do not think this is the right route for me. I don’t know what to do if I’m not an Auror, though.”</p><p>He shook his head. “Hey, you want the last scone? I don’t feel as hungry as I thought I would be, but I think I remember you saying once that you like these.” Even with the distress he was in, Neville seemed to have a little twinkle in his eye when he said that. It was a little mesmerizing.</p><p>Hannah took the scone in Neville’s outstretched hand. It was still warm and smelled heavenly. “Thanks. I’m sorry that Auror work isn’t more enjoyable for you.” Suddenly her face lit up as she formulated an idea.</p><p>“Wait, what if you took on a job here?”</p><p>
  <em> ‘…I could be close to you every day.’ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ‘What the, wait, why on Earth would THAT be my first thought?’ </em>
</p><p>“Really? I don’t know what I could do here that would be worth being hired for. I’m not exactly the most skilled at healing charms.”</p><p>‘<em> …Think of something Hannah. Something that could entice him to stay </em>.’</p><p>‘<em> Seriously, again with this brain? </em>’</p><p>Thankfully, Neville remained unaware of her inner monologuing.</p><p>“What about all the work you are doing to help your parents? The hospital may be able to give you a grant for your research and you would be able to focus on them instead of devoting time between missions. And, as a plus, no Transfiguration needed.”</p><p>Neville’s face brightened the more she talked. Her internal voice was nearly gloating when she noticed.</p><p>“You make a good point. I’ll have to think about it. There definitely would be some perks working here.” He grinned, staring at her for a bit before shaking his head quickly.</p><p>Hannah looked down and noticed that both of their teacups, as well as the plate of scones, were empty.</p><p>Neville must have noticed about the same time as well. They both stared quietly at their cups, neither one making a move right away to get up. Hannah just felt comfortable sitting there with him and part of her wished she could just do that forever.</p><p>Eventually, Neville stood up with a sad sounding sigh. “I have to go see Gran this evening and I need to get going or I’ll be late. She can be very particular about punctuality.” They both stood up slowly, grabbing their teacups and reaching for the empty scones plate. Each realizing the other one had also picked it up they both managed to drop the plate simultaneously, causing the fine china to shatter all over the table. Neville was quick to get his wand out and silently repair the dish before handing it to Hannah.</p><p>“Here, you take it. I don’t want to risk breaking it again.”</p><p>Hannah looked on in awe. “How did you do that so fast?”</p><p>Neville grinned. “Upside of being clumsy: you get really good at casting fixing charms. So, um, would you like to grab tea and talk again about this time tomorrow if I don’t get pulled into a mission?” Neville was still grinning, but his checks had started to turn a little pink.</p><p>Hannah was a little shocked. “I - I would love that. I’m usually off shift by around this time.”</p><p>“Great, see you tomorrow then!” Neville flashed her a smile as he ran towards the stairs, stopping only briefly to place his cup in the bin by the door.</p><p>Hannah stood there for a minute, still holding her cup and the plate. She was completely flabbergasted.</p><p><em> ‘Did that really happen? Did – Did Neville just ask me to tea tomorrow? </em>’</p><p>A warm feeling started from the centre of her chest and radiated outwards until her entire body was feeling cozy.</p><p>Tomorrow evening couldn’t get here fast enough.</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Neville apparated about a block from Gran’s house to give him a chance to think while he walked. His mind swarmed with conflicting thoughts and he knew it would be impossible to think once Gran started telling him what he should be doing. He had already accepted that he was never going to be able to fit the cookie cutter mold of what she thought he should be, and while things had been better since the Battle of the Department of Mysteries it still was hard to be himself around her sometimes.</p><p>Unfortunately, she also was about the only person he felt he could confide in, which made for a tricky situation sometimes.</p><p>‘<em> …But you were able to talk to Hannah just fine about how you feel your job as an Auror is going. </em>’</p><p>
  <em> ‘I don’t know how I was able to get that out. It must’ve just slipped somehow’ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ‘…You were happy today. Happier than you have been since before becoming an Auror.’ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ‘I was helping my parents – that always makes me happier’ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ‘…Happier, yes, but not happy. Face it Longbottom, you are miserable. You need to change things.’ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ‘Gran would never approve of me becoming a Healer, or anything besides an Auror. I’d be wasting potential that way.’ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ‘…Seriously, are you listening to yourself? Gran doesn’t control your life anymore – you do. And being miserable all the time is not fun.’ </em>
</p><p>Neville shook his head as if trying to knock the other voice out of it. He was at Gran’s house now and he didn’t have any more time or mental energy to devote to this trail of thought. He reached up to use the knocker when the door suddenly opened.</p><p>“Neville dear, you’re terribly late. Dinner is already on the table. Hurry up and take your seat.” Gran said, pulling him inside.</p><p>“Yes, Gran,” Neville sighed. It looked like it would be a long evening.</p><p>They passed into the great dining room and took their seats. The pictures of his parents smiling down on him served as a reminder of his earlier internal debate. He was so caught up in their eyes that he completely missed what his Gran had said.</p><p>“Neville, I asked you a question. How was your work today? I heard you had training again today. Are you getting any better at Transfiguration?”</p><p>How on earth had she heard about that already?</p><p>“It went okay I guess,” Neville shrugged. There wasn’t much more he could say that wouldn’t make her react.</p><p>“Well good. I am glad to hear you are getting better at that. So, tell me, what made you late tonight?”</p><p>Gran took a bite of her roast as she waited for Neville’s answer.</p><p>“To be honest,” he paused, “I was visiting Mum and Dad again.” ‘</p><p><em> ‘Here we go, </em>’ he thought.</p><p>“Are you still trying out those absurd potion concoctions on them? Neville, if nearly 20 years of experts haven’t made any progress with them, there is no way someone who struggled with Potions all through school has any hope of doing anything but harm them. You really should devote yourself more to your actual job. Your parents-</p><p>“-would be proud to see me following in their footsteps and bringing honour to the family’s name.” Neville finished rather robotically.</p><p>Gran was visibly starting to get angry. Setting down her fork she snapped back. “You don’t have to be rude about it. I’m only trying to help you continue to succeed, as you did at the Battle of Hogwarts.”</p><p>Neville felt a hot rage starting to surface, fueled by over a year of denial that he was suddenly unable to control after his earlier conversation with Hannah. Before he knew what he was doing, Neville stood up; causing the table contents to rattle a little.</p><p>“No, you are trying to help me succeed at being what you want me to be. I’m tired of being an Auror. In fact, I really, truly hate it. I feel happiest trying to help Mum and Dad and I’m going down to St. Mungo’s to see if I can do more there full time, then I am going down to the Auror’s office to tell Robards that I quit.” Neville began moving swiftly towards the door while his Gran tried to call out to him.</p><p>“What? How dare you – you are throwing your potential down the drain for an unobtainable dream. Your parents –“</p><p>Neville slammed the door and found himself standing on the stoop.</p><p>
  <em> ‘Crap, now what do I do?’ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ‘…What else? You do exactly what you told Gran you would do.’ </em>
</p><p>The feelings he had so strongly felt inside Gran’s house were soon were quickly replaced with the shock and fear of the unknown. He began to walk distractedly – too preoccupied to even focus on where he was going. Could he really do this? Was it even a possibility he could get this crazy idea Hannah planted into his head to work?</p><p>The thought of Hannah made him smile, calming his nerves a little and giving him a chance to breathe. At that moment he knew he had made his decision. He just needed to do a couple of things first.</p><p> </p>
