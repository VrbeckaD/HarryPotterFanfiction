          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Okay guys, I gotta say something." Peter walked into his best friends' house, arms crossed. He looked a little pissed and yet he was smiling too of course. This was hilarious. "Padfoot legitimately asked us 'What do I wear to meet a baby? Do I wear a suit?'"</p><p>"I wondered if I should wear a suit because the baby should be impressed when it first meets me, right? Right?" Sirius said, throwing up his hands in defense. It didn't help too much now though. "But then you said don't wear a suit."</p><p>"Well. Yeah." Remus was smirking too. </p><p>"Why is it so funny then?"</p><p>"Because then you asked if you should wear something soft so the baby would like it." Peter said with an eye roll. </p><p>Well. That made sense. "Well I have to touch the baby. I mean you can't wear spiky stuff." he said with a huff of his own. Why was this weird? His friends should know this!</p><p>Remus sighed. "Your instincts, while confused, are also so sweet."</p><p>He could admit that at least. </p></div>
