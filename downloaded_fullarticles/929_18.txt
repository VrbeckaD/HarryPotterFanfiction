    <p>
  <span>In his office on the second floor of Hogwarts, one Quirinus Quirrell lay his head down against the cool surface of his desk, gazing wearily at the dreadfully large stack of scrolls that awaited him for grading. </span>
  <em>
    <span>'Assign an essay,' he says,</span>
  </em>
  <span> the wizard despaired, </span>
  <em>
    <span>'it'll be useful' he says...</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dumbledore had had some sort of epiphany at the most recent staff meeting and all but demanded Quirrell teach his first through third years about Boggarts, Dementors, and Mind Flayers, in defiance of the Ministry curriculum. It would have been enough to lecture on the bloody things, but no, his Lord had added a demand of his own. So he had assigned a </span>
  <em>
    <span>short essay</span>
  </em>
  <span> for all students in all three years: "What do you believe is your greatest fear? Why?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Dark Lord hadn't shared his motivations for the order, which was the usual way of things, but it chafed Quirrell a bit. Wouldn't most of these children just lie?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He picked up the first scroll from the stack; they were alphabetical, of course. Hannah Abbott's greatest fear was...moths. Because they chewed holes in her favorite sweater. How Hufflepuff.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Perhaps his Lord was merely punishing Quirinus, making him read these. The essay was being graded very loosely, after all; he hadn't even set a length requirement. He slogged through the childrens' simple fears: spiders, mummies, Professor Snape (ha!) -- and complex ones: failure, disownment, poverty.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Parkinson...Patil 1...Patil 2...Perks...</span>
  <em>
    <span>Potter.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The familiar sensation of goosebumps on the back of his head alerted Quirrell to his master's attention. "Read the boy's essay for me," Voldemort ordered in a whisper. "Tell me...what he fears."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>So it was all about Potter after all,</span>
  </em>
  <span> the Defense Professor sighed, resisting the urge to roll his eyes. The Dark Lord's obsession with knowing everything about the Potter boy had not waned in the months since the beginning of term, sadly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He took a deep breath, opening his mouth to read -- and stopped, blinking, rereading the first few lines. Honestly, Quirrell had had very low expectations for Harry Potter's essay given his performance so far. Now, his eyebrows were climbing into his hairline, the more he read.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Quirinus," Voldemort reminded him, sending a burning sensation down Quirrell's spine. </span>
  <em>
    <span>"Read it aloud."</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Yes, my lord," he replied immediately, but still hesitated for a moment before continuing. "'I don't know what I'm scared of,' the boy writes. 'If I had to choose, I think it would be death. And being forgotten. Or death </span>
  <em>
    <span>from</span>
  </em>
  <span> being forgotten. Sometimes, my aunt and uncle forget that I'm in my cupboard for days and I have to wait for them to unlock it.'</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"The essay ends there, my Lord," Quirrell murmured, perturbed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Voldemort was...remarkably silent, for a time. Even his presence seemed to diminish, to freeze; Quirrell felt a numbness over his hands and feet, and repressed a shudder.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When the Dark Lord finally spoke again, it was in a quiet voice Quirrell had not heard from him before. "Death..." He trailed off, seemingly lost in thought.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"...my Lord?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Silence, Quirinus. I am pondering."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Quirrell glanced at the remainder of the ungraded essays, weighing his chances of getting away with finishing them during the Dark Lord's imposed quiet time. Ultimately, the choice was taken from him: in the same moment he came to a decision, his master spoke again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Do you know, Quirinus, that one of my first decrees, were I to control Britain, was to be the removal of wizarding children from the care of Muggles?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"...No, my Lord. May I ask why?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hm. I am not surprised. My list of grievances was not...nailed to the doors of the Ministry Atrium, so to speak; nor was it ever publicised beyond the ranks of my followers during the heights of the movement. I wonder...never mind. As for why, however…” He trailed off again, but not for as long a time. This was, Quirrell thought, the most he’d heard his Lord speak in a while. “It is precisely because of situations like Potter has described in his essay. A </span>
  <em>
    <span>cupboard,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Quirinus. The minimum for a house-elf is </span>
  <em>
    <span>two</span>
  </em>
  <span> cupboards!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Quirrell shivered under the weight of his Lord's anger. That it was, for once, not directed at </span>
  <em>
    <span>him</span>
  </em>
  <span> was little relief. "You will fabricate an excuse for me to speak to the boy," Voldemort ordered him. "Moreover...you will locate the ingredients of the following potion..." And he listed off more than two dozen reagents, of which Quirrell recognized half to be Ministry-regulated.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He dared not question the Dark Lord's plans, but was this course of action truly wise?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It took about a week to prepare the potion -- or rather, </span>
  <em>
    <span>potions</span>
  </em>
  <span> -- his Lord demanded. Quirrell had no idea what exactly they did, but he drank one inky black concoction when he was ordered to, fifteen minutes prior to the time he arranged with Potter. The other substance, he poured out in a circle upon the ground from the hollowed-out gourd it had been held in, spilling seven drops of his blood when the circle was completed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The moment the last drop hit the circle of glittering grey potion, Quirrell was overtaken by a wave of dizziness so strong he barely managed to reach his chair before he collapsed into it. He had the strangest feeling of </span>
  <em>
    <span>detachment</span>
  </em>
  <span> from his body, all of a sudden; and the potion on the floor was vaporizing, forming a glowing shape not unlike a Hogwarts ghost, becoming more and more solid…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Potter knocked on the door, and Quirrell heard himself bid the boy come in.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Th-thank you for coming by, Mr. P-Potter,” his mouth spoke, directed by another’s will -- by </span>
  <em>
    <span>Voldemort’s</span>
  </em>
  <span> will. He gestured toward the empty armchair that the Dark Lord had earlier demanded he conjure. “P-please have a s-s-seat.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Potter was staring at the figure in the other chair, who Quirrell could not see from his current position as more than a blur of dark fabric and hair. “Er, if you’re busy, sir, I can come back later --?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, no, not at all,” the Dark Lord spoke -- his voice melodic now, deeply musical, </span>
  <em>
    <span>substantial</span>
  </em>
  <span> in a way that Quirrell had never heard him speak. He wondered what form the potion vapors had taken. “Quirinus has asked you here so that I could speak with you, in fact, Mr. Potter.”</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“With </span>
  <em>
    <span>me</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” The boy’s eyebrows rose. He seemed honestly shocked; Quirrell heard the unspoken, </span>
  <em>
    <span>No one ever wants to speak with </span>
  </em>
  <span>me</span>
  <em>
    <span>,</span>
  </em>
  <span> in the response.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, with you. Ah, pardon my rudeness, I have forgotten to introduce myself.” The Dark Lord stood up from the chair, crossing the room so he stood closer to Potter (who had not yet taken the seat offered to him, and still stood by the door). Quirrell could see only the back of him, but he looked -- he looked like a </span>
  <em>
    <span>man</span>
  </em>
  <span>. A normal man. A normal </span>
  <em>
    <span>wizard</span>
  </em>
  <span>. It was the oddest illusion; he had been unable to conceive of the Dark Lord having ever </span>
  <em>
    <span>been</span>
  </em>
  <span> human, and to see even a silhouette in human shape unsettled him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He wondered what the Dark Lord’s face looked like.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thomas Marvolo Gaunt,” the not-a-man proclaimed, offering a hand to the boy to shake.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“...Harry James Potter,” the boy replied, sounding confused. “Erm. What did you want to speak with me about?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Please, sit, and I will explain,” said ‘Gaunt’, returning to his seat. Quirrell got a clear glimpse of his face as he turned: he really </span>
  <em>
    <span>did</span>
  </em>
  <span> look human. Even his eyes were a different color -- a vivid green, instead of red…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Thus invited, Potter finally sat. Quirrell’s mouth opened again: “M-my apologies for s-springing an unexpected v-v-visitor on you,” he stammered out. “Mister G-Gaunt is an old f-f-friend. He has only just r-returned to B-Britain after many d-decades of travel.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Potter was looking at them each in turn, wide-eyed and...relieved? Quirrell wondered what he had expected to hear. Albus </span>
  <em>
    <span>had</span>
  </em>
  <span> warned them all against fawning over him like a celebrity…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It was quite a journey,” Voldemort mused, leaning back in his chair. “But I have returned to Britain for the foreseeable future; am now settling my affairs from being abroad so long -- and what do I find, Mr. Potter,” he leaned forward, tone shifting to conspiratorial, “but that the Hogwarts Headmaster has taken guardianship of a student under my protection, without telling me!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Potter tilted his head. “Who is it?” he asked, voice equally low.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“To my great surprise,” the Dark Lord answered, “it is </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Mr. Potter. And after my attempts to contact you by owl went awry, I realized the best course of action would be to visit in person.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The boy blinked several times, clearly taken aback. “...</span>
  <em>
    <span>Me</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” he asked, voice small. “Are you sure it isn’t a mistake…?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Absolutely certain,” Voldemort said, brooking no argument. “So I must begin by asking: with whom have you been living, up until now? None of my family remains; nor do any Potters I know of; and I heard nothing of Dumbledore himself housing a child…” Quirrell could not see -- his mouth was engaged in drinking tea -- but he assumed the not-a-man was putting on a pensive expression, from his tone.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Er, with my mum’s Muggle relatives,” Potter answered hesitantly. “My Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon and cousin Dudley.” He glanced in turn at the floor, at Quirrell, then back to Voldemort, eyes wide.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Dark Lord hummed. “No, no, that simply will not do. Placing my charge in the hands of Muggles...I cannot imagine what Dumbledore was thinking.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you mean you’ll...take me away from them?” Potter’s eyes looked awfully </span>
  <em>
    <span>hopeful</span>
  </em>
  <span>. In fact, he had scarcely looked so lively in all the times Quirrell had seen him. The boy hastily appended, “Sir?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That is my intention, yes,” Voldemort answered. “To be quite frank, I am glad you approve of the idea, Mr. Potter. I had worried you might be fonder of them than you seem to be.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Potter wrinkled his nose. “The Dursleys don’t really...well, like me, sir. And I don’t like them very much either.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"I am g-given to understand, Mr. Potter," Quirrell found himself speaking up again, "th-that they lock you in a c-c-cupboard?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Erm, sometimes, yes,” the boy nodded, flushing as though embarrassed. “They gave me Dudley’s second bedroom this summer, though,” he hastened to add. Privately, Quirrell was amazed, in the same way as he might be by a gruesome spell mishap, that </span>
  <em>
    <span>he had really been living in a cupboard all this time</span>
  </em>
  <span>. The Dark Lord’s evident sincerity in taking guardianship of the boy was not nearly as shocking, strange as it still was.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>If Voldemort could still sense Quirrell’s thoughts (and thereby make plans to punish him for his disbelief later), he did not give any indication of it. “The sooner I formally claim guardianship, the better,” he decided aloud. “I will be visiting the Ministry immediately to complete the paperwork.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“In the meantime,” he added as if in afterthought, “please do call me Marvolo. We will meet again tomorrow afternoon, at latest, when I return to have words with the Headmaster about all this. Perhaps with several Aurors present…” He trailed off, lost in thought.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay, sir -- er, Marvolo -- please call me Harry?” The boy was practically abuzz with excitement.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Voldemort stood from the armchair. “I’ll have this taken care of in a jiffy, Harry,” he said, reaching over to ruffle the boy’s hair. “See you tomorrow.” He then turned to the fireplace and Flooed out -- ‘Ministry of Magic, Blood Affairs Office’. Quirrell flinched at the sudden return of his body to conscious control; his Lord, however, remained curiously absent from his mind. Had he really Flooed to the Ministry? </span>
  <em>
    <span>How was the Dark Lord still corporeal?</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Professor,” Potter murmured in wonderment, distracting him from his confusion, “you’d tell me if I were dreaming, right?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course, Mr. Potter,” Quirrell managed to say -- his stammer gone, for the moment. “You are quite awake. And therefore in need of a hall pass for curfew…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Long after the boy had departed, Quirrell remained in his seat. He felt...remarkably lucid, now. When the Dark Lord did not return from the Ministry (if he had truly gone there) by midnight, he stood up shakily and went to bed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Even then, he lay awake for several hours, barely getting any rest in his utter confusion as to what was going on. He had not been given orders past the use of the potions earlier; after so many months of being dependent on his Lord, he found he actually </span>
  <em>
    <span>hoped</span>
  </em>
  <span> Voldemort would return to possess him again -- if only to return some sense of stability now that the world was shifting on its axis.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>The Dark Lord</span>
  </em>
  <span>, he mused, </span>
  <em>
    <span>taking guardianship of the Boy-Who-Lived</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Only then did the thought occur to him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>...What was going to happen tomorrow?</span>
  </em>
