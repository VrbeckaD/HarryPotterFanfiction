    <p>Harry sat up on his make shift bed in the cupboard under the stairs and pushed his red hair out of his eyes. He rubbed his eyes and tried to figure out what had woken him. Was it the hunger pains? No he was used to those he could ignore them. The pain from his last beating? No he was used to that and could block that out too. Then what? He listened hard trying to find out what had woken him. Then he heard it noise from outside his door. It didn't sound like the heavy footsteps of his cousin or uncle or the light footsteps of his aunt. Whomever it was probably shouldn't be in the house. He pulled his blue baby blanket to him as he heard the lock on his door click open. He was shaking when the door opened to reveal a man and woman both holding glowing sticks.</p>
<p>Harry was panicking. They'd taken him out of his room and he was now sitting on the kitchen counter a place he was never supposed to be. The light was on and he could see the man and woman better now. She had hair like his red and curly.</p>
<p>"Oh, Harry we're so sorry." the woman cried. "So sorry. I'm your mommy Lily and this is your daddy James. Do you want to come home with us? "</p>
<p>Harry stared at them then his stomach cramped he grabbed it. He was so hungry. He was shocked when the woman handled him a bottle.</p>
<p>"I know you're too big for a bottle but this has a special potion in it that will make you feel better." Lily cooed.</p>
<p>Harry didn't care if he was too big for a bottle he put it in his mouth and began sucking it down. It was really good he thought it tasted like the white stuff his mommy had given him a very long time ago. He couldn't remember the name of it. He didn't notice the woman pick him up and wrap him in blankets or that they were leaving the house no all he noticed was that he was warm and this bottle was making him tired. He fell asleep long before they got to where they were going.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Harry woke in a nice comfortable bed which shocked him because he wasn't allowed to sleep in a bed. He sat up and came face to face with a black haired boy with green eyes. The boy looked exactly like him only with black hair.</p>
<p>"HARRY IS AWAKE!" the boy yelled.</p>
<p>The adults from the night before came into the room.</p>
<p>"Jamie, we told you not to wake your brother." James scolded pulled the boy off the bed around his middle.</p>
<p>"I not." Jamie said, to his daddy. "Harry waked up on his own. I just here."</p>
<p>Neither James nor Lily were buying that for a second.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Harry." Lily said, softly.</p>
<p>Harry blinked up at all of them. He tried to crawl away but his bed was against the wall and he was too weak to move much.</p>
<p>"It's okay." Lily soothed picking him up and carrying him to the bathroom attached to Harry's room. Everything in here like in the room was on Harry's level just big enough for him to use. She took the clothes off of him and set him in the tub the nanny elf Mippy had already drawn a bath. They all watched Harry panic. "What's wrong, Harry? It's okay." she gently began washing him. "The water isn't too hot is it?"</p>
<p>Harry looked at her with fear and tear filled eyes but shook his head. No it wasn't too hot. He noted that every time the water went black that the tub would empty and refill. He wondered how it was doing that.</p>
<p>"Is the water too cold?"</p>
<p>He looked back at his mommy. Then shook his head again. No it wasn't too cold.</p>
<p>"Then the water is just right?"</p>
<p>Harry thought about that then nodded. He stared into the water it only came to his waist but if he were to lay down he would drown he was sure of it. Uncle was always talking about drowning him and had even tried to a few times. He was scared of water. He didn't like it at all but his mommy wasn't letting him drown so maybe he would be okay. He was shocked when he saw that his skin was a really pale white color. He'd always just assumed he was black like that guy down the street that his aunt and uncle couldn't stand because of the color of his skin. He was soon enjoying getting his hair washed. He'd never had a haircut in his life so his hair was down to midback and got tangled easily but his mommy knew how to wash it so that it didn't hurt.</p>
<p>When the bath was over he was dried off and taken to brush his teeth. He tried on his own like he'd seen Dudley do.</p>
<p>
  <b>Brushing Teeth-1</b>
</p>
<p>He was confused by this screen but decided that it wasn't important right now. He was taken back into the big room where he'd waken up and to a dresser. His mommy got out a pair of boxer briefs for him and he put them on not trusting her to do it. He then blinked up at her. The boxer briefs were blue they suddenly turned black and Harry was suddenly cowering and hiding his face.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, Bambi?" James asked. "You did magic that's a good thing."</p>
<p>Harry shook his head.</p>
<p>"Yes it is to!" Jamie declared pulling a shirt over his brother's head. "I do magic all the time too. We can't help it cuz it's who we are."</p>
<p>Lily and James smiled at each other as Jamie dressed Harry and even tried to tie his shoes. When it became apparent that Jamie was having trouble Harry tied his own shoes.</p>
<p>
  <b>Accidental Magic-1</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Shoe Tieing-1</b>
</p>
<p>"Okay, after break fast we're going to go shopping and get you all sorts of clothes and toys." Jamie declared leading Harry by the hand out of the room. "It'll be fun."</p>
<p>Harry doubted that. Going shopping with Auntie was never fun. He was shocked when he was actually allowed to eat breakfast and happy when he was given his bottle after. Sure he was too big for it but he liked it. Of course he fell asleep after drinking it.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Lily, James and Jamie walked into Diagon Alley later that day. James was carrying Harry who was waking up from his nap. Harry was soon in awe of everything that he could kind of see but not really. They went to Gringotts to get some shopping money.</p>
<p>"I want to show the boys their training vaults." James said. "It's never too early to get them started learning about Finance."</p>
<p>Lily sighed but agreed and they were soon on the cart ride to the vaults luckily they didn't have to go far because the car ride scared Harry who seemed to have taken a liking to their Goblin guide Griphook because he was clinging to him and shaking.</p>
<p>"Not many humans would touch a Goblin, child." The Goblin in Charge of all Potter Vaults told Harry.</p>
<p>Harry blinked up at him in confusion. He didn't understand why not? This Goblin was being nice and even smiling at him.</p>
<p>Griphook sneered at the human child but then again thought of his baby brother who was scared of the carts as well. He didn't blame his brother and didn't tease him over it like others did so why should he do that to this human perhaps the little thing could learn to like them and if not they could always arrange it so someone could get it's money for it.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry about Harry." James sighed, but didn't move to collect his son. "But he just loves magical creatures." He hoped that he wouldn't get caught lying to the Goblins.</p>
<p>"Yep, he does!" Jamie agreed, some how knowing his brother loved animals. "Harry is the nicest person ever he'll be nice to you if you be nice to him."</p>
<p>Harry sniffled a bit and let go of Griphook he ran to his mommy and hugged her legs. She smiled and rubbed his head then lead him into the vault.</p>
<p>"This is Harry's vault." James said. "There isn't much in here now but one day there will be plenty of money. "</p>
<p>There was about a hundred golden Galleons on the floor.</p>
<p>
  <b>You now have access to your Training Vault.</b>
</p>
<p>Jamie's vault was the same. They didn't take any money out of those vaults but once they were back in the bank upstairs they were each given a small money bag with a few Sickles and Knuts in it. As they were going to leave Harry hugged Griphook then ran to take his mommy's waiting hand.</p>
