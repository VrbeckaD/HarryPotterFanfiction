    <p>Gideon was standing by a tree, watching Clinton.  He felt creepy, he knew it <em>was creepy</em>, but could he stop?  No, he couldn’t.  Especially when Clinton was so beautiful.  He was the perfect mix of his parents.  As a child he took after his daddy, and still had his blonde hair that was a tad big shaggy rather than Malfoy straight, which his father was always after him because of it.  He had grown into his Malfoy heritage some though, with his grey eyes like Grampa Lucius and the same snarky disposition.  He was thin  – the perfect size for throwing over a shoulder and dragging off –  with lithe dancer’s muscles and always poise in a way that could label him as the perfect Malfoy, marked by his patrician nose.</p><p>The combination of cowboy and posh wizard was striking.  Especially when you expected a deep southern accent, but got a British one.</p><p>Gideon didn’t like him so close to the water’s edge as he was.  Clinton was hopeless at all things water, which was odd because when he danced, he cut through the air with such certainty, you’d think he could do anything movement.  Couldn’t figure out swimming for the life of him though; Gideon had to save him once when they were much younger, and he’d never been able to shake it.</p><p>Clinton reached down to swish his hand through the water, and every corner of Gideon’s body tensed.  Is this what Father felt like with Daddy?  Father had tried to explain it to him once, when Gideon asked about dragon tamer mates.  “You’ll feel like they’re always falling to their death and only you can catch them.  It’s hard to keep it reigned in.  I’m lucky with your dad in that I don’t have to much, he likes being caught, but there are times I have to bite my tongue real hard, lest I’m forced to sleep on the couch.”  Father smiled, and then he got serious.  “But other times, Dad knows he’s got to yield to me.  It’s the contract you get into when you’re with a dragon tamer.  I don’t know that it’s a fair one, but it’s the way it is.”</p><p>Gideon understood Father’s words in his heart, his dragon heart.  He’d known something about what he felt for Clinton, since he could first remember understanding such things, but he kept it to himself.  Oh, he’s sure Father knew, but he hadn’t mentioned it out loud.  When you were young, it was easier for a dragon tamer to deny, since it was mostly feelings of protection.  As they grew, Gideon was drawn to Clinton like a bee to honey.  It was harder not to stare at him and watch him.  Gideon attended as many of his dance recitals as he could.  It was something he could get away with.  The invitation was extended family-wide, in other words to both the Prince-Weasley and Malfoy-Eastcastle families, and people could come or not based on availability.</p><p>Unfortunately, Gideon wasn’t Clinton’s favorite, and was mostly annoyed with him.  Gideon supposed he’d be annoyed with him too if he had to deal with such an overbearing ox.  Gideon couldn’t help it sometimes and he knew he was hard on Clinton.  He had no idea how Father did it, especially when Dad was pure trouble sometimes.  Though speaking of Dad, he should probably have him sew his finger back on before he got what for.  But first things first.  He strode over to Clinton his beautiful dancer, nearly scaring him half to death.  Clinton scowled his Malfoy scowl.  “Oh, it’s you.  What am I banned from this time?”</p><p>“Do you <em>have</em> to play so close to the water?  You know you can’t swim.”</p><p>“You play with dragons.”</p><p>“That’s different.”</p><p>“You’re right, it’s far more dangerous.  Good Merlin, Gid.  Are you missing your finger?”</p><p>That made the dragon tamer self-conscious.  He’d made Clinton unhappy and that sat horribly in his dragon heart.  Unfortunately, it came out as anger.  “It’s not a big deal.  Dad will sew it back on.”</p><p>“If you get there in time.  Go now.”</p><p>He really didn’t like being bossed around, <em>especially</em> by Clinton.  Alpha dragons did not take kindly to such things.  “Only if you come away from the water.  I’ll not have you fall in the moment I turn my back.”</p><p>“Ugh, fine.” He stood.  “Well?  You going?”</p><p>“I’m going.”  <em>But not without you.</em>  He reached out to take Clinton’s wrist, and dragged him up to the house, squealing.</p><p>“Hey!  I was, let me go you brute!”</p><p>“I’ll do no such thing.”  But when they got to the house, he did let go of Clint’s wrist.  Clinton was an angry bird about to peck his head off.  Gideon didn’t back down.  “I’d best not catch you near the water like that again.”</p><p>Clinton crossed his arms, puffing his strong dancer’s chest up.  “Or what?”</p><p>They don’t get to finish their argument, besides he knew ‘or what’.  Dad’s suddenly at the door, his long Prince hair loose and flowing over his shoulders.  “Gideon <em>Charles</em> Weasley, are you missing a finger?”</p><p>“Well yeah, but—”</p><p>“—in the house right now, young man.”</p><p>How embarrassing, but he’s got no one to blame except himself.  Everyone knew Dad didn’t like his growing collection of dragon tamers toting appendages home.  They’d been strictly instructed to go to the hospital, or you get what you get from him and, as Father always says, “Dad may not be a Tamer like us, but he’s a force to be reckoned with.”  Lily was not officially Tamer Prince-Weasley yet, but she would be, and even though it’s only her first year, she had come home with many dragon-related injuries.</p><p>Clinton’s smirking at him.</p><p>“We’re not finished,” Gideon warned him.</p><p>“Oh, but we are.”</p><p>“You fucking br—”</p><p>“<em>Gideon</em>,” Father poked out from his workshop.  “In the house, please.”</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“—I will talk to Clinton.”  Father looked at him meaningfully, able to devise what was going on miles away.</p><p>Gideon headed in the house ready to be told off by Dad.  “Where is it?” he said looking vivid green eyes straight into his soul.</p><p>He pulled it out of his trouser pocket, wrapped in cloth.  “I protected it like you showed.”  All the Prince-Weasley children learned healing spells from Daddy.</p><p>“That’s not the rule.  I can’t spank your father, but I can spank you.”  He snatched the finger away.  “Next time, you go to hospital.”</p><p>He’d like to say ‘yes, sir’ like he’s supposed to, but it <em>felt</em> so wrong.  Gideon didn’t know how to explain it.  “But Dad, you’re the best healer there is.  Why would I wait in line when I can have you?”</p><p>“Merlin, spare me.  Just like your father you are.  Neither of you have waited in line for me a day in your lives.”</p><p>And it would stay that way if they could help it.  “Sorry Dad, you’re stuck with us.”</p><p>“Don’t I know it.”  Dad had his bag out and Gideon sat at the kitchen table.</p><p>Father came striding in.  “What the bleedin’ hell is going on?”</p><p>“<em>Your</em> son’s lost his finger and he didn’t go to hospital,” Dad said for him.</p><p>Gid winced to Father, but he knew Father would understand.  “Why does it sound like I’m in trouble?”</p><p>“Because he’s just like you.”</p><p>“Ow!” Gideon said.</p><p>“See?” Dad said.</p><p>Father waited until Dad’s back to working on him before he laughed quietly.  “What happened with Clinton?” Gideon asked.  It’s all he can think about.</p><p>“Yeah, you and I need to chat about that.”</p><p>“Char?” Dad asks looking up from his finger mending task momentarily.</p><p>“We have a situation with Clint and Gid.”</p><p>Dad got it right away.  “Oh.  Oh honey,” Dad said.  “That’s wonderful.  You’re finally going to tell him then?”</p><p>“Wonderful?  This is terrible.”  Gideon hid in his good hand.  “It feels like my heart is going to break in half and he won’t listen to a damn thing I say, which makes it hurt worse.”</p><p>“Is that what you feel, Charlie?” Dad said adding a few spells to his handiwork.  “You never told me that.”</p><p>“You know my dragon heart aches for you, <em>Draga</em>,” Father said.  “Our son is just better at describing it than I am.  Clinton is waiting on the porch for you, Gid.  I want a word with you first.  I’ll wait for you on the back porch.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>Father strode out, forever looking like he’s on a mission.  His large muscles tightened and flexed as he walked.  “Wait a sec, you said finally going to tell him – that mean you knew?”</p><p> 
“It wasn’t hard to notice, you’re at more of his dance recitals than most of us.”
</p><p>Maybe he’d been more obvious than he thought.  “I didn’t mean for this to happen, Dad.”</p><p>“I know you didn’t.  It’s not something you can help.”</p><p>“Clinton isn’t fond of me.” One of the first things you learned as a dragon tamer, was how to read body language.  He wasn’t as good as Father, but with practice he would be.  Clinton’s body language always spoke of annoyance.</p><p>“Don’t be fooled by a Malfoy.  They are good at hiding body language.”</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“—Malfoy tell, watch how many times they touch their hair in some way.  They can’t help themselves.”</p><p>Gideon thought about that as his baby sister came barreling at him.  “Giddy, <em>Giddy</em>!”</p><p>She was only two and a half, but Molly had nine older siblings, and had learned how to talk well for her age.  Molly jumped into his lap as Dad finished up.  “Where’s Septimus?”</p><p>The two were usually attached at the hip.  “Wif, Jon-than.  You can play?”</p><p>“Oh, me darling.  I can if you give me a bit of time.”  Gideon was Molly’s favorite person after Papa.  Papa was hard to beat though.</p><p>Dad finished his finger, wrapping it with gauze.  “You be careful with that,” Dad warned.</p><p>“I will.”</p><p>“Let me see the rest of you.”</p><p>“It’s just a few bruises and a small burn, nothing I can’t—”</p><p>“Jacket and shirt off, now Gid.”  Dad wasn’t relenting.  Gideon did as instructed, having to sit Molly on the table, which she quite enjoyed.  She was fascinated watching her big brother get patched up.  Father was sure she had dragon magic and then that would make four of them with Trenton, so far.  “Just a small burn?”</p><p>He shrugged.  It was to him.  “Dad?” he asked as he was being patched up.  “Do you think Grampa Sev is going to approve of such a thing?”</p><p>Gideon was the Prince heir.  A role he took seriously. There were different rules for him than there were for the rest of his siblings.  He knew Father would approve, because he knew how these things went, and that Dad approved of anyone that made Gideon happy, or happily miserable as the case was currently, but Grampa Sev was another matter.  Gideon knew Grampa would want his happiness too, but there were other factors to consider.  There was also Granddaddy Clinton.  Clinton Jr was a favorite of his, and Granddaddy Clinton was particular about such things.  Gideon got on with him well.  Even though they weren’t blood related, Gideon had always felt he was his granddaddy too.  There were lots of family events spent with their non-blood family; they considered themselves, one big happy family.</p><p>On the bright side, Clint wasn’t Lucius Jr.  That poor bloke had it worse than Gid did, being heir.  Grampa Lucius was almost, as particular about such things as Granddaddy Clint.  Uncle Draco was less so, but Uncle Noah was apt to heed both Grandfathers, and so Luc had a bit of a time of it.  Not that it stopped him doing things, he just had to be more covert than Gideon ever had to with things.</p><p>This for instance, that he could talk so freely about his unrelenting feelings for Clinton to his parents was a luxury Lucius wouldn’t have.  If he told anyone who he’d been fraternizing with, there would be a world-class uproar and he’d be restricted going anywhere for weeks.</p><p>”I think it’s all going to be fine,” Dad said.</p><p>When Dad finished with him, Gideon had a gauze wrapped around his torso, and he’d used several spells, plus made him drink a pain reliever potion.  Finally, he released Gideon, and he could redress.</p><p>“All right little miss, you come with Daddy.  Gid has to talk with Papa.”  Dad took the little red-haired blighter and Gideon remembered he was getting closer to facing Clinton after his dragon tamer production.  <em>Damn my dragon blood sometimes.</em></p><p>He hoped Father had something to offer him.  “How did it go with Kah, today?” Father asked him hearing his approach.  Father was leaned up against the backporch balcony looking out at the large yard.</p><p>The yard was uncharacteristically empty, which meant most of the humans who inhabited the house must be way upstairs in the games room, or over at the Malfoy-Eastcastle house.  All the children spent a lot of time between the two.  There were now nineteen of them with brand new little Marshall from the Malfoy-Eastcastle side.  And who knows, there could be more still.  Gid’s parents seemed in no hurry to stop building the family.</p><p>“Good other than the finger.  Bit tired though.  She’s a tough one.”</p><p>“Ah, that’ll do it,” Father said.  “I suggest you walk Clinton home rather than apparate him there.  Will give you an excuse to be near him longer.”</p><p>“How did you know I’d be taking him home?” Gideon squinted at his father who often seemed like a mind reader.</p><p>“Experience.”</p><p>“What did you want to talk to me about?”</p><p>Father takes a breath, Gid gets the impression he’s not sure how to put words to the thing in his mind.  “It’s time you tell him.”</p><p>Gideon winced.  “Isn’t he too young?”</p><p>“You are only four years apart – Dad and I are eight – and he’s old enough for dating.  I know Uncle Noah hasn’t allowed him thus, but you’re a different circumstance, and he will allow you.”</p><p>Father was so confident, it made Gideon bold.  Except, “I’m not sure he’s all the fond of me.”</p><p>Father smiled.  “He is.  The boy can’t stop touching his hair around you.  Classic Malfoy tell.”</p><p>“How does everyone know this, but me?”</p><p>“Took me awhile to figure out too, but once you know, it’s obvious.”</p><p>“Is there a way to make it stop?” he said, referring to the unrelenting pain in his chest.</p><p>Father laughed.  “Sorry my boy.  Not a one. We must learn to bear it.”</p><p>“What kind of help is that?”</p><p>“No help at all.”</p><p>“But I ache, with no end in sight.  He’s pissed at me.”  In fact, Clinton was probably sitting on the porch swing, plotting his death right now.</p><p>“You’ll need to do what you’d do with any dragon.  Tame him.”</p><p>“What are you telling him, Charles Weasley?” Dad says, carting with him a sleepy looking Molly.  She was sweetly sucking her soother, her Weasley-red hair a bit of a mess.  Her head was on Daddy’s shoulder, her eyes starting to droop.</p><p>“About how easy it was to tame you to do all my bidding,” Papa said taking the current Weasley baby from him.</p><p>Dad looks to the sky.  “Merlin.  I remember that.  Did he tell you what he did to me, Gid?  The nerve.”</p><p>“You loved every minute, Potter,” Father said pulling him in for a kiss, one that made Dad smile ear to ear.  It was easy to see that despite Dad’s words; he was still and forever smitten with his dragon tamer.  “And then I spanked the life out of him, and he was mine forever.”</p><p>Dad laughed.  “You’d better go take the fuming Malfoy home, Gid.  Could you collect people for me?  We’re going to attempt to have dinner together.  See if either Grampa, or both will join.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>Gideon strode out to the front porch feeling a bit nervous, but it was all gone when he watched Clinton fall, with nothing he could do about it.  Fast as Gideon was, the fall was already in motion and Clinton was on his arse.  His jacket was on the porch swing, his boots tucked under, he had been practicing some jumpy, spinning-in-air dance move and he landed wrong.  Gideon raced over.  “I’m fine, I’m fine!” Clinton said annoyed holding his left foot.</p><p>“Let me see it.”</p><p>Clinton stared at him the longest time, then moved his hair behind his ear – did he just? Yeah he did – but deepened his scowl.  “Fine, but I warn you, my feet aren’t pretty.  They’re dancer’s feet and beat to shite.”</p><p>Clint wasn’t kidding.  They resembled what Gideon’s body did right now from taming dragons.  “These are terrible.  What were you doing?  Do you have to dance out here in your bare feet?”</p><p>“I don’t see what concern it is of yours, Gideon,” he said smirking <em>and</em> once again was touching his hair, this time running a few fingers through it.  Oh.  <em>Oooooh.</em>  Was he flirting, maybe?  “And it’s called a <em>tour en l’air</em>.  I got bored sitting, waiting for you.”</p><p>Gideon cupped Clinton’s mangled, bleeding dancer’s foot in both his large hands allowing his dragon energy to soothe it.  “Why did you wait?”</p><p>“Because Uncle Charlie told me I had to.  Scorp has already been by to tell me we’re having dinner soon, so if we could finish whatever <em>this</em> is, I’d appreciate it.”</p><p>Clinton was adorable when he got cross.  “Right.  How’s the foot?”</p><p>“It’s fine.  Mostly.  Maybe a healing spell right there if you don’t mind?  Not too much though, it’s worse dancing when my feet are fresh.”</p><p>Gideon nodded, and pulled out his wand to perform a healing spell Dad taught him.  “Put your boots and jacket back on.  I’m walking you home.”</p><p>“Have you always been this bossy?” Clinton said, but for once, doing as bid by Gideon.</p><p>“I have.”</p><p>“Why are we walking?” Clinton asked when they were on their way.  Clinton did not have his apparition license yet, he wouldn’t get it until next year, but Gideon had and could simply apparate them both.</p><p>“Because I said we are, besides, isn’t it a lovely day?”</p><p>Clinton twisted his lips but shoved his hands in his jacket pocket and followed.  It wasn’t a long walk, but it was some distance across the sanctuary.  Uncle Draco had insisted on lots of space around their home.  “You’re pathetic,” Clinton stated.</p><p>Gideon really was.  He didn’t answer.</p><p>“You’re still not going to say anything, aren’t you?”</p><p>Thing was, Gideon didn’t know what to say.  He was a man of actions and he spoke through them.  Words not so much, just like Father.  “No.  Not so much.”</p><p>They walked some more.  “But you’re cross at me.  I’d like you, not to be,” Clinton said.</p><p>“This is easily remedied by you not mucking about near water.  Problem solved.”</p><p>“I’m just supposed to do as you say, that it?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Giiid,” he whined.  “You’re being totally unreasonable.”</p><p>Gideon stopped.  “You don’t think I know that?  I’m sorry, but it’s the way it is.”  He continued back walking.  They were quiet until they reached the house.  Gideon felt like a heel knowing Clinton was somewhat upset with him, while Gideon still held a bit of annoyance at Clint.  What was the point arguing further though?  Gideon wouldn’t have him falling in and drowning; there would be no talking him out of that.  Anything more was wasted arguing.</p><p>When they got to house, Clinton stormed away, and Gideon let him go.  He deserved that for being a coward.  He found Lily with the Grampas and Brax having tea.  Lily had grown into her dragon tamer heritage.  The once thin girl, was laden with large muscles now, huge delts framed her neck, and enormous quads flexing down her legs.  Even with all the muscle, she held a feminine grace.  The combination made her exquisite and deadly.  Her flaming red, Weasley hair whipped when she moved, and everyone at the table was enraptured by whatever she was telling them.  “Hello all,” Gideon said.</p><p>“Gid,” Grampa Sev said.  “You come for tea?”</p><p>“I’ve come to collect Prince-Weasley creatures.  Dad wants a family dinner, he’s extended the invite to the pair of you.”</p><p>“I see.  What do you think, Luci-Lu, dinner with manic Weasley creatures, or white-haired snakes?”</p><p>Grampa Lu laughed.  “Whichever, but Sev, I did promise a certain little girl I’d be here to put her to bed.”</p><p>“Okay then.  We’ll both come.”</p><p>“Do you know how many are here?” Gideon asked.</p><p>“Arthur is here with Junior, and Trenton with Leith somewhere,” Grampa Lu told him.</p><p>Great.  Trenton and Leith could be anywhere, and no his bad mood over Clinton had not evaporated.</p><p>“Oh, and we brought Grace and Claire with us, who took off with Archie somewhere.  My guess is the playroom,” Grampa Sev said.  “We’ll grab them and take them with us.”</p><p>“And I’ll hunt for Trenton,” Lily said.  Gideon could tell she knew something was off with him.  “Grab Arthur.”</p><p>Gideon did head off in the direction of Lucius’s room, but as he went up the stairs, he could hear noises coming from the direction of the library, like maybe someone was struggling.  He went into help.  “Oh, Merlin!” Gideon said, turning his eyes away from his half-dressed brother and an even less dressed Lucius. “What are you two doing?”</p><p>“Fuck.”  They both scrambled for their clothes and began dressing quickly.</p><p>“Please don’t say anything,” Lucius began.  “We just… we didn’t plan it.  It just happened.  One-time thing.”</p><p>His brother didn’t look pleased with that news and was quiet as he pulled up his trousers.</p><p>“Gid, say you’ll keep quiet about this.  You know what will happen and each of the ways the adults will kill me if they find out.”</p><p>Gideon did, but he couldn’t hold a secret like this.  “You know I can’t.”</p><p>“Look, it won’t happen again,” Arthur said, and Gideon got the impression he meant it.</p><p>“Everyone is going to have kittens you two.  How could you do this?”  Gideon ran a hand through his hair frustrated, which was why he noticed when Lucius did it and stared at his tall, strong, younger brother.</p><p>Merlin.  It was worse than he thought.  Was Lucius in love with Arthur?  He couldn’t be.  Lucius probably already had some arranged marriage he was locked into.  The parents hadn’t said yet, but Gideon wouldn’t put it past them all.  Malfoy <em>and</em> Eastcastle heritage was strongly for it.</p><p>“We’re sorry, Gid,” Lucius said.</p><p>Lucius was two years older than Gideon, but he usually felt like a younger ‘brother’, cousin, whatever they were.  “Look, we’ll deal with this later.  For now, Arthur, get home.  We’re having dinner.”</p><p>Arthur nodded and Gideon left them.  This was the icing on the cake for him.  His sharp dragon tamer boots clicked along the floor as he walked out, but he was stopped by someone calling after him.  “Gideon!  <em>Weasley</em>!”</p><p><em>Clinton.</em>  Gideon turned around, fire blazing through him.  “What?”</p><p>Clinton took a brave, breath.  “I’m still cross at you for Nicholas.”</p><p>“Nicholas?  My high school boyfriend?”  Gideon hadn’t dated much, but once Father had permitted Lily to date Abraxas, he’d asked if that might be all right for him too.  Even though Lily was younger, she began dating before him – her mate happened to be the same age as her – but anyway, Gideon had always been far more interested in dragons than anything else.  He hadn’t given much thought to dating until Lily had.  “You were twelve.”</p><p>“I know, but you’re supposed to be mine, aren’t you?”</p><p>Gideon’s heart caught in his throat.  He had never said as much to Clinton, yet he knew.  “Yes.  Well, could you stop being cross at me about that?”</p><p>“Only if you stop being cross at me for today.”</p><p>“You haven’t promised to stay away from large bodies of water, as I’ve asked.”</p><p>“You demanded, but I should think that it goes without saying that I will.”</p><p>Gideon was confused.  “Why would it go without saying?”</p><p>Clinton did it again, ran a hand through his Malfoy hair.  “I always do what you tell me.”</p><p>“You do not.”</p><p>“Well, not when I’m put out with you, or being a fucking brat, but the important things.  Always.”</p><p>Gideon squinted at him.  “Like what?”</p><p>“Like when I showed up to see Jonathan late last summer and you went off at me walking over in the dark, alone.  I haven’t since.”</p><p>Gideon thought about it.  No, he hadn’t.  “What else?”  Gideon very much liked this topic.  It was soothing him; calming him down.</p><p>“You didn’t like that my dance schedule left little room for anything else.”</p><p>“I said that?”</p><p>Clinton whacked him.  “You know you did.  Several times.  I’ve made as many adjustments as I could to appease you.  I figured I had since you’d stopped griping about it.”</p><p>He might remember that.  And yes, that was why he’d stopped griping.  “I don’t like what it does to your feet.”</p><p>“Too bad.  Nothing I can do about that.  You’re going to have to live with it.”</p><p>Gideon knew that he would.  It wouldn’t be easy, his dragon heart would tug at him fiercely, but he could find a way for that much.</p><p>“Besides, I have to live with this,” Clinton said, picking up the hand that had been missing the finger earlier.  “And whatever else I can’t see I can guess is there.”</p><p>“All right, point you.”  Gideon hoped Clinton would keep holding his hand, but he let go of it.</p><p>“Come watch me dance tomorrow night?”</p><p>Gideon nodded.  He’d been planning on it anyway.  “Your wish is my command, love.”</p><p>Clinton blushed, and bit his lip, <em>and</em> pushed his hair back.  “You’re so not fair.”</p><p>“Never said I was, but what about this time?”</p><p>“You make me a tad speechless and I’m not used to that.  Do you know how hard it was to come out here?”</p><p>Right.  Clinton had been brave approaching Gideon like this, it was time for Gideon to step up.  It was easier with fire-breathing dragons though, right now he was out of his element.  “I kind of enjoy making you speechless.”  Gideon took Clinton’s hand.  “Thank you for coming out here.  I feel a world better.  If it helps, you make me speechless too.”</p><p>Clinton rolls his eyes.  “Merlin help us then.  You’re already taciturn as it is.”</p><p>“I’m a dragon tamer, I’ll have you know.  We don’t need words.”</p><p>“All right then dragon tamer.  We okay?”</p><p>Gideon wanted to kiss him so badly, but it wasn’t the right time.  Gideon might be twenty and allowed to date as he pleased for the most part, but Clinton was still sixteen and he would have to talk to Uncle Noah first.  Probably after the Arthur, Lucius thing was sorted.  <em>Merlin.</em></p><p>
  
“Good.  I have to go practice.”
</p><p>
 Gideon winced without meaning to.  He was going to practice on his torn-up feet.  “Not for too long.”
</p><p>
  “Not for too long,” he agreed.
</p><p>
  Gideon squeezed his hand and let it go.  “Tomorrow night then?”
</p><p>
  “Or you could come back after dinner.”  Again, with the touching of the hair.  Dad was right about Malfoys – how had he missed it before?  Right, he’d been too distracted worrying over him.
</p><p>
  “I don’t think so tiny dancer.”  Clinton pouted, and it nearly broke Gideon, but it was his role to do what the right thing for the situation would be.  “Besides, I’ve got to help out at home.  Behave yourself.”
</p><p>
  Clinton nodded.  “Night, Gid.”
