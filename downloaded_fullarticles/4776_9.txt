<p>Bellatrix and Lucius had insisted that the Dark Lord to go to his quarters and sleep or as they put it: 'get some rest before going to check if the mission was complete.' They did not understand that he was <em><strong>Voldemort</strong></em>, he didn't <strong><em>need</em></strong> sleep, sleep was a sign of weakness. Nonetheless; Tom walked over to the king-sized bed which was covered in porpoise sheets with alternate grey and ivory pillows, got under the blankets, and closed his eerie red eyes soon falling into a deep slumber.</p>
<p>In his peripheral vision, Tom could see a four-poster bed with deep maroon curtains. He instantly knew where he was; the Gryffindor dorm room. This was fifth year all over again. Tom was in Harry's head and the latter was completely unaware as he kept writing in a journal that looked oddly familiar to Tom. His subconscious clicked reminding him that this was the same journal Lily had kept on her nightstand on the night he went to kill Harry Potter when he, himself got turned into ash instead.</p>
<p>The broken-souled man looked down to his, or rather Harry's, hands. They were no longer slim, like a skeleton. They were a healthy brown with ragged and torn nails, a clear sign of how nervous Harry was when alone. In his hands was a self-inking quill and Harry was writing at a lightning speed. He was pouring his complete thought process in that small, frayed notebook; little did the 16-year-old know, Tom caught most of what was written before Harry closed the notebook and locked it into the bottom of his trunk.</p>
<p>Tom woke up with a start and sat upright in his bed trying to remember what exactly Harry had written in that journal.</p>

  <em> 'To Mum,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> It gets harder with each day. I know Draco Malfoy is up to something, I just don't know what. Dumbledore has been making me meet him every other day for the past two months, we are trying to plan the downfall of Voldemort but Dumbledore says that we are still missing an intricate detail of Voldemort's past and we need to find it before Easter Break. It gets increasingly difficult for me because I know Malfoy is on the wrong side of this war, I want to convince him to come on our side but I know he will only refuse. Draco is in big trouble, I can [somehow] feel it. I want to save him mum, I just don't know how. Hermione can't even help me because she is going through her own crisis and not to be rude to Ron, but he can be quite useless. Ginny is important to me but more in a sisterly way than a romantic way. I cannot be wondering about who I fancy or don't right now! I need to prepare for a war. I know what I have to do but I do not feel completely ready. Normal 16-year-olds only need to worry about their exams and if their family and friends are doing alright. Please give me answers Mum, I miss you. And dad. Sirius too. Love, Harry.' </em>
</p>
<p>Although Tom found the diary entry somewhat endearing, he could only think of how he could use this <strong><em>against</em></strong> the boy. He was sure he would find a way soon. He was now sure of how Harry felt about this war, he was afraid but confident.</p>
<p>This was going to be entertaining. And find a way he did, even if it did take him one year.</p>
