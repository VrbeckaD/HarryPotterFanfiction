    <p class="western" align="justify">It was interesting how the news could draw a picture, which let an event sound far greater then it actually was. The news that Gellert Grindelwald had been defeated had spread like a wildfire, and even now, three weeks later, it still was mentioned in the news with the same euphoria then it had been on the first day.</p><p class="western" align="justify">This euphoria in some parts was even in MACUSA. The employees had been under pressure for the last few months, years even. There had been reports on what was going on in Europe. Some things might have been hearsay, but the rumours and facts were terrifying nonetheless. Fanatical wizards, attacking No-Majs in bright daylight. Kidnappings, killings. People disappearing without a trace. And it all had been the acts of a dark wizard, more powerful then any there had been before.</p><p class="western" align="justify">Gellert Grindelwald. Only three weeks ago that name alone could struck fear into the hearts of the bravest and boldest Aurors. Many had been searching for him, and many had found their death in doing so. The darkest wizard of the century. The press was not exaggerating when they had given him that name. Grindelwald was powerful, brutal, and nothing seemed to have stood in his way.</p><p class="western" align="justify">It felt almost surreal for Seraphina Picquery. The President of MACUSA was standing in her office, and sipped a cup of coffee. Seraphina was a tall woman of African-American descendants and had black hair with a golden curl in it. Her fingers were manicured perfectly, and she wore a long, glamorous dark dress with a silver thunderbird emblem stitched upon it, together with a black turban. Usually, she had a very intimidating and majestic appearance.</p><p class="western" align="justify">However, right now she looked less intimidating then a scarecrow. Picquery had rings under her eyes and kept rebalancing herself on her legs. Her make-up had to be reapplied what felt like every ten minutes. She had to resist the urge to snarl at people or yell at her employees for the dumbest and tiniest reasons possible. And the entire reason for her stress and agitation was the newspaper, laying on her desk.</p><p class="western" align="justify">In big, black block letters the following words were written upon it:</p><p class="western" align="center">
  <b>GELLERT GRINDELWALD CAPTURED</b>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">The dark wizard, Gellert Grindelwald, which has been terrorizing the Wizarding World for almost three years, has been captured the early evening in a subway station in New York City. A group of Aurors, lead by President Seraphina Picquery, have found Mister Grindelwald and managed to capture him with the help of British magizoologist, Newt Scamander.</p><p class="western" align="justify">What precisely has been happening down in the subway station has not been told to us by the government officials, however an insider could reveal to us, that it all had to do with the mysterious destruction of New York City by, what has now been confirmed, an Obscurus, which has been killed on Madam President’s orders. Moreover, rumours seem to have been confirmed, that Gellert Grindelwald has been disguising himself as the Director of Magical Security, Mister Percival Graves.</p><p class="western" align="justify">Right now Gellert Grindelwald is in one of the high security cells of MACUSA and awaiting trail. However many questions are still –</p><p class="western" align="justify">The rest of the text was not readable for the newspaper had been folded in the middle. On occasions Picquery would turn her head to glare at it as if she wished to let it go up in flames and burn to ash. Of course the disappearance of the newspaper did not equal the disappearance of her problems. She was not so stupid to kid herself in this regard.</p><p class="western" align="justify">Seraphina could not share into the euphoria and joy that the public had given into so easily. With the capture of Grindelwald, her work sadly was not completed. In fact, she now felt like she was even more stressed out. There were still so many unanswered questions, that needed to be solved. And she did not have time for solving them! Or rather the time she had was running out.</p><p class="western" align="justify">There was a knock at her door. Picquery quickly rose her cup and drunk another large gulp of coffee to hide her scolding face. “Enter”, she commanded. The door opened and two Aurors entered. One of them was a man, the other one a woman. The man was tall and wore a long, black waistcoat. His short, curly, brown hair was covered with a bowler. His cheekbones were prominent, just as his eyebrows. Green eyes glimmered in worry.</p><p class="western" align="justify">The woman was shorter and had a fair skin. Her brown hair was hidden under a small hat of her own, and she wore a long, blue coat, which almost hid her timid frame. The brown eyes darted around anxiously, and she kept burying her hands into her pockets. Next to the tall man, she almost disappeared in his shadow, however when Picquery turned her attention to her, Porpentina Goldstein steeled her stance.</p><p class="western" align="justify">Madam President slowly placed her cup on the desk. She took a deep breath and tried to compose herself. The President had given orders to Tobias Oates, her chief auror and, since Graves was gone now, temporarily Director of Magical Security, and Porpentina to report anything regarding Grindelwald towards her. They were tasked with something immensely difficult. It was no use if she worried them unnecessarily by showing just how stressed out she was. It was lonely on the top indeed.</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>Seraphina took a deep breath and then asked with a voice, which hardly trembled to her pleasure: “Is there any news?” Good. At least her voice did not betray any of her fears, anxieties and nerves, which were laying blank. </span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify"><span><span><span>Tobias Oates kept his hands in his pockets. He let out a slow sigh. His voice was deep and calming, but that did not make the message any sweeter:</span></span></span> <span><span><span>“No, Madam President. Everything is still like it is three weeks ago. He does not eat much, probably just enough to get by. He refuses to give us any information. He does not speak. He just stares at us, sitting in his cell. Waiting.”</span></span></span></p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>Pi</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>c</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>query blinked in disbelief. This did not feel right. She had expected Grindelwald to at least do </span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <em>
      <span>something</span>
    </em>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>! “</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>He does not do anything, Mr Oates?”, she reassured herself, “No mockery? No gloating?” Mister Oates shook his head. </span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>“</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>No, nothing”, he said.</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>Piquery rolled her eyes. She asked: “</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>Have our Aurors managed to penetrate his mind at least?” Maybe in this field there had been some success. However Tina stepped forwards and confirmed: “We tried. But it is fruitless.” The brown haired woman rose her arms helplessly to underline her next words. “His mind...it is too well protected. It is not like you run against a wall </span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>like</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span> with most criminals. It is more like, I dunno how to put this, Madam President, but it is like his mind attacks us once we try to penetrate it. Nobody has been able to dodge the attacks. It is like facing a wall of poisonous snakes. We all got knocked out.”</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">“<span><span><span>Great, just great.” Seraphina slowly rubbed her </span></span></span><span><span><span>temples</span></span></span><span><span><span> as she listened to the way Grindelwald was outmanoeuvring them all. </span></span></span><span><em><span>He takes me for a fool!</span></em></span><span><span><span> It upset her greatly. They had caught the most darkest wizard of the century, which had been a feed in itself, and yet it seemed he still was having everything under control. The feeling of being presented like a puppet on a stage enraged Seraphina.</span></span></span></p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>But that was not even her major concern. “</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>I know, you are worried about Mr. Graves. We are trying our best. I can assure you that.” It was as if Porpentina Goldstein had read her mind. Picquery tried not to flinch. Had her worry been this obvious? Ever since she had learned that Grindelwald had replaced Percival Graves, she had been filled with shame and anger towards her own self. How could she not have noticed something so crucial? </span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">Moreover, what consequences had her foolishness caused? How long had Graves been impersonated? Picquery could not tell! It could be only a few weeks and days, but it could also be months! What had happened to Graves in these months? He could have been tortured. He probably had been. And she had noticed nothing! Nothing!</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>Tobias spoke slowly as if he did not want to anger the president further: “</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>Madam President, I know that you hope for him to be alive and that we must find him… But you also have to understand that there is the possibility that he might be -” </span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>He was cut short be an enraged Picquery, who shouted: </span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>“</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>I know what the </span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <em>
      <span>worst</span>
    </em>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span> possibility is, Mister Oates! Do not act like I am some young newbie in the Auror department. I trained alongside Mr. Graves, who as you know very well trained you. So please, spare me this long talk and get to your point! Is there any chance that we can find Mr. Graves?” She had moved up to him and now pointed a finger at him, demanding an answer.</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>Mr. Oates backed away and took a deep breath. Brushing his large hand through his dark, short hair, he admitted: “</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>I…don’t know, Madam President. As long as Grindelwald refuses to cooperate, I am rather </span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>p</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>essimistic.” He dropped his head. Picquery slowly lowered her arm and her heart sank. What to do? What method of getting an answer had they not yet tried? How did you force an answer out of someone, who refused to talk? By torture? They had already tried to rip the memories out of Grindelwald’s brain, and Seraphina had seen how well this worked.</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>There was a quiet cough. Picquery slowly turned her head. Tina was pulling at her sleeves, an action she often did when she was nervous. Shifting in her stance again and again, she finally blurted out: “</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>Madam President, I hate to bring this subject into debate, but we haver received a few letters from the other governments. They will sent their delegates to discuss who may put Gellert Grindelwald on trail. In fact, they are already on their way and will probably arrive in three days.”</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">“<span><span><span>Three days? This cannot get any worse. Grindelwald, you cunt!” The words were out before Picquery could stop them. Tina and Mr. Oates took a step back as if someone had slapped them in the face. The</span></span></span><span><span><span>y</span></span></span><span><span><span> shared odd glances, before Mr. Oates said anxiously: </span></span></span><span><span><span>“</span></span></span><span><span><span>Madam President! Your language...”</span></span></span></p><p class="western" align="justify">“<span><span><span>Don’t give me a lecture about my language now, Mister Oates!”, Seraphina replied and gestured angrily, cheeks red in her rage, “I am supposed to appear before a group of delegates in three days in perfect condition and present some kind of result. Where is the result?! We do not have a result! Heck, we did not even manage to get the possible whereabouts of our Director of Magical Security after three </span></span></span><span><em><span>bloody</span></em></span><span><span><span> weeks! We will appear as incompetent and stupid before everybody else. So, I am not sorry, Mister Oates, but I do not give a flying feather about my language right now!”</span></span></span></p><p class="western" align="justify">“<span><span><span>Okay...”, Mr. Oates started, however once again Madam President shut him down quit</span></span></span><span><span><span>e</span></span></span><span><span><span> effectively: </span></span></span><span><span><span>“</span></span></span><span><span><span>Don’t okay my face! I know you actually wanna say more. I am done with this.” She headed outside, still talking. “I am gonna talk with Grindelwald myself. By Merlin’s dog’s dog shit!”</span></span></span></p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>Tina and Mr. Oates followed suit. “Merlin’s dog’s dog shit?”, repeated the reinstated Auror with a hushed whisper, “</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>Mercy Lewis, she must be mad.” The chief Auror gave no reply to that, however Porpentina could tell that he was equally worried. They followed Seraphina Picquery, who lead them in a straight line through the Auror Department. They all climbed into a small, golden lift, which resembled more a bird cage then a lift, and rushed down.</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>The lift halted in a darker and less glamorous corridor. The walls were made of solid stone, and there was a line of gas lamps, hanging from the ceiling, above their heads. In the dull, orange light one could see a large, metal door. Picquery stepped towards it and drew out her wand. Thrusting it into the lock, which seemed to be encased in the door, she turned it around.</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>There was a faint blue glow, followed by a series of clicking sounds as dozens of bolts, cocks, bars and more minor locks unravelled themselves. Leaning against the door, which opened incredibly slowly, Picquery, Mr. Oates and Miss Goldstein entered a smaller section, where a group of Aurors patrolled. They spun around upon seeing the small group, before they nodded and relaxed again. At the other side of the section was yet another door, similar to the one through which the group had come.</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>They had to repeat this tiring process of reopening a door like this four more times, before they finally came into a new area. In every section where either Aurors positioned or charms so powerful they had to turn them off, if they did not want to be vaporized. However finally they reached what they had come for. The four or five high security cells of MACUSA. They were all lieing next to each other. A massive square for each and every prisoner. Aside from the iron bars every cell had, these cells also were equipped with a massive, magical shield and dozens of charms to prevent any possible escape.</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>Picquery brushed over her dress collar for a second, before she lifted her head and strode downstairs, reaching the cell in the middle of the room, which held Grindelwald. He was sitting on the small bench which served as his bed. The short, spiky, pale blond hair was uncombed and unwashed. His thin eyebrows knitted, and his eyes were closed. The prisoner cloak hang around him, and he looked like he had not eaten much. Around his feet was a chain.</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>Grindelwald rose his head, when Picquery stopped before him. His mismatched eyes lit up in disdain. One black and one blue. He carefully folded his hands together. His back straightened, and with a haughty look he smiled at her. From the way he held himself, it looked like he was not a prisoner at all. It made Picquery’s stomach turn in rage.</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>The President responded his arrogance with all the hatred and rage she could muster. She was here for a clear reason. Sometimes the fact that there were politics in place really was a burden. For right now all Picquery wanted was to sentence this man to dead. Let him walk into the Black Void, which would ate him up. Miss Goldstein had told her how Grindelwald had sentenced her and Mr. Scamander to death without consulting anybody.</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>While this was nothing new to Seraphina, she was still enraged. She knew Graves! Percival may too sentence people to death, however he never ever abused this power. He never let innocent people face the Black Void. The fact that Grindelwald valued life so little, and had almost let one of her own Aurors (well, ex-Aurors during this time) die, made Picquery hate him even more.</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>Picquery took a deep breath and forced her hatred as deep down her guts as she could possibly muster. Her voice was strict and clear as she spoke: “Mr. Grindelwald, my Aurors have told me that you have not answered any of their questions. You have to understand that your refusal to cooperate can have dire consequences for you.” He stared at her, not bothering to give a reply. His eyes seemed to peer into her soul and the look clearly laughed at her. Laughed at her fruitless efforts to gain information. Laughed at the entire world for not being one step closer to their end goal. Laughed at their incompetence, complexity and foolishness.</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>Had he no idea what actually awaited him? Was he so blind and unaware of his own bad fortune? Of how unlucky his position was? Picquery tried it yet again: “You are already in a very bad position and when the other delegates arrive, your sentence will be done within probably a few days. If you wish to have any chance to get out of this alive and merely have a prison sentence, you have to cooperate.”</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>The urgency and sharpness in her voice did not seem to have the desired effect. Gellert did not change in any way or position. How could one man keep it up to sit there, glaring at her and not saying a word? He had held such an impressive speech in the underground. Where was that fire now? Why was he not lashing out at her?</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>Picquery decided to change the subject. There was one question she had to ask. One question that burned in her guts. “Your silence won’t do you anything good here. It won’t get me anywhere nor you.” The President slowly shook her head, before she stated: “At least tell me what has happened with my Director of Magical Security! Where is Percival Graves?”</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>She was not sure what she had been expecting. Maybe an answer. Even if it were the conformation that Graves was indeed dead. Maybe even a sneer or a laugh as the other one would mock her for her clear attachment. But it was nothing compared to what Grindelwald did. He remained silent and forced his face to relax. And in his mismatched eyes Picquery saw her own desperation and worry, reflected back upon her.</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <em>
      <span>Look at you</span>
    </em>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>, those eyes said, </span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <em>
      <span>You are claiming to be a leader, but you are not able to handle a single threat. You are lost without Graves at your side. You cannot defend your nation. You cannot handle my danger. You could not even handle a tiny Obscurus, ravaging through New York. What are you protecting? Not your wizarding community. You protect your pride.</span>
    </em>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>Seraphina’s eyes barely widened. She felt like her heart skipped a beat. No one knew that this was her worst fear and sin. No, no! She was imagining things. Grindelwald could not read her like that! It was impossible. She had build her persona too much to crack now. And she would not give him the satisfaction that he had shaken her by doing nothing. He was her prisoner! She had to remember that. She was the President, she was the one that had him behind bars, she was the one in control.</span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>Her voice now did not hide her disdain and hatred as she snarled: “Fine. If this is your only reaction to this, I shall take it as your last word. I won’t consult you any longer in what happens with you, Mr. Grindelwald. Just know that the chance that you will be sentenced to death has risen drastically. But then we all know that you most certainly deserve it, you monster.”</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>Picquery spun around on her heels and marched towards the door. Tina and Mr. Oates followed. They had remained oddly quiet during the entire conversation. “I should have expected that”, growled Seraphina as the first door began to shut behind them, “Old school. Nothing will be told.”</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</p><p class="western" align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>Gellert Grindelwald was still sitting on the bench in his cell. He slowly leaned back and his shoulder blades touched the wall. One of his hands slowly wandered over the smooth stone, and as his fingers graced a shadow, an odd twitch laid in the darkness. But maybe that was just a trick of the light. Grindelwald smiled.</span>
    </span>
