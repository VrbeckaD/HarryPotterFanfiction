    <p>            He was dying.  There was no doubt about it.  That potion Severus had given him was a poison, and a cruel one at that.  While he’d known in some nebulous fashion that he’d be paying the price for his father’s failure, he hadn’t quite prepared himself for the molten agony twisting his innards to slag inside him.</p><p>Groaning loudly, the Malfoy heir curled up in a tight ball on his bed, his body drenched with sweat and the fine sheets twisted about him.  His breath came in ragged pants, interrupted only by strangled screams into his pillow as he struggled against the surging agony which had become his life.</p><p>Damn that Potter!  It was all his fault!  It was always his fault!  Getting his father arrested!  Dragging their fine name through the muck and infuriating the Dark Lord!  His mother had done what she could to lessen his anger, but they all knew that punishment could not be avoided.  Still… he hadn’t expected this!</p><p>Writhing on the bed, he felt the pain shift, becoming lower, hotter, as if a searing blade was being drawn through his abdomen to his groin.</p><p>Biting back another scream, he dimly heard the door to his room open.  An offense which normally would have been greeted with vicious hex’s was now ignored.  Perhaps the intruder would kill him quickly and be done with it?</p><p>The cool cloth placed on his forehead was unexpected, as was the gentle hand carefully rolling him onto his back.</p><p>“It will all be over soon."</p><p>“You… you poisoned me!  You son of a bitch!”  He growled out through clenched teeth, pulling away from his godfather and glaring at him through pain filled tears.   Rather than denying his actions, Severus simply met his eyes.  Those normally flat and unreadable black orbs were for the briefest of moments, filled with unfathomable sorrow. </p><p>“We do what we must to survive.  Never forget that.”  Bloody cryptic bastard!  Couldn’t he see that he was in pain!?!?</p><p>The man sat with him silently as eventually, the cramps began to fade, allowing him to slowly sit up, and then roll over just enough to vomit up the contents of his stomach into a rather large bucket which had so conveniently been provided. </p><p>“Bastard.”  He muttered, spitting the foul dregs from his mouth.  He was given no reply other than a cool glass of water being held out to him.  Taking it roughly and nearly spilling the contents on his bed, Draco sullenly sipped at it, swishing the sweet cool water around in his mouth before spitting it into the bucket like some… muggle!</p><p>“Wash yourself.  You stink.”  Severus commanded in a voice which left no room for debate.  It was a voice Draco knew well, and also knew that no amount of whining or stalling would change his order.  “When you’re clean, put on this robe and meet us downstairs.  The Dark Lord wishes to speak to you.”</p><p>Suddenly, the room felt chill and he felt his abused guts clench.</p><p>“But… I was just punished… that was it right?”  He hated how scared he sounded, how small.</p><p>“No.  That was to ensure you survived what was to come.”  Standing up and squaring his shoulders, Severus turned towards the door, then paused and glanced back at the pale and scared boy on the bed.  “Be strong Draco… you can endure this.” </p><p>There was something in the tone of his voice that made Draco suddenly unsure if he actually wanted to. </p><p>“Now hurry along.  The longer the Dark Lord is kept waiting, the worse his mood will be.”  Without further preamble, he turned on his heel and left, shutting the door firmly behind him. </p><p>For a moment, Draco sat there, staring at the door, then slowly, he turned to look at the nearest window, it was open, the late summer breeze gently fluttering the curtains, beckoning him to escape.  It would be so easy, just slip away from it all.  Take his broom and fly back to Hogwarts, or to one of the family’s villas?  There were enough of them, one had to be unknown to the Dark Lord and his followers… but… that would leave his mother to face his wrath alone. </p><p>He was a coward, he could admit that to himself, but even he had limits.</p><p>Trembling in dread, Draco stood up on shaky legs and pressed a hand against his tender abdomen.  The pain was gone now, nothing but a memory, but there was still an ache, a feeling that something wasn’t quite right.  Still, he trusted Severus with his life.  Whatever that potion had done… it was for the best.  He had to believe that.</p><p>“Damn you Potter.”  He snarled softly to himself, throwing the glass against the wall hard enough to shatter the fine crystal and send water praying in all directions.  “This is all your fault!”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Ah, dear sweet little Draco.”  The Dark Lord purred softly, stalking around the kneeling form at his feet, a cruel smile playing across his face.  The expression looked more like a knife slash across his face than any human mouth, and it was about as inviting.  “Your father has failed me Draco.  Failed me most terribly.  Did you know that?”  In the surrounding darkness, he could hear the muted hisses of the Death Eaters gathered around them, filling the air with tense anticipation in their eagerness to see the untouchable Malfoy heir brought low.</p><p>Old pride reared its head in the youth, causing him to straighten his back, square his shoulders and raise his head.  Not enough to dare to meet the serpentine eyes of the Dark Lord, but enough to see the swish and swirl of those loose midnight black robes pass by, and the masked faces beyond.</p><p>“H…he s.s..sought only to serve you M- my Lord.”  Terror caused his throat to clench, forcing a stutter which only made the masked men chuckle rather intimidatingly.  Don’t be afraid!  He chided himself mentally.  You know these men!  Vince and Crabbe’s fathers were there, and Severus!  He refused to let word get back to his classmates that he was a simpering coward!</p><p>“Serve me.”  The words were spat out, filled with contempt.  “Defeated by school children!  Captured by the Ministry.  He is a failure and shall face the appropriate punishment!”  Draco couldn’t keep from flinching at the sharpness of the words and the rage within them.  Inside, his mind was already babbling in terror.  He’d heard stories of what happened to those who failed the Dark Lord, what happened to their children… Bitten, turned… no longer pure, no longer even human!  He’d rather die than face such an ignoble fate!</p><p>“But, you are of the line of the Sacred Twenty Eight… and it would be a shame to spill such… pure blood.”  As he spoke, his voice became an oily purr and cold leathery feeling fingers carded through his hair, making him shudder and cringe away in disgust.  It took every ounce of will in his body to hold still and accept the touch. </p><p>“I require one of the purest blood.  A lineage unmarred by filthy muggle genes, one which produces strong heirs with powerful magical cores.  There were of course many options, a veritable treasure trove of potentials… but alas, they lacked the one most essential trait.”  The hair on the back of his neck stood on end at the tone of the dark wizard’s voice and Draco could feel himself trembling in growing terror as he felt the trap closing around him.  “So few these days follow the old ways, the true traditions.  But then there is you… pure of blood and body.  From two of the greatest lineages in the wizarding world.  Ah, you young Draco will do wonderfully.”</p><p>“M…my Lord… we live to serve you.”  His father had been sure to instill in him and unwavering devotion to their Master.  To serve Him was to serve those of the purest blood, it was the highest honour… but, then why was he screaming inside?  Why did he want to run as far away as he could?  No!  He’d be brave for his father.  He’d prove to those masked cowards in the shadows what it meant to be a Malfoy!</p><p>“You are a lucky man young Draco.”  The Dark Lord continued.  “Few could ever hope to attain such an honoured position, but you… in your disgrace will serve me.”  Turning away from the trembling boy, Cold red eyes fixed on one of the masked figures.</p><p>“He’s taken the potion?”</p><p>“Yes My Lord.”  Draco wished that he could draw comfort from Severus’ familiar voice, but it only made him tremble harder, making him feel like a condemned man. </p><p>“Remove your robe young Malfoy.”  The command was unexpected, so much so that the words failed to register.</p><p>“M…my Lord?”  Agony tore through him, stealing the breath from his lungs and causing the pain from earlier to seem paltry in comparison.  He couldn’t draw in breath to scream, couldn’t see, nothing existed in the world beyond his suffering.  Though it lasted only for a heartbeat or two, it felt like forever, leaving Draco gasping and sobbing on the floor.</p><p>“I do not repeat myself.”  The threat was palpable, and Draco’s fingers were already fumbling clumsily at the buttons of his robe, terror stealing away his usual dexterity.  He could feel hot tears pouring down his cheeks, falling onto the now bared skin of his chest as his robe parted, revealing pale moon-kissed flesh beneath.  Somewhere in the shadowy crowd, someone groaned softly, causing the youth to blush hotly and look down at the floor.</p><p>With a flick of his wand, Voldemort sent the robes spinning off into the shadows, leaving the naked boy kneeling there on the floor trembling.  Unable to face the wall of leering masks, he closed his eyes and fervently wished that his father was here.  Then no one would dare do this to him!  Father would protect him, even from the Dark Lord!</p><p>Softly chanted words preceded a soft and not unpleasant tingle to travel through his body, making him gasp sharply.  Opening his eyes, he saw a gentle golden glow surrounding him.  It was beautiful, so pure… like staring into the sun through morning mist.  There were muffled gasps of surprise, and several murmurs of appreciation from the assembled, while The Dark Lord looked down at the trembling boy, his mouth spreading into a wide smile of triumph.</p><p>“Pure.”  He breathed the word, savoured it.  “Never been touched nor so much as kissed.  You haven’t even touched yourself in the dark of the night.  Such a good little boy.  I see that Lucious did one thing right at least.”  This time the laughter echoing from the shadows was cruel and mocking, as if he’d done something wrong or to be ashamed of, but Draco held his head up high, focussing on the Pureblood pride his Father had always lectured him about.  How a true Pureblood would never waste his seed in such a manner.  How he would save himself for marriage and not weaken his magic by indulging in such cheap pleasures of the flesh… no matter how much he might have wanted to.</p><p>Despite this, his skin blushed even hotter with embarrassment and he couldn’t quite keep from trying to cover himself with his hands. </p><p>“I will not waste my Core over such things.”  He protested, as if he needed to defend the traditional values the people around him were supposed to espouse. </p><p>“Indeed, indeed.”  The Dark Lord murmured, this time in honest appreciation, and for some reason that made Draco’s skin crawl even more.  “You truly are perfect for my needs.” </p><p>“I… I live to serve My… My Lord.”  Merlin, he loathed those words.  They felt dirty on his tongue, he could feel them choking him the more often he spoke them, and worse, those cold cruel crimson eyes seemed to know it.  They glittered with malice as they watched him, tracing over every inch of his body with slow, hungry deliberation. </p><p>“Then why do you hide yourself from my eyes?”  That vicious knife-slash smile was back, causing Draco’s skin to crawl.  “Do you seek to keep secrets from me young Draco?”</p><p>“N…no… My Lord.”  Slowly, reluctantly, he moved his hands to his sides, staring down at the floor once again and wishing desperately that this was over soon.</p><p>“Good.  Obey me, and you shall be given the greatest of honours.  Defy me, and I shall make your suffering the stuff of legends.  Your father will be considering himself blessed to be in Azkaban rather than in your shoes.”  Those cold bony fingers grabbed onto his jaw, forcing him to look up into that loathsome face.  “You will obey me.”</p><p>“Y..yes My Lord.”</p><p>“This ritual requires you to be willing.”  He continued.  “Are you here willingly young Draco?  Willing to redeem the name of your family?  To spare your dear mother more anguish?”  His heart leaped in his throat at the mention of his mother and he longed to look around for her, to see if she was hidden away in the shadows, but he couldn’t move, couldn’t tear his eyes away from that horrible crimson stare. </p><p>He knew what was at stake should he refuse.  His Father’s life… his mother’s life.  Their entire line would be snuffed out in the worst way possible if he denied the Dark Lord.  It was unthinkable!  He’d do anything, endure anything to protect them all.</p><p>“Yes.  Yes My Lord.”</p><p>“Good.”  The word was more of a bestial growl and he immediately regretted his agreement, but before he could utter a single word, ropes shot up from the ground, wrapping around his wrists and ankles.  Tightening viciously around his limbs they seemed to slide across the floor until he was kneeling on all fours like an animal.</p><p>A terrified squeak escaped from his lips as he tried to pull against them, but they were like iron.</p><p>As he struggled, The Dark Lord began to walk in a circle, chanting softly and sprinkling a strange mixture onto the floor around them.</p><p>“Αφήστε αυτό το φρούτο να γεμίσει με τον σπόρο.  Αφήστε αυτό το σπόρο να μεγαλώσει δυνατά μέσα στα ώριμα τείχη του, τρέφονται από την ατελείωτη πηγή του πόθου.”  One by one, the Death Eaters took up the chant, their voices echoing off the walls eerily, making it sound as if there were hundreds here to witness this ignoble humiliation.  He didn’t know the language, but he could certainly feel the power building up around him.  This was old magic, older than anything he’d ever felt before and its sheer alien power made him tremble in terror.</p><p>When the circle was complete, the Dark Lord raised his wand and then slashed it down sharply.  The circle flashed with a deep crimson light, runes blazing within, the likes of which he’d never seen before.</p><p>Stepping in front of the boy, the Dark Lord unfastened his cloak, throwing it outside the circle and staring down at the trembling figure at his feet.  Draco couldn’t help but stare at the inhuman body, bared now for all to see.  Long and sinuous, whipcord muscles stood out beneath leprously pale flesh.  The skeleton beneath was no longer wholly human.  The ribs were too narrow, the body too long, giving him a revolting serpentine appearance.</p><p>Repulsed in every sense of the word, Draco felt vomit once again well up in his throat as his gaze reluctantly took in the monster standing in front of him.  Deep in the very bottom of his mind, he could hear himself screaming in terror, realizing what was to be expected of him.  A horror he’d never dreamed of inflicting on his worst enemies was now him to behold, and the truest nightmare was yet to come.</p><p>No… nonono!  He pulled back against his bonds, sweat breaking out across his all too vulnerable body as his eyes were drawn to a movement between the legs of the Dark Lord, where a rather distinct bulge pressed against the leathery skin.  Something moved beneath it, twisting and contorting the flesh like a large worm beneath the earth, straining for freedom. </p><p>Shaking his head in denial, he watched in horror as the skin split open, spilling out two pale pronged and viciously spined hemipenis.  They looked more like torture devices than any viable reproductive organs and worse, the spines seemed to quiver with anticipation, a thick oily substance coating their surface, stinking or raw meat which had begun to turn, and a musty sort of musk.</p><p>Even as he looked, the substance dripped down the leprously pale length of the twinned shafts like a pale milky poison.   His stomach clenched, threatening to rebel against him and he tried to pull back, a terrified sound that didn’t even sound human escaping past his lips as his mind struggled to comprehend what he was seeing.  Voldemort’s hand shot forward, tangling in his hair and holding him still.</p><p>“Kiss them dear boy, and say Καλωσορίζω τον σπόρο σου μέσα στο σώμα μου.  Θάψτε το βαθιά”  He hissed loudly, pulling Draco’s face to the disgusting members.  One brushed against his lips, cold and stiff, he nearly lost his battle with his stomach and felt bile well up in his throat.   The fingers grew tighter with his lack of compliance, holding him steady.  “Do it, or I shall send you to Greyback and have your dear mother within this circle!”</p><p>Oh sweet Merlin, not that.  Anything but that.  He loved his mother beyond words and would do anything for her… but this…</p><p>When the fingers pulled him closer once more, he didn’t resist and felt the spines press against his lips.  They bent slightly at the pressure and that rotten musty stink grew even worse, seeming to spread to his previously untouched lips, tainting his saliva with its foulness. </p><p>Cursing his cowardice, wishing that the Dark Lord would just kill him and be done with his, he began mumbling the vile words, shuddering as each syllable caused the barbs to brush his lips, and the nauseating oil to slip into his mouth. </p><p>The words themselves had a power to them, and while he might not know what he was saying, he could feel the heavy promise within them coat his tongue like black liquorice, sliding through his mouth and into his body with every breath he took, suffusing him with the vile tainted magic.   </p><p>“Good boy.”  Voldemort hissed, releasing his hair, trailing those cold fingers along his jaw.  He didn’t pull away, allowing that vile member to continue to brush Draco’s lips, tormenting him with the promise of what was to come. </p><p>“Severus, the pearl and the bowl.  Now.” </p><p>One of the masked figures stepped forward from the group, and Draco couldn’t help but look past the disgusting genitalia filling his vision to stare up pleadingly as his godfather. </p><p>“My Lord.”  He didn’t even look at Draco, didn’t acknowledge his terror or his tear stained face which stared at him in silent desperation, begging him for rescue.  Instead, he held up his hands.  In one, there was a carved ivory bowl, etched with strange runes which seemed to match those surrounding him.  In the other, he held a large and perfect pearl which picked up the sullen crimson glow of the magic, seeming to drink it in greedily. </p><p>“Please…”  He whispered softly up to his godfather, willing him with every fiber of his being to look at him, anything!  Instead, he simple handed the items over with great reverence and bowed deeply to the vile mockery of a man in front of him.  Returning to the assembled throng of worshippers, he once again became one of many, leaving Draco alone and utterly devastated.</p><p>Chuckling at his suffering, the Dark Lord’s hand released his hair and trailed gently down his cheek, pressing his member playfully against the boy’s quivering lips, loving how the tender skin puckered so delicately with promise.  He truly was a rare gem indeed.</p><p>Tilting that lovely face up to look at him, Voldemort stared down into those shining silver eyes, so wet with tears of terror.</p><p>“Such a pretty little thing.”  He purred condescendingly down at the boy, pressing himself against those lush lips.  “You don’t deserve this honour being given to you.”  Once again, the men, gathered around them to witness this historic event chuckled in anticipation.  There was the telltale rustle as several of them no doubt clutched at themselves beneath their robes.  He could feel the boy desperately attempting to erect occulumency shields, hoping to hide himself away from the inevitable, trying to spare himself the pain and humiliation.  It reminded him of a tiny scared little rabbit hiding in the tall grass, hoping the fox will pass it by, unable to accept that it was already doomed.</p><p>Reluctantly, he pulled himself away from that silken mouth and warm teasing breath, sliding his hand down the boy’s smooth sweat slick back, feeling the finely sculpted youthful muscles of the slender form, savouring the unblemished skin until he was cupping that smoothly rounded ass in his hands, squeezing it hard enough to bruise and relishing the terrified whimper it evoked. </p><p>So pure, so tender… and it was all his to savour.</p><p>Taking his time, drawing out the moment, wanting the boy’s terror to be at its peak for no other reason that pure sadism, the Dark Lord idly traced a thin finger along the cleft of that delectable ass, teasing the delicately quivering pucker of flesh for a moment, drinking in the tear-filled gasp it wrenched from the formerly proud little pureblood boy.  He marvelled at how those muscles still clenched so tightly, desperately attempting to stop the expected intrusion.  Rather than grow angry at the implied denial, he instead laughed in delight, stroking his fingertip in lazy circles around that tiny silken skinned treasure before drifting lower, to his true prize.</p><p>There, just before the gentle swell of young testicles, wreathed in soft golden down was a delicate slit in the flesh, flushed and slick, it seemed to beckon him to plunder its incredible wealth.  The edges were swollen and new, still tender with its creation, but oh so welcoming when he slid the tip of his finger past the sweet little lips and into its silken sheath.</p><p>Slick muscles clenched around him almost instantly, fluttering wildly against the intrusion.  Glorious molten heat engulfed his fingertip, pulling him in, begging him to bury himself in its depths, to conquer this virgin territory and despoil it with his lust.</p><p>Even better was the sharp pained gasp of the boy as his little mental shields shattered at the alien intrusion, his mind struggling to comprehend what he was feeling, not realizing that his body had been forever changed to suit the whim of his Lord.</p><p>Pressing inward a little further, he could feel a fragile membrane blocking his progress.  As delicate as the lovely body which housed it, and as easily broken.  A shudder ran through the boy’s body as he moaned in terror, trying to pull away from the intrusion.  He let him… this time.</p><p>Placing the pearl on his fingertip, he rested it gently between those tight little folds of skin, letting the boy feel it’s presence, allowing anticipation to build.</p><p>At the touch of his flesh, the pearl began to glow and pulse in time with his heartbeat, acclimatizing itself to the boy’s magic, ensuring that the body wouldn’t reject it.</p><p> “Do you know what this is for dear boy?”  He asked, sliding his slick finger over the pearl and gently pressing it in, feeling the muscles tighten around it, trying to push it out, but instead only managing to draw it in deeper.  “It’s a part of you now, your magic calling to it, drawing it inside you.  There, it will rest, deep inside your womb.” </p><p>The sharp gasp the words evoked proved that the boy had no idea what had been done to him, but he was a clever child, and was quickly figuring it out.  Sadly, it was much too late to do anything about it.  The spell had been cast, all that was left was to see it to it’s ultimate and preordained conclusion.</p><p>“Your magic shall shape it, transfiguring it into an egg.  Even now, it’s changing, becoming a part of you… such a perfect intimate part.  For you see, while Severus’ clever potion has given you a womb capable of bearing life, it would take years for your eggs to mature.  Instead, your own mystical essence will do the work for us, sparing us the wait.</p><p>“It shall be bathed in my seed, ready and waiting for the magic to build up within your body, allowing life to quicken within.  Such a clever little spell don’t you think?  It is a most ancient magic, from long long ago, when we wizards walked as gods among men.  But even for gods, the creation of life isn’t easy,  and it will require the sexual energies of many, many couplings to gather enough power to activate the spell.  But when it does….”  A cold spidery hand traced across his flat stomach teasingly.  “You will grow round with my perfect pure-blooded child, with a magical core unmatched by any on this world… and then… aaaah, then, when the child is ready, I shall shed this twisted and decaying body for his!  I shall be reborn!  Perfect, beautiful and unstoppable!”</p><p>“Oh Merlin no!”  Draco gasped out, the sound wrenched from him as he tried to pull away, struggled to eject the burrowing doom he could feel sliding deeper and deeper into his body, pressing painfully against that strange barrier inside him.  His arms collapsed, unable to hold his weight, but Voldemort easily held his hips in position, chuckling cruelly.  “Please… please no…” </p><p>“Ah, but you’ve already agreed to this.”  The Dark Lord purred playfully, stroking that quivering and slick entrance with his fingertip again, enjoying how the flesh flinched away at his touch, even as it grew so much slicker.  “And such a coy little cunt.  Do you feel how it weeps for me?  Begging for me like a little whore.” </p><p>“Anything but this!”  The boy begged, his words garbled as he tried to pull away, only to find his bonds tightening, holding him in place.</p><p>“This is a great honour young Malfoy.”  Voldemort sneered, placing the small potion filled bowl on the floor between the boy’s legs.  “One would think that you would show a little gratitude.”  His other hand now free, took hold of his rigid member, stroking one of the hemipenis against the newly opened and deliciously vulnerable sex. </p><p>Draco moaned in terror as he felt the stiff spines scrape across excruciatingly sensitive skin and despite his bonds, he struggled to draw his legs together, to clench his muscles, anything to stop the promised violation.  But it was too late.  He could still feel that horrible pearl pressing against that last aching and bruised barrier of flesh, trying to worm its way into him like some parasite, condemning not only him, but the future of his family.</p><p>“Savour this moment young one.  You’re about to become the mother of a living god!”  Voldemort hissed as he positioned the pronged head of his hemepenis against that lovely opening and began to press inside.  Feeling those tight silken walls press against him, quivering so frantically, then slowly, reluctantly part was utterly exquisite.  He shuddered at the feel of the rough barbs catching on delicate flesh, scratching cruelly against those tight little walls which stubbornly squeezed him, attempting to stop his intrusion. </p><p>Draco screamed in pain as he felt that alien shape enter him, pressing ruthlessly forward and tearing him apart in the process.  Desperate, he tried to pull away, but two powerful hands gripped his hips, holding him still as that dull agony became a flash of hot searing pain.  He felt that fragile barrier inside him tear, unable to resist the intruding member.  There was a strange sensation of something sliding into him, a warm slick tickle as his magic shifted, betraying him utterly as it welcomed the enspelled pearl, creating a rush of heat that suffused his new womb.  The pulsing power of the parasitic egg caused a rush of slickness to lubricate his vaginal walls and his muscles quivered invitingly, squeezing the monstrous shaft inside him… Welcoming it</p><p>“Ahhh yes, good boy… so tight… such a perfect little slut.  Look how your body begs for it.”  The Dark Lord moaned as his shaft was bathed in the liquid heat.  Tightening his fingers on those trembling hips, he drew the boy back, pressing himself in even deeper, drinking in the cries and muffled screams. </p><p>Draco didn’t even hear the demeaning words.  All that existed for him was pain as those barbs bit into him, marking every slow inch of progress as the Dark Lord slowly invaded him, splitting him apart on that alien shaft.  He could feel his muscles stretching as they struggled to adjust to the unwelcome girth and the shape which nature had never intended to enter.  Clenching tightly around it only caused the pain to sharpen, but he couldn’t simply relax and allow the violation.</p><p>Squirming and trembling, he tried once more to pull away, but his strength was nothing compared to that of the Dark Lord and the invasion continued relentlessly, endlessly, until Draco was positive he was going to be split in half on the vile thing.</p><p>The pain didn’t begin to fade until the monster debasing him was fully sheathed within his body, the cruel barbs past the point of nerve endings, but held him firmly deep within him.  He could feel that cold leathery skin pressed intimately against him, his slick growing chill on that vile flesh.  Cool spidery fingers stroked his hips almost tenderly and he could feel the Dark Lord chuckle.  The movement seemed to travel through that shaft, vibrating inside him and making him moan in horror at what was happening.  The world was spinning, he was shaking… he was going to be sick… Merlin!!  He could feel the thing inside him!  It pulsed with the Dark Lord’s heartbeat, seeming to swell larger and larger with every passing second stretching him beyond his limits.  He could feel himself bleeding deep inside, tearing.</p><p>Voldeort took a few moments to simply enjoy being so deeply buried in such a perfect quivering form.  He could feel every flutter of muscle, every twitch of that shaking body.  Every time the boy so much as swallowed, it caused a surge of pleasure to travel through him. </p><p>Sliding his hands back, he spread those delightful cheeks wide, looking down at the glistening point of union and felt himself grow even harder.  The other half of his hemipenis rested below its sheathed brother, pressing up against those tight little testicles, pricking them sharply with every breath the boy took, adding to his torment… and the Dark Lord’s enjoyment.</p><p>With slow, measured movements, Voldemort began to rock back and forth, the movements shallow at first, savouring the excruciating tightness around him and the way the silken muscles fluttered around his aching shaft as the barbs caught at the heated flesh of that tight little passage, then reluctantly letting go.  It was exquisite in every sense of the word and he found himself arching his back in pleasure, thrilling in the growing whimpers and sobs coming from the boy beneath him.  The soft sound of flesh against flesh urged him to move faster, to pull out further and drive himself in with more and more force until soon, he was pistoning his hips with abandon, pulling his length nearly free of that silken sheathe, before slamming it in once more, pressing himself in deeply for a few delicious shallow thrusts before repeating the process. With even more enthusiasm.</p><p>Ah, Lucious might be useless in most things, but he did breed well.  Perhaps he should make them create another child for him to enjoy once this one was used up.  The very thought made him impossibly harder and he laughed in delight at the amazing young lad beneath him.  He was truly unique, like no other little pet, possessing such a responsive and sensitive body.   The tight flesh seemed to suck him in, urging him onwards, growing slicker with every thrust until he wasn’t sure if it was the boy screaming, or himself.</p><p>Oh, sweet Salazar, this boy was born to be fucked!  Why, with passion such as this, he was sure to have a new body growing within this delightful little whore soon!  He’d plant his seed deeply and often, keeping this young womb filled to the brim until it had no choice but to supply him with his heir, his glorious future!</p><p>As if the thought alone had flipped a switch inside him, he felt his climax begin to build, the pressure quickly growing to a white-hot intensity which burned through his veins and electrified his very nerves.  Determined to savour this pleasure a little longer, he struggled to hold on for several more brutal thrusts, forging his dominion over this glorious body with a passion which for a few moments, bordered on madness. </p><p>In the end however, there was only one final outcome, one pure sublime purpose, and as much as he wanted to draw this out for the sweetest of eternities, Voldemort was hardly one to allow a bit of pleasure to interfere with his singular and glorious purpose.</p><p>Crying out sharply, he gave one final vicious thrust, burying himself as deeply as he could, feeling his shaft pulse and throb as his seed burst forth, showering the boy’s womb and the pearl buried deep within, with a fountain of chill semen.</p><p>For several long minutes, he knelt there, muscles rigid and quivering, emptying himself in a long and seemingly endless rush until he could feel his cool seed dripping free from that overflowing body, mingling with the boy’s virgin blood.  He felt utterly euphoric and drained… rather disturbingly drained in fact, as if he’d just completed a full week worth of intense spellcraft, requiring all his skill and strength.</p><p>Ah, he saw now.  The spell he’d woven did indeed require energy from the participants, but the one spilling the seed gave far more than the other.  If he indulged too often with this delightful body beneath him, it would easily drain him down to nothing.  He wouldn’t have the power left to cast a simple Lumos, let along have the energy to battle Dumbledore himself.  Pity… but there were other ways around this which would still accomplish his goal.</p><p>Slowly pulling free from the trembling body beneath him, he ignored the agonized scream as the barbs once again viciously pulled at hypersensitive skin.  The boy’s body seemed to cling to him, trying to keep him inside, no doubt recognizing its master.  There was an audible wet pop as the last of his flesh slid out of that bruised and swollen sheath, and in its wake, a rush of semen spilled free.  Semen which should remain coating that precious and greedy little pearl. </p><p>“Severus.”  A wand was wordlessly placed in his palm.  Taken from that little pretty little fool in the graveyard, it would serve his purpose perfectly.  A flash of his will should have been all it took to shape the wand to his purposes, but the Dark Lord found his near limitless reserves to be quite drained.  Still, refusing to show an ounce of weakness, he forced the wand to thicken and shorten, becoming a rather decent sized and flexible shaft, not unlike his own penis.  With a bit of a vicious grin, he added a fork at the end, and dull ridges along its length.  Whispering softly to it, wrapping it even further with his magic, he pressed it against that much abused entrance and slid it in, wrenching another ragged sob from the boy’s throat.</p><p>“You cry, but look how greedily your little cunt sucks it in.  Such a hungry little thing isn’t it?  But don’t worry, this will always remind you of who you belong to.  Not only will it ensure that this delightful little hole is mine alone, but it will ensure that my seed remains inside you, bathing that precious little egg.  You will not be able to remove it, no matter how much you try, it will not exist to any magic but mine, for only my power may remove it.”  Reaching down, he playfully traced his finger along the swollen and raw folds of his newest prize.  “But don’t worry.  I’m not needlessly cruel.  I wouldn’t leave you without some care.”  Picking up his own wand, he tapped the base of the shaft now impaling that delightful vagina and watched the muscles around it twitched as the length buried deep within began to writhe.</p><p>The boy’s whimpers took on new intensity as he squirmed against his bonds, trying to pull away from the new stimulation.</p><p>“You will require a great deal of sexual energy to give life to this egg within you.”  He instructed as he picked up the bowl, now filled to the brim with potion mingled with virgin blood and his own spilled semen.  Dipping the tip of his wand into the mixture, he stirred it six times clockwise, then six times counter.  “Any one man would be drained to death, indeed, any ten men likely would as well.  So you will require many lovers young Malfoy.  Many men will need to plant their seed deep within your body, their magic donation becoming absorbed, filling this lovely repository within you, and when it’s ready, it will fill you with that power over and over again until you become fertile, only to be immediately impregnated by my semen filling your womb.”  He truly did cherish the look of horror on the boy’s beautiful face.  It was moment’s like that that he truly lived for.  “But don’t fret my pet.  I will still take you when I wish, to keep the seed buried within you fresh.”</p><p>Chuckling at how perfectly his night was proceeding, he then placed the mixture to the boy’s quivering and bloody lips.</p><p>“Drink my boy.”  There was no need to add a threat, the child was quite beaten, and with soft and broken sobs, he opened his mouth, draining every last drop, his tears mingling with the rose coloured potion.  He had little worry of them altering the effects, he’d accounted for tears after all, if nothing else, they’d likely increase the potency.</p><p>“This will ensure that you do seek out the proper nourishment for my child, young Draco.  I will not have you attempt to do anything heroic, like starve it, or kill yourself.  No, the preservation of this child will become your greatest priority, whether you know it or not.”  Straightening up, he handed the bowl back to Severus and then looked at the assembled Death Eaters.  “You are all welcome to the boy, take him as often as you wish, but ensure that he remains healthy and uninjured.  You have two days to fill him with as much seed as possible before he returns to that little school of his.”</p><p>“My Lord.”  Severus spoke up cautiously even as the other Death Eaters began to eagerly jostle each other to be the first to claim his virgin ass.  “Is it wise to send him to Hogwarts?”</p><p>“Such things are best hidden in plain sight.”  Voldemort smiled, turning as he heard the boy scream raggedly as a victor was found.  He watched as Dolohov buried himself without preamble inside his slender body with a single brutal thrust and immediately began a rather ruthless tempo.  His screams were quickly silenced by Goyle who claimed his mouth, burying his rather generous shaft up to the hilt, causing the trembling boy to gag while the other Death Eaters cheered them on.  “Besides, I rather enjoy the knowledge that the residents of that pathetic school will be aiding in their own downfall.  Poetic don’t you think?  I of course expect you to ensure his well being.”</p><p>“Of course My Lord, though I doubt there will be much there to save after this.”  He glanced down at the writhing bodies and the victim trapped between them, disgust radiating from his every pore.</p><p>“Have no worries.  The boy will be properly obliviated.  All he will be aware of is the desperate need of his body.”  Another vicious smile pulled at his thin lips.  “And Severus… I expect you to take part as well.”</p><p>“My Lord….”</p><p>“That was not a request Severus.”  The smile grew wider and more vicious as the Dark Lord turned and walked towards his throne where he could sit, stroke Nagini and watch the festivities.</p><p>He could almost feel that new body growing already.</p>
