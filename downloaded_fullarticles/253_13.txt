    <p class="western">'<em>Note to self</em>,' Harry thought painfully, 'N<em>ever help Dennis and Terry with their Magi'tech experiments again. I don't care how much Dennis wants to introduce wizards to Playstation or X-box. That</em> Hurt.' It felt like all of his bones had been yanked out through his nostrils and someone drilled a hole at the back of his skull to slurp his brain out like a coconut.</p><p class="western">Which meant he was less than appreciative when the wall began to hammer like someone slapping against a shed door above his head. “Up!” a shrill female voice commanded, continuing to slap the shed door – shed door? The fuck? Where was he? If he had been <em>dumped</em> in someone's <em>shed</em> he was going to be having some damn words with Dennis and</p><p class="western">He stared blearily at the crayon drawing in front of him.</p><p class="western">Less than twelve inches from his face. A crayon drawing he hadn't seen since he was eleven. Because he'd forgotten to get it out of his cupboard when the Dursleys moved him to Dudley's second bedroom, and he had been too reluctant once free of it to risk going back inside just for a drawing. Just for a single crayon scribble of a red headed lady and a black haired man rendered in a child's hand. He twisted his head, taking in the wooden stairs above his head, laced with ancient grey spider webs, the tired plywood shelves with their shoeboxes of clothes and school projects and little knick-knacks he was able to save for himself by hiding them in socks and between projects. His <em>junior school workbooks</em>. His <em>homework planner</em>. That one copy of The Hobbit he had stolen from the school library and hidden by putting his English grammar text cover over it. The ball-point pen and pencil doodles he remembered doing in the back of his history and maths exercise books, torn out and blue-tacked to the shelves, Stormtroopers and Darth Vader staring down at him in their lumpy glory.</p><p class="western">There was a hard lump in the back of his throat as he looked up at the bare lightbulb above his head and then down to his feet where the vents to his <em>cupboard</em> were open, letting early morning light into the tiny space, letting him see his nightmares made manifest in soft grey and brown gloom. Golden motes of dust drifting lazily in the thin golden beams pouring in through the cracks.</p><p class="western">Slowly and carefully so as not to bump his head, he slid down his lumpy camp-bed and sat up. He turned the light on and examined himself, feeling numb and disbelieving because – this had to be a mistake.</p><p class="western">He was <em>twenty</em> last he checked.</p><p class="western">A week and a half before his twenty-first birthday.</p><p class="western">George had been planning the party for months. Ever since he discovered the existence of America's Las Vegas he had been waiting for an excuse, an opportunity to go there. Molly had wanted Ron's last birthday to be at the Burrow, and none of the Weasley brothers would entertain the concept of taking Ginny to Vegas, so it ended up being decided for Harry's twenty-first. A week in the city of sin. The red head had been more excited about it than Harry had.</p><p class="western">And now here he was.</p><p class="western">Staring down at unscarred, pale, eleven year old hands.</p><p class="western">no. <em>Ten year old hands.</em> Because Uncle Vernon had given him Dudley's second bedroom before his birthday, when the first letters to Hogwarts arrived.</p><p class="western">He was ten.</p><p class="western">Ron and Hermione would be ten too.</p><p class="western">Would they – remember as well?</p><p class="western">If they didn't – if they <em>didn't then – he was alone. He – </em>Tears burned in his throat, choking him.</p><p class="western">“Up!” Aunt Petunia commanded, rapping smartly on the cupboard door, “I need you to mind the bacon while I finish dying your uniform!”</p><p class="western">His uniform?</p><p class="western">Oh. Stonewall.</p><p class="western">His letter to Hogwarts was today.</p><p class="western">He had already set the snake loose at the zoo and ended up locked in his cupboard for over a month. He'd missed the end of Year Six for that, by the time he'd gotten out it was already the Summer Holidays. He had never had the chance to say goodbye to anyone he went to school with, which wasn't much of a less but with the knowledge that Dudley wouldn't be able to hurt any of them anymore he remembered being at least a little hopeful that someone would sign his school sweater before he left. Say at least one kind thing to him before they 'grew up'. Dudley mocked him for ages about no one caring enough to write on his sweater.</p><p class="western">He had spent a <em>lot</em> of time with his auror mandated therapist talking about the Dursleys, about his childhood. About child abuse, and forgiveness and survival.</p><p class="western">“Boy!”</p><p class="western">He snatched his shoes from under his campbed and he apparated to the park.</p><p class="western">He didn't shiver in his night clothes as he jammed the oversized worn flat trainers stuffed with newspaper onto his bare feet. Being early summer it was warm enough that he could sleep outside if he needed to. But he would draw attention if anyone saw him – and it made anger simmer in the pit of his stomach. Let them. Let them <em>see</em>. They'd been ignoring him for long enough, ignoring what the Dursleys were doing, <em>let them get a bellyful of what their negligence had wrought</em>.</p><p class="western">He marched down the road, down through the fancy three floor detached townhouses and their off-road drive-ways and multi-panelled elegant windows, past the quiet greasy spoon cafe next to the post office, and the petshop that sat on the corner of the highstreet, and straight to the police station on the opposite side of the road.</p><p class="western">And froze.</p><p class="western">If he went in there, he would open a can of worms that would never be stuffed back inside.</p><p class="western">It would, at best, result in him and Dudley going into care where at least Dumbledore's overly pointed nose would ensure they remained together for the sake of the blood-wards. At worst, he would end up living with Marge Dursley or any one of his <em>magical</em> relatives – Death Eaters almost all, and then <em>Dudley</em> would learn what it was like to be on the receiving end of the kind of treatment his parents had given Harry. Only with the very real fear of being killed and his body dumped or vanished. Torture wouldn't be out of the question either, considering some of them.</p><p class="western">Then there was magic itself. How would a foster carer handle it? Riddle's Orphanage hadn't dealt with it in a particularly shining manner, but then again, they had been in the middle of the Blitz and Riddle had been torturing small children and animals back then in the 30's. A little leeway he could give Wools Orphanage on that front. Child Protection Laws these days would have other things to say, but he knew full damn well the system was over-taxed and under-supported. Adoption was rare for children their age, and Dudley's many issues would make it impossible for them to be adopted if they went as a pair, which they would. The blond would be a high-risk/high-difficulty case, there would be very few that could handle him. Then there was Hogwarts. Any decent human being would be incredibly concerned with everything that happened at Hogwarts, everything that happened to <em>Harry</em> in regards to his adventures in Hogwarts. The Dursleys, despite everything, had given him a level of freedom that no sane or reasonable parent or guardian would or should give their child/ward. Which at the time was distressing because he literally was a child, but right now, given that he was actually twenty, a war-veteran, and a trained auror, was significantly less of a concern.</p><p class="western">...He could always run away entirely?</p><p class="western">Except no. Dumbledore would send search parties by the thousands. And then there was the <em>highly</em> illegal deluminator that spied on him using his <em>blood</em> (which when talking about with his therapist caused quite a bit of property damage when he realised the old man was <em>fully aware of exactly how the Dursleys treated him because he had been spying on him the whole time</em>).</p><p class="western">The Gryffindor turned away from the police department and stalked back up the road towards the park, arms folded, rubbing his chin thoughtfully, missing the slight scratch of stubble that had <em>finally</em> been starting to grow in (delayed puberty was a <em>whore</em>, thanks Petunia for the malnutrition).</p><p class="western">He would just have to deal with the Dursleys.</p><p class="western">Negotiate for better standards of living. The wards should be as charged as they could physically be, meaning that Harry need only spend two weeks a year in that house – he could live elsewhere in the meanwhile. Yeah. That would work out quite nicely. It had been so long that Dumbledore was unlikely to be paying him so much attention anymore, confident in whatever assessment he had made of Harry's personality and abilities from spying on him. As long as the wards remained as they were, he would be none the wiser of Harry's not actually <em>being</em> at the Dursleys.</p><p class="western">A quick trip to Diagon Alley, an hour with a potions' kit, and he would have an auror grade temporary Aging Potion that would stand up to any scrutiny and enable him to rent an apartment in the Alleys and other residential areas of either Hogsmeade or London. Maybe abroad? Somewhere sunny and warm – nah. Hogsmeade would be better, thinking about it, he could sneak into the forest or the moors to practice more destructive magics, and the floos would be closer, and he could sneak in and out of Hogwarts at his discretion. Free unrestricted access to the Library, he thought with a grin, Hermione would –</p><p class="western">Do nothing. Because she was an eleven year old girl right now.</p><p class="western">And until he received confirmation one way or the other that was how he would treat her until she proved otherwise. It – it wouldn't be fair to treat her like the woman she would grow into at this point, to expect that much from her, to want her support when she hadn't even learned to stand on her <em>own</em> legs just yet.</p><p class="western">But first, <em>Plan</em>.</p><p class="western">Step one, go back to Number 4. He would read the Dursleys' the Riot Act – or rather, the Child Protection Act and all associated legislature, and present them with their ultimatum deal: Two weeks of the year they would put him up in the Guest Bedroom. He would make it easier on them by keeping himself to himself, eat his own food, clean up after himself, etc etc. All they had to do was keep a roof over his head, not interfere with his comings and goings, <em>and stop lying to the neighbours about him</em>. Gods, it had caused him no end of trouble when his name started popping up in muggle media as he busted cases wide open and worked with high up Government official, muggle reporters had flooded Little Whinging looknig for juicy gossip and walked away with the conclusion he must have falsified evidence. He'd almost <em>lost</em> a case because of those childhood rumours about St Brutus'. In exchange for that, Harry wouldn't report them to the police and he would be gone for ninety percent of the year.</p><p class="western">All the Dursleys' had to do was be decent human beings. A tall order he knew, very difficult, but he had faith that with the right motivation they could be appropriately trained.</p><p class="western">He apparated back to the house, just in time to catch the postman as he headed up towards the front door.</p><p class="western">“Morning. I'll take those,” he called as he made his way up behind the man.</p><p class="western">“Corr, you're out early!” the man exclaimed, handing over the small wadge of letters and postcards.</p><p class="western">Harry wrinkled his nose as he took them, “Aunt Petunia sent me out for eggs. Cornershop didn't have any though,” he complained unhappily as he flipped through to find <em>his</em> letter and grinned, not particularly having to pretend excitement when he saw it.</p><p class="western">“Have a good day, lad,” the postman said as he headed towards Number 6.</p><p class="western">“You too, sir,” the Gryffindor returned as he tucked the letters under his arm and examined his own – only to freeze and stare at the black calligraphy glaring up at him. <em>Black</em> calligraphy. <em>Not</em> emerald green.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western" align="CENTER">

</p><p class="western" align="CENTER"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He looked around over his shoulder in confusion. Was this – was this a prank? A bit elaborate for a prank wasn't it? Something like this, especially putting Harry back in the cupboard, George would have never. He knew better. Was he <em>hallucinating or something?</em></p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Timetravel he could buy, but his Hogwarts letter looking like the start menu of one of Dennis' RPG games was a bit...</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Oh what the hell. If he was in a coma and hallucinating this then at least he had some entertainment.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He tapped Options, curious about what it would offer him, and felt the envelope grow warm. The ink on the front vanished, sinking back into the parchment and reappeared as an ornate calligraphic arrow pointing towards the back of the envelope. He flipped it open and saw a second arrow pointing to the wax seal. He cracked it open and pulled out what should have been his Hogwarts letter, but was in fact two completely different sheets of parchment.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">

And <em>it could get worse?!!</em> He tapped Easy and was gratified to see the words change colour, becoming bright emerald green as 'hard' faded once more into grey and lost its uppercase font. With his mouth dry, he then began to check the rest of the available options and what they did.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT"><b>AUTOSAVE:</b> In the event of your death, return to the last place you slept before hand.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">

If Hermione and Ron had come back with him by some fluke or stroke of good fortune given the many life debts and magical bonds between the three of them, if <em>Dennis or Terry</em> had come back, which was also a possibility because they were the reason that <em>Harry</em> was here, he had every intention of dragging them into the insanity of their own creation. He was NOT doing this on his own again! His therapist was absolutely 100% clear on that! He did not have to do everything himself and nor should he! It was detrimental to his mental health to try and shoulder all of that on his own – that was why his personal relationships had suffered so hard and how he and Ginny had broken up so badly.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT"><b>HINTS MENU:</b> A quick tap of a copper framed portrait and they will remind you of outstanding quests and tasks as well as provide the occasional piece of insight – such as a suggestion to look at a certain book or try a particular teacher.

Sure it might be a hallucination, <em>but what if it wasn't</em>. He would deal with it later when it was safe. First, the Dursleys. He would pack his belongings, go to Diagon Alley, get himself an apartment in Hogsmea- no, he would come <em>back</em> to the Dursleys' with everything he needed for Hogwarts and making his Aging Potion, actually brew it, then go back to Diagon or Hogsmeade to get his apartment.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He would bust out the meditation and processing techniques his therapist recommended when he got there, when he could ward it and make it safe, when he had a <em>wand</em> – any wand, to protect himself with. He physically could not meditate or work on his occlumency without being in a completely safe environment. Yet another reason why his lessons with Snape had failed so abysmally. He did not feel safe with that man, and he never would and – oh hell. Harry was going to have to construct entirely new shields to throw off the fact he even <em>had</em> shields! Because Snape would check. Dumbledore would check. They would both <em>obsessively</em> scan his brain and his emotions to make sure he wasn't Voldemort 2.0.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Getting that apartment now became priority number one.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He checked the second sheet of parchment and paused when he realised this one was longer and had a lot more options.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">

</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">This was... <em>something</em>. He frowned and shifted the parchments in his hand – the one at the bottom was now a shiny silver mirror. But when he put it on top of the hair and bloodline talents page, the silver bled away back into what it was before, showing the Difficulty levels and other options. He flipped them back over and eyed the bloodline talents section, absently guessing that the mirror parchment was for the section below the bloodlines so he could see how he looked.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">All of the talents were selected. Even Necromancy and Creature Ancestry, and there didn't seem to be an option to turn any of them off like on the other page. He tapped Necromancy hopefully, the emerald green ink rippling and providing an explanation below.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT"><b>NECROMANCY:</b> A talent born of the Potter line's forebares the Peverells', children of Death themselves. Necromancy comes as easily as breathing to you. Both your prior experiences with death and your ancestral connections to it have given you the kind of connection that Masters would weep, and kill a great many people, to possess. The dead will answer to your command, your summons, and never turn a hand against you – even if you were not the one to summon them. You are a being of death and it will follow your footsteps and protect you where-ever you may go.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He grimaced and tapped it again, hoping to deselect or turn it off but it refused. He tapped Creature Ancestry in mild defeat – he could just ignore that talent, never use it, if he didn't, no one need ever know it existed.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT"><b>CREATURE ANCESTRY: </b>One of your relatives was a magical being of great power, please elect one of the following-<b><br/>Veela<br/>Faerie (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn, Wilde)<br/>Selkie<br/>Elf</b></p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He grimaced again, shaking his head, and tried to tap another subject only for the text to flash a dull grey and remain unchanged. Ugh. Apparently he <em>had</em> to select what his inhuman relative had been. He knew Veela had an awful lot of difficulty with sex appeal and he would rather not deal with that. HE HAD ENCOUNTERED ENOUGH FAE AS AN AUROR TO LEAVE THAT OPTION WELL ENOUGH ALONE, NO THANK YOU. Selkies, that was merfolk, not too bad considering the other options. And by Elf, what did they mean? House elf? That was the only kind he knew and no offence to Dobby or Kreacher or Winky, but Harry wanted to try and hit 5'5” minimum this go over.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He selected Selkie. Having merfolk blood wouldn't be that bad, would it?</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT"><b>CREATURE ANCESTRY, SELKIE:</b> One of your relatives was a True Selkie, the magical traits have been buried under increeding and have finally popped back up with the infection of fresh blood your mother provided to degrading genetics. You will develop a fine seal fur coat at your majority and seek out extensive bodies of water. You will possess both your Selkie form and an animagus form should you choose to pursue one. To turn into a seal you must don your fur coat, to become human, simply remove it. But be warned, should anyone steal your coat, you will be magically bound to them until you find it again, forced to live as a human and do their bidding. Any damage to your coat is damage to you. As part of the magicks binding you to whomever has possession of your coat, you will be able to provide children regardless of yours or your partners' gender. Once you regain your coat, no matter what you leave behind, be it children or possessions, you must return to the ocean or a lake or a large body of water and <em>never</em> approach them ever again.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Horror turned his stomach and he immediately flipped to the first Options page and dialled the difficulty to Normal, and away from Easy – if he couldn't deselect any of those options then he could bloody well make sure it wasn't available to BE selected!!</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He checked back and <em>thank fuck</em> found that all of the bloodline talents were now grey and unselected, except for Parselmouth which he knew came from the Horcrux and was not possible to remove just yet.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT"><b>BLOODLINE TALENTS</b> – <em>please select only three</em></p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Okay, okay, phew. He could manage this. No Necromancy, no Creature Ancestry. No – no <em>magical animagus form</em>. God the fits that would be thrown in the Transfiguration community if anyone found out. No, no thank you, he did not wish to be a subject of intense study, did not want to vanish into the Department of Mysteries, thank you, no.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Metamorph would be the most useful, he tapped it and read the quick bo that explained he was a complete shapeshifter but would require effort and practice at it, and it would level up like any other skill the more he practiced and used it. Sweet. He would be using it <em>extensively</em> – perhaps he wouldn't even need to use those Aging Potions?</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Flight had him curious, he read that he could either levitate and fly like Superman judging by the description, or he could sprout <em>winds</em> and fly like that character in the X-men, Warren Worthington, the Angel.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Birdtongue, similar to Parselmouth but purely the ability to communicate with birds. Interesting, but that was all it was. He was going to go with a no. As interesting as it would be to actually <em>speak</em> to Fawkes and the other birds, he didn't know if the ability was looked at in much the same way as Parselmouth or not. In the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, some birds were servants of Sauron. He didn't want to run the risk of <em>two</em> evil animal speaking abilities doing him in.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Shadowmancy was – wielding shadows like an actual physical object, without the need for a wand. Walking through them to <em>teleport</em>, wrapping himself up in them to hide, storing items in patches of shadow and then pulling them out again later in other locations, which, not going to lie, sounded useful as fuck.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Firemancy was much the same, wielding fire without the need for a wand but it also allowed for the purification of curses, possession, disease, and even the warding away of evil spirits. Something they could all do with in the coming days. It was, according to the bio, his mother's protection made manifest.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Natural Legilimency was what it said on the tin. He could read other people's mind with far more subtly and care than Snape had ever read his, sometimes even delve <em>into</em> their minds and walk amongst a metaphysical mindscape and interact with it. Rearrange it. Destroy it.... How about <em>no?</em> Not for him.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Empthy? Again, a massive no. Being an empath around so many goddamn <em>teenagers?</em> In a <em>War?</em> Did he look like he wanted jam for a brain?</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Precognition sounded interesting from the summary, about to see events split-seconds before they happened, getting a kind of empathic sense of good or bad or dangerous events happening near-by. That could be <em>incredibly</em> useful. It also sounded a little bit like those 'Bad Feelings' that Han Solo kept having in Star Wars, which made it <em>very</em> tempting to take.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Natural Animagus form meant that he would be able to easily shift between himself and his animagus form upon his first Transfiguration lesson where they cover the subject, it would also allow for partial transformations as well. He was <em>incredibly</em> tempted but – at the same time – the Marauders had <em>earned</em> their forms, and their names, part of him wanted to follow in their footsteps and earn his form. It hadn't been worth it last time because there had been no Marauder's left to name him, it would have felt <em>hollow</em>. And it would have done nothing but remind him of his losses. His therapist had been working with him on that before this incredible clusterfuck.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Magical Animagus and Creature Ancestry were <em>well</em> out. He wanted no part of that madness. (He wanted kids but – being able to bare children regardless of the gender of the person that <em>forcibly bound themselves to him</em>? How did that work? Was he the one going to be pregnant, would he lay an <em>egg?</em> It wasn't like he had a vagina.)</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Considering it carefully, he selected Shadowmancy, because of the teleporting and item storage abilities it offered. And then precognition – that would be <em>so damn useful.</em></p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Now came the fun part, he guessed. Choosing how he looked.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He tapped the hair options and gagged as soon as he saw himself with white blond hair – no, no. Just no. He looked like one of Malfoy's relatives, and not even a particularly attractive one. Regular yellow-blond didn't look too bad with his skin and eye colour. Brown was... brown. It softened his face and made him look like a normal person, he was almost unrecognisable.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Red hair. Red hair was....</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">With a slightly shaking hand, he tapped brown eyes and stared down at the mirror parchment, at the face he could have worn had circumstances been a little different, if he had been born with his mother's hair and his father's eyes.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He took a deep breath and returned his hair to the familiar, comfortable black. And damn. That was a trip. He – he really did look like his father. Except he knew that he would grow out of it, that his mother's blood would win out eventually. He flicked his eyes back to green, too attached to that last piece of her.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He tried out various lengths and eventually settled on shaggy for now, purely because he didn't have the face for the long hair he <em>used</em> to have being as young as he was. He toggled his need for glasses off and was very pleased to remove them.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Then he tapped to move his scar.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">
  <em>Drag and drop your scar where you would like it to be.</em>
</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He grabbed his scar and pulled it down his face, watching in the mirror as it followed as if stuck to his fingertip. He dragged it down to his stomach where it was unlikely to be seen by anyone except his dorm-mates, and it would be socially unacceptable to ask to see it. But then again, if it was going to <em>hurt</em> like it used to.... perhaps he should put it on a limb he could ignore....</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Stomach was probably a bad idea, chest was <em>definitely</em> a bad idea – he might give himself a heart attack or have trouble breathing if the pain got paralysingly bad. Likewise he vetoed anywhere on his legs, he would need them to <em>run</em>, and hobbling from the likes of Voldemort did not make for successful escapes. No matter what the Triwizard Tournament may have had his younger self believe. His left arm was probably his best bet.... His elbow maybe? Ah, no, there was a nerve directly in there. The number of times he'd smacked it and his whole arm went weird was too numerous to recall, he didn't particularly want a curse scar right there.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">His hand. His left hand. He could ignore an awful lot of pain as long as it was localised in an area he didn't desperately need. And since his right hand would be wand wielding, it was probably for the best. And besides, he didn't want Voldemort to know that the scar caused him pain this do over, that was his early warning system and an advantage he was loathe to give up. Best to let everyone believe that any pain in his hand was because he was clumsy and had burnt himself or sprained his wrist or something.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He dragged the scar down to rest on the palm of his left hand.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">It looked like a brand, like he had grabbed hold of a hot doorknob or something and it had burnt itself into his flesh.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Well.... At least now he had the option of just straight up amputation to deal with getting rid of the Horcrux.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Satisfied with his appearance, as he could always let his hair grow out later if he wanted, he folded the parchments over again to return them to the envelope only to pause when he saw letters bleed through the parchment facing him.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT"> </p><p class="western" align="LEFT"><em>For your own protection while growing up in a muggle neighbourhood, your Metamorph abilities were sealed by Headmaster Dumbledore.

He tucked the papers back into the envelope and flipped it over to find the save title and list of options as before.
