    <p>It's been an embarrassingly long time since I've posted anything, and I'd really like to change that.  Hopefully I'll be updating some of my WIPs soonish - I'm horrendously stuck, but I'm hoping the Han Solo movie will unstick the Soloverse (either because I like it and want to use its canon to inform the next few fics, or because spite).  In the meantime, my brain keeps throwing ideas at me that don't go anywhere much, so I thought I'd throw some of them at AO3 instead.  This chapter is going to serve as an index/blurb-collector, which will hopefully soon have more than a few entries on it.</p><p>Chapter 1: <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/13956351/chapters/32127630" rel="nofollow">Sailing</a> - When Obi-Wan Kenobi brings Luke to Tatooine, Beru knows there's more to the story than he's telling them.</p><p>Chapter 2: <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/13956351/chapters/32127996" rel="nofollow">Ambition and Cunning</a> - Hermione Granger gets a chance to do her first year at Hogwarts over.  The decisions she makes are... significantly different to the first time around.</p>
