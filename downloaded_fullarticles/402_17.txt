  <em>Harry</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>As he laid in darkness in the broom cupboard under the stairs, the small boy pulled his knees closer to his chest, trying to forget about his hunger. Eyes closed, he flinched when he heard his name in the silence surrounding him.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>He bolted up from his bed suddenly and looked around curiously. The boy didn’t think his aunt and uncle would be hungry enough to wake him up in the dead of night. He was supposed to prepare breakfast at five am, and the old, broken clock indicated that it was only three am now.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>He heard the voice yet another time. But unlike what he originally thought, the voice was coming from inside the cupboard, not from outside. As if someone was whispering in his ear… like someone was speaking in his mind…</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry… I’m here… Harry</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>The little boy cupped his ears with his hands, eyes widening in surprise. The voice was coming from inside his head. Just like that bee that hid in the hero’s ear in one of those cartoons Dudley watched… the deep voice of a man was speaking in his mind… He wondered for a moment if he was dreaming.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry… I’m here… In your mind…</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>The little boy, Harry, lowered his hands to his lap and asked tentatively.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing inside my head, sir?”</p><p> </p><p>A voice that definitely belonged to a grown-up man was stuck in his head. At this point Harry had begun wondering whether he should pluck something in his ear an pull the man out. The poor guy was stuck in his mind.</p><p> </p><p>The man spoke again, a laughter hidden in his tone.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I’m afraid you can’t pluck me out of your ear, little one. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Harry was surprised to get an answer to his unasked question. Then he laughed at his own stupidity. Being in his head, of course the man could read his mind.</p><p> </p><p>“How can I help you, sir, I’m sure you would love to get out of there.” Harry said in his tiny voice. It must be really boring to get stuck in the mind of a six year old.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>It is so kind of you to want to help, little one. But there is no way to make me get away from you. Is it that bad, me being with you?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Harry thought how nice it would be to never be alone again. At least he would have someone to talk to. He could tell him stories. That sounded nice…</p><p> </p><p>“No, sir, you can stay with me as long as you want. I would… love that.”</p><p> </p><p>His aunt and uncle never talked to him, aside from the constant yelling. His cousin would hit him whenever he got the chance. Little Harry couldn’t remember one moment his family showed him love or affection. Thanks to Dudley, he also had no friends.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry, would you like me to become your friend? You would never have to be alone again.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>The little boy felt his heart filling with joy. For the first time, he had a friend. Maybe they wouldn’t be able to go to the park, play games together, but now he has a friend Dudley could never take away from him.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>No one can take me away from you, little one.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Harry smiled cheerfully. Then he remembered he never asked for his friend’s name. That wasn’t good manners. He asked quickly before he upset his first friend.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you tell me your name, sir? I’m sorry for not asking before.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>It’s alright, little one. My name is Marvolo.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Harry marveled at how special this name was. His own name was so simple. Harry. Just like him… marvolo… He didn’t remember hearing such a name before.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Marvolo.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>The pleasure is mine, Harry. Of course, I knew you from long before…</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>The young boy was confused.  He didn’t think he had met with his new friend before. How was Marvolo stuck in his head, anyway?</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I was always here, Harry. I was always with you.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Although he was glad his friend was always with him, Harry couldn’t help but feel heart broken. Why had Marvolo never spoken before?</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Because I wasn’t strong enough to talk to you, Harry. I only gathered enough strength to reach you as you got older.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hearing Marvolo’s explanation, Harry was flustered. He had forgotten that Marvolo could hear his thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, Marvolo.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>It’s alright, little one.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>His stomach grumbling more because of hunger, Harry hugged himself with his arms tighter and pulled his knees closer to his chest. Uncle Vernon, completely forgetting that he had not eaten anything, had locked the door, warning him about not wandering in the house. The little boy wished that his uncle didn’t forget about him. If the door wasn’t locked, he could go get something to eat but…</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry… would you like me to help you?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Harry smiled at his friend’s offer. But he doubted Marvolo could do anything about that. He couldn’t possibly go get him food while stuck in his head, could he?</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you Marvolo. It’s alright. I can get a thing or two while preparing breakfast.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I can help you little one. I only have one condition. If you accept it, I can show you a way to get out of this cupboard.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Harry’s heartbeat got faster with excitement. Marvolo could help him! He didn’t know how, but he felt like he could trust his friend.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course I’d accept, Marvolo. Just name it!”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I’m going to give you a very special secret, Harry. It will stay between the two of us only. You should not tell your aunt or uncle. Do you understand?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>A secret for only Marvolo and him… that was great! He never kept a secret before. He smiled in excitement.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, sir. I will keep our secret!”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Do you believe in magic, Harry?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Harry flinched in worry, uncertain.</p><p> </p><p>“There is no such thing as magic, Marvolo. Uncle Vernon forbade me to talk about it.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Do you trust me or your uncle more, Harry?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>The boy didn’t need to think thoroughly. He knew uncle Vernon was family and he had just met Marvolo, but… Marvolo was his first friend ever. The very first person who ever bothered to talk to him. Afraid of being heard, he whispered.</p><p> </p><p>“I trust you, Marvolo. I think… m-magic… Really exists.”</p><p> </p><p>As soon as he said that, he pressed his hands over his mouth and stared into the darkness. He was afraid that his aunt or uncle would wake up and catch him talking about that forbidden topic.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>What makes you believe in the existence of magic, little one?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Harry pushed his unruly hair out of his eyes, lost in thought. He remembered how he had suddenly found himself on the school’s roof one time, trying to run away from the “Harry Hunting” game Dudley and his friends had made up. And the other day he had seen his teacher’s hair turning blue. Everyone had blamed him. And that one time—</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I see, Harry… a lot of unexplained things happened around you, is that right?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Harry nodded with a curious expression. What he had went through had no other explanation but magic. Just like in the movies…</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>You are a wizard, Harry Potter…</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Harry wanted to deny it. He wanted to tell him he was wrong. But deep down inside… he knew that was true. From the weird current winding through his body to the chill that went through his very bones… he could understand that he had magic. Out of fear that he might be wrong about it, he felt the need to ask. He was afraid that he would have fake hope.</p><p> </p><p>“Can I really… do magic?”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Yes, little one… a special power, one which is not granted to many others, wander through your veins… you are special, Harry…</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>The little boy wanted fiercely to believe Marvolo in that moment. But he couldn’t see anything special about himself. He couldn’t forget about how the Dursleys kept calling him “Freak!”….</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>You are special, Harry… Unlike your worthless relatives… They are the freaks… They cannot fathom the power within you…</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>His heartbeat almost resounded from the cold walls of the small cupboard. He was looking at his hands in wonder. As if he could see magic swirling through his fingers if he looked close enough… I am a wizard, he whispered to himself.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Yes, my little one… You are a wizard… Magic and power are in your very hands…</em>
</p><p> </p><p>He raised his gaze from his hands and asked in curiosity.</p><p> </p><p>“How can I do magic, Marvolo?”</p><p> </p><p>With the deep voice of his friend, Harry started dreaming.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I want you to close your eyes tight… Harry… Do not think anything other than my words… Focus… Rub your hands together… Yes… Your hands are warm… I want you to imagine a the flame of a candle in your right palm… A small ball of flame… Your hand gets warmer and warmer… Don’t worry… It’s not going to burn you… Yes… Open your eyes!</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>As if waking up from a dream, the little boy opened his eyes slowly and gaped at the burning flame in his palm. It was illuminating the darkness. It had no contact with his skin. The light of the flame hit the walls, illuminating the cupboard. Harry thought of how he never saw a more wondrous thing in his life. As he twirled his fingers, the flames danced a little over his skin.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh! Marvolo! Awesome! This… This is… Wonderful! This is magic!”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>The magic is within your very blood… Protected inside yourself… You can do anything… Harry… Anything you can imagine…</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Harry couldn’t help but bounce up and down. He didn’t even notice he didn’t care the bed was groaning. Magic… What a wonderful feeling…</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Imagine the flames fo out… Rub your hands together… Imagine there was nothing… We wouldn’t want to burn the whole house down, little one… Not yet…</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Harry carefully obeyed Marvolo’s instructions. His emerald eyes watched as the flame went out. He gazed at his empty hands, as if thinking that he could wake up any time and realize that the whole night was a dream. Marvolo’s words brought him out of his trance.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>You see, you can do magic whenever you want… Now let’s… get you out of this damned cupboard, what about that?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Harry giggled when he heard the word “damned”. The word that the grown-ups use when they got angry sounded funny to the child. He nodded slowly, giving his whole attention to Marvolo. If he could get out of the cupboard, then he could also go eat something.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Hold your hand to the door… Focus… Now… you want the door to open… Repeat after me… Alohamora!</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Repeating the magical word, the click he heard from the door made Harry smile widely. He had done it! Great! Being careful to not make a sound, he took small steps out of the cupboard. His bare feet absorbing the cold, Dudley’s over-sized t-shirt dangling from his ankles... Adjusting his broken glasses, he made his way to the fridge. In the silent house the only sounds that could be heard were the tic tocs of the clock and uncle Vernon’s snoring coming from upstairs. He buttered two slices of bread and put jam on them. Keeping an eye on the stairs, he ate quickly. After so many hours of hunger, his stomach feasted on the delicious meal. Listening to Marvolo’s advice, he took some fruit and went back to his cupboard. The cold cupboard would prevent the fruits to get bad. He closed the door gently and whispered the magic words to lock it back. Giggling at how marvelous magic was, he wrapped the fruits in an old t-shirt and hid them beside the bed. With his aunt not bothering to check the cupboard so as not to get dirty, he wasn’t worrying about the fruits being found.</p><p> </p><p>Placing his glasses to a corner, he laid down and closed his eyes. Cuddling to a faded colored teddy bear which had stuffing coming out everywhere, he whispered.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, thank you very much, Marvolo. It’s so nice to have you here. Good night.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Good night… Harry…</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>--</p><p> </p><p>When the seventh piece of Lord Voldemort’s soul, severed unknowingly from him, regained consciousness and found itself not able to move or talk, he wasn’t exactly surprised. The main body, the main piece of the soul, or just Tom, seemed to have successfully completed the horcrux ritual. Aside from the fact that he wasn’t exactly pleasant to find himself not able to move, it was satisfying to know that he had completed the last step in his quest for immortality. That was, until he heard the cry of a baby…</p><p> </p><p>According to the plan, no worthless creature was supposed to be anywhere near the horcrux. Didn’t Tom place him yet? Suddenly, he felt himself getting hungry. He was confused. There was a disturbing wetness beneath his body. Where were his mom and dad?</p><p> </p><p>Mom and dad? What nonsense was that?!</p><p> </p><p>As the crying increased, the sense of uneasiness also did. Even when he wasn’t able to move or talk, Tom felt that his body was held and lifted in the air.</p><p> </p><p>Wait! Wait just a second – this body doesn’t belong to me!</p><p> </p><p>As he managed to distance his mind from the baby, things take a different turn.</p><p> </p><p>As light started to spread through the darkness and he found himself staring at the dumb half- giant Hagrid, his whole world turned over in shock. As he listened to the crying parasite calling him “Harry”, all pieces started to fall to their rightful place.</p><p> </p><p>The Horcrux was somehow placed into the goddamned baby, the one creature that, according to the prophecy, had the power to destroy him. The fact that he had never seen such a miraculous magic in all his life delving deep into the Dark Arts was not enough to distract him enough to cheer him up. Only one thing was certain; Harry Potter wasn’t dead and he was carrying one of the keys of Lord Voldemort’s immortality inside him.</p><p> </p><p>As far as he understood from the damned old geezer Dumbledore’s and Mcgonagall’s talk, the world of magic was celebrating the death of the most evil dark lord of history. Nonsense! It was not possible that his grand existence could be destroyed by a simple baby.</p><p> </p><p>As for Harry Potter… apparently, the baby on which the killing curse did not work was not ordinary. The Horcrux made his decision. It was for the best to try and solve the mystery of this baby while being hidden inside the enemy’s body.</p><p> </p><p>Days turned to months, months turned to years. No one came to check on the pitiful hero raised by the worthless muggles. Dursleys, who he could not even consider human, were the worst of the muggles. Lord Voldemort’ssould couldn’t help but pity his enemy, living a pitiful life. This pity, this feeling that he couldn’t admit even to himself, made the horcrux take action.</p><p> </p><p>He didn’t have the power to control or command this body he had hid into. But after a while, as the child’s magic power improved, he felt his consciousness increasing. With the help of the door he opened in his mind, he decided to help the child after a very long while.</p><p> </p><p>He knew only too well how a friendless, loveless boy would view the world. He could only remember too well the nights he spent, hungry and deprived of sleep, the bullies in that hell of an orphanage. He had one too many experiences on being abused and being ignored.</p><p> </p><p>He started speaking, persuading himself that the main purpose was to make the enemy believe. Imagining the expression on Dumbledore’s face if he gains the trust of Harry Potter and brings him over to the dark side, he invited his enemy to the world of magic.</p><p> </p><p>He repeated to himself that he had no good intentions. Only manipulation! Nothing else!</p><p> </p><p>He told himself that Lord Voldemort had no mercy. He repeated again and again that he feasted upon the fear of those he crushed under him.</p><p> </p><p>Fooled himself.</p><p> </p><p>So the six year old orphan, Harry Potter, began befriending the imaginary Marvolo, stuck in his mind.</p><p> </p><p>The fate of the world of magic changed in that dark night.</p>
