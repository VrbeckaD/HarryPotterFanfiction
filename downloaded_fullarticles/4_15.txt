    <p>I suppose that by the winter of third year I should’ve been used to the succession in which Hogsmeade weekends usually went. It would start a few days before, with me mentioning to Percy that there was a Hogsmeade trip. Then, he would tell me he’d go with me but that he wanted to get some homework done beforehand. The day of the trip, we’d spend most of the morning in the library or the common room, with me complaining and him ignoring me until he’d finally set down his quill around noon and finally, finally, pack up to go to Hogsmeade. It had become such a repeated pattern that I’d taken to making a checklist and checking off each event as it happened. The first year twins seemed to find it funny, but Percy never did. </p>
<p>On that Saturday in early winter we were sitting in the common room. Percy was working on an essay, the parchment for which I’d noted had already exceeded it’s three foot requirement. I looked at the side of his face, sighing and checking off step three on my list. </p>
<p>“Passive aggressively making a checklist counts as complaining.” Percy looked at me and fiddled with his glasses for a second. “Don’t you have homework to finish?” </p>
<p>“I finished it,” I eyed his parchment again, “and judging by your amount of parchment, you did too.” </p>
<p>“It’s not my fault. If I want to become a prefect by fifth year I need to show my ability to go above and beyond.” </p>
<p>“Perce, I assure you, they do not care that much. If anything,” I checked the title of his essay, “I’m sure even Professor Sprout has better things to do with her time than read your essay.” </p>
<p>“Why do you still bother?” The twins had snuck up behind us, popping up like evil redhead jack in the boxes. </p>
<p>“I ask myself the same thing every day.” </p>
<p>“You should come with us instead.” George smirked. </p>
<p>Percy looked as though he was going to complain, but Fred cut in before he could. “Don’t worry, we’ll have your girlfriend back by the time you’re done.” </p>
<p>“Which gives us… about three hours, wouldn’t you say Forge?” </p>
<p>“He’s not my-”  Before I could finish, Percy had sighed and stood up, yanking the parchment I’d been fiddling with out of my hands. He checked off the rest of the steps, shoved his books back into his bag and grabbed my arm, dragging me towards the portrait hole.</p>
<p>“I’m ready to go,” he said simply, glaring at the twins who were snickering behind him. </p>
<p>“That’s no way to treat your girlfriend.” George called. </p>
<p>“Sorry, future girlfriend,” Fred revised, after I gave the two of them a disapproving look. The twins winked conspiratorially at me, and I wondered if the stunt they’d pulled had been intentional, as a way to get Percy to leave earlier, or just to make him mad. Whatever the case, I made a mental note to get them some candy from Honeydukes for their help. </p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>“Perce, I’m cold.” I took the jar of fire from him. </p>
<p>“You’re the one who wanted to come in the first place. Shouldn’t you be prepared?” He grabbed the fire back, but stood closer nonetheless. “Honestly I don’t get why you like coming here so much.” </p>
<p>I shivered, hoping it went unnoticed, but it apparently had not as the Weasley boy promptly sighed, and wrapped his scarf around my neck. I felt a blush rise to my face, but attempted to hide it in his scarf. “Let’s go into Honeydukes,” I pointed to the storefront, grabbing Percy’s arm and dragging him towards the store before he could protest. “Don’t worry, we’ll go to the bookshop afterwards.” </p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>In mid January however, our routine was thrown off. We were sitting in the library, completing an essay for Snape, when Percy looked up. He sat for a few seconds, staring at me without saying anything, but then cleared his throat and spoke, albeit stiffly. “There’s a trip this weekend. To Hogsmeade. If,” I was offended that he looked like he was in pain. </p>
<p>“Yes.” I turned back to my essay, not before seeing the redhead’s relieved expression. I thought I saw a slight blush on his face, but when I looked back I didn’t see anything. </p>
<p>The day of the trip Percy joined me in the Great Hall for breakfast. I expected to see him doing homework, but he wasn’t. “If you’re ready we can leave right after breakfast.” </p>
<p>“Ok.” In actuality, I did have some homework to finish, figuring that I would have had time to do so before the trip, but I wasn’t going to complain, seeing as he was voluntarily willing to go. I wondered briefly what had changed his mind, but decided not to ask, lest it offend him. </p>
<p>When we finished breakfast we returned to the common room. I saw Fred and George raise an eyebrow when we split ways, Percy going to his dorm and me to mine. They looked between us, and decided to shoot up the stairs behind Percy. I continued up the stairs to the girl’s dorms. </p>
<p>“You look happy,” My dormmate Macie noted. “You finally going on a date with that Weasley?” </p>
<p>“It’s not a date Mace,” I explained everything while grabbing my coat and casting a quick cleaning spell over myself. </p>
<p>“Sounds like a date.” I began to protest, but Macie spoke over me. “Assuming you’re right and this isn’t a date, admit it. You wouldn’t be too disappointed if it was.” I could feel my face warming, but I ignored it and the knowing look Macie was giving me. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Percy’s scarf on my nightstand, and after a moment of thought, I shoved it into my bag. </p>
<p>When I went back downstairs, Percy was sitting on a chair staring off into space. The twins were nowhere to be found. “You ready to go?” He nodded. “What did the twins want?”</p>
<p>“Nothing of importance.” </p>
<p>“It never seems to be.” </p>
<p>He scoffed at that, “I assume we’re starting at Honeydukes?” </p>
<p>“Of course.” </p>
<p>After leaving Honeydukes I took Percy’s scarf out of my bag, handing it to him. “I… thanks.” He stared at it blankly before slowly taking it and unfolding it, winding it around my neck. “Thanks.” I looked at the side of his face, as he fiddled with his glasses. We were quiet on the walk to the bookstore. </p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>We’d made it back to the Gryffindor Common Room in the early afternoon, and I had gotten around to the homework I previously neglected. </p>
<p>“Hey Perce, I’m going to bed.” I paused for a second. “Hey, what changed?” </p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I mean, we had a whole routine.” I took one of the lists out of my notebook, “why’d you change it?” </p>
<p>He shrugged, taking the list from me and scanning it. I was almost to the stairs when he called my name. I turned around, watching as he stood from the couch we’d been sitting on. He walked over until he stood right before me. Before I could process, he’d leaned down and pressed a quick kiss to my forehead. He turned around, heading back to the couch looking at the list. As I turned around I saw the twins. Fred was giving George money, and upon seeing I was looking they mimed clapping. I rolled my eyes, but smiled nonetheless.</p>
