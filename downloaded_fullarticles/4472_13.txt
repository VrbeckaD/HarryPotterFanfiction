    <p>"Percy! Wake up!" Grover Underwood chirped, pointing at the window. Percy sighed, the sound of the train rattling over the tracks relaxing him. "Should we put our robes on yet? Oh, wait, im already wearing them! When did I put them on?" </p><p>"The first time we saw a castle..." Percy sighed, glancing at the door of the train compartment. The little cart with the snacks hadn't even come by yet. "You're too excited, man. This will probably just be like Drumstrang. Uptight and soldier like. You liked that place less than I did." </p><p>Grover crinkle his nose. "I hope not... I can hear the other kids though, they keep saying that it's a lot of fun! I hope so! I don't want to get kicked from another magic school. Not like we can go back to Ilvermony." </p><p>Percy laughed, "True, true. I'm just glad my mom didn't flip out."</p><p>"Same. Let's try not to get kicked from Hogwarts. Drumstrang was bad, Ilvermony was stiff. Let's hope this place is fun. I hear they do Quidditch here..." Percy smirked. </p><p>"Hope so." He glanced up at where luggage went. He had his broomstick up there, resting comfortably on a black and red set of robes. Percy closed his eyes again, but before he could get any peace, a girl entered. Blonde hair, storm grey eyes. She sat beside Percy, and he raised an eyebrow. "You get transferred too?"</p><p> "Only because of you, Seaweed Brain." Percy smiled. </p><p>"I missed you too, Wise Girl." Annabeth smiled back softly.</p><p>"Don't start sweet talking me, boy. I had it good back at Ilvermony. Plus, I was transferred two years ago, remember?" Percy frowned. He'd forgotten that. For a whole year, he'd been kidnapped by Kronos and a mysterious silent partner, the bad guy wizards who wanted him dead. Kronos had tortured him for countless days, and the silent guy had kept the death threats on Percys head active. </p><p>He refused to tell his mother that that was part of the reason he was kicked from Drumstrang. She didn't know he'd been kidnapped. He'd fought his way out, tooth and nail, relentlessly. </p><p>"Percy? You okay, man?" Grocers voice jerked Percy from his thoughts. His friends were staring at him. He nodded.</p><p>"I'm fine." Annabeth looked doubting.</p><p>"I heard about what happened, with Kronos..." Percy shrugged. "Everyone was talking about it last year..." </p><p>"Annabeth, I'm okay. I promise. Kronos is in Azkaban, he can't hurt me again." She frowned, and shocked him, by hugging him. </p><p>"I know. But you're still my friend." Perry's eyes went wide, and he stared at Grover for help, but he just laughed to himself at Percys nervousness. He was horrible when it came to girls, especially when they got emotional. </p><p>"And you're mine, but you don't have to worry about me, Wise Girl. I swear." Percy gently pulled Annabeth away, and she sighed.</p><p>"Fine, but put on your robes. Transfers go with Tyson. He's the tall guy, one eye, can't miss him." They gave her dull looks. "That means you." </p><p>"He's got one eye?" Grover snickered.</p><p>"Magic accident, with Poseidon." Percy winced and sighed. Poseidon was his dad. "Don't worry, Percy, he doesn't know. I don't think."</p><p>"And if he does know?"</p><p>"Well, see ya in Hades' realm." </p><p>Percys eyes widened as she stood to leave. The three had a habit of referring to places as realms. Hell was Hades' realm, the Sea was Poseidons realm, the Sky was Zues' realm, and the Earth was Gaea's realm. Fire, water, air earth. It had been Annabeths idea, since she was the braniac of the three. </p><p>"Bye guys!" She waved as she left.</p><p>"She was joking, right Grover? I'm not gonna get killed by a one eyed guy named Tyson, am i?" Grover snickered, and Percy punched him.</p><p>Grover laughed more as Percy grabbed his robes from under his broomstick. He pulled them on over his clothes. They were too big. "Ugh..." </p><p>"I thought they were specially fitted?" Grover snickered</p><p>"Nope." He sighed, and ran a hand through his hair, before straightening out his robes. "Wonder which house we'll be in?"</p><p>***</p><p>When the train stopped, Percy and Grover scrambled to get out first. Luckily, the tall one eyed guy named Tyson was right outside. He had brown hair, and a brown eye, the other one with an eyepatch over it. It seemed odd. He had such a young face, yet the eye patch seemed to be a failed attempt to look piratey. </p><p>Percy and Grover moved towards him. He had a huge sign with 'Transfers here' written in very sloppy, big letters. He saw them, and he smiled. "Grover and Percy?" </p><p>They nodded, Percy more hesitant than Grover. "Percy Jackson?" Percys eyes widened... <em>Please. Please. Please...</em> </p><p>"You're dad is so cool!" Percy looked confused.</p><p>From somewhere behind him, he heard Annabeth laughing, and he scowled. She did it again... he was the prankster, not her, and yet she still got him every day. Grover laughed, and Percy punched him in the shoulder. </p><p>"Come on, we have to get you sorted!" Tyson turned, and started skipping down the path. Percy and Grover followed as Tyson relayed 3 rules, repeatedly.</p><p>1.) No going in the forbidden forest.</p><p>2.) No wandering the halls after dinner.</p><p>3.) Don't get eaten.</p><p>Percy especially agreed with the last rule.</p><p>***</p><p>"Gryffindoor!" The talking hat thing exclaimed before it even settled fully on Grovers head. He seemed to collapse with relief. The professor, Professor Athena, had given them a rough description of the four houses. They both agreed on wanting to be in Gryffindoor. </p><p>Grover hopped over to where three other transfers sat, not paying attention to anything but each other. Percy stepped towards the Professor, and she settled the hat on his head. It sprang to life, and spoke in his head. </p><p><em>Little Perceus Jackson. Where to put you? Slytherin? </em>Percy flinched. <em>No? How about Ravenclaw? No, I guess not... You're not as bright as the blonde girl on your mind. Hufflepuff is much to nice for you... So how about... </em>"Gryffindoor!" The hat yelled, and Percy got such a strong headache, he almost collapsed.</p><p>Grover cheered. "Lots of Gryffindoors this year... Too bad there weren't any Ravenclaws." The professor chimed. Why she did, was odd. She said she was head of the Gryffindoor house...</p><p>"You didn't have to yell..." Percy grumbled at the hat, but it had already lost facial features. It was just an old, leather, hat now. He huffed. At least he was in Gryffindoor with his best friends. Even if he felt like his brain would implode. </p><p>He walked over to Grover, and the three others. Piper, Leo, and Jason. Percy didn't know them, but apparently they'd come from Ilvermony too. Leo had wiry brown hair and ecstatic blue eyes, and he couldn't seem to keep still. Percy knew ADHD, and Leo might as well have had a double shot of espresso to add on to it. Piper had dark brown hair, blue eyes, and the kind of charm that made you want to melt. Jason was blonde, not blonde like Annabeth, but blonde, as well as <em>way</em> too blue eyes.</p><p>He was the only one who seemed truly affected by Pipers natural charm. </p><p> "Miss Athena?" Tysons friendly voice called. "This is Nico, Hazel, and Frank. They got lost." </p><p>Athena smiled kindly, which was more than Percy could say for what he'd received. She'd glared at him. Hazel, the girl, had dark skin, and bouncy brown hair. "I already know which house I'm in, Professor, I just got left behind and couldn't find anyone except Tyson." </p><p>Athena nodded, and proceeded to put the Sorting Hat on Frank and Nico's heads. Frank was declared as a Hufflepuff, and Nico was a Slytherin. Frank had black hair, and an almost baby-like face. Nico was all dark hair and very pale skin. He was what muggles would call a goth.</p><p>Percy glanced at Grover, who was inspecting something Leo had apparently built in the past two minutes. Hmm... Maybe Hogwarts wouldn't be so bad...</p><p>***</p><p>He was wrong.</p><p>Maybe if he'd gone into the Great Hall sooner, or a little later, he wouldn't have gotten slammed square in the face with a chicken leg. Sadly, he got slammed square in the face with a greasy chicken leg.</p><p>He crinkle his nose, but didn't stumble backwards. Grover stared in shock at Percy, and the other transfers behind him seemed to be fighting laughs, </p><p>"Oh, my gods, Octavian! You hit Percy!" Annabeth shouted. The name 'Percy' silenced the rest of the Great Hall as Annabeth ran towards him. "Are you okay!?"</p><p>He said nothing, but nodded. Everyone stared, then slowly turned to stare at the culprit. A blonde from the table with people wearing green and black had wide eyes. "He did it!" A kid yelled, and the blonde was swept from the room by Professor Athena. </p><p>Grover snickered as Annabeth wordlessly led Percy and the other Gryffindoors to the Gryffindoor table. When they sat, the talking started up again. Annabeth hugged Percy, and for the second time that day, Percy was stunned.</p><p>Okay, he'd gotten kidnapped! That didn't mean she had to hug him, right!? </p><p>Talking shushed again as Professor Athena returned, robes swishing around her ankles. Annabeth quietlybnamed the professors.</p><p>Minerva Athena was the Transfiguration teacher. Jupiter Zues, a man with white hair and bright blue eyes, was the headmaster. Luke Castellan was the DADA teacher... Annabeth said DADA meant Defence Against Dark Arts. The other professors blurred together. Helios Apollo, Charms. Chiron, Potions. Tyson, Care of Magical Creatures. </p><p>Percy sighed, shaking his head, "Too many names, Wise Girl." His head still hurt from the Sorting Hat. </p><p>"Sorry, but hey, at least you're Gryffindoor!" </p><p>Grover nodded, "Yeah, you should've heard the hat though. It flat out said he wasn't smart enough for Ravenclaw, unlike the blonde girl on his mind." He said, and Percy blushed, forcing himself to keep chewing on a chicken leg. Not the one that hit Percy, thankfully.</p><p>"Blonde girl? What blonde girl?" She narrowed her eyes at Percy, and he coughed. Did she not know that she was the only blonde girl he knew? "Percy...!?" </p><p>"Hey, you tricked me! Okay? I was thinking about how you tricked me about Tyson! The guys a teddy bear! You said he might send me to see Hades!" Annabeth grinned slyly. "You're a b-" </p><p>"No curse words, Johnson!" Professor Bacchus, or Dionysus, one of the two names, said, walking past him. Percy rolled his eyes, not bothering to correct him. </p><p>"You're a witch." He huffed. </p><p>She smiled and kissed his cheek playfully, "You know it!" </p><p>Percy looked away, blushing slightly, again. Annabeth grinned, before yawning. She leaned her head on Percys shoulder, and he put his arm around her, a little awkwardly. He glanced up at the headmaster table. He got a nasty glare from Professor Castellan and unconsciously tightened his arm around Annabeths shoulders productively. The blonde headmaster was highly unnerving...</p><p>***</p><p>Annabeth had all but fallen asleep on Percy. Despite having been there two years before him and Grover, she had to be lead to the common room by Percy. She was exhausted, and the moving staircases didn't help. Luckily, when they got to the common room, Hazel offered to take her to the girls dormitory. Percy was glad Annabeth managed to meet a friend when she was at Hogwarts without him and Grover.</p><p>On their first, and only, year in Ilvermony, she'd admitted to Percy in a fit of tears that the only people who took her seriously was Percy, Grover, and a girl named Thalia. Thalia was killed that year in a car accident. Then they'd been shipped off to Europe. Annabeth had called Percy in a panic when she'd learned she was going to a different school than them. He'd felt horribly guilty about leaving her alone, but she'd managed to make friends with a lot of people...</p><p>Watching Hazel help Annabeth up the stairs gave him a pang of guilt. He'd promised he'd help her after she'd admitted her lack of good friends, and now, because of a stupid 'no-boys-allowed' charm, he wasnt able to help her. </p><p>Grover barely managed to get him to go to the boys dormitory, where Leo and Jason had vanished. Leo lay on a random bed, wand in hand, robes open, revealing a greased shirt, ripped blue jeans, and a tool belt. He held up his wand, drawing in the air with a trail of fire. </p><p>He'd met a girl at the Gryffindoor table. Calypso. Leo claimed, loudly, that he wasn't doing anything, but Percy knew the spell he was using. He was sending the Ravenclaw girl messages. Percy did it all the time during his captivity with Kronos. He sent a thousand, maybe a million, messages to Annabeth. He told her he was happy and okay, but he'd lied. He wouldn't tell her he was gonna die any day now. He wouldn't tell her that any day could have been his last.</p><p>He refused to do that to her. </p><p>Jason sat on his bed, reading, glasses on, robes off. His space was really neat. Grover, upon opening his chest, turned his space into a death trap that Percy had to trudge through to get to his chest and bed. He opened his chest, taking off his robes. Stuffy.</p><p>That's all he had to call them. They were highly uncomfortable. "I'm going to bed." Percy murdered to Grover, then drew his wand, tracing a few words in the air.</p><p>'Goodnight, Annabeth. ~Seaweed Brain' </p><p>They hung there for a minute, slowly fading into smoke... He wondered if she'd reply. After a couple minutes of waiting, Percy laid down. Before he closed his eyes, he saw her response, and smiled, before going to sleep.</p>
