    <p><span>"Let it be known," Professor Dumbledore spoke, pushing back his chair and rising to his feet. "That Cedric Diggory was killed by Voldemort." The name silenced the last dregs of conversations. He paused for a moment, letting his eyes drag through the hall. "We have come this far, made it through the last few years. We shall not falter in the face of fear." He paused again, "So, a toast, in memory, for Cedric." He raised his goblet and the rest of the hall followed. "To Cedric." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Cedric," the rest of the hall echoed.</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Now," Professor Dumbledore set his goblet down onto the table, "life is not one to stop…" he trailed off, frowning at rafters of the hall. Heads swiveled and people began to point and murmur as an owl swooped down from the ceiling. Dumbledore exchanged a look with Professor McGonagall as the owl landed in front of him. He reached out, offering the owl a handful of treats, and gently untying the letter. He scanned it quickly, frowning at the contents, before duplicating the letter with a murmured, "</span><em><span>genimio"</span></em><span>. He handed one to each Head of the Houses and raised his hands for silence.</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"There is an emergency at the Ministry." At his words, the conversation swelled. He clapped his hands for silence and waited a beat for the students to comply. "It was not an attack." He breathed in once, nodded to Hogwarts, and disappeared. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Everyone to your common room," McGonagall shouted to be heard over the din of all the students talking. "The feast will be served there." People began to get up, clumping together in groups as if Voldemort would spring from the shadows and attack if they were alone. The professors waited until the hall had cleared before another uttered a sound. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"What was it?" Professor Sinistra asked, frowning at the empty hall. The candle lights had dimmed, responding to the mass exodus of the children. It had never looked so barren, with the absence of the students so clear. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>Professor McGonagall sighed, "The letter did not say. However," she paused, her eyes flicking around the hall. She eyed the corner of the room where a lone Hogwarts tapestry was touching the ground. "We'll finish this conversation in the staff room. One hour. Check on your students." She rose sweeping from the hall. With an absentminded flick of her wand, she righted the tapestry, pretending not to hear the sudden inhale from one of the Weasley twins. "You have five minutes before I dock points," she murmured, giving them a moment to escape as she turned to survey the rest of the hall. She nodded to the rest of the staff and headed for the Gryffindor tower. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"I suppose that's our cue," Professor Flitwick, said, stretching from his chair and hopping down to the floor. He strode out of the hall, casting </span><em><span>aparecium</span></em><span> on the letter as he left. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Indeed," Professor Snape said, frowning at the letter in his hand. "Aurora, would you like to accompany me to the common room to help?" She nodded, rising as he did. They stepped down the dais together, Aurora keeping close in order to read the letter over his shoulder.</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>Professor Sprout sighed, pulling her hair down from its tight bun and massaging her temples for a moment before redoing her bun and leaving the hall. The rest of the staff members looked at each other and rose as well, heading for the staff chamber. </span> </p><p> </p><p align="center"><span>***</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>In the Gryffindor common room, Harry was huddled in a corner surround by the Weasleys, Hermione, and Neville. Even the warmth of the fires couldn't penetrate the tense undertone that was obvious within the room. People started talking and would abruptly stop, staring at the flames as though they had the answers to the universe. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>Neville anxiously fiddled with a stem of gillyweed he had found in his pocket, as Hermione bent over a book. Her eyes were completely still, the only piece that gave away that she wasn't reading. Harry absentmindedly pet Crookshanks as he tilted his head back, taking in the ceiling of the room. The three of them were silent, blocking out the low murmurs of Ron and Ginny playing a half-hearted game of Wizards Chess. The door swung open, silencing the entire room. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>Fred and George slid in, making their way towards the five. The door slammed shut, echoing throughout. No one moved or breathed, taking in the lack of a smile on the twin's face and the steady way that they strode through the room. The two said nothing, sitting down on either side of Hermione, who handed them each a sheet of paper. Ron and Ginny frowned at the sight. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Hermione," Harry said, lifting his head up to watch the three of them. "What-" He cut himself off, as the door swung open once more. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>Professor McGonagall entered, each sharp click of her heel winding the tension up. She came to a stop at the entrance of the common room, her eyes lingering on the twins and Hermione, who had her head down. "Professor Dumbledore has been taken from the school due to an incident at the Ministry." She paused, her eyes taking in the ways the younger students clasped hands and shuffled closer together as they braced themselves for bad news. "There was no confirmation as to when he would return. For now, assume that was the last time you will see him until the beginning of next year." She breathed in once sharply. "It had no hallmarks of an attack from Voldemort. I will, however, inform you that the seal of the letter had a mark of the Unspeakables, as I am certain that that will get out regardless." The room erupted into chatter, as she marched over to Hermione and the twins. "You three with me." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"But Professor-" Ron protested, his hand reaching out to touch Hermione's shoulder before dropping back to his side.</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"No," McGonagall said. "They must come with me." She looked around the room once before leaning closer into their huddled group. "You must stay here. Keep watch. Do not let anyone leave. If someone must find me, use the map and the cloak, Mr. Potter." She said, making eye contact with him and ignoring his look of surprise. "These three must come with me. Food will be dropped off shortly. Do not leave this tower."</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"But-" Ron began again. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"It's fine, Ron," Hermione said quietly, her bag in her hand. "Don't worry. We'll be together." Ron subsided with a small nod, as Harry reached out and squeezed her hand. Neville patted her on the back and she frowned at all of them. "I'm going to see you all on the express. Stop looking so sad." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Ms. Granger," McGonagall said, looking at her watch. "The three of you must be going." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"We'll be fine," George assured the group. </span> </p><p><br/>
 <br/>
<span>"Blimey," Fred said. "It's almost as though you don't trust us." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>Ginny arched an eyebrow. "We don't." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Oi!" They said together. Hermione rolled her eyes and got to her feet. The twins followed her and Professor McGonagall as they left the common room. Fred winked at Harry as they left. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>As soon as the door shut behind the three of them, the room got quiet once again. Harry sighed, getting to his feet and standing on the coffee table in front of his couch. "Listen up. Professor McGonagall doesn't want anyone leaving just yet." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Really?" Lee asked, "Why did Fred and George and Granger get to leave then." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Oi," Ron said standing up. "Watch it Jordan." Lee rolled his eyes and opened his mouth to respond but Harry interrupted. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"We don't know where they went." He shrugged. "I don't think we'll know 'til they return tomorrow." He stepped down from the table. "McGonagall also said that food would be arriving-" A loud clatter interrupted him as food appeared on the tables scattered throughout the room. "-now." He finished quietly, sitting back down on the couch as the chatter from earlier resumed. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"It'll be fine," Neville said, suddenly. "It's Hermione and the twins after all." He got up, heading for their room, ignoring Dean and Seamus' gestures to sit with them.</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>Ron nodded, grabbing a plate of food. "Neville's right. They’ll be fine Harry, don't worry about it." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"I hope so," Harry said, frowning at the entrance of the common room. "I really, really hope so."</span> </p><p> </p><p align="center"><span>***</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>The four of them marched down a hallway silently. Hermione was sandwiched between the twins, taking comfort in their steady presence. Professor McGonagall stopped suddenly, bringing the four of them to an abrupt halt. She cast a glance up and down the hallway before casting </span><em><span>muffliato</span></em><span>.</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Ms. Granger, I am aware of what you've done for these two." She sniffed. "I must say I am quite surprised that you'd invest so much of your time into something so fanciful." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"She's not done one thing!" Fred protested. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Yeah!" George added. "Not a single bloody thing." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Professor," Hermione said, clasping her hands together gently. "They may use their brains for pranks and jinx's but it is still such remarkable magic." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>Professor McGonagall inclined her head. "That it may be," she paused, "But that is not why I have brought you three out here." She turned to the twins. "I must ask that you not speak of the worry and fear that the staff displayed. The students are too worried already." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>Fred and George nodded as one. "We wouldn't-" they began. "It's not funny to the little ones when their headmaster gets whisked away and someone has died."</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"'Sides," George finished. "There aren't even good jokes to make." McGonagall stared at him. He amended his statement, "Not that we would!"</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>She measured them a little bit more before nodding once, sharply. "Off to the common room with you then."</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"What about 'Mione?" Fred asked. Frowning at the look the two exchanged. "Oi! How do you already know so much about this?" </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>Hermione sighed. "I guessed." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>McGonagall sniffed. "Mr. and Mr. Weasley. Go." The two exchanged a look, jogging backward slowly. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"You sure?" Fred called, glancing over his shoulder to make sure he wasn't in danger of running into a suit of armor.</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"We can stay?" George offered, stumbling over the edge of his robe but remaining on his feet. "It's no problem."  The two of them paused for a moment waiting for Professor McGonagall or Hermione to call them back. When no voice came after them, they shrugged in unison, before turning and racing away. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>McGonagall sighed through her nose. "Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington," she summoned, waiting a moment before Nearly Headless Nick floated through the floors. "Follow them." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>He inclined his head, waiting for a shocked gasp as his head tipped off and dangled from his neck. Professor McGonagall merely sighed again. "No one appreciates the arts these days," Nick muttered to himself as he drifted through a wall. "Unbelievable." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>She turned to look at Hermione. "Now Ms. Granger, just what do you think you know?" </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>Hermione frowned at the ground, clearly gathering her thoughts together. McGonagall pinched the bridge of her nose and resisted the urge to snap at her. "Well," She finally began after a minute of silence. "I'm assuming it has something to do with the fact that either, 1, I'm a muggleborn or, 2, I've experienced something no one else has." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>McGonagall raised her eyebrow. "That's quite a claim to make, Ms. Granger." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>Hermione blushed, shaking out her hair. "And," she mumbled, "the twins and I were testing new listening devices, like from James Bond." At Professor McGonagall's blank look, she blushed even more fiercely. "James Bond is a spy for the-" </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>McGonagall cut her off. "I know who James Bond is."</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Well, they had the device on them, when they were-" Hermione cut herself off. "Anyways, one of them managed to use another device to scan your document that Headmaster Dumbledore gave you, and they handed it to me right before you came in. I wasn't able to read much but I did read one thing- time travel."</span> </p><p> </p><p align="center"><span>***</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>Outside the castle, things began stirring, sensing a magic that had not been seen within the magical community for thousands of years. Within the lakes and forests, spirits awoke, startling those who already lived within.</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>Inside the Ministry, corridors that were normally empty at this time of night were filled with light. Loud voices echoed in the hallways outside of the room but within, people spoke with whispers. Dumbledore stood to the side, next to the Minister, Cornelius Fudge, the DMLE head, Amelia Bones, and the head of Unspeakables, Bernard Croaker.</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"What happened?" Dumbledore asked, studying the proceedings very carefully. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"If we knew that we wouldn't have called you, now would we have, Dumbledore." Fudge said, spinning his bowler hat around his hand anxiously. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Now, now, Minister." Croaker cautioned. "We sort of know what happened."</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"We do?" Bones asked, arching an eyebrow. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Well, of course, Madam Bones." Croaker responded gesturing. "They came through that veil."</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>The four of them turned to face the Whispering Veil. Dumbledore frowned, "Could it be dark magic?" </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"That's the thing, Headmaster." Croaker answered. "We can't get a handle on their magic at all."</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"What?" Bones said, tilting her head. "How is that possible?"</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>Croaker shrugged. "It's like our spells can't get a grasp on the magic that they do have." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"So they do have magic?" Fudge rubbed his hands over his face. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Yes," Croaker said. "But they also have those wisps of time all over them." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Yes," Dumbledore said. "I read that in your note. What exactly does that mean?" </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Well," Croaker began. "Time is a stream. It never really falters in the face of issues, it simply splits and continues. When a time turner is used, and the reason why it is such a heavily guarded piece of magic, it momentarily forces the time to surge against itself. The power in the time turner lets it go back, but it also steals small bits of life when it is turned. So, going back an hour or two, or even potentially say, a whole day, would do small damage to the person who's spinning the turner. But if someone were to attempt to use it for more than a day, and even then, a day would truly be pushing it, they would sacrifice their life."</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Yes, yes, we know all this." Fudge spluttered. "But what does this have to do with these children?" </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>Croaker blinked once before continuing, causing Fudge to blush and fall silent. "Due to the fact that time can split, there are other realities." He held up a hand to forestall any questions from Fudge. "This is not the first time someone has come through this veil. However, this is the first time so many have come through, and also the first time that they've been alive." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Well, I'd never-" Fudge muttered under his breath. "Keeping secrets from me- ha!" </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>Madam Bones stared at him before focusing back on Croaker. "What does that mean?" </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"We think it means that they have some sort of magic, although some of the others who've come through have had small traces on them." Croaker shook his head. "These all have different magics touching them." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Different magics?" Fudge asked, scowling at the ground. "Bah - what kind of different magic?"</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Elemental magic, love magic, and another magic that has no name, one that we've never seen before." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"No name magic?" Fudge whispered, paling. He sneered when no one answered him and looked away from the group.</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Elemental magic?" Dumbledore questioned, peering closer at the kids on the ground. "Which kinds?" </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Headmaster, you know as well as I that there is no way to tell until they wake up." Croaker reprimanded. "To suggest to do so would be a violation of their rights." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Do so anyway." Fudge commanded. "They have no rights on our land." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Minister." Bones narrowed her eyes. "I sincerely hope you're not suggesting that we draw blood and take experiment on it to only fuel our curiosity into who or what they are. Provoking them is not a way to go. And," she gestured around the chamber. "they're only children."</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Only children?" Fudge spluttered. "They have no-name-magic! That's impossible! We know all the magics, or we should," he continued in an undertone before regaining his strident tone. "I will not have it!" </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Minister-" Croaker began. "I cannot-" </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"I do not think you will have long to wait," Dumbledore interrupted, "It appears they are awakening." </span> </p><p> </p><p align="center"><span>***</span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Bloody hell," one of the Unspeakables whispered. One of the kids was blinking awake. "Hey, hey," He continued. "You're okay, you're okay." </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>The kids' green eyes locked onto his face. "Annabeth," he whispered. The pools of water that had come through the veil with them slowly began to rise. "Who are you?" </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>"Stay calm," the Unspeakable instructed. "We're not here to hurt you." The boy blinked twice before nodding and letting the tension bleed out of him. 'Thank god' the Unspeakable thought, missing the way the boy's hands fell into the water. "Sir?" He said, turning to Croaker. "This one-" He cut himself off. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>The water which had been resting on the ground had surrounded each and every Unspeakable which was tending to a person who had come through the veil. Croaker had stepped forward, raising his hands in an unthreatening manner and the water had left him alone. Fudge, however, had brandished his wand as soon as the water began to move and was currently frozen to the ground. Behind him, Dumbledore and Bones had both raised their hands. </span> </p><p> </p><p><span>The Unspeakable felt movement behind him and turned to see the boy getting to his feet. "Now," He said, his eyes flashing dangerously, "Tell me just who the Hades you are."</span> </p><p>
