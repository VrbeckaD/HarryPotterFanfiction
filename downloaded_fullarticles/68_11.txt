  <b>Chapter I: Longbottom pt. 1</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Augusta Longbottom could hardly believe it. There was a marriage contract for her Grandson. True it was an ancient one. It came from the time just after the founding of Hogwarts. The Longbottoms had long been the stewards for the Hufflepuff family. True she was not a Longbottom by Birth. And therefore had no sway over the affairs of the Hufflepuff estate. Her beloved son Frank, might have known. But then he had to decide to fight he-who-must-not-be-named. Foolish boy. He was her son and should have let others do the fighting. Now he is considered a War Hero. But what good did that do Her? She needed him here. Running the house. The only good thing was that he had married. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Granted Alice Longbottom nee Clearwater was not her first choice for a bride for her precious son. But at least she had given the house an heir. Granted that heir was just about as magically weak and useless as you could get. But maybe he would give the king a stronger heir. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Augusta looked up from her plate of tea sandwiches, biscuits and her cup of tea at the sound of wings. She sees a grand eagle owl bearing the crest of Gringotts. She lifts her arm allowing the great bird to land. She removes the letter. “If you need a rest friend, please take one in the owlery. There you will find food, water, some owl treats and an empty perch.” The bird left the room and flew off. She opened the letter. And began to read.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dear Madam Longbottom,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It is our pleasure to inform you that the treatment we offered Lord and lady Longbottom has worked. They are awake and shall make a full recovery. As mentioned in our previous correspondence, your family will not be billed. It was paid for in full by the family to which Heir Longbottom is contracted to. Look forward to reuniting your family. Thank you for the opportunity to take care of your Son and Daughter-in-law. The data our healers gathered will help us serve the future needs of our clients better.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sincerely,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Healer Asahook.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Head Healer of Gringotts.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The letter fluttered from her hands and landed on the table. “Bipsy!” She called out to the head house elf. With a pop the little creature appeared. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Mistress?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Have my Grandson get ready. We are going out to Diagon Alley. Also send another elf to clean up the tea service.” she commanded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Mistress. However, Little Master has not had his lunch yet. Should we not wait till he has?” Bipsy asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why on earth would we do that?” she asked “My son is awake. The goblins were able to heal him and his wife.” the little creature gave her a look that she could not interpret. Before popping away. She went to her room and got ready.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When she exited the floo network at the Leaky Cauldron with her grandson in tow, she marched right to the brick wall and let them out into the alley. </span>
