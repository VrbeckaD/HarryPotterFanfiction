    <p>Prologue</p><p> </p><p>Mal’s first memory was of her mother screaming.</p><p> </p><p>“Devil child! We must take her to the priests! They can pray it out of her.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait Isabel! I am surprised she has magic but we can’t do that. You see my parents were magical but I’m not. So I became part of your world, I went to Eton and got a degree from Oxford. My parents didn’t expect to have me and I was a late born, that’s why they think I have no magic.”</p><p> </p><p>“Bryan, your parents were devil worshipers?” her mother gasped.</p><p> </p><p>“No, they aren’t. They were born with it the same as you were born with blonde hair. I can try to see if my witch cousin will adopt her…”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want her here! She’ll curse any children we have.”</p><p> </p><p>“If that’s what you want, I’ll take her to Mary…”</p><p> </p><p>Unwanted…</p><p> </p><p>Her own papa wanted to give her away…</p><p> </p><p>Matilda curled up in her crib and cried.</p><p> </p><p align="center">XoooooX</p><p> </p><p>Hermione loved learning…</p><p> </p><p>She’d read any book she could find no matter how thick.</p><p> </p><p>Forget picture books, Hermione had read the entire dictionary when she was four.</p><p> </p><p>She memorised all those words, and words were powerful things. She had been so happy when she found out that her school would teach them Latin and she bought every Latin book she could find eventually reading books like Winnie the Pooh in Latin with an English copy beside her. Even The Little Prince was more magical in Latin…</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t really think she was that odd when she reached out and books jumped into her hand. After all, if Matilda from Rhode Dahl’s book could do it, why not her?</p><p> </p><p>Until she realised mum and dad couldn’t do that. She was very careful not to be seen doing it.</p><p> </p><p>Her eidetic memory was troublesome.</p><p> </p><p>When she was little she was praised for being smart but when her parents’ colleagues children were studying to test into good schools they said scathing things that Hermione never had to study because she already knew it all.</p><p> </p><p>The other children teased her mercilessly calling her big-headed, a know-it-all, brainiac and stuck-up.</p><p> </p><p>Teachers wrote on her report card that while her grades were high that she wasn’t social and that she didn’t cooperate with others. When there were projects, Hermione always took a table in the corner and did it alone.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t want to work with her so why should she try to make friends? Either they just gossiped leaving her to do all the work or they spent the time making cutting remarks, so she decided she was better off alone.</p><p> </p><p>One day she ran home and locked herself in the bathroom, she was so lonely…</p><p> </p><p>She let out a cry of anguish; she was keening…</p><p> </p><p>The mirror cracked, the pipe beneath the sink burst and the window shattered. As the water covered the floor and glass rained down Hermione rocked feeling so alone.</p><p> </p><p>Was there anywhere she would be accepted? Where her intelligence would be celebrated rather than reviled?</p><p> </p><p>She knew her parents loved her and were proud of her but it wasn’t enough…</p><p> </p><p>Then Albus Dumbledore came into her life…</p><p> </p><p> </p>
