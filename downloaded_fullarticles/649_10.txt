    <p>Bob Chandler and Barb Weston Chandler, of 14 Branchland Court, were proud to say that they never had a son that wasn't perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.</p><p>Bob was a retired engineer, and without him the NES might not have come so soon. He was an old-fashioned man, and he was very outspoken. Barbara was large, enough to conceal her neck, but that didn't stop her from craning over garden fences to make sure there wouldn't be any trouble from the neighbors. Barb had a son called Cole, but he had moved out quickly after he fell off a bus and sustained mild brain damage, which he took out on Barb.</p><p>The Chandlers had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about Christopher.</p><p>Christopher was Borb's other son, but they didn't want people to know he was spawned from their loins. in fact, Borb pretended they didn't have a son when they were out without him, because he was a shame upon the Chandler and Weston names. The Chandlers shuddered to think what the citizens of Ruckersville would say if they ever found out Christopher was their son.</p><p>When Borb woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the world. Bob sighed as he picked through Nintendo cartridges in search of his keys and Barb gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Christopher out of his favorite shirt, which had godawful horizontal rainbow stripes, and the shirt into the washer.</p><p>None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.</p><p>At half past eight, Bob grabbed his wallet, pecked Barb on the cheek, and tried to kiss Christopher good-bye but missed, because Christopher was now having a tantrum and throwing his shoes at the walls. "Little shit... and little wonder the school board hates him. I'll make a man of him someday," mumbled Bob as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number 14's drive.</p><p>It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- an unfamiliar cat reading a map. For a second, Bob didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Branchland Court, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been all the stress from Christopher's latest stunt -- since last December, after the mall conductor bear mistook his name for one from his native England, Christopher had been constantly nagging him and Barbara to change his name to Christian. Bob blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Bob drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Branchland Court -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. Bob gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except his favorite meal; it was far easier to forget his family that way.</p><p>But on the edge of town, breakfast was driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Bob couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- it reminded him of his own son. He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Bob was bewildered to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! What grown man would wear such ridiculous clothing? But then it struck Bob that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Bob pulled into the Burger King parking lot, ordered a meal and sat down in his favorite seat.</p><p>Bob always stopped at Burger King for his morning meal. It helped him escape his miserable son and manipulative bitch of a wife. He didn't see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people outside did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Bob, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He made some calls to the electric company in his car after finishing, and went to his favorite diner, where he'd scheduled a small get-together and, most importantly, he wasn't going to be the one paying. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd pick up some McDonald's on the way home for Barb and Christopher.</p><p>He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them in the McDonald's parking lot. He eyed them angrily as he pulled into the drive-through. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a family meal in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.</p><p>"The Chandlers, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, Christopher."</p><p>Bob stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.</p><p>He dashed back to his car, seized his cell phone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. Christopher was a fucking nightmare. If those strange people were plotting his kidnapping, he and Barb could finally have some peace. In that case, he'd never heard of a boy called Christopher. Or Christian. Or any boy called Weston, Chandler, or Weston Chandler. There was no good in telling Barb; she was almost as bad as Christopher. He didn't blame Cole for hating her -- if he'd had a mother like that... either way, those people in cloaks were suspicious...</p><p>He found it a lot harder to relax that afternoon and when he went for a walk at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the corner store.</p><p>"Sorry," he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Bob realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, "Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even No-Majes like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!"</p><p>And the old man hugged Bob around the middle and walked off.</p><p>Bob stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a No-Maj, whatever that was. He was getting a little worried. Even Christopher and Barb didn't deserve to be kidnapped by these weirdos; especially since it might have meant Christopher wouldn't grow into a mature, well-adjusted adult with a steady job and relationship and a paid-off mortgage. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he was getting pretty damn sick of his own son's imagination.</p><p>As he pulled into the driveway of number 14, the first thing he saw -- and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.</p><p>"Get out!" said Bob loudly. The cat didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. This wasn't normal cat behavior, Bob thought. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.</p><p>Barb and Christopher had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter. He told him about how he got beaten up worse than usual at school the previous morning, yet was left well alone that day. Bob noticed something.</p><p>"Boy, what the hell is going on with your eyes?" Bob asked, pointing at Christopher's right eye, which had a strange greenish tint, barely noticable but distinct from his typically blue eyes.</p><p>"Well... At school, I... They..." Christopher burst into tears.</p><p>When Barb had consoled Christopher and put him to bed, Bob went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:</p><p>"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern." The newscaster allowed himself a grin. "Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?"</p><p>"Well, Ted," said the weatherman, "I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers all around, from Charlottesville to Richmond, have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! I guess people are still celebrating Valentine's Day -- Maybe their beds wore out and they still aren't sated, so they're taking their energy to fireworks displays! Crazy, but so are recent events. But I can promise a wet night tonight... Maybe in more ways than one, if I'm right."</p><p>Bob sat frozen in his armchair at the horrific breach of TV conduct as the weatherman was dragged off the set. Shooting stars all over Virginia? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? Odd enough, but there was the whisper, the whisper about Christopher...</p><p>Barb came into the living room carrying a can of Fanta. It was no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. "Er -- Barbara, dear -- you don't happen to know if anything different's been going on with Christopher, do you?"</p><p>As he had expected, Barb looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended Christopher wasn't theirs.</p><p>"No," she said sharply. "Why?"</p><p>"Funny stuff on the news," Bob mumbled. "Owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today..."</p><p>"So?" snapped Barb.</p><p>Barb slurped some Fanta. Bob wondered whether he ought to tell her he'd heard the name "Chandler." He decided he ought to. He took a deep breath and said,</p><p>"Those people around town... They were talking about our son. About Christopher."</p><p>Barb dropped the can. "Are you sure?"</p><p>"Well... there IS a reason we go out pretending to not know him."</p><p>"I guess you're right," said Barb, before ducking into the kitchen to grab a fresh can. "Maybe that damned principal resigned because of what he did to Christopher."</p><p>"Sounds about right," said Bob, his heart leaping at his wife's lack of suspicion. "Yes, I don't doubt that."</p><p>He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Barb was in the bathroom, Bob crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Branchland Court as though it were waiting for something.</p><p>Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with those people that might be coming for Christopher? If it did, he'd finally be rid of him, but... if it got out that they were related to such a ridiculous child -- well, he didn't think he could bear it.</p><p>The Chandlers got into bed. Snorlax fell asleep quickly but Bob lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that by the time he awoke, he may very well have less annoyance in his life.</p><p>If only he realized just how horribly right this would go.</p><p>Bob might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Branchland Court. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.</p><p>A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.</p><p>Fortunately for him, Branchland Court was no stranger to such oddity as himself. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.</p><p>Albus Dumbledore seemed to almost be counting his blessings that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was relatively tame compared to the residents. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, "I should have known."</p><p>He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even that stubbornly nosey Barbara Chandler, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number 14, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.</p><p>"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall."</p><p>He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.</p><p>"How did you know it was me?" she asked.</p><p>"My dear Professor, I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly."</p><p>"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day," said Professor McGonagall.</p><p>"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here."</p><p>Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.</p><p>"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right," she said impatiently. "You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something's going on. It was on their news." She jerked her head back at the Chandlers' dark living-room window. "I heard it. Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars over Richmond -- I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense."</p><p>"You can't blame them," said Dumbledore gently. "We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years."</p><p>"I know that," said Professor McGonagall irritably. "But that's no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors."</p><p>She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. "A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?"</p><p>"It certainly seems so," said Dumbledore. "We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?"</p><p>"A what?"</p><p>"A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of."</p><p>"No, thank you," said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops. "As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone -"</p><p>"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this 'You-Know-Who' nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort." Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. "It all gets so confusing if we keep saying things like 'You-Know-Who' or even 'Volxemort'. I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.</p><p>"I know you haven't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. "But you're different. Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of."</p><p>"You flatter me," said Dumbledore calmly. "Voldemort had powers I will never have."</p><p>"Only because you're too -- well -- noble to use them."</p><p>"It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs."</p><p>Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, "The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone's saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally stopped him?"</p><p>It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever "everyone" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer, in a manner reminiscent of the boy who lived inside 14 Branchland Court.</p><p>"What they're saying," she pressed on, "is that Monday morning Volxe- ah, Voldemort turned up at a school. He went to find the boy there we've been scouting. The rumor is that he's the one who killed Voldemort."</p><p>Dumbledore nodded. Professor McGonagall slumped against a fence.</p><p>"After all that... Voldemort was killed by a prepubescent boy? A prepubescent, MUGGLE-BORN boy? I mean, without even knowing he was a wizard?"</p><p>Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. "I know... I know..." he said heavily.</p><p>Professor McGonagall sat down in an attempt to control her shock. "...He couldn't kill that little boy. They're saying that when he couldn't kill Christopher Weston Chandler, Voldemort's power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone."</p><p>Dumbledore nodded again.</p><p>"After all he's done... all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy... It's just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the name of heaven did Christopher survive?"</p><p>"We can only guess," said Dumbledore. "We may never know."</p><p>Dumbledore took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, "Hagrid's late. I suppose it was he who told you where Christopher lives, by the way?"</p><p>"Yes," said Professor McGonagall. "And I suppose you're here for the same reason that I am?"</p><p>"I'm surprised there aren't more wizards on his doorstep, really."</p><p>"But how do you intend to get this boy to come with you?" asked Professor McGonagall, rising to her feet and pointing at number 14. "The answer is -- you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't find a worse family. The father hates the boy and his mother, the mother is hardly any better, and they've got another son-"</p><p>"Yes, but he won't be a problem. He's moved out before we started scouting the boy," said Dumbledore.</p><p>"No, their third son -- A younger brother, perhaps -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. How do you think we'll get a boy from this family to come with us?!"</p><p>"That would be Christopher," Dumbledore explained.</p><p>"That's Christopher?" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down. "This boy is the one who killed Volsemort? The autistic boy that wears godawful shirts, stuffs his face constantly and tried to grab a woman's breast at McDonalds, where he eats almost every meal! This boy will grow up to be an international laughingstock, I'm sure! This boy killed the man whose name is feared across the wizarding world?"</p><p>"That's Christopher," said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. "And I'll have you know present character is no indication of future character. I'm sure he will learn eventually. After all, he killed Voldemort, he cannot possibly be evil."</p><p>Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, "Yes -- yes, you're right, of course. But what is your plan to transport him to school, Dumbledore?" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be planning on swishing it over Christopher and making him disappear like a Muggle "magician" would.</p><p>"Hagrid's bringing him."</p><p>"You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?"</p><p>"I would trust Hagrid with my life," said Dumbledore.</p><p>"I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place," said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, "but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does tend to -- what was that?"</p><p>A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.</p><p>If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins.</p><p>"Hagrid," said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. "At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?"</p><p>"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir," said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. "Young Sirius Black lent it to me. What's the plan for bringing in the boy, sir?"</p><p>"We're going to try a letter first. If that doesn't work, you can tell them in person."</p><p>"A letter, sir? Wouldn't it just be easier to tell them in person as plan A?"</p><p>"Easier, yes. But it would also be highly conspicuous. This is a nosey neighborhood, and the neighbors will almost definitely hear if we're not careful."</p><p>"Alright. Can I get a picture of him then?"</p><p>"Here," said Dumbledore, handing Hagrid a photograph of Christopher. Hagrid stared at the picture for the longest time before he figured out why.</p><p>"Look at that, his eyes are a little different from each other."</p><p>Professor McGonagall leaned over to look. "I could've sworn his eyes were both the same when I was posing as a substitute teacher last Friday," she whispered.</p><p>"Yes," said Dumbledore. "But that seems to be the mark Voldemort gave him when he died. It'll be that way forever."</p><p>"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?"</p><p>"Even if I could, I wouldn't. These permanent marks can come in handy. I have a scar above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground and I've known a man with a pimple that disspelled tracking magic, and his son had a scar that hurt when evil was near."</p><p>"Wait just a minute, sir," Hagrid interrupted, "I've been meanin' to ask -- Why the hell are we taking in a yankee? Ilvermony won't be happy about this."</p><p>"They've been having financial troubles as of late," replied Dumbledore, "And either way, why wouldn't we want Voldemort's killer?"</p><p>"But why would Voldemort want to kill him in the first place?"</p><p>"I'm sure you’ll figure it out in good time. So, we've a plan, and no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations."</p><p>"Yeah," said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, "I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back. G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir." Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.</p><p>"I'd wager he'd been waiting for an excuse to ride that bike for quite awhile," said Dumbledore with a chuckle.</p><p>Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Branchland Court glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. "Good luck, Christopher," he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.</p><p>A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Branchland Court, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Christopher Weston Chandler turned inside his blankets without falling asleep. He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country, who clearly never met him, were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: "To Christopher Weston Chandler -- the boy who lived!"</p>
