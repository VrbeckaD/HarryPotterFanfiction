<p>His legs were <em>burning</em>, just like his lungs. But he couldn't stop. Not if Harry didn't want to be caught by his cousin's gang.</p>

<p>Tangled, dark riglets threated to obscure his vision and a pair of glasses with broken frames clings to the bridge of his nose by beads of sweat that drip from his nearing-greasy hairline. Too big shoes are almost launched with every desperate fling of his legs. His shirt was drenched with his exhaustion, though it was hidden by the dress-like sweater and sagging jeans.</p>

<p> Boys, much larger than he, were after Harry. His cousin headed the charge; wanting to spread the nasty yellow that already on Harry's skin, and bloom violent purple across the skinny child.</p>
