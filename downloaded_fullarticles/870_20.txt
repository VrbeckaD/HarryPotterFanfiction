    <p>Hermione wasn’t too big on the holidays. At least not anymore. It had  been years and things just weren’t the same. She still hadn’t found her parents. She had hidden them too well. Even from herself. The war was over but they all had lost people and things that were important. So she had moved on, as best as she knew how. </p><p>She also wasn’t a Grinch but celebrating Yule without a family to speak of? Just didn’t sound appealing at all. So she always chose to work during the holidays. Her colleagues were thankful and Hermione could do something other than moping around in her apartment all alone. Sure, Ron and Harry had both offered that she could spend the holidays with them. And before the war Hermione probably would have happily agreed. But without her parents it had just felt wrong to accept. In addition, she liked the peace and quiet at the office during those days. She got a whole lot of paperwork done. And no one was around to remind her to get home in time either. </p><p>Having worked well into the night Hermione rubbed her eyes and put her quill aside to check the time. It was almost Christmas Day and even Hermione decided that she had been at work long enough. Neatly organizing her desk for tomorrow before grabbing her coat Hermione stood and headed towards the closest elevator. </p><p>As Hermione waited for the doors to open she took in the sight of their shared office floor. Her own desk aside everyone had chosen to decorate. Little ornaments and lights were flying or hanging around everywhere. She smiled a little. It <em> was </em> beautiful. And maybe she would place the tiny Yule tree Harry had gotten her onto her desk tomorrow. It had been a sweet gift after all. </p><p>Behind her the elevator doors opened and Hermione stepped inside. Even at this hour cheery holiday tunes were playing and Hermione cursed whoever had been in charge of those. She was no Grinch, but that was simply too much. Since it was almost midnight Hermione hadn’t expected her elevator to have any in between stops on its way to the atrium, but when the doors opened again the ride had been way too short for her to have reached her destination.</p><p>Surprised the young witch looked up and she froze when she came face to face with Bellatrix Black. After the war she had changed her name back, no longer wanting to be known as Lestrange.</p><p>Hermione must have stared for a few seconds too long. For when Bellatrix stepped into the elevator she quipped, “staring is rude.”</p><p>Caught Hermione lowered her gaze while heat rose in her cheeks. After the war, no one knew how they were supposed to handle Bellatrix Black. Making a 180 turn from their worst enemy to the most valuable undercover agent and war hero was hard to comprehend. Now Bellatrix had her own department at the ministry, hunting down death eaters that were still roaming around freely and in hiding. Or so Hermione had heard. It was all rather hush hush. Strictly need to know basis. And despite her own important role in the war, apparently Hermione wasn’t in the need to know. </p><p>The silence between them felt awkward but Hermione simply had no idea what she could possibly talk about with Bellatrix. For all she knew Bellatrix didn’t even remember her. While Hermione would always have a reminder of Bellatrix on her forearm. </p><p>“I won’t bite this time, muddy,” Bellatrix chuckled.</p><p>Hermione covered her scar with her hand, despite it not even being visible right now. So that answered her question. Bellatrix apparently very much remembered who she was. Before Hermione could respond however the elevator stopped. Fleeing wouldn’t be the most graceful exit, but Hermione didn’t feel like confronting the older witch. But instead of opening doors Hermione was met with metal bars which she almost ran into. Only now did she realize that they hadn’t even reached the atrium. Everything around them was still black. Oh, no.</p><p>They were stuck.</p><p>“Bloody hell,” Hermione swore under hear breath as she turned towards the buttons. In her rising panic she smashed the atrium button repeatedly. But nothing happened. </p><p>“Don’t think that’s going to be helpful, muddy,” Bellatrix quipped again and crossed her arms in front of her chest. </p><p>This time Hermione spun around to give the other witch a glare. “You got a better idea?!” she snapped. “I don’t see an emergency button!” Something that she would have to bring up. How didn’t these elevators have emergency buttons?!</p><p>“Those usually aren’t needed,” Bellatrix replied calmly. “And calm down, muddy. That’s no way to talk to an old acquaintance, is it?”</p><p>“Don’t call me that. If you remember me then use my name,” Hermione snapped. Tight spaces were getting to her. She wasn’t even sure why. Or when that had started. But apparently it also made her bold. Bold enough to snap at Bellatrix. “You don’t see me calling you Lestrange, Black,” she added before she could stop herself. Hermione expected Bellatrix to lash out. Curse her. Hex her. When she was lucky. Killing her still seemed like the most likely option inside her head. </p><p>But instead Bellatrix nodded. “Very well, that’s fair. Still feisty, I see, Granger. You always were.” The older witch raised an eyebrow when Hermione just looked back at her in surprise. “You have spent too much time with that weasel-boy. Your conversation skills have gone down the drain.”</p><p>“I don’t see him often anymore,” Hermione almost huffed defensively. When Bellatrix simply laughed it made Hermione even more furious.</p><p>“Is that why you’re here so late during the holidays?” Bellatrix asked smugly. “Has weasel-boy moved on?”</p><p>Hermione just groaned and leaned back against the elevator before sliding down until she was sitting on the floor. “Could you stop being annoying, Black?!” she asked. “All of this is none of your business!”</p><p>Bellatrix didn’t seem fazed by her outburst and simply shrugged. “Good for you, Granger. That boy was much too simple for you anyways,” Bellatrix replied. </p><p>“Don’t you mean that I wasn’t worthy of a pureblood?” Hermione snorted without looking up at Bellatrix. She noticed that Bellatrix herself was sitting down too from the corner of her eye. She drew her feet closer against herself so their feet wouldn’t be touching. </p><p>“Please,” Bellatrix laughed and rested her head against the elevator wall. “Mudblood or not, you were always too good for that weasel.”</p><p>That was perhaps the nicest thing Bellatrix had ever said to her. And it was unexpected. Hermione glanced at the other woman and found that Bellatrix was staring at her. “Staring is rude,” she echoed Bella’s earlier words. And once again the dark haired woman laughed briefly. “You had a funny way of showing that,” Hermione muttered under her breath in addition. Whatever magic had been infused in Bellatrix’ knife, it had made sure that the scar would never entirely fade. Many healers had tried but all had been forced to give up when faced with ancient magic like that. Despite her words being mumbled Hermione had expected some sort of reply from Bellatrix. So she found herself glancing at the other woman. If she didn’t know any better Hermione would have said that she saw regret flicker across Bellatrix’ features. But it was gone too quickly to be sure. </p><p>Silence stretched between them and it felt uncomfortable. But not as threatening as it should have either, in Hermione’s opinion. Given that she was locked into a tight space with none other than Voldemort’s right hand. No matter if it had been undercover or not, Hermione suspected that playing a role for so long left people unhinged to some extent. Or maybe not unhinged, exactly. But definitely in need of some therapy. Which Hermione doubted Bellatrix was getting. The younger witch let her head fall back against the elevator wall with a sigh. “Know any spells that will get this thing moving again?” Hermione asked.</p><p>“Won’t work. Ministry is a little paranoid about hijacked elevators now. Security wards keep them from being magically manipulated, Granger. Or I already would have gotten us out of here,” Bellatrix replied. </p><p>“Why is this thing failing in the first place?” Hermione closed her eyes. Yule Eve or not, she wanted to be at least in her own bed tonight.</p><p>“Because facility management is sloppy at best, Granger. Minister kindly cut a few jobs and hours here and there. And well, guess everyone is home for the holidays. Which brings me to the question: Why aren’t you?”</p><p>Hermione glanced at the other witch. “None of your business.”</p><p>“Cheerful,” Bellatrix laughed. “I was just attempting small talk, Granger. We might be stuck here for a while. And having you moping around won’t make this any more fun.”</p><p>“I’d think that you prefer silence over having a conversation with a muggleborn,” Hermione replied, sounding quite short. Unconsciously she rubbed her fingers over her forearm, just where she knew her scar was hidden underneath her clothes. Hermione barely stopped herself from cursing when she realized that Bellatrix had noticed. She forced her fingers to stop moving and she tensed.</p><p>“Some scars don’t fade, hm, Granger?” Bellatrix asked and sounded almost smug. Hermione just wanted to punch her in the face.</p><p>“Fuck off,” she snapped instead. Despite her anger Hermione couldn’t help but notice though that Bellatrix was sticking to calling her Granger. Which she had not expected.</p><p>It was thankfully followed by silence and Hermione allowed herself to relax a little again, but then was interrupted by Bellatrix once more just a few minutes later. “I take pride in my house. And my blood.”</p><p>“Good for you,” Hermione grumbled. </p><p>“I'll have you know, if I had wanted you dead, Granger? Then you would be. And if I had truly wanted to torture and break you? Then I would have done that with more than an old little knife. But… I did not think that your scar would be quite that permanent,” Bellatrix explained.</p><p>Hermione looked very much confused. And the longer Bellatrix spoke the more confused she felt. “If that was supposed to be an apology? That was shit,” she deadpanned. Because despite it being awful Hermione still couldn’t shake the feeling that it <em> sounded </em>like an apology. To her surprise Bellatrix laughed and it took Hermione a few seconds to realize that she had joined the laughter herself. </p><p>“I don’t do apologies, Granger. What’s done is done,” Bellatrix added once they had calmed down. “Still, I didn’t think it would be permanent.”</p><p>“I guess I’ll take it,” Hermione snorted. It was more than she ever thought she would get from Bellatrix. “I still can’t believe that I’m gonna spend tonight in an elevator,” she groaned in frustration. </p><p>“What were you planning on doing then?” Bellatrix tried again to keep the conversation flowing. She wasn’t very good with silence. And yelling and screaming was out the question these days. </p><p>Hermione shrugged. “Glass of wine, read a book. Then probably go to bed and come back early into the office.” </p><p>“Somehow I took you for the holiday type, Granger,” Bellatrix commented. “Buying present in July already. Decorating November 1st. Definitely putting up mistletoes.”</p><p>Hermione frowned at the other witch. “You… have given that all disturbingly much thought,” she decided. She used to be that person too. “The war happened,” she simply added in explanation. And Bellatrix seemed to understand since she just nodded. Somehow that caused her to carry on. “Lost my parents. It’s not Yule without them.”</p><p>It was Bellatrix’ turn to frown. “We never found your parents.” They had certainly tried. Bellatrix had kept an eye on that personally. </p><p>“Which was the point. Now I can’t find them either,” Hermione sighed. She didn’t like talking about her parents. Especially not during the holiday season. </p><p>“The ministry must be able to find something on them,” Bellatrix mused.</p><p>“Not enough resources. Two muggles also aren’t exactly a priority. No matter who I am and what my role in the war was. And, I was thorough. I doubt they could find them even if they actually tried,” Hermione replied. “So I don’t push. There would be no point.”</p><p>“Instead you just turn into a workaholic during the holiday season,” Bellatrix nodded. It wasn’t a question, just an observation. </p><p>“Like you, apparently,” Hermione replied and turned her head to look at the other witch. For once she allowed her gaze to linger on the other woman. Not being part of a war and being constantly in hiding or being hunted had done wonders to Black. Her hair was still a mess but it was healthy. She was still pale but not sickeningly so. Her clothes were still all black and leather corset but they weren’t ripped and torn. Her teeth had recovered, too, from serving way too many years in Azkaban just so that her cover wouldn’t be blown. Bellatrix looked younger too. She wondered if it was simply because she looked healthy or if magic had actually helped with that. But be that as it may, Bellatrix was hauntingly beautiful. </p><p>“I’m always a workaholic, Granger. That’s just how I work. How do you think I pulled off being an obsessive fanatic for so long?” Bellatrix replied with a chuckle. “It’s just me.”</p><p>Now that they had started talking Hermione found it difficult to stop. “Why don’t you- I mean… I thought you’d spend Yule with the Malfoys.”</p><p>The laugh that followed by Bellatrix was entirely humorless. “Narcissa has never forgiven me for involving Draco. And I can’t stand to look at her husband for longer than five seconds so… it’s probably for the best that we don’t pretend to be a family over the holidays.” And otherwise no one else was left for her. </p><p>Suddenly Hermione was smirking. “I mean, there is al-”</p><p>“No.” Bellatrix glared at the younger woman. “Don’t you even finish that thought.”</p><p>Hermione snickered and shrugged her shoulders. “It was just an idea.”</p><p>“Why do you think I go by Black again?” Bellatrix huffed. “If I had wanted to keep that useless husband of mine, I also would have kept his name. Besides, he’s in Azkaban. Not my favorite place to hang around for Yule time, I assure you, Granger. So don’t you fucking bring him up.”</p><p>Hermione bit the inside of her cheek and the smirk vanished. “Sorry,” she apologized quietly. Her remark had been more cruel than she had intended. </p><p>With a sigh Bellatrix shrugged. “Don’t worry about it…” she replied quietly. “Besides, pretty sure I don’t even remember the last time I celebrated Yule. So, don’t really have to start with that again now.”</p><p>When silence once again stretched between them Hermione felt more comfortable. Less threatened somehow. And the tight space of the elevator wasn’t feeling all that horrible anymore either. Which was welcomed progress, but definitely confusing and unexpected. “What were you planning to do?” Hermione asked quietly. “I mean, once you were home…”</p><p>“Read another report, probably. Have some firewhiskey. And pass out on the couch.”</p><p>“That sounds as sad as my Yule plans,” Hermione snorted. </p><p>Bellatrix hummed her agreement. She couldn’t deny that it weren’t exactly happy and cozy holiday plans. “You could be spending some holiday cheer with that weasel boy though. Or even Potter. Don’t tell me the golden trio isn’t attached to their hips anymore.” Even without parents Hermmione still had options. Everyone Bella might have wanted to spend the holidays with either was dead, in Azkaban or hated her guts. Or potentially a combination of these things. </p><p>“No… I mean, I <em> could </em>. It’s just… a bit too much.They lost family too, but they still have some left, you know. And I just… don’t really need that,” Hermione replied, shrugging her shoulders once again. Before anything more could be said there was a rumbling sound coming from Hermione’s stomach. She groaned in response. </p><p>“Someone forgot to have dinner,” Bellatrix chuckled and Hermione found that it didn’t sound cruel. Just honestly amused.</p><p>“Maybe….” Hermione sighed and her stomach rumbled quite loudly again. “This is just getting better…” Hermione was about to complain but then there were some Bertie Bott’s Beans in front of her.</p><p>“If you’re feeling adventurous or lucky… I got those. Stole them from Shacklebolt. He wouldn’t stop humming Yule songs and I could hear it for <em> hours </em>. So… that was only fair.”</p><p>Hermione took the box from Bellatrix. “Bellatrix Black… pulling office pranks? On the PM. That’s… nothing I saw coming,” she admitted and without further thought she popped a bean into her mouth. “But also not surprising.” She made a face.</p><p>“What? Vomit?” Bellatrix grinned. </p><p>“Just lemon. Sour,” Hermione replied, still making a face. </p><p>“Lucky,” Bella grinned. “These beans never work in my favour. I’m not going to tempt fate,” she added when Hermione offered the box back to her.</p><p>“You’d rather go hungry?” Hermione asked.</p><p>“I’ve had worse, Granger. I was used to being hungry for years in Azkaban. You have those beans. I’m sure I won’t be the one regretting my choice,” Bellatrix chuckled darkly. “Oh, no. Don’t you dare give me that pity look,” the older witch huffed. “I don’t need that.”</p><p>Hermione felt caught and schooled her features back into a more indifferent expression. “You’re right… Sorry. I mean, I know the feeling, I guess… not wanting the pity.”</p><p>“What I could really use is a drink…” Bellatrix sighed. </p><p>“I’ll get you one. I mean… once we are out of here…” Hermione blurted. “I mean, I could really use one too… might as well have it together then… If you want.” She suddenly felt stupid for even suggesting it.</p><p>“Granger, you don’t wanna be seen with me in public. Just because I’m officially exonerated? Doesn’t mean that the public would agree on that… And you’re the brightest witch of your age, Granger. What would the people think?” Bellatrix chuckled humorlessly.</p><p>Hermione shrugged. “I also have firewhiskey at my place. But I don’t care, really…”</p><p>“Let me get this straight, Granger… first you wanna risk being seen in public with me. And <em> then </em> you suggest that you take me home? I knew you were bolt, but that’s-”</p><p>“You are redeemed, are you not? You’re my colleague. And you try to help find the remaining death eaters. So, you might still be a bitch, but you aren’t evil so… whatever, it was just an idea.” Hermione trailed off as she lost steam. Bringing this up had been a mistake. After all she was nothing more than a mudblood to Black. </p><p>Bellatrix raised an eyebrow at the younger witch. “Are you sure that you’re feeling all right, Granger? I mean,you wouldn’t even talk to me a while ago. Now you wanna share drinks?”</p><p>“You apologized. Sort of. And I don’t know, I wouldn’t mind some company after this crappy end to the day,” Hermione shrugged. “Look, forget I asked, all right?” She just wanted to disappear into the ground.</p><p>“Fine. But you’re buying, Granger,” Bellatrix agreed after a moment. “Or providing the alcohol from your home. I don’t care which.”</p><p>Hermione tried not to look too surprised as she nodded. “Deal,” she replied. “Works for me… but first we need to get out of here… somehow…”</p><p>“It will come back alive eventually, Granger,” Bellatrix told Hermione and her voice sounded almost gentle. Which Hermione didn’t know how to deal with. </p><p>Instead of saying anything Hermione tried another bean and almost gagged. </p><p>Bellatrix grinned. “Vomit?”</p><p>“Vomit,” Hermione confirmed and just barely managed to not spit out the bean. At least she wasn’t feeling hungry anymore now. She put the box of sweets aside. </p><p>“I did warn you, pet,” Bella chuckled.</p><p>“Yeah… you did…” Hermione was still so busy with trying to get rid of the awful taste in her mouth that she entirely missed the nickname. Or insult. Whatever Bellatrix was trying to imply. “Merlin, that was awful.”</p><p>“I don’t know why smart capable witches and wizards insist on eating these,” Bellatrix chuckled. </p><p>Hermione shrugged. “The thrill and adrenaline rush, I guess?” she mused. “I don’t make it a habit. I was just hungry. And tempting fate.” Her stomach was rumbling again but Hermione still felt queasy. She wouldn’t touch those beans again. “Do you think we’re gonna be stuck here all night?” Hermione wondered quietly as her eyes tried to find an exit somewhere in the darkness surrounding them. But there was nothing.</p><p>“Hopefully not. Whatever caused this hiccup will solve itself soon,” Bellatrix tried to reassure the other witch. Usually their elevators were fairly reliable. She had never been stuck in one before. Also had never even heard of it happening. Yet here they were. In a malfunctioning elevator on Yule Eve while they would have both been alone otherwise. </p><p>Hermione tried to get more comfortable on the elevator floor but she gave up with a soft huff. On a whim she decided to reach up and press the button for the atrium again. And just like that the elevator came back to life. The witch’s eyes widened. “Bloody hell…” she breathed. “We’re moving.”</p><p>“I’ve noticed, Granger,” Bellatrix pointed out, clearly amused, while she stood up. “I guess you do have some magic touch.”</p><p>This time they made it to their destination without a hitch. The doors opened revealing the giant but now empty atrium.There were no memos flying around, no cleaning trolleys floating about. No people coming and going via the floo network. It was almost eerie, but Hermione was used to leaving late. They made their way to the nearest fireplace and suddenly Hermione felt rather nervous. “So… are we still on? For that drink?” she asked as she worried her bottom lip.</p><p>“I’m not going to pass up a free drink, pet,” Bellatrix replied, her voice soft despite the smirk she was sporting. </p><p>This time she wasn’t distracted by the taste of vomit. Hermione very much noticed the use of the pet name and for some reason it made her chest tighten. She wasn’t sure if that was a good or bad sensation. It was too confusing. “All right… I’m not sure I’ve got firewhiskey at home, but wine.”</p><p>Bellatrix smiled. “As long as it’s red, pet. That works for me.”</p><p>Hermione nodded and found herself returning the smile. She gave Bellatrix her address before stepping closer to the fireplace. Just when Hermione had grabbed some floopowder and was about to actually step inside the fireplace a hand grabbed her wrist. Turning her head to face Bellatrix Hermione followed the older woman’s finger which was pointing up. Mistletoe. With her heart skipping several beats Hermione’s gaze settled back on Bella’s. “I… I mean, you don’t…”</p><p>“It’s tradition, pet. I’ve always valued tradition,” Bellatrix pointed out amused and leaned closer. When Hermione didn’t pull back she placed a kiss to Hermione’s cheek. Still grinning Bellatrix released Hermione’s wrist. “Right behind you.”</p><p>To her own surprise Hermione felt something like disappointment that it hadn’t been her lips. Which she strongly chose to ignore. The skin where Bella’s lips had touched her cheek was tingling pleasantly. She just managed a small nod, not trusting her voice right away. She needed a few seconds to compose herself as she stepped into the fireplace. Thankfully she managed to say her own address without stuttering. A few seconds later she was at home.</p><p>---</p>
