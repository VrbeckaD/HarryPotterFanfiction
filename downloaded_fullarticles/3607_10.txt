<p><em>Potter had given up rather quickly. After thumping his head against the desk a couple of times, he rested his chin on the wooden surface and settled on watching Draco across him. Draco kept adding notes to his parchment —that should be at least three feet long— and consulted the </em>Moste Potente Potions<em> book every now and then.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>“We’ve been working too hard,” Potter whispered, making Draco look up, bewildered. “We need to relax.” </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“We?” he hissed. “Potter, you only have an inch so far.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Potter seemed to be amused for some reason. He leaned back on his chair, managing to look like he didn't give a crap about correct posture, and smirked. His hair was rumpled like he'd just gotten off of a broom; Merlin, he looked so fucking good.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“I can do much more than an inch, Malfoy.” Potter winked.</em>
