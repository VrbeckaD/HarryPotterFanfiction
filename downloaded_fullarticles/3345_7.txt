    <p>Aurors flitted along the crime scene.</p><p>Robes crimson like fresh blood made his head spin as they all rushed in and out of the home of Heath Cresswell. He and the other Aurors had already set up notice-me-not wards along the premise and made sure that no muggle would come across the field aurors as they investigated the poor lass’ death.</p><p>Wizards, in Corvus’ opinion were a bit boring compared to muggles. Sure, they had magic and all that wonderful bullshit but unlike the muggles, they barely used it outside of its intended use. Muggles, as primitive as they are, exchanged their lack of magic for their fascinating imagination.</p><p>That fact usually makes him frustrated with wizarding kind as he can’t believe <em>those</em> muggles actually had been to the moon and they hadn’t. He was still skeptical about it but it just made Rowan laugh every time he asked about the absurdity of it all and instead chose to remain silent on the issue instead. (He would never forget about that time when he learned the earth was actually a sphere and how Rowan laughed himself sick when he argued that the earth was flat thank you very much)</p><p>But there are times, when he and Rowan were strolling around in Muggle London, his friend dressed in a sweater and <em>jeens</em> while he wore a sleek dark blue muggle suit and matching navy blue crocs (the pinnacle of muggle fashion as Rowan told him), that he was thankful for Wizarding kind’s lack of imagination.</p><p>There were positive things that imagination brought: innovation, inventions and a whole slew of brand new things that made life easier than before (<em>he liked Rowan’s tellyvision and compooter)</em> but there were also negative things. Jack the Killer, The Zodiac Killer, Ted Bundy and Tsutomu Miyazaki, notorious muggle serial killers that honestly made the fine hairs of Corvus’ smooth skin stand up. That was a product of too much of the wrong kind of imagination that he refused to look at any longer than necessary. Not to mention that accursed movie <em>Saw, honestly</em> there must be something in the pipes that made muggles think torture is enjoyable (he was a little skittish after seeing Rowan getting bored by the gore).</p><p>A loud clap brought him out of his stupor.</p><p>“Earth to Corvus?” a voice said. After blinking out of his drifting thoughts, he saw Rowan, in his entire cheeky glory look at him with confusion with his hands now tucked at his pockets.</p><p>“I’m sorry I drifted,”</p><p>“Don’t worry, it was your run-of-the-mill spell gone wrong anyway, they ruled the case as an accident considering that there were no other evidence pointing towards homicide or whatever”, Rowan ran his hand to dark messy locks and then interlocked his other arm around Corvus’ “Come on, old man Kingsley would probably dismiss us after this and let’s leave the boring paper work to the others.”</p><p>Corvus smiled back in response “Don’t want to be stuck in desk duty again?”</p><p>“Hell no!” his companion yelled as Corvus took out his wand (10 ½ inches, Elm, Veela Hair, nice and supple) to clean out Rowan’s ragged appearance. The younger of them just rolled his eyes before taking out his own (12 ¾ inches, Dogwood, Unicorn Tail, extra springy) and asking “You want Indian?” before apparating the both of them away with a large pop.</p><p>As they and the other aurors left the scene, robes as dark as the night began to appear.</p><p>“<em>Iris </em>reporting, Article 45-a56 in command, suspect: VolDeMort, status: affirmative”</p>
