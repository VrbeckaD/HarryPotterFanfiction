    <p align="justify"><br/>It was late August, a few months after the fateful battle of Hogwarts that had finally seen to end Voldemort’s second reign of terror. But unfortunately, things in the Wizarding World were still in complete disarray. The Ministry was one of these things that were deadlocked in political standstill and although she had been invited to go back to Hogwarts for her final year like many other students, this time it was different for her. Harry and Ron had decided that they would take the opportunity and take positions as Aurors as they had been invited to do so. She however had not received an invitation. Probably because she was a female. That her two friends wouldn't have not survived without her guidance was of no interest to the chauvinistic wizarding society. Which was probably for the best as she didn’t want to continue to fight against evil. She was tired of fighting and her regular flashbacks didn't exactly make things easier. She wanted to complete her magical education, making her parents proud even though they would never remember her. She remembered fondly when she had completed her A-Levels earlier in the Muggle world. She was grateful now that they had forced her to do this as it could give her an opportunity to make a life in the Muggle world, but so far, she didn't want to leave the Wizarding world she had worked so hard for and it would be her last resort. But getting her paperwork and copies of her reports would be extremely expensive as she had unfortunately accidentally left them behind when leaving to search for the horcruxes. Money that she didn't have and couldn't borrow from her friends. So, she was stuck.</p><p align="justify">A week ago, she had tried to find her parents again only to discover that they had been on a large plane that had vanished on the way to Australia. The only thing the search parties had found after months had been a few pieces of wreckage. She was responsible for their death! All she had wanted for them was them to be safe and they had died not knowing that they had a daughter. As she had changed their identities, she knew that she would never see anything of an inheritance. It could also make it harder for her to cut through the red tape to get her papers back. She was broke and wouldn’t be able to pay her Hogwarts fee’s that had been introduced for this school year as they needed to restore the Wizarding castle to its former glory.</p><p align="justify">She couldn’t afford going back to Hogwarts and she didn’t want to end up caught in a marriage entirely dependent on Ron. Her boyfriend had suggested that she was brilliant on her own and that she didn’t need to go back to Hogwarts, but she knew that there was still way too much Muggle-born bias and discrimination in the current administration which would make it immensely difficult for her to receive a proper position, get promoted or make a career for herself. Hermione had asked McGonagall if she could skip this year and come back the next year as she was unable to afford the fee at the moment, but her favourite professor had answered that this possibility to come back was only offered this year and that her hands were bound.The ministry made the rules after all.</p><p align="justify">She even propositioned Hermione as a tuition teacher for the younger years in order for Hermione to be able to go to school but had been denied. Hermione had asked for a loan in Gringotts, but the Goblins were still holding a heavy grudge against her for breaking into their vault. So, she had no possibility to get money and she had no collateral to offer them. They had practically tossed her out of their bank a few minutes ago.</p><p align="justify">Harry was renovating Grimmhauld’s place for Ginny and the family he was planning and therefore had also no money to spare. And well, the Weasleys were rich in family members, but unfortunately couldn’t help her either.</p><p align="justify">She sighed and pried herself away from Flourish and Blott’s bookshop. They weren’t hiring either. By now she must have asked for work in every open shop available in Diagon Alley but being a war-hero had its downside. All the vendors didn’t want to risk employing her as people would most likely come to gape at her without buying anything. She sneaked a peak over her shoulder, but again there was nothing. Since coming out from Gringotts she could have sworn that somebody was following her. She shook her head and continued her unsuccessful stroll. She sighed again. After such a long time on the run she couldn't just turn this feeling off. Constant vigilance hat saved their lives quite a few times.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The next morning</p><p align="justify">She was up earlier than usual; Ron’s snoring had been so unbearable that she had decided to sleep on the hard worn out couch downstairs where she could feel every single metal spring. She had then proceeded to complete her daily morning training routine, which she simply couldn’t let go. Even after the war. Flight was something that her body was used to. To relieve Molly who was still mourning her lost son, she had prepared breakfast and was waiting for the rest of the Weasleys to wake up. At least she had the Daily Prophet for herself. She coughed when an advert caught her eye.</p><p align="justify">Drowning in debts? Looking for money? Are you willing to work hard for your money? Then we can help each other. If you are interested sent us an owl and we are looking forward to meeting you soon.</p><p align="justify">Hermione debated with herself. It sounded a bit too good and reminded her of scams she knew from the Muggle World. But she was desperate, and she needed money. With a flick of her wand, she quickly cut the advert out of the paper, wrote a quick letter and sent Erol away with it. If she was lucky she might make this work. "Please don’t be a scam", She pleaded to whatever god or goddess might be out there and continued reading the paper until the sun sent it’s first rays into the room.<br/>The silence was suddenly interrupted with a loud thud that made her jump.<br/>Had erol already returned with a reply? No, it was larger dark owl with bronze eyes carrying the response. That was fast or she had been to immersed in her reading.<br/>Hermione scanned the letter and was relieved that she was invited, and she was told to come to an address in Diagon Alley in the best dress she could find within the next hour. She frowned.<br/>The address was not familiar to her, but she must have gone past it quite a dozen of times, but she had retained no memory about that house. Was it under a Fidelius charm? It was very likely. She jumped. Within the next hour! That was early. Why. She had to get ready. Half an hour later with quite a lot of magic, she had managed to get her rebellious hair under control, had showered and put on the best dress she could find and apparated to that address leaving the confused Weasley clan behind, who woke to find their breakfast ready.</p><p align="justify">Hermione frowned holding her wand at the ready. She was standing in front of a decaying dark house which had an entrance in the basement. Employment agency was standing in red letters on a tacky shield over the entrance. Carefully and verily she climbed down the stairs and knocked on the door with her heart racing. She had a bad feeling about this.<br/>The white door creaked open and… a delicate middle-aged woman in what appeared to be a rather exquisite long dress, that complimented her female curves, opened her.<br/>“Welcome, Miss Granger.” She smiled pleasantly. “We’ve been expecting you. Please come in.”<br/>Hermione carefully shook her hand and stepped over the porch and her jaw dropped. This wasn’t a house in decay. That was a careful magical illusion. She was in a narrow dark entrance hall. It felt ancient.<br/>“Looks can be deceiving. Can they not?” the woman asked cheekily, and Hermione nodded. “They can indeed.”<br/>“May I take your coat?” the woman asked, and Hermione was unsure on how to proceed. She was here for a job interview and yet this woman almost treated her like royalty.<br/>“It’s alright.” The woman laughed. “You’ll get it back later.”<br/>She took the coat and gestured Hermione to follow her. Hermione was still unsure and did until the woman stopped and opened a door gesturing her to get in.<br/>Hermione did and found herself in a large office with murals on the wall that made her blush. The dark-haired female sitting at the impressive mahogany desk certainly didn’t seem to mind seeing depictions of the Dionysian mysteries.<br/>‘I have a bad feeling about this’. Hermione thought again.<br/>“Welcome Ms Granger.” She told her smiling at her. “I must say I was intrigued when you responded to my advert. Please sit down.”<br/>“Thank you.” Hermione answered friendly sitting down opposite the elderly lady, making sure that she was sitting at the edge of her chair and straightening her back. “The advert said that you needed someone who can work hard and that there would be some salary. As I would love to finish my education at Hogwarts, I’m perfectly willing to do hard work.”<br/>The woman leaned back in her chair with a knowing smile. “That is very good to hear, Ms Granger. Do you know what service we are providing?”<br/>“I do not, but I was curious. I mean you are an employment agency, so I assume that people come to you with jobs and ask you if you could provide workers for it.” Hermione told her truthfully. Why isn’t she asking me about qualifications?<br/>The lady smiled. “You are correct. We do provide services, but… “she paused shortly “of a more sensitive nature. You would be a rather good investment into our establishment. Your reputation on your intellect proceeds you, you have natural beauty without any enhancements. Very rare. Although… we would need to work a bit on you beforehand.” Her eyes roamed over Hermione’s body and Hermione’s face fell. What had she gotten herself into? ‘I need to get out of here!’<br/>“We provide pleasurable services for comfortably well-off men in the Wizarding World.” She smiled.<br/>Hermione jumped up in terror. “I shouldn’t have come! I’m not a whore. I’m not that desperate”<br/>The lady huffed. “We are not providing whores. We are providing Escorts who can decide how far they are willing to go. If there is physical interaction their salary is higher of course. Are you sure that you can find another job that pays as well as we do? You may be a war hero, but you are a muggle-born. Our society won’t change anytime soon. Many have tried, none has succeeded. But with the right clients you could have your monthly Hogwarts tuition fees after two evenings.<br/>“I can’t do that!” Hermione protested heavily. Yes, she wanted to go to Hogwarts and that money would be well spent, but she would never be able to look herself in the mirror. “Any chance of a future would be over if somebody discovered that I worked as … as … as… well that.”<br/>The lady rolled her eyes. “Your fear is understandable, but there are contracts that even if somebody recognizes you, they will not able to speak about it. We are protecting ours and of course the clients.”<br/>“But I…I…I wouldn’t know what to do!” Hermione countered.<br/>The lady stood up from her chair contemplating something. “You’re a virgin?” she asked.<br/>“Yes.” Hermione ground out. Ron had tried several times to initiate more physical contact, but she had been too scared and not let him get closer to her.”<br/>“Well, that changes things.” The lady remarked even more enthusiastically.<br/>“In that case, I could offer you something else.” The lady suggested rounding her desk. “You have something that many well-off gentlemen like to have. Something that they are willing to pay quite a lot of money. Once a month we have a festivity in this house and occasionally we do have auctions, but the auction of virginity hasn’t happened in over thirty years. I’m offering you the opportunity to make enough money, not only for one month of tuition, but enough for the whole year and for that you would only have to lie down once with the highest bidder.”<br/>“Will there be protection?” Hermione asked hesitantly. 'You are not actually considering this!?! She mentally shook her head. Well-paying wizarding gentlemen, she wouldn’t be able to go anywhere higher if they knew that she had sold herself to the highest bidder.<br/>“Of course, there will be, and you need not be afraid of being recognized. You’d be wearing a mask. We know how to be confidential.”<br/>Hermione contemplated her chances. She needed that money and she wouldn’t be able to get it elsewhere else.<br/>“Alright. If you can assure me that my identity remains a secret, that there will be protection and that I will get the money after it, then I consider doing it.”<br/>“That’s a wise choice, but not quite that simple.” The lady told her wiggling her finger. “You need to undergo a complete beautification program, meaning manicure, pedicure, hair, stance. Right now you don't walk like a lady. And you’ll need to be here for at least two evenings where you’ll be wearing a mask a beautiful dress and you’ll interact with the bidders. Furthermore, you need to come in for training sessions where we will teach you how to properly please a man and find gratification in your own release. After all the highest bidder should not go disappointed.<br/>Hermione gaped at her. “How are you going to teach me that? Which book would you recommend?”<br/>The lady laughed heartily. “Ah, Miss Granger. You really are a rare gem. Such fine art can’t be learned from books. You’ll watch our professionals, learn from that. Come on. Follow me. I’ll show you.”<br/>She stepped through a hidden door in the tapestry and Hermione followed stumbling behind her through the narrow corridor.<br/>After a few narrow staircases the lady stopped at a mirror and gestured towards it. Hermione almost shrieked. It seemed that there were a few rooms where the dame of the house, she was currently trailing, could watch her clients. In the room to her left she could see a female pressed against the mirror with her glistening body, heaving breasts, while meeting the heated strokes of her loud groaning lover from behind with much enthusiasm. Hermione felt her pants dampen at the sight. The dame of the houses chuckled knowingly glancing at Hermione.<br/>Her leading lady gestured her to follow her and after a few metres she stopped again and gestured to look. Hermione’s breath hitched. There on the bed was a moaning man letting himself be ridden by an ecstatic lover.<br/>“Most of our guests are virile enough to make these unions pleasurable enough. We do have standards as well. Come back this evening and you will begin your beautification and most importantly your training.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Back in her office. She happily put her hands together. Fortuna and Bacchus were smiling down on her. With her new accquisition she would make a fortune if she played it correctly and she knew exactly which clients would be willing to pay a fortune for such an exquisite young virgin, who did not only have a well-trained, toned body, but who also could hold an intelligent conversation. She had been magically scanned when she had entered the building without her knowledge. After all they did have high standards for their clients. Her body was nothing like the weak sickly bodies pure-blood females favoured. If she was lucky, she would profit from her much more than the young lady would anticipate, and she could get their best paying client and silent partner back. He hadn’t been particularly interested in any of the other women, but he did have exquisite tastes and this one he would certainly enjoy.</p>
