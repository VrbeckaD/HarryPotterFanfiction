    <p>You sighed gently sitting in your bed and lifted up your sleep shirt to poke your chub on your stomach and bit your lip. You find out that your a witch, at eleven years old you were very heavy at that age but now at the age of fifteen you had grown into much of the fat and were much more normal however you were still chubby.</p><p>You had the three things to get made fun of, you were Muggleborn, though you were no longer a real poker you were still chubby, and you being a Ravenclaw were a bookworm. You thought knowledge was important, hell all the making fun of people for being a Muggleborn proved it! The wizarding world didn't know anything about the Muggle one so they dind't know about it, ignorance breeds fear, fear breeds hatred, hatred breeds violence.</p><p>The other Ravenclaws didn't think you were smart enough, but you didn't understand how they could do this. Take people that had no idea that magic existed, you always viewed magic as science that we didn't understand yet, but most eleven-year-olds were starting to decide magic didn't exist. Those who knew magic were fine, Muggleborns had eleven years of catch-up to do.</p><p>Not to mention Muggleborns couldn’t' practice magic outside, there was no trace. They put magical monitors on the house, those with other magical people in the household could do magic and it was all on the honor system.</p><p>Besides, no matter how brilliant someone is you wouldn’t drop them off in a brain operating room and expect them to know what to do. As your family brought up, why didn't they have a spell to get rid of your pudge.</p><p>“Name?” You looked up shocked pulling your shirt back down as you saw the silvery blue eyes set in a pale face surrounded by equally pale blonde hair looking at you. “Oh dear, are you feeling bad about your body again?” She asked calmly in the same way she said everything. You sighed and nodded moving your blue and bronze curtains to get dressed glad to see the other two girls were gone.</p><p>“You shouldn't feel bad, your fine just the way you are.” She said as you bit your lip, easy for her to say; she was petite and graceful, slim and beautiful. Not just on the inside but on the outside as well.</p><p>You put on black pants, being sure to make sure your belt was tight, white button up and your tie, along with your vest and clock. You didn't wear skirts anymore as people would run by and lift your skirt to make fun of your panties and if you didn’t wear your belt uncomfortably tight they would pants you. You wore your vest since it was slimming and your cloak so the boys wouldn't smack your bum hard and make fun of how it jiggled slightly.</p><p>“Draco Malfoy likes you, you know.” You look at her shocked and then start laughing, “why are you laughing? Do you not believe me?” Luna asked as you wiped some tears from your eyes, no matter how many times you heard it, it was still hilarious. And painful.</p><p>“I love you Luna, but seriously?” You asked with a slight smile behind your sad eyes, “I am a bookworm, chubby, and a Muggleborn.” You pointed out as she raised a pale brow.</p><p>“He stopped making fun of Hermione when you said something to you and he watches over you, every time someone’s mean to you his fist clench.” Luna pointed out and you smiled at the thought of one of the few who were nice to you, Hermione had done great since Second Year, Hermione's Third, that you finally snapped and told Draco to leave her alone. It shocked you that he did, since then Hermione's been dating Harry and acted much happier.</p><p>You smiled at Luna and waved goodbye. “You really should eat, Name.” She pointed out as you shivered at her knowing tone.</p><p>“I will,” you said and both you and she knew it was hollow she sighed gently.</p><p>“I hope the nargles get Draco to realize soon, or the engrandlesm will take Name away.” She went to speak to the Gray Lady. </p><p>You were walking, the last four days you hadn't eaten anything. You had finally decided to do something about the things that the Gryffindors, Ravenclaws, and Slythernis laugh at you for. You had been holding onto it for years however you had come upon some of your and Luna's friends who were Hufflepuffs and heard them saying you weren't healthy and if you just cut back on food you'd be great. So you did it, the boy who said it was the guy you liked, so you'd become thin for him and then he'd like you, right?</p><p>You were so out of it and so lightheaded from not eating for four days that you didn’t notice Death Eater wannabes coming upon you. Not until they shoved you against the wall anyway, you started your (eye color) eyes widening in fright.</p><p>“Well, well, well, look what we have here~ the fat mudblood bookworm!” One of the men laughed as you pulled out your (wood) and (core) wand. </p><p>“Ah, ah, ah~” another boy cooed with mock affection twisting your wrist forcing you to let it go with a yelp of protest as he threw it away from you and the four boys.</p><p>Unseen to them and you a pair of Italian leather shoes stopped at your wand and bent down as a pale hand casually picked up your wand as a smack rung through the stone hall. Stormy eyes glared at the boys as he walked foreword.</p><p>“Oi you lot! What are you doing?” He asked his face neutral as the boys turned, his gray eyes widened as he saw your (skin color) face as a burning rage took over him at the forming red mark on your cheek.</p><p>“Ah, Malfoy! Just teaching this mudblood a lesson! Fat twat needs to learn her place!” One of the boys laughed as you struggled but flinched when you saw the one that hit you raise it to hit you again. However it never happened. Everyone gasped as you slowly opened one (eye color) orb to squint and gasp seeing Draco holding the boy back.</p><p>“Did you not understand when I said Name was mine?” He asked glaring at the boys who flinched. “No one lays a hand on her!” He growls pulling you from their arms and into his chest as he glared at him. He picked you up bridal style as you let out a “eep!” but he didn't pay attention glaring at the boys who flinched, “I'll deal with you later.” Draco said walking away from them. </p><p>“Are you okay, love?” Draco asked looking down at you as you looked up at him confused, he flinched as his eyes zeroed in on the red mark on your cheek. “I'm sorry I didn't stop them faster.” He apologized holding you tighter, “I promise I'll never let anyone or thing hurt you ever again.” He swore as yo blinked.</p><p>“Why?” You asked as he looked down at you and smiled.</p><p>“Me protecting you is a matter of course, I know you like that Hufflepuff jerk, but perhaps you can care for me in time?” He asked as you looked at him even more shocked.</p><p>“But I'm Muggleborn and Ravenclaw and fat.” </p><p>“Your not fat!” He said shocked stopping to look you in the eye and hold you tighter, cradling you to his chest. “And I don't care who your family is or what House your in,” he confessed blushing darkly. “I promise they won't bully you anymore, I'll make them stop.” He swore.</p><p>“I don't understand, why? Why do you treat me differently from other people, why are you nicer?”</p><p>“Because I'm in love with you and your mine.”</p>
