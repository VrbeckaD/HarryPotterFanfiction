    <p>I close my eyes<br/>
Move slowly through drowning waves<br/>
Going away<br/>
On a strange day<br/>
-The Cure</p><p>*** </p><p>“…freshly cleaned and ready to go.  Yes, yes, you can tell me how much you love me later.  Right now I plan to get so pissed I can’t remember my name.”  Harry grinned at Remus who hitched Teddy up on his hip, then leant in and gave Teddy a wet, loud kiss on his cheek.  “See you next weekend, yeah?”</p><p>“Ba,” Teddy said with all the seriousness of a toddler.</p><p>Harry laughed, then gave Remus a quick side-hug before walking back to the table where his friends were all sat.  It wasn’t entirely comfortable—his group of people were still not overly keen on the idea that Harry and Malfoy were a <i>thing</i> now—even in this Universe they didn’t entirely love Malfoy, even if they’d put up with the Old Harry who was a bit of a twat.  But it felt better than it had in months.  Ron was busy scribbling away on some parchment that Harry was determinedly not asking about.  Ginny was leaning back with her feet in Luna’s lap, enjoying a massage after her game.  Fred was turned round in his chair, whispering something to Angelina who was at another table with a group of other reporters, and George was sat with a half-gone pint, looking only vaguely irritated that his boyfriend was taking so long to arrive.</p><p>Sometimes Harry found himself overwhelmed with the idea that they were all here—just like this.  That he could get into a floo and find himself stood in his parents’ lounge, with photos of himself growing up, with a sibling, with two dads and a mum, with an entire history of growing up and not almost being murdered at every turn.  That his godfather was alive, that his godson had four parents who loved him beyond reason, that every single one of the people Harry had grown up with survived into adulthood—some with spouses and children and mundane careers.</p><p>Sometimes it struck him that the hand on his thigh belonged to Draco Malfoy—Draco, who didn’t have a Dark Mark, who hadn’t ever had to face the worst horrors of the world and himself.  Draco, who had done all of this for <i>him</i>, had re-written the bloody universe.</p><p>It was the most bizarre and dangerous gift anyone had ever given him, and Harry wasn’t quite sure how to live with it, yet.</p><p>But he also wasn’t looking a gift-horse in the mouth.</p><p>He’d been settled in nearly half a year after making his choice not to put things back the way they were.  That the other universe was better off re-written, that no one wanted the burnt-out, hollow shell that had once been.  He could live with his own trauma knowing that no one else had to.</p><p>Well, almost no one.</p><p>He supposed in a morbid way he was grateful at least one other person understood, even if he truly wouldn’t wish that misery on anyone.  Even his worst enemy—who was now one of the people he loved most in the world.</p><p>“Saint Potter,” Fred said when Harry sank back into his chair.</p><p>Harry started a bit in his seat, hearing that phrase in a very different voice.  The way Draco’s hand tightened on his thigh, he wasn’t the only one.  “Shut up,” he said instead of any of that.  He knew they were getting used to him, too, but they were having a far easier time of things than he was most days.</p><p>Fred rolled his eyes, but laughed as he righted himself in his seat and took a long gulp of his pint.  “I just didn’t think we’d ever see the day Potter was kissing a baby.  A werewolf baby, at that.”</p><p>“He’s not a werewolf,” Harry said automatically, then flushed.  “Not that it matters.  He’s cute, and he’s my godson…”  He stopped, because no, Teddy wasn’t.  Not here.  “Or well, god…something.  Whatever.  He’s cute.  Who doesn’t like cute babies?”</p><p>Both Ginny and Draco raised their hands, and Harry reached under the table with his feet and kicked at them both.</p><p>“I’m just saying,” Fred said, shrugging as he finished off his beer, “it’s kind of relaxing that you’re not going to turn into Prat Potter all over again.”</p><p>“God, he was a nightmare,” Ginny muttered.</p><p>There was a collective agreement, which made something inside Harry’s squirm until George’s voice cut through saying, “He wasn’t all bad.  Not…entirely.”  His face was pointed toward the table, his hands moving a little restlessly on his glass, and there was a faint pink under his freckles.</p><p>“You’re biased,” Fred said, as though they had this conversation before.  It was entirely possible they had.</p><p>George shrugged.  “No one’s <i>all</i> bad.”</p><p>Harry had proof that wasn’t true.  He had ardent proof that hit too close to home, and so did the man sat next to him whose grip on his thigh had gone painful.  Harry sighed.  “Well anyway, I like cute babies, and I’m not a prat.  Can we move on?”</p><p>They did, but something about the conversation stuck for Harry, and it went home with him as he and Draco linked hands and apparated away.</p><p>***  </p><p>“Fuck.  Oh my god, I’m going to fucking die.  Merlin, just like that.”  Harry’s head fell backward with a loud thud, his entire body burning hot with flush as Draco attempted to suck his brains out through his dick.  His hips were moving with a rhythm, mostly held in place by Draco’s firm hands, but he could feel himself building, cresting, ready to beg for the orgasm if Malfoy didn’t hurry things along.</p><p>Luckily, Draco seemed to be in a more amiable mood, because he gave a good, long pull with his mouth, suckling at the tip of Harry’s cock, and the shifting of his foreskin was just exactly what he needed to come a long, hot stripe on Draco’s tongue.</p><p>He regained his senses a few moments later, looking down at Draco who was swiping the back of his hand across his mouth.  He was flush-pink, blooming love-bites along his collarbone which would probably fade to nothing by morning.  His own cock sat flaccid between his legs, having been worked up until he came crying Harry’s name in the shower.  They were still a little wet, Harry’s hair a mess—though when was it not—and neither of them bothered with pyjamas.</p><p>Reaching down, Harry yanked Draco up by the hand, pausing to kiss the inside of his wrist before tugging him to the bed.  The sheets were cooler than he liked, but it took no time at all for the pair of them to burrow beneath the duvet.  The fire in the corner of the room was dying down, leaving a faint, orange glow along the walls, and Harry didn’t bother reaching for his wand to get it going again.</p><p>“Malfoy.”</p><p>Draco hummed, rolling slightly to his side, fixing one, grey eye on Harry’s face.</p><p>“When did I start shagging George?”</p><p>Draco sighed, rolling into his back, putting both hands over his face.  “Why?  Didn’t your parents give you all those memories?”</p><p>“Well.”  Harry bit his lip, wanting to reach for Draco, but he could tell by the line of tension in his shoulders, he didn’t want to be touched.  “Yes.  Nearly everyone contributed, and I’m sure the stuff about George is in there, but I’ve…I haven’t…”</p><p>“Not brave enough to look just yet?”  Draco’s smirk was teasing, but there was something in his eyes Harry was unused to.  He couldn’t read it, not quite, but it looked on the edge of insecure, and that was very unlike him.</p><p>“It’s not the same,” Harry said after a long moment, and when Draco made a humming noise, Harry shrugged.  “I mean, it’s their memories, you know?  Biased, from their point of view.  I’ve no idea what the other Harry was thinking…”</p><p>“Other Harry is—was—you,” Draco said, his tone taking on the irritation he always got when Harry tried to separate the two.</p><p>“Well I need to separate it somehow, and trying to work through this bloody, fucking paradox you created is impossible if I don’t think of him as a separate person.”  Harry didn’t mean to sound cross, but he couldn’t help it.  Maybe in five years, maybe in ten, it would all just…be normal.  He’d have a decade of new life lived and all the other stuff from before would start to feel like a bad dream, an ugly fantasy he’d concocted.  But right now it was still too fresh, too real.  There might not have been a scar on his forehead, but the phantom pains hadn’t stopped.</p><p>Draco gave him an unimpressed stare, then said, “Why do you care about it so much?  They’ve all told you what it was like.  I don’t see why you need the details…”</p><p>“Because it’s <i>me</i>,” Harry said, then huffed a quiet breath and pushed himself up to a sit.  He stared down at Malfoy who was determinedly not looking at him, and sighed.  “I have to believe there’s something else there, besides some twat who hated werewolves and thought he was better than everyone.”</p><p>“Why?” Draco pressed.  “Why do you think there would be?”</p><p>“Because there was in you,” Harry said, and he watched as Draco’s eyes went wider.  “There was in you, and I need to…I just want to know that even if I had grown up to be every bit the spoilt little dipshit Snape thought I was, there was still hope there.  Because it…because it <i>is</i> me.  It’s not some evil moustache universe person.”</p><p>Draco’s jaw clenched—Harry could see the way it tensed in his temple—and he breathed out through his nose.  “Well I don’t know what you want me to tell you…”</p><p>“You and I arrived on the same day,” Harry said.</p><p>Realising this wasn’t going to be over quickly or easily, Draco rolled onto his stomach, then propped his head up and stared at Harry flatly.  “Yes.  You know this.”</p><p>“You and I came to on the exact same second, with your mouth round my cock.”</p><p>Draco’s cheeks pinked, but he nodded and didn’t break his gaze.  “Yes.”</p><p>“Then I buggered off and you used the fobwatch and went back to relive most of your childhood,” Harry said.</p><p>“You’re welcome to the same, if you really can’t get over—”</p><p>“That’s not what I’m getting at,” Harry snarked, cutting him off.</p><p>“So get to the fucking point, Potter,” Draco all-but growled back.</p><p>Harry scrubbed his hands over his face, then thumped his head backward against the wall.  “Creating the inevitable loop which would lead to you sucking me off in bed, you clearly had to get to know me.  Old Harry, who would let you suck his cock.”</p><p>“Yes,” Draco said, sounding decidedly less patient.  “Imagine my surprise when it happened, and yet I had to go back in time and ensure we’d have this exact same scenario when I lived that timeline all over again.”</p><p>Harry licked his lips.  “You wanted to, though.  You were already in love with me.”</p><p>“Bloody hell,” Draco hissed, pushing his face into the pillow.  “Yes.  I don’t know what you want from…”</p><p>“Did you like me?  Did other people like me?  Was I the same at all?  Was there something in old me that made you think that all of it would be worth it, or were you just biding your time with some piece of shit until you could have <i>me</i> me back.  What…sort of person was I that George Weasley would defend me, even still?  Would want to shag me?  I know he’s got no shortage of people who want him so…”</p><p>Draco licked his lips, then said, “You weren’t all bad, no.  Okay?  Is that good enough?  Can I please sleep now?”</p><p>Harry realised this conversation was getting nowhere fast.  Getting Malfoy to talk about feelings, or anything about what he’d done or how he’d lived his childhood a second time, was like getting blood from a stone.  And Harry didn’t have the strength for it.  But he also knew he wasn’t going to be okay just letting it go.  He was too invested in himself, which was strange, but he supposed in this situation, also totally normal.</p><p>***  </p><p>“Seriously, I know you have a job.  I know for a fact you’re flying again.”  George leant over his desk, hands clasped under his chin, eyebrows high into his hairline.  “Why are you here?  Is this some stalker thing?  Is <i>good</i> Harry also a stalker?”</p><p>“Shut up,” Harry groused, petting a pygmy puff which was perched on his shoulder.  It made a strange, trilling noise and nuzzled against his neck.  “I can’t believe you lot still invented these things.”</p><p>“Invented is such a strong word,” George said.  He reached for a stack of papers on his desk, pulling them close and running his hands over the braille at the top.  “I actually do have work so…”</p><p>“Was I always an arsehole?” Harry blurted.  He felt bad when George’s hands stilled, and he put the back under his chin with a small sigh.  “Sorry I…I just.  I need to know.”</p><p>“I gave you all the memories I had, Potter,” George said carefully.  “Your dad said he could sort them so they wouldn’t be wonky when you dove in, so if there’s a problem, take it up with him.”</p><p>“No I…I haven’t…”  Harry swallowed, then set the puff down on the small table next to him.  “I haven’t gone in.”</p><p>“Why not?” George asked, sounding genuinely curious.  “You’ve been obsessing about this since you got here.”</p><p>“Yeah I…”  Harry dragged a hand down over his mouth with a tiny groan.  “I know.  It just seems like I won’t learn what I need to know if I do that.  I’ll only learn what everyone else knew.”</p><p>“Isn’t that the point?  Jesus, Harry, did your head get knocked round when you were falling into this world or…”</p><p>“It’s me.  I mean, I’m me.  I mean,” Harry stopped with a groan.  “The universe was re-written.  Erased and re-written, and I know it’s a fucking paradox, but it’s still me.”</p><p>After a long pause, George stood up, came round the desk, and walked toward Harry.  His hand out, he found the chair next to Harry’s and sat, turning his face, his expression a mask of patience which was strange to see on one of the twins.  “What are you asking me, exactly?”</p><p>“You cared about him,” Harry said, soft and a little bit miserable.  “About me.  Who I was before I…erm.  Took over.  You did, right?  You always say he wasn’t all bad, but no one’s been able to actually offer me any proof of that, and I think I know I would have at least had the <i>chance</i> of turning out alright in the end.  Because it’s still me.”  Harry let out a trembling breath.  “I need to know that I’m not just a nice person because I was tortured by a megalomaniac from age eleven.”</p><p>George’s expression shifted into something considering, also something Harry was unused to seeing, but maybe it was because in his old life, he hadn’t spent enough time with Fred and George to truly know them.  Enough to care, of course.  Of course he cared, but to know them?</p><p>“I loved him,” George said after a while, and those words shook Harry to his core.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“I loved him,” George repeated.  “I loved pieces of him that he only showed me, pieces of him that were…they were real, but they weren’t all of him, and I’m not sure that it would ever be enough for him to overcome all that other shit, to make him what other people might consider a decent wizard, but he wasn’t all bad.  No one’s all bad.”</p><p>“Some people are,” Harry said, his voice tight.</p><p>George sighed.  “You’d know better than I would.”</p><p>Harry bit back his retort, because it wasn’t fair that this George didn’t know that first hand.  This George still had every member of his family alive and well, and Harry wouldn’t trade that for anything.</p><p>“It’s not enough to satisfy, is it?” George asked.</p><p>Harry shrugged.  “I don’t know.”</p><p>With a tiny laugh, George sat back, crossing his arms.  “You’re still you, and I know you’re lying.”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes, then told George he was doing it, feeling better when he made George laugh.  “I don’t know what to do about it, is the problem.  I know what I chose, but I hate having this entire, other life I know nothing about apart from fragments of memories people offered up like some kind of sacrifice.”  Harry bit his lip.  “Draco keeps telling me I can use the fobwatch to go back, to relive it, but I’d be doing that as myself.  And I…I’ve taken enough away from everyone by staying.  I can’t take that too.”</p><p>“From what I understand,” George said, his tone careful, “if you’d undone all of it, we’d just go back to that other place.  Where half the people we loved were dead.”</p><p>“Reckon so,” Harry said, though he knew that perfectly well.  “I still don’t think I can re-write any more of this reality.”</p><p>“I’d appreciate it if you didn’t,” George said mildly.  “The Harry I loved is gone, but I lost him a long time ago, anyway.  If I ever had him at all.  But he meant something to me and I’d…like to keep it.”</p><p>Harry licked his lips, then said, “How are things going with Lee?”</p><p>After a moment, George laughed.  “We’re done then?”</p><p>“For now,” Harry admitted.</p><p>“Then why don’t you fuck off and let me get back to work?  Why not pester your dads?  I’m willing to bet they have a better solution to this whole mess than I do.”</p><p>***  </p><p>The moment Harry stepped out of the fireplace and into the cottage, he realised even if his parents didn’t know what to do about his problem, it was a good place to go.  It was strange that this had become a sort of touchstone for him—people he’d never known, had fantasised about growing up, and had somehow turned out even better.  Or maybe he was biased now that he could reach out and pull them close any time he wanted.</p><p>Weeks after choosing to stay, Harry finally got to meet his mother, and it was somehow better and worse than he’d anticipated.  She’d never been close with him, and she seemed fairly uncertain how to go forward with a kid who had never really given a shit about her before, who now wanted to spend every waking moment making up for so fucking many years of believing her to be dead.</p><p>But she was Lily, and she loved him, and she understood.  She’d held it together when James had told her everything, but that night Harry had come halfway down the stairs to hear her crying, and James trying to soothe her.</p><p>“I knew it.  I knew they’d…fucking hell, James.  They didn’t even do it in this life, and I still want to go murder them for what they put him through.  How do I live with that?”</p><p>“You can’t punish someone for something they never did,” James said quietly.  “But all the same, it’s been a near thing when I think about it some nights.  But he’s here and he’s safe.  He can get better.”</p><p>“Does it ever stop feeling strange?” she asked softly, her voice still thick with emotion.</p><p>James just sighed and said, “I don’t think so.  But I suppose all we can do is give it time.”</p><p>It hadn’t felt like they regretted Harry’s choice, but all the same he couldn’t shake the feeling that he’d robbed them of their child.  And had robbed himself of a chance to be better, all on his own merits.  That would never happen—he’d come to accept that, but he needed to know he could have.  He needed to know something.  That he was more than just…someone who would have easily—too easily—become a Death Eater. </p><p>A Dark Lord.</p><p>He shuddered, but squared his shoulders and walked into the kitchen where he saw Regulus at the table reading the Prophet, and James at the sink waving his wand toward where the dishes were washing up.</p><p>“We weren’t expecting you,” Regulus said mildly.</p><p>Harry rubbed his hand through his hair.  “Ah.  Yeah, I know.  I erm.  I had a question.  Problem.  Er…”</p><p>James turned to him, a brow quirked, and Harry wondered if he’d ever get tired of noticing how similar they were, how <i>alive</i> they were.  “Is this an alternate universe problem?”</p><p>“Oh my god,” Harry groaned, mostly because it was—in a way—and he wondered if they’d ever get to a point where he could walk in with a normal person problem.</p><p>“It is though, isn’t it?” James pressed.</p><p>“He’s bored,” Regulus said simply.  “His cases have all been boring since he solved the mystery of the sodding universe.”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes, then plonked into a seat near Regulus whilst James got some tea ready.  “It’s more of a personal thing, I guess.  About erm…my memories.”</p><p>The masala chai was rich, spicy, and perfect, and Harry basked in the taste of it as James took a seat and set out a bowl of a strange, puffy sort of sweet.</p><p>“Is something faulty with the pensive?  I can have a look if you…”</p><p>“That’s not entirely it,” Harry said, then rubbed the back of his neck.  “It’s not…”  He wasn’t entirely sure how to explain.  “I was hoping there might be a way for me to experience it.  The memories.  Not just watch, but feel them, you know?  Without having to use that horrifying fobwatch and relive my teenage years.”</p><p>James smirked a little, shaking his head.  “Merlin forbid.  But Haz, I’m not sure that’s something you can do.  That’s not how memories work.”</p><p>“I know,” Harry said with a dejected sigh.  “I know, I just…thought I’d ask.”</p><p>Regulus set the paper down and gave him a considering look.  “Why?”</p><p>Harry blinked owlishly.  “Why what?”</p><p>“Why do you want to experience them?  Why is watching not enough?”</p><p>“Regs,” James said tiredly, but Harry held out a hand.</p><p>“No, it’s fine.  If I’m being honest, I feel this sort of compulsion to know what it was like, to sort of live it, without having to change it.  It’s still me, right?  The spell re-wrote my memories, forced me to retain them from another life, but this is still me.  And I want to see that I had…hope, I guess?  That it wasn’t just torture that made me sympathetic.”</p><p>James and Regulus exchanged a look, then Regulus sat back and crossed his arms.  “I have a potion that might help with that.  It’s…tricky.  There are risks…”</p><p>“No,” James said pointedly.</p><p>Harry glowered at him.  “That’s not exactly your choice to make.  And I don’t want to relive everything, if that helps.”</p><p>“It does,” Regulus said slowly.  “It’ll only sustain a few anyway, without the risk of you going comatose.  You’ll have to choose what’s most important.”</p><p>Harry gnawed on his bottom lip, letting a sigh out through his nose, and ignored the glare James was giving him.  “How many?”</p><p>“Four, maybe five,” Regulus said.  “Nothing longer than a full day.”</p><p>Harry ruffled his hair again, then nodded.  “Alright.”</p><p>“No,” James said.  “Look, I love you Harry, I really do, but I’m not sure I trust you to not go too far if you get caught up.”</p><p>“So you can supervise,” Harry said plainly.  “But I don’t think I can keep living like this if I don’t have some idea of who I was before all this.  You don’t…you’ve no idea what it’s like to live with this horrific person you used to be hanging over your head.  Every time you lot look at me, I can’t help but wonder…”  He trailed off, because it was too much for words, really.</p><p>James’ face softened.  “Four.  And a half day each.  That’s my compromise.”  When Harry opened his mouth to argue, James cut him off.  “No.  I’m sorry, but I won’t risk it, I won’t risk you.  All of that before—it was already so much.  You have to work with us, too, here.”</p><p>Regulus nodded.  “I’m sorry, but I agree with him.”</p><p>Harry’s shoulders slumped, but he supposed that four half-day memories would suffice, so long as he chose well.  “Give me a week,” he said.  “I need to sort through them, decide what I want to know most.  What would…what would help most.”</p><p>James and Regulus both nodded, then James said, “Is there any way we can help?”</p><p>Harry’s brain was already whirring through what he wanted to know, what he thought was most important.  When his dad spoke, he glanced up.  “When did it start with Malfoy?  And when did it end with George?”</p><p>The pair of them looked startled, but James shrugged and said, “I think it was round the same time.  You and Malfoy became closer near the end of your seventh year.  We thought maybe you and George were going to become a thing, but about six months into your first quidditch season, he ended things.”</p><p>“And then Malfoy…”</p><p>“Seemed to be a bit of an open secret,” James said.  “You never came right out and said it.  We sort of assumed you were having an affair, and that’s why you two split up.”</p><p>“Alright,” Harry said, very quiet.  “I need to go home and have a long think.  But I…thank you.”</p><p>“Whatever we can do,” Regulus said, sounding very sincere.  “I can’t imagine what this is like, and I won’t put you in danger again, but this little bit…”</p><p>“It’s enough,” Harry said, and looked him in the eye to show him that he was telling the truth.</p><p>It wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t everything, but it was enough.</p>
