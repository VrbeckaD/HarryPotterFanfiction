    <p>A pallid grey fog hung over the city of London the morning of September 1, 2017.  It was an oppressive, heavy collection of clouds that sucked the life out everything and chilled its victims to the bone. The people on the pavement of England's capital acknowledged this in their own way, keeping their heads down low and feet moving forward.  Overcast skies were a common occurrence in England, once earning a cheap laugh if anyone mentioned it on the tube, but now, a pity smile would be hard won.  There had not been a sunny day in a month and though the general population fretfully blamed the changing climate, there were always a few people who would look up to the sky, see ripped black cloaks above them, and know the root of their misfortune.</p><p>        Brightness was found exclusively indoors during such times.  In Kings Cross Station for example, people walked with heads raised, a destination in mind.  Among the crowd of nameless faces in the station that morning were three people bunched close together around a trolley.  A man, a woman, and a little girl all standing in front of a wall between platforms 9 and 10.  Shivering, the girl wrapped a blue jumper tight around her body, her eyes furtive and tired.  Her name was Emma Aspen.</p><p>        The man, her father Thomas Aspen, smiled encouragingly at his child.  “Ready to go through?” </p><p>        Emma didn’t nod enthusiastically at the question like her dad did many years ago.  She was leaving her family to stay at a place much worse than home.  Hogwarts was never something to be excited about.  You never came out the same.</p><p>        Instead, Emma shrugged and grabbed the handles of her trolley.  She stared at her cat, Patches that rested in a carrier on top of all the luggage.  Patches stared back, his tail swaying in curiosity.  </p><p>        Mr. Aspen and the woman, her mother Monica, grabbed the trolley as well.  None of the muggles around them paid much attention, so the family charged at the wall in front of them.</p><p>        They passed easily through the wall, and Emma opened her eyes after a moment, being greeted with the scarlet engine of the Hogwarts express.  It glimmered brightly in the light of the station, steam billowing out of the smokestack.</p><p>        Mr. Aspen placed a hand on Emma's shoulder.  She looked up to see her father's arm stretched out wide like a showman, presenting the platform to her.</p><p>        “Quite the sight isn’t it?  I remember my first time seeing it.”  He laughed heartily, glancing at Emma from the corner of his eye, but she didn’t look any cheerier. </p><p>        Mr. Aspen may have been presenting Emma the picturesque train, but all Emma could see were the numerous cloaked figures moving about the platform, some young, some old, some scared, some indignant, and some with an exposed left forearm.   These people, the ones with a cut left sleeve, moved differently than the rest of the crowd.  Their noses were upturned.  They glared at any child they didn’t like the look of.  Their arm was always turned outward, revealing a distinctive black mark staining their skin.   </p><p>        Important Death Eaters would never be assigned such menial tasks as patrolling the Hogwarts Express, but every true follower of the Dark Lord had to start somewhere.  High ranking or not, Emma felt a stab of fear at the sight of them.</p><p>        One of these figures sent a suspicious glance to Emma.  A weak smile immediately appeared.  “It’s great Dad.” </p><p>        Mr. Aspen nodded in approval.</p><p>        Mrs. Aspen sighed and dabbed her eyes.  One look at her daughter, and she burst into tears.   In between blubbering, Mrs. Aspen knelt down and choked out, “You’re going to do great Sweetie okay?”</p><p>        Emma bobbed her head up and down, her smile becoming more genuine as she clumsily wiped her mother's tears with the tip of her sleeve.</p><p>        Mrs. Aspen laughed a little and properly dried her eyes.  “And we know what how you’re going to ask the hat for right?”</p><p>        ‘Ravenclaw’ Emma mouthed with a nervous giggle.  Emma was grateful she had the chance to be placed in a house like Ravenclaw.  Ten or so years ago, Hogwarts flew only under the banner of Salazar Slytherin, but this method of schooling had proved to be problematic.  Rebellious minds could easily slip through the cracks when there was no classification among students.  So sorting was brought back by the Dark Lord's decree.  It was an easy way to weed out his best and worst.  Slytherins, cream of the crop; Hufflepuffs, moldable minds; Ravenclaws, useful for administration; and Gryffindor… no one wanted to be a Gryffindor.</p><p>        Her mother grasped Emma's hands and giggled along quietly.  She softly kissed her child’s forehead.  “Be safe.” </p><p>        “Yes ma'am,” Emma whispered back, her eyes shut as she longingly savored this moment with her family.  Mrs. Aspen stood up and held her daughter’s right hand.  Mr. Aspen took hold of the left.  They awkwardly drove the trolley to the train, never relinquishing their grips.  Mr. Aspen loaded Emma’s trunk onto the train.  He reached under his glasses quickly and rubbed his eyes.</p><p>        Mr. Aspen picked up his little wisp of a girl and hugged her tightly like it would be possible to transfer some of his strength to her.  “Love you.”</p><p>        “Love you too Daddy.”</p><p>        Still holding her, Mr. Aspen placed Emma in the train’s doorway.</p><p>        The train whistled with a piercing sound signaling it’s departure.  Mr. and Mrs. Aspen stood back from the track reluctantly, heads swimming with things they wished they could tell their daughter, but Emma waved goodbye before they could try. She stepped deeper inside the train car and closed the door, watching her parents grow smaller through the tiny window. A hollow feeling was left when they disappeared.  Emma's parents couldn’t protect her anymore.  She was alone.</p><p>        With a heavy sigh, Emma picked up her equally heavy trunk and dragged it behind her, searching for a good compartment to sit in.  Surprisingly, the first few ones were quite empty, but the reason became apparent soon.  A sign in the corner of these first few windows read purebloods only.  What constituted a pureblood had been blurred as the Dark Lord needed more and more followers, but it was apparent when you weren’t considered one.  Emma continued down the line without a second though.  </p><p>        Emma passed by each compartment, hoping to find one that was completely empty.  She had never discussed this with her parents, but Emma was determined to remain friendless during her time at Hogwarts.  Friends were a liability.  They could betray each other or even worse, be unable to protect each other.  If Emma only watched her own back, it would be easy to slip through the years.</p><p>        Eventually the compartments ran out, and Emma was left with a compartment holding only one person in it.  A boy with a pale face and parted blonde hair.  His head was tilted downwards, so he did not notice Emma watching him.  He had on dark luxury robes, complete with a golden clasp at his throat.  For a moment, Emma wondered if he might be a pureblood, but she dismissed the idea quickly.  No pureblood would risk fraternizing with an unknown halfblood.</p><p>        Emma peered inside for a few more moments, watching until Patches gave an imptatient meow.  She glanced back at the cat and then at her surroundings.  Patches meowed again.</p><p>         “Hey, I’m thinking,” Emma said.  Patches merely flicked his ear.</p><p>        There were other compartments with only one or two people, but Emma could not think of any reason why to go back to them.. She put a hand on the door to the compartment and pulled it open.<br/>
        The boy slowly lifted his head, grey eyes meeting Emma's own.</p><p>        “May I sit here?” Emma asked.</p><p>        The boy shrugged.  “I guess.” </p><p>        Emma tried to heave her trunk and cat inside quickly to not cause any trouble, but failed miserably with the heavy luggage.  She heard a noise a bit like a cough behind her as she worked to lift the luggage onto her seat and turned around to see the boy fighting smile.</p><p>        “Were you laughing at me?” Emma inquired.</p><p>        The boy was still fighting his battle and settled for a nod. </p><p>        She didn’t know how to respond.  The desire or ability for snide remarks were not something that came naturally to her. “Oh.”</p><p>        Emma wavered there for a moment, wondering if she was supposed to say something else, but she drew away from the idea at the boy's expectant expression.  She went back to attempting to lift her truck.  It was a struggle not to betray that she was slowly withering inside as the boy watched. </p><p>        “Would you like some help?” the boy asked after a while.</p><p>        Emma let out a breath as she stopped tugging on the luggage.  Sheepishly, she admitted, “Yes.”  </p><p>        The boy stood up and grabbed one corner on the trunk.  “On the count of three, okay?  One, two, three.” They both lifted and the trunk was seated nicely.  Emma leaned down to pick up Patches' cage and let him out. </p><p>        “Allergic?” She asked as Patches settled in Emma’s lap.  The boy shook his head.</p><p>        Emma stroked the cat’s tail as he purred.  “Thanks for helping me.”  </p><p>        “Your welcome.” He smiled out of politeness and went back to staring out the window.</p><p>        “I’m Emma.” Emma blinked, cringing inwardly at herself.  The boy seemed tolerable enough, sure, but he didn't want to talk.  And Emma supposedly didn't want to make anyone's acquaintance. </p><p>        The boy looked back.  “I’m Scorpius.”</p><p>        A strange name.  “That’s a nice name.”</p><p>        The smirk returned.  “No it’s not.  You can just say so if you want.”</p><p>        Emma shook her head and looked away from him.  “That would be rude.”</p><p>        She could feel his eyes.  “I can take a joke you know.  Not like I’m going to run and tell on you for thinking my name’s a bit odd.”</p><p>        That’s the first time I’ve ever heard that, Emma thought sharply in her head.  “I’ll keep that in mind.”</p><p>        Scorpius waited for her to say something else, but he finally accepted her silence with an annoyed grunt, muttering a couple things under his breath.  One sounded distinctly like halfbloods and Emma shifted nervously in her seat.  </p><p>        Later on, an older student ducked in wearing his robes and a shiny green prefect badge.  “Get dressed.  We’re arriving soon,” he said roughly.  Emma quickly dug into her bag for her robes to change into at once, but Scorpius didn’t seem to move much.  His eyes stayed glued outside the window.</p><p>        “Didn’t you hear me?  You need to get dressed,” He spoke with exasperation as if he was too good to be ordering around some stupid first years.  Scorpius nodded slowly, but the prefect didn’t move.  “Hey wait…”  The blond boy winced.</p><p>        The prefect stepped into the compartment.  “What are you doing outside of the pureblood section, Malfoy?  And associating with a halfblood no less.” </p><p>         Emma’s blood ran cold.  She had been talking to a Malfoy.  She had been talking to a Malfoy like he was a normal person.  And she had laughed at his name.  Emma looked at her feet, wishing she could melt into her seat.</p><p>        “I didn’t want to sit with anyone else.  She just happened to sit as well,” Scorpius spoke about her with a tone he hadn’t used before, like she was some gormless creature stuck to the bottom of his shoe.</p><p>        “Then you could have made her leave.  Are you forgetting who you are?” The prefect demanded.</p><p>        Scorpius shook his head.  “No.”</p><p>        “Well then kick her out.”</p><p>        He spoke without emotion. </p><p>        “Leave.”  Emma quickly packed her things and heaved her trunk back off the seat.  Patches padded around her feet as the two walked out together and the purebloods stayed.  Just her luck to have something like that happen before her first day at Hogwarts!</p><p>        Emma walked a few feet past the compartment and then stopped.  She had no idea where she could go.  After that humiliating display, Emma was not keen to invade anyone else’s space.  Of course, loitering in the hallway for that perfect to see her sounded worse.  As she was thinking, Patches began to wander down the hallway.</p><p>        “Pa- oh, never mind.”  Emma followed her cat; there was nothing better to do.  Some way further down the aisle, Emma found the bathroom.  She called for Patches and went inside.  The prefect did say it was time to change after all.</p><p>        After changing, Emma camped out on a seat in one of the stalls.  Patches leaped onto Emma’s lap, still purring and rubbing around for a scratch behind the ears.  Emma mindlessly obliged, her mind running over what had happened earlier.  Only an imbecile wouldn’t have noticed that Scorpius Malfoy was a pure blood.  Thinking back, everything about him screamed it.  Although he did treat Emma strangely normal considering that he knew her blood.  It was not incredibly friendly, but cordial.  More than Emma had learned to expect.  Emma thought and Patches sat there until the train’s whistle blew and came to a halt.</p><p> </p><p>---------------------------<br/>
