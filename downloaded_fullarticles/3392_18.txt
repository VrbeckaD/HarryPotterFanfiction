    <p>"Hey, Draco?'</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"I, um, have this weird fantasy, and well, I was wondering if we could, ya know..."</p>
<p>"Role play in bed?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, if, um, that's something you'd be cool with.  I mean, you don't have to agree or anything, 'cause no pressure whatsoever, but if you wouldn't be opposed–"</p>
<p>"Harry," Draco cut off his rambling, "I am interested.  Now what were you thinking?  A bit of bondage?  Wax play?  Some spanking?  I'll consider anything but blood play."</p>
<p>Harry blushed at his boyfriend's bluntness.</p>
<p>"Um, yeah, blood play is a hard no for me too.  It's more a scenario, with some dominance elements.  So what if you are this powerful prince, and I am this lowly peasant the king has had brought to his son's room, there to serve you for an evening, not entirely of my own free will.  Sometimes, when I imagine this, the prince is gentle, and caring, getting me to actively enjoy it.  Others he is demanding, forcing my pleasure from me as he takes his own."</p>
<p>Draco reached out and put his hand on Harry's arm, stroking it reassuringly.</p>
<p>"Darling, I think that sounds like it could be fun.  We just need to make sure we both know what each other's boundaries are, right?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded, and so Draco continued.</p>
<p>"Right.  So, I'm not sure how comfortable I am even pretending to take you unwillingly, at the moment.  Maybe we discuss that again some time later, yeah?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, okay."</p>
<p>Draco smiled at this, drawing Harry into his arms.  He rested his chin on his boyfriend's shoulder, enjoying the physical contact.  Harry always felt so awkward talking about these things – sex, kinks, fantasies – but after months of Draco's calm, reassuring patience and presence Harry felt secure and loved and ready to share this with his lover.</p>
