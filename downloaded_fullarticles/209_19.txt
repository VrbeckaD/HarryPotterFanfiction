</p><p>“Remus? Remus Lupin, could that be you?”</p><p>A slightly frazzled, disheveled man turned around. His hair hung in front of his eyes, almost meeting the small mustache he seemed to be trying to grow. The top buttons of his patterned shirt were undone, and the sleeves were rolled sloppily up to his elbows. He held a mug in his hand full of steaming tea, by the smell of it something fruity, and quickly surveyed the woman calling out his name.</p><p>The woman confidently strolled up, still bundled up from the cold winter morning outside. She took off her earmuffs and let them hang around her neck. Her brown hair was cropped tightly around and over her ears, but her long bangs fell loosely on her forehead. She had been out for the day, whether it had been business or a social call Remus did not know, but her deep brown eyes were sparkling. Paired with the glint from the silver hoop in her nose and her dangling amber earrings, she was radiating. The woman did feel that way, stumbling upon an old acquaintance like this – <em>here</em> of all places.</p><p>“Remus Lupin, what in Heaven’s name are you doing at this old place?” She laughed, but taking a step forward, she lowered her voice, “In a <em>Muggle</em> coffee shop of all places?”</p><p>A coy smile danced on her lips as she looked up, without raising her head, at the tall, still gangly man who now stood just feet away from her. Remus was silent. He was not keen on embracing strangers into his life. These were dangerous times and, he especially, needed to have his wits about him. The woman who was so near him stunned him. Perhaps because they were in, as she said, a Muggle coffee shop, she allowed herself to be more joking. So rarely now was that met without suspicion in his reality, in the shops he frequented during his school days or even within the very gates of that school.</p><p>The woman straightened and hastily unwound her bulky scarf that entombed her up to her nose. He could see her now. They bore similar scars. Remus’ was entirely more evident; plastered across his face from eyebrow to below his lip, it was a reminder of what afflicted him. Hers, although not entirely out of sight, only revealed themselves if she wanted them to. Four trailing scars made their way down the side of her face, the longest beginning at the end of her brow, down her cheek, and cut through her ear. Unbeknownst to everyday winter passerby’s, underneath the bundle of winter attire to protect against the nipping cold, a collection of scars continued their way across and around her torso.</p><p>“Lee,” Remus breathed.</p><p>She smirked, “Took you long enough.”</p><p>Remus was still in a mild shock, but Lee was already whipping about the shop, tossing her scarf and jacket onto a nearby bench.</p><p>“Listen, are you in a hurry? I’d love to catch up. I’m in town for a little while and wouldn’t have even known where to begin in searching for you. It’s quite a task to find one of us, eh? I’ll go run and get myself a drink. Be back in a jiff.”</p><p>And with that she swiftly turned towards the cashier, making light, yet animated conversation with the worker as she perused the baked goods options. Remus was still standing, steaming mug in hand when she came back. Her face fell.</p><p>“I’m sorry mate. I must have given you quite a scare,” she said remorsefully, “I’ll send you an owl, we can meet up another time.”</p><p>“No!” Remus immediately regretted how forceful he sounded.</p><p>However, Lee lit up, “Perfect. Pop a squat, my love.”</p><p>Lee was not sure herself where this confidence and casual nature manifested itself from, but she felt at ease with Remus. It had been years since her parents whisked her away from Britain and together transplanted their lives into Canada. Within 36 hours, her nine-year-old life was upturned after that fateful night and as it goes, nine-year-olds are not very good at keeping in contact. Now, it had been more than ten years and she had finally made it back to the island.</p><p>She nestled herself onto the bench and Remus slowly sat down on the opposite side of the table in a cushioned wooden chair. This coffee shop was quite quaint. Brightly lit only due to the uncharacteristically sunny day outside, but otherwise, candles dotted the tables and only one low-burning light hung from the center of the shop.</p><p>“Lee, what are you doing here?” Remus said although he did not know whether his tone was grave or happy. Yet before Lee could respond, he continued, “Merlin, how long has it been? I didn’t recognize you - where did your crooked teeth go? And your long hair, when did you hack all that off? You have no idea how awful we felt – Merlin, how awful <em>I</em> felt when you left. My parents were beside themselves, but me? I was so scared as to how I was going to face school without – ”</p><p>“Here you go, love,” interrupted the server, placing Lee’s cranberry tea and scone in front of her, “Be careful, it’s hot.”</p><p>“If you’ll be at my aide when I burn myself, I’ll take my chances,” Lee smirked as she cupped the mug in her hands. The young server stifled a smile and tucked her hair behind her ear, before scurrying away to hide her blush. Remus watched the interaction, impressed. He remembered his closest childhood friend in a much different light than what she presented now. He remembered exactly what it felt like to feel so helpless as he watched her go through the worst moment of her life. Her worst moment quickly replaced his, and he had felt burdened by it ever since. Remus wished to make it right, even at his young age, but when he set out to do so, Lee and her family had already gone far, far away.</p><p>“Remmy, er – Remus,” Lee stumbled over her words, and carefully made sure to continue sounding light-hearted, “It’s absolutely insane that we’ve stumbled upon each other like this.”</p><p>Remus slumped down into his seat, not necessarily disappointed, but suddenly overwhelmed.</p><p>“You survived, didn’t you?” Lee gave a small smile and reached to pat his hand but stopped herself. Uneasiness crept up inside her, “Well more than survived, you look absolutely phenomenal! Who can I accredit this marvelous upbringing to? How are your parents?”</p><p>Remus’ gaze dropped into his mug, “They’ve passed on. Mum went two years ago, and I don’t think Dad could quite cope without her and he died just a few months ago.”</p><p>“Remus, I’m so sorry.”</p><p>This time Lee took his hand, but Remus was the one to disengage. He became unexpectantly angry with Lee. His logic told him it was irrational to be angry at her for bringing up his dead parents, how could she have known anyway? But that didn’t quell the emotion churning in his stomach.</p><p>“What happened to you, Lee?” Remus met Lee’s eyes, pleadingly, “And why are you suddenly back?”</p><p>“We had to leave, Remus. My mum knew how difficult it would be for me – ” she caught herself, “How difficult it would be for <em>us</em> if we had stayed. Britain is terribly backward on this sort of thing, you know firsthand. Having to be registered, numbered, and practically watched our entire lives, nothing of the sort happens in Canada. I was lucky my parents had contacted over there and so the second I could sit up after that night, we left.”</p><p>Remus mulled this over, “I’m being terribly silly if I’m expecting you to apologize on account of what happened when we were <em>nine</em>. It’s not like we had any autonomy over our lives.”</p><p>Lee smiled, “Rightfully so. If we had any autonomy over our lives at that age, the whole country would be up in flames!”</p><p>“But,” Remus began, something still wasn’t sitting right with him, “what possessed you to come back? I’m sure you know how times are now – it’s not the safest time to be taking a holiday in the wizarding world of Britain.”</p><p>This made Lee’s heart jump. She truly hadn’t expected to run into anyone she knew and had not had enough time to cultivate an appropriate backstory. And Remus is… well, Remus. He knows her family. But truthfully, how much does she know about him? Twelve years changes a person and it would be foolish of her to assume he’d stayed the same little boy he once was. Timid and afraid to step out of line, preoccupied and never having a full night’s rest.</p><p>“I’m here on official business,” she deviated, taking a long sip of her tea. Remus squinted, the excitement of reacquaintance was fading. Lee was a stranger. Where did her loyalties lie? Did her loyalties lie anywhere? How involved was Canada in this whole debacle?</p><p>“I work for the Canadian Ministry and have been sent over to gauge the situation. There have been stirrings on our side of the pond too, you know,” She further explained, but Lee could see that Remus was not satisfied, “I work in our equivalent of the Department of International Magical Cooperation.”</p><p>Finally, Remus relaxed. She was glad as she didn’t know how much fuel she had left in her.</p><p>Remus leaned forward, and inquired quietly, “They let you hold power in your Ministry, even with your status?”</p><p>“Of course, Remus! Like I said, the discrimination here doesn’t exist over there. Now I just don’t go parading around telling everyone my status, but systematically, it’s not a problem,” Lee said with a small smile, “But if it makes you feel any better, they had me start out in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.”</p><p>Remus snorted, “Oh Merlin, how subtle of them.”</p><p>Lee was glad he was joking with her. She took a big gulp of her tea and a huge bite out of her otherwise untouched scone as she stood up.</p><p>“Remmy, I’m frightfully sorry, I have a meeting I have to run to,” she said hurriedly, as she began the laborious task of dressing herself again for the tundra outdoors, “But please, <em>please </em>we must see each other.”</p><p>“O-Of course,” Remus found himself saying, “I should actually dash, too. Where are you walking to?”</p><p>Lee chuckled, “To a nearby alley and then I’ll be off. I’ll write you an owl when I’m done.”</p><p>Remus stood up and gulped down his tea as Lee continued, “Listen Remmy, it was amazing to see you. Don’t be a stranger, okay?”</p><p>She took a step towards Remus, “I want to pick your brain about something not appropriate for our whereabouts now, understand?”</p><p>Remus nodded, he wondered what her meeting was about. With whom? Was it with the Ministry or some intelligence operation? He had this nagging feeling but could not describe it. He wanted to trust Lee, but the current state of affairs was making it difficult for him to do so.</p><p>“Alright, love, I’ll be off. I’ll see you around, eh?” Lee said her goodbyes and pivoted on her heel to walk out of the shop. She gave one final wave, in her mittened hand, to Remus before leaving and disappearing around the corner. Remus sat back down with a long sigh, but glancing at the clock on the wall, sprang back up to his feet. The Order was waiting.</p>
