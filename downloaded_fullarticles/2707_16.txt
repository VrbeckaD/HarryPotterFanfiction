<hr/><p><strong>Chapter 01:</strong> Chuken</p><p> </p><p>Blood…</p><p> </p><p>Debris…</p><p> </p><p>Limbs torn from bodies…</p><p> </p><p>People slowly dying…</p><p> </p><p>Houses burning all around if they were not torn a thunder…</p><p>This is what is left of the village known as Emut, a small village named after a king that long since passed. A distant roar echoed throughout the village to signify its pain and anger. Pain from the attacks from the remaining warriors and anger over that this village dare defy him. A loud slam of its massive claws shook the ground to cause more of the buildings to collapse. Screams were too heard in the distance until they were finally silenced. In a shrine somewhat off the path of the village a shrine maiden was praying to a statue of great water sprite Izurou. Hoping to have someone would come and save this poor sea fairing village. Her constant prayers seem to have been answered when another pained roar was heard in the distance. Along with the dying sizzle of the fires being extinguished by a wave of sea water as it traveled through a good portion of the village.</p><p>The maiden rushed out of the shrine in time to see a giant Merkin come out of the dark sea that was previously lit up by the glow of fire. This male was the most beautiful thing she ever seen in her short life. Even though he was of the sea, the merman attacked the giant land beast with numerous water attacks. The warriors attacking it legs with promises in their mind that the spirit would deal with it in a final blow if they took out the large fleshy stumps. The beast roared again before summoning a large amount of flames in its mouth to send the large fireball towards the fish man. A stream of water took out the flaming ball so the Merkin could send another behind it to freeze the legs. The warriors ran away so they would not be caught in the crossfire. Making a large spear of ice the merman pulled back then sent the spear flying through the air. It skewed the beast through the side of the beast chest before the elemental effect took place. Freezing the dragon like creature inside as well out. Taking one of the large boulders that littered the beach the merman threw it at the frozen beast. Making the four legged fiend shatter into pieces in order to make sure it won’t rise up and attack again. Using more of the seawater he snuffed out the remaining fire to leave place of darkness until small torches were lit by the surviving villagers. Each and every one them made their way to sea to actually see if their tormentor was truly gone from their lives. Having been sieged upon year after year when a sacrifice was not made by their forefathers. It had gotten worst when they started to worship the young half Esperian, Daedra and Adrea. Stepping up the mighty spirit the Maiden spoke up, “Oh, mighty Lord Esper, I thank thee for listening to my prayers and defeating this unholy beast. What tribute do you wish of us to grant follower of Izurou.”</p><p>The merman grinned at the potential prize. Wanting something the women back at home won’t grant him since he was not powerful enough. The merman magick swirled all around the large being to transform him into his humanoid form in the surf. Going up to the shrine maiden to claim his reward, “Easy my young maiden, my reward for this endeavor shall be you.”</p><p>“I am, milord?”</p><p>“Yes, you are going to be my reward in the most grand of ways my black haired beauty. You shall carry my child and raise her until it is time to claim her to become a spirit like myself,” he confirmed as he grabbed her to press him against his body. She seem to blush at the thought of being with this esper but it was one of the jobs to be one of the many virgins for the spirts. But here one of very being she was to serve wanting her to bare his child. What right did she have to refuse him especially when the spirit just saved them from the beast that plagued them for such a long time? They also did not another powerful being because she deny this being his reward.</p><p>“I will do it, but you must not come after this village if you did not get what you want,” she said while glared at the man before her. The Merkin grinned a vicious smile as he liked this woman nature to protect her kin. He hugged her tighter and took every bit of her scent for he knew she would be a good mother to the child he wanted.</p><p>“Fine, you got until tomorrow night to get a spot ready in the temple. I will be waiting in the sea until then,” with that the merman used the sea to teleport him into deeper regions to hunt.</p>
<hr/><p>Since that day on the beach, ten months had quickly passed once the pregnancy was confirmed by the Esper and birth. Now this beautiful child was one month old and the man has yet to come collect this little girl. Something she wished the man would do as soon as possible because for some reason she could not bring herself to love this child. Let alone raise her to take her place as the new shrine maiden when the time comes. A small light hope still glimmer in the maiden heart that feel would change someday before she was force to give up the girl.</p>
<hr/><p>The years seem to bleed together when they passed. The shrine maiden had raised this girl for eight summers and had come to call her Chuken. During the years she had been teaching the child the ways of being a priestess of a temple belonging to an Esperian along with sacrifices that had to be done for them. Even though this girl was her child, the shrine maiden had come to hate the little black haired girl with every fiber of her body. All because she was force to birth and raise this girl with no clear view of her ever leaving while man around the area seem to treat the girl as a god. A god she was not for she was born from the flesh of a human woman.</p><p>Even though the girl did not show it to her many fearful followers, the shrine maiden had been abusing her more and more since the time she could walk. The shrine maiden had been hitting her daughter whenever she made a mistake with the duties that was being taught to her in the temple. This treatment only got worse when her powers seem to activate not too long ago. Having found out she was able to control the water when she and her mother was collecting the fungus that clung to the rocks next to the sea. Even with all of this it did not stop Chuken from loving her mother even said person hated her for no reason.</p>
<hr/><p>Four more years had passed with the seeds of discontent had grown. The people of the villagers now gave Chuken tributes out of fear instead of the previous love they held for her. They fear that she would act like the beast that use to attack them so many years ago. Instead, she was one to be afraid as she walked the roads of the village to see the growing hatred of her in the eyes of the people. Chuken knew she would have to leave this place soon before they took action. This why each time she went to the village in the past week she would by potions, food and other supplies to store away in a hidden place in the shrine. Tomorrow was the day she was going to leave for one of the major cities on the coast. Hopefully she could hide in the crowds there with the hope the people would remain none the wiser about her. At least make it to an orc stronghold since they worship the Daedra there.</p><p>Right now the most important thing was the collection of fungus that clung to the rocks here. This would make the much needed health potions needed for her journey having found that it was cheaper to make them. Chuken basket was halfway full when she heard the distance sounds of people talking loudly in a group. It sounded like one of the mobs that usually clung around the shrine to give tribute to see if would do anything if Chuken would do anything if she finds it’s unbecoming. The only time she found it truly disgusting was the fact last year they kidnapped a girl from a village a few miles in land to give it to her. She had taken the fearful girl and made her into another shrine maiden in order to protect her from these people. During that year the both of them formed a sisterly bond and she tried to save her many times from her mother abuse.</p><p>Chuken spotted her mother standing there with a group of people behind her when she gazed up at the sand embankment. In the shrine maiden hand was a torch while the other held a head detached from the body. Fear and horror quickly formed onto Chuken face when she realized who the decapitated head belong to. It was the girl who she viewed a sister figure. That woman was her light and happiness in the world. Maybe even more if there was time but it looks like it finally had ended for the both of them.</p><p>“Get her!” the shrine maiden yelled to the group. After years of polluting the minds of these fouls the maiden was finally able to convince the people to attack her child out of fear. It helped that girl was able to use to a small amount of her power to help make the people even more fearful of what they don’t understand. The girl ran into the sea in the hopes they won’t go in the area where she seem to be even more powerful. It was proven futile as a crude spear struck her from behind. Impaling her through the chest as shock took over. Collapsing in the surf as she felt herself slowly die as her garbs was soaked in her own blood and the lapping water belonging to the sea. She could not believe her mother would so easily betray her for no reason at all. Yes, she knew these people was going to stab her in the back someday but not her mother leading the charge. Salty tears made their way down her cheeks to only be washed away by the sea. She silently started to pray to the Esper Izurou to help her. Help her defend herself against these vile creatures as she could hear them get closer. Chuken prayed to him to get revenge for both her and her sister.</p><p>Those prays seem to be answered as a large glowing rune expanded out. Making the villagers back up in fear of what was happening. All the while the bright turquoise rune seem to get the people to fixate on it in a trance like state as it swirled around for a moment or to. Equations and words were written in an unknown ancient dialect as circles and arches formed to make the seals into one massive piece of art for the girl. One that was unique to only her and can be used by those she trusted. Everything seem to stop for brief moment until the insignia shattered like glass and float in the air in its broken state. Chuken was floated up into the air by magick until she was above the broken pieces. The rune then went about stabbing her through multiple points of her body until started to seep into her. Making her glow the same color to the point it started to shift her body around. Having it transformed to the form of a Merkin much like her fathers.</p><p align="left">The glow soon faded away to show that she now took on her true rank as an Esper. For floating above the frighten villagers was a giant Merkin child they were about to kill. Now their nightmares were truly going to be granted because of their own folly. She looked down at them with a great amount of anger. These people betrayal was soon rewarded by a giant wave she summoned from the grey sea to drown them on the beach. This water had an added bonus of freezing everyone solid in the position of running away or being swept away. Taking her massive tail, Chuken quickly went over the beach to smash all of their bodies to the point they were crushed. Looking over the now empty village for a few moment to contemplate of what should be done with the place. Reaching a decision, she went about destroying everything for it no longer held the right to be remembered by anyone. The only building left standing when she went into the ocean to leave was the temple she grew up in. For, it was that very shrine that gave her existence in this world<strong>.</strong></p>
<hr/><p>A couple of decades past since she destroyed her village. She took that time to wreck more places and learn many things when she could. It was during this time that a priest of an Adera had summoned an esper that commanded lightening to defeat her. Which proven to have worked in away when it realized she was kin. The fellow female Esperian took Chuken away into the realm of their kin to finally rest with hope to stop her attack against mankind. It was in this realm she found her father with a wife and many children. That truly angered her for her dead mother told her that he would come get when the time came. In Pulse Grandeur, she found out that this man forgot she even existed or that he mated a maiden of Izurou many years back. Chuken then decided she would never deal her father ever again. Something she stayed true on till this day no matter how many times he tried to speak with her.</p>
