</p><p>Scorpius Malfoy sat on the kitchen counter, his legs swinging gently as he watched Draco, his father, brew a new batch of Pepper-Up Potion. He was already in the second stage of the process, stirring 4 times in a clockwise direction, and reaching for the dropper which held 5 drops of Salamander blood to add, before stirring again. Draco had promised Sorpius he could help out with potions brewing over the summer to earn extra allowance, but he had to watch a batch of each one being made before he was allowed to start. </p><p> </p><p>Hogwarts wouldn’t allow him to make these kinds of potions until his fourth year, and, at 12 years old, Scorpius had only just finished his first year. However, his father had always been willing to teach him about anything he showed an interest in, even if it was ahead of the school curriculum. Since Scorpius had an interest in potions and earning enough money for the newest Nimbus broom before 2nd year, this was a perfect arrangement. </p><p> </p><p>As Draco was adding the last ingredient, 4 Fire seeds, the doorbell chimed. Their house had two entrances, one Muggle and one Wizarding. The Wizarding side on the North only had a door knocker, so they knew someone was awaiting response on the South side of the house that faced Muggle London. Scorpius glanced at his father who gave him a nod and said, “Go ahead, I need to take this off the heat and wash my hands.” </p><p> </p><p>The boy hopped off the counter and turned down the hallway leading to the door. He could hear a man’s voice on the other side as he said, “Joanna we talked about this, I know what I’m doing. I should have tried talking to him years ago.”</p><p> </p><p>Scorpius opened the door to find a large man hurriedly ending the conversation and stuffing his cell phone into his back pocket. He was broad shouldered with large everything, thick legs, thick arms and a stomach that wasn’t quite obese, but was nothing close to flat. The man looked a bit confused before he offered a polite smile and said, “Hi, I’m looking for Harry Potter.” </p><p> </p><p>Scorpius didn’t even blink before he gave his usual reply, “He’s not here.” He didn’t care that Harry was in the upstairs study. This reply was the same thing he said to everyone, regardless of Harry’s presence in the house. Draco and Harry had been together since Scorpius was three years old. At six, he had used his birthday to ask for them to be a real family and Harry had bought their house the next day, followed by a wedding in the gardens of Malfoy Manor 8 months later. With the six years that followed, Scorpius was well practiced at rebuffing the Harry Potter fans who came sniffing around. </p><p> </p><p>The man at the door frowned, then cocked his head, trying to see into the house. “Are you sure? It’s really important that I speak with him,” he said, fishing for something in his pocket. He pulled out a piece of paper and attempted to hand it over to Scorpius, who made no moves to take it. The man’s eyes narrowed ever so slightly, “He sent this to me,” he said, his tone becoming less friendly.  </p><p> </p><p>Scorpius looked down, recognizing Harry’s terrible handwriting, and saw that it was his address. At the bottom, Harry had signed his name. “Well look at that,” he said, letting a slight sneer show on his lips, “you already have his autograph.” He looked up, letting his grey eyes harden, “Enjoy your evening,” he said, unpleasantly, and started to close the door. </p><p> </p><p>The man reached out and put his hand against the door to stop it from closing. “Not so fast,” he all but growled the words. “Look,” he said, and waved to the car. “My daughter just got a letter from Hogwarts and we need to talk to Harry about it.” </p><p> </p><p>Scorpius leaned around to watch the girl come up the sidewalk from their car. She was lovely, with long red hair falling past her shoulders onto a teal dress that was cinched at the waist. Scorpius eyed her with obvious appreciation before looking back at the man in front of him with a patented Malfoy smirk. “There’s no way that girl came from your genes,” he said. </p><p> </p><p>Something in the man seemed to snap and he stepped closer to the doorway “You disrespectful little brat-”</p><p> </p><p>A full smile bloomed on Scorpius’ face as he cut him off, saying, “Oh, you definitely shouldn’t talk to me like that.” He stepped back feeling his father come up beside him, and watched as Draco put his wand to the man’s throat. </p><p> </p><p>“Time for you to leave.” Draco said, pressing his wand forward until the man had taken a few steps back. </p><p> </p><p>"My name is Dudley," he said, throwing his hands up in an attempt at surrender. "I'm Harry Potter's cousin."</p><p> </p><p>The girl from the car had finally reached them, "Dad, what's going on?" she asked.</p><p> </p><p>Dudley put a hand down to keep her behind him, still looking at Draco, "I can prove it, let me show you my phone."</p><p> </p><p>Eyeing the girl, Draco nodded once and let Dudley reach for his phone. He watched as the man's chubby fingers flew across the screen. A crash came from above them, followed by the unmistakable sound of Harry thrashing towards the stairs and then down them. </p><p> </p><p>Harry reached the door in record time with a breathless, "Hey, Dudley," as he gently pulled Draco back by the waist. </p><p> </p><p>Draco allowed himself to be pulled back, sheathing his wand, and fixing Dudley with a disgusted sneer, "If I'd known it was you I wouldn't have bothered with the wand. I would have just hit you." </p><p> </p><p>Scorpius chuckled but quickly turned it into a cough when he got <em> the look </em> from Harry. He was pretty confident that Harry had paid Molly Weasley to teach him that look. </p><p> </p><p>"Dudley," Harry said, obviously uncomfortable, "you should have called first. It would have made this," he gave a hesitant smile, "better."</p><p> </p><p>"Sorry Harry, I didn't," he chanced a glance at Scorpius, "I wasn't trying to make trouble." He moved to the side, "Harry, this is my daughter, Astrid. She recently received a very important letter."</p><p> </p><p>“Hello,” she said. </p><p> </p><p>When the girl stepped up to Harry to shake his hand, Scorpius got a good look at her eyes. They were dual colored, one green and one blue, but more than that, they were curious. Intensely curious. He watched as she looked briefly up to Harry's face, then let her eyes flutter around, taking in as much information as she could before the handshake was over. In her left hand she was holding a Hogwarts letter, which she offered to Harry. </p><p> </p><p>Harry read the letter with a frown on his face, "I see," he said, looking at his cousin, "and now you need my help?" </p><p> </p><p>Dudley gave a helpless shrug, "I was hoping-" </p><p> </p><p>"Uncle Harry," Astrid's voice was sweeter than it had been before, she was looking up at him with large innocent eyes. Scorpius' focus sharpened at the change as he watched her take Dudley's hand. "My Dad told me that you would know what to do. Will you please just answer a few of my questions? I'd be willing to offer something in trade. I am quite good at chores." At the end she flashed Harry the most earnest smile that Scorpius had ever seen, with the obvious exception of Harry's own smiles. </p><p> </p><p>Scorpius cocked an eyebrow at the performance and looked over at his father, who was wearing the exact same expression. They exchanged a quick glance before looking at Harry, who had pretty much melted. </p><p> </p><p><em> Almost a Slytherin my ass, I'm sure the hat said hufflepuff, </em>Scorpius thought. </p><p> </p><p>"Why don't you both come in for a cuppa?" Harry said. As the two of them walked through the door, Astrid met Scorpius' eye and her earnest smile morphed into a wry grin. </p><p> </p><p>Draco nudged his shoulder as they watched the group of three head to the kitchen. "Think we should keep her?" </p><p> </p><p>Scorpius felt his neck crack with the speed he jerked it to look up at his father, "Can we do that?" </p><p> </p><p>"Probably. At least on weekends."</p><p> </p><p>"Well," Scorpius replied, trying to give off an heir of nonchalance, "it's good for us to be charitable. She is magical, after all. We should help." </p><p> </p><p>His father chuckled. "You're not fooling me with that," he said, ruffling his son's hair. "Go practice manipulation tactics on the guests."</p><p> </p><p>Scorpius pulled away quickly, glaring at Draco in false annoyance and smoothing his hair back into place. "Malfoy's don't look a fright when there's company, Father," he drawled in perfect imitation of his grandfather. </p><p> </p><p>Draco gave an exaggerated shudder. "It concerns me how easily you are able to imitate him," he said as they walked towards the parlor. </p>
