    <p>It’s a grey and rainy day, which Harry supposes is rather fitting, all things considered. Ron doesn’t want to come with him to the library, mutters angrily about how it’s absolutely horrible to make them write an assignment for History of Magic class as soon as the semester starts, and more importantly, when their best friend is in the hospital wing. Harry leaves the common room mid-rant, not because he doesn’t completely agree, but because he knows, deep down, that Hermione would kill them both if she knew they were slacking of school work for her sake.</p><p>So he sits down, slumps down rather, at a table in the back of the library. It’s the table where one of the legs sometimes decides it doesn’t want to be there anymore, and at some point during the next hours the whole table might collapse and spew Harry’s work all over the floor. Hermione hates the table, hates something cluttering or messing up her work and books, and the thought sends Harry’s thoughts sprawling downwards.</p><p>It’s in moment like these where Harry is as scared of the situation he’s in, the role he plays in it all, as he should be. Things never seem too horrible or scary, until something horrible or scary happens to one of his friends. This nasty, sinking feeling in his chest reminds him of a year ago, seeing Ron’s lifeless body hit the floor when he sacrificed himself, in the chessboard chamber when they were trying to retrieve the philosopher’s stone. Remembers the noise, the terrible, nasty noise, of the Queen putting him out of the game. Remembers his own heart stopped beating, if only for seconds, and Hermione’s horrible scream ringing in his ears. And now Hermione, brilliant and bright, is laying in a hospital bed, where’s she’s been since Christmas break, all because of Harry. He thinks, a little stubbornly, that it should have been him, both times, <em>always</em>, because <em>it isn’t the same when it’s him</em>, it doesn’t matter as much. Moreover, somewhere, deep down, a dark and self-deprecating place, he thinks that if he hadn’t come with Hagrid, all those months ago, to Hogwarts, his friends probably wouldn’t have suffered, at all.</p><p>The assignment is 500 words on magical structures, with a focus on magical housing, and Harry’s so bored by his third page of his ‘History of Magic’ book that he kind of wishes for the table to fall apart under him, only for a distraction. Hermione always goes on about how important it is for him to read, this book especially, because he didn’t grow up in a magical family and needs as much help as he can to get by in his classes. But it doesn’t help much, really, because there’s so many words and names and historical moments Harry has never heard of before, that he can’t quite keep up with what the book is trying to tell him about repairing spells and house personalities. It all seems like a rather big bunch of rubbish, Harry thinks. Like something wizards might tell their younger sibling, right before they start their first year, just so they’ll make a fool out of themselves telling their new friends about fucking house personalities, and bonds between homeowner and the structure.</p><p>No one’s around to hear him, muttering mid-yawn, “I would kill for the chance to just Google all of this”.</p><p>There’s a sudden noise from the row of bookcases to Harry’s left, and it startles him, and the table, which loses its leg before Harry can even register what’s happening, and he buckles over, with his books, onto the floor. His chin hits the floor so hard, he’s afraid his teeth may shatter, but they don’t, thank heavens. Groaning, he tries to pick himself up, only to find that the person, the one who made this all happen, is helping him. His knee hurts a little, and he may have chipped a tooth, but otherwise he feels fine, and is just about to tell the person just that, when he’s pushed away by a repulsed looking Malfoy. </p><p>“Ugh, Potter! I did <em>not</em> know it was you…” He says, because he’s an absolute git, and can’t just be relatively ok person for two seconds, “If I knew I wouldn’t have –“ His eyes, gray and cold, narrow at Harry for a long moment, as if saying ‘this never happened, I never helped you. Tell anyone and you’re the next victim’ and it reminds Harry of everything.</p><p>He growls at Malfoy, something he only seems to do at Malfoy anyways, and goes to gather up his things and walk away.</p><p>“What’s the matter Potter?” Malfoy’s a big pretentious git, and still hasn’t left when Harry stands up again, his hands full of books and parchment, “Oh, what? You haven’t got your helpful mudblood side-kick with you, so this assignment’s got your panties in a knot?” As soon the words leave his mouth, something falls over his face, and his stance goes a little lopsided, but Harry’s too angry to register it, doesn’t even start to think of what it might mean.</p><p>Of course Malfoy would make fun of the fact that Hermione, whom he’ll take any chance to call a mudblood since they got back to school this year, is in the hospital wing, near death. Harry knows, deep down, that she’s not near death, only petrified, but some irrational scared part of him wonders if, maybe, she is dying, maybe she will die. Malfoy is so evil, and some part of Harry still thinks he might be the one who opened the chamber, even though they ruled him out of their list of suspects weeks ago.</p><p>Harry’s just about to slam his shoulder into Draco’s on his way past him, even though Malfoy showed up after summer break about a head taller than Harry, when Malfoy stops him, grabs his elbow in a harsh grip, teeth gritted as he says, “Potter, I – I didn’t think … I didn’t really think that sentence through.” And Harry almost forgets to breathe for a few seconds, because is Malfoy apologizing? He is. And not only is he apologizing, <em>to Harry</em>, but for saying something horrible about Hermione, <em>who’s muggle born</em>, and this might be the best moment of Harry’s <em>entire life</em>.</p><p>Malfoy, who must see the look on Harry’s face, grimaces, “Sod off, Potter!” He always spits Harry’s name out, as if it physically hurts him to say it, as if it is nothing he wants more than to get rid of it. And Harry, who feels like all he really has left of his father, except the impossible hair, and his deep reddish skin color, is his last name, hates the way Malfoy says it. “I still hate you, and Granger, and the ginger annoyance you call your best friend. I just meant… Oh, I don’t know what I meant! That it’s not really something to use against you, is it?” He sneers, because he’s Malfoy, and he can’t, for the sake of his pureblood-pride, let Harry know that maybe he finds this whole ‘heir of Slytherin’ thing a little scarier the more it continues, just like everyone else at school.</p><p>Harry doesn’t really know how to respond to that, because no, it really isn’t, but it's Malfoy, and what are you supposed to say to that, when it comes from Malfoy? He’s standing very close to him, and Malfoy is still holding his elbow in a death grip, and Harry’s not sure if he’s aware of that or not, if its intentional. There’s a wild look to his eyes, and for the first time since Harry’s known him, he looks his age. Twelve, and maybe a little scared, and trying too hard to be like his father. And Harry, who’s tired and upset, and has had to grow up too fast, lets his guard down, doesn’t feel like fighting with him right now. So he says nothing, just nods his head, stiffly, and softly rips his arm out of Draco’s hold. “Er, ok, Malfoy.” He says, with no certain sound to it, and starts to walk away.</p><p>“Potter...” Malfoy’s saying it differently, all of a sudden. Harry’s not sure if it’s a good different, it’s no longer a spit of letters, but it makes him twist around to look at him so fast he feels like his neck snaps. It’s slow and irritated, but most of all it sounds exhausted. Malfoy looks it too, and a little embarrassed, maybe. “I could… Oh, I can’t quite believe I’m saying this!” He throws his hands in the air, and Harry finds it a little dramatic, even for a Slytherin, “But! If you promise to never mention it again and never bother me again,” Harry wants to interrupt him to point out that Harry hadn’t done anything of such, and maybe to punch him a little, “I’ll… Ugh, I cannot believe it… I’ll help you! Ok!”</p><p>Harry, who raises his eyebrows so far up it gives him an immediate headache, doesn’t have time to ask the hundreds of questions that pop into his head at this, “With the assignment, you wanker… Oh Merlin's beard, Potter! Magical housing!” Malfoy’s voice is so high pitched, it rings in Harry’s ears, and he’s waving his arms around frantically, and Harry wonders why Pince hasn’t come to yell at them yet. “The rest, all of it, you can bloody well handle on your own, can’t you.”</p><p>And that’s how it happens. They sit, at different table because Malfoy makes such a fuss about it, and calls Harry stupid using about fifteen different words for sitting at that table in the first place, and start working. Harry doesn’t know why he takes Malfoy up on the offer, really. Maybe he’s desperate to finish it, or maybe he feels like he owes it to Hermione to get a good grade on this assignment, since it’s his fault she’ll die, maybe. They don’t exchange a single word for the first thirty minutes, and Harry knows it’s been exactly that amount of time because a panicked voice in the back of his head keeps counting. Then, when Harry cannot possibly handle it anymore, and has half the mind to just get up and leave without a word, Malfoy looks at him. Without turning his head, his eyes turn to look at Harry, and Harry doesn’t dare to turn his head either, isn’t sure he should.</p><p>“So…” Malfoy sounds like he’s forcing the word out, and it’s almost worse than when he’s spitting out Harry’s last name. “What is that thing you mentioned earlier? I bet it’s a muggle thing, since I’ve never heard the name before in my life, but what is it and why is it so great you would ‘kill for it’? What could possibly be so great that the brave, Harry Potter, the boy who lived, would do such a crime? It would land you quite some time in Azkaban you know, murder, and I can’t quite imagine what muggle invention would be worth all of that.”</p><p>Harry wonders, for a few seconds, if Malfoy ever is able to speak without babbling, and then wonders if Malfoy has noticed that Harry hasn’t done any of the speaking tonight.</p><p>“Er, what?” Is all he really is able to say, and when Malfoy turns to him with a bewildered expression, it pushes him to continue, maybe just to escape the possibility of even more babbling, “Google?”</p><p>Malfoy shuts his mouth into a tight line and nods his head, and it’s the first time, Harry thinks, he’s shut, ever, probably.</p><p>“It’s… Do you know what a computer is?” Harry knows the answer before he even asks, really, but asks it anyways.</p><p>“No, please tell me, oh great Potter, what a computer is!” </p><p>Harry doesn’t even bother to roll his eyes, or mention the fact that Malfoy mispronounced the word, just sighs and tries to think of a way to explain this all to a boy who, in muggle terms, grew up quite Amish, “It’s a muggle machine, which they mostly use for… typing? I guess. And Google is this application on it, on the internet, which… I’m not even going to go into, so don’t ask! You use Google to search for stuff, anything… And it’s like… A bunch of books squeezed into these machines, but you don’t have to read it all because you can just search for the exact thing you are looking for!” Harry’s voice goes a little hoarse by the end, and he realizes how little he’s been using it these past hours. He’s pretty content with his answer, and how impressive it all sounds, but when he looks at Malfoy, he thinks maybe not. Malfoys brows are furrowed, his mouth turned down at the corners (and Harry, for some reason he can’t quite pinpoint, becomes very, horribly, aware of how pink Malfoy’s lips are against his pale skin), and he’s looking at Harry as if he is the biggest piece of dirt on his windscreen.</p><p>“Potter…” He sighs, “Potter, we have spells for that… To find the exact book you need or the exact word in a book or subject or… Potter how are you passing your classes?” And for a second there, Malfoy sounds almost… Sad for him? Fond? But no that can’t be right.</p><p>Malfoy shows him then, the spellwork that works, pretty much, as Google does, and Harry is rather impressed by the way Malfoy just flicks his wand so effortlessly, barely needs to mutter the word to make the spell work. Harry’s always thought magic is stunning, the light and the effect, the way people do it so differently, the way different people’s magic feels different. However, watching Malfoy do it, so breathlessly, effortlessly, makes Harry’s toes tingle, and he’s not quite sure he likes it. Malfoy finds the exact information Harry needs in ‘History of Magic’, and they go back into, quite comfortable, if Harry must admit, silence.</p><p>It doesn’t take him too long to read through, and by the end he’s rather… flabbergasted, would be the right word.</p><p>“Malfoy… Your house –“                                                                                              </p><p>“The manor” Malfoy interrupts, seemingly without thinking, and furrows his brows at Harry, whom pretends not to notice.</p><p>“Is it… Well, is it alive?” Harry asks, because he hasn’t been in the magic world for a long time, but kind of figured he would have heard about his classmates’ houses having personalities? Feelings? He doesn’t quite understand, but he answer is pretty clear upon Malfoy’s face.</p><p>“I’m not sure if alive is the right world, Potter.” There’s a weird tone to it, “But… Yeah, quite.”</p><p>Harry, who’s too interested in the subject of the conversation, doesn’t notice how Malfoy is looking at him with that same expression on his face. Sadness? Fondness? (Maybe he just finds Harry quite pathetic, which seems more likely than the rest.)</p><p>“How?”</p><p>Malfoy seems to think of it for a while, glances down to the page of the book that’s currently open in front of him, “I haven’t really thought about it before, because it’s always been that way, for me, so there hasn’t been anything to question… But, magic is alive? Isn’t it? And wizards uses magic to fix things in their houses, and the house kind of just… Absorbs the magic, which is rather interesting, isn’t it?” Harry must look as lost as he feels, and Malfoy takes another long moment to think, “It’s like… Hogwarts! The staircases here, right? They move, and that must be because someone used magic to move them so often that the castle kind of figured that, ‘you know what? I’m going to move the stairs, every now and then, because these people need me too’, and it just stuck, because magic has personality.” Then he seems to remember something, important from the look of it, and casts the spell he showed Harry earlier, and from somewhere deep in the library, a book comes flying. It lands on the tabletop with a loud smack, and Harry winces and thinks, for sure, that Pince is going to show up out of nowhere to tell them off, but she doesn’t. It’s ‘Hogwarts, A History’, which Hermione has been carrying around with her all year, trying to figure out where the chamber of secrets might be hidden, and it makes Harry’s heart ache a little to look at, but Malfoy doesn’t seem to notice.</p><p>He flips the book open, as if he knows exactly what he’s looking for, and doesn’t need magic to help him. “Here!” He turns the book towards Harry to let him read, and it’s some story about the staircases for the dormitories. Apparently, decades ago, the boys kept sneaking up into the girls’ dormitories to catch them changing, and the girls had been so distressed, that the castle had taken the case into its own hands and made the stairs turn into slides whenever a boy tried to climb them. Harry remembers Fred and George saying something about that a few weeks ago, and Harry had figured it had just been one of the girls casting some spell, but it had been the castle?</p><p>Malfoy doesn’t let Harry react, “In the manor, well it isn’t the most…” He stops himself, seems to remember whom he’s talking too, and just doesn’t continue the sentence, “There’s this bathroom on the second floor, my mom’s bathroom, and she used to do ice baths all the time, for her muscles, to reduce swelling or something. And she did it so often, over a period of time, that the manor eventually just knew what she came in there for, and now the bath doesn’t produce hot water anymore, no matter the spells we try! As soon as you turn it on, the bath fills with ice cubes, and every wizarding house has these kind of quirks where it’s just tried to help it’s Masters and it has just stuck that way, and may never turn back to how it was!” He’s babbling again, and Harry, who’s not a boy of many words, wonders how it must be to be inside Malfoy’s brain. Wonders, if there’s constant babbling in there, how Malfoy has so much to say all the time.</p><p>Harry used to think, back when he first came to Hogwarts and everything was new and liberating, that if he ever lost his magic, he would… That it would be the worst thing imaginable, and he, probably, wouldn’t be able to live without it. Because Harry came from an abusive home, from absolutely nothing, to magic, which was absolutely everything. And he thought, quite a few times, that if he lost it, there wouldn’t be much else to live for. (Not that Harry really can think of something that can make magic disappear… Because it isn’t really something you have, but something you are, and Harry is.) Magic was the first happiness Harry had ever felt in his life. It brought him to Hogwarts, to his friends, to his home and his purpose, and maybe most importantly, it brought him closer to his parents. But, watching Malfoy talk about magic, the way magic is all he’s ever known, Harry realizes something. Because maybe, just maybe, loosing magic <em>wouldn’t</em> be death for Harry, whom grew up muggle and knows how it feels to live without it, but it certainly would be for someone like Malfoy. Malfoy grew up with nothing but magic, the same as his parents, and their parents before that, his entire bloodline are wizards. And pure-bloods don’t care to learn about anything muggle, so they depend fully and wholeheartedly on magic, and Harry’s not sure there would be a possible life for them without it. He’s sitting here, next to his sworn-enemy, who’s talking about magic, and who loves magic so much, and suddenly it’s Harry’s turn to feel sad for Malfoy. Harry would survive, Malfoy wouldn’t.</p><p>There’s a feeling in his chest now, that he’s thought all these thoughts, it’s fluttering and uncomfortable, and Harry’s not quite sure he’s ever felt a feeling quite like it before. It’s comparable to the feeling he had the first time he went to Diagon Alley, or when Ron sat next to him on the train, or when the whole Gryffindor table erupted into cheer when he was sorted. Malfoy’s still talking, but Harry’s forgotten to pay attention, and is just watching him, in a way he never really has. He’s shocked to find that the anger and hate he always feels around Malfoy, is, well not gone, but different, like a dull buzz in his chest. And the fluttering, uncomfortable (horrible, oh so horrible) feeling in his chest won’t leave.</p><p>Malfoy, who seems to notice the weird look on Harry’s face, looks a little uncomfortable, “What? Potter, do I have something on my face? Have your last brain cells, after years of holding on for dear life, finally died? Are you having a stroke?” But there’s no bite to his words, just confusion, and he’s about to open his mouth again, probably to say something offensive about Harry’s face, when Pince shows up, out of nowhere, per usual.</p><p>“The library is closing, boys.” She looks like she wants to comment on the strange duo, but doesn’t, just sends Harry a funny look. “I suggest Mr. Malfoy put the books back.” Then she disappears, and Harry isn’t sure if it’s just too dark in here to see her leave, or if she apparated.</p><p>Harry turns to Malfoy to say something; he’s not sure what, but feels like he needs to say <em>something. </em>However, Malfoy’s already half way down the rows of shelves, books in hand and posture cold, and Harry sighs and thinks that everything is back to normal. The strange feeling is his chest hasn’t subdued, and his hearts beating too fast, and he feels rather dizzy.</p><p>They both, embarrassed by the nights events, and maybe too proud, and definitely too stupid, never speak of it, that night in the library second year, again.</p>
