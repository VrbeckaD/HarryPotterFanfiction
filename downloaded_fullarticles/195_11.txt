    <p>A small fire danced upon a pile of ashen logs of wood in the stone fireplace. A group of 6th year students sat in a circle in a more secluded corner of the Gryffindor common room. Sirius smirked as he looked around the room. It was his turn to spin the bottle, and he knew exactly who he wanted to kiss. He reached out, and gave the bottle a spin, whispering a spell, and making the wand motion needed.  </p><p>As Sirius expected, the bottle landed on Remus...</p><p>***</p><p>Remus’ face blanched as the bottle landed on him. He had seen the almost imperceptible move Pads made with is wand. For a moment, he panicked. How could they know about his crush?! Sirius paid close attention to Remus' face. He got shit sometimes for being oblivious, but he paid attention to things that mattered. </p><p>"You alright over there, Moony?" he called out to the other boy. </p><p>"...Yeah.”</p><p>"I'll think you'll feel better over here, you wanker.” </p><p>Sirius watched as Remus blushed, internally smirking at the effect he had on him. Remus slowly crawled across the distance of about two people in the circle, before he stopped in front of Sirius. He was even more attractive up close. His vigorous scarring gave him a rugged, more mysterious look. It was sexy as hell, and part of the reason that Sirius wanted him so badly. Among other things of course… Sirius pulled the shorter boy to his feet, and dragged him out of the common room and around the corner into the stairwell to the dorms. Sirius took Moony's hand, and led him up into the dorms, shutting the door behind them.</p><p>"Er Pads?" Remus questioned. </p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"Did you... rig the bottle...?" Sirius smirked, "I'll guess you'll never know, Moony. And seeing this is 7 minutes in heaven after all, perhaps we should kiss..." </p><p>He trailed off, looking intently into Remus' eyes. Moony's cheeks turned pink, and he took a step closer. They were now merely inches apart. Sirius moved his head closer, a silent invitation for a kiss. It was all up to Remus now.</p><p>***</p><p>Remus stared into the rich brown eyes of his friend, debating if he should just go for it and capture his lips... their faces were only inches apart, he could just move a few inches closer  and kiss the other boys lips like he’d wanted to since the start of the year…</p><p>Remus hesitated for a bit too long, and Padfoot took it the wrong way. </p><p>"Sorry..." he mumbled, stepping back and looking ashamed. </p><p>"What- No Padfoot!" Remus almost shouted out at Sirius, "I-I do want to kiss you." </p><p>He was too afraid to look up at the other boy, scared of what he might see in his face. All the longing... A brown hand lifted up his chin, forcing him to make eye contact. Sirius let out a dazzling smile, and leaned down to press his lips against his own.</p><p>They kissed for what felt like hours, Sirius’ lips softer than he anticipated. Remus had never kissed anyone before, always believing that he was just waiting for the right girl. Remus let out a chuckle and Sirius smiled as he hugged him, Moony was nuzzling his chest for christs sake! </p><p>"What does that mean for us, Pads?" Remus asked, muffled. </p><p>"Whatever you want it to mean. I would like for us to be... boyfriends, but we don't have to be... whatever you want!"</p><p>Remus looked up into Sirius' eyes, "I've never even thought about being with anyone let alone another man... this is so new and I wanna take it slow... buy me a butterbeer first and then we'll see.”</p><p>Sirius smiled again, "Wanna go to Hogsmeade this weekend then?" Remus smiled and nodded.</p><p>“Do we have to go back yet?”</p><p>“We do if we want to see James and Snivellus get it on. I may have charmed the bottle...”</p>
