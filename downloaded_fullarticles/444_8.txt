    <p>Harry found the flat easily enough, despite the rain. It was tucked away in a forgotten corner of London, in a building that looked as old as Hogwarts and titled balefully in the wind. Getting inside wasn’t as easy. He surveyed the buzzers; only flats one through nine were listed, though the address written on a scrap of paper in Harry’s pocket definitely said apartment ten. He moved closer, squinting — he badly needed new glasses — but number ten wasn’t there.</p><p>Time to try something else, then. Harry pulled out his wand from inside his coat.<em> “Finite Incantatem,” </em> he mumbled, tapping it against the brick. As soon as he did, a small part of the wall spun around beneath number nine, revealing the bell he wanted: <em> Number Ten, R. Weasley. </em></p><p>There was a time when just that little spell would have awed Harry, left him reeling at the wonders that magic made possible. But those days were long gone.</p><p>He pressed the buzzer, and a second later, the door popped open, heavy oak swinging outwards. Harry stepped inside, into a tiny, carpeted foyer. The staircase before him slanted more steeply than the outside walls. Harry started up them, correctly guessing that he’d find Ron’s flat on the top floor.</p><p>He knocked, quietly at first, then louder as he summoned his courage. Then the door swung open, and there stood his best friend, in a sweater and corduroys, a crooked smile on his face. Just as he had looked when Harry left him five years ago.</p><p>Harry cleared his throat, which had suddenly constricted at the sight of Ron. “Nice trick with the buzzer,” he said.</p><p>If Ron was alarmed to see Harry, he didn’t show it. “Got tired of muggles trying to sell me things.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence, and Harry worried that he’d made a mistake, coming here. Ron was going to slam the door in his face any second. <em> And he should, </em> Harry thought. He deserved that, and worse—</p><p>“You coming in, mate?” Ron asked mildly.</p><p>Harry choked up again. “Yes,” he managed. “Yes, please.”</p><p>“I’ll put the kettle on. You look like pure shit, you know that?” Ron disappeared into the kitchen.</p><p>“I’m aware.” Harry followed him in, shutting the door behind him. He set his duffel bag on the floor, and found a hook to hang his coat on. He kicked off his boots, already feeling better than he had downstairs.</p><p>“Nice place,” he called to Ron. It wasn’t the bachelor pad you’d expect from a twenty-seven-year-old man living alone, but a warm, cozy little apartment, full of old, mismatched furniture and hand-knit blankets. It was cluttered but clean, a non-magical broom leaning near the door. It reminded Harry, painfully, of the Gryffindor common room.</p><p>“Thanks,” Ron answered from the kitchen. “Mum and Percy helped decorate. Way nicer than that hole we used to live in.” He was referring to the apartment he and Harry had shared after leaving Auror training. That place really was a bachelor pad.</p><p>Harry heard a squawk from the kitchen, and went to investigate, in case Ron had burnt himself. But it wasn’t him that made the noise.</p><p>“Blimey, is that Pigwidgeon?” The little bird sat on a perch by the window, hooting softly as Harry stroked his head.</p><p>“Yeah. Can you believe that bugger’s still alive? Do you know I’ve had him as long as I had Scabbers now? Pretty sure Pig’s just a bird, though.” Harry ripped his hand back as Pig tried to take a bite of it. Unable to think of anything else to say, he wandered back into the living room. He blinked when he saw a black box sitting on a table in front of the couch.</p><p>“You have a TV?” Harry stepped closer. “And… is that an Xbox?!” </p><p>Ron laughed. “Yep. This bloke at work, Morris, he’s muggle-born, and he got us all hooked on playing these games on the webs with him. It’s wild stuff. I had to take away Dad’s spare key to keep him from tearing the thing apart to see how it works.”</p><p>Ron, playing video games. Harry’s brain nearly short-circuited. He hadn’t played a video game since he used to sneak downstairs to use Dudley’s Playstation when the Dursleys were asleep. Harry bent down to see what games were on the shelf.</p><p>Ron came back in, carrying two cups of tea. “Sugar, no milk,” he said, handing Harry his. “If you still take it that way.”</p><p>Harry straightened up. “I do. Thank you.”</p><p>Ron flopped down on the couch, gesturing for Harry to take the plush armchair across the room. Harry sat, nearly sinking down to the floor.</p><p>“I would have thought you and Hermione’d have moved in by now,” Harry said.</p><p>Ron smiled wryly. “Not much fun living with your ex-girlfriend.”</p><p>Harry almost spat out his tea. “You split up?!”</p><p>Ron nodded. “Nearly two years ago now.”</p><p>“I… I’m sorry, mate,” Harry sputtered.</p><p>“S’alright. We’re still friendly, I suppose. She’s dating some hoity-toity French guy now.”</p><p>“Wow.”</p><p>Ron frowned. “You know, all this time I wondered if you were still in touch with her. I guess not.”</p><p>Harry shook his head. “I haven’t spoken to anyone from… before.” From his old life.</p><p>Ron just sipped his tea. “Well,” he said, “since you’ve shown up on my doorstep, and I’ve invited you in and made you tea, now, I think I have a right to ask: Where in the everloving fuck have you been?”</p><p>Harry went over the last five years in his head. “Asia, mostly,” he said. “India. America. I even went to Antarctica once.”</p><p>“Living the high life, then?” Ron said lightly.</p><p>It would be so easy for Harry to laugh, to make a joke. Pretend like he had just been travelling for fun, that he’d been happy to be gone. But he didn’t come back here for that. He came back to try to dig himself out of the hole he’d fallen down.</p><p>He took a deep breath. “I was running away,” he said. “Trying to disappear.”</p><p>“Hard to disappear when you’re Harry Potter,” Ron pointed out.</p><p>“Not in the muggle world, and not when I change my appearance.” Harry ran a hand through his hair, his natural black for once, and knotted from the storm outside. Today was the first time he’d looked like himself in years. Scar and all. His hand drifted over it as he tried to untangle his hair.</p><p>And then before he knew it, he was telling Ron everything, how he’d spent the past years in a daze, wandering through towns thousands of miles away, trying anything, everything, to forget who he was. He’d seen Mount Everest and secret magical enclaves in China and the damn Alamo, and none of it made him feel even one iota better.</p><p>“And I know you probably think I’m a complete arsehole for leaving the way I did, and for not writing, and for showing up here like this,” Harry finished ungracefully. “And you’re going to think I’m even more of an arsehole for asking, but I need a place to stay, and I thought maybe I could stay here with you.”</p><p>Ron’s eyebrows lifted. He set his teacup on the table with a clunk. “For how long?”</p><p>“Indefinitely?” Harry said, his voice lifting. “I’m going to try to get my old job back, if they’ll have me, even if it takes a while. Until then I can help out with rent, too, and I…” he trailed off.</p><p>Ron’s eyes narrowed. “So you’re back for good then?” he asked.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You’re not leaving again?”</p><p>“I’m not,” Harry said. “Promise.”</p><p>Ron stared at him for a long time, and Harry felt sure he was going to say no, but then the corner of his mouth quirked up.</p><p>“I’m really pissed off at you, you know that?” But he was smiling.</p><p>“I know,” Harry said. “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>“Good. You should be.” Ron leaned back on the couch. “Mum’s gonna bloody kill you when she sees you.”</p><p>“Er, could you maybe not tell her I’m here yet? I don’t think I’m ready to see everyone.”</p><p>Ron pursed his lips. “Fine. But I’m sending Pig to Hermione to let her know.”</p><p>“Okay, but just Hermione.”</p><p>“And Hagrid,” Ron added.</p><p>“And Hagrid,” Harry agreed. Of all the people Harry felt guilty about leaving, Hagrid was the worst.</p><p>“Good.” Ron pointed to Harry’s duffel bag. “Is that all your stuff? Bit sad if it is.”</p><p>Harry laughed. It sounded strange to him. It had been a long time. “That’s it.”</p><p>“Okay,” Ron said, standing. “Go get it, and I’ll show you your room.”</p>
