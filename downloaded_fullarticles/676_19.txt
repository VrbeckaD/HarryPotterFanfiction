    <p>“Hello?”</p><p>Sirius held the phone closer to his ear. A man’s voice. He hadn’t expected that, but maybe muggle telephones altered people’s voices somehow. He goddamned hoped so.</p><p>“Hello?” he said. “Evans? This is Lily Evans, right? Please tell me I’ve got the right phone or I’m going to lose my fucking mind, I swear to Merlin and his children and their children and –!”</p><p>“Er,” said the man – possible woman – on the phone. “I’m sorry, but I think you’ve got the wrong number. I don’t know of any Evans. Sorry.”</p><p>“Great,” Sirius said. He laughed. “Bloody fantastic. I’ve got the wrong <em>number</em>.” He leaned against the payphone, trying not to wince. Well, not like anyone was watching.</p><p>“There must be a way to get the right one. Do you happen to know how?”</p><p>A pause on the other side.</p><p>“Look, this might sound strange, but are you…a wizard?”</p><p>Sirius frowned at the telephone. He put it back by his ear, the way Peter had taught him to.</p><p>“Yes,” he said. “Are you?”</p><p>He heard a sharp intake of breath. Another pause.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>For the first time that day, Sirius felt something like hope flare in his chest.</p><p>“Brilliant!” he said. “In normal circumstances, I’d ask why the bloody hell a wizard is answering a muggle telephone, but these aren’t normal circumstances, so I’ll skip to the important bits. You’ve got an owl, haven’t you? Can you send a letter to James Potter saying –”</p><p>He paused. What did he want to say to James? That he’d run away, that he was never going back, that his bitch of a mother snapped his wand in two, that his wanker of a brother did nothing as she tortured him right before his eyes?</p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut. The garish orange streetlight still managed to find its way into his corneas.</p><p>“Say I need a place to kip tonight. Maybe forever. No – leave that part out. Say…for the summer. I need a place to stay for the summer, if they’ll have me. Send that to James Potter. I’m Sirius Black. Sirius, like the star, and yeah, that’s my real name. He’ll need to pick me up. I’m…fuck, where am I?”</p><p>Sirius looked around, as if some bright, glowing sign would pop up somewhere. He was still in London – he knew that much. And he couldn’t have gotten too far from Grimmauld Place, but he was a fast runner. Would’ve been faster if he wasn’t bruised and bleeding all to hell.</p><p>“I’m…in London. Not too far from my house? Fuck…”</p><p>“Um –”</p><p>Sirius paused. The stranger didn’t go on. Merlin, these telephones were a pain.</p><p>“What?” Sirius said, finally.</p><p>The other man answered in a rush.</p><p>“You can come to my place, if you want. I’m in London as well, and we’ve got a Floo you can use. I don’t know how far away you are, of course, but if you happen to be close…”</p><p>Sirius blinked. This man couldn’t be serious. <em>No, of course not, </em>I’m<em> Sirius</em>…</p><p>Stop. This wasn’t the time for jokes.</p><p>He cleared his throat.</p><p>“How do I know you’re not a muggle? Or pervert? Or both?”</p><p>A pause.</p><p>“What about you? How do I know you’re not some sort of mass murderer?”</p><p>“I’m not a mass murderer,” Sirius said. “I prefer regular old murder, myself. Much more personal.”</p><p>Heavy silence. He could have kicked himself.</p><p>“You’re not exactly the fastest broom in the shed, are you?”</p><p>Sirius gripped the phone tighter to his ear.</p><p>“Excuse me?!”</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>“My address is Number 6, Kensington Avenue,” said the rude stranger. “And I’m Remus, by the way. Remus Lupin.”</p><p>“Fuck you, Remus Lupin. If that’s even your real name. Honestly, what kind of a name is that? If you’re going to make something up for yourself, go with the first bloody king of Rome, not his dead twin. That’s just common sense, really.”</p><p>Another pause.</p><p>“Sirius Black, was it? I look forward to meeting you, Sirius. If you manage to find my house, that is.”</p><p>“Oh, I’ll find it, all right. Don’t you worry.”</p><p>“I’ll try my hardest. See you soon.”</p><p>With that, the phone cut off. Sirius stared at the grimy, greasy piece of plastic in his hand. No matter how far away Kensington Avenue was, he swore in that moment that he was going to find this Remus Lupin. And he was going to kill him.</p><p> </p><p>It took about an hour. First, Sirius had to figure out where the bloody hell he was. Some place called Newton Lane. Then, he had to ask random, seedy-looking muggles where he could find Kensington Avenue. Not many of them were exactly eager to help. He found a bathroom mirror at some point, and he couldn’t say he looked very trustworthy.</p><p>He had an awful black eye and busted lip. Dried blood matted the left side of his face, ruining his beautiful, black locks, and he knew the rest of him didn’t look any prettier. He took the effort to wash his face, and that fixed him up somewhat. It only hurt like hell. Scowling, he looked back in the mirror.</p><p>He should’ve killed his mother. He should’ve dragged Regulus with him.</p><p>Should’ve. Would’ve. Could’ve.</p><p>He went back out on the hunt. People were a bit more receptive to him after that. They were still wary, though, and it was odd having people draw away so quickly from him like that, because of his looks. Usually, that’s what hooked them in.</p><p>When he finally made it to Number 6, Kensington Avenue, Sirius felt the beginnings of doubt creep in. What if this ‘Remus Lupin’ actually was a perv? Or muggle? Or murderer? What could Sirius do? He didn’t even have his wand. He might as well have been naked.   </p><p>He shook his head. He was Sirius Black. If he could face his parents, however poorly, he could do anything.</p><p>He walked up a quaint, stone pathway, past a neatly trimmed yard. The lights were on. That was a good sign, right?</p><p>He knocked on the front door.</p><p>Someone answered almost immediately.</p><p>“Hello? Who’s there?”</p><p>Sirius took a deep breath.</p><p>“It’s me,” he said. “Sirius Black.”</p><p>A pause on the other side. Eventually, however, he heard the lock click, and finally, the door opened.</p><p>From the sound of his voice, Sirius had expected some swotty kid his age, maybe a bit older. Instead, he got a swotty, middle-aged man with a slight pudge and piercing green eyes. Sirius had never been very tall, but this man would have towered over his father, even.</p><p>He stood as straight as his pain allowed.</p><p>“You’re Sirius Black?” the man said.</p><p>Sirius raised an eyebrow. The voice had changed once again. Muggle telephones really were a pain in the arse.</p><p>“Yes,” he said. “Are you Romulus?”</p><p>The man looked confused for a second. After a pause, his face cleared.</p><p>“You mean Remus?” he said.</p><p>“Yes.” Sirius peered at the tall man. “And you are…?”</p><p>“Remus’ father.”</p><p>Sirius felt a twinge of disappointment. He hadn’t come all this way for the father. Technically, he hadn’t come all this way for Remus either.</p><p>Remus’ father cleared his throat importantly.</p><p>“I understand you’ve come to use our Floo?” he said.</p><p>Sirius started to nod, but then stopped at the pounding in his head.</p><p>“Yes,” he said.</p><p>“How do you know Remus?”</p><p>Sirius wished he had something to lean against. It hadn’t been an easy night, after all. A wave of fatigue washed over him, stayed only by the absurdity of this man’s question.</p><p>“How do I know Remus?” he said. “He has a rather pleasant timbre to his voice, if you listen hard enough, and I bet he looks enough like you, if you really are who you say you are.”</p><p>“What about you, Mr. Black? What is the supposed heir of one of the oldest pureblood families doing here in the middle of the night?”</p><p>Shit. This guy really was a wizard, probably a pureblood at that. Sirius’ flat-out panic had abated with Remus’ phone call, but now, he felt it starting to return.</p><p>“Look, Mr. Lupin…”</p><p>“Lyall!”</p><p>A woman appeared beside Mr. Lupin, probably Remus’ mother. She had honey-brown hair bunched up into a curly mess, and her flowy, blue nightgown made her look almost ethereal. He wondered why someone like her ever married ‘Lyall’.</p><p>“Hope, I told you stay in the living room,” Lyall said.</p><p>Mrs. Lupin ignored this.</p><p>“Lyall, look at the poor boy!” she said. “This isn’t the time to be asking questions.”</p><p>Lyall gave her a look, which, despite his situation, Sirius sort of had to agree with. With Polyjuice, he could have been anyone; although, why anyone would choose to impersonate him at the moment, he had no idea.</p><p>Mrs. Lupin ignored this as well and pushed past Lyall.</p><p>“Sirius, is it?” she said.</p><p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>“Come inside, Sirius. I think you could do with a nice cuppa.”</p><p>Sirius stood, dumbfounded. So did Lyall.</p><p>Mrs. Lupin gestured them both back inside.</p><p>“Come on, you two,” she said.</p><p>Sirius moved first. Relief rushing through him, he took a step forward, and he could have laughed at his luck, he could have cried. But as black spots flickered in his vision, all he could do as he crossed the threshold into the Lupin Household was close his eyes and crash.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius was on the floor, screaming. His mother stood above him. He couldn’t see, but he knew, and his father was laughing, the portraits were laughing, Regulus was laughing. It filled his head, the pain that was not pain, the dark around him. The Tapestry Room was burning, and he could see himself in the flames, reaching out to Regulus who was trying to put out the fire with his tears.</p><p>The idiot.</p><p>Sirius opened his eyes. Light stabbed at him, and for a second, he thought he actually was burning. Crying out, he flailed and rolled out of the bed. He crashed onto the floor, cursing loudly.</p><p>The door burst open.</p><p>“What happened?” said a man’s voice.</p><p>Wincing, Sirius sat up. He was in an unfamiliar room. It was barely large enough for the bed he’d just toppled out of, that and a nightstand. The afternoon sun shone through not-curtained-enough windows, and it was in this light that Sirius first saw Remus Lupin.</p><p>He was swotty, like his father. A gangly teenager who wore a cardigan that matched the sea-green of his eyes. He had a light spread of freckles and tousled, bronze hair, as well as long, pale scars across his face.</p><p>Interesting. Cute. Not his type.</p><p>“Are you all right?” the boy said.</p><p>Sirius realized he was staring. He looked away.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>He got up, which was surprisingly easy, considering the last time he remembered standing. Someone had healed him.</p><p>“Where am I?”</p><p>The boy quirked an eyebrow. “Nice to meet you too,” he said. “I’m Remus, by the way. The one you spoke with on the phone.”</p><p>“Romulus, was it? Where the fuck am I?”</p><p>Remus leaned on the doorframe, rolling his eyes.</p><p>“My house. And if you’re wondering who healed you, you’re looking at him.”</p><p>Sirius looked Remus up and down.</p><p>“You?”</p><p>Remus’ lips twitched.</p><p>“Me,” he said. “But to be honest, it was more of a family effort. Dad actually did most of it. I just got rid of some bruises.”</p><p>Absently, Sirius reached up to touch the area around his eye. It felt perfectly fine. He looked at Remus in a new light.</p><p>“Thanks,” he said.</p><p>Remus blinked.</p><p>“You’re welcome.”</p><p>There was a short, awkward silence. Remus pushed off the doorframe.</p><p>“The Floo’s downstairs,” he said. “Probably best if you left sooner rather than later. My dad’s not very keen on having strangers in the house.”</p><p>Sirius ran a hand through his depressingly lank locks of hair. He needed a shower, fast.</p><p>“Sure,” he said.</p><p>“Follow me then.”</p><p>Sirius followed Remus out of the closet-like room and into the hallway. It was lined with muggle pictures of the three Lupins – Lyall, Remus, and Mrs. Lupin all staring with frozen smiles, like the posters he kept up in his room at Grimmauld. Remus noticed him looking, but didn’t say anything.</p><p>As they reached the stairs, Sirius took the initiative.</p><p>“Haven’t seen you around Hogwarts, have I?” he said.</p><p>“I don’t suppose you have.”</p><p>“Do you go to a different school, then? Beauxbatons, maybe?”</p><p>“Beauxbatons?”</p><p>“You look like the prim and proper type.”</p><p>Remus gave him half a glance.</p><p>“Do I?”</p><p>Sirius stared.</p><p>They reached the living room. It was empty like the rest of the house, but Sirius didn’t much care. Lyall had looked ready to throw him to the wolves, and while he was grateful to Mrs. Lupin, he’d never really been good at saying thanks.</p><p>They stopped at the fireplace.</p><p>“This is me, then,” Sirius said.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Sirius stuffed his hands in his pockets. He couldn’t stop looking at Remus. There was something about the boy that intrigued him. Not the way Gideon or the captain of the Ravenclaw Quidditch team intrigued him, but like a weird book did, one he’d found hidden off in the Restricted Section of the library. Forbidden, forgotten. Just itching to be read.</p><p>He tilted his chin up.</p><p>“Listen, we should meet up again sometime,” he said. “I reckon I owe you a bite to eat, at least.”</p><p>Remus’ eyes widened. It was his turn to look Sirius up and down. For some reason, maybe because of the shitty night he’d just had, this made him feel a bit self-conscious. He ran another hand through his unwashed hair. It didn’t help.</p><p>Remus smiled. At what, he wasn’t sure.</p><p>“All right.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Remus</em> Lupin?”</p><p>Sirius lay in the Potters’ guest bedroom, smoking a muggle fag. He was frowning at the ceiling, which had a bright red painting of a motorcycle. He’d drawn it there himself last summer, using his foot and James’ <em>levicorpus</em>.</p><p>He sighed out white smoke.</p><p>“I know, mate,” he said. “Told him he should’ve gone with Romulus instead.”</p><p>James laughed. He was sitting beside him on the bed, legs crossed. The wanker had on his favorite pyjamas.</p><p>“But that’s his actual name?”</p><p>“I’m telling you, it is!”</p><p>“And what’s he like, this Remus Lupin?”</p><p>Sirius waved his hand, flinching when ash fell on him.</p><p>“A total swot, and a sharp one at that. I mean, he’s a nice enough bloke, I suppose, but you know how I feel about nice blokes.”</p><p>James shrugged.</p><p>“You could do with a nice bloke.”</p><p>“I’ve got Peter, haven’t I?”</p><p>“I’m sure he’d be overjoyed to hear that.”</p><p>Sirius barked out a laugh. “I reckon he’d piss his pants, actually. Could you imagine?”</p><p>“I’d rather not,” James said, though he laughed too.</p><p>“It’d be like when Mary asked him out in third year. D’you remember?”</p><p>“Course I do! Proudest moment of my life.”</p><p>“That’s the most depressing thing I’ve heard all day.”</p><p>James shoved him. “Well, it <em>would</em> have been bloody historical if Pete hadn’t choked.”</p><p>“Yeah, mate, but he did.”</p><p>“Reckon Mary still hasn’t forgiven him for that.”</p><p>“I reckon you’re right.”</p><p>Laughing, James lay down beside him. They both stared at Sirius’ motorcycle painting and the smoke from his fag.</p><p>“Lucky he was there, though, that Remus,” James said.</p><p>Sirius sighed. “Yeah. Dunno if Evans would’ve been nearly as helpful.”</p><p>“She would’ve. Maybe.”</p><p>“Mate, she hates me almost as much as she hates you.”</p><p>“She doesn’t hate me.”</p><p>“She hates you.”</p><p>“She doesn’t! We’ll be dating by the end of this year, just you wait.”</p><p>“I’ve <em>been</em> waiting, Prongs.”</p><p>“She almost said yes last time! If only Snivellus hadn’t butted in…”</p><p>Sirius scowled. The room seemed to darken, and in the ceiling above, he didn’t see his bright-red motorcycle anymore. Instead, he saw a shimmering chandelier and his mother’s contorted face.</p><p>“Snivellus,” he spit out. “I bet you anything it was him.”</p><p>James fell quiet. He didn’t have to say anything.</p><p>Sirius had arrived at the Potters’ just that morning. They welcomed him with open arms, which, even after all these years, still touched him more than he’d care to admit. The guest room already had some of his clothes, magazines, and odd knickknacks. The walls were even decorated with random pictures he, James, and Peter had taken over the years.</p><p>It felt more like home than Grimmauld had ever been. The second he stepped inside, he closed the door and just cried. He cried, showered, slept, and ate. No one asked questions, though they’d seen the blood on his clothes and his missing wand. Euphemia hugged him, Fleamont told him he was there to talk, if he ever needed it, and James…well, James was James.</p><p>Sirius stared up at the ceiling.</p><p>“They found out I’m bent.”</p><p>James looked at him. “What’d they do?”</p><p>His voice was steady, fierce. Sirius closed his eyes.</p><p>“What do you think?” he said. “She went mad. Said I’d always been a disgrace and all the usual rubbish. You’d think I’d be used to that by now, but it just drove <em>me</em> mad. I mean, who the fuck does she think she is? Her and her bloody Death Eater friends – they’re the pieces of shit mucking up the wizarding world. Filth like her should just go die and leave me the fuck alone.”</p><p>Sirius opened his eyes. He took a long draw from his fag.</p><p>“She used <em>crucio</em> on me. Father spared me with the usual, and Reg…”</p><p>He thought of Regulus watching, silent, his eyes wide with unvoiced horror. He thought of trying to hold in his screams, so that his little brother would sleep at night.</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>“I’m not going back, James,” he said. “Not this time.”</p><p>James bolted upright.</p><p>“Too right!” he said.</p><p>Sirius blinked as James looked down at him, his hazel eyes, well, serious.</p><p>“I wouldn’t let you go back even if you tried. I love you, mate, and that family of yours – they can rot in hell, for all I care. I’m your family, Sirius. Me, Pete, and my parents. You belong with us. You always have.”</p><p>Sirius stared. Slowly, he felt a grin cross his face. He didn’t have words. Clearing his throat, he sat up and snuffed out his fag. He glanced at James.</p><p>“Is that a proposal, Prongs?” he said.</p><p>James smiled, those hard eyes turning warm. “Of course it is. You better accept before I go running off with Evans.”</p><p>Sirius barked out a laugh. “As if that’d ever happen!”</p><p>James pretended to look offended.</p><p>“It’s going to happen!” he said. “I’m telling you, this year’s the year, mate!”</p><p>Sirius shook his head.</p><p>“You’re hopeless.”</p><p>“Just you wait,” James said. He slung an arm over Sirius’ shoulders. “This time next year, we’ll be going on double dates, me with Lily, and you with that Remus fellow.”</p><p>Sirius rolled his eyes. “Sod off!” he said.</p><p>James laughed.</p>
