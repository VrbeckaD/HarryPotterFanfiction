    <p>So, I wrote this. I really don't know why. I have too much, yet not enough time on my hands.</p>
<p>I can gladly say, I was not the original writer, as I would not ever want to own up to writing this mess. Some vents in it have been altered a lot, some very ittle or none at all AN are completely the same and may not make sense (Not that they really did before.) Enjoy!</p>

</center><p>Hi, my name is Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way. My hair is long, the colour of ebony (it's how I got my name!) with purple streaks running through it and the tips are dyed red. It reaches to about mid-way down my back. My eyes are an icy blue, almost like limpid tears. Most people say I look similar to Amy Lee.</p>
<p>
  <i> / AN: if u don't know who she is get da hell out of here! / </i>
</p>
<p>Currently, I'm studying at the wizarding school of Hogwarts, for Wizards and Witches alike. It's settled in Scotland and I'm slowly making my way through the seventh year, that makes me seventeen!</p>
<p>I'm also a vampire. Except my teeth are straight, not the typical sharp-pointed ones, and at a perfect white. My skin is like that of Snow White's, my dark hair creating contrasting tones. I call myself a goth, wearing mostly black, shades of crimson and scarlet, or an occasional plum purple or bubblegum pink. I'd say my favourite shop is Hot Topic, it is where I buy most of my outfits.</p>
<p>For example, I am presently wearing a black corset. There is a matching dark lace around it. Below, I don a leather miniskirt, with punch fishnets and coal-coloured combat boots. My make-up is of similar shades. The whole set of lipstick, eye-liner, eye-shadow and foundation. Crimson painted my eyelids while my skin flushes whiter than an ivory chess set.</p>
<p> <i> / CHANGE OF PERSON / </i></p>
<p>Right now, Ebony passively walked outside the castle building. Fortunately, it was snowing, so the sun was hidden away by clouds, making her happy. Ebony feel eyes on at her back, so she looked. The sight didn't surprise her. It was the preps. Ebony kindly lifted a middle finger to them.</p>
<p>"Hey Ebony!" shouted a voice. She lifts her head towards it and there was...Draco Malfoy!</p>
<p>"What's up Draco?" Ebony asked.</p>
<p>"Nothing," he said shyly.</p>
<p>But then, the vampire heard her friends calling. Without another word, she rushed off.</p>

</center><p>The next day is the same, sky still dropping its sorrowful snow down to the floor. Ebony catches it collecting at the base of a window as she arose from the coffin. It was a raven black, with a padded hot-pink inside. It had a lace trimming too. The vampire drank from a blood-filled bottle as she picked out today's outfit: an inky leather dress, complete with my usual combat boots, and fishnets - black today - while her over-sized MCR shirt was discarded. To accessorises, she placed a pentagram pendant around her lightened neck. Ebony's ears wear the four pairs of earrings while her hair gets tousled into a messy bun.</p>
<p>
  <i> / AN: Raven dis is u! / </i>
</p>
<p>Her friend, Willow then woke up. Her forest-green eyes opened and she grinned upon seeing her friend as her first sight of the day. She flipped her lengthy hair, it was a crow colour and reached to about her waist. Pink streaks stood out in the sea of darkness. Her Marilyn Manson t-shirt was pulled on with swift movements. A black mini-shirt, along with fishnets and pointed raised boots. They both spend a little time applying their familiar make-up routine.</p>
<p>"Oh my fucking god," Willow suddenly exclaimed in excitement. She had clearly remembered something important "I saw you talking to Draco Malfoy yesterday!"</p>
<p>"Yeah? So?" Ebony said, blushing. Willow began to leave the room and she hastily followed. The two were just entering the Slytherin common room when she spoke up again.</p>
<p>"Do you like Draco?" It was an innocent question but unreasonable anger rose in Ebony's heart. They'd just entered the Great Hall when it all came out. The girl guesses she was being too defensive, but Ebony still shouted.</p>
<p>"No, I so fucking don't!"</p>
<p>"Yeah right!" she exclaimed. Just then, Draco walked up to the pair. Speak of the devil, as they say.</p>
<p>"Hi," he said.</p>
<p>"Hi," Ebony replied boringly, a pathetic smile gracing her lips as she subtly looks him over.</p>
<p>"Guess what."</p>
<p>"What?" She asked, a little impatient.</p>
<p>"Well, Good Charlotte are having a concert in Hogsmeade." he told me. Ebony couldn't believe her ears. Had Draco said...</p>
<p>"Oh. My. Fucking. God!" Ebony screamed. She loved Good Charlotte so very much. They were her favourite band, besides MCR. "Well…. do you want to go with me?" he asked and Ebony thought her ears had malfunctioned yet again.</p>
<p>Ebony gasped.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p> <i><b>CHAPTER 3 - Concert</b></i></p>
  <p>AN: STOP FLAMMING DA STORY PREPZ OK! odderwize fangs 2 da goffik ppl 4 da good reveiws! FANGS AGEN RAVEN! oh yeah, BTW I don't own dis or da lyrics 4 Good Chralotte.</p>
  <p>
    <b>XXXXXX666XXXXXX</b>
  </p>
</center><p>Soon the night of the concert came running around. Ebony had had an outfit planned out beforehand. She put on my black lace-up boots with high heels. Underneath them were ripped red fishnets, with matching ones on my arms. Then she put on an inky leather minidress with a corset design around the torso. Her hair had been straightened before styled to have spikes present. Nails became coated in black, along with thin lips. Midnight eye-liner joined the make-up compilation too.</p>
<p>Despite this concert, Ebony still felt the familiar presence of depression seeping through. So she slit one of her wrists. Then, flicking through a depressing novel, she waited for the blood to stop running. Good Charlotte filtered through in the background.</p>
<p>The vampire downs some human blood so then she's ready to get going.</p>
<p>Trekking her way through the castle and outside, Ebony find Malfoy waiting for her. He's leaning against his car - a Mercedes-Benz - in a Simple Plan t-shirt, baggy black skater pants, black nail polish and a little eyeliner. It makes him look hot.</p>
<p>
  <i> / AN: A lot fo kewl boiz wer it ok! / </i>
</p>
<p>"Hey, Draco." The girl said in a depressed voice.</p>
<p>"Hi Ebony," he said back. Being the gentleman he is, Draco held the passenger door open for his daye and she climbed in, watching as he rounds the vehicle and to get in beside her. Suddenly but smoothly the Mercedes lifted from the ground and they were off.</p>
<p>On the way, the two listened excitedly to Good Charlotte and Marilyn Manson. Draco handed over a lit cigarette and Ebony took a drag, watching as the smoke dissipates into the air as the car whip through the sky.</p>
<p>When the vehicle landed safety, you could see a mosh pit. Quickly climbing from to seat, Ebony led Draco over to the stage and they spent the night jumping up and down to the blaring music.</p>
<p>
  <i> / don't own da lyrics 2 dat song / </i>
</p>
<p>~~ You come in cold, you're covered in blood They're all so happy you've arrived The doctor cuts your cord, hands you to your mom She sets you free into this life. ~~</p>
<p>"Joel is so fucking hot," Ebony confessed to Draco, pointing to the man in question as he sang, filling the club with his amazing voice. Suddenly Draco's mood turned sour. Ebony questioned him before catching on to the problem. "Hey, it's okay. I don't like him better than you!"</p>
<p>"Really?" asked Draco sensitively and he put his arm around her all protective.</p>
<p>"Really," she reassured him. "Besides I don't even know Joel and he's going out with Hilary fucking Duff. I fucking hate that little bitch." Ebony spat disgustedly, thinking of her ugly blonde face.</p>
<p>The night went on well, and Ebony had a great time. So did Malfoy. After the concert, they managed to get Benji and Joel's autographs and some photos with them. After, they received concert shirts and end up drinking a beer or two.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the time came to crawl back into the Mercedes-Benz, but Draco didn't go back into Hogwarts. Instead, he drove the car into…</p>
<p>The Forbidden Forest!</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p> <i><b>CHAPTER 4 - The Forbidden Forest</b></i></p>
  <p>AN: I sed stup flaming ok ebony's name is ENOBY nut mary su OK! DRACO IS SOO IN LUV wif her dat he is acting defrent! dey nu eechodder b4 ok!</p>
  <p>
    <b> XXXXXX666XXXXXX</b>
  </p>
</center><p>"Draco!" Ebony exclaimed. "What the fuck do you think you are doing?" The teenager didn't answer but he slowed the flying car to a holt and he climbed out of it. She followed him out of it too, curiously. "What the fucking hell?" Ebony asked again angrily.</p>
<p>"Ebony?" he finally said.</p>
<p>"What?" She snapped. The vampire just wanted to get back to the school. Back to her coffin.</p>
<p>Draco leaned in extra-close and Ebony found herself gazing into his gothic red eyes (he was wearing colour contacts) which revealed so much depressing sorrow and evilness and then suddenly she didn't feel mad anymore.</p>
<p>And, in a sudden moment, Draco kissed the girl passionately. She couldn't help but return the action. It slowly heated up and Draco climbed on top of Ebony, keeping her against a tree. Her dress was discarded to the ground and soon her partner's clothes followed it. Shirt, trousers, and underwear. Ebony unclipped her bra. She realised this was her first. Draco Malfoy was to be her first time!</p>
<p>"Oh! Oh! Oh! " Ebony screamed. Her pale body was now warm and sweaty against Draco's. She clung to his thin shoulders, her nails leaving little trails along the pale skin like the mounds of dirt in a freshly ploughed field. We moved in sync. Draco panting heavily in Ebony's ear. She felt her climax building.</p>
<p>But then the mood was broken by a shout.</p>
<p>"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!"</p>
<p>Malfoy froze and her grip tightened. Thankfully Ebony's bare body was shielded by the man above her. But she still felt entirely exposed. Then a figure stepped towards the couple, Ebony could just about see their face in the low levels of moonlight</p>
<p>It was…Dumbledore.</p>
<p></p><center>

  </p>
</center><p>Then Dumbledore ordered for Draco and Ebony to follow him. He kept shouting at us angrily.
</p>
<p>"You ludicrous fools!"</p>
<p>Ebony started to cry, tears of blood down her pallid face. But Draco comforted hee and the weeps toned down to stifled sobs.</p>
<p>The trio made it back to the moonlit castle, where Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall stood together. They both looked beyond angry. "They were having sexual intercourse in the Forbidden Forest!" The headmaster yelled in a furious voice.</p>
<p>"Why did you do such a thing, you mediocre dunces?" asked Professor McGonagall, fire roaring in her wise eyes.</p>
<p>"How dare you?" demanded Professor Snape. And then Draco shrieked.</p>
<p>"Because I love her!"</p>
<p>Everyone fell silent, taken aback by Malfoy's unforeseen outburst. Dumbledore and McGonagall still looked mad, probably more about them doing it in the Forbidden Forest than anything. The students were of age after all. Snape spoke up again</p>
<p>"Fine. Very well. You may go up to your rooms." So they did just that, feeling the teachers' eyes on them until the doors shut behind the two...</p>
<p>"Are you okay, Ebony?" The boy asked her gently when they were truly alone and away from the judgemental gazes.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I guess." She lied. Ebony left to go to the girls' dorm without another word. He concert outfit was swapped out for something more comfortable: a low-cut black floor-length dress with red lace all around it and black high heels. Her hair was brushed and teeth cleaned.</p>
<p>Once she'd left, she almost ran into Draco, who was standing in front of the bathroom. He started to sing 'I just wanna live' by Good Charlotte. Ebony was so flattered, even though he wasn't supposed to be there. She was soon brought into an embrace, arms looping around her thin frame. The two kissed before Draco had reluctantly get back into his room.</p>
<p></p><center>

  <p>
    <b>XXXXXX666XXXXXX</b>
  </p>
</center><p>Just like any other day, Ebony awakes in her coffin. A ripped, black mini skirt with a match red-skull shirt was thrown on. Heeled boots pulled snuggly over each foot. A skull and a cross earing on both ears. She decided to spray-dye her hair purple.</p>
<p>In the Great Hall, Ebony ate some Count Chocula cereal with blood instead of milk. A glass of cherry-red blood to go with it. She's taking a sip when suddenly someone bumped into her. All the contents toppled over her top.</p>
<p>"Bastard!" She shouted angrily. However, the vampire regretted the insult when she had spun around to face the culprit. Ebony was met with a familiar pale person, who she scanned her eyes over.</p>
<p>Spiked hair as black as pitch, streaked with dragon red. Smooth skin as albino as an arctic hare, broken up by the rivers of inky eyeliner down their cheek. A manly stubble acted as a dam, blocking the rivets from flowing any further down their body. Lips were coated in a dark paint.</p>
<p>Glasses, gone, and eyes now redder than a blood moon - not their usual emerald-green - drew Ebony's gaze. They held it for just a few seconds. Until Ebony was the one to break it, searching the broad forehead for the infamous scar but finding it gone.</p>
<p>Of course, Ebony knew this person. Almost everyone did. Harry Potter. Although, he'd changed a bit- no 'a bit' is more of an understatement.</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry." He said in a shy voice. The accent was English and incredibly sexy. A brief thought flashed her mind, he looked exactly like Joel Madden. Potter was immensely good looking and Ebony felt a lady-boner coming on</p>
<p>"That's all right, Harry"</p>
<p>"Actually, most people call me Vampire these days." He grumbled.</p>
<p>"Why?" The female questioned, he certainly fits the name.</p>
<p>"Because I love the taste of human blood." Vampire giggled.</p>
<p>"Well, I am a vampire," Ebony confessed. A look of shock crossed his face and Potter took a slight step back. Not many people had met a real vampire before, even in the wizarding world.</p>
<p>"Really?" he whimpered. It was a little amusing to Ebony, the boy who lived, cowling at the sight of a vampire.</p>
<p>"Yeah." She roared, holding back her amusement.</p>
<p>The two conversed for a while over breakfast, forgetting all about the incident of earlier. But that all came to an end when Draco appeared, coming up behind Ebony and announcing that he had a surprise for her. Ebony let Malfoy lead her away.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>

  <p>
    <b>XXXXXX666XXXXXX</b>
  </p>
</center><p>Draco and Ebony paced with their fingers interlinked and palms touching. Before Draco showed her the surprise, she'd told him a change of outfit was needed. Ebony couldn't walk around with blood staining her chest, she would gain even more odd looks. And the teachers might not be impressed either.</p>
<p>To add to her look, Ebony quickly painted her nails a shade of ruby, Satanic symbols decorating each finger.</p>
<p>
  <i> / AN: c doez dat sound lik a Maru Sue 2 u? / </i>
</p>
<p>Now that she thought of it - making her way back to Malfoy - Vampire hadn't looked the happiest when she'd left. In fact, dark misery sat deep in his depressed eyes. Perhaps he was jealous of the couple? But Ebony hardly knew him personally, just his famous "The Boy Who Lived" persona.</p>
<p>Once the female vampire has made it back to her awaiting man, Draco brought her up to his room. She noted him locking the door. Ebony knew exactly what the surprise was now.</p>
<p>With a smirk, Malfoy advanced on her, trailing his nimble hands over her anorexic body. She shivered at the lack of warmth in his touch but drew him close. Their lips met in a hurried movement. Quickly it escalated from sucking on the other's lip to full-on, open-mouthed assault. Their tongues were their lances and they fought passionately at a duel.</p>
<p>
  <i> / c is dat stupid? / </i>
</p>
<p>The pale hands continued to venture over the unexplored landscapes that were Ebony's body. As seconds ticked over the gentle caressed became desperate grabs and needy squeezes. Ebony's top was flung off, wandering hands leaving their domain for just a second to remove the blockade leather bra. Then Draco's jeans were ripped away as the two manoeuvred towards the bed.</p>
<p>Rarely did their contact lose each other, if only for the briefest of moments to expel some sort of barrier or another. And only once both parties were naked did the separation cease to exist. It was passionate, it was love.</p>
<p>And only then did it all fall quiet, no more breathy shouts of a name or the exclaimed profanity, once climax had been reached. Yet with a simple image did the passion break and the bubble of post-coital bliss burst.</p>
<p>It was a tattoo, stamped clear on the arm of Ebony's lover. A void heart, jumping out to anyone who looked at it, was pierced by an arrow. Normally tattoos wouldn't disgust Ebony, she actually thought they were pretty cool. But if it wasn't for the name forever inked onto said arm, she would never have blown up in the way she did.</p>
<p>Vampire.</p>
<p>Written across it in gothic-style calligraphy. Plain and simple.</p>
<p>Ebony was beyond fuming. How could he have not told her? Draco had lain with another man, perhaps still meeting up behind her back.</p>
<p>"You bastard!" She shouted angrily, jumping out of the bed. All feeling of warmth and love gone, as though they hadn't just shared a wondrous moment with one another.</p>
<p>"No-No!" Draco pleaded. "But you don't understand!" Except Ebony knew too much</p>
<p>"No, you fucking idiot!" She shrieked back, emotions getting the better of her. "You probably have AIDs anyway!"</p>
<p>With haste faster than that of the god Hermes, Ebony redressed with a huff before stomping from the room. She could hear Draco following along behind her but she didn't care - even if he did have a massive - this vampire was too mad. She stomped along and did so until they both found Vampire's lesson. Ignoring all students and the professor, Ebony yelled,</p>
<p>"VAMPIRE POTTER, YOU MOTHERFUCKER!"</p>
<p></p><center>

  </p>
</center><p>The whole class stared at the two in shocked. It felt like one of those trope-filled TV shows. There was a beat of silence until Draco started to beg. Then did Ebony realise the man was still naked.
</p>
<p>"Ebony, it's not what you think!" Draco screamed, true emotion clear in his voice.</p>
<p>
  <i> / I won't hesitate, bitch. I wanted to add this, it wasn't an original AN, I had no odea how to fit it in with the narrative / </i>
</p>
<p>An angry voice the rang out in the room, echoing around, it was cold and nastily.</p>
<p>"What is it that you desire, you ridiculous dimwit!"</p>
<p>It was Snape, but the female vampire ignored him.</p>
<p>"Vampire, I can't believe you're sleeping with Draco!" Ebony accused, and again, like a cliché show, everyone gasped. Whispers raced around the room like a disease, speculations and accusations.</p>
<p>With a dramatic turn, Ebony found her friend B'loody Mary. Most knew her previously as Hermione Granger. But that was before she found out the truth: her real parents were a vampire and a witch. Unfortunately her mother had been murdered by Voldemort and consequently, her father ended his life not long afterwards. Hermione had been kidnapped beforehand, so she remembered nothing of her parents but the trauma of the taking still gave her frequent nightmares, her life was haunted by it.</p>
<p>Hermione had taken up Satanism, much like her friends, and moved to Slytherin. Her hair had grown down to her waist, dyed gothic-black. Her eyes dragon-red by contacts, again following Potter and Draco.</p>
<p>B'loody Mary smiled supportively at Ebony.</p>
<p>
  <i>  /CHANGE OF P.O.V/ </i>
</p>
<p>Draco wasn't entirely sure why Ebony was mad. So what if he had a tattoo? It was a mistake and he was hoping to get it corrected or covered soon. Yes, Draco had dated Potter, but that was over. Potter had ended it, no longer interested in him and wanting someone else.</p>
<p>They'd become good friends a while after though, no point in holding grudges. Then Potter had gone through changes and soon found his true self in Gothicism</p>
<p>"But I'm not going out with Draco anymore!" Confessed Vampire.</p>
<p>"Yeah, fucking right! Fuck off, you bastard!" Ebony screamed yet again. She ran out of the room faster than a cheetah, leaving them all in a state of shock.</p>

    <b>XXXXXX666XXXXXX</b>
  </p>
</center><p>Ebony was fuming. But she felt that anger melt into sadness and Ebony felt her energy dissipate. She collapsed against a tree, tears pouring from her weeping eyes.
</p>
<p>She hardly noticed when a new figure approached until they landed beside her, stepping off a broom. Ebony jumped out of her skin and stood back up in a flash. They were wearing all black The person - if they even were a person - had no nose, just two slits in the middle of his face. Ruby dark eyes stared down at her...</p>
<p>It was Voldemort!</p>
<p>Ebony tried to shout and run by the Dark Lord threw the Imperius curse at her with fluent precision. She struggled against it, trying desperately to force Voldemort fr her mind</p>
<p>"Ebony," he said, voice colder than ice and with a hiss. "Thee might not but killeth Harry Potter!"</p>
<p>The girl's thought turned to Vampire. His beautiful eyes, his gothic hair and his perfectly chiselled face. Draco's words replayed in her mind and she realised her mistake.</p>
<p>Suddenly a gun was thrust into her hand, and her fingers grasped it without her wishes.</p>
<p>"No! Please! I can't!" The girl begged.</p>
<p>"Thee might not but! If 't be true thee doth nay, then I shalt killeth thy belov'd Draco"</p>
<p>"He means nothing to me!" Called Ebony, hoping desperately her ploy would work.</p>
<p>"I has't telekenisis," The Dark Lord stated cruelly, seeing through her schemes clearly. "And if 't be true thee dont killeth Harry, then thee knoweth what shall befall to Draco."</p>
<p>With that, the snake-like wizard flew off on his broomstick and his curse fell away. Ebony felt her control return and her mind free of intruders.</p>
<p>She was shaking with so much fear and anger it clouded her reason and Ebony couldn't think straight. What was she to do now?</p>
<p>To her right, there came a rustling of dead leaves. The female vampire froze up again, had He-Who-Should-Not-Be-Named come back? Had his mind changed? Was he to finish her off? Ebony couldn't stop her racing thoughts. Her heart caught in her throat as a lone figure stepped out. Holding the gun up, she was prepared to shoot. They moved into the dimmed starlight-</p>
<p>It was Draco! Yet her body did not stop it's trembling, nor did her heart leave her gullet. Ebony thought of Voldemort's threats. But she knew she couldn't tell anyone, not even Dumbledore. Not yet.</p>
<p>Ebony swiftly hid the weapon in the waistband of her skirt. It was uncomfortable but she couldn't let Draco see it. The whole situation could be taken out of context.</p>
<p>"Draco!" She cried, forcing her voice to quit its wavering and stand strong. "Hi!"</p>
<p>"Hey." He muttered, face crestfallen at the sight of her. Their falling-out came back to her, having been pushed to the back of her mind over Voldemort. Ebony suddenly felt really guilty.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" I asked, noticing his - now fully dressed - state, un-dyed foundation pilled on to make him seem more bloodless partnered with messy eyeliner</p>
<p>"No." he answered plainly.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, okay? I shouldn't have gotten all mad at you, but I thought you cheated on me."</p>
<p>"That's okay," he said all depressed, although the vampire wasn't entirely convinced. Draco must have noticed and taken her hands. "I accept your apology, now let's get back, yeah?"</p>

    <b>XXXXXX666XXXXXX</b>
  </p>
</center><p>Ebony spent the day in fear of the Dark Lord. His winged words fluttering about her head like rabid pigeons, all fighting for a scrap of bread. She couldn't control them and they only got worse and worse as the day progressed.</p>
<p>These putrid promises even ruined the rehearsals of Ebony's band: Bloody Gothic Rose 666. They were a gothic metal band and consisted of Ebony herself as lead singer and guitarist, B'loody Mary, Vampire, Draco, Diabolo (formerly Ron, but now with electric-blue streaked dark hair), and Cedric. The group has been told once that they sounded similar to Good Charlotte, Slipknot, and MCR. Of course, that had brought pride to the members, giving them the ambition to continue their music.</p>
<p>Only today was also made worse with the lack of Draco and Vampire. The two had claimed they weren't up for it and Ebony had accepted that. She'd assumed that Vampire had slunk away to watch a sad movie. Whilst Draco was probably huddled up in his room, cutting at the flesh of his bony arms. If it wasn't for the fact he was a vampire, Ebony would have been up there and putting a stop to it. He couldn't die unless it was with a steak to the heart.</p>
<p>Ebony had dressed up for her boyfriend, a leather shirt to show off her breasts with a matching, tiny mini skirt with 'Simple Plan' embroidered on the arse.</p>
<p>The reduced group had just finished singing a cover of 'Helena' when Ebony then burst dramatically into tears of red.</p>
<p>"Ebony! Are you OK?" B'loody Mary asked in a concerned voice.</p>
<p>"What the fuck do you think?" The vampire returned angrily. Her emotions always got the better of her, a fatal flaw. Exploitable, she knew, but Ebony struggled to control them. Instead, this time she let her grief take over and unexpectedly found herself spilling everything that has happened before.</p>
<p>She spat out the retelling of her story, everyone listening intensively after the girl's outbreak of rage. "But I don't want to kill him! Only the Dark Lod will fucking kill Draco if I don't!"</p>
<p>Once it was all out and the room was silent did Ebony truly falling into weeping sorrows. She felt like she could match Odyssey with all this crying, but she wasn't a hero like him. To make matters worse, a voice cried out which Ebony oh so wished hadn't shown up.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you fucking tell me!I" Draco's voice cracked with the strain. "How could you- you- you fucking poser muggle bitch!"</p>
<p>
  <i> /c is dat out of character? / </i>
</p>
<p>Ebony's already falling tears double in quantity and she noticed Draco's spilling out too. Then the boy was gone.</p>
<p>Slowly the band started to expel the awkwardness from the room, picking up their instruments and gradually falling back into practice. All the while Ebony remained conflicted, should she have followed Draco? Why didn't she tell him that night it all happened?</p>
<p>Ebony couldn't tell you how much time passed before Dumbledore suddenly shot into the room. With anger that could rival that of the great god Zeus, his wise eyes were lit by blazing fires.</p>
<p>"What have you done!" He boomed, scaring each student. Ebony was briefly aware of Diabolo dropping his microphone. The audible slam echoing from the speakers almost comical.</p>
<p>
  <i> / c dats basically nut swering and dis time he wuz relly upset n u wil c y / </i>
</p>
<p>"Professor?" One of the group askes hesitantly, the raging man terrifying them. Their rehearsals weren't prohibited, they had permission. With a breath, Dumbledore stood before them and spoke.</p>
<p>"Ebony, Draco has been found in his room...He committed suicide."</p>

</center><p>The silence was shattered with Ebony's banshee-like scream. She had tears of blood cascading down her colourless cheeks, ruining the pristine image. B'loody Mary tried to comfort her friend but was shoved away as Ebony fled from the room. There werefootsteps following but she didn't bother to look. She didn't care. Her lanky legs carried the crying girl back to her door where the door was slammed shut.
</p>
<p>Soon blood was set free from her wrists and covering her clothes. So Ebony discarded the ruined materials once she'd run herself a bath. Bubbles floated on top and created a blanket over the warm water. Linkin Park's music filled the small bathroom. The vampire was tempted to plunge a steak straight into her heart without a second thought, but she couldn't bring herself to end it all now.</p>
<p>Instead, she rose from the tub before her smooth skin began to shrivel. Drying and wrapping herself in a towel, Ebony picked out something new to wear. The lucky pick was a low-cut lacy dressed - black, of course - with black high heels that had pink-coloured metal at the ends. Her ears were loaded with seven skull earrings each.</p>
<p>She was just leaving the room when her eyes caught something outside the window. Ebony froze, think it was Voldemort back to taunt her. However, when she looked it was…</p>
<p>Professor Snape and Lockhart!</p>
<p>Both on their brooms and levitating. The greasy-haired potions teacher held a camcorder up to the glass, while Lockhart was beside him masturbating!</p>
<p>"You perverts! Stop watching me naked!"</p>
<p>Ebony let out her second scream of the day, hoping it would someone. Anyone. And, just like that, Potter burst into the room like some sort of hero.</p>
<p>"Allah Kedavra!" He yelled, pointing his wand out if the window and at the two professors. Quick thinking Ebony raced from her bathroom to grab the concealed gun 'gifted' to her from Voldemort.</p>
<p>"I could kill Potter now." Ebony thought darkly. "There's no point…Voldemort has nothing over me anymore."</p>
<p>So instead she sprang back to Vampire, aiming her gun at the two men. Vampire shot of a spell, hitting the camcorder from Snape's hand. It fell from the professor's grasp, tumbling to the far down ground.</p>
<p>Suddenly the door swung open again and there stood Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"Ebony, it has been revealed that someone has - No!" he shouted, noticing the two peeping tom's floating outside. He had just waved his brilliantly carved wand and out of nowhere, Cedric Diggory appeared on top of his broom.</p>
<p>"Everyone! We need to talk!" His booming voice spoke.</p>
<p>"What do you know, Cedric? You're just a student!"</p>
<p>"I may only be a student…" he paused, taking in an angered breath, "but I'm also a Satanist!"</p>
<p>Severus Snape let out a shocked gasp, his robs singed and smoking from the blasts of Vampire and Dumbledore's wands. "You can't be! There must-"</p>
<p>But the snivelling potions master was cut off by the self-centred Gilderoy Lockhart. He was holding the camcorder triumphantly.</p>
<p>"The lens may be ruined but the tape is still there!"</p>
<p>It was Vampire's turn to speak up,</p>
<p>"Why are you doing this?"</p>
<p>"Because…because…." Diggory stammered, emotions getting in the way of his ability to speak. He paused upon his broom.</p>
<p>"Because you're Gothic?" Snape asked, unsure of the new boy due to his connection with Satan. Diggory ignored him, swooping in closer on his flying broomstick, humming the melody to 50 cents song. Everyone was quiet, waiting for the reveal and forgetting about the previous altercation.</p>
<p>And the Hufflepuff spoke words that Ebony had heard once before. Not from his lips, no, but someone she held dear. Immediately, she felt a little faint. She did not know whether to feel shocked or flattered. Cedric said</p>
<p>"Because I LOVE HER!"</p>
