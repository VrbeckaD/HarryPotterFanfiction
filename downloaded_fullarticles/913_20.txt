    <p>Percy can't put his finger on when exactly the ministry fell. Officially, the historians will place it at about the time as Bill's wedding, marking the moment that Minister Scrimgeour was murdered in his office, but living through it feels very different. Pieces fall one at a time, every morning is a new battle, every muttered good morning had an undercurrent of <em>are you still yourself? Did they overpower you on the way home?</em> It's a terrible way to live, afraid and suspicious of every familiar face, and in many ways the most torturous thing about the ministry's fall was how lonely working there was becoming. How every single moment was ruined by fear and thoughts of imminent death.</p><p>Percy hadn't noticed when Pius Thicknesse went down. The Minister knew that <em>someone</em> had fallen, spies had been able to confirm that much, but no one could identify who it had been. It had just left every one of his senior advisors eyeing the others suspiciously, and Rufus had to give in. The scare tactics worked, the paranoia amplifying and suspicions turning to each other, they didn't stand a chance. Percy was almost jealous of Scrimgeour, for getting away. Being murdered in your office wasn’t that bad a way to go.</p><p>The moment that the Minister was down though, there was a little more clarity. Pius Thicknesse? Death Eater, or Death Eater Controlled. Not that it truly mattered which. And after that, the DEs didn't seem to care too much about appearances. Sure, they were careful not to use those <em>exact</em> words, they couched the new ministry policies in formal language that thinly veiled their intentions, but for all intents and purposes, the Ministry at that point was undeniably taken. Percy wrote up his reports, and submitted them, as usual, to Oliver Wood and Credence Summerbee. And for the first time since he ran away from his family to become a spy for the Order, he wished that he hadn't been so quick to put himself in danger. Living this way was exhausting.</p><p>"But who will protect the protectors?" he says to himself as he goes home one day. He'd seen his father in the elevator that morning and been careful not to meet his eyes. Everything was too dangerous.</p><p>Three months later, long after Arthur gave up on work and vanished into the night (he wasn't alone, the Ministry had a 5% truancy rate, and it was increasing as time passed on. Percy had proved himself with the previous two regimes, however, and so he was safe even when others weren't. Part of it was that he was competent, and even though governing wasn't the primary motive of the DEs, they still needed to keep the Ministry running at basic efficiency. Percy imagined the horrific amount of work that would be required to put the Ministry to rights when the war was over (when, not if. When, or Percy would slit his own wrists in the night) and did as much as he could. A bit more organization now, a few meaningful interdepartmental notes to the right people, and something could be saved. Anything was worth it.</p><p> </p><p>It almost works, they almost overlook him, he treats Thicknesse with as much respect as he ever showed Fudge (though less than Scrimgeour, the man was irritated by such things). And then he catches the wrong person's eye. Yaxley’s promotion to the Head of the DMLE when he was a known Death Eater, had just about broken Percy’s heart, but fortunately the man did little work, preferring to delegate and stroll around the Ministry as he pleased. Percy had already informed the Order that Yaxley might be the one pulling Thicknesse's strings, and he makes up his mind to reiterate that belief in his next briefing. Outwardly, he's looking through the Minister's personal finance report, signing away hundreds of galleons on obviously fake requests with an air of concentration when he feels eyes looking at him. When he looks up, it's Yaxley.</p><p>I'm dead, he thinks. Horrified. How could he have known? But Yaxley just gives him a strange, thorough look, and walks away. Percy stares in horror for a few moments, then returns to his work. He doesn't know if he'll live to see this evening, but crying about it wouldn't change anything. He works carefully until seven, his usual exit-time, carefully packs up and heads home. His heart pounds loudly and noisily all the way.</p><p>Nothing happens, and Percy is left confused and worried. What could he have done to get Yaxley's attention?</p><p> </p><p>He's wary for the rest of the week, but there's only so much panic a mind can take over the ever-present panic of working for dark, murderous wizards who want to kill half your family, so Percy lets it slide away. He's in Thicknesse's office, taking a stack of confidential files that need to be taken to the department heads personally when Yaxley turns up to meet Thicknesse. "Let me help you with that," he says, almost solicitously, and Percy shakes his head. "No, sir, I'm sure you have something important to discuss with the Minister, I'll just be leaving..." he says, but Yaxley says, "Nonsense. Pius can wait for me, can't you man?" The Minister nods happily, perfectly content to nod at this man who Percy has HEARD him denounce not a full year ago. (Definitely Yaxley, he files away in his mind. He's lucky he let the Order know, he doesn't think he has much time left.) But Yaxley takes half the files from him and holds the door open for him. To Percy's surprise he makes small talk all along the length of the building, some (rather nasty) jokes about blood purity, but one or two that are actually funny enough that he would have laughed. Gallows humor, maybe. And then Yaxley walked him back to his office, bid him a good day, and left.</p><p> </p><p>Percy wasn't murdered on the way home that day, either.</p><p> </p><p>Yaxley turns up to talk twice more the next day, and the day after that, he asks Percy to dinner. <em>This time I'm dead</em>, Percy thinks. Perhaps Yaxley had only been checking his daily routine so they could let someone else take his place after they shipped him to Azkaban. Dinner is at a small place on Diagon alley, one of the few places still open after dark these days. The original owners had been muggleborn or muggle-sympathizers, so Percy suspects the establishment had... violently acquired new management.</p><p> </p><p>Dinner is oddly pleasant, until, over dinner, Yaxley offers him his hand. Percy stares at him, and he laughs, tipping his head back. "Would you take my hand, Mr. Weasley? " Percy think's he's red from mortification, two of the other patrons in the building leave mid-meal, clearly worried for their safety.</p><p>"Mr. Yaxley. I'm not. I think you misunderstood..."</p><p>Yaxley makes a disappointed noise. "Mr. Weasley, <em>really</em>. Do you think I can't tell a shirt-lifter when I see one?" The hand is still there on the table, palm up, and there's something sharp in Yaxley's eyes now, so Percy reaches out and sets his hand in his. Who smiles. "Quite old fashioned, aren't you Mr. Weasley. Or just shy, after all, you are quite young, yet." God, he's only twenty-one. He's never even had a boyfriend, just two girlfriends. And one had been a high school romance.</p><p>Percy continues the meal in silence, doesn't react to Yaxley's further attempts at conversation. The slow, creepy strokes of Yaxley’s thumb over Percy's hand and wrist the only thing Percy can think about for the rest of the evening. His hand is shaking finely, something he's hyper-aware of because of the way it rubs against the other man's hand. Whenever he chances a look at Yaxley he looks so self-satisfied, like he’s about to eat him whole.</p><p>When Yaxley finishes eating, and finally releases Percy's hand, it's all Percy can do not to run for it. He offers to pay, but Yaxley says it's on him (he doesn't pay either, and no one complains) and then they step out into the cool night air. "Thank you," Percy tells him. Hoping that this is over.</p><p>"You are quite the little tease, aren't you?" he asks. Steps in close. "Blushing so prettily all through dinner and now you're trying to leave?" Percy is tall but Yaxley is just a shade taller, possibly because of the boots, and he leans into Percy's ear. "Please come home with me darling. Just for the night."</p><p>And Percy hasn't. He hasn't not with <em>anyone</em>, but he can't say no. For a moment, he can't say yes, either, taking a moment to just breathe.</p><p>"Come on, Darling." A hand at his waist, slipping towards his back. "I've waited more than a week, I've bought you <em>dinner</em>. You wouldn't want me to tell Pius how naughty you are, do you? Trying to seduce an important ministry official, tsk tsk." And Percy can either blow his cover, prove himself not to be the career-obsessed moron that everyone thinks he is, or he can give in and accompany Yaxley home.</p><p>"Okay, I'll come with you," he says.</p><p>"<em>Attaboy</em>," Yaxley whispers in his ear, breathily, the sensation making the hair on his neck stand on end, and then there's a <em>twist</em> and they're no longer in Diagon Alley, they're in a well-lit flat somewhere. The curtains are open but it's dark enough that all Percy can see in the window is his own. pale face, and Yaxley's back. "I knew you'd be impressed," the man says, leaning in and kissing Percy on the lips.</p><p>Kissing...Kissing Percy has done, and he knows it well enough to kiss back, he takes the nibbling in stride and doesn't choke when a tongue pushes deeper into his mouth. Yaxley's <em>hands</em> though, they wander downwards, to his lower back and lower, cupping his ass through his formal robes, and finally <em>kneading</em>, and he breaks the kiss with a gasp.</p><p>Yaxley looks at him then, his face radiating smugness as he grins. "You're brave. Gryffindor in school, weren't you?"</p><p>"Yes, sir," Percy whispers.</p><p>A hand cups his cheek, a thumb dragging possessively over his mouth, "And quite clever too. 12 Owls, and 10 Newts, isn't it?"</p><p>"Yes. Yes sir."</p><p>"Beautiful. So you know, don't you Percy. You know that I'm a Death Eater, and the Dark Lord has returned?" He can't answer, he's frozen in terror, and Yaxley laughs. "You don't have to answer. I <em>know</em> that you know. That's what makes this so... appealing. You're terrified, because you know what I am. What I can do, to anyone that I choose."</p><p>He holds out an arm. "Pull up my sleeve." When Percy doesn't react, he says again. more harshly, "Now." And he does, slides shaking fingers under the emerald green sleeve, pushing it up over Yaxley's arm, fingers dragging on skin until the dark mark, black and livid burned into his flesh is visible.</p><p>Percy has seen drawings, and photographs never has he seen one in person. It's hideous, and terrifying. Oh god, what was he going to do.</p><p>"And now you don't have to say anything at all. Isn't that wonderful?" asks Yaxley. Without warning he leans back in, kissing Percy with abandon though this time Percy's too shocked, too much in terror to even pretend to reciprocate.</p><p>"Pay attention, Mr. Weasley," I'd hate to punish you for ignoring me. "Now, tell me. What am I?"</p><p>Percy swallows. Not sure what's going to happen now. "Death Eater…sir."</p><p>"Very good. And do you know what Death Eaters do to gorgeous little blood traitors?" Percy shakes his head no. "We fuck them, Mr. Weasley. We fuck them, and they keep their precious little blood traitor mouths <em>shut</em>," he kisses Percy again, deep, with teeth. "Or they just don't turn up for work the next morning."</p><p>Percy's trembling outright now, can feel himself shivering in Yaxley's grasp and the man lowers his head onto Percy's shoulder, tucks his lip against Percy's skin and says, "You can try to run if you want."</p><p>One of his hands slowly trails down the front of Percy's robes, tugging at the collar then down, brushing over his chest and stomach to stop right above his belt. "I'd give you sixty seconds before I curse you." Percy shakes his head. "Excellent," and then Percy's robe is undone, pushed over his shoulders and twisted - effectively trapping his arms against his sides - and he's pushed back against the couch.</p><p> </p><p>He's heard of this happening, more often to young witches than young wizards, but it's still shocking, still vile and unpleasant as Yaxley works him over, taunts and teases him as he takes his pleasure from Percy, doing as he likes.</p><p>Finally, when Yaxley is spent, he collapses on top of Percy, his hands casually around Percy's throat, stroking. "How would you like to do this again?" he asks.</p><p><em>You mean you're not going to slit my throat.</em> Percy very nearly says but swallows it down. "When I next request your presence, you <em>will</em> come to me," Yaxley says, and it's a threat, a warning, and Percy nods. "Then get out," he says, and Percy stands up and spins in place. With a crack he collapses on the hard floor of his own flat, shaking and shaking and <em>shaking</em> until he's exhausted enough to fall asleep right there. He wakes up around 3 am, stiff and aching and still filthy. He takes a scalding shower, then goes to his room and prepares as comprehensive a report as he can about the current state of the ministry and sends it in.</p><p>Then he goes and takes another shower. It doesn't make him feel any better.</p>
