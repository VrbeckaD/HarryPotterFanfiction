</p><p><strong>Snow</strong>: So, Lissa and I decided it would be fun to bring you all together for a little discussion about Master Mine.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Lissa</strong>: Yes. It seems the readers are divided on just where this story should go and just who Hermione will end up with. We thought it might be fun to hear your thoughts on the matter.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Snow</strong>: So, Hermione, let's start with you. What insight can you offer the readers?</p><p> </p><p><strong>Hermione</strong>: Honestly, it's just all so exhausting. One minute, I'm just trying to use the loo and the next minute I'm inducted into this covert sexual cult that I never knew existed. I'm being spanked by Severus, then I'm fucking Lucius, and the next thing you know I'm in a con non-con scene with Draco! And let's not forget the scene with Rose and Etan! Then I'm <em>fucking</em> Severus…and wow. Oh, but it doesn't end there… next I'm with Charlie. Then I'm back with Lucius – repeatedly – and he's making my eyes cross. It's a wonder I can even walk with all the sex you two are obsessively writing! I mean – really! I thought you were <em>nice. </em>But you're actually quite deviant and sex obsessed in my opinion.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Draco</strong>: Ohhh, waa, waa, waa. Honestly Granger. Only you would complain about being the lead role in an awesome story where you're the hottest witch around. Lavender would have <em>killed</em> for this role!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Lissa:</strong> How about it Draco? Where do you see this story going?</p><p> </p><p><strong>Draco</strong>: It's so obvious. The most popular Granger pairing in fanfiction is Dramione. Snow and Lissa want this story to be a huge success, so <em>clearly</em> that's their ending.</p><p> </p><p>

    <em>Dark eyes are staring at Draco from the corner of the room where our wizard in black in leaning against the wall. </em>
  </strong>
</p><p> </p><p><strong>Snape: </strong>Yes, Draco. Continue to delude yourself. It's all so obvious. From the beginning there has only really been one wizard for the leading witch.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Snow: </strong>So, you feel it will be you then, Snape?</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>Snow slightly sinks into her chair as the piercing obsidian eyes land on her</em>
  </strong>
  <strong>. </strong>
</p><p> </p><p><strong>Snape: </strong>Obviously. Clearly you would have been sorted into Ravenclaw, Snowblind. Your intuitive powers of deduction are astounding.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>Lissa snorts.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p> </p><p><strong>Lissa: </strong>What about Lucius, Snape? Don't you think he has a fair shot at the maiden?</p><p> </p><p><strong>Snape <em>eyebrows raised</em>: </strong>Maiden? What maiden? I had sensed that you were the intelligent one. Clearly, I was mistaken.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Lucius:</strong> You have no subtlety, Severus. It's quite apparent Snow and Lissa have intended that I will be the one to woo Hermione in the end. Unlike your prickly and difficult character, I am considerate and kind. <em>And</em> I share Hermione's love of Muggle pizza. I have also provided her with more orgasms than any other character in the story.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Snape: </strong>It's not about <em>quantity</em> but quality, Lucius. Our writers are clearly saving the best for last.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Mistress M: </strong>Ohh, boys! I hope your fragile egos aren't too wounded when the story has the best ending possible. She winds up with <em>me</em>, of course!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Hermione<em> gasps and dives behind Lissa and Snow in horror:</em></strong> Did I say you were mean? I didn't mean it! I meant wonderful, perfect, and stunningly gorgeous. Both of you!</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>Silence for a moment, all eyes on Hermione.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p> </p><p><strong>Hermione <em>whispering</em>:</strong> She's terrifying.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>Laughter at Hermione's expense.</em>
