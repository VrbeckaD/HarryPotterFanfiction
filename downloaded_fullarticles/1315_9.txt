    <p>
  <span>The first thought that came to Tom Riddle’s mind was that she was too thin. Her collarbones were prominent, bulging against the brown skin that seemed stretched over her bones too thin. Her eyes were hungry, and it was almost confronting to see the look in her eyes that looked so similar to the one he saw when he looked into the mirror.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His second thought was that she had just walked into Riddle Manor, wand in hand, without triggering a single one of his wards. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, do put it down, Tom,” the woman said with an air of nonchalance, waving a hand dismissively. Her voice was warm, as if they were old friends simply meeting for a chat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom’s wand hand didn’t waiver. “Who are you?” He asked, his voice calm despite the fact that he was starting to feel an inkling of dread without knowing exactly why.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her full lips, painted red, pulled into a smirk. “I’m either your best friend,” she said, a little breathlessly perhaps, “Or your worst enemy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom didn’t hesitate. A flash of red leaving his wand in an instant only to be battered away like an annoying fly by the woman. “Really?” She said with a sigh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had stepped back in shock at how easily his Dark curse had fallen away from her without even as much of a hint of a shield. “Who are you?” He asked again, insistence in his tone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The woman stepped forward towards him, and he seemed frozen in his place as she moved. “My name-” </span>
  <em>
    <span>Closer</span>
  </em>
  <span>. “-is Hermione,” she said, stopping just a foot away from him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had never felt so -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lost.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>No.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Useless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was frozen in his place while she - </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hermione </span>
  </em>
  <span>stood infront of him, so close he could count her lashes, that he could share her breath, that he could feel -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was in his mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He snarled. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Get out!” </span>
  </em>
  <span> He hissed, snapping out of the stupor she seemed to have him under. He moved swiftly, hissing out a smile that hit Hermione, sending her hurtling across the living room and into an armchair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another spell left his lips, wrapping ropes around the woman as she lay on the carpet and pulling her into an upright position. She had become undone, her curly hair had fallen out of the tight bun she had and fell onto her face. Her body was shaking and Tom thought she could be crying until she raised her head and caramel brown eyes met his.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was laughing, eyes full of mirth and humour as if they had just shared a joke rather than an assault taking place. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Who </span>
  </em>
  <span>was this woman?!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He grasped her chin in his hand, jerking her head harshly towards him. Her laughter cease.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who are you!” He seethed, teeth grinding as his nails left crescent marks against her dark skin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why don’t you have a look?” She whispered, baring her teeth at him like some sort of animal. Tom faltered for a second before plunging himself headfirst into her mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Merlin.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Pain. Unmentionable pain filled him to the core - </span>
  <em>
    <span>“CRUCIO!” </span>
  </em>
  <span>His body, no </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span> body, shaking as the curse burst through her body. Eyes blurry as he stared up at a woman with mad eyes, black curls falling onto his face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then the next second, he was in an open courtyard at Hogwarts, staring across at a figure in the distance, leading a group of masked people. He felt his stomach churning as the figure approached, a tall skeletal figure with pale white features. He didn’t even look human, with his nose just slits against his face and a pale, bald head.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Harry Potter is dead!” </span>
  </em>
  <span>The voice rang in his Tom’s dead, the raspy laugh like a bell tolling at the highest possible volume. Tom’s hands blocked his ears, the pain wrecking through his body.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He forced his mind out of the witch’s, stumbling back as if she had pushed him. But she sat still, a smirk upon her lips as she stared him down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom steadied himself, lip curling as he feigned indifference. “What was that?” He demanded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is your future,” she said, “And I hold it in my hands.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stiffened. The skeletal figure was… him? It couldn’t be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I could give you all that you want,” Hermione said softly, her expression earnest. “You went down a path that ruined you, and now I can help you take the better path where you will rule.”</span>
</p><p> </p>
