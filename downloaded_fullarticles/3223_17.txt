    <p>Zacharias awake to the sound of flapping wings, raising his head, he spotted an owl was perched on his headboard. Rolling his eyes, he slumped face down into his pillow, his eyes heavy with sleep. It had been a very long week and he felt entitled to a lie in. This was the start of his weekend off and he intended to make the most of it.</p><p>Wanting to redeem himself and his family’s pride, Zacharias had signed himself up to auror training. It had been hard, shaking of the ‘coward’ comments thrown his way because he hadn’t stayed to fight. Over time, Zacharias had proven himself to be capable in battle, a smart fighter and one of the best trackers in the auror department.</p><p>Training had improved him so much, he hardly recognised the man he had become. He had just graduated from trainee to auror when it had happened. <em>The Downfall of Harry Potter.</em> The memory of still made him feel sick. The murders. The blood. The denial of guilt. Zacharias had only seen Harry once during that time. His former school mate had been shouting incoherently, his eyes bloodshot as he had been dragged into courtroom 10. He had been very grateful that he hadn’t been assigned to <em>that</em> case.</p><p>The owl screeched at it him, indignant at being ignored. Swearing to himself, he pulled his mind away from the memories of the past and raised his head again. The owl seemed familiar, the brown speckles around it’s eyes ringing alarm bells in his head. He glared at the bird, giving it the stink eye. The bird looked unimpressed and stuck a foot out. Zacharias blinked, his tired brain trying to put the pieces together.</p><p>He bolted upright. Brown speckles. Shit. Rubbing the sleep from his eyes he sat up. Praxidike his boss’s owl looked down at him disapprovingly. Yawning, Zacharias took the letter from the owl’s leg and shook it open. All colour drained from his face as read the letter.</p><p>
  <em>“Come into the office immediately. A high security prisoner has escaped from Azkaban. Tell no one.”</em>
</p><p>He quickly got dressed, shoving his robes over his head in a rush. His mind whirled with names, trying to figure out which of the high security prisoners could have escaped Azkaban. The Prophet would have a field day if this got out.</p><p>He hesitated by the kitchen, the idea of grabbing something to eat tempting, but then the image of his boss sending him a screaming howler, telling him to a bloody move on came into his mind and he thought better off it. Better not piss the boss off anymore than she was going to be.</p><p>When he finally made into the Auror department, he was shocked to find it quiet. The skeleton staff that covered the weekends were still drifting in. Some called out to him as he walked down the corridor, no one looked worried.</p><p>As he walked he passed his own office, filled with maps and charts as he and his partner chased surviving Death Easters across the world to bring them to justice.</p><p>He knocked softly on the door to Perks’ office. She answered with a trite ‘enter.’ He let himself in and raised an eyebrow at his partner, Terry Boot.</p><p>Sally-Anne Perks leaned against her desk, looking decidedly unhappy. At 5’11 she cut a striking pose as she strode confidently through the halls of the Ministry. Tipped for Minster of Magic, she was one the most popular department heads in decades.</p><p>Zacharias quite liked Perks’ office. It as a decent size and full of bookcases. On the desk sat a pink glittery skull, it served as both a warning as a quill holder. Sally-Anne Perks may have been a woman, but she was a scary woman that had dedicated her life to her career.</p><p>Sally-Anne twirled an idle lock of red hair around her fingers, a clear sign on annoyance. “<em>Finally</em>,” she muttered and flicked her long braid over her back. “Make sure that door is closed, Smith.”</p><p>Zacharias double checked at sat in the only unoccupied chair. “This stays between the three of us. No one else knows. We are going to do this quietly and quickly, understand?”</p><p>Zacharias locked eyes with Boot and then nodded.</p><p>Perks closed her eyes, anger clear on her face. “Potter has escaped.”</p><p>“Fucking hell,” Zacharias hissed. “He was had the highest level of security!”</p><p>“How the fuck did he get out? We snapped his wand!”</p><p>“Boys please! Sit down.” Sally-Anne was glaring at them, blue eyes flashing in warning. Zacharias blinked, unaware he had even stood. Embarrassed he sat back down. Sally-Anne snorted “This is why I want you two to find him, you aren’t his <em>fans</em>,” She sneered at the word like it had personally offended her “So you won’t get taken in by his lies.”</p><p>“I’ll bring the little shit in,” Zacharias spat. It was bad enough that Potter wasn’t executed, but to have the nerve to escape? Zacharias would enjoy dragging Potter back into Azkaban.</p><p>“As for how, it seems he tricked on of the guards into opening the door for some reason and seized his chance. The guard was obliviated and demoted.”</p><p>“We should start in Azkaban, see if we can’t work out where he’s headed and why.” Terry said, sounding just as furious as Zacharias felt.</p><p>“Remember to report in every day. I want to know every single step you take and remember, the longer he is out there, the more trouble he is going to cause. <em>Find him quickly</em>.”</p><p align="center">~*~</p><p>Harry moved around he dusty shop, opening boxes at random, uncaring of how much noise he made. He needed a wand and he needed one fast. He was never going to survive long without one.</p><p>He swore as a box slipped through his cold hands, <em>fuck it.</em> He really needed to stop dropping the bloody things, it was only going to slow him down.</p><p>Someone moved behind him and he spun, green eyes ablaze, a curse ready of his lips. He could perform wandless magic, but it was drain on his magical core, so he needed to do it as little as possible. Hopefully the sight of him would send most people running.</p><p>“Harry Potter,” A dry old voice said. Stepping closer, Harry could make the figure of an old ally.</p><p>“Hello, Ollivander, sorry to break in but I need a wand.”</p><p>Ollivander studied Harry for a long moment, before beckoning the boy deeper into the store. “I made you a wand during the war in case you ever needed it.”</p><p>Harry followed hesitantly, aware that this could be a trap, or worse. Ollivander stopped midway down a corridor, in front of a stack old worn looking boxes. The older man pulled a box from the middle of the stack. Ollivander handed the box to Harry, who took it gingerly. “</p><p>Acacia wood, 11 inches, flexible. The core is unicorn hair.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Harry picked the wand up and it warmed under his touch. “I can’t pay you.” Harry gently ran a hand over the new wand, the light brown wand shone in the darkness of the shop. Harry gently brought it down and it sent of a shower of gold sparks. At least Azkaban hadn’t taken his magic from him.</p><p>“I wouldn’t worry about that right now,” Ollivander turned his big unsettling eyes into Harry. “I would just go, before you’re discovered.”</p><p>Harry nodded and fled.</p><p align="center">~*~</p><p>In the years since the final battle, the wizarding world had started to listen to the fallen hero Dumbledore. The dementors had been removed from Azkaban, replaced with highly trained guards. Zacharias hated being on the island the housed the giant building. The place reeked of misery. He slipped slightly as he walked up the wet stone path. The Azkaban guards greeted him and Terry who once a few paces behind him.</p><p>“This way.” The guard looked unhappy, a scowl on his face as he led the two Aurors to Potter’s now empty cell.</p><p>They climbed down into the dark recess of the prison. Doors lined the hallways, sobs could be heard coming from a few but Zacharias ignored it. If they ended up in this hell hole they had done something terrible and deserved to be here.</p><p>Potter’s cell door had been left ajar. Terry stepped close and peered in. “How long has he been gone?”</p><p>The guard shrugged. “A day maybe longer. We only check the cells down here a twice a week.”</p><p>“Idiots!” Zacharias shouted and got into the guard’s face “You should be checking every <em>hour</em>. I don’t care how weak they seem; these scumbags are here for a <em>reason</em>.”</p><p>“Smith come here.”</p><p>Glaring at the moronic guard, Zacharias stepped into the cell. The stink hit him first and he gagged, his eyes watering. “Merlin.”</p><p>Eyes adjusting to the scene, he could make out a pile of rags that ran along the farthest wall from the door, that must have been Potter’s bed. The cell was more or less empty. Pieces of food littered the floor, taking a closer look the food seemed rotten and mouldy. A pitcher of water laid on the side close to the centre of the room. Zacharias pulled his wand out and lifted the pitcher up – it was dry. Looking around the room, he couldn’t find another pitcher. He placed the pitcher down, his brow knotting together. He had never liked Potter and he had been the loudest at the trail to sentence him to death, but – if the wizarding world was going to insist on letting Harry live, then they could at make sure he was getting fresh food and water.</p><p>He walked carefully over to Terry, trying not t think about where Harry pissed. Gagging is disgust Terry pointed a finger to back wall. It was covered in human faeces. Zacharias turned away, fighting down the urge to vomit.</p><p>Eyes turned back to grime covered stone, he spotted faint white lines that he hadn’t seen earlier. He walked over and crouched down to get a better look.</p><p>“What do you think of this?” He asked Terry who came over to look.</p><p>The guard shifted uneasily. “We sometimes give him chalk,” the man huffed red faced “He’s not usually a bother.”</p><p>The two aurors glared at him for a second before looking back at the marks. “It’s names,” Terry reeled back in horror. “Look – ‘Hermione’, ‘Ron’, ‘Ginny’ – it’s the names of the victims.”</p><p>They made detailed notes of the floor, now they knew what to look for. Form Potter’s bed of rags to the door, the names of the victims had been etched all across the floor. It was sickening.</p><p>“It’s like he gets of on it.” Zacharias felt bile rise in this throat. Potter was truly disgusting. He ran a hand through his short hair. “We should probably start looking round the isle for clues. He’s been locked up for five years, he won’t be strong enough to get far.”</p><p>Terry stood from where he was looking at another name. (‘Teddy’) “Right, we should owl Perks too, she’s gonna lose her shit.”</p><p align="center">~*~</p><p>Harry climbed into the small hole in the roof, it wasn’t much, but it was enough to keep the rain off him. He had found it a few hours ago. The crawlspace was above the roof on a out of business shop, but still, he had to be careful. Now he had a wand, he could at least cook the food he found. Pulling out two dead rats, he conjured a fire to cook them on.</p><p>“Rats Harry? How pathetic.” Voldemort sneered at him from the corner of roof. Harry ignored him. Voldemort had been trailing his every move for months now and Harry was well used to the man’s comments.</p><p>“Now, Tom, it can’t be helped,” Dumbledore came to his defence and Harry looked up to the smiling face of his mentor. Dumbledore was draped in pale blue robes embodied with different phases on the moon. Everything from Dumbledore’s buckled boots to his half moon speculates made Harry feel calmer and safer. “You can’t stay here for long, Harry.”</p><p>Harry sighed, Albus was right. He couldn’t stay still for long, he had people to defeat and perhaps members of the old Order to find and regroup.</p><p>“I’ll move on before dawn breaks.” Harry informed his two companions. “The aurors must know by now I’m not in Azkaban anymore.” Having aurors out looking for him was going to slow things down, considerably. He didn’t have time to deal with even more people tracking his movements, having Dumbledore and Voldemort follow him around was already distracting enough.</p><p>Voldemort sneered down at Harry “You think you can out run aurors? In your state? You couldn’t even go a round with my Death Eaters.”</p><p>“Shut up.” Harry told the Dark Lord sternly. He took the rat of the fire. Blowing on it to cool it down, he took a bite. “This is all your fault anyway you know.”</p><p>“Absolutely,” Voldemort agreed dryly “I made you escape and live of rats.”</p><p>They glared at each other for a moment until Dumbledore chuckled, he was sitting in the corner knitting what looked like a poncho. “Look at you too, it’s just like old times!”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes, just like old times, indeed.</p>
