    <p>“Wait, did you check the definition on page 204?”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, I did, Brother, but this one here seems way more accurate...”</p><p>“But that part about how the soul stays anchored is only mentioned in the next chapter on!”</p><p>“But the prompt wasn’t to go in detail about. It was just to discuss how the classification of a being as Living Dead isn’t actually a paradox, Brother.”</p><p>“I-... well... yeah, but, this answer’s way cooler...”</p><p>“<em>Brother.” </em></p><p>Roy smiled fondly, marking a correction on the next line on the essay before him, and found himself relieved that his back was turned, so he wouldn’t have to hide the smile from the boys.</p><p>He’d asked for a simple essay on definition of Living Dead just to get his first years thinking about the topic, to serve as a nice introduction into his vampire unit next week. Somehow, he got the feeling Ed was going to hand in a ten page, seventh-year level analysis on the mechanics of a soul in undead creatures- and with a more put together argument than his most advanced class could handle.</p><p>That boy was going to sleep through his classes for the next six years and probably still graduate with the highest N.E.W.T.s in history, he thought mournfully.</p><p>It was one of the reasons he allowed Ed and Al to work together like this, even though it was technically considered cheating. At first, he’d tried to remind Ed that it really wasn’t the best idea to work so openly with his brother like this when they practically lived with their professor- but it had quickly become apparent that Ed really didn’t need to cheat. And neither did Al, actually, despite the fact that the child was not yet attending classes. <em>Quite </em>the contrary. He was pretty sure Al could already crush the theoretical exams just as handily as Ed was, and really didn’t even want to think what would happen next year, when the kid finally got himself a wand of his own.</p><p>More to the point, when Roy had seen how much fun the two had working together like this, he just hadn’t had the heart to try and separate them.</p><p>Not that he would ever say as such out loud, of course.</p><p>However, all good things <em>did </em>have to come to an end, and he cleared his throat just as he sensed another argument coming, marking the grade down on the paper before him with a flourish. “As much as it does a teacher’s heart good to see you two so passionate about your... er, Ed’s assignment...” he announced, turning around in his seat, “it’s almost midnight. And that paper isn’t even due until next <em>Tuesday</em>. Off to bed, you two.”</p><p>The pouts he got were very nearly heartbreaking. Merlin's sake, it should have been <em>illegal,</em> the way they were looking at him now.</p><p>“But...” Al lifted one of the thick books up off the floor, his eyes big and wide and long-suffering like he’d just been asked to submit to torture. “But, Professor, we only just started!”</p><p>Ed frowned where he lay, sprawled on his stomach just like his brother, legs in the air and splattered with ink. This pout, too, was criminal in its cuteness. God, he really hadn’t signed up for this. “Yeah, Mustang, how come we have to go to bed if you’re not? Why do you get to stay up past midnight but we don’t?”</p><p>He rolled his eyes, again making a shooing motion with his hand. “Because I’m not a growing boy anymore, and yet you two are. Or, Al is. I’m not so sure you’ll ever actually grow, if you don’t start drinking your milk, Ed.”</p><p>Cute pout, on cue, transformed, Ed’s eyes widening as he was overtaken with red-faced, spluttering rage. In an instant he was on his feet, waving his fists in the air as he launched forward, and Roy had to muffle his snicker as he watched Al give only a half-hearted tug at his brother’s ankle, trying to stop the crazy midget from attacking him with no success. “<em>Who are you calling so short-“</em></p><p>“To <em>bed</em>,” he interrupted, grinning again. “Come on.” He stepped carefully over the mess of books on the floor, knowing Al would clean them up later, and gestured for Ed to follow him, heading towards the door. “Come on. I’ll walk you back to your dormitory.”</p><p>Once again, he was ready for the pouts he got in answer, but these were less amusing than before- and instead made up the difference, in being entirely more heartbreaking. Al just looked down at the pile around him, his shoulders slumping a little but but any protests or complaints perfectly silent. He was ready and waiting to give Ed a weak smile when his brother looked back at him, putting on the very best facade that he could so as to not worry them- but Roy had learned to read the misery in those eyes, and as for Ed... well, there <em>was</em> no fooling Ed.</p><p>Al didn't want him to go.</p><p>Roy's heart sunk.</p><p>Yeah, he already could tell how this was going to end.</p><p>“Aw, Mustang,” Ed started to beg after a moment, but again, there was a light of real need in his eyes that just hadn’t been present before. “Come on. That’s so far away from here, and like you said, it’s already so late. Can’t I just stay here again? Just for tonight?”</p><p>His heart sunk even more.</p><p>He glanced at Al. Still sitting behind Ed, still looking at the floor, shoulders still slumped. Still, the very picture of misery.</p><p>He sighed, feeling the resistance inside him deflate like Ed had just popped it like a balloon.</p><p>“Well... all right,” he conceded with a mighty sigh, still feigning reluctance. Both brothers positively <em>beamed, </em>and it felt like his heart had been popped with a damn needle<em>. </em>“Just this once,” even though they all knew it was a lie. The beaming smile of relief he won from Al was more than reward enough, by the way it squeezed at him and made him feel almost light- the relieved gratitude in Ed’s eyes, so vivid it was almost painful, was just the cherry on top.</p><p>In short order, Roy had gotten Al scrambling off to his room. It was easy enough, now that the kid knew his brother was staying the night again, though he’d kept Ed with him, under the pretense of cleaning all the books up. He waited until he was sure Al was out of earshot to glance down at Ed, who was avoiding his eyes like he already knew what was coming, and sighed again, this time with exhaustion as he got down on his knees beside him, resting a hand on his shoulder. “Ed.”</p><p>Ed looked away even more severely, his shoulders slumping just like Al’s had. “I know,” he mumbled, hands clenching tightly around one of the many books in his lap. "I... I <em>know, </em>okay?"</p><p>It was hard to say whether he was more angry at Roy for pointing it out- or sad, for his brother.</p><p>Roy sighed gravely again. “What are you going to do if he doesn’t end up in your house next year?” he prodded, though he was sure Ed had already conceived of the problem himself. “You won’t be able to be with him all the time then.”</p><p>“I don’t- I mean- what am I supposed to do? I can’t just say something like that to him!” Ed growled, shaking Roy’s hand off. He started gathering the books together again, far more roughly than was really necessary and glaring hard at the floor. “Why can’t we just stay with you and Hughes like now? Why does it have to change at all next year?”</p><p>“<em>Ed,” </em>he chided gently again, knowing he didn’t need to go beyond that quiet rebuke. Ed was just as aware as he was that that was not a real choice. Al had to learn how to be apart from Ed- and, in some ways, Ed had to learn how to be apart from Al. They had to learn that they were now in a place where it was safe and okay for them to do that. Nothing good would come from him and Hughes continuing to enable Al’s nearly crippling inability to be without his brother... and Ed’s definitely crippling inability to let him at least try.</p><p>No matter how much he was going to hate doing it, he knew that sooner or later, he was going to have to pull those brothers apart. No matter how badly it was going to hurt him to see them miserable, Ed guiltridden and Al frightened- it had to happen. It <em>had</em> to.</p><p>Once again, Ed just glared hard at the floor and continued to stack up the books far rougher than he needed to.</p><p>Until at last, he just stopped.</p><p>As Roy watched, his hard, angry facade began to soften, crumpling gently apart layer by layer like Roy had hit it just in its weak spot and brought it down one by one. The irascible anger that he clung to like a second skin began to slip away, melting down into a fatigued exhaustion so very beyond his years and the painfully vivid, all too color shadow of guilt. "I think it'll be easier, next year, Mustang. Really. I- I do." He pulled his knees up to his chest, books all just spilling weakly out of his hands to thump to the floor as he wrapped his arms around them instead, huddling up on the flagstones and for just a moment, as small as the kid that he was meant to be. His messy, utterly unkempt hair fell over his eyes, and Roy resisted the urge to carefully push it out of the way.</p><p>“Right now, Al's..." he went on quietly, voice dwindling and soft. "He’s just... <em>stuck</em> here all day with nothing to do. He’s not said anything about it- he’s never complained, Al just- just wouldn’t do that- but I... think he's <em>scared. </em>I think he can’t help but worry that I’m... I don’t know, leaving him behind or something. I mean, I get to go off and do all these amazing things every day, and he just... can’t. It makes him nervous. He’s always worried I’m going to leave him for- for something- <em>better.” </em>Ed laughed weakly, shaking his head then like the very idea of something better than his brother existing in this world was ludicrous in it’s impossibility.</p><p>Roy didn’t find it very funny. But, then, he knew Ed really didn’t, either.</p><p>It was also a fair point, and explained why Ed had been going so far out of his way to try and include Al in everything that he could. He and Hughes had <em>tried</em> to argue, multiple times now, for an exception to made for Al, and allow him to enter Hogwarts a year early- god, if there was ever any wizard good enough to handle it, it would be one of the Elric brothers- but the headmaster had refused. The law was absolute, he’d proclaimed. Al just wasn’t allowed a wand until he was eleven, which meant, for the next nine months, Al was still just his unofficial ward, while Ed was a student, and that was final.</p><p>It wasn’t fair, not in the slightest, and Ed had taken up what was likely to become a permanent grudge against their headmaster over it, but there was just nothing Roy could do about it anymore.</p><p>“You’re sure there’s not any way he can at least go to class with me...?” Ed proposed weakly, and his voice was so unbearably hopeful it almost hurt for him to hear it. Roy glanced over to see two bright eyes watching him nervously again, anxious underneath his messy hair, his face a painful cast of already defeated hope. “I <em>know </em>he’d feel so much better if he could. And... and so would I, really... I’d be able to look after him and make sure he was okay all of the time...”</p><p>Sighing, Roy actually did reach over this time, resting a heavy hand on top of his head and gently ruffling his hair.<em> And that’s part of the problem</em>, he thought unhappily, but didn’t say it aloud. “You don’t have to look after him anymore. That’s what I’m here for, you know.”</p><p>But to this, Ed merely slumped into himself even further. He curled up just a little more, so much so now that his face was almost hidden in his knees, and hugged himself even tighter.</p><p>A moment later, he leaned back into Roy's hand, huddling himself up against his side and allowing him to slowly hug him, but even then, he did not un-furl.</p><p>"...but he's still mybrother," he whispered. "He's... he's still <em>my </em>brother."</p>
<hr/><p>When Roy finally got a still downtrodden Ed to go to bed, it was to find Al impatiently waiting for them, already in his pajamas and frowning a little, frowning like he <em>knew </em>something had gone on behind his backs and that he didn’t like it. But Ed was already smiling again, smiling for his sake no matter how surely hard it was for him, and without even the slightest hesitation the little wizard bounced up onto the bed beside his brother and curled around to frown up at him, calm and settled and peaceful again no matter how much tumult and pain was hidden behind his eyes, because he was back with his brother and that was all he needed.</p><p>“To work, Professor!” he proclaimed, beaming, then nudged Al. “Al, make him work. He’s <em>neglecting </em>me. He always listens to you even when he’s ignoring me!”</p><p>Al blinked a little, then just relaxed with a soft smile, seeming to melt into the carefree aura his brother was offering to him like a balm for any wound. He nudged Ed right back, a little more gently, then curled up on his bed himself, almost like a contented cat. “Play nice, Brother... you didn’t even give him a chance, yet.”</p><p>And, there it was. The number one reason why Ed currently terrified all his teachers- but come next year, and Roy was pretty sure Al was going to be melting hearts left and right. “You, Alphonse,” he said, with a pointed glare in Ed’s direction, “are going places. Primarily because you understand the concept of politeness, and manners, and asking nicely. You, Edward, are not. Because you still think the best way to accomplish anything at all is by yelling at people.”</p><p>“Uh, yeah. Because it works on people like you, bastard.” Then he pointed again, making a great show out of getting comfortable while he did it, and looked expectantly up at him.</p><p>Roy sighed.</p><p>Unbelievable.</p><p>“Ten points from Ravenclaw,” he sighed casually, the comment almost a habit by now and returning the eye roll back full force- and then, because as rude as the child was, he was right, he <em>did </em>still have some work to do, he then set about transfiguring Al’s desk back into a spare bed for Ed to use.</p><p>It ended up a little crooked and rickety, he thought, standing back to observe his handiwork, and- ahh. Okay, the sheets had definitely been blue in his mind, but somehow, they had ended up an eyesore of a bright yellow. ...somehow? But, he figured it was close enough for these purposes, and Ed, apparently, did too, when the kid lunged up from Al’s bed to crawl blissfully into his own without sparing the color a single scathing comment, already grabbing for his pillow.</p><p>Roy smirked at the sight. “You know, you two really should hold these late-night homework sessions with Hughes. He’s much better at transfiguration than I am,” he said, though found himself hard-pressed to actually mean it. Hughes had his own child to dote over, his own actual, flesh-and-blood child. He wasn’t about to let Hughes take Ed and Al, too- not when he was truly starting to really enjoy the sight of the two like this, just two little kids crawling into bed and bickering with each other night and day.</p><p>Ed, however, frowned at the mention of the other professor’s name, and Al’s smile slipped a little away, too. “We tried, actually,” the younger brother said, meeting his eyes unhappily. “He kicked us out. Said he was busy tonight.”</p><p>“...Busy tonight?” he murmured, brow furrowing. That didn’t sound like Hughes. Why on earth would he have kicked- oh. <em>Oh. </em>Roy’s eyes widened, and he momentarily cursed himself for being so forgetful. <em>Right, of course... I should’ve realized. He needs all the sleep he can get right now- he’s looked sick this whole week. “</em>I- yes. There’s a- a charms thing. A charms thing coming up, that he has to prepare for. He'll be busy until... early next week, I believe,” he lied, running through the calendar in his mind. <em>That should be enough time...</em></p><p>Regardless of whether it was or not, though, the best thing for this now was just to move on as fast as possible, because Ed and Al were already looking suspicious as it was and it was a little too late at night for Roy to be able to lie smoothly about this. “Now!” He cleared his throat brusquely, getting the two brothers to jump and look back at him. He smiled as broadly as he could, hands on his hips, and nodded down at them in a clear goodnight. “You two: go to bed, and remember, these walls are not soundproof. So if you two start trying to work again, I’ll be able to hear you.”</p><p>Ed, once again, had the gall to look innocent. He actually did try and look completely innocent, just sitting there and blinking up at him like he had no idea what he was talking about. A wide-eyed, big, fat, liar.</p><p>It took just about all of Roy's strength not to roll his eyes.</p><p>And, once again, Al was the one who won Roy’s favor, the younger brother looking properly sheepish and contrite, even adding in a guilty little apologetic wince for effect, then a soft, “Sorry, Professor,” and- oh, hell. There went his heart.</p><p>There it went, even though he already knew Al’s guilt, just as much as Ed’s innocence, was just a show put on to make him feel bad- just... there it went.</p><p>“It’s fine,” he laughed, giving in- and feeling the slightest bit pathetic. He’d already realized a long time ago those two brothers could guilt trip him into next century. It wasn’t their superior acting skills, as he was sure Ed believed, but just the fact that the two little kids could look so sad and pathetic, blinking up at him in misery like asking them to go to sleep was a cardinal sin. God, he was turning into such a sap... as usual, he blamed Hughes. “It’s fine. Just go to sleep tonight for once, would you?” He waited this time, watching as the two actually burrowed down in their beds, already curling up to be close to one another, waited until he could tell they were actually going to go to sleep this time before raising his wand again, waving the lights out. “Good night,” he said quietly into the darkness, and, with nothing more than a weak grin down at the two huddled forms, retreated.</p><p>When he heard the two start up whispering to each other not even a minute after he’d closed the door behind him, Roy just fondly rolled his eyes and kept on working.</p><p> </p>
