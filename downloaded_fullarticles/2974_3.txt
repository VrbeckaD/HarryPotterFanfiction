    <p>“Siri-bear!” you heard in a shrill voice.</p>
<p>“Oh sweet Merlin,” you groaned. “Of all the girls in this school, how do you always find the dumbest –”</p>
<p>“Hush,” Sirius snapped.</p>
<p>“Alright, but I am trying to eat so if I chunder I’m aiming for you.”</p>
<p>“There’s my love bug!” Amelia squealed as she dropped down onto the bench next to Sirius.</p>
<p>“There’s lunch,” you muttered, causing Sirius to elbow you.</p>
<p>“Hello, Amelia,” Sirius said a bit uncomfortably.</p>
<p>“How’s my sweet cuddle bunny?”</p>
<p>“And here comes breakfast,” you snarked.</p>
<p>“Are you ready to head to class, Amelia? I’ll walk you,” Sirius said quickly, wanting to avoid both your comments and you overhearing any more of her nauseating endearments. He shot you a look over his shoulder as he escorted her out of the Great Hall.</p>
<p>“You are so obvious, Y/N,” Remus snickered.</p>
<p>“Hmmm?” you replied, genuinely confused at his comment.</p>
<p>“You never like Sirius’ girlfriends.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Well then yes, I guess I am obvious. He dates twits,” you said with a shrug.</p>
<p>“I mean,” Remus Drew the word ‘mean’ out longer than necessary, “that you never like them because you’re jealous.”</p>
<p>“Are you jesting right now?”</p>
<p>“No. You obviously want him for yourself.”</p>
<p>“You look like Remus, but I’m quite certain he knows the meaning of the word ‘obvious,’” you said speculatively. “Therefore I shall assume that you are someone else who took a Polyjuice potion to pretend to be Remus for some unknown reason. Not bad. You have the obnoxious, know-it-all thing down but Remus has a better vocabulary.”</p>
<p>You got up to go to your class and Remus got up to walk with you.</p>
<p>“Admit it already, you like Sirius! Why else would you always make fun of his girlfriends?”</p>
<p>“Remus, I know this must be difficult for you to understand what with the torch you’ve always carried for him –”</p>
<p>“Oh ha ha,” Remus interrupted.</p>
<p>“But,” you continued loudly, “I am not interested in Sirius. His girlfriends annoy me regardless of whether he’s dating them. They just annoy me more when he is because I have to be around them if I want to be around him. Which I do, because he is my <em>friend.</em>”</p>
<p>“I still think you like him,” he said peevishly.</p>
<p>“You could not be more wrong, Remus,” you said sincerely. “Well…yeah you could be more wrong if you suggested I like Snivellus or Malfoy. But that’s right ‘round the bend to crazy, not just wrong.”</p>
<p>Remus looked at you with narrowed eyes. “There’s something you’re not telling me.”</p>
<p>“Merlin, Remus, there’s loads of things I’m not telling you. Where shall I begin?” you said with a laugh.</p>
<p>“How about with your crush on Sirius.”</p>
<p>“You still on that?”</p>
<p>“I’m convinced,” he said stubbornly.</p>
<p>As the two of you arrived at your class, you said, “Oh, I have a huge crush, but it isn’t on Sirius,” and walked to your table and sat down next to Lily.</p>
<p>Remus attempted to follow you to ask who, but Slughorn gave him a look that made him decide that perhaps it could be settled later. He turned and took his seat at the table diagonal from yours.</p>
<p>A little while later as you were taking notes on the rather complicated potion you were going to brew next, you felt a poke on your shoulder. You automatically turned to see who was behind you and noticed Remus with his wand out, having just used it to poke you, trying to get your attention with an interested James spectating.</p>
<p>“Who?” Remus mouthed.</p>
<p>You gave him a look and mouthed, “What is wrong with you?” which James found to be particularly amusing.</p>
<p>A while later, you headed over to the ingredients cabinet to gather supplies and Remus grabbed your elbow and whispered, “Tell me!”</p>
<p>You looked right and left to see who was around, pulled him a step further away and gestured for him to bend down. Remus did so gladly with a satisfied smile on his face. You then stood on tiptoes, cupped your hand around his ear and whispered, “No.”</p>
<p>He straightened quickly and gave you a dirty look as you giggled and went back to get your ingredients.</p>
<p>“I will find out, Y/N,” he muttered.</p>
<p>“When I’m ready for you to find out, Remus John Lupin, and not a moment before.”</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius caught up with Remus after potions. “What’s wrong with you, Moony? You’ve been in a mood all day long.”</p>
<p>Remus made a face and said, “Oh, Y/N is being mysterious.”</p>
<p>“Y/N is being…mysterious. How so?”</p>
<p>Remus blushed a little and said, “I thought she was always mocking your girlfriends because she likes you. But she told me I couldn’t be more wrong.”</p>
<p>“Me?” Sirius barked a laugh. “Blimey, we’d kill each other. I am definitely not her type.”</p>
<p>Remus stopped walking and after a step Sirius turned to see what happened to him. “Do you know who is her type?” Remus asked him.</p>
<p>“In fact, I do.”</p>
<p>“Who.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, you don’t. Ask her.”</p>
<p>“I have been since lunch. She won’t tell me.”</p>
<p>“Really? Well, you know her as well as anyone.  Who do you think is her type?” With that, Sirius walked away, leaving Remus standing in the middle of the hallway pondering his words.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus became a man possessed. It was as if he was becoming as obsessed as James was about Lily. He took note of anyone you spoke with, especially if you laughed at their joke because you had a particularly dry sense of humor and obvious jokes didn’t always amuse you. Remus knew just how to make you laugh, so if he saw you with someone the right kind of funny he had a chance to be the one.</p>
<p>He took out a piece of parchment at his desk later and started making a list.</p>
<p>Smart. He would also have to be smart. You were bloody brilliant as far as Remus was concerned and he knew that you would need someone who could hold his own in a conversation. How many hours had the two of you spent debating the long-term effects of the goblin war of 1612 or the best way to cast a certain spell?</p>
<p>Tall. He recalled one time you mentioned you liked tall men, so any shorties were right out. You were always hopping on his back for piggyback rides and saying how it’s a good thing he was so tall.</p>
<p>Kind. He’d need to be kind. While you weren’t above the odd prank, you would never be a part of anything mean-spirited. You were always helping firsties who got lost and such. He would definitely need to be kind. You always helped Remus to temper the sometimes rash ideas of the other boys.</p>
<p>Enjoys reading. He would also need to be a reader. You loved nothing more than to discuss a favorite books, spending hours hidden away with one lost in a world within the pages. Remus couldn’t begin to recall all of the times the two of you had found a corner to snuggle up and talk about books.</p>
<p>Supportive. He would need to be supportive, though. You had so much enthusiasm for life. You were a joy to be around and the man for you would need to have the wisdom to understand that your spirit must not be dampened, but always embraced. You weren’t a woman to be controlled but enjoyed. You didn’t need a master, you needed a partner. Remus used to try to protect you from every little thing but had come to realize that you were a strong person. Your gender didn’t define your strength. He now stepped aside until you looked to him for help.</p>
<p>Sensitive. He would need to be sensitive. At times, you could be downright moody. But couldn’t everyone, really? So many times had he been snappish around the full moon, yet you were always understanding when he would become sullen or cranky. You always just handed him some chocolate and held his hand, gently rubbing your thumb across his scarred knuckles.</p>
<p>Dependable. And whomever the lucky guy was would need to be dependable. Nothing upset you more than someone buggering off on plans. Unless Remus was physically ill from a transformation, he was always certain to be there for you. He always relied on you and felt that it was what you needed and deserved.</p>
<p>Remus looked at his list and thought that while there might be more superficial things he could add, like handsome since you were so beautiful, but attractiveness was so subjective. Merlin, you had told him on numerous occasions how handsome he was, and Godric knows he wasn’t with all his scars.</p>
<ol>
<li>Funny</li>
<li>Smart</li>
<li>Tall</li>
<li>Kind</li>
<li>Enjoys Reading</li>
<li>Supportive</li>
<li>Sensitive</li>
<li>Dependable</li>
</ol>
<p>So this was his basic list. He just needed to find someone who fit all if these and he would know who Y/N liked.</p>
<p>James came over to see what Remus was working on so feverishly. Moony was so intent on his list that he didn’t even notice James spying.</p>
<p>James raised his eyebrows to Sirius and he came over to read over Moony’s shoulder as well. In a classic one-two, James distracted Remus and Sirius stole the parchment.</p>
<p>“What is this, Moony?” he asked, though he had a pretty good idea.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing, give it back,” Remus said, making a grab for it as his cheeks flooded red.</p>
<p>“1. Funny. 2. Smart. 3. Tall. 4. Kind.”</p>
<p>“Filling out a personal ad for <em>Witch Weekly</em>, Moony?” James said with a laugh.</p>
<p>“Shut it, Prongs,” Remus said with another swipe at the parchment that Sirius was waving around.</p>
<p>“I think he’s trying to figure out who Y/N fancies,” Sirius said with a sly smile.</p>
<p>James looked genuinely surprised. “Really? Everyone knows, Moony.”</p>
<p>“Well, clearly I don’t!” Remus snapped, grabbing the parchment from Sirius and shoving it in his pocket and stalking to the door to leave.</p>
<p>“You’re definitely on the right track, Moony,” Sirius called after him.</p>
<p>After Remus slammed the door, James looked at Sirius and said, “For a genius, he can really be quite dim.”</p>
<p>“Total shitwit,” Sirius agreed.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>You found Remus leaning against a tree and staring into Black Lake. You walked over and said, “Alright, Moony?”</p>
<p>Remus jumped a bit, so lost in his own thoughts that he didn’t notice your approach. “Oh! Hi, Y/N. I’m alright. How are you?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine. You seem a bit distracted.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess so,” he said, looking down sheepishly and rubbing the back of his neck.</p>
<p>“Wanna talk about it?” you asked.</p>
<p>“Not really,” he said with a small smile.</p>
<p>“Really? I thought we could talk about most anything?” you said, a tiny bit hurt.</p>
<p>“Not this, sorry.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, alright. I guess I’ll leave you to your brooding,” you said, turning to leave.</p>
<p>“Who do you fancy, Y/N?” he blurted out.</p>
<p>You turned slowly back to face him. “That’s what has you so preoccupied? Merlin, Remus, why?”</p>
<p>“I just…need to know.”</p>
<p>“Remus, it’s embarrassing. He doesn’t reciprocate my feelings. I’d rather just get over him.”</p>
<p>“I made a list of qualities I thought you’d like in a man.”</p>
<p>“Really,” you said, shocked that this was so important to him.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said, pulling the parchment from his pocket and showing you.</p>
<p>“This is very accurate, actually. Describes him perfectly. You do know me well, Moony.”</p>
<p>“I can’t think of anyone who fits the description that you ever spend any time with.”</p>
<p>You moved to stand directly in front of Remus and took his hand, looking down at your joined hands for a moment while you gathered your courage. You quickly looked up into his eyes and back down again. “Can’t you, Remus?”</p>
<p>Remus was speechless.</p>
<p>You let go of his hand and cleared the lump from your throat and said, “Anyway, I told you he didn’t reciprocate the feeling. And clearly you don’t.” You turned to walk away before your tears fell and embarrassed you further.</p>
<p>Remus shook himself and grabbed your hand and pulled you into his arms. “Me?” he said with a bit of a squeak.</p>
<p>“You,” you answered quietly, still not meeting his eyes.</p>
<p>Remus gently tipped your head back so he could look into your eyes and said, “I’m not entirely sure this is real, so I’m going to go ahead and kiss you before I wake up.”</p>
<p>You giggled and threw your arms around his neck and he kissed you gently, then with more passion.</p>
<p>When you stopped to catch your breath, he said, “Me?”</p>
<p>You nodded happily and said, “You, Remus. Always you.”</p>
<p>“Then would this be a good time to tell you I love you?”</p>
<p>“I love you, too, Remus.”</p>
<p>He kissed you again, holding you close and marveling that he had everything he ever wanted right here in his arms. You checked off every item on his list.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you fancy me, Y/N,” he said again.</p>
<p>“Obviously,” you said with a wink, then kissed him again with all the love in your heart.</p>
