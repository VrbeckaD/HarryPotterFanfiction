    <p>Albus strode into the dormitory he shared with Scorpius and dramatically collapsed face-first onto his friend’s bed.</p><p>“I have had,” he said, voice muffled by the bedsheets, “the <em> longest </em>day.”</p><p>Scorpius peered down at Albus from behind their dogeared copy of <em> Home Life and Social Habits of British Muggles </em> and raised an eyebrow. “Are you sure, Albus?” they asked. “Because I think you’ll find that today has had the same number of seconds in it as yesterday, and the day before it too, in fact.” </p><p>Albus let out a small huff and rolled onto his back so he could properly look at his friend, lightly flicking their leg in mock annoyance. “You know what I mean, Scorpius.” he said. “We were up at the crack of dawn finishing that Transfiguration essay, and it’s just been non-stop since then. At least you got to relax in your spare periods whilst I suffered through <em> double </em> Care of Magical Creatures - which I will remind you is a very physical endeavour!” Albus, who had risen slightly onto his elbows throughout his exclamation, promptly flopped back down onto the bed in defeat.</p><p>Scorpius laughed softly. “You’ll be okay, Albus. You know we’ve only got a month left until our NEWTs, and then all will be well again.” They shuffled to one side of the bed, putting down their textbook and patting the new space beside them for Albus to crawl up into. “Think of all the freedom we’ll have once we’re done!”</p><p>“Shhh, that’s a banned topic, that is!” Albus exclaimed as he climbed up the bed. “No talk about what we’re doing post-Hogwarts!” Reaching the top of the bed and becoming level with Scorpius, Albus leaned over and rested his head on his friend’s chest, closing his weary eyes. The seventh years didn’t seem to be able to go anywhere these days without someone asking ‘what are you going to do once you finish school?’ and Albus, who didn’t have a clue, found the topic to be very draining. He knew that the one place he wouldn’t be pestered by thoughts of his uncertain future was when he was alone with his best friend - partly because Scorpius knew him so well that they instinctively <em> understood </em>his unease and trepidation, but also because they had made a pact not to talk about it unless the conversation was instigated by Albus himself. At the same time, however, Scorpius was also the only person Albus felt he might be willing to discuss such things with. It was one of the many dichotomous feelings he had regarding his friend.</p><p>“Well, you don’t have to think about what you’re capital-D Doing post-Hogwarts,” Scorpius said, absent-mindedly moving their hand to play with Albus’ hair. “Focus on the little things to get you through: Being able to spend all day out in the sun. Going out at night without needing to be sneaky about it. Going on holidays - oooh!” Scorpius gasped, the sudden motion prompting Albus to open his eyes. “We could go on a holiday!”</p><p>“We could what?”</p><p>“A holiday, Albus, together!” Scorpius was getting rather excited now, and Albus quickly moved himself off their chest to avoid his friend accidentally hitting him in the face whilst gesticulating. “You and I: overage, finished school, no responsibilities - we should go away somewhere! Actually I was just reading about -” they broke off and retrieved the textbook they had discarded only moments before, searching for the right page. “Here!” they said, pointing to a passage halfway down the page labelled <em> Post-High School Traditions of the Teenaged Muggle</em>. “This is actually something that muggles our age often do after they finish school! Friends will go away for a little while, without their parents, as a celebration. Or they might take a ‘gap year’ which means going away for an entire <em> year </em> before coming back to continue on with life - not that I’m suggesting we do that!” they added hastily. “But, well, just because we don’t have a few months of limbo before going off to University like some muggles do doesn’t mean we can’t go on a trip ourselves!” </p><p>Albus had very little idea of what ‘University’ was, but Scorpius’ enthusiasm was infectious, and he found himself nodding along all the same as they continued. “It’s not as if there’s a deadline for when we need to get started on our life after Hogwarts, and after the time we’ve had in the past few years we are well within our rights to take some time to ourselves. I think going on a holiday would give us something really fun to look forward to after exams, don’t you?” </p><p>Too focused on the way Scorpius’ whole face lit up as they spoke so passionately, their eyes widening and dimples crinkling, it took Albus a moment to realise that his friend was waiting for a response as he stared at them with a faint smile. </p><p>“Oh, uh, yes. Yes!” He managed to say. Scorpius’ face, if possible, became even brighter.</p><p>“Yes?” they repeated. Albus nodded eagerly in response. “Oh, wizzo! I know this idea has only been in the air a few minutes but in that time I have grown very fond of it.”</p><p>“It’s a great idea, Scorp.” Albus said encouragingly. “Honestly, I really need something concrete in the next few months to think about other than ‘exams’ or ‘the future’. It’ll help make the days less long.”</p><p>Scorpius gave him a fond smile and wriggled down the bed until they were lying horizontally looking up at the ceiling. The green roof of the Slytherin dormitory was enchanted to show water-like swirls made up of shades of green, with the speed of the swirling mirroring the currents in the lake above them. Albus would often gaze at the patterns for hours at night as he struggled to fall asleep. He found it soothing.</p><p>“Okay,” Scorpius said, once they had settled properly on the bed. “So what should we do? Travel around different places? Touristy things? Relaxation? Skiing? Extreme sports - oh, Albus, we could go skydiving -”</p><p>“Whoa, Scorpius, hold up,” said Albus, who had shuffled down and was now propped up on an elbow next to Scorpius, their faces close together. “Don’t you think we’ve had enough excitement without adding in extreme sports? Besides, I’m sure we could think of a way to use magic to go skydiving right now if you really wanted to, we don’t need a holiday for that.” Albus smiled and lowered himself onto his back, the pair’s shared laughter floating upwards towards the swirling currents.</p><p>“Okay, so no skydiving then,” Scorpius conceded.</p><p>“Relaxation instead?” Albus suggested, turning his head to look at his friend. “Like I said, we’ve had a hectic time at Hogwarts. Could be nice to disappear off to a cabin in the woods in the middle of nowhere and just, like, exist for a week.”</p><p>Scorpius laughed, and the sound made Albus’ heart beat faster. “I support the relaxation, Albus, but I could do without the complete isolation. As lovely as it would be to have no one but you and me for miles and miles, maybe we could go somewhere closer to a town so we can buy food and other supplies if we need to?”</p><p>Albus blushed and pointedly looked back up at the ceiling. “A beach town?” He suggested, and felt Scorpius nod eagerly beside him. “Relaxing, fairly secluded, but with shops in close proximity.”</p><p>“Wonderful - ooh and we’ll be able to swim! Warm beachy waters would definitely beat a dip in the lake with the giant squid,” they said, gesturing above their heads to where said squid was undoubtedly lurking. </p><p>“We should probably venture out of England, then,” Albus remarked, “if it’s beaches we’re looking for.”</p><p>“France?” Scorpius proposed eagerly. “I can speak some French, that would be fun!”</p><p>Albus, who often found his thoughts inexplicably returning to the few times he had heard his friend speak the language, was only too happy to agree. “France sounds wonderful, Scorp,” he said, rolling over onto his side to look at his friend.</p><p>Scorpius hummed in agreement, but their eyes had become unfocused and Albus could tell that something in their conversation had consumed their thoughts. His friend often did this, jumping through ideas at a rapid rate before fixating on one, entering a reverie as they took the time to consider something deeply. Albus reached over and took Scorpius’ hand, brushing his thumb back and forth over their skin as they thought. </p><p>Scorpius eventually spoke, breaking the not altogether uncomfortable silence that had risen between them. “I used to go travelling a lot with Mum and Dad when I was younger,” they said. “Often to France - our family was originally from there - but to other countries, too.”</p><p>Albus nodded and squeezed their hand; it was always a good sign when Scorpius felt comfortable enough to talk about their Mum. </p><p>Scorpius smiled softly. “Mum loved to see new places, and the warmer weather was good for her. Dad was always very happy to join her - I know he liked it more than he let on. I think it helped, y’know? For him to get out of the mansion for a while. But… Mum was never able to travel using magic.” </p><p>As they spoke, Scorpius turned towards Albus and curled up opposite him, so that the two of them were eye to eye. “I told you that she couldn’t apparate, yeah? All that magic messing around with your physical form, it didn’t go well with her condition.”</p><p>Albus, who had not let go of Scorpius’ hand, took the opportunity to lace their fingers together.</p><p>“So that meant that she wasn’t able to floo or use portkeys either,” Scorpius continued. “And brooms were always out of the question - they were too physical - so we would travel the way muggles do: on aeroplanes.”</p><p>Albus’ eyes widened. “I remember my Grandpa mentioning them - aren’t they those huge car-like things muggles somehow fly in?”</p><p>Scorpius laughed softly, releasing some of the weight of the conversation. “Yes, essentially, except they go much faster than cars and they’re more like trains in that they take a few hundred people at once. Most muggles don’t personally own or fly one.”</p><p>Albus shifted his legs to a more comfortable position, inadvertently brushing against Scorpius’. He was about to move them away, but decided against it. “Well, that makes sense,” he said. “I suppose we would know about it if all muggles suddenly developed the means to fly.”</p><p>“That’s true, very true. But yes, when you fly on a plane you just - it’s just gorgeous, Albus,” they confess, eyes alight with wonder. “They take you up far higher than you ever go on a broom, because the air that high gets hard to breathe so you’d need a bubble-head charm - but the muggles have figured out how to get along without all of that, they have this thing called <em> pressurisation </em> where they… anyway.” They broke off sheepishly, but Albus smiled at them. He didn’t mind Scorpius’ tangents - in fact, he found them endearing. </p><p>“You’re so high up that you’re on top of the clouds!” they continued. “And I remember taking planes with Mum and Dad, and the flying was just as exciting as getting to the destination, because it was unlike anything else we had seen. Anyway I-” Scorpius looked off to the side. “I know it’s unconventional and you aren’t the biggest fan of heights and, oh, it would take a lot longer than magical transport but -”</p><p>“Scorpius.” Albus interrupted, tightening his grip on their hand and locking eyes with his friend. “Yes. I would love to take a plane to France with you.”</p><p>“Oh.” A small smile grew on Scorpius’ face. “Well. That’s nice.”</p><p>Albus grinned. “Very nice,” he replied. “So, how do we go about flying by plane? Do we just rock up to the plane station and -” he was interrupted by Scorpius bursting into surprised laughter.</p><p>“<em>Airport </em>, Albus, it’s called an airport!” they exclaimed, their chuckles vibrating across the bed. “Sorry,” they breathed, “there’s no reason why you would’ve known that but, ‘plane station’? Like it’s a train, oh Merlin, I -” they broke off into further laughter, curling their head into Albus’ chest so that he was breathing in their lemon-scented hair, and Albus found himself involuntarily joining in. Scorpius’ mirthful joy was always so infectious, especially when it mirrored the warmth he felt at having his friend so close to him.</p><p>“Okay, so when we go to the <em> airport </em> ,” he teasingly emphasised as Scorpius recovered, relaxing onto their back, “the <em> airport </em>that is not a plane station, is it similar to a train station at least? Do we buy tickets to get on the plane, or?”</p><p>Scorpius hummed endearingly as they considered this. “I always remember having the tickets ready to go when we arrived there,” they said. “I don’t know how we got them though? Maybe Mum and Dad had to post in a form or something. I’ll owl Dad tomorrow and ask!” </p><p>Brightening further at the thought of communicating with their Dad, Scorpius reached over to their bedside table where Albus knew they kept a meticulous to-do list, and rummaged for a quill. </p><p>“That sounds great, Scorp,” Albus said, turning up to gaze at the swirling ceiling as his friend updated their list. “I’m really glad you brought this up, y’know? Even just talking about it made me forget about all the studying and exams we have ahead of us.”</p><p>Scorpius looked over and smiled. “Is your day feeling less long, now?” they asked.</p><p>Albus thought back over the wearying events of his day and compared them to the past half hour spent with Scorpius, who somehow always managed to fill him with new energy. He laughed softly. “No,” he said, looking across to his friend. “The day’s still long. But it’s not quite so trying with you here in it.”</p><p>A small, shy smile appeared on Scorpius’ face, prompting Albus to turn his gaze pointedly back to the shifting greens of the roof. When he looked back, several moments later, Scorpius was still smiling at him.</p><p>“What are you thinking?” Albus asked softly.</p><p>“Oh,” Scorpius said, shifting in place. “Just that… I think we’re going to have a really wonderful holiday together.”</p><p>It was Albus’ turn to smile. “Yeah?” he asked. Scorpius nodded sincerely, their hair falling across their face, and Albus knew with a warm, sweeping certainty that they were right.</p><p>“Me too.”</p>
