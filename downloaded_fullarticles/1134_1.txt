          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story starts during a time before Hogwarts was built. Its founders Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin are discussing their ideas for the school.</p><p>Godric smiled. "We need houses to sort the students into, they can be named after each of us."</p><p>Helga smirked. "Godric, Helga, Rowena and Salazar sound a bit odd."</p><p>Rowena chuckled. "He meant our surnames, dummy."</p><p>Godric scowled. "She's not a dummy, not everyone is as smart as you."</p><p>Salazar glanced between Godric and Helga and said, "You're crazy! It's clear to me that you two are in love and that will cloud your judgement."</p><p>Godric reassured him, "Stop talking utter nonsense, Salazar. My relationship with Hel won't affect a thing regarding Hogwarts."</p><p>Salazar smiled. "Then I like the sound of the houses being called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin."</p><p>Helga grinned. "Now we need places they can all sleep and talk in, Ricky."</p><p>Godric beamed, "Common rooms sound like a fine idea."</p></div>
