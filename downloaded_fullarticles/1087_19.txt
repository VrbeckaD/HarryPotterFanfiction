    <p>It was a pity really, that Harri hadn’t planned to make as bigger balls-up of her life post-NEWTs as possible, because she appeared to have found a hidden talent for it: Barely three weeks had passed since her final exam, and she had already made a poor career choice <em>and </em>ostracized three of her closest friends, and Harri didn’t even <em>have </em>that many close friends to ostracize - Not since so many of them had died during the war. Maybe Harri should pretend she <em>had </em>planned the balls-up after all, so as to look less pathetic. Or maybe she could blame Voldemort. That was another enticing possibility: After all, this was all Voldemort’s fault, really, if you thought about it rationally. If he hadn’t forced Harri into unnecessary heroics and living through killing curses, before he himself fucking died after all she’d done was cast an <em>expelliamus </em>- for fuck’s sake - then Harri wouldn’t be in this mess. Because, if it wasn’t for the killing-Voldemort-thing, the Aurors would not have offered Harri a place in Auror training. OK, Harri had worked quite hard in Eighth Year, which had been unwise, and got four ‘O’s in her NEWTs, which had been embarrassing. And Ron, typically, had not worked hard and had instead basked in his new-found fame and banked on cribbing off Hermione. Who he had, typically, had a huge fight with the week before their exams, which resulted in her refusing him access to her notes, which had resulted in Ron getting no ‘O’s in <em>his </em>exams at all, which had been mortifying. Harri had accepted her place as an Auror trainee before she had realised the offer had not been extended to Ron. This had been her second big mistake. Her first big mistake had been breaking up with Ginny. </p><p>Although, to be honest, the break-up had always been going to happen sometime. But she still had handled it very badly; in hindsight, she should have at least waited until after they had finished their NEWTs. Harri had <em>intended </em>to wait until after they had sat their NEWTs, but Ginny had been talking about renting a flat together, and had even started looking for one, and Harri had tried to be gentle when she told her she didn’t want to move in together, but tact had never been Harri’s strong suit. One thing led to another, which led to a fight, and Harri let slip more of her reservations about their relationship than she had intended. So, technically it had been Ginny who had broken up with Harri right before the two of them sat the most important set of exams in their life to date, but Harri wasn’t kidding herself. The break-up had been Harri’s fault and she knew it. </p><p>So now Ron wasn’t talking to Harri, because he was angry with her about Ginny and because he was smarting about Harri being accepted into Auror training while he had only been offered a place in a preparatory course, that should eventually lead to Auror training, all going well. Apparently, Ron’s bad marks were also Harri’s fault, because she had distracted him. Not that it had stopped Ron being mad at Hermione for withholding her notes - they still weren’t talking to each other. Hermione wasn’t talking Harri either, because Harri was tactless with Gin right before their exams, and because Harri still refused to admit she had issues around being emotionally unavailable (something Hermione was adamantly sure of with a mad fervour she usually reserved only for S.P.E.W.),  <em>and </em>because Harri was also fighting with Ron and Hermione was the only one aloud to do that, apparently. So, no one was talking to anyone, and the Summer so far had been Just Grand.</p><p>To top everything off, after barely two weeks break, Harri was back at school. If you had told Harri two years ago that she would ever resent being at Hogwarts, she would have said you were barking mad. But here she was, at the wretched MoM introductory and team building course, feeling out of place and itchy in her own skin in the only place that has ever felt like home. It was surreal and Harri hated it. </p><p>Eighth year had been bad enough. After a year of fending for themselves on the run, it had come as a shock to Harri, Ron and Hermione that, despite having taken down the most evil wizard Britain had produced in the last 500 years almost unaided, they were not considered capable of managing themselves without teacher supervision outside of their common room after nine pm. They were also not allowed to take Merlin's name in vain, unless they really wanted a detention, and they definitely were not considered old enough to shag. Not that there'd been any shagging the year they'd been on the run - they’d all been a bit too preoccupied at the time, to be honest - but it was the principal of the thing. Harri had to suffer the indignity of the school insisting she and Ginny use separate dormitories, which were warded in order to keep the other out, despite them both being of age <em>and </em>in the same classes. It was a stunning combination of lack of freedom compounded with a marked lack of trust and it had been embarrassing. All things considered, Harri could have done with a longer break away from the castle, even if technically she was here as an adult and allowed to swear to her heart’s content without fear of becoming intimately acquainted with the insides of the hospital wing’s dirty bed pans.</p><p>The Hogwarts castle felt strange without the usual clatter and hubbub caused by too many teenagers. Harri groused and grumped her way up to Gryffindor Tower on autopilot. Technically, as part of the team-building spirit of the event, ex-Hogwarts students were supposed to sleep in houses other than the ones they had been in at school. However, Harri was the <em>Daily Prophet</em> professed saviour of the Wizarding World, and although she usually didn’t take advantage of the leverage this gave her, the grim prospect of being forced into sleeping for a month in Ravenclaw dormitory (or worse) had caused her to make an exception. The fussy witch at reception, who had been handing out lanyards and magical name tags, hadn’t been particularly impressed, but in the end she had yielded. However, by way of compensation, to ensure that Harri’s life was as miserable as humanly possible, she had insisted that she dorm with…</p><p>“Malfoy?” Harri rounded the final corner to see Draca  Malfoy, eyes locked with the Fat Lady. Both were wearing matching expressions of aloof disdain, mixed with equal measures of boredom and disgust. Malfoy turned, “Harriet Potter,” she said, acknowledging Harri’s outburst by slightly cocking an eyebrow, “what a pleasant surprise. The Fat Lady and I were having a charming conversation just now, would you care to join us?”</p><p>“Have you forgotten the password?”</p><p>“Hardly. I remember it perfectly. However, this charlatan of a portrait still refuses to let me in.”</p><p>The Fat Lady scowled at Malfoy, “Do you know how many portraits were destroyed during the Battle of Hogwarts?” the Fat Lady hissed. </p><p>Malfoy gave her a cool stare. “None were damaged by me, or on my account,” she said evenly.</p><p>The Fat Lady looked like she was about to say something cutting, but Harri stepped forward, “Spattergroit.” The Fat Lady scowled at her, but swung open to allow her in. Harri gestured to Malfoy, who nodded curtly and climbed through the portrait hole. </p><p>Once inside the common room, Draca didn't seem to know what to do with herself. She stood in a corner near the door, grasping her elbows and surveying the room. With her platinum blonde bobbed hair and slinky dark green formal robes, she almost looked pretty. Infamy and failure had done Malfoy the world of good, in Harri's personal opinion. She leered far less now, and never threatened to set her father loose on anyone. Humility suited her and, although Harri still preferred to avoid Malfoy if at all possible, Eighth Year had mellowed her to the point where she was almost tolerable.</p><p>"Are you going to be a good hostess and show me around, or will I have to work out the guided tour myself?" Draca quipped, giving Harri a sidelong glare.</p><p>"Not much to show, really.” Harri shrugged, “The corridor to girls’ dorms is the one on the left and there's loos and showers on every second floor. The rest you can see." She gestured widely toward the empty common room. “Much the same as the Slytherin common room really, except our decor is more comfortable and there's less water."</p><p>Draca started slightly, “You’ve been in our common room?”</p><p>Harri looked a bit sheepish. She had been, but the visit had principally been so she could spy on Draca.</p><p>Draca gave a hollow laugh, “Of course you have. The Great Harriet Potter has been everywhere, private or otherwise. I suppose the next thing you’ll tell me that you have been in our Gringotts vault as well.”</p><p>“No, it was Bellatrix Lestrange’s vault we broke into. We never went near the Malfoy one.” </p><p>“What a comfort,” said Malfoy, dryly. “Do you think the blockheads organising this farce will make us share the same dorm room as well? Or will they give us the dignity of separate bedrooms, considering there should be enough space?”</p><p>Harri shrugged again, “No idea. Do you want to go have a look where they’ve put our stuff?”</p><p>Malfoy nodded stiffly and the two of them moved towards the left hand corridor. </p><p>“How come you ended up here, by the way?” Malfoy shot Harri a quizzical look, “I thought we were all supposed to be in different House dorms to the ones we had at school.”</p><p>“I’m sleeping with the office lady in charge of allocating the rooms,” said Harri, deadpan, not missing a beat.</p><p>“What, sourpuss Agatha? You must be desperate. Just don’t bring her back here, alright. Sharing a dorm with Daphne already scared me for life.”</p><p>“You two were sweethearts, were you?”</p><p>Draca choked, “Salazar, NO. I was definitely not her type. Something to do with having a snatch and no cock, if you catch my drift.”</p><p>“Difficult not to. How’d she manage to get the blokes into your dorm, though?”</p><p>“Ahm. Potter, there’s this thing called a staircase. You should really look into it sometime.”</p><p>“You mean people with penises can get up the stairs to the girls’ dorms in Slytherin?”</p><p>Malfoy stopped dead and gave her a very peculiar look. “Potter, it may have escaped your notice, but in the wizarding world people usually go upstairs using their <em>feet</em>.”</p><p>“And here I was, bouncing up them on my clit all this time,” Harri rolled her eyes. “The Gryffindor girls staircase turns into a slide if the lads try to climb it.”</p><p>“Oooh, how vulgar. How do the poor things manage illicit trysts with that kind of set up?”</p><p>“I think they usually have them in the boys dorms. Their staircases work just fine, so I’m told. I wouldn’t know, penises aren’t really my thing. Well, not on blokes, anyway. Trans women are hot, but there weren’t any in our year. Or, at least, there weren’t any who were out. Malfoy, are you alright?”</p><p>Malfoy was making the funny, gugly choky sound again, and had gone an odd, blotchy pink colour.</p><p>“I’m fine,” she said squeakily, “please, carry on.”  </p><p>Harri gave her a long, judgemental stair. Trust Malfoy to be a prejudiced git. Who was she kidding, Malfoy had <em>always </em>been a prejudiced git - she just had never come across these particular biases. However, Harri had to share a living space with her, and Malfoy seemed to at least be trying not to be such a wanker, so perhaps this was an argument to save for a later date. Harri turned and continued to stand in the door of the first dormitory. </p><p>“Bugger. We’re in the same dorm.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” Draca came up quickly behind her, she had returned to a normal colour.</p><p>“Well, that’s your stuff, isn’t it?” Harri gestured to a large pile of luggage at the second four poster bed in the room, the one that didn’t have Harri’s chest at its foot. </p><p>“So it would appear.” Malfoy stalked into the room with an air of resignation. “If you bring the awful Agatha up here, I will hex your labia together, I swear.”</p><p>“Hmm, kinky.”</p><p>“I promise you Potter,” said Malfoy with a dark look, picking up a night bag from the top of her luggage pile, “it is really not.” She sat on the bed clutching her night bag to her and closed the curtains with a flick of her wand. This was followed by a particularly impenetrable silencing charm. </p><p>“Planning on having a good wank, are we?” said Harri, addressing the bed curtain. There was a stony silence. Harri shrugged and silently summoned her night things out of her old school chest. She supposed, all things considered, the evening could have gone a lot worse. </p><p> </p><p align="center">o-O-o</p><p> </p><p> “Potter, it’s seven in the morning.”</p><p>Harri looked up blearily form sprinkling a large amount of sugar over her porridge, to see that Draca had finally dragged herself out of bed. She was slumped opposite Harri, elbows propped un-aristocratically on the table, platinum-blond hair tousled, and still wearing her night things under a green dressing gown, despite them being seated in the great hall. </p><p>“It’s seven in the morning, Potter,” Draca continued in a whine, “and we are the only ones up. Merlin and Morgana, why me?!”</p><p>Harri looked back at her breakfast, pouring milk over it and poking it experimentally with her spoon. Seven was a bit on the early side for her, too, if she was honest. <em>And </em>they did appear to be the only ones who had been required to rise at the crack of dawn. If Draca hadn’t been whinging insufferably, Harri would have been tempted to complain as well. As it was, she shrugged stoically and said “We’re working on individualized assignments today in our Dorm pairs. Presumably, our task requires an earlier start to everyone else's.”</p><p>“Your girlfriend hates me,” said Draca darkly, pouring herself orange juice and prodding around in the assortment of breads. Coming up trumps with a <em>pain au chocolat</em>, Draca sat back smugly and nibbled at one corner.</p><p>“I think hate’s a bit strong,” said Harri, surprised, “although I don’t suppose that Ginny exactly <em>likes </em>you. But I don’t see why this is relevant - she’s not my girlfriend anymore. We broke up.”</p><p>Draca gave Harri a long look, of the type reserved for the especially moronic. </p><p>“<em>No</em>, Potter, you don’t <em>say</em>! Why haven’t I heard about your exciting single status in the papers?”</p><p>Harri blushed. Some unkind person had leaked her and Ginny’s break-up to the press within hours of it occurring. The <em>Prophet </em>had run it as front-page news the next day and bloody <em>Witch Weekly</em> still wouldn’t shut up about it. Of course, Draca knew that she and Ginny had broken up. </p><p>“I was obviously referring to your current fling, the lovely Agatha the Accounts Avenger,” said Draca sweetly, sipping her orange juice. “You know, the one who told us we had to be up early?” </p><p>“Oh, right. Her. I forgot I let slip about our sordid love affair,” said Harri lightly and then, with a sudden note of panic, “you do know I was kidding, right?”</p><p>Draca gave her another long look.</p><p>“Just, I don’t want it in the papers, or anything,” Harri explained plaintively. “Agatha would be upset.”</p><p>“Yes,” said Draca dryly, “I’m sure it would be a huge trial to her to be the rumoured <em>paramour </em>of the most desirable bachelorette in the wizarding world. It would completely ruin her reputation as a sourpuss; her love life might never recover. Tea?” Draca gestured to the large pot between them, Harri nodded mutely, wondering how the conversation had managed to get this weird this early in the day. Draca poured them both tea, Harri agreeing to milk but not the large amount of sugar Draca added to her own.</p><p>“But don’t worry, sweetheart,” Draca continued, sipping her tea daintily, “your secret is safe with me. Not that I wouldn’t sell you out to the papers, obviously. But rest assured that no one would believe what I had to say if I tried. Information from Death Eater Scum like myself has recently gone quite out of vogue, you see.”</p><p> “Right,” said Harri. This conversation wasn’t getting any less weird. “Has anyone told you what we’re supposed to be doing today, then?”</p><p>“No, not at all. You?”</p><p>Harri shook her head. Just then there was a puff of pink-and-purple smoke and a scroll appeared.</p><p>“Ooh lovely,” said Draca, catching it, “instructions.” She flicked the scroll open and read, expression becoming more earnest as she went on.  Finally, she loosely rolled it shut again and passed it mutely to Harri, who shook open the parchment and read with some trepidation. </p><p>“I have to take you clothes shopping?!”</p><p>“In a muggle shop, that’s right. The Ministry must not think I own any muggle apparel. But do carry on, it gets better.”</p><p>“You own muggle apparel?!”</p><p>Draca rolled her eyes and made a circling motion with one hand to indicate that Harri should keep reading. </p><p>“You have to take <em>me </em>clothes shopping?! But the ministry must know I already have formal robes,” Harri frowned.</p><p>“You do?”</p><p>“Draca, you’ve seen me in formal robes.”</p><p>Draca coughed and attempted to look coy, “That was rather my point.”</p><p>“Oh, don’t be a bitch,” said Harri rolling her eyes.</p><p>“But I do it so well. Do continue reading, however. You haven’t come to the best part yet.”</p><p>Harri read the next couple of sentences and made a choking, spluttery sound. </p><p>Draca leant on one elbow and fluttered her eyelashes, “Found the bit where I get to introduce you to Mummy and Daddy while they’re under house arrest, have you?”</p><p>“Er…” said Harri, wildly trying to think straight while processing that The End of Days was Nigh. “I’m not that worried about meeting Lucius and Narcissa,”</p><p>“You should be, if you’re going to call them that.”</p><p>“Alright, Mr and Mrs Malfoy, then. I mean, they aren’t my favourite people, but I have met them before. I’m more concerned that the nutcase who designed this task expects me to introduce you to Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon.”</p><p>Malfoy slowly straightened, removing her elbows from the table and brushing imaginary crumbs from her robes. Her expression was suddenly very closed and austere.</p><p>“That is alright, Potter. I think I can manage to not show you up in front of your relatives too badly. I promise only to torture them a little. Nothing a minor <em>obliviate </em>won’t fix. I hear Granger's quite the expert on them.”</p><p>Harri stared at Draca, stunned. As a younger witch Harri would have already gone off at Draca for the barb about Hermione’s parents. But she was trying to learn self-control, so instead she swallowed and took a steadying breath, and said the first non-angry thing that came to her.</p><p>“Hermione’s not talking to me at the moment.”</p><p>Draca looked up, eyes still cool and sharp as flints, “Well, in that case, if you’re having to rely on your own merge magical resources, I’ll just tie them up and dance in front of them naked. Then they’ll wish that you could <em>obliviate </em>them, rather than forcing you to have to actually do it.”</p><p>Draca was being really weird. She had been almost pleasant for most of the morning, then all of a sudden they'd started talking about this ridiculous task and then… oh.</p><p>“Draca, I’m not worried about having to introduce you to my Aunt and Uncle.”</p><p>“Really? Because it certainly sounded like you had a problem with it about …”</p><p>“Draca!” Harry cut over her, frustrated, “this isn’t about you. I don’t care if you ‘show me up’ in front of the Dursleys. I mean, for starters, you won’t. God, they’ll probably love you. What with your posh accent and aristocratic arsiness, and, I dunno, general wealthiness. If you’re dressed in muggle clothes and don’t talk about magic too much, Aunt Petunia will think you’re great. And even if you did, they couldn’t possibly hate you more than…” Harri ran her hands through her hair, making it spike every which-way, “Draca, I’m worried about me. If I have to introduce you to my Aunt and Uncle then I have to talk to them and I haven’t. Not for years. Not since I stopped living with them a few days before my seventeenth birthday.”</p><p>Harri looked up. Draca was staring at her, with a stunned lost-for-words expression that didn’t suit her face. Draca was many things, but she was rarely stunned, and she was never lost for words.</p><p>“Really?” she said eventually, “you haven’t spoken, not since the war?”</p><p>“It it’s any consolation, we tried pretty hard not to talk to each other before the war, too.” Harri shrugged.</p><p>“And you’re not embarrassed… I mean, you don’t think they’ll be angry…” Draca swallowed, “you think they might not hate me? Even though…”</p><p>“Yeah, I mean, not worse than any other witches or wizards they’ve met. The Dursleys were never very fond of magic.”</p><p>“But I’m, I was…”</p><p>“They won’t know what side of the war you were on, if that’s your worry. Not if you don’t tell them - I certainly won’t.”</p><p>“Oh, right. Ah, so you never mentioned me, you know, when we both were still at school?” Draca looked oddly crestfallen about this.</p><p>Harri laughed, “Malfoy, if I ever talked about Hogwarts my Aunt and Uncle yelled at me and locked me in my room for the rest of the week. You were one of the many things I never mentioned about my life in the wizarding world.”</p><p>“Oh, right.” Draca still looked a bit shaken. She pushed her breakfast things away almost untouched and stood, “I better go and make my toilet then.”</p><p>“Your what?”</p><p>Draca gave Harri a funny look, “make my toilet. I am hardly going out to a muggle shop dressed like this,” Draca glanced at her pyjamas, “and I need to fix my hair and, I don’t know, cast a few glamor charms or something.”</p><p>“Er… right.” Harri rubbed her nose to try and hide her laughter.</p><p>“You might need to as well,” Draca added, looking Harri’s robes up and down. “Unless you want to go into a muggle shop looking like,” she gestured towards Harri’s general very wizarding attire. </p><p>“True,” said Harri with a grin, “I’ll get changed in a bit. I’ll just finish off here first. See you in about twenty minutes, OK?”</p><p>“Alright.” Draca nodded and moved away still a little awkwardly. Looked like the two of them were in for an interesting day.</p><p> </p><p align="center">o-O-o</p><p> </p><p>“Potter, have you gone completely mental? We are <em>not </em>shopping there.”</p><p>Harri looked up at the multi-story clothing department store they were standing in front of on Princes Street in Edinburgh.</p><p>“Why? What’s wrong with it?” she said, frowning.</p><p>“It’s an H&amp;M,” said Draca, distaste dripping from her every syllable. </p><p>“Er, yes,” said Harri, nonplussed, “H&amp;M is a muggle clothing shop, and we’re looking for muggle clothes so…” Harri shot Draca a sidelong glance. She was still looking unimpressed. “I mean, we could always go to <em>Top Shop</em> next door, if you would rather.”</p><p>“Harri,” said Draca in a very long-suffering tone, “H&amp;M and <em>Top Shop</em> are high street muggle clothing stores. You are introducing me to your estranged relations; I don’t want to look like some kind of street urchin. We need to shop somewhere with significantly better style.”</p><p>“Er…” said Harri, trying desperately to think of somewhere Aunt Petunia might approve of that sold clothing appropriate for people aged under fifty, “We could probably find a <em>Marks and Spencer’s</em>, if you like…”</p><p>“Harriet Potter, you really are hopeless,” said Draca with a sniff. “Do I honestly have to organise this step of the task as well? You are very lucky you’re teamed up with me you know. It’s not every pureblood witch who could manage it.” Draca gave Harri an appraising look that took in her unfashionably distressed jeans and grey hooded sweater. “You’re going to have to buy something as well, you do realise. There’s no possible way you can wear that.”</p><p>Harri choked, and was going to point out that when Aunt Petunia had dressed her, she had worn second-hand boys clothes that were several sizes too large. However, Malfoy, who hadn’t waited for her to respond, was still talking:</p><p>“It’s a shame we had so little notice,” she said, scanning the crowds of tourists and shoppers meandering along the street in every direction, “Muggle tailors are so slow. Never bother, I’m sure I can work out something. Oh, she looks likely.” With that she was off, purposefully weaving her way through the crowd. Harri hung back and watched. Malfoy had stopped to question a sharply dressed muggle woman in her mid-twenties and was conducting an animated and friendly conversation that included many hand gestures. Draca was dressed in blue jeans (non-distressed) and a neat navy and white linen-knit jumper. Not only did she look impeccably muggle, she was also talking to a complete muggle stranger in way that oozed confidence and amicability. It made Harri’s breath catch and was doing funny things to her insides. Draca, who somehow had learned what high street fashion was and that tailored clothing took a long time for muggles to make. When had this happened? Draca appeared to be thanking the muggle stranger and drawing the conversation to a close. As the woman continued on her way, Draca waved to Harri, indicating that she should join her. </p><p>“We’re lucky. There’s a suitable place quite close to here. We should probably walk - apparition is tricky with this many people around.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">o-O-o</p><p> </p><p>Harry sipped her tea peaceably in a small Surry cafe, one ankle resting lazily on her knee, waiting for Draca to fix her hair and makeup in the Ladies. They had decided to come here before storming into the breach that was Dinner with the Dursleys. There was an urgent need to recoup after having spent over an hour and a half attempting to make polite small talk with Mr and Mrs Malfoy over a very fancy, and not at all palatable, luncheon. (Harri would have called it afternoon tea, as it had started at two in the afternoon. But apparently this was merely fashionably late, and luncheon it was, nevertheless.) </p><p> </p><p>The day had gone alright really, all things considered. OK, Draca had forced her to by new muggle clothes and frog marched her into Madam Malkin’s afterwards, despite them having to make several different apparitions in order to get to Diagon Alley from Scotland, as it was the only wizarding taylors Draca would deign to visit. Apparently, this had less to do with the quality of the clothing than it had to do with Draca’s guilt at the way the Malfoys and treated Madam Malkin during the war. (Harri kind of wished the Malfoy’s had been considerate enough to bad mouth and generally abuse a wizarding tailor who lived a little closer to Hogwarts. There were taylors in Hogsmeade that were quite nice - Narcissa and Lucius have could picked fights with them, no trouble.) But even the clothes shopping had been bearable, despite Draca refusing to let Harri give Madam Malkin any instructions about the dress robes, as she insisted that Harri didn’t know the first thing about formal attire. Harri suspected this was partly punishment for having put her foot down earlier and insisting on buying a trouser-suit at the up-market muggle clothing store, rather than the dress Draca favoured. Harri did would do it again, too. After all, it was her money, and the trouser-suit made her look suave, even if Draca thought it didn’t do anything for her figure (<em>‘For goodness sake Potter, you’re fortunate enough to have boobs and hips, you could at least have the grace to flaunt them. Think of the rest of us for a change.’</em>) </p><p>Draca had emerged from the loos. She was wearing a silky red 20’s style dress that flattered her tall, slight figure (<em>‘I could wear a suit, Harri, I don’t have boobs or hips. But suits on you are a crime against humanity</em>’). She also sported elbow length black gloves and a stole. Who in their right mind wore a stole in this day and age? At least it wasn’t fur.  </p><p>“Are you really going to dinner looking like that?” Draca had the glint of battle in her eyes as she leaned against the table and looked Harri up and down with undisguised distaste. </p><p>“Yep,” said Harri, not moving and continuing to sip her tea.</p><p>“But your complexion is all blotchy.”</p><p>“Why thank you, how kind of you to point it out.”</p><p>“And you’re not wearing lipstick or eye-shadow, or mascara or, or…” Draca waved one hand exasperatedly, “or <em>eyeliner </em>or anything. Muggle women wear makeup Harri, pay attention. Do I have to teach you everything about your own culture?”</p><p>Harri moved so both her feet were on the ground again and placed her teacup on the table.</p><p>“I know that many muggle women wear makeup, Draca,” she said evenly, “but not <em>all </em>do. Also, I’m a witch and I don’t like wearing makeup. So I’m not going to.”</p><p>“Does your Aunt?” Draca shot at her, short and vicious, like a punch.</p><p>“Yes.” Harri leaned back in her chair and smiled.</p><p>“But then… won’t she expect…?” Draca made another broad gesture with her arm that seemed to encapsulate the dissatisfaction and confusion she was too frustrated to clearly articulate. </p><p>“I’m not wearing makeup to please my Aunt, Draca. It wouldn’t help anyway. She would just look for something else to criticise.” </p><p>Draca slumped into the chair opposite Harri, looking the epitome of disgruntlement. </p><p>“I will never understand you, Potter. I swear.”</p><p>Harri shrugged. “How come <em>you </em>know about muggle fashion and makeup, anyway?”</p><p>“From an earnest desire to outshine you in all areas of life, obviously,” said Draca, cuttingly. “However, if I had realised how easy it was going to be, I would have tried a little less hard. Are you sure you were really brought up by the non-magical fuckers?”</p><p>Harri rolled her eyes and ignored the barb. “Draca, I wasn’t trying to wind you up. I was just interested that you knew so much - it didn’t seem to be the kind of thing you would be particularly keen on…”</p><p>“Because I’m backward, bigoted Death Eater scum that…” </p><p>Harri raised a hand, “Draca! I never said that. Damn it, I never even <em>thought </em>that. I was just trying to… you know what. Forget it. I’m sorry, alright. I didn’t mean to upset you. Can we please just pretend I didn’t say anything?”</p><p>Draca scowled and crumbled bits off the edges of a scone she had been eating earlier.</p><p>“Would you like some more tea?” Harri offered, tentatively.</p><p>“No, that’s quite alright, thank you,” said Draca and then poured herself another cup.  Harri rocked back in her chair, sighing and rubbing her hand over her eyes. She didn’t have the energy for this. </p><p>“I learned it in the RJ Programme I did last year,” said Draca, quietly.</p><p>“Pardon?” said Harri, eyes snapping open. “The what?”</p><p>“The RJ Programme,” said Draca slowly, looking at Harri as though she had grown two heads. “As in, Restorative Justice,” Draca continued as Harri still looked blank, “surely you’ve heard…? I mean muggles invented it, I would have thought… Do you know nothing about your mother’s culture, Potter?”</p><p>Harri winced, “I know loads about muggles, thanks,” she said defensively, “just not… not that. OK?”</p><p>“Well then,” said Draca sipping her tea, “ for your information, Potter, Restorative Justice is a form of punishment, or maybe discipline is a better word,  that aims to make the perpetrator of a crime take some measure of accountability for the harm caused by their criminal actions. It first started being used in Britain by the muggle police to tackle youth crime in the eighties. After the end of the war, the Ministry of Magic and the Muggle Government decided to team up and design a special programme for magical youth who had been involved with supporting the Dark Lord, as an alternative to sending a large number of teenagers off to Azkaban. Use of Unforgivable Curses had become common practice at Hogwarts during the Carrows’ guardianship, among other distasteful practices, so there were quite a few of us, you see. We had to meet with victims and their families, both magical and muggle, and we had to take part in a rehabilitation programme.” Draca swirled the tea in the bottom of her cup, carefully not looking at Harri. “As part of the programme I worked with muggles who had lost family members in the war. They didn’t know the full extent of what had happened, obviously. They thought their loved ones had died in bombings, or aeroplane crashes, or some form of freak accident. But the holes left in their lives were… palpable.” Draca swallowed, although she was still examining her tea rather than drinking it. </p><p>“How long did the rehabilitation programme last?” Harri asked tightly, mostly as something to break the awkward silence. This was all a lot to take in and her emotions about it were conflicted. </p><p>“The programme only officially finished at Easter. I worked with the families most Saturdays while we were at school in Eight Year, and for extended periods during school breaks. I still do as a matter of fact, even now. I asked to stay on in a voluntary capacity after everything finished… I find it… helps.”</p><p>“It helps?” said Harri, nonplussed. </p><p>“Yes, Potter. It helps,” said Draca snarkily. “Is it so hard to imagine that I might want to help other people? That it might benefit me as well as them? That it might make me feel less of a scumbag and more of a human being?” Draca took a shuddering breath, looking away. “Merlin and Morgana help me, both. Did it never occur to you that I might need help coming to terms with my own idiocy and feeble lack of judgement? That working with people who have lost loved ones might help me to grieve myself, for everyone and everything I lost? The side of the light weren’t the only ones to suffer casualties during the Godforsaken war.” Draca stood abruptly, slamming her still half-full cup onto the table. “So anyway Potter. That’s how I know about H&amp;M and eyeliner.  Happy now, are we? I’m going outside for a minute so I can pretend to smoke. Don’t follow me.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">o-O-o</p><p> </p><p>“Right,” said Harri, bracingly. They were standing outside the Muggle restaurant that Harri had bribe-come-threatened the Dursleys to meet them at. Draca, relievingly, had mostly recovered from her strop and the two of them were back on speaking terms. “If anyone asks, we met through work, OK?”</p><p>Draca raised an eyebrow menacingly, “So they don’t know we went to school together?”</p><p>Harri started, “Shit, sorry. I really didn’t mean it like that. Mostly so they don’t think you went to school the Dursley’s told everyone I was at,” she said, touching Draca’s elbow lightly to add sincerity to the apology, “Unless you want people to think you went to <em>St Gertrude's Secure Institute for Incurably Criminal Girls</em>. I mean, it’s fine with me if you do.” She gave Draca a wicked grin. </p><p>“<em>St Gertrude’s</em> what?” said Draca, taken aback. </p><p>“<em>Institute for Incurably Criminal Girls</em>. It’s where the Dursleys told everyone around here that they sent me, so they didn’t know I went to Hogwarts.”</p><p>“Ah, I might give that one a pass, now you mention it. Should I tell them I went to Eton instead?”</p><p>“What?!” Harri balked.</p><p>“Don’t look like that, Potter. It’s a Muggle school. Finch-Fletchly was going to go to it before being accepted to Hogwarts, he seemed to be under the impression it was quite good.”</p><p>“Don’t you think you should pick a school with less Royal family in attendance?” </p><p>“Did the Muggle Queen go to Eton? How wonderful. Whoever would have thought being within earshot of Finch-Fletchly ever would be good for anything.” </p><p>“I don’t know about the Queen. However, I’m fairly sure her most famous grandsons both attended.”</p><p>Draca waved a hand airily, “Queens, Princes, whatever. Muggles aristocrats are all much the same. You wouldn’t know, Potter - You weren’t best friends with any of them. You couldn’t have been, as you were attending St Thingamies.” </p><p>“Malfoy, if you for as much as one instant try to pretend you are best buddies with any member of the Royal Family, however obscure, it will nauseate me so intensely that I will be forced to vomit immediately all over both of your shoes. Do I make myself quite clear?”</p><p>“Promises, promises, Potter. Now, are we going to go inside this establishment at any point, or do you intent to leave us standing on the doorstep for the rest of time?”</p>
