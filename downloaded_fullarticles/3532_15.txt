    <p>You're such a dirty girl, Granger."</p><p>Draco currently had Hermione pressed against the hard shelves in the Restricted Section of the library, her back up against his front. Her robe was open and his fingers were currently buried in her dripping cunt.</p><p>"I...Malfoy..." her breath hitched as her fingers dug into the shelf about at head-level. She couldn't believe she was letting this happen <em>again</em>.</p><p>And in the <em>library </em>no less. She should be ashamed.</p><p>Except she wasn't. She was far too lost in Draco's touch at the moment.</p><p>"I certainly underestimated how kinky you are." he said, his fingers continuing to work her folds as his lips alternated between placing kisses and giving sharp bites to her neck. "Anyone could come back here and see you, legs spread for me."</p><p>She moaned, her back arching so that her bum was pressed against his hard member, "Please," she begged, "Please don't stop."</p><p>He chuckled against her throat before asking, "Why would I ever stop, love?"</p><p>In fact, he sped up the pace of his fingers, enjoying her sharp intake of breath and the increasingly loud moans that flew from her lips.</p><p>Hermione's legs began to shake, and she was certain that when the coil in her stomach snapped there was no way she wasn't going to end up on the ground.</p><p>He seemed to have no intention of letting her fall though, his free hand moving to wrap around her midsection to hold her up, his other hand never slowing between her thighs.</p><p>"Are you going to cum for me, Granger?" he asked, expertly flicking her clit, "Are you going to cum all over my fingers?"</p><p>"Fuck...yes..." she gasped, not bothering to keep her voice down anymore. Luckily Draco had placed a silencing charm on the Restricted Section before he'd laid a finger on her. He'd learned the first time that she had a tendency to be a rather loud witch.</p><p>With a few more talented strokes she found herself seeing spots, and her legs did indeed give out, but Draco had no trouble holding her up. While she was trying to catch her breath - and her balance - he simply lifted her onto the closest table, stepping between her legs to capture her lips in a kiss.</p><p>They were both, for the most part, fully clothed, aside from Hermione's now mysteriously missing underwear.</p><p>He rocked his hips against hers, seeking any kind of friction as her hands tangled themselves in his hair. He used his grip on her waist to yank her closer, his fingers certainly marking her there. And though she knew she'd probably be annoyed by it tomorrow, she couldn't be bothered to tell him to move.</p><p>"Would you like me to fuck you here, love?" he murmured against her lips.</p><p>"Yes," she said, not hesitating.</p><p>He smirked, moving to trail kisses down to her breasts, teasing them through the thin material of her blouse, "Such a naughty bookworm."</p><p>"Please, Malfoy." she begged, rocking her hips against him more forcefully.</p><p>He would've continued to tease her, but his cock was aching to be inside her. He hadn't been able to stop thinking about her since they'd shagged two weeks ago - though Salazar knew he'd tried.</p><p>"I could get used to hearing you beg, Granger."</p><p>Rarely one to be outdone, she yanked him forward by his tie, capturing his lips in a passionate kiss before biting his bottom lip - something she had learned previously that he rather enjoyed.</p><p>"I wouldn't get too used to it." she replied, her toffee colored eyes sparkling up at him.</p><p>He smirked but didn't say anything else, instead freeing his cock and pulling Hermione forward so that her bum was at the edge of the table.</p><p>He leaned down, one hand tangled in her unruly mass of curls while the other guided his throbbing member to her dripping core.</p><p>She broke away from the kiss, gasping as he slowly stretched her, but he wasn't deterred, moving instead to place kisses and bites along the column of her neck, his hands wandering over every inch of her body he could reach.</p><p>"I hope you don't expect me to be gentle." he murmured against her ear, though currently he was moving slowly, pulling almost all the way out before sliding back in to the hilt.</p><p>"Wouldn't dream of it." she said, smirking up at him.</p><p>He wasted no time lifting her from the table and shoving her against the bookshelves, her legs wrapped around his waist and his hands under her bum.</p><p>No sooner had he pushed her against the shelves, he began pounding into her, repeatedly hitting her G spot.</p><p>"Oh gods...Malfoy...<em>fuck</em>..." her nails dug into the toned muscles of his back, but he didn't mind. He liked his women rather feisty - and Merlin knew she was <em>the </em>feistiest woman he knew.</p><p>"How does it feel, hmm?" he asked, his lips brushing against her skin as he spoke, "How does it feel having me fuck Gryffindor's Princess in the library in the middle of the day? Tell me, love."</p><p><em>Tell him? </em>She almost laughed at the thought. How was she supposed to form a coherent thought, let alone a sentence to tell him how she felt. Overwhelmed. Sexy. <em>Dirty</em>. Close.</p><p>"I...it..." she shook her head, starting again, "Good. So good."</p><p>Malfoy chuckled. He knew exactly what he was doing to her, and he enjoyed every second of it.</p><p>"Just good?" he asked, slightly indignant, "I can do better than <em>good</em>, Granger."</p><p>With that he readjusted his grip, moving one hand to her clit, "You have so many words swirling around in that head of yours; I'm sure you can come up with something better."</p><p>Regardless of how many words Hermione knew, and she indeed knew a lot, she couldn't seem to grab any of them in the moment. Her entire body was buzzing, pulled tight and ready to explode.</p><p>"Just shut up and fuck me, Draco."</p><p>He smirked down at her, slightly surprised at her bold response, but did do as she asked for once.</p><p>He picked up his pace again, his fingers resuming their place on her clit as he captured her growing moans with a heated kiss.</p><p>Her back was repeatedly hitting the hard wood of the shelf behind her, but somehow it only seemed to add to the utterly overwhelming feeling of being taken in such a relatively open environment.</p><p>Hermione Granger felt positively dirty.</p><p>And she <em>loved </em>it.</p><p>"Please don't stop." she whispered against his neck, her nails digging into his shoulders as she hung on for dear life. "Please, please don't stop."</p><p>Draco's breath hitched at her begging, the way she was panting against his neck, biting him every so often on particularly hard thrusts.</p><p>She was quite beautiful in the throes of passion.</p><p>"Never." he grunted out, hoisting her a bit higher so he could lick and nip at her breasts.</p><p>The slightly different angle had her seeing spots, which Draco, of course, noticed. "Ah! <em>Fuck, </em>Malfoy. I'm going to cum."</p><p>"Good girl." he murmured, "Come all over my cock, love."</p><p>His downright filthy words sent her completely over the edge, her pussy clenching around him.</p><p>To his credit, Draco never slowed, never gave her even the slightest second of reprieve.</p><p>"Gods, Malfoy, I can't -<em>ah</em>-"</p><p>Her words were cut off by his sharp thrusts, pushing her against the shelves even harder.</p><p>"You can, because I say you can, love." he whispered, closing his eyes against her breasts as he continued his pace. She felt divine. Softer than the finest silk.</p><p>Her stomach clenched at his dominating words. In any other scenario she surely would've slapped him, but it was undeniably sexy at the moment. He was just so <em>in control</em>. He played her body perfectly, even though this was only the second time they'd been this close to one another.</p><p>"Malfoy...oh gods...Draco..."</p><p>His pace faltered slightly as he heard her moan his given name. <em>Draco.</em></p><p>"Say it again." he grunted, quickly finding his rhythm again.</p><p>"Draco, I'm so close." she murmured against him.</p><p>"Fucking hell." he groaned, using his free hand to tug her hair back, exposing her neck.</p><p>"Are you going to cum again, <em>Hermione</em>?"</p><p>He'd never called her by her first name, and for some reason, hearing it in Draco's deep timbre, it immediately threw her over the edge.</p><p>He didn't stand a chance, grunting her name as he came.</p><p>For a moment neither of them moved, panting against each other as they tried to catch their breath.</p><p>Draco moved first, helping her stand before grabbing his wand, "Scourgify."</p><p>And though she was clean, she still felt incredibly dirty.</p><p>She cleared her throat, working up the courage to meet his eyes as she said, "Thank you, Malfoy."</p><p>He smirked and leaned down to whisper, "No need to stop calling me Draco now, Hermione."</p><p>Before she could respond he pressed a kiss to her lips and was gone, making his way from the Restricted Section and out of the library entirely.</p><p>She dropped down onto a nearby chair, unsure of what had just happened. <em>Again</em>.</p><p>But she couldn't deny she felt good - great even.</p><p>She certainly wouldn't mind another such meeting with Draco, that was for sure.</p>
