    <p>Harry had enjoyed spending time with Hermione, Neville and Ron on the train back. As per usual Malfoy had stuck his ugly mug in, and they had practically just ignored him. Malfoy was even more angry about the fact, that his father wasn’t a governor of Hogwarts anymore. So he was trying to get a kick out them. Hermione had just waved her wand, and the door had shut in their faces. Harry had laughed hard, when she had magically sealed the door, and they had ignored the muffled sounds coming from outside. They had talked about what they were going to do during the summer.</p><p>Hermione was going to France with her parents, Ron wasn’t sure what he was going to do during the holidays, but he would probably be staying at the Burrow. He invited Harry to visit like last summer, and Harry said, he would think about it.</p><p>Neville was going back to his greenhouse, he had plans to tingle with his plants, and didn’t really care much about the rest of the holidays. Of course, they all had to do their homework, but they weren’t too worried about that.</p><p>Harry was in for an exciting summer, just a month before the school year had ended, it had been decided that Harry wouldn’t have to stay with the Dursleys from now on, and he was going to live with his friend, who was like an older sister to him. She had helped him in the process of getting away from that accursed home. Harry owed her so much, he felt. He was excited, but also rather nervous. He didn’t really know, how this was going to work, but no matter what, it would be a hell of a lot better than the Dursleys.</p><p>The train arrived into the station. Hermione and Ron were looking around for their families, and Harry was looking around for Tonks. Ron got swept away by the twins and Ginny, who only managed to mutter a stuttering “have a good holiday, Harry,” before they went over to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, who stood there waiting for them. Percy also joined them after his prefect duties, still as much of a stick in the arse as usual as he was complaining about how some of the third years had been casting stinging hexes after each other in the corridors of the train. Harry chuckled a bit at the imagery of that.</p><p>Harry and Hermione walked forward, when they ran into Mr. and Mrs. Granger. Hermione dropped her trunk to the side and rushed into her mother’s arms. Harry just smiled, grabbed the discarded trunk and went over to them. Mr. Granger was eyeing him curiously. Harry could see, where Hermione had learnt that bone-crushing hug of hers. Harry waited until they were done, patiently waiting for Hermione to introduce him. Mr. Granger was looking like, he was thinking about something, but couldn’t really put his finger on it.</p><p>“Mom, Dad, I know that you met last summer, but this is Harry,” said Hermione.</p><p>“Of course, that is where I remember him from,” said Mr. Granger, “I don’t think, we have been properly introduced.”</p><p>“Hello Mr. Granger, Mrs. Granger, I’m Harry Potter.”</p><p>“Silly, don’t call me Mrs. Granger, that makes me sound so old, call me Jean,” said Mrs. Granger or Jean, as she would like to be called.</p><p>“Ehm, Okay, Jean,” said Harry half-embarrassed.</p><p>“Hello, you can call me John,” said Mr. Granger.</p><p>“We have heard a lot about you in our daughter’s letters,” said Jean.</p><p>“MUM!” Hermione pouted, “Don’t tell him that, it’s embarrassing.”</p><p>“Why shouldn’t I tell him that?” said Jean with a smirk.</p><p>Harry could see that she was just teasing Hermione, and he couldn’t help himself from laughing.</p><p>“What’s so funny, Harry?” Hermione said with an attempted glare.</p><p>Both John and Jean joined in, when they saw their daughter. Looks like, she had gotten herself a very good friend in Harry.</p><p>“Nothing, Hermione,” said Harry still chuckling from his laughter, “you are just so cute when you are embarrassed,” which promptly left Hermione practically steaming from the head. Jean laughed again at her daughter, but John was sending Harry a measuring gaze. This young boy wasn’t trying to get together with his daughter, they were much too young. Then he felt an elbow in his side from his wife Jean. She knew exactly what he had been thinking, and when he thought about it, he couldn’t really see the boy being aware of his own words. It was either that or he was so used to saying them, that he was a natural, but John highly doubted that. Hermione though looked like she had already fallen for the boy. She was growing up too fast, but they did say that girls mature faster than boys, and he even looked a bit younger than Hermione did.</p><p>John coughed indicating, that they had to go soon, when he heard a crash behind him, startling him a bit. Behind him was a pink haired woman, who looked entangled in a trolley. He looked at the puzzling sight, not really sure what to do about before he saw the young boy walk towards her and help her up.</p><p>“Wotcher, Tonks,” said Harry with a big grin.</p><p>“Wotcher, Harry, that really hurt,” Tonks said from the floor.</p><p>“You really do know, how to make an entrance,” grinned Harry, while he helped her up.</p><p>“Oi, don’t you laugh at me, the trolley definitely has a defect, it got caught on a pebble or something,” said the young witch in embarrassment.</p><p>“John, Jean, this here is Nymphadora Tonks, but you should probably call her Tonks,” Harry had said that last part in a hurry, when he noticed how the hair on the young witch’s head was turning into a red the Weasley family would be proud of.</p><p>“Just Tonks, I hate that name,” said Tonks with a shudder, “Wotcher Hermione.”</p><p>“Hey Tonks, good to see you again,” Hermione relied.</p><p>John and Jean were fascinated by the way the young woman’s hair was changing colours. Since Hermione couldn’t do much magic outside of school, this was very fantastical for them to watch.</p><p>“Ehm, how do you do that with your hair, I mean?” asked Jean.</p><p>“Oh, I was born like this, it runs in the family. I’m a metamorphagus. It means I can change pretty much everything about me, but it also means that I have two left feet from all the changing, I work as an Auror, which would be kind of like a magical police detective, it comes in handy, when I need a disguise.” Tonks explained.</p><p>“Wow,” said Jean, “You mean, you can change anything?”</p><p>“Pretty much yeah, but if the body mass changes too much, it is harder to control, so usually I either change my face into a man’s or a different woman’s, maybe add or subtract a few inches, but yeah. I wrap up my chest and make myself a bit more squared to pull it off.”</p><p>John was thought, that indeed would be a nifty ability to have in police work. She would be great for undercover or infiltration work. He had watched some documentaries on the television about some of that work, and mostly the undercover police would have a hard time getting targeted afterwards, but if the undercover agent had a completely different face and body, it would be easy.</p><p>Jean, though thought about, how easy it would be to make the perfect face and body, every woman couldn’t help being a bit vain, about such things. She became a little worried for her daughter. She could see how infatuated with the boy, she was, but after all the boy was still a boy, and hormones were a thing. She just wanted her daughter to be happy, so she couldn’t help but be a little worried.</p><p>“So Harry are you ready to go?” asked Tonks.</p><p>“Yeah, just a second Tonks,” said Harry, “Mione, I’ll write loads this summer, and I will invite you for my birthday if you are still in England at the time.”</p><p>Then he hugged Hermione tight, “Thank you for everything you have done for me this year. It was all your help, which made me get away from those terrible people.”</p><p>Jean perked up a bit at that, she didn’t know, what he was talking about, but she was sure to ask her daughter in the car on the way home.</p><p>“You’re welcome, Harry,” said Hermione with a smile, “I’ll definitely write loads.”</p><p>“Nice to meet you, Jean, John,” said Harry completely polite, then he went off with Tonks though it was Harry who was driving the trolley. Probably to avoid another accident involving a certain young witch and the aforementioned trolley.</p><p>Hermione looked at her mum and caught the look in her eyes.</p><p>“Okay, I’ll tell you as much as Harry would be comfortable telling you in the car,” said Hermione in defeat. She hadn’t been expecting to explain Harry’s situation to her parents.</p><p>“Yes, you best do that,” said Jean as they walked towards the exit.</p><p>In the car Hermione explained, how Harry would sometimes say things, which weren’t right about the time, he had lived with his aunt and uncle. About why he had to live with his aunt and uncle.  About how she might have cursed Harry to go talk to their Professor, and how Harry had stayed two weeks in the magical hospital St. Mungo’s to treat the hidden damage done to his body, and fix some of the malnutrition, that he had been suffering under. John had wanted to start the car, but found himself unable to concentrate on driving after his daughter had begun the story. He was pale and even felt a bit sick. Jean looked like she was about to throw up, when they heard the story. They both realised, that the boy probably wouldn’t even have told their daughter the whole truth. The boy had seemed fine, maybe a bit short and skinny, but it wasn’t that bad. He was very polite, and they hadn’t noticed anything before the two children had said goodbye.</p><p>Hermione, then explained, how Harry had magically copied his memories, and that it was the young woman Tonks, who had been the only one to see them all. There had even been a court case, where they had decided that Harry was in danger of getting killed if he stayed with his uncle, and that Tonks had volunteered to take Harry into her home during the holidays he wasn’t at Hogwarts. Jean had started crying at one point and was so proud of their daughter for helping her friend. John felt sad for the boy, and was amazed at how well functioning, he was after all that he had heard.</p><p>“So how long have you liked him?” asked Jean.</p><p>Hermione was speechless, she didn’t know what to say. She couldn’t help herself from blushing.</p><p>“Mum!” she sighed in exasperation, “it’s not like that, Harry is just my best friend.”</p><p>“I’m sure, he is,” said Jean with a smirk.</p><p>“He is not even 13 yet, Mum,” Hermione said.</p><p>“I know, he isn’t, but that doesn’t change that you have fallen head over heels for him,” said Jean, as John finally got around to driving them towards their home outside of London.</p><p>“I don’t know, Mum, Harry was just always there, and he was being really nice to me,” said Hermione redder than a tomato, “I guess after he grew taller than me, that was after his trip to St. Mungo’s, before that he was at least two or three inches shorter, than he is now.”</p><p>“How is that even possible?” asked John from the driver seat.</p><p>“From what he told me, they had to straighten his bones, because some of them had had too many fractures and hadn’t healed properly.”</p><p>John almost crashed the car for a second, Jean had gone pale again. He grew two inches just from fixing his bones? That was a horrifying image.</p><p>Jean praised Hermione again for probably saving the boy’s life.</p><p> </p><p>Harry and Tonks walked towards the underground. Tonks had shrunk his trunk enough for it to fit inside her extended pocket. That was the nifty part of Magic, it really was useful in many situations.</p><p>Harry was surprised when Tonks just casually maneuvered the muggle Underground.</p><p>“My dad is Muggle-Born,” said Tonks, “He thought it was a good skill to have to be able to mingle in the muggle side of London.”</p><p>Harry had to agree Muggle London was a big city, and there were many times more muggles than there were wizards and witches. Harry had really never thought about it before.</p><p>“Yo, Tonks, where do people like us normally live?”</p><p>“Depends on the person, some people live amongst muggles, some people live in big estates, some people live in places like Hogsmeade, which is a completely magical village,” Tonks explained, “It all really depends on the person. My parents live in the suburbs outside of London. They got a house there, raised me by themselves.”</p><p>“Oh okay,” said Harry. “Where are we going?”, but suddenly he felt ashamed, he wouldn’t even know it if Tonks told him, he had never been around London before, he only went to King’s Cross and Diagon Alley, if you don’t count the trip with Hagrid.</p><p>“Why are you looking like that?” asked Tonks confused, why Harry would be so embarrassed.</p><p>“I’ve never been to London before,” said Harry in a whisper, “Only Diagon Alley and King’s Cross.”</p><p>“Oh, Harry don’t be silly, even I don’t know all of London and I have been living here for almost 3 years,” said Tonks as she ruffled his hair.</p><p>“You know what, Harry,” Tonks said, “Let’s go to Gringotts first and get you some muggle currency, no offense mate, but that shirt and overbagged jeans thing, you are rocking is absolutely horrible.”</p><p>“Like you are one to talk?” said Harry rolling his eyes, “Leather trench coat, an AC/DC t-shirt and ripped jeans with leather boots? Are you going to tell me it’s “not a phase”,”</p><p>Tonks gave him a Noogie, the cheeky little shit. He had sounded just like her mother Andromeda Tonks, she would always go on about, how Tonks should get a more normal colour of hair, and how she should be wearing robes instead. This little punk, thought he could make fun of her?</p><p>“Stop, stop, I surrender,” Harry was putting up his hands in surrender, “You are going to ruin my hairstyle,”</p><p>*SNORT*</p><p>Tonks almost fell over from that comment, that boy and ruining his hair? She laughed out loud, Harry joined her. He hadn’t been so carefree in a good while.</p><p>They headed out of the Underground again and headed towards Diagon Alley and Gringotts.</p><p>When they arrived, they walked over to one of the counters, they exchanged some basic politeness between them, and then Harry managed to get around two-hundred Muggle pounds. They had decided to buy stuff closer to Tonks’ place tomorrow. “The Boss” had given Tonks a few days to get used to living with Harry before it was back to work.</p><p>Harry still didn’t like to spend too much, so he was sure this would be enough for seven sets of new clothing. They still hadn’t let Hedwig out of her cage, because she wouldn’t be able to find Tonks’ flat, since it was already under the Fidelius Charm. The sky was growing darker, and Harry noticed it was already approaching 8 P.M., before they arrived in front of street with brightly coloured multi-storied buildings. Tonks walked a bit in front of Harry and flung out her arms.</p><p> “Harry, Welcome to Carnaby Street!” she said with a big grin on her face.</p>
