    <p>Ten-years-old William and eight-years-old Charles had their laps full of younger siblings already. Four-year-old Percival was rather calm, but the two-year-old Frederick and George caused enough ruckus to wake up an entire graveyard with.</p>
<p>Arthur Weasley tried his best to shake off the thought of graveyards or, really, anything else that could involve a living being to stop breathing.</p>
<p>Because despite the overwhelming sense of dread that shrouded every thought, despite the little nagging feeling in the back of his mind that every day could be the last, today was a day for joy, as desperate as that sounded.</p>
<p>He looked at his sons with a warm smile. William grimaced, Frederick having caught a strand of his hair and seemingly getting very attached to it; Charles was smiling at their predicament while effortlessly holding George’s attempts at putting his tiny fingers in his big brother’s nostrils; Percy was sitting away from the twin menaces, fidgeting a bit in his seat and his eyes darting nervously around the room.</p>
<p>It was the first of March, and today the Weasley family was awaiting a newcomer. </p>
<p>Silencing Charms had been plastered around every room and protective wards were bursting with energy; concealment spells had also been one of the topmost priorities. Upstairs, Molly was being assisted by a few elder of the family, and a panicky, slightly over-concerned Arthur had been thrown out of the room unceremoniously and told to watch over his children instead.</p>
<p>“She’ll be fine”, one of the self-proclaimed midwives had snapped. “I’m not even sure she needs the pain-numbing charm, that one’s cooperative for a change.” A pointed glare in the happy father’s direction had been enough to make him blush into submission. In truth, this had probably been Molly’s easiest pregnancy: morning sickness had been rather mild, she had mainly voiced complaints about her back, eaten almost as much as she did when pregnant with the twins, and mostly slept during the last few weeks. </p>
<p>William, as firstborn, had been difficult because of both nerves and unfamiliarity with the situation; Charles had made his mother prone to bouts of anger in which she could get as scary as a dragon; Percival had started rather well, but the last months had been extremely unpleasant and the actual birth had been painful too; and the twins… well, carrying two babies at the same time was an experience that Molly never wanted to go through again, and neither did Arthur for that matter, since he had actually feared for his life during the last weeks.</p>
<p>But this little one had been mellow and peaceful, and Arthur was rather thankful about this.</p>
<p>“When is the baby?” Percival asked from his spot on the couch as he gave his twin brothers a wary look.</p>
<p>“Soon, Percy, soon”, Arthur answered as he chanced a glance up the stairs.</p>
<p>The war was making it so very difficult to raise a family – but Molly wanted this, she wished for a little girl of their own, and they had so far had only boys but it was alright. They both wanted their offspring to live in a world where the Dark Lord would be gone, and the Order was making progress, as far as they knew. Albus Dumbledore himself had told them to ignore the battles and to fully live their marriage no matter what happened. Still, they couldn’t help but feel guilty, in their little bubble of comfort, surrounded by their children…</p>
<p>Of course, the war still affected them – one month ago Death Eaters had found the safe house they had been hiding in. Explosive curses had flown left and right, the kids had screamed, luckily their little William had been close to the emergency Portkey and Charles had immediately grabbed the twins, or else…</p>
<p>A soft cry, muffled by the Silencing Charms on the door, interrupted his thoughts.</p>
<p>“Dad?” William asked hopefully as Fred let go of his hair. Charlie stood up, gathering George in his arms, and Percy slid off the couch, wringing his little hands together.</p>
<p>“Yes”, Arthur answered, his heart already bouncing with anticipation. After five births, you thought the novelty would wear off, yet he still felt tears of joy prickling his eyes.</p>
<p>Usually, one crying baby caused all the other ones in the house to cry as well, but Fred and George were being quite calm, which was a miracle in itself. Their father briefly wondered if this meant they understood the importance of the moment.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, the crying grew quiet, and the improvised midwives got out of the room. Muriel Prewett gave Arthur a stern, warning look, but he altogether ignored it as he guided his children to welcome their new sibling: Percival in his arms, William holding Fred (who was attempting a daring escape in order to stand on his own), Charles following dutifully with George (who was also attempting to escape, apparently wanting to join Fred).</p>
<p>The room had been cleaned and Molly was waiting, cradling the newest Weasley close to her, and she was sniffling a little. Arthur put Percy down, and kissed her cheek, but he saw her smile wasn’t entirely reaching her eyes. It could only mean one thing.</p>
<p>It was a boy.</p>
<p>Oh, they would love him all the same, but – Molly really wished for a girl, and they knew they couldn’t keep having children all over the place. The Weasley family was not a rich one, and Arthur refused to ask for help from the Prewetts – Fabian and Gideon already had enough on their shoulders with the Order. But it was his wife’s wish, she would be so happy to have a little girl to show things to and talk with…</p>
<p>But for now, it could wait, because William had freed Fred and the two-years-old was already trying to make his way to the bundle of sheets gathered in his mother’s arms. Arthur chuckled and leaned forward.</p>
<p>He was a rather tall baby. You couldn’t really tell, but Arthur had the feeling he was even taller than William had been. He had a long nose; pale, almost delicate diaphanous skin; a tiny tuft of red hair was peeking through the blanket. Apparently sensing the gathering of people around him, the newborn opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Ice blue, crystal blue, cobalt blue, deep sea blue, sapphire blue, so many different blues in these wide orbs that discovered their family for the first time.</p>
<p>Arthur smiled widely.</p>
<p>“What’s his name?” Percy asked curiously as he stood on tiptoes to get a better look.</p>
<p>Charlie’s eyes lit up, but Molly apparently had other ideas in mind than “First-fire” or “Second-wind” (his suggestions for Fred and George, inspired by a kid’s book about friendly dragons).</p>
<p>“Ronald”, she said. “Ronnie for short.” She kissed his forehead.</p>
<p>“Ronald”, Arthur nodded. Now to find the middle name… Molly had given her brothers’ to the twins, so he decided to use his favourite brother as well. “Ronald Bilius Weasley.”</p>
<p>Charles completed his examination of his newest sibling and looked up at his mum. “Sky-eye would be better”, he pouted. Then a thought struck him. “You think he’ll fly good?”</p>
<p>“You could teach him, Charlie”, William said, before leaning in to smile at little Ronald. “Hello.”</p>
<p>“Ronal’”, Percival said, then winced. “Ronald”, he managed after a few attempts, and then drew himself up proudly. </p>
<p>“Very good, Percy”, Molly approved.</p>
<p>Fred and George were trying to pry open the bundle of blankets, so they were quickly scooped up in their father’s arms to stop messing with the little one, who had stayed admirably quiet the whole time, blinking and observing all these people of different shapes and sizes buzzing around him.</p>
<p>It was on the first of March that Ronald Bilius Weasley met his family for the first time.</p>
