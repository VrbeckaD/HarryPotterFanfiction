    <p>
  <span>“So, what is this so-called emergency?” Pansy demanded as she slipped into her chair. She reached out and snatched the menu from Draco’s hands. He scowled at her, taking a sip of his water before answering her.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I broke up with Blaise.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, Draco, I’m so sorry.” Pansy said sympathetically, putting the menu down on the table.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco shrugged. “I’m not. It’s the best decision I’ve made all year.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Really?” Pansy raised an eyebrow. “You two were getting on so well?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“In public, yeah. But he was having an affair, and I’ve decided enough is enough. I want someone who will love me, and only me.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Blaise was having an affair?” Pansy demanded, and the look on her face instantly went from sympathetic to gleeful. “With who?” The bitch really loved gossip, Draco thought wearily.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“With his fucking mirror,” Draco grumbled, reluctant to admit that he had lost his boyfriend’s affections to an inanimate object. He looked up to find Pansy staring wide eyed at him, and realised the idiot was trying not to laugh.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re not serious,” she managed before breaking into a wide smile.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I am,” Draco rolled his eyes. “And I’m not crazy either. He’s obsessed with his own reflection. He has a large mirror at the foot of his bed. My first thought was </span>
  <em>
    <span>huh, kinky</span>
  </em>
  <span> but I went along with it. But I’m realising lately that he doesn’t even look at me- he’s always looking at that blasted mirror. He turns us around at the most random moments, just to improve his angle. Sometimes he outright stops what we’re doing to admire his own fucking abs. I’m all for kinky mirror sex, but not when it causes my boyfriend to pull out when I’m about to come!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Pansy was definitely giggling behind her hands now.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I can actually imagine Blaise doing just that.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Exactly!” Draco cried. “So I decided it’s time for a change. New me, new boyfriend.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“And where do you propose finding a new boyfriend?” Pansy demanded.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve decided I’m going to ask Potter. Look at the state of his hair, he definitely doesn’t have a mirror kink. Probably doesn’t even have a mirror.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Pansy looked up to where the saviour was seated with his own meal, and had to concede the point.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“If I’d have know Blaise would send you running to Potter, I would have set you both up ages ago.”</span>
