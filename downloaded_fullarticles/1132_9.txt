          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry and Draco had been dating for six months. They took it slow, scared to change things because they were finally happy. Tonight, Harry had planned an anniversary dinner.</p><p>"Follow me." Harry led Draco past the whomping willow where he had set up a small table and had decorated the trees with fairy lights.</p><p>"This is beautiful, Harry." Draco grinned as he looked around. Harry pulled out his chair before moving to sit across from him. Harry snapped his fingers and Kreacher delivered a delicious looking meal.</p><p>"So, I've been thinking. There's something I need to tell you." Harry started. Draco watched him suspiciously as he nervously rubbed his neck.</p><p>"You can tell me anything, Harry. You know that." Draco prompted.</p><p>"I...I think I love you."  Harry smiled as Draco breathed in sharply.</p><p>"I think I love you too." Draco said a moment later, grabbing Harry's hand.</p><p>They stayed there for hours after, just feeling happy with the relationship they had built.</p></div>
