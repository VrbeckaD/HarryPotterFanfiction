    <p align="center"> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Harry sat on the cushion stuffed window looking out at the black lake thinking about his life. He was alone for a change. The war had ended, and instead of returning to the Dursley’s or Grimmauld place Harry decided to stay at Hogwarts and help with the rebuilding. Harry hasn't made up his mind if returning to Hogwarts for a brand-new year was the right thing to do. He wasn’t alone in his decision, Neville, and Luna, who decided to stay with him at Hogwarts are not sure if they wanted to return for the new school year. Ron and Hermione went off to search for her parents. Hermione had obliviated her parents taking away any memory of them having her, in case she died in the war. This way they would never feel the pain of losing their daughter. Last, he’d heard from them, they were able to track Hermione’s parents, in Australia. Harry was happy that his friends were together and looking for Hermione’s parents. Harry saw how much Ron needed to spend time with his girlfriend, which was one of the reasons why he turned Hermione down when she asked him to go with them. He also felt a bit distant being around them, they were focused on each other and seemed to forget he was around.</p><p>Besides, he needed time to sort out his own life. Harry sighed, he was hoping that now that the war was over things would go back to normal, or what constituted as normal in his book. In less than twelve hours he was going to turn seventeen the age of majority for a wizard, now that he was free from the war, and from the Dursley’s he was not sure what he wanted to do with all the time he had left for the summer. The only thing he was certain of was that he and Neville planned to celebrate their birthday together, Luna will be with them too. It wouldn't be much of a celebration. Like Harry, Neville lost his grandmother in the last battle and two days after the war both his parents died. Harry wasn't sure how Neville still kept a bright smile on his face. But he was an inspiration for Harry.</p><p>Harry felt lost as if he was slowly drifting out to sea with no destination in mind. He did not have Voldemort trying to kill him, anymore. Or Death Eaters’ children plotting his death. He didn’t have a mission like trying to hunt down the lost souls of Voldemort’s Horcruxes.  He wasn’t in danger any longer like he was every year with Dumbledore’s little tests. Harry knew about them and although he hated them, he figured it was his old mentor’s way of trying to teach him. But at the same time, he felt a lot of anger towards Dumbledore for the way he was left unprotected in school and at the Dursley’s.  The old headmaster knew what was going on and did nothing about it, Harry wasn’t sure he was ready to forgive Dumbledore’s neglect in regard to his care. He’d held onto his anger from the moment he realized what was happening, but set it aside for the greater good. <em>Fuck, I hate that phrase. It got under his skin every time Dumbledore said the words.  </em>There was nothing great or good about what he was going through both at Hogwarts and at the Dursley’s.</p><p>Harry didn’t want to hold onto his anger, but he didn’t want to let it go. His anger towards his old mentor was what made him feel somewhat alive. He felt partially dead inside and wondered if Voldemort’s soul was what gave him life. Dumbledore had told him that death was the next great adventure and Harry couldn’t help wondering how true it was. If someone were listening to his thoughts, they would definitely think he was suicidal, but they would be wrong. He simply needed to find a new purpose in life. Harry knew that he was trying to push the people that cared about him away from, but he couldn’t help it. Harry, felt he needed time to figure things out on his own.</p><p>It was the first time he would be able to do things for himself and pushing his friends away was the only way he could do it. He was pushing away, Hermione and Ron and somewhat with the rest of the Weasley’s. It was if he was watching on the sidelines as everyone was moving on with their lives as if nothing had happened in the past few years. To have everything to be over in what seemed like a blink of an eye was like a dream to him and although it was a good thing that the war was over, Harry was still waiting to feel like a normal person. The only ones that refuse to be pushed away were Neville and Luna. For some reason, they decided they are never going to leave his side, ever. Harry had snicker when Luna told him, that Hermione and Ron had lived up to their end of the deal they made with Dumbledore. Harry didn’t understand what she was talking about and he didn’t ask either. There were times he was able to understand Luna’s riddles and other times they went over his head.</p><p>Harry simply accepted her and Neville’s friendship. He was only alone now because Neville had business to take care of at Gringotts and Luna went to spend some time with her dad. As for the Weasley’s they are still in mourning after losing Percy and his wife. He’d spoken to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley at the funeral, but that was the last time he’d seen them. Ginny has also kept her distance. Harry wasn’t sure if they were even going to get back together. In some ways, Harry felt responsible for Percy’s death. He blamed himself for every death. He looked down at his hands and closed his eyes. He knew it’s not there, but his hands felt as if they were soaked in blood. He opened his eyes and stared at his hands again turning them over then wiping them off on his pants until they started to burn. He needed to feel the pain, it was the only thing that made him feel human or alive again. It also helped ease the guilt he felt because the pain had become his silent friend.</p><p>Harry rested his head on the sill of the window. So many people lost their lives in a war that should not have happened in the first place. Starting with his parents, then Sirius, Dumbledore, Snape, Remus, and Tonks. Who had lost her and Remus’ child four months prior because her body could not handle carrying a werewolf pup, and all the nameless faces he’d seen fighting but never once spoke to. Hegwid and Hagrid died on their way back to Hogwarts before the start of the last term while being chased by Death Eaters. Harry also couldn’t forget the Malfoy’s. Harry never hated the Malfoy’s, both Draco and his mother saved his life by lying to Voldemort.  Harry, felt because of his wife and son died, he owed Lucius a life debt and was trying to repay it when the elder Malfoy was hit with a spell that was made for him. Harry wished he could go back in time and change so many things. </p><p>He closed his eyes and the tears he was holding back finally ran down his cheek. He tried to do the right thing and instead everything got fucked up in the process. For some reason, the memory of the final seconds of his fight with Voldemort came back to him. He remembered saying the spell, and the shock and fear he’d seen in Voldemort’s eyes flooded his memories.</p><p>
  <em>What was he afraid of? What was with that look?</em>
</p><p>It was as if he had seen something he was not expecting. Harry groaned raising his head and scrubbing at his face as he wiped away his tears. Voldemort looked at him as if it was the first time he was seeing Harry. That was not the first time the snake faced bastard had seen him.</p><p>
  <em>He took some of my blood for crying out loud! This was all Voldemort's fault.</em>
</p><p>Realizing he was not going to get any answers thinking about it anymore Harry was about to get up and leave when an owl flew into his quarters and landed in front of him, with a package hanging from its beak. Before reaching out to take the package from the owl, he reached into his pocket and took out some treats to exchange for the package. The owl dropped off the contents took his treat and flew out of the way he came. Picking up the package Harry furrowed his brows wondering who it could be from.</p><p>Turning it over in his hand, seeing the Gringotts seal on the back, he sighed as he opened it wondering what the hell they wanted from him. It wouldn’t surprise him in the least if it were their bill for the damages he, Hermione, and Ron caused at the bank. There was a black box inside, pulling out the box a neatly folded parchment fell on the floor.  He gently placed the black box down and picked up the paper flipping it over in his hand. He looked at the signature, but didn’t recognize the neat handwriting.</p><p>Heir Lord Potter,</p><p>
  <em>Your presence is requested at Gringotts Wizarding Bank tomorrow at noon promptly. Please show the contents of the black box to any teller at the front desk, and he will assist you right away. As a precaution, please prick your finger, allowing a droplet or two of your blood seep onto the item as verification that you are the heir of the Potter household. Do not be late Heir Lord Potter, time is of the essence.</em>
</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>Master Gravenhawk</p><p>
  <strong>Gringotts Bank Manager</strong>
</p><p>Harry picked up the black box and opened it, inside was the Potter family crest with a Knight's face shield with a roaring lion on top and elegant leaves on both sides. It was gold, black and white with the letters Potter on the bottom in gold plating. Harry gently strokes his thumb over his family name and winced when he scratched his finger. Looking at his thumb blood bubbled out of the small cut he immediately turned his finger over letting the liquid drop on the crest.  It glowed, and the lion roar turned his head, and his red eyes gazed into Harry’s as images and information about past heirs filled his head. He dropped the box and grabbed the side of his head, hoping to save off a blinding headache that was sure to come.Harry’s breathing became shallow, and his lunch was ready to rebel on him. He groaned as faces flash from one to another there weren’t any words or sound telling Harry, who he was seeing the only one he recognized was his father, James Potter. It all stopped, but Harry was left with the aftershock. He fell to the floor and dry heave coughing up nothing before he fainted, and everything went black. Harry woke a few hours later with a gasped. He looked around and realized that he was in bed and not the floor. He caught movement out of the corner of his eye, he slowly reached for his wand, but realized it wasn't under his pillow. He was on edge. He knew he was still at Hogwarts, but the Castle was not completely safe. The wards were still being repaired.</p><p>“Oh, you're awake.” </p><p>Harry sighed in relief when he realized it was Neville. “Yeah,” he said, clearing his voice. “How long was I out?”</p><p>“Er...I'm not quite sure. When I got back to see if you wanted to get something to eat, I found you passed out on the floor. I levitate you to the bed. I must have fallen asleep myself.” He yawned stretching.</p><p>“Yeah, I got something from Gringotts and the next thing I know I passed out,” Harry explained. Pointing to the black box now sitting on the table in the room.</p><p>“It’s the family blood recognition,” Neville told him. “It’s brutal receiving all that information all at once.”</p><p>“What happens if it doesn't recognize you?”</p><p>“I reckon, you die,” Neville said simply with a shrug of his shoulders. “It’s a way for the goblins to have everything ready for you when you receive your lordship. Mine wasn’t so bad because Gram made sure that I was prepared,” he whispered.</p><p>“Oh,” was all Harry could say. They were silent for a few minutes before Harry spoke again. “Hey, Nev, I'm still a bit tired I think I'm going to lay back down.”</p><p>“Okay, I guess I will go then.” He went to stand up and got ready to walk away, but Harry grabbed his hand.</p><p>“I don’t feel like being alone,” he said, looking up at Neville with pleading eyes. It was as if Neville understood and knew what he wanted. He didn't want to be alone for the first time on his birthday.</p><p>Neville nodded his head, and Harry released his hand. Neville undressed leaving on his boxer and undershirt. “Budge over.”</p><p>He moved over and lifted the covers for Neville to get in. He turned on his side, and Neville’s arm pulled him closer. He sighed, feeling better and safer in Neville’s comforting embrace, there was nothing intimate about their relationship, Harry viewed Neville as a brother and a confidant. Harry realized a year earlier, that he was attracted to both male and female. Because of his Muggle upbringing, he wasn’t sure if he should’ve told his friends about his first non-penetrative sexual because he didn’t want them to think that he was a freak. Harry didn’t care about what other people thought about him, but his friends were the only family he had. If they rejected him, it would devastate him. It did ease his worry when he found out that the Wizarding world was more accepting of same-sex couples than Muggles.  He’d finally broke down and told Neville and Luna. Harry was still hesitant to tell Hermione and Ron, he loved them both dearly but their combined views sometimes wondered if their friendship was based on his name. When he’d opened up to Neville and Luna it was also during that time he found out that his mentor Albus Dumbledore was once had a love affair with Gellert Grindelwald. The very same man he defeated years ago. Harry wondered how many times, Dumbledore wished he could go back in time and save his lover. How would things have changed for Dumbledore and possibly everyone else?</p><p>“Do you wish you could go back in time and rewrite the future?” He asked Neville.</p><p>“How far back are we talking?”</p><p>“I don’t know pick anytime.”</p><p>Neville was silent before he whispered, “I would love to go back and meet my parents. Hang out with them have a pint or two, see them in their youth, hear my mom's laughter for once. Talk to my dad about anything. Something I can remember where they were happy and things were good. And not their screams or the two shells that were once my parents.”</p><p>Silent tears from Harry’s eyes soaking his pillow, listen to Neville. “I wish I could give that to you, so badly.” He rolled over and looked in into Neville’s eyes wanting to see the truth of his next question. “Did you ever blame me for what happened to your parents?” </p><p>Neville reached up and gently touched Harry’s wet cheek, wiping away the moisture with his thumb. “No,” he answered. “Do you want to know why?” Harry nodded. “Because just like me on that same night you also lost your parents. You lost everything that would have mattered to you. Sirius and Remus as well. So no, Harry, I don’t blame you, I’ll never blame you for something you had no control over.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Harry whispered. He leaned in and kissed Neville gently on his lips and just like their hug, there wasn’t any intimacy behind it. But it was filled with love and trust. He pulled back and looked at Neville, who smiled at him.</p><p>“I wish I could do the same for you, too.” Harry Furrowed his brows in confusion. “Give you your parents back. Remus and Sirius, too.”</p><p>Harry nodded and rested his head in the crevice of Neville’s neck. He felt a kiss on his forehead as he drifted off to sleep. And for the first time since he could remember he went to sleep not counting down his birthday because he wasn't alone anymore.</p><p> </p><hr/><p align="left">The next morning instead of eating in the Great Hall the trio went down to Hogsmeade to have their breakfast. His mood had improved, as much as he loved being with Ron and Hermione, he didn’t feel like the third wheel being around Neville and Luna. As they ate Luna told them that her dad will be going on a trip and was not sure when he will be coming back. He had sold his newspaper company after the war ended. After being one of Voldemort's prisoner, he did not feel as if he could continue being a productive member of society and he needed to find himself. Luna told her father she understood and that she will be taking a trip herself as well and will not be coming back. Harry wanted to ask what she was talking about but she quickly changed the subject.</p><p>“So, Harry, what do you want to do after you leave Gringotts? It's your birthday, after all. Yours too, Neville.”</p><p>Harry shrugged his shoulders and looked at Neville for advice.</p><p>“What if we go into muggle London and spend the weekend. Go to one of those clubs Seamus is always talking about that he snuck into. It's something I've always wanted to do,” Neville suggested.           </p><p>Harry perked up at that idea. “I've never seen this side of you, Neville,” he said with a smile.</p><p>“It's a new me, Harry. I also want to do some shopping, I reckon, I might even get a tattoo or a piercing or two.”</p><p>“What has gotten into you?” Harry asked in surprise.</p><p>“Like I said, Harry. It's a new me. If the war has taught me anything is that life is too short.” Neville said taking a sip of his tea. “So, are you in?”</p><p>“I am in,” Luna said cheerfully. “It's time we start living.”</p><p>They both turned to look at him with bright smiles on their faces. “Okay, fine I'm in.” They agreed to meet up at Hogwarts after he was finished at Gringotts then they would go shopping before going into Muggle London.</p><p>Twelve o’clock on the dot Harry walked into Gringotts. He walked over to the first available teller. “What can we do for you today?”</p><p>He reached into his pocket and pulled out the black box. “I was told to show someone this.” He said, opening up the box.</p><p>The teller nodded. “Right this way, Lord Potter.”</p><p>Harry blinked a few times hearing the Lord before his name. It felt strange and knew it was something he would never get used to, no matter how many times he was going to hear it. “Er... could you just call me, Harry?” He asked, catching up to the goblin who stopped and stared at him as if he'd lost his bloody marbles. <em>I must have said something idiotic. </em>The teller did not respond and started walking again. Harry sighed and caught up to him. They went down a corridor and up a winding set of stairs. This was a part of Gringotts Harry has never seen. The last time he was in the bank, he, Hermione and Ron had caused a lot of damage setting the dragon they had prisoner free.</p><p>
  <em>I guess I should apologize for that.</em>
</p><p>“Um... about the last time I was here,” he began rubbing the back of his neck shyly. “I'm really sorry, we caused all of that…”  The teller stopped and stared at him again. “I can pa... that is I can work off the damages.”</p><p>The teller opened the door, Harry just realized they are standing in front of an empty room. The goblin stepped to the side tilting his head, indicating that Harry should enter. The room was empty except for the large desk and the two chairs. “Not to worry,” Harry turned to look at the goblin. “It's all been taken care of, Harry.” He finished with a smile. “Between you and me, I was against having that thing here anyway.” That shocked the shit out of Harry. “Your bank manager will be here shortly. May your gold be plenty full, Harry Potter.” He said with a respectful bow.</p><p>“You as well, Master…”</p><p>“Braggor,” said the goblin helping him before closing the door.</p><p>Harry sat in the chair facing the table. His wait did not last long as another goblin entered the room. He was not as short as Braggor but was stoutly in size. There was a large wooden box in his hand with a dozen or so neatly rolled parchments on top of it.</p><p>“Lord Potter, it's good to finally meet you, I’m Master Gravenhawk.”</p><p>“It's Harry, please, and it’s nice to meet you, as well,” he said getting up. Truth be told he was nervous and did not know the protocol on how he should act. <em>Maybe I should have asked Neville or Luna to come with me. Fuck, I feel so out of place doing this on my own. </em>He reached out to help the goblin taking the parchments off the top of the boxes. </p><p>“Oh, thank you, Harry,” he said setting the wooden box on the table.</p><p>“Yeah, no problem,” he told him as he set down the parchments beside the box.</p><p>Harry sat back down and started shaking his leg and practically biting his nails down to the nub. He was nervous and wasn’t sure why he was.</p><p>“Now,” Gravenhawk said, looking at Harry over his moon-shaped spectacles that reminded him so much of Dumbledore. “As it has been verified you are Harrison James Potter. Son of Lord James Fleamont Potter and Lady Lily Jane Potter nee Evans. Sole grandson of Fleamont and Euphemia Potter As their sole, you are now Lord Potter of the Proud, Noble, Honorable, and the most Ancient House of Potter.” Gravenhawk unrolled one of the parchments. Gravenhawk unrolled one of the parchments. “All the titles and holding will belong to you once you accept the title of Lord Potter. To accept your lordship, please sign on the bottom of the page.”  Gravenhawk handed him the parchment and a quill and ink. “Before you sign,” Gravenhawk. “I will need you to add a couple drops of your blood to the ink.”</p><p>Harry froze, “my blood?”</p><p>“Yes, is there a problem?”</p><p>“Well,” he started as he absently rubbed the evidence of the last time he was forced to use blood quills.</p><p>Gravenhawk noticed and raised his non-existent eyebrows. “Ah, I see. Well, not to worry young lord. There will be no pain or evidence from using this quill and ink. I give you my word. I see no need to cause you pain.”</p><p>Harry wanted to ask the goblin, if he was certain, but saw the truth in his eyes. “Okay.” Doing as he was told Harry sliced his finger wincing at the pain and pointed his finger over the ink and watched as it glowed accepting his blood. He closed the wound with his wand, then dipped the quill in the ink he was about to sign his name and hesitated for a few seconds. Writing the first letter in his name, he waited for the sting like the last time he used a blood quill, when nothing happened he gave a visible sigh of relief. He finished signing his name and handed the parchment back to Gravenhawk.</p><p>“Thank you,” Gravenhawk set the parchment down and reached into the large wooden box and pulled out a smaller one handing it to Harry.</p><p>“What’s this?” Harry asked, taking the box.</p><p>“It is your lordship rings, proving your claim as the head of the Potter house.”</p><p>Harry opened the box and stared at the ring. It looked just like the crest that was sent to him the night before. Taking the ring from the box, he put it on his middle finger of his left hand, then felt as the ring shrunk to fit his finger.  Thinking that was it. Harry was about to get up when Gravenhawk spoke again.</p><p>“Now onto other matters.”</p><p>“Such as,” Harry asked.</p><p>“Before he was arrested and sent to Azkaban for a crime we now know he did not commit, Sirius Black came in to see us. He made you his heir. And as there are no other Black family members alive you are now Lord Black.”</p><p>Harry gasped, “What?!”</p><p>Gravenhawk continued as if he did not hear Harry’s outburst. “All the titles and properties owned by the Proud, Noble, Honorable, and the most Ancient House of Black now goes to you.”</p><p>“I don’t want it,” Harry said. “I can’t,” he whispered. If he accepted it, it would only make it real that Sirius was truly gone.</p><p>“I’m sorry Lord Potter, but you have no other choice. As a matter of fact, Sirius Black made it possible for you to be fully recognized as a Black by adopting you. Not in blood mind you. But he made you his son in name as well.” Gravenhawk putting the parchment down in front of him.</p><p>Tears clouded Harry’s vision, the room remained silent. <em>Why would he do this? He made me his son. If I refuse, I would be throwing Sirius’ love back in his face.</em></p><p><em> </em>Dashing away the tears from his cheeks, he took in a large breath collecting himself before looking at Gravenhawk. His emotions were still raw from losing Sirius. He picked up the quill and signed his name accepting Sirius’ gift. He handed the parchment back Gravenhawk. He was handed another box and inside was an opal ring with a skull, three ravens and a hand with a sword fisting a blade. He slid the ring on the same finger as the Potter ring and watch as they meld together. Taking the shape of yin and yang.</p><p>“Just a few more to go and then you can be on your way, Lord Potter-Black,” Gravenhawk told him. “If you would like, I can have some refreshments brought to you.”</p><p>Harry nodded, not sure what else he agreed to. He couldn’t help but wonder if Neville had gone through the same thing. He doesn’t remember if Neville was wearing any rings on his finger earlier that morning at breakfast. But it would only be normal since he was the Longbottom heir.</p><p>“There are two more Lordships to bequeath to you.”</p><p>Harry looked up in interest. “Two more?” The only other person besides Sirius and his parents that would want to leave him something of value was Remus and as far as he knew his wolf godfather wasn’t a pureblood. So, what more could there be?</p><p>“Before their deaths, Lord and Lady Malfoy came in to see us and made an amendment to their wills. If by chance their heir and only child Draco Malfoy did not survive the war, all of their holdings and estates will be awarded to you.”</p><p>“What?!” Harry yelled, jumping out of his chair. He started pacing the room running his hands through his hair. “I don’t understand what do you mean?” He asked stopping and looking at Gravenhawk begging him to explain. “Why? Why would they do that? Didn’t they believe they would have survived? That Dr... Draco would live?”</p><p>“No, but it was apparent to everyone, especially to the Goblin Nation that Voldemort would not be the winner. We were and have been prepared for this day to come.” Gravenhawk answered not even thinking about it surprising the shit out of Harry. <em>Are their people seers or something?</em> “They also left you a letter,” he reached into the box and pulled out an envelope extending it in Harry’s direction.</p><p>He looked from Gravenhawk to the envelope and back to the bank manager again as if the man could tell him what was written in the letter. He covered his face trying to decide what to do. With shaky hands, he reached out and took the letter from Baggor sitting back down, turning the letter over in his hands a few times before finally giving into his curiosity he opened it. He pulled out the neatly folded parchment and started to read.</p><p>Dear Mr. Harry Potter,</p><p>
  <em>I know this might seem strange and frankly, I cannot believe I’m even considering this myself. But it is something I must do. I fear that my family and I will not survive this war. I have placed my family in danger which was something I never intended to happen but is far beyond my control. No man in my position would ever think that their sins would come back to harm their family. I would lay down my life for my love and child, but I do not foresee either of us coming out of this war unscathed. My son, Draco is not as strong as you are, a characteristic I wished he had gained from you. If it should happen, I do not blame or put the death of my family at your feet. I place the blame where it lies, with me.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Mr. Potter, please understand I am a Malfoy and Mr. Potter I value my pride. But in this instance, I set my pride aside and ask that you carry on my family name and Lordship and all that it entails. My wife and I have discussed this, and we feel that it is the best course of action to take in the event Draco does not survive. I have sullied the name Malfoy by aligning myself with a man who has done nothing but reigned terror in our world. It is my greatest hope that you will be able to set it right. I would rest peacefully knowing that you will follow through with my request as I place my family fortune and name that will be left in your care. My request Mr. Potter is that you will do great work and rebuild the wizarding world using the name of Malfoy.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I beg you not to refuse my gift or request. I have admired your strength Mr. Potter, and I feel had we met in another life we might have been friends. Or dreams are not so different. We want a safe world for our children to grow and continue to feel accepted. I do not hate Muggle-borns or half-blood because of their blood. I detest them because once they enter into our world instead of understanding the way we do things they try to change it without giving our way a chance. I do not to change as long as there’s an understanding or compromise between both parties. From what I have witnessed no one was willing to sit down and talk or rather the time for talking this out are long gone.</em>
</p><p><em>I know you have questions why I followed the</em> <em> Dark Lord. After all, he was a half-blood. Yes, Mr. Potter, I knew; I’ve always known. But, upon entering our world, he understood and respected our traditions. I will not apologize for the role I played in the war, it’s already too late for my repentance. However, I will apologize for the deaths and children who are without their parents. Their deaths should not have happened. I am not as evil as you might believe of me, Mr. Potter. But I am a man built and born of traditions. I love my family. Mr. Potter. For everything I did, I did it for my family. Please, Mr. Potter, build a new world where everyone will be able to live and not feel accepted. Do what I could not or what I was too afraid to do.</em></p><p>
  <em>Respectfully,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lord Lucius A. Malfoy</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Lord of the Proud, Noble, Honorable, &amp; Most Ancient House of Malfoy</strong>
</p><p>Harry read the letter three more times, and the words didn’t change. Lucius Malfoy wanted him to accept the Malfoy title. <em>Oh, Merlin what should I do? </em>He refolded the letter and put it back into the envelope resting it back down on the desk. He looked up at Gravenhawk still unsure of what to do. “You said there were two other things, what’s the other?” Gravenhawk sighed. “This one is a bit sensitive,” the goblin said to him. “Yesterday when you allowed blood to touch your family crest. A family recognition check was done. I assume you had a terrible time with all the information and you got a bit sick.” Harry nodded. “It has come to our attention, and I am not sure how this was missed, but it seems that you are related to one of the oldest and greatest magical family and are their last remaining heir.”</p><p>“Who?” Harry asked with interest.</p><p>“Have you heard of Morgaine Le Fay?” Gravenhawk asked him.</p><p>“Not much,” Harry answered honestly. “According to Muggles she wasn’t real, but they also said witches and wizards were a myth, and here I am,” he shrugged a shoulder. “They also believed she was a witch and a dark one at that and was Merlin’s enemy.”</p><p>The goblin hummed before he started speaking again. “Morgaine Le Fay also known as Morgan Le Fey, Morgane, Morgain, Morgana, Fata Morgana and any other variant of her name was a powerful witch.” Gravenhawk started. “She was the daughter of King Pendragon of Cornwall and Igraine they weren’t powerful in magic but they were influential. After Igraine died due to an illness, the King remarried and his new wife gave birth to a boy. Because Morgane was a woman she was not able to ascend the throne as Queen. However, her half-brother Arthur Pendragon did. Who coincidental as of yesterday we have found his last remaining blood relative of King Arthur Pendragon.”</p><p>Harry was listening, but he still did not understand exactly what this had to do with him. He understood that he was the last heir and if he was not mistaken, and he could be wrong in what he was thinking, but Neville could be the heir of Arthur Pendragon.</p><p>“What does this have to do with me?” Harry asked finally.</p><p>“It mean’s Mr. Potter. That you have been elevated in ranking from the Lord of three noble houses to Duke Le Fay. Added to the fact that you are also the last remaining blood family member of Slytherin and Ravenclaw….”</p><p>“Wait! How am I related to Le Fay, Slytherin and Ravenclaw? That doesn’t make any sense.” He asked in surprise.</p><p>“Simply put, magic; blood magic to be precise,” Gravenhawk answered as if he did not just get turned Harry’s world upside down. “A wizard or witches magic and blood are connected and it passes from one generation to the next. Depending on the family bloodline it gets stronger. In your case and another lord who will remain nameless but I suspect you’ve already figured it out. Your bloodlines are extremely strong.”</p><p> “This is all too much,” he said. Do… do you mind if we do this another day?” He asked warily. “I have a lot to think about, and I feel as if my head is about to explode with all this new information.”</p><p>“Very well, Duke Le Fay…”</p><p>“Let’s stick with Harry, please. All these bloody titles are giving me a headache.”</p><p>“As you wish,” Gravenhawk amended. “Would you like to visit one of your vaults today?”</p><p>Harry thought about it for a second. “You know what, I would like to visit the Potter vaults and then the Blacks.”</p><p>“Very well,” Gravenhawk got up from his chair and gathering all the documents that he came in the room with.</p><p>This time Harry didn’t offer to help, and he hoped the goblin did not take offense. His mind was spinning out of control with everything that happened in the span of an hour or two. Lucius Malfoy handing over everything to him, and being related to two of the founders and a powerful old witch he once thought was a myth and realized he knew nothing about her or his family. Gravenhawk led him to the lift and told him to wait there while he stowed away the documents and retrieved the keys to the vaults. He looked down at the rings on his finger and couldn’t believe what was happening to him. He did not think he would survive the war, because of the prophecy, but he was determined to make sure everyone else lived. Gravenhawk walked over to him and directed Harry to the lift getting into the cart. The goblin pulled the lever, and they were off.</p><p>Harry held on tight remembering how thrilling the ride was but still left him a bit queasy. They stopped at the Potter’s vault’s first and Harry was expecting to see a small amount of gold just as he had the previous times he visited the bank to retrieve a few coins. He gasped when the doors opened and it was filled to the brim with gold in the center piled high. On the sides are shelves filled with jewelry, books and other things like trunks to name a few.</p><p>“Where did all this come from?” He whispered.</p><p>“Now, that you are of age and have accepted your lordship you gain full access to your inheritance.” He reached into his pocket and pulled out his coin purse that had an undetectable extension charm and started filling it. He walked around and inspected the rest of the vault, looking at pictures of his grandparents and his parents. Harry shrunk the pictures and stuffed them in his bag then walked around some more and lazily looked through the old trunks and smiled at the old clothing his ancestors wore. He made up his mind to return one day and look through everything soaking up the history of his family.</p><p>Walking out of the vaults he returned to the cart as Gravenhawk secured the locks on the vaults. Getting back to the cart Gravenhawk started the cart again taking them deeper into the caves to the Black vaults. Once inside the vault, he was not as shocked this time. He had more gold than he knew what to do with it. He felt guilty for having all of this and the Weasley’s were still struggling. They might have helped save the world but they were still poor and in some sects of society seen as traitors for not living up to their pure blood upbringing. Harry thought of an idea as he looked around the black vault. There were a lot more in the vaults and he wondered if the goblins used expansion charms or if there were more vaults.</p><p>“Gravenhawk, how many vaults does the Potter and the Black family owns?” Harry asked.</p><p>“The Potter have ten vaults and the Blacks have twelve. All equally filled to the top with gold and family heirlooms.  Would you like to see them all?”</p><p>“Not today, but I will definitely return. I still need to figure out what to do with Malfoy’s vaults.” The last part he mumbled to himself as went back to looking around the vault.  No doubt the Le Fay’s also had a vault. Sighing he looked around picking up trinkets and whatnots smiling when he saw Sirius’ initials on most of them. He scanned through the photo album that had Sirius’ name under the title Hogwarts years. Prongs, Moony, Wormtail, and Lily Flower. He scanned through it looking at pictures of his parents, Sirius and Remus. He was thankful that Wormtail was not in a lot of them. Shrinking the album, he shoved it in his jumper pocket.  He was about to leave when a trunk caught his eye with all the stacked parchments spilling out of it.</p><p>Harry walked over to it, lifting the lid. Some of the papers did fall out and Harry ignored them. He wasn’t focused on why he was drawn to the trunk, in the first place considering that there wasn’t anything special about the trunk. Picking up a rolled parchment and was about to stuff them properly into the trunk before closing it when he spotted the journal.  He furrowed his brows in confusion. <em>My Life Through Time</em> was written on the cover. He set the parchments down and picked the journal and opened it to the first page to see who wrote it. <em>Phineas Nigellus Black. </em>There was a picture of an older replica of Sirius smiling and staring back at him. He flipped to the next page and read the introduction.</p><p><em>Chronicles of my life through time. I have lived a privileged life. I'm a Black after all. I have seen the past and the present and have yet to see the future. I have made and fallen love in the past and seen </em><em>the</em><em> pleasures of it in my present…</em>Harry scanned through the rest of the first page and stopped when something caught his eyes. <em>I hid my Time Turner after receiving a letter that the Ministry will be confiscating all registered Time-Turners. My Time Turner was not registered but I did not want to take any chances. No one in my family knew that I had it or of my travels. My Time Turner was unique while others went back a day or two or hours. Mine is designed </em><em>to take me back</em><em> years…</em></p><p>
  <em>What the hell? Go back years? How?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Using my Time Turner, I was able to cheat death, rewrite my wrongs, amass my fortune and meet the love of my life…</em>
</p><p><em>He had a Time Turner that went back years. </em>The last time that he used a Time-Turner was when he and Hermione went back in time to save Sirius. Harry turned to look back at Gravenhawk the goblin was sitting patiently waiting for him. Stuffing the parchments back into the trunk along with the journal. Harry shrunk the trunk and put it in his pocket rather than his bag. He wanted to read more. The possibilities of going back years intrigued him. He found it coincidental that just last night he and Neville talked about what they would do if they could go back in time. He looked around one last time grabbing a few coins and walked out of the vaults. Getting into the cart he remembered his thoughts earlier.</p><p>“Gravenhawk,” he said getting the goblin's attention.</p><p>“Yes, Harry.”</p><p>“Is it possible to add a few coins to the vaults of Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. As well as Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, and Ginevra Weasley.”  The twins were okay they had their joke shop along with Bill as well and Charlie. But giving to Arthur and Molly for all the meals he ate and the times he spent at their home was the least he could and wished he could have done more.</p><p>“I can. Which account should I draw the funds from?”</p><p>“The Potter vaults,”  Harry answered. He wanted to give them the gifts from his account.  Gravenhawk nodded and they were on their way.</p><p>“Very well, Harry.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p align="left"> Harry had no idea what he was looking at or what happened to the mild-mannered person that used to be Neville. He stared in horror as he watched his friend flint from one rack or counter to another picking up articles of clothing either smiling or scowling. The ones he liked was thrown over his arm and the ones he found not to his liking was put back. Luna standing beside him agreeing or disagreeing with his choice. Harry had picked out a pair of jeans and what he considered a nice shirt and was about to pay for his items before Neville stopped him in his tracks.</p><p>“Nope, those won't do, Harry,” he said handing them to the clerk to put back. “We are going to have fun this weekend and the frumpy look will not do.”</p><p>He was told to stand in that one spot and not move. And frankly, he was afraid too afraid to move even an inch.  The look on Neville’s face scared him worse than Voldemort. “He's fucking mental,” Harry whispered.  Neville and Luna walked back over to him with both arms filled more clothes than Harry had ever seen in Dudley’s closet in a year.</p><p>“Now, let's head to the dressing room, I want to see how these look on you.”</p><p>“Nev, seriously, I don't need all of this. It's too much I…”</p><p>“Listen, Harry, for the past seven years I had to watch you wear your cousins cast offs.  I've watched you care for everyone else and not yourself. So now it's time for someone to take care of you.”</p><p>“That's right,” Luna agreed. “Come along big brother, time to try on your clothes,” she told him walking away.</p><p>“I'm not getting out of this, am I?”</p><p>“Not even in the slightest,” Neville told him. “This is only the beginning, Harry.”</p><p>If only Harry knew how true those words were. By the end of their shopping trip, Harry had a whole new wardrobe that included new underwear, robe;  formal and everyday wear. Jeans, t-shirts, watches, shoes and so many other things Harry had no idea he needed. He had to admit trying on clothes that fit his slim form felt great. He surprised his friends and himself when he picked up a black dragonhide leather pants trying them on.  He blushed when the sales clerk literally walked into the wall checking him out.  That had been a few hours ago, they were in muggle London heading to a hotel when they passed by a tattoo parlor.</p><p>Harry had always been fascinated with body art and he could not help but stop and watch.  This was different than seeing the dark mark. This was something indescribable. He had a secret desire to be an artist. Harry could sit for hours on end sketching and drawing anything that came to his mind. Although, he’d never shared his desires with his friends not only because of the war. He doesn’t know how they would react knowing that he didn’t want to do the same things they wanted. Ron want to be an Auror, it’s his dream job. Hermione want to work for the Ministry of Magic. He wasn’t sure about Luna and Neville since they never talk about their future incessantly like Hermione and Ron did.</p><p>“Maybe before the weekend is over we will get one to mark our fun adventure,” Neville said beside him.</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry answered watching the expression on the man face who was getting a tattoo. The only word that came to mind was pleasure. <em>I never knew it could be pleasurable.</em></p><p> </p><hr/><p align="left">The base of the music was pumping through Harry’s body as he stood at the bar watching his friends dance. After shopping, they had checked into a hotel. Getting joint rooms with separate bedrooms and bathrooms. Harry and Neville stayed in one part, and Luna had her own. After checking in, they had dinner and asked their waiter who could not stop flirting with Neville where was the hottest club was.  Their waiter told them with a promise that Neville would save all his dances for him. After Neville promised their server Shawn, Sam, whatever his name was, gave them the name of the club which was called <em>Stroke</em>.</p><p>Harry wore the dragonhide leather pants that he bought and black boots that gave him some height to his short stature. He paired it with a green button down silk shirt that Luna and Neville said made his eyes pop.  He was a bit hesitant at first when they walked into the club, because Harry wasn't sure what to expect. He'd never been able to let loose and had fun simply because it was fun. His entire life revolved around the war and protecting the Wizarding world.</p><p>Neville must have realized Harry was completely out of his element and to loosen him up handing him a glass of something. The alcohol hit his system quicker than he was expecting. But it wasn't enough to put him at ease. Neville and Luna, on the other hand, haven't walked off the dance floor. He had to admit they had rhythm and danced with anyone that came up in front or behind them. He envied their adventurous side and hoped he’d be able to loosen up soon and have some fun the way they were.</p><p>“Would you like to dance?” The question threw him for a loop. He turned and was face to face with a tall blonde with piercing blue eyes.  </p><p>Harry looked over to his left to see who the guy was talking to.  The guy on his left was in a deep conversation. “Um, are you talking to me?” He asked looking back at the blonde.</p><p>“Yes,” he answered with a dazzling smile.</p><p>“Um... sure,” Harry said. “My name is Phil, by the way,” the blonde said introducing himself.</p><p>“Harry, he said introducing himself.”</p><p>They moved to the dance floor just as the music changed to a much slower beat. Phil wrapped one of his arms around Harry's waist and gently stepped closer to him. Harry tentatively placed his hands on the other man’s firm muscular biceps as they started to dance. Harry's heart was beating so fast it could probably be heard over the music.</p><p>“I've been watching you all night,” Phil leaned in close whispering in Harry’s ear.</p><p>“Really?” Harry asked in surprise hoping that Phil didn’t notice.</p><p>“The first thing I noticed about you is your eyes. I've never seen such a unique set of green eyes attached to a beautiful face.”</p><p>Harry's felt his face heat up. “Thank you,” he said shyly.</p><p>Harry rested his head on Phil's chest as they continued to dance. The erotic beat of the music thrummed through him and Harry started to feel comfortable in Phil’s arms. Phil slowly slid his hand down to the middle of Harry’s back pulling him closer. Harry gasped when he felt Phil’s erection against his belly. He pulled his head back slightly and looked up at Phil who was staring down at him. He was bisexual, but he’s never had sex with either gender. <em>Could tonight be the night I give up my virginity?</em> Phil leaned down and brushed his lips against Harry’s and his breath catch waiting for more to happen between them. Phil pressed his lips to Harry’s and swallowed his moan. Phil’s fingers continued their journey from the small of his back going down to arse grabbing his globes and squeezing them. Phil’s lips moved against his before he sucked Harry’s bottom lip into his mouth sucking and nibbling on it before he covered his mouth again. They kissed like that for a few more minutes in the middle of the dance floor not caring if anyone was watching them. They only stopped kissing because of the need to breathe.</p><p>“Wow,” Harry whispered gasping for breath as he opened his eyes to look at Phil. </p><p>“I take it that I impressed you?” Phil asked with a cocky sigh. Harry simply nodded his head and rest his on Phil’s masculine chest.</p><p>One dance turned into two, and before he knew it, he and Phil were sitting in a booth in the back of the club in a hot and heavy make-out session which was where Neville and Luna found him before things got a bit too far.  Before leaving for their outing, they placed tracking charms on each other as a precaution. They were all for having fun but not be careless being in a life and death situations taught them not to be stupid. On the way, back to their hotel, Harry could not stop smiling, he was able to just be Harry and have some fun for once in his life even if it was for a bit of fun. Fun that didn't have him on his broom, but came close to making him feel that way. They passed by the same tattoo shop from earlier and couldn't believe the shop was open as late as it was.  This time feeling in the moment he walked in followed by Luna and Neville.</p><p>“Nev, do you have any pain relievers on you?”</p><p>“No, I have some in the room along with some hangover potion just in case we get too crazy. Why, are you planning on getting something done now?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry answered, looking around the room at all the colorful art. Nothing caught his eyes at first. He continued to look around until a drawing caught his eyes. It was large, it was in shaded black and white. The drawing spoke to him, and he knew he had to get it no matter the pain, he's been through worse at the cost of his life. The buzzing of the machine sounded like calming waves to him.</p><p>“Can I help you, guys?”</p><p>Harry pulled his attention away from the drawings and looked at the girl behind the counter. Her hair was dyed blue from the roots and black at the ends she had piercings on various parts of her face, and a few in her ears. Harry didn’t mean to stare, but her arms and what part of her chest he could see was covered artfully in tattoos. It was beautiful as was the girl when she smiled at him as if knowing that he was checking her out.</p><p>“Like what you see?” She asked, and Harry didn’t mistake the purr he heard at the end of her question.</p><p>“Your artwork is beautiful,” he said in the way of answering her question.</p><p>She smiled. “Thank you, I did most of them myself.”</p><p>“Really?” He asked in surprise.</p><p>“Yeah, look,” she said, holding out her arm showing Harry a tattoo design of an infinity symbol with the word love on one end and life on the other. “That was the first one I did when I was learning the craft.”  She showed him a few more before asking him the same question from earlier.</p><p>“Yeah, I do,” he said answering her. He turned to look back at Neville and Luna. “Hey guys, I'm going to be a while you can go back to the hotel if you want. I know my way back.”</p><p>“No, Harry that's okay Neville, and I will be getting one as well.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Neville agreed. “But I don't see anything I like. Do you think you could draw something for me, Harry?”  He asked staring pointedly at him.</p><p>“Wh... what do you mean, Neville?” Harry stuttered.</p><p>“Cut the crap, Harry. I've seen the sketchbook you keep hidden from everyone. I know you consider Ron and Hermione, your best friend and in some truths, they are, but I doubt they actually know you. Not like I do, anyway.  You have a talent, Harry, and you hide it, but I can't understand why. So, will you draw something for me to have tattooed on my body?”</p><p>“But Nev a tattoo has to have meaning for you to put something so permanent on your body,” Harry said trying to talk his friend out of doing this.</p><p>“And it will because it will be your gift to me. It will cement you into my life forever.”</p><p>“I agree with, Neville,” Luna added. “I won't get one unless you draw it for me, Harry.”</p><p>“But guys, you don't understand, I'm not that good.” Harry protested.</p><p>“Bullshit,” Neville snapped shutting him up. He reached into his pocket and pulled out his coin purse and pulled out a neatly folded paper and handed it to him.</p><p>“What's this?” Asked Harry.</p><p>“Open it,” Neville said.</p><p>Harry unfolded the paper and gasped. It was a drawing he did a couple of years back. It was a tree that resembled the weeping willow in winter with any leaves on it. Hedwig was sitting on one of the branches, there was a compass on the far right depicting North, South, East, and west. The trunk of the tree was sturdy and rooted in the ground the roots thick and showing new life beneath.  Harry had thrown it away because he didn't think it was that good. He could pick out every flaw in the art, and that bothered him.</p><p>“Where did you find this?” He whispered. Luna stood beside him and gasped.</p><p>“I was cleaning up the common room, and I picked it up. I was going to throw it out, but something told me to open it. And I'm glad I did. Harry that is fucking brilliant it shows so much about time and the beginning of new life, and the many directions we could take to give our life meaning and at the same time knowing that whatever we choose will be the right one. I was moved the first time I saw it, and every time during those hard times I would pull it out and just stare at it. That,” he said, pointing to the paper in Harry's hand. “Gave me hope and strength to do what I needed to do.”</p><p>Luna took the paper out of his hand. “I want this,” she told the clerk.</p><p>Harry gasped and turned to look at her. “Luna what are you doing?”</p><p>“Getting a tattoo, what does it look like,” she said to him in a matter of fact way.</p><p>“But this is not perfect,” he tried to argue.</p><p>“You're wrong,” said the clerk. “Mate, this is fucking awesome. I should know I went to art school. This speaks volumes of emotions,” she said, staring down at the drawing. Then she looked at all three of them. “I just need to see some form of identification to verify you guys are of age.” Without hesitating all three took out their magically made identifications thanks to Seamus that said they were twenty years old. It was the same one they used to get into the club and to buy alcohol. “Alright, you guys are ready to go,” she said, picking up the drawing and tilting her head to the side in Luna’s direction. “Come on back, beautiful, show me exactly where you want this baby to go on that sexy body of yours.” Luna giggled then turned and winked at Harry and Neville.</p><p>“But--” Harry tried to speak but was cut off by Neville.</p><p>“Stop second-guessing yourself,” Neville told him. “Now that Luna has what she wants it's my turn. It looks as if we will be here for a spell so sit down and relax and think of something brilliant for me.”</p><p>Harry shook his head, “you're mental. You're both mental.”</p><p>“Yeah, so deal with it.” Neville shrugged his shoulders. “Now get to work.”</p><p>Harry nodded. “I have one question though.” Neville raised a brow, waiting for the question. “How did you know I did the drawing?”</p><p>“Easy, I saw you with a sketchbook before. But I thought it was a journal.”</p><p>“Oh,” was all Harry could say.</p><p>Harry walked over to the counter and seeing some paper and a few color pens he picked them up and sat in the chair. Neville followed Luna to the bag room, and Harry smiled at how protective Neville was with both of them. The other boy was affected by the war just as Harry had, he'd overcome so much in his young life. Having to deal with the memory of his parents being tortured by Bellatrix and the two LeStrange brothers, and having to watch them deteriorate slowly.  For years, his grandmother did not see him for the man he could become instead seeing him as his father going as far as giving Neville his father's wand.  And also, getting bullied as a kid and even at Hogwarts, before he was able to show how strong he was earning the respect of his peers. Neville became stronger and is now the man who still holds Harry’s hands when he needed a comforting friend. He couldn’t help but think it should be the other way around. Harry remembered reading when he was learning how to become an Amigi that animals and mammals can represent a wizard’s true soul. And then it hit him like a brick over his head, and he started drawing. He lost himself so far in his work that he yelped when there was a light touch on his arm. He looked up, trying clear the haze from his eyes. His brows furrowed when for a split second, he thought he saw Lucius Malfoy staring down at him. He rubbed his eyes opening them and came face to face with Phil from the club.</p><p>“So, we meet again,” he said. “What brings you to my little establishment?”</p><p>“You own this place?” Harry asked him.</p><p>Phil nodded and smiled, then looked down at the paper sitting on Harry’s lap. “I should have pegged you for an artist.”</p><p>“I'm not really an…” he didn't finish his words when the room seemed to shift in and out for a split second. He blinked quickly, and everything seemed just as normal as before.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Phil asked.</p><p>Harry looked up at the other man. “Yeah, I'm good. I think I've been staring at these colors for too long.” He smiled, hoping to reassure the other man.</p><p>“So, you plan on getting some work done?” Phil asked him.</p><p>“Ah, yeah,” he answered, feeling a bit unfocused.</p><p>“Can I see?” Phil extended his hand, and Harry gave him the art he had been working on.</p><p>It was two Koa fishes one was shaded in black and the other red. They formed the yin and yang symbol. There was Kenji written on the right side of the drawing that stood for strength and on the left side that stood for courage. There were red and black lotus flowers surrounding both fishes as they circled in the waves of the water.</p><p>“Wow, this is powerful,” Phil said in awe. “Some might look at it and just see two fishes swimming in a pond, but you’ve opened it up to a different realm. Is this what you're getting?”</p><p>“No, it's for my friend, Neville.”</p><p>“He must mean a lot to you, for you to draw such a powerful statement?”</p><p>“Yeah, he's one of my best friends,” Harry looked from the paper to Phil who was staring at him.</p><p>Harry wasn't sure how he missed it while they were snogging earlier that night, but Phil had a piercing on the corner of his upper lip as well as his eyebrows. He had both the bad boy, good boy next door look going for him. His sleeves were rolled up, and Harry saw that both his arms are littered with tattoos. Harry’s gaze traveled back up to Phil's blue eyes and blushed, realizing the man was still staring at him. Phil licked his lips and seemed as if he was about to say something when they were interrupted.</p><p>“Hey boss, I didn’t expect to see you tonight.” it was the other artist Harry had spotted and his customer that made Harry walk into the parlor.</p><p>Both Phil and Harry jumped apart from each other as if they were caught doing something.</p><p>“I wasn’t planning on but the guy I met and hoped to take home tonight left,” he shrugged and looked at Harry, who knew he was blushing as red as the ripest tomato and looked away. “But maybe my luck is changing.” He heard Phil say, but Harry was not paying attention. There was a drawing the caught his eye. He stared at it for a minute before pulling it down.</p><p>There was something off with it. It was of a Paladin kneeling down with a shield and a sword. Harry sat back down and without asking starting adding more to the drawing. He added large wings and an intricate halo over the Paladin’s head. He lengthened the cloak the Paladin was wearing and added skulls like the ones he saw the night Dumbledore was killed. He lost himself in the drawing adding a few more touches here and there giving the Paladin a more menacing look.  He added red splatter to the sword, shield, wings and on the Paladin’s shirt. As well around and the hem of his cloak that the skull heads were swimming in. He was again interrupted when by a harsher tap on his shoulder. This time it was Neville.</p><p>“Man, you’re completely in the zone, aren't you?”</p><p>“Yeah, sorry.”</p><p>“Don’t apologize,” Neville told him. He reached down and lift up his shirt showing his right side of his body. “Here, take a look.”</p><p>It was his artwork. It was a new feeling for Harry to see something he did staring back at him it. Harry had been so deep into his drawing that he had no idea that Neville had taken the paper and got his tattoo done. It was just as he drew it right down to the colors of the Lotus followers only bigger and matched Neville’s perfect olive complexion. Harry squinted his eyes when he saw writing in the flowers. It was names of the friends they lost in the war, but Harry did not remember adding them. He reached out to trace the flowers, but pulled back quickly when he felt the heat coming from Neville’s skin. “It's okay, you can touch it.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” Harry asked, looking up at his friend.</p><p>“Yeah, I'm still on that adrenaline high, so I won't really feel your touch,” Neville told him. “I have to say getting it gave me a rush I never thought I would have experienced.” He leaned in close so that Harry would hear his next sentence. “I got a  fucking hard on sitting there. It took everything in me not to be embarrassed. I see why people get so many, it made me feel--”</p><p>Harry heard the dreamy tone in his friends' voice and wanted to experience the same thing.  Harry looked back at the tattoo and gently glided his finger over the bruised skin.</p><p>“I really love it, Harry. This is the best birthday gift anyone could have given me.” Neville told him.</p><p>Harry’s hand fell to his lap, and he nodded. He didn't think he did anything spectacular. But as long as Neville was happy, that's all that mattered and as long as he could give the other boy something that was meaningful to their continued growing friendship.  “Where's Luna, I thought she would have been done by now?”</p><p>“She was, but there was something else she wanted to add. She said it's a surprise for both of us.  She wouldn't even let me see it.” Neville shook his head. “Who knew she was into body art, me too, as a matter of fact. You're corrupting me, Harry.”</p><p>Harry smiled. “Is that a good or bad thing.”</p><p>“It's good; all good. I promise.” Neville sat down next to him and snatched the paper out of his hand. “Bloody hell, did you do this?”</p><p>“Sort of,” Harry said shyly.</p><p>“Is this what you're getting?”</p><p>“No, I just saw it up there and thought it needed a bit more too, you know make a statement.”</p><p>“I think you should get this,” Neville told him.</p><p>“Nah, I already decided to get something else.” He got up and pulled down the drawing of the Chinese lion. Showing it to Neville. “I would like to have them on both of my shoulders that might mean I will have to come back.”</p><p>Neville took the drawing. “Is that your excuse for seeing the good-looking bloke that you were snogging in the back of the club?”</p><p>Harry blushed and shook his head. “I had no idea he owned this place, honestly. “</p><p>“I believe you,” Neville told him.</p><p>Just then Luna walked out from the back with a smile and a dreamy expression on her face. Neville got up and walked over to the counter and paid for Luna’s tattoo without her even asking him to do it. She came and sat down beside him just as Phil walked from the back of the store. They stared at each other Phil smiled at him, and Harry looked away.</p><p>“He's not the one for you, brother of mine,” Luna whispered to him. “The one for you will take time.”</p><p>“What are you talking about?” Harry asked her.</p><p>“You will understand soon, enough,” she said not giving Harry any further information. </p><p>“Your turn, Harry. Loverboy is waiting for you,” Neville said with a smile.</p><p>Harry was about to say that Phil was not his lover when Luna said it for him. “He's not, Harry’s lover and he will never be.” The abruptness in her tone surprised both Harry and Neville they looked away from her and at each other shrugging their shoulders and shaking their heads.</p><p>“You guys can go back to the hotel, you must be exhausted,” he suggested.</p><p>“That’s a brilliant idea,” Luna said. “But I have one better Neville will stay here and I will go back to the hotel and get the healing salve I brought with me.”</p><p>Again, Harry and Neville looked at each other seemingly on the same thought. “Okay, then,” Harry said, kissing her on the cheek before getting up and walking over to the entrance leading to the back of the parlor. “Be careful,” he advised.</p><p>“I will,” she told him getting up. “Oh, and Neville why don't you go back there and keep Harry’s company.”</p><p>“Come on, Luna, he's going to be okay. There are at least three people back there.” Neville protested.</p><p>Harry stood there shocked when Luna gave him the saddest, and bright-eyed look that would melt even Voldemort's heart if he had one.  “Please, I would feel so much better knowing that he had you back there with him. <em>Who taught her that move?</em></p><p>“Damn, she’s good,” he heard Phil say. “A bit overprotective of you, but still good.” As they watch Neville melt to her will.  Harry could only agree.</p><hr/><p align="left">Harry was starting to notice little things and he wondered if anyone one else did. Usually, on or around his birthday he would receive cakes, and gifts from the Weasley family. But this year he got nothing he chalked it up to them still in mourning over losing Percy and his wife. Harry decided to visit the Weasley’s to see how they were doing but when he got to the Burrow there was no one there. The doors were boarded up as if no one ever lived there. He found it strange. He decided to go and see the twins to ask them what happened to the Burrow and his parents. When he walked into Weasley Wizards Wheezes the shop did not look the same as it did the last time he was in there.  It was larger and there were more things on display. He wondered when did the twins had time to make the clothing and shoes he saw on some of the shelves.   There were also more people walking around than he had ever seen before.</p><p>“Hiya, Harry!”</p><p>He turned to see George standing beside him. “Hey George,” he greeted. “I see business is going great.”</p><p>“Nothing like having a dark wizard getting killed to bring people out of hiding to shop,” he said with an infectious smile. “So, what brings you by?”</p><p>“I went by the Burrow…”</p><p>“Ah, yeah, I knew there was something we forgot to tell you. Mom decided to move to Romania to be live with Charlie. With dad and Ginny gone…”</p><p>Harry’s world tilted for a second. He thought he heard George incorrectly. “Wait, George what did you just say?”</p><p>“I said that with Charlie about to be a Dad…”</p><p>“...No before that. About Ginny and Mr. Weasley being gone…”</p><p>George looked at him as if he lost his marbles. “Come on Harry, I know you still blame yourself for Dad’s death but there was nothing you could have done. You told Dumbledore what you saw and if he had listened to Dad would still be alive. As for Ginny, you tried to save her in the Chamber of Secrets but...”</p><p>Harry could breathe, he felt light-headed and the room started to spin. No this couldn’t be happening. <em>Why are things changing</em><em>? No, Percy and his wife were the ones that died could George be wrong?</em> The last thing Harry remembered hearing was George calling his name. Harry snapped his eyes open then covered it because of the bright light. He groaned as he sat up. His body felt as if he'd been hit by the Hogwarts Express.</p><p>“You're up.”</p><p>Harry moved his hands from over his eyes and looked at George. “What happened?” He asked.</p><p>“I don’t know you tell me. I told you, Mom, Dad, and Ginny went to Romania to see Charlie and you passed out.”</p><p>Harry's eyes widened in shock. <em>That wasn't what George said earlier</em>. He distinctly remembered him saying that Arthur and Ginny died.</p><p>“Are you ok?” George asked and Harry could hear the worry in his voice.</p><p>
  <em>No, I'm not. I think I'm losing my fucking mind.</em>
</p><p>“Yeah, I'm fine,” he said. “Just got a little light head. Partied too much this weekend with Luna and Neville celebrating our birthday.”</p><p>George's eyes widen. “Bloody hell, I forgot and I'm sure, Mom did as well. She's going to feel really guilty she forgot.”</p><p>“No, it's cool. I understand,” Harry said hurriedly.</p><p>“No, it's not, Harry you're family. And we Weasley always take care of our family. I'm owling Mom now…”</p><p>“No, don't do that, really,” he said stopping George. “Look, I'm just honored you guys took me in and welcomed me as a part of your family. Forgetting one birthday is not a crime or a big deal. I'm fine.” </p><p>Harry hoped George would back down and was glad when he did. Harry stayed and talked with George some more about mundane things. Soon Fred joined them to check on him. He ate dinner with them and laugh at their silliness. Everything seemed normal and he wondered if he told George the truth that it was a late response to his weekend.  After leaving the twins he went back to Hogwarts. It was weird walking through the quiet halls. He was passing by the Great Hall when he heard voices. He looked at his watch and saw that it was still early. He opened the door and was shocked to see the hall filled with people. He didn't recognize any of the people sitting at the tables. Someone laughed and it sounded so familiar to him.</p><p><em>I'm going crazy, that's got to be it. I'm losing my fucking mind.  </em>He closed his eyes and covered his ears blocking out the sound of the filled hall. <em>Maybe when I open my eyes things would go back to normal.</em></p><p>Taking large deep breaths Harry counted to ten before opening his eyes slowly and removed his hands from his ear covered. He sagged against the doors as tears filled his eyes he was definitely going crazy. The hall was still filled with students and to make it worse they were all looking in his direction as if waiting for him to say something.  He was shaking his head not understanding what he was seeing. He turned and ran from the Great Hall to his quarters opening the door bolting it with every protection charm that he could think of. He slid down the ground with his back to the door and his head in his hand.</p><p><em>Oh, Merlin, I'm going crazy. I survived the war but not my sanity</em>. He wanted to cry but couldn't. He raised his head looking around his quarters' everything looked just how he left it earlier that day before going to the Burrow. His sketchbook on his unmade bed. His trunk open and his invisibility cloak thrown over the back of his chair and Phineas Nigellus Black journal sitting on his desk. Getting up he walked over to his desk and picked it up flipping to any page. He needed something to take his mind off the fact that he was going batshit crazy.</p><p><em>I thought I was going insane.</em> Harry started reading. <em>I kept seeing people that I knew </em><em>to be</em><em> dead. Hearing voices that weren't there. I was ready to see a mind healer and have them commit me to St. Mungo's. I couldn't explain what was happening. Then one day I heard my older sister and mother speaking about me. They were talking about the fact that I died ten minutes after I was born. The healers did everything that they could to bring me back to life. </em><em>And for </em><em>thirty minutes, they worked on my tiny little body until I started breathing again. I stood there and listened as my mother teared up telling the story. I remembered when I was ten years old a year before I started attending Hogwarts I was visited by someone in my dream who told me I was going to change the course of my life and that it would affect others. But I should never be afraid to change my past to make the future better. I had no idea what they were talking about, </em><em>it was a dream after all and </em><em>I was a child for Merlin’s sake. What the hell did I know about changing my past </em><em>and</em> <em>my life was just beginning</em><em>?</em></p><p><em>All I could think about was that I was going to Hogwarts the famous school of Witchcraft and Wizardry and that I was going to learn more</em> <em> about magic. Even after coming in contact with the Time Turner the first time I held one in the palm of my hand I did not think about that dream. Listening to my mother and sister talk, I wondered if </em> <em>because I died</em> <em> as a child could possibly relate to changing time. I left my sister and mother to their conversation none the wiser that I heard them. I ran to our library and started to research through all the books we had on time relativity and death. With </em> <em>everything,</em> <em> I found I was still confused. Nothing was definitive </em> <em>it</em> <em> was all speculation. I wanted to give up, but I needed to test a theory I had.</em></p><p><em>I had the idea to build</em><em> my own Time Turner. But where the Ministry made theirs that would take the holder back hours or a day I built mine to go back years. I wasn't sure that it would work, but I had to </em><em>give it a </em><em>try. My first trip back, I went back to the night I was born. I was surprised that it worked and that I was watching the healers worked tirelessly as they tried to bring me back to life. I was only able to stay a few minutes before I was pushed back into the present. I acknowledged that were still improvements that needed to be made. I needed to stay longer </em><em>the next</em> <em>time I went back</em><em>.</em></p><p><em>What I didn't realize at first was that my short trip in time changed something no matter how minuscule it was. I </em> <em>spent years working on my Time Turner, I closed myself off to the world around me</em> <em>. </em> <em>I became a man obsessed with time, I wanted to conquer it, and yet, I wasn’t certain if the Time Turner I was building would work. But I couldn’t give up</em> <em>, </em> <em>this was more than mere curiosity, I wanted to take the chance to change my past. </em> <em> </em></p><p><em>My second trip </em> <em>this time I went back</em> <em> hours before I was born and </em> <em>found out</em> <em> the reason why I died ten minutes after I was born. My Mother was hit by a stray curse. The curse and the shock caused her to go into labor, and she was rushed to St. Mungo's where she gave birth.  The doctors thought that I would be spared from the effects of the curse. Now knowing what happened again, I returned to the present before trying again to go back to the past. I was able to go back saving my mother from being hit with the stray curse hence saving my unborn life. The shock factor, however, did not change.</em></p><p>
  <em>Being helped by a strange man and the thought of almost being hit by a curse sent my Mother into labor. After correcting my past, I did not realize how much I changed my future. My sister was born three years later with a defect. She was born a squib. I went back once again and corrected the past. I was able to stay a bit longer ensuring that my family would not be affected. I learned how to intervene without anyone the wiser about who I was or where I'm from.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Going back and forth became like an addicted drug. I would go back to the past to stop myself from making a stupid mistake. I benefited from it financially and personally. I righted any wrongs that befell on my family. I continued for many years never growing tired or bored. Each time I traveled I was able to stay longer in the past; sometimes years before returning back to the present. Everything was perfect in my life until I met her. The woman I would eventually meet and marry. The one that would force me to lock away my Time Turner and live in the present.</em>
</p><p>Harry jumped when there was a knock on his door. He got up and stretched, looking out the window, seeing that the sun was up. <em>Fuck, it's morning. </em>He yawned throwing the journal on the bed and answered the door. It was Neville.</p><p>“Hey,” Neville said, looking at him. “How come you're in the same clothes? Please, don't tell you slept with that guy Phil? Better yet, don't tell me if Luna finds out she will blame me. She's been in a mother mode trying to protect your virtue and mine when there's no virtue to protect in my case anyway.” </p><p>Harry chuckled. “You dog.” Neville blushed Harry also didn’t ask questions when or who it was that took his friends virginity. Honestly, he didn’t want to know.</p><p>“So, did you?” Neville asked.</p><p>“No, I got in from seeing the twins last night and got caught in reading,” he told Neville skirting the truth just a bit.</p><p>“Good,” he said with relief. “What are you reading?”</p><p>“A book I found in the Black vaults.” </p><p>“Cool, well anyway, I came by to see if you wanted to have breakfast in the hall before everyone got here and started working on the east wing.”</p><p>“Yeah, sure let me grab a quick shower and meet you there.”</p><p>“Alright, see you in a bit, yeah,” Neville told him, walking away.</p><p>Harry closed the door. <em>Well, things seem the same so far. </em>He didn't understand what was happening, but reading the journal was giving him some perspective. At least he wasn’t going crazy.</p><hr/><p align="left">Harry walked into his room and fell on his bed, he was utterly exhausted. Before they could strengthen the wards on the east side of the Castle they had to remove the rubble. It was suggested they did that by hand than using magic. It took them hours to remove the rubble and many more hours to rest the wards. Professor McGonagall would love to get the Castle up and running by September or right before the start of the new school term. Letters were already sent out with a notification that in the even the Castle repairs were not completed in time school work will be sent to their home and students were to have them completed until Hogwarts doors will be reopened. The entire time Harry worked, he couldn’t stop thinking about what he read in Phineas Nigellus Black journal. He needed to find the Time Turner. He'd made up his mind that he was going to go back and change the past, Harry had a plan, and he hoped that it would work. But he was going to stop Voldemort before he could reign havoc on the Wizarding world. He was going to save his and Neville’s parents.</p><p>He got up off his bed and walked over to Phineas Black’s trunk that was sitting off in the corner of the room. Stooping down, he cleared the parchments off the top and starting digging around the trunk hoping to hit gold. He wondered if he should tell Luna and Neville or even Ron and Hermione about what he was planning on doing. But thought better of it Hermione would try to talk him out of citing many books on why what he’s wanted to do was a terrible idea, Ron would think he was mental and was simply looking for more attention.</p><p>He loved Ron, but sometimes the guy lets his jealousy shows and puts a rift between their relationship. Harry had no idea what Luna and Neville would say they would probably tell him he was mental. But he didn’t want to put them in any more danger than he’d already had with the war. They’ve stuck with him through everything, and it was time for him to do things on his own. He stopped his search when he realized that he wasn’t getting anywhere.</p><p><em>Did</em> <em> he </em> <em>leave</em> <em> some clue as to where he hid it in his journal?</em></p><p>Getting up, he grabbed the journal off the bed scanning it quickly looking for any words that could give him a clue. There was nothing. The only word that was mentioned just as much as Time Turner was the word trunk and Harry had already searched that. Then something occurred to him. When he was living with the Dursley’s, he would hide things that were valuable to him under the loose floorboard in his bedroom. He looked over at the trunk and wondered if it could be hidden, deeper, magical trunks could be a tiny apartment if the owner wanted it to be. It didn't have to be on the surface. He threw the journal down and walked back over to the trunk this time taking everything out of it and throwing the contents to the floor not caring where they ended up. There was a brown velvet tarp covering the inside of the trunk. Harry started tapping the side and the bottom until he heard the hollow sound. Smiling, he pulled it and had to move back as the trunk grew in size.</p><p>He waited until it was finished before he scooted back over to it looking inside and saw the steps leading down. It was a bit dark, he reached over and got the lamp off his desk so that he would be able to see better. There wasn’t much he could see and realized that he needed to actually go into the trunk.  He stepped inside and got down to the bottom. The inside was bloody amazing. <em>Magic is fucking awesome. </em>It looked like an old fashion classic apartment like the ones you saw in black and white films. He giggled with glee as he looked around. His eyes darted from the bookshelf to the kitchen off to the side. There were two doors adjacent each other. Harry walked over standing in between the doors before he opened one of them and peeked inside it was a fully furnished bedroom. He walked over to the other one and opened the other door that held a huge bathroom, he turned on the faucet.</p><p>
  <em>Full functional that's good I guess.</em>
</p><p>Walking out the bathroom, he closed the door and turned around and gasped when he saw Neville and Luna standing there looking at him. <em>How come I didn't hear them when they came down. How did they get in my room, I was certain I locked the door?</em></p><p>“Hey, guys, what's going on?”</p><p>They looked at each other and shook their heads. “I don’t know, Harry you tell us,” Luna beamed.</p><p>“When did you get this trunk, it's freaking awesome?” Neville asked looking around.</p><p>“It's belonged to Phineas Nigellus Black. I took out of the Black vault when I went to the bank the other day.”</p><p>“Are you planning on keeping it? I think you should. Maybe upgrade it a bit more. I'm sure it would cost a good sack of gold and maybe a few more,” Neville told him, walking around inspecting the trunk like Harry did.</p><p>Harry looked around agreeing with Neville. The trunk was still in good condition and could definitely use a bit of upgrading. He looked away when he heard Luna gasped. Harry walked over to see what caught her attention and he couldn’t believe it. Hiding in plain sight was the Time Turner in the form of a pocket watch, instead of numbers to tell time it was years. It was in a glass case, and Harry prayed it was not an impenetrable one.</p><p>“What is it?” Neville asked.</p><p>“It's a Time Turner,” Luna answered for him. She looked over at Harry and then at Neville. They stared at each other as if speaking telepathically. “I think it's time we tell him, Neville. He'll understand, trust me.”</p><p>“Tell me what?” Harry asked.</p><p>“That I've been hearing voices and Luna’s been seeing things. Or rather people.” </p><p> </p><hr/><p align="left">“This seriously cannot be happening,” Harry said for the fifth time. They were sitting on the leather chairs still inside the trunk talking with Luna and Neville. He explained what's been happening to him in the past couple of days and what he read in the journal also adding Phineas Black theory about time and death. Neville told him the story his grandmother never told a soul but him. It just so happens that the night his parents were tortured his grandmother, mother found him not breathing. Neville's body was still warm, and she figured that he had stopped breathing mere seconds before she had arrived. His grandmother used <em>erenivate </em>on him three times to bring back to life. After he reached his age of majority a couple of days ago, he started hearing things. Just like Harry, he thought he was going mad.</p><p>Luna, on the other hand, had an entirely different experience since she was a little girl, she's been able to see some things happen, they weren’t always clear and took her a while before she was able to understand exactly what she was seeing. She told the story of seeing her mother died before it happened and how she tried to stop it. But her mother didn't believe her and ended up getting killed anyway, and that seeing happened twice broke her. For a while, she refused to acknowledge the things she saw or talk about them until she met Harry who listened and believed her. But lately, things have been a bit more vivid and sometimes confusing. It was as if she was in two places at the same time, but standing still watching others move around her.</p><p>“I know this might sound crazy,” Harry said.  “But yesterday I walked into the Great Hall, and I heard Sirius laughing, I knew that it couldn't be him because I know he's dead.”</p><p>“I saw my mother sitting in class while listening to a lecture, I'm not sure who was teaching, but she was bored,” Luna told them.</p><p>“I heard my dad talking to someone about asking my mum out,” Neville added.</p><p>They all sat in silence thinking about what it could all mean. Harry was wondering if his plan to go back to that past and try to stop Voldemort was a far-reaching goal or a stupid idea. He looked up when Luna spoke breaking the silence.</p><p>“I know what you guys are thinking, and I believe that we should do it.”</p><p>“What are you talking about?” Harry asked.</p><p>“You were both thinking that we should go back to the past. You, Harry want to see your parents, Sirius and Remus. Neville wants to see his Mum and Dad.” She looked down at her fingers. “And I want to see my Mum again.” She picked up the pocket watch and held in the palm of her hand. “But if we do this we won't be coming back.”</p><p>Harry's eyes widened in shock<em>. Could they go back to the past and give up on their present? </em>Give up Ron, Hermione, the Weasleys who has been like a family to him in so many ways the Dursley’s never were.</p><p>“I think we should do it,” Neville said.</p><p>“Do you know what you're saying?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Yeah, I know what I'm saying. Besides, wasn't that your plan all along to go and leave us behind. Well, you're not going alone,” Neville argued. “I told you, Harry, you're not alone anymore.”</p><p>Harry tried to think of a way to argue that it was a stupid idea.  <em>What if it didn't work? They could end up in a time loop or something. </em>He looked at the two of them, they were staring at him as if waiting for him to verbally agree. Because as much as Harry tried to talk himself out of doing it. There were so many reasons why he should.</p><p>“Okay,” he finally said. Their faces lit up with a bright smile. “But we have to keep things between us and trust no one else. They might think we're bonkers.  Hell, I think that we’re bonkers.” </p><p>“Awesome!” Neville cheered. Then he looked from Luna to Harry. “I think we need to do something about our looks.” He said.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Well, you look like your Dad, and I've seen pictures of my Mum, I look like her and Luna look like her Dad. So, I think we need to change our appearance. It would cause people to ask too many questions.”</p><p>“I agree,” Luna added. “I also think we should use different names. Well, last names I think.”</p><p>“Are we really doing this?” Harry asked for clarification.</p><p>“Yes!” They both yelled at him not in anger, but in the excitement.</p><p>“Alright, just asking.”</p><p>“I'm so excited,” Luna said getting up. “I get to go to school with my Mum.”</p><p>“Woah, wait a minute,” Harry said stopping her. “School? I was thinking we go back to the night mine and Neville’s parents were attacked.”</p><p>Not deterred, “No silly, we need to be their friends first that way we can stop the danger. You, Harry, can stop Peter Pettigrew from joining Voldemort or at least from betraying them. You can save Snape’s and your Mum’s friendship. And Neville can stop Bella and the LeStranges from torturing your parents.”</p><p>“Just think of the possibilities,” Neville said to them.</p><p>“What about you? What or who will you stop?”  Harry asked her.</p><p>“Oh, that's easy. Dumbledore from meddling,” she answered.</p><p>“And how are you going to do that?” Neville asked her. “And what exactly will he be meddling in?”</p><p>“I’m not sure, but I will think of something,” she answered. “And as for the other part, our lives.” Luna looked at Harry. “I don’t want you to hate me for saying this.”</p><p>“Luna, I could never hate you, no matter what,” Harry told her.</p><p>“But what I’m about to say goes against how you might feel about Dumbledore. He was your mentor; I saw how broken up you were when he died,” she explained.</p><p>Harry and Neville looked at each other, and he got the feeling that his friends were about to tell him something he’s not going to like hearing. “Do you know what she’s going to say?”</p><p>“I think so, and I have to say, Harry, I agree with her,” Neville told him.</p><p>Harry sighed and braced himself to hear what they had to say. “Okay, tell me.”</p><p>Luna scooted closer to him taking one of his hands into both of hers. “Harry, I love you and have seen you as my brother since the day I met you. You and Neville were the only two guys that never looked at me like I was crazy.”</p><p>“That because you’re not,” Harry said touching her cheek and Neville leaned in to kiss her.</p><p>“Harry’s right,” he told her once he pulled back. “I would say you’re insightful.”</p><p>“That’s nice of you to say, Nev.,” she told him.</p><p>“It’s the truth,” Harry added.</p><p>She smiled at them then her face turned somber. “My dad and I tried to adopt you,” Luna said looking directly at Harry.</p><p>“What?” Both Harry and Neville said together.</p><p>“I knew what was happening to you at your relatives and I told my father. He went to Dumbledore to petition to be your magical guardian, but the headmaster was against it. When dad threatened to got to the Hogwarts Board Governs it was as if he became someone different. And that’s when he did it--”</p><p>Luna stopped speaking, and Harry looked at Neville who looked just as shocked as him.</p><p>“What did he do?” Neville asked instead of Harry.</p><p>“He obliviated us, or he thought he did,” she told him. “Obliviation has never worked on our family. Just as how the imperious curse will never work on Harry.”</p><p>Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “Why… Why didn’t you tell me?”</p><p>“You weren’t ready at the time to hear it, I’m not even sure if you are now,” she whispered.</p><p>“What else?” Harry asked his tone laced with sharp steel.</p><p>“Are you sure you want me to go on?” Luna asked him.</p><p>“Yes,” he answered. He needed to know how much influence Dumbledore had in his life.</p><p>“My father and I had a theory. He needed you to be submissive to do what he wanted, to win the war and have the wizarding world see him as the light lord always. I don’t think he told the Dursely’s to treat you the way they did, that was their hatred for magic, but Dumbledore did nothing to stop it. I do think he cared about you in the beginning but later saw you as a pawn.”</p><p>Harry was shaking inside; he had long since thought that Dumbledore was using it but to hear it from someone else’s mouth rings true to him. <em>Who else thought that? Ron and Hermione? What about the Weasley’s?</em></p><p>“Do you think Ron and Hermione saw the same thing?” Harry asked. “What about you, Neville?”</p><p>“I knew your life at home was unhappy and yeah, I tried talking to Gram about it, but she wouldn’t listen and said Dumbledore wouldn’t put you in harm's way,” Neville told him. “It was then I decided to make sure that you were safe whenever you came back.”</p><p>“Did you befriend me out of pity?” He snapped.</p><p>Neville cuffed him on the back of the head lightly. “Cut it out,” he told Harry. “I’ve never pitied you.”</p><p>“Then what?” Harry asked rubbing the back of his head as his anger died down some. “Why did you want to be my friend?”</p><p>“Because of who you are,” Neville said he saw Luna nodded out of the corner of his eye. “While the world saw Harry Potter or whatever name they decide to give you this week. I saw Harry, a boy who was born a couple of hours after me. A boy who wears his heart on his sleeve with no one to protect him. A boy who just wants to be left alone and not be seen as a hero. I saw someone who just wants go for a fly on his broom and let the wind blow through his hair just because. That’s why I wanted to be your friend. That’s why I see you like family.”</p><p>Harry was speechless; he’d never heard Neville speak like that before.</p><p>“Damn, Neville that was beautiful,” Luna said Harry turned his head to look at her, tears were streaming down her cheek. “I feel the same way, you know? I never saw you the way the wizarding world did. I saw, Harry.”</p><p><em>Gods and deity these two are going to make me cry.</em> But that was what he loved about Neville and Luna, they were honest with him and spoke to him as if he mattered. He reached up and dried her tears. “No, tears, Luna, I’m okay,” he rested his forehead against hers. “We are okay,” he whispered, and she nodded. He raised head and smiled. Their conversation wasn’t over he wanted to know everything they were thinking. “What about Ron and Hermione?”</p><p>Lina sighed. “I—I don’t think they wanted to go along with Dumbledore, but they didn’t have a choice. The Weasley’s aren’t well off as we all know, and I think Dumbledore made some sort of deal with a couple members of the family. Not the twin’s or Mr. and Mrs. Weasley or the older children, I’m sure if he proposed any kind of deal with them, they would have brought him up on charges. She really loves you and sees you had her child. But I do think that Ron, Ginny, and Hermione liked you, and was envious of you at the same time.”</p><p>“Why?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Because you have what they want,” Neville answered.</p><p>“That doesn’t make any sense, Nev,” Harry argued back. “They’ve been with me from the beginning what reasons do they have for being envious.”</p><p>“Man your daft,” Neville said shaking, his head with a smile on his face took away the insult. “You hide your O.W.L. results from Hermione every year letting her think she has the highest score in our house and year.”</p><p>“Ho… how did you know that?” Harry asked.</p><p>“My Gram was my proxy on the school governs board. I got to see the results after every meeting,” Neville told him. “Didn’t you realize that Hermione was jealous at how intelligent you are and every year, Ron would help her keep you unfocused in class. But they had no idea you were studying at night and on weekends. It used to drive them crazy when they couldn’t find you.”</p><p>“And when you’re all put together, you are sexy as hell,” Luna added. “Girls flocked to you and not, Ron even though he had eyes for Hermione. Boy am I lucky they finally told each other how they feel.”</p><p>All three smiled at that.</p><p>“I agree with, Luna, I think Hermione and Ron did and still do like you. And if it hadn’t happened already, expect them to start distancing themselves from you. Ginny will do what her brother says.”</p><p>They were silent for a few minutes, both leaving Harry to his thoughts. Harry was angry at what he heard, and to some degree he suspected it. But it seemed Luna and Neville had put more thought into what was happened more than he did. “I think we need to do this,” Harry said breaking the silence. “I think it will be good for us to change the timeline fix what’s broken and have a life we should have.” He looked at both his friends. “I know we already made a pack, but I want to make it stronger. We stick together and do this with love and honesty between each other. I know we will keep secrets from each other, but let’s not keep ones that will put the other in danger. We do this as a family.”</p><p>“Okay,” Luna said after a few minutes.</p><p>“I’m with you all the way Harry, always have and will,” Neville agreed.</p><p>With that out of the way, they stayed in the trunk a few hours longer and came up with a plan. First thing, the next morning he and Neville will visit Gringotts and withdraw all their funds. Then shopping and stuff they will need to take on their new appearances. Luna suggested that Harry should blood adopt her as his little sister. With a plan in mind, they left the trunk and the watch. Harry secured it with a password in Parseltongue. They went to the kitchen instead of having supper in the Great Hall where they would be able to discuss things without anyone interrupting them. The elves were all too happy to have company and didn’t pay attention to what they were talking about. They all agreed that there was a lot to do before they went back to the past.</p><hr/><p align="left">As promised early the next day Harry, Neville and Luna went to Gringotts. When they walked up to the first available teller. It was the same one Baggor that helped him the last time he visited.</p><p>“Good morning, Lo... Harry. How may I be of assistance to you?” Baggor asked. Harry didn’t miss the slip in almost calling him Lord.</p><p>“Good morning, Baggor. Is it possible for us to see our bank manager together? We have a few things we would really like to discuss with him.”</p><p>Baggor looked at all three of them before leaning in closer. “I take it that's it's a matter of delicacy and you will be here for a while?”</p><p>“Yes, that's right,” Neville answered.</p><p>“Very well, follow me,” Baggor told them getting down from his stand.</p><p>This time they went a different direction. Harry and Neville looked at each other while Luna walked beside Baggor talking to him about what Harry had no idea. “Do you get the feeling that they know what we are about to do, or am I being paranoid?”</p><p>“Maybe your paranoia is rubbing off on me, because I feel the same way,” Neville answer.</p><p>They walked up a set of winding stairs and down a very long corridor before stopping in front of a gold door. “Please, gentlemen and young lady,” he said to them pushing open the heavy gold door. “Make yourselves comfortable and your managers will be with you shortly.” He looked at Harry. “Before you leave let me say thank you all for your marvelous work and sacrifice.” He closed the door and left them alone.</p><p>“I keep getting the Twilight Zone feeling,” Harry mumbled. It didn't seem that Luna or Neville heard him. They were busy looking around the room they were it. It seemed like a suit made for royalty. Harry was about to say something when the door opened, and Gravenhawk and another goblin entered the room.</p><p>“Harry,” Gravenhawk greeted with a bow.</p><p>Harry bowed as well in respect. “Master Gravenhawk.”</p><p>“Lord Longbottom,” the other goblin did the same thing.</p><p>“Master Bradlock, and please remember it’s, Neville.”</p><p>Luna bowed to both goblins as they acknowledged her.  Everyone sat down and got comfortable.</p><p>“Now, gentlemen and Lady what can we do for you?” Bradlock asked.</p><p>“We would like to withdraw all of our funds from our vaults,” Harry told them. He watched for their reactions.</p><p>“May we ask why, Harry?” Gravenhawk asked.</p><p>“We are going on a long trip…”</p><p>Harry didn’t get to finish what he was saying before Gravenhawk interrupted him. “Could this have something to do with the trunk you took from the Black vault and a particular object hidden inside of it?”</p><p>Harry was shocked he didn't realize that the goblin was watching him that closely. “You know about the trunk?”</p><p>“We are aware of a great many things, Harry,” Bradlock said to him. “And we will help you.”</p><p>“What!” All three said together.</p><p>“Show it to them,” Gravenhawk said to Bradlock.</p><p>Bradlock nodded and stood, pulling out an envelope from the inside pocket of his jacket and hand it to Harry who opened it and started to read.</p><p>Masters Gravenhawk and Bradlock,</p><p><em>A few months after the fall of the Dark Lord Voldemort, you will be visited by three young people requesting your help. They will be taking a very long trip to repair a time in the past. Please assist them in whatever they request. These brave young people will be sacrificing their present and </em> <em>future to repair the past</em> <em>.</em></p><p>Thank you,</p><p>From A Time in Place.</p><p>Harry sighed and gave the letter to Neville for him to read.</p><p>“When did you receive this?” Neville asked.</p><p>“Seven years ago, to the date,” Bradlock answered.</p><p>“That would mean one of wrote this,” Harry summarized.</p><p>“We are not at liberty to say,” Gravenhawk answered. “Now, let me revise our question from earlier. How may we be of assistance to you for your long journey?”</p><p>“And our answer is still the same, we would like to withdraw our entire savings. Also, is there a way you can get us some new names and papers?”</p><p>“Anything else?” Bradlock asked.</p><p>“Yes, some blood, adoption potion, I’m going to adopt Luna as my sister,” Harry told him.</p><p>“We can certainly do that, I’m assuming you would want to change your appearances a bit considering you three have a striking resemblance to your parents?” Gravenhawk asked.  Harry cleared his throat and nodded. “We can help you with that also,” he said. “Very well, we can also finish our business from the other day, L... Harry.”</p><p>“Is it still necessary considering where we are going and what we are doing?” Harry asked.</p><p>“I suppose it is not necessary,” Gravenhawk answered. “However, since you are in the present and we do not know how much of the past will be changed. I think it would be beneficial to accept what Lord Malfoy left to you.”</p><p>“Fine,” Harry sighed. He didn’t understand it, but it seemed the goblins were more prepared for what was about to happen that he was.</p><p>“Splendid, master Bradlock will work on procuring your new identifications as well as the blood, adoption potion for you,” Gravenhawk said then paused. “Might I make a suggestion.” All three nodded. “Since you are both the last heir to the Pendragon and Le Fay title it would be behooving of you to use those as your last name. In our history, Pendragon and La Fey were brother and sister which would easily make Harry and Neville cousins. If you were to be tested or called to show proof of your relation, then there would be solid evidence.”</p><p>Harry looked at Neville and asked, “What do you think?”</p><p>“I think he’s right. Too bad we don’t have any of their blood, then we would be able to mix it with an adoption potion…”</p><p>“L... Neville, I think you would find here at Gringotts we are very resourceful.” Bradlock said.</p><p>“What do you mean, by that?”</p><p>“We’ve kept a lot of secrets for years. During a time when things were chaotic, even before the Dark Lord. The Le Fay and Pendragon family also believed in resurrection and for safekeeping locked away veils of their blood.” Bradlock explained. “Some also thought they were vampires and were born with certain gifts no one has been able to verify, but that is beside the point.”</p><p>“Are you serious?” Luna asked who was silent the entire time.</p><p>“Yes, Miss. Luna.” Gravenhawk answered. “Given the situation, I think using a small drop of their blood will help to change your appearances a bit. However, it would be better once we’ve gotten some of Harry’s blood. The only thing that will not change I’m afraid Harry are your eyes. Enchantress Le Fay had striking green eyes that men once called bewitching. Some believe it as how she caught, Merlin’s attention that started their affair.”</p><p>“That’s fine, I would want to keep something of my mother’s anyway. I don’t want to change everything.”</p><p>“I agree,” Bradlock said. “But Lily Potter nee Evans would not be recognized as your mother,” he said to Harry and continued before he could ask what the goblin meant. “Now, gentlemen and Lady, this is your rooms until we have concluded our business. You are free to leave and return as well.”</p><p>Both goblins got up and left the room, the other three occupants sat in silence not believing what was happening. What started out as a thought and an idea is turning into actual reality. “Are we really…”</p><p>“Don’t ask that question again, Harry,” Neville said, getting up from his chair.</p><p>“But I have to, Neville. Doesn’t this seem I don’t know too easy?” Harry argued getting up from his chair running his hands through his hair.</p><p>“It’s easy because things were set in motion a long time ago,” Luna told him. “Somehow, one of us warned the goblins,” she held up the letter. “This proves it. As much as we want to fight what’s happening or what’s going to happen, we can’t. Fate has already sealed it for us. We just need to go through with our plans.”</p><p>Both Harry and Neville looked at Luna, this was the first time in a very long time they’ve her speak with such a serious tone. She held out her hands for him and Neville, who took it. “We are in this together. I know we made a vow to each other the other night but--” she said.</p><p>“But you want to solidify it more?” Neville asked.</p><p>“Yes,” Luna answered.</p><p>“How?” Harry asked her</p><p>She looked at him a bit timidly before speaking. “With our magic, this way we know how serious we’re taking this venture. We are starting a new life and I can’t see doing that without you two in it.”</p><p>Harry closed his eyes and sighed he knew it would be something like that. “Okay,” he answered.</p><p>“What do you want us to promise?” Neville asked.</p><p>“To always be there for each other, no matter what. To help and encourage each other as well. Also, that when we get to where we are going to keep this between us. We can’t reveal what we are doing until we are sure we can trust that person or persons. And we must all agree with the decision together before telling anyone else.” She looked at them. “We are a family now.”</p><p>Harry looked at Neville, who was also looking at him. Neville nodded in agreement.</p><p>“Okay,” they both agreed.</p><p>Harry felt the tingling of their magic connecting, accepting the simply worded vow that will come to mean so much to them. “I thinking if I could step out for a bit there is something I want to do.”</p><p>“What are you going to do?” Neville asked.</p><p>“I’m just going to run out and do a quick errand,” he said walking to the door. “Don’t wait up for me, I will be back soon.”</p><p>They nodded, and Harry left.</p><p>“Everything is going to be alright, right Luna?” Neville asked.</p><p>“I’m positive it will be, Neville. Where we are going and what we are going to do is going to take time. But we will accomplish it. I have a feeling that our lives are going to change in more ways than one.”</p><p>For some reason, Neville thought he heard the unspoken word ‘again’ at the end of her sentence.</p><p> </p><hr/><p align="left">Harry returned to Gringotts a bit later than he wanted, but he was able to finish his errands. After leaving Luna and Neville, the first place he went to was St. Mungo’s he wanted to make an appointment to have his eyes fixed. He was told that since it was a simple procedure that an appointment was not needed. First, they had to test to see how badly his eyes were damaged and if using a few drops of phoenix tears could easily fix it. The good thing was his eyes were not severely damaged even though he was wearing the wrong prescription. In a matter of an hour, he was walking out of St. Mungo's. His second stop was to a magical hair stylist. He’d always wanted to grow his hair out and was never able to.</p><p>He did not mind having his dad’s wild hair. But if the idea was to go to the past and not look like his father he needed to make a few changes. He explained to the stylist what he wanted, and she gladly told him that she could help tame his hair using the Sleekeazy's Hair Potion and Scalp Treatment that was created by his grandfather, something Harry never knew about. She also used Manegro Potion letting his hair grow a bit longer. Touching the middle of his back with a curled flipped at the ends. After leaving the salon, he apparated into Muggle London and got the tattoo of the ‘<em>Avenging Paladin</em>’ the one he redesigned and took from the store the first time they went. It was a different girl at the front desk, but Phil was there and seemed to have no idea who he was. Harry wondered if Luna did something to the guy when he and Neville weren’t looking. Phil still flirted with him, but that’s as far as things went. Before returning to Gringotts, he took a pain-relieving potion to stop the ache in his back. Although he loved the pain, he didn’t want to be hurting all night long.</p><p>Harry let himself in the quarter’s he’s now sharing with Luna and Neville until the goblins have completed the required paperwork needed for them to have. The entire time Harry still felt as if he was going crazy or an idiot for thinking that this was going to work. The room was quiet, and he assumed Neville and Luna were sleeping, but he was wrong when he walked by one of the rooms and was stopped by Neville’s whistle.</p><p>“Look at you,” Neville said, getting his attention. He stopped and smiled and leaned against the door. Both his companions gasped.</p><p>“What, do I look that bad?” He asked self-consciously.</p><p>“Man, Harry you are beautiful,” Neville said complimenting him. “I like what you’ve done with your hair. Maybe I should do the same. I could see myself as a blonde. Not as blond as Malfoy mind you,” he said, brushing his fingers through his hair.</p><p>“You know, Neville, I can see you as a blonde as well. It will bring out your blue eyes,” Luna added with a nod.</p><p>“Then it’s settled, tomorrow we will make a day of it, I can color my hair and Luna,” he said looking at her. “What about you?”</p><p>“Hmm… I’m not sure yet, but I’ll think of something. It will come to me.” She laid back down. “Come on Harry join us. There’s nothing we can do until the master goblins get back to us.”</p><p>She was right, shrugging his shoulders, Harry kicked off his shoes and hopped into bed with his new family. They talked for a while until one by one they all drifted off to sleep.</p><hr/><p align="left">It took Gravenhawk and Bradlock one week to get everything finalized. Before the week was up the trio continued to help with the renovation of the school. They spent time with the twins at their shop. They complimented him on his new appearance and told him that it was about time that he did something about his appearance. There were many times Harry wanted to tell the twins what he was up to in some ways he trusted them and knew they would support what he was doing because they were simply mental to believe his plan would work. But he chickened out, knowing them, they would want to join him, Harry had also promised Neville and Luna they would keep what they were doing between the three of them. Harry accepted the Malfoy Lordship, but felt it was foolish to do so since, in the end, their main goal of going back to the past was to stop the rise of Voldemort. Harry divided it equally three ways. Not knowing if their plan was going to work, Harry left Mr. and Mrs. Weasley enough gold to last them a lifetime from one of the Potter vaults as a way to thank them for all the meals he ate and the times he spent in their home.</p><p>Neville did indeed change his hair color to blonde. Luna was right, he looked better with his hair lighter it was as if he should have been a blonde at birth. Luna took the Manegro Potion to lengthen her hair to the middle of her back and dyed the ends of her hair purple something Neville or Harry never suspected that she would have been so bold, but it was different and it complimented her well. They were given the adoption potion missed with Le Fay and Pendragon mixed potions. There was a significant change to their appearances. After taking the potion Neville’s hair grew longer stopping at his shoulders, it looked like fine gold thread instead of the blonde he’s dyed it. His eyes that were light blue were cobalt blue as the sea, he also looked refined losing any youthful appearance to it. Luna, who seemed the least bit surprised about her appearance resembled a pixie. With her long curly black, silver, and purple mix color hair complimented her beautiful delicate features her eyes turned ice gray. The only way Harry could describe Luna was to call her a pixie.</p><p>Harry’s features resembled Luna’s. His hair was changed to a mix of black and silver that looked more white in his opinion. His eyes became greener if that was even possible. They looked as if they would glow in the dark. His height did not change he was still the same height. They were now standing in the room of requirement. While they were staying at Gringotts, they decided that leaving from Hogwarts would be better. Considering the Neville and Harry were Hogwarts heirs the Castles, magic would recognize them the goblins agreed and thought it was a sound plan.</p><p>Before leaving Gringotts, Master Gravenhawk gave Harry a letter advising that he must personally hand to his past self and told the trio that there will be someone there to act as their family relation. They will have no need to reveal who they are but the person will serve as their guardian, and in their best interest, they were also leaving in enough time before the start of the new school year to get to know their guardian. They were also given their latest O.W.L’s. Luna will be repeating the sixth year and Harry and Neville their seventh. Harry appreciated their help and told them so.</p><p>“Are we ready to do this?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Yes,” Neville and Luna said together.</p><p>Harry pulled out the watch and opened it. Luna and Neville placed their hands on his shoulders as he set the time for August 1977. If he wanted to change his mind, it was already too late. Harry pressed the knob on the side of the watch and waited for something to happen the way it did when he and Hermione went back in time to save Sirius.</p><p>“I don’t think anything happened,” Harry said after a few minutes of waiting in silence.</p><p>“Are you sure you set the right date?” Neville asked.</p><p>“Yeah,” he answered, looking down at the watch in his hand.</p><p>“We won’t know if anything happened unless we go outside and see for ourselves,” Luna reasoned.</p><p>A door appeared instantly, and they exited the room of requirements. They walked slowly down the halls looking around with curiosity. Hogwarts looked the same as it did a few minutes before they entered the room of requirement. They heard louder footsteps coming down the hall and hid in the first alcove. Harry’s eyes widened the moment he saw the colorful robes and looked at Neville and Luna, who had the same expression of shock on their faces. Harry turned and stared at his mentor and friend who had a perplexed look on his face.</p><p>“I don’t understand it,” Dumbledore mumbled. “I was sure I felt a shift in the wards.” He turned and walked back down the hall.</p><p>Harry, Neville, and Luna did not move from their hiding spot until they were sure the Dumbledore was gone.</p><p>“Did that just happen?” Harry asked unbelievingly. “Was that a younger version of Dumbledore that was just standing not a couple of paces away from us?” He asked again looking at Neville and Luna who was shaking their heads.</p><p>“Oh, my fucking goddess, we did, Harry!” Neville said a bit louder. Harry and Luna shushed him, they didn’t need to be seen, not yet anyway. But Harry knew how he felt they were in the fucking past. He pulled out the watch and looked it. His brows furrowed it now resembled an ordinary watch, and Harry understood that coming back to the past they had no other way to return to the present. He showed Neville and Luna and understand dawned on their faces.</p><p>“Come on, let’s get out here. We have enough time to get to Gringotts,” he told them.</p><p>They nodded and started walking, taking the hidden pathway he remembered from the Marauder's Map that was hidden in the bottom of Phineas Black’s newly refurbished trunk that would be unrecognizable to the previous owner. They made it out safely and down to the shrieking shack where they apparated to Gringotts. It felt like deja vu to Harry, it also seemed as if he’d spent more time at the blasted bank than he did at Hogwarts. Walking up to the nearest teller he was surprised, but should not have been to see Baggor as the teller.</p><p>“How may I help you?” Baggor asked, staring at the three of them in a bizarre way.</p><p>“We would like to see Master Gravenhawk and Master Brodlock, please,” Harry told him.</p><p>“Yes, right this way,” he said hastily.</p><p>He directed them to an empty room and advised them to sit and wait, leaving them alone. Harry was trying, but he couldn’t contain his excitement of actually being in the past. He could tell that Neville and Luna felt the same way. He would have liked to share this moment with Ron and Hermione. But they were taking a different path in life and so was he. </p><p>The doors opened, and younger versions of their bank managers entered the room. “Good day to you gentlemen and lady, we were told you require our assistance,” Gravenhawk said entering the room and taking a seat.</p><p>“Yes,” Harry said, reaching into his pocket and pulling out the letter he was given.</p><p>Gravenhawk took it and started reading. He looked up at all three of them then back down at the letter whatever was written Harry had no idea what was written. Gravenhawk showed the letter to Brodlock who did the same and Harry was wondering if something was wrong. He looked at his friends, and they had the same worry shown on their faces.</p><p>“Quickly, Brodlock, send a message to, Lady Gwendolyn Prince. She needs to be here for her charges,” Gravenhawk ordered. “Also, provide her with a port key.”</p><p><em>Okay</em>, thought Harry. Gravenhawk put his focus back on them. “Um… could you tell us what the letter said,” he asked.</p><p>“Certainly, it states you three are the last remaining descendants of two of the oldest, honorable and noblest houses. The Le Fay and Pendragon. We were asked to ensure that you are protected and care for. We understand that you three have been in hiding and have decided to make your existence known to the world. We understand your need for privacy considering your last names. And we will do our best to care to protect you. Per the letter that was written by your previous guardian who was dying at the time. Stated that your parents died of dragon pox a couple of years ago, and will be in need of a new guardian. Which is why we’ve sent for Lady Gwendolyn whose family have lived and served as guardians to your ancestors. The Princes are aware of their duty should the true heirs make their appearances.”</p><p>“Oh,” was all they could say.</p><p>“I understand that you Duke Pendragon and you as well Duke Le Fay are of magical age. However, a guardian will only act as an assistant should the need arise. As for Lady Le Fay will require a magical guardian until she is of age.”</p><p>“I will act as her guardian,” Harry told him.</p><p>Gravenhawk seemed as if he was about to say something when the door opened and Bradlock stepped forward followed by a very beautiful woman. She had long silver hair and arresting black eyes that reminded Harry of Severus Snape. Then it hit him. <em>Prince as in the half-blood Prince. Shit, she is related to Snape. Fuck me! </em>Luna grabbed onto his sleeve, she must have realized he slipped off into his head.</p><p>“Excuse me?” Harry said, hoping he didn’t look like an idiot in front of her.</p><p>She smiled at him, “It’s okay Harrison, the shock of it all must be affecting you.”</p><p>“Yes, that must be it,” Harry said agreeing with her.</p><p>“Now, I understand you three just got here and must deal with other things.” She reached over and touched Luna’s cheek then Neville’s shoulder. “You three are just darlings. I must insist you call me aunt Gwen, none of that Lady Prince. We are family, is that understood?”</p><p>
  <em>How is she related to Snape? So not like him at all. I like her. Her eyes are kinder than Snape’s.</em>
</p><p>“It’s still early and after we are through here will go to Hogwarts and ensure you three are all set for the new school year before we enjoy the rest of your short summer.”</p><p>“Yes, Aunt Gwen,” Harry found himself, saying without thinking. </p><p>She turned to the two goblins, “I will be waiting outside while you finish here. If I may request a parchment and quill. I would like to inform the Headmaster that I will be stopping by.”</p><p>“Right this way, Lady Prince,” Brodlock said to her. She followed the goblin out, and Harry and his friends got down to business, it took a lot less time than before. And soon they were on their way to Hogwarts.</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><hr/><p align="left">“I can’t believe it's time for you three to leave me,” Gwendolyn said, pulling out her handkerchief dabbing at the corner of her eyes.</p><p>“Don't worry, we will be back for holiday break,” Luna said to her. “And we promise to write as often.”</p><p>“I know, but we've spent such a short time together,” she told them.</p><p>“You promised us you wouldn't embarrass us aunt Gwen,” Neville remained her.</p><p>“You’re right Neville, after all, I'm a lady and should not act un-ladylike in public. Remember that my sweet, Luna.”</p><p>“Yes, Aunty.”</p><p>“Now, let me have a look at you. Stand up straight, Harrison no slouching you're a Duke,” It might have sounded like a reprimand to others if only they could see the smile on her face.  “Neville, you must look after your younger cousins. And Harry, please, watch after your sister. You three need to look out for each other.” Then she looked at them separately. “Harry, make sure Neville eats first thing in the morning he's a bear when he gets up too early. Luna try not to lose anything remember what we did over the summer you write things down before leaving the room. And Harry make sure you wear a sweater on the chilly nights no colds young man.”</p><p>“Yes, Aunt Gwen they said together.</p><p>She touched their faces. “I'm going to miss you guys so much,” she hugged them together. The trio smiled they will miss her also funny enough. “Now, off you go,” they turned to leave, but she stopped them. “And children, please have fun.” They all nodded and walked over to her kissing her on the cheek one by one.</p><p>They got on the train to Hogwarts finding an empty compartment stowing their trunks away and sat down there was a genuine smile on all their faces. Aunt Gwen was very nice along with the rest of the family they’d met. Before leaving Gringotts, they gave the goblins strict orders that Neville, Luna, and Harry are the only ones allowed in their vaults. Harry had brought a few interesting items he wanted to stay hidden. The goblins agreed. As promised they were taken to Hogwarts, where Dumbledore was waiting for them once they arrived. Harry, Luna, and Neville got the distinction that Gwendolyn Prince did not care for the Headmaster one bit. Her answers to his questions were short and to the point. She gave the Headmaster all the required paperwork to attend Hogwarts as well as her proof of her legal status as their magical guardian.</p><p>Harry and the others admit that it was strange seeing and being that close to Dumbledore. The memory of the night the old man died would stay with Harry for a lifetime. However, the Albus Dumbledore the three had met seemed different than the one who always offered a lemon drop even though he knew you wouldn’t take it. They had to perform a few simple tricks or spells to the Headmaster, which they passed with flying colors. Although it wasn't needed for Luna, she gave him a copy of her O.W.L.s. Because she tested well the Headmaster decided to have her start as a seventh-year student rather than a sixth year. They opted unanimously to be sorted with the rest of the first year.</p><p>After dealing with all the paperwork and early school shopping, the trio was off to enjoy their summer in their new timeline. Gwendolyn was fun and also not married or spoken for, she was not as traditional pureblood or the kind of relative he would expect to be related to Snape. It was odd for Harry to see her kind ink black eyes sparkle with mirth. The rest of the summer they acted like little children without a care in the world and to Harry, and the other’s it felt good.  If Gwendolyn suspected something was off about Harry and the rest she did not care or mentioned it. She accepted them without quarrel. When introducing them to other members of the Prince family, she called the trio her new found children. All they could do was smile because they felt like his kids, even in the short time they knew her.</p><p>A tap on his shoulder pulled him from his thoughts. “What are you thinking about?” Neville asked.</p><p>“A lot of things,” he sighed and looked back out the window. “We've been able to pull things off so far.”</p><p>“That's true, don't forget we have a plan,” Neville told him.</p><p>It was true by the end of the year they wanted to get rid of Voldemort or at least find a way to change his mind. Right now, things were quiet, but Harry suspect it will not last. He'd already decided that killing the basilisk, was one of the first things he was going to do so that it wouldn't terrorize the school. The next was finding a way to get close to certain Slytherin and the only way to that was to get sorted into their house which will be easy since the hat wanted him there in the first place.  He just hoped it would be the same this time around.  Getting to Voldemort's Horcruxes will not be easy. The good thing about all of this was that Harry wasn’t plagued by Voldemort's soul or the blinding headaches and the horrible dreams. He still bore the scar, but it was hardly noticeable. If asked, it about the truth was always best, it was a childhood injury. He rubbed his forehead out of habit catching his friends’ attention. Harry would also have to keep the knowledge that he knew how to speak the snake language a secret as well. Unless the Le Fey’s knew how to speak to snakes, something he hasn’t been able to find out about as of yet, they were all still learning more about the LeFey’s and Pendragon’s.</p><p>“Is it bothering you?” Neville asked out of concern.</p><p>“No, it's just force of habit,” he answered.</p><p>“Good,” Neville breath out a sigh of relief.</p><p>“I'm excited,” Luna said beside them apparently changing the subject.</p><p>“Me too, actually,” Neville told them. “I wanted to be someone new, someone, not afraid of taking chances and this had been the biggest one yet.”</p><p>“That's for sure,” Harry said. “Do you think anything has changed in our timeline?”</p><p>“I don't know, we really haven't done anything significant,” Luna answered.</p><p>They were almost to the station and started putting on their school robes.  Harry sat up in his seat as the train pulled into the Hogsmeade station.</p><p>
  <em>That sight never gets old.</em>
</p><p>“No matter how many times we've ridden on this train the site never gets old,” Luna echoed his thoughts. Neville agreed as well. </p><p>The train came to a complete stop, and the trio waited for everyone else to exit before getting off. Harry hadn’t yet spotted his father, godfathers, or mother either. Honestly, he wasn't sure how he was going to react seeing them for the first time.</p><p>“Alright, first years get on the boat, no standing around.”</p><p>“Hagrid,” Harry whispered. He was happy to see the half-giant again. Voldemort had killed him after it was revealed that Harry wasn't dead.</p><p>“Come on, Harry, you can visit him later,” Luna said. Just then Hagrid looked over at them and smiled. Harry smiled back before turning around and getting on the carriages. The carriages started moving as they were being pulled by the Thestrals. Luna reached out and touched its skeletal wings while she spoke to it. He and Neville remained silent and enjoyed the ride.</p><p>They were lined up outside with the first years. Harry smiled, remembering how nervous he did not know what to expect. He also didn't expect this to bring up so many memories.</p><p>“This brings back memories,” Neville said beside him, and Harry nodded in agreement.</p><p>“Mr. Pendragon, Miss. Le Fay and Mr. Le Fay,” Professor McGonagall called their names.</p><p>“Yes, ma’am,” Neville answered for the three of them.</p><p>“You three will be going last after the first years,” she tells them before turning back to the rest of the students.</p><p>“Wow, she sounds like her, but doesn't look quite like her,” Neville said.</p><p>“Get used to it, cousin,” Luna responded. “Everything has changed for us.”</p><hr/><p align="left">Lucius Malfoy sat at the head of the Slytherin table listening to the Headmaster drone on about uninteresting things. As the head boy, Lucius was in charge of the first years in his house. He was excited to be back, especially since it was his last year at Hogwarts and he wanted to make it memorable. He had spent an eventful summer traveling with his father and learning the in's and outs of Malfoy enterprise. They also had a distinguished guest that was staying with them. Someone that was not to be talked about in mixed company.</p><p>His family was dark and have always been since the dawn of time. The name Malfoy struck fear in the hearts of every man, woman, and beast. There’s no one above them. Lucius was aware of how handsome he was, and he used it to his advantage to wield anyone into his bed. Some call him a rogue, but he was not ready to fall in love not even to his betrothed Narcissa Black. He didn’t trust anything he couldn’t control. Which is why love was not on his list of things to do before he drew his last breath. He was called the <em>‘Ice King’</em> for a reason.  He would freely admit to anyone who dared to ask if he was a user and would let it be known that he will never be used. Narcissa was beautiful, but she was not his type. Although she was not as outspoken or insanely crazy as her sister Bellatrix.</p><p>Their betrothal was arranged and will not be built on one of love and trust. If another more influential family with a higher standing than the Blacks came along. He would freely break his betrothal contract with Narcissa and move in for the kill before anyone else had the chance to even consider it. It’s simply a matter of social and hierarchical standing, Lucius didn't believe or cared about love, his father would wholeheartedly stand with him. He was a dominant, an Alpha. Love was for the weak minded and the weak hearted. He believed in living life to its fullest and taking what was rightfully his. He didn't care about finding the perfect spouse or mate.</p><p>Lucius had his own future plans and saw others as pawns pieces on a chessboard. Although, his father followed Tom Riddle a half-blood who fancied himself a Dark Lord. Lucius mentally rolled his eyes. It was only a matter before he made his plans known. He followed no other, nor will he kiss the hem of some cast-off. Lucius knew he was envied for his looks and wealth. But he was worshiped as well. He didn’t care about what others thought of him. He was a Malfoy, and he wore his mane with pride.</p><p>Movement beside him caused Lucius to look over to his best friend, Severus. The other boy had a pensive look on his face. He worried about Severus and wondered what tragedy befell him this summer. He knew about the boy's father abusive nature and have tried to encourage his friend to stay with him during the holidays. Yet, his friend has turned him down time and time again refusing to leave his mother's side. Lucius noticed how quiet, he was on the train ride with their other companions traveling with them.</p><p>“A knot for your thoughts, Severus?”</p><p>The other boy sighed and leaned back in a little in his chair. “My aunt Gwendolyn was at the station this morning,”</p><p>That surprised Lucius. “Was she there to see you off?”</p><p>“No, she was there with three other students that I've never seen before.”</p><p>Lucius raised an eyebrow. “Really now?”</p><p>The sorting ceremony had started, but Lucius wasn’t paying attention.</p><p>“Yes, they called her aunt Gwen,” Severus looked sad, and Lucius wished he had a way to make things easier for his friend. His mother was disowned for marrying a Muggle. <em>Foolish woman.</em> To give up her standing in society for love and to a Muggle by rejecting her rightful mate. <em>I will never allow love to rule my life.</em></p><p>“Maybe you should have spoken to her,” Lucius suggested.</p><p>“It wouldn't make a difference. Gwendolyn made her point clear, my mother nor I, are of any concern to her. She would rather cherish strangers than her own blood.”</p><p>“I don’t think that's the case, Severus.”</p><p>“I understand what you're trying to…” Severus stopped talking, his brows furrowed as he glared at something across the room.</p><p>“What, what is it?” Lucius asked and flowed Severus line of sight. “That's them, those are the students she was talking to.”</p><p>“Along with the first years, we have three new seventh year. Mr. Neville Pendragon along with his cousins Harrison Le Fay and Luna Le Fay,” the Headmaster announced.</p><p>Lucius heard the terribly dressed Headmaster, but his focus was on something else or rather someone else. The beauty in front of him, took his very breath and thoughts away. Everyone knew the names Pendragon and Le Fay, they are associated with the name Merlin.  They were or still are in name only the richest and most influential wizard and witches to ever walk the face of the earth. Everyone thought the Pendragon and Le Fay bloodline had died out. Lucius guessed they were wrong.</p><p>“Mr. Pendragon, would you sit on the stool, please,” Professor McGonagall said.</p><p>“If I may, Madam would you allow my cousin, Luna to go first?” Pendragon asked.</p><p>“I see no problem with that, Mr.  Pendragon,” McGonagall said then turned to the young lady with the bright silver, black, and sprinkles of purple in her hair. “Miss. Le Fay.”</p><p>The young lady turned and looked at her two companions and smiled before walking over to the stool and sat down. The hat was placed on her head. Lucius looked away from her and turned his focus back to the dark and silver-haired beauty standing the center of the room. There was something about the boy that called to him. As if knowing that Lucius was thinking about him the boy turned and looked directly at him. The piercing jade jewels took his breath away. They stared at each other until the spell was broken by the yell of the hat.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>GRYFFINDOR!</strong>
</p><p>The beauty snapped his head around and looked at his sister Lucius could only assume giving her the strangest look was the only word he could think of. As always, the Gryffindor table cheered as the young lady rose from the stool. Then walked over to Lucius’ new obsession and whispered some in his ear before taking her seat at the Gryffindor table. Next was Pendragon it seemed that his beauty would be the last to be sorted. The sorting of Pendragon was much faster than it was for the Le Fay girl.</p><p align="center"><strong>RAVENCLAW</strong>!</p><p>The Ravenclaw’s cheered. Pendragon stood then nodding to Le Fay before taking his seat at the table with his new classmates. The entire Great Hall was quite as Le Fay walked over and sat on the stool the hat was placed on his head, and everyone waited to see what will happen next. Lucius was intrigued by the three new students, especially, the jade eyed jewel. Le Fay’s sorting took as long as his sister maybe a bit longer.  The Headmaster seemed a bit impatient and was about to speak when the hat yelled…</p><p align="center">
  <strong>SLYTHERIN!</strong>
</p><p>The entire Slytherin table erupted in cheers save for Lucius, who was too entranced. And Severus, who seemed perturbed by the newcomer. Lucius watched as Fay looked at the Gryffindor table and nodded to his sister who gave him a thumbs up, and then at the Ravenclaw at his cousin who winked and smiled at him. The whole thing had Lucius wondering who were the three new students. He watched as the jade eyed beauty walked over to the Slytherin table and sat at the far end, with the new first years. Not like his sister and cousin who was sitting closer to the seventh years at their table. The boy truly intrigued him, and he couldn’t but watch him for the remainder of the meal. Soon the meal was over, and it was time to adjourn to their dorms. Lucius turned his focus to getting the students to the dorm. He'd lost sight of Le Fay, he wanted to use the excuse of them walking to the dorms to speak to the boy.</p><p>“Severus, did you see where Le Fay ran off to?”</p><p>“No,” Severus snapped. Lucius could tell that his friend would not welcome the new Slytherin with open arms.</p><p>Lucius shook his head. <em>Things were already starting out poorly. Let's hope it doesn't continue.</em></p><p>TBC!!!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
