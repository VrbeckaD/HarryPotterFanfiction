    <p>Harry yawned and he stretched his arms and legs, getting comfy on the bench of the train compartment. He looked at the watch on his wrist, seeing that it was 10am. The train wouldn't be leaving for another hour. He grumbled in annoyance at Uncle Vernon's penchant for screwing him over. Reaching into his small travel bag, he pulled out a book at random, deciding that he might as well make use of the quiet.</p><p> </p><p>He looked at the cover of the book he'd picked out, seeing that it was one on Ancient Runes. He smiled to himself, as the book reminded him of his favourite professor, and first friend, Bathsheda Babbling.</p><p> </p><p>----------(brief overview of past few years, alot has changed)----------</p><p> </p><p>Harry could remember the first time he'd ever met Bathsheda. She'd turned up on the Dursley's doorstep on his 5th birthday. Now knowing what she's like, he doesn't know how she managed to stop herself from pulling out her wand and killing the Dursleys where they stood for their treatment of him. She'd taken him out for the day, first to the cinema, and then to a nice little restaurant for dinner.</p><p> </p><p>At the end of the day she'd taken him to her home, but when they arrived, they found a strange old man (who Harry would later find to be Albus Dumbledore) waiting for them on her doorstep. Bathsheda and Dumbledore had argued in hushed whisper for near an hour, before Dumbledore's face went stony, and lowering his voice even more, said something that pulled Bathsheda up short.</p><p> </p><p>After that, she had taken him back to the Dursley's, but promised that she would continue to come visit him, to make sure the Dursleys were treating him how they should.</p><p> </p><p>From then on, Bathsheda would visit him every couple weeks, taking him out to have fun, like going to watch films at the cinema, or going out to eat. This went on until his 10th birthday, when Bathsheda had came to see him along with another witch, who introduced herself as Minerva McGonagall. Together, they had told him about magic, about the wizarding world, and about Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, that he'd be allowed to attend, as he himself was a wizard.</p><p> </p><p>After that day, Bathsheda would take him to places throughout wizarding Britain, rather than to see the Muggle side. She wanted him to see the world he'd be soon entering, so he was ready.</p><p> </p><p>On his 11th birthday, Bathsheda had picked him up from the Dursleys along with a giant of a man called Hagrid, who worked at Hogwarts along with Bathsheda and McGonagall. Bathsheda had told him they were going to take him to get his school things, and Hagrid was accompanying them as he had something to do at Diagon Alley, which is where they would be going.</p><p> </p><p>While there, Bathsheda had bought him a beautiful snowy owl that he had named Hedwig. After their shopping, they had lunch in the Leaky Cauldron, where Bathsheda had gone on to explain some things. He knew from asking her when they first met, that she had known his mum, Lily, from when the two were at school together.</p><p> </p><p>She'd told him that the reason she didn't go to see him until his 5th birthday was because she hadn't known where he was. Apparently Dumbledore had placed him with the Dursleys just after his mother had died, but hadn't told anyone where he'd left him. Dumbledore had told her the day that she first went to see him that the reason he did this was to keep Harry safe. There were apparently strong spells placed on the house that would protect Harry from those that had killed his mother, and would likely wish to do the same to him.</p><p> </p><p>On the 1st of September, Bathsheda had taken Harry to King's Cross station, where he'd be getting the train to Hogwarts. After making sure he was alright on the train, she'd aparated away, as she needed to be at Hogwarts before all the students.</p><p> </p><p>While sitting on the train, waiting for it to leave, he'd met a a couple girls who had asked to sit with him, Susan Bones and Hannah Abbott. They'd talked for a long time until it was time for the train to leave. As it was pulling away, a boy called Ron Weasley had asked to join them, which they allowed.</p><p> </p><p>After getting to the school, and meeting three other girls on the boats across the lake, Hermione Granger, Daphne Greengrass, and Tracey Davis, the sorting began. Harry went to Gryffindor, as Bathsheda had told him that was where herself and Lily had been at school.</p><p> </p><p>On the first day, Harry met Professor Snape, teacher of potions class. After a short string of questions, Snape had awarded Harry 5 points, stating that he was as knowledgeable when it came to potions as his mother.</p><p> </p><p>On Halloween, Ron and Hermione had got into an argument, with Ron insulting Hermione so harshly that it caused her to hide in the girl's bathroom for the rest of the day. During the Halloween feast, Professor Quirrell had burst into the hall, raving about a troll being loose in the dungeons. Dumbledore had ordered all the students back to their houses while the teachers took down the troll.</p><p> </p><p>While he was heading up to the tower with the rest of the Gryffindors, Harry remembered about Hermione, realising she wouldn't know about the troll. Splitting away from the other Gryffs, Harry made his way to the bathroom that Hermione was said to have been in. Before he got there however, he bumped into a bunch of Hufflepuffs, who were being lead by Professor Sprout and Bathsheda. After telling them what had happened, Bathsheda called on a few 7th year Hufflepuffs to come with her, telling Harry to lead them to where Hermione was.</p><p> </p><p>By the time they got to the bathroom, the troll had already beaten them there. It had smashed a hole in the wall and was trying to grab at Hermione. Bathsheda and the five 7th years surrounded the troll, firing a multitude of spells at it. While they had it's attention, Bathsheda nodded to one of the students, a girl with bright pink hair, and told her to get Hermione out of the way. Running into the smashed bathroom, the girl and Harry took Hermione by the arms and pulled her out of harms way.</p><p> </p><p>Before they reached the end of the corridor, they heard the troll let out a huge roar. Turning to look, they saw just in time as the troll swung it's club like a pendulum clock, hitting one of the Puffs, sending him flying into another student. Kicking out with it's right foot, it caught another, sending the boy spinning into the stone wall. It raised it's club, about to bring it down on Bathsheda, but before it could, a flurry of spells flew over Harry, Hermione and the Puff girl's heads, hitting the troll.</p><p> </p><p>Within moments the troll was stunned, chained, and it's right arm was laying several metres away from the rest of the body. Looking behind them, the three students saw Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Flitwick all stood there with their wands out. After the whole ordeal was over, they found that the student that had been hit with the club had dozens of broken bones, the student that he had hit had a broken arm and a concussion, and the boy that was kicked into the wall had several broken bones and a shattered skull, only being saved by the quick and extraordinary work of Madam Pomfrey.</p><p> </p><p>While resting in the hospital wing, Harry introduced himself to the pink haired girl, who introduced herself in kind as Nymphadora (don't call her that to her face) Tonks. The two became fast friends, and when Hermione recovered from the shock and horror of the series of events, she joined them, becoming (in Harry's opinion) his first proper friend, Bathsheda being a teacher meant Harry couldn't be friends with her like they both wished, and Ron's actions earlier in the day began to make Harry reconsider their friendship altogether.</p><p> </p><p>During Christmas Harry stayed at the castle, playing games with the Weasleys and talking and playing games with Bathsheda when she wasn't planning lessons for the next term. On Boxing day night, Harry got bored with listening to Ron going on about what presents he had and hadn't gotten, so he decided to go for a walk. After exploring alot of the surrounded floors and corridors, Harry came to a locked door. Using the alohomora spell on the lock, the door swung wide open. Stepping into the room, Harry found that there was nothing in it but a large mirror, that had strange writing across the top and bottom.</p><p> </p><p>After staring at the mirror for several moments, the glass began to shimmer. Where before it had just shown Harry's reflection, now it showed Harry and several other people, stood around him. On his reflections left stood Bathsheda, her blonde hair sparkling like moonlight. On his right stood his mum, Lily, he recognised her from several photos Bathsheda had shown him.</p><p> </p><p>Stood around them were several girls and women. He recognised Hermione and Tonks straight away, but then started to recognise others. Susan and Hannah, Daphne and Tracey. But also several others. A girl who looked a few years older than him stood with a girl who looked a few years younger, their hair a silvery gold in colour, and their faces more beautiful that any others. A small girl stood next to Daphne, with straw blonde hair and a cute face. Another girl with jaw length blonde hair and large eyes stood of to the side on her own. But there were also loads more spread out behind them all, he couldn't make out their faces, them seeming blurred.</p><p> </p><p>A couple weeks before the end of the school year, an explosion shook the school. All the students were evacuated to the front lawn of the castle, as the teachers surrounded the front door, their wands at the ready. Smoke billowed out of the doors as a figure stepped out. Harry didn't recognise the person at first, as he wasn't wearing his usual large turban. As Professor Quirrell walked down the stone steps, Dumbledore shouted something to him, but without replying, a grin spread across Quirrell's face. His lower body turned to smoke, and he flew faster than anyone could keep up with, as he crashed into the assembled students. </p><p> </p><p>Grabbing onto Harry's robes, Quirrell flew upwards, pulling Harry with him. He flew to the top of the astronomy tower, dropping Harry onto the wooden boards, before pacing back and forth, muttering something to himself. Harry couldn't completely make out his face as he had his hood pulled up, but what he could see of it made him cower away from the man, as he looked as if he was about to completely lose it.</p><p> </p><p>Quirrell suddenly spun, facing Harry, he opened his mouth to say something, but before he could, several figures burst up the stairs. Bathsheda and Snape were in the lead, their wands drawn, behind them was Tonks, McGonagall, and Flitwick. The small group surrounded Quirrell, taking the advantage of a shocked Quirrell, the begun firing off spells and curses. The man tried holding them back, but even though he seemed inhumanly fast and skilled, he couldn't take them all. As they pushed him toward the edge of the tower, Harry whipped out his own wand, pointed it at Quirrell, and shouted out a banishing spell that Tonks had taught him.</p><p> </p><p>It hit Quirrell squarely in the chest, sending him crashing through the guard rails, and careening toward the ground.</p><p> </p><p>----------(Back to present)----------</p><p> </p><p>Harry shook his head, trying to get rid of the memory of Quirrell's startled face as he shot backwards away from him. Looking out the window, he noticed as large crowds had begun to form on the platform as people arrived. Peering down at his watch, he saw that it read 10:30, only half an hour till the train leaves. Harry sighed contentedly, glad to soon be heading back to his true home, with his true family. </p>
