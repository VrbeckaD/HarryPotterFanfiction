    <p>“My mum said you can spend the summer holiday with us, if you’d like,” I said to Sirius after Peter and James had gone in search of the trolley, leaving us alone.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it a bit short notice, Moony?” He asked me, one eyebrow cocked. “I mean, we are quite literally on our way back home now.”</p>
<p>“Listen, I haven’t gotten to be alone with you in a while, that’s all,” I said, watching as Sirius’ eyes grew larger by the second. “I mean, I haven’t had a chance to ask you in private, without prying ears, is all. I know you turned down James’ invitation, but--” Sirius cut me off.</p>
<p>“Moony, I’d love to shack up with you for days and days and days, but I’m no charity case and refuse to be treated as such.” I felt a light blush tinge my cheeks… He’d love to. </p>
<p>Just then, James and Peter returned, arms full of sugary loot. James stood observantly in the doorway as Peter reclaimed his seat and began unwrapping his treasure in a greedy manner. While Peter scarfed down chocolate frog after chocolate frog, Sirius has yet to break eye contact. James was the first to interrupt the silence. </p>
<p>“Well, Peter and I were gone for less than five minutes and somehow you two found a way to dampen the mood.”</p>
<p>“James, what are you talking about?” As I smelled Peter’s chocolate, my stomach rumbled.</p>
<p>“What I’m talking about, Moony, is the fact that I could cut the tension in here with a knife. What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” grumbled Sirius, as he reached for a piece of chocolate to give to me. I unwrapped it very carefully. Sirius smirked at my want for cleanliness. Melted chocolate is no joke. I ate it quickly because I could feel Sirius’ eyes boring into my skull and it makes me self conscious to eat in front of people who aren’t also eating. Sirius sighed, his eyes still on me as he licked his thumb, and bringing it to the corner of my mouth he swiped in a half circle motion. As his calloused, saliva covered thumb barely grazed my bottom lip, I felt my eyes flutter closed. Melting into his touch, it took everything in me not to moan. James cleared his throat and my eyes flew open. </p>
<p>“You uh, had some chocolate on your face,” Sirius told me, rubbing the back of his neck in a way that was meant to be insecure but to me, was everything.</p>
<p>“Oh, right. Thanks,” I said, my face a deeper shade of red than should be humanly possible. </p>
<p>“Don’t mention it,” he said as James sat in between the two of us.</p>
<p>“Rem, I’ve been doing some thinking and the next cycle is a few weeks out. I’ll come be with you if you want the company,” James offered.</p>
<p>“No.” Sirius said suddenly. Peter looked up from his snacks at Sirius' possessive tone of voice. </p>
<p>“Sorry, what?” James asked his best friend.</p>
<p>“I mean, you can’t on your own, Prongs. We all know the wolf likes Padfoot the best, anyhow.”</p>
<p>“What’re you getting at, Black?” James asked.</p>
<p>“I just think, I mean logically, I should be the one to assist.”</p>
<p>“Can’t we both?”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, but you have your internship with the Ministry, and what’ll they think if you show up and you’re covered in scratches and bruises?” Sirius said. </p>
<p>“Hold on, does this mean you’re on board?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah, alright, I’ll be your nurse for the summer, Lupin. I expect only the finest of bedroom floors to sleep on," Sirius winked.</p>
<p>“Deal.” My heartbeat became faster by the second as the thought of spending the whole summer with Sirius Black took root in my mind.</p>
