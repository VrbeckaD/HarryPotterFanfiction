    <p> </p><p>The lovers met by moonlight<br/> The first [woman] was crimson,<br/> the second ran wet her [myrrh?]<br/> The river ran over and the sun rose up<br/> And the day found them [bound]<br/> in earth and [blood] and love.</p><p>- K. Olayinke, The River, 13.200-205.</p><p> </p><p align="justify">I cannot possibly overstate the oversimplification of the term <em>soulmates</em>. In fact, in nearly every single mytho-historic instance we could point to -- Layla and Majnun, Rhiannon and Pwyll, even Makeda and Solomon -- there are strong suggestions that at least one of the lovers was enthralled...The difficulty of interpreting a historically amorphous concept like consent means that we simply don't know if the more magically powerful partner was even aware of mentally and emotionally subduing their lover(s).</p><p align="left">- Y.

It was as if a part of my soul left with him.</p><p align="left">- A. Dumbledore, private journals</p><p align="center"><br/> I.</p><p align="justify">It was pure chance that Blaise happened to be there. If his meeting with Veraglindis hadn't run over, he would've been halfway cross the world when Harry Potter showed up. It was the rare meeting with VG that did not run over, of course: this one was hardly an exception.</p><p align="justify">So it was that he was leaning against the front desk and waiting for his wand back from Zuile when a soft cough pulled his attention.</p><p align="justify">Blaise looked up, and there he was. Harry Potter - shorter than memory supplied.</p><p align="justify">Blaise's heart swooped - and then plummeted.</p><p align="justify">'Er,' said Harry Potter, scratching the back of his neck. 'Hullo, there. I'm here for, um. A 2 o'clock appointment?' It was now nearing 5 o'clock. 'I know I'm a bit...late.'</p><p align="justify">A bit late! Blaise blinked at him. 'Hm. Do you know who it is you're meant to see?' he said, when he had finally recovered his mental faculties.</p><p align="justify">Potter took out a crumpled bit of parchment and scowled down at it. Bit of a grim-faced fellow. 'Er...Marah-Sellee? M--Maura-Sali?'</p><p align="justify">Ah, Maraceli, he meant. 'I think there must have been some confusion,' said Blaise, hesitantly. 'Maraceli doesn't work on Thursdays. Are you quite sure it's for today?'</p><p align="justify">'Yes. Oh. Well.' Potter grimaced down at the parchment some more. 'Maybe not, actually. I think this might say...does that look like a 7 or an 8 to you?'</p><p align="justify">Blaise took the parchment in his hand and gave it a thorough once-over. 'It doesn't look like any living human language,' he concluded, handing it back. Perhaps Akkadian? 'Did your secretary write that? You might need a new one.'</p><p align="justify">'<em>I</em> wrote it,' said Potter, frowning.</p><p align="justify">'Oh, well, good news for your secretary, then,' he said, smiling cajolingly. Potter did not laugh. Ah, well. 'Anyway, I can, ah. I can take down your information now? And we can send you new appointment details.'</p><p align="justify">Potter hesitated. 'Er, well. Do you actually work here?'</p><p align="justify">It was then that Blaise realised that Harry Potter had no idea who he was. Had no idea that he was the owner of the Magic Physiotherapy Centre in which they were currently stood; probably did not even remember that they'd been to school together. Had just walked up to him and demanded information because he was standing there. And had <em>looked</em> helpful.</p><p align="justify">Well. Blaise was hardly going to introduce himself and embarrass them both. 'Perfectly understandable, sir. I'm an alternate therapist,' he said smoothly. 'I usually come in on the weekends. Or when there's overflow.'</p><p align="justify">It was, he thought with only a little guilt, certainly true on paper, if not in spirit.</p><p align="justify">Potter broke out in a brilliant smile. Blaise politely looked away. 'Oh, well, that's great, then! Can't you just--you know, do the--the stuff?' The <em>stuff</em>? 'Er, the therapeutic--stuff?' He coughed. 'Only, I've got to get my leg looked at before Sunday or Kings'll have my head.'</p><p align="justify">Kings? Short for Kingsley Shacklebolt, no doubt. Was Potter threatening him? He hardly seemed the type. Best to find out precisely what type he was, then.</p><p align="justify">'I don't know if that will be possible,' said Blaise, testing him. 'We are closing soon...'</p><p align="justify">'Please, could we do it just this one time?' said Potter, coming closer. 'I would really appreciate it.'</p><p align="justify">As a threat, Blaise thought sourly, it was shockingly ineffective. And where on earth had Zuile gone off to?</p><p align="justify">'Oh all right,' he said, sighing, leaning over the desk to look for a quillboard. He felt the burst of satisfaction from Potter like the sun on his skin. Merlin. It was enough to make the hair on his arms stand up. 'I'll do this first session, then we'll get you down for a proper introductory session with Maraceli next week.'</p><p align="justify">'Yes, yes, absolutely,' said Potter, directly behind him. 'Now where do you want me?'</p><p align="justify">Blaise turned around and took a quick step back. 'Fill this out first,' he said, holding out the quillboard between them. 'Then go down to the locker room down the hall on your left. You can leave your wand in one of the cubbies there. It will be returned to you at the end of your session.'</p><p align="justify">Potter, nicknamed Ickle Killer by certain unsavoury news outlets, clearly struggled with this last part. 'Is that really necessary? I'd be much more comfortable with my wand on me.'</p><p align="justify">Blaise smiled genuinely. 'Fortunately this isn't about your comfort,' he said, 'but your <em>growth</em>. You can follow the signs to Room 5 when you're done changing.'</p><p align="justify">Potter scowled.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">'You grew up with Muggles, didn't you?' said Blaise, while they were stretching. Well. While <em>he</em> was stretching. Potter was, on his side of the room, breathing hard and poorly bending. His brown cheeks were deep and red, so he looked well and truly angry when he glared up at Blaise. Celi was certainly going to have her work cut out for her.</p><p align="justify">'Yea? Why's that relevant?' said Potter, rather aggressively. Oh. Right.</p><p align="justify">'I'm working my way up to a metaphor,' said Blaise languidly, pulling his leg back. 'It works better if you understand Muggle mechanics.'</p><p align="justify">Potter perked up at that - then nearly kicked Blaise in the face. 'Oh! er. Sorry.'</p><p align="justify">'It's fine,' said Blaise, still sweating from Potter's little mini-strop. This was shaping up to be the longest 45 minutes in human history. 'So we tend to think of the Muggle bike as the perfect unit.'</p><p align="justify">'--Do we now,' said Potter.</p><p align="justify">'We certainly do,' said Blaise, trying not to smile at the wave of amusement he felt enter the room. It was just that Potter felt everything so <em>strongly</em>. 'At least the people in my field tend to do so.' He did not mention that his field consisted of about ten people, all of whom he had personally spread the gospel truth of The Muggle Bike metaphor to.</p><p align="justify">'And, ergh--why is, why is that?' asked Potter, toppling over.</p><p align="justify">'All of its elements working in perfect harmony for one purpose: <em>movement</em>,' said Blaise. The spiel was easy to fall into. It was almost enough to make him forget Potter's core steaming hot air like a leaky dragon.</p><p align="justify">'I see,' said Potter, standing to his feet. 'One part stops working, the whole thing fails, right?'</p><p align="justify">'Oh, not at all,' said Blaise, blinking up at him, trying to breathe in more deeply. For a moment he lost his train of thought and just fell to staring. Potter quirked his eyebrows.</p><p align="justify">How mortifying. Blaise quickly found something else to look at. 'You can still technically ride a bike with bad tires, for example - you just need to take more patience or care, if you do. Otherwise you could put yourself in a lot of danger.</p><p align="justify">'We understand that you don't always replace bad tires on time - sometimes you don't know how, or you don't think it's possible, or you just don't want to. Sometimes the tires have sentimental value, sometimes replacing them is just too expensive. There's a bunch of reasons they could get worn out.</p><p align="justify">'And we don't blame the tires for wearing out, we know that's just an effect of their function. But you and I need to understand what it looks like when you are worn out. Otherwise you'll just be at a standstill and you won't know why you're not moving.'</p><p align="justify">'Um. You're very... passionate about this,' Potter observed. 'I really thought this was just about my leg? Like, I can't always feel it, but I don't think it's bad, really.' Blaise did not immediately reply. 'To be honest, I thought we'd be doing less stretching and more. like. Massaging.' And he stared beseechingly. Saints <em>above</em>.</p><p align="justify">'I think I'll leave any massaging to your actual therapist,' Blaise said, carefully. 'This session is just so you can tell your boss you went, yes? So why don't you consider this a seminar on the theory behind what magical physiotherapists do.'</p><p align="justify">'Oh, my favourite kind,' said Potter. A joke, perhaps.</p><p align="justify">'We can stretch in silence,' said Blaise, exhaling slowly, disappointed somehow, 'if you prefer.' It was entirely unreasonable, he knew, to expect Potter to be anywhere as interested in Blaise as he was in him.</p><p align="justify">'No,' said Potter. 'That's fine.'</p><p align="justify">They finished stretching in silence anyway.</p><p align="justify">'Er, what was that you were saying about the bike? Earlier?' said Potter, breathing hard. 'It was very, ahm. Very interesting.'</p><p align="justify">'I'm sure you found it fascinating,' Blaise said, smiling warmly. Potter stared at him with tilted head, clearly trying to figure out if he was being sarcastic. Greater minds than his had tried. 'But now we're going to go ahead and do a few visualisation techniques. Here, sit down across from me - yes, there's fine, copy my posture. No, curve your back more. That's it. Relax your shoulders. Here, like this. Breathe in - hold that posture, hold that posture, hold that posture - and breathe out. Good. Very good. Close your eyes. How do you feel?'</p><p align="justify">Potter's eyes flickered once, twice beneath his eyelids. 'Like... like I'm on the cusp of a breakthrough,' he said breathlessly. And he raised one eye open to show that he was joking.</p><p align="justify">Blaise did not roll his eyes even after Potter had closed his again because he was a professional, and also because patients could always tell when you thought they were being annoying unless you were very, very careful.</p><p align="justify">'And besides that?' he pressed. 'Since your injury, for example, have you noticed a decrease in your sense of taste, smell or sound?'</p><p align="justify">'Er, no,' Potter hedged. He coughed. 'I'm actually fine. Just a bit tired? It's just the feeling goes in and out of my leg from time to time.' He swallowed. 'I'm also, ah. Sorry about peeving you off. I did like your speech earlier. You got really excited.'</p><p align="justify">'Never mind that,' said Blaise. 'If something isn't working for you, you should say so. That's entirely the purpose of your being here.' Yet somehow that made Potter frown. Ah, well. No pleasing some Saviours, was there. Blaise closed his eyes, too, if only so he could stop being so distracted.</p><p align="justify">'Onto these visualisation techniques, then,' he said briskly. 'They're meant to help you increase your awareness of your surroundings, and of your own energy output. We tend to visualise magical output as thermal energy, because strong outbursts usually register as some kind of heat to our immediate senses.</p><p align="justify">'Often people are unaware of how much energy they give off, especially when they've been hurt, so these techniques will help you better identify what it looks like and feels like when you're on the cusp of an outburst. Now do you know where you are?'</p><p align="justify">'I'm,' said Potter, sounding confused, 'in a room? In a room... with you.'</p><p align="justify">'Yes, that's correct! Now I want you to try to push out with your magic and map out the room.' Potter closed his eyes and scrunched up his face, more curious than concentrating. Around them, the whole building made a low groaning sound, as if it were being squeezed in some kind of vice. Blaise calmed his heart and reached for Potter's hand. Potter startled, his eyes flashing open briefly, beautifully - and then he opened his hand to Blaise's and held on.</p><p align="justify">Potter's hand was quite-- warm.</p><p align="justify">'Steady on,' Blaise said gently. 'We don't want to knock the walls down, do we? No, we just want to see them. Can you see them?'</p><p align="justify">'I see them,' said Potter. 'They're...walls.' He paused. 'Is there another room on the other side of this one?'</p><p align="justify">Ah. He meant the observation room. He wasn't supposed to be able to sense that. 'Yes, very good,' Blaise praised. 'That's the observation room.'</p><p align="justify">Potter's hand tightened its grip. His ring was probably going to leave an indent. 'Is someone watching?' he asked. 'I don't remember being asked if we could be observed.'</p><p align="justify">'No, no one's watching,' said Blaise. 'Reach out and check for yourself.' He felt a coldness in the room as Potter pushed all of himself towards and through the south wall. Blaise fought down a shiver.</p><p align="justify">'All right. There's no one there,' said Potter, still tightly gripping Blaise's hand. 'You know, I don't think it's right to have that room and not tell people.'</p><p align="justify">'We did tell you in the paperwork you signed,' Blaise reminded him. 'And it's nothing untoward, you know. Observation is really the only way we can help each other improve.' He felt more than saw Potter's flat displeasure at this. 'All right. You'll be notified ahead of time if any of your sessions are going to be observed. Is that all right?'</p><p align="justify">'Yea,' said Potter, now bent to the task of further investigating the room. 'That's fine.' He paused. 'You know, this room feels good. Like--happy. I don't know.'</p><p align="justify">Blaise struggled to keep his voice and face neutral. 'That is very gratifying to hear,' he said carefully. 'We have tried very hard to make this a positive space.'</p><p align="justify">As he was speaking, something lapped at the tips of his fingers, the sides of his neck. 'Oh,' said Potter softly. 'Is that--is that you?'</p><p align="justify">Blaise smiled. 'Yes, that's me.' He couldn't help but laugh at the quickening onslaught of Potter's magic. It felt like being jumped all over by a very warm, very curious wave. He startled a little as the feeling ran up his legs and suffused his limbs. Extremely curious, then.</p><p align="justify">When the wave met against the walls surrounding his core, he patted Potter's hand softly with his other hand. 'Yes, well done. Now what you want to do is replicate this, only now--'</p><p align="justify">The wave swallowed him whole. He was in sun. He was in silence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He was asleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He woke to fingers stroking his hair. He found his tongue sticking to the top of his mouth, dry. Blearily, he opened his eyes. It must have gone hours. The room was dark, and his head was in Potter's lap.</p><p align="justify">'--I take it that doesn't happen normally?' said Potter, very softly.</p><p align="justify">It felt like every single cell in Blaise's body was tingling: the waking of a dead limb. 'No,' he croaked. He swallowed hard. 'No, that doesn't normally happen.' He let his eyes fall closed. 'You're not-- ujh-- you have. Train. S'dange. You cou'h hrhh.' He licked his lips uselessly, tried to think. 'You could hurt someone.'</p><p align="justify">Potter was still but for the moving of his hand. 'Did I hurt you?'</p><p align="justify">Blaise tried to sit up and tilted sideways, trembling hard. Potter caught him in his arms and held him fast. It seemed suddenly he could smell not only all of Potter, but everyone who had been in this room recently.</p><p align="justify">'I'd'hh know,' Blaise replied, buried in the warmth of Potter's neck - and he was gasping suddenly, alive, awake now, more awake than he had been in years. 'What did you do?'</p><p align="justify">'I don't <em>know</em>,' said Potter, still holding Blaise close, two hands at his back, and then another, warm at his belly, calming him and grounding him. No, he realised, not a hand; it was something else. Like warm thick water, like melting honey, ah--</p><p align="justify">his senses tumbled away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p> </p>
