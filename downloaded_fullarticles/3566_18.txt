    <p>Just a bit of background. Harry is book harry, which means sarcastic. Everyone is used to it. And I made him a bit more smart in the fic, he knows more than Normal Harry would. Snape is also a little different, he doesn't hate Harry as much as many fanfics make him out to be, he really doesn't even hate him in this story, more like annoyed. And it is set in third year :) Enjoy!</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Harry groans as his body hits his feather bed. Entirely too exhausted to even think about taking off his quidditch robes, not to mention sneaking in to the showers once everyone falls asleep. He turns his head as someone opens the door to the dormitory. He sees a mess of red hair who could only be Ron.</p><p>“Hey Mate! How was practice?” Ron questions with too much enthusiasm for Harry, who can barely keep his eyes open despite it only being eight o'clock. </p><p>“So fucking tired.” Harry mumbled into his blankets, only having one thing on his mind: sleep.</p><p>“Well, why don’t you catch a few hours and then we can go down to the common room and study for the potions test.” This makes Harry raise his head with confusion written all over his face. </p><p>“You know, the one we have tomorrow? We promised Hermione we would study with her tonight.” Harry let out a groan that echoed through the room. Ron lets out a laugh, not understanding the sheer exhaustion Harry was feeling. </p><p>“Honestly mate, catch an hour of sleep and then I'll wake you up,” Ron comes up to Harry and slaps him on the shoulder before pausing, “on second thought, maybe you should shower first. You reek.” He laughs again and moves toward his bed, grabbing a Chudley Cannons magazine and flopping down on his red and gold sheets.</p><p>Harry groans again and rolls over and off his bed, making his way toward the boys showers. Luck was finally on Harry's side, the showers were deserted. Harry goes back to the room and grabs his clothes, no need for anyone to get a glimpse of his bare, mutilated skin. He locks the shower doors and turns on the water. The steady stream of warm water on Harry's back stings but feels nice enough to keep letting it hit his wounds. He makes quick work of washing his hair and body before turning off the water and getting dressed again, he doesn't want any of the boys to question why the door was locked. He feels a bit refreshed and goes to one of the mirrors in the bathroom to see if he looked any better. The water may have woken him up a bit but he still looked like he’s a few feet away from death's door. The dark bags under his eyes are a sharp contrast to his pale face, making him look almost as bad as Snape. Harry runs his fingers through his hair in replacement of a brush before walking back to the dormitory. Ron is waiting for him with his potions textbook in his arms, along with parchment and a quill. </p><p>“Ready?” The redhead asks.</p><p>“No way was that an hour.” Harry accuses.</p><p>“You’re right, but the quicker we finish listening to Hermione tell us we need to pay more attention in class, the sooner we can go to sleep.” Harry shrugs his shoulder, knowing that Ron is right.</p><p>“Alright then, let's go.” Harry walks over and grabs his own supplies, following Ron down to the common room. Hermione is already writing down notes with three textbooks open in front of her. She raises her head and her face lights up as she sees them. </p><p>“Oh good! I was wondering when you two would show up!” She smiles and the boys sit down next to her. Harry opens his own textbook and tries to concentrate on why certain ingredients have to be crushed to a powder instead of diced, but he can already feel his eyes becoming heavier. </p><p>His eyes close for what feels like only a second but his body jerks awake when Hermione taps him. He looks at her and sees her glare.</p><p>“Honestly Harry! This is the first exam of the year, you have to at least try to get a decent grade.” She exclaims. </p><p>“Sorry Mione, I’m just tired. I think Wood might be trying to kill me with the way he is having us practice.” Harry gives his same lame excuse. Hermione's face softens a bit when she sees how glassy her friends eyes are. </p><p>“Harry just go to sleep, if you’re that tired I dont think staring at your textbook is going to help.” Harry couldn't agree more, he knew any information he read he wouldn't retain, not when all he could think about was how it felt like a hammer was hitting him in the head every second. He nodded his head and grabbed his stuff again, heading back to his room. </p><p>“Goodnight Harry.” She said.</p><p>“G’night” Harry mumbled, stumbling his way up the stairs. </p><p>He barely remembers his head hitting the pillow.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Please comment!</p>
