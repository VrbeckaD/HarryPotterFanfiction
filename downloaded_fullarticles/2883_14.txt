    <p>Prologue</p><p> </p><p>7 November 1980.</p><p> </p><p>In a small dark room off the main street of magical Paris a mirror beeped. A man who had been writing at the table it was lying on sneered as he picked it up.</p><p>“I thought I told you not to contact me until you’d completed the task,” he snapped in German.</p><p>“And so I have,” the woman in the mirror replied in the same language. “Are you free to talk, Amadeus?”</p><p>Amadeus’s eyes lit up. “Heinrich von Lothringen is dead?”</p><p>“Poisoned in his own home,” the woman returned with a smile. “Which I never set foot into, of course.”</p><p>“Excellent,” Amadeus praised her. “This is it then. House Lothringen is done for.”</p><p>“There’s still the girl,” the woman cautioned. “And the Emperor himself.”</p><p>“What girl?” Amadeus demanded sharply. “I know of no girl.”</p><p>“Anna-Theresia von Lothringen,” the woman explained. “Heinrich’s daughter. She’d be next in line for the throne. Well, whoever marries her will be.”</p><p>There was a pause. Finally Amadeus said: “He won’t bear the name von Lothringen, but still it leaves my revenge incomplete. How old is the girl?”</p><p>“Merely a baby. She celebrated her first birthday sometime last month.”</p><p>“Not much older than my grandson then,” Amadeus said. “But no, I will not let her live on such a tenuous chance at the throne. The girl must die.”</p><p>“She will be well guarded after her father’s assassination,” the woman pointed out.</p><p>“Indeed, but there’s time. It will be years before she can get married or produce another heir. She will have to come out of hiding sometime. She has to be educated, after all. Then she’ll walk right into our hands.”</p><p>“You want us to strike at the school?” The woman gasped.</p><p>“It will be our last strike,” Amadeus said. “And the easiest.”</p>
