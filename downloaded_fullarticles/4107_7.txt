    <p>His mind was troubled by the emptiness that was now his heart. No chance to save himself harry walked down broken cobbled streets of dimly lit London. He ran a hand though his hair the inky black strands combing through his fingers. He let out a sigh he's warm breath visible in the cold English air. Emerald green eyes searching the night for something more, for he doesn't know that in the darkness is where he will meet his very own hero the one to protect him from the world. </p>
<p>The tired teen finally found the leaky cauldron again after his long walk. Slipping into the pub and making his way up to his room. Sitting on his bed with his face in his palms. Getting up and quickly changing before removing his glasses and falling into his dreams. Unlike his normal nightmares tonight he was plaged by images of pale skin contrasted by black symbols of tall protective figures and strong arms wrapped around him with the sense of peace home and warmth. Harry longed for this feeling. When he awoke he felt weird that he was dreaming of that kind of relationship at 14 if he expressed his desires he would be shunned but it felt right.</p>
<p>He saw the time and began to gather his things wondering how long it would take to get to kings Cross station you wouldn't want to be late for hogwarts Express Not that had anyone to meet them there. People were saying  that something big was happening this year that it was allways dangerous but It was the same every year whether it  was a new defence teacher trying  kill him or creatures or Monsters. He felt like this  years was better. So he walked downstairs to the floo and travelled to kings cross and boarded the train he was allways the first one there and got a compartment to him self locking the door. He sighed as family members began to enter the platform ready to send off the children to of another year at school. Harry wondered to himself what it would be like to be loved by family to have a happy mother and a protective father. As his fellow students began to board the train it filled with noise. </p>
<p>It was clear to anyone that saw Harry but he was The Boy Who Lived, but he wasn't what was  expected the small teen radiated Powerful magic he was smart but he was alone, people try to be friends with him but they wanted him for his fame or his wealth this did not come surprise for Harry who was content to be alone. Unlike what was expected harry was sorted into Slytherin he trusted the hats judgement. He was left alone in his house after he requested. This request was honoured by all but one. Draco Malfoy, after seeing harry use magic became obsessed and made it his mission to try and win harry. With that thought the blond in question appeared at the door knocking on it till it became annoying and harry pulled down the silencing spell. Now that draco could speak he told harry of the tri-wizard tournament and promptly left to not annoy harry.</p>
<p>Other schools coming to Hogwarts. His mind filled with the thoughts if the strong dark figure.</p>
<p>(Was gonna end it but it seems really short)</p>
<p>He blushed at the thoughts running round his head and couldn't suppress the sigh that left his mouth oh what he would give to meet the person in the shadows it was clear to him that his person was older than himself by a few years that they would be much more practiced. But that did not matter for as harry slipped into his dreams which this time were consumed by a new found lust.</p>
<p>When he awoke he found himself covered in a sheen of sweat and his crotch tight. He saw that they would be there soon so he quickly changed into his school robes not at nice as his own robes which were softer warmer and lighter on his frame. </p>
<p>As they left the train to journey to the castle harry calmly slipped through the crouds and to the carriages.<br/>He got the feeling of being watched so he turned around to see draco standing there harry just smirked and span into the crouded paths becoming invisible within the children that surrounded him draco peering over the top of the crouds in an attempt to see harry.</p>
<p>Later, in the hall draco found harry and tried to say something but as dumbledore began his speech.</p>
<p>"we are to have the honour of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months, an event that has not been held for over a century. It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year." The old fool said practically bouncing on the balls of his feet. "So with that information off you go to bed with you".</p>
<p>When, Draco turned harry was again gone able to escape the blonde's grasp.</p>
