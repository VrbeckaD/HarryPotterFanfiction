          <div class="userstuff"><p>“How many times must I tell you, Potter. Mind your own fucking business,” Malfoy snarled, looming over Harry. </p>
<p>Harry resisted rolling his eyes. Barely. “Maclean was about to hex you with your back turned. I can’t just --"</p>
<p>Malfoy interrupted by suddenly pressing one forearm into Harry’s chest, hard enough to expel all the air from his lungs. “Shut. Up. I refuse to hear another sanctimonious lecture from you.” Malfoy pressed even harder, with his whole body this time, flattening Harry against the cold stone of the alcove from head to toe, one arm trapped between their chests, constricting his breathing.</p>
<p>Tragically for Harry, hips also met hips, and the unwanted, unwarranted, surprise erection grinding up against Malfoy was a memory he surely will need Obliviated. He'd never felt so mortified. He'd also never felt so randy. What the fuck? </p>
<p>As if plucking that very question out of the air, Malfoy's countenance shifted to speculative as he considered Harry's flushed face and raspy breath. "Mm. I wonder," he murmured. Harry was so taken by the hooded eyes and darkening stare he didn't notice Malfoy's free hand moving until long fingers curled around the front of Harry's throat. He quirked an eyebrow at Harry -- a question. Harry somehow felt so close to the edge already; he couldn't find it within himself to say no. So he arched an eyebrow of his own -- a dare.</p>
<p>Malfoy’s grip tightened.</p>
<p>Sensation, both pleasure and pain, careened through Harry’s body like lightning, building up and up and up until he reached the crescendo. He came untouched, every part of him trembling. All of him felt...<em>alive</em>.</p>
<p>Moments or eons passed before Harry recovered enough to regard the man standing before him. Who was staring at him, dumbstruck.</p>
<p>“You came. Just from me...” Malfoy sounded breathless. Ironically.</p>
<p>"Er," Harry managed, horrified at how destroyed his voice sounded. "Thanks for that."</p>
<p>"…Anytime, Potter.”</p></div>
