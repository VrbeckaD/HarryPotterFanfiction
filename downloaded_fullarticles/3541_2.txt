    <p>‘Potter in Hogsmeade! We’ll see how the little twit will be able to get out of this one’ - Severus rounded a corner just in time to see the rule breaker himself lift up his head and pause like a deer caught in headlights, hands covered in dirt and looking worse for wear. ‘Got you now’ – Snape thought with a smirk.</p>
<p>‘My office, now’ – He ordered and Potter had no choice but to obey.</p>
<p>*<br/>
A short time later Potter was sitting in a chair in Snape’s office as the latter hovered over him: ‘Pray tell Mr Potter, how is it that Mr. Malfoy saw your head floating in Hogsmeade when it or any other parts of your body are not allowed there at all?’</p>
<p>‘Maybe Malfoy is hallucinating-’ – Potter stammered</p>
<p>‘Mr Malfoy does not suffer from hallucinations’ – Snape sneered, grabbing the handrails of the chair where the boy was sitting, blocking him in. Potter’s eyes widened and his body seemed to freeze. Snape’s eyes narrowed as a tantalizing scent hit his nose. What in the world?</p>
<p>Snape drew back: ‘Pull out your pockets’</p>
<p>Potter started panicking even more. The boy was hiding something after all.</p>
<p>Just as the boy began to take things out of his pockets, the floo flared to life and Lupin stepped out. What did the bloody werewolf want now? Came to save his best friends’ child from the clutches of the evil bat? Potter was not getting away this easily.</p>
<p>‘To what do I owe the pleasure?’ – Snape asked mockingly.</p>
<p>‘Sorry to bother you Severus, I was just wondering when the potion would be ready? I just started feeling out of sorts- oh Harry...’ – Lupin stopped mid-sentence, staring at the child.</p>
<p>Snape raised an eyebrow, how was it possible to miss Potter in his office? He glanced towards the boy, to see him scrunched up in the seat, knees brought up to his chest, and arms around them, his eyes peeking out underneath his shaggy hair, looking very round behind his spectacles. He was shaking. Without realizing what he was doing, Snape stepped closer to the boy, shielding him from the werewolf’s gaze. The scent hit him again; much stronger this time. Fuck.</p>
<p>‘Lupin, I suggest you leave now’ – Snape spoke in a deadly whisper, turning back to the man, but not moving away from the boy wonder.</p>
<p>The DADA professor seemed to have been stuck in place, nostrils flaring and eyes focused on the centre of Snape’s chest, his gaze trying to penetrate to the body behind the Potions Master.</p>
<p>‘Now!’ – Snape growled and Lupin’s head shot up, finally seeming to get back to himself and taking a step backwards into the floo to be whisked away somewhere else, hopefully very far from here.</p>
<p>Severus felt his robes being tugged and he whirled around, coming face to face with the now-standing Harry Potter, who was way too close for comfort.</p>
<p>‘Professor, what is happening to me?’ – The boy breathed, gazing up at Severus through blown out pupils.</p>
<p>‘You’re in heat’ – Snape managed to answer. Potter’s scent permeated through all of Snape’s defences and it terrified the man. No omega could ever make him aroused, and yet here he was, his cock filling out under his robes, because of Potter. Potter was an omega, who was drawing even closer, hands twisting in the Slytherin’s robes, trying to meld their bodies together.</p>
<p>Just then the door burst open and Weasley barged in shouting about sweets or something, Snape wasn’t paying attention as he grabbed Potter by the arm and marched him out of the room, ignoring the freckled boy whose face scrunched up in confusion as Potter’s scent hit his nose when they passed him by. Snape went straight to the infirmary, dumping Potter into a secluded room, designed for this kind of situations, and locking him inside.</p>
<p>‘Severus! What is the matter?’ – Madame Pomfrey appeared out of nowhere, waiting, as Snape rearranged his poker face back in place before facing her.</p>
<p>‘Potter is an omega and his heat has started when he was in my office.’ – Snape retorted and left the infirmary in a whirl of robes, before she had time to ask him anything else.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>He went straight to his rooms, and to his bottle of Firewhiskey. Fuck. He gulped down one tumbler. Fuck. The second and the third followed quickly after.</p>
<p>Severus Snape was known for never losing his control, never allowing his bodily urges to get the better of him. Then again, he never had bodily urges. Severus Snape was an alpha who never cared for any omegas. Their scent didn’t appeal to him. He fucked betas just to relieve stress. He never wanted anyone until now. Fuck.</p>
<p>He drank another shot and then threw the glass at the wall, watching it shatter. There was only one explanation for this. Harry Potter was his mate. He laughed out loud. James Potter must be rolling in his grave.</p>
<p>Any omega who presented in Hogwarts was always safe to be around the Potions Master. He was the only Alpha who could maintain his senses around him. Potter was definitely not safe around him. He was still half hard from before.</p>
<p>To get his mind out of the gutter and to stop lusting after a 13 year old boy - 13! For fucks sake – Snape decided to brew some extra potions for the omega, to relieve the omega’s ache. Potter must be suffering now, wanting a knot to fill him up, Severus’ knot… Stop. Not going there.</p>
<p>Poppy should have some potions anyway, she was always ready for these scenarios but he would brew some for the future. Thankfully his alcohol fuddled mind never stopped him from making perfect potions. However before he could go into his lab, his floo flared to life and he wanted to curse the universe. Who was it now?</p>
<p>Poppy stepped out, eyes fixing on Snape, her expression grim: ‘He is refusing to take the potions.’</p>
<p>Of course Potter would act like an imbecile and not listen.</p>
<p>‘Did you explain what they do?’ – Snape asked tiredly</p>
<p>Poppy’s cheeks blazed: ‘Obviously I did. Who do you take me for? He keeps asking for you.’</p>
<p>Did Potter feel the connection as well? Come to think of it, he wasn’t scared of Severus when his heat started, he was only scared of Lupin.</p>
<p>‘Well come on then, you will have to give him the potions’ – Poppy continued, crossing her arms.</p>
<p>She probably still thought that Snape wouldn’t do anything to the boy, knowing his spotless record with omegas.</p>
<p>Without waiting for his reply she grabbed his arm and dragged him to the floo. And just like that they were back in infirmary. The Snape of before would have been spluttering by now, about how dare she touch him, he could walk and floo just perfectly fine by himself, but the Snape of now did not care, because all he was thinking about is that he would see the boy in just a few moments.</p>
<p>Poppy handed him the vial which he took automatically and lead him to the room where he left Potter not so long ago. As she opened the door, Snape stepped in and was hit with the scent of omega in heat. Poppy just shut the door behind him, leaving the alpha and omega alone. No supervision, nothing. She trusted him too much.</p>
<p>Potter was huddled in the corner, but Severus saw the second his own scent hit the boy and the head whipped up, zeroing in on the Potions Master: ‘Professor’</p>
<p>It was barely a breath and Snape’s gut clenched: ‘You have to take the potion, it will make you feel better’</p>
<p>Potter shook his head, and climbed to his knees, beginning to crawl towards Severus.</p>
<p>‘Potter’ – Snape bit out when the boy was in front of him, just kneeling and gazing up with those lustful eyes.</p>
<p>‘Make me’ – He whispered and Severus snapped, he grabbed the boy’s chin lifting it up, and Potter moaned, his hands grasping at Snape’s robes and pulling him down. The force with which the boy pulled, made the man stumble and land on his knees as well, just a short breath away from the omega’s open mouth. Snape took hold of this opportunity and poured the vial down the boy’s throat, snapping his mouth closed with his hand.</p>
<p>‘Swallow it’ – He ordered and Potter whimpered but obeyed.</p>
<p>Relieved, Snape let go, which was a mistake because the boy lunged at him, tackling them both to the ground. Severus grunted when his back hit the floor, but his mind didn’t dwell on that for long because the boy’s lower half connected with his own and his cock filled to full hardness in a nanosecond. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.</p>
<p>‘Professor, please’ – Potter begged as he rocked against the Potions Master, his face buried in Severus’ chest. Each thrust was accompanied by a moan or a whimper. Snape’s hands were locked on the boy’s waist, afraid to pull him closer and not wanting to let go. So this is how it should feel like. This mindless pleasure, skyrocketing through the entire body, and they were still fully dressed.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long. After all Potter was 13 – Snape was going to kill himself later for molesting a 13 year old – and he came after just a couple of thrusts. Severus on the other hand was much older and yet, reached his completion at exactly the same time, coming in his pants like a school boy. Potter didn’t even weigh that much as his body succumbed to bliss and he fell asleep on top of the Potions Master.</p>
<p>Snape lifted him up and laid him on the bed, casting a cleaning charm on both of them and running his hand through the boy’s hair in a moment of weakness before turning away and leaving.</p>
<p>He let Poppy know that Potter drank the potion before making his way back to his rooms, and collapsing on top of the bed, falling asleep instantly.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The next evening after a gruelling set of classes found Snape in the headmaster’s office.</p>
<p>‘So it seems that Harry is an omega. I must say I didn’t see that coming. But no less, we can still continue as we were’ – Dumbledore spoke, while drinking his god awful sweet tea.<br/>
Snape didn’t say anything and continued to look out of the window. He wasn’t surprised that the Headmaster wasn’t too shocked.</p>
<p>‘Severus, don’t you want to tell me something?’</p>
<p>Snape looked back at that inquisitive gaze and doubled up his defences in his head, lest Dumbledore attempt to see what was on his mind and what happened in the past 48 hours.</p>
<p>‘No’ – He answered calmly</p>
<p>‘Harry has been asking for you’</p>
<p>Severus’ gut clenched, his omega needed him. Just Stop. Potter did not need him.</p>
<p>‘He is in heat, he just wants an Alpha’ – Severus’ voice remained smooth and impassive, even though inside his head he was picturing killing any alpha who dared lay a hand on his omega.</p>
<p>‘Hmmm, That’s what I thought at first too, however when he was presented with other Alphas, he did not seem interested, frightened more like.’</p>
<p>Snape’s eyes blazed and he didn’t notice as he jumped from his seat; ‘You let other Alphas near him!? He is 13!’</p>
<p>Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled, he got the reaction he wanted.</p>
<p>‘You know just as well as I do that age does not play a part in these situations. He is of age now. He just wants relief. Don’t you owe him at least that much Severus?’</p>
<p>Snape was enraged. How dare he? But of course the old bastard was right. Severus owed Potter everything. His parents died because of him. His Lily. If only she saw him now, lusting after her son. She would find it despicable.</p>
<p>Snape stormed out of the headmaster’s quarters, out of the castle and onto the grounds, trying to get some fresh air and clear his head. The boy was too young. It didn’t matter to him that when omegas’ heat started they were considered to be of age. When his heat ended Potter would hate Snape even more for touching him. The heat clouded the omegas’ senses; their consent was worth shit, when all they wanted was release. Then again he refused all other Alphas, which meant that he just wanted Severus. Why? The boy hated him, Snape made his life a living hell.</p>
<p>Snape came to a conclusion that the universe decided to royally fuck with him.</p>
<p>He didn’t know how long he strolled around the grounds, but the temperature started to drop and Snape found himself going back inside the castle. His feet took him to the infirmary and he paused for a moment in front of the double doors, rethinking his decision, and yet he pushed the door open and made his way to Poppy’s office. She was still awake, going over some files. She must have felt his presence as he made no sound.</p>
<p>‘Severus?’</p>
<p>‘I’m here to see Potter. Make sure no one disturbs us’</p>
<p>Whatever she heard in his tone of voice, must have satisfied her because she gave a small nod. She shouldn’t trust him so much. God only knew what he would do to the boy now after being away from him for so many hours.</p>
<p>When Snape walked into the room and shut the door behind him, he thought he was going to pass out. The scent was ten times stronger. He cast locking and silencing charms and watched as the body on the bed stirred to life. Potter was wearing a white shirt and pants, very clinical, very innocent and pure. Snape was definitely going to Hell.</p>
<p>The boy kneeled on the bed and looked at him: ‘You left’</p>
<p>‘Yes. Your hormones were controlling you and your consent wouldn’t have meant anything’ – Snape remained standing by the door, not wanting to take another step into the room, for the fear of his control snapping.</p>
<p>‘And now? What changed?’</p>
<p>‘I can’t let any other Alphas defile you’ – Clearly Snape’s mouth was ahead of his brain.</p>
<p>Potter gave a little smile: ‘So will you do that instead?’</p>
<p>Fuck it all to fucking hell. Severus stormed towards the boy who straightened his back when Snape descended on him. Their mouths collided, hands grabbing at each other’s clothing, pulling their bodies closer. Snape never thought kissing was that remarkable. Kissing Harry was something entirely different, it was mind blowing. Severus drew back, observing the boy’s face; his cheeks were flushed, lips parted and moist, eyes half lidded.</p>
<p>‘I am not going to fuck you’ – Severus breathed against that delectable mouth.</p>
<p>Before Harry could protest he continued: ‘But I will do everything to bring your body pleasure’</p>
<p>They looked at each other, the boy wanting to disagree with the first statement but also wanting the promise of the second.</p>
<p>‘Ok’</p>
<p>Snape pushed him back: ‘Lie down’</p>
<p>The boy did as he was told; if only he listened in the classroom. Severus stripped the omega before him, admiring the pale and wiry frame. Harry tried to cover himself, but the Potions Master drew his hands away: ‘You are beautiful’</p>
<p>That seemed to have worked as Harry’s fingers fell on Snape’s buttons: ‘I want to touch you’</p>
<p>Snape grabbed his wand and wordlessly cast a spell that opened all the buttons. Harry sighed and proceeded to take the older man’s robes off. Snape was just wearing black trousers under the robes, and the hitch in Harry’s breathing, let the Slytherin know that the boy liked what he saw.</p>
<p>As the omega was preoccupied with Severus’ body the man himself took hold of Harry’s hard length and stroked it. That got a reaction out of the boy as he arched under the touch. He continued to stroke before scooting down the bed and licking the head. Harry let out a scream, clearly a novice to this kind of stimulation. Severus only had to swallow the boy’s cock once when Harry came, shouting to the heavens. Snape lapped up Harry’s release as the boy shuddered below him.</p>
<p>He raised his eyes to the omega, loving how debauched the boy looked. Not tearing his eyes away from Harry he let his fingers seek out the boy’s hole, groaning when they found their prize coated in so much slick that Severus could just slide right in. Two fingers slid in easily and Harry gasped, Severus rotated them around trying to find the magic spot.</p>
<p>‘I thought you weren’t going to fuck me’ – Harry smiled softly.</p>
<p>Snape narrowed his eyes: ‘Arrogance does not become you’, and just then he found the prostate as Harry’s back came off the bed and he struggled to breathe; another novel stimulation. Severus continued to thrust his fingers in and out, adding a third one for good measure. Harry’s hand crept up to his cock but Severus stopped it before it reached the swollen shaft.</p>
<p>‘I wonder if you can come just like this, with just my fingers’</p>
<p>He let go of Harry’s hand and took hold of his wand, casting another non-verbal spell which brought the boy’s hands to the headboard and tied them with invisible rope. Harry gasped; locked eyes with Severus and then he was coming; his hole convulsing around Snape’s fingers. Snape’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>‘You liked that’ – He mused, imagining all other possibilities of tying up the boy.</p>
<p>‘Only by you’ – Harry whispered and Severus growled, bringing their mouths together again and kissing the boy until he was breathless and begging again.</p>
<p>Severus managed to bring the boy off several times, until the boy passed out from pleasure leaving Severus to jerk himself off quickly on top of the boy, marking him with his seed and feeling guilty about it. He sat on the corner of the bed, watching Harry sleep peacefully and thought about what he had done. When the heat ended Harry would kill him, it didn’t matter that Snape hasn’t fucked him, he still took advantage of him.</p>
<p>Why was his life always so fucking complicated?</p>
