    <p>“You’ve <em>got </em>to be joking.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The young elf-prince before him blinks, startled by his outburst.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Please tell me you’re joking,” Graves wheezes desperately, casting his glance around in the hopes of spotting the unfortunate souls responsible for this massive fuck-up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They are, of course, nowhere to be found.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Graves crosses an arm over his stomach and cradles his head in his other hand, dragging it down with a groan to cup his chin and stare at the wide-eyed, trembling elf still standing in front of him. It would be foolish to pretend he doesn’t know who this is. Any criminally young warrior still wet behind the ears would recognize Newton Scamander, chosen heir of the greatest, most powerful mage in existence –</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And, of course, runner-up as the head of the massive rebel army currently devastating the kingdom’s borders, and therefore at the tip top of every single mercenary's hit list, right under the ringleader himself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“He said you could protect me,” the elf mutters, and neither of them need to clarify exactly which ‘he’ is being referred to here. Dumbledore has ever had the notoriety for such a thing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Graves squeezes his eyes shut with a look of pain. “Of course he did.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“And escort me to the Citadel.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Naturally.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“In three days.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Graves blinks and raises a single eyebrow. “You do realize we are at least a week out from the Citadel.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Newton’s jaw firms as he lifts his chin. “He said you could do it in three.” Graves stares. “It <em>must </em>be three.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh. Well. If it <em>must </em>be – by all means, then. Graves sweeps his arm out grandly toward the expansive forest next to them with an ironic half bow, sarcasm practically dripping from each word as he says, “After you, my lord.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The elf levels him with an inscrutable look, and Graves knows he’s wondering if Dumbledore has made some sort of mistake, because he is wondering the very same himself and thinking he does not get paid nearly enough for these types of missions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Right, then,” Newton nods jerkily and starts for the trees with a determined stride.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Graves follows only a half-step behind, and within moments the pair are engulfed by the thick, unforgiving foliage and the massive amount of fuckery the universe seems to think appropriate for such a quest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>Three days later they stumble up the Citadel’s ridiculous amount of steps in one piece (more or less), and minus one finely dwarven crafted blade (because <em>someone </em>threw it off a goddamned mountain in a fit of pique, which Graves is still miffed about – the sword was <em>expensive</em>, you little wing-eared bastard) and collapse on the marble landing in a heap of sweat, dust, and gods only knows what that blue substance is that has congealed all over Graves’ armor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Likely remnants <em>a la troll.</em></p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>They lay gasping, sprawled as if flung carelessly by an ungrateful child’s hand, and Graves thinks he really could really go for a drink or six.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A ringing voice cuts that dream short, however, with the sound of quick, clicking steps. “Wonderful, you’ve made it!” They both tip their heads back a fraction as Dumbledore approaches, his eyes twinkling merrily. He claps his hands authoritatively and smiles down at them. “Come along then, we’ve not much time. The spell only works during the solstice, you know, and I don’t believe Grindelwald will ever present us with such a chance again.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As quickly as he appeared, Dumbledore vanishes again, leaving the pair of them to struggle to their feet, pawing at each other for support on kitten-weak legs and staggering limbs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You know,” Graves mutters, supporting most of their weight and finding that he doesn’t mind nearly as much as he would have three days ago, and probably enjoying it more than he should. “I think I need a vacation.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He feels more than hears his charge laughing, thin shoulders shaking in his grasp as they haul themselves to the top of the magus tower. Graves feels his own lips lifting in an exhausted grin, widening further when a mop of messy ginger hair drops onto his shoulder as Newton huffs, “I think I’ll join you.”</p>
<p> </p>
