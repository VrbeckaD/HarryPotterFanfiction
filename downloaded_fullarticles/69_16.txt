    <p>The Van Ecks were one of the oldest and proudest lines of wizarding families to ever attend Hogwarts. Every Van Eck was sorted into Ravenclaw, and their reputation and power grew with each generation.</p>
<p>When Wylan Van Eck was a child, his future seemed set in stone. He would attend Hogwarts when he turned eleven, be sorted into Ravenclaw like his ancestors, and grow up to be a powerful wizard like his father before him. Even after his mother died and it was just him and his father alone in the mansion, even though Wylan had yet to display any magical tendencies that should have long since surfaced, that was what he expected to happen.</p>
<p>Then he turned eleven.</p>
<p>And no letter from Hogwarts came.</p>
<p>Their last shred of hope that he wasn’t a Squib evaporated with the non-existent letter, and from that day on, Wylan’s life changed forever. He no longer was allowed to spend time with the other children his age. He didn’t go to events with his father anymore or even leave the house without supervision.</p>
<p>During school months, his father told everyone Wylan was attending a wizarding school overseas in America, while Wylan was confined to his room, staring at the same four walls around him until he thought he’d lose his mind. Around the holidays, when all the young witches and wizards came home from Hogwarts, he was allowed to go outside again, but only in his father’s company and only if he kept his mouth shut. He wasn’t permitted to speak to the other children, lest they ask him questions about the fancy American school he’d never seen.</p>
<p>Wylan got a brief reprieve when guests visited his father during the holidays, because then he was called downstairs to join them—as long as he didn’t say a word about his schooling—and almost felt like a member of the family again.</p>
<p>Then the guests would leave, and life would return to normal.</p>
<p>When Wylan turned fourteen, he asked his father if he could start attending a Muggle school, maybe even one that really was in America, to maintain the deception. Back when his father had researched ways to “fix” a Squib, Wylan had overheard him talking to a witch whose cousin was a Squib. She said her cousin had integrated into the Muggle world and gotten a job there. At least if Wylan went to a Muggle school, he might make friends. At least his life, even if it would never have magic, would involve more than staring at the walls of the house that had become his prison.</p>
<p>The beating his father gave him in response to his suggestion ensured he never brought it up again.</p>
<p>From there, things only got worse. For a time, Wylan had been tutored in other subjects, by teachers paid to keep their silence about his condition, but it soon became apparent that in addition to his magical deficiencies, he couldn’t read, either. Unable to make it as a wizard, he wouldn’t even make it in the Muggle world. He had no hope, his father told him, no chance of ever being anything but a burden.</p>
<p>He had become his father’s darkest secret, a blot on the Van Eck family’s spotless reputation.</p>
<p>All Wylan had left was music he wasn’t allowed to play when anyone could hear, a knack for mathematics that no one cared about, and a future that looked increasingly like an empty void, because what future could there be for someone like him?</p>
<p>That was why it came as such a surprise when, one day, his father offered to take him to Diagon Alley.</p>
<p align="center">#</p>
<p>Wylan hadn’t seen Diagon Alley since he was eight years old. Eight more years had passed since then, but at sixteen, he was no less awed than when he saw it for the first time. The shops, the witches and wizards, the occasional bits of magic being performed—it all made him want to cry out in delight, although he kept himself composed.</p>
<p>If he made it too obvious he didn’t get to see these things on a regular basis, people would become suspicious about him, and then he’d never be allowed to come again.</p>
<p>Wylan glanced up at his father, who led him through the streets with an impassive expression. Maybe if he was good and this trip went off without a problem, his father would bring him again sometime. His heart skipped a beat. Maybe this was a <em>test</em>, and if he proved he could pretend to be a wizard, he’d actually be allowed to spend time with other witches and wizards again. After all, it wouldn’t be much longer before he was supposed to graduate from his fictional American school.</p>
<p>He straightened his shoulders and tried to look like the other students he saw—well, more or less, since they all seemed to be having fun with their friends or showing off their magic, and he couldn’t do that.</p>
<p>But he could pretend. Yes, if he had to pretend for the rest of his life that he’d attended a foreign wizarding school, if he had to tell lies about a phony job while staying hidden during working hours, if he always remained a dark secret that had to be hidden to protect his father’s reputation, he would obey without complaint if it meant getting to see things like this.</p>
<p>His father gave no indication of where they were going, and Wylan didn’t ask. That might be part of the test.</p>
<p>He would be good, he would be good, he would be good.</p>
<p>Strange that Alys hadn’t come with them. His father’s second wife had only recently graduated Hogwarts herself, and she always told Wylan stories about how wonderful Diagon Alley was, and Hogsmeade too. Alys was a walking disaster when she wielded her wand, but she still had more magic than Wylan did. Everyone expected that her unborn child would be a great witch or wizard and probably carry on the family tradition of being sorted into Ravenclaw, although when Wylan was feeling particularly bitter, he had his doubts.</p>
<p>Alys didn’t understand why Wylan being a Squib was so embarrassing. That was probably why she hadn’t come with them, since his father would need to reprimand him if he did anything to give away his secret, and he rarely reprimanded Wylan where Alys could see.</p>
<p>Well, there would be no reprimands today. Wylan followed his father and vowed to be a perfect son—or as close as he could get, since a perfect son would have magic and be able to read.</p>
<p>His father stopped and turned to face him. “Wylan, I want you to do something for me.”</p>
<p>Wylan straightened up further and tried not to let his joy show too much. His father was actually <em>trusting</em> him with something? Things really had changed. Maybe it was because he’d turned sixteen. “Yes, sir?”</p>
<p>“Take this.” His father handed him a wrapped package. “I have more errands to run, but I want you to drop off this package at a certain shop. Are you capable of doing that?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>“I can give you directions to the shop. Will you be able to follow them despite your”—his mouth tightened, and he waved a hand toward the various signs Wylan couldn’t read—“<em>defects</em>?”</p>
<p>Wylan managed not to flinch. “I can follow directions, sir.”</p>
<p>Memorizing things had made his reading lessons a bit more bearable for a while, although he hadn’t been able to keep up the pretense forever. Nevertheless, it remained one of the few skills he was proud of.</p>
<p>“Good.” His father actually <em>smiled</em> at him. “Don’t let me down, Wylan.”</p>
<p>“I won’t, sir.”</p>
<p>Whatever the task was, he would succeed. Wylan could barely breathe. His father hadn’t given him a genuine smile in years. Things definitely had changed.</p>
<p>This was probably the only chance he would get, so he’d make the most of it. He’d prove he wasn’t worthless after all.</p>
<p>“Carry this with you when you go.” His father handed him a small pendant in the shape of a star.</p>
<p>It was cold to the touch and felt strange against his hand. Wylan frowned at it. “What is this for?”</p>
<p>“Don’t ask stupid questions. Someone might hear you. You’re not a wizard; of course you don’t know what to do with it.”</p>
<p>Wylan flinched.</p>
<p>“Carry it in case you need it. If you run into trouble, make sure you have it in sight. Or is that too much for you to handle?”</p>
<p>“No, sir. I can handle it.” Wylan put the pendant around his neck.</p>
<p>He didn’t understand, but if his father trusted him with this task, Wylan would make him proud. He would pass the test.</p>
<p>He would make sure this was the start of a new life for himself.</p>
