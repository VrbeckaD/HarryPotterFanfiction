  <span>Lily looked around the dust covered room. It had remained locked for as long as she could remember, and she’d never questioned the rule not to enter. But curiosity overcame her that morning. Her eyes scanned the walls, covered in pictures and posters, obscured by the light grey flecks and cobwebs. She took out a wand from her back pocket, waved it, and said, “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Scourgify!</span>
  </em>
  <span>” The dust rose from the surfaces of the room into the air, swirled and vanished. Lily smiled, triumphant. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A small stack of books on the dresser caught her eye; contrasting the environment set by the rest of the room. An unopened parcel sat on top, wrapped in twine securing a letter against the brown wrappings. Crossing to it, she saw the name “Sirius” scrawled across the envelope in fine cursive. Her heart skipped a beat. It was still sealed. She fought with herself for a moment, urging her to let it be. It was not hers to touch. For the second time that morning, her curiosity got the better of her. After all, she could reseal the letter after and no one would ever know. She slipped a finger beneath the seal and popped open the fold, removing the single page from within and read the letter, written in the same script.</span>
</p><p> </p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <span>Dear Sirius,</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>I found this in the wreckage of the McKinnon’s cottage years ago. I believe she would’ve wanted you to have it. Please don’t let it fall into the wrong hands. If you’re reading this, you should be able to read </span>
    <em>
      <span>it</span>
    </em>
    <span> as well.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>I’m so sorry.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Yours,</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Emmeline Vance</span>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lily’s heartbeat quickened. “James! Come here!” she called.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it?” she heard his voice muffled from two stories below.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve found something!” she called back, placing the letter on the dresser and carefully peeling back the brown wrappings of the parcel. She heard footsteps scurry up the stairs. A moment later he was standing at the door, jaw dropped in shock.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lily, what are you doing in here?” He said in a loud whisper. “Dad would be furious if he found out!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’d be furious at </span>
  <em>
    <span>you,</span>
  </em>
  <span>” she sneered, a hint of pride in her voice. “He never gets mad at </span>
  <em>
    <span>me</span>
  </em>
  <span>. He thinks I’m a perfect little angel, remember? Besides he and Mum won’t be home for hours. They’ll never even know.” She turned her back on him, her attention on the parcel. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You get away with everything,” James groaned, joining her at the dresser. She finished removing the wrappings to find a black leather bound book with a silver clasp.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is that?” James asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think it’s a Diary,” she responded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He snatched it from her hands, clicking open the lock. “It’s blank,” he said, flipping through the pages. He looked up at her in horror as a thought struck him. “You don’t think it’s the one from when Mum and Dad were at school, do you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t be stupid, why would it be here? And besides, that one was destroyed, remember?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But Dad said it was blank when he found it and so is this one!” He said, turning it to face her. Lily looked at the pages, strewn with ink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You really are thick, aren’t you? Or have your glasses stopped working?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you on about?” he replied. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She snatched the book back from him, open to the alleged blank page in the middle he’d shown her, pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose, slid her black hair behind her ear, cleared her throat, and read aloud, “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Fifth October, 1975. James Potter is the biggest nerd on the planet!</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oi!” James protested, grabbing at the book.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s written here! Not my fault she could see the future!” Lily yelled, moving it out of his reach. She continued to read aloud quickly, “‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>Oh my God. I can’t breathe. Sirius showed me a piece of parchment he’d stolen from James’ notebook. Had little hearts drawn all over it, with LE+JP written in giant letters.’</span>
  </em>
  <span> Aww, who’s “LE,” James?</span>
  <em>
    <span>”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t bloody well know!” James moved to look over her shoulder. “Where are you reading that from? There’s nothing written there!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked up into his eyes, and saw genuine confusion in them. “You really can’t see anything?” He shook his head. She suddenly remembered the last line from the letter. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“If you’re reading this, you should be able to read </span>
  </em>
  <span>it</span>
  <em>
    <span> as well.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> She grabbed the letter from the dresser, and shoved it in his face. “Read this, quickly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His eyes scanned the page. “Who’s Emmeline Vance?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily shrugged. “A friend of Sirius’, I guess? I’ve never heard of her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James scowled, thinking hard to remember if he’d hear the name before. “Woah!” he exclaimed after a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily started in surprise. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He snatched the Diary from her hand yet again, and his eyes flew back and forth on the page, holding it out of her reach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“James Sirius Potter, give that back!” she yelled at him, trying to get it back from him. It was no use, his arms were much longer, and he much taller.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hold on, I’m reading!” He said, fending her off with one arm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She stopped fighting instantly. “You can see it now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah!” he said in wonder. He paused, staring at the words on the page, in deep thought. “L.E. …. You don’t think it stands for Lily Evans, do you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily’s brown eyes widened in shock behind her glasses. “...you think it’s about Dad’s parents?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How many other James Potter’s do you know of besides me?” he asked, turning his head back to the black leather book.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well stop, I want to read it, too!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why should I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because I found it!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well it was addressed to ‘Sirius’ and I’m the only one in the family who has that in their name.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know perfectly well it wasn’t for you. We can read it together.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He narrowed his eyes at her, as she scowled at him. “Fine,” he conceded, lowering his arm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Should we get Albus, too, then?” She asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shook his head. “He’ll just tell Mum. And you know how freaked out she would be if she found out we were reading a Diary that had been… y’know.... </span>
  <em>
    <span>Magicked.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“True,” she replied with a sigh and plopped down on the edge of the bed. James sat down next to her, flipping through the pages back to the beginning. And the two siblings began to read, side by side.</span>
