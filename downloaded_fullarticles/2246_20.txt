    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>The sky was pitch black, its stars and bright moon hidden, stolen by clouds. Bare wooden skeletons, the only remainder of life once there, poked out from their white graves. Their shadows reaching, clawing at one another with bony hands. No critter dared to travel at these witching hours, knowing the air at this time was charged, the night silent. Still. </p>
<p>Growing.</p>
<p>Some say prolonged silence can drive men to madness, human brains unable to withstand such a soundless vacuum. Even the most sane person would break within an hour or two. Less, even, for a man tormented by fears and paranoia.</p>
<p>A shrill cry broke the night. Murders of crows awoke screaming, echoing the cry, and set off into the darkness. </p>
<p>In the shadows inside a dilapidated warehouse, a figure writhed. Their feet were bound to the chair legs, their wrists bound to the elbow by rope, keeping the struggling figure in place. Their neck was bound too, with coarse rope that cut skin with each agitated shake. Their mouth held wide by a gag, panicked screams muffled by the cloth. The chair lifted and fell with each jarring tug, rocking side to side, creating a metronomic “thump, thump” sound that echoed around the empty space.</p>
<p>Until the jerk was so harsh and powerful that it landed on the floor with a loud crash, straining figure and all. </p>
<p>They laid there, fingers rabidly scratching at its bonds, fingernails peeled and bloodied from friction. </p>
<p>Suddenly, a single bare light switched on. The naked bulb hung from the rafters above, illuminating the ground like a spotlight. Frantic movements stopped, similar to a deer in headlights. </p>
<p>Distressed eyes flicked back in forth in an attempt to notice movement. White puffs accompanied by harsh breathing was the only noise in the winter air, but all they could hear was their rushing pulse. </p>
<p>Then, out of the silence, came the “click-click”ing of dress shoes. </p>
<p>The sound circled around the perimeter of the light, just out of sight. Once, twice, and again. The bound figure strained their head to follow the sound. </p>
<p>From an unspoken signal, two brute men came behind the fallen chair and propped it back into place. They put a hand to flailing shoulders, effectively ending the futile escape attempts.</p>
<p>“Mr. Parsons,” An accented voice drawled from the shadows, the dress shoes rounding to a stop beside the trapped man’s ear, “How are you today?”</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons whipped his head to the side, screaming muffled profanities at the man–-no, <i>boy</i> in front of him. </p>
<p>The boy only smirked at him. “<i>Bonsoir, Monsieur</i> Parsons.” </p>
<p>Mr. Parsons looked in disbelief at the boy. For he was surely merely a boy, just past the cusp of youth, dressed in the finest of silk suits money could buy, like a son imitating their father. The child had dark brown locks swept to one side, dark eyes that looked a bit too red in a specific light, and a handsome aristocratic face still softened by baby fat. How could someone so young be on this path?</p>
<p>The boy’s features contorted, a snarl on his lips. “Don’t you <i>dare</i> pity <i>me</i>!” He threw out a hand and struck Mr. Parsons’ face. “I <i>chose</i> this path!” </p>
<p>He stepped back and ran a hand down his face, his expression reverting once he had done so. As if the lapse of anger was merely a trick of the eye. </p>
<p>“Sorry about that, Mr. Parsons, I just don’t do well with pity,” the boy gave a soft smile that never reached his eyes, “How did you like our escort services? Any complaints that need to be filed?” When all he got back was a muffled angry response, he clapped his hands and exclaimed, “Oh! That’s right, you can’t speak. Take off the gag.”</p>
<p>One of the brutes untied the gag from Mr. Parsons’ mouth, who spat it out before staring down the boy. “Complaints? Of fucking course I have them! Let me go, you bratty kid! Why the fuck am I––” </p>
<p>Mr. Parsons was cut off with another punch, his head snapping to the side with the force of it. </p>
<p>“Who do you think you are, Mr. Parsons?” The boy asked, his voice frigid, rage simmering beneath the tone. “To call me a ‘<i>kid</i>’? I am no less of an adult than you or the two behind you are.” </p>
<p>The boy took off his suit jacket and placed it into the hands of a waiting brute, revealing a waistcoat and a white button down, his hands moving to fold the sleeves up to his elbows. He walked back to Mr. Parsons with something in hand.</p>
<p>“The reason why you are here, Mr. Parsons, is because of what you’ve done. Selling company secrets is a big no-no. I’m sure you know that; after all, you wouldn’t have run away if you didn’t.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Mr. Parsons bit out. Rage burned inside of him, he’d done nothing wrong to this kid. How dare he blame him for something he didn’t do?</p>
<p>“You… don’t know?” The boy blinked at him before doubling over with laughter. “Oh, that’s hilarious! Someone, bring me a chair!” A chair was brought, and he immediately flipped it so he sat backwards on it, resting his arms on the chair back. </p>
<p>He looked on at Mr. Parsons expectedly while silence reigned between them. Unnerved, Mr. Parsons fidgeted underneath the boy’s gaze. The accusatory gaze tripped locked memories in Mr. Parsons’ heart. He swallowed, looking away before finally breaking.</p>
<p>“I–-I really don’t know,” Mr. Parsons said, confused and determined to keep his innocence about this whole thing. “Did… did I do something to you? Your family?”</p>
<p>The boy narrowed his gaze, a blank look on his face. He didn’t believe him, it seemed. Mr. Parsons was at a loss; he didn’t know what was going on, and the boy wasn’t helping at all!</p>
<p>A few beats of silence before the boy opened his mouth again and agreed, “My family.”</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons racked his head, trying to recall whether he had ever seen this boy before, either in passing or directly. </p>
<p>A tongue clucked in front of him, and his attention shot back to the boy who had lifted his head away in irritation, unwilling to look at the disgrace. </p>
<p>“What a pain,” The boy mumbled under his breath, uncaring if Mr. Parsons overheard. He breathed a huff from his nose, annoyance grating at his nerves. He snapped his head back to look at Mr. Parsons, a smirk slowly growing on his lips. </p>
<p>“Nathaniel Jackson Parsons, 36; date of birth: November 29th, 1982, mother: Rachel Elis nee Norsi. father: Mitchell Ross Elis.” He cocked his head at Mr. Parsons. It seemed like he still didn’t take him seriously. Time to go deeper. “Lives in a flat with a bichon frise named Marsha. Currently pursuing a relationship with a young medical student, Caroline Yvonne Mayer, 20 years old.” Finally a reaction, a twitch. But not enough. </p>
<p>“Has a family that he has neglected for six years.” The boy’s smirk practically grew feral as he enunciated the next sentences. “A household of three in Nottingham: a single mother and two children. Katherine Vang, 34, works three jobs a week and still finds the time to spend with her children. Daughter Terry Harmony Elis, age 8, attends a prestigious school for talented girls. And Sean-dean Elis, age 5––”</p>
<p>“Stop! Stop!” Mr. Parsons cried out, body shaking and tears dripping down his face. “What do you want? I’ll–-I’ll tell you everything! Please,” He dropped his head onto his chest, defeated, his voice small and quivering, “Please, just don’t hurt them….”</p>
<p>The boy got up and patted the shoulder of the sobbing figure before rounding behind him and whispering, “You should have done this earlier, Mr. Parsons.” </p>
<p>“On July 24th, where were you, Mr. Parsons?” He asked, walking the perimeter of the spotlight.</p>
<p>“J-July 24th? That was <i>months</i> ago! How can I even remember that!?” </p>
<p>“Oh?” The boy halted in his rounds, side-eyeing the man. “You don’t remember? Shall I… ask your wife?”</p>
<p>“No! I remember, I remember! I… I was at that one French bookstore! The one owned by the… the Riddle family,” Realization dawned on Mr. Parsons face, which quickly led to horror. “And… you were the boy at the register….”</p>
<p>“I see that you remember, how momentous,” The boy drawled, his voice as dry as sandpaper, sending shivers down Mr. Parsons back. Cold sweat ran down his face in rivets as the severity of the situation made itself known to him. “Sad that you only know how consequential it is now.”</p>
<p>“I… I was forced to! I–-I didn’t want to do it! I was forced! They threatened me with Caroline! I can’t have anything happen to her!”</p>
<p>“But you’re willing to have your <i>family</i> hurt?” </p>
<p>The man flinched at that. “No!” He roared. “Never!”</p>
<p>“‘No’? ‘Never’?” The boy mocked, his voice crudely imitating the desperate man’s. “<i>Monsieur</i> Parsons, what a worthless father you are. To sell your family’s life for a measly £15,000? Pathetic.”</p>
<p>The man whimpered and begged. Too late, the boy thought, way too late. Too late for his pathetic life and for the relationships he was trying to salvage. He raised the Glock in his hand, aiming it at Mr. Parsons’ head, a silencer in place. </p>
<p>“I’ll ask you one more question, <i>Monsieur</i> Parsons before I blow a hole through your skull. I’d advise that you answer as truthfully as possible. Well, as much as a whistleblower like you could.</p>
<p>“Have you heard news of a runaway from my family? Curly black hair with green eyes, a tad shorter than I?”</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons only shook his head, defeated, a shell of his former self at the realization of what his actions had cost him. The boy gave out a soft sigh. “I see. <i>Merci pour votre disponibilité.</i> Don’t worry about your family, <i>Monsieur</i> Parsons, they will be fine.”</p>
<p>He pulled the trigger.  </p>
<p>A splatter of warm blood landed on his cheek as the body in front of him slumped forward in its bonds, the two goons removing their hands, never once flinching.</p>
<p>“Because they never existed in the first place.”</p>
<p>O0o.o0O</p>
<p>Tom leaned back, resting his back on the cold leather of the car seat. He closed his eyes in frustration. So close, yet so far. </p>
<p>One of the goons entered the car, and within moments the car was started, heading back to civilization. Silence settled between the occupants before a faint cough from the front reminded Tom of his duty.</p>
<p>He knocked his head back and exhaled. Better to get it over with. He slid his phone out from his pocket and brought it up to his face–-squinting from the screen’s bright light–-and made a call. </p>
<p>The dialing tone seemed to run on forever, the repetitive sound nearly luring Tom to sleep. After all, despite how much he hated it, his body was still growing, and it was way past his bedtime. The call connected with a click. Silence greeted him from the other side, but Tom knew that he was there. Waiting, expectant, attentive.</p>
<p>“The rat has been found and dealt with accordingly.”</p>
<p>
  <i>“And?”</i>
</p>
<p>Tom looked out the window, the moon peeking out from its barriers of clouds, illuminating the ground before being suppressed once again, plunging the scenery back into darkness. “...There was no news about him.”</p>
<p>
  <i>”...Is that so?”</i>
</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p><i>”Continue. I expect results.”</i> And with that, the dial tone was his only companion.</p>
<p>Tom sighed again, “<i>Oui, Père,</i>” and let his phone slip out of his grip, choosing instead to cover his eyes with his arm. Fuck. He’s too tired for this.</p>
<p>With a groan, he dropped his arm and dug around in his pocket. He took out his wallet and opened it, gently sliding a photo out of a slot. The picture was well-cared for, the glossy varnish of the photo still pristine, but the edges of the paper were frayed from the numerous amounts of times it was removed. </p>
<p>Tom studied the two boys in the photo before dragging a finger down one of the boys’ faces, the one with black curls, green eyes, glasses, and a big smile, hugging a smaller figure beside him. </p>
<p><i>Grand frère</i>, where are you? </p>
<p>O0o.o0O</p>
<p>
  <i>“Grand frère! Grand frère! I’m going to marry you one day!” Tom declared. His little chest puffed out proudly as he pointed at his brother, cheeks painted pink by determination.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Wh-what?” Harry stuttered, his pen slipping from his hand in shock splattering ink onto his work. “Tom, we can’t get married!”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“But--but we love each other!”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Tom deflated at the rejection, tears beginning to well in his eyes. He crossed his arms across his chest, pouting. Terrified that Tom was going to cause a scene, Harry quickly turned around in his seat to comfort his brother. He held open his arms, and Tom ran into them, burying his face into Harry’s sweater.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“What do you mean we can’t get married?” Tom mumbled, and Harry strained to hear.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Exactly what I mean, Tom. We can’t get married–-we’re siblings.” He winced when Tom pounded his fists against his chest. For a seven year old, Tom had a lot of strength.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Besides, Tom, we’re still children, isn’t it a bit too early to think about marriage? I’m only twelve, and you’re seven.”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>The boy adamantly shook his head, “It’s never too early! And I want to get married to you, Harry!”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Harry scratched at his head with one hand, the other on his brother’s back, attempting to soothe him down. How was he supposed to break this to his brother? The one that looked at him as if he hung the stars in the sky and followed him around like a duckling? “W-well Tom, it’s because the love to get married is different from the love that we as brothers have. You have to have the love Mère and Père have before you can get married, okay?”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Soon Tom began to relax and nodded, no longer willing to throw a tantrum, but his sniffles had yet to settle down. “I… I understand, Harry.” Then he jumped out of Harry’s hold, stood proudly once more, took a deep breath, and pointed at his brother. “I’m going to take over the Milieu! I’ll become the next head! Since you don’t want to become the Caïd, I’ll become it, and then take you on as my wife! After all, every Caïd needs a strong wife!”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“T-Tom!” Harry cried out, scandalized, his face flushed with mortification. “Did you not understand me?! We can’t get married!”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Hmph! Fine, then at least stay by my side, okay?”</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Okay, Tom, we can’t get married, but I’ll stay by your side.” Harry reached out his hand to twine his pinky against his brother’s outstretched one.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Forever?” </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>“Yes, forever.” And they sealed the promise with a kiss of their thumbs.</i>
