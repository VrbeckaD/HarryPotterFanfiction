          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Ch 7: <em>Halfway up the field stood an extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature palace, with several live peacocks tethered at the entrance.</em></p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>“I see your first edition of <em>1,001 Magical Herbs and Fungi</em> and raise you… four peacocks.”</p>
<p>“Peacocks?” Crabbe scoffed, “Don’t be ridiculous!”</p>
<p>“These are rare, albino ones! Makes an especially strong Dragon Tonic, if you want to sell the feathers. And the quills are exquisite!” </p>
<p>Lucius restrained an eyeroll but nodded his agreement. He’d always wanted peacocks for the Manor, but Narcissa thought they posed a danger to Draco. But Draco was grown now and could surely hold his own against a few birds. This was his chance to have them, without purchasing them against his wife’s wishes.</p>
<p>Yaxley flicked his wand at the center of the table and the glowing image of four albino peacocks joined the other items in the pot. </p>
<p>“Read ‘em and weep, boys!” Yaxley grinned. With an undignified squeal, he revealed four kings to the table.</p>
<p>“Not so fast,” Lucius said quietly. One at a time, he set four aces on the table. Gasps of shock went around. He resisted grinning as foolishly as Yaxley had a moment ago.</p>
<p>Yaxley shot to his feet. “You cheating bastard!”</p>
<p>“Yaxley,” Lucius sighed, pulling his wand in one smooth, deliberate motion, “You know very well cheating is impossible with the number of spells on the cards.”</p>
<p>“But those - this was - “</p>
<p>“Face it, Yaxley,” Crabbe grinned, “You lost this round.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be taking my winnings, gentlemen, and bid you good evening.” Lucius swirled his wand over the glowing images and with a small pop, the real items appeared before him. He shrunk the books and potions, and pocketed them before gathering the ropes tethering the peacocks together.</p>
<p>He tied them to a stake just outside his tent, then adjusted his robes and smoothed his hair one last time. Taking a moment to gather his thoughts, he entered the tent, determined to convince Narcissa to let him take the peacocks back to the Manor.</p></div>
