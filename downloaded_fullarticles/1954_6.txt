    <p>“I still have no idea why we are entertaining these...muggles.” Clytemnestra sniffed, as if the very word itself was too dirty to speak in her pureblood mouth.</p><p>Marius Black clenched his teeth and forced himself not to snap back at her. “I’ve told you multiple times now, Nestra, that Gunnings said Dursley is very good at what he does, and that we should give the account to the company he’s working for. He said we would be in very good hands.”</p><p>Nestra only grimaced. “And so why isn’t Gunnings here if he likes this Dursley fellow so much? What does he think, that you’re to wait on his beck and call? Please.” Clytemnestra lifted her chin haughtily. “I think it’s atrocious that Gunnings thinks the illustrious House of Black will wait on anybody, especially muggle scum.”</p><p>“Clytemnestra Aledrina Black!” Marius snapped sharply. Nestra flinched back at his tone, but Marius could bear her whinging no longer. “Part of the illustrious House of Black you say? Why, do please tell that to your brother Lucius, yes, I’m sure he’d love to hear all about that. How convenient of you to forget our dual squib status, making us both a part of the Illustrious House of <em>Failure</em>.”</p><p>Nestra was pale, and her lips stretched into a thin hard line. “Marius I was simply talking in aside to myself about how horrible this situation is, I had not meant to offend-”</p><p>“Can it, Nestra.” Marius cut in brusquely, fixing his tie in the car visor’s mirror. “We both know very well you were not talking in aside to anyone except for me. You will be polite to the 'muggle scum' as you so call them because they are the only thing keeping those pearl necklaces you so adore around your neck.”</p><p>Nestra simply stuck her nose in the air and looked the other way, making a simpering sound in the back of her throat to signify her acquiesce. Meanwhile, Marius sighed, slightly annoyed and slightly proud of his wife.</p><p>Squibs though they may be, they were certainly still leagues above muggles.</p><p>---</p><p>“Harry!” Uncle Vernon roared, face red as a fire truck. “Why are you still in the kitchen? Need I remind you we have guests coming over today and the last thing they want to see is your rotten orphan face!”</p><p>Harry hissed under his breath when Uncle Vernon’s hand came down on the side of his face with a loud <em>thwap!</em>, almost knocking him over.</p><p>“Well go on then you runt, get in the closet already! Are you deaf as well as stupid now?”</p><p>“Aunt Petunia wanted me to finish washing the dishes.” He mumbled.</p><p>It looked like it was the wrong thing to say when Uncle Vernon’s face became even redder. “Well it’s too late now you twat! Guess you won’t be having supper today!”</p><p>Harry’s stomach growled in response and he clenched his jaw in order not to say anything he would regret later. <em>It’s not like they ever feed me anyway</em>, he thought to himself bitterly.</p><p>Just when Harry thought it couldn't get any worse Dudley came over in his Smelting Uniform, knobby stick included, and whacked Harry right in the back of his legs. Harry fell right to his knees, mind blank with shock from the pain.</p><p>Dudley keened with laughter. “I caught a pig, I caught a pig!” He bragged. “Come on piggy, get up.” Dudley kicked his shoe into Harry’s side, annoyed Harry wasn't doing as he asked. “Piggy, get up unless you wanna get cooked into bacon!”</p><p>Harry bit into the inside of his cheek until he tasted blood, trying to calm down. Dudley, calling him a pig? When he was ten times the size of any winning pig at a county fair?</p><p>Luckily for Harry, Vernon stepped in, if only to get Harry moving into the closet. “Dudley enough with your childish games we have company coming soon!” He scolded. “You can practice playing with your stick after our guests have left.”</p><p>Dudley whined. “But Daddy I want to play now!”</p><p>Vernon did not seem to be in the mood for one of Dudley’s temper tantrums. “Dudley enough!” He snapped before rounding on Harry. “And you,” he snarled, looking straight at Harry, “you filthy orphan ragamuffin! Get in the closet before I force you into the closet.”</p><p>“Yes Uncle Vernon,” Harry replied through clenched teeth, feeling a knot of something intense and powerful in the pit of his belly. He clenched his fists tightly, trying to keep away the urge to hurt, to break, to fracture something into smithereens, because he knew it would only land him in more trouble. And Harry would have eventually calmed down on his own in the closet, except that right when he was about to get in Dudley hit him again, this time right on the back.</p><p>Harry fell over from the force of the blow and hit his head on the corner of one of the tables when he was going down. The wind had been knocked out of him and he struggled to breathe, while his head felt like a bowling ball had just smashed into it. The last thing he heard right before everything went dark was Dudley’s huffing guffaws and Uncle Vernon’s gasp of shock.</p><p>---</p><p>              The Dursley’s, even for muggles, were very disgusting people. They were all obscenely round, except for the wife who was frightfully thin. Petunia seemed like she would hold up against most things like a sapling in a harsh storm; that is to say, that she looked extremely meek and delicate-like, and that she did not look like she would hold up against anything at all. But Petunia Dursley, for such a little women, was loud and incessantly chatty, and more than a little pompous, for which reasons Marius could not understand, as she was a muggle and had nothing to be pompous about.</p><p>              Mr. Dursley and his son however acted exactly how they might look. Mr. Dursley was a large man and had a loud booming voice. He was just as arrogant and pompous as his wife, and his table manners were disgustingly horrid. There was just something about large people and their excessive gluttony that made Marius’ stomach turn. Currently, Mr. Dursley was busy attacking a turkey leg, of which most of was stuck in his mustache, and the rest had flown into Marius’ face in the form of spittle when Mr. Dursley had been speaking.</p><p>              No Dursley, however, was quite as horrendous as Dudley Dursley. Dudley Dursley, who was supposedly ten, though you would think he was older due to his size, was the most terrible little twat Marius ever had the unfortunate chance of knowing. He had no respect for his elders, and constantly interrupted the business dealings with tales of his adventures at Smelting Academy, of which his father was apparently an alumna of. Vernon Dursley, instead of punish his child for speaking out of turn, as would be done in any pureblood family, simply sighed and let the little Dursley walk all over him.</p><p>              Petunia Dursley was no better. In fact, she was worse in entertaining the little Dursley’s whims. While dinner had been pot roast with mashed potatoes on the side, apparently the littlest Dursley couldn’t stand the meal, and Petunia had excused herself to go buy McDonald’s for the little terror, of which he was eating now.</p><p>              All in all, the Dursley family, even for muggles, were quite horrible creatures.</p><p>              Still, even though <em>personally</em> he wished for them to die in a terrible, fiery explosion in one of those horrendous muggle contraptions of theirs, professionally, he realized that Gunnings was right, and Vernon Dursley was very good at his job.</p><p>              Mr. Dursley held out his hand just as Marius and Clytemnestra were standing up to leave.</p><p>              “It was a very nice meeting you, Mr. Black. I hope this dinner has persuaded you into seeing the benefits of giving Hyde Holdings the account, and how we might increase your profits as well.”</p><p>              Marius replied with a polite smile, even though in reality he would rather set Vernon Dursley’s hand on fire rather than shake it. But even though he was a squib, he had grown up pureblood, and purebloods were nothing if not courteous, as well as great actors.</p><p>              “Well, yes, it was a pleasure and-“</p><p>             <em> Thump</em></p><p>              Marius paused, tilting his head to the side. He could have sworn he heard-</p><p>            <em>  Thump</em></p><p>              Marius looked to Vernon, about to open his mouth to ask him what the noise was, when a strange, panicked look crossed the Dursley’s face and all of a sudden he was pushing Marius and his wife to the door.</p><p>              “Yes, yes-“ he said frantically, “quite a pleasure indeed! Off you two go now-“</p><p>              Marius Encliycles Black could stand Mr. Dursley’s horrible table manners, and his horrible reedy voiced wife, and his horrible spawn of a demon himself, but he could not-would not!-stand for Mr. Vernon Dursley, hippogriff dung at the bottom of his shoe, to push him and his wife out the door like they were vermin to shoo off with a sweep of their broom.</p><p>              “Now you listen here Vernon Dursley-!”</p><p>              <em>Thump thump thump thump thump thump thump thump</em></p><p>              “Now what in the name of Merlin and Morgana is that!” Cried Clytemnestra, apparently just as fed up as Marius was.</p><p>              “It sounds like someone is banging on a door is what it sounds like!” Replied Marius, glaring at Mr. Dursley as his eyes flew frantically between him and his wife.</p><p>              “It’s coming from that cupboard under the stairs!”</p><p>              Marius moved to open the cupboard when all of a sudden Vernon moved to block the door.</p><p>              “It’s just our damn dog Chelsea! Had to put her in because she gets rowdy with company.” Vernon laughed nervously as he explained, looking anywhere except at Marius.</p><p>              Marius, though still suspicious, was about to let the subject drop when all of a sudden Dudley spoke up.</p><p>              “Chelsea? We don’t have a dog named Chelsea, Dad! It’s cousin Harry who-“</p><p>              Vernon clamped a hand around Dudley’s mouth.</p><p>              “Harry? Harry!” Marius’ eyes widened comically. They were keeping a muggle boy trapped in their broom closet?! Wasn’t this against some sort of muggle law?</p><p>              Dudley bit down on his father’s hand and Vernon Dursley immediately let go, letting out a shrill cry.</p><p>              “Yes, my cousin Harry Potter.” Replied Dudley, seeming to confuse Marius’ shock with a question of who Harry was. “Though I guess he really isn’t any different from a dog,” said the littlest Dursley, chuckling so hard his chin fat bounced up and down like a yo-yo.</p><p>              “HARRY POTTER!???” Roared Marius. “YOU FILTHY, DIRTY, CRETIN MUGGLES HOW DARE YOU-“</p><p>              “MUGGLES?” This time it was Vernon’s turn to roar in fury.  “YOU’RE ONE OF THEM AREN’T YOU?? THOSE SICK FAIRY POOFS WHO WAVE AROUND STICKS AND CALL THEMSELVES WIZARDS!!”</p><p>              “SICK FAIRY POOFS!???” Screeched Clytemnestra. “I’LL HAVE YOU KNOW YOU ARE SPEAKING TO THE GREAT ILLUSTRIOUS HOUSE OF BLA-“</p><p>              Just then the door to the cupboard exploded, pieces of wood fracturing into pieces, and Harry Potter walked out looking like death reincarnated. His hair was sticking every which way, tiny chest heaving, blood dripping from a cut above his eyebrow. His face was set in a sneer, and his eyes were blown so wide that only a ring of green was visible.</p><p>              There was a moment of silence, where it felt like time had stopped, until Dudley broke that as well.</p><p>              “Well, well, well, looks like the mutt-“</p><p>              There was barely another word out before Harry’s eyes flashed and the littlest Dursley went sailing across the room, smashing through the French sliding doors and into the bushes outside.</p><p>             </p>
