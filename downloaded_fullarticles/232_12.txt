  <strong>Prologue</strong>
</p>
<p>He woke up with a splitting headache, a stinging hand and weirdly-dressed people pointing swords at him. He was lying in a heap in what appeared to be a dungeon, which was strange in itself since the last thing he remembered was sneaking from his office to get away from the dreaded paperwork that came along with being the Master of Death. Maybe Death had found him and decided to be an ass again and shove into the dungeons. However, Harry highly doubted it. For one, the dungeons back in his castle in the Underworld radiated powerful magic since it was used to keep those who were being punished for centuries for heinous crimes they had committed in their lives. There was that and also the fact that no <em>mortal human</em> ever guarded the dungeons.</p>
<p>So the question would be, where the hell had he ended up this time? This was definitely not the Underworld.</p>
<p>Lost in thought, he did not see one of the men leaving the dungeons but he did notice when they manhandled him out of his cell to kneel in the middle of the room. Harry cocked an eyebrow at them but went along willingly, humouring them; they might tell him where he was if he did what they wanted. Unlike anybody else in his place, he was not overly worried; he knew that nothing could actually kill him and even if something <em>did</em> manage to kill him (not that it was likely, what with him being the Master of Death and all), he would just end up back home in the Underworld anyway.</p>
<p>"Not that I don't mind your hospitality," he drawled as he rolled his uncomfortably aching shoulder, mindful of the heavy shackles binding his hands together. "But would you mind telling me where I am?" After a moment during which they armoured men only stared back at him in silence, though he did notice that young one shifting uneasily as Harry's eyes locked onto his form, he sighed. "Or not."</p>
<p>With nothing better to do, he extended his senses outwards, his magic spreading thinly around him to take in any useful information he might find of this place. The first thing he noticed was that there were actual living people in this place, aside from the men guarding him. So this ruled out the Underworld as a likely place for him to be, though he had suspected as much from the moment he had woken up. The next thing he noticed made him recoil; there was something big, hanging somewhere over their heads, and the magic outpour was massive, dangerously so. The world was literally unraveling out there! Sure, it would take some time, but anyone living in this place would not last long. They would most likely end up residents of the Underworld soon, very soon in fact.</p>
<p>A sudden stinging pain in his left hand rudely snapped his attention back in the dungeons. With an incredulous look in his eyes, he stared down at the green, glowing… thing spreading across his palm. Now, what was <em>that</em>!? Oh, he had encountered many different types of magic in his centuries of existence, his first ones being from his own original world before he had refused to take up his role as Master of Death but ultimately ended up as it anyway. This though was not something he had seen before. Admittedly, he had locked himself away from any other world after his introduction to the Underworld, so there were still many things he in fact did not know. Whatever this was though was powerful, this much he could tell, and it reeked of the same magic as what was swallowing the world out there.</p>
<p>The door in front of him banged open, snapping him out of his thoughts and two women, one in armour and the other wearing a long robe with a hood, entered. He could not help but stare as the first woman strode towards him predatorily, circling him like vulture, even as the other woman stayed back.</p>
<p>"Tell me why we shouldn't kill you now," the armoured woman growled as Harry tried to follow her with his eyes. "The Conclave is destroyed. Everyone who attended is dead, except for you."</p>
<p>Harry stayed silent, waiting to see if she was going to say anything else. He was completely lost; he had no idea what was going on or even how he had ended up in that situation in the first place. Just in case he did something wrong, he waited to see what happened next.</p>
<p>She scowled at his silence and roughly grabbed his left wrist. "Explain this."</p>
<p>He let a small grimace slip across his face at her rough treatment (now that was a strong woman if he ever saw one), before he cleared his throat. "Well," he started. "For one, it's the first time I'm seeing something like this, so I can't exactly explain what it is," he continued truthfully.</p>
<p>"You're lying!" She grabbed his arms violently before she was thankfully pushed away by the other woman.</p>
<p>"We need him, Cassandra," the red-haired said. Oh, great. What did they need him for? He doubted they even knew who he was since if they did they would not have acted like they did, not that the lack of reverent looks was not refreshing.</p>
<p>He sighed. "Would you mind explaining to me what's going on?"</p>
<p>"Do you remember what happened?" the red-haired woman asked him instead, completely ignoring his question. Rude.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to tell her that no, he in fact had no idea what was going and neither what they expected of him when a sudden blurry memory popped into his mind and he stilled. With a frown he tried to grab onto this memory teasing him at the edge of his mind. He had never been good at Occulmency but even he would notice the gaping holes in his memories. He still grasped what he could and came up with something that rendered him even more confused.</p>
<p>"Er," he started. "I was some place dark or was it green? I'm not too sure. There were some… creatures of some kind chasing me and – " Here he paused in utter bewilderment. "A woman…?"</p>
<p>"A woman?" The two women shared a look with some hidden meaning that Harry could not make out before the armoured woman, Cassandra addressed her companion.</p>
<p>"Go to the forward camp, Leliana," she told the other. "I will take him to the rift." Well, Harry could not be even more confused than already was. With one last backwards glance at him, Leliana left through the door.</p>
<p>As Cassandra came to him and unlocked the manacles around his wrists, tying his hands together with a thick rope, he asked, "What <em>is</em> going on out there?"</p>
<p>"It… would be easier to show you," she replied a note of hesitation in her voice. Harry followed her out of the dungeons, appearing in a large room lit by candles confirming his suspicions of this place being stuck in a time far less developed technologically than his original world. The soldier opened large door for them and Harry followed Cassandra out where the first thing he could see was snow and could feel was the cold wind.</p>
<p>And then he saw it.</p>
<p>It was gigantic and monstrous in appearance, seeming like a seething, blistering wound in the sky; it was a large hole in the sky through which he could almost make out another world. The magic coming from the hole was angry and unstable; it was the 'thing' he had felt before, the thing that the glowing mark on his hand was somehow linked to.</p>
<p>"There is a hole in the sky," he could not help but state, voice ringing with disbelief. "<em>Why</em> is there a bloody <em>hole</em> in the <em>sky</em>?"</p>
<p>"We call this the Breach," Cassandra explained, turning to regard Harry with a critical eye that he did not notice, too caught up with the whole hole-in-the-sky issue. "It is a massive rift into the world of demons that grows larger with each passing hour. It's not the only such rift, just the largest. All were caused by the explosion at the Conclave. Unless we act the Breach may swallow the world."</p>
<p>Harry grimaced at that. He had already theorised this outcome and hearing this coming from this young mortal woman and feeling all these other lives around him was even worse than he had expected. True, he usually dealt with the dead and the matters of the dead, being the Master of Death and ultimate ruler of the Underworld and all, but he himself had been born mortal and fought a mortal war; he had had mortal worries and had lived a mortal life. As such he could not help but feel sympathy towards those people's plight. Unless he helped in any way he could they were going to die and die horribly at that. The fact that it would prevent him from a new bulk of massive paperwork for the ending of a whole world had only <em>little</em> influence on his decision. Yep, just a little.</p>
<p>A sudden piercing pain brought him to his knees, breaking him from his thoughts. The mark on his hand flared, making him wince.</p>
<p>"Each time the Breach grows, so does the mark on your hand," Cassandra told him as she knelt in front of his curled up form. "It is killing you," she added though this was the least of his worries; nothing could kill him after all. Well, <em>technically</em> nothing could kill him; his physical body in this world might expire but he would only find himself back home in the Underworld. "It may be the key to stopping this but there isn't much time," she added hastily.</p>
<p>Harry blinked his eyes blearily at her, momentarily stunned by the unexpected pain, before he shot a lopsided, wry smile at her. "Well, what are we waiting for then?"</p>
