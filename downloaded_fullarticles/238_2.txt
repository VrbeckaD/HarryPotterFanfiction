</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione forwent going back to Hogwarts after the war. How could she? After all she had witnessed, her contributions to the death and destruction that  took place in its once hallowed halls, notwithstanding, she no longer felt safe within the walls of the ancient castle. Instead she took the Ministry up on testing out and ended her educational career with seven NEWTS and a position in the Ministry as a lawyer representing magical creatures. </p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the fact that she enjoyed her job, something was missing in Hermione’s life but it wasn’t something she could easily put her finger on. She knew she missed her easy, carefree childhood (not that she'd had much of one past age eleven) as well as her parents. Any hope she had of locating her parents died when the last trail led her to California, a previously rented apartment in their names, and no forwarding address. </p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">After the final battle, she and Ron had tried to make it work for all of two weeks, quickly finding that it just wasn't in the cards for them. They were just too different to make a successful go of things and their break-up caused so much tension between them they could not be near one another without an argument starting over the most miniscule things.. Harry, of course, still came by when he wasn't on assignment for the DMLE and they were still as close as siblings could be. He and Ron remained friends but were not as close as they had been before the war.  The catalyst seemed to have been when Ron abandoned them in the middle of winter during their Horcrux hunt since nothing had truly been the same since then. The only other friend she had was Theodore Nott, her former classmate whom she had worked with for almost a year now, Theo being the only other creature lawyer in wizarding Britain.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Two friends, no family, no boyfriend, and a job that paid the bills.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">So, here she was, living alone in a flat above a small bookstore just outside of London. It wasn't much but it was all she needed. One bedroom with a cozy en suite bathroom, a spacious living room that opened to the kitchen, but what sold her on the flat was the set of large bay windows she had eagerly turned into a reading nook complete with large plush cushions and a few blankets. It was small, but it was home. </p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">It was one of her many days off and the only company she was expecting was Theodore Nott who was bringing the new case files by her flat that afternoon. Hermione reasoned that since he (and Harry) already knew her secret, she was able to slip into a different headspace for a while and do the only thing that seemed to relax her these days. </p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">After a cotton candy scented bubble bath, she tied her curls into bunches high on her crown and embellished them with pretty pink ribbons.  Hanging her towel on a nearby hook to dry, Hermione put on her white cotton panties with ruffles lining the bum and her light pink dress with frills cascading down the front and a skirt that poofed out so much her panties were nearly on display. It was her favorite because it had pockets and she could happily store all manner of little goodies in there. After a small twirl in the mirror, she pulled on her white and pink striped knee high cable-knit socks, grabbed her coloring book and crayons, and went to the living room to flop into her pile of stuffies, letting all the tension in her body release with a giant sigh. </p><p>

  </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">The sound of someone coming through the floo caused Hermione to startle awake, bunches askew and her face flushed with sleep. Knowing it was either Theo or Harry, the only two who used her floo connection at all, she did not bother moving but rather reached up to rub her eyes with the hand that wasn't clutching Sir Sickle VonFluff the Third, a stuffed niffler Harry had bought her while they were still in Hogwarts. </p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">"Hey Hermione, I bro..." Theo froze while the sound of the floo igniting filled the room for a second time as he caught sight of Hermione on the floor before him.  The entire room seemed to still as none other than her school yard bully stepped from the flickering green fire and onto the hearth. </p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">"Theo what's going... Oh." Draco had to stop himself from a collision course with Theo's back when he caught sight of Hermione in her frilly pink outfit surrounded by a pile of stuffed animals. </p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione's eyes went wide in fear and her bottom lip began to tremble as she tried gallantly to hold back the rush of tears. </p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Theo stepped towards her slowly, standing tall and after clearing his throat, spoke in a soft but firm voice. "Now, Mia. You know we have work to do today." Her terrified eyes drifted to Draco until Theo cleared his throat once more to get her attention. "Go get changed into your big girl things. We are going to lunch."</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">"B-But..." Hermione began a feeble protest in a voice that very well could have belonged to a field mouse for all the power it contained. As her body shook with fear her eyes swam with tears, fighting desperately to keep them from falling. </p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">"No buts, little one." Theo took another step forward and extended a hand to pull her gently from the floor. "Up you get, go change, I will deal with this."</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Her pace was so frantic that Hermione almost ran from the room, throwing herself into her bedroom trying desperately to keep her tears contained. Draco Malfoy of all people now knew her secret. </p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em> Why did Theo bring him? He is going to make fun of me and tell everyone! </em>
</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">As much as she tried not to, Hermione was unable to stem the flow of tears as they trickled down her cheeks in wide rivulets as she forced herself to remove layer after layer of ruffled safety.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">"What the hell was that Nott?" Draco stared incredulously at the man he’d called his best friend since they were toddlers. </p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Theo sighed and sat on the couch patting the cushion next to him in a bid to get Draco to sit  as he mentally prepared himself to have a conversation he never anticipated . With a dismissive wave of his hand, Draco refused to sit and stood in front of the sandy haired wizard, arms crossed over his chest. </p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">"You will not use this to torment her, Draco, ever. Do you fucking understand me?" The words rolled off of Theo’s tongue like a thunderstorm, thick and low with the promise of danger. </p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">"Yeah? How about telling me exactly what <em>this</em> is first?" Draco threw his hand up gesturing to the pile of stuffed animals where Hermione had been moments before.  He was having an intensely difficult time reconciling the witch he knew from school, the one with the strong right hook who could cast circles around most of their peers, with the one who had sheltered herself amongst a pile of fuzziness in a dress fit for a little girl. </p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Theo’s expression brooked no argument as he attempted to explain. "Hermione is a little. The best way I can think of to describe it is age regression which is essentially when someone  reverts to a younger state of mind. For Hermione, she goes into this odd, completely brilliant toddler type. When that happens, we call her Mia." Theo ran both hands down his face and locked eyes with his friend, blue eyes meeting gray with leveled gaze. "Draco I am serious. You are not going to make her feel bad about this. You know as well as I do that everyone has their own way of coping after the war. You drink, I gamble, and she… she colors and plays with toys."</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">With a shake of his head, Draco finally spoke,"You know I'm not that guy anymore, Theo. If anything, it's kind of adorable, to be honest.”  His shoulders rolled in a shrug while his lip quirked up in a half-smile. “Did you see that dress? She looked like one of the dolls my mother collected before she passed." Draco flopped into the plush armchair arranged by the stuffed animals and picked up the niffler that Hermione had dropped in her haste to get away. "His tail is falling off." Draco observed as he pulled out his wand to fix the toy.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Theo jumped up and stilled his hand, grasping Draco’s wrist firmly before he could cast the spell. </p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">"No magic on that one mate, it's her favorite. Potter got it for her when he first found out." </p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Draco nodded in understanding and gently set the well loved stuffed animal on the top of the pile as they heard Hermione's bedroom door open. </p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">The witch exited her bedroom slowly wearing jeans and a simple t-shirt with her eyes trained on the carpet as she retrieved her handbag from the nearby counter. After a deep fortifying breath, she raised her head and sent an obviously fake smile in Theo’s direction. "How about that new coffee house that opened up a few blocks away? I heard they have wonderful sandwiches."</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Draco stood from the chair in which he was slumped and took a few steps towards the witch, his hands held out in what he hoped was a non-threatening manner. "Granger I-"</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't want to hear it Malfoy. I honestly don't even care why you are here." Hermione grabbed her keys from the hook by her door, purse slung over her shoulder as she turned the handle to make her exit, not even daring a look back at the two men in her living room. "You are buying lunch Theo; it's the least you can do right now."</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Draco and Theo filed out of the door after Hemione who locked and warded her flat before leading the way down the steps and out of the building. </p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">As she walked ahead of the two boys her mind was racing, turning over each thought, each fear with brutal scrutiny. How long would it take until the Prophet let loose a story painting her to be a freak? How long until Malfoy made her wish she wasn't born with a slew of cruel words and crushing criticisms? This was exactly why she kept her secret to herself. She had heard it all before: freak, pervert, even <em>pedophile</em> had made the rounds from those who just didn’t understand. Hermione felt like none of those things when she was alone in her own little world. She felt safe and happy in her frilly dresses and ruffled knickers and that was all that mattered, wasn't it? </p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Theo jogged to catch up with Hermione, placing a hand on her shoulder to stop her from moving farther away from the pair of them.  With a gentle press of his hand, Theo turned her to face him, searching her eyes for any sign of her emotional state. "Hermione, you passed the coffee shop. Are you sure you're ok?"</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Hermione looked up into his blue eyes, tears stinging the backs of her own while her voice trembled, "Y-yeah I'm alright." She cleared her throat and tried again, forcing her mind to slow as she pushed all of the negative thoughts to the side for the moment. "I'm fine, Theo. I just don't want everyone to know that's all."</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Theo wrapped a comforting arm around her shoulders and led her back to the coffee shop. "I spoke with Draco earlier and he won’t say anything. Plus," Theo leaned down to whisper in her ear, a smirk lining his lips, "he said you looked adorable in your dress."</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Coming to the door of the coffee shop, a pretty blush colored Hermione’s cheeks as she realized exactly who was holding the door open for them with no hint of malice in his stormy gray eyes.</p>
