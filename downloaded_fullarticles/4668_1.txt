          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Do you think there are ice rinks in Hades?” Draco asks.</p><p>He’s more quiet today than he usually is, lying back on Harry’s chaise longue like it’s his. Then again, if Harry let himself recall, he’d know it is; if he could remember the day they decided to move in together, how he stood by watching Draco pick furniture to take with him from his half-empty manor house…</p><p>He’d been so full of life, then.</p><p>It’s part of what drove them close. But Harry won’t revisit those memories. He won’t go that far back — those are kept in the banned memories section, the recycle bin; he won’t go in there.</p><p>They’re all memories of things he should never recall, for his own good.</p><p>It’s pointless, isn’t it? Mostly because there’s no future.</p><p>The future, the way Harry sees it, is just the compound of thoughts elaborated by a hyperactive mind who knows nothing, knows no one, who doesn’t even know if tomorrow will be tomorrow or if it’ll be nothing, and nowhere and… and…</p><p>And no one.</p><p>But there’s past. The sad thing is, there’s <em>only </em>past.</p><p>“Hell must have frozen over by now,” Draco says, softly. “A hundred times over…”</p><p>And Harry thinks, even this moment here is past, because everything, everywhere is past and there’s not even present — present is but an instant, a mere second, <em>a moment </em>— and then it’s gone. Another moment; another moment gone. Passed. As in: past tense.</p><p>As in: the past.</p><p>He wonders if Draco still notices these things. Time passing by. He used to pay attention to what Harry did, what his schedule was, where he went, with whom…</p><p>Harry guesses he still does. Or rather, he tells himself he does.</p><p>“Merlin, Harry—” Draco jumps up from his chaise longue and glides over towards him. That’s it, yes. You got it. He <em>glides</em>.</p><p>It almost makes Harry want to snort a laugh, only there’s nothing laughable about this.</p><p>“—dy hell, you’re not even listening to me!”</p><p>“I am.”</p><p>“Are you?” He glares at Harry. “Then you should be saying, ‘You wouldn’t know though, would you?’”</p><p>“I wasn’t—” Harry swallows. “I’d never say… that.”</p><p>“And you’d be right, you know? Because I never. Fucking. Got there.” He raises his arms, as if that gesture could explain the complexity of his existence. Unfortunately, they slide against Harry’s wrist, and Harry can’t help but shudder; he can feel the air chill as it goes through him, a bit like an air-conditioning device, only… gross. “Instead, I got stuck here,” Draco says. “With you.”</p><p><em>Always</em>, they said, but sometimes Harry wonders if Draco loves him still. Even though he can barely touch him, even though more often than not the sheer contact with Draco’s skin — only, ugh, it’s not like <em>real skin </em>— makes him shiver.</p><p>“Would you rather be…” his hand goes right through Draco’s hair when he touches it. He bites his lip, shuddering. <em>Dead</em>, he should say, but every once in a while the word drags through his throat and gets stuck, “… gone?”</p><p>“No.” Draco shakes his head. “Not yet.”</p><p><em>Not yet</em>, that’s what Harry thinks, but he wonders, what will it be of Draco once he’s gone? He smiles, sadly. It’s funny: ages ago, they used to be the same age, far before the… accident.</p><p>If only there were a spell to turn into a ghost.</p><p><em>Should death come for me</em>, he thinks. His life, in one of those old poems.</p></div>
