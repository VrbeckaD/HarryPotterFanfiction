    <p>Severus Snape sat in his favourite armchair in his house at Spinner’s End, nursing a small glass of Firewhiskey as he read the potions journal in his hand, the only light in the room being the flickering fire in the fireplace in front of the armchair, and the light of a lamp that was sitting on the small coffee table next to the armchair. It was late in the evening of the 30th of July 1994, soon it would be morning. He did not know why he could not sleep this night, as he sat there wearing the black Muggle jeans and dark grey t-shirt he had been wearing all day. He wasn’t tired, he didn’t know why, but he figured he would only get changed into pyjamas if he felt like he could sleep. It was as if something was keeping him awake on purpose. He just didn’t know what. <br/>As the clock struck midnight a white light lit up the coffee table next to his armchair and he looked at it, both confused and alarmed. But soon the white light was gone, and a cream coloured envelope held close by a deep green wax stood in its place. He looked at it sceptically, putting down the journal and glass before picking up his wand from the table, next to the letter, and scanning it to see if there were any spells or hexes on it. It was clear of all things he scanned it for, so he put down his wand and picked up the letter, hesitantly. He opened it and pulled out the letter made of three pieces of parchment inside. Unfolding it he recognised the writing on the page almost instantly.<br/>It was Lily’s. Her beautiful, elegant writing on the page. <br/>But she was dead. <br/>She had been for thirteen years, roughly. <br/>So, how had she sent him a letter?<br/>Part of him knew he would find the answers he needed in the letter, so he started reading it. Not knowing that it would change his life.</p>
<p>My dearest Sev, <br/>I know you’re probably wondering a lot of things right now; including how on earth you are reading a letter written by me when I’m supposed to be dead, and why it is you’re not tired. Now you’re probably wondering how I know what you’re thinking. I knew I was going to die alongside James, hoping that my son would survive with the protection I cast on him, and I knew my wishes on how to have him raised, in the event of my death, would not be met, despite me leaving a will. So, I am writing this letter to explain some things to you, things that you need to know, as I know that you would not be told the truth. As to why you’re not tired right now; the last time I saw you in person I put a delayed spell on you to make sure you would not be tired at this time, on the 31st of July 1994, my son’s fourteenth birthday. I put the spell on you, so you would read this and know the truth as soon as possible, then you could save him. I could have made sure this letter reached you before now, but there are people that cannot know that you know what I am about to reveal to you in this letter, at least, not right away. In order for them to not know, I had to give you a few years to establish how you are going to treat Harry in public, at least, before you are allowed to reveal the truth, because throughout this year you are going to have to treat him the same in the public eye, despite what I am going to tell you.<br/>I know you’re probably really confused right now, Sev. Confused as to why I am writing to you about my son. But before you read on I need you to close your eyes, and while holding onto this letter with both hands you need to say revelare verum memorias out loud. When you have done this, and your true memories are returned to you, the rest of the letter will reveal itself and you can read on.</p>
<p>There was no more written, and Severus was confused. But he knew Lily would never lie to him, so if she had told him to do this then it was genuine, and he should do it. <br/>He held the parchment rather tightly in his hands, closed his eyes and took a deep breath before speaking the three Latin words Lily told him to say. <br/>Instantly his mind was filled with images, his true memories. His and Lily’s wedding day when they had only been out of Hogwarts for a month. Their friendship, from the beginning to the day she left him, after obliviating him with a look in her eyes that could only mean that she was being controlled. The day they took the Dark Mark and started properly working for his adoptive father who he only now remembered being as such. He also now remembered that his adoptive father isn’t the Dark Lord people thought him to be.<br/>That was Albus Dumbledore. <br/>He remembered everything. <br/>He opened his eyes, taking deep breaths to control the anger and confusion crawling throughout him. He looked down at the letter in his hands and saw that more writing had appeared. So, he started to read it.</p>
<p>Sev, before I start telling you everything, I am so sorry. I didn’t want to leave you. I didn’t want to obliviate you, Dumbledore was controlling me, but I managed to break through the controls the day I gave birth to Harry, the pain, both the physical and emotional pain, broke it, also the fact that I had just given birth and was no longer pregnant. The pregnancy weakened my defences and I wasn’t able to break through the curse. I would have left James and gone straight back to you, but I couldn’t because I knew you didn’t have your true memories, and I knew Dumbledore would do something worse if I did. I love you, Sev. Always. <br/>I had to stay with James to protect my son. Our son. Sev, Harry is your son. Our son. He’s not James’. The day I obliviated you, that was the day I found out I was pregnant. I was so happy, and I knew you would be as well. I was coming home to tell you, from St Mungo’s. But Dumbledore captured me and took me to his office. I tried to escape, really, I did. But I couldn’t. When I refused to co-operate, he put me under the imperius curse, and since I was pregnant I couldn’t fight it like I usually could, not until I gave birth, but by then I knew I couldn’t show him that it had broken, he would have made it so much worse. He got me to obliviate you and change your old memories into ones that you wouldn’t be happy with. Ones that would hurt you. I am so sorry. <br/>Anyway, when the curse was gone my seer powers came back, as the imperius curse blocked my powers. When I got them back I saw a lot of what would happen. That was how I knew I was going to die, Dumbledore did it, not your father. But I saw past that as well. I knew I had to wait until this time to give you the letter because this would be the year Harry, our son, is in the most danger. You know that Hogwarts is hosting the Tri-wizard tournament. Dumbledore is going to make it, so Harry is a fourth champion so that he will die in one of the tasks. I need you to help him. I need you to help our son, make sure he doesn’t die. I also saw how to bring your father back from what Dumbledore did to him. He took parts of his soul and left them in the objects I have listed. He destroyed your fathers’ soul so much that he turned into a spirit, but I saw how to help him. The information is in the other page, but finish reading this first. <br/>I am writing this on Harry’s first birthday, James and Sirius are off doing something for Dumbledore’s Order, Remus is here, though. Remus and Sirius are being controlled by Dumbledore as well, you need to help them, Sev. They are on our side. Use the counter for the imperius on them, the one we invented together. Harry is having a nap right now, lying on Remus’ chest cuddling his plush wolf to his side. Harry has a glamour on him, to make him look like James with my eyes. That is why he doesn’t look like you, it will break when he gets his creature inheritance. Yes, he is a Dark Veela like you, he will be a submissive, though. And, yes, I know who his mate is, but I’m not going to tell you. I think you will like who it is, though. <br/>I would have made sure this letter reached you sooner than this if I could have Sev, believe me, I would have. I know how much you wanted a family, wanted children. But it would have been suspicious before now if you were to take him, it still will be, but now is the time Harry needs you the most. And I needed you to show people that you didn’t like him, so that Dumbledore wouldn’t be suspicious. That is how you need to act towards him, in public, all this year. When he gains his creature inheritance, then you can tell everyone. But right now, I need you to save our son from my sister’s house. That is where Dumbledore has been keeping him all these years. He hasn’t been spoiled or loved. He’s being abused, Sev. I did write a will, stating who Harry could go to after I die, but Dumbledore ignored it. But this summer it is worse, he is in a bad shape right now, a very bad shape. I need you to save him and heal him as soon as you are done reading this. Her address is 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. Save him. <br/>That is the truth about Harry out of the way. Now, Dumbledore has all of the staff at Hogwarts, except you, under the imperius curse so they only teach what he wants students to learn and he can control them. You need to save them. They know how bad he really is, they know more than I do, they try to fight it, but they can’t. If they manage to break it, he puts it on them twice as strong as the last. There is a recipe for a potion that will save them from ever being put under that spell again, give it to Remus and Sirius too, after using the counter spell on them all, the potion is only to make sure they won’t ever be under the effects of the spell again, you should probably give yourself, everyone on our side, and our son some too. You can’t trust anyone in the Order who isn’t an Auror, Remus, Sirius, or a staff member at Hogwarts. Moody, Shacklebolt, and Nymphadora Tonks (a metamorphmagus, who doesn’t like her first name, and who has joined the Order which is still running just in case your father comes back) are all under the imperius curse. Save them and give them the potion, too. <br/>Harry can’t trust his friends. When I say that I mean Ronald Weasley, Hermione Granger, Ginny Weasley, Percy Weasley, Seamus Finnegan, Lavender Brown, the Patil twins, Oliver Wood, Angelina Johnson, Katie Bell, Molly and Arthur Weasley. The other Weasley’s are true friends to Harry and will leave their family when they find out everything they are doing to Harry, this includes stealing money from the trust vault I made for Harry to get him through his Hogwarts years, as well as the Potter vaults, trying to get Harry to fall in love with Ginny, marry her and get her pregnant before killing him, feeding him a number of potions which you have all the antidotes to but you will need to run a full diagnostic to see which ones you will need, and more. Neville Longbottom and Dean Thomas are true friends to Harry, and Harry will make friends with others as well, from all of the houses. <br/>Sev, that is all I can tell you now. Save our son, look after him, love him. I am sorry for everything that has happened. I am sorry I couldn’t tell you the truth sooner. Bring your father back. Prepare Harry for his inheritance, and for the tournament, and everything else. I will be sending you another letter on his next birthday to explain some more. Harry needs to try and remain friends with Ron, Hermione and the others, only for another year, though. He just has to pretend. But he can become friends with others, in secret. Tell him he can use the Room of Requirement for meeting his true friends, tell him where it is. Tell him to form an organisation, one like your fathers’ group, filled with these friends, the ones loyal to him. This way you have more people working with you and your father within the school. Help the teachers, the Aurors, Remus and Sirius. Help our son, love our son. <br/>I love you Sev. <br/>Always. <br/>Lily. </p>
<p>Severus stared at the parchment in shock. He had a son. A son who he had been horrible to for the last three years. A son that was being abused. <br/>That thought was enough to make Severus jump out of the chair and apparate to the address Lily wrote in the letter, his wand in his hand. He soon stood outside the house, all the lights were off inside, so he could tell they were all asleep. <br/>He knocked on the door of the house rather loudly, not caring if he annoyed them since they had been hurting his son. The protective instincts a Dark Veela has for their children were filling him with rage at the thought of his son being hurt. <br/>He saw a light turn on inside the house and heard someone stomping down the stairs, complaining the whole way about someone knocking on the door at this time of the night. He could have let himself in, but he wanted to torment the people that had hurt his son. He knew Lily was a seer, so he knew what she saw was correct. <br/>The door was wrenched open by a man who was so overweight he looked like a walrus. <br/>“What the hell do you think you’re doing knocking on our door at this time of the night?” The man almost yelled. <br/>Severus growled at him. “Where is my son?” <br/>“I don’t know who your son is, but he is not here.” The man spat out. <br/>“So, Harry Potter is not your nephew who happens to be living under this roof?”<br/>“You’re one of those… freaks? How dare you come here?”<br/>“I dare because my son is here, and I know what you’ve been doing to him. So, I suggest you let me in before your neighbours find out exactly what has been going on inside this home and I do something I won’t regret.” Severus snarled, pointing his wand at the man. <br/>“Vernon, who is it?” Petunia asked, wandering down the stairs. She paused when she saw Severus at the door with a wand pointed at her husband. “YOU!” She exclaimed. <br/>“Hello Tuney, have you missed me?” Severus greeted sarcastically, causing Petunia to sputter from shock and fear. Vernon looked shocked that his wife knew a wizard. “Now will you let me in and tell me where my son is?”<br/>“He isn’t here, he is with friends.” Vernon lied. <br/>“Don’t lie! Now tell me where he really is, and I will leave with him, you won’t ever have to see him again. In fact, when my father finds out how you have been treating his grandson I am sure he will delight in helping me punish you both, and your son, for everything you have done to my son, maybe I will get you both sent to Azkaban after we have had our fun torturing you. In fact, I am sure there will be a lot of other witches and wizards who would delight in joining us on the task as well. Tell me where he is!” Severus said, getting ready to cast some kind of hex on the man in front of him. <br/>“He’s u-upstairs.” Vernon stuttered, scared at the thought of what angry wizards could do to him and his normal family. <br/>Severus pushed past the man and made his way up the stairs, sneering at Petunia as he passed her. He knew that the door with seven locks on was the one his son was in, it had to be, they wouldn’t lock their own son in a room. His heightened senses, due to him being a Veela, also told him that his son was in there, he could smell his son, and his blood, sweat, vomit and urine. That just made him angrier. <br/>“Alohomora.” He whispered, pointing his wand at the door. The locks all unlocked, and he slowly opened the door, not wanting to scare his son. He turned the light on.<br/>The sight in the room made him angrier than anything he had ever seen before. His son was laying on his stomach, on the floor in the middle of the small room. He was lying in a pool of his own blood, sweat, vomit and urine. The smell was horrible. He noticed that the oversized t-shirt his son was wearing had rips in it and was soaked in blood. He saw that his son’s owl was locked in her cage, she was skinny, and her feathers weren’t the same brilliant white that they used to be. He fed her some water using the aguamenti spell before he unlocked her cage. She flew out, landing next to Harry, who was unconscious, and nipping his ear affectionately. <br/>“Go to Riddle Manor, we will meet you there.” Severus said as he opened the window for the bird. She flew to him, nipped his ear and left, soaring out of view. <br/>He rushed to his sons’ side and knelt next to him, running a hand through the black, messy hair causing his son to groan and open his eyes. <br/>When Harry saw Severus, he looked shocked. <br/>“P’fessor, what you doing here?” He groaned through the pain he was feeling.<br/>“I’m here to save you. I will explain more later, I promise. I need to pick you up, so I can take you home. It will hurt but I will be able to fix you up soon. Your owl has already left to where we are going to. I gave her some water, so she should be okay for a little while. I will feed her when she arrives at the Manor.”<br/>Harry, who was still shocked that his potions professor would actually save him, nodded once before groaning.<br/>Snape, as gently as he could, turned Harry over so that he was on his back. The movement caused Harry to cry out in pain as tears finally leaked from his eyes. <br/>“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. You’ll be out of here soon and I will start fixing you up as soon as we get home. I promise.” Harry was shocked at the gentleness in Snape’s voice. “I’m going to pick you up now, Harry. It’s going to hurt but I promise you will be okay soon.”<br/>He picked Harry up, like he would a baby, as gently as he could. It caused Harry to cry out again, the sound of his son in pain broke his heart and increased the anger in him towards the Dursley’s. He was also shocked at how light his son was, at how little he weighed and how small he was in size. How had he never noticed these things?<br/>“It’s okay, Harry. It’s all going to be okay. Now, I’m going to apparate you to the Manor, okay? It may hurt but you have to stay as still as possible or it will cause even more injuries. You may feel sick afterwards, but I will get you an anti-nausea potion as soon as possible, okay?” Severus informed his son so that Harry knew what was going to happen. <br/>Harry nodded once, clinging to Snape’s top, feeling an odd sense of safety in the man’s arms. Harry closed his eyes and Severus apparated them to the entrance hall of Riddle Manor, knowing only him and his father would have been able to apparate inside of the home and that no one was there. No one had been there since ‘Voldemort’ died.<br/>Severus could tell that his son was feeling sick so he accioed an anti-nausea potion and fed it to his son. <br/>“Thanks.” Harry whispered as he felt the effects of the potion, his throat hoarse.<br/>Severus nodded and carried his son up the stairs, slow enough to not jostle him too much, but fast enough so he could help his son as soon as possible. <br/>“Why are you being so kind to me? You hate me?” Harry questioned quietly. <br/>Severus felt a pang of pain as he heard the question. “I’ll explain later, when you’re not in so much pain and I have had the chance to heal some of your injuries.” <br/>Harry just nodded his head once and fell asleep again. Severus carried him to the room that was next to the one that used to be his and Lily’s, wanting his son close by. He flicked his wand, causing the covers on the large bed to be drawn back and he gently laid Harry in the bed. He accioed his healing kit and got to work. The more he saw of his sons’ injuries the more he wanted to kill the Dursley’s. And Dumbledore for sending him there in the first place, as well as everything else he had done, including taking Lily away from him and then killing her. <br/>The diagnostic report that showed Harry’s full medical history, as well as who his parents are (Severus and Lily’s names came up in that section) made him want to murder the people that had hurt his son even more. He was severely underweight. Dehydrated. He had been whipped since he was three. He had suffered multiple broken bones, some of which hadn’t mended properly. They had tried to drown him multiple times. His illnesses had never been treated properly. He has had multiple concussions. He has been burnt multiple times. He had been… raped… multiple times since he was twelve. And that is all without the injuries he had sustained at Hogwarts. And that is without all of the compulsion potions, loyalty potions, intelligence hindering potions which meant he was only about half as intelligent as he was meant to be, magical core blocking potions which meant he only had 50% of the magical power he is meant to have at this stage of life, which would be due to rise when he receives his inheritance. If he was so powerful already with only 50% of his magic then his son was incredibly powerful, and he will be even more powerful this time next year. Thankfully Severus had the antidotes to each of the potions, even the magical core blocking one, and he administered them all. He was excited to see how powerful his son really was. <br/>It took all he had to not leave the Manor and go kill the muggles who had done this to his child. And Dumbledore. And the Weasley’s. And Granger. And whoever else had ever hurt him. He wished he could go back in time and stop Dumbledore cursing Lily, then they could have raised their son together. She wouldn’t have died. He would have known he was a father. <br/>When he was done, he conjured a comfortable, black, leather armchair next to the bed and sat on it, watching his son sleep and hoping that he would be okay. Hoping that they would be okay. Hoping that the people that hurt him would pay for what they did. And hoping that the world would be a better place to live in soon, and that the true Dark Lord would lose.</p>
