    <p align="left">It was then that it all shattered forever.</p><p align="justify">It had been a gradual process; this whole year, up until the summer holidays in his home, and even before, when an owl came bearing the late news of his father's arrest, it had creeped up on him ever since, that sense of dread had descended upon him and had not parted with him ever since, hadn't it? And now it made its way inside him, coursing through him and making him tremble with terror at what had happened, making him tremble with the shock of how brutally he had been ripped away from all that was his childhood. </p><p align="justify">As Draco watched the broken figure of the headmaster falling past the balustrade, horror struck him and the awful realisation fell upon him: Dumbledore was dead. He had not truly felt it, up until now, how the headmaster had been part of Hogwarts as Draco had known it.</p><p align="justify">Now that he stood at the end, the truth he had been burying all year, all summer long resurfaced, searing him with all the strength and energy he had spared covering it up and denying it, searing him as it made its way to the forefront of his mind; He had known he would fail, and he had never wanted this mission. He had never wanted to be <em>chosen</em>. So many times, so many times, he had repeated the word '<em>chosen</em>' like a protective charm, to calm him and reaffirm his resolve. Each of his failures had fractured it, reminding him of the truth galloping back at him, until he had stood there, in the Astronomy Tower, and barely any of it had crawled to him, not enough, not nearly enough to steady his wand and mind and cast the curse. </p><p align="justify">He felt a hand seizing him by the collar, the gesture urgent and hurried, and as he obeyed the pressure, he saw Professor Snape rallying the others, him alongside them and bidding them leave the castle at once. And so he followed. This was still where he belonged, wasn't it? With his family? And with these... people. Except as he thought of it, nothing but disgust crawled to him, pooling in his stomach. He had never liked any of them, had never wanted their help or company. It had felt grand, at first, all these ancient names seemingly coming alive from all the stories and rumors, joining his life and walking by his side. The Lestranges were almost revered in his house, one, sister to his mother, the other an old friend of his father, he had continuously heard of them growing up, and now...</p><p align="justify">He looked back to Bellatrix, running rampant and giggling almost hysterically, and it felt like something in him was collapsing further, as if he had been emptied of all consistency as he watched the crazed witch wreck the Great Hall. Glass shattered and shards flew in all directions, chairs and seats collapsed onto tables which cracked irregularly in their center, leaving them wobbling and broken, and finally he saw the great hourglasses of each house break open, the vibrant emerald of Slytherin scattering upon the floor and mixing with the flow of rubies, sapphires and diamonds. In disgust and horror, he sighted Greyback speeding to the flood of precious gems and rashly picking a handful of them before shoving them in a pocket. </p><p align="justify">"Draco, hurry!"</p><p align="justify">Exerting pressure on his arm, this time, Professor Snape pushed him forward, his eyes tearing away from the ignoble theft and from Bellatrix stomping on the Ravenclaw's table, from the Hall in which he had shared so much with others since he had entered Hogwarts, from the place that had been a second home. And so he followed along still. Where was he to go if he did not return to his family? What would Father say when he'd return home? And worst of all... What would <em>he</em> say? Would he simply flick his wand lazily, and hush him out of existence?</p><p align="justify">They had stepped past the entrance now, and he heard, he heard him call. </p><p align="justify">It was<em> Potter</em>. </p><p align="justify">Draco no longer knew what to think of him. From the depths of the loss he was feeling, everything else he had felt had been extinguished. He remembered the beginning of his school year, the vicious anger he had felt at his father's imprisonment, all his vengeance plans and his ideas of triumph over Harry. But when he tilted his head to look back on the person who he thought was his nemesis, the conflicted animosity he had always felt had been emptied out of him. </p><p align="justify">"Snape! He trusted you!"</p><p align="justify">And suddenly, ripping through him, he felt a sharp pang of longing. He wished for nothing more than to turn around, turn back, leave the Death Eaters, join all the students that would remain behind to mourn Dumbledore and crowd about his body and huddle together at the sight. Never before had he felt such a thin connection to the dark witches and wizards he was escaping the school grounds with, and never before had he thought so clearly that this was not his world. He did not belong with any of them. But in his mind's eye, he saw a pair of red eyes staring at him coldly, and with great effort, he tore his gaze away from Harry running at them.</p><p align="justify">There was a loud "<em>Bang!</em>" and turning around, Draco saw flames leaping onto the vaulted, pitch-black sky; Hagrid's hut had caught flames. For an instant, a hundred spiteful things came to mind, a hundred insults he had been throwing around for years, yet somehow, for the first time too, the words wouldn't pass his lips. He watched as Death Eaters sneered at the sight of the burning hut and Bellatrix dancing around it, hysterical sounds of glee still streaming out of her. He remembered his third year and the Hippogriff business and how elated he had been; Father had given him a slim smile and patted him on the shoulder, thanking Draco for bringing the matter to his attention and how swiftly the whole affair would be dealt with. Draco had beamed brightly, he remembered, he had felt a sense of pride he couldn't contain.</p><p align="justify">All he could feel now was revulsion at the sight of the Death Eaters and their enjoyment. He turned away and kept on.</p><p align="justify">Professor Snape pushed him before turning back and parrying hexes coming at him, and Draco reluctantly continued his helpless run, joining back the other Death Eaters scurrying away. He couldn't help glancing behind him, his longing slowing his steps and distracting him, and suddenly Bellatrix had waved her wand, a malicious grin upon her lips and Harry was groaning in visible agony, tossing and turning on the grass.</p><p align="justify">Draco almost lunched himself at her, he wanted to shout "<em>No!</em>" at Bellatrix, to tell her to stop! He had almost started at her, when the pair of red eyes blurred back to his mind and he froze mid-motion. Before Draco could have done anything, <em>at least that, if nothing else</em>, he thought, Professor Snape had already ended the curse with a vigorous flick of his wand.</p><p align="justify">"No!" Professor Snape yelled, anger plain on his face, "He belongs to the Dark Lord!"</p><p align="justify">And in a blur, they had all reached the gates of Hogwarts. Draco's stomach sunk further inside him, fear ran through him uncontrolled at the prospect of what would surely come to pass soon enough, and his horror intensified as they stepped outside the school grounds. He felt a firm pressure against his wrist, and with one final look upon the school he had loved, sunk into suffocating darkness.</p><p align="center"> — ✦ —</p><p align="justify">The walls of his home seemed blank, now.</p><p align="justify">It was the house he had spent his life in, the place that had shaped him, but now, all the joy he had known within these walls had been sucked out, replaced by this slithering figure calling Draco's home his headquarter, robbing him of the shards of his childhood and adolescence as he walked by, condescension aimed at the damage he caused with every step, with every piercing glare. </p><p align="justify">Still in a frightened daze, Draco saw his mother rush at him, her hands reach his face and peer anxiously at him, and he could see in her eyes the voiceless question forming; Had he done it? He could do nothing more but return her gaze passively, and so she glanced at Snape for answers.</p><p align="justify">"It is done," announced Snape. </p><p align="justify">Her eyes followed him as he walked further within the house, black cloak billowing behind him, and his mother hands dropped to his wrist, grabbing his hand as she followed after Snape. Bellatrix came to place herself at his mother's side, but his mother hardly paid any attention to her sister, and her eyes remained intently fixed against Snape's back.</p><p align="justify">The moment they had Apparated in front of the portal of his home, Snape had rolled his sleeve and pressed the tip of his wand against the Dark Mark, and as it had turned jet black, Draco had felt his inner forearm sear in pain. Stones had sunk inside his stomach, the moment was coming, he knew it.</p><p align="justify">It was not long until a tall, skeletally thin figure appeared in their great dining room led by Bellatrix, and Draco glimpsed the pair of red eyes he had so dreaded. His eyes immediately fell to the floor... yet something else was in the room, the sound of something heavy gliding against the floorboard reached him, and he tilted his head, avoiding the snake altogether as well, as if a single glance would petrify him.</p><p align="justify">"Ah, well done, Severus."</p><p align="justify">The voice had hissed in the room, almost a whisper. He heard, more than he saw, the figure glide almost like his snake did towards Snape.</p><p align="justify">"You honour me, My Lord," The words he spoke did not fit his intonation, somehow.</p><p align="justify">Then the figure was gliding again, this time in a more deliberate, almost leisured way. And Draco's dread intensified, as he understood that figure was advancing towards him.</p><p align="justify">"I do wish I could say the same of you, Draco." </p><p align="justify">Almost immediately, Draco regained a more dignified posture, yet try he did, his gaze refused to meet the Dark Lord's. The atmosphere had become opaque, tense, as if the very air had frozen. He could not think of what he could say, and before he could muster any words, the Dark Lord continued, "A shame, truly. I had such high hopes for you... What might poor Lucius say, once he is out of Azkaban?"</p><p align="justify">The blow seemed to implode within him. From scrapes of memories and conversations with his mother, he dredged up what little he could; "I will not fail you again, My Lord."</p><p align="justify">"I expect not," His tone might have been clear and silent as a whisper, Draco still could hear the nigh imperceptible menacing inflection, sending an ominous warning his way; "<em>If you do, I will end you.</em>" Draco swallowed hard, his gaze still resolutely upon the ground.</p><p align="justify">Once again, as the Dark Lord gave empty congratulations to Snape, it dawned on Draco how he had never cared, not truly. All these stories he had heard, these fantasies of wizards recapturing their rightful place in the hierarchy, triumphing over muggles, these non-magical people who in their ignoble ways had forced wizards into hiding. All this so-called glory, all his father's stories were blurry inside his mind, he tried to summon them to examine what he had found so captivating back then, but nothing came to manifeste the excitement he had once. What had he rejoiced over? Again, he looked back, forced the memories back, and all he could remember, was himself, seated on his father's lap and hearing about days which had taken place before his birth, days where his father was at his height, and all Draco could picture was himself, a qualified wizard at last standing side by side to his father, vested in the colors of the house they had both been in, both covered in glory and united in their goal.</p><p align="justify">His throat tightened and his eyes burned, and all the memories could choke him if he continued to reminisce.</p><p align="justify"> </p>
