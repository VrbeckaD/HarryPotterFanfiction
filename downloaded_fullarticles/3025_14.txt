    <p>Deidara woke up. Relief spread over him until he realized he was not in his body. He couldn't see anything except darkness and couldn't move. Where was he?

He got bored easily though and pushed at his conscious trying to do anything. He soon felt rage at not being able to do anything!</p><p>
