    <p>The battle was over and they had won. It was hours and hours later, now. Ginny couldn’t know how many, but she was bone weary and tired.</p>
<p>She had dozed fitfully, first on her mother’s shoulder in the Great Hall, and then somehow she had found herself in the Gryffindor common room, dozing in a wide armchair. She didn’t know how she got there; she couldn’t recall the trek through the halls and up the stairs. She couldn’t remember eating anything, or if she’d spoken to anyone. Her mind was numb. All she saw were faces of the friends she had lost, and Fred, swimming through her mind’s eye. All she really heard were their voices, playing over and over again in her head, mingled with the sounds of the battle.</p>
<p>Ginny was vaguely aware of her family somewhere in the room with her, but she didn’t know how many of them were there--just that Fred wasn’t. And she could distantly hear the familiar voices of fellow or former Gryffindors--Neville with his grandmother, Dean and Seamus, Demelza, and someone she thought might be Angelina, maybe Alicia. But she was keenly aware that there were several missing.</p>
<p>Out of the corner of Ginny’s eye, she saw Hermione emerge from the boys’ staircase, looking like she’d just woken up. She couldn’t muster up the energy to make a comment as she would have normally and she felt a pang at the comment that didn’t come from George, and would never come from Fred.</p>
<p>A lump was beginning to form in her throat, but she fought it down, not quite ready to give in to her grief yet. She wanted to feel nothing, to keep feeling nothing, to wrap herself in this numbness for as long as possible because the alternative would hurt too much.</p>
<p>Ron came down shortly after and went straight to where Hermione and their mother were talking.</p>
<p>It took a few minutes before Ginny realized her gaze had shifted back to the bottom of the boys’ staircase. And then another before she admitted to herself that she was waiting for the last person to come down, waiting for Harry. Just as she always had. Ginny wondered if she would always be waiting for him.</p>
<p>Ginny dozed off again before he came down.</p>
<p>It was dark in the common room when she awoke. The dying fire in the grate and the nearly full moon shining through the window were the only sources of light. Someone had lain a blanket over her where she was still curled in the armchair. In the dim light, Ginny saw lumps on the floor that she could only assume were her family and others who needed a place to sleep, curled inside cushy sleeping bags.</p>
<p>Ginny moved her head from where it was resting, and with a start saw that someone was sitting opposite her. Her heart slowed from a furious hammering to a quick flutter when she recognized the silhouette, even after all these months. Harry was sitting on the sofa across from her, knees pulled to his chest, chin resting on them as he stared into the dying fire.</p>
<p>Ginny stretched her neck and readjusted herself, still looking at him.</p>
<p>Harry lifted his head toward her, alert to her movement. She didn’t say anything. Neither did he. Even with several feet between them, Ginny sensed him tense as he noticed she was awake and that she had noticed him. Was he nervous?</p>
<p>Ginny couldn’t take her eyes off his face.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was this that triggered it, him being just steps from her, close enough to touch if she wanted to.</p>
<p>Before Ginny knew what was happening, before she could stop herself, there were tears rolling down her face. She sniffed, trying to stem the flow, but that only seemed to make it worse. With her next breath she was sobbing.</p>
<p>Harry was on his feet and crouching in front of her in less than a second, the quick flash of his silencing charm barely noticeable. In another moment, his hands were cradling her face and his thumbs were on her cheeks, repeatedly wiping away the wetness there. She clutched at his wrists, a silent entreaty to stay close. His bright green eyes searched hers with worry and Ginny’s face crumpled with more tears.</p>
<p>“Ginny....” His voice was strained, tired, but she could hear the emotion in it, the longing to know what he could do to help her.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you’re actually here,” she said around the large lump in her throat. Her voice was thick with tears and it was all she could manage before she let everything spill out of her--all the worry for him and Ron and Hermione, all the frustration at being left behind, the unfairness of the Carrows, the loss of some of her closest friends and brother, the relief that he was <em>here</em> and it was <em>over</em>.</p>
<p>He pulled her tightly to him and she fisted her hands into the front of his shirt, clinging to him as if her life depended on feeling him solidly against her. Hot tears washed down her cheeks onto Harry’s neck and shoulder, drenching the collar of his shirt as she pulled raspy breaths into her lungs, whole body shaking as she breathed out. He shifted them so they were both squashed in the chair together, as close as they could physically get in that moment, no matter the discomfort.</p>
<p>Ginny didn’t know how long she cried for, but Harry’s presence was like a balm. He held her tight, murmuring things in her ear, expecting nothing of her. She felt safe, wrapped in his arms, safer than she had felt in nearly a year.</p>
<p>Eventually the tears slowed, her breathing calmed, punctured by the occasional hiccup and shuddering breath. She felt lighter, though her eyes were gritty and there was a pressure in her head she knew wasn’t going away anytime soon. She wiped her nose on her sleeve, knowing it was gross, but she couldn’t bring herself to care.</p>
<p>Harry was still. Ginny lifted her head and met his eyes, glimmers of green and amber in the firelight. He lifted a hand to her face, brushing hair from her forehead and away from where it had stuck to her cheek from her tears. His eyes searched hers, but neither said a word. Ginny hiccuped, feeling like she could cry all over again at the tenderness she saw in his expression; it was such a relief after the past year, to have him here with her and know that there was nothing standing between them anymore.</p>
<p>She rested her head on his shoulder again, and closed her eyes, content for now with the silence. There was plenty of time to talk later. She felt herself drifting off again with the comforting weight of Harry’s arms around her and the sound of his slow, deep breathing beneath her ear. The scent of him brought her back to long, peaceful hours spent by the lake. He rested his chin against the top of her head and let out a deep sigh, shifting slightly to get more comfortable. She might have imagined it, or dreamed it, but she thought she felt the ghost of a kiss brush across her forehead. She was asleep before she could think more about it.</p>
<p>And so they slept - cramped in a tiny chair, and wrapped around each other so tightly, as if neither would ever let go again - until the sun blazed orange and bright through the window the next morning.</p>
