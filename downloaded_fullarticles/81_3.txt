    <p>Hey all! Emily here! So I'm sure we're all bored as hell while the whole world is under quarantine from the corona virus; I know I sure am. As such, I am taking after one of my favourite authors on this site, @Bergen, and I have decided to create a book that is entirely decided by you guys! I have a ton of free time, so comment a short story you want to see, and I will write it! Hopefully this will give me something fun to write, and give you something fun to read! Please give me your wants and needs; anything you desire is fair game, unless it includes anything inappropriate (underage sex, anything pornographic, etc). And it needs to be in the MCU or Harry Potter universes. So... have at it! I look forward to receiving your requests!Â </p>
