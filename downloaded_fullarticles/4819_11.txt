</center><p>Hermione stood wearily to her feet.  Between them, she and Ginny had finally managed to soothe the hysterical Molly, Ginny having forced a Calming Draught down her mum’s throat.  She was now safely ensconced in Arthur’s arms.  Hermione looked away from the spot where Percy’s still body lay, surrounded by his brothers.  She felt her eyes welling and quickly took a few calming breaths.  There was still much to be done, others to assist or comfort.  </p><p>She moved aside as another body was laid onto the flagstones.  Her hand flew to her mouth when she saw the head of hair, although the features had been mauled beyond recognition.  She had last seen Lavender collapsed in the Entrance Hall, after the brutal attack by Greyback.  A sob escaped and suddenly, it was all too much.</p><p>Before she quite realized, she was running across the front courtyard, her tears blurring her path.</p><p>She stumbled and fought to regain her balance, having bumped against someone and ricocheted to one side.  She hadn’t yet found her bearings to apologize when an angry, all-too-familiar voice shouted, “Watch where you—I should have known you’d somehow manage to escape, Mudblood!  <i>Stupefy!</i>  Wh—Ow!  Clytemnestra’s clit!”</p><p>Her reflexes had kicked in and her Shield Charm had returned the spell to its caster.  She’d also added a Jelly-Legs Jinx, so Malfoy landed hard on his back.  His wand had clattered away, but she magically retrieved it and now stood over him, her wand pointed at his heart.</p><p>“You won’t get away with this,” Draco snarled breathlessly.  He began rolling up his left sleeve but stuttered in disbelief when he revealed a bare forearm.  He gaped but then glared up at her.  “What are you playing at, Mudblood?  <i>Mmmphhh!</i>”</p><p>“You are wandless, Malfoy, and it seems I’ve called your bluff,” she said through gritted teeth.  “So, I’d suggest you learn some manners.  I’ll leave you to your contemplations.  You can retrieve your wand from the Aurors, assuming they’ll give it back.”</p><p>She marched toward the castle but was slammed to a halt by an invisible barrier.  Furious, she tried to circumvent it but, after several minutes, managed only to figure out its perimeter.  They were trapped within a box-like structure roughly fifteen by fifteen feet.  </p><p>Striding back to the supine form of Malfoy, she knelt and ripped the gag from his mouth, demanding, “What are you playing at, you sodding Slytherin scum!  Tell me what spell you used or so help me…”</p><p>“Believe me, Mud—” He choked when the tip of Hermione’s wand pressed lightly against his throat. “Granger, if I wanted to construct a magical trap for you, would I be found inside it?”</p><p>Hermione huffed, unable to deny the logic.  She moved to the spot she deemed furthest away from the loathsome prat and sat with her back against the barrier.  She cast a few sparks, but to her dismay, they hit an invisible ceiling and bounced about the sides before dissipating. She sighed.  Attempting to ignore his temporarily motionless person, she looked about and was astonished to realize that this was where Harry and Voldemort had had their duel.  The shrivelled husk of the enemy was nowhere in sight.  She wracked her brain but couldn’t recall seeing it among the dead in the Great Hall.  </p><p>She pressed her hand against the barrier and decided it felt like the Shield Charm.  Had Harry’s protective spell somehow enclosed this space?  But what was there to protect?  And how had she been able to stumble across its boundary?</p><p>Sudden footsteps made her jump up and be on guard.  There were students scattering about the courtyard, still intent on retrieving the bodies of the fallen.  Even though she knew it unlikely they could hear her, she nonetheless called out for help and noticed they did not react.  One of them came close to one of the corners of her entrapment but seemed to unconsciously veer off, as if avoiding the space.  <i>Great,</i> she thought, <i>there’s some sort of repelling charm, too. </i> She sat back down and wondered if she’d ever escape. <i> If only I had my DA Galleon.</i>  </p><p>A movement and scuffling had her head snap up to see Malfoy on all fours moving toward the edge of the barrier and getting into a sitting position facing her.  </p><p>They stared at one another across the empty space.</p><p>Finally unable to stand the awkward silence, Hermione said, “What were you doing in the courtyard, Malfoy...before all this?”</p><p>“Patrolling,” he said tersely.  But as if the question could no longer be contained, he blurted, “How did you manage to escape from Dolohov’s watch?”</p><p>Hermione frowned.  “Dolohov is dead.  One of the Aurors <i>Avada</i>’d him.”</p><p>Draco scowled.  “That’s impossible!  We rounded up the Aurors, those still alive, that is, and locked them in the dungeons.”</p><p>“But that’s not—”  She paused as a tiny suspicion sparked.  “What is the date, Malfoy?”</p><p>“Did you hit your head when they threw you into the Great Hall?  It’s obviously April 19, 1998.”</p><p>“I’m not suffering a concussion, thanks for your concern.  In my world, it’s May 2, 1998.”</p><p>“What do you mean ‘your world’?”</p><p>“Is Voldemort alive or dead?”</p><p>Draco hissed.  “How dare you speak the Dark Lord’s name, you filthy M—”  But he paused and looked about expectantly.  When nothing happened, he refocussed on her and said in a slower and more deadly tone.  “What do you mean ‘your world’?”</p><p>“Harry defeated Voldemort in my world.  I assume he’s dead in yours.”</p><p>Draco gaped.  A sudden thought had him scrambling to his feet and looking carefully at the environment beyond the barrier.  When he finally sat down again, he stared at the ground, lost in thought.</p><p>Having finally wrapped his mind around his new reality, he looked up.  “How did I get here?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>He cocked his head to the side.  “What is your guess?”</p><p>Hermione blinked.  “Well, I think the duel between the Harrys and Voldemorts in both our worlds unleashed a wave of power once one wand overpowered the other.  I think there was enough energy to cause a tear in the fabric of space-time, creating a wormhole that brought you here.  And I guess there’s enough residual magic in the surroundings that the barrier was created to contain the rip in the continuum.”</p><p>Draco stared at her blankly.  He recovered and said, “In plain-speak, if you please.”</p><p>“Oh, sorry, you wouldn’t know about quantum theory and black holes and such.  Um… it has been postulated by some modern Muggle astronomers” —She gave him a look of challenge but his hackles didn’t rise. —“that there are in fact multiple universes that exist simultaneously.  They call them parallel universes or the multiverse as a whole.  I’m not entirely certain, but I think I read that it’s impossible—or at least very unlikely—for people to travel between these universes.  But I guess you are proof otherwise.”</p><p>Draco struggled to find words.  Eventually, he said, “I see.  Of all the ways I thought I might die during the battle, this was not one of them.”</p><p>“We don’t know that we’ll be trapped here forever!  I’m sure Harry and Ron will notice I’m missing and do a search.  <i>Someone’s</i> bound to realize that there’s a repelling charm around this space.” </p><p>“<i>There’s a repelling</i>—”  He took several breaths, tilting his head back and closing his eyes.  Having decided to be practical, he made eye contact once more.  “Would your civility extend to conjuring a fire?  Here, you can use these.”  He threw a package of matches toward the centre of the space.</p><p>Hermione recovered from her surprise and headed toward the spot where the matches lay.  She enlarged the package sufficiently and soon had a cheerful fire going.  She then extended his wand, handle toward his direction.  His eyes widened but he did not hesitate to step toward the fire to receive it.  He nodded his thanks and, in a show of good faith, halved and Transfigured a handkerchief into two sleeping bags before tucking his wand into his arm holster.</p><p>Hermione smiled as she tucked herself inside her sleeping bag.</p><p>As they both lay staring at the dancing flames, a thought occurred to Hermione.  “Malfoy, why do you carry matches?  Why not just conjure flames?”</p><p>Pain flitted across his face, and it was with some reluctance that he replied, “I’d gotten hold of my father’s wand when I was very young, and the first thing I got it to emit were flames.  I burned myself rather badly.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m so sorry!  I hope there wasn’t any lasting damage?”</p><p>“No, but since then, I’ve preferred to light a fire without a wand.”</p><p>“I understand.  So, how do you acquire the matches?  I don’t suppose they’re more commonly used in your wizarding world than in this one.”</p><p>“I-I don’t know.  I’ve always found a ready supply in my room.”</p><p>Hermione couldn’t suppress a smile.  When she didn’t tease him about being privileged, he relaxed slightly.  </p><p>“Granger, may I ask… you didn’t seem as surprised about this area between the worlds as I was.”</p><p>“Oh, well, I’d been reading some books my cousin recommended—she’s an astrophysicist.  Before I got my Hogwarts letter, we talked about studying the sciences together.”  At his expression, she said, “I’m sorry, I should explain: science is a branch of knowledge focussed on discovering how every aspect of the universe works, from the stars to how life began.  Anyway, so the idea of a multiverse is something that’s been on my mind, even though I don’t really understand all the theories behind it.  And, well, I know a little bit about magical time-travel, so a kind of combination of the two doesn’t seem so outlandish, I suppose.”</p><p>“I see.  I don’t suppose your books discussed how one might liberate oneself from the confines of this place?”</p><p>“Afraid not.  Though if we do ever get out, I intend to look into it.”  Lulled by the warmth and comfort, a yawn escaped her.  “I’m sorry, Malfoy.  I don’t think I can keep awake much longer.  If you don’t mind, I’ll say ‘goodnight’.”</p><p>“Goodnight, Granger.”  He waited until she closed her eyes before following suit with a sigh.</p><p>It seemed she had only dozed off when Hermione was rudely shaken awake.  “Hermione, what in blazes are you doing sleeping out here?  And where have you been?  We’ve been looking all over the castle for you!”</p><p>Looking up blearily, Hermione saw a Ginny’s anxious face hovering closest, with Harry and Ron’s faces also peering down.  She got up groggily and immediately noticed that the other sleeping bag was missing.  The only other evidence that she had neither dreamed nor hallucinated last night’s conversation were the ashes from the fire she’d lit.   </p><p>Making up her mind that she didn’t feel up to recounting her fantastical story just yet, she said, “I needed some air.  I guess I was so tired at some point that I just decided to sleep wherever I stopped.  I don’t really remember how I ended up here.”</p><p>Ginny sighed.  “Well, I guess we were all tired and recovering from the shock of it all.  Better get you inside.  The breakfast things are almost all gone.  C’mon.”</p><p>Hermione returned the sleeping bag to its original form, tucked it into her pocket, and followed her friends back into the castle.</p>
