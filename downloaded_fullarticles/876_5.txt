          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco was absolutely thrilled, as in over-the-mountains, completely out-of-his-mind, thrilled. Nimbus 2001 abandoned on the grass of the Hogwart’s Quidditch pitch, he was practically dancing on the spot, snitch fluttering slightly in his palm.</p>
<p>“I caught the snitch before you! I <em>actually caught it</em>!” His grin was beyond huge, his eyes lit up, normally impeccable hair forgotten as he jumped up and down.</p>
<p>Harry grinned back at him, strangely enchanted by the sudden exuberance from a normally reserved person.</p>
<p>Draco suddenly stopped and glared at him. “If you let me catch it on purpose, I’m going to murder you.”</p>
<p>The Savior of the Wizarding World shook his head. “I didn’t do anything. It was all you.”</p>
<p>The grin was back, and the blonde was back to jumping around ecstatically. “I caught it before you! I beat the Boy Who Lived! I’m so happy I could <em>kiss</em> you right now!”</p>
<p>“Oi!” Ron’s voice broke into their conversation, and a hastily muttered Protego stopped Draco from approaching. “None of that!”</p>
<p>Harry crossed his arms across his chest and turned to glare at his best friend. “Ron.”</p>
<p>“What! He was going to molest you!”</p>
<p>“And your point is?”</p>
<p>“Wait… you mean… you want…?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“You like…?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Ron fainted.</p>
<p>Draco kissed Harry.</p></div>
