<p> </p>
<p>Just after Ginny's 17th birthday, she and Harry realized they were not soulmates. Her heart broke in two, but she knew how important it was to him that he find his true mate.</p>
<p>"My parents had that and I... I just want the kind of love they had, y'know? I thought it would be as simple as theirs, matching patroni and all," he said with a shrug, "but, my soulmate... I can hear her in my head." Ginny nodded, eyes bloodshot and full of tears, but she understood. "You'll find yours too, Ginny. I know you will."</p>
<p>Ginny returned to Hogwarts and completed her year with all five N.E.W.T.s, thrilling her parents with her exceptional grades. Those results allowed her to intern in four different positions at the Ministry. She’d started at the Transportation Department, but quickly grew bored of signing portkeys out to travelers. Ginny tried the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, but the paperwork gave her daily headaches and she transferred after only eight weeks. She almost stayed with the Department of Magical Games and Sports, her eye gleaming at the idea of working in the Quidditch office, but in the beginning of December, the Head made it clear that there would be no openings for another decade.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With the excitement of the new year, and new millenium, Ginny vowed to follow her heart. Before joining her friends for a New Year’s Eve party at Grimmauld Place, she would tell her parents of her plans for a new career - one she would struggle with financially, but Ginny knew she’d find true happiness and freedom within.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That conversation was why Ginny found herself on the steps of Grimmauld Place wiping tears from her swollen eyes. After a screaming row with her mum, she just couldn’t stay there anymore. She Disapparated from the Burrow with a hastily packed bag now tucked under her arm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She knocked on the door, stifling a sob at how the sound echoed in her chest. Her heart was broken and she could feel a next round of tears coming on. Not wanting to break down in the street, she knocked again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The door swung open immediately, revealing the smiling face of her ex-boyfriend. “Ginny! Happy Almost New-” Harry’s face fell at her expression and concern filling his eyes, “What’s wrong?” Her face scrunched at the roaring emotions within her and she burst into a fresh round of tears. “Come in, come in,” Harry said, ushering her inside.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The conversations between the party-goers instantly silenced at her arrival. As her tears flowed, all of their friends gathered to the pair as Harry led her to the couch.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Blurry vision allowed her to make out the sight of Neville, Hermione, Luna, Dean, and Ron, though she knew there were even more in attendance. A pale hand thrust a tumbler of whiskey into hers, “This’ll help,” said an Irish voice that could only belong to Seamus.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ginny tried to calm herself, embarrassed at the distraction her distress was bringing to the party. “I’m so sorry,” she whispered, hiding her face from the crowd with a curtain of red hair. “I shouldn’t’ve come.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry gave a comforting rub on her back, “No, it's fine, Ginny. Tell me what happened.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She shook her head, “No, I just… let me freshen up. I’ll t-tell you later. Please.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Luna settled on her knees in front of Ginny, peering up at her inside the curtain she’d created. “Let’s go to the loo, Ginny. We’ll get you cleaned up and free from all these piggleplasts that nested in your gut.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ginny cracked a smile and nodded, taking Luna’s proffered hand and disappearing up the stairs. The girls washed her face and changed her into more suitable party clothes, even placing a light glamour on her to hide any remaining signs of the so-called ‘piggleplasts’ that supposedly ravaged inside of her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ready?” Luna asked, offering her hand once more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ginny gave a small sigh and attempted to steel herself for the barrage of questions that awaited downstairs. “You go ahead, Lulu. Let them know I’m fine and I don’t want to discuss it right now, so to pretend nothing happened at all. Is that...okay?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The blonde gave a reassuring smile and went downstairs. Needing a few more minutes to herself, Ginny lifted herself onto the sink’s ledge and calmed her nervous stomach. Her fingers itched to put her emotions into art, but she settled on closing her eyes and imagining what she would paint in the coming days instead - <em>if </em>Harry allowed her to move in. The break-up had been a clean one, cordial even, but Ginny was still unsure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The door opened and the surprised face of Remus blushed, “I’m so sorry, Ginevra, I didn’t know you were- I’m sorry.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No, it’s alright. I’m just,” her voice faltered, but she forced a smile and jumped off the sink, “I’m done. The loo’s yours, Professor.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus’ eyebrows furrowed, reading the emotions she gave off but not wanting to push her. “Just came to brush my teeth, actually.” He reached around her and picked up a purple toothbrush, “Don’t eat the quiche Hermione brought,” he whispered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ginny laughed, “Thanks, I’ll keep that in mind.” Straightening the skirt of her black party dress, she stayed with her former professor as he did something so ritualistic that it gave her comfort. “Bit surprised to see you here, actually. I thought all of the ‘<em>adults</em>’ wanted to keep away from us and whatever ruckus we caused tonight.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus chuckled as he put the toothpaste on the bristles, “I considered it, but someone has to save you all from alcohol poisoning. I had plenty of practice with James and Sirius and - well, I had plenty of practice.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ginny gave a sad smile and leaned against the doorframe, crossing her arms to block the emotions that War Chat often brought on. “Right, I’m sure you were completely innocent in all of those instances as well, then, sir?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He choked on the toothpaste as a laugh forced it down his throat. Cleaning himself up, he returned the toothpaste to its place and wiped his hands on a flannel. “Completely and utterly innocent, Ginevra.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She scrunched her nose, “Just Ginny, please.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Just Remus, then.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Fine.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Fine.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They stood in the loo, forming a new kind of friendship between them. “Alright <em>Remus</em>,” she enunciated, “Seems I need a chaperone to the alcohol, please.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“My pleasure,” he said with a chuckle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-----</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As promised, Luna told the partygoers to leave Ginny alone and, to her surprise, they complied. The evening was full of laughter, food, and an overindulgence of alcohol. With each second leaning towards the new year, Remus kept his eye on the young adults and ensured they didn’t get too naughty. At 11:45, he confiscated everyone’s wand to avoid drunken pranks or slurred incantations. He also kept an extra eye on Ron, who was entirely too far gone for how early it was in the party. Since there were so many people, everyone began to give light kisses at five-til and made their way around the room. Padma was kissing everyone’s cheeks twice. Luna offered unsolicited advice on the kinds of kisses that should be given based on their auras. But Remus was shocked when Ginny, with her ninth tumbler of whiskey, gave each partygoer a single, chaste kiss on the mouth, though she stealthily avoided her brothers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Seamus accepted his kiss with a triumphant “Yeah!” and refilled her glass with a heavy hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Th<em>aaaaaa</em>nk you, Shay. Oh th<em>aaaaaaaaaaaa</em>nk yo<em>uuuuuuuuu,</em>” she slurred, lifting the tumbler to her lips and taking a large gulp.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Alright, Ginny,” Remus said, holding her elbow, “Perhaps we should take a break from the Firewhiskey, eh?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh Perfeser, don’ be a spoilerspurt.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>It’s almost time!” </em>Harry’s voice shouted. “Ten!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ginny gave a dramatic gasp, covering her mouth with a manicured hand, “Oh Remmis. I haven’ givened you a kiss yet!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Six!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"No, Ginny, that's- that's quite alright."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"But tradition!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh, no no…”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>Three</em>!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yus yus!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Two!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I really don’t think-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“One!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“C’mere!” she shouted gleefully, grabbing the collar of his shirt and pulling his lips to hers. Remus tried not to react to her drunken kiss, but found his mouth instantly puckering at the contact. The pungent smell of alcohol wafted into his nose and he held her elbows to keep her steady. The other people had all begun cheering for the New Year, pulling leftover Christmas crackers for the festive sparks and hats. Ginny still hadn’t ended the kiss, and though Remus enjoyed the contact, he pulled himself from her liplock.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her bright brown eyes opened, a joyful smile spreading on her face. “Happy New Year, Perfessor!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Oh, please don’t kiss me and then call me </em>Professor <em>immediately after. That’s just..</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ginny raised her glass in the air, “Churrs! To a hectic year of unemployed-ment!” She lifted the glass to her swollen lips and swallowed the contents in one gulp.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Wait, what?” Remus asked, “You’re unemployed?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yep!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What- How?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Quit!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>Why</em>?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ginny cackled, “Hated it! I wanna paint. Oh please can I paint you, Remmis? Pleeeeeeeeease!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We should get you some water, Ginny.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What? Nooo. Blech!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus led her to an overstuffed chair in the corner and sat her down. “I’ll go get you some water and then we can talk about your new career path, okay?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Noo Remmis please! No water!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He sighed, “Fine, I’ll bring you some… vodka, okay? Nice, clear-colored vodka?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“But I’m drinking <em>whiskey!” </em>she shouted with enthusiasm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes, everyone can see, hear, and smell that, Ginny. But the vodka will trick your organs into thinking it’s water, alright?” he lied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh, smart.” Ginny patted his arm, “You’re so smart, Pr’fessor. Such a good ‘fessor, too.” Her eyes began to droop and her arm grew heavy, barely moving from his at all. “Smart, smart ‘fessor.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Right, thank you, Ginny. Stay here, alright?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Mmm. Kayyyy.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-----</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus helped escort people to the Floo, ensuring their enunciation and cleaning up most of the party debris. Ginny remained in the overstuffed chair for the rest of the evening.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-----</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1 January, 2000. 4 o'clock pm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I was so miserable, Harry. I couldn’t take the monotony; I just want to paint,” she rubbed her forehead as the pain of her row came flooding back. “I have some savings! I can pay rent and- and-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ginny, stop. Please, listen to me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her brown eyes met his, silent pleas for mercy on her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Of course you can move in. But… you should know something…”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry’s lip was caught between his teeth - a sign she recognized as worry. “I’m moving out. I already signed the papers for a flat with..." his voice drifted, sparing Ginny the reminder of his own soulmate, "well, I leave in two days.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What? Why? You have Grimmauld…”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry shook his head, “It’s too depressing, Ginny. I just keep looking for Sirius, wanting so badly for him to be here.” A scarred finger pushed the glasses up his nose, “Remus will still be here and I’ll still visit loads. So will Hermione and Ron. You can stay as long as you want. Use your savings for food and your art supplies.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ginny smiled through tearful eyes, “Thank you, Harry,” she whispered. “I swear I’ll pay you back some day.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Standing to his full height, Harry pulled her to join him in a hug. “Maybe this is my way of paying <em>you </em>back.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her arms embraced him for a moment, but her confusion won out. “Pay <em>me</em> back? For what?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His thumb wiped a stray tear from her cheek, “For not being your soulmate.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ginny turned, not wanting him to see any emotions on their break-up. “That wasn’t your fault, Harry. It’s not your fault.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I wish it had been you, Ginny.” Her pale hand covered her mouth to keep the sobs from escaping. “Why couldn’t it be you?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She sniffled loudly, “Please stop. Don’t break my heart again.” She couldn’t see him nodding sadly, but he offered a kiss to the top of her head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Paint me a picture, eh?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
