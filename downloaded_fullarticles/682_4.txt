    <p>Half dead but living, somehow still living, his three closest friends kneel before him.</p>
<p><br/> He has always been meticulous in his work and he is meticulous in his relationships too. Favors must be returned with favors. Devotion must be repaid with trust. The give-and-take currency so intrinsic to Slytherin House threaded through his brain long ago and never left. Rending his soul asunder has distanced him irreparably from his emotions. Even dying and clawing his way back to life however has not blemished this principle.</p>
<p><br/> Bellatrix, Rodolphus and Rabastan Lestrange searched for him desperately after his fall, fought unflinchingly as their enemies surrounded them and chose prison rather than spite his name. They endured there, suffering fourteen years in the dementors' nest until he returned. Their pain is written clear across their faces, pooled in gaunt cheeks and skeletal limbs. Robes shrunken tight to fit their starved bodies still hang baggily from sharp shoulders. Nevertheless, they look to him now with joy, not a tint of resentment in their dark, adoring eyes.</p>
<p><br/> So, he will reward them.</p>
<p><br/> Voldemort leans back in the armchair, watching the firelight cast flickering shadows over his followers. Nagini coils loosely about his shoulders like a serpentine shawl, her tongue flitting out to taste the air. The three Lestranges wait silently, oddly. Not one of them attempts to begin the conversation even though they know exactly why they are here. It is unlike them. He tilts his head to one side.</p>
<p><br/> “Beyond reproach,” he says quietly, the snapping fire augmenting the hiss of his voice. “That is the status you three have earned. When I was flung into the abyss, when I clung to my last shreds of life, you refused to abandon me. The pain I suffered is the same as your pain.” He nods quietly to himself. “You need never doubt your standing in our Family again. There is no mistake you could commit that I won‘t forgive. No matter what comes, you will lend yourselves fully to my cause. You have proven it. Tell me, my favorite friends, speak. What boon may I grant you to repay your selfless and unfailing devotion?”</p>
<p><br/> Bellatrix’s dark eyes flit quickly up to his face but fall again. He watches her closely, seeing her lips close on a bitten-off word. She says nothing, hesitating, and it is completely unlike the Bella he knows. Surely she has already decided what she wants. Surely she dreamed it up years in advance. The brothers would know too but it is their habit to let Bella speak for them.</p>
<p><br/> Instead, she stares tensely down at the floor.</p>
<p><br/> Voldemort cannot read their minds, a fact that frustrates him in his idle moments. He taught them Occlumency long ago. Considering the amount of secrets he entrusts them with, mental defense is a necessity. He is not the only powerful Legilimens in the world. Dumbledore himself has quite the talent for stealing stray thoughts. The Lestranges however have always picked up his lessons prodigiously; their minds are utterly impenetrable.</p>
<p><br/> All three of them Occlude in their <em>sleep</em>.</p>
<p><br/> He knows because he has stood over them, carding fingers through their hair, spelling them unconscious and positioning them like dolls. He has drawn them close, cold and unfeeling, wondering to himself, <em>‘what is a family like…?’</em></p>
<p><br/> He could spend weeks trying to break into their minds and still reap no fruit. If he wants to know why they are so reluctant to make a request of him, he will have to rely on conjecture.</p>
<p><br/> “Come now,” he coaxes gently, trying to remember how to make his voice seem warm, “speak your desires. There is nothing to fear.”</p>
<p><br/> “My lord,” and to his surprise, it is Rodolphus who starts. “You honor us deeply. Any reward you deem fit will satisfy us all. Our request however, if you find it worthy, is of a personal nature.”</p>
<p><br/> Bellatrix is still staring at the floor. Voldemort notices curiously that she seems to be holding her breath. Rodolphus continues.</p>
<p><br/> “I married late in life and only because I met Bellatrix,” he says, his eyes misting slightly with recollection. “She wanted to fight. The fight wanted her. A husband who wished her to remain at home, birthing and tending the next generation of pureblood children would have been unsuitable.”</p>
<p><br/> “I remember,” Voldemort nodded. “I was the one who suggested her to you. You did, after all, work so well together…”</p>
<p><br/> Rescuing Bellatrix from the domestic lifestyle her parents expected her to follow was in his best interests. She is the most skillful duelist he has and she was even back then.</p>
<p><br/> “The three of us could not be happier,” Rodolphus returns soberly. “Still…the initial dilemma of my family remains, even after all these years. My brother and I cannot sire magical children. Our blood…has grown too weak.”</p>
<p><br/> “And I’ve told you, Rod,” says Voldemort, “that it cannot be cured.”</p>
<p><br/> They have gone over this before. He narrows his eyes slightly. Azkaban has had its adverse effects but surely Rodolphus would not waste his time demanding the impossible.</p>
<p><br/> “Yes, my lord,” Rodolphus agrees quickly and now he is faltering. Whatever momentum he mustered earlier seems to fizzle and fade away. He blinks, looking absent from his gaunt face. Then he glances at Bellatrix; she does not move. Emaciated as her body is, her knees must ache but she does not so much as twitch.</p>
<p><br/> The firelight flickers in the shadowy room, hisses and pops from the embers punctuating the silence.</p>
<p><br/> “We do not seek a cure, master,” Rabastan says then.</p>
<p><br/> The brothers are close, even with Rodolphus being ten years younger. Rabastan went to school with Voldemort; they killed the Lestrange’s mad uncle together. It is one of the few childhood recollections Voldemort still recounts with fondness. Nevertheless, Rabastan’s role is a protective one. He picks up the conversation when Rodolphus cannot carry it.</p>
<p><br/> “A cure is not necessary. We seek only a child,” he finishes, his voice barely a breath. “Yours, master.”</p>
<p><br/> Distantly, in some faraway room that has rotted and fallen apart, Voldemort feels a jolt of surprise. This is the very last thing he has thought to expect. He assumed they would ask him for immortality; he has seriously considered granting it to them. After all, followers like this, whom he has put decades into training and who would never betray him, are pricelessly rare. If they had but one horcrux each, if he kept those horcruxes himself to protect and control, surely it would not undermine him. But <em>this…?</em> An heir, a child?</p>
<p><br/> Separated from himself, he can only sit in his chair and stare impassively down at them. His gaze falls on Bella again; she flinches. The courage necessary to make this appeal alone must be staggering; he understands now why the Lestranges falter, why they look terrified by their own words, why they can barely lift their eyes from the floor.</p>
<p><br/> Why shouldn’t they fear? The request is insolence personified.</p>
<p><br/> Voldemort closes his eyes, trying to decide if he is furious, perplexed or amused. He taps one sharp, white finger on the chair’s arm. He leans his head back. “You wish me to be…a surrogate?”</p>
<p><br/> “…Yes, master,” says Rabastan haltingly. “The mother…the mother, of course, would be Bellatrix.”</p>
<p><br/> “I see.” Voldemort is silent for a moment, turning these words over. “And how long ago, pray tell, did the three of you cook this up?”</p>
<p><br/> Their petrified silence is an answer all of its own. He sighs.</p>
<p><br/> It stands to figure that the pureblood elite of Wizarding Society would be chiefly concerned with blood. They must have been aiming for this all along, since even before Harry Potter, the Prophecy and Azkaban.</p>
<p><br/> “Is that what I am to you then?” he inquires. It is difficult to remember how through the fog but he lowers his voice, molds his features into something wounded. The next words he speaks sound hurt. “Has that been your scheme since we first met? To acquire the Slytherin line? To join it with yours and possess it? Am I a tool to feed your ambitions?”</p>
<p><br/> Horror crashes into the three Lestranges like a tangible wave. They blanch, cringing back away from his chair.</p>
<p><br/> “No, master!” Bellatrix chokes, speaking for the first time. “Never!” Mortified tears are welling in her eyes, a flush on her hollow cheeks. Rodolphus has scrunched his eyes shut. Rabastan is desperately shaking his head.</p>
<p><br/> In that single instant, Voldemort decides he is, in fact, fiercely and intensely amused.</p>
<p><br/> Naturally, he milks the game for all that it is worth.</p>
<p><br/> “I came to you in the name of friendship,” he marvels in a betrayed tone of voice. “I placed myself before you, sincerely and openly, to honor our shared toils. This is how you respond? Making a grab for my own flesh? Objectifying my very genetics like they are a prize to snatch in your greedy claws?”</p>
<p><br/> In less than a minute, he has all three of them sobbing into the carpet. The Lestranges rasp out apologies, nearly incoherent with the force of their distress. Bellatrix has started to hyperventilate, nearly gagging on hysterical breaths. Her manic fits have gotten worse since Azkaban and anxiety undoes her just as thoroughly. She presses one spindly hand to her mouth, wild dark hair falling in her face. Her entire body trembles, rattling with each violent gasp. It is a riveting sight. Voldemort studies her at his leisure, then each brother in turn. None of them dare to look back at him. None of them see the sadistic fondness in the twist of his thin mouth.</p>
<p><br/> He did not miss them. In his semi-existence, suspended between life and death, he completely forgot how entertaining they are. Now he wants to croon to them, drag them up by the hair and hold their faces in his hands. This is why they are his favorites, his absolute favorites. The world is infested with wretched, ignorant, tedious minds but these three are treasures.</p>
<p><br/> “There, there, now,” he soothes the weeping Death Eaters. He stands silently, pulling Rod and Bastan up by the elbows and steering them over to nearby chairs. For Bella, he summons a Calming Draught and kneels beside her on the floor. He knows her condition and at this point, the potion is really the only thing that can help. He bats her hand away from her mouth, tipping her head back with a grip on her hair. He pours the potion down her throat, watching her eyes grow dark and glassy. He can see his twin reflections in them, flickering with the firelight. He is a black silhouette edged in flame.</p>
<p><br/> When she sags, he scoops her body up in his arms and deposits her on a divan. She weighs less than a child. She weighs less than Nagini where the snake curls on his shoulders.</p>
<p><br/> “Calm yourselves, my dear friends,” Voldemort tells them gently. It is easier now, pretending to be affectionate. They have reminded him how to do it. “I am so sorry that I misunderstood. You would never think of me in such a way. Not you, my most trusted and true.”</p>
<p><br/> The Lestranges settle at his words, their panic ebbing. “Thank you, master,” says Rabastan brokenly, his voice rough with relief, “thank you.”</p>
<p><br/> Rodolphus and Bellatrix manage to express similar sentiments though they are too shaken to offer more than a couple words. The husband and wife are clumsily dashing tears from their eyes.</p>
<p><br/> Voldemort nods and turns to the fire, standing with his back to them. Nagini’s dry hide brushes against his cheek as she lifts her head.</p>
<p><br/> “My friends,” he tells them, feeling their hungry stares behind them, “I will grant your request.” He waits, savoring their stunned intakes of breath, the way the air grows taut with suspense. “On three conditions, mind you.”</p>
<p><br/> “<em>Anything</em>, master,” Bellatrix blurts, her tongue nearly tripping over the words. “Please.”</p>
<p><br/> “Master, you are kind and benevolent,” Rodolphus babbles, “this means the world to us…”</p>
<p><br/> “We’ll do whatever you wish, my lord,” says Rabastan.</p>
<p><br/> “It needn’t be your doing,” Voldemort tells them, casting a dismissive hand through the air. “I’m sure our work will bring us to the right point, sooner or later. Nevertheless, a child is a vulnerability. A child is something enemies exploit to destroy morale. We must not give our enemies a way to strike at our hearts. That is why, until Dumbledore is dead, there can be no baby.”</p>
<p><br/> “My lord, I shall rip his heart out myself-” Bella begins but he turns on her sharply.</p>
<p><br/> “You will attack if and <em>only </em>if I command it,” he hisses.</p>
<p><br/> She shrinks. “Yes, my lord, of course. Forgive me.”</p>
<p><br/> “The second condition,” Voldemort continues easily as though there had been no interruption, “is Bellatrix’s health. You have been out of Azkaban for scarcely a month. Pregnancy now might kill you; your body is too frail. Maternity aside, you are a critical element of my military strength. I cannot spare you for long. You will most likely have to fight during the first two trimesters. With this in mind, I must instruct you to devote yourself to recovery.” He turns back to the fire. “You must stop forgetting to eat, forgetting your potions…”</p>
<p><br/> “I won’t forget, master,” she pledges fervently.</p>
<p><br/> “Good girl,” he murmurs. He goes and seats himself again, raking his gaze once over Bella and the brothers. They look completely revived, eyes shining with near-euphoric happiness. The furniture they sit in is too big for their emaciated bodies. He expects the upholstery to swallow them whole until only splinters of them are showing. Still, the amount of emotion they are able to project dominates the room.</p>
<p><br/> His sinister shadows and firelight are nothing to the Lestranges’ aura of joy. It is late at night but he would not be surprised if birds began rapturously singing. Rainbows and sunshine would not be entirely out of the question either.</p>
<p><br/> “The last condition,” he tells them idly, grazing his knuckles against Nagini’s head, “concerns the child itself. Bellatrix, you are well versed in the Dark Arts. I assume you know the power a witch has during her pregnancy to shape the child’s fate...”</p>
<p><br/> “Certainly,” Bella assures him avidly. He is not surprised by her answer; she is a Black and her family is the sort to know these old rituals.</p>
<p><br/> “My blood is steeped with ambition,” Voldemort tells her, “but the thought of being pitted against my own kith is intolerable. A son, I fear, is far too likely to attempt to surpass me. Instead, bear me a daughter, Bella. Let her share the devotion you have always upheld for your family…” His voice grows even softer, “and in appearance, bid her to take after you.”</p>
<p><br/> If the baby girl ends up looking like Riddle <em>too</em>, he will have to rip off her face. He does not want that. He would rather like to be a good father, one who protects, provides for and teaches his child. He is not anything like that filthy, wretched muggle who left him to starve in a dilapidated orphanage during a depression, during an influx of refugees and the second World War. No, if anything, Voldemort thinks he ought to try and be the best father he can be.</p>
<p><br/> His child will have the best mother and uncles he can think of. There are no people better suited than the Lestranges are. Bellatrix, Rodolphus and Rabastan are the closest things to perfect the Wizarding World can offer. Pureblooded, powerful, clever and wealthy- yes, they will certainly suffice. It is not a bad arrangement. Being immortal, he does not need an heir; if he is to father a child however, this is clearly the optimal way.</p>
<p><br/> It could be an interesting experience.</p>
<p><br/> “It will be as you say, master,” Bellatrix breathes, her voice a haunting whisper that lingers in his memory for years after.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>o0O0o</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is only a year and a half later that Dumbledore very obligingly falls over and dies. Voldemort supposes he has Severus to thank but the entire situation seems whimsical. Sending his Death Eaters into Hogwarts accomplished little more than waylaying the other professors on staff. Draco Malfoy failed to redeem his family’s honor, lacking the guts to mutter a simple killing curse. Dumbledore was on death’s door long before Severus’s spell extinguished him; the potion’s master claims to have poisoned him discretely several hours previous. It is over and done with.</p>
<p><br/> It is anticlimactic.</p>
<p><br/> In regard to Draco, Voldemort is torn. The boy’s regrettable psyche can easily be blamed on Narcissa and Lucius’s unfettered pampering. With Bellatrix always spoiling Narcissa and Abraxas spoiling Lucius, it only stands to reason that they would make dreadful parents. Still, the damage is not irreparable. Mentoring from the Lestranges has already made the boy an excellent Occlumens and he is not half bad with charms either. Perhaps a bit of field work can salvage him, do away with that squeamish aversion to violence. He will give the boy a chance, for Bella’s sake if not for Draco’s.</p>
<p><br/> Lucius, on the other hand, can rot in Azkaban.</p>
<p><br/> In the meantime, the general mood among the Death Eaters is celebratory. They have infiltrated the Ministry. They have all but crushed the Order of the Phoenix. The great Albus Dumbledore is dead. Voldemort is still slightly irked about losing the prophecy but how important can it be? The boy, Harry Potter, is a laughable obstacle at best. He will kill him with someone else’s wand, avoid the duel of phoenix cores, and the boy will be dead before autumn.</p>
<p><br/> In the meantime, he has a promise to keep.</p>
<p><br/> Voldemort is asexual. This is not to say he is intimidated by sex. He is, in fact, completely scornful of it. Sex is instant gratification, a carnal and repetitive waste of time that improves neither self nor standing. It owns the minds of foolish men, making them weak to trickery. The lusts of simpletons have destroyed career after career, caused scandal after scandal. Being wanted is power and wanting is weakness. The parasitic sycophants who tried to manipulate him with it in the past failed because he is immune. He is strong where mortal men are pathetic.</p>
<p><br/> He does not care how pretty a witch is if she has ugly, vapid eyes and pointless, insipid thoughts. What is the difference between a vacant-headed brat and a cow?</p>
<p><br/> He is not a virgin however. In his youth, his peers found him attractive. Tom Riddle’s handsome face was one of the few resources he possessed. He dated older girls or wealthier girls in exchange for valuable books stolen from their pureblood fathers’ studies. He spewed sweet lies, servicing their very hearts for as long as he was obliged to. He went to their beds in exchange for political favors and alliances.</p>
<p><br/> It was excruciatingly, mind-numbingly <em>dull</em>.</p>
<p><br/> They bored him. They bored him so entirely that he wanted to strangle them to death just to be rid of their presence. The only way he managed to put on a convincing performance between the sheets was to picture gouging out their eyes. It was a delight when he finally gained enough power to avoid that sort of bargain. After Hogwarts, he did not need their help any longer. He was not forced to listen to hours of thoughtless prattle, shrill voices squealing for his attention. He was at no one’s disposal. By that point in time, everyone who mattered was already at his.</p>
<p><br/> What joy does he reap from life then? Voldemort indulges in higher pleasures exclusively. A favorite is warping his Death Eaters psychologically one by one until they are simultaneously terrified of and besotted with him. Another is ripping the mind of an enemy apart with Legilimency. A third is delving deeper into the mysteries of magic, bending it to his beck and call. A fourth is simply accomplishing his goals, the intricate strategies of conquest spinning delightfully in his brain.</p>
<p><br/> People who cannot experience these pleasures themselves simply lack the necessary power, will and intellect.</p>
<p><br/> Voldemort believes all of these things with conviction. Nevertheless, there is a need for the act because the Lestranges desire his child. He will impregnate Bellatrix then. It will not take long. In this situation, he possesses all of the control; if he orders her out of his room immediately after it is done, she will comply. If she is troublesome about it, he will control her. There is no need to waste time indulging or pleasing her because pleasure is not the point. Pragmatism reigns here and he likes that just fine.</p>
<p><br/> That night, he brews an aphrodisiac potion in a small cauldron on his desk. Potion making is usually too tedious to bother with but he is proficient nonetheless. Getting one from Severus would let Severus in on the secret- and a child is far too dangerous of a secret to share. He supposes he could always tell Severus that he and Bella are having an affair- perhaps even implying something humorous liking going behind Rodolphus’s back- but Severus wouldn’t believe it. The potions master is generally sensible about idiocies such as romance, something Voldemort appreciates. There was only that one questionable instance with Harry Potter’s mudblood mother.</p>
<p><br/> Voldemort dismisses his musings and bottles the potion. He will take it if he needs it. Bella is one of the least boring people he knows but the action itself is so uninteresting, he won’t blame her if she fails utterly to appeal to him.</p>
<p><br/> Deeper in his quarters, Nagini slinks over the back of a chair.</p>
<p><br/> <em> I’m cold,</em> she hisses softly.</p>
<p><br/> Those words are perhaps the most affectionate snakes ever utter. Born entirely self-sufficient from the moment they hatch from their shell, serpents never evolved to feel fondness. They have no need for it. They do however, covet heat intensely. To Voldemort, who has always understood the speech of snakes, the words ‘I’m cold’ mean ‘I wish to embrace you.’</p>
<p><br/> He is distracted though and he does not much care. <em>“I have work after this. Perhaps you can curl around Bella once I finish with her. Or you can go downstairs and keep Rod company while his wife is away.”</em></p>
<p><br/> Nagini hisses in displeasure and slithers off.</p>
<p><br/> She weaves out the chamber door as it swings open, past Bellatrix’s black skirts and out into the corridor. The witch herself steps into the room.</p>
<p><br/> Bella is indeed looking healthier than she did a year past. Her curly hair has started to shine again. Her cheeks are not so hollow. She still looks terribly thin but not emaciated, surely. She has also dressed up. She wears a flowing black gown with a boat-neck collar, long translucent sleeves spinning down to her wrists. There are black pearls on her neck and gleaming in her pinned-up hair. There is a fine tremble in her hands. Her large black eyes dart everywhere and touch everything but him. She lingers at the threshold.</p>
<p><br/> “Come in,” he tells her.</p>
<p><br/> Bella starts a little, turning and closing the door. She skulks closer by a few steps before stopping again. The fire in the hearth is the only light he has lit. It illuminates her pallid face, casting the rest of her in shadow.</p>
<p><br/> “You took the potions?” he inquires, referring to a number of concoctions designed to improve fertility. They are both young enough as far as witches and wizards go but she is forty-seven and still recovering from Azkaban.</p>
<p><br/> Bella opens her mouth to say ‘yes, my lord’ but no sound comes out. She settles for nodding mutely. The tremble in her is violent now, her throat fluttering as she tries to calm her breaths. He strays closer, brushing his knuckles over the back of her cheek. She startles, eyes darting to his face then half closing. She leans into his touch as if starved for it- but she does not move.</p>
<p><br/> “Hush now, Bella,” he soothes her, remembering the context, stepping closer still. “Do you think that I would harm you? There is nothing to fear.”</p>
<p><br/> There are tears in her eyes now. Even in the dim light, he can see a dozen emotions on her pretty face, some of them conflicting. Terror and want, caution and daring, worship and things he cannot name all war in her. She is such a complicated little thing. She is as cunning and ambitious as any Slytherin should be but she looked for him when he perished. She searched for him when all the others turned away.</p>
<p><br/> He has told his Death Eaters since the beginning to be faithful but even he does not understand exactly why she would obey. He failed to kill Potter. He made a critical mistake. Betraying him would have only been the logical choice. At the very least, she could have abandoned him. She could have waited in safety until searching was easier.</p>
<p><br/> It was as if she feared to run out of time, as if she thought he needed her immediately- and oh, he needed- and it was as if the thought of his death was so horrid that she could not bear to wait.</p>
<p><br/> What sort of emotion compels a person to do that for another?</p>
<p><br/> What is it?</p>
<p><br/> He weaves his fingers into her pinned up hair, sharp white digits through soft black curls. He tilts her head back and drags his mouth over hers. Her intake of breath sounds like a dying gasp, like the sigh of a starved prisoner wasting away, forgotten in the dark. He feels her body crumple and fold toward his, then straighten again because she is frightened to press too close. He feels her lips part, her jaw angling so needy and wanting into his touch. Her hands flutter at her sides, fingertips just brushing his elbow.</p>
<p><br/> He does not need to indulge her. He wonders though if there is any reason he shouldn’t. What is an hour of his time, what is a bit of careful attention when given to someone who waited fourteen years?</p>
<p><br/> He puts his tongue to the seam of her lips. He kisses her lightly, pressing hard enough to bruise but only for an instant. He controls the tilt of her head, tipping it back to graze his mouth down the side of her neck. She trembles violently and he brushes reassuring caresses up the side of her arm.</p>
<p><br/> “Shh, sweet girl,” he murmurs and a sob tears free of her throat. He feels the vibration of it in the crook of her neck; she smells like dust and lightning. He touches the back of her dress and the laces unweave themselves, spilling the gown like dark water down her ivory skin.</p>
<p><br/> He finds this an odd moment and he reflects as he idly picks pins out of her hair. He likes the way she leans into his touch. He likes the way her eyelids flutter and her pulse jumps madly beneath her skin. He likes the way her hair begs him to seize it, wild black curls tumbling down as he frees them. He likes the sounds she makes, the bitten-off gasps that are so hopelessly overwhelmed, each raspy sob telling tales of drowning. He likes how she wants to touch him and is too frightened to actually do it. He likes that she is crying. He catches her tears on his tongue and he kisses her eyelids. He catches her when her knees give way and her body simply folds into his arms.</p>
<p><br/> He carries her through the room to the bed in the corner. She clings closer in a ragged, unobtrusive way- face turned into his shoulder, fingers curling into his robes- and he likes that too. It is different and even absurd. He likes her. He has never before embraced someone that he actually likes.</p>
<p><br/> Then again, there are precious few individuals he can tolerate for more than a few hours at a time.</p>
<p><br/> His heart and soul are not with him of course. They are freezing to death somewhere far away, layered ten times over in frost; he has forgotten they exist at all. He feels a parched, crippling pain and he does not know what it means. He is both stranded outside of his body and trapped deep within, threaded sparsely through his own veins. Bella was sweet at fifteen. She was witty and flawless and it flits through his brain, the memory of being <em>enchanted</em>. She said the most vicious, ruthless things with guileless, big gray eyes. She made him laugh so hard his sides hurt, skipping through blood and sneering at death.</p>
<p><br/> He does not remember though. He does not recall.</p>
<p><br/> Fondness is the ghost of a dream. If there was a reason he kept her so close and taught her so well, it was long ago cut away. There were a hundred million useless emotions he did not need to keep.</p>
<p><br/> He presses Bellatrix into the sheets, catches her jaw and bends over her thin body. She arches up, leaning up toward him and he rewards her with another kiss. She’s insatiable. She holds so still but somehow, she is terribly hard to control. He wraps her hair around his fist and presses her down again. Her shaking fingertips graze over his face; he grabs her wrist and pins it to the bed. She still manages to drive their pace, stealing kisses from his mouth, forcing him to be harsh.</p>
<p><br/> She’s such a troublesome wretch; she drags him through the scraping filter of her frantic, senseless breaths. It’s pretty the way she writhes, this integument of panic coating darker impulses of want. It’s pitiful. He bites at her neck because he’s in the bed with her, because she’s tangled herself through his legs and he never noticed. The cry on her lips sounds like the cries she makes when he tortures her. The echoes in the air trace outlines of the Cruciatus Curse. Her body arcs up into his, curving breasts and hips and thighs luring him down. His patience wears thin.</p>
<p><br/> He spells his robes away into the dark, letting them bleed off like shadows. He doesn’t need his potion; she’s impossible. She’s always been such an impossible, intractable little girl. He pulls her closer by the hips, dragging her legs around him. The matter at hand is simple. Biology and reproduction are the bare bones of existence. He does not have to drown in a dark pit of doubt with Bellatrix Black Lestrange. He splays one white hand over her face, pushing her glassy stare down and to the side. He takes her.</p>
<p><br/> If he wonders whether or not she will be difficult to please, he does not wonder long. The rush of heat and slick compression is more consuming than he remembers. Her spindly body contracts almost as soon as he seats himself fully inside her. She thrashes and her muscles squeeze. She grabs at his hand that is still over her face, parted lips sliding over his skin. Her thighs clench around his waist until she has seized him like a vise. He was logical and cold only an hour ago but she seeps into him, tantalizes him, burns him away with an abundance of heat.</p>
<p><br/> The witch’s orgasm slams the breath out of his lungs.</p>
<p><br/> There is a snarl on his lips that ends in a hiss. Bella goes boneless and languid, gasping raggedly into the pillow. Her body is flushed now, sanguine from head to toe. Her hair is like ink, bleeding plentifully over a crumpled page. She does not even try to look at him. In fact, she does not seem particularly cognizant at all. Her eyes are as glassy as if he hit her with a Confundus Charm- but he did not. He has not worked any magic. It’s an enticing display. If she did not look so delirious, he would think she was doing it on purpose.</p>
<p><br/> His role as a logical spectator has melted into a molten, indistinct shape. He is already grinding and pushing into her, causing sharp hitches in her breathing that grow ever more strained. Her flesh slicks and tightens around him, spasming in that difficult way. He pulls her to him roughly, slamming in deeper than before. She jerks in his grasp, back arcing off the bed and a cry tearing from her lips. Her eyelids flutter and she gropes blindly at the headboard. The heady pleasure permeating everything makes it impossible to concentrate. Bella reacts to his every movement and her writhing is either decadent or poisonous. He is completely indifferent to her but he is indifferent to pragmatism as well. He is indifferent to efficiency. He did not push this witch down for the sake of indulging <em>himself</em> but he is indifferent to that fact too.</p>
<p><br/> Isolation is painless until the first taste of warmth. He’ll fuck her gladly if it feels like this. He’ll crawl in beneath her skin if it lessens his cold.</p>
<p><br/> Bella’s shifting and broken mewls get tedious. He puts his hand over her throat and squeezes, pushing down. There could be stars bursting across his vision. The constellation Orion could be stabbing pinpoints of light through his blackness. The more he seeks fulfillment, the more he feels lost. The closer he clings to her, the more he is aware of some gaping emptiness. He tries to hold her but his grip slips away. She blazes like a woman-shaped star and he is only a shadow, drawn in by this sick, gravitational pull. He covets her and he would hoard her away in a secret place if only he could pick her up. He despises her with a mounting irritation, torn apart and tangled in his own thoughts. The tension in his body crests and releases, shooting fiery delights through his limbs. He braces himself with one hand on the bed, trying to stifle his frantic breaths.</p>
<p><br/> He has remembered to stop strangling her somewhat belatedly. He pulls away, sinking down to the sheets at her side. She isn’t moving and he wonders for a moment if she is dead. He feels so relaxed and sated that he cannot bring himself to care. Eventually however he reprimands himself, sneers at himself, and casts a wordless spell. Healing magic seeps through Bellatrix’s abused throat and bruised hips. A breath swells in her chest. Her blank stare breaks as she sluggishly blinks.</p>
<p><br/> For a moment, he thinks to pull her into his lap and rock her to sleep, card his fingers through her sweaty, tangled hair. The thought is an idiotic one however. How long will he be rendered senseless? Bellatrix seems reluctant to stir so he leaves her there, summoning his robes back to him and rising from the bed.</p>
<p><br/> The fire has died. Did he really spend so much time dallying with her? He feels disconnected. The darkened chamber is empty and cooler than Bella’s skin. He exhales a long breath, closing his eyes, massaging his temples. There is something wrong, something he cannot possibly look at. He has his back pressed to a void. He is not really here. He is shattered glass fragments ground down into cutting grains of dust. Why is this troubling him now of all times? This is tedious, all of it. He has work to do. He has a dream to realize. Heedless of his agenda, his mind shifts and stabs at itself and his being falls.</p>
<p><br/> He turns back to the bed and heals Bellatrix some more. He caresses her awake and murmurs soothing encouragements. He helps her dress and she lets him aid her pliantly. He leads her to the door and she walks dream-like from the room. He wishes her a warm good night. She bids him farewell with a shaky curtsy and then slips off into the night.</p>
<p><br/> He closes the door quickly after that and locks it with a spell. The cold is better, he reminds himself without really examining the words. He presses on, ghosts of sensation making it difficult to forget.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>He puts the entire matter out of his mind with practiced efficiency. He is skilled at shutting things out and compartmentalizing. Thus, the worsening of the situation should be blamed entirely on Bellatrix- and perhaps the Lestrange brothers as well. He finds her outside his door at night just two days later, wide-eyed and wanting.</p>
<p><br/> “My lord,” she whispers, fingering the doorframe, “forgive me- it- it did not take. My body must not be at full health. Perhaps if we try again…”</p>
<p><br/> He knows she is lying. There is a subtle glow to her skin, an exultant radiance that infuses her every movement. She is just a mortal human witch but she’s as incandescent as her namesake. She is with child already; he would stake his existence on it.</p>
<p><br/> For some reason, he pretends he is fooled. He lets her in. He lets her come close. She does not seem to mind that he hurt her last time. Nevertheless, he takes care to be more gentle…it wouldn’t do to harm his baby.</p>
