    <p>
  <span>Harry wakes up to the warmth of sunshine on his face and an arm draped over his chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a second he feels disoriented, the world suddenly thrown off its axis. </span>
  <em>
    <span>It can’t be.</span>
  </em>
  <span> And yet he’s silently hoping that the solid weight over him won’t disappear like a remnant of a dream.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It doesn’t. A shallow intake of breath and several cursory blinks later, Harry could still feel it there, pinning him like gravity pulling him down the center. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He finally glances down, his eyes meeting unblemished porcelain skin that glows faintly under the honeyed hues of morning sunlight filtering through the lace curtains. He knows that if he turns his head to the side, he’ll feel the sharp jut of a pointed chin press against his forehead, or appreciate in close proximity the elegant column of a milky white neck. Harry is suddenly taken by waves of unadulterated </span>
  <em>
    <span>want</span>
  </em>
  <span>- he wants to touch every inch of skin displayed before him, wants to place reverent kisses on every surface that wordlessly spoke of years of love, wants to repeat it over and over until the world collapses and all that remains is </span>
  <em>
    <span>them</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he doesn’t. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>This is enough</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Harry tells himself. And it is. He doesn’t move an inch, not wanting to wake up Draco and put a premature end to this rare moment. He’ll have this for as long as he could, and add it to the certain space at the back of his mind where anything Draco-related resides, where he could turn the memories around and over his head in private until the longing in his chest becomes a dull throb that he could manage to ignore. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It all ends when a disgruntled voice pierces through the air, sharp with a barely-concealed accusation. “How long have you been awake?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco pulls away from him before he could even get a word out and sits up unceremoniously, the blanket pooling over his lap. Harry follows the motion with his eyes. Even without his glasses he could see the sharp angles and smooth planes that make Draco Malfoy the most beautiful person he’d ever laid his eyes on, and having him here beside him, and yet untouchable and feeling so far away, </span>
  <em>
    <span>hurts</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So Harry does what he’s been doing for the past few months--he looks away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turns to his side, facing the glass-paned windows and away from Draco before he could notice the rapid breaths threatening to shake his whole body. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Not that he would care.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He tries to count in his head, anything to pass the time by. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I should be used to this by now</span>
  </em>
  <span>, he thinks with blurry eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He feels the bed move, then he hears muffled footsteps thudding quietly on the floor. He knows that Draco has left, most probably on his way to the loo. Harry finds everything easier now--breathing through his nose, calming down the beat of his heart, blinking tears off his eyes. With one last sigh he pushes himself up, fingers snatching up the blanket and folding it in a neat square before setting it aside on the pillows. He stretches languidly as he stands on his feet, slowly trudging his way out of the room and down the stairs. He feels the cool air against his naked back and seeping through the thin fabric of his pyjamas that hangs low on his hips as he nears the kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before, he does it on purpose, because it would only take one look before Draco’s lips and hands would worship every inch of his body, demanding Harry to just give and </span>
  <em>
    <span>give</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Now, Harry’s just too lazy to care to put on some clothes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> It’s not like Draco would appreciate the display anyway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’d just finished off his toast when Draco emerges through the entryway, sleek hair pulled back and posh clothes donned on--today he’s wearing charcoal slacks, a crisp white button down shirt tucked beneath a silver blazer that brings out the color of his eyes. All he could do is watch from the corner of his eye as Draco stops by the island counter Harry’s leaning at, and for one blissful moment he thought of Draco getting the Earl Grey tea that Harry had placed just for him over the marble top. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry would always make it for him in the morning, and Draco would always leave it untouched. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It hadn’t been like that before, though. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I love it when you do this. Making tea for me.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grey eyes skim past the teacup as if it isn’t even there, his hand reaching out to the fresh copy of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Daily Prophet</span>
  </em>
  <span> lying a few inches away from it. Then he walks up by the refrigerator, pulling out a fresh apple before swinging the door shut. Harry decides to speak before he could think much of it. “Busy day at Gringotts?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco doesn’t bother looking at him as he replies with an acerbic tone. “Yes, so don’t wait up for me later.” And with that he disapparates with an audible </span>
  <em>
    <span>pop</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a moment Harry just stands there, staring at the spot where Draco had just been a while ago. And then he picks up the porcelain teacup, the antique set fitting perfectly in his hand, and tips its contents over the sink. He opens the faucet to wash off the remaining dredges in the cup. The sound of rushing water steadies him, just as well as the sight of the tea disappearing in rivulets down the drain. Maybe it’s the routine that calms him, or the familiar feel of resignation that settles in his bones. His mind is blank and he doesn’t think much about it; he places the teacup back on the cupboard, closing it with a resolute </span>
  <em>
    <span>thud </span>
  </em>
  <span>that echoes in the all-too quiet kitchen</span>
  <em>
    <span>.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He notices that his hands are shaking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This is his house, it is Draco’s, it is </span>
  <em>
    <span>theirs</span>
  </em>
  <span>, but is it still home when all he could think about constantly is that it’s not </span>
  <em>
    <span>anymore?</span>
  </em>
