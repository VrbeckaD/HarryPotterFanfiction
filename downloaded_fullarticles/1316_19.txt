Without missing a beat, he turned around a pulled at the top of his trousers, revealing Sirius’ name written neatly just at the top of his butt cheek. </p><p>Sirius could have died with laughter right there and then. </p><p>He ventured closer and sure enough, wrote in thick black ink said “Sirius Potter, my brother.” He ignored the tears as he embraced James tightly. </p><p>This was not how he imagined the wedding to go.</p></div>
