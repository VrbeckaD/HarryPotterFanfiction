  <span>“...and if we don’t hit any traffic, we should be there in a couple hours.” Remus explained to James, with whom he was on speakerphone with.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“And don’t tell Lily we bought cookies!” Sirius exclaimed in the seat next to him. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus rolled his eyes and pressed end on his mobile, focusing once more on the road. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t you have some final you have to study for Pads?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Psh. Like I’ve ever been known to study.” Sirius turned to grin at Remus, while lifting his feet onto the dash.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh? I can think of a few instances where you were coerced into studying…” Remus’ face was blank, but his voice had lowered and gained an almost gravelly texture. Sirius knew then how doomed he was. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“In fact, I seem to recall just last week. I believe my hand was down your trousers, as you recited Silvia Plath and Walt Whitman to me.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius’ hips twitched in recollection, as he brought his fist to his mouth. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t you want to be a good boy for me, Pads?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius couldn’t hide the moan this time. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Shit, Moons. Keep that up and I’ll make a mess in your car.” Sirius murmured into his fist.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh? I thought that was the point?” Remus’ expression turned predatory. “I thought if I could get you right over the edge, that you’d be the best boy for me and study… Then maybe later tonight I could reward you some more, but with my mouth.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius couldn’t stop the moan from escaping once more, his eyes rolling back and hips rolling as he came. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Good boy, Pads.”</span>
