<p>Tom Riddle’s Menagerie of Oddities was known the world over for its fascinating collection of the strange and macabre. His glorious three masted ship The Slytherin bore a coiled green and silver serpent on its massive sails to let the seaside towns know when he was pulling into port. And there he would stay, sometimes for weeks at a time, offering daily tours of the mysterious gallery held below deck…a maze of cages and cupboards and rooms filled with rarities procured from nearly every continent. Of course there were priceless and beautiful antiquities; a necklace of cursed jewels in a protective glass case, poisons to kill with a single drop on the tongue and grotesque, tragic, misshapen animals preserved in jars. There were even beautiful treasures like delicate fairy skeletons and the translucent white wing of a Peagasus. He had plants that snapped and ate mice whole, mirrors that offered visions of your greatest desire, even paintings that moved or spoke to those who walked by. The collection held so many outlandish specimens that often people wondered aloud if Riddle himself might be a demon, a sorcerer, or worst of all…a wizard.</p>
<p>Of course he was not, and in fact took great offense to the insinuation. The wizard was Draco Malfoy, an orphan that Riddle had found in the alleys of London, crouched in the corner quietly casting spells; turning rats into alabaster figurines that he sold for a few shillings on street corners, the garish black mark on his skinny arm revealing his magical nature. Wizards were frowned upon, considered abominations in the sight of the Lord, and even practicing their magic in the privacy of their own homes was cause enough to abuse or imprison them. Having had his parents hanged in the town square for supposedly hexing a local businessman, Little Draco was all alone, living on the streets, putting himself in grave danger by practicing magic in the open. But Riddle knew an opportunity on sight and he took it, offering the young boy a steady job and a life full of adventure on the seas. But don’t mistake this invitation for gallantry, for sympathy or kindheartedness. In fact, had Draco known ten years ago that the "adventure" would actually be slavery, exploitation and cruelty he would have run the other way. But he was in too far to leave now and with no family and no money and being the freak of nature that he was, he had no choice but to stay.</p>
<p>Besides, he could never leave Tilly.</p>
<p>Because Riddle’s Menagerie was not only made of books and paintings and colorful flora…he kept living creatures as well. He kept them all in cages, put collars around their necks and locked them in boxes and closets in the dark and damp recesses of the ship. Draco’s job was to care for them. There was the dog with three heads, two of which were happy to be pet and one perpetually sleeping, a little cage filled with Pixies, blue skin with slim legs and diaphanous wings, their giggling and flirting a constant undercurrent in Draco’s day unless he covered them with a black cloth for a few minutes of precious silence. There were giant spiders and birds with fur and horns, a small green creature that looked like the stem of a plant and was constantly getting lost below decks until Draco affixed a bell to his neck no larger than a grain of rice. Some of the creatures were actual magical beasts, tracked down in dark forests and murky swamps, captured and enslaved for the entertainment of the very people who had driven them into hiding, but most were regular animals transfigured by Draco himself…a pigeon turned into a Phoenix, a fat old beagle given two extra heads...he manufactured these lies for Riddle’s glory. But of all the creatures on display, Draco’s favorite was Tilly, a spritely white ferret who had a limitless bag of tricks. He walked tiny tight ropes, balanced on a red rubber ball, walked on his hind legs holding roses to give to the ladies. None of these things were magical, just the result of good training, Draco spending late nights and long boring days teaching the sleek little weasel everything he knew. When he was working Tilly would ride on his shoulder or curl up in the pocket of his apron, his head popping out to take in the scenery or a breath of fresh air. At night the ferret slept on Draco’s stomach, curled up and warm, listening to his master’s heart.</p>
<p>And this is how we find Draco now…swaying in his hammock as the ship sails close to the coast of Dover, a common port for them when gathering supplies. From there they will sail North and inland until they are close enough for word to get out that they are available for the people of London and their money. It’s a clear night, nearly a full moon, and the young wizard can’t fall asleep so he rolls out of his swinging bed and brings food to the creatures, most of which are nocturnal, pacing and chattering to each other in the humid dark below deck. He needs fresh air. He needs to see the cliffs, the stars, the lights of town on the horizon, anything that will remind him that there is more in the world than this ship, this citadel where he is both prisoner and warden. When the creatures are fed and quieted, soothed with kind words and soft strokes, Draco climbs up onto the deck and leans over the edge of the boat, breathing in the cool, salty air. As horrid as his life has become…he never does grow tired of the sea.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione is the eldest daughter of King Triton, King of the Sea, and with that title comes certain privileges and power. Much like her father she can control the waters: alter the currents, spin up whirlpools and pull up great waves to toss and drag down the boats full of greedy and unlawful fishermen. Like her father, Hermione feels a personal responsibility for the creatures of the ocean, the beasts unable to defend themselves against the tools and weapons of man. Unlike her father, she has a deep and unquenchable curiosity about these men, these fragile creatures who think they own the seas and everything in them, so puffed and proud as to think they can plunder and kill daily without consequence. And so this morbid curiosity draws her closer than she should be, close enough to smell the rotting meat on their ships, to hear their voices, close enough to know they might see her as well, but she’s a powerful swimmer; a smooth and silent diver so she knows she can always evade them if necessary.</p>
<p>She sees the ship with green and silver sails skimming slowly over the calm seas, dragging a net behind, snaring any number of fish and crustaceans, too many to feed one crew. It’s odd to see them trawling at night so she swims a bit closer, watching the net from above and below. Her father has warned her against being seen by the blood-thirsty mortals, but still she keeps her head well above the surface, watching with narrowed eyes as a young man with white hair dumps a bucket of food scraps and waste over the side of the ship. Although she is a ways off from the boat, only her head visible, the young man stops and looks up, catching her eye immediately, holding her gaze for a long moment. She can’t seem to move; surprised at being discovered, and the man tips his head to the side to observe her, offering a small smile before finally disappearing into the belly of the boat.</p>
<p>Seeing the man makes her far too curious and courageous for her own good and she ventures closer. Now the boat is glowing golden light from its portholes, reflecting on the ripples of the water. She’s seen ships before, but this one is fascinating in its silence. There are no loud, drunken sailors, no humans pissing off the sides, no earsplitting music reverberating through the waves. In fact she’s seen no one at all except the young white haired man and even now he is nowhere to be found. Swimming around and beneath the boat, she dares a peek into the portholes but sees nothing familiar, only boxes and dark cloth, a few swinging lanterns. Pulling back from the ship she smells a sweet, rich smoke, nothing like the smell of a burning boat or the fires she’s seen in human battles. This is something different, almost pleasant. Still, smoke is usually a sign of danger and so she darts beneath the surface again, headed back to her home near the bottom of the sea. She is comfortable and confident and eager to go back to the boat when the sun is up for a closer look.</p>
<p>Because she doesn’t know that Tom Riddle was awake and smoking his pipe, his eyes wide as he caught sight of an actual mermaid, swimming freely around The Slytherin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After gathering their supplies (tobacco and hard cheese, whiskey, a barrel of ale and a crate of biscuits) in port, Draco and Riddle board the ship and Draco sets to feeding and cleaning the various creatures, letting some of them free of their cages or boxes to roam and stretch their legs or wings when Riddle is asleep. Once they’ve set sail and charted a course North, he will fix a meal for himself and his master. He doesn’t necessarily enjoy his company, but it’s the only company he has.</p>
<p>“I’ll need another one of your invisible nets boy,” Riddle says as they sit below decks with tankards of ale, eating salted pork and boiled potatoes. “I’ve seen the prize of the sea and I’m going to snag her.”</p>
<p>Draco turns to Tiggy and feeds him a cheese rind to hide the rolling of his eyes. No doubt Riddle would ask him to transfigure an eel into a sea serpent or a crab into a Kelpie. He would create these fake magical beings and the hypocrites would pay gold to admire them, all the while torturing and imprisoning actual magical folk like himself, branding them with hideous and permanent marks on their arms, calling them dark sinners. His bitterness towards them was an endless black pit.</p>
<p>“What is it you want now Mr. Riddle? It will take me a bit to work up the spells,” he lies, hoping to buy the innocent sea creature just a bit more time.</p>
<p>In truth the spell was the same, he only needed to visualize a different beast. They have dozens of these false creatures, but Draco still isn’t sure if the actual transfiguration is painful. They are just innocent animals after all, unable to speak or express their discomfort.</p>
<p>“I don’t need your godless curses,” Riddle spits, although he has just asked for an invisible net. “I’ve found the real thing this time. I only need to capture it.”</p>
<p>Draco looks up, giving Tilly another bit of food.</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“I was out having a piss and a smoke last night and saw the flip of her tail, a bit of her hair in the moonlight, white like the belly of a fish. A genuine mermaid my boy.”</p>
<p>Draco’s blood runs cold. He’d seen the same mermaid himself, her head bobbing above the waves as she stared up at him. For once he agrees with Riddle; she was indeed the most gorgeous, perfect specimen they'd ever seen. And he prays desperately for her to stay safe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For days she watches the ship as it slumbers in port near the rocky cliffs, only occasionally daring to approach the barnacle encrusted bow. In her secret observations she has discovered which porthole shows her the beautiful white haired man with skin like the moonlight and eyes the color of angry, lightning filled storm clouds. She watches him sleep, rocked by the waves, his rosy lips parted, hair mussed and hanging in front of his eye, chest finally bare of that useless clothing that humans insist on wearing. Just the sight of him, his  gives her a thrill deep in her belly, forbidden and exciting. Sometimes at night she can see him on the deck of the ship, staring out over the water; never smiling, never speaking, he seems to be searching for something in the sea and she wishes more than anything she could bring it forth.</p>
<p>Likewise, he watches for her from the deck every night; a flash of her tail or the trail of her silvery white and blue hair, like sea foam on the waves. He’s been alive nearly twenty-one years and she is the most magical thing he’s ever encountered and knowing she will be captured, imprisoned, torn away from all that she knows, makes his heart tight with regret. But Mr. Riddle is never hesitant with a beating or a lashing with his belt, or worse with torturing the other creatures on board if Draco doesn’t behave, so when Tom asked him for the invisible net Draco built it, enchanting the ropes as asked, but still hoping she would stay clear of his snare.</p>
<p>It’s a dark night with calm seas and a waning moon when she swims up behind the boat, surprised to find the white haired man leaning over the edge, staring right down at her.  His eyes are sharp and glittering in the murky moonlight and he frowns at her.</p>
<p>“Go!” He whispers, his voice low and hoarse.</p>
<p>Hermione doesn’t hear him and he leans over further, cringing as she dares to swim close enough to touch the side of the ship. Her face is nearly glowing, her eyes the color of sun on seawater, her white blue hair spread out over the surface, threaded through with delicate seaweeds and adorned with white shells. And in that moment Draco is torn between wanting to snare her for himself and telling her to dive to keep safe. He can’t look away. She is like a jewel floating up from the deep.</p>
<p>“GO!” he yells a bit louder.</p>
<p>“There boy! I see her! Pull in the net!”</p>
<p>Hermione flinches, looking for the source of the other voice but finding nothing. It must be the other man, the dark, rough hewn man she saw only once before. When she looks up to the deck again the white haired man is gone and before she can call out for him, before she can do anything at all, she feels tightness around her arms and tail, like the strongest tentacles of a squid, or thick, unforgiving seaweed, and yet there is nothing there. Her arms are pulled tight to her sides, her tail squeezed and bent up at an uncomfortable angle and she is dragged from the water, dangling in mid air.</p>
<p>“Bring her in boy! That’s it! We’ve got it! She’s gonna make me rich!”</p>
<p>She twists and writhes and cries out for her father, for anyone, a shark, a storm, the white haired man…but the invisible restraints pull her over the side and she is dumped onto the deck of the ship at the feet of the older, darker man. He crouches down, grinning at her with dull, yellowed teeth, an ugly brown stick between his teeth trailing white smoke into her eyes; the same sickly sweet, cloying smoke she’d smelled only a night before.</p>
<p>“Well well,” he says, running a knife through the net, which suddenly appears as nothing more than old, rotted, water logged rope. “She’s beautiful isn’t she boy? Take her downstairs to the tank. Your godless magic did just the trick.”</p>
<p>The dark man steps aside and reveals the white haired man, much younger, his face drawn and sad, eyes glittering in the dark as he meets her gaze. She angrily slaps her tail against the deck, the delicate gills in her neck flipping open and shut, desperate for oxygen. She feels faint, dizzy, and though she wants to fight she can barely breathe.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” he whispers, pulling her up into his arms. </p>
<p>She is a mermaid, a princess of the sea, and because their skin is touching she knows the truth of his emotions. She knows he speaks the truth, and so she closes her eyes and cowers against his chest, praying to the ocean that she'll be back in the water soon.</p>
