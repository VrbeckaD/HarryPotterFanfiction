  <span>Lazy Sunday mornings cuddling in bed are the best thing, Ginny decided early on, once she and Luna had moved into their cottage. They </span>
  <em>
    <span>had </span>
  </em>
  <span>cuddled before, of course, but there is something special in doing so in your very own bed in your very own house with your very own girlfriend, who has sparkly eyes and a kind heart.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The cuddling often leads to kissing, leads to less and then no clothes, and then it’s all sighing, giggles and gasping. And there is cuddling, always, in the bonelesness of afterglow.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ginny never takes it for granted, nor does Luna.</span>
