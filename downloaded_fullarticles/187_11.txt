    <p>
  <span>“Gift the withering man a drink, for he will tell you the truth.” Was Rowena’s consultation. It was, perhaps, the worst advice that had ever tumbled from her graceful lips. Salazar hadn’t been bothered to try and analyze the arcane guidance heretofore. He had only skimmed the surface of what was said previously… Rowena had always been more of a philosopher than him, after all. She was always questioning things then subsequently bestowing vague, cryptic answers to herself and whomever may be asking or around. Ones that insinuate at the resolution, but never state it unmitigated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Salazar can, even now, recall her eyes. Her gray eyes danced in amusement, and hopped from book to book to book, only to sharpen when they landed on him. At this time, Salazar had been the only one in her office atrium with her. Her smokey silver orbs, shimmering with ostensibly infinite intelligence, nevertheless, those sparks craved more knowledge. She knows something, yet won't tell anyone, that’s what landed Salazar with her in the athenaeum-like room, on this day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rowena had been perusing her books, her office, attempting to iron out any kinks that she may see. Assuring herself that everything was immaculate. There was a day before students were to arrive. No matter how vigorously Salazar fought with them to try and keep the banal-born in Hogwarts for the summers and holidays. Yet, in spite of his belligerent actions and words against it, they were all sent home. Banals wouldn’t understand them, the Banal-Borns wouldn’t be safe. Banals kill what they don’t understand. Fear blinds Banals. Naturally, therefore- because of the… abhorrence they maintain-, they strangle the life out of their own children. Merely because they made a doll dance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Banals couldn’t be trusted, even if the mother created the child, she wouldn’t hesitate to slaughter her daughter for creating stars to stick on her rooms ceiling. Godric, Helga, and Rowena… They didn’t understand this. They weren’t born to Banals. They never had to hide their grandeur, overzealous potential. They never had their own mother, try to quash their power with a dilapidated quilt that she made for them before they were born. They never suffocated underneath that old quilt. Salazar didn’t trust Banals as far as he could throw them, the claws of dread were too consuming for them to be trusted about this.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rowena was supposed to be intelligent. She didn’t see- didn’t know, didn’t want to learn- what the Banals were like. She had been raised by her magical mother, who ran a kingdom. Her father was also magical and he was their diplomat, always traveling well the queen ran their territory of jurisdiction. She would never know the struggles of someone like Salazar. A thief, who went to and fro, from master to master to learn all he could about controlling his magic. Rowena grew up loved, her people knew about magic they loved it, they loved her. They thought of her family as imident offspring from God. As Messiahs. As Miracle Manufactures. She couldn’t possibly perceive that people did, in fact, fear and hate those that they couldn’t understand. That they wouldn’t understand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Salazar had been poor, he had run away from his family at a young age. He traveled, snuck on ships and wondered all over the world. He learned as much as he could, from everyone. The first time that he met Godric, Rowena and Helga was when they all came to him. He was known for healing, for miracles in a small and obscure town. Salazar didn’t know how they found him and he didn’t want to know. He had bought a decent sized plot of land and built a small cottage on it, plants covered every other inch of the property. Magical and mundane.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The three of them wanted Salazar to heal Rowena’s mother. Salazar and Rowena had gotten on like a fish to water, they bickered about almost everything, trying to one up the other with the most baffling and strange knowledge that they had. Salazar actually enjoyed it, quite thoroughly. Salazar also generously enjoyed mangling Godric’s puffed-up ego. Helga…  Helga mostly stayed quiet, they talked occasionally about plants and their own knowledge on subjects, but they didn’t spar with words like Salazar would do with Rowena.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Salazar snaps out of his reminiscing when Rowena clears her throat. “I trust you know why you are here, Salazar.” It was more of a statement than a question.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I do not know.” Salazar drawls with ease- the art being something he picked up from Helga, surprisingly. “Would you care to enlighten me, Rowena?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The look that Rowena gave him could have frozen over even the warmest summer day. “We are here to discuss your…” She pauses as if to find the most eloquent wording for the situation at hand, “banishment, from Hogwarts.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Salazar opens his mouth, incredulous, “So you plan to ostracize me from my own home!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rowena gives a serene smile, one with many secrets behind it, one that Salazar did not trust. “Don’t say that, Sal. We all thought it would be… detrimental to… expel you from Hogwarts. You aren’t good for the children.” Before Salazar could open his mouth again she continues, “You have been feeding them lies, Sal. Banals aren’t as dangerous as you spin them to be. You are breeding hate and prejudice against them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Salazar’s hands gripped the armrests of his chair too hard, his knuckles white. “You and the others don’t get to call me that. Not now. Not ever.” He hisses out before she could continue. “You don’t want to see, Rowena! You have never lived or god forbid visited the places where some of them live! I know people, Rowena.” Salazar is keeping his voice quiet, but the amount of caustic venom is palpable. “The Banals, They fear things they don’t understand! They would do anything to ‘right the wrong’. To ‘extract and purge the devil’ out of these children!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rowena cuts in smoothly, she doesn’t even seem fazed by what Salazar is saying. “You, Salazar, are no longer welcome, in or near the lands of Hogwarts ground.” Her face and eyes are stony, she’s made a conviction and is sticking to it. “You have one hour to gather your things and leave, Salazar. Think of it as a last generosity.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The other founders are in the room suddenly, all Salazar can see is red, he lunges across the desk to grab at Rowena. Godric holds him back, Godric whom Salazar loved, Godric who had seen the most intimate and secret parts of Salazar. Godric, who knew him. And all Godric tells Salazar is; “You can’t be here any longer, Salazar. Just… Just gather your things and leave.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Something in Salazar broke at those words. A deep stab of betrayal, a gut wrenching knife tugging at his guts and shoveling out his chest. Salazar should have known. He can never have nice things. Godric, who knew him, was the one to shut the door in his face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Salazar… Salazar never came back after that. He never settled down, he never went near Rowena’s kingdom, Eaglesrose. Never traveled close to Hogwarts, ever again. They had segregated him from them, isolated him from everyone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Salazar only then considered Rowena’s cryptic proclamation, ‘Gift the withering man a drink, for he will tell you the truth’. The only thing he could think of was the way that they exiled him so willingly. Maybe, maybe if he had given them the drink, his memories, would they have believed him of the truth. Or maybe he was the withering man, in desperate need of a drink. He would have told them had they given him a chance. He would have told them, had they given him that drink of defense. That didn’t change that Godric knew though. He knew and didn’t stop them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Salazar ignored all of the letters, begging him to come back. He settled in a completely mundane area, filled with Banals. He had warded everything, from mail redirects to making his little farmhouse in the middle of a sea of farms unplottable. The Banals killed him eventually. They caught him healing the child of a friend. A woman in the nearby village, who won his tentative trust. She was married to a priest. Her husband was the one that caught Salazar in the middle of the ritual, and the one that chained him up. Carted him away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A few days after they got a hold of Salazar, they burned him at the stake. He could still remember the feeling of his flesh burning off, his skin blistering until he couldn’t feel anymore. Salazar, cursed them, he cursed them. Cursed Godric, cursed Rowena, cursed Helga. And for the first time in a long time, Salazar cried, before his consciousness was swept away and consumed by flames. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Death… Death was dark.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was nothing. He was finally at peace, he felt lighter than ever. There wasn't the weight of betrayal and the world on his shoulders.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Salazar was finally in a place that he could be open. A place where no one was around, so he wandered the darkness. Only able to see his own body, the black, peeling skin and emerald blood staining his hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then, there was light.</span>
