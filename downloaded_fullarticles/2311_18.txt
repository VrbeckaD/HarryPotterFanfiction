        <span>He still hasn’t quite wrapped his head around the reality that his brother is alive. A year after they met in this god awful house and it hasn’t sunk in yet. Perhaps, Sirius muses, it’s because this Regulus - no longer the skinny little Death Eater groupie - is confidant and proud in a way that no longer sends his hackles up.</span>

        <span>Maybe it’s because they’ve both been changed by the world around them.</span>

        <span>He hasn’t been sleeping and Sirius knows that because late at night, he sits in the kitchen and drinks coffee to stay awake. Not that Sirius blames him. Voldemort is back and knows he’s a traitor - though his brother is still being irritatingly close lipped about why and how he faked his death so well. He can’t judge either. Most nights, he joins his brother there. And, since the Weasley clan moved in, Ginny had found her way there as well (and Sirius doesn’t want to think about what could cause a girl of fourteen to have that many nightmares).</span>

        <span>Remus joins them as well, when he can and those nights are better, less silence. Regulus and Remus seemed to have come to an agreement at some point, because they occasionally slip into debate in a way that would almost convince Sirius that there was never bad blood between them. That they're friends. </span>

        <span>He’ll bring up Regulus’s secrets one night. A night without Ginny, but with Remus. They needed to know.</span>
