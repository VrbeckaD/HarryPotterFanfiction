    <p>In a normal town called Surrey, on a normal street called Privet Dr., was a normal house numbered 4. In the normal house lived a normal family, the Dursleys. There was father, mother and son. The father’s name was Mr. Vernon Dursley who was the director for Grunnings Drill Company and spent his time with his lovely family. He was normal. The mother was name Mrs. Petunia Dursley who was a homemaker and spent her time doting on her loving husband and son. She was normal. The son’s name was Dudley Dursley who was a model son and spent his time playing with his friends and watching tv. He was normal. Yet, every normal family has a not so normal family member. Like spinster aunts that spent their time drinking and bred dogs for a living. The Dursleys had one of those too. But the Dursleys had another family member who wasn’t so normal. In fact, this family member was most extraordinary indeed. He was named Harry Potter and he was a wizard.</p><p>Harry Potter was the son of Mrs. Dursley’s sister. His hair was black where the Dursleys’ hair was blond. He was skinny, much like the gaunt and horse-faced form of Mrs. Dursley, where the two male Dursley’s were heavy-set, one could say they were whale-like. He was timid and quiet and shy. Harry knew things most ten-year-olds didn’t. Harry knew how to cook and clean and weed the garden. He was Mrs. Dursley’s secret to her perfect garden which got her the Perfect Garden of the Year, four years in a row. However, Harry also didn’t have things that most ten-year-olds did. He did not have a room to call his own or even share one with his cousin, his cousin, on the other hand, had two bedrooms. Instead, Harry slept in the tiny cupboard under the stairs. Harry did not have clothes that fit him, not even second hand ones, and was often garbed in loose castoffs of his cousin that his aunt dyed grey. Harry had no friends. His cousin found ways to drive away all that would even dare to be kind to the small, scrawny boy at their school. Harry often found himself alone in the park in the neighborhood when Mrs. Dursley did not wasn’t willing to hire a baby sitter when she and the rest of his family went to enjoy a daytrip. Due to the actions of his cousin, Harry found himself avoided by all the children playing in the park. Yet, Harry did not have a need for human friends for he found himself to be in great company. He had a friend in all the plants and animals around him. For Harry was extraordinary, even for a wizard.</p><p>Harry sat in the park on Privet Dr., under a gnarled, old oak tree, drawing nonsensically with the pen and paper he swiped from his cupboard. The tree’s branches pointed up in odd directions like the hair of an elderly bloodhound and the tree sat much like a retired old bloodhound too, all dropping and lazy. Harry was listening. One couldn’t really tell if the saw the strange, black haired boy that sat under the oak tree. But, Harry was listening to the tree speak. The oak tree was old and grumpy and spoke with a gruff voice when the leaves ruffled. A nearby apple tree was quiet and strong and often lent down to let the young boy pluck a few fruits when the season was in. Just a bit farther away and closer to the edge of the park was a mischievous dogwood, planted by a visiting relative from the America’s. The dogwood had a tinkling laugh and whose flowers would mysteriously find themselves tangled in Harry’s hair every spring and who would tell the boy silly jokes to cheer him up. The rest of the inhabitants of the park were also chatty and had many stories for Harry. Like the winding ivy that told him how to best till the soil or the looming form of a wisteria vine, that dangled from the gazebo in the far-left end of the park, that taught him to always show love and endure anything the world had to throw at him. For the most beautiful flowers grew in the soil of strife. It was the wisteria that told him that he was a wizard for it remembered others who had abilities that they did not understand and they too had been wizards. Harry listened and learned and grew. He was a most extraordinary young boy, indeed.</p><p>The animals told him of many things. The snakes were the chattiest, for they understood him the best and could hold full length conversations with. Other animals of the park also spoke with him on occasion but most of the time their speech was more understanding an impression than complete and coherent thoughts. Harry knew they cared for him and thought of him as one of their own. A raven had even brought him a sandwich once when Harry had been left at the park by his aunt and had nothing to eat.</p><p>
  <em>‘Too skinny… must eat more… tiny chicks cannot fly… must eat more.’</em>
</p><p>However, when he found out that the raven had snagged the sandwich from someone who was trying to eat his own lunch, Harry had felt very bad. He had asked the raven to not steal any food for him after that. The raven still managed to bring him biscuits and chips and even the occasional soda and simply shrugged when asked how he had procured the items. Harry tried not to feel too guilty about it all.</p><p>Harry was almost eleven. He was told that it was a very important date for a young wizard. The ivy who had learned long ago from a distant relative who lived in the garden of a family that had a wizard child all the things a new wizard needed to know for their first few days. Harry had to be on the lookout for a letter and give a prompt reply.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>Tuesday dawned and promised to be a bright and cheery day. For most ten-year-olds. Harry lay in his cupboard, listening the small spider have an argument with a passing daddy-long-legs over who could and could not stay in the confined space.</p><p>
  <em>‘Plenty of space here, darling, you must remember to share with everyone around you. There are already other occupiers here. Surely your issue is not just with me.’</em>
</p><p>The daddy-long-legs was winning.</p><p> The abrupt clack of the of bolt in his door being unlocked startled the young boy into a sitting position. His aunt’s face peered in through the small slatted window.</p><p>“Up! Get up!” Her shrill voice cut through the slight haze of sleepiness that still clouded his head. “Quickly!”</p><p>Harry grumbled under his breath as he pulled on his shoes, after evicting a spider that was put off by the action, and trudged his way down the hallways to the kitchen. The entire room was dwarfed by a pile of gaudily wrapped boxes set up in one end of the room. A small groan left Harry’s lips. It was Dudley’s birthday.  </p><p>“Look after the bacon. And bring Vernon his coffee.” Orders flew out of his aunt’s mouth as Harry nodded diligently.</p><p>“Yes, aunt Petunia.”</p><p>Smells of meat and pancakes permeated the air as Harry got to work adding eggs to the alarmingly large amount of breakfast food for only four people. Truthfully, it would only be two people consuming the caloric monstrosity. Aunt Petunia would only eat small parfaits or other fruit based breakfast foods while Harry only had an egg and two rashers of bacon. Uncle Vernon was already on his second helping of pancakes and his third helping of bacon.</p><p>“Bring me my coffee boy!”</p><p>“Yes, uncle Vernon,” quickly pouring the steaming liquid, Harry handed it to his uncle before added the last of the bacon to Dudley’s plate and setting his own food on the table. It was only when Harry had sat down that Dudley finally came downstairs, the loud creaking and thumping on the stairs heralding the large boy’s arrival.</p><p>“Happy birthday, my sweet darling angle,” Aunt Petunia cooed as Dudley began to inhale his food. </p><p>To Harry Dudley had always looked more like a pig in a wig than an angel but, he supposed, ‘a face only a mother could love’ must have been based of fact. His cousin was living proof.</p><p>“How many are there?!” Dudley bellowed through a heavy helping of pancakes as he pointed at the precarious pile dwarfing the dining table. Harry winced as the boy sprayed food from his mouth and stared down at his own plate feeling his appetite drain away.</p><p>“There are thirty-six and your aunt Marge sent one too.” Uncle Vernon said happily as he looked at his son with pride filled eyes.</p><p>“That’s…” Dudley was starting to resemble a constipated pink elephant with every passing moment. “That’s thirty… thirty-seven?” He looked up at his mother for approval who was beaming with pride.</p><p>“That’s right sweet pea, there’s thirty-seven present just for you,” her voice was obnoxiously sweet as she patted Dudley’s cheek.</p><p>“But that’s less than last year!” Dudley’s large fist made the table shake like a leaf. Harry began to inhale his own food. It would be remiss to not have breakfast because the table broke form a Dudley-Dursley-Tantrum™.</p><p>“Oh, we’ll get two more when we go to the zoo today. Okay, pumpkin? How’s that?” aunt Petunia was quick to quell the brewing storm.</p><p>“Then I’ll have thirty… thirty…”</p><p>“Thirty-nine, dear.” Aunt Petunia continued stroking Dudley’s hair. Her cooing was interrupted by the shrill ring of the telephone.</p><p>Aunt Petunia tutted into mouth piece in the same tone she used to speak to all her gossip group. Her head bobbed and she hummed and hawed at the proper points in the conversation. She then thanked the caller and hung-up the phone.</p><p>“Bad news, Vernon, Mrs. Figg can’t take care of the boy. She broke her leg and had to go to hospital.” Vernon scowled at his nephew with a frown so deep that Harry was afraid his face would get stuck in the hideous expression.</p><p>“He’s ruining my birthday, Mommy!” The tantrum returned full force with added wailing and sobbing.</p><p>Harry tried very hard to not roll his eyes and kept his mouth shut for the moment. He also scooted as far away from the table lest it gave out under the chubbier boy’s hits.</p><p>“Why not just leave him in the park? He stays there often enough as it is.” Uncle Vernon sniffed turning back to the newspaper and that was that. Harry would rather spend the day amongst his friends instead of in a cabbage smelling living room listening to a horde of bickering cats.</p>
