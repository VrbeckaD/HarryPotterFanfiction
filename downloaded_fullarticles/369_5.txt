          <div class="userstuff"><p>I strip my Harry bare, insistently pulling and tugging at each item of clothing. </p><p>I take my time, unravelling each knot and slipping each tiny button through its hole. I like how unsure Harry is without his layers of protection. Without his Order of Merlin and his woollen Auror’s robes he’s just a regular wizard, with the same insecurities and worries as the rest of us. </p><p>There’s freedom to Harry’s vulnerability; liberation from those pressures that ripple thought every moment of my lover’s life. </p><p>“Beside you... This is my safe place,” Harry murmurs.</p><p>I pull him into a frantic kiss.</p></div>
