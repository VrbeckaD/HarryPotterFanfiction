    <p>CHAPTER 1 </p><p>Hogwarts, school of witchcraft and wizardry and typically romance. Of course, what else would you expect when you put teenagers all in a single huge boarding school. It is a recipe for destruction. And the story that is being told here, is exactly one of those stories, I’ll try not to bore you.<br/>
My name is Olivia Zabini and this is my love story that I never knew would happen. It was my first year in Hogwarts, I am the youngest of my family of 5, my oldest sister, Mirianna Zabini is married into a pureblood family, my second sibling, Petriet Zabini, he is working as an auror and is to be married to another pureblood. Then there is my other two siblings, Harriet and Gimley Zabini, the twins, they are in their third year at Hogwarts. I still remember first meeting him… well, them actually, two noisy ginger heads. I instantly knew they were trouble and decided to stay away but as it turned out, i did exactly the opposite.<br/>
As my name was called to be sorted, and I sat at that chair, all I could think about was my how my whole family has been sorted into Slytherin, I did want to make them proud but when I saw how they behaved at their tables, it was more like those high class dinner parties that my mother held just to show off and they were obviously no fun. Ravenclaw’s just had their faces in their books completely oblivious to anything except that in their books. Gryffindor’s on the other hand, they were so lively and it looked like a party constantly. The Hufflepuff’s looked timid. My mind was in shambles. While I was having an inner battle with myself, I almost didn’t hear the hat shout Gryffindor. I don’t know what made me sigh in relief but I did. After the sorting, I started making a few friends. A girl named Lucinda Lovegood, who was as pretty as the first sunlight was an exotic girl, she had all these fantasies about mythical creatures. Even though other people thought she was weird and crazy, I found her exciting. Then there was a muggleborn girl named Aurora Little, she was like a breath of fresh air, always ecstatic and friendly. As we were talking, a sound of a plate and cup clanging on the floor was sounding throughout the hall. The origin none other than the Gryffindor table, when I looked to see who did it, it was those two ginger heads again but this time I really got a good look at them, they were identical.</p>
