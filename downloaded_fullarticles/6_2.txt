    <p>The hall was blood stained, crimson and brown. The colours of fresh and drying blood intermingled on the walls and floors creating an almost delicate pattern decorating the great Hall. Furniture demolished and the silver strewn in odd places across the floors, only added to the tableaux. His followers clad in black and silver lined the walls almost haphazardly watching the already bound and beaten "defenders of Hogwarts". Or the mad man's murder as his lover so often called them.<br/>The black haired, emerald eyed man strolled slowly through the carnage paying no mind to the destruction as he did so. His attention focused on the wretches kneeling before the dias. His followers had a morbid sense of humour that was certain. That or this was Tom's doing. He always had the flair for dramatics.<br/>Facing towards the head table none of the defenders had any idea who was approaching them. Just that they were important enough that their entrance silenced their captors, Harry smiled.</p><p>"headmaster, I would offer you a seat but it seems as though you are a little tied up at the moment" as he spoke he came into view. The reaction was instantaneous, the Weasley matriarch screeched her disappointment whilst their youngest begged for release. Granger screeches joined the fray whilst Ronalds recriminations scatter through the cacophony of noise. Dumbledore however was the one who held Harryâ€™s attention. He remained silent in his shock. Silent, pale and old as he stared at him. Without a word or wand Harry merely raised a hand to silence the rabble, much to their horror . Slowly he made his way across the dias until he seated himself on the head masters chair across from the leader of the light.</p><p>Harry waited a moment relaxed back in his seat, never breaking the old man's gaze, Dumbledore broke it first gazing behind him probably taking in his entourage properly for the first time. When his gaze found Severus' form his face only shifted slightly, not unsurprised but also not all knowing. Snape had always been difficult to pin down after all Harry thought wryly. However when his gaze took in the other man stood to his right his breath stuttered. He instantly recognised him of course and his gaze met Harrys in anger. Harry merely smiled innocently at him.</p><p>"Oh my boy what have you done?"</p><p>Harry cocked his head much as a child would when facing a question with an obvious answer.</p><p>"Fulfilling the prophecy headmaster, just as you wanted" Harry laughed at the incredulous expression on the man's face. "well perhaps not exactly as you wanted but still."</p><p>The man still looked at him in confusion though his eyes were still tinged with rage. It felt good to dispel the usual optimistic twinkle.</p><p>"Oh headmaster the fact that it has come to this is mildly outstanding, I mean I would applaud your tenacity if it hadn't cost the blood of so many magicals. " Harry slighted before leaning forward in his seat, anger settling into his gaze.</p><p>"You remember how it goes don't you Dumbledore" he asked rhetorically.</p><p>"The one with the power to vanquish the dark Lord approaches", Harry began in a slow deep cadence," born as the seventh month dies and the dark Lord will mark him as his equal" Harry sat back in his seat with a dramatic sigh, his gaze lifting to the star filled ceiling.<br/>"Of course it was me, you knew it was me from the moment I was marked. the one with the power to rival the dark Lord at the age of 15 months" Harry stared back down at the man before him.<br/>"The funny thing about prophecies headmaster is that they are never meant to be understood until they are fulfilled. But you so arrogant in your knowledge and power did not see what was right under your nose." Leaning forward once more Harry met Dumbledore's confused glare with a small smile on his lips.<br/>"At fifteen months old I had the power equal to the most powerful wizard of his generation. " Harry's smile widened almost maniacally, "it said nothing as to what I would grow into"</p>
