<p>Charm and Circumstance</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Stomach grumbling, Harry rolled over, freezing when his hand encountered someone. A naked, <i>male</i> someone. </p>
<p>“Good morning,” they said, and Harry’s eyes popped open. Gobsmacked, he stared at Draco Malfoy, who was lounging next to him looking relaxed and very…smug. </p>
<p>“Malfoy?!”</p>
<p>Malfoy smirked. “Are you thinking what I’m thinking?”</p>
<p>“I’m…not sure,” said Harry. </p>
<p>Malfoy hummed. “I’m thinking it’s about time you succumbed to my charms.”</p>
<p>“I…did?” </p>
<p>Malfoy’s smirk deepened. “Most definitely.” He raised an eyebrow. “You don’t remember?”</p>
<p>Harry bit his lip. “If I say no, will you remind me how it happened?”</p>
<p>Malfoy grinned. “Why not?”</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Malfoy moved quickly, straddling Harry, whose mouth went dry at the predatory look in his eyes. “I…thought we were going to talk?” </p>
<p>“There are many ways of talking, Potter.” Malfoy trailed a finger lightly over Harry’s chest. “I plan to do this my way.” </p>
<p>“Right,” Harry whispered. “Go on, then.” </p>
<p>Malfoy licked his lips. “You remember the pub?” </p>
<p>A memory flickered in Harry’s mind. Dark pub…laughter…bumping into Malfoy…the instant, heated attraction— “Vaguely.” He frowned. “Hold on, wasn’t it…Muggle?”</p>
<p>Malfoy shrugged. “Muggle pubs have their charms.”  </p>
<p>“Okay.” Harry groaned as Malfoy’s erection grazed his thigh. “Continue.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Malfoy’s thumb caressed Harry’s nipple. “We encountered each other, and, miraculously, didn’t hex each other.”</p>
<p>Harry raised an eyebrow. “Why didn't your friends hex me?” </p>
<p>Malfoy grinned. “Too drunk, as were yours.”</p>
<p>That probably explained why Hermione hadn’t sent Aurors looking for him yet. “Who propositioned whom?” </p>
<p>“You charmingly propositioned me, I agreed, we came here.” </p>
<p>“Your flat?” asked Harry. </p>
<p>Malfoy inclined his head. </p>
<p>“Okay.” Malfoy’s thumb was slowly driving Harry mad. “But why’d you say yes?” </p>
<p>Malfoy shrugged. “Why not?” </p>
<p>“Because you hate me?” </p>
<p>“I don’t, but even if I did, Potter, what’s that have to do with sex?” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Harry rolled his eyes. “Charming.” </p>
<p>Malfoy chuckled. “I try.” </p>
<p>“No, but seriously—”</p>
<p>“I am being serious,” said Malfoy. “Haven’t you ever had hate sex? It’s brilliant.” </p>
<p>“Is that what we had last night?” </p>
<p>An odd look crossed Malfoy’s face. “Interestingly, no. It seemed surprisingly hate-free.” </p>
<p>“Okay.” Harry shifted, biting back a groan as Malfoy’s cock slid lightly against his. </p>
<p>Malfoy, clearly noticing his reaction, smirked. “Would you like a refresher of how it went last night?” </p>
<p>“Yes,” Harry whispered.</p>
<p>Humming, Malfoy moved down Harry’s body until his mouth was just over his cock. Then, grinning mischievously, he licked the tip.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>All Harry’s breath escaped in a rush. “So…you teased me, is that it?” </p>
<p>Mouthing Harry’s cock, Malfoy smiled. “I’d never do that,” he murmured, and in a swift move, swallowed Harry to the root. </p>
<p>Hot pleasure engulfed Harry, who arched up into that wicked mouth that was coaxing moans and whimpers from him. “Malfoy,” he gasped, his hips trembling. “Fuck!” </p>
<p>Pulling off, Malfoy shifted, kissing him. “I rode you last night,” he whispered against Harry’s mouth. “And I can’t wait to do it again.” </p>
<p>“Fuck,” Harry whispered, his cock <i>flexing</i> at the thought.</p>
<p>“Charming. Is that a yes?” </p>
<p>“Yes!” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Watching Malfoy prepare himself was…Groaning, Harry began counting the tiles on the ceiling rather than watch him. </p>
<p>“Like what you see?” Malfoy asked, his hips shifting as he twisted his fingers inside his hole. “Can’t say I blame you. I’ve many charms.” </p>
<p>Harry’s hands fisted so he wouldn’t touch him. “So I see.” </p>
<p>“You <i>can</i> touch me, you know,” said Malfoy after a few moments. “It’s allowed.” </p>
<p>Harry slid his hands up Malfoy’s thighs. “Fuck,” he whispered. </p>
<p>“Soon,” Malfoy promised. He pulled out three fingers, then grasped Harry’s cock and, after positioning it, <i>sat down</i>. </p>
<p>“Fucking hell,” wheezed Harry. </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Malfoy’s hole squeezed every thought from Harry. And when he began taking all of him, began <i>bouncing</i>, Harry barely clung to sanity as he stared at the beautiful creature impaling himself on him. </p>
<p>Head thrown back, Malfoy was gorgeous, all lithe muscle and pale skin.</p>
<p>Malfoy’s eyes opened, and he eyed Harry, a small smirk on his face. “Charming. Planning to help, or must I do all the work, Potter?” </p>
<p>That was it. Howling, Harry sat up, toppling Malfoy onto his back. Ramming himself as deep as he could, Harry fucked Malfoy as if both their lives depended on it.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Harry came hard, emptying himself inside Malfoy with a shout before collapsing. </p>
<p>Malfoy had to have come at some point, since his dick was resting limply between them, but Harry honestly couldn’t recall when. Next time he’d pay more attention. </p>
<p>“Next time?” murmured Malfoy. “You really have succumbed to my charms, haven’t you?” </p>
<p>“I said that out loud?” Harry groaned. </p>
<p>Malfoy laughed. “You did. It was most embarrassing. Good thing you have your own charms to recommend you.”</p>
<p>“I do?” </p>
<p>Malfoy snorted. “You think I let anyone stay until morning?” </p>
<p>Harry smiled. “So…breakfast?” </p>
<p>Malfoy hummed. “Thought you’d never ask.” </p>
