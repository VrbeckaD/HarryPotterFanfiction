  <em>          This cannot be happening. I already presented, this shouldn't be possible. I can take care of myself!! I don't want to be dependent on someone else!! Okay, calm down. I'm sure this is just a temporary glitch. Come on Tom, you need to hide this from your followers until it goes away. After all, we can't have them thinking their master is a child. That wouldn't help at all.</em>
</p><p>          Tom Marvolo Riddle paced back and forth in his bedroom at Riddle Manor. He had dismissed most of his followers after that annoying boy had escaped during his resurrection. He kept the inner circle behind for a bit longer to discuss what had been happening while he was... indisposed and the plan for going forward. Now he was finally alone. He had been feeling a bit...well, the only word to describe it was needy, ever since his resurrection. He had read plenty of books and he knew what this weird feeling usually meant but he just couldn't accept it. For one thing he had already presented as a dominant when he was seventeen. There was a multitude of other reasons such as, everyone presented at seventeen and nobody had ever presented at a different age. Also, he didn't think he needed to be taken care of and the only people that feel this way when they present are in desperate need of care and affection. In general, he just flat out refused to think about the fact that he kept having these urges to act like a little. He would need to do more research about this subject before making any decisions.</p><p>...........LINE BREAK...........</p><p>     Severus and Lucius apparated to Malfoy Manor together. Talking quietly they headed toward Lucius's study. After they both sat down with a drink, Severus voiced what they were both thinking.</p><p>    "Did it seem to you like the Dark Lord was different tonight? He seemed distacted and much quieter than he was before his return."</p><p>     Lucius nodded. "It didn't look like he was paying attention to the reports at all. I can't believe I'm saying this but if I didn't know that he was the Dark Lord I would have said he looked like he was about to have a panic attack. He doesn't strike me as that type of person but he was definitely freaking out about something."</p><p>     Severus thought about that for a few minutes before replying. "You're right that he's definitely not the type to freak out easily. I wonder whats happened that has him so tense? We haven't gone on any raids or anything and he only got back three hours ago. What could possibly have happened to make him act like that? Do you think he knows something we don't? I wonder if we should check on him? Maybe something went wrong with the resurrection ritual. You know he would never tell us if something was wrong no matter how much pain he was in. We'll probably get screamed at and maybe crucioed but maybe we should check on him anyway? Just in case somethings wrong? What if...!"</p><p>     "Severus!! Calm down, little brother. Your inner caretaker is coming out. Our Lord will most likely not be happy to be on the recieving end of those types of thoughts. I doubt his reaction will be kind. But I know you and I know that you won't stop worrying that something is wrong until you see for yourself that all is well. Therefore, I will go with you to see Our Lord but first you must calm yourself. I don't particularly wish to be crucioed tonight so while you're calming down we should think of a good reason for why we came back after Our Lord clearly dismissed us."</p><p>.....Meanwhile at Riddle Manor.....</p><p>     Smirking viciously to himself, Walden MacNair quietly opened the door of the room he was hiding in. Now that everyone had left he could figure out what was going on. The Dark Lord had been acting strange and he was going to figure out why. Slipping through the door he headed toward the stairs knowing that was where Lord Voldemort was most likely to be. After going through a few different rooms and finding them empty, he came upon the library. At first, he assumed that this room was empty as well but then he heard it. There was a very soft breathing coming from a corner of the room that was hidden behind some bookshelves. Slipping around the edge of the shelf he grinned evilly at what he saw. This was just perfect. He could take advantage of this.</p><p>     Laying curled up in a ball on a sofa was the Dark Lord. Now this in itself wasn't exactly normal. The Dark Lord wasn't big on making himself vulnerable in public. However, the biggest giveaway was that he was hugging a pillow as he slept and his thumb was seated firmly in his mouth being sucked on.</p><p>     MacNair knew exactly what this meant. He was a little. And any and all possessions or titles belonging to a little automatically reverted to their guardian when the little was claimed. If he could claim the Dark Lord then he would automatically be in charge of the Death Eaters, he would recieve a position of power, plus he would get all of the Dark Lords properties and money, which, being the heir of slytherin, was quite a bit. Having made up his mind, MacNair started towards the little.</p><p>     Tom didn't want to wake up. He was having such a peaceful dream and this was the best rest he had gotten in a long time. But whoever this idiot was wouldn't leave him alone! "No." He mumbled. "Don't wanna get up." The shaking got rougher. Eventually he got used to it and was almost back asleep until he was roughly thrown on the floor. Suddenly wide awake, he sat up in alarm. What was going on? Looking up he saw the hideous face of Walden MacNair hovering over him.<em> Eeew. No one wants to wake up to that.</em> Shaking himself he tried to get his thoughts back in order. What was MacNair doing here?</p><p>     His question was answered as MacNair spoke. "Wakey wakey your highness. In a shocking turn of events, it seems like Mr. high and mighty is a little." Laughing maniacally, he continued. "And of course, everyone knows that a little needs a mommy or a daddy. And because I'm such a nice person," more creepy laughter, "I've decided that I'm gonna be your daddy!! As MacNair advanced toward the little, Tom was internally freaking out. Scooting backwards he tried to put as much distance as possible between them.<em> Calm, I need to stay calm. I can't drop here. As long as I don't drop, he can't claim me. Oh God, what am I going to do?</em></p>
