    <p>“Lily,” Severus begged. “You don’t have to do this.”</p>
<p>	Lily ignored him and laced her boots tightly. “Too late, Sev. And isn’t this what you wanted?”</p>
<p>	“An agreement, yes. But there’s been rumors about you wanting -”</p>
<p>	Lily rolled her eyes and walked towards the door. “I’m not going to marry him. He’s a king without a spine and a coward for not changing anything.” She pulled the door open and began walking quickly, Severus following close behind. “I don’t like rioting anymore than the next person and I want to stop it.”</p>
<p>	“Lily, you can’t just leave the Order! What if he offers you money, or safety for the rest of your life?”</p>
<p>	She turned quickly and he bumped into her. “I’m <em>not</em> going to ditch my people, Sev. But nothing we have done has made a difference, so it's time to try diplomacy.” She wondered if he remembered that was what she had wanted to do in the first place and that it was him who had convinced her that it wouldn’t work. And now, after two months of protests and another month of rallies turned riots, Lily was desperate to try anything new after weeks of unsuccess. So, as one of the leaders of the rebellion, she had agreed to meet with King James, the new ruler of Italy. </p>
<p>	The rebellion had originally started with a small group, just a few people speaking up against their current rulers. Everyday, Lily had seen families torn apart because of poverty, corrupt police using their power for revenge and wealth. She was sick of getting unequal pay, sick of the rich that didn’t care, sick of violence in the streets, sick of children crying of hunger. At that point, Lily was already part of the Order, a select group that targeted petty crimes, but she was so sick of the corruption that she had joined the rebellion believing that slowly but surely they were going to fix her country.</p>
<p>	It didn’t take them long to reach the main gate to enter the Palace from her apartment. A guard checked her for weapons, removing a knife from her belt and then escorted her through a series of hallways. When they reached the doors of the throne room, Severus stayed in the main hall, a deep scowl on his face. He was tall and lanky, always wearing a hooded black jacket and baggy brown pants, preferring to blend in. His hair was shiny and just long enough to reach the tips of his ears. He never combed it, preferring to leave it in a mess around his eyes, and today it seemed to hide his face especially well. </p>
<p>	The guard led her to a pair of large oak doors, where even more guards joined them. When she entered, a man was standing next to a desk, reading a pile of worn papers. The guards bowed, but Lily instead crossed her arms and moved to stand across from the desk. As the man waved the guards to the side, Lily took a moment to observe his sharp jawline, dotted with wisps of stubble, before returning to stare at him in his entirety. He looked younger than she expected. Although she knew they were the same age, his father had aged rather quickly under the pressures of the job and she had assumed the new King would look similar. Instead, the new King was tall and well built, with curly black hair falling to his ears.  </p>
<p>	Lily, on the other hand, was tall, but King James was much taller than her and much broader. She had red hair pulled into two long braids that fell to the middle of her back and was wearing a long sleeve dark blue shirt half tucked into black pants and a leather jacket.</p>
<p>	“Lily Evans, the infamous leader of the rebellion.” He smirked as she stared him down, but his eyes, tired and red, gave his weariness away. “Please have a seat.”</p>
<p>	“King James.” She replied shortly, blatantly ignoring his request. “What have you been doing the past three months?” </p>
<p>His smirk slowly fell away and he sat, his leg bouncing up and down. “Violence is never a good option to change a system.”</p>
<p>Lily frowned. “You had plenty of time to act while things were peaceful.”</p>
<p>“We are working day and night to fix your many requests. I’m trying. Nothing can get done in such a short amount of time -”</p>
<p>“You’re not trying. If you were trying, you would have done something by now, not hiding inside, avoiding the problems of the citizens.” She sounded more disappointed than anything, arms crossed.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to speak, but she continued, arms crossed. “I’m not here to negotiate, your highness,” her mouth was dripping sarcasm, and his brow darkened. “I speak for the people, <em>your</em> people.”</p>
<p>“And you’re losing control of them.” </p>
<p>Now Lily was taken back. “Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“You’re losing control, Evans. I’ve seen you try to stop the riots, but they aren’t listening to you anymore. You’re desperate to get your power back.” He gripped the chair, and his eyes bored into her. </p>
<p>“You’re wrong. I don’t want power.” Her voice had a quiet, threatening edge.</p>
<p>“Then what do you want?”</p>
<p>“Equal pay. Cheaper taxes. Honest police.” She hesitated for a moment and then said firmly, “A democracy. That’s what we want.”</p>
<p>He met her eyes at this, and she stood up, pacing back and forth. “And what would you do, if you were me?”</p>
<p>She knew that his father died only two weeks ago, and if it counted for anything, she thought that a new, younger prince would maybe listen to reason. Severus had disagreed, convincing her to continue with the rallies. But maybe she had been right - he was willing to listen to their complaints, even if he was an ass about it. Potter looked at her imploringly before adding, “No one will just give up their power or money. It would be impossible to get rid of the current council. A new leader won’t change anything.”</p>
<p>“Then lower taxes on the poor, raise taxes on the rich. Make laws about child workplace safety, enforce equal pay between everyone, hire honest police who aren’t on a power trip. People are starving, and kids are dying.” </p>
<p>Potter nodded, seeming to agree, and Lily was taken back yet again. He reached into his desk and pulled out a piece of paper, smudged with ink.</p>
<p>She took it from his outstretched hand and read it quickly, eyes scanning the jumbled writing. When she looked up, he stood and walked closer to her. </p>
<p>“Will this be enough for you, your highness?” His mocking tone was evident, and it set her on edge.</p>
<p>Lily opened her mouth, angry and frustrated at his ignorance. “Will this be enough? Have you ever been outside these walls? Do you recognize how desperate we are to fix these problems we face <em>daily</em>? This doesn’t even cover half of it!” </p>
<p>A guard jumped forward, hand on his gun, but Potter turned and briskly ordered all the guards to leave the room. Lily was a little surprised, maybe things were worse at the Palace then she had originally suspected. If Potter trusted her, who was part of a rebellion, more than his guards, he clearly knew something was happening from inside the Palace. Once they leave, he turned to her, speaking quietly and urgently as if someone were listening. </p>
<p>“The council is around Lord Riddle’s finger. We - I strongly suspect Riddle is threatening them with something. Enough to make them only do what he wants. No new legislation will go through. Despite what the people might think, I don’t actually have the power to put in any laws, as much as I want to.”</p>
<p>“So put in new council members.”</p>
<p>He took the paper back from her, gripping it tightly. “I don’t have the power to.”</p>
<p>“Not by law. Potter - you’re the prince. Who do the guards take orders from?”</p>
<p>His jaw tightened, and he grunted. “It’s <em>King</em> James.”</p>
<p>Lily ignored him, a smile slowly forming on her face. “Fire one of the council members. One of the less important ones. Don’t raise suspicion at first. And if Riddle said you can’t, use the guards to your advantage. Throw him out in the street, hang him, throw him in jail for refusal to comply - but make a statement. Show your authority.”</p>
<p>	He glared at her. “I can do it myself. Your leadership hasn’t proven to be all that effective.”</p>
<p>	She shot him a look. “Not like your’s has been any better. At least I have the people’s support.” She sighed. “We’re on the same side. This is the only way to get anything done and you know it.”</p>
<p>Potter’s fists tightened and then he suddenly relaxed, with yet another smirk. “And I have Italy’s army at my command if you try to overthrow me.” He stood up, ignoring her last statement. “You are dismissed, Evans.”</p>
<p>Lily scowled and tossed her hair over her shoulder. “I’ll get everyone to back off. You have three days Potter before I expect progress. Or so help me I will throw you in the river myself.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two days later, news breaks that two of the council members, Malfoy and Carrow had been fired. Severus came to her flat, raging about how “those two were the only good people in the council”. He blamed it on Lily’s talk with Potter, which although true, hadn’t been something she’d actually discussed with Snape in advance. Lily blocked his anger out and wondered if Potter only did it to please her, or if he actually had the right intentions. Either way, she strongly agreed with Potter’s decision. But, Malfoy and Carrow were spineless council members, too afraid to make decisions themselves and dependent on Riddle’s advice. Firing them did next to` nothing. Nevertheless, the next day she walked back to the Palace, pushing aside the queries and questions thrown her way in the street.</p>
<p>As Lily reached the iron gates, a guard stopped her, hand on the hilt of his gun. Lily just crossed her arms in defiance. “I’m here to see Potter.” </p>
<p>The guard, eyed her up and down, making her wait outside while another was sent to inform the king of her arrival. It was Potter himself, who opened the gate a few minutes later, pulling her inside quickly. </p>
<p>They wound through the spacious halls, four guards staying close behind them. When they reached his office, he dismissed his guards again and waited until the door shut before he spoke. “Was that good enough for you?” His voice was stressed. His desk was messy, and there was a half eaten lunch on a free corner of the desk.  </p>
<p>“It’s a start. But maybe someone else could do better.”</p>
<p>He met her eyes, forehead creased. “I wish it could be someone else. Evans, if I’m not the leader, the only other possible option is Riddle.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t make sense.”</p>
<p>“The only thing that is stopping Riddle right now, or at least before I got rid of Malfoy and Carrow, was my family name. Before the riots, it was more respected obviously -” Lily stepped forward angrily, but he waved his arms and continued. “I couldn’t give a rat’s nest about my family name, but half the people support your rebellion, and the other half are on Riddle’s side. I know you think I’m bad, but I’m not as bad as him.”</p>
<p>“What’s your point?” </p>
<p>“My point is… look, I know Malfoy and Carrow weren’t even that big of a score for your side. Our side. But if I make changes all at once, I’ll overplay my hand and Riddle will respond in full force. We have to move slowly so we don’t raise suspicion and keep Riddle out of power. ”</p>
<p>“So you’re saying that you're the last thing stopping Riddle from taking over?”</p>
<p>	He nodded. </p>
<p>	“And if Riddle takes over, we can’t win the throne back?”</p>
<p>	He nodded again. “His followers would all come out of hiding. My sources say there are more than we originally thought.”</p>
<p>	Lily took a second to think. “How much do you trust your guards? You said you had the army behind you, but how many are loyal to you over Riddle ?”</p>
<p>	His gaze faltered. “Three men.”</p>
<p>	“Three? That’s it?” </p>
<p>	“Three that I absolutely trust with my life. Two are my personal guards. The other is the Captain of the army. I have more that I trust but...”</p>
<p>	“And you’re sure -”</p>
<p>	“I can trust them. With anything.” Potter interrupted quickly. </p>
<p>	“You need more than two guards to protect you.” He shrugged noncommittally and pushed around papers on his desk. Lily sighs. “I’ll send in two for now. Hide them in your room or set up shifts, or something. I can trust them. They’re loyal to me, so they’ll be loyal to you. If you get killed now, we’d have to completely start over.”</p>
<p>	He seemed angry at her forwardness, his eyes dark and hooded, but she pushed it aside and sat down, propping her feet on his desk, right next to his discarded crown. “So, what’s the next step?”</p>
<p>	Three days later, Payne and Greyback were both dismissed from the council, and a formal announcement was made to the public that “significant changes to benefit the people of Italy are in the works” and urged all citizens to “be patient”. </p>
<p>	Unfortunately, a few Riddle supporters protested, but only the bravest poked their heads out. Snape told Lily it was just a protest, but in a matter of minutes, shop windows are smashed in, two guards are lying in the street, most likely dead, and a small storage shed was on fire. The damage was minimal, but the intentions were clear.</p>
<p>	Severus returned with a cut on his lip, but Lily ignored him, slamming the door on her way out of the flat. She tried to stop him from going, but he instead of paying any attention to her, he cussed her out, so she refused to speak with him further. </p>
<p>	The day after, she sent in two of her best guards, Alice and Frank, as extra protection for James. Both were killed in a matter of hours after arriving, found lying dead in a pool of their own blood. </p>
<p>Despite the fact that they were some of her closest friends, Lily felt numb to their deaths. She didn’t have the luxury of mourning anymore; Her life was spent running around the city, and she barely ate or slept. She went to their funeral nonetheless, but sat, unable to cry or even feel anything. Alice Griffiths was strong, fiercely independent, and Frank Longbottom was her childhood friend and incredibly loyal. Together the three of them had made a perfect team, and they had worked together to dismantle several gangs when the police had failed to step in. </p>
<p>Lily spent her days running in between the Palace to the Order of the Phoenix headquarters. Only a select few knew of its existence, an underground organization designed to enforce the law where the police couldn’t - or wouldn’t, and fight back against Riddle’s reign of terror on the streets. Before, the relatively small gang led by Riddle supporters had never been a major problem because they tended to stick to drug deals and petty crimes. But recently, it had been gaining support from wealthy and powerful citizens, and there had been an increasing number of attacks on the lower class. At every attack, a grayed paper was tacked to the wall, depicting a snake protruding from the mouth of a skull. It quickly became known as the Dark Mark, and the men who put it up became known as the Death Eaters. Lily spent her nights working with Albus Dumbledore, the Order leader, to take down some of Riddle’s supporters. She had somehow become the face of the rebellion, inspiring hope in some and hate in others. </p>
<p>Three days after the protests began, Potter pushed through with his Equal Workers’ Rights Act, stating that there will be no discrimination against workers, male or female. It passes narrowly in the council, just barely scraping through between Potter’s and Riddle’s supporters. Lily visited the Palace the next day. </p>
<p>Potter looked tired and gaunt as she entered his office, a plate of untouched food sitting in front of him. There’s a stack of papers on the floor he’s sorting through, and he looked relieved when she walked through the door. He quickly changed it into a scowl, but Lily let herself feel a little relief at the sight of him as well.</p>
<p>They sat down and began discussing the next move, arguing back and forth, unable to reach a decision until Potter calls in two of his trusted friends, who Lily still hadn’t met.</p>
<p>They introduce themselves as Sirius Black, Peter Pettigrew, and Remus Lupin. Sirius stood slouched, charcoal hair falling in his eyes. Peter, shorter than the other two, wore a crisp uniform, and Remus was wearing a large jacket, fraying at the edges, hair neatly slicked back. </p>
<p>Lily explained the situation. “Everyone’s getting worried that we aren’t uniting the Kingdom. They’re worried that he - “ she pointed a finger at James, still frustrated, “- is just getting rid of the council members so he can become a dictator. Since you haven’t replaced all of the members yet -”</p>
<p>“- I can’t replace them yet - I don’t know if they’re loyal to me! I can’t just put someone in the position without making sure they aren’t under Riddle’s influence and yank them out again.”</p>
<p>“And you really have no one else you can trust? Just these two and one other?” Lily gestured towards Sirius and Remus, who were both watching with amused looks. </p>
<p>He glanced at them. “There are a few others. But -”</p>
<p>“Then do it! Put Lupin in if you need, but I’m sure he at least he has more spine than that Tuffet dunce you put in last time!”</p>
<p>“Fine. But maybe you should join as well, instead of just organizing violent protests with <em>Snivellus</em> every day.”</p>
<p>Lily took a step back, face pale. But it immediately hardened, and she stepped forward, an angry glint in her eye. “I do not want violence.”</p>
<p>“Then tell your <em>boyfriend</em> that.” He was spitting as he spoke, gesturing widely.</p>
<p>“He’s not my boyfriend. And he’s just trying to help.”</p>
<p>“Really, help? Stop defending a Riddle supporter, Evans.” He stepped back, crossing his arms. “Maybe I shouldn’t trust you after all.”</p>
<p>Remus tried to interject, grabbing Lily’s arm, but she threw him off, now in Potter’s face. Her voice was sharp, every word meant to bite. “One word from me and the city is against you.”</p>
<p>He pushed past her, walking around the desk. His face was red, and his fists were clenched tightly. “I’ll put in Peter to replace Greyback. And you can replace Carrow.” </p>
<p>Lily nodded curtly. Remus cleared his throat awkwardly, cutting through the tension in the room. They all turned it face him. “There’s a... law. It’s been around for centuries and it's a minor inconvenience, but it can only be changed by a King <em>and</em> Queen or with a public vote, although that could take ages and ages -”</p>
<p>“Spit it out Remus,” James said hotly.</p>
<p>He twisted his hands as he spoke. “Lily can’t be in the council unless she’s the Queen.”</p>
<p>“Because I’m a woman?” Lily said, rubbing her face tiredly. Remus nodded. “Unfortunately.”</p>
<p>Sirius spoke up. “Which means… they’d have to get married?”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately… yeah.”</p>
<p>Lily stared at Remus. “There’s no other option?”</p>
<p>He shrugged. “I’d have to check, but the law was pretty clear when it was made. No woman can be in the council unless they are royalty. It’s been around forever.”</p>
<p>Lily swung around to look at Potter, who was shoving his hands deep in his pockets. “Did you know this?”</p>
<p>He shook his head frantically. “No, and Evans, you don’t have to do it, I can find someone else.”</p>
<p>Sirius shook his head. “Who else could do it better than Evans?”</p>
<p>Lily glanced at James, and he met her gaze evenly. His eyes dropped briefly before meeting hers again. Ever so slightly, he nodded, and Lily nodded back. She turned back to Sirius and Remus and said, “If anything... it will unite the people.” </p>
<p>	Remus watched for a second and then frowned. “I’ll double check on the law just in case. Don’t start planning a wedding just yet.” He walked out of the room, leaving the others in silence. Sirius pulled James to the side, talking in a hushed tone, eventually coaxing a laugh out him. Lily sat on the other side of the room, eyes closed, trying to process what just happened. Never in her life would she have imagined that she would be married, so soon, to the King she hates. <em>This is not what I planned</em>, she thought miserably, knee bouncing restlessly. <em>I’m only nineteen - I shouldn’t be getting married.</em></p>
<p>	Remus walked in ten minutes later, holding a single book. He rubbed his forehead as Lily shot up, desperate for good news. He handed her the book, opening to a page near the back. “There’s only a paragraph about it, but in this case, you need a queen and king to change the law without the public’s input. And we don’t have one, so either way -”</p>
<p>	“-we have to get married.” </p>
<p>	Remus shrugged. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>	James stood up now, and he backed away. “I can’t - Evans, this isn’t fair -”</p>
<p>	Sirius stepped forward. “Mate, it’s can’t be that bad. Just for a year or two, until you can get things figured out. And then-”</p>
<p>	James slammed his fist into the wall, becoming angrier with every word. “If I can’t even lead a country on my own, how am I supposed to do it with a wife?”</p>
<p>	“Excuse me? You were fine with it earlier,” Lily interjected. </p>
<p>	“This is your fault! You just wanted the power in the first place - you did everything you could to get rid of the council members so that I would have to put you in, you knew about the law, don’t deny it!”</p>
<p>	“If I wanted your power, I could have killed you easily when you ordered the guards out.” Her face was red. “And there’s more than a few outside these walls that want to do exactly that.”</p>
<p>	“You keep saying that, but where’s your proof?”</p>
<p>	“My proof?” she asked mockingly. “Your approval ratings are tragically low because you still don’t have the guts to fix the real problem - Riddle! He’s attacking the lower class -”</p>
<p>	“At least I don’t use my newfound power to go for the throne and -” </p>
<p>	Sirius jumped between them as Lily tried to step at James, pushing James away. Remus pulled her back, rubbing her back to try to calm her down.</p>
<p>Lily pushed Remus to the side and stood tall, fists clenched. “I don’t want to marry you. You’re a chauvinistic pig who can’t see past the end of his own nose.”</p>
<p>She stormed out, outraged. Snape’s recent detachment, his growing farther and farther away from her, Potter’s crushing words, Riddle, and the loss of two of her friends, all seemed to be too much for her. She was so unbelievably tired and could barely muster up the energy to be angry.</p>
<p>It was Sirius who found her half an hour later, on a balcony hidden behind flowing drapes. The grey stones reflected the setting sun, and the ivy draped along the stones seemed to relax, fluttering in the lazy breeze. The gentle bustle of the city calmed her down as she watched in silence. </p>
<p>He sat next to her, observing her posture quietly. “Why didn’t you leave?”</p>
<p>When she didn’t answer, his voice grew stronger. “There’s a war coming, you know.”</p>
<p>She tilted her head back and laughed at the simple statement. Lily nodded. “I know. And maybe it was me who started it.”</p>
<p>“I doubt Lily Evans could have started all of this. This city has been waiting to blow for ages. You were just a catalyst. But… Why did you become the leader?”</p>
<p>She took a minute to think. “I wanted change, and I guess like I felt that I couldn’t do it fast enough as a follower. I feel like I’ve seen generations come and go without making improvements for those that come after.  I wanted to do something that actually had an impact. But now, I…”</p>
<p>“Might be remembered as Queen Evans, wife of King James.”</p>
<p>“And I don’t want to be remembered for just that! It’s not enough. Putting in laws through the council won’t do anything, it never has,” she said passionately.</p>
<p>“And if you could have it anyway, what would you do?”</p>
<p>“Overhaul the system completely. A democracy. Public votes. But first a completely new set of laws. If we just rewrite the ones we already have, some crap law will come up to bite us later. A new council, not just made of rich men, so businesses don’t have them in their pockets. And that’s just to start.”</p>
<p>“What about James?”</p>
<p>Her voice was bitter. “I’ll marry him, if that’s what you're asking.”</p>
<p>“You know what I meant.”</p>
<p>Lily sighed. “I… he’s a prat, idiotic, selfish, and unreasonable. But… he’s trying, I guess.”</p>
<p>He snorted. “He tries so hard to please everyone. He’s a good friend, not a leader. At least, not yet.”</p>
<p>“He’s getting better.”</p>
<p>Sirius stared at her oddly for a second. “So what’s the plan, Evans?”</p>
<p>Lily squared her shoulders. “Plan a wedding.”</p>
<p>They planned for the wedding to take place in two weeks time. They don’t mention anything about love and avoid confirming rumors about uniting the public and the royalty. The  Death Eaters were becoming more emboldened every day. Shops were closing earlier and earlier, and no one met each other’s gaze on the street. The Order was struggling to keep up; without having a spy on the other side they can’t seem to get ahead of the death eaters. </p>
<p>When she told Severus about the wedding, he destroyed her room, tossing books around, screaming and cursing Potter’s name. She tried to talk him out of it, even get him to come with her, but he swung his fist and that night, she returned to the Palace with a bag of clothing and a swollen eye. She hid her fear at his actions, but at the same time was too afraid to even return to her apartment. Dorcas, her longtime friend and roommate, had helped Lily move out. Snape was starting to scare her more than she cared to admit. Something in him had changed, and he wasn’t the same anymore.</p>
<p>Her eye healed in time for the wedding, but frankly, Lily couldn’t have cared less about what she looked like. Anne, her maid, helped Lily plan the wedding but had refused to let her wear a jacket and boots and forced her into a simple white dress, with embroidered blue flowers around the edges. James wore a formal suit but glared at her as she took her place next to him. </p>
<p>“You look nervous,” he hissed.</p>
<p>“You look atrocious,” she whispered back, and Remus nudged her as the priest looked at her expectantly. </p>
<p>They kissed briefly, exchanged rings, Sirius clapped loudly, and then they go to the ballroom, decorated with heaps of flowers and bouquets. Lily insisted that they invite not just council members and royalty, but also citizens to help show a more united kingdom. Before the night was even halfway over, three fights started, and Lily personally broke up two arguments between council members. Sirius ordered the guards to gently see everyone home, and Remus dragged Lily and James out of the room, shoving them into the hallway, alone. </p>
<p>Lily couldn’t meet his eyes, while James couldn’t seem to take his eyes off her. But she didn’t see it, silently following him to the bedroom, a grand room decorated in red and gold. Despite having been to the Palace numerous times, she’d never been inside. Her possessions were lying on one side of the bed, no doubt set out by servants. </p>
<p>“Evans, I’m -”</p>
<p>“I didn’t -” They started talking at the same time, and stopped abruptly. James grabbed a pillow and threw it on the couch. “I’ll take the couch.”</p>
<p>Lily brushed by him and headed into the bathroom to change, the silence cutting through her like a searing knife. Never in her life had she imagined her wedding day, but if she had, she would not have thought it would be like this. Not so full of tension, or disappointment.</p>
<p>She didn’t fall asleep until long past midnight, only minutes before the sun rose, listening to James’ deep breathing and quiet snores. It’s almost comforting to know that at least one of them was alright, at least for the moment. </p>
<p>Lily woke up as James shuffled into the bathroom the next morning, and quickly changed before he comes out. She slipped out before he could, running into three dead ends before getting to the dining hall for breakfast. Her inability to navigate the majestic castle allows him to beat her there, but he doesn’t say anything, which somehow made it worse.<br/>
After lunch, she attended her first council meeting, arriving with nothing in her hands, and leaving with bleeding palms from clenched fists. </p>
<p>Late that night, Remus pulled her into the kitchen and cleaned her hands without saying a word, but his eyes were filled with worry.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>She merely leaned her head on his shoulder for a minute in response, and then stood up, “Get some sleep. You’re looking a little pale.” </p>
<p>He watched as she left, shoulders tall, with no trace of pain on her face. Remus and Lily had become good friends since she had begun making frequent trips to the Palace, but she was still afraid to show any emotion or pain, and he couldn’t figure out why. </p>
<p>Lily returned to the bedroom with her bandaged hands to find James hunched over a pile of papers on his desk, tongue poking between his teeth. She hesitated for a moment, sensing his frustration before grabbing her work and moving to the couch. Lily was still trying to catch up on all of the rules and specific laws that had been mentioned in the council meeting, as well as refresh herself on all of the current issues. Her eyes shut against her will, and her head fell back against the couch. </p>
<p>When she woke up the next morning, she was lying in bed, with a nightgown on, curled around a pillow. As she registered her change in location groggily, she blushed angrily and shot up, pulling the blanket up to cover her. She grabbed the closest pillow and chucked it at his head, and it hit dead on. </p>
<p>“Potter! I can’t believe you had the audacity, you scoundrel - “</p>
<p>He jumped up from the couch, and she barely registered that he wasn’t wearing a shirt before he began waving his hands frantically, “No, no, Evans, I would never, I had a maid come and help you, I wasn’t even in the room -”</p>
<p>Lily crossed her arms and glared at him for a second, doing everything she can to avoid looking at his toned, tan chest. She grabbed a book and smacked his shoulder. “I was supposed to sleep on the couch tonight!”</p>
<p>He rolled his eyes. “I’m fine on the couch, and I couldn’t let you lay like that anyways. You’d get a crick in your neck and be even more grouchy.”</p>
<p>  Lily huffed and threw the book on the couch. “We can take turns. I’m shorter anyway, it’ll be more comfortable for me than you with your gangly legs.”</p>
<p>He shrugged and walked to the bathroom, running a hand through his mussed hair. Lily couldn’t help but think that he didn’t actually have gangly legs, in fact, they were well built. <em>Yes, well built, she told herself. I can think that of anyone, can’t I?</em></p>
<p>Two weeks passed, and more council members were replaced. After every announcement, Riddle becomes angrier and angrier. Potter tried to ignore his frustration, until Riddle, sitting directly across from him, slammed a fist onto the table. </p>
<p>	“Just because you are the king now, doesn’t mean you get full authority. You don’t get to become a dictator,” he hissed, his eyes flashing dangerously. “Mark my words, Potter, you and your slave will rue the day -”</p>
<p>	“Excuse me?” Potter spat, standing up, fists clenched. </p>
<p>	Lily placed a hand on his shoulder and pulled him down, not willing to get in a fight, but also defensive. “I am not a slave, Riddle. I have my own free will, and I could take you out faster than you can say death eater.”</p>
<p>	If the room wasn’t quiet before, it was eerily silent now. Riddle sat down slowly, a slight smile on his face, and his fingers clenched together. He gestured to the other council members, who mostly avoided his harsh gaze. “If, that’s what you think, <em>Miss Evans</em>, then you have made an enemy of me.”</p>
<p>	Potter tried to stand up again, but Lily forced him back down. “Then take it up with me later. Not now, when you’re wasting our country’s time.”</p>
<p>	Lily sat back down, and tried to focus as Remus begins to speak. Sirius gently squeezed her leg under the table, but Potter wouldn’t look at her. </p>
<p>	When the meeting was over, Lily was beyond frustrated. On every single point that she had made, Potter contradicted her, arguing back and forth over every single number and word. By the time it was over, nothing had been accomplished, and Lily was seething. She stormed out quickly, afraid of blowing up in front of the others. </p>
<p>James turned left once he exits, and Lily followed him back to the room. The instant the door was shut behind her, she began yelling. </p>
<p>“What the hell was that Potter? You couldn’t get over your hatred for one second to get one thing done today?”</p>
<p>“You were arguing too! That wasn’t just me. You know damn well that -” his hands were fisting in his hair.</p>
<p>“I cannot <em>believe</em> that you wasted an entire meeting because you were angry that I made you sit down.”</p>
<p>“Oh, so it’s my fault? You just told Riddle to screw himself, and then told him to come find you outside of the meeting. Do you know how dangerous that is? What were you even thinking?” He yelled, and shoved the books off his desk and onto the ground, causing papers to fly everywhere.</p>
<p>“You didn’t have to get mad at me for that - I was defending myself!”</p>
<p>“And I was trying to do that too! And -”</p>
<p>“You were doing a great job of it,” Lily said sarcastically.</p>
<p>“- maybe in a way that wouldn’t get yourself killed. Did you ever take a second to think about that Evans?”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” she said through gritted teeth, “if you would have just let me speak in the meeting, I wouldn’t have to do that. Or if you actually had the balls to get rid of Riddle!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, your plan has gotten us absolutely nowhere. It’s you who doesn’t have the guts to go through with it. We need a different plan, and your head is too far up your arse to see it -”</p>
<p>“Oh, back off, at least I have some common sense-”</p>
<p>“You’ve practically SCREWED US ALL OVER AGAIN!” He threw his hands up.</p>
<p>“Again? What’s that supposed to mean?” Lily’s face was red, and she paced around the room.</p>
<p>“You mucked up everything when we got married.” His voice was hoarse, and a hand was in his hair again.</p>
<p>“I DID?” She shouted incredulously. “NOT YOU?”</p>
<p>“You just wanted power Ginger, and I was just too blind to see it. You never had plans to even cooperate, you just wanted to push your agenda on me so you could take over. You weren’t important enough in your other life, so you had to come ruin mine.”</p>
<p>	“You’re doing a fantastic job of ruining your own life, so far, <em>Potter</em>,” she spat. “The council would be a mess without me, and you know it. You can’t control a darn thing, and I’m the only thing keeping you afloat right now.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	His chest was heaving, his mouth half open as he stared in shock. Lily ripped open the door. “You’re just an arrogant toerag Potter. No one in their right mind would ever <em>want</em> to marry you.”</p>
<p>	She slammed the door, and strode down the hallway, tears streaming down her face. She stumbled down a back set of stair, and down into the training grounds. Head lowered, she runs laps around the dusty track, tears dried and legs burning. She doesn’t stop until she almost collapses, falling into an expanse of green grass, chest heaving and she can’t see straight. Sweat pours down her, and everything’s spinning. She couldn’t think - and that was the whole point. </p>
<p>	When she finally recovered, the sunlight was nearly gone, she’s exhausted, and her legs are so tired she can’t walk properly. As she entered the bedroom, one hand braced against the wall, she saw Sirius standing in the middle of the room, laughing uproariously at something Potter had said, who was sprawled over the bed. Sirius calmed to a smirk as she brushed past him. </p>
<p>	“You don’t look too good Evans.”</p>
<p>	“I’m fine.” She wrenched the bathroom door open and stripped off her clothes. She let the water run over her fingers for a second before slipping underneath the cool stream of water. When Lily finally stepped out half an hour later, she wrapped herself in a towel and exited the steamy room. Sirius was still there, and whistled as she walked through the room towards the closet. </p>
<p>	“Nice legs there, Evans.”</p>
<p>	She winked and then flipped him off, tossing her dark, wet hair over her shoulder, and opened the closet. When she emerged dressed in a loose blue tunic a few minutes later, Sirius was gone, and James was pointedly facing away from her. She grabbed a pillow and tossed it onto the couch, too tired to even think. The tension in the room was thick, and she could hear him slowly rustling around as he went to bed. Her eyelids closed before she could stop them, and she fell into a dark sleep. </p>
<p>
  <em>She was standing on a cliff, overlooking a black ocean. The waves crashed against the rocks and the breeze carried droplets to her face, searing her skin where they landed. She turned her back from the ocean to see a long valley, with mounds of dirt scattered throughout. She broke into a run, weaving through the piles. Two piles started to move at the same time, slowly at first. Alice emerged, face hollow and shaking off dirt, and then Frank, who’s missing an eye and blonde hair is now replaced with matted black hair. They started to turn in a slow circle around her, but she couldn’t seem to run out of the circle. She tripped and fell, catching herself on a mound, and Alice and Frank were looming over her, reaching, pleading -</em>
</p>
<p>Potter was standing over her, arms folded, and brow furrowed. “You scream in your sleep,” He said crossly.</p>
<p>	Lily pushed him away, eyes bleary with sleep. Sweat dripped from her brow and she could feel her heart pulsing rapidly in her chest, aching to get free. Her dreams were always dark, haunting her even in the daytime, but last night, it had seemed especially real. Alice had once told her that she talked in her sleep, although she usually could forget about it the next morning. But this time, her dream was of Alice and Frank, once her two biggest comforts. She shuddered to even think of it, and straightened her back. <em>Today wouldn’t be the day she would give into her nightmares.</em> Lily tossed her hair in a braid and changed quickly before grabbing a bite from the kitchens, never having felt quite so alone as she did now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	A week had passed and things had still not improved between the married couple. They completely ignored each other now, only exchanging words that strictly concerned business. The council meetings were more productive, and nights in the bedroom were silent. Sometimes James didn’t come back at night, and Lily never asked any questions. Remus, Peter and Sirius had become her close friends in the Palace, although Peter was often away on assignment. The four of them fell into a steady routine - In the mornings, she woke up early to train with Sirius, after breakfast, Remus helped her with her studies, and council meetings after lunch. The work in the council room was tedious and often boring. They never seemed to be able to move past simple squabbles that gained nothing, but when she brought up real problems that needed solving, time seemed to go by a little bit faster. But the mornings were becoming her favorite. Training helped release her anger and frustration, and she loved reading any book and studying the history of Italy. She had gone to school when she was little, but eventually dropped out to work before she finished secondary education. Her vocabulary was limited at best, and she stumbled when reading out loud. Remus was patient, and took time whenever they could to help her. </p>
<p>	The current issue on the council table was wheat trade deals with Egypt, and Lily could hardly care less. They seemed to be dancing away from the real issues the country faced, each man more focused on running his business with cheaper costs. </p>
<p>She looked around the room as the speaker, a tall, balding man, droned on and on, and then back to her notes. A shout came from the hall, and James glanced back at the door, but returned his attention back to the speaker. Lily glanced at Yaxley, seated next to her, then to Rowle, next to him. Both had their hands on their guns, knuckles white. Raising an eyebrow, she exchanged glances with Potter, who looked equally uneasy. He shifted in his seat slightly, craning his head to look back at Sirius standing guard near the door. </p>
<p>Just as Lily turned back to look at Riddle, a louder scream came from the hall, and in an instant chaos erupts around them. Yaxley pulled his gun from his holster and aimed squarely at Lily. She threw hard against her chair, falling backwards, and the shot went wild over her head. Lily rolled and kicked Yaxley’s feet out from under him, and sending the gun sliding away. Gunshots sprayed around the room, and James stood next to her, fighting a soldier wearing a black bandana around his arm. </p>
<p>She cursed as Potter flew backwards from a stray shot, and she prayed it wasn’t fatal. Lily grabbed his arm, trying to pull him underneath the table. A bullet grazed her shoulder, but she doesn’t register it. His breath was coming out in gasps, but the shot was just to his leg, and he hadn’t lost too much blood yet. She dragged him towards the door. From underneath the table, she could see soldiers lying on the floor, some injured, some dead. Remus and Sirius were nowhere to be seen, and she cast a fleeting hope that they made it out alright. </p>
<p>They crawled to the edge of the table, and Lily helped James crouch. She grabbed a discarded gun from the ground and shot at the legs she could see, then grabbed James, hoisting him up and making a run for the door.</p>
<p>Somehow, they don’t get hit by any of the bullets whizzing around the room. Lily kicked the door open, and fired at another soldier with a black bandana. The man fell to the side, and she threw James’ arm over her shoulder, and pulled him down the hallway. Another soldier rounded the corner and Lily shot the gun again, but he kept advancing. She dumped Potter and hit the ground as he fired. She kicked at his knee, hearing a crack, and before he could right himself, she slammed the fallen gun over his head. He crumpled to the floor next to her. </p>
<p>Lily grabbed the gun, and then Potter, who was leaning heavily against the wall trying to rip his shirt into a bandage. He’s recovered a little, and this time could limp as Lily supported him. Her arm was hurting like bloody - but she couldn’t think about that right now, she needed to get out. They stumbled down to the kitchens, and she’s pretty sure they were leaving a trail of blood behind them, but the shouts are finally growing more distant. Her heart was pounding frantically and her mind was jumbled with thoughts. Somehow, no traitor guards followed them. </p>
<p>The maids were hiding in the corner, a soldier standing guard nearby. Lily shot twice, wincing as the maids shrieked in terror. Dropping the gun, she helped James sit down in a chair at the wide table. </p>
<p>“As your queen, I need your help.” Lily said, throwing a fierce look at them. One maid Lily recognizes, Emily, stood up quickly. She met Lily’s eyes, and nodded. </p>
<p>“We are at your service, Queen Lily.”</p>
<p>Lily breathed a quick thank you before she scrambled in the drawers for a towel. Emily packed a bag of food and ripped more bandages, as more maids sprung into action. Lily’s not sure what to do once James’ leg was bandaged decently - she knew she had to get out, but she still hadn’t learned how to get around well enough. James tried to explain to her how to get out as Remus barreled through the door, breathing hard. “They’re coming. I don’t know where Sirius and Peter are, but we need to leave. <em>Now</em>.”</p>
<p>Lily slung the bag over her shoulder and with Remus’ aid, helped James up. Emily pointed to a small door hidden to the side, designed for servants to use to discreetly move throughout the castle. Quickly, they shut the door behind them. The tiny hallway was lit by a single lamp, and Lily grabbed it in one hand. </p>
<p>The hallway becomes narrower and narrower, and eventually, Remus has to take James’ full weight while Lily leads the way with the lamp. They go down a set after set of stairs, Finally, a door appears on the right, with light seeping in through the cracks. Lily gestured for Remus to wait for a moment, and carefully opened the door, peering into the courtyard.</p>
<p>“There’s no sign of anyone yet. I’ll get a pair of horses. Stay here,” Lily told Remus.<br/>
Remus called out to stop her but she left before he could say anything. A minute later, Lily poked her head in, and motions for him to follow her. A pair of black stallions fitted with saddles were waiting just outside the door. Together, they awkwardly hoisted James onto the saddle. Lily swung up behind him since she had more experience riding than Remus, and Remus took the other. She tossed the gun to him, reached around James and gripped tightly on the reins and took off towards the Palace gates, Remus close behind. Shouting suddenly grew louder, and a group of soldiers burst from the gate house, each cocking their guns. Lily leaned low against the horse, shielding James with her body and Remus fired the gun twice before they can retaliate. The gate began to slowly move downward, and they were so close. “Remus, go!” She screamed, digging her heels into the sides of the horse. </p>
<p>The burst of speed was just enough. The heavy metal slammed into ground just as they ducked through. There’s a crowd gathered outside, some watching the chaos, and some even firing at the soldiers. They parted swiftly as the stallions pound by, and Lily thought she even saw a few wave.  </p>
<p>	Remus and Lily raced through the streets, weaving in and out of traffic. James stayed<br/>
low against the saddle, trying to avoid the jostle of the horse. Finally, the tight buildings gave way to trees and fields. No one seemed to be following them, so Lily shouted for Remus to follow her, and slowed the pace momentarily.</p>
<p>	“Are we going to your parents?” Remus asked when he had caught up. </p>
<p>	Lily shook her head. “I don’t know if I can trust Snape, and he knows where they live.”</p>
<p>Night fell before they stopped. Lily pushed the horses farther than she should, but they could see soldiers behind them several times, and more than a couple times bullets whizz by them. </p>
<p>“Lily, we’ve got to stop. James’ lost a lot of blood, and the horses are about to collapse.” </p>
<p>Lily looked at Remus. His face was drawn and pale, and sweat coated his face. “We’re almost there, I promise. We’ll be safe soon.”</p>
<p>Remus didn’t answer, just bowed his head and ploughed on. A few minutes later, Lily saw the house in the distance. She slowed the pace and whispered to Remus to stop. </p>
<p>Lily swung off the horse, and grabbed the gun from Remus. She knocked three times on the door, and it cracked open, a blonde head sticking out. Lily sagged in relief and the girl quickly beckoned her in. She jogged back, helping Remus swing James off the horse and into the house. </p>
<p>The room was softly lit by a fire. In one corner there was a small bed, and in the opposite corner, a small kitchen with a half eaten meal. Lily knew that underneath the rug in the corner, there was a small cellar, holding weapons and surplus food. The blonde girl helped lower James onto the bed, clucking softly. Lily began to boil a pot of water, and digging through the cabinets to find fresh bandages. James sat against the wall, silent, but still awake. </p>
<p>Marlene took one look at Remus and made him sit down as well. Lily explained the situation briefly to Marlene, who took the news in stride. “You heard about the marriage?” </p>
<p>Marlene nodded, ripping a frayed sheet. “I never really expected you to marry so soon.” She winked and Lily scowled at her. “We did it so -”</p>
<p>“- you could be a council member, yes, I know. Some people think it was actually for love - but anyone who has half a brain realized it was for the country’s benefit. No wanted to see King James go, but they also wouldn’t have exactly minded if someone else took over. Either way, people love you Lily.”</p>
<p>Lily took a breath and continued. “I finally had a chance to really make a difference. We’ve always needed someone at the top to force the lawmakers to see the other point of view.”</p>
<p>Marlene tuted, and handed Lily the bandages. “And how did that work out for you?”</p>
<p>Lily glared at her. She turned to Remus, still rebandaging Potter’s leg. “Remus, meet Marlene, Marlene, Remus.” She pushed her hair out of her eyes. “I met Marlene when I was part of the Order. We used to run missions together.” Lily smiled, “Marlene can charm anyone to do anything. But now she’s in charge of this safehouse, mostly used for things like this.” She gestured at James, who had fallen asleep. Remus nodded at Marlene. “Do you mind if I get a stew going? We haven’t eaten yet, and James could use some food.” </p>
<p>Marlene bobbed, stood up and brushed her hands off. “I’ll put the horses in the stable. Do you know if anyone followed you?”</p>
<p>Lily shook her head. “We haven’t seen anyone for a while, but I wouldn’t put it past them to keep looking. Better safe than sorry.”</p>
<p>Marlene exited and shut the door quietly behind her. Lily turned to Remus after a moment’s silence. “Are you okay?”</p>
<p>He paused from digging through the cupboards. “Who is Marlene, really? I thought the Order was fake, just a rumor used to give people hope. Why didn’t you ever tell me?”</p>
<p>Lily sighed. “You lot already didn’t trust me. I had a lot against me already, and I wasn’t sure how you were going to react if I was part of an organization that worked directly against the government, more so then the protests. And Dorcas was my roommate, but she wasn’t part of the Order.”</p>
<p>“That’s fair, I guess. Were you the leader?”</p>
<p>“Have you heard of Dumbledore?” Remus nodded. “He’s the brains, really. I wasn’t the leader at first, but over time, I had made enough connections that we decided I had the most influence over the public. I could connect with them too. So I became the public figure.” </p>
<p>“You just did what this guy told you to do?” He smiled. “Somehow I don’t see you doing that.”</p>
<p>“Before all of the riots and rallies, he operated the missions, assigned partners, decided what was worth the fight and what wasn’t. I organized the rallies, made the big speeches. A month before I got engaged to James, he wasn’t really happy with my connection to the Order and the protests, so I… had to cut ties. He didn’t want it to be against Riddle specifically, just change the unjust laws. When I left, I started organizing more rallies involving everyone, not just the Order.”</p>
<p>“So are you still an Order member?”</p>
<p>Lily played with the fraying sleeve of her shirt, avoiding his gaze. “I’m not sure. A lot of them weren’t happy when I married James anyway.”</p>
<p>“Lily, you didn’t have any choice -”</p>
<p>“-That’s not what they think. They don’t want a council of elites, they want a democracy. And so do I.”</p>
<p>“Then why did you do it?”</p>
<p>There was a pause as Lily tried to choose her words carefully. Suddenly, Remus gasped. “Lily, your arm!”</p>
<p>At his gasp, she stood up, reaching instinctively for her gun, but as his words registered she looked back at her arm. Suddenly the pain seemed overwhelming, and her eyes couldn’t fully register the blood trailing down her arm. </p>
<p>“Why… How did you not notice? It’s been at least an hour.” </p>
<p>“I… adrenaline. Remus… I’m feeling...” Lily sat down heavily on the ground. It wasn’t the pain that was the problem - the events had just finally caught up to her, and the shock was just setting in. “I thought it was James’ blood. I’m fine, I just need to eat something.”</p>
<p>Remus grabbed a bowl and rag, helping her out of her stained shirt, leaving her in a blood stained camisole. He gently wrapped the wound with a clean cloth, then handed her a cup of water.</p>
<p>Lily sipped the water slowly and Marlene returned holding the bag of food Lily left on her saddle. “I don’t see anyone, but it’s probably best you stay inside at all times until James can travel. We don’t want anyone to see strangers, especially since  all three of you are pretty recognizable.”</p>
<p>They ate dinner and slowly, Lily let what just happened seep into her, her hand shaking as she tried to raise her spoon. </p>
<p>Marlene sent her a questioning look. Lily shook her head. <em>This isn’t the first time things haven’t gone to plan.</em> She told herself. <em>It will all work out.</em></p>
<p>Remus finished his soup, scraping the bottom of his bowl. “So, why did you do it Lily?”</p>
<p>Lily let her spoon clank against the dish. She had hoped he would forget about his earlier question and move on. “Riddle wants to make the lower class even more distant from the upper class. And… stopping him was more important than creating a democracy. But as soon as it’s all over, this coup, that’s my next goal.”  </p>
<p>“Well, if it was a coup, it was a poorly staged one,” Remus said.</p>
<p>“Why would Riddle not make sure you three were dead? Or take you as prisoners?” asked Marlene.</p>
<p>Lily frowned, glancing at Remus. “There were no guards outside. Did you notice the one’s firing at us had black bandanas around their arm? If Riddle didn’t want us to escape, he should have had guards around the doors, or even at the border.”</p>
<p>“Maybe he didn’t have enough soldiers on his side,” Marlene pointed out. She heaped a portion into a bowl and sat next to James, shaking him gently. </p>
<p>“No, we definitely know he has enough support. But Lily, Yaxley did try to fire directly at you. Maybe he didn’t expect us to escape at all, and wanted to draw as little attention to it as possible,” Remus put in. </p>
<p>No one spoke for a moment until James woke up enough to eat a bite. “What do we do now?” Lily asked hoarsely. No one answered - no one could answer.</p>
