    <p>“Hi, I’m Newt!” A little boy emerges from Newt’s big coat and Tina panics for a moment right before adjusting some of the clothes to fit the kid’s body.</p>
<p>She’s so glad the curse that hit him was just a de-aging spell. Once they get to MACUSA she’ll ask Fontaine to make a potion to fix it.</p>
<p>“I’m Tina,” she tells the boy who looks adorably at her, all reddish curls and freckles all over that soft face of his.</p>
<p>“I like you, Tina! Can we be friends?” Newt beams and she can’t help but nod. She takes his hand and looks as Pickett climbs up his shoulders, looking worriedly at him.</p>
<p>“He’s going to be fine, Pickett. Stop fussing about it!” She huffs, looking as Newt starts introducing himself to the creature. Quickly, she apparates them both to MACUSA.</p>
<p>Tina had no idea Theseus Scamander was planning on paying a visit to his little brother until he saw him running towards them.</p>
<p>He glares at her as soon as he realizes what’s going on.</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>She quickly explains how one of the poachers hit Newt with a de-aging spell and how she managed to glue the rest to the ground before apparating away. A little nervous she adds that’ll probably take a whole day to prepare the potion to get Newt back to normal.</p>
<p>“But I can keep him in my office–”</p>
<p>“He’s my brother, so I’ll be taking care of him,” Theseus cuts her off, narrowing his eyes. But when he looks down a little Newt his expression turns into a soft, fondly smile. “Hi, little one.”</p>
<p>Little Newt frowns, confused… At least until Theseus kneels in front of him and something in his brain seems to click.</p>
<p>“Thee?” Newt confusion disappears, quickly replaced with a grin. “Thee! What happened to you? You look funny. Your friend put a spell on you again?”</p>
<p>Theseus chuckles before taking little Newt into his arms and kissing him on the forehead.</p>
<p>“No, I just grew up, little one.”</p>
<p>The expression Newt makes then is so sad Tina has the impulse to hug him, but she’s sure Theseus would probably bite her arm off before letting her take Newt away from him.</p>
<p>“But if you’re a grown up now, you’re not going to play with me anymore! Dad says grown ups get bored of kids!” Newt starts tearing up and Tina wants to punch Newt’s father in the face, but she knows very well he’s dead now.</p>
<p>It looks like Theseus would like to do that too. Although instead he kisses Newt’s both cheeks.</p>
<p>“Don’t listen to Dad, little one. I’ll never get bored of you!” He assures, tickling Newt until the boy giggles happily. “Now let’s go get some hot cocoa.”</p>
<p>“With marshmallows?”</p>
<p>“Of course, little one.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Theseus spends the rest of his day taking care of little Newt, roaming around MACUSA with the boy in his arms and telling him everything he knows about magical creatures so his little brother is happy.</p>
<p>Some aurors try to meet little Newt, because the boy is adorable, they even offer Theseus to help him take care of Newt, but the British auror bares his teeth at them in response.</p>
<p>Tina sighs, reminding herself it’s just going to last one day.</p>
