<p></p><div><p>Draco couldn't believe where he found himself; sitting in a gay strip club, The Belt, which had a decidedly leather feel to it. He knew he was gay, he had come to terms with that after the war. His parents had attempted to arrange a marriage with Astoria Greengrass. To say that attempt at heterosexual romance had been a disaster would be the understatement of the century. Astoria, while a lovely girl, didn't quite have what the Prince of Slytherin needed in a bed partner, namely the lack of a cock.</p><p>The youngest Malfoy was very particular in his tastes; tan skin, dark hair, and a lean quidditch build were preferrable. Bollocks were definitely a requirement.</p><p>Having been there long enough to see a couple of the dancers perform, Draco was about ready to call it a night. He flagged down a very scantily clad waiter with a lovely stomach and asked for his tab.</p><p>"Oh you'll want to see the next dancer." The waiter said with a wink. "It is definitely a show to remember."</p><p>With a sigh, Drago nodded, taking the advice. "If you say it's that big of a draw, I'll see for myself. Another Ogden's please?" he said dismissively.</p><p>As the sensual beat of the music filled the dark club, a soft light slowly rose, just bright enough to show the outline of the figure standing on the stage. A thin male stood there, his arms stretched high above his head, leather cuffs wrapped around his wrists and hooked to a chain hanging from somewhere above him. Slowly his body began to sway, his hips shifting with each pulse of the song.</p><p>
        <em>Leave me in chains</em><br/>
<em>Strip me of shame</em><br/>
<em>Caress me with pain</em><br/>
<em>'Cause I'm down on my knees and I'm begging you please as you say</em>
      </p><p>The lights came up a little brighter, revealing more of the male. The tan skin covering his toned body completely exposed, all but for the thin scrap of cloth that barely passed for shorts. The muscles in his arms and back bunching slightly as the chain hooked to the leather cuffs began to pull him up, lifting him a couple of feet above the floor.</p><p>
        <em>Don't cry, mercy</em><br/>
<em>There's too much pain to come</em><br/>
<em>Don't cry, mercy</em><br/>
<em>M-E-R-C-Y</em>
      </p><p>Once the chain had stoped it's upward movement the chained man slowly began to writhe, his body arching with the beat as though being struck with some invisible object, a shudder running through him as though he was enjoying the flogging he was pantomiming.</p><p>
        <em>Fill me with rage</em><br/>
<em>And bleed me dry</em><br/>
<em>M-E-R-C-Y</em><br/>
<em>Feed me your hate</em><br/>
<em>In the echo in silence I shiver each time that you say</em><br/>
<em>M-E-R-C-Y</em>
      </p><p>As the tantalizing beat came to a crescendo, the male swung his body around facing forward, his head bowed, the shaggy, shoulder length jet black hair forming a curtain around his face. When the swift movement came to a stop, he threw his head back, body arching as if in the throes of passion.</p><p>
        <em>Don't cry, mercy</em><br/>
<em>There's too much pain to come</em><br/>
<em>Don't cry, mercy</em><br/>
<em>M-E-R-C-Y</em><br/>
<em>M-E-R-C-Y</em>
      </p><p>The lithe male drew his legs up, spreading them and revealing the tan expanse of his inner thighs, that thin scrap of material leaving very little to the imagination as it strained to conceal something that seemed much larger than was intended at the making of it.</p><p>
        <em>M-E-R-C-Y</em><br/>
<em>M-E-R-C-Y</em><br/>
<em>M-E-R-C-Y</em><br/>
<em>M-E-R-C-Y</em>
      </p><p>He lowered his legs enough to cross his ankles, as though he had wrapped his legs around an invisible lover. With each repetition of those letters he rolled his hips, looking for all the world as though he was being ridden hard.</p><p>
        <em>Don't cry, mercy</em><br/>
<em>There's too much pain to come</em><br/>
<em>Don't cry, mercy</em><br/>
<em>M-E-R-C-Y</em><br/>
<em>M-E-R-C-Y</em>
      </p><p>His whole body arched at what looked like an almost painful angle, as though reaching climax.</p><p>
        <em>Don't cry, mercy</em>
      </p><p>The male lowered his legs slowly until they were hanging limply, his body relaxing in the chains, hanging there as though spent. Finally he looked up, his head lolling against his shoulder, his hair falling away from his face to reveal true beauty, complete with a set of haunting emerald eyes. A shudder of what would be thought aftershocks ran through his thin frame as the final beat of the song reverberated through the still club, the lights fading to pure darkness.</p>
<hr/><p>Draco sat there as the house lights came back up a couple of moments later, revealing an empty stage, non-descript music pulsing softly in the background, no sign of the dancer or the chain he had swung from.</p><p>The blonde sat there, his drink forgotten as he struggled with himself, attempting to reign in his physical needs, or more accurately, attempting to will away the stiffness in his cock. That had been the most erotic thing he had ever witnessed. The man had been the most beautiful thing he had ever seen in his life, and those eyes... He knew those eyes, but where? Where had he seen them before?</p><p>No one he saw in his business dealings had eyes like that. As Draco sat there, he mentally went over all of his conquests and meetings of the last year or so, trying to remember where he had ever seen such beautiful eyes.</p><p>In the years since he had left school he had dealt with so much for his family's holdings that it could be anyone. <em>'Wait...'</em> he thought <em>'school. The only eyes so green I've ever seen were on...'</em> and then it clicked. "Harry..." He whispered to himself.</p><p>"Orion." the same waiter from before said. Draco had been so lost in his own musings he hadn't even realized the presence of the man.</p><p>"Excuse me?" Malfoy said, shaking his head slightly to clear his thoughts.</p><p>"His name is Orion." The waiter repeated helpfully. "He owns this place."</p><p>Draco was slightly taken aback by this news but nothing slipped past that perfectly cultivated Malfoy mask. With a nod he dismissed the waiter after handing over a wad of bills, more than enough to pay off his tab. Standing he swiftly made his way outside as though the hounds of hell were hot on his heels.</p><p><em>'Harry Potter owns the hottest club in Wizarding London... and dances there too.'</em> He thought to himself. His world had just been upended and he was unsure how to proceed, the only certainty was his desire for the sensual man he had seen in chains.</p><p>At long last he admitted that he had always desired Harry Potter, it just took seeing such a display to wash away his denial.</p></div></div></div>
