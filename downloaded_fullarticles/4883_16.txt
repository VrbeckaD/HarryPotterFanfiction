    <p>A 71 one-year-old Harry Potter stood at his bedroom window looking at the eternal night sky outside looking no older than twenty-one. The sky reminded him of a muggle movie he had seen years ago. It was called the matrix and in the story, humankind doomed themselves and eventually the planet. With their weapons, they destroyed the earth's atmosphere. Well, oddly enough it had truly happened that way. The war with Voldemort had been brutal and vicious and long lasting. After nearly four decades of fighting, Harry, and his coven had finally killed him and most of his followers. However, by that time, Voldemort's wholesale slaughter of muggles had ruined the statute of secrecy. The whole world knew they existed and the extermination of the magical world had begun. That war only took ten years as muggles and wizards each realized that the other was not so easily killed. Eventually in desperation muggles had unleashed nuclear warfare across the whole planet expecting their deep underground bunkers to protect them and for the magicals to be decimated. It had worked in a way. Though their bunkers were not enough protection from the devastation they unleashed most of the wizardkind had died with them as well. The world population the last time Harry checked was just under ten thousand and it was quickly declining. The world itself was dying from what had been done to it.</p>
<p>Harry was pulled from his thoughts by a warm pair of arms wrapping around his waist and a soft body pressing against his from behind. Warm lips leaving a trail of kisses over his shoulder blades.</p>
<p>"Come back to bed my Warlock, three of us are still waiting for our last turn with you before tomorrow's ritual," Harry smiled as he heard the loud moans of several women from the bed behind him and even some howls of pleasure meaning Hermione was being serviced as well. It seems his girls had awoken and started without him again.</p>
<p>Harry was the Warlock to six witches and together then made a coven of seven, a very powerful magical number.</p>
<p>A coven was a collection of witches under a single wizard who was named their warlock. Coven's had largely fallen out of use in the past five hundred years within the magical world mainly because of the blood magic required to form a coven. The ritual bound each witch of the coven to the Warlock by their blood. And through the blood bond, the Warlock had ownership over and responsibility for the witches. Much like a muggle harem, though each of the women in a coven was treated well and respected for the most part. In return for the bond, the Warlock was to provide for their needs and future, to teach them, or provide teachers for them and to protect them, physically, mentally and legally.</p>
<p>Harry's coven was different in that each of his girls had given a piece of their souls to him and in turn, he had given each of his girls a piece of his own soul. He had learned the trick in his quest to destroy Voldemort, they were called horucuxes and required a ritual and a premeditated murder without remorse. Harry had discovered that destroying a Horcruxes counted as premeditated murder so long as he was aware of what it was when he destroyed it. All of his Horcruxes and each of the girls Horcruxes were in fact made by destroying other people Horcruxes, mostly Voldemort's but they had found a few in the pyramids in Egypt and even Morgan LeFay had a few that they found and destroyed in their search for enough power to defeat Voldemort. When dumbledore had learned what Harry and his girls had done to ensure their victory he had been disgusted and quickly turned the public against them. Even in the war against the muggles Harry and his girls were seen as the new Dark Lord and his dark Ladies by the wizards and attacked by both sides.</p>
<p>To Harry and his girls though the pros far outweighed the cons. They had all stopped aging once they had fully matured and the only way to truly kill any of them was to in fact kill all of them. So long as even one of his girls lived she could create a new body for Harry and once Harry was restored he could restore each of his girls. They could draw on each other's magical power to perform feats that would seem godly in their power for an individual to perform. With effort, they could send or retrieve thoughts to each other, they were all thankful it took a conscious effort to exchange thoughts and they didn't flow freely between them. They couldn't imagine how distracting it would be to always hear six other in their minds. Though the thoughts did not travel freely they were given and taken between each other without needing any permission. They were a coven, the most powerful coven in history. They all loved each other, they all depended on each other, and they all shared everything.</p>
<p>Each of his girls had also taken his last name for their own as was their rights. His girls were Fleur Potter, Hermione Potter, Daphne Potter, Luna Potter, Susan Potter and Ginny Potter</p>
<p>"I will join you all in a moment I promise." The women behind him sighed and pressed her naked chest more firmly into his naked back.</p>
<p>"I get you first when you join us?" He could hear the pleading pout in her voice and smirked softly.</p>
<p>"Yes Fleur, my beautiful fallen angel I will make sure to come to you first."</p>
<p>The women purred at her pet name and black wings folded around Harry from behind as the women's fingernails turned to talons and Harry felt soft down feather appearing all over her body proving the woman's Veela heritage. Most men who married Veela were put off by the thought of intimacy with them while they were in their half bird form, however, Harry and each of his other girls found her transformed state extremely arousing. She truly looked like a fallen angel with large back wings and sharp-taloned hands. Her body grew extremely soft black down feather that covered her arms, legs, sides leaving her lovely rear, breasts, stomach and pussy bare. Her back was also bare but for a single strip of down feathers that covered her spine from tailbone to the hairline. Her eyes turned from their sapphire blue to a brilliant gold that literally glowed.</p>
<p>Fleur wasn't the only one that wasn't completely human in their coven. Hermione was a werewolf and because of her attempts to find a cure developed a half shifted form. Her fur was brown just like her hair and the fur covered the same parts of her body as Fleur's down feathers, legs, arms, and sides, leaving the rest of her body bare. Such a half form came about from a modified version of the wolfsbane potion. It was a failed attempt at a cure but after its effect, Hermione was in fact very pleased with the outcome as were the rest of the girls who all found her furry form attractive. Hermione had been bitten back in their third year by Professor lupin, though Harry and Ron hadn't found out about her condition for years. The potion afforded her completely control of herself at all times and even stopped any kind of mandatory change even during the full moon. It separated the wolf mind from her own mind allowing her to sleep restfully without the nightmares that normally plagued werewolves, and if she drew on the power of the wolf her senses were greatly enhanced, she had a sense of smell better than most hounds, and could hear a person's heartbeat from twenty feet away. However drawing the power also caused her to partially shift into her 'furry' form.</p>
<p>Harry was broken from his thoughts as another loud howl of pleasure filled the room and Harry smirked turning to join his six ladies on their massive bed. Tonight was possibly their last night together as tomorrow his girls would be sacrificing their lives to power a ritually that would hopefully send Harry back in time to save their world from destruction. Their Horcruxes would survive the time travel, but they could only send Harry's memories back. They all shared the fear that their coven would not reform in the past. And tonight was a night of passion and hope edged with great sorrow.</p>
<p>-o0O0o-</p>
<p>Harry Potter, the most powerful 'dark' lord in history stood naked in the center of a hexagram drawn in blood and filled with thousands of minuscule runes six black-robed figures stood to the side watching him.</p>
<p>"It is ready my loves. Let us get started."</p>
<p>At his words they all started walking towards him shedding their robes to show six gorgeous women dressed the same as Harry, that is to say not at all. The first reach him was Luna a petite Blonde with silver eyes. Once she was close enough she leaped the remaining distance into Harry's arms and wrapped her arms around his neck and her legs around his waist as she attacked his lips with her own and Harry grabbed her small tight rear to hold her up as they kissed. After a few seconds, Harry could feel her tears spilling onto his face during the heated kiss and her broke away to nuzzle their cheeks together. No words needed to be said. They were all about to sacrifice their lives for the chance for sending him back in time in an effort to save the entire world.</p>
<p>"I love you, Little Moon. Our bond will survive I promise." Harry whispered gently into Luna's ear before he bit it gently causing Luna to moan then whine in disappointment as he set her down on her feet. He slapped her small bottom causing her to yelp slightly before she smiled brilliantly at Harry and she walked to her spot on one of the points in the diagram shaking her rear the entire time. Harry like normal was unable to pull his eyes away from the sight until warm hands cupped his cheeks and pulled him into a fierce kiss by his veela girl Fleur, he recognized her by taste alone. Her mouth always tasted of cinnamon.</p>
<p>Though Harry saw all his girls as equals in beauty each personifying completely different ideas of beauty. Where Luna was his tiny petite pixy Fleur was his bombshell with wide hips and large breasts giving her a perfect hourglass figure long silver hand that passed her rear in length just brushing the top of her thighs in the back. Harry hands drifted immediately to Fleur's hips and pulled her body flush against his as they kiss continued for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Finally, Fleur pulled away and looked into his emerald green eyes with her sapphire ones for a long moment before they flashed gold and kissed him again briefly before turning and heading to her point. No words were shared between them but each of their eyes were filled with enough love that is was unnecessary.</p>
<p>Next up was his beautiful snake, Daphne. Her eyes were almost a perfect match to his own though her hair was the complete opposite, blonde and perfectly straight as it just brushed her shoulder in length. She had a body of an athletic. Strong, lean with no bulging muscles her body was toned perfection her breasts were only slightly under average in size but extremely perky she hardly ever wore a bra because she didn't need the support it provided. She walked forward with the hypnotic grace of a serpent and upon reaching him dragged her tongue across his collarbone and up his neck before Harry turned his face and captured her lips in a gentle kiss which she happily returned grinding her body slowly against his until Harry gave her firm rear a slap and she hissed in pleasure</p>
<p>"I love you my siren." Daphne hissed softly again and nuzzles her cheek against his before pulling away and moving to her spot in the diagram.</p>
<p>Next up was his fiery redhead beauty Susan her body was soft and voluptuous with the largest breasts and rear of all his girls. Her Hair was normally in a thick braid down her back that just passed her shoulder blades. Susan sauntered up to Harry and hugged him close pressing her breast into his chest as she nuzzled into Harry's neck for a few minutes. Harry held her close and rest his head against hers. Eventually, she pulled away and quickly pecked him on the lips before wiping tears from her eyes.</p>
<p>"I love you, Harry." She whispered before pecking him on the lips again and turning away heading to her spot in the circle before Harry could reply, out of all of them Susan was taking this the worst. It was pure chance that she joined their coven last time and she was convinced that if they succeeded in sending Harry back she wouldn't be so lucky again.</p>
<p>His last two girls stood still for a moment watching him. Hermione was a woman of perfect proportions. she had breasts just the right size for her body, her rear was perfectly plump and her legs and arms were perfectly shaped. Her hair which had once been wild was now a rolling sensual mass of curls that cascaded down her back and over her shoulders covering her breasts completely She also impressively lean body due to her inner wolf and a softly defined six pack of abs. Though no part of her body was bulging muscle it was clear she was in impressive shape.</p>
<p>Hermione gently pushed the other girl towards Harry. Ginny shyly fingered her neck were up until she entered the room was adorned with a collar she wore with pride. Ginny was had an athletic build just like Daphne, however, her breasts were larger and swayed with every step. After Harry had rescued her from the basilisk in his second year she had sworn herself to his service without telling him. It wasn't until the war started that Harry learned what she had done and why she was getting so desperate for his attention. She had thought Harry knew what she had done, as it was customary for a single woman with a life debt to repair it in such a manner, at least in all the stories she read. It took years for her to realize that her romance novels were just that, stories and Harry had no clue what she had done.</p>
<p>Harry quickly learned that she was a complete submissive. She loved to be treated as a slave by Harry and the rest of the girls and her first Christmas gift from the coven had been a silk collar with a lightning bolt for Harry, a serpent for Daphne a pawprint for Hermione, a black feather for Fleur a crescent moon for Luna and tongue of flame for Susan. From that point on she never took it off and worn its pride. This ritual, however, required that nothing is present besides their natural bodies. Forcing her to take it off for the first time since the coven had given it to her. Ginny fell gracefully to her knees when she stood in front of Harry and bowed kissing Harry feet lovingly.</p>
<p>"Stand," Harry commanded and Ginny immediately obeyed and Harry cupped her cheek and lifted her eyes to meet his own before he kissed her tenderly.</p>
<p>"Don't worry Ginny I will make sure to acknowledge your oath right away when I return."</p>
<p>"Thank you master" Ginny spoke softly and Harry pulled her to his chest where she immediately relaxed and molded her body to his for a few moments before Harry kissed her head and whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>"Go get into position Gin." She nodded obediently and moved quickly to her spot.</p>
<p>Hermione bit her lip softly an old nervous habit of hers as she walked up to him. Harry's arms snaked around her waist and pulled her close before softly kissing her teeth that were biting her lip causing her to giggle softly and smile tenderly at him.</p>
<p>"You remember our plans for when you arrive? We are aiming for the night after we help Sirus escape."</p>
<p>"Yes, I remember My beautiful she-wolf. I will tell you to trust me because the theory on temporal travel and the multiverse is true. Then I will give you the instructions and ingredients to add to the wolfsbane potion that you will be given for the summer by Madam Pomfrey. Then give you books about covens and swear you an oath that should you choose to form a coven with me I will tell you everything but not before you swear to form the coven." Hermione nodded and relaxed.</p>
<p>"That will work Harry I promise. The very thought you know about my theory which I haven't written down or even spoken allowed about will convince me what you traveled back in time, the books on covens will explain how they are such a benefit to me, the sharing knowledge and power will convince me to go ahead with it and the fact that, you are sure to know things because well you time traveled will finish the deal."</p>
<p>"I know love," Harry replied with a smile. He had gone over his plans with all of his girls many times to the point where it seemed all but Hermione was satisfied, but that was just her way, infinitely checking the plans until they plans are finished, even then she will look back to try and improved them in case they have ever needed again.</p>
<p>"Ok," Hermione said breathily before sighing deeply and grabbing Harry's head and crashing his lips down onto her's as she battled for dominance in the kiss. For the first time ever Harry let her win and she growled in triumph before pulling away her eyes shining gold.</p>
<p>"I love you, Harry."</p>
<p>"And I love you, Hermione."</p>
<p>-o0O0o-</p>
<p>Harry cried without shame as he watched each of his girls bleed out from their chests into the ritual circle. Each had plunged a conjured dagger into their own hearts which vanished upon their deaths leaving a gaping wound in each of them. Harry could feel the power building, he could feel each of his girls Horcruxes within him pulsing in pain as their souls were used to provide the power for the ritual. The Horcruxes within him should survive the journey, though the rest of heir souls would be consumed for the ritual. It was the reason none of them could send their souls back with him. Even with six willing given souls, they could only send him back to the end of his third year of Hogwarts. They had originally hoped to send him back to his birth and save even more lives. His own parents. Luna's Mother, Susan's parents and Daphne aunt, they had wished to save them all but alas it wasn't possible.</p>
<p>Harry waited to focus with all his might to push aside his pain and sorrow at watching his girls end their own lives so as to make sure they didn't do so for no good reason. As their blood flowed through the circle and the runes started to glow Harry conjured his own dagger and held it over his heart as his eyes fixed on the rune that was to be the last to light up. It would stay light for only a few seconds and it was in that time that Harry must end his own life or the whole ritual would fail.</p>
<p>Harry plunged the dagger through him heart the moment the rune light up and Harry felt a sensation much like a portkey grab hold of him and tear him from his physical body before everything went black.</p>
<p>It felt like Harry had been in blackness for an eternity when suddenly a ghost like voice spoke to him in the darkness.</p>
<p>"Interesting." It said as if amused and if Harry had a body he would have turned to try and locate the voice but as it was. He tried to speak, to ask what was happening but found he had no voice either.</p>
<p>"You have done a number on your soul, yet have kept it balanced with pieces from others, none has done this before." The voice continued whether it knew Harry could hear it or not it seemed to wish to speak to him.</p>
<p>"You have done what none has done before you, You have sent you soul back in time defying both myself and fate in the process." At those words, dread filled Harry. He had long known that such primal entities such as death, life, fate, destiny, and many others did have manifestations if they so chose. It seemed he offended two of them with his travel through time."</p>
<p>"You may call me death, boy. But do not be afraid I do not come to claim your soul but to give you a message, a warning, a gift and to make a request. Should you heed the warning and do as I ask you will never see me again and your girls will never meet me until you are all ready to do so.</p>
<p>Harry's fear vanished but his worry doubled at those words. A promise from death to never see him until they wished to? To keep himself and his girls from death forever if they wanted. That was a deal to good to be true.</p>
<p>"You have gone farther than any other to avoid me, yet I can see your intentions clearly and you did not do it for yourself. You held absolutely no fear of death for yourself but for those of your coven. And now you have risked everything for the chance to come back and protect others, to save others, an entire world in fact. You have broken from the mold Fate built for you and she is just as interested in what you will do as I am. The message is, you are out of fates control, she wishes to see what you will do now that you are free. The warning is from me. Never make this journey again. This journey through time shall be your one and only. Had I not stepped in to guide it to completion you would have ended the existence of several universes. And the gift will be this. I shall place the pieces of your soul that were in each of your girls into them again. When you awaken each of them will still be a Horcrux for you and you a Horcrux for each of them. In return for bearing these messages, stopping you from destroying several universes unintentionally and for the gift, I would ask one thing from you in return. Gather the items known as the deathly hallows and destroy them. I once gifted them to man thinking it would help lead them on a better path, but like most things mankind had abused them and I wish them returned to me.</p>
<p>Harry gasped as he jerked awake in the middle of the hospital wing and looked around to see both Ron and Hermione sleeping in hospital beds as well. Ron's leg was wrapped up tightly where Padfoot had bitten it and Harry couldn't hold back a smile. It had worked. He was back in the third year. He had a chance to save the world from becoming the desolate wasteland it was in the future.</p>
<p>He fell back against his pillows and closed his eyes as he organized his thoughts and tried to fall back asleep.</p>
<p>Unknown to him six girls jerked silently awake from odd dreams they couldn't clearly remember and an aching in their chests that faded quickly.</p>
