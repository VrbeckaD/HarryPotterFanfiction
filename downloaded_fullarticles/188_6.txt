    <p>They’d moved to Godric’s Hollow in the early months of 1980. After Dumbledore had told them about the Prophecy, he’d mentioned that it would probably be safer for them to go into hiding and they had readily agreed. Alice and Frank Longbottom had gone into hiding around the same time, only a few streets away from the Potters.</p>
<p>It had been hard, of course it had, but they were trying to survive a war. A war started by a man who wanted to kill their baby. So, if going into hiding, with almost no magical use was the best way to keep their family safe, then that’s what they’d do.</p>
<p>The other three quarters of the Marauders visited as often as they could, but after Harry had been born it became less and less frequent. Peter had gone into hiding shortly after becoming their Secret Keeper, and they hadn’t seen or heard from him since Harry’s first birthday, three months previously. They had seen Remus at the beginning of September, just before he left on an Order mission. And Sirius had stayed for dinner in the middle of October. But they hadn’t seen or heard from them since, and it scared James and Lily.</p>
<p>It was Harry’s second Halloween, and James desperately wanted to do something to celebrate but he had settled for a quiet lunch with his wife, son, and Bathilda Bagshot from next door. James had cooked one of his mother’s recipes, and Bathilda had brought a pumpkin pie for dessert. The little old lady had left mid-afternoon. Lily had been sleeping since then and James sat with Harry on the sofa in front of the fire.</p>
<p>After the bouncing of his leg had woken Harry twice, he resigned himself to the fact that the child would sleep better if he was curled up on the sofa beside him instead of on his lap. James kept a hand resting on Harry’s back, telling himself it was to comfort Harry, but in reality, was probably comforting him just a little bit more. He watched the cat stretch from its place on the rug in front of the fire, before it settled down in a different position. The sink turned on upstairs, and James could hear Lily pottering around the bathroom. He listened carefully as the water turned off and everything was silent for a few minutes.</p>
<p>He turned to smile over his shoulder at her as she entered, but his smile fell as he realised she was on the verge of tears. His brow furrowed and he crossed the room to her in three large steps.</p>
<p>“Don’t cry, Lil.” He whispered, drawing her into his arms. “What’s wrong, baby?”</p>
<p>Lily just shook her head and buried further into James’ shoulder. James waited patiently, just rubbing circles on her back and placing kisses in her hair. He’d learned early on that Lily would tell him what was wrong in her own time, and that trying to push her would just stop her from telling him for even longer.</p>
<p>“Come sit.” He said into her hair. Carefully, he pulled her towards the armchair and let her curl into his side.</p>
<p>She murmured something against his neck, but he didn’t hear, so he pulled his face away to look her in the eyes.</p>
<p>“What’s going on, Lily?”</p>
<p>“I’m-“ Lily swallowed, “I’m pregnant, James.”</p>
<p>James couldn’t help the grin that graced his face, and Lily laughed as he peppered kisses all over her face. “Your happy, then?” She asked.</p>
<p>“Of course, I am. Are you happy? Because if you don’t-“</p>
<p>“No, no, no, of course I want to keep it. It just, we’re still in the middle of a war, Jamie.” She burrowed her face back into his neck. “How are we going to raise another one?”</p>
<p>He place a kiss on the top of her head, and stayed quiet for a few minutes, trying to think about how he was going to phrase his answer. He didn’t want to say the wrong thing.</p>
<p>“We’ve done great with Harry so far, haven’t we?” Lily nodded her head slightly, so James continued. “I love you, Lily, and I’m not going anywhere. We’ll get through this war and we’ll raise our kids. I promise you, it will all be fine.”</p>
<p>“How are you always so optimistic?” Lily smiled at him.</p>
<p>“How can I not be? I have you.” James smiled back and leant in to kiss her.</p>
<p>They only broke apart when Harry started to cry.</p>
<p>“We should get him to bed.” Lily said, getting up to coo at their son.</p>
<p>Harry stopped crying as soon as Lily had picked him up. She smiled at James and turned towards the door. With a yawn James reached for his wand.</p>
<p>“Leave it, James. We’re safe here remember?”</p>
<p>No matter what he said to her, no matter what he wanted to believe and no matter how optimistic he could be, he couldn’t stop listening to the small voice in the back of his mind that told him he needed to have his wand. So, when Lily’s back was turned, he slipped his wand into the waistband of his jeans, and followed her to the stairs. They started to climb the stairs in silence. James was only on the second step when the door rattled harshly, and he spun around, gripping his wand by his side.</p>
<p>“It’s just the wind, dear.” Lily said, continuing up the stairs.</p>
<p>James didn’t take his eyes of the door, and Lily stopped a few steps from the top to look at him. He still didn’t take his eyes off the door, because for the first time in the many years he had known her, she was wrong. The lock clicked.</p>
<p>“Run, Lily!” He shouted, “I’ll hold him off.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t watch her run up the remaining stairs, but he heard the bedroom door slam and a sense of relief began to flood through him. Lily was going to run, but he had to give them time. The relief didn’t last for long, because just seconds later the front door was being blasted open, almost off its hinges. And suddenly, James was faced with his worse fear.</p>
<p>Lord Voldemort.</p>
<p>For a few seconds, nothing happened. Then Voldemort shot a spell at him. James blocked it just in time and thanked Merlin it wasn’t green. Voldemort sent more curses, and James blocked everyone.</p>
<p>“Don’t fight me. It is useless.”</p>
<p>James growled, and sent a hex towards Voldemort. Before he could get his shield back up, Voldemort made a sudden movement with his wand, and he was flying backwards. He felt something crack, as his side hit the stairs. Then everything went black.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>The tears began falling as soon as she heard the thud of James’ body falling to the ground. But she had to protect her son. She probably should have climbed out the window, or done something, anything to get away. But she couldn’t worry about that now. Voldemort came into view, his wand pointed at her. She stood in front of Harry’s crib, trying to keep him from view, but she knew he had seen her son.</p>
<p>“Stand aside.” He said. “Stan aside and I shall spare you.”</p>
<p>“No.” Lily said fiercely.</p>
<p>“Move.” Voldemort hissed.</p>
<p>“No.” She said fiercely.</p>
<p>“Stand aside, and I’ll consider sparing your life.”</p>
<p>“Not Harry. Please, have mercy. Not my baby-“ Lily cried, hands gripping</p>
<p>“This is my last warning.”</p>
<p>“No, please. Not Harry – I’ll do anything. Please...” She begged.</p>
<p>Voldemort didn’t answer, slashing his wand through the air. Lily screamed as the green light filled the room and she fell to the floor, one hand reaching out for Harry.</p>
<p>The room was quiet, only the child’s sniffles making a noise. Voldemort snarled, and raised his wand again. “Avada Kedavra.”</p>
