    <p>Rejection felt like ice water running down your body, and you’d just gotten another bucket dumped on you. And that was your experience with romance was rejection: pursuit that ended with rejection.</p><p>You still remembered, quite clearly, the way he had tried to avoid you when you told him, the way he’d tried to avoid having the conversation, avoid rejecting you. You remembered how he had stuttered and looked away and the ice cold feeling of rejection washing over you.</p><p>“Leta?” you asked him. He nodded, still not meeting your eyes.</p><p>That was a year ago though. You’d long since gotten over it and moved past it and accepted that the handsome, sweet Newt Scamander was your friend. Nothing more. Your friendship had survived that quite fine. You suppressed your feelings and stayed friends, even after Leta broke his heart, you comforted him, but never made a move. And now, y'all were close again, roommates, both working in New York-him as a magizooligist, you in the ministry-and you had rented an apartment together, right next to Queenie and Tina Goldstein.</p><p>Your crush on him was forgotten, your thoughts of him as anything more than your friend a distant memory, but that feeling of rejection wasn’t quite a distant memory to your heart, which is why you were so receptive to when men pursued you. It had started a month after you had moved to New York.</p><p>                                                ______________</p><p>Newt had come to visit you at work for lunch, because he’d caught the creature early.</p><p>Y'all went to a restaurant right outside your office and you encountered one of your coworkers when Newt went up to grab some more drinks.</p><p>“Hey Y/N,” Malcolm said as he slid down into the seat Newt had previously occupied.</p><p>“Hi Malcolm,” you said smiling at him.</p><p>“Wow. You look even more beautiful today than normal. Why is the beautiful new girl sitting all by herself?” he asked, reaching across the table to touch you. Suddenly Newt cleared his throat. You saw him standing over Malcolm with a strange look in his eye.</p><p>“Actually, she’s not. She’s not alone. She’s with me.” Newt said, slamming the trays down onto the table.</p><p>Malcolm’s eyes widened as he backed away.</p><p>“I’m eating with him. That’s what he meant. I’m not eating lunch alone; I’m eating lunch with him. He’s my best friend. He’s visiting me for lunch.” You explained.</p><p>Malcolm smiled.</p><p>“So…he’s just a friend?” he asked.</p><p>“He can speak for himself.” He muttered.</p><p>“Yes.” You said.</p><p>“You’re single?” Malcolm asked again.</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>“To whomever it may concern…” you started coyly.</p><p>“It’s none of anyone’s concern,” Newt muttered once again under his breath.</p><p>“Yes I am single.” You said.</p><p>Malcolm smiled and grabbed your hand as he stood to leave.</p><p>“Well that is delightful to know. I’ll keep an eye out for you, help you get acquainted to the office.” He said with a smile as he walked away.</p><p>Newt rolled his eyes.</p><p>“What’s with that guy?” he said.</p><p>You shook your head, choosing to ignore the fact that it was actually Newt who was acting strange.</p><p>The second one was John. Everything had been going great between you. He’d started flirting with you, and being high up in the ministry, he used his money to flirt. He bought you many lovely gifts, bracelets, necklaces, pens, he left them on your desk. You were delighted. Then he started sending gifts to the apartment.</p><p>You and Newt were walking into the apartment one evening. His face was lit up as he excitedly told you about his day. His face was bright red from the cold as you climbed the stairs to the apartment. As you eared the door, you saw a brilliant splash of red against the door.</p><p>Newt slowly tapered off and you gasped as you got closer. It was a beautiful bouquet of red roses. You squealed and excitedly opened the card. It was a beautiful love poem, signed from John in big letters. Newt looked over your shoulder and glimpsed the note. You turned around to him with a big smile on your face. You didn’t notice that his cheeks were no longer red, but paler. His eyes weren’t bright anymore. He wasn’t smiling.</p><p>“I’m going to visit Tina.” He said, retreating.</p><p>You nodded and waved at him, putting the flowers in a vase as you got inside. When the flowers merely a few days later, you shrugged it off. You’d found John charming, but there was no deep attraction. You knew he had mainly enjoyed the chase and after y'all had both gotten what you wanted. You didn’t notice, that the petals had been eaten and that the stalks of the roses had bowtruckle teeth marks. You didn’t notice Pickett climbing out of the roses just as you pulled them out of the vase to put them in the trash. And because you didn’t notice that, you didn’t make the connection to the Hufflepuff who might’ve fed your roses to the bowtruckles; you wouldn’t have wondered why he’d done it.</p>
