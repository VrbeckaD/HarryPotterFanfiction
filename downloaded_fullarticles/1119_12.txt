          <div class="userstuff"><p>He looked at her from behind his issue of Potions Quarterly with barely concealed curiosity, paying attention to every move she made.</p>
<p>When he had gotten home two hours earlier, she had been sitting at the dinner table, quite like she was now, scribbling in a notebook, quite like she was now, with her face scrunched up, quite like it was now, and her tongue sticking out in concentration. When he had asked her what she was doing, he only got a "Shush Daddy, I'm writing." which really didn't help much, mostly because he was quite aware that his tiny four year old couldn't actually write. Or, at the very least, she couldn't really write correctly. Most of the time though, she could sign her own name properly. This past month she even stopped writing her "S"s backwards.</p>
<p>Still, the longer she sat there, smudging ink all over both herself and the tablecloth under her notebook, the more curious he got. He was very nearly ready to interrupt her and ask what on Earth she thought she was writing when she pointedly stabbed the quill in her hand into the paper and exclaimed "I'm done!" in a tired but satisfied tone.</p>
<p>He put his magazine down, waiting for her to explain, but she only slipped off her 'big girl chair' and tiredly stumbled up to him to crawl into his lap. Her inky little hands left dark blue marks all over the yellow chair he'd been sitting in but he didn't care, pulling her close and letting her curl up in his arms.</p>
<p>She laid her dark curly head on his chest, rubbing her face on his shirt before settling in and letting her eyes slip closed with a yawn.</p>
<p>"I don't know how you write all those articles about potions, Daddy. I only wrote one and I'm already exhausted." She murmured, slowly drifting off to sleep.</p></div>
