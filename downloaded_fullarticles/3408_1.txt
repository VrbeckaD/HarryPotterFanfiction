    <p>Fred and George Weasley woke early on April 1<sup>st</sup>. It was their fourteenth birthday. Today their soulmarks would appear on their wrists. The initials of the person they were meant to spend the rest of their life with.</p><p>They communicated with a look and made their way to the bathroom, careful not to disturb their dorm mates. They held their wrists together and looked at the initials. They weren’t surprised that they were the same. The same two letters: HP. They weren’t surprised but they were nervous. They didn’t know how others would react.</p><p>The end of the school year came quickly. After they returned home their mother pulled them aside.</p><p>“Percy says you’ve been hiding your wrists. Did you not find your soulmates?” She asked, concerned. The twins looked at each other, then pulled the cuffs off their wrists and showed her. She gave a small gasp.</p><p>“We know who it is.” George said. Fred nodded.</p><p>“The same soulmate? It’s rare, but sometimes for twins it happens.” Their mother said, sitting down in her chair. “It happened for my brothers. Your uncles, Fabian and Gideon. But our mother told them it was wrong and prevented them from seeing their soulmate. They became reckless and crazy and in the end it got them killed.” She told them, sighing. “But I won’t do that to you. I only know one person with those initials. You look after him, alright? He’s had enough hardship.”</p><p>Fred and George smiled and hugged her. “Thanks, Mum. We’ll do our best.” They turned to leave, but Molly spoke again.</p><p>“And don’t you dare tell him until he’s fourteen. He was raised by muggles, probably knows nothing about soulmates, the poor dear. Don’t overwhelm him.”   She insisted sharply. The twins nodded.</p><p>They had time to consider, as they watched their soulmate. They longed to tell him. But their mother was right, it would only confuse him.</p><p>They grew angry when they saw how he was treated, but they couldn’t do much yet and it tore them up.</p>
