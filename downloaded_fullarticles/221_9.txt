    <p>Sharing</p>
<p>One-Shot</p>
<p>Hermione gets upset when she sees Ron with another girl at Harry's wedding. The twins want to help cheer her up and for her to forget about their little brother.</p>
<p>xxx</p>
<p>'That little bastard'. Hermione thought as she stomped towards the exit of the canopy. </p>
<p>How dare he show up with her. Whoever she was.</p>
<p>They had promised that they would wait until after the wedding to tell the family and their friends that they had broken up. It's only been less than a month since they parted ways, yet here he was with another new witch on his arm. It wasn't the same girl as last week. 'He certainly gets through them quickly'. She scoffed when they began to snog off the edge of the dancefloor.</p>
<p>Hermione could see Harry glancing at her across from his table. He gave her a remorseful look that told her that he knew about their break up.</p>
<p>Ginny saw what Ron was doing and looked like she was about to get up and hex him, but Harry stopped her before she could get to her wand. He whispered something in her ear that seemed to calm her down, but only slightly it seemed from the way she gripped her glass and took a drink.</p>
<p>Hermione could feel her eyes welling up with tears as she walked into the Weasley's house. She needed to get out of here.</p>
<p>"Oi, Granger-"</p>
<p>"Where's the fire?" A pair of almost identical voices called.</p>
<p>"Just leave me alone." She wiped away the lone tear that escaped. She hoped that the twins hadn't have seen it. But of course, they were faster than her and managed to cut off her escape and see her tear-stained face.</p>
<p>"What's our baby brother done now?" Fred asked, his face became hard when he saw her tears.</p>
<p>"He hasn't done anything." She paused to wipe away another tear. "Well, not really."</p>
<p>"Did he break up with you?" Fred asked nervously.</p>
<p>"No, well, yes. It happened about a month ago but he's here with another new girl."</p>
<p>"Another girl?" George raised an eyebrow at her.</p>
<p>"Yeah, he's been enjoying his newfound fame." She said bitterly. Ever since the end of the war, the golden trio and those associated with them were recognised wherever they went. </p>
<p>It was a nightmare for her most of the time, but it was brilliant for Fred and George's business. They were making a killing according to the Daily Prophet.</p>
<p>"Well, now I don't feel so bad spiking his drink." George laughed.</p>
<p>"You did what?" She stopped crying and immediately became worried for Ron.</p>
<p>"Just our new semi-permeant hair dye potion." Fred smirked.</p>
<p>The sound of howling laughter erupted from the canopy.</p>
<p>"Where are those weasels!" They heard a very annoyed Ron yell.</p>
<p>The twins went over to the window.</p>
<p>"I thought we gave him the purple dye?" Fred asked George.</p>
<p>"Yeah but I always thought blue was his colour." George grinned.</p>
<p>They saw a very angry, blue-haired Ron heading their way.</p>
<p>"He's looks very angry Gred."</p>
<p>"I agree Forge."</p>
<p>They both spun on their heels to make their escape but not before they grabbed Hermione's hands in their own and ran outside to the apparition point.</p>
<p>"Fred! George!" Ron yelled. He hadn't seen her with the twins. She was laughing too much to care if he did.</p>
<p>When they reached the spot, the three of them disappeared with a clap.</p>
<p>They landed gracefully outside their shop. The twins were great at apparition. They had often bragged about passing their test on their first try, with distinction too. It was something they held over their brother Charlie, who took the test twice before he passed.</p>
<p>"Are you sure that you should be leaving your sister's wedding?" Hermione asked in when Fred began to open the door leading upstairs into their flat.</p>
<p>"I'm sure she's just happy that we didn't spike her drink." George laughed.</p>
<p>"Cor Forge, imagine what Ginny would do? We'd be in right trouble when it came to pleasing our future wives." Fred laughed.</p>
<p>"Are you not staying the night with your family?" Hermione asked as she followed Fred upstairs with George locking the door at the bottom.</p>
<p>Both men laughed at the question.</p>
<p>"The extended family is staying over tonight, there would be no room. Besides we've got our own place, Granger." George gestured proudly.</p>
<p>"Yeah, we need to keep up appearances as the wizarding world's most eligible bachelors." Fred said with a wink.</p>
<p>"What about you?" George asked.</p>
<p>"What about me?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Where are you spending the night?" Fred wiggled his eyebrows at her.</p>
<p>She fought the blush that made the way across her face. </p>
<p>Why was she blushing? These were the Weasley twins, they used to make her furious in her fifth year and now they're making her blush. </p>
<p>What's wrong with me? She thought to herself.</p>
<p>"I had planned to stay at the burrow but if Ron is going to be there with his date… I'll probably just head home." She said dejectedly.</p>
<p>"You don't have to go-" Fred said.</p>
<p>"-Yet, he means. You don't have to go home yet." George said quickly once she had raised an eyebrow at Fred's suggestion.</p>
<p>She thought about staying with them. </p>
<p>The twins made her smile.</p>
<p>They were funny. </p>
<p>They made her forget about Ron. </p>
<p>They were fit.</p>
<p>That last thought made her pause. She took another look at the twins. They were practically identical except for George's missing ear and Fred's slight limp. He's had it ever since being crushed by that wall during the Second Wizarding War.</p>
<p>She had always thought they were handsome, in a roguish sort of way. Even back in fifth year when she threatened to write to their mother about them testing products on first years, the twinkle in their eyes almost made her lose her composure.</p>
<p>"What do you want to do?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Anyone for a game of exploding snap?" George asked, a pack suddenly appearing in his hand.</p>
<p>Hermione wasn't overly fond of the idea of losing her eyebrows, but she also didn't want to leave the twins. If she went home now, she'd only think of Ron and cry herself to sleep.</p>
<p>"One game." She held up one finger and made to sit in the centre of the couch. While George set up the game and Fred got everyone a fire whiskey, she took the time to look around their flat.</p>
<p>It was definitely a bachelor pad. There was an eclectic array of furniture and knickknacks. The walls were a deep maroon and were littered with family photos and patents for their products. She felt right at home. She could've sworn that this couch was an exact replica of the Gryffindor common room couch.</p>
<p>"Right so, one game?" George laid out the cards.</p>
<p>"And six drinks." Fred called as he came in with three glasses of firewhisky and three bottles of butterbeer.</p>
<p>"You know that you shouldn't mix drinks, right?" Hermione asked as she took a bottle of butterbeer.</p>
<p>"Where's the fun without a bit of risk?" Fred smirked as he held out the glass of firewhisky to her.</p>
<p>She eventually took the glass from him when it was obvious that he wasn't going to take no for an answer.</p>
<p>The night progressed quickly after that. When they finished their game, their firewhiskys and butterbeers, Hermione was a little tipsy whereas the twins, who had been drinking at<br/>
wedding, were a little worse for wear.</p>
<p>They had turned on the wireless and were listening to random songs when the Weird Sisters came on.</p>
<p>"Do you remember when they performed at the Yule Ball?" George asked as he went to turn up the volume.</p>
<p>"Yeah you were the talk of the ball, Hermione." Fred winked at her.</p>
<p>She blushed at the memory. Even though she went with Viktor Krum, she did remember how well the twins were dressed that night.</p>
<p>"Yeah, too bad our baby bother had to run his mouth just because you didn't go with him."</p>
<p>"Can we not talk about Ron, please?" She asked when it seemed like the boys were about to ask her about that night.</p>
<p>"We don't have to talk." Fred held put his hand. At that moment 'Magic works' came on.</p>
<p>Apprehensively she took the offered hand and Fred began to sway with her to the music.</p>
<p>He then began to spin her around in time with the song. She was surprised when he gracefully swapped places with George on the last spin.</p>
<p>She laughed when she noticed he had a rose in a mouth.</p>
<p>"Where did that even come from?" She was now being dipped as the song ended.</p>
<p>"Magic, love." George said as it disappeared. He was always brilliant at wandless magic. Both of the twins were.</p>
<p>She fought the blush that was constantly on her face that night and looked over to the fireplace.</p>
<p>"Wow, would you look at the time?" Hermione glanced at the cuckoo clock on top of mantle.</p>
<p>"It's only one in the morning." Fred said turning off the wireless.</p>
<p>"I should probably go." Hermione went to the couch to collect her bag and shoes that she had taken off.</p>
<p>"You could stay if you want?" George gestured to the hallway opposite the living room.</p>
<p>"Do you have a spare bedroom?" Hermione asked as she looked down the hall.</p>
<p>Both twins looked at each other and seemed to be having one of their telepathic conversations.</p>
<p>"We have two bedrooms, but I suppose we could come to some arrangement."</p>
<p>Hermione knew what they were implying. She didn't want to go home but she also didn't want the twins to get any ideas. Just as she was about to decline, she came up a solution.</p>
<p>"If I'm going to stay…Here's how this is going to work."</p>
<p>Xxx</p>
<p>The next day</p>
<p>"Has anyone seen Hermione?" Molly asked as everyone was seated at the kitchen table.</p>
<p>"Not since last night." Arthur said not taking his eyes off the Daily Prophet. There was a picture of Harry and Ginny on the front page.</p>
<p>"She looked upset." Fleur said.</p>
<p>"I wonder why." Molly gave Ron a pointed look, but he was practically inhaling his breakfast.</p>
<p>"I thought I saw Hermione heading off with the twins." Bill said hiding a smirk as he drank his tea.</p>
<p>"What?" Ron, apparently forgetting about his food was now on his feet. "Those gits are dead when I find them." His hair was still blue, but it was slowly returning to normal.</p>
<p>"Yeah, they looked like they were having fun." Bill was now openly smirking at a fuming Ron.</p>
<p>"When I get my hands on them-." Ron grabbed his wand and made his way over to the floo. He grabbed a handful if powder and called out for his brothers' apartment.</p>
<p>When he came out into their flat. He found bottle of butterbeer and a set of exploding snap on the floor. And Hermione's shoes.</p>
<p>He could hear movement coming from the bedrooms down the hall. He walked over to the one on the left and could her someone shuffling on the other side. The door had an F on it, so he assumed that this was Fred's room. He opened the door slightly and saw the outline of one person lying in the bed, under the duvet.</p>
<p>He closed the door as quietly as he could and moved onto George's room. He could hear more shuffling from the other side of the door.</p>
<p>He opened the door and saw what looked like two bodies under the covers.</p>
<p>"What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?" Ron yelled waking up the sleeping pair.</p>
<p>"What?" Georges groggy voice carried form under the covers.</p>
<p>"How could you do this to me, Hermione?" Ron was now frantically pacing at the end of the bed. The other bedroom door opened the person and walked towards the noise Ron was making. "With my own brother." Ron was now pulling at his blue hair.</p>
<p>"Ron, what are you doing here?" A groggy Hermione asked. But she wasn't in the bed.</p>
<p>Ron turned around at the sound of her voice to see a sleepy Hermione in one of Fred's jumpers and boxers.</p>
<p>"Hermione? If you're here than who's in there?" He turned back to the bed to see both his brothers sitting up watching their little brother have a melt-down.</p>
<p>"Bloody hell, I knew the two of you were close but not that close." Ron said in disgust.</p>
<p>"Don't be a git." Fred said as he got out of bed. He was wearing only a pair of pyjama pants, George was the same. Hermione tried very hard to avert her gaze from them.</p>
<p>"Yeah, Ron. We offered Hermione a place to stay last night when she was upset. And being the gentlemen that he is Fred gave up his bed and me, being the gentlemen that I am, offered to give up my bed for Fred, but our couch isn't big enough for me." He gave Hermione a wink to which she gave him a blush in return and a look of disgust from Ron. </p>
<p>"Besides, we've shared a bed before. So, get your head out of your arse."</p>
<p>"So, nothing happened between the tw-three of you last night?" Ron asked after he got over his shock.</p>
<p>"Apart from Hermione agreeing to another date with us, no nothing." Fred and George smirked.</p>
