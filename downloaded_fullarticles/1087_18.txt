    <p>„Harry, you know I did this for you right?” Ginny looked at him with her eyebrows raised. Harry knew this look all too well. She was unhappy that he was complaining. In fact, this look had started to get his daily reminder of the happy days the two of them had <em>had</em>. Something had changed when he had asked her to marry him after almost seven years of being boyfriend and girlfriend.</p><p>Sighing, Harry nodded. “I know, Ginny. It just feels weird to have someone comment on how to dance properly. I don’t think I’ve ever had a proper dance lesson, except with McGonagall.”</p><p>He had to admit that those lessons hadn’t much helped. It was only once and she only showed them how to dance for about ten minutes. Then it was up to them and Harry had to remember that even while he was dancing on the dance floor at the Yule Ball, he had felt extremely awkward.</p><p>Ginny rolled her eyes. “This didn’t do so much for your dancing, though.” Where earlier in their relationship, this might have been a joke, it was quite clearly meant as an insult. </p><p>Harry bit his lips and didn’t know what to say. How did their beautiful relationship turn sour and when even did that happen? How could he not have realized it until now?</p><p>They were standing in a Muggle dancing studio, in a huge room surrounded by mirrors, into which a young man had led them before telling them that his boss would be there in a second. Harry wasn’t feeling alright, he had always hated to look at himself in a mirror and now these were everywhere. He could see himself from every angle and he did not like what he saw. His clothes were okay, finally not too big and baggy. But his hair was weird and he felt as if he needed to shave again, even though he was sure he had shaved just this morning.</p><p>His fiancé grinned at the mirrors, looking very comfortable. Right now, she was looking at her ass, which could actually be seen very well from the loose dancing clothes she was wearing right now. Her hair was quite long, but she had charmed it into a shorter braid.</p><p>Harry sighed and rolled his eyes. Ginny was a good enough dancer, but the lessons she was giving him were tough and fast and he had stopped to understand anything after just two hours. So, they came here and Ginny had made it clear that her husband-to-be needed the dancing lessons, not her.</p><p>Saved from answering anything, the door opened and a young man with blond hair entered. As he closed the door, he suddenly seemed to realize who was standing there. Harry did so as well and even Ginny recognized him and stopped dead in her tracks, though probably not for the same reason as the two men had.</p><p>*</p><p>
  <em>”Draco, we can’t just keep meeting in the Room of Requirements! Everyone at Hogwarts knows about it! They’ll find out eventually!” Harry looked around and shook his head. Even the thought of being found out sent shivers down his spine. He didn’t want to be outed yet. He wasn’t even sure if he actually was supposed to be in this relationship. Well… He wanted to be in this relationship, because it felt so good, but was it even going to last after Hogwarts?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The Slytherin grinned and pulled him closer. “So what? Let them come; we can fight those idiots together! It’s only four more weeks until we’re finally done with Hogwarts and can live together!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry freed himself and shook his head. He felt tears running down his face and it seemed that this was the moment Draco realized that they were probably not going to move in together or even be together. He stepped back and narrowed his eyes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Do you even love me, Harry?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Breathing heavily, Harry held his hand in front of his eyes, more tears streaming down his face. He needed a minute to compose himself, before he could answer, so that his voice wasn’t shaking even more. “Yes, Draco. Yes, I do!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>When he opened his eyes, he had spoken to an empty room. Draco was gone.</em>
</p><p>*</p><p>The fact that they would be meeting again almost nine years after the eighth year at Hogwarts, seemed to be a huge coincidence. Especially because Harry knew that Ginny would have never chosen this dance studio if she’d known.</p><p>“Malfoy? What are you doing here?” she asked and put her hands at her hips.</p><p>Draco’s eyes had been glued to Harry, but he soon turned to Ginny and smiled slightly, though it didn’t seem to be a happy one. “I am your dance instructor.” He looked very tense, though Harry was sure that only he could see it, since he was hiding it quite nicely.</p><p>The man did look good; he had never gotten over a change of his hair, so it was almost the same as in Hogwarts, though not as slick. His body form was fit and even showing muscles through the clothes. And speaking of his clothes, he was wearing black elastic joggers and a red hoodie, probably not expecting so see someone recognizing the Gryffindor colors. In fact, Harry remembered having gifted him that exact hoddie for Christmas, telling him to get used to the red, because he was going to see a lot of it in the future.</p><p>It was quiet for a while, where Harry looked at the ground, not willing to meet either of the other’s eyes. Ginny was the one who brought him here, so she should decide whether or not she wanted him to be their dancing instructor. Or if they should just run away. Honestly, he would have preferred the second option.</p><p>“Fine” he heard Ginny’s voice after a long break. “But if you do anything that I haven’t given my blessing to, I’ll tell everyone what you’re doing.”</p><p>Harry looked up slightly to see Draco still looking at him. However, as if he had waited for him to look up, Draco turned to Ginny and nodded. “Fine by me.”</p><p>He walked through the room with such confidence, that Harry had a hard time not looking at him, so he turned to his wife-to-be instead. She had narrowed eyes and was frowning at Draco very much. Their new dance instructor didn’t waste any time, but started talking almost immediately.</p><p>“So, what dances have you chosen for the wedding?” he asked and pulled out a piece of paper on a board which was probably making it easier for him to write.</p><p>Ginny’s eyes lit up and Harry frowned at the floor. It was as if she just wanted to get married for the dance, not really for their relationship. He shook his head at this thought and looked back up. Draco had watched him like a hawk and Harry turned slightly red and looked back at the floor.</p><p>“Definitely the typical dances you have at a wedding! Like Waltz, or Foxtrot, Swing, Rumba, Mambo or Salsa! What do you think?” Ginny smiled at the Slytherin broadly. Harry had long ago stopped trying to tell her that he wasn’t comfortable with dancing in front of thousands of people. She had only rolled her eyes and invited more strangers to their wedding.</p><p>Draco chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. “A little much to learn in a few weeks, wouldn’t you agree? How about you choose two or three dances?” As Harry looked up again, Draco looked at him and smiled. He couldn’t really place that smile, but it seemed friendly enough. “H… Potter? Any suggestions?”</p><p>“Oh, he can’t dance. Why would he have suggestions?!” Ginny laughed and rolled her eyes at Harry. He pressed his lips into a fine line and looked back at the floor. His soon-to-be-wife was already talking about two other dances which she wanted to have in their wedding but she wasn’t sure whether or not they were appropriate such an occasion.</p><p>Draco listened to everything and put down the paper. “I think we should start with something every newlywed pair needs to be able to pull off: the Waltz. To see where the two of you are standing, I’d like for you to start dancing.” He placed music into the box and turned around again.</p><p>Ginny pulled his hands towards her and just started; Harry was too confused and embarrassed to do anything against it and just followed her, even though she tried to be the one not leading. However, it must have looked very bad. Harry was not ready to be dancing in front of Draco. He was not ready in the slightest!</p><p>After about two full minutes, the music stopped and Draco frowned at the two of them. “I see. There are some problems and I can’t work with all of them at once. I’d like for you two to have separate dates, until we have the same dancing level. Then we can start this again. When’s the wedding? In seven weeks, right?”</p><p>Ginny once again smiled broadly and Harry felt as if he was going to be sick. How had he asked her to marry him? How had he not seen this earlier?!</p><p>“Correct! In seven weeks! We wanted to be prepared for our wedding, so we’re starting early!” She jumped a little and threw her hands around Harry’s neck. The longer this went on, the more confused Harry became. Also, Ginny thought it was early to start dancing lessons seven weeks before the wedding? Maybe it was for her, but not for Harry.</p><p>Draco nodded at them and smiled once again. “Very good. I would prefer for the two of you not to dance together for a while – let’s say four weeks. After that we’re doing partner lessons. Are you happy with that?”</p><p>Ginny nodded and Harry shrugged his shoulders, before nodding as well. He was not looking at Draco, since he had no idea how to work with their past. Draco might have moved on, he never had. Ginny was just supposed to be a rebound, but until an hour ago, he had actually never realized how much he didn’t like to be in this relationship. And now they were getting married?!</p><p>“Well” Draco started again. “Weasley, I think you’re a better dancer, so I’ll refer you to Alejandro, he’s one of our professional dancers and I think you could learn a lot from him.”</p><p>Harry looked at Ginny again and her eyes were even bigger and happier than before. Draco was definitely doing something right. “Sadly, we don’t have that many other free teachers, so I’ll be overlooking your progress… Potter.”</p>
