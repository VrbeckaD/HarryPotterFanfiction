          <div class="userstuff"><p>Dear person I like…</p><p>I know you are indifferent of me. I know you only come to me when you want something. You’re terribly selfish and use me to make your life easy. And I understand and accept and and love you anyway.</p><p>Sometimes you lay with me. Other times you lay on me and use me as a pillow and get mad if I try to move. I know you’re only using me for your own comfort but I’m thrilled either way because it makes me feel loved.</p><p>Sometimes you make that guttural sound that makes it feel like everything is okay in the world and I love laying my head close to your belly so I can hear it better.</p><p>I like how you won’t let me neglect you. You DEMAND attention. Even on my bad days when I don’t feel like dealing with life, you scream at me and knock things over until I pull my depressed arse out of bed to take care of you. </p><p>You are literally the only reason I get out of bed some days.</p><p>Dear person I like…</p><p>you are my cat.</p></div>
