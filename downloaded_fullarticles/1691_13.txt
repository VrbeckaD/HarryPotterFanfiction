    <p>Malfoy was coming closer and closer and for every step he took, Harry backed up further. Soon there was no more space and he found himself trapped against the wall.</p>
<p>His pulse began racing as Malfoy kept coming closer and reached out to put a hand on either side of Harry’s head.</p>
<p>Malfoy was now so close that Harry could feel his breath on his skin as he stared with surprise into gray, almost silver, eyes.</p>
<p>A smirk slowly crept onto Malfoy’s lips and Harry was sure he could see, no, <em>feel</em> how nervous he was.</p>
<p>Why was he nervous? It’s not like they haven’t fought before, but this was different, this wasn’t a fight. Not a regular one at least. No spells were thrown; no mean, hurtful words.</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure what was happening; a few minutes earlier this <em>had</em> been a regular fight, but this was something else entirely.</p>
<p>He focused back on the eyes in front of him and a spark shot down his spine at the heat in them.</p>
<p>«Do I make you nervous, Potter?» Malfoy asked in a smug, raspy voice and for some reason his legs went weak.</p>
<p>«N-no» Harry tried, but his stammering voice gave him away.</p>
<p>Malfoy’s smirk widened and Harry closed his eyes from embarrassment.</p>
<p>Harry felt Malfoy shift and startled when hot breath hit his ear.</p>
<p>«You’re not the tiniest bit intimidated by me, standing this close?» he asked.</p>
<p>«No..I..never» he tried again, uselessly.</p>
<p>Malfoy shifted again, Harry could feel his hair tickling his cheek. «Not at all worried about what I’ll do to you?» came the hot whisper against his neck and Harry couldn’t suppress the whimpering sound from his throat.</p>
<p>Malfoy’s head snapped back and Harry finally opened his eyes again. A sly smile took form on the other boy’s face.</p>
<p>«Do you, perhaps, want me this close to you? …Do you want me, Harry?»</p>
<p>«Yes»</p>
<p>He doesn’t know what came over him, the words were out before he could even think them. It was barely a whisper, but clearly loud enough for Malfoy to hear.</p>
<p>Malfoy’s eyes went wide with shock. Harry could feel a blush start spreading from his chest to the tips of his ears as he looked at Malfoy with an equal amount of shock.</p>
<p>«You do?» Malfoy whispered back.</p>
<p>Harry was about to protest, but found it harder to say no than it had been to say yes. Almost as if..<em>almost as if it was true</em>. Oh my God, he wanted Malfoy. Harry Idiot Potter wanted Draco Sodding Malfoy. He almost laughed at the revelation, but then he met Malfoy’s eyes again and couldn’t bring himself to.</p>
<p>He looked almost vulnerable; his eyebrows drawn and eyes worried.</p>
<p>Was he afraid Harry didn’t want him? Or was he afraid that he did?</p>
<p>Now Harry was worried himself, but decided to gather all his gryffindor courage and tell the truth.</p>
<p>«Apparently I do, yeah» he said softly, hoping it was the right answer.</p>
<p>It must have been, because soon a smile, an actual, genuine smile, spread on Malfoy’s face.</p>
<p>«You do» he sighed with what sounded like relief, but then his face fell again. «This isn’t some sort of plot to humiliate me, is it?»</p>
<p>Harry smiled at his worriedness, suddenly (maybe always) finding it endearing.</p>
<p>«No, it couldn’t be, I’m as shocked as you are. Also, right me if I’m wrong but, <em>you</em> were the one who trapped <em>me</em> against the wall, being all seductive and basically begging me to fall for you» Harry over exaggerated.</p>
<p>«Oh shut up, Potter»</p>
<p>Harry smirked «make me, Malfoy»</p>
