          <div class="userstuff"><p dir="ltr" align="left">You see yourself in Albus Dumbledore’s bed before you even know<br/>
his name. You see a lot of things about Albus, actually</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">(<em> silver hair and beard, wizened black hand, phoenix feather, rings</em><br/>
<em> tangling in a boy’s black hair, a wardrobe on fire, leaning over a</em><br/>
<em> pensieve with another black-haired boy</em> )</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">, but that is by far the most important.<br/>
There’s no need to rehash the introduction, the part where your<br/>
great-aunt calls you into the parlor to meet the neighbor boy. You<br/>
know everything you need to know about Albus Dumbledore before<br/>
you even know his name, or, at fifteen you <em> think </em> you do,<br/>
<br/>
you think you have the whole world laid out in front of you,</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">and at fifteen you feel invincible. You can have anything you want,<br/>
darling boy, and what you want is <em> him </em>. Because he’s older and<br/>
wonderful and you like the way his mouth moves to form spells and<br/>
because you’ve seen yourself in his bed.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">The Sight doesn’t usually latch onto people like this. You see small<br/>
snapshots of most people you meet, but Albus is <em> special </em></p><p dir="ltr" align="left">and at fifteen you decide that means you’re destined to be together.<br/>
You’re fifteen and you’ve never met someone who understands you<br/>
before, and no one ever told you going after older boys would only<br/>
end in a broken heart.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">You trade fantasies about ruling the world, as most foolish young<br/>
revolutionaries dream of one way or another, and he reads you<br/>
fairytales.<br/>
He makes you feel special too, doesn’t he? He makes you feel loved. In<br/>
Albus’s bedroom<br/>
and <em>only</em> in his bedroom<br/>
you are not that troubled boy who has no place being around other<br/>
children. He spreads you on the floor and dissects you with his eyes.<br/>
This part comes later.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">He kisses you halfway through <em> The Warlock’s Hairy Heart </em>. This should<br/>
be momentous, but you’ve already had the end spoiled for you. Albus<br/>
pushes you onto your back and plies you with soft words and kisses to<br/>
the insides of your thighs. The warlock dies with a heart in each hand.<br/>
You keep thinking, if you give up enough pieces of yourself, you’ll get<br/>
Albus in return. You fail to realize relying on your Sight to know him is<br/>
not the same thing. Albus does not give himself up willingly, but you?</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">You let him do this because you think you’re supposed to want it too.<br/>
No one ever told you you’d be this nervous. No one ever told you he’d<br/>
take so much from you. By the second time you think you could get used<br/>
to this; and you make a habit</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">of sneaking over to the Dumbledore house at night and tapping at his<br/>
window until he lets you in. You make a habit of sleeping next to him,<br/>
and sometimes you dream of kissing him in the garden two weeks from<br/>
now and sometimes you dream about sparks and spells flying in a ruined<br/>
city, you on your knees, an unfamiliar wand spinning in the air between<br/>
you. Sometimes you dream of his whipping boys, and there’s at least two<br/>
of them, both with dark hair and dark eyes, but you were his <em> first </em> and<br/>
that’s what matters.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Tom and Severus and Gellert and Harry. You learn these names. The<br/>
las boy, Albus is kindest to. The last boy, Albus doesn’t touch, though he<br/>
might as well have. But he doesn’t wind his fingers in that boy’s hair<br/>
like he does<br/>
the others,<br/>
and if he pulls too hard on your curls you never say anything one way<br/>
or another.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">You are learning what it means to be Gellert Grindelwald through his eyes.<br/>
There has to be some other future out there, somewhere…</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">There are a lot of things your visions can tell you, but they can’t ever tell you<br/>
if he loved you back. You knew, didn’t you? Late July, with the sun setting<br/>
on everything in sight.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">When you run, it’s away from him. And you keep hoping something is<br/>
going to follow, you keep hoping this isn’t where you&amp;him end, but Albus<br/>
never chases after and you keep running.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">You’re fifteen and you wish you’d heard the end of that story, that fairytale<br/>
he was reading you. The warlock dies with a heart in each hand, and you’ve<br/>
already given Albus yours.</p></div>
