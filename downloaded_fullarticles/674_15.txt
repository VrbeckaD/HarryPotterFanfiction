    <p>
  <span>“Pardon me!” Said Draco, bolting down the hallways of St. Mungo’s, pale green robes snapping behind him. He burst through the double doors of the Emergency Department, his hands already spelled clean and ready to get to business.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dr. Black, we’ve got a geist victim. We received the message from the Aurors who are escorting the patient as we speak.” Said Cornwell, a Surgery assistant, a rank lower than Draco’s own; Surgical Healer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do we know the condition?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, sir.” She said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ve got arrival, geist victim, calling Healer Black and Assistant Cornwell” Announced the nurse at the entrance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco and Cornwell rushed to the front, where two Aurors were holding up a woman in all black clutching her side. Looking at the Aurors, Draco realized that they were none other than Weasley and Potter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Accio Gurney</span>
  </em>
  <span>!” Casted Draco, easing the patient onto it. “My name is Healer Black, this is Assistant Cornwell, and we’ll be in charge of your care. Can you please tell me your full name?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The patient gripped his wrist tightly, wincing. “Theresa Bushwick” Her voice was weak and hoarse sounding. “One of them got me. A big one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Ms. Bushwick.” He turned to Weasley and Potter. “Did you administer any spells to her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just one,” Said Potter. “To try and stop the bleeding. It didn’t work very well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco felt her grip lessening. When he glanced back down, here eyes were fluttering. The gurney was covered in blood. “Assistant Cornwell, I need you to get an Operating Room ready for us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cornwell nodded and ran off to the OR desk. Her hand slipped from his wrist. Draco casted a monitoring spell, the sinking feeling in his gut proving correct: her vitals were slipping, and fast. “OR nine is open, Doctor!” Said Cornwell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco raised the bars on the gurney. “Let’s go, Cornwell.” Cornwell took the other side of the gurney and they ran to the OR, leaving Potter and Weasley behind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s under the Ministry’s witness protection program,” said Ron, explaining to the nurse at the front desk they had to accompany Bushwick through the operation. Harry was standing behind Ron, trying not to think about the blood smeared across his Auror uniform. His mind settled on the healer that met them and took Brushwick away. It was Malfoy, but he was using a different name. Black. Narcissa Malfoy’s maiden name.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hadn’t spoken or seen Malfoy in over a decade, ever since the trial. His father went to Azkaban for the rest of his life, his mother got house arrest. Malfoy got away with no charges, only probation for several years. It seemed like the snotty rich kid he’d known at Hogwarts had disappeared at the trial. Back then, it was solemn, hauntedness he’d seen from him on the stand. Now, Harry saw none of the Hogwarts snobbery, and none of the defeatedness, either. Good for him, thought Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can’t go into the OR, but you can go to the observation room for OR 9. Once she’s out of the operation, you can be in the same room as her in the post-op wing.” Said the nurse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s good.” Said Ron.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This way, then.” Said the nurse, getting up from her chair and gesturing for them to follow her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This part of St. Mungo’s wasn’t at all the same as the recovery wings. There were no potted plants, only the severe cleanliness of the muggle hospitals he’d been in before. They walked down a brightly-lit hallway with healers in light green robes, assistants in light blue, and nurses in pastel yellow walking, talking and sometimes running.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The nurse opened a door with “observation room” displayed in silver letters beside two double doors crowned with a large nine. “You’ll be in here for several hours, depending on how severe the damage is. Dr. Black is a very thorough surgeon, so he does take longer, but his survival rate is among the best. I wouldn’t be too worried.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you.” Said Harry as he entered the observation room. Under bright lights was Bushwick’s abdomen, her chest and legs covered in surgical drapes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy approached with the other doctor he’d been with, Cornwell, in what looked like the scrubs muggle surgeons wore. “Scalpel, please.” Said Malfoy, hand and long, thin fingers held out. Cornwell placed the instrument in his hand. “Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry winced as the blade connected with Bushwick’s skin. His hands were still trembling from seeing her fall to the ground after the geist had attacked her. Well, when the wizard who had attempeted to murder her had hurt her. He’d summoned the geist, and ordered it to kill her. The wizard, a murderer who had been trying to pick off the Ministry’s curse breakers, for a reason the Department of Magical Law Enforcement had attempted time and time again to unearth, had already tried to murder two other curse breakers. The wizard had found her despite the efforts of the eyewitness protection protocol.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that… is that really him?” Asked Ron. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.” Said Harry. Ron must have been thinking about Malfoy as a distraction, too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He seems so different. Nicer. Didn’t expect he’d go into healing. Well, I guess we expected him to do dark magic before.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron turned to Harry. “It’s not your fault, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry sighed. “I know. I just </span>
  <em>
    <span>feel </span>
  </em>
  <span>like it is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How were we supposed to know that he knew where the safe house was? There’s like dozen people, tops, who do. We did all we could.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded. He tried not to look at the surgery occurring below to much, the sight of all the blood making his heart pang. A flash of blue caught his eye though, so he looked down. Malfoy had casted a spell, a little trail of blue that descended into Theresa’s abdomen. Harry guessed it was to look for bleeds.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy was handed different tools to shift organs about for a better look, searching for, Harry guessed, the blue indicator of a bleed. Cornwell replaced emptied bags of blood for transfusion, and observed some glowing orbs (more monitor spells? Harry didn’t know for sure) as Malfoy worked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry heard Malfoy spotting small bleeds and mending them through the magical sound system, a knot tightening in his stomach. There was more than one. He could feel his hope slipping even though he remembered what the nurse said about Malfoy being “thorough.” He hoped that was enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry wondered how Malfoy could keep so calm and collected doing things like this. Surely surgery was stressful. He marveled at how during the entire time he’d been at St. Mungo’s he hadn’t seen Malfoy break a sweat once.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just as Harry thought this to himself, Malfoy went perfectly still. The air went thick and heavy. Something was wrong.</span>
