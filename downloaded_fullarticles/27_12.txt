    <p>She had lost them. She couldn't believe she had lost them. The three of them had been running to the Shrieking Shack to find Nagini when Rabastan Lestrange cut her off from her two best friends. Now she was stuck dueling a Death Eater instead of helping Harry destroy one of the last Horcruxes. So focused on fighting to stay alive, she couldn't even begin to think about how they would destroy the final Horcrux. Hermione was fighting with all she had, determined to bring down one of Voldemort's inner circle but he was a formidable opponent and he was backing her out of the courtyard, away from all of the fighting.<br/><br/>"Give it up, little girl. You're never going to beat me," he taunted as they continued to move away from the battle.<br/><br/>He glanced over his shoulder to see if there was anybody behind them and she knew this was her chance to gain the upper hand. She sent a disarming spell and a stunner, one right after the other, but both hit a shield charm he must have cast wandlessly and bounced right off. Her shock gave him a split second advantage and he hit her with a body bind. Rabastan hurried over to her as he reached into his robes and pulled out a vial.<br/><br/>"What are you going to do to me? I will fight you with everything I have!" The curly-haired witch screamed at him.<br/><br/>As he got closer to her though, he didn't look as if he was going to hurt her, he lookedâ€¦..scared. Terrified, in fact.<br/><br/>He kept glancing over his shoulder to make sure nobody saw them and then put up a strong Notice Me Not. Hermione noticed he now had unstoppered the vial and grabbed her face.<br/><br/>"Drink this. Now!" He ordered her.<br/><br/>"No! I will not allow you to kill me easily!"<br/><br/>He didn't have the time for her to fight him. He gripped her chin and forced her mouth open, poured the potion in, and held her mouth closed so she couldn't spit it out. He immediately began to see the slight changes to her; transforming her from the eighteen-year-old she was to her sixteen-year-old self.<br/><br/>"What did you do to me? What did you force on me?" She was screaming at him.<br/><br/>He didn't have much time left. He pulled out his wand and began to undo the glamours placed on her. Her screams tore through the air as the long term glamours that had been a part of her all her life were ripped from her core. The witch's hair changed from chocolate brown to jet black, her eyes from brown with flecks of amber to a deep hazel, and her body was forced to grow a few inches which thinned the already malnourished witch even more.<br/><br/>Her screams turned to sobs. "What are you doing to me? Please! Tell me!" She begged him.<br/><br/>"My time is almost up. You don't belong here. You can change everything though. Save us all. Save me." The Death Eater uncharacteristically begged her.<br/><br/>Still sobbing but unable to move, she cried out. "I don't understand!"<br/><br/>Rabastan stood up and pointed his wand at her once more. "You may not understand, but you will. <em>In Tempore Pacatum.</em>"<br/><br/>A blinding white light left his wand and hit Hermione Granger in the middle of her chest before she could say anything else. Then her world went black.</p>
