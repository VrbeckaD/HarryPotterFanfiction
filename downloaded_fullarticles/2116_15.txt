    <p>“It must be rather thoroughly infected with Nargles,” Luna says thoughtfully, waving away a shred of black smoke rising from the car’s engine.</p><p>Blaise grimaces, but doesn’t try to contradict her. For all he knows, it’s actually true. “Whatever the cause of it is, I doubt we can fix it ourselves,” he says disgustedly, and casts a critical eye over the façade of the motel above them. There are probably worse places to stay, but honestly, Blaise hasn’t encountered many of them.</p><p>Luna taps one sparkly, scarab-tipped nail against her lips. “I suppose not,” she agrees, but gives Blaise a smile. “Muggles have a system for this sort of thing, I expect.”</p><p>Muggles are, indeed, rather more prepared than a lot of pureblood rumor makes them out to be, Blaise admits. They likely do have some sort of system for fixing broken cars, though hell if Blaise knows it. It will be awkward to ask, too, because they can only get away with so much ignorance by claiming to be foreigners. So far the Muggles they’ve met have been willing to take the excuse at face value, but at some point someone in America is going to call them on it, and Blaise doesn’t have a good answer for when they do.</p><p>“Do you know the closest city with a wizarding district?” Luna asks, and steps back, letting the bonnet drop with a dull thud. “Perhaps there's someone there who can evict the Nargles.”</p><p>Blaise rubs a hand over his short hair and pulls a face. “Close in normal terms, or close in American terms?” he asks dryly, and Luna laughs. She hooks an arm through his, settling back against the side of the car and leaning into Blaise.</p><p>“Somewhere we can reach,” she says, and tips her head, wrinkling her nose. “I’d thought I was good at long-distance Apparation.”</p><p>“So did I,” Blaise mutters, and long distances in Britain and Scotland are one thing; long distances in America are something else entirely. Especially in this area of it, it seems. He and Luna had expected to be able to Apparate to a few major cities, hop around a bit and see the sights, but one jump from the New York City office had put the somewhere in suburban hell in southern New Jersey, and an Auror going the same direction had practically laughed herself sick when she realized why they were so confused. It had been her recommendation to rent a car for their trip, and Blaise hadn’t bothered to tell her neither of them had a license. Confounding the salesman had been simple enough, and figuring out how to drive hadn’t taken more than a few hours once they put their minds to it.</p><p>(Magic helps. Blaise isn't entirely sure how Muggles manage to pilot their vehicles without sensing charms, and he isn't entirely sure he wants to find out, either.)</p><p>“Perhaps it’s a sign,” Luna suggests, and she’s a frail weight against Blaise's side, thin and fair and more like a wisp of a dream than a dangerous witch. Blaise curls his arm around her almost automatically, and she casts a vague smile up at him. “Something is telling us to stay a little longer.”</p><p>“The car,” Blaise mutters, giving it a dirty look, but when Luna pokes him he relents with a sigh. “Oh, very well. I suppose a few more days here won't hurt.”</p><p>Luna laughs a little, and spins away from him with a flare of chaotically layered skirts. The combination of plaid and zebra print offends something soul-deep in Blaise, but when he tried to broach the subject Luna told him a Blithering Humdinger had taken up residence in his brain, and Blaise hasn’t been brave enough to try again.</p><p>“Harry was right, don’t you think?” she asks merrily, and her bare feet are silent on the pavement as she heads out of the nearly-empty lot. “This is a lovely vacation.”</p><p>His reservations about Harry Potter came mainly from their school days, and the weight of the war has since crushed them thoroughly. Blaise smiles crookedly, following the wind-swept tangles of blonde hair as Luna makes for the main street of the tiny town. He’d approached Potter after the battle, offered his hand and had it accepted, but—he hadn’t expected this. Hadn’t thought that his fragile friendship with Luna would last through the Carrows and out the other side of the war, turn into something that landed Blaise in the middle of the Muggle world with no map, no plan, no easy way back to the Wizarding World, and only Potter's <em>you might enjoy it, Zabini, you never know</em> to urge him on.</p><p>Broken cars aside, it hasn’t been entirely terrible yet. The Muggle world is far, far vaster than Blaise had ever anticipated, and there's more of it to see than he would have thought. Luna has dragged them far off the beaten path at every opportunity, entirely delighted by some of America’s stranger magical creatures, and Blaise will admit to a certain appreciation for the wide, empty landscapes that are far less frequent in Europe. The magical community here is also different, scattered, less structured. There's a central government, but it’s less the stern authority of the British Ministry and more general, far-off oversight. Blaise isn't entirely sure he likes it.</p><p>Then again, there's no Lord Voldemort here. Blaise supposes that’s a point in their favor.</p><p>“Do you think there are Moon Frogs nearby?” Luna asks when he falls into step with her, and she’s smiling vaguely, a skip in her step that doesn’t fit the dusty streets of this dry place. “It feels like there should be, doesn’t it?”</p><p>“You're the expert on magizoology,” Blaise says dryly, because he remembers his scores in Care of Magical Creatures <em>very </em>well. It’s always irked him, too. “If they can only be caught by a Dark spell, <em>then</em> I can be of help.”</p><p>Luna laughs loudly at that, like it’s uproariously funny instead of the bitter truth. “<em>Dark</em>,” she says, and cackles. Blaise rolls his eyes, though he can't fight a faint smile. Luna notices far more than most people give her credit for. And—maybe his family isn't Dark, though it’s served their purposes to be thought so. Better, after all, for his mother to be a powerful witch with a taste for killing rich husbands than someone with a touch of something <em>other</em> in her blood.</p><p>Not that she doesn’t have a taste for killing rich husbands, too, but at this point Blaise tends to feel that anyone volunteering to marry her knows full well what they're getting into. And if not, they're stupid enough that their deaths are just natural law and the gene pool self-correcting.</p><p>“Don’t Moon Frogs only come out on the full moon?” he asks, because Luna is still giggling.</p><p>That sobers her a little, and she glances up, even though there's no trace of the moon in the midmorning sky. “I suppose that would make sense,” she says, contemplative. Then she brightens, and says, “Oh, but the manager was telling me about a spot in the river where we could swim, and he said the water there sometimes glows! It <em>must </em>be Moon Frogs!”</p><p>Given Luna's knack for finding creatures wherever they go, Blaise is hardly about to argue. “Is it close enough to walk to?” he asks.</p><p>“Everything is close enough to walk to, provided there's time,” Luna says cheerfully, and Blaise resigns himself to a very, very long trek, probably in the dark. At least they’ll be able to Apparate on their way back.</p><p>“We should go while it’s still light,” he says, and over the course of their trip he’s seen plenty of Muggles attempting to catch their attention from the side of the road. Hitchhikers, apparently; Blaise supposes a little sourly that it’s a good alternative, now that their car is out of order. When Luna pauses, apparently enchanted by the idea of them dragging themselves over miles of darkened roads and unwilling to compromise, Blaise casts about for a way to sweeten the deal and settles on, “We can pack a dinner and have a picnic by the river.”</p><p>“I think that sounds lovely,” Luna says, though the bright smile she casts him says she sees right through the manipulation. Bloody Ravenclaws, really. “Pizza, again?”</p><p>Blaise grimaces. “That’s not <em>pizza</em>,” he protests, because his ancestors in Italy roll over in their graves every time the word is used on the American <em>abominations</em>.</p><p>Patting his arm, Luna offers up a sympathetic smile. “There, there, Blaise,” she says. “I'm sure they just don’t know better.”</p><p>Blaise has yet to be convinced of that. “It’s <em>not</em>,” he says haughtily, but steps forward to get the door of the diner for Luna before she can reach it. It’s not as though he isn't entirely aware that Luna Lovegood led an army against a Dark Lord at age seventeen, but his mother would box his ears if he didn’t at least make an attempt at manners, even in America.</p><p>“Ice cream sandwiches, then.” Luna skips past him, spinning to take in the diner’s shoddy interior like they haven’t depended on it for their last three meals. Her pale eyes are wide, and the iridescent gnome earrings she’s wearing glitter madly as she turns.</p><p>Entirely amused in spite of himself, Blaise reaches into the satchel he’s carrying and pulls out her sandals. “Luna,” he says, dangling them in front of her with a raised brow.</p><p>Luna comes to a whirling halt and beams at him, plucking them from his fingers and shoving her feet into them. “This works much better than just hoping they’ll come back on their own,” she says.</p><p>By the time Professor Snape took over as Headmaster and the Carrows arrived, things were in dire enough straights that the people who spent most of their time at Hogwarts bullying Luna mostly found other things to do, but some were stubborn and petty enough to keep at it regardless. More than once Blaise had stopped to help her find her books and shoes, hidden around the castle, and then escorted her back to the dorms so that no one would take her being out alone as rule-breaking.</p><p>It hadn’t always worked; Blaise himself was never in favor, viewed with suspicion and distaste because he was a Slytherin who wouldn’t swear himself to Voldemort, after all, and near the end of the war he spent nearly as much time in punishment as some of the Hufflepuffs. But he did what he could, then, and since they’ve started traveling he’s learned her habits, figured out how to adjust for them. It’s so very much a Luna sort of thing, that she walks barefoot practically everywhere but wears her shoes to bed because she has a habit of sleepwalking. Blaise is reluctantly charmed by it, though he supposes that sums up most of his feelings towards Luna in general.</p><p>“I suppose we should make arrangements to get the car seen to,” he says, and their regular booth is occupied by a pair of men, so he picks one a few down, sliding onto the sticky red vinyl with a grimace.</p><p>“Perhaps I can ask the manager,” Luna says, and waves merrily to the waitress. She’s not the younger woman who was in yesterday, which Blaise is entirely relieved about; instead of attempting to flirt, she just smiles perfunctorily at them as she passes over their menus. Even their accents don’t seem to draw any undue attention as she takes their drink orders and heads off.</p><p>“The manager thinks you're quite charming,” Blaise observes, keeping his tone neutral as he checks whether the diner’s offering have changed in the last twelve hours.</p><p>This time Luna's smile is a little wistful, a little crooked, and she looks away. There's a scar on her cheek, earned during her time at Malfoy Manor, and just for a moment the sunlight coming through the windows casts it into sharp relief. “Does he?” she asks vaguely.</p><p>If Blaise knows anything, it’s attraction, and he hums in confirmation, pretending to be caught up in the truly riveting breakfast section. They're both running, in their own ways. This trip is a vacation that’s stretched out into months at this point, and neither of them have so much as mentioned going back to Britain. Maybe it’s not an all-out bolt, their attempt to get away, but it’s certainly a retreat. The war is two years behind them, but it will never be gone.</p><p>“I’ll ask the maid,” Blaise decides, because she at least seemed polite enough, and pleased by his knowledge of Spanish, even if their dialects differ. Happily married, too, so the most she’d given Blaise was an appreciate once-over, which is far better than some reactions.</p><p>“She seems very wise in Muggle matters,” Luna agrees, and the little moment of darkness vanishes as she spreads her menu out in front of her. “Oh, French toast! Do you think there are other kinds as well, like with dragons? Romanian toast, and German toast, and Finnish toast! Maybe there's even British toast and we just haven’t noticed it yet.”</p><p>Blaise snorts, but before he can point out that Weasley's dragonkeeper brother would likely faint at the prospect of comparing dragons to toast, the waitress returns with Blaise's coffee and Luna's milkshake. They’ve both come to an agreement that the tea in America is largely not to be trusted.</p><p>“Ready to order, dears?” she asks, and Blaise glances over at Luna, raising a brow.</p><p>“Another moment, please,” Luna says bright. “I feel like I need Spectrospecs to decide.”</p><p>“You could spin the menu and point,” Blaise suggests, amused, though he flicks a glance at the waitress as she moves away, towards the booth he and Luna used the last few times they were here. The two men who are seated there currently hold his attention for a moment, mostly because the man facing him is handsome in a boyish, slightly rough way Blaise likes. They're both rumpled, clothes worn, and one is hunkered down behind a Muggle device Blaise has seen several people using, though he has yet to figure out what it’s for when it’s barely thicker than a book and looks like a small pane of glass. The other is the one with the nice face, and he’s fiddling with a packet of sugar, slumped back in the seat like he’s entirely at home there.</p><p>Blaise looks down before he can be caught looking, to find Luna doing what he suggested, and is just in time to tug her milkshake out of the way as she stabs a finger down. Leaning over as she opens her eyes, he raises a brow, and says, “I think you're allowed a do-over.”</p><p>“Deep-fried pickles,” Luna says thoughtfully. “I'm not sure how I feel about that.”</p><p>“Do-over,” Blaise says, and gives the menu another light spin. “I don’t think that counts as breakfast, regardless of its status as food. However dubious.”</p><p>“The house elves at Hogwarts certainly never made anything like that,” Luna agrees serenely, but she puts her finger down again, then opens one eye and smiles. “Oh, pancakes and strawberries! I like that.”</p><p>Ordering the same thing sounds far more appealing than putting effort into picking something out for himself, so Blaise closes his menu and sets it aside. “Two of that, then,” he agrees.</p><p>Once the waitress has been by to take their order, Luna sinks back in her seat, pulling her legs up under herself. “Where shall we go next?” she asks brightly.</p><p>“You mean if the car can be fixed?” Blaise pulls a face, though it’s not as though he doesn’t have the funds for another car, should it prove easier to simply replace theirs. Getting it will be a headache, though; he’ll have to Apparate to the nearest large city and have his gold exchanged for Muggle currency, and then Apparate back, which will likely take a few days. Too many Apparations close together and he risks splinching himself. “Where exactly are we now?”</p><p>Luna tips to the side, squinting out the window at the street. “Two Oaks,” she says. “We passed the sign as we drove in.”</p><p>It takes a bit of digging, but Blaise manages to unearth their map from the depths of his bag, and he spreads it out between them, squinting down at the tiny writing. The New York City Apparition point offered maps, but they all seem to be outdated; Blaise found this one at a petrol station a few days ago, and it’s vastly different and far more accurate, thankfully.</p><p>There are, however, at least ten towns he can see with the same name, and he tries to remember any other towns they passed, but the names have mostly blurred together in his mind. They're somewhere in the middle of the state of Texas, but beyond that—</p><p>“Here,” Luna says, leaning over the table to trace her finger down a thin blue squiggle. “This is the river the manager said we could swim in. The Black River.”</p><p>Blaise hopes the name isn't an indication of its look, at least color-wise. The location of the river does make it easier to find the town, though, and he taps his finger against it, scanning the surrounding area. “Is there anything that calls to you?” he asks, and—if only the others in his year could see him now. Draco in particular always complained that Blaise was far too rigid, incapable of having fun or even playing a friendly round of Quidditch without a strict plan. He’d laugh himself sick at the knowledge that Blaise is in the middle of the Muggle world, only vaguely aware of his location, with Loony Lovegood and no idea of where to go next.</p><p>Blaise rather thinks it’s the best vacation he’s ever taken, honestly. Road-tripping across Muggle America with a tabloid heiress and war hero, eating strange food and sleeping in questionable accommodations is a world away from blood purity arguments and the enduring press of reconstruction. This is a longer trip, perhaps, than either of them planned, but—</p><p>Well. Blaise had walked out of the last funeral for one of their classmates and decided he was entirely sick of it all. Sick at heart, in a way he’d once thought himself incapable of, and learning that he was just as effected by grief and sorrow and loss as the rest of the world was a good thing, but…not worth the Carrows.</p><p>Nothing would be worth the Carrows.</p><p>In light of that, in light of this newfound sense of distance, Blaise looks up, looks away from the map and their potential plan. He doesn’t care; wherever they go, it will be better than what they left, and that’s good enough for him.</p><p>“We should get pie,” he says on a whim, because he <em>lets</em> himself follow whims now. When Luna glances up at him, blinking, he clarifies, “For our picnic.”</p><p>Luna’s smile says she sees what he’s thinking, what drives the words. “We should,” she agrees, and looks back down at the map. “Look, Blaise, this place is named the Devil’s Boot! Do you think they’re keeping it safe for him? Has he noticed yet that he’s lost it?”</p><p>“Do you notice when <em>you</em> lose your boots?” Blaise counters.</p><p>Luna beams at him. “That’s what I have you for.”</p><p>…Well. Blaise supposes there are worse things to be tasked with. Still, he rolls his eyes, and Luna laughs, sweeping her finger across the map. Where she stops is empty land, but she hums and tips her head, staring down at it.</p><p>“Three rivers come together here,” she says thoughtfully. “That’s rather splendid, isn’t it? I think I want to go here next.”</p>
