    <p>
  <span>“Bloody hell, where is James?” Gideon Prewett asked, wiping soot from his black robes as he stepped out of the fireplace. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He said he’d be here,” answered Fabian Prewett, his handsome face scrunched as he surveyed the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gideon and Fabian proceeded to mutter an elaborate series of spells to secure the safe house, which appeared more like a run-down, unassuming cottage on the outside.  Ivy grew wildly on the walls, the roof was partially caved in and the lawn resembled a dirt patch. The Order of the Phoenix didn’t even bother to place it under the Fidelius Charm as no one could possibly think anyone actually lived there. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Inside, however, the cottage was quite hospitable, with a working fireplace, a small but functional kitchen, and a modest-sized bedroom.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I guess whoever lived here never heard of an interior decorator,” said Gideon, gesturing towards the yellow couch set against the lime green wall. Fabian simply nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once finished with the charms, the brothers conjured a large sofa and Fabian set about brewing tea.  They settled into a long, tense silence.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The setting sun peered through the living room window and hit Gideon in the eyes.  He stood and began pacing the room, his left hand constantly rubbing the right. “He said he was going to meet us at Figgs,” Gideon finally said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure he just got held up.  He’ll be here,” assured Fabian, but Gideon just snorted in response.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You always assume the best of him,” said Gideon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you think the worse for reasons I will never understand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s an arrogant berk, Fabian.  Everyone knows that. Why Lily would marry him, of all people, is beyond me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not our place to wonder about their marriage.  And often I wonder just why you hold him in such ill regard.”  Gideon started to speak but Fabian held up his hand. “Ah, yes, the famed Potter-Weasley feud. Tell me, brother, why we should concern ourselves with a centuries-old squabble between two families over a couple of goats.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe because our sister married a Weasley And it was a whole herd of goats.,” Gideon said, halting his pacing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If Molly wants to get herself in a tizzy over the Potters because of her husband, who might I add never seemed too concerned with the feud himself, then that’s her right.  But I like James, for what it’s worth. I know Molly has filled your head with stories from school, but James has never come across as arrogant to me. Maybe a little confident, but I trust Lily would not marry someone as awful as who Molly describes,” Fabian said, crossing one leg over the other as he finished his tea.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gideon rubbed his chin. “Right, I’ll give you that much. Lily is a bloody saint of a woman, but blood is thicker than ale, and I’ve seen enough of James to say he’s a git.  A git who is leaving us to fend for ourselves on this mission.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure he will be here.  But if you would like, we can start going over the plan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Might as well since Potter won’t show anytime soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fabian rolled his eyes but began detailing the night’s mission. It was a rather simple mission by Order standards, reconnaissance of suspected Death Eater activity in the small English village of Blockley.  Dumbledore had surmised that Voldemort was doing heavy recruiting in these smaller villages. The local wizarding population was rather bored and looking for trouble. Voldemort provided not only entertainment but purpose for a segment of wizards and witches who felt the Ministry was putting more resources into assimilating Muggleborns than protecting purebloods. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Order was losing the war against Voldemort and recruitment was a major reason why.  The Order and Ministry were clearly the more skilled groups, with Dumbledore, Alastor Moody and the Longbottoms amongst their ranks, but the numbers of Death Eaters swelled to huge levels.  Tonight’s mission was about determining exactly how Death Eaters were being so successful and who exactly was in charge of these efforts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>While Gideon and Fabian were quite different in temperament, they both agreed on a few things: that firewhiskey was best consumed in large quantities, that Doris Caldwell was the most beautiful Hufflepuff in their year, and that Dumbledore was stalling.  The brothers felt that Dumbledore needed to confront Voldemort immediately and vanquish him. Fabian had pled the case several times, as he was the more eloquent and even-tempered of the brothers.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>While Gideon would never give him credit, James Potter was actually a staunch supporter of this belief and was often at Fabian’s side when he implored Dumbledore to act.  Fabian sometimes wondered if that was the reason he liked James when he should hate his guts like his brother and sister, but there was always a running joke that Fabian was adopted since he was far too logical for a Prewett.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We need to go,” said Fabian.  “The meeting is about to start.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not waiting on your boyfriend, eh?” Gideon smirked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fabian ignored his brother and began packing for the short trip. ‘Where </span>
  <em>
    <span>is </span>
  </em>
  <span>James?’ he thought to himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll send a patronus telling him to meet us there. “ Fabian handed a pouch to Gideon. “Remember, remain inconspicuous.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’d be a lot easier with Potter’s cloak. Whole reason the berk was coming on this one,” Gideon said, and Fabian could not argue the point.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nevertheless, we have our orders. Let’s get going.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The two men trudged through a dense forest, pushing branches and twigs out of their path without the use of magic.  The mission itself was not dangerous, but Dumbledore had always warned that magic was difficult to keep hidden, as one never knew who was watching.  This was a lesson Gideon failed to heed many times, and if not for his brother being present, he would have simply just apparated to the inn where the meeting was taking place. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was surprisingly warm this October night, but Fabian still insisted on wearing his billowing cloak.  He loved that cloak, even as it kept getting caught on tree branches while they trudged through the forest. Gideon snickered each and every time.  As for himself, he wore a simple pair of Muggle trousers and a jumper. Perhaps that’s why he liked Arthur so much as they were both fascinated by Muggle culture. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eventually, the pair made it out of the forest and came upon Blockley. It was quiet save for the bark of a stray dog. Fabian led them towards the destination, a nondescript inn called The Cheeky Stag.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s plan?” Gideon asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You must be joking,” replied Fabian.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wouldn’t be me if I wasn’t.” Gideon surveyed the outside of the inn. “You sure this is a wizarding pub? Smack in the middle of a Muggle village doesn’t seem very hidden.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps that’s the idea. Hide in the open. Besides, look at the sign hanging out front.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fabian nodded to a wooden sign hanging over the entrance of the door.  It showed a stag holding a pint of ale, but in the corner was a small stool with a wizard’s hat perched atop it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nice nod to Hogwarts.” Gideon said. “You think we could just grab a seat at the bar?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“First, put on your robes.  I doubt the wizards in here will take kindly to a man in jeans.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> The brothers walked confidently into the pub and made a beeline for the bar.  Gideon side-eyed the gathering of scruffy-looking wizards and a few witches in the back. They matched the vibe of the place quite nicely.  This pub was not for respectable wizards, the pair quickly surmised. It was dirty, for one. It immediately reminded Fabian of the times he was forced to enter the Hog’s Head, usually to drag Gideon out.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bartender was a gruff-looking man who seemed put out to have to actually tend the bar.  His face was covered in scars, most likely earned from years of dealing with rowdy drunks. Gideon ordered two firewhiskeys.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And another for our friend when he arrives,” added Fabian, earning a scowl from his brother.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Busy night for a Tuesday?” Gideon asked the bartender, who merely grunted and walked to the other end of the bar. “Off to a rousing start,” Gideon said quietly to Fabian, who choked on his drink trying to hold his laughter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Damn you,” Fabian said, wiping the drink from his robes.  He turned his back to the bar and began taking stock of the clientele. He raised his eyebrows upon seeing a few familiar faces.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Friends?” asked Gideon, sipping his firewhiskey.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“More like work acquaintances. No need to worry.  They won’t recognize me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gideon was about to press further when a tall wizard dressed too well for the company stood up and called for attention by stomping his cane on the wood floor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Greetings my fellow wizards and witches,” the tall wizard began. “What a tremendous turnout.  It shows that the pure-blooded community is alive and well!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alive, but not so well by the look of them.” Gideon whispered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thank you for coming tonight, and more importantly, my lord thanks you as well,” the wizard continued.For you see, we are building a movement, a movement aimed to restore honor and power to those who truly deserve it.  For too long Muggles have forced us into hiding. For too long Muggleborns have been usurping the magic of true wizards and witches and for too long our Ministry has not just turned the other way, but have actually supported the infiltration of inferiors into our world.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And for too long has my wife turned me down for a shag” Gideon whispered, earning an elbow in his side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Quiet,” Fabian said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And my lord says ‘enough’ to that!’  In this room sit wizards and witches of purity and strength, but the Ministry has made it their mission to hold you down, to keep you from enjoying the world that belongs to you.  They insist on keeping us secret and subservient to the Muggles. They allow those blood-traitors with magic in their blood to dilute it by marrying mongrels of a lesser species.”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The speaker, his face turning tomato red, began banging his cane on the ground as if leading a marching band.  The crowd sat hypnotized. “And so those with pure-blood, the mightiest of all wizards and witches, are dying out.  Because our Ministry allows it. But our Lord says no more. It is time for the people in this room to take their place at the heads of the wizarding world. “</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The crowd shouted in approval and Fabian gave a worried look in Gideon’s direction. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But we cannot simply wait for power to be given back to us.  No, we must take what is rightfully ours. My lord is your lord.  He wishes to bestow power upon you if you merely join him in his crusade. “</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And jest who is this fancy lord?” a rather drunk man shouted from the back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why, Lord Voldemort, of course.” Several gasps rang out from the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Be not afraid, my friends,” the tall wizard assured the crowd. “Lord Voldemort rewards those who are loyal to him and who seek to fulfill his goals.  Those who oppose him will face a different outcome, however. So I ask you all: do you believe in the superiority of the pure blood that runs in your veins?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shouts of “aye” rang out through the pub, sending a shiver down the Prewett brothers’ spines.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And do you believe pure-bloods deserve to lead, not follow?” More shouts of approval greeted the speaker. “And should we hide from Muggles, or rule them?” The crowd rose to their feet and cheered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, time to go,” said Fabian.  He and Gideon threw a few knuts on the bar counter and began weaving their way through the uproarious crowd. They pushed their way out of the pub and into the October night, which had turned cold.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Voldemort just recruited about twenty followers in one small village in one night,” said Gideon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“At this rate not even Dumbledore could stop his army.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We need to get word to the Order,” Fabian replied. “I think we should try to capture that man.  He’s far too charismatic and likely holds a wealth of information.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agreed.  Send your patronus to Dumbledore.  In the meantime I’ll – “ Gideon’s words were cut off as a flash of blue light punched him in the stomach, causing him to double over.  Fabian was at his side in a second.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, isn’t this a fortunate coincidence,” a wizard said from the shadows.  Antonin Dolohov sauntered into the light of the lamppost overhead. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dolohov was not a tall man, but the evil within him made him one of Voldemort’s most imposing and feared soldiers.  His skill laid in the cruelty and severity of his curses. Fabian quickly drew his wand and cast a quick curse at Dolohov, who deflected it with ease.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you want, Dolohov?” Fabian demanded, still crouched over his brother.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, just a friendly chat,” replied Dolohov. “I was interested in what two fine wizards such as yourselves were doing near a filthy pub in the middle of England.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We heard they had a good special on gillywater,” wheezed Gideon, who was slowly rising to his feet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re not looking for a fight,” said Fabian, his wand pointed between Dolohov’s eyes, “and as there are two of us and only one of you, I suggest you retreat to whatever hole you crawled out of.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid your math is a bit off.”  With a snap of his fingers, five more Death Eaters came out of hiding, their wands trained on the brothers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d ask what you were really doing here,” said Dolohov, “but it appears quite obvious that Dumbledore sent you on some sort of information gathering expedition.  Pity he didn’t realize we have ways of knowing exactly who comes and goes from our establishments. What a shame that he will lose two of his best soldiers tonight.  And your poor sister. Molly, isn’t it? What a tragedy to befall her, losing her favorite brothers.” He smiled widely, revealing crooked yellow teeth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Get bent, you bastard!” shouted Gideon.  The Death Eaters began to circle the brothers.  Thinking quickly, Fabian pointed his wand in between two Death Eaters who were trying to get behind them. “Bombardo!” he shouted, and the ground blew up under the Death Eaters feet.  Fabian and Gideon took the opportunity to escape behind a large boulder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can we apparate out of here already?” Gideon yelled as spell upon spell hit the stone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fabian grabbed hold of Gideon, preparing for the familiar sucking sensation, but nothing happened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Damnit! Dolohov must’ve already cast an anti-Apparation spell. We’ll need to fight our way out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How the hell are we going to do that?” Gideon asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck if I know,” Fabian replied,  his voice cracking a bit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gideon peeked out behind the stone to see roughly ten Death Eaters firing. “Looks like we’re really up against it, brother,” Gideon said.  “Alright, I’m going to try something rather dangerous. Cover me!” Gideon stood and began running and firing all at the same time. Fabian launched spell after spell, trying to protect his brother.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Fabian grew tired, there was only one thing he could think of saying at that moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where the bloody hell is James?”   </span>
</p><p>______________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James Potter had the biggest smile plastered on his face when he received a patronus from Frank Longbottom.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“James.  Emergency meeting at headquarters.  Come quick!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh, he was in for it now.  James knew he had flaked on the mission with Gideon and Fabian, but he had a tremendously good reason for it.  He debated for a moment pretending he missed Frank’s patronus, as he was not looking forward to the disappointed face of Albus Dumbledore.  But he had shirked his Order duties, and it was time to face the music. James surmised that once Dumbledore heard his reason for not being there, all would be forgiven.  But he never liked disappointing Dumbledore, even for a second.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go,” a calm voice told him.  He turned to see Lily, positively glowing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think I need to be here with you still,” James said, placing his hand in her hair and running it through like a brush.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, don’t give me that rubbish.  This is just like seventh year when you had Peeves explode the loos in the girl’s bathroom and tried to hide from Dumbledore in my dorm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I kept sliding down the stairs,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And so we hid in the Charms room till dawn.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t recall you complaining then.” James winked, pleased to see Lily’s blush.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, that’s only because I had just started dating you.  Now that we’re married…” Lily smiled and James rolled his eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine, you win.  I’ll go take my lumps.  But you need to get back into bed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Say hi to everyone for me,” Lily said as James took some floo powder in his hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Love you.  Order Headquarters!” he shouted before being engulfed in green flames.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James was unceremoniously dumped out of the fireplace at the aging home of Sirius Black, his best friend since first year at Hogwarts.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He brushed some soot off of his robes before Sirius appeared at his side, grabbing him by the elbow and dragging him into the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You missed the mission,” he stated matter-of-factly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Word travels fast.  So Gideon and Fabian just had to tattle on me to Dumbledore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not at all, in fact,” Sirius said. “I just know you wouldn’t have gone from the mission to your house and then here. That’s where you were, right?”  James nodded. “As it happens, no one has head from Fabian or Gideon. They were supposed to arrive back an hour ago for debriefing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James had a momentary sinking feeling in his stomach, but soon his brain began rationalizing things.  The mission was rather mundane so the chances of any danger were slim. Honestly, he wasn’t really sure why Dumbledore had pushed for him to go.  Sirius had suggested it was a bonding mission, a way to bridge the gap between him and Gideon. James scoffed at the idea. There was no fence mending between the two as long as Molly was married to a Weasley.  Fabian seemed to have some sense about him, which is why he and James could tolerate one another.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I imagine Gideon went and got drunk somewhere.  Probably botched the mission, as simple as it was. Why did Dumbledore call an emergency meeting if they haven’t even arrived back?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius shrugged. “Beats me. But it better be something important.  I had a date with Thompson, you know, from Hufflepuff.” Sirius gave an impish grin.  “Come, they’re about to start. I hope Lily wasn’t too pissed about you leaving her alone. By my count,” he said while checking his watch, “she’s due to pop any day now”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James grabbed his arm before he could enter the kitchen. “It’s funny you should mention that because I have some news to share.” He gave a wide smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can’t wait to hear it, Prongs, but we’re late as it is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James released Sirius and followed him into the dining room, where the long oak table was surrounded with Order members.  There were Frank and Alice Longbottom pressed close together. Mad-eye Moody was eying the room intently, but his magic eye locked onto James as soon as he entered the room.  At the head of the table sat Dumbledore, still as sprightly as ever. James only wished he could look as good as Dumbledore at that age.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But tonight, he did not look good.  Dumbledore had a careworn look on his face, not uncommon these days, but his eyes were especially dark tonight, the bags underneath purple.  He glanced up at James and a smile appeared on his face before quickly disappearing once again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“James,” he began, “I thought--forgive me--but you are just the man I was hoping to see. Please, sit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James tentatively sat at the chair farthest from Dumbledore. Dumbledore looked deep in contemplation.  He wasn’t sure if this was a bad sign. The other Order members, save Moody, looked confused, unsure why they were here.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James knew he was in trouble and quickly surmised that the best defense was a good offense.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look, before we begin, I just want to say I know I messed up by not going on the mission. Something pretty big came up and I just assumed since it was just recon, it would be ok if I didn’t go.  I know, I should’ve sent a patronus but I was so preoccupied by this other thing that it just slipped my mind. As soon as Fabian and Gideon arrive I’ll ...“ James faltered and gritted his teeth, “personally apologize to them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The room was silent as all eyes gradually shifted from James to Dumbledore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you were not with them?” Dumbledore asked pointedly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Er, no. Like I said, something really important came up.  Something great, actually.” James couldn’t help the smile that crossed his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What exactly was so important,” asked Mad-Eye, his gruff voice dripping with hostility, “that you abandoned an Order mission, laddie?” James’ smile disappeared, replaced with a grimace.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alastor, please. This isn’t an interrogation.” Dumbledore rose from his seat. “The reason I called you here tonight is to regretfully inform you that Fabian and Gideon Prewett were ambushed tonight and killed. We recovered the bodies roughly an hour ago.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James’ stomach plummeted. “But, that’s impossible. It was just recon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius had his head in his hands while Alice quietly cried.  Another Order member, Mary Studebaker, slammed her fist on the table.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll ask the question again,” said Mad-Eye. “Why were you not there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And I will remind you again, this is not an interrogation,” Dumbledore insisted. “James had nothing to do with what happened tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that so? Forgive me, Albus, but the Potters have had a centuries-long feud with the Weasleys.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” James cried in anger and slammed the table with his fist. “Are you really suggesting I conspired with Death Eaters to have them killed? Are you that paranoid, old man?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Too crazy for his own good, I say!” shouted Sirius, rising to defend his friend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t be as good an Auror as I am if I wasn’t paranoid!” Alastor said, standing up from his chair so quickly that it fell over with a loud crash.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Enough!” shouted Dumbledore. “There are few people I trust more than James Potter, and he and I will have a private discussion regarding exactly where he was.  But suffice it to say it was a good thing he wasn’t there, as we would be burying three bodies tonight instead of two.” Dumbledore sat back in his seat, looking like a tired old man.  “Alas, I fear this was my mistake. I have long suspected an enemy within our midst and tonight has indeed confirmed it. It was no accident Death Eaters ambushed the Prewett brothers.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Moody sat down but continued to glare at James, his magical eye jerking wildly while the other one fixed on James.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At that moment there was a loud bang and Molly Weasley stormed into the dining room. Her red hair was frazzled and her eyes were puffy and read.  Behind her followed Arthur Weasley, his shoulders slumped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Molly surveyed the occupants in the room.   She glared at Sirius, who feigned interest in the scenery beyond the window and avoided her eyes.  Finally her eyes found their target.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You,” she said low and in James’ direction. “You killed them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Molly,” James began, “I’m sorry-“</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You abandoned them, didn’t you?” She pushed her way passed Frank and Alice, who had placed themselves in the middle of the room as a barrier. Molly stood right in front of James and pointed her finger in his face, mere centimeters from his nose. “You let them die all because of some stupid feud. My brothers, my brave brothers are dead and it’s your fault.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My fault?” James said, a hot flush coming over him at her accusations. “I am sorry for your loss, Weasley, but this was not on me.  Yes, I was wrong to not go. But if I was there, my wife would be where you are right now and I will never feel bad for not putting her in that position,” he said, thinking of the news Lily had given him that very night.  “We all knew what we were signing up for when we joined. Or at least those who made that choice did.” He stared pointedly between Molly and Arthur. “Which reminds me. How did you two even get here? Order members only.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Arthur and Dumbledore shared a glance before turning back to the confrontation in front of them. “James, don’t say anything you might regret later here,” Dumbledore said calmly. “We have all suffered a tremendous loss tonight and are apt to say unkind things to each other in the heat of the moment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, Albus,” said Molly. “I will never regret my words.  You were always an arrogant boy at school, but now I see you for what you truly are: as dark as any Death Eater.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Molly!” Arthur shouted, but the words were out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ice ran through James’s veins and an odd sort of calm settled on him.  “Is that what you believe, Weasley? I’m a monster?” he asked, voice soft in the hush of the room.  “Or are you just angry I didn’t die in their place?” He raised his eyebrows, glancing over to Sirius.  “It’s funny that you compare me to a Death Eater when I’m the one actually fighting them while you and your husband play house.  You want to blame me? Fine. Do what you must. But don’t ever compare me to those scum when you refuse to fight yourselves.” He paused for a moment, satisfaction running through him as Molly’s face reddened.  She opened her mouth to speak, but James interrupted her. “Maybe your brothers would’ve been alive if you or Arthur had the guts to stand up to Voldemort. In fact, it would’ve been better if you both went on that mission instead of Gideon and Fabian. At least they were of use to the cause.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Molly burst into tears and Arthur stood rooted to the spot in indignation at James’ comments. They were unfair, James knew, but his anger and temper blinded him, as it often did. Because this was not his fault and he had a good reason for being absent.  Ironically, it would be Molly who would probably understand the most. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Molly composed herself long enough to stop the tears from cascading down her face.  She squeezed Arthur’s forearm and turned to Dumbledore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Albus, for recovering their bodies. I’ll be sure to let the Order know when the funeral will be held.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anything you need, just ask and it shall be done.” With one last glare at James, Molly departed.  Arthur made to leave before stopping and facing James.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Molly would never admit this, but Fabian always liked you. He would often say that in another life, the two of you could’ve been good friends,” Arthur said, his simple words an arrow to James’s heart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Arthur walked to the fireplace and grabbed some floo powder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Arthur!” James called.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James was about to speak when the words caught in his throat. “Nevermind,” he said instead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Arthur departed.  Alice resumed her crying and Mary and Frank ushered her out of the kitchen.  Soon the room was empty save Sirius, Dumbledore, James and Moody.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You wanted to speak in private, Professor?” James asked, though he could not meet Dumbledore’s blue eyes.  Even with Dumbledore seated at the head of the table, he still loomed large over everyone in the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Given what has occurred, I think perhaps we can put off that discussion for another night.  I know you have guilt over tonight’s events, James. And that is normal, though I assure you this was not your fault. Go home.  Be with your family. Give Lily my best and say hello to Madam Pomfrey for me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James’ head jerked up and Dumbledore smiled in a manner reminiscent of James’ days at Hogwarts.  With that, James headed towards the fireplace. Sirius took that as his cue and retired to his bedroom, leaving Dumbledore and Moody.  James gave a tentative wave and vanished in the flames.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>____________________________________________________________________________________-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Today I find myself feeling my age more than ever,” Dumbledore said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“War does that to us,” replied Moody.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I fear I may have been mistaken in my approach thus far, old friend.  This war is starting to tear us apart. The Prewett brothers’ deaths will certainly not be the last, and I fear what world we will have left even if we are victorious.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Potters and Weasleys were at each other’s throats before Voldemort started causing a fuss, Albus.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But what I saw tonight was so unlike both Molly and James. This is what I truly fear.” Dumbledore gave a heavy sigh.  “Alastor, what if I told you I knew of a way to defeat Voldemort? A way to remove his power and end this war?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d ask why you were holding out on us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Until now it was only the eccentricities of an old man, but I fear I must trust my instincts, even if they ultimately steer me wrong.  Voldemort must be defeated and I must be the one to do it. But I will need your help confirming my suspicions.” Dumbledore waved his wand and the doors to the dining room slammed shut. “Now, tell me what you know about Horcruxes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>_____________________________________________________________________________________</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James emerged from the fireplace at the Potters’ cottage and dusted soot from his robes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily was resting comfortably in bed when James entered. He tried not to wake her but his heavy boots betrayed him as she stirred.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Meeting go ok?” she asked, rubbing her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh, yeah, fine,” James replied, sitting on the edge of the bed to take off his boots. Lily began rubbing his back in a circular motion, the same way she did when James was worried about an exam.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What happened?” Something go wrong?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to worry you, not now anyway.  Madam Pomfrey settled into the guest room ok. She was a lifesaver tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tell me,” Lily demanded. “I won’t break.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James gave a heavy sigh. “Gideon and Fabian were killed tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily’s breath hitched and James was at her side in moments.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What happened?” she asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They were ambushed by Death Eaters.  Terrible. Everyone was devastated,” James said before looking away from Lily.  He took a deep breath before continuing. “Moody thought I might have been in on it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily’s hand flew to her mouth. “How could he think such a thing? How could anyone think that of you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Molly Weasley seemed to agree in her own way.  She sort of ambushed me tonight and basically blamed me for their deaths.  And I think she is right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily grabbed James’ chin firmly. “This was not your fault.  You do this, you know. Blame yourself when things go wrong.  Remember when Lupin nearly killed Severus? You blamed yourself for weeks over it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But this was partly my fault, Lily.  I missed the mission.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, and maybe there was a chance being there could’ve saved them.  But there probably was a better chance you’d be dead along with them, and the Order would be that much worse off.  </span>
  <em>
    <span>We’d</span>
  </em>
  <span> be so much worse off.  I’m tremendously grateful you missed the mission.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James brought her into his arms and hugged her fiercely. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve never seen someone so mad as Molly Weasley,” he said, releasing her slightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t blame her,” Lily said. “She must be suffering so much.” James let Lily go and began pacing the bedroom, running his hands through his hair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I may have made it worse. She was saying some truly awful things about me.  Saying I was no better than a Death Eater. You know me and my temper. I just lost it.  Said it was her fault since she chose not to join the Order.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, James.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not my best moment. I admit. But she’s a Weasley and you know how we get on.  I’m sorry I said it, but I meant a lot of it, Lily. The Weasleys are not fighting this war with us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They have good reasons not to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bollocks! So do we! Yet we fight!” James was practically pulling at his hair now, and Lily grabbed his hands and brought them to her face. He stroked her cheeks gingerly with his thumbs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re being a bit of a hypocrite, James.” James scoffed at the notion but continued his ministrations.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know you’ve tried to mend the fences with them and I never held that against you, Lily.  I get it. You weren’t born into this feud. But face facts, love. After tonight, the Potters and Weasleys will never be friends.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A sudden wail interrupted them and they looked to the side of the bed. James walked over and stared lovingly into the basket near the nightstand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s beautiful, isn’t he?” James asked, tears in his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just like his Dad.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James bent down and picked up the newborn, delicately cradling it in his arms. Lily rose from the bed and joined him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know there has been a lot of sadness today,” James began “but I can’t help but feel incredibly happy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re a family.” Lily beamed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The newborn grabbed at James’ finger and he smiled even wider. “Welcome to the world, Simon Potter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
