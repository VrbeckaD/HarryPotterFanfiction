    <p>Alec Lightwood had hoped his first official trip across the pond would include more sightseeing than a train ride to Scotland. He’d secretly wanted to treat Maia to tickets to the Shakespeare Globe. He always wanted to be a Groundling. Perhaps afterwards, Jace would have dragged them all to a pub, and they’d get sick on chips and beer. Maybe Izzy would convince them to take the Chunnel to Paris and go shopping. Alec would have begrudgingly admitted that there might be a French version of Doc Martens that Izzy could convince him to purchase. </p><p>Alec daydreamt that they’d go to a Quidditch match, perhaps see the Irish team. Izzy would complain that Quodpot was the better sport, and Maia would read a textbook while sipping her butterbeer and occasionally chime in. Jace would, of course, provide play-by-play commentary to anyone listening, boasting that their team’s skills surpassed whoever was playing. Alec would time himself on how long it would take him to spot the Snitch. It would be the vacation they all deserved and never received.</p><p>He supposes he should be lucky he escaped the States at all for a short time, even if he’s on babysitting duty. The international portkey to King’s Cross Station and the boarding of the Hogwarts Express took no more than an hour, but Alec could feel the muscles in his shoulders ease as they traveled further away from the stern glares of his parents.</p><p>Robert and Maryse Lightwood were distinguished board members of Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, former students in Thunderbird House, and former sympathizers of the Circle, the American contingent of the Death Eaters. Their reputations hung over the Lightwood siblings, even Jace, like shrouds, but the Circle was small potatoes in the UK and in the rest of the Wizarding World. Alec supposed it was similar to the German-American Bund in the ’30s. Everyone likes to forget the stain on a country’s history when the overwhelming majority sided with the Light.</p><p>“Do you know that, at the last tournament, Beauxbatons arrived in a flying carriage?” Maia asks as she nudges Alec with her left foot and interrupts his musings. He turns from gazing at the green rolling hills to look at his best friend.</p><p>Alec smirks and nods slightly. “I’m sure the press will be sorely disappointed at the nature of our arrivals.”</p><p>Alec met Maia in their first year, right before the Sorting ceremony. Alec had been alone, unused to being without his younger siblings and a noticeable Lightwood in appearance, and Maia had grabbed his arm and announced their friendship as fact. They were the same height, back then, and she had some muscle on him. They’d promised that their friendship would prevail even if they were sorted into different houses, and it did. They’d laughed at the Howler Alec received a few days later, even though Alec had cried himself to sleep that night, and they’d continue to huddle together even after the rest of the Lightwood family arrived at Ilvermorny.</p><p>Maia finally shuts her copy of <em>Hogwarts: A History</em> and crosses her ankles resting on Alec’s knee. “The less pomp and circumstance, the better.”</p><p>Alec silently agreed. He wasn’t going to Hogwarts to make a name for himself. Despite having been chosen as one of five Ilvermorny students to attend Hogwarts for the Tri-Wizard Tournament, Alec knew that his selection had more to do with board pressure from his parents and a not so veiled attempt to represent all four school houses. No one expected Alec to become the Ilvermorny champion. Even Maia thought it was a done deal, since the almighty Jonathan Herondale was attending.</p><p>No, to his parents, Alec was on sibling duty. He’d manage the press for Jace and make sure Izzy didn’t get into too much trouble. Well, he’d make sure they both didn’t get into too much trouble. Alec was the older Lightwood, the responsible child. He was also the invisible one.</p><p>His sister was snoring softly on his shoulder, a moment of respite that Alec feared would soon end. Isabelle and he looked shockingly similar, although Izzy was the one admired by all of the boys. Inked skin poked out from beneath her robes, and while the swirling black lines added to her appeal, Alec’s ink made people fearful. His parents’ disproval at his first tattoo only propelled Isabelle and Jace to ink their bodies in solidarity.</p><p>That solidarity was partly why Alec had opted to follow his parents’ orders and join his siblings abroad. In fact, Alec hadn’t wanted Maia to be alone every month, not that anyone else would know or care. That was a secret between them alone. It was a miracle that Hogwarts could accommodate her, and he’d made it his mission as her best friend to make it all the more bearable. He and Maia could probably have skipped seventh year altogether, with all of their advanced coursework, but Alec knew Maia saw the Tri-Wizard Tournament as her ticket to financial stability. The prejudice against Magical Creatures hindered her far more than the disdain towards his parents’ histories affected him.</p><p>Still frazzled from portkey travel, Alec couldn’t seem to quiet his mind enough to sleep. Like the rest of the compartment’s inhabitants, Maia soon drifted off, and Alec watched over his friends and family, huddled together on the Hogwarts Express. Jace had his head tilted back with his mouth wide open and his legs stretched out, eerily reminding Alec of trips to the dentist Maia had explained to him. </p><p>Like Alec, Jace neglected to wear his uniform, hoping to delay changing to his blue and red robes until the last minute. Alec always preferred Muggle clothing, wearing almost exclusively black. He currently wore his fuzziest black sweater, holey sleeves rolled up, exposing his inked forearms. Jace always preferred anything with his Quidditch insignia and wore his standard leather jacket with the eagle badge. <em>Gotta promote the brand, bro</em>, Jace would say.</p><p>Their last companion, Aline Penhallow, was curled up, her arms around her knees. Like Alec, Aline was a political choice. Aline’s mother was a prominent board member, and Aline was the sole representative of her house. <em>We’re the diversity picks</em>, Alec thinks sullenly. Alec had thought she was a great choice regardless, having seen her outperform many in dueling club, but since this year’s rules reduced the number from thirty to five, students were catty and petty. It was better for Alec that everyone think he was there to support Jace and even Isabelle rather than for others to consider him as a separate candidate.</p><p>Indeed, it was a sign of good faith that the tournament was happening at all. Hogwarts, Alec thinks, wanted to do some rebranding of its own. With You-Know-Who defeated (for now, Alec thinks cynically), the Wizarding World could use a celebration of international cooperation and camaraderie. Headmistress Herondale eagerly accepted Hogwarts’ invitation, since it was rare that Ilvermorny was invited, and the headmistress would use any opportunity to promote her grandson and her school. Alec assumed that Durmstrang was equally eager to shirk its reputation as a school promoting the Dark Arts.</p><p>Nevertheless, staunch security measures were proposed and ultimately accepted, including the promotion of Ilvermorny and Durmstrang faculty at Hogwarts as well as a less ostentatious arrival of the foreign students. Alec hadn’t wandered through the train, but he wouldn’t be surprised if the Durmstrang students weren’t crammed into a compartment somewhere too.</p><p>A flurry of red hair enters Alec’s vision, and he nudges his siblings and his friends awake. He quirks his lips up, hoping to come across as sleepy rather than creepy. The teenager looks like he’s Alec’s age, although Alec thinks he’s probably as cool and as popular as Jace is. The boy’s hair is on the shaggy side, and Alec thinks he spots an earring on one side. He’s wearing what Alec assumes are Hogwarts robes, black with a hint of red. He has a red badge for what Alec thinks must be his house, and another badge with the words “Head Boy,” whatever that means.</p><p>He moves to the side, and a fair-haired girl appears to his right. Her uniform matches, except where there was red there is blue, and her badge, for obvious reasons, says “Head Girl.” Her smile is more subdued, less toothy.</p><p>“Hi guys,” the boy says as he waves unnecessarily. “We finally found you. Just wanted to give you a welcome before the madness all began,” he winks. “I’m Bill Weasley. I’m in my last year and am in Gryffindor, if you know what that means.”</p><p>Isabelle smiles in a way Alec can only describe as wicked. “Not sure what that means, but I can make a few guesses,” she winks and extends her right hand. “I’m Isabelle. Sixth year Ilvermorny student in Thunderbird, if you know what that means.”</p><p>Alec sees Aline rolling her eyes and hides a smile. He knew how she felt. Hell, he probably felt worse during first year. Everyone wants to be in Thunderbird.</p><p>“I’m Aline, seventh year, Wampus, which I’ve heard is like Gryffindor,” Aline pipes up. </p><p>“Anyone in Horned Serpent?” the blonde girl asks. “I’m Lydia, also a seventh year student, and I’m in Ravenclaw, which is probably closest to the Horned Serpent in meaning, from what I’ve read.”</p><p>Maia grins and waves her hand. “That would be me,” she says cheerfully. “I was just reading about Ravenclaw in <em>Hogwarts: A History</em>, and it sounds the most similar and, of course, the best. I’m Maia Roberts, seventh year. Pleased to meet you guys.”</p><p>“I’ll be happy to show you around the library, once you’re settled,” Lydia says quietly, almost apprehensively. Maia’s grin widens. “Alec and I would love that,” she says conspiratorially. Maia pokes Alec shoulder enthusiastically, and he stifles a groan.</p><p>“This is Alec,” Maia says after a beat, as if waiting for him to introduce himself but knowing his resistance towards strangers. </p><p>He lifts one hand and waves awkwardly. “Hi, nice to meet you,” he says softly.</p><p>“Are you also in Horned Serpent?” Lydia asks.</p><p>He lifts his left hand and points to his wrist, proudly showing off his first tattoo. An intricate drawing of an arrow curled around his wrist like a bracelet. “No,” Alec says with a sigh, bracing himself for the response, “I’m in Pukwudgie.”</p><p>“When you’re selected into Pukwudgie, the statue raises its arrow into the air,” Maia adds helpfully.</p><p>Bill grins. “Cool, man,” he says. Alec relaxes. They clearly don’t know the prejudice against Pukwudgies as the school’s “nursemaids,” and Alec doesn’t plan on sharing that. </p><p>“Mum would skin me alive if I ever got any ink.” Bill looks between Izzy and Alec. “Are you related?”</p><p>Jace laughs loudly, as if anyone would even question for a moment that Izzy and Alec were not siblings. Alec knows better, realizes that Jace is a little jealous, even though he loves his own golden appearance. “We’re all siblings,” Jace says with a grin before pointing to himself. “Adopted, of course. I’m Jace Herondale, sixth year superstar, Thunderbird member.” He points to the eagle on his jacket. “You may know me from the last World Cup.” He crosses his arms over his chest, as if waiting for the familiar uprising of fan love.</p><p>Bill’s eyes bug out. “Hold on!” He runs down the traincar hallway. Lydia shrugs and points lazily on the direction Bill went. “He’s probably getting one of his brothers,” she says. She looks back at Jace and at Alec. “You’ll probably want to change in about a half hour. It was nice to meet you all, and I’ll see you again at the Welcoming Feast,” she says before walking off in the opposite direction.</p><p>Before anyone can comment, Bill races back with a similar-looking red head. His brother, Alec assumes, has slightly shorter hair and no earring yet.</p><p>“I figure we beat the crowds, perks of being Head Boy,” Bill quips. “Guys, this is my brother Charlie. He’s a sixth year prefect in Gryffindor. He’s also the seeker of our house team, and he’s a big Quidditch fan.” He nods in Jace’s direction. “Charlie, that’s Jace Herondale.”</p><p>Charlie, Alec thinks, seems to have a little more tact than his older brother and addresses the whole compartment. “Hi guys, welcome to Hogwarts,” he says. “The papers have been keeping it all very hush hush, but I heard about the Tournament from Bill, and we’re psyched that you’re here.” Alec can’t help but smile. He supposes it must be a seeker thing.</p><p>Jace looks a little disappointed, but his grin remains. Charlie continues, “We’re also big fans of Quidditch and are hoping to go to a World Cup one day. I heard you were spectacular, mate.”</p><p>Jace tips his head in what Alec thinks is affected bashfulness. “Thanks, man,” he says. “I didn’t know we had fans over here.” Izzy snorts and then poorly attempts to conceal it with a scoff. Alec and Maia look at each other and roll their eyes.</p><p>“Actually,” Charlie scratches the back of his neck with one hand, “I was kind of hoping to meet Gideon Light. I have a poster of him doing a Wronski Feint from the last World Cup.” He looks around, as if puzzled. “I thought he was around our age. Is he coming as well?” </p><p>Izzy and Maia burst out laughing as Jace crosses his arms over his chest in an uncharacteristic sulk. Even Alec purses his lips in an attempt to stifle a giggle. Aline, Charlie, and Bill, of course, remain confused and out of the know.</p><p>After a minute, Alec decides to let Jace out of his misery. “I’m sure Jace could arrange an autograph or something from him, if you wanted,” Alec says once the laughter died down.</p><p>“Thanks,” Charlie says quietly. Alec immediately gets up, stretches his arms over his head, and then grabs his suitcase to find his wardrobe. “Jace, we better get dressed,” he calls out. He looks back at the Weasley brothers. “We’ll see you again soon, yeah?”</p><p>“Of course,” Bill says authoritatively, “As Head Boy, consider me a resource for any of your Hogwarts needs.” He nudges Charlie, and the two boys finally leave.</p><p>“Well, well, well,” Izzy says after a minute of silence. “We’ll have quite the selection here.”</p><p>“Lydia wasn’t bad looking,” Aline agrees.</p><p>“I was thinking of calling dibs,” Maia pipes up, to Alec’s surprise. “She had an Alec vibe, without the whole ‘get away from me you’re of the female species’ component.”</p><p>Alec blushes as his friends and family laugh, although he’s secretly pleased that Aline didn’t ask about the whole Quidditch conversation. He’s also a bit thrilled, he admits to himself, that his sexuality can be discussed so flippantly and so openly.</p><p>That was his main reason for coming, really. He wanted to be more than just “out.” He wanted to be, as he heard Muggles say, “out and proud.” After he agreed to chaperone Jace and Izzy at Hogwarts, he realized that nothing was holding him back from telling his parents. So on one summer day, when Jace and Izzy had gone out, Alec had sat his parents down and told them. He said that he was the same man they always knew, but that he knew in his heart that one day, he would find a husband and not a wife.</p><p>At the time, his parents had been rather subdued about the whole affair. Alec knew they didn’t approve but weren’t the type to yell. He knew they supported anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in the MACUSA, just as they supported harsh Magical Creature laws that Alec despised. He knew all this, but he was tired of hiding.</p><p>It wasn’t wholly unexpected then, that before the Lightwood siblings, besides Max, lined up for the portkey, his parents took him aside one last time, away from the prying ears of his younger siblings. Robert told him, calmly, quietly, and publicly, that after Alec’s year at Hogwarts, he would not be welcome in their home. He could write to his siblings, yes, and they would accept his owls, but he was recommended to pursue work outside the United States for the foreseeable future. Maryse added that it was also Alec’s responsibility to let Jonathan and Isabelle know that he would not be joining them for the Christmas holidays. Alec had nodded, and off he went.</p><p>So Alec, understandably, was tired of ruffling any feathers. Figuratively, not literally, he thinks wryly. No, Alexander Lightwood would spend as much time as he could with his family and his best friend, support them in their bids for the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and figure out a career path before the year ended. If he was lucky, Alec thought wistfully as he grabbed his blue uniform to change into, he’d go on a couple dates.</p><p>He’d have to be really lucky.</p>
