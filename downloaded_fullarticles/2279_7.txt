None of the other kids really wanted to be around him they knew who he was the son of a death eater even a few members of the staff dreaded being around him. He looked to his small little self with a few books that he had collected over the years and that he had read countless times he rised from his bed to pick one up before he could there was a knock at the door <br/>Come in - stephen</p>
<p>The door opens and a tall thin man with long black hair entered the room</p>

<p>Stephen stood up and put on his blazer and made his way toward the door </p>
<p>" okay then lets not waste time " -stephen </p>
<p>After a few hours of shopping in diagon alley professor snape decided to treat stephen to a meal before dropping him off back at the orphanage. They ate their meal mostly in silence it was stephen who broke it </p>

<p>"Well i didn'tknow your mother very well but she was a kind women she was in hufflepuff when we whent to school" - snape </p>
<p>Stephen took in Snape's words he felt a tugg at his heart no one ever talked about his mother though he offtened wondered about her </p>
<p>"And my father?" - stephen </p>
<p>"Look here Mr.lestrange your father did do a great deal for bad things and was a death eater....but you and your mother were his life he loved you both very much try and remeber that " -snape trying to reassure him </p>
