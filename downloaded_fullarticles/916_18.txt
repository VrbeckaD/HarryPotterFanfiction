  <strong>Chapter 1: Head Boy</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Evans,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I heard from Macdonald that you’re Head Girl. Obviously it was going to be you, so I’m not surprised. I haven’t gotten a letter yet, but everyone said it would be me. Your letter says who the Head Boy is, right? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I heard from someone that’s mates with Remus Lupin that it’s James Potter, but I don’t believe it. There’s no way Dumbledore would make him Head Boy. He’s a prick who never met an opportunity to take his shirt off that he didn’t take, that hardly qualifies him for the most important student position at school. What a joke. So who is it actually?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lewis Collins</em>
</p><p align="center">x.x.x.x.x</p><p>
  <em>Potter,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Congratulations on making Head Boy! I'm not entirely surprised, but it's still hilarious. I'll spare you the jokes though, I'm sure Black has already used them all. And anyways, I'm glad it's you and not Lewis Collins like everyone was expecting. I appreciate a good Welsh accent as much as the next girl, but he's a prick.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I think it would be a good idea for us to meet before school starts. I'd like to get an idea of how we want to do things and sort out some start of school items so we're prepared when we meet with Dumbledore in September. We'll make a good impression, and it'll take the pressure off for the first couple of weeks. That way we can settle in and take it easy before classes pick up.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I'm doing my school shopping this coming weekend. If you can make it to Diagon Alley then, that would be ideal, but let me know what works for you.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Congratulations again! </em>
</p><p>

  <em>Evans,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Thank you! Congratulations to you too, I'm entirely unsurprised. You were the only correct choice and I'm glad. Sirius hasn't stopped sulking long enough to crack any jokes, but thank you for sparing me all the same.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Meeting ahead of school is a great idea. I should have realized you would want to get a head start and beat you to it. Ah well, I'll get it next time.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I'll see you at the Cauldron on Saturday at noon? We'll talk over lunch.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>James</em>
</p><p align="center">x.x.x.x.x</p><p>
  <em>Potter,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Saturday at noon is perfect. See you then.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lily Evans</em>
</p><p align="center">x.x.x.x.x</p><p>On Saturday, I walk into The Leaky Cauldron at noon and beeline for the only empty table I see. Some students have already started their Hogwarts shopping, and the Cauldron is never not busy at lunch anyways, so there’s quite a rush of people. Still, I manage to snag a good spot away from the noisy bar by sliding into the table just as the previous occupants leave it.</p><p>I don’t mind the crowd. The hustle and bustle of Diagon Alley is comforting and familiar and it fills me with excitement. It reminds me how close September is. After spending the summer with Petunia, my dreadful bore of a sister, that’s a welcome reminder.</p><p>Generally, I like to arrive a few minutes early to things, because I hate being late and like to give myself extra time to avoid it. But I figure Potter is going to be late because he's always late to class, so I’m safe just being on time.</p><p>To my surprise though, I’ve hardly sat down before I see him walk in too. He comes in from the Diagon Alley side, so I guess he must have already been here. When he spots me, he gives me a friendly smile and a little wave as he starts to make his way over.</p><p>If I’m being totally honest, I was nervous at the prospect of James Potter being Head Boy. He’s loud and rowdy and seems far more interested in disrupting the peace with his mates than he is in making it. He and Sirius Black probably have more detentions between them than everyone else in the rest of our year combined. If ever there was a party, Potter was at the center of it. Back in the day, the same could be said for a fight. When we were younger, I remember him being a complete prat, hexing students for the fun of it, and always ready to show off what a talented duelist he thought he was.</p><p>I think that was probably everyone’s initial reaction to the news, but I’ve thought a lot about it, and I think I can see why Dumbledore picked him. In fact, I actually think it makes a lot of sense, and the more I think about it, the more I realize he was really the <em>only </em>option.</p><p>Potter was never a prefect, which I think is what probably threw everyone off. But he is the Gryffindor quidditch captain, and that comes with a lot of responsibility that he’s handled really well so far. And in fairness, he has cleaned up his act quite a lot since we were fifteen, which I can appreciate. Last year he’d mostly just minded his own business. He still caused some scenes with his mates, but that had been in good fun and not because of a fight.</p><p>Potter still thinks himself a rare talent in all things and is infuriatingly arrogant – that's probably why he feels like it’s alright for him to sweep into class late all the time, his hair a mess and his tie crooked. He thinks he knows everything already. But regardless of his lack of respect for time, he’s also always done really well in classes. Last year he was top of our class in Transfiguration and Defence, and fourth overall – it’s actually kind of annoying, how he gets to be athletic and rowdy <em>and</em> smart. But being annoying is not reason enough to not be Head Boy. And anyways, he’s far less annoying than that prat, Lewis Collins.</p><p>The biggest thing, which I think Dumbledore knows, is that if I could pick any one boy who all of Hogwarts might actually listen to, it's Potter. Just about everyone at school loves him, or at the very least, grudgingly respects him. I’m not sure I have the same hold on the Hogwarts population that he does (actually, I definitely don’t, because no one does), and even if it is for all the wrong reasons, I’m sure that will be helpful. </p><p>So really, it shouldn't have come as a surprise to anyone that he'd gotten the badge. Potter always gets everything without even trying. But whether he tried or not, he deserves this.</p><p>Still, at first I'd been worried about how seriously he would actually take being Head Boy, but he'd responded to my letter really quickly and hadn't been snide about me wanting to meet early. And now he's shown up right on time, so some of my apprehension is already beginning to slip away. </p><p>Potter takes the seat across from me. "Alright, Evans?" </p><p>I have to fight the urge to roll my eyes at the old greeting. He used to run his hand through his hair and smirk as he said it, like he'd dropped the most enticing pickup line of all time. Now it's just habit though, so I only smile politely, and say, "Hey."</p><p>"How's your summer going?" Potter asks jovially. Potter doesn’t care who he’s talking to. He just loves to talk.</p><p>Besides what I’ve heard about him (which I take with a grain of salt because Hogwarts is full of drama loving gossips), I don’t know much about James Potter. We got off on the wrong foot when we first met, he’d been rude to me and my (then) best friend Severus on the train to Hogwarts. But we’d gotten past that fairly quickly, and hadn’t spoken much since. We never exactly had the same interests or many of the same friends.</p><p>The most I’ve ever interacted with him was in fifth year, when for a couple of months he developed an irritating crush on me. That ended with a row with Severus and then disappeared entirely the following year. Potter apologized to me before we boarded the train home that summer, I said it was fine because he wasn’t the part of the fight that had really hurt me anyways, and since then I’d say my relationship with him has been… well, nonexistent, really. Polite, because we're housemates in the same year. But that's about all we have in common.</p><p>Which I guess is why I have no idea how to talk to him now. Maybe I should have thought of some things to talk about. I’ve only thought about the head students stuff.</p><p>"Not too bad,” I say. I don’t go into any detail because it’s obviously only polite conversation. “How's yours?"</p><p>"Brilliant.” Potter grins. “I spent most of it in Greece, I only just got back last week."</p><p>Of course Potter would spend his summer in Greece. Why wouldn't he? That's exactly the type of casually envy-inducing thing he would do. He looks it, too. He has a nice warm tan, and it suits him. Somehow makes his shock of unruly black hair and hazel eyes look so much nicer.</p><p>Not that they don't always look nice. He always looks nice. Like I’m not enamoured with him like so many of the girls at school are, but... well, I’m also not blind. Potter is well fit. Back in fifth year when he'd fancied me, I'd thought him an annoying prat, but I still noticed some girls giving me envious looks whenever he tried to talk to me, and… okay, I’d never admit it out loud, but some small part of my fifteen year old self might have liked that. As immature as it is, who doesn’t like getting attention from someone whose attention everyone else craves?</p><p>He'd gotten tall and his face had lost most of its boyish softness that year, but it wasn't until last year, when the rest of him had bulked out a little to catch up with his height, that I'd really noticed how attractive he actually is. Now he's tall and lean instead of tall and a bit scrawny, his muscles more defined and toned. And he’s always had a nice face, but his features fit so much better on it now that it’s all angles and sharp jawline.</p><p>Okay, so I think he's attractive, objectively speaking – but I haven’t ever, and I never will fancy him. It’s just something that you can’t not notice when you’re sitting across from Potter. It makes him a little bit hard to talk to.  </p><p>"That sounds nice." I lick my lips and shift a little in my seat. I wish I knew Potter a little bit better, so this wouldn't feel so awkward. I know him in the way you might know anyone you've been to school with for six years, but I don’t know him in any way that tells me what to talk to him about. "So, should we just get started then?"</p><p>Potter's eyebrows shoot up and he laughs. "Oh come on, Evans."</p><p>I frown at him. "What?"</p><p>"Let's just get some food first at least, yeah? I'm sure you want to get right down to business, but I actually think it might be nice to get to know each other a little? We will have to spend the year working together, after all."</p><p>"I guess," I say, with a little shrug. I want to say that I’d thought so too, I just wasn't sure what to say. Potter never seems to have that problem. When you talk as much as he does all the time, it probably starts to come with ease.</p><p>"So my mum's Greek," he says conversationally, waving over Genevieve Wallace, a friendly middle aged woman who has worked at the Cauldron for as long as I’ve come here. "I haven’t visited Santorini in a few years, so she thought we should go this year. It’s where she grew up.”</p><p>I smile genuinely, because it’s a surprisingly sweet little detail to share, and say, “I’ve always wanted to go there.”</p><p>“It’s so beautiful,” he says, just as Genevieve reaches us. Potter turns his smile and his attention to her. “Genie!”</p><p>“Hi darling,” she says, returning his smile with a warm one of her own. “Where have you been off to all summer?”</p><p>“Greece with mama,” he tells her, like they’re old friends. <em>James Potter calls his mother mama. </em>I add that little detail to the short list of things I know about him in my brain.</p><p>“Well, I’m glad to have you back.”</p><p>“I bet.” He grins. “Has anyone told you how good summer looks on you?”</p><p>Genie laughs. “Hush, you.” She gives me a look, like we’re sharing an inside joke. “He thinks he can flirt his way to free drinks every time he’s here.”</p><p>I shake my head, like I’m in on it. “Sounds like Potter.”</p><p>It always takes a bit of time to adjust to being around James Potter. A few minutes in I’ll get used to how effortless his existence is, how everyone around him seems automatically drawn to him. Right now, it’s still throwing me. I’m thinking, what must it be like to go through the world being him?</p><p>“I don’t <em>think</em> I can. I do it all the time.” Genevieve rolls her eyes, and Potter innocently adds, “But I won’t try anything today, I swear.”</p><p>“Oh?” Genevieve raises her eyebrows.</p><p>“Yeah. See, Evans and I are here to work. She’s Head Girl this year, to absolutely no one’s surprise, because she’s brilliant. And I’ve somehow landed Head Boy.”</p><p>“Oh!” Genevieve gasps, clutching her heart in excitement and looking down at both of us like a proud mother. “Congratulations! Well earned, both of you. I think this warrants some celebratory drinks, on the house!”</p><p>Potter gives me a secret smile. To Genevieve, he says, “If you insist.”</p><p align="center">x.x.x.x.x</p><p>Two hours later, I’ve finished off my tomato soup and am snacking on my last piece of bread. We’re on our third round of free drinks and have gotten quite a lot done besides.</p><p>I’ve told Potter about the system I came up with for assigning rounds and tutoring shifts to the prefects, so we can avoid the commotion it always causes. He said he trusts my expert opinion on that, since I’ve been a prefect for two years. We scheduled and planned out the first few prefects meetings and prepared for our meeting with Dumbledore. I ran several general ideas by him, all of which he had surprisingly thoughtful feedback on.</p><p>In between, I’ve told him about the cat that had kittens in my backyard and my summer internship at the Daily Prophet. He’s told me about how he might like to live on a Greek island when he’s old and out of energy (which I don’t think will ever happen), because life there seems so idyllic and relaxing.</p><p>And then he surprised me even more by suggesting ideas of his own. I expected to be the only one talking, or at least the one leading the conversation. But Potter had started telling me about how, in light of all the “dark shit” going on, we ought to have some more events at school to keep the students happy and distracted and encourage unity.</p><p>I’d been thinking the same thing, so now we’ve got a good list of ideas brainstormed. It all needs more fleshing out of course, but we have some vague plans. It’s solid enough to bring to Dumbledore.</p><p>“I’ll write to all of them tonight when I get home to see who’s interested,” Potter’s saying now, his eyes running over the list of names he’d come up with for a potential networking event. “I’ll let you know what they say when they get back to me.”</p><p>“That’s perfect, thank you! Dumbledore is going to be so much more open to this if we can tell him there’s people interested in doing it.”</p><p>I’m so pleasantly surprised at how the meeting’s gone. Potter is polite, he’s interested, he’s involved and participating. I’m glad I decided to do this, because it takes so much of the nerves and pressure off. I would have spent the last few weeks of summer stressing about having to work with someone I don’t know and wondering whether he’d even give a shit at all.</p><p>I feel a little bad for having expected Potter to be irresponsible about this. I thought, if he even agreed to it, he’d grumble and complain through the whole meeting and tell me I’m taking it too seriously or something. My own friends often think I take things too seriously, which I find fucking annoying, actually. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with caring about things.</p><p>“So, do you think that’s enough to take us into September?” he asks.</p><p>“More than,” I say. “Thanks for meeting me early, I know it’s still summer and you probably have plans.”</p><p>Potter shakes his head. “No, it was honestly a good idea. This is a bunch of shit we don’t have to worry about at school now. Plus, you know.” Potter pauses for a moment, and he looks a little unsure – a strange look on him. He clears his throat uncomfortably. “I wanted you to know I actually do take this seriously. Despite what you might think.”</p><p>I feel a little ashamed at having thought exactly what he thinks I thought, but he doesn’t have to know it.</p><p>“What I think is that Dumbledore made a good choice,” I assure him. I’ve never seen him look uncomfortable or unsure, and it strikes me that this might be the first time everyone has doubted him. That he might be here to make a point. I know everyone doubts him, because all the friends I’ve talked to have laughed when I told them, which I realize now was unfair and actually quite mean.</p><p>He raises an eyebrow at me. “Really?” This is one thing that I do know about Potter. Despite his inherent confidence, he does love positive feedback.</p><p>“Yeah. I think it makes a lot of sense.” I leave it there, because he doesn’t need his ego stroked by me.</p><p>Potter beams at me. “Thank you! That means something coming from you.”</p><p>I’m not sure if that’s his usual flattery, I think Potter might talk to everyone like they’re the most important person in the world, but I like hearing it anyways. It means something coming from <em>me.</em></p><p>“I think we’re gonna make a good team, Evans.” He leans in, a conspiratorial glint in his eyes. “Between you and me, I really think we’re the best ones.”</p><p>I take the final sip of my butterbeer. “The best what?”</p><p>“The best two people at Hogwarts,” he says, like it’s obvious.</p><p>I snort in amusement. “You’re ridiculous.”</p><p>“And right,” he insists. “You don’t have to be modest in front of me, we’re pals now.”</p><p>“Maybe you should try a little bit of modesty,” I suggest. “It might make you more tolerable.”</p><p>“Hey, come on now. I’m trying to make nice!”</p><p>I raise an eyebrow. “So all that was just false flattery?”</p><p>Potter chuckles. “I can’t get a thing past you, Evans.”</p><p>Before I can respond, Evelyn Taylor walks up behind him and places a manicured hand on his shoulder. Potter looks up and smiles when he sees that it’s her, leaning back slightly to rest his head against her.</p><p>“Hi, love,” he says. “Perfect timing, we’re just finishing up.”</p><p>Evelyn nods and, over the top of his head, she smiles at me. “Hi, Lily. Congratulations on getting Head Girl.”</p><p>I glance away from the possessive grip she has on his shoulder and return her smile. “Thank you.”</p><p>Evelyn Taylor is Potter’s on again, off again, on again, off again, on again (etc.) girlfriend. They’d arrived at school a couple at the start of sixth year, and spent the rest of it breaking up and making up again and again. The last time I saw them, at the end of the school year, they’d been broken up. I guess now they’re on again, and I just barely avoid rolling my eyes. If I have to hear her crying in our dorm over him one more time, I might just slap some sense into her myself.</p><p>I get up and slip the strap of my bag over my shoulder. “See you guys at school.”</p><p>“Bye, Evans.” Potter gets up too, but he barely glances at me and turns around to face Evelyn. As I walk past them to get to the Diagon Alley exit, his mouth is already firmly latched on to her’s.</p><p>Right. This is the James Potter I know.</p>
