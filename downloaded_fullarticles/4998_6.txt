    <p>Prologue</p><p>( The Forbidden Forest )</p><p> </p><p>There lies a story, weaved around the forest that lies and looms on the horizon. When you head to the village edge, and listen to the old retired Guard, who still spends every night sitting there, keeping the fire, and he will tell you of the tale of the forest and the family that went when the forest came. Of the beasts and nightmares and fogs of despair, that simply appeared and stayed, and the family that no one remembers clearly, like a uncertain dream, forgotten. The Potters, the old man may have once said. He still says that the unborn child of the family still haunts the area, seeking vengeance and protecting the land where its own blood seeped deep into the heart of every tree grown.</p><p>Another tale tells of when the moon first became red, as if dipped in blood, of how the horrors of the forest came to tear the hearts out of unsuspecting villagers, of creatures of the worst nightmares terrorizing all - all until the village’s priest rode deep into the forest, and a tolling bell was heard, rolling through the fog with a faint ghostly glow. With each fading ring, the creatures had been drawn back into the darkness, and with each ring, the villagers realised it came from deep within the forest. Some claim they saw a shadowed figure, atop the very steed the priest had ridden, rotten with death and hellish with wings of nightmares and screeches of bats, watching them through the trees. A figure hidden in tattered cloak, with skeletal hands gripping bloodied reins. There are many tales, but all agree - there was a fearsome monster that commanded the forest and the sacrifice of the priest had been needed to appease the horrors of the forest.</p><p>Or so it was told, for why now every 3 to 4 years, when the Blood Moon rises, a sacrifice must be sent into the forest, to the monster they say that governs the creatures of the night, a hideous monster that even Death dares not touch.</p>
