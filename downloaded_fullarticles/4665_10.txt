    <p>“Harriet Cecilia Potter!” Remus Lupin called out angrily.</p><p>She was going to drive them late.</p><p>“Just two more minutes, daddy…”</p><p>Water was splashing in the bathroom and somehow, Remus knew she was swimming around, diving back in her animagus’ form. Harriet was a brilliant young witch. Sometimes, it drove her surrogate family close to madness. She could transform into a sea turtle and had taken the habit to transform at least once every day. Her baths always took an awful lot because she retired in the mind of the turtle, so she could escape from reality. Remus impatiently checked the clock that was ticking every new minutes. Sirius chuckled at the look on his lover’s face.</p><p>“It’s not that bad, her school things won’t run away you know.”</p><p>“Why again aren’t you coming with us, Padfoot?”</p><p>“I have work to do, the Men Eaters won’t catch themselves.”</p><p>It was always the same excuses. As an Auror, Sirius had to chase the nefarious Men Eaters, a cast following in the traces of you-know-who and her never-ending quest to annihilate homosexuality and patriarchy in any of their form. Wizard or Muggle. It was already hard to protect the wizarding world’s people, but the secret of magic itself was at stake since the start of this… peculiar war of ideals. It had all started fifteen years ago, when a mysterious witch tried to kill Albus Dumbledore. Ever since, Hogwarts’ headmaster had been on the run and men allegedly mistreating women or being openly gay had started dying. Ministers were ambushed and subjected to either of the Unforgivable Curses. Family had been destroyed. Women were killed if they tried to defend their brothers, husbands or sons. She-who-must-no-be-named was angry at the whole world. She chased Dumbledore and many other wizards around the world. For the muggles, it was some sexist psychopath. For Remus and Sirius, it was a constant reminder that their domestic situation should remain as unknown as possible. Thankfully, you-know-who hadn’t been really active in the five last years, attacking in other countries mostly, while her followers were randomly attacking people every now and then, keeping the ministry of Magic on its toes.</p><p>Despite the fact the werewolf’s self-esteem was higher than usual, he was still panicked when he had to face the wizarding world. Being a werewolf was already bad in the eyes of wizard, and being gay was almost just as bad given you-know-who’s actions. Going on Diagon Alley was a challenge for him. Harriet had barely ever been exposed to the wizarding world herself and he was one overly protective father.</p><p>“Sirius, I …”</p><p>Energetic thumping preceded the young teenage girl as she rushed down the stairs and excitedly started to jump around their kitchen. Her short hair was still wet from her bath and she wore blue jeans and a rock sweater. Both men looked up and while Sirius smiled, Remus held it back, knowing one of them had to be serious to ground her a little.</p><p>“Are we taking the floo this time?!” Harriet asked as she slipped one arm beneath the wolf’s arm.</p><p>Harriet Potter was your typical, average young witch. She was renowned as the last living heir to the Potter family. Her father, James Potter, had died by the hand of you-know-who almost eleven years ago for reasons Remus and Sirius couldn’t begin to fathom. James had never appeared the kind to conjure the-one-who-should-not-be-named’s hatred. Actually, Harriet should have been in more danger living with her two godfathers. It was the main reason they stayed in a modern muggle neighborhood. Once a month, Sirius had to cast all the deafening spells he knew to prevent the people on their street to suspect Remus’ true nature. Lily Evans, the family friend and Harriet’s godmother also came at least once a month to deliver the Wolfsbane potion that she prepared. Harriet would learn how to make it as soon as she’d start studying at Hogwarts.</p><p>“Dearie, don’t be too hard on Moony, his transformation was just a few days ago.” Sirius reminded her.</p><p>She gave them a sheepish grin as Remus shrugged.</p><p>“I’m not that sore. Did you pour salt in your bath water again, Harriet?” the werewolf asked, removing a large chalk of salt from her damp hair.</p><p>“I’m a sea turtle, not a salmon!”             </p><p>“My sweet turtle, you should know better than to leave salt in your hair.”</p><p>“You’re both avoiding my question. We’re taking the bus, dad? Again?”</p><p>“You know we need to lay low Harriet.” Sirius warned her.</p><p>Harriet felt tired of her recluse life. She was always on her own and both of her dads were awesome, she couldn’t complain, but the magic wanted to soar in her blood. She wished she could use it all the time. In a few days, she would turn eleven and be forced to keep her magic usage to a minimum. She was one non-registered animagus and she would be watched closely by the ministry whenever she’d be out of school. Speaking of school, she couldn’t wait to get there. And the first step was getting in Diagon Alley and collecting her school stuff. Remus had promised to let her into her vault in Gringotts for the second time of her life and even to let her buy a pet if she felt up to it.</p><p>“Nothing bad has happened recently. I know there has been dark times in the past, but she-who-has-no-name hasn’t done anything for a while now.”</p><p>She didn’t miss James Potter. She was too young to remember him and even though she had a bunch of albums filled with photographs of her biological father, the young girl wasn’t sure she’d wanted a different life. Remus was dotting and caring while Sirius was crazy and downright funny. She had the best fathers in the world. Whenever kids tried to make fun of her for being raised by two men, she’d stand strong and smiled at their mean words. The only real regret she carried was not knowing who her mother was. James had cut himself from his friends around the moment of her birth and had never gotten married or engaged. Magic wasn’t as advanced as Muggle science and despite the extensive research both her adoptive fathers had done, this mystery had remained unsolved. To compensate being motherless, she had three fathers instead of one.</p><p>“We’ll use floo next time, Harriet.” Remus suggested as he checked her school list for the nth time. Sirius had gotten up from the kitchen’s table and was gathering his work tools. He kissed her on the cheek and exchanged a brief kiss with the werewolf before to urge them out. The pattern was pretty usual.</p><p>Lupin had a lot more free-time than Sirius, being mostly un-employed. He had been the one nursing Harriet when she was an infant or whenever she got sick.</p><p>“You’ll miss the bus at this rate. Go already, you’ll bicker on the road.” He cheered them.</p><p>“Good day, dad,” she bid him goodbye.</p><p>They climbed on the muggle bus and sat down on their usual row, receiving a few stares. There had been talks around the town about the pair of men raising a daughter. Old-fashioned people were outraged while the authorities shut a blind eye and most of the neighbours just wanted to mind about their own problem. Harriet was quite normal and average for a witch walking among Muggles. Although her aura was attracting all kind of attention. A speck of Veela’s blood was flowing in her veins and she could mesmerize both wizards and muggles. She hated that aspect of herself, not ready at all to open herself to the idea of love or boys. Or even girls if she had to realize it was her preference. Harriet cut her hair short, hoping it was taking most of the charm away. She had a pale complexion beneath a few freckles and dark hair. Her eyes were pitch black, but there was always a twinkle in her irises.</p><p>“Don’t pull any stunt, young girl.” Remus warned her as he observed how she was eyeing a pair of boys on the other side of the bus.</p><p>Harriet was pretty normal and average, when she didn’t let her magic run wild. She had managed to set a cat on fire one day and even to have a boy dancing on his desk in the middle of class for one hour straight. Although the people around her thought it was coincidences or spur of the moment decisions, her fathers knew she was doing this.</p><p>She was the only witch around the neighborhood. Sirius and Remus had worked hard to keep her isolated. They wanted her safe even if that meant bored.</p><p>“I wouldn’t try anything with a master of stunt around.” She retorted.</p><p>The trio had enjoyed pulling tricks at each other for most of her life. Harmless things most of the time, but enough to have Lily rolling her eyes at their antics. Remus tried to be the sensible one, but he knew how laughing could keep someone healthy and mostly happy. He needed Harriet to be happy, after not being there for James when he needed help and protection. Wormtail’s treason and James’ death had left the Phoenix’s Order in shambles. Dumbledore had been running all over the world, barely staying alive. Snape had vanished for two years, surely joining the dark arts while Evans raised a counter force with the Longbottom’s and the Lovegood’s. Lily alone had survived it, taking Neville under her wing while Luna Lovegood was sent to foreign parents back in London. So many orphans filled the world, on any side, people getting caught in the crossfires of the Men Eaters’ attacks…</p><p>Noticing from his darkening features that Remus was nurturing dark thoughts, Harriet grabbed his hand and squeezed it, hoping she could remind him that the dark years were almost over. No major attack had happened in the Muggle or magical world for such a long time. She was too young to worry about it, but she was worried. Her godfathers could be the next on <em>her</em> list and she had always prayed that nothing befall them. There was nothing unnatural about Remus and Sirius’ love. She found it gross every now and then when they would go more lovey-dovey, but she mostly thought they were sweet. And she saw how happy they made each other. She would never understand homophobia.</p><p>“You think I should buy an owl? I could write to you every day.” She whispered to him excitedly.</p><p>“It would have to be a bird that can’t catch attention. How about a cat or…”</p><p>She almost hissed at the notion. For some reason, Harriet hated cats and all type of felines. They frightened her as a kid and she was still scared whenever she spotted one on the street.</p><p>“We’ll wait until we reach the shop and check what catch your interest. As long as you remember the responsibilities that come with it.”</p><p>She nodded, mimicking his serious intonation as she motioned her lips without uttering a single sound. That made him smile, although he retorted by tickling her. They almost missed their stop and hurriedly walked into Tom’s pub, Harriet walking closer to Remus with the more people she saw. She was a little shy around the pub. Tom ruffled her hair and nodded to her father, offering him something to drink.</p><p>“Later maybe, Tom. We’re here on school business today.”</p><p>A few congratulations resounded around the pub. James Potter had been greatly loved and Harriet being his daughter, she was usually received with the same attention by the wizards following the most modern ways. The Men Eaters and their supporters on the contrary never sympathized with victims of she-who-had-no-name. It was those people that Harriet shied away from and she knew she might meet some of them on her way through Diagon Alley.</p><p>To her surprise, they met Lily Evans and Neville Longbottom after collecting Harriet’s books and cauldron. Lily looked radiant as ever and smiled widely as she noticed the young girl and her father.</p><p>“Remus, Harriet, it’s so good to see you both!”</p><p>“Aunt Lily!”</p><p>“Is that Neville? You’ve certainly grown since last time,” Remus observed.</p><p>Longbottom was a lanky young man, all nerves and bones. He trained a lot in sports, wishing to be part of the Wrestomb team of his house at Hogwarts. Wrestomb was all the rage, with wizards and witches competing against each other in different tasks, from magical wrestling to spellcasting duels, from broom racing to creature taming. First year couldn’t join the teams unless they were already quite trained and Neville had had all the support he needed from Lily to nurture big dreams. He was really self-conscious and a bit shy around Harriet, but the young girl never minded it. Neville had a traumatic background, with his whole family being killed only for opposing you-know-who’s terrible work. He could have been a lot quieter and awkward then he was.</p><p>“Wow, did you finally put on some muscles?” Harriet teased him.</p><p>He blushed, but still managed to retort without a single stutter.</p><p>“At our age, it’s not as easy as you’d think.”</p><p>Harriet shrugged her shoulders. She liked watching Wrestomb competitions, but she knew turning her small frame into anything strong was preposterous. Whenever she got herself in trouble, her wits were her allies.</p><p>“Did you already got yourself a wand?” she asked Neville.</p><p>Their respective tutors were chatting together, Lily asking subtly if her latest wolfbane’s potion had done the trick. Sometimes, her ingredients weren’t from prime quality and she always worried about her friend’s condition.</p><p>“It was perfect, as always. How about going to Ollivander together? I think those young wizards are going to burst with excitement.”</p><p>They went on with their shopping as a group, getting smiles and greetings at most if not every turns. Lily Evans, though a well-known adversary of you-know-who, was literally adored by the magical community. Teaching potions at Hogwarts ever since the Men Eaters went less active, she also gave lessons to adult wizards during the summer for potion making. She had managed a few discoveries, the most renown being the vampire’s bite remedy. The name was still being voted while the potion was evaluated for any hidden potencies or side effects. Lily had been hoping to find something else, evidently, but the result was still good, although vampires were rare in Britain.</p><p>Ollivander seemed flustered to meet Harriet Potter, remembering her father James quite well. The wands were tried one after the other, Neville getting chosen by a sturdy willow wand imbued with a dragon’s ventricle. The choice seemed harder for Harriet. Most of the wands barely reacted to her touch and when they did, it was either raining or storming inside the boutique. After half an hour, as hope started leaving her heart, Ollivander tried a wand he’d never wished to sell. It had a phoenix’s tail for its core, and alder wood that was a light brown, contrary to the darker tones of Neville’s wand.</p><p>“Maybe… maybe my magic isn’t made for wands as a catalyst. I’ve read that…”</p><p>Harriet almost refused to touch the new wand. The old man looked so reluctant to see her try it. Remus gave her a warm smile and Lily cheered her, while Neville pulled a face at her explanation.</p><p>“You’re a special witch, Harriet. It would only be fitting that you’d get a special wand.”</p><p>She gulped down, noticing how her breathing had slowed as she reached out for the wand.</p><p>“I don’t think I can get this place any wetter,” she sighed.</p><p>Ollivander didn’t share her opinion, but he kept his thoughts to himself, handing her the wand.</p><p>Harriet felt something different this time. Unlike the earlier uneasiness, this wood, this wand was like an extension to her hand. It felt familiar, although it couldn’t be. She waved it gently and bubbles of soap appeared in front of her, exuding a breath of salty, marine air. Her eyes teared up as if a hole, a void had just been filled in her soul.</p><p>“A wand made in foreign lands by my grand-father himself. It seems to be a perfect match, miss Potter.”</p><p>“Is it normal that I feel… so connected to it?”</p><p>He nodded while Remus looked worried.</p><p>“Would you mind telling us why you were so hesitant of taking this particular wand out of its box?”</p><p>“I never intended to sell it… It’s a work of art. And the phoenix that gave a feather for it… wasn’t your typical phoenix. His flames were blue, the harshest, coldest flames ever seen in this world.”</p><p>The familiarity of the wand suddenly felt wrong to Harriet. And the bubbles turned to snowflakes, as the whole room lost its warmth.</p><p>“Do I really need a wand?” she asked, looking up to her father.</p><p>Remus hesitated.</p><p>“It chose you.” The vendor quickly said, sorry to have burdened a young girl with his doubts. “It’s meant to be. A wand should be used after all. I’m glad you could find the right wand in my shop.”</p><p>Ollivander still seemed shaken and Harriet promised herself to make research over blue flames phoenix. She’d never heard of it before, but it seemed to mean something more to every adult in the room. Lily tried to cheer the cold atmosphere by taking the kids to the menagerie. It worked, with owls, rats, cats and all kind of peculiar living things roaming the place, either in cages or directly on the floor. Harriet instinctively avoided the felines, wondering if any kind of bird could be normal enough for Remus’ taste. Neville argued with Lily about the pros and cons of frogs and other amphibians.</p><p>“They’re mostly cold-blooded. They would be high maintenance and little…”</p><p>“Oh my god, daddy, this one, do you see this one?!”</p><p>Lupin had stayed close to the doors, most animals being wary of him. He could see Harriet’s back as she jumped in front of a small cage, but not the subject of her attention. He reluctantly walked up to her and blinked in surprise at the sight of the…</p><p>“A dog?”</p><p>“They say it’s a dwarf wolf. He’ll never grow much bigger than this.”</p><p>The little tuft of red fur had bright blue eyes and a dark muzzle. He certainly didn’t weight anymore than 10 pounds and was just bigger than usual puppies.</p><p>“It says that they can deliver messages just like owls. And from the ground, he would be less noticeable.”</p><p>“With red fur like that?”</p><p>“But he’s adorable, dad, please!”</p><p> The dwarven wolf raised itself on all four, its tail wagging at the prospect of being adopted. It gave a bark and Remus realized that this could actually piss off Sirius, while he found it quite endearing.</p><p>“You’ll feed her?”</p><p>“Of cours... What do you mean her?”</p><p>“I can tell it’s a female. And you’ll train her too?”</p><p>Harriet couldn’t help but smile.</p><p>“I swear I will, she’ll be a good girl, I’m sure.”</p><p>A vendor approached them with a knowing smile.</p><p>“I think this must have been love at first sight. I’ve never seen her so excited.” She observed, talking about the small wolf.</p><p>“I hope this will be lasting love and not just a spur of the moment decision.” Remus added, wanting to warn his daughter one last time.</p><p>“I’m not taking this lightly, I know it’s a big responsibility, but if I can look after myself for the next year at school, I’d better be able to look after one sweet thing like her.”</p><p>On the other side of the boutique, Lily was buying a ferret howl to Neville. As their vendor took the red wolf out of her cage, Remus reached one hand out to her. He wasn’t sure how the animal would react to him and Harriet knew it was a big part of his decision. But the dwarf wolf didn’t cower or looked away. It leaned into the touch, licking the fingers scraping its fur. Only a few creatures had been this trusting with the werewolf.</p><p>“I think it’s decided then. How are you going to name her?”</p><p>“That’s an hard one. I was so sure that you were a male at first.” Harriet admitted, taking the cub in her arms.</p><p>Neville and Harriet played a naming game for their new pet, both denying the various ideas the other would voice. Robes were fitted for and magically sown. Soon enough, it was time to get back home and exchange their goodbyes. Harriet was somewhat reluctant to leave. Neville was one of her only friends, the Muggles in her neighborhood either avoiding her because she was the weird girl at school or because she had two dads and no mother. As she sat in the bus next to the window, she heaved a sigh, keeping her pup in her arms.</p><p>“She might be an Echo, what do you think?” she asked Lupin.</p><p>“Where did you get the idea?”</p><p>“I wanted something that didn’t sound Latin.”</p><p>“I have no idea what you’re talking about young girl. You must be tired after all this running around… Why don’t you take a nap?”</p><p>“I’m not a little girl anymore. It takes a lot more than…”</p><p>A long yawn interrupted her and Harriet felt a slight blush burning up in her cheeks. Her father simply wrapped one arm around her shoulders, refraining from gloating. Echo cuddled up to her, and she leaned her head against Lupin’s chest. Soon, her eyelids felt too heavy and she fell asleep. Sirius had always joked that her werewolf’s father’s ability to sleep anywhere had come down on her, although it made little sense.</p><p>Just as they were reaching their town, Remus was taken aback from the scenery by a silver dog running in the air. It hadn’t been there a second ago and he had been too unfocused to determine which direction it was coming from. It was a patronus, one he knew well. The apparition went through the bus and rushed into him, Sirius’ voice echoing in his mind.</p><p>“There’s been a major attack at the ministry. Do not come home. Keep her safe.”</p><p>A sense of dread permeated his bones. This hadn’t happened in years. He went through a few options as he counted the stops between them and their home. He barely had the money for one night in some cheap motel. Apparating with Harriet would surely traumatize her, despite her curiosity. She was still so young, and her dwarf wolf could panic. He wished for an untraceable mode of locomotion, but magical or not, there were few.</p><p>He waited until the bus ride was one town away to shake Harriet awake. She blinked, yawned and barely contained a yell of surprise as she realized that they’d missed their stop.</p><p>“Have you been sleeping too?”</p><p>“Sweetheart, there’s a change of plan,” he replied. “I need you to trust me for now.”</p><p>He gave her a look they had exchanged many times before, a look that warned her about imminent dangers. Usually, it meant he was about to shift into his werewolf form or that Lily was bringing her friend Snape to dinner. Right now, it created a lump in Harriet’s throat. Did something happen to Padfoot? Or the house? She nodded in understanding, stroking Echo’s fur.</p><p>That night, they booked a small room at some random hotel, Remus being careful about everything he did and said. It wasn’t until they were alone in their room and he’d casted a dozen protective spells that he accepted to give her details.</p><p>“I’m sure Sirius is fine.” He started, sounding as calm as he could in the circumstances. “There’s been a major attack and he didn’t feel safe knowing we’d walk back home. We might have been compromised somehow. I’ve sent a patronus to a few trusted friends and we should have more information in the morning, if…”</p><p>Before that he could finish his sentence, there was a bang in the back of the room and Echo was barking angrily at the aggression, while Harriet whirled around to see a fireplace materializing in the wall.</p><p>Lupin raised his wand in defense, although he had a suspicion that their visitor didn’t have any ill intentions. When green flames erupted in the fire place and let a tall but slim shadow erupt into the room, Remus lowered his wand, although he kept Harriet right next to him. The dwarf wolf paused in her barking, before to sniff the air, as if she didn’t trust her instincts anymore.</p><p>“Remus, I’m sorry for barging in unannounced, but measures must be taken swiftly.”</p><p>Dumbledore, Hogwarts’ headmaster and currently-on-the-run venerable teacher, walked into the dim light cast by a few oil lamps, his purple robe making him look surreal. Harriet had met him once and only from afar, because the old wizard was reluctant of exposing anyone to the dangers of his company. The man had braided his long beard and was carrying his wand in his wrinkled hands, his blue eyes glinting with a smile that didn’t reach his face. Being on the run tended to change people and Dumbledore looked older –an achievement considering his hundreds and a few years- and a bit dirty, twigs and leaves completing his attire. Harriet noticed he was missing a shoe but decide to keep her observation to herself.</p><p>“The attack…!” </p><p>“…was pretty serious, I must admit. She-without-a-name has targeted the prime minister of England from the Muggle world. No one managed to get to him in time and he was killed in front of the royal family and a hundred journalists.”</p><p>Remus paled at the news. You-know-you was a vindictive witch, with a terrible case of homophobia and misandry. Any sign of machoism could get a man killed, not to mention that patriarchy was close to number one cause of violent magic deaths in Britain in the recent years.</p><p> “Did we manage to…”</p><p>Dumbledore shook his head approvingly.</p><p>“The secret still is, but our world was almost exposed this afternoon. She’s growing more reckless than ever.”</p><p>“But I thought it was over,” Harriet interfered in the discussion. “She hadn’t attacked anyone in the ten last years.”</p><p>“Because you were better not knowing about it, dear miss Potter. She-who-must-not-be-named has been conducting a few idealist vendettas around the world. She just got back to England recently.”</p><p>Remus frowned, realizing that Harriet might be too young yet to be exposed to such cold realities.</p><p>“If there’s any more you want to say about you-know-who, Dumble…” he started on a protective tone.</p><p>“Of course not, Lupin. I’m here to take you somewhere safe.”</p><p>Harriet was ready to protest, but Dumbledore quickly explained himself.</p><p>“Since your house has been ransacked by Men Eaters, the Order assumed that your relationship to Sirius Black has been exposed. So we’ll need to separate you two for a few months to misguide our enemies.”</p><p>Lupin could tell Harriet was mad by now, he was pretty much angry himself but there was nothing he could do about it. Sirius had already gone on the run and this was surely the solution he’d come up with.</p><p>“Where are we going?” The werewolf asked.</p><p>“I’ll tell you as soon as we’ll be there.”</p><p>The fire was still green behind them and Harriet quickly gathered Echo in her arms, a dreadful feeling settling in her heart. She had said a simple goodbye to Padfoot this morning. Now it looked like she wasn’t going to see him anytime soon. He might be killed out there, without her even knowing. She wanted to kick and yell and protest, but she could tell her father needed her to cooperate right now. Being mature was the sensible thing to do, although she was scared of being caged in some faraway cave and find herself home tutored by Lupin for the rest of her days. What was you-know-who’s darn problem?!</p><p>To be continued…</p>
