Sirius hummed absently. The hair brushing part of these braiding sessions always put in him in a deep state of relaxation. It did in every single life they all managed to find each other in, all the way back to the first one that they could all remember. Godric Gryffindor, by any name and in any life, loved having someone play with his hair. "It's just that, this time, he can be such a <em>toe-rag</em>."</p><p>"That hasn't been a popular saying in at least three centuries," Sirius muttered. She hissed in mild irritation. That had to be one of the most annoying thing about this whole 'soulmates reincarnate together' nonsense. She had liked some of the things that had fallen out of fashion, damn it. Why waste perfectly decent things just because they're old? Very few insults ever truly became out of date, and while more people wore shoes habitually, making toe-rags a thing of past, calling someone a toe-rag still had the implications of being annoyingly stinky. Right?</p><p>"Well, I'm bring it back," she declared with sheer stubbornness. She would, too. If Godric kept his appreciation of having his hair played with, then one thing that she always kept was her determination to see her goals through to the very end. You can take the badger out of the sett, after all, but it's still going to be a badger at the end of the day. Wearing Godric's colors did nothing to change that about her.</p><p>"Maybe if you give James a chance," Sirius murmured, "he'll be able to prove that he's still the dashing Salazar you fell in love with."</p><p>"Or I could hex him," Lily offered like it was no more than ordering takeaway for dinner, "and then refuse to speak to him until our next life."</p><p>"Well, if you're going to do that," Sirius countered, "then you might as well stab him again and get it all over with."</p><p>"That was different," she protested. Her fingers continued moving as she absently wove the strands together. "He had that coming. Both you idiots could have died with that reckless stunt you pulled!"</p><p>"Yes," Sirius acknowledged, "but we didn't die."</p><p>"Not for lack of trying." She tied off the braid. "That's you done. Now it's my turn."</p><p>"Fishtail or Dutch?"</p><p>
  <em>"French."</em>
</p><p>"I feel I should probably remind you that actually killing James might raise a lot of questions."</p><p>"Only if they find his body."</p></div>
