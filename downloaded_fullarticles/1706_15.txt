    <p>July 2021</p>
<p>It was the typical summer morning in the Potter household with everyone sitting around the breakfast table enjoying the meal together before Ginny and Harry had to leave for work. However, the three children were in various states of alertness. James was barely alert as he stirred his coffee- hair going every which way since he took any chance he could for sleep when he didn't have Quidditch practice. Albus seemed awake yet calm- a typical mood for Albus when he wasn't completely intrigued with something. Finally, there was Lily who was beaming with life and already tired out her small cat, Socks, from a morning of playing.</p>
<p>This daily morning routine was rarely changed, but on this particular morning the hoot of an owl made all three children quite alert. James and Lily both pushed their chairs out of the way to get their letters as Albus waited at the table- knowing after 5 years that rushing for his letter would get him nowhere. However, it was Harry this time that was the first to reach the family owl and collect the letters from it. Grinning, Harry sat back at the table, and glanced over his three children.</p>
<p>"So, the letters can wait until after breakfast, right Gin?" he asked with a mischievous twinkle in his eye as the three Potter children stared back at him.</p>
<p>"Please dad, I want to see what books I need."</p>
<p>"C'mon dad!"</p>
<p>"Can we please have them?" The three children all said simultaneously as Ginny smiled and nodded. Harry handed over the letters as Ginny and Albus tore open the letters and began chattering about the classes they had as James felt the envelope in his hand. He grabbed it all over and even shook it to see if there was a specific lump around that he was searching for. When James couldn't find it, he gave in and opened it. Taking out the letter, James opened it and froze when a chunk of metal fell onto his breakfast. The family glanced over as they noticed in his eggs was a silver badge that had a C on it. James started at the badge in his eggs- clearly taken aback before the grin spread on his face. James jumped up- with a yowl from the cat who he accidentally knocked his chair towards, he picked up the badge and began cheering in delight.</p>
<p>"Mom, dad I'm Quidditch captain! Hear that Lil? We're going to win the House Cup this year." He rambled on excitedly as Albus looked away to roll his eyes. Albus cared for his brother, he did, but it was irritating having a brother who seemed to always have everything go perfectly for him. James made friends easily, professors liked him, he got decent grades without the need to study and seemed to always knew all the tricks of the castle.</p>
<p>Albus looked over to his sister, her face looking pale as she mumbled. "Please no practice until school James, please." It was a beg that James had not heard since his head was clearly in the clouds.</p>
<p>Glancing to the clock, Harry smiled at the table as he stood up and took his dishes to the sink. "Well, you lot have fun. I best be heading to work." Harry walked over to Ginny to give her a kiss before looking at the kids. "Remember, we're going to the Woods cottage with the rest of our old Quidditch team tonight." Harry said as Albus and Lily nodded. It was a regular tradition that once a summer all the families would get together for a large dinner and a Quidditch match for any one interested.</p>
<p>Albus looked at James who was now running towards the upstairs. "Okay dad- I'm going to go show Grandmum and Granddad this!" he proclaimed.</p>
<p>Lily cried out after him, "I'm coming!" before she also went upstairs leaving their dishes on the table.</p>
<p>Ginny waved her wand as the dishes began cleaning themselves, as she looked to Albus. "Will you be joining them to your grandparents for the day?"</p>
<p>Albus paused as he shook his head. "No, I think I'll take today to finish readings. I was there a couple days ago working on some Muggle devices with granddad. He really likes their portable telephones." Albus went to visit his grandfather constantly, always finding him someone to chat with about anything. Arthur was a fantastic grandfather who made sure all of his grandchildren felt included and cared for no matter what differences they were having with their cousins and siblings.</p>
<p>"Alright Albus, if anything changes just owl me." Ginny said as she moved over to give him a kiss on his hair. "I'll see you later."</p>
<p>The backyard of the cottage was bustling with life. Tents were pitched on the one side of the yard and on the other side was tables lined with food and drinks. June was just bringing out the last bin from the house filled with bottles of Butterbeers. Hoisting it, June placed it beside the container of muggle glass bottle sodas her brother Ash had found a few months before. Letting out a loud sigh, she brushed the sweat off of her forehead. There was only a few more days until she was 17 and June couldn't wait for that moment so she could use magic to carry the large bin instead of carrying it herself.</p>
<p>Glancing around the backyard, June smiled as she saw nearly all of the guests in attendance. Oliver was brightly chatting with the adults- swinging his hands brightly as he spoke, careful to not spill his drink. Counting in her head, June realized they were still missing some people. The Potters were the last ones left. Leaning against the table, she took the sweet time in enjoying this moment without her regular pest, James Potter.</p>
<p>A tug on a chunk of her light brown hair made June sigh in annoyance. She jinxed herself. Glancing back, June immediately came into contact with the familiar brown eyes of James Potter. Rolling her eyes, June swept her hair over her shoulder farther from James and focused on staring at the crowd ahead.</p>
<p>"What can I help you with Felix?" she questioned; scooting further from James as she leaned on the table.</p>
<p>"I wanted to let you be the first to know that Slytherin isn't going to win the Quidditch Cup this year." James retorted, as June knew even without looking at him that he wore his signature smirk. "Even with you as a Chaser."</p>
<p>"Oh what would make you believe that?" A hint of sarcasm clear in her voice. The rivalry was always known for their rivalry. Everyone in Hogwarts was aware of this. James leaned closer and June got a strong whiff of his cologne- which she had to admit was absolutely delightful.</p>
<p>"'Cuz I'm the new Captain." June could see James leaning over as she tilted her head to glance up at him. His face was unbearably close to hers as he gave a signature grin, leaning over her slightly. "Feel free to congratulate me in any way you want."</p>
<p>The side of her lips curled up as she batted her eye lashes. "Well in that case..." she began, as a hand pressed against his cheek. James seemed to grin before he felt his face being pushed away from her before June pushed herself off the table. "There's your congrats Felix." Walking away, she added "Also I already knew."</p>
<p>James ran to catch up with her. "Oi, how'd you know?"</p>
<p>"One, everything comes to you easily. It's like you sweat liquid luck. Two, my brother was your old captain genius. I knew who he picked weeks ago." June said as she waved to Albus- her only other Slytherin companion here. Stopping, she smiled at James, she put her hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't be confident in you getting the house cup this year. Pretty sure your luck is running out there." Pulling her hand off of him, June walked away towards the flock of people. "After all, every potion wears out eventually."</p>
<p>-<br/>
Everyone had plates full of food, with everyone happily stuffing their faces with burgers, hot dogs and many types of salads. Many people were also filling their plates for seconds or asking about the desserts. The conversation was great as everyone spoke with the peers nearby. Some of the adults were well on their way to be inebriated, including Oliver as he stood up slightly wobbly.</p>
<p>"Alright now," Oliver began, as James looked over with a chuckle. It was the yearly announcements and James knew that his would be the greatest one. Looking over to June, James flashed her a smile as she rolled her eyes at him before she turned to look at her father. James chuckled as he turned focus to on the boisterous ex Qudditch captain.</p>
<p>"'Right, so I wanted to congratulate our mate over there, Mr. Zachary Davies after being a Ravenclaw Prefect for two years is now the Head Boy!" Oliver began as the crowd cheered for Zachary who was blushing a bit.</p>
<p>"Thankfully for Zachary, he's lucky to have Roxanne Weasley as a Prefect for the Gryffindor house." The cheers got loud again, with Roxanne's brother, Fred, bringing her into a hug.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay. Now, can I get a drumroll please!" Oliver asked before he took another swig. All the table began to drum on it as Oliver grinned.</p>
<p>"I'm proud to announce that the newest Gryffindor Quidditch Team Captain is James Sirius Potter!" The tables' cheers erupted in louder cheers than ever as James grinned and waved around to the group as he waited for the next sentence. From years of this event, he knew that Oliver would add 'I hope you bring us the Quidditch Cup once again and make Gryffindor proud.'</p>
<p>When Oliver didn't though, James raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Although I am a Gryffindor through and through, I have one more announcement." Oliver announced before pointing to June. "I would like to congratulate my daughter on being Slytherin's newest Quidditch Captain!"</p>
<p>The table paused for a moment before they cheered for her. Zachary and Albus both patted June on the back, as she grinned ear to ear with a flush on her face.</p>
<p>"It'll be a great year for Quidditch at Hogwarts and may the best team and captain get the Quidditch Cup."</p>
<p>James could barely think as he looked over at June with a shocked face. June, on the other hand, gave him a sly smirk before whispering across the table. "To quote you, feel free to congratulate me in any way you want, Felix."</p>
<p>James paused for a moment before he chuckled. Let the games begin.</p>
