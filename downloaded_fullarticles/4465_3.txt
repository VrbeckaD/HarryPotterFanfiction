          <div class="userstuff"><p>A boy called freak, fed only scraps.<br/>
He tried so hard to be okay.<br/>
And yet, and yet, every touch brought the memories, every closet door brought the fear.<br/>
Who could blame him? All he’d ever known was hatred, and everyone waned him to be perfect. To be sane.<br/>
He couldn’t fit their mold, so they tossed him aside. He burned with hatred.<br/>
His mind fragmented all the more, everyone was an enemy.<br/>
Should have seen it coming, he told them, with a grin that was all teeth.<br/>
Your beloved leader made me a victim, he taunts them, but you all created the monster.<br/>
Your fault, your fault, he chants, the words falling just as easily as the curses.<br/>
I’m not okay, the boy called freak yells, I’m not sane. You should have run when you had the chance!<br/>
Abuse doesn’t just go away!</p></div>
