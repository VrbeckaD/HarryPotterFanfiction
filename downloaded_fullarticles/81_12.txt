    <p>Maybe I'm overthinking too much. My head's gotten the best of me yet again. But I can't stop it. So I just stare at my reflection in the mirror and hope to God that my dress transforms into something more attractive. I wish I had magic.    </p><p>The sweetheart neckline bothers me. The ribbon surrounding my waist bothers me. The skirt bothers me. Everything about this stupid red dress bothers me.    </p><p>My fat arms aren't helping either. I should change.    </p><p>There's a rap on my door. "Hermione, have you died?" It's Pansy. She's glaring at me, hands on her hips, when I open the door for her. "Still alive I see."    </p><p>"Hello."    </p><p>"They're arriving in five minutes and you're not even done with your hair—"    </p><p>"Do I look too fat?" I blurt out.    </p><p>Pansy's confused. I tug at the hem of my skirt. "The dress."    </p><p>She rolls her eyes and pushes me in front of the full-length mirror. Quite harshly, I might add. "You look fine. But is this the only one you have?"    </p><p>I shuffle through my mental library. "Hmmm. No."    </p><p>"Then change."    </p><p>"If you want me to look like I'm going to a funeral, sure."    </p><p>"You're kidding?"    </p><p>"No."    </p><p>She sighs and moves to my closet and starts rummaging. Searching for something. She won't find any. Pretty sure.    </p><p>"Get started with your hair," she tells me. And I do.    </p><p>I'm about to clip the barrette on my bangs when Pansy makes a surprised noise. I look at her and she's holding a white dress I don't remember buying.     </p><p>"What — that wasn't there before!"    </p><p>She throws it to me. "Maybe it's from your mum. I don't know — when she visited a month ago?"    </p><p>Mum <em>did</em> visit our flat a month ago. When she and dad decided to go to London for my birthday. Oh, well. "Maybe."    </p><p>We hear a knock from outside. Pansy looks at me wide-eyed. "Okay. Fuck. Hurry up!" </p><p>She closes the door behind her and I quickly change from my monstrosity of a dress into the new one.     </p><p>It's off the shoulder and has long sleeves. There's a gold ribbon below my breasts and the skirt is loose, ending just above my knees. And I don't look half bad.     </p><p>The fabric's soft on my skin. I like it.    </p><p>I put on lip gloss and slip my feet into gold (thank God I have one) heels, grab my purse and rush out the door.    </p><p>I see Pansy fiddling with Harry's tie, who looks quite uncomfortable. "Potter, stop fidgeting!"    </p><p>"Pans, you're choking him," I say. Harry gives me a strained smile. It makes me laugh.    </p><p>"Well, he doesn't complain under different circumstances..."    </p><p>I pretend not to hear her and give my best friend a peck on the cheek. Pansy swats my arm. "Off of my property."    </p><p>"Pansy..." Harry sighs. His girlfriend's finally done. She kisses him and I look away, smiling. They're too in love.     </p><p>I go to the kitchen for a drink. But I almost change my mind as soon as I see Blaise and Ginny snogging. "Oh, great. Absolutely delightful."    </p><p>They tear off each other. Blaise smirks at me, wiping at his lips. "Hey, Granger."    </p><p>"Hello, Blaise. Water?"    </p><p>"No thanks."    </p><p>I nod and grab a water bottle from the fridge. As I uncap it, Ginny grins at me. "Well someone's looking pretty."    </p><p>"Nice try."    </p><p>"You are! Blaise, isn't she?"    </p><p>Her boyfriend hums in agreement. I give them both a glare and stomp back to the living room. Compliments overwhelm me too much. It makes me question the sincerity of their words. Even if they are my friends.    </p><p>"So, are we leaving already?" I ask Pansy and Harry.    </p><p>"Oh, yeah," Harry replies and gestures to the door. "Ginny! Zabini! Stop snogging and get the bloody hell out of there! We're leaving!" </p>
<hr/><p>Theo greets us enthusiastically when he sees us step out of the elevator. Posh-looking people are in the penthouse and I feel conscious immediately. I never was the type of person to blend in naturally. Harry and the others fit that category more.    </p><p>"Hermione!" The host gives me a hug, not before giving me a once over and commenting about my exterior. "Is it just me or you got skinnier?"    </p><p>I roll my eyes. "I missed you too, Theo."    </p><p>"No, seriously. What's your secret?"    </p><p>I clench my fist and try to even my breathing. "I didn't even notice I lost weight..."    </p><p>Pansy frowns beside me, I notice.</p><p>It's a relief Theo doesn't push the topic even further. He turns to Harry and Pansy next.    </p><p>"Potter, you're getting hotter and hotter each year that passes. Would Pansy mind if I stole you for the night?"    </p><p>"Sod off, Theo. Or I'll cut your balls off." I hear Pansy and Theo bicker before I walk off to the bar. Idiots.    </p><p>And I need a drink.    </p><p>I request a chardonnay to the bartender. My palms are sweaty when I rub them together. I take the glass immediately when my drink's handed to me.    </p><p>I roam my eyes around, searching for space. I see double doors leading onto a balcony.     </p><p>I trudge through the sea of people. Out the door. And I breathe a sigh of relief.    </p><p>There are a few couples out here too. But not enough to suffocate me. I walk to the emptiest area and lean back on the balustrade.    </p><p>A sip. Then I close my eyes, feeling the burn of the alcohol down my throat. My phone's buzzing and I take it out of my purse.    </p><p>There's a message.    </p><p><em>'Where are you?'</em>    </p><p>My heart thumps heavily. <em>'Outside. You're here?'</em> I reply.    </p><p>I wait for his message. But a minute passes and there's none. Another minute and still nothing.     </p><p>I shut my mind off. The anticipation is killing me so I take another long sip.     </p><p>I choke on my drink. And there's a laugh.    </p><p>He's here.</p><p>I slowly turn to the direction where I think he is. Grey eyes stare at me. My knees almost buckle down.     </p><p>I don't remember exactly what happened next. Maybe I set my glass down somewhere, then I ran to him.     </p><p>All I know is that my arms are now wrapped around his waist, my face on his chest. And I'm crying.    </p><p>He chuckles and returns my embrace. "Hey there."    </p><p>I don't speak. I don't want this moment to end. I hug him tighter.    </p><p>"Hermione."    </p><p>I look up and he's smiling down at me. I feel conscious of how I look like and I pull away from him immediately, wiping at my face. Shit. My make-up's ruined.    </p><p>"Hey, you all right?"    </p><p>I nod. "Yes."    </p><p>We're looking at each other. And he's an arm away from me.    </p><p>I can feel myself blushing. "Well, hi."    </p><p>He smirks. "Hi."    </p><p>"So..."    </p><p>"You look..."    </p><p>"What?"    </p><p>"Never mind..."    </p><p>"Okay."    </p><p>And we're awkward. I guess that's normal. I mean, I haven't seen him for two years. But we are best friends. And I shouldn't feel this way. But my heart's betraying me, reminding me of feelings I kept hidden away for so long.    </p><p>I try to lighten the mood. "What took you so long, you git?"    </p><p>His eyes are twinkling. "University and a movie?"    </p><p>"Oh, I forgot. You're actually famous now, aren't you?"    </p><p>He shakes his head, amused. "What about you? Still an insufferable know-it-all?"    </p><p>I shrug. "Same old, same old."    </p><p>"Nice dress," he comments.    </p><p>"Mum gave it to me."    </p><p>His eyebrows raise a fraction. "Ah. Really?"    </p><p>Someone's calling him. A tall blonde in a red dress is walking to us. She's terribly familiar.</p><p>She kisses him. And I almost gasp in surprise. Draco pulls away and grins at me sheepishly.    </p><p>"Umm. Hermione, this is Astoria. Astoria, Hermione."    </p><p>Oh. I remember now. Astoria Greengrass. The model. "Hi."    </p><p>Astoria smiles and extends a manicured hand. I reach for it. "So you're the best friend. Nice to finally meet you."    </p><p>"And, you're the girlfriend I suppose?"    </p><p>"The one and only."    </p><p>I feel heavy. Dizzy. I want to leave.     </p><p>"Pleasure."</p><p>Draco excuses himself. Astoria and I start chatting. About America. About runway fashion. About Draco's acting career. Then about me.</p><p>"You're studying in Oxford, right?"</p><p>I nod.</p><p>"Political Science?"</p><p>"No. Biochemistry."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>I'm about to say yes. But Astoria interrupts me. "I swear. You're more like the lawyer type."</p><p>Oh. "Oh."</p><p>"I meant that as a compliment, of course."</p><p>Sure. "Thank you."</p><p>"Where did Draco go off to again?"</p><p>Probably a wank. "The loo."</p><p>Then silence.</p><p>I've never felt more hideous, standing beside her. I want to grab my compact mirror and check if I still look human. My hair's probably all bushy again.</p><p>I text Pansy: <em>'I want to go home.'</em></p><p>
  <em>'It's not even an hour. You okay?'</em>
</p><p>
  <em>'Tired.'</em>
</p><p>
  <em>'Draco's here. I told him to get you food.'</em>
</p><p>
  <em>'What?'</em>
</p><p>She doesn't reply anymore. I huff in annoyance.</p><p>She keeps babysitting me.</p><p>I've always had her back when I first met her in person two years ago through Harry. She was the girlfriend studying in a fancy boarding school. And that she was also going to Oxford and is looking for a flatmate. Harry suggested me.</p><p>And here we are. I'm glad I met her. She's a really great friend, even if she can be a big snob.</p><p>But she's been more mother-like to me these past few months.</p><p>I put my phone back in my purse. Draco arrives with a plate full of small slices of decadent cakes.</p><p>"Pansy told me to get you something to eat."</p><p>"I can't eat all of that," I point out.</p><p>"Who said you will?" Then he plops what seems to be a blueberry cheesecake into his mouth with his eyebrow raised.</p><p>I roll my eyes.</p><p>Astoria asks about Theo's whereabouts. Apparently, they're cousins. Draco tells her he's inside, canoodling with Oliver Wood. She leaves, but not before kissing him.</p><p>I look down.</p><p>"Are you all right?"</p><p>I say yes. Because that's what he wants to hear.</p><p>"Oh right," he says, remembering something, "Mother's visiting from Wiltshire tomorrow. Said she wants to have tea with you." Then he adds, "Bloody woman. Misses her son's best friend more than her child."</p><p>I laugh, shaking my head. "Same old Narcissa."</p><p>He offers the plate to me. I take a strawberry swirl. Fuck, it's so good.</p><p>"So, are you coming?"</p><p>I think of my schedule for tomorrow. "I have a class on eight 'til twelve. Then after that, I'm free."</p><p>"Good. I'll tell her that."</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>He gazes up the sky. Probably looking for the constellation that inspired his name.</p><p>I study his features. He still looks like the Draco Malfoy I knew since I was twelve. Platinum blond hair. Grey eyes with speckles of blue. Handsome as ever, but, more mature.</p><p>He gives up his search and fixes his attention to me. He opens his mouth, but closes it again.</p><p>"I miss you," I say.</p><p>He smiles wistfully. "I miss you too."</p><p>And I want to kiss him. But I can't. He's not mine.</p><p>Never will be.</p><p> </p>
