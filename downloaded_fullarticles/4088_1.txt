  <span>(September, 2003)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘You’re like clockwork, you know that?’ Dark brown eyes twinkle with amusement as they look at Draco. ‘Do you just have one day a month you’ll go out and get fucked up or something?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco squints at the muggle. It’s too early for this. His head hurts. Everything hurts. He feels like his own skin has been pulled back over his bones as an ill-fitting jumper and his mouth is dry. Nausea builds at the back of his throat. Every sound grates like sharp nails on a chalkboard. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘If you say so,’ he grits out. ‘Can I have—’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The muggle’s voice is bright. ‘Two full breakfasts and three coffees? Caffé Mocha, extra whipped cream?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco glares at him. ‘Yes.’ He wants to scold the muggle for interrupting him. But in fairness, he did save Draco from saying an entire sentence and, with every word feeling like bile rising in the back of his throat, that’s not exactly a bad thing. And he did recall Draco’s order flawlessly so there is something to be said for that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rubbing his exhausted eyes with the heel of one hand, Draco mutters, ‘Good memory.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘It’s the highlight of my month, innit?’ The muggle taps at the register in front of him. ‘Watching you put away all that food. Where does it go, exactly?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Your hips. Everything I put in my mouth magically transfers into your majestic thighs. It is a gift and a curse. While I may stay eternally slim, I am cursed to look at your beautiful body once a month, every month, and I must live in that torment.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The muggle beams at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco drops his money on the counter. ‘Stop that.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Go sit down, I’ll bring it all out to you.’ </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>(October, 2003)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Know what last night was?’ the muggle asks as Draco approaches the counter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knows what last night was. He can feel last night inside his bones. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wrapping his jumper tight around himself, Draco yawns and says, ‘Why are you talking at me? I just want to eat.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I do get that impression,’ replies the muggle, with a wink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why is he winking?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Eh?’ Draco brain is dragging along at the pace of a flobberworm. He feels like he’s recovering from a flu. Looks like it, too, wearing the most comfortable clothes he owns and shuffling outside with his hair untidy and dark circles under his eyes. ‘What was last night? The finale of Big Brother?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Big Brother ended two months ago, mate.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco rolls his eyes. ‘Do I care? Make me my coffees.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Breakfast?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘That too.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The muggle hums to himself and pings the order into the register. ‘Full moon, last night,’ he comments mildly. ‘I think you always come here this time of month. That why you’re so grouchy? One of those people who really feels the moon cycles?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco stares at him. ‘I feel like I would murder someone for a coffee.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The muggle laughs. ‘That sounds like something a werewolf would say.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘You’re joking,’ observes Draco.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Yeah, I’m joking.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Well, don’t.’ Pulling out his wallet, Draco flips through the notes so that he doesn’t have to look at the muggle’s handsome face. ‘It doesn’t suit you. You’re too good looking to say stupid things.’ Draco glances up. ‘Stop that,’ he quickly adds, before the muggle can smile. ‘I’m… I’m tired. Go away.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I work here. I’m paid to stand in this spot.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I’ll go away,’ Draco says, and sits down to wait for his breakfast. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>(December, 2003)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I have a theory,’ calls the muggle across the café. It is snowing outside in soft flurries. Draco’s skin is flushed and bitten from the chill. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He calls back through chattering teeth. ‘I have a headache.’ He wouldn’t mind the cold if he didn’t also feel brittle all over, like his bones might snap at any moment. He stamps his boots on the mat inside the door before walking up to the counter. ‘And I don’t want to hear your theory.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I get that a lot,’ the muggle says. ‘But this one isn’t about mothman, it’s about you.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘You have a theory about mothman?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The muggle’s eyes light up. ‘I have so many theories about mothman.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco gives him a long look and the corners of his mouth, against his better judgement, twitch. ‘Huh,’ he says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘But we can’t talk right now about whether or not he’s an alien or a victim of radioactive mutation. I’ve been banned from mentioning it to customers while on the clock.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘In that case, let me speak to your manager. I’d like to get you fired.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Nah, you don’t want to hear my theory about </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Not at all,’ Draco says sincerely. ‘I’d like a coffee. You are the coffee boy. That’s why I come here. The wonderful coffee boy makes me wonderful coffees and I feel like a human again.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Do you not feel like a human right now?’ the muggle asks. Then, more pointedly. ‘Or </span>
  <em>
    <span>last night</span>
  </em>
  <span>?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco glares. ‘Coffee boy. Coffee. Now.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I do have a name.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I have limited patience.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘It’s Nicolas.’ Finger gun. ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>Wonderful</span>
  </em>
  <span> Nicolas, if that suits you better.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Exactly what part of limited patience didn’t you understand?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Nicolas laughs over Draco’s question and points him over to his usual spot by the window. When he brings out the coffees, they all have a very artfully done mothman silhouette drawn onto the whipped cream with chocolate powder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicolas puts his finger to his lips and says, ‘Shh.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Won’t tell a soul,’ Draco promises and downs the first coffee, cream and all, in one mouthful.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> <br/>
</span>
</p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>(March, 2004)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There is a queue of muggles separating Draco from Nicolas, and he would like to hex every single one of them. Squinting at the floor, he shuffles slowly closer and closer to the counter. The music playing over the sound system reverberates through his head like ringing claxons.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The person in front of him takes far, far too much time in ordering a ham and cheese croissant. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Sorry to keep you waiting,’ Nicolas says distractedly when Draco finally reaches the counter. He doesn’t sound at all like himself—that warm, laughing voice turned crisp and professional. ‘What can I get for you?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘A pile of meat and a vat of coffee.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Seeming finally to notice him, Nicolas looks up. A grin breaks across his face, but it quickly falls as he sees the line stretching behind Draco. ‘Sorry werewolf boy. Can’t chat now. The usual?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The irritation in Draco’s chest bursts into a sudden spark. ‘Yes, the usual,’ he snaps. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Take a seat, I’ll bring it over as soon as I can.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco stomps off to his table, sits down, and buries his pounding head in his hands. He doesn’t need the stupid muggle to talk to him anyway. Doesn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>want</span>
  </em>
  <span> him to. He doesn’t care about some barista’s foolish conspiracy theories. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It takes much longer than usual for Draco to get his coffees and his breakfast. The café is still full of muggles, and they are all </span>
  <em>
    <span>talking</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and it is the worst thing that has ever happened. With the heels of his hands pressed to his eyes, Draco probably looks incredibly, unhealthily ill. He barely managed to get dressed before crawling out of the house this morning, so he’s in public in sweatpants and a cardigan which wouldn’t look out of place on a Weasley. He feels rubbish. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blessedly finally, Nicolas shows up with a tray of coffees and unloads them in front of Draco, who looks up blearily. Nicolas’ curly brown hair is dishevelled. It usually looks dishevelled, but most of the time it seems deliberate, like he spent careful time in front of the mirror making sure that the curl at the front fell just </span>
  <em>
    <span>so </span>
  </em>
  <span>into his eye in a way which would completely destroy Draco. But right now it looks like he has been wiping it messily out of his face and running his hands through it in his rush. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There is no chocolate art on any of Draco’s coffees. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘About time,’ Draco says as he picks one up. Nicolas shoots him an annoyed, harried look. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I’m going as fast as I can.’ He leans in, lowering his voice. ‘I’ll have you know, I made yours two orders ahead of the queue, so you can take or leave it. I’ll take them back and give them to another table if you want to be rude.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco blinks at him, once, assessing how sincere he is. And then, deciding it is at least sixty percent, he slams down two of his coffees as fast as he can. They scald his tongue. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘How’s that heart rate?’ Nicolas asks as he takes the empty cups. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Terrible whenever you’re around,’ Draco replies. He really is very tired, and he is trying to say that Nicolas is... bad and annoying. Not heart-rendingly attractive. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicolas shakes his head and walks off. But he’s smiling. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>(June, 2004)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I joke,’ Nicolas says, putting Draco’s order into the machine before he even has a chance to open his mouth. ‘But I do keep a very close eye on the moon calendar.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco groans. He slumps one elbow on the counter and rubs his eye. ‘Is that so?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Well, I have to for my blog.’ Nicolas pauses for a second, clearly waiting for Draco to ask him to elaborate. Draco stares him down. ‘You’re really </span>
  <em>
    <span>very</span>
  </em>
  <span> regular.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘What’s your point?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicolas cocks his head and raises his eyebrows. Draco juts his jaw forward and raises his eyebrows questioningly. Nicolas gestures to him. He waves up and down Draco’s body. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco continues to glare. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘How do you like your steaks?’ Nicolas asks. ‘Rare?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Medium.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘And how do you feel about beef chow mein?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Confused. ‘It’s… fine?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>Pina Coladas from Trader Vic’s</span>
  </em>
  <span>?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘What on </span>
  <em>
    <span>earth </span>
  </em>
  <span>are you on about?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicolas taps his nose conspiratorially. He looks down at the till. ‘Paid yet today, werewolf guy?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘What, to be mocked and insulted? No, I have not.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Who’s insulting?’ Nicolas asks, holding out a hand for the cash. Unhappily, Draco passes it over. ‘You don’t think werewolves are cool?’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco gapes at him. ‘No, of course not.’ Since he is speaking to a muggle, he adds swiftly: ‘I don’t even think they’re </span>
  <em>
    <span>real. </span>
  </em>
  <span>But if they did exist they would be feral, uncontrollable, half-breed beasts.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicolas fans himself and clutches a hand to his broad chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘You are a mess,’ Draco tells him. ‘I don’t… I do really want to explain to you how much of a mess you are, because you are an absolute disaster. But I can barely—words. I’m so fucking tired. And hungover. And you have a face like it’s chiselled from… something beautiful, by </span>
  <em>
    <span>someone </span>
  </em>
  <span>talented, and you are such a disaster that it makes it so hard to properly insult you. I thought you ought to know that. Because you are very nice, and I hate you.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘That’s the most I’ve ever heard you say,’ Nicolas tells him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘And I never want to say that much again.’ Draco tries not to flush. Fails. ‘Please don’t talk to me.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘You need a t-shirt. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Three Caffé Mochas with Whipped Cream, hold the chat.</span>
  </em>
  <span>’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco narrows his eyes, tries to look icy, and turns around to talk to his table by the window. He can hear light laughter ringing behind him. He clenches his fists. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>(July, 2004)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After the full moon, Draco is not usually up to performing much magic. It’s an effort to even make it into clothes and out the front door. But, with pure spite fuelling him, before he leaves the house he charms one of his t-shirts to read:</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Just give me my coffees, coffee boy, and hold the chat. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicolas’ hand flies to his mouth when he sees him. He does not look quite as offended as Draco had been hoping. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘That is the cutest fucking thing I have ever seen in my life, werewolf boy.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a heavy sigh, Draco drags himself to the counter. ‘You could call me by my name, you know,’ he grouses. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Would if I knew what it was.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Draco,’ says Draco. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicolas nods appraisingly. ‘That’s a very good name for a werewolf,’ he says. </span>
