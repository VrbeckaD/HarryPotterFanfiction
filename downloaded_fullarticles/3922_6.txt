    <p>The sun was just leaking through the windows, indicating the start of the new day. Draco had been awake through most of the night, first having some fun with his secret, and later packing up everything he would need for the next year.</p><p>Today he’d be leaving with his two roommates to stay at the flat they had rented in Hogsmeade for the next year. Although he was excited at the prospect of immersing himself in his work, he was somewhat dreading the next few days.</p><p>It had been three years since the Battle and two years since Hogwarts was reopened. He had obtained his NEWTs by correspondence in the year the wizard school had been closed. It was the only way he’d get his qualifications without having to go back there. In that year, he had been pleasantly surprised at the friendships he’d made with people he had previously loathed; namely the ‘golden trio.’ </p><p>He was happy to say that him and Hermione had become quite close, in the beginning they had bonded over their shared love of learning. It would have been an understatement to say the least at the relief she had at discovering Draco quite liked to study; even if he was teased mercilessly by Weasley. It was worth everything to see Hermione turn and glare at Ron, admonishing him for his lack of interest in completing his NEWTs when stating that he shouldn’t be going around teasing someone who obviously wanted the rest of his life to go somewhere.</p><p>She had apologized afterwards, but Ron waved her off, knowing it was typical Hermione to be stressed about exams she’d be taking almost a year later that would eventually impact the outcome of the rest of her life. He’d told her that she could insult him for the whole year if that would make her feel better. She had which made Draco feel infinitely better during that year of studying also.</p><p>He was pulled out of his thoughts by Ron coming down the stars to place his luggage in a corner of the living room.</p><p>“Morning Draco,” he mumbled.</p><p>Scrubbing his hands across his face in an attempt to wake himself up Draco said “Morning Weasley.”</p><p>“You look like shit,” Ron states, while eyeing him up and down.</p><p>Snorting, Draco gets up from the couch. “Don’t really sleep well during this time of year, as well you know. Besides, I did all my packing last night.”</p><p>“You didn’t even go to bed?”</p><p>“No. Well, not to sleep anyway,” Draco said. A small smile turning up the corners of his mouth.</p><p>“Ugh. It’s way too early to deal with that,” Ron grunts, a horrific look on his face. “Coffee?”</p><p>“Yes!” Draco bounces up emphatically following Ron through to the kitchen.</p><p>Draco reaches inside the pantry to fetch a platter of pastries sitting down at the long table while Ron is busy preparing the coffee. </p><p>“Is Harry up?” Ron asks.</p><p>Before Draco can reply, Harry answers with a croaky “No” from the kitchen doorway.</p><p>Draco can’t help but look him up and down in all his disheveled glory. He can’t quite keep the small sigh that escapes as he watches Harry pad into the kitchen; with only a pair of low slung jeans on.</p><p>Harry notices Draco watching him as he walks in to sit down and couldn’t help the blush that spread across his face, made even worse when he heard Draco sigh. This weekend is definitely going to be interesting.</p><p>“Sleep well Draco? Or did you sleep at all?”</p><p>“Please. Let’s not do this. I’m too tired,” Ron rolls his eyes as he deposits three mugs of coffee into the table with sugar and milk bowls.</p><p>“What?” asks Harry.</p><p>"Yes Weasley, you’re making even less sense than usual,” Draco drawls, grabbing a mug and spooning a generous amount of sugar into it.</p><p>Ron waits until Draco is taking a tentative sip of the hot liquid to say, “Well, I know you and Harry shagged last night, so I just thought I’d say it out loud so you two don’t have to keep pretending that it’s a secret.”</p><p>Draco had unfortunately inhaled his coffee before spitting it out, right into Harry’s face.</p><p>Ron busted out laughing while a red-faced Harry drew his wand and cast a cleaning spell.</p><p>Draco was still spluttering at Ron when Harry asked “How did you know?”</p><p>“Oh, please,” Ron said while still chuckling. “You two have been acting differently towards each other for months now. It’s obvious to someone who’s flat mates with you two that you’ve finally got your perspective sticks out of your arses and finally got together. Although... now I guess you’re sticking another kind of stick up each other’s arse.”</p><p>Ron quickly ducked while still laughing to dodge the hex Draco sent his way.</p><p>“Draco,” Harry admonished.</p><p>“Bloody wanker,” Draco mumbled while attempting to start to drink his coffee, again.</p><p>“Fine. I can admit that we’ve been together since February and have been keeping it a secret,” Harry stated while going red in the face again. “But how did you know about last night?”</p><p>Trying to control his laughter, “Because Draco told me.”</p><p>“What!”</p><p>“I did not!”</p><p>Ron, speaking to Draco in an innocent sounding voice “But, you’re the one who told me that you didn’t sleep last night. And that the only time you went to bed wasn’t actually to go to sleep.”</p><p>Harry started spluttering while Draco first went pale in the face before it blossomed into the brightest beetroot red he’d ever seen.</p><p>Before they could start arguing about not being specific with details and that Ron would have made a better Auror investigator than Harry, the fireplace roared with green flames and Hermione stepped out looked prim and pressed in stylish, but comfortable looking robes.</p><p>She looked at the slightly startled faces of the three men and rolled her eyes. “Let me guess. Harry and Draco have finally come out of the relationship closet and we can all stop pretending we don’t know what’s going on?”</p><p>“I thought we were being discreet,” grumbled Harry.</p><p>“Yes, well. It’s kind of hard <em>not</em> to notice when two of your best friends are happier than you’ve ever seen them, and that they started being so ridiculously happy around the same time. Honestly, I’m offended you’d think I wouldn’t notice.”</p><p>“It’s not that we thought you wouldn’t notice,” Draco said while getting up from the table and accepting a hug from Hermione. “It’s that we thought you’d be too busy to notice. What with all the work you’ve been putting in to help werewolf and wizard relations.”</p><p>“Yes,” Hermione sighed, going to hug Harry and kiss Ron on the cheek in turn. “It’s slow going, but things are slowly improving for the better. Lavender is accompanying me this weekend for the Memorial.”</p><p>“How is she doing?” Ron asked lowly.</p><p>“As well as can be expected the this close to the full moon.”</p><p>They sat in silence at that for a moment. Each one of them lost in their own memories.</p><p>Lavender Brown was attacked and presumed dead during the Battle at Hogwarts. Afterward, she was discovered underneath some rubble with the skin of her back shredded with claw marks and barely breathing. They were able to treat her for the wounds in the hospital wing but had found out when she gained consciousness that it had been Fenrir Greyback who’d attacked her.</p><p>Their worries were confirmed the following full moon when she had her first transformation. And that’s when Hermione decided to finish her NEWTs to be able to work specifically at the Ministry in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.</p><p>Hermione was determined to improve the way the magical community treated werewolves. It had become something she was most passionate about and made Ron love her even more for it. Ron had decided to quit dawdling but was quite nervous about this weekend. The small box with a ring inside of it was burning a hole in his pocket.</p><p>“Right!” Hermione said with a touch more force than necessary. “I came to remind the lot of you that the car from the Ministry is set to arrive at 9 o’clock exactly and take you to King’s Cross. Here are your tickets. Don’t be late! And Harry, remember you’re going to need to pack for the whole year, not a few weeks.”</p><p>While Ron and Draco looked at each other in confusion Harry replied, “Yes, Hermione. I know. I spent most of the night packing and just in case I’m perfectly capable of buying anything I might need for the little buggers.”</p><p>“Well then. I suggest you all get ready,” Hermione said while pinching a bit of floo powder and throwing it into the fire place. “It’s already half past eight.”</p><p>And with those parting words the three men ran and scrambled to finish getting ready before the car arrived at Grimmauld Place.</p><p>The trip on the train towards Hogwarts brought back a lot of memories for Harry. Ron had promptly disappeared once the train was underway in search of Hermione, muttering something about holes in pockets. Harry turned to Draco eyeing him as he was reading a book beside him.</p><p>He was so gorgeous and Harry couldn’t quite believe that they’d both stopped being so stubborn and had finally gotten together. Harry already knew in his heart that he was done. Draco was it for him. Which was both wonderfully exhilarating and awfully panic-inducing.</p><p>Looking at him now, Harry thought he’d like to make a fantasy of his come true. Swishing his wand to lock the door and close the curtains, Harry stood up and started unbuttoning his shirt.</p><p>“What are you doing,” Draco murmured in a low silken voice.</p><p>“What does it look like I’m doing?” Harry boldly shucked off his shirt while starting to undo his trousers. Pulling them down and taking off his shoes and socks, he straddled Draco in nothing but his boxers.</p><p>Draco’s breathing has become ragged and his fingers start to tingle as he grabs Harry by the waist. He loves the feeling of Harry’s skin and can’t help but explore all the glorious flesh that Harry has put on display.</p><p>He groans as Harry starts to rock his hips, rubbing their erections together in such a wonderfully erotic way it’s a wonder he hasn’t come in his pants yet.</p><p>Harry combs his fingers through Draco’s hair and lightly pulls behind his neck so he’s forced to look up at him.</p><p>“I want to make some new memories with you on the train,” Harry says as he starts to nibble at Draco’s lips.</p><p>“Harry,” Draco moans as he grips Harry harder by the hips and starts to grind against him, increasing the pressure and the pace.</p><p>Harry’s breath hitches, “Is that a yes?”</p><p>Draco’s only reply is to groan incoherently while he leans forward and starts lapping on one of Harry’s nipples.</p><p>“I’ll take that as a yes,” Harry gasps. Already imagining all the different ways they can make wonderfully new memories on the long journey to Hogwarts.</p>
