          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco came into the common room and discovered an odd sight. Harry was laying on his back on the floor, face scrunched up in pain.</p><p>"Harry, love, what's the matter?" Draco asked, kneeling next to him.</p><p>"Quidditch practice. May have gone a little too hard tonight." Harry answered, not even opening his eyes.</p><p>"There's also the fact that you've had them, and yourself, out there every day this week even though you know Poppy said you needed to relax." Draco scolded.</p><p>"There is that." Harry quirked his lips into a small smile.</p><p>"Will you let me rub your back?" Draco asked, feeling bad for Harry's pain.</p><p>"You would do that?" Harry smiled at him.</p><p>"Of course. Tune over." Draco smiled. When Harry turned over, he straddled his back and started to work the tense muscles.</p><p>They seemed to forget that they were in a public area of the castle, though they probably wouldn't care anyway. There was a growing group of girls gathering together and giggling while watching the scene. Hermione eventually shooed all of them upstairs and cast a privacy shield.</p><p>"Feel better?" Draco asked as he leaned down to Harry's ear.</p><p>"Mhm. So much better." Harry turned under Draco so they were face to face. "Thank you."</p><p>"Anytime." Draco grinned before leaning down to kiss Harry.</p><p>Hermione had to stop them before they got too far. Privacy shields could only hide so much.</p></div>
