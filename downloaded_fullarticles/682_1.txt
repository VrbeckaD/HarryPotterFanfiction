    <p>Draco has an expression of glee seeing Umbridge tearing Potter's excuse of hair from his scalp. Internally he was cursing Potter for his stupid inclination for rule-breaking fully aware that neither Dumbledore nor Professor McGonagall is here to save him.</p>
<p>'W<em>ho the </em><em>hell was he so tempted to talk to that he could not wait for tomorrow to board the train and see them face to face.his muggle relatives? Nope, he doesn't seem to receive any letters and the condition of his clothes indicate a loveless and inattentive family then... Dumbledore... maybe... but what urgent matter needs to be addressed? It's surely related to his history of the magic paper incident.His cry of agony left even me with increased pulse and paranoia that something bad has happened. But it doesn't seem like he knows where Dumbledore is? Could he know?' </em> <em>Draco shudders internally</em>  remembering Potter's screams.</p>
<p><br/> He was brought out of his thoughts with Theodore Nott, Vincent Crabbe, Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson bringing in the Weasley siblings who looked murderous and Longbottom trapped in a headlock by Crabbe which made him internally wince while Luna Lovegood's expression of nonchalance left him puzzled. That girl behaves so out of the expectations of the norm that makes you feel weird.</p>
<p><br/> Umbridge spouted how she had put sensor spells on her office.</p>
<p> <em>'Honestly, if I had not this facade to keep I would have gagged from her girlish smiles and the mistaken sense of superiority, this woman is intolerable.Seeing her reaction to Fred and George Weasley made the hatred burning in me for her to cool down for the time being. That bint deserved it</em>. T<em>he number of groundless and irrational decrees she had passed makes me question her basis of all actions. Giving detention who shows even a slight sign of opposition reflects her dictatorial behaviour.Slytherin are clever to protect themselves and their own but other houses are quite fascinated with the idea of rebellion.Dumbledore's army and now this. didnt potter learn his lesson in all these years? What could you do in this school when even the ministry has turned a blind eye to her inhuman means of punishment.But patience doesn't seem to be strong suit of these Gryffindors, just wait for an opportunity but no they have to rush in everything.Could not even wait for tomorrow and now this hag is trying to tear potter's scalp out</em>.'Draco looks at everyone's faces and sees a hint of fear and desperation but is unable to further delve on it as Umbridge addresses Draco and sends him to get professor Snape and he complies smirking at Potter to keep up the act of enjoying all this.</p>
<p><br/> <em> 'Just one more day, tomorrow I would board the train and leave behind this arrogant mask that I wear. I am loathing myself seeing  my moral agency twisted according to other people.always a puppet to be stringed around by my father.' </em>Draco ruminated as he traipsed around the cervices to reach the dungeons swiftly.</p>
<p><em>'"Draco you will not fraternize with any Gryffindors", "Remember well son you are superior to others and the mudbloods are the dirt beneath your shoes. Do well to stay away from them","You are born to take over the Malfoy estate so behave like a worthy heir."By which he meant to treat my friends as minions who are only means to my selfish end and never show others what you truly feel, remain apathetic to everything around you, never trust anyone as all are out to grab your one moment of vulnerability and tear you into shreds. And he gives the lessons as they are taught to him to make a good Malfoy heir out of me he doesn't see anything wrong with them he has been born into it and his life is also governed by them that he never developed a sense to question them which has made him rigid in his stance while I accedded to his orders but the nagging feeling of compassion which my mother has inculcated in me reared it's ugly head when it wasn't needed, seeing Vincent and Gregory being ordered to follow me around for social standing and not given the choice to look for friends according to their tastes reasonated with my father's demand for trying to form connections to the hero of the wizarding world the-prat-who-acts-foolhardy ,seeing Pansy groomed into turning a suitable future lady and leave behind her desire to compete in quidditch against other boys just because her parents fear that it may threaten possible marriage proposal, who keeps grudge on a girl getting in quidditch purely on talent?, Blaise is asked to not voice his support for muggleborns as it may threaten his mother's prospect in rich pureblood husband hunting or Theodore's condition which is worse than mine as his mother concedes to everything his father says leaving no means to vent his frustration out .We are all  shaped by the choices made for us by others which have led us to develop a disdain for their control on our lives but we can't break through their commands as magic ties us to them and the resultant backlash would leave us vulnerable to hostile entities so we have to wear another mask and comply like the good little heirs and heiress we are and behave like a cold piece of meat.'D</em>raco contemplated with a bitterness filling him up.</p>
<p><em>'Father doesn't even think to ask of my opinion or mother's which has led us to take this drastic step.Preaching to keep the feelings under lock and key he himself has become stone-hearted and I wonder what would he feel tomorrow... Regret?  Anger? Remorse? Or be his aloof self</em> ?' Draco caressed the letter in his pocket which had arrived just before this whole bombshell occurred.</p>
<p><em>'Has he also made me like himself ? He doesn't see that being aloof makes people think that I don't value them .They think that I am in over my head and won't even spare my friends if it comes to fulfilling my goals.' </em>Draco ponders remembering the mistrustful looks he earns.</p>
<p><em>'All purebloods have a set of lessons-more like rules, order, commands- to guide their heirs and heiresses on proper conduct in society which makes us appear like a heartless bunch of uptight teenagers who are out to manipulate others and spell them to be our subservient.Traditions are important to be upheld , I agree as they form the basis of our Sacred 28 and ensure their survival but change is also important as it's not always about manipulation and gain or loss.The ancestors made these rules as they were a tight-knit circle engaging in trade and society building where one wrong step may threaten the existence of a family and it's status in the community but now the magic community has opened up and has a lot of people half-bloods and muggle-borns and magical creatures of all kind. The magic community's number has been stable for quite some time regardless of the number of squibs born.It is not like ancient times where your burst of magic due to unchecked emotions will lead to witch hunt and witch trials.Muggleborns may be outsiders who are ignorant of the purebloods way of life but they are helping to keep the magic alive by bringing the new blood to the magic community.It is not like I am jumping to marry a muggle-born and the lower status that their lack of experience provides them in wizarding world is the root of the purebloods disdain for them but does it seem suitable to follow the same archaic rules and live this life as if it's a game.'</em>Draco ponders sadly.</p>
<p><em>'Are we even living or just surviving? We don't outright show our affections but it's fine to show how much you loathe others and demean others due to their accident of birth ?'</em> Draco questioned ruefully as he headed towards his potions class.</p>
<p><br/> "Professor?" Draco asks knocking on the door and moving inside the potions class.</p>
<p>"What happened Draco?"Severus Snape comes out cleaning his hands on a towel and vanishing it to his room. Draco smiles seeing his godfather who is always busy in making one or other potion.</p>
<p>"You can never be the best.there is always a chance of improvement"-the mantra that Severus has given Draco whenever Draco saw him immersed in potions making. But Draco has observed and discerned that there is some kind of restlessness in him that is the driving force of his actions like if he just gets this right whatever opportunity he missed would be brought back. Draco shared this with his mother who just smiled and said: "You are quite perceptive for your own age but some personal matters need to be left alone". </p>
<p><em>'Maybe if someone addresses his personal matters then he would come out of his shell and behave a little kindly towards others.His social circle is awfully limited and I guess I am the only student towards whom he has a tiny bit of affection seeing that I was dumped in his lap by father while mother mourned the loss of my could-have-been-godfather.Mother tells me of her Hogwarts days and father sometimes uses his experience as examples of suitable behaviour but Severus is quite hesitant to share his younger years that reflects in his withdrawn behaviour and the rarest glimpses of affection that he graces me with either by a smile or a pat on the shoulder for good work.But he seems wholly devoted to his potions which further ebb his regard for human contact and emotions.'</em>Draco perpends noticing the sallow appearance of his godfather who seems content to be tied to his potions lab.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Professor Umbridge is calling you. She caught Potter with his head in the floo."Draco tries to give a smile but remembering Potter's treatment at the hands of Umbridge his mouth twists into a grimace. Professor Snape sighs in a suffering manner and they move towards the toad faced woman's office in silence.</p>
<p>'S<em>ilence with Severus as familiar'D</em>raco thinks remembering his childhood where after tutoring him Severus would sit in a corner observing him with his sharp emotionless eyes assessing how much Draco was able to comprehend the lesson. Severus is a man of few words which makes Draco wonder if his relationship with his could-have-been godfather would have been the same or they would have had more words, more contact more heart to heart with each other. If anything dire happens Draco could rely on his godfather but he still thinks what could have been if his mother's choice had prevailed.</p>
<p><br/> "You wanted to see me, headmistress?"Snape asked with complete indifference on his face.Draco has come to read small reactions very well which is key to survival in the house of snakes where one thing is shown and other is hidden.He sees his jaw tighten just a bit taking in the whole scene.</p>
<p><em>'She used veritaserum on Potter !!! This hag has crossed the limit. She violated every rule and now she has threatened even a student's free will and mental abilities. I can't just tolerate this now. Potter is the epitome of self-rule and now she has tarnished the hope of other students who look up to potter to do the rightful even if its rash.I have to teach her a lesson. what hex to use on her? Something subtle that should not be evident till I board the train....hmmm....the pimples hex... juvenile...I could spell all her porcelains collection of cats to crack....oh her look of anguish and fury! It will take a night for the cracks to spread but the wait will be worth it. When she will try to repair the cracks it will further damage her collection. Quite fond of your collection you are , Umbridge? perfect move! She won't be able to detect it to any student.'</em> His train of thought is broken by hearing his father's name. "Provide any input you can to the inquisitor." His father's note had declared.Draco's resolve strengthened to provide a parting gift to this poor excuse of a woman.</p>
<p>"He's got Padfoot.He's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden."Potter shouted to Severus in what seemed like a desperate attempt for help.</p>
<p><em>'Padfoot? Sirius?? How? What? What is he talking about? How could anyone hostile enter the wards of Grimmauld place? The wards won't allow them.Mother!! Mother is also with him....what if any harm has befallen her. She just sent me the letter before I had to come along here.What could have happened in this span of time? What is Potter trying to say? Who he? is it the Dark Lord? But the Dark Lord can't enter the place not when he is not given the address.How?I have to speak to Potter.Now!'</em>Draco's mind was racing from one possibility to another fearing for his mother and cousin's life while simultaneously reassuring himself that the letter and wards won't allow any harmful entity to attack them.</p>
<p><br/> Severus moved out of the room denying knowing anything about Padfoot. He can't disclose his alliance with the light side nor could he threaten his position in the eyes of Umbridge.</p>
<p><br/> Draco released his breath trying to think of how to get Potter out of the office and make sense of what he is saying.<em>' I will have to use the spell that I saw in father's study. But I can't talk to him alone. He seems hysterical.I will need the trio's voice-of-reason Hermione Granger. She seems a bit aware of the happenings around her. I didn't want to reveal my position quite yet but I have to do it. Damn you, Potter!'</em></p>
<p><br/> "Professor? If I may," Draco addressed Umbridge stepping forward with his wand in hand pointed downwards and waving it in a circle then an infinity sign and a square muttering "tamen bulla foris stare in Tempore"* calling out names of everyone present except Granger and potter.</p>
<p><br/> A translucent white sheet covers the occupants face while Granger looks confused and warily at Draco. Potter moves back from Umbridge as Draco takes steps towards him. Taking a deep breath to calm himself and seeking comfort from the wooden ridges of his wand and the texture of parchment and softness of quill lying in the pocket of his robes Draco addresses Potter steadily." Potter, what happened? Who took Sirius? Who did you talk to?" While Potter seems to realise that Umbridge is frozen, makes eye contact with Granger who shrugs minutely but his attention snaps to Draco hearing Sirius's name.</p>
<p><em>'About to make a run for escape, thank Merlin the shock left him a bit disoriented or I would have had to cast a petrify on him.'</em> Draco thinks as Potter opens his mouth and closes it looking suspiciously at Draco.</p>
<p><br/> "Potter I asked something. I need to know who were you talking to.Is Sirius in danger? It's no time for suspicions and doubts, this time our goal is same-to protect Sirius so tell me."Draco gritted this teeth seeing Potter's indecision and her silent conversation with Granger through eye contact.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Granger nodded and said, "We flooed to where he lives and he was not there to answer the floo but we talked to his house-elf who said that Sirius wasn't there and that he will not return from the place he went to".</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco analysed what she was saying, he appreciated her for being vague but still presenting a picture to show the situation but it was not helping at this time, he needed more clear information." House-elf? Do you mean Kreacher? That depressed unruly weird house elf? What did he say? Tell me clearly. I need what he said word to word. Anything you noticed.Anything you found strange. You know elves can twist their words if they are not asked upon by their master. And Kreacher is a vindictive old elf who has gone half-mad in isolation so seeing the faces of unruly kids of whom one is of a .... different parentage so he may have said something vague which fulfilled the purpose of your question but still it might not be the truth."Draco stressed and registered in his mind that both the Gryffindors were shocked that he knew the elf's name, good it would prove that he knew about the situation somewhat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Granger seemed to ponder over this thought while Potter nodded and confessed,"Kreacher seemed quite happy...for the first time I had seen him this delighted.... and his hands were bandaged.....I asked him where is Sirius and he said that he is gone. I asked for..... others but he said no one was there but him.... and then he said that he is going to chat with his mistress and when I asked him if Sirius has gone.... to.... the department of mysteries he said Sirius won't return from there.It means he is in danger and I have to go to rescue him... Malfoy you have..."Draco turned sharp eyes to Potter while his mind turned gears taking all the information in and thinking of several possibilities.</p>
<p>"Is Sirius the type to punish house elves because Kreacher is not that devoted to Sirius to harm himself willingly for not obeying Sirius?"Draco asked to which potter replied promptly"Sirius could not be bothered to punish Kreacher.He just wants the elf to stay in his room and not cross him".</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco nodded and wondered aloud,"Elves harm themselves when they have disobeyed a direct order which doesn't seem to be the case here....or when they act in a certain way that may bring harm to their masters....so Kreacher did something that put Sirius in danger but he can't actively harm the master of the house and he is still bound by the Black loyalty so what could have been the case? He might have lied about Sirius's presence in the house....it reasons his punishment.he didn't outright say that Sirius has gone to department of mysteries but merely implied that he won't return so there is a possibility that Sirius will go there".</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco is startled by a frustrated sigh coming from Potter and raises his eyebrows." We don't have time for your theories.Sirius is getting tortured in the ministry and I am stuck here listening to you babbling about this and that. Malfoy just let us leave and we can forget all about this."Harry said with the edge of desperation creeping in his words blinding him to seeing Draco's reasoning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Harry, Malfoy might have a point"Granger calmly addressed him in a soothing tone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Tortured? What else are you not telling me? How do know he is being tortured? I asked for everything you know and instead of once behaving like the naive fools you lot are you are holding back important information?"Draco's anger was reflected in his voice. His worry for mother and Sirius left him annoyed with the incomplete information he was being accorded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Potter glared at him while Granger said measuring her each word, "Harry had a vision during today's exam. He saw some Death Eaters and v-Voldemort torturing Sirius".</p>
<p>Draco looked at Potter incredulously and shook his head.<em>' even Potter can't predict what happens with him.' </em></p>
<p>"Okay so Dark Lord has Sirius so why would he enter the ministry and torture him there only?"Draco asked to which Potter replied solemnly," he wants something from there....a shining cloudy globe thing that sits on a counter in the department of mysteries".</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco huffed and questioned,"You mean a prophecy? Potter a,you aware that the Dark Lord went after you because of a prophecy? It may be the same prophecy that now resides with the DOM and for your knowledge only the prophesied person can touch the prophecy so capturing Sirius is a moot point. If he is taken by the Dark Lord he is being used as a bait for you to go there and what will you do if it's just a vision that the Dark Lord has created and planted in your mind?You know he is a skilled legilimens so he knows how mind works and he can manipulate your emotions resulting in the expected rash behaviour from you which may put your life, as well as your friends, lives in danger. Are you ready to take a chance based on a vision? His occulmency shields are commendable so do you think that he would willingly let you take a peek in his mind? What if it's all a trap? What then?"</p>
<p>Draco seethed seeing Potter's adamant stance." It has happened before Malfoy and due to the vision a life was saved and honestly why are you worrying now? Just let us go!! I am giving you last warning."Potter was growing agitated and fidgeting with the need to move, to do something driving him on the edge of hysteria.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco glanced around and realised that 15 minutes have passed and he can't keep the spell on about half a dozen people for longer.He moved towards the floo and touched the floo powder but stepped back seeing a thin film covering the fire.</p>
<p>"Damn it!When did she block  her floo?"Draco asked annoyed,only as a rhetoric to express his anger.</p>
<p>"She did it when you went to get professor Snape." Granger answered softly.Draco could not remember the counter charm to make the floo working again and realised his hold on his spell was slipping away.</p>
<p>"Granger I am going to do something and you are not going to utter a word. Get Potter and meet me in the abandoned classroom near the charm classroom. Potter, you wish to know if Sirius is safe or not then you will do as I say." Draco made eye contact demanding his order to be followed. Granger nodded after a beat while Potter looked defeated.</p>
<p><br/> "et conteram bulla,"Draco muttered pointing his wand downward repeating the motion made earlier in the opposite side." memoria auertisse, "he whispered pointing his wand to the other occupants while Granger and Potter looked at him unsure.</p>
<p><em>'The Malfoy spells of stealth, trickery,charm and manipulation work </em> <em>well.'Draco  thought</em> as Umbridge, Crabbe, Blaise, Theodore, Pansy and the Gryffindors and the eccentric Ravenclaw looked around dazed.</p>
<p><br/> "Yes Professor I also think that he was trying to gain sympathy by his little act during the exam, "Draco said haughtily to which Umbridge blinked and nodded.</p>
<p>"Tell me, boy, why did you scream bloody murder during an exam? Just to gain popularity? Oh, Mr Potter even last day you have landed yourself in detention."Umbridge smiled her sickly sweet smile while Potter looked on pressing his lips into a thin line.</p>
<p><em>'Thank Merlin he is controlled for now but Umbridge is going to give him detention.... what to do?'</em>Draco thought frantically and made eye contact with Granger.</p>
<p>'Legilimens,' he cast wordlessly maintaining eye contact with her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Harry would never do such a thing for popularity. He just saw a really bad dream."Granger said the words which Draco projected to her after recovering from her shock of hearing his voice in her ear.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Umbridge looked at her pleased and continued her to go on." He saw that.... his parents are being killed by v... Voldemort while his friends are.... already lying dead on his feet and him...he can't do anything but watch."Granger's voice turned to a whisper reaching the last word and Draco heard<em>'i am sorry Harry'</em> before withdrawing from her mind.</p>
<p>Draco felt a pang of regret for such a lie but it would be the most believable he could come up within this much time. Umbridge looked at Potter with a mock sorrowful expression and Draco decided to barge in the conversation... again.</p>
<p>"Professor I think Potter needs to visit the infirmary for a calming draught.I will assist him."Draco addressed her respectfully remembering all his mother's lessons on etiquette and conduct in boring tea parties.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Umbridge smiled at him wickedly as she was also aware of Potter- Malfoy rivalry and saw it fit for Potter to be harassed by Draco as she could not do anything unfair now since no punishment can be given for a nightmare, not in front of witnesses. Umbridge nodded and Draco tilted his head sideways mockingly signalling Potter to walk along.</p>
<p>"And you people are not allowed to eavesdrop on the headmistress's conversation.Mr. Potter is saved but not you. Now take a seat on the floor and I will arrange quills for you."Umbridge looked satisfied seeing the fuming faces of the Gryffindors and the sole Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>Draco clenched his teeth and turned to her again with a forced sneer." Headmistress it has been quite a hectic schedule for you.I request that you delegate this honour of punishing for trespass of Headmistress office to me and my Inquisitorial Squad and we shall not disappoint you."Draco sweet-talked to Umbridge giving glared to the others.</p>
<p>"Oh Draco, of course, I am tired and I do believe your suggestion is exemplary.I believe  my chosen students to carry out justice, "Umbridge exclaimed clapping her hands and the Slytherins moved with their captives outside alongside with Potter and smiled Granger.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco once smiled at Umbridge and turned to leave but thought something and turned back to her."Legilimens" he muttered making eye contact with Umbridge and after fulfilling his purpose went out smile satisfactorily for a moment before the worry took over.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> He moved  outside and told his friends in a cold tone " Leave  the Gryffindors.I had enough of drama for today." The  Slytherins looked at him puzzled but obliged taking a step back. He looked at Potter once nodding subtly and hoping that Potter doesn't fly off for the supposed rescue but he believes in his abilities of reasoning and persuasion and above that Granger and Potter's curiosity and whatever is left of their sense of reasoning would push them to meet Draco.</p>
