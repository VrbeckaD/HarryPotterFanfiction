    <p>PROLOGUE</p><p>Three people sat in a pale white room, a table between them. On the table was a small glass cylinder, filled with a dark purple gas with blue spots appearing before disappearing. On top of the glass cylinder was a black chain that chained the cylinder to the table.</p><p>A man sat across the other two occupants of the room, a small smile dancing on his lips as he watched his favourites. The man had short dark red hair tied into a ponytail and deep purple eyes with blue pupils. He wore a baby blue jumper that seem to big with black skinny jeans.</p><p>The other two was a boy and a girl.</p><p>The girl had bushy brown hair and bright chocolate brown eyes. She wore a white button up blouse with black trousers. She was looking at the cylinder with disbelief and a mild sense of curiosity.</p><p>The boy had untameable black hair with unique emerald eyes that seemed to be the gateway to his soul. He wore a blue shirt with black trousers like the female, but unlike her his eyes where firmly on the other person sitting opposite.</p><p>“This is your way to fix mistakes.” The purple eyed human- no- creature said, breaking the tension in the room that was slowly building.</p><p>“Why? Why would you give us this chance?” The brown haired one asked, her voice full of untold emotion.</p><p>The creature before them chuckled, “Because one is my master, and I made a mistake. I ripped everything away from you, let me repent for my sins Hermione Jean Granger.”</p><p>Hermione, as the girl was called, looked like she was about to say something before the boy interrupted, “Should there be anything we need to know before hand?”</p><p>The creature seemed to think, “Yes, go to the goblins and take an inheritance test and magic test. I also suggest drinking this,” a two small bottled filled with a pure white liquid appeared, “So you can legally sit in my seat, however, I warn you now, drinking this will cause you to never age. Also, all my Hallows belong to you still, as it is in your blood, Master.”</p><p>Harry nodded, before looking at Hermione, “It’s up to you Minnie, you still have family her-“</p><p>“A family who can’t remember me. A best friend who lied to me. No, to us. I want this, I want a fresh start, without the Weasley’s.” Hermione responded, eyes filled with unshed tears remember what had happened early that day to lead to this.</p><p>Harry looked unsure, before nodding and turning to look at the person in front of them. “What do we do Death?”</p><p>Death grinned, yes, he liked these humans very much. He most certainly didn’t make a mistake by blood adopting them, Magic would be pleased.</p><p><br/>

Harry blinked, his eyes unfocused as he saw trees all around them. To his left he heard a soft groaning noise. Slowly sitting up he noticed they were in a forest, and Hermione was sitting next to him.<br/>
What surprised him was that Hermione was taller than normal, standing at 5’9 instead of 5’4 and her hair faded into gold at the bottom. Standing up Harry summoned a mirror and almost tripped over himself.<br/>
No longer did the tiny 5’6 foot boy stood, but a 6’3 stood with long hair that, unlike Hermione’s, had white strips in his hair. His eyes where the same killing green as before, but his pupils had changed to dark purple.</p><p>Another groaning noise made him turn to Hermione and help her up. Apart from being taller and slightly different hair nothing really changed about her. That didn’t stop the gasp escaping her lips as she investigated the mirror.</p><p>“It worked.”</p><p>“It did,” Harry smiled at his lover, before kissing her.</p><p>Hermione returned the kiss tenfold before pulling away, “We’re free.”</p><p>Harry chuckled softly, “Now, to the goblins.”</p><p>--</p><p>Hermine and Harry quickly apparated to Diagon Alley and walked towards Gringotts, hand in hand.</p><p> </p><p>Going up the nearest till Harry began to speak in rough Gobbledygook, %Hello Master Goblin, me and my beloved are here today to have an inheritance test% Harry bowed his head for a brief second, Hermione repeating the action.</p><p>The Goblin in front of them choked on his words and looked at them wide eye, as no one had been kind to the goblins before, let alone speak their language, or try.</p><p>A nasty grin appeared on his face as he closed the till and jumped down, “Follow me.” He said quickly and started walking down towards one of the doors. He led them to a large black door with dragons designed on it. Knocking three times he waited. After a minute a voice told them to come in.</p><p>The office had shelves all over the walls with books of all sizes and thickness, in front was a table with a large chair and two smaller ones. Hermione and Harry walked forward before bowing, then sitting down.</p><p>“Master Goblin, we wish for an inheritance test. However, whatever we find in this test, we do not want it getting out to the public.” Hermione said calmly, narrow eyes watching the Goblin in front.</p><p>The Goblin seemed shocked, before nodding and pulling out two sheets of paper and a dagger.</p><p> </p><p>“I understand, my name is Blood-bone. The inheritance test is 10 gallons per person, is that understood?” Both Hermine and Harry nodded, so Blood-Bone continued, “This process is very simple, cut your finger and let 4 drops of blood drip onto the paper.” The goblin passed the knife to Hermione.</p><p>Hermione nodded before cutting her finger and letting it drip onto the page, not flinching as the blade cut.</p><p>——<br/>

——</p><p>Harry and Hermione stood shocked for a moment, “I understand death, but where on earth did magic come from? And…How do I have blocks?”</p><p>The Goblin looked shocked, his eyes widen before a nodding, “Y-yes my Lady.”</p><p>Harry’s head shot up, “Lady?”</p><p>The Goblin nodded slowly, “She has been blood adopted by the God of Death and Magic, the God’s who made humans and magic in the first place.

My Lady you are, Lady Hogwarts, Lady Azkaban-Flamel. My lord, you are Lord Hogwarts, Lord Peverell-Le Fey. However, most will even call you one of these, Lady/Lord Hogwarts, Or Lord Le Fay and Lady Azkaban, as they are the oldest lines. Also, you will be known as Master and Mistress of death, or Heir and Heiress of Magic.”</p><p>Harry looked confused, “Why?”</p><p>The Goblin pointed at the name ‘Peverell’, “You two are the last remaining blood line of Peverell, so you can summon all the deathly Hallows to you and they will bind. No one else can use them. However, things like the wand will only response to Harry. You will also be the only one who will be able to see death, though you can both speak to him.”</p><p>“What about Heir of magic?” Hermione questioned.</p><p>Blood-Bone looked at the paper and pointed at ‘Natural Multi Animagus’, “The only people to ever had more then one form is those who are the heir of magic. However, you may never become lord and lady magic until you prove yourself worthy to her. Magic will only allow those who love her like she loves us to become her Lords.”</p><p>Hermione nodded in satisfaction as Harry chuckled, “Well, we have a lot of names.”</p><p>Harry glanced at Hermione, before laughing, “Out of all the things- all of them! Okay, I like Peverell out of all of mine.”</p><p>“And I like my name Azkaban. Why not Hermione Peverell nee Azkaban, and you Harrison Peverell.” Replied Hermione.</p><p>Harry chuckled and kissed her check, “Sounds beautiful love, but why no middle names?”</p><p>Hermione smiled, “SO people can’t put us in contracts without our fall name. So, withholding the middle will stop things happening, like the Triwizard torment.”</p><p>Harry sighed, “True, very true. Now, we need to unblock all our magic. We also need to find somewhere to live and go shopping, then summon the deathly Hallows.”</p><p>“I have an answer for that, as you two are being cleansed I’ll bring up a profile of all your lordships. I’ll also get all the Lord and Lady rings.”</p><p>Harry smiled, “Thank you Master Blood-bone.”</p><p>The Goblin smirked before calling one of the lower goblins, “Griphook! Take these two to be cleansed.”</p>
