    <p>"Potter," Harry looked up from where he had been working on his Potions essay to see Draco Malfoy and Blaise Zabini standing over him.</p><p>He sighed. "What do you want Malfoy? And make it quick, as you can see I'm busy."</p><p>Malfoy looked at him with a thoughtful look on his face. "You know, I don't think I've ever seen you open a book when we're not in class before."</p><p>Harry sighed, and proceeded to gather all his things before a hand grabbed his wrist. He raised an eyebrow at Malfoy, who flushed and took his hand away before clearing his throat.</p><p>"Look Potter, I want to make a bet with you." At Harry's raised eyebrow Malfoy smirked, "That is, unless you're too scared for it of course."</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes, his Gryffindor bravery refusing to back down from a challenge.  </p><p>"What is it Malfoy?"</p><p>"Just five minutes," Draco smirked at him as Harry raised an eyebrow. "Five minutes of allowing me to do anything I want to you. If you break- If you gasp, moan, whimper, I win."</p><p>Harry glared at him. "And what do you get if you win?"</p><p>"If I win, and you break in five minutes," Draco's smirk widened. "Then I own you for the rest of the school year. However, if you break in under three minutes- I own you for the rest of your life."</p><p>"What do I get if I win?"</p><p>"The exact same thing, only reversed."</p><p>Harry smirked, "You're on, Malfoy."</p><p>"Very well then, follow us." Draco gestured him to get up, and so he did. He followed them until they reached a closet, and Draco smirked. "Ready?"</p><p>"You bet, Malfoy."</p><p>"Blaise, time us, and the second he makes a sound, I'll send a sign so you can record the time."</p><p>"That's <em>if</em> I make a sound Malfoy."</p><p>Blaise smirked, and nodded at him.</p><p>"Remember Potter, you must stand absolutely still. If you give <em>any</em> reaction to what Draco does to you, you will lose."</p><p>Harry nodded at him, staring at Malfoy with a determined look on his face as he opened the door for him and they went inside.</p><p>Malfoy was slow with his movements, and Harry was surprised. He had expected for Malfoy to jump on him the second the door shut. He smirked at Harry, before leaning in and giving Harry a kiss. </p><p>Harry's eyes widened, and he was about to gasp, when he remembered that he couldn't make any reaction to what Malfoy was doing to him.</p><p>Malfoy was a surprisingly good kisser, Harry thought to himself, and closed his eyes as Malfoy's hands started to explore his body. Malfoy stopped kissing him, and instead began to trail butterfly kisses down his neck. </p><p>Harry fought the urge to shiver at the goosebumps those kisses gave him.</p><p>As Draco kissed even lower to his collarbone, Harry's eyes widened as he hit a sensitive spot, and had to bite his lip to keep from making any noises.</p><p>However, he failed the moment when Draco bit down- hard.</p><p>"<em>Oh fuck,</em> Malfoy!" Harry gasped, and his knees buckled at the violent shiver of pleasure that coursed through him. He felt Draco grin widely against his neck, and Harry's eyes widened in horror and he clamped a hand over his mouth.</p><p>
  <em>Shit.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>This can't be happening.</em>
</p><p>"Well done Potter, you may have just sealed your own fate." Draco smirked, before he swung the door open and demanded to know how much time has passed.</p><p>Blaise smirked at him, before casting a <em>Tempus </em>charm.</p><p>"Two minutes and fifty-nine seconds." He smirked widely, before Draco mirrored him, and Harry put his head in his hands in horror.</p><p>He had lost.</p><p>"Now, let's do the binding ceremony," Draco spoke up, and Harry's head snapped up.</p><p>"What? This wasn't part of the deal- " Harry started, before Draco sent him a disbelieving look.</p><p>"I know you Potter. Who knows what kind of loopholes you'll try to find out of this deal? I need something binding to ensure that you don't do anything that goes against our deal."</p><p>Harry cursed Slytherins and their cunningness.</p><p>"For this we'll need a binder, which will be Blaise." Draco and Blaise smirked at each other, and Harry groaned again, before Harry and Draco joined hands, and Blaise placed his on top of their joined ones.</p><p>"Do you, Draconis Lucius Malfoy, swear to watch over, command, and protect one Harry James Potter for the rest of his life as his new owner and Master?" </p><p>Draco nodded, "I do."</p><p>Blaise turned to Harry, who was staring glumly at the floor.</p><p>"Do you, Harry James Potter, swear to respect, serve, obey, and protect Draconis Lucius Malfoy until your very last breath, regardless if you disapprove of any order he commands you to do?"</p><p>Harry sighed, shoulders dropping, head to his chest. "I do."</p><p>The strings combining their hands together pulsed brightly, once they faded away, they all removed their hands.</p><p>"Let's see if it worked." Draco smirked, and before Harry could do anything, he commanded, "Potter, kneel."</p><p>Harry felt an urge to obey so strong wash over him that left him breathless, and he wasn't even aware of falling to his knees. The pure feeling of pleasure that followed after was overwhelming, and Harry closed his eyes and embraced the feeling, sighing in contentment.</p><p>"It actually worked." A voice said in disbelief, and Harry's eyes snapped open. He was reminded of what kind of situation he was in, and he groaned at the fact that now he had to serve <em>Draco Malfoy</em> for the rest of his life.</p><p>"Potter," Draco said, and Harry was ashamed to admit that his eyes immediately snapped towards Draco at the sound of his name. "I have a few rules for you that you absolutely <em>must</em> follow at<em> all times</em> unless I say otherwise."</p><p>Harry didn't want to pay attention, but it was like his mind was solely focused on Malfoy and absorbing every word said.</p><p>"First off, I want you to call me Master when we are around Slytherins and in your mind as well. I do not want you to call me Malfoy as that suggests disrespect to your Master. You are to sleep in my Prefect dorms by sneaking out of your own every single night until you are certain that you will not get caught by your own dorm mates. If confronted, merely state that it is none of their business and continue walking. Should they persist, call out to me in your mind and I shall assist you." Draco smirked at the attentive way Harry was looking at him. "Secondly, when we are around Slytherins, and only Slytherins, your new name is Pet and you shall respond to it when addressed. You are not to cause any problems with any of the Slytherins unless you are defending my name and honor."</p><p>Harry scoffed to himself. What kind of honor did Malfoy have?</p><p>Right after the thought crossed his mind, he felt white-hot pain course through his entire body. He gasped, and quickly pressed his hands to either side of his head, gripping his hair, closing his eyes.</p><p>Right, he just disobeyed two direct orders.</p><p>"So <em>that's</em> the reaction if he disobeys me," Draco mused to himself thoughtfully. "How interesting." He smirked dangerously as a thought came to his mind, and Harry feared what that would mean for him.</p><p>"My third rule is that you are not to approach or speak to any of your previous friends from Gryffindor. Should any of them attempt to approach you threaten to hex them if they do not leave you alone. And if Granger or Weasley approaches you," Draco's smirk widened. "Tell that Mudblood and Blood-Traitor that you have no wish to remain in contact with them anymore. Is that understood?"</p><p>Harry grit his teeth at the orders, but was unable to do anything else but nod.</p><p>"I demand a verbal answer."</p><p>"Understood..." Harry just barely remembered, "Master."</p><p>"Also, another thing." Draco thrust a vial containing some type of silvery liquid at him. "Drink <em>all</em> of this."</p><p>Harry couldn't stop himself from grabbing the vial, but asked. "What is it?"</p><p>"Do not question my orders, Pet."</p><p>Harry scowled, but drank the substance. Immediately after he did so, he felt at pure ease, as if every single worry he had was vanished. His shoulders slumped, and before his mind succumbed to the potion, he just managed to realize <em>exactly</em> what type of potion his Master had given him.</p><p>The Draught of Submission.</p>
