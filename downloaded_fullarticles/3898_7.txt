<p>Surprise</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Once they returned to the main club, Harry breathed a bit easier. Draco eyed him speculatively. “You did surprisingly well in there,” he praised. “Exhibitionist sex isn’t for everyone.” </p>
<p>Harry coughed. “I’m not sure it’s for me,” he admitted. </p>
<p>“That’s fine.” Draco smirked. “We won’t do it again unless you want to.” </p>
<p>“I won’t say never, but I’m accustomed to having sex in a more private space.” </p>
<p>“It’s private back at mine.” </p>
<p>“Are you ready to go?” </p>
<p>“Yes.” </p>
<p>Harry hummed. “Brilliant. Let’s get outside and Apparate.” </p>
<p>Nodding, Draco steered Harry out the door, and, slipping into an alley, they left. </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>They landed in Draco’s hallway. After kissing Harry, Draco whispered, “Drink?” </p>
<p>“Sure,” agreed Harry. “That’s if you have any alcohol left.” </p>
<p>Draco snorted. “Please. My alcohol stores are well maintained.” </p>
<p>Grinning, Harry moved towards the living room. “Your liquor cabinet doesn’t look that big.” </p>
<p>“Wizard space,” said Draco. “Hey, are you hungry? I could make us a snack, too.” </p>
<p>“Sounds brilliant.” Upon entering the living room, however, Harry froze. “Um…Draco?” </p>
<p>“Yes?” </p>
<p>“Come here. <i>Now</i>.” </p>
<p>“Salazar, Harry, we <i>just</i> fucked. Surely— Shit!”</p>
<p>Pansy Parkinson, legs crossed, was lounging on the sofa. “Well, well,” she said. “What’s going on here, then?” </p>
