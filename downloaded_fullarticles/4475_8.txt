    <h4>Draco</h4>
<p>"Happy Birthday, Draco." The boy smirked and sat down at the Table on the right of his Father. His mother was still in the kitchen making breakfast for the two of them - which was natural since she was a Slave and Draco's father was a Master. Draco also was a Master and that officially for about 4 and a half years now. And Today he would go and find his own little pet - because other than his father he didn't want a Slave, he wanted a Pet. Pets were generally more cuddly and didn't do all the housework as Slaves did. Of course, they knew how to do it but it was just not in their nature to play the housewife. </p>
<p>"Draco. I am so happy for you. 18. Now you are a full man." Narcissa smiled at him in this way that Draco had seen could calm his father in mere seconds. That's what he wanted too - somebody that could calm him with only their presence. And today he would find that person - that boy to be specify. Yes, he was gay. That was something he found out about half a year after the marks had appeared. That wasn't something to be ashamed of and that was good.</p>
<p>"So, son. We can go to the center after breakfast. I told them we would come." Lucius looked at Draco who had already started eating. "Yes, father." Draco smiled again and continued eating. Narcissa, who had set down on Lucius' left side, looked at him smiling "Don't think too much about it, darling. I'm sure you'll find someone." The boy smiled at her and nodded. That was exactly what he worried about. What if he found nobody? What would happen then?</p>
<p>After breakfast, Narcissa went to do the housework while Lucius and Draco made their way to the center with Lucius' rather impressive car. It was funny, really. Normally his father would work all day, right after breakfast going away and not returning for lunch. He would spend the afternoon with Narcisse while Draco went to school. He didn't know what they did but from what he learned he had a vague picture. </p>
<p>They arrived at the center at about 10 am at their house was outside the city and they needed to drive two hours with all the traffic. Draco and his father walked into the large building and were greeted by an older woman dressed in green tones. Her dress was long sleeved so there was no way of knowing what she was. </p>
<p>"Draco Malfoy, I suppose. Please follow me. You specified on Pet, Male and homosexual, right?" Draco nodded. "Yes, that is correct."</p>
<h4>Harry</h4>
<p>"Everyone get up!" Harry yawned and got out of bed, the fresh marks on his body still stinging right after he woke up. He had gotten them about two weeks ago which was also the time he found out that he was a Pet and also gay. A little much if you would ask him. But the 15-year-old couldn't really do anything about this now. He had duties in the big complex he lived now. Out of here would he come either when he was 20 or when a Master took him. </p>
<p>Yawning again the boy washed his face and quickly got into his clothes - underwear, simple jeans, a black shirt and black sneakers. Slaves wore white shirts while the shirts of Subs were either blue or red. The color of his shoes told others that he was gay. If someone was straight they wore white sneakers and if they were anything else they wore grey ones. Harry quickly walked to the room where they ate. Everyone that ate with him in one room was a Pet and a boy. They weren't all gay, just all Pets and male.</p>
<p>"Okay boys so finish up and then get going back to your rooms." Minerva, an older woman shouted over their heads. Nobody knew what she was since she didn't wear clothes after the dress code that was normal for the teenagers. Many had speculated that she was never chosen and had to stay here and look after them. Others said she was the Sub to the man that ran this whole thing. - But nobody knew for sure. Anyways. For Harry, it was more important that she had told them to get to their rooms. That usually meant someone would come looking for a Pet. He just hoped it was a girl or if it was a boy that he didn't choose him since Harry didn't feel like he already could be a good Pet. </p>
<p>After he was done with his breakfast the boy quickly went to his room where he laid flat out on his bed. He closed his eyes and began to fantasize. Harry had gotten into this habit of fantasizing what life with his master would be like the day he got in here. He always thought that his Master would be tall and strong, with piercing eyes and a sharp jaw. Harry shivered and sat up on his bed again. He hears footsteps outside of his room. They are probably looking at those redheads now. They are twins - Fred and George - and won't get away from each other. Harry met them right as he got here and was relieved that they took him under their wing. </p>
<p>As he saw the handle of his door pressed down the boy shivered slightly. So it was a boy. On the doors, there was a little square in either white, black or grey for their sexuality. As well as one for their gender and one for what they were. Harry looked right at the door as it opened to reveal someone that looked like he was right out of one of his fantasies.</p>
