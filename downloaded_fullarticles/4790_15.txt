    <p>Isabella POV </p>
<p>       Growing up I always knew that nothing was as it seemed. But it never really bothered me my Uncle Aaron always may sure that I knew where I came from and always may sure that I knew about the whole other world out there. A world filled with magic and good versus evil and that the real bad guy that ripped families apart and enjoyed every second of it. Mother gave her life to make sure that the Evil Lord never succeeds and are people could finally not have t live in fear, and I fully intend to turn the tables but to do that I would have to make sure that I was properly prepared for this. which leads me to the predicament that I find myself in now, persuading Uncle Aaron. </p>
<p>"please Uncle Aaron! please! I beg of you let me go to Hogwarts!" I'm usually not one to beg but after discovering whom my parents were, well more precisely who my father's where I've wanted to go. It was just my luck that a dumbass apprentice Fuck up a shadow spell and coincidently merged all the timelines into one and know we have a major Fuck up in all essence of the meaning. Though I find it down right funny.</p>
<p>"Isabella, I've already told you no. Don't make me repeat myself" Aaron growled out</p>
<p>"Actually, Son we might be able to use this to our advantage and to figure out what is going on. Furthermore, Isabella and Jason do have a right to go to Hogwarts to further home their ability." Thank you, grandpa!! I so owe you one!</p>
<p>"Really I can go!?" I'm practically vibrating with anticipation</p>
<p>Uncle Aaron sighed and looked at me. "Fine, I just worry we know how evil and murderous the Dumbledore family can be. I don't know what I would do if anything happened to you guys. I'll agree but on one condition." Uncle Aaron didn't make Auror for anything, he's damn good at his job. "Not only are Isabella and Jason going to Hogwarts but Katrina, Seraphina, Lily-Ann, Luna-Rose, and Juliet. Am I clear if they aren't going then neither are you, am I clear Isabella?" Well shit.</p>
<p>" Yes, .sir " can't say much on that now can I?</p>
<p>I sign and walk towards the door not really sure how I'm going to go about this. How do you tell you brother yet alone your friends that the only way out of this gilded cage is if they agree to go to Hogwarts with me? Well fuck!! I sigh as I walk to the Runes that I found that Jason and I dubbed our escape.</p>

<p>Uncle Aaron just had to make this difficult, didn't he? he really doesn't want me to go to Hogwarts. with a new determination in mind, I head to where I know they would be.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>General POV</p>
<p>Isabella walked down the path that leads to where her group was knowing that they would love the idea she had. who wouldn't they were after known for being up to no good. Isabella noticed her group and smiled. </p>
<p>"Hey, guys! So you want the good news or the laughable news?"Isabella asked after sitting down with them. </p>
<p>"well that depends, are we going to like either of them?" Kitty (Katrina ) Said with a smirk knowing that Isabella usually only said that when she had an idea in mind to where the situation could work in their favor. </p>
<p>Jason chuckled "knowing Isabella it most likely does" Isabella smiled and chuckled while shaking her head. </p>
<p>"well tell us!" Isabella laughed when they all yelled it at the same time </p>
<p>"OK, OK"Isabella "well the only way we're going to Hogwarts is if all seven of us go" at that everyone laughed because that was  the plan, to begin with, "so looks like were going to Hogwarts" they smirked because they knew Isabella was hiding something that was going to make this even more worth it. Jewels (Juliet) smirked while leaning back in the brook and cocked her head.</p>
<p>"OK spit it out what else is there you told us the good, Now what is the laughable?" Juliet stated with a curious tone to her words*Lily and Luna leaned forward also curious about what was so funny, Kitty and Sara (Seraphina) wore perplexed looks on their faces wondering what it was that Isabella had to say that was going to top the fact that they were going to be able to go to Hogwarts? what ever it was even Jason didn't know.</p>
<p>"OK, so I told you the news of use being able to go to Hogwarts we knew it was a possibility that Uncle Aaron would play that card, to begin with. he doesn't want Jason and me to go to Hogwarts or meet are fathers" Isabelle's voice cracked at that point they all knew that Isabella just wants to meet her mothers mates and that fact that her uncle made sure that it wasn't possible only fueled their need to make it possible. Jason and the girls got up and hugged her. Isabella sooked up the affection and smiled "OK" Isabella takes in a breath and continues where she left off " But what Uncle Aaron doesn't know is what I overheard a few of the Shadow Keepers talking about, apparently one of the Apprentices fucked up a ritual and ended up bringing back dead people" everyone wore shocked faces with 'what the fuck' looks on their faces. Isabella laughed at that" but it gets better not only did they fuck it up so back that all the shadow lines fused"</p>
<p>"your kidding right!!" they all yelled out at Isabella </p>
<p>"nope." Isabella said while popping the 'p' </p>
<p>"shit" was all Jason could say while raking his hands through his hair shock covering his face</p>
<p>"dude that means that not only did formally deceased witches and wizards come back from the dead." Kitty said with shock in her voice now sitting leaning forward with her head in her hands shaking her head in disbelief</p>
<p>"but that somewhere along the way people got de-aged back to who knows what age this shit isn't something you play around with." Sara said baffled </p>
<p>"fuck that shit! id like to know how the fuck an apprentice pulled that crap off!" Lily yelled outraged at the prospect that an apprentice pulled off such a feat.</p>
<p>"I have to agree with Lily on this one. though on the same token I also have to agree with Isabella this is funny as fuck and we get to witness it first hand the horrified look on Dumbledore's face when he realizes that not only does he now have de-aged students but he also has people back from the dead that isn't going to fall for his shit because they know to see through it" Jason stated with a knowing smirk, this was only just the beginning. </p>
