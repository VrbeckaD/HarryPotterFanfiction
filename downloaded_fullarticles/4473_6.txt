  <p class="western">
    <em>Dear Hermione,</em>
  </p>
  <p class="western">
    <em>Thank you for your letter. Sorry to hear about your disagreement with Ron. Not to worry, though. You two will surely make up soon enough. Haven't you always?</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p class="western">Indeed they had, thought Hermione acidly. But not this time. Ron's rekindled interest in his teenage sweetheart had been the final straw. Hermione had informed Lavender that Ron was now hers to keep. Lavender, however, had turned out smarter than she looked and had decided against sharing her bed with him for another night. Hermione did not have the faintest idea of the current whereabouts of her good-for-nothing husband and, honestly, couldn't care less.</p><p class="western">She continued reading, feeling slightly guilty for delving into a personal letter at work. Neville changed the subject into plants, as usual. He was, after all, a professor of Herbology.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p class="western">
    <em>Do you remember my mixed fruit trees? They're currently blossoming (breathtakingly beautiful!) and it's time to secure their pollination. I'm sure you're aware that insects carry pollen from flower to flower, but did you know that birds, bats and some magical creatures can also act as pollinators? Unfortunately I have no humming birds available and therefore the students and I have pollinated some of the flowers manually. We're eagerly expecting a crop in the autumn.</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p class="western">Hmm... The birds and the bees. Hermione craved for a man's touch. The last time had been a few months ago. Two months and seventeen days.</p><p class="western">When an embarrassed blond man had begged her pardon for stepping on her toes at Flourish and Blotts, she had hardly recognised her old classmate, Neville Longbottom. Neville had never been traditionally handsome and truth to tell, still wasn't. Yet somehow he had become more clearly defined, broader and slimmer in all the right places.</p><p class="western">Ron's hairline was receding already in his thirties, making him resemble more and more his nearly bald father. And how on earth did he manage to be thin everywhere else except around his midriff? Neville on the other hand... he was truly a late bloomer. They were no longer young and it was time to reap what they had sown. Neville's boyish looks bore unmistakable signs of quiet life, a healthy diet and regular evening walks. Somehow his innocent smile had managed to smooth Hermione's tired expression as well.</p><p class="western">While Hermione's thoughts lingered on Neville, a pleasant warmth started tingling in her belly. She had suggested meeting more often. Alas, her new pen pal seemed completely oblivious to her more or less subtle hints.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p class="western">
    <em>I have a brand new plant, a bearpaw, which I received from Hagrid as a present. You know my love for the plant kingdom is boundless, but bearpaws are a rather unapproachable (and I mean literally!) species. I'd prefer not to end up in its claws!</em>
  </p>
  <p class="western">
    <em>The drooping dendrophilos, however, continues looking miserable. I suspected it didn't appreciate direct sunlight and therefore moved it to a more secluded spot. No effect whatsoever. Previously I tried mixing the soil with both peat and gravel, which didn't help either. Getting rather desperate now. The drooping dendrophilos berries are very valuable, but it doesn't look like this unhappy specimen will produce any.</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p class="western">And so on and so on... Suddenly alert, she looked up as a good-looking behind walked into view unexpectedly. It belonged to a lanky man, who didn't work for her department as she surely would have noticed in case anyone on the Department of Magical Law Enforcement had such a delicious pair of buttocks. His flaming orange hair made her feel so hot that she felt like squirming on her seat. She had always had this thing for redheads. Well, any hair colour would do, really. She wasn't picky. She watched his long, delicate fingers slowly drumming her colleague's desk and to her disappointment, spotted a wedding ring. Suddenly, the owner of the behind turned and she found herself eye to eye with a lean, freckled face with a long nose and horn-rimmed glasses.</p><p class="western">Percy Weasley.</p><p class="western">Hermione nodded a hasty greeting and returned to her letter. She wasn't that desperate, was she?</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p class="western">
    <em>You asked whether I'm seeing someone. To be honest, I've recently seen my plants only. It's not like any nice girl will come and find me at the greenhouse!</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p class="western">A new visitor had joined Percy. How is one supposed to get anything done in the middle of these distractions, Hermione thought with a frown. With a start, she recognised the newcomer's low and reassuring voice: it was none other than Kingsley Shacklebolt, the Minister for Magic! She quickly hid Neville's letter and with her best efforts of appearing busy, immersed herself in the first work related parchment she could find. Her eyes wandered from one word to another, but while Shacklebolt's dark voice kept licking her ears, she failed to form any coherent sentence. At least the Minister for Magic was, for some incomprehensible reason, still single. Unfortunately he was also her highest superior.</p><p class="western">"Yes, minister", Percy said.</p><p class="western">Yes, minister, she repeated to herself. Oh yes, minister! The warm, tingly sensation inside her was getting unbearable. Crossing her legs neatly, she leaned forward. Hmm, that felt nice. Then slightly backwards. Forwards again. She imagined Shacklebolt pronouncing her name with that soft and low voice of his...</p><p class="western">"Hermione?"</p><p class="western">Perhaps it wasn't just her vivid imagination. Both Shacklebolt and Percy were now staring at her, looking slightly concerned.<br/>
"Everything alright?"<br/>
"Of course", Hermione replied, blushing and out of breath. "I was... I was just reading..." But she wasn't able to recall what she had been doing before Neville's letter had arrived.<br/>
"You seem feverish. Perhaps you should go home and rest."</p><p class="western">Normally, Hermione wouldn't have heeded such advice. She actually enjoyed working, something which Ron had always failed to understand. But she really was feeling rather hot and had had trouble focusing for several days already. There was just one cure for her illness: Professor Longbottom.</p>
