    <p>Harry sighs as he rounds the corner quickly and ducks behind a statue, watching as the group of fifth year girls that had been following him walk past, trying to find him. He thought after the war everyone would leave him alone, but apparently he's more popular than ever. He broke up with Ginny a few weeks after the war as they both decided they preferred their relationship when they were friends as they had been a lot closer, like brother and sister, and it was easier to be friends without the added stress of a relationship, and ever since then nearly every girl, and a few guys, Harry sees seems to be either flirting or staring. He's sick of being the center of attention.</p><p>When he's sure the girls are far away enough he slips into the next hallway and sprints up to the floor above, the seventh floor, and begins pacing in front of a seemingly blank wall. <em>Come on, I need a place to escape. I need to be alone. Please.</em> Harry thinks as hard as he can and after a few moments a door begins to materialize and Harry slips inside the room quickly, noticing the group of Ravenclaw girls round the corner ahead. The room he is presented with has a sofa and a few armchairs, a fireplace, a standalone mirror in the corner and a bookshelf lining the far wall. It's warm and welcoming and cosy and he collapses onto the sofa on his back, finally stopping to catch his breath. It's a Saturday which means there's no classes but also means there's more people to stare and whisper and giggle. Harry casts a quick spell to see what time it is and see it's 10am. He's only been awake for a few hours and he's already had to escape. He decides to stay here and hide until lunch time. He keeps an eye on the Marauders map, having decided he's not going to lunch until he knows Hermione and Ron are already there.</p><p>Harry sees Ron and Hermione entering the great hall and decides he can join them now. Harry quickly looks himself over in the mirror to see if he looks as shit as he feels. He's wearing some skinny fit grey joggers and a plain white t-shirt as he couldn't be bothered with his usual skinny jeans this morning. His hair is a mess as usual and it sticks out all over the place and Harry makes sure it covers his scar, which just brings more attention and staring, before looking the rest of himself over. He looks tired, as usual; He has nightmares every night and never gets more than a few hours sleep at most. He makes his way to the hall as fast as he can without full on running and slow down as he enters the hall, Hermione automatically catches his eye and a look of relief flashes across her face.</p><p>Harry collapses onto the bench next to her, opposite Ron and Ginny, and sighs, resting his head on his arms, which are crossed on the table. Being center of attention is tiring, but avoiding being center of attention is exhausting.<br/>"Where did you go? I was worried sick!" Hermione asks in that motherly tone that reminds Harry so much of Mrs Weasley.<br/>"Room of requirement. I had to avoid all the eyes on me." Harry mumbles, feeling at least a dozen pairs of eyes on him at the moment. Hermione starts rubbing his back and Harry raises his head so that his chin is resting on his arms instead of his forehead. Ginny and Ron start talking about the quidditch match in a week or so, Gryffindor vs. Hufflepuff and it's the first game of the year. Harry was allowed to stay captain, considering the 8th years are essentially retaking 7th year as the war made it so they couldn't finish our education. Ginny is still chaser and Ron is still keeper and they've been practicing all summer. They have only been back at Hogwarts for a week but Harry was keen to start practicing, flying takes his mind off of things, so he held tryouts the day after professor McGonagall told him he was captain.</p><p>Harry sighs again and lets his eyes scan the Slytherin table. He immediately find who he's looking for. Malfoy is sat with Pansy and Blaise, listening to something Pansy is talking about but not really looking interested. He looks good as usual today; He's wearing a white shirt and some slim fit grey trousers, both of which hug his body in all the right places. He let his hair grow long after the war, not too much, just above his shoulders, but it's long enough to be pulled into a gorgeous messy bun but also looks sexy as hell when it's down. Harry realises he's staring and quickly looks away, directing his gaze to the table. He knows he has some sort of feelings for him, he's had a crush on him since 3rd year. Hermione is the only one that knows about his feelings for him. Harry told her just after he spoke on Draco's and his mothers behalf at their trial that he felt something for him that wasn't the usual annoyance. Everyone assumes Harry is straight because of the Cho and Ginny thing, but hardly anyone knows he's actually bi.</p><p>"Harry?" Hermione snaps her fingers in front of his face and he looks up at her, his chin still resting on his arms. He doesn't say anything so she continues.<br/>"We're going to head back to the common room. You wanna come?" She asks and he shrugs, nodding.<br/>"I want to go to the library and start my potions essay, but I gotta pick up my stuff first." Harry says and she smiles at him, clearly glad he's showing an interest in his school work for once. In reality he doesn't really want to be a third wheel with Ron and Hermione and when he's in the library people usually leave him alone.</p><p>Ron, Ginny, Hermione and Harry stand up and as they start walking he throws his arm around Hermiones shoulders as a way of silently showing his appreciation for her friendship. Harry sees some girls glare at Hermione as they walk down the table to leave the hall and Harry rolls his eyes. As if he's with Hermione, she's very much in love with Ron, and visa versa. Harry leaves the great hall and walks to the common room with Ron, Hermione and Ginny before grabbing his bag with all the thing's he'll need for his essay and makes his way to the library. He sits in the far back corner hidden by rows and rows of bookshelves and sighs in relief at the fact that no one else is there. He pulls his potions notes, textbook, parchment, quill and ink out of his bag before tucking the bag under the table. He doesn't know why he even bothers to attempt potions without Hermione here to help, it's without a doubt his least favourite subject and he's horrible at it.</p><p>Harry rereads the necessary page in the textbook for the third time and frowns at the fact that he still doesn't understand. He's been in the library for 20 minuets and has only written a few sentences, immediately getting confused about the dosage of the Draught of Peace potion. The chair to his right is pulled back and Harry immediately recognises who it is by their scent of some sort of sweet flower mixed with the smell of rain or the air during a storm. Malfoy. Harry pauses for a moment, waiting to see what he does, but he just pulls out his defence against the dark arts textbook and starts on the quiz the class was set as homework yesterday.</p><p>"A drop." Harry hears after a few minuets and he looks to the side and see Malfoy looking at his essay. <br/>"What?" He asks, genuinely confused.<br/>"The dosage for a child is just a drop mixed into 100ml of water, not a spoonful." He says, his gaze still on Harry's essay and he raises an eyebrow; Malfoy is helping him? He stares at him for a few seconds before deciding not to argue.<br/>"Erm, thanks." He mumbles, crossing out the word spoonful as Draco turns back to his own homework. Harry chances a look and swears he can see a small smile on Draco's face.</p><p>A few more minutes go by in silence and then Harry realises Draco's stopped writing and is looking at his quiz, his eyebrows furrowed and the end of his quill tapping against his lip absentmindedly as he thinks. Harry looks down at his essay and reads the question he's answering.</p><p>
  <b> <em>What is the name of the curse that causes objects to burn on contact?</em> </b>
</p><p>It looks like he began to write the word incendio before putting a neat line through it. Harry watches Malfoy for a few more seconds before deciding if Malfoy can help him with potions then he can help Malfoy with DADA.<br/>"Flagrante curse." He says quietly, keeping his gaze on Draco's perfect handwriting. Draco looks up at him for a second before looking back down to his quiz.<br/>"Thanks." He says and Harry can't keep the small smile off his face.</p>
