          <div class="userstuff"><p>Two pure souls turned against one another by blood</p>
<p>Only an insult, and both would hate for eternity</p>
<p>But that was not to be</p>
<p>Kind words exchanged on a red steam engine headed to far away</p>
<p>Turned the two strangers to friends, alongside a cousin</p>
<p>Mischievous, curious, cunning, yet kind the three became</p>
<p>They all surprised one another in many ways</p>
<p>But more surprised than the scorpion and the rose you could not be</p>
<p>For they found more than friendship, you see</p>
<p>And so the unlikely friends turned to unlikely lovers</p>
<p>Meetings in secret, kisses in the dark</p>
<p>But one day their friend named for a headmaster discovered the two</p>
<p>The boy ran to no one and hid in the dark</p>
<p>For now that someone knew, his father would know</p>
<p>The father with the mark</p>
<p>The fragile seeming rose showed her thorns</p>
<p>She ran and hid among the knowledge she sought</p>
<p>But not even parchment bound with leather can stop tears</p>
<p>The loyal, faithful cousin found the rose but was pierced by a thorn</p>
<p>Soon the rose forgave him and two together searched for the missing scorpion</p>
<p>In vain they searched, for two hours more and he remained a mystery</p>
<p>And so the rose fled to the room that fulfills all requirements</p>
<p>She pleaded with the doors and they understood mercy to open with a creak</p>
<p>Desperation shown through her voice as she called his name</p>
<p>The one mere word caused the scorpion's tears to finally fall</p>
<p>The rose followed the sound, not bothering with light</p>
<p>For he was her light in the darkness</p>
<p>She sheathed her thorns and spread her petals around the scorpion</p>
<p>As they left the room, sealing shut behind them, they clasped their hands for support</p>
<p>They ignored everyone until they arrived at the owl's sanctuary</p>
<p>Which would soon become their own</p>
<p> </p>
