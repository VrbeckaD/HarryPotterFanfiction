    <p>    Harry sodding Potter had come back to give a speech at the welcoming feast, and Severus had expected it to be the exercise in patience to suffer through that it had turned out to be. Most things to do with Harry bloody Potter were trying. The boy was, after all, still a strutting peacock, irrespective of his particular method of <u>accidentally</u> saving Severus’ life. The only saving grace - if it could be considered such - was that the youngest Weasley was not in attendance. Apparently, the Potter-Weasley marriage contract had been dissolved, and the two had separated on friendly terms. Severus supposed there might be some cosmic force for good, given that there was now little-to-no chance that he’d stumble upon the two of them snogging in a hallway or empty classroom. He glared into his nightcap.</p><p>    It had been seven years since the final battle, and the auspicious occasion apparently warranted particular attention that Severus wished they'd leave be. There were to be celebrations of life, the mourning of losses. Dancing, and drinking, and back-slapping, and commiserating, and oh-god-why for hours on end while Severus tried desperately to control both his temper and his greedy eyes. Not that Harry James Potter was making the latter easy. Of course not. It was against his very nature to be anything other a thorn twisting in Severus’ side.</p><p>    Potter’s hair had grown, luscious black curls held back from his face with a simple leather thong. His face kept smooth of hair. His eyes glittering behind glass, though the frames were sleek, and black, the shape flattering his pointed chin and chiselled cheeks. His glowing copper skin encased in obnoxious muggle clothing - denims that clung to his hips and ass like a needy lover, a singlet sliding along his torso like hot wax dripping over his muscles, a button-up slung over his powerful shoulders, buttoned only from the bottom curve of his pectoral muscles downward. He looked infuriatingly like he’d stepped out of one of those Blue Magazines that Severus sometimes confiscated from students. Worse still, he looked absurdly alluring. Especially when he bit his lower lip, blushing, stammering a flimsy excuse, and rushed away from Severus whenever they happened by one another. His beguiling reticence seemed like a perfectly plausible excuse to follow him anywhere Severus could. Simply because he was no longer a student didn’t mean he couldn’t be up to something, after all. So when Potter slipped out through a tiny by-door, Severus had followed posthaste, Disillusioned himself and matched his steps to Harry’s, trailing behind him eagerly.</p><p>    He had to admit. He wasn’t expecting the young man’s target to be the Prefect’s bathroom, but he had certainly seen stranger things over the course of his tenure in the castle. He eyed the painting that obscured the door with some venom. It would take some finagling to get into the room without Potter noticing. He had to convince the mermaid in the portrait on the common wall with the bathroom that he had a very good reason for needing to go through the secret passage that she guarded that lead to the stained glass depiction of her dearly beloved cousin, but Severus was charming - and spoke Mermish. She had relented only when he had promised to have her cousin’s glass polished, and that he would see to it himself. He grinned to himself as she swung forward, allowing him to squeeze into the tiny passage that opened just at the base of the stained glass. He turned his eyes to feast upon the vision before him.</p><p> </p><p>    Harry was in the bathtub, still short for his age, though he'd filled in considerably since his teenhood, his sable curls cascading over his shoulders. His coppery skin glowed burnished in the warm, flickering light of the room, one hand applied to ruthlessly working out an orgasm while the other supported him on the lip of the tub. His muscles roiled beneath his glistening skin, the barest hint of sweat beckoning to Severus’ tongue like a siren. Harry’s head fell back, his slender neck well defined in the glowing candlelight, his face ethereal. Severus crept along the wall, seeking a good spot to tuck himself into while the young man was otherwise engaged.</p><p>    Harry finished quickly, eyes screwed shut, his lips crushed viciously between his teeth, strangling down the sound of his pleasure - this obviously wasn't an exercise in pleasure, so much as tension relief - while his spend slipped down the drain with rather expert precision. He caught his breath, eyes scanning the room before he stoppered the tub, and turned a few taps to full blast.</p><p>    The huge, frothing bubbles smelled of cade, lavender, and a dash of creamy Arabian jasmine. Severus inhaled greedily, eyes hungry as he sat as still as humanly possible, Disillusioned in the smallest alcove of the Prefect’s bathroom, he watched as Potter washed his hair, then carded a smoothing potion through it meticulously, sighing from time to time as he worked out knots. <em> It’s maddening, honestly</em>, Severus thought. The man before him was so captivating - both inside and out. Age had done his body well, and the light within him still shone, brilliant and cleansing, even after war and death. He was graceful on the ground, now, after years of being an Auror. Growing his hair had made him look more refined - seductive - than he ever had done previously. His eyes were still startlingly green, and his skin still gleamed, though both were imbued with the refinement of the last few years. Severus caught a sigh behind his teeth - his strange, unshakeable obsession with the younger man was hellish enough without the potential repercussions of being discovered. He settled more firmly into place, gorging himself on the visual banquet laid before him.</p><p>    Harry Potter, boy wonder, twice-saviour of the world as it is known. Severus shifted silently, jealous. He was so lovely even that ghosts flocked to him. First the Grey Lady, silent, though coy. Then Sir Nicholas, boisterous and jovial. Then Moaning Myrtle. Severus’ eyes narrowed. The young girl ghost swirling around Potter, trying to peek through bubbles between bouts of fluttering her translucent lashes, and giggling into her shoulder. She asked questions, teasing answers out word by agonized word, revelling in the young man’s blushing and stuttering. Myrtle stayed the longest, to Severus’ extreme displeasure. The young ghost obviously hoping to get an eye-full of the goods, now that Harry was fully grown and even more enticing than ever. The bubbles thinned as time wore on, and he tried to keep as many over his modesty as he could. She laughed, a breathy, thin thing, as she leaned over, suggesting that he simply give her the show she had come for. Harry had sputtered, his eyes downcast, wet with embarrassment.</p><p>    Wet with <em>tears</em>, and the sight jerked Severus back in time, back to the Shrieking Shack. To Nagini’s bite, to his unlikely survival. Back to the time he had last seen Harry’s eyes wet, bright, and downcast.</p><p>    Severus vividly remembered how it happened, his body alight with sensations, not of the present, his mind wracked with memory.</p><p>    His neck had been pouring blood, memories trailing from his eyes and ears like a babbling brook, wispy and silver against his black robes, wet though they were, and glistening with blood. Harry had curled into his chest, his eyes streaming with regret and horror, the hot, salty fluid running over Severus’ jaw, sliding along his neck like fire running along volatile oil. It burnt like hellfire. It soothed like mother’s song.</p><p>    Martyr's tears. Of course.</p><p>    One of the rarest, most prized, and most powerful healing ingredients in existence. The agonizing euphoria of feeling that pure selflessness - the need to save, the need to sacrifice - scorching his ragged wound, burning out the venom: A holocaust of healing. He would have screamed if he could have, but the combination of gaping laceration in his throat, venom searing through his blood, and the churning bliss of misery scraping his throat raw and dry, rendered him mute. His body jerked, unable to process the cacophony of sensation zipping through every nerve ending in every micron of his being. The torture of the cure eclipsing the pain of the ill. His breathing ragged, his eyesight fading as the torment crested like a vengeful, cleansing wave.</p><p>    Then, in the pinpricks left of his vision, he saw Harry staggering upright, his eyes red - so <em>red </em> - with tears and terror, but nowhere near as vibrant as the glaring crimson of Severus’ blood soaking his clothes, clinging to his burnished copper skin. Anointing him. He <em>looks </em>like a Martyr, like an Angel, wet with blood and tears, haloed by the pale, silvery moonlight that filters through the window behind him. Severus’ eyes had fluttered, transcendent and delirious with pain and ecstasy, and he fainted, his chest falling still just long enough for Harry to be convinced of his passing before the young man fled.</p><p>    Severus had come to some time later. The papery moonlight had given way to watery sunlight, dancing across the dust moats that had fluttered around the window. And Severus had been furious. His final rest completely ruined by Harry. Fucking. Potter. Beautiful Harry Potter with the tears of the righteous need to rescue. Scrawny Harry Potter who had been raised for the slaughter. Surprisingly clever Harry Potter who had quickly assembled the last few pieces of the puzzle when presented with them. Harry sodding Potter. Saviour of the Wizarding World.</p><p>    Rage had quickly given way to fear. He had rushed, as quickly as he could, to the school, as concealed as he could make himself in his weakened state. The devastation was nearly complete. The castle suffering ragged wounds as he, himself, had. Neat rows of bodies were laid across the front lawn. Some peaceful in repose, hit with the Killing Curse, and left intact, looking as though they may just be sleeping - others horribly mangled, blood sticky and blackened where it had escaped the chasms that had once been limbs. The sight churned Severus’ stomach and he had to look away. These were children, mostly. Just children. He breathed slowly through the yawning pit of despair and guilt that had opened in his stomach, bringing himself back into his weakened body. The sound of wailing reached his ears when his hearing returned. Slowly his vision had returned to him, though he kept his eyes turned toward the castle - ragged though it may be, it could not bleed, nor die. His fingers and toes began to tingle just in time for him to dodge a bustling passer-by. He had followed in their footsteps, though he doubted very much that anyone was possessed of enough presence of mind to notice a set of footsteps out of time or place with anyone else. His senses came alight, though his emotions were dulled. He caught, from the corner of his eye, the corpse of Remus Lupin, and felt nothing in response to the sight. Nor did anything flare in his breast when he saw Poppy Pomfrey, battle-worn and bleeding, forcibly administering a Calming Draught to a student in the midst of a psychotic break. His mind let sound pass over it, and through it, and then, when he had settled into a tiny alcove with a lovely view of the enchanted ceiling, he heard what he must have been listening for. Harry Potter was alive - again.</p><p>    Fury consumed his body, met in equal measure by such bone-aching relief that he collapsed against the wall, sliding down until he was curled at the foot of the statue housed within his hiding spot.</p><p>    Martyr’s tears.</p><p>    Severus had laid there, on the cold stone floor, invisible to everyone in their grief, where he had wept until he had succumbed to exhaustion.</p>
