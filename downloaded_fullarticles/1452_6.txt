    <p class="p1">Harry snapped out of her daze, her cheeks flushed as she was reprimanded. The sharp sounds of angry Russian cut through her daydreams like a well-buttered knife. Lately, it had been getting harder and harder to focus. Her form hadn't yet began to fail her but whispers were passing through the company regarding her preoccupation.</p>
<p class="p1">Unfortunately, there was nothing to be done. Her distraction was inevitable. Dreams plagued her, even in her waking moments. Her mind lost itself to the endless montage that overtook her whenever her eyes dared to close. Even if it was only for a moment.</p>
<p class="p1">A flinch overtook her as her instructor was suddenly in her face. Stray spittle made her flinch once more at the snarled malcontent that she was being confronted with. Sniggers filled the air as she flushed darker.</p>
<p class="p1">"You bumbling imbecile! Why I wasted any time on you, I do not know. If you cannot get your head out of the clouds, what is the use of coming to practice! Again!"</p>
<p class="p1">Harry should be used to this by now, but every time Umbridge yelled at her she flashed back to her childhood. The only thing that had saved her from the horror was her talent, and Umbridge's desire to regain her title as renowned <em>premier maître de ballet. </em>However, Umbridge's faith in her talent was easily lost.</p>
<p class="p1">She had fought hard for her spot as prima ballerina. Harry had had nothing before coming to the Perditis Company; she had been no one. It was her ability to move that had granted her admittance. Her fellow dancers possessed the money and the time to cultivate skill, while she was forced to rely on raw unadulterated passion.</p>
<p class="p1">There were whispers that someday she would be <em>prima ballerina assoluta</em>. The rumors did nothing to redeem her in the eyes of her fellows, instead isolating her.</p>
<p class="p1">Some days she wished she had decided to forgo the company and Umbridge's urging. While she had been saved from an early death, she was still trapped. Only this time, her future was already sold. At least until she messed it up.</p>
<p class="p1">Once more, she flinched as the thin stick with which Umbridge preferred to carry out her perverse sense of judgement slammed against the back of her thighs. Her skin paling as she struggled to breathe. She had earned this with her inattention; she deserved this. After all, she owed Umbridge everything.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead of crying, Harry nodded numbly as the rest of the company was directed to leave.</p>
<p class="p1">Her feet automatically slid into place as Umbridge began to call out positions.</p>
<p class="p1">"Développé, à la seconde, penché, pas de chat, plié, pirouette<span class="s1"><em>...</em></span>"</p>
<p class="p1">Over and over again, her voice growing louder as she called out positions.</p>
<p class="p1">Harry's body ached but she kept pushing. Her form perfect but wavering as fatigue threatened to drag her down. Her desperation to please causing her mind to vanish once more into the ether.</p>
<p class="p1">Green eyes slid closed and she begged the gods for mercy, her body twisting to a melody only she could hear. Umbridge's screeching died out as she lost herself in the movements.</p>
<p class="p1">A tickle of a memory crossed her mind like the careful touch of a practiced lover. The hazy vision of a life she must have lived but didn't quite remember, demanding to be recognized. Her solace came as she continued to spin; the world melting away as she was submerged into another life and another her.</p>
<p class="p1">Time blending with a turn of her legs; toes outstretched as reality disintegrated around her. She was no longer a commoner but a queen. She sat upon a jeweled throne; her back straight and tension radiating through her fingertips.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Her father was bent before her, his eyes downcast. There was a tremble of pride as it was forced down. His knees no doubt aching as she refused to recognize him. A delicate cough curled her lip momentarily before she bid him rise.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>"I beseech you, listen to me daughter. This is not the way. Our people need justice, not war. If you will not reconsider for them, then please, I beg you to think of me as you make your final decision."</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Harry couldn't help the laugh that bubbled forth. Her lips stretched as cruel humor overtook her. </em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>"Daughter? You have no daughter Baron, you sold her like a lame cow at the market. You damned her to a loveless marriage, and a life of attempted assassinations. And for what? A conversation piece to address at balls? How proud you must be for one of your blood to now rest upon the throne." Her voice was cold; condemnation clear in every soft spoken syllable.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>The baron made to speak but she merely raised her hand, "Save your words. My decision has been made and the council already decided. We begin preparations at dawn. Now, I grow weary of this presumption you hold that your opinions matter when it comes to royal affairs. Consequently, I shall have to request we adjourn this facade quickly. Tom~"</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Her companion stepped from the shadows, his head bowing over her hand. Lips caressed her skin with too much familiarity to be anything other than a lover's caress. The manner in which he stood before her father was possessive, demanding recognition for the obvious power he now held.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Suddenly it became clear to Baron Potter the error of his ways. He had bartered his daughter but now another man owned her. After all, the spoils of war always go to the victor.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Tom had been nobody, but not anymore.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Now that the true King was dead, Tom was as good as King. He was the Queen's consort, and the only one to hold her counsel.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>The baron made a choked sound as he realized what the King's passing had caused - or rather what had caused the King's untimely demise.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Still he tried to reach his daughter with logic, "He will ruin you! It is as clear as day, child. He is using you to be King, he will murder you just like he did your husband."</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Harry laughed, allowing Tom to pull her to her feet. "No more than you," she murmured sweetly as her hand curled into the crook of Tom's elbow. "At least with him, there is hope for happiness. With you, there was only death.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>"Go home Baron and kiss your daughter goodnight one last time. Show her how much you love her before you sell her as well.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>"After all, you got your wish. I am Queen of Mai’Laf<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but I will never be your puppet." Her voice echoed behind her as she was lead from the hall. The satin material of her gown the only sound to reach the baron's ears as she let herself be pressed against a wall just out of sight.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Let him hear her pleasure, he was paid well for it. Let him hear the whore he had made. After all, he was her father no more.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Her attention moved to the mouth on her throat and the hand between her thighs.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">Slowly she was pulled out of her vision; the world spinning much like a kaleidoscope as a sense of reality returned.</p>
<p class="p1">Her breath coming in harsh pants as Umbridge nodded her approval.</p>
<p class="p1">"This is what you should give every practice. If not, do not bother coming tomorrow. You are easily replaceable." Her voice was just as harsh as before, the words carrying more venom than a gunshot.</p>
<p class="p1">"Of course, my apologies. I won't make the same mistake again." Harry murmured, her head bowing as her legs trembled. Her muscles threatening to give out as she was forced to continue standing.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally Umbridge left her alone; her body instantly crumpled as she tried to draw in air.</p>
<p class="p1">As Harry laid there, she tried not to dwell on what had just occurred. It wasn't some new phenomena but she still never quite understood why she was having these visions. She might recognize the universe was trying to tell her something but what exactly, she wasn't quite sure.</p>
<p class="p1">If they didn't take over while she slept, they dominated her dancing. Instead of crippling her, they empowered her. Some unknown emotions coming through and granting her access to a power far greater than one she possessed on her own.</p>
<p class="p1">Most of her visions were different but they all centered on the same man. Some mirage of godlike grace and beauty. He was not a good man, that much was clear throughout her visions. Sometimes he was cruel, a dark twisted man who preyed on her innocence for some selfish cause. Despite the malevolence lingering so clearly beneath the surface of ethereal perfection, he was never cruel to her.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead, he treated her with the utmost care. Almost as if she was a delicate flower in need of careful cultivation, his words smooth and well rehearsed as they seduced and confused.</p>
<p class="p1">Her body would bend to his will far more easily and gracefully than it did when she danced. The sense of captivation and desire featured heavily in her dreams. Something about him called to her very soul, demanding her to open her eyes to something much larger than her current existence.</p>
<p class="p1">Harry felt like she had spent her whole life searching for this man. It was as if he was the missing piece to her happiness. From what she got from each new vision was that her life had been meaningless before Tom's appearance.</p>
<p class="p1">Each time, her persona would get twisted and become darker and more easily swayed by his gentle promises.</p>
<p class="p1">It was odd - seeing herself in what was obviously another life. Even stranger was that the visions were crossing over into her waking moments. Harry had never considered herself religious or remotely spiritual but these constant occurrences had to be the work of a higher power. Even if she held some reservations regarding the validity of these waking dreams, or flashbacks, she found herself slowly falling in love.</p>
<p class="p1">Whatever these dreams meant, it seemed that Tom had always been there. If it was to be believed that she was being granted the opportunity to look back and relive her past lives for only a moment…then it was obvious that her fate was twisted around his.</p>
<p class="p1">For he seemed to be eternal, and she the goal sought out in every life. Otherwise, why else would she see them together every time she closed her eyes?</p>
<p class="p1">Why would she feel so powerful at the mere idea of him?</p>
<p class="p1">There was an unnaturalness to these memories, if they could be properly called such, and the heat present within them threatened to drown her. Sometimes, she was a man and he a woman, sometimes they were the same. In every tale she was so utterly enthralled and seduced that it was pathetic.</p>
<p class="p1">Harry couldn't imagine being so captivated by another human being. She had never had the opportunity to feel such warmth as she felt from Tom in these snippets of stolen time.</p>
<p class="p1">Just like now, the memory of his touch lingered on her skin. Hot and needy, and she couldn't help the moan that escaped her. Her eyes were fluttering closed as arousal seemed to energize her once more.</p>
<p class="p1">Her pulse sped up as she found herself sucked into another vision.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>"Harry, look at me."</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Her - no his head shaking as he found himself pinned beneath a much larger body. Harry couldn't remember how he found himself trapped like this. They had been arguing about something that he couldn't remember.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>He didn't even know if he'd thrown the first punch but he had to have otherwise they wouldn’t have gotten here. All he could remember was rage taking over, and hurt. Tom had laughed at him, and easily subdued him as his protest died as soon as Tom's mouth slid over his.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>While he had tried to hurt Tom, Tom had never hit back. Instead forcing him down until his legs were wrapped tight around the larger man's waist. </em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Their pelvises grinded feverishly as Harry tried to bite him. </em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Tom was laughing again, a husky sound that was soft against the heated skin of his neck. </em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Harry would have snapped something rude but his ability to speak was lost as his head was yanked back and teeth dug into his throat.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>A pitiful whine escaped as his hips bucked hard. "Now, now, you need need to be patient or I'll leave you to solve your little problem by yourself."</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Tom's voice was amused, mocking him as if Harry was the only one who was desperately hard and wanting.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>"Please, Tom, touch me~"</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>His pride was pushed away as he let his body go lax beneath his boyfriend. His submission was rewarded instantly as Tom shifted lower. Long fingers rubbed over his crotch as his cock was slowly exposed to the cold air.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>The dark tinge to his cheeks grew even more pronounced as Tom rubbed his knuckles over his leaking cock. A grin twisted over icy features before lips opened for him.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Harry couldn't help but cry out as Tom took him in all the way. His movements slow and practiced as his tongue swirled around Harry’s head before taking him down his throat once more.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Green eyes glazed over, as Tom sucked cock like a dying man desperately clinging to life. His hips were bucking harder as Tom took every harsh push against the back of his throat.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>His orgasm was coming fast. He never could last when Tom took him in his mouth. It so rarely happened that he had no stamina when he did. All it took was a few harsh sucks and Tom's eagerness to take every slam of Harry's hips, and he was lost.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>A sappy smile escaped him as he obediently lifted his hips. His pants were discarded in seconds and his legs fell open even further. He was very aware of how wanton he looked, spread out in such a manner.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Tom was fully dressed, but Harry was bare from the waist down and writhing as he was worked open. His eyes rolled as Tom shoved his fingers even harder into him.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>His teeth dug into his bottom lip as he tried to hold back his desperation. He knew all too well that if he tried to rush Tom, his boyfriend could and would leave him in a heartbeat to reach his end - alone.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>The bastard.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Instead, he dug his fingers into Tom's shoulders and let him play as he saw fit. Another orgasm threatened to overtake him just as Tom finally had enough teasing.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>There was no warning before Tom sank into him. Pushing into him with one rough thrust.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Harry arched violently as Tom immediately set a fast pace. While the blowjob had been for Harry's pleasure, this was all for Tom's. And Harry delighted in it.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>He was being used. His cock leaking precum as it smacked into his stomach. Tom's hands were on either side of his head as he fucked into him in hard strokes.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>There was no affection in Tom's movements. He might never hit Harry, but he would fuck his lights out until he couldn't walk. He would keep fucking until Harry begged him to stop, and then continue. There was no forgiveness or mercy in his thrusts, only a need to come.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>And Harry was living for it. His voice cracking as his pleasure built and crashed over him.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Tom of course, showed no sign of stopping. Instead Harry's nails dug into Tom's back as Tom continued to work him over. His body writhing as the pleasure quickly became too much.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Another pathetic whine escaping him as he was forced into another orgasm, "Please Tom, please~" he begged.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Harry didn't really know what he was begging for but he couldn't help but try to press himself closer to Tom. The struggle to keep his eyes open grew harder as a familiar darkness threatened to pull him under.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>His desire to resist its pull grew weaker as Tom showed no signs of stopping. With a weak cry, his cock jerked weakly as cum stained his shirt, his vision blurring as he finally succumbed.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Harry came to as Tom pulled away from him. He couldn't even find the energy to be embarrassed as he felt cum drip down his thigh and Tom stared smugly down at him.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>A lazy smile crossed his lips as he continued to watch Tom's face, "Mhm, I love it when you're mad at me," he whispered.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>Tom laughed lowly, shaking his head. His fingers slid into Harry's as he pulled Harry's hand to his mouth. His tongue flicked slowly over a bruised knuckle before laying a small sucking kiss to the hand that had blackened his eye, "And I, you."</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">Harry came to with a gasp, her back arching as her body reacted the memory. This time the tremble in her muscles was directly related to the wetness between her legs.</p>
<p class="p1">A trembling hand moved to touch herself as she squeezed her eyes closed. She was desperate for more; she craved Tom in a way that both terrified her and made her feel alive.</p>
<p class="p1">With every dream, he was drawing nearer. She could feel it.</p>
<p class="p1">And as she came, she moaned his name.</p>
<p class="p1">Tom was coming for her.</p>
