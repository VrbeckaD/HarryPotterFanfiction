          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Hermione?” Harry’s eyes followed her form around the small back garden of Grimmauld Place. She wrung her hands in front of her in an attempt to keep them out of her hair.</p>
<p>“What if something happens?”</p>
<p>He reached out his hand and pulled her toward him, her feet bumping into his. “Like what? Falling even more in love with you?”</p>
<p>“Harry, it’s you and me. How could it ever work?”</p>
<p>He set his hands on her upper arms. “How can it not? Why are you so adamant on not trying it out?”</p>
<p>“But, what if we end up fighting and hating each other or something?” Her hands gripped his shirt.</p>
<p>“Couples fight, Hermione. I don’t think I could ever hate you. What makes you think that?” He brushed away a lock of hair from her face, leaned down and kissed the curve of her cheek. “Why don’t we just give it a shot? Let’s not think about our past relationships and who they happened to be with. It’s just you and me and how we feel about each other.”</p>
<p>“You and me?” She stood on her tip-toes.</p>
<p>His thumb traced over her lower lip. “You and me.”</p></div>
