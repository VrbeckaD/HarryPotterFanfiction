    <p>It was a beautiful summer day in Surrey. The sky was clear, the trees in the park were swaying to the soft breeze. Lush green, freshly cut grass along with the faint fragrance of blossoming flowers, and the mellow sound of chirping birds created an overall relaxing atmosphere.</p>
<p>Harry was sitting on a bench in the park, tapping his fingers against his knees, impatiently waiting for his godfather. It was a nice day that day. In fact, it was the best! And that meant something since he had had many amazing days this summer. Reason? Sirius.</p>
<p>Two days after summer had started, Harry received a letter from Sirius, telling him that he’ll be there in no time if Harry ever needed him for anything. Harry was rather touched by the gesture, seeing as he didn’t have many adults in his life who were actually concerned about him. And none who would care enough to leave everything for him and come to his rescue without a second thought. Even if Mr. and Mrs. Weasley cared for him and had practically taken him into their family, still, they weren’t…his, and he wasn’t theirs. No matter how close they were, he will never be their son. And who was to say that if tomorrow, Harry makes a terrible mistake, they would still love him? Sirius, however, was his godfather, his only real family, and it was something that won’t change. EVER. That realization made Harry feel giddy with happiness, even after two months of his reunion with his godfather.</p>
<p>And so, Harry immediately sent a reply to Sirius, suggesting that—if Sirius wants to—they could spend time together in the park near no. 4. He could easily change to his animagus form if there was any threat of recognition, making it seem like an everyday person taking his dog for a walk.</p>
<p>Harry was hesitant in the beginning about making such a request, afraid that he would be denied or that Sirius won’t be able to make it unnoticed, or worse — that Sirius didn’t want to spend time with him. But eventually, he managed to gather his Gryffindor courage and asked Sirius to visit him because he really wanted to get to know his godfather. And Sirius, always the adventurous man that he was, was ready to take the risk and was thrilled with the idea of spending time with his Prongslet.</p>
<p>Thus, the time and date were decided, and three days later Harry met Padfoot in the park for their ‘walk’. Since then, they had been meeting almost every day.</p>
<p>Harry’s summer was filled with long walks in the nearby muggle town and talking to Sirius about the adventures of the Marauders while eating the leftovers sent to them by Mrs. Weasley or the takeaways Sirius brought along with him from various muggle shops.</p>
<p>Apparently, Gringotts didn’t care if you were a criminal. If a wizard was taking money from their own vaults and not creating disturbance in the bank, they wouldn’t turn them in if they didn’t step into the bank. Sirius still had access to his personal vaults, even if the Black vaults were frozen, so he could easily ask for money from there through owl, and Hedwig was always happy to help him. </p>
<p>The first thing he did with his money, much to Harry’s protest, was to buy him new clothes that fit. Harry would never have imagined Sirius to be a vain person. But he was. And it increased tenfold when it came to shopping for his godson. They spent two sodding days, two extremely tiring and annoying days, fishing through the most expensive muggle stores for the most fashionable clothes—including casuals, semi-formals, formals, night wears, and, much to Harry’s embarrassment, undergarments—, matching shoes for all occasions, ties and other accessories, bags, hair care, and whatnot. It didn’t end there though. The next day, Sirius dragged Harry through the entire posh section of the Diagon Alley, all the while wagging that sodding furry tail of his, to buy wizard robes and cloaks—again, including casual, formal and semi-formal—, all sorts of dragonhide boots and dress shoes because, according to him, Harry must look equally hot in wizarding outfits. That bastard. And when Harry thought the torture was finally over, Sirius insisted on buying leather outfits because a teenager needs to have proper outfits for wild parties.</p>
<p>When Harry’s protests grew with the increasing bills—because he really didn’t want Sirius to pay when he himself could—Sirius asked, “Would you have stopped James from paying?” And when Harry didn’t have an answer to that, he simply said, “I am not doing anything which I wouldn’t do for my son,” which shut Harry up. He didn’t know what to say to that because, in a way, Sirius had just called him his son. He forgot all his protests about shopping and bills because he was busy grinning like a loon the whole day. His heart was filled with so much happiness from the fact that Sirius so casually regarded him as his son, as if it was the most natural thing in the world, that Harry didn’t even make a fuss when he was taken for a haircut, or when he was pushed into St. Mungo's (because you can’t take a dog in a hospital) for getting his eyes fixed. The next week actually went by in a haze. All Harry could think about was Sirius calling him his son and actually loving him like one. He had to bite his tongue on several occasions to keep himself from calling Sirius ‘Dad’ because he really didn’t know how Sirius would react to the title.</p>
<p>Apart from talking, eating, and wandering around through muggle streets on Sirius’ newly repaired bike, which looked even better than it originally did (courtesy of Remus John Lupin, the man was a genius), they wrote letters to Moony, who couldn’t visit them more than a couple of times because the ministry was keeping a watch on him, hoping to catch Sirius. Moony’s replies were as enthusiastic as ever, although still written in a very polite and calm tone. How he managed to accommodate such opposing emotions in a letter, was beyond the dark-haired pair. Although, it was always amusing to watch Sirius cower and flinch away from the letters when Remus expressed his disapproval, in rather creative ways, about certain things that Sirius insisted on teaching Harry (which were the accounts of seven detailed volumes of ‘Marauders through the ages—An expert guide for pranksters, complete with step by step instructions and necessary spells), not that it stopped Sirius from telling him all the tips and secrets, mind you. However, it was not funny at all when it was Harry’s turn to be grilled by Remus. The wolf’s talent of sounding dangerous with such polite words, in a sodding letter, was scary, very scary. And Sirius never failed to laugh at Harry and rub it in his face.</p>
<p>Harry and Sirius actually gambled on who was going to get it worse in the next letter, when they did something which Remus would clearly disapprove of, and then bet again on when Remus would find out about them gambling on him, and then again bet on who would have it worse once he did find out. The whole thing was rather ridiculous, but Harry wouldn’t want it any other way.</p>
<p>It was not only fun and games though. When Harry and Sirius had met Remus for the first time, in the second week of summer, to get Sirius’ bike from him, Harry had made the mistake of confessing that Remus was the best DADA teacher Harry had ever had and asked for his help with the subject. Remus had spluttered and blushed furiously, but once he got over his shock, he made it a personal mission to make his honorary godson ace DADA.</p>
<p>And since then, his letters were accompanied by books and notes. Harry had to send his homework to Remus to get it checked, and Remus was far more thorough about the subject when it came to teaching his godson.</p>
<p>As if all of this was not enough, Sirius started helping Harry with his transfiguration and charms homework when asked, and then went on to giving him extra training too, along with making him practice the spells mentioned in Remus’ notes, and also with his (Sirius’) own wand when Harry had tried to weasel his way out of extra work by mentioning the trace.</p>
<p>Harry knew that Remus was the studious mastermind of the Marauders, but he shouldn’t have underestimated Sirius when it came to academic excellence. After all, he had finished all his NEWTs with Os and Es and became an animagus at the age of 14, which was something many aged and powerful wizards failed to accomplish, and then went on to becoming an Auror, all the while playing pranks on the whole school and being rebellious, with a war hanging over his head.</p>
<p>However, Harry wasn’t complaining. Lessons with Sirius were damn funny and didn’t feel like studying at all, and Remus’ notes were so thorough and easy to understand that Harry had already mastered some of the most difficult theories and concepts of his curriculum. His spell casting and aim had also improved with his newly obtained eyesight and Sirius breathing down his neck. He already knew many tricks that Aurors used. His homework was completed and checked thoroughly by both Remus and Sirius (with lots of good-natured insults from Sirius). His knowledge and spellwork in DADA, charms, and transfiguration had improved by a few notches, and he felt far more confident about his magical abilities. He was already ahead in his curriculum, and his grades were surely going to rise substantially in the coming year. All in all, it had been the most productive summer, and Harry felt like his head would explode from all the knowledge he had gathered in such a short time (not that it was difficult to keep it all in; his understanding of the basic theories through Remus’ notes had made remembering everything far easier than otherwise possible).</p>
<p>But no matter how exhausted Harry got after a long day—which started with a morning run (Sirius’ suggestion to improve his magical stamina and strength), followed by his morning ritual, a light breakfast, a few chores, then lunch, which was followed by four to five hours with Sirius until dinner, after which Harry spent two hours going through Remus’ books and notes, and revising whatever he had learned from his godfather, before going to bed—Harry was bloody happy. For the first time he had someone who reprimanded him when he did something wrong, corrected his mistakes without getting angry, listened to his problems, helped and checked his homework, pat him on the back when he had done a spell right, squeezed his shoulders and reassured him when he felt hopeless, expected things from him, not things like saving the world, but simple things like winning a Quidditch match or finishing his assigned work etc. For the first time, he had someone who could be proud of him, and if all this meant that he had to work hard, train well, learn more, then he would do it. And it was not like Sirius and Remus were burdening him with things beyond his control; they were helping him with his studies, supporting him with his work, cheering him up with their jokes, bribing him with takeaways, bike rides, and ice cream. And if all this meant feeling a bit exhausted at night, but not enough to ache, just enough to have a nice sleep, then be it. He would work his arse off to see Sirius and Remus smiling proudly at him. He finally had someone who loved him, dammit. His own little family of three. He’ll do it because, at the end of the day, when Harry was about to close his eyes, everything paled in comparison to the happiness and pure affection he felt for his two guardians in his heart and the broad smile that was plastered across his face all the time.</p>
<p>Speaking of a family of three, the Dursleys had not bothered Harry this summer, at all. They were scared shitless by the fact that Harry had a mass murderer and a wolf as his godfathers, and Harry hadn’t bothered to tell them that Sirius was innocent or that Remus only became a wolf once a month and was harmless otherwise. The fact that Harry had started using a bit of wandless magic, which was untraceable, left them in cold sweat, and Harry exploited his new skills at every chance he got. It was just too amusing to watch aunt Petunia gasp in horror, Dudley flinch every time when Harry’s fingers twitched, and uncle Vernon go purple with rage but not being able to do anything more than grunt. They stopped giving him chores, thinking that he would use magic while making food or cleaning their house. Uncle Vernon stopped raising his hand or manhandling Harry after he had sent a wandless tripping jinx his way after one such episode. He couldn’t even lock Harry in anymore because Sirius would barge into the house looking for him, out of pure worry, if he was late or missed their meeting. Dudley and his minions had stopped entering the park altogether. They had to remove the bars from his window too because they knew Remus sent him letters (Hedwig was really happy with the freedom). All Harry had to do was clean his own room, make his own breakfast and clean after it, and wash his clothes, which Dobby was just too happy to do for him since he was in no mood to ruin his outrageously expensive clothes. Vernon almost had a heart attack when he saw his new clothes, and Dudley still went red with jealousy. Harry couldn’t help but laugh in the privacy of his own room.</p>
<p>Harry still hadn’t said anything to Sirius about his life for the last twelve years with the Dursleys. He was sure that if Sirius found out that Harry had been neglected and abused all these years, he would surely become a murderer and put himself in Azkaban. For now, Sirius only thought that the neglect stopped at the clothes and other such luxuries. Because when Harry met him at the end of the third year, he had been at Hogwarts and eating well. He only had to manage a week on scrapes this summer, which he was easily able to hide from Sirius, before their meetings started, and the Dursleys were forced to let him eat breakfast and dinner as much as he wanted (he only had a light lunch because he mostly ate takeaways with Sirius after that).</p>
<p>Harry had told Sirius a carefully censored version of his life, completely omitting his childhood, although he was sure that Remus suspected it, but had said nothing apart from giving him pointed looks as if saying that if Harry didn’t tell him the truth soon then he would go all wolf on him. He also tried to gloss over his adventures of first and second year but to no avail. Since Remus had found out enough about what happened with Harry before he became the DADA professor from his head of house, he had no qualmns about telling Sirius all that. Although Sirius had laughed about the flying car incident and his fight with the troll, he wasn’t that thrilled about the Basilisk and the philosopher’s stone.</p>
<p>Harry had been given strict instructions about telling Sirius or Remus if anything happened, no matter what it was, how small the matter was, if it was weird or out of sorts or didn’t feel right, then he was supposed to owl them. After Harry’s account of Hogwarts, both men had lost their trust in Dumbledore and had warned Harry to be as vigilant as he can, and Sirius had become even more anxious to get Harry’s custody so that he could easily come to him if something happened.</p>
<p>Although both his guardians had waved off his concerns about his recent nightmares regarding Wormtail and Voldemort, Harry didn’t fail to notice that Sirius had started grilling him about his spellwork, wandless magic and auror tactics on vigilance, while Remus kept on reminding him to tell them if something happened, and the books accompanying his letters became thicker.<br/>
He knew that hoping for a peaceful year was as farfetched as uncle Vernon growing a six-pack. But Harry wasn’t as bothered as he used to be with such things. He was more confident in his abilities to defend himself now, than he was in the previous years. What with him spending almost five hours learning stuff every day for the last two months? It was not like he was not anxious or scared of what surprises the coming year would bring with it. But the fact that both Sirius and Remus were ready to bite—quite literally— anyone who so much as touched their pup’s hair, put Harry’s mind at ease.</p>
<p>In short, the three had become a family in all but blood in the last two months. The only thing Harry hadn’t told them was about the Dursleys and him almost getting sorted into Slytherin. And Harry would keep that a secret for as long as he could.</p>
<p>Speaking of secrets, Harry was sure that Sirius was hiding something. He had never said much about his family, apart from them being ancient, pureblood, and associated with dark arts and being close followers of Voldie.</p>
<p>Harry always got the feeling that Sirius didn’t have a colorful childhood, although Harry always cut that train of thought. Thinking about Sirius suffering in any way, made Harry’s heart ache, and he would rather avoid the pain until he was sure of his assumptions.</p>
<p>It was really confusing though. It was as if Sirius was proud of his family but not his family members. He had already told him a lot about pureblood customs and family history. And would teach him more about his duties as the lord of the Potter family, as a member of the Wizengamot, and how to handle his legal and financial issues later, when he would be about to come of age and would have to attain his lordship.</p>
<p>Apparently, Harry was the sole heir of one of the wealthiest families of wizarding Britain, and would also take over the Black fortune after Sirius. Harry was shocked to know that the vault he had seen in his first year, which was enough to last a lifetime, was secured only for his school supplies during an emergency and was only a drop in the ocean of the Potter fortune, and the same went for the Black fortune. However, he could take over these when he turned 17. He couldn’t access his properties and vaults yet since they were sealed until the next lord took over, and Sirius couldn’t locate the properties due to ancient wards. As far as the Black vaults and properties were concerned, they were frozen until Sirius was proven innocent.<br/>
All this meant that he had a LOT more to learn in the coming summers. He was just glad that he wouldn’t turn into some bigoted pompous fool since Sirius wouldn’t let that happen. But Harry would have preferred driving lessons for riding Sirius’ bike than lessons in history and politics.</p>
<p>His thoughts were interrupted when he caught movement from the corner of his eyes.</p>
<p>He whirled around with lightning speed, wand raised, jaw set, eyes alert, and a curse on his lips, only to be tackled to the ground by a huge furball. Said furball was wagging its tail madly and was licking his face and drooling all over his shirt. Harry couldn’t help but laugh at his godfather’s antics and his special way of greeting him.</p>
<p>With much effort, he finally managed to stop Padfoot’s assault and sit up. Face flushed, hair disheveled, breathing hard, and still trying to stifle his laughter.</p>
<p>Padfoot turned back to Sirius and sat cross-legged in front of him on the grass. He had a wide grin on his face and his eyes were dancing with mirth.</p>
<p>“Where is Remus?” Harry asked, looking around for any sign of the wolf. “He promised to meet us today.”</p>
<p>“He’ll be here any minute now,” Sirius replied, while he busied himself with taking out and enlarging the takeaway boxes to their normal size. “Had to make sure that Aurors can’t follow him.”</p>
<p>Not soon after the words had left Sirius’ mouth, they heard the crack of apparition. They turned their heads to see Remus walking towards them. He smiled at them when he was close enough while pocketing his wand.</p>
<p>“Hey pup,” he gave Harry a warm smile and ruffled his hair. Once he was settled down as well, he gave him an expectant look. “What was the good news you wanted to tell us?”</p>
<p>At this, Sirius looked up from where he had just finished arranging the takeaway boxes and raised a questioning eyebrow.</p>
<p>Harry’s face lit up, and he could feel himself bouncing a little in excitement.<br/>
His mood had his godfathers sharing suspicious looks, so he decided to finally break the news before they could conclude that Harry had gotten himself into trouble. Again.</p>
<p>“I’m going to the Quidditch World Cup!” he tried and failed to conceal the look of absolute joy that spread across his face. “Mr. Weasley managed to get some tickets through his connections in the ministry, and I am invited to join them. Ron sent a letter yesterday. I think Hermione is joining us too!”</p>
<p>“That’s great, pup!” Sirius exclaimed, and Remus nodded in agreement. “Good that I got today’s takeaway from your favorite place then,” Sirius said while handing him a box of noodles. “This calls for a little celebration!”</p>
<p>The three of them dug into their meals, and a comfortable silence fell upon them which was only broken by small talk about random day-to-day stuff.</p>
<p>It was only after they were done eating, and the empty packages were vanished, that both men gave Harry a look, and he immediately realized that Remus had gone into professor mode and Sirius was about to go all Auror on him.</p>
<p>It was times like these that reminded him that he had managed to find himself guardians who were a bit—okay, a lot—more protective than normal parents, and that he was dealing with an Alpha Werewolf and a former Auror, who had managed to stay sane through twelve years in Azkaban and escape from it relatively unscathed.</p>
<p>“So,” Remus started, “how is your training regarding wandless magic going?”</p>
<p>Harry tilted his head and gave them a cocky smile, which had Remus’ eyebrows shooting up in challenge and Sirius frown in confusion.</p>
<p>Harry closed his eyes and concentrated hard on controlling his magic. A few minutes later he heard Remus take a sharp breath and Sirius gasp and knew that he had succeeded in a nonverbal, wandless warming charm, without even lifting a finger.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes and cocked an eyebrow—a habit he had picked up from Sirius—at the god smacked expressions on his godfathers’ faces. Remus’ eyes had turned as wide as saucers, and Sirius was spluttering like a fish. Harry was rather pleased with their reactions.</p>
<p>Remus was the first one to compose himself and managed to croak out a feeble, “How?”</p>
<p>Harry gave them a crooked smile but soon turned sober as he tried to sort out his thoughts and find the right words to explain his little experiment. Sirius had managed to stop spluttering but was still speechless when Harry started. “The book that Remus gave me about the magical theory behind performing magic explained that I needed to imagine my magical core—just like Sirius tells me to do during my animagus training—and feel my magic flow through my wand hand while thinking of the incantation in my mind to perform the spell. Am I correct?”<br/>
When Remus simply nodded, still in shock, he continued, “It just occurred to me that the book simply said to use our wand hand but didn’t specify anything else. Which means that one can channel their magical flow through either hand since there are both left- and right-handed wizards. So I tried focusing my magical flow through my left hand too. It took longer and did result in a few accidents, but it finally worked. I think those few people who have managed to master wandless magic never bothered with their non-wand hand. And maybe, it’s because we are so used to having our magic flow through our wand-hand that it’s easier to do wandless magic with it instead of doing it with our other hand. It’s similar to our writing habits, you see.</p>
<p>“Which got me thinking that there are people who can write with both hands, and so I tried the same with my magic, and it worked! Although it still takes a tad bit more effort, I think it’s a matter of practice,” Harry finished.</p>
<p>“But…but…you didn’t…I mean—,” Sirius tried.</p>
<p>“Raise your hand,” Remus finished, and Sirius nodded furiously.</p>
<p>“It’s the same thing, you see. The concept remains the same. I just let my magic flow through my entire body so that I can release it from my body itself instead of just my arms. It’s more like…how could I explain? Accidental magic? Yes. Only more controlled and conscious.” He bit his lip and waited for both men to say something. He didn’t know if he made any sense, but he had tried his best to explain it in words.</p>
<p>Their expressions weren’t giving anything away, though. And Harry was getting more nervous as the minutes passed. He anxiously ran his fingers through his hair, thinking that he had made a fool of himself and was cursing himself for being so cocky in the beginning. He was still looking down at his lap when Sirius’ voice broke through his dark thoughts.</p>
<p>“Wow,” he breathed, a dazed expression on his face. “I think it’s just…just—,”</p>
<p>“Amazing!” Remus gushed. “That’s amazing, Harry!” he repeated, and Harry realized that Remus was impressed and awed and proud and excited, all at the same time. And Sirius was no better. Harry turned to face Sirius, who had finally managed to get his bearings enough to string a sentence.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t that magically exhaust you though?” Sirius said, frowning. “I know you are powerful enough to spread your magic throughout your body and use it and still manage to stay upright for a long time. But wouldn’t that be too risky? I mean…what if the amount of magic you release is far more than you intended to, and you exhaust yourself, or it goes wild, or,” Sirius gulped, “does far more damage than intended. And…no offense, Harry, but…magic as powerful as yours can be disastrous if gone wild.”</p>
<p>Harry looked at Remus to see the same concern etched on his face and gave both men a reassuring smile. “I know those things can happen, and that’s why I had to concentrate so much. I mean…to control the magical flow, that is. It’s tiring anyway. I have only tried this twice, and I can already feel a dull headache. Ensuring that my control is perfect takes a lot out of my little head. So don’t worry,” he waved off their concerns, “I will practice it only when it’s safe and won’t use it until it’s an emergency. Okay?”</p>
<p>Both men didn’t look convinced, but after a shared eye-to-eye conversation (Harry hated it when they did that, it made him feel like a kid) they finally decided to drop it.</p>
<p>“I need to tell you something,” Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck nervously. “It’s not something bad,” he added hastily when he caught the worried looks both canines were sending his way. “In fact, it’s something good, really,” he tried to reassure them.</p>
<p>“After what you just showed us,” said Remus skeptically, “I’m not sure if I even want to understand your definition of ‘something good’.”</p>
<p>Sirius looked amusedly at Remus’ expression, and Harry couldn’t really blame him. Remus was looking at Harry as if expecting him to say that he had killed Voldemort and wanted suggestions on where to hide his body.</p>
<p>Harry shook his head, amused by the fact that they immediately expected the worst. Was he really so prone to trouble? Yes. Yes, he was. He shook his head again to get back to the present. “I felt my animagus form yesterday,” he stated, “and I need your help to identify it.”</p>
<p>“What?!” Sirius’ jaw dropped. “But you only started last week! It’s…I mean…it takes at least a month!”</p>
<p>Remus shook his head and sighed deeply, “Honestly, why am I not even surprised?”</p>
<p>“Oi! Are you going to help me or not?”</p>
<p>That snapped Sirius out of his haze, and he rubbed his hands together in glee, “Come on pup. Spill it. Now!” he commanded impatiently. He was so thrilled with the idea, it was as if he himself was the one who was about to transform for the first time and not Harry.</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath and tried to remember the feelings he had experienced when he had managed to understand the nature of his magical core. “I felt warm, but my surroundings were cold.” He started slowly, trying to be as eloquent as possible. “It was night time, and I could smell trees, like in a forest. And I felt large, maybe around 5 feet or something when I was on all fours, and even taller when I was standing on my hind legs. And I am sure I felt thick fur on my body,” he paused before continuing, not sure if he should tell them this part or not, but decided to go ahead anyway, “I was running. And not simply running from a predator but…I was running towards something…or someone,” Harry blushed furiously at this part and mumbled something incoherent which both adults didn’t catch.</p>
<p>Sirius frowned, not sure what to make of his pup’s behavior.</p>
<p>Remus, always the epitome of patience, gently squeezed Harry’s shoulder and said softly, “Harry? You know you can tell us anything, don’t you?” Harry nodded mutely, not meeting his eyes. “And we won’t judge you?” again a mute nod. “And we won’t leave you,” another nod. “And, whatever your form is, we won’t think any less of you.”</p>
<p>Harry finally looked at him with wide open eyes, which had so many emotions going through them. Happiness, love, relief, gratitude. He took a deep breath and nodded, showing that he was okay. “I was running towards you,” Harry blushed again, but forced himself to keep his voice even, “I mean…you, and Sirius…and Hermione…,” he trailed off when he saw the unreadable expression on Remus’ face.</p>
<p>Remus’ eyebrows had shot up into his hairline, and Harry was sure he had recognized his Animagus form.</p>
<p>Sirius’ brows were wrinkled in concentration. Probably going through a list of potential animals, Harry thought. He saw the exact moment when the puzzle pieces finally clicked in Sirius’ head, and his eyes went wide before he burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Harry scowled. This really was getting frustrating. He didn’t know whether he should celebrate or give up on the whole sodding thing. A laughing Sirius could mean anything. It could mean that his form was really good. Or it could mean that his form was so funny that Sirius was having a laughing fit over it. And the fact that Remus only cocked an amused eyebrow at him wasn’t helping AT ALL.</p>
<p>Harry crossed his arms over his chest and scowled. “Well?” he asked, in the perfect imitation of Remus when he was in his I-won’t-take-your-shit-anymore mood, but it only made Sirius laugh harder.</p>
<p>“Oh, Merlin! This is priceless!” Sirius said, trying to stifle his laughter while wiping tears of mirth from his eyes. He turned to Remus with wide, mischievous eyes and shouted, “Our pup is actually going to be a pup, Remus! A PUP!”</p>
<p>“Oi! I said I was huge.” Harry pouted.</p>
<p>Remus chuckled, “Your form is a wolf, Harry.”</p>
<p>“What?” Harry uncrossed his arms and asked, “You mean a wolf wolf?”</p>
<p>“YES!” Sirius laughed, and Remus nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Now even Harry couldn’t help but find the whole thing hilarious. He would turn into a puppy, quite literally, at least until his form grew completely. And Remus and Sirius were both large canines, who referred to him as their pup. And then he went on to imitate the werewolf.</p>
<p>Well, he thought, they were a family even in their animagus forms. And the realization made Harry smile. He just found a new incentive to complete his transformation as soon as possible.<br/>
He was brought out of his musing when Remus suddenly got up after he checked the time. “I am afraid I have to say goodbye now,” he said with a rueful smile.</p>
<p>“Did you bring it?” Sirius asked while getting up and absently helping Harry on his own feet.</p>
<p>Remus nodded and handed him a small parcel. He then moved forward and gave Sirius a tight hug, who returned the gesture just as fiercely while rubbing his hands on Remus’ back in soothing circles. “See you soon, Pads,” he said, “Write to me when we can meet again, yeah?”</p>
<p>Sirius nodded against the werewolf’s shoulder before reluctantly letting go. And Harry noticed that the pureblood’s grey eyes had gone suspiciously wet.</p>
<p>Then Remus turned to face Harry, who looked down at his shoes while awkwardly shuffling from foot to foot.</p>
<p>Harry didn’t know what to do. Remus wasn’t a touchy person and expressed his emotions in more reserved ways (except for when it came to Sirius). He wasn’t a bear hug giving, outright laughing, back patting type of a person—that was Sirius. No. Remus was more of a shoulder squeezing, warmly smiling, and hair ruffling type.</p>
<p>But all that seemed really…less important, considering, that it will be the last time he would see the hazel-eyed man before going back to school, and the thought made his chest feel tight all of a sudden. He wondered, for the first time, if this was how his friends felt when they left for school after every summer, or if it was just him.</p>
<p>Harry’s mental debate came to an abrupt halt when he felt strong arms envelop him in a warm hug. He breathed in the calming scent of tea, old books, and fresh parchment which was Remus, and smiled against the soft fabric of his robes. He gingerly wrapped his arms around the older man and felt a tight knot uncoil in his chest when he wasn’t pushed away immediately.</p>
<p>After a few moments, Remus gently pulled Harry at arm’s length and squeezed his shoulders. With one last smile to him and Sirius, he turned and disapparated with a crack.</p>
<p>Harry and Sirius just stood there silently for a few minutes, lost in their own thoughts, when Sirius cleared his throat and held out the package to Harry. When Harry raised an eyebrow, he simply pushed the package into his hands and looked away, not meeting his godson’s eyes.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Harry asked, looking at the package suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Just a late birthday present,” Sirius said, dismissively, while burying his hands in his pockets, looking at everything, but Harry.</p>
<p>“But, you already—!” he started but was cut off when Sirius held up his hand.</p>
<p>“Just take it Harry.” he said firmly, in a voice that clearly left no space for arguments, “It’s something you would need.”</p>
<p>Harry frowned but didn’t argue any further. Sirius rarely went…serious on Harry, and he wasn’t about to be disrespectful to his godfather. He opened the package and found a beautifully wrapped box inside it. He carefully took the box out and held it in his hands. It was a rectangular box, roughly the size of his palm—in terms of both, length and width—, and only about one to two inches in height. It was wrapped in a shiny silver wrapper and had a bow, made out of a soft black material, over it.</p>
<p>He gingerly unwrapped the box and opened it to reveal a wallet. Harry stared at it, wide-eyed; it wasn’t a regular wallet, he was sure of it.</p>
<p>He lightly brushed his hands over the leathery surface of the wallet and simply felt it beneath his fingers. It was made of dark blue leather, almost black. But the look was extremely unique. It was as if the initial color of the material was similar to that of an Occamy. He looked closer and gasped. It was Occamy skin, a creature which was extremely rare. And not just that, it was polished with a layer of something else, which made its shade turn dark, almost black, that showed silver under the sunlight, but still managed to sustain the original dark turquoise blue color of Occamy leather. It was the most amazing leather he had ever seen. Its color shifted from jet black with a silver shine to the dark turquoise blue of the Pacific Ocean when seen from different angles and under different light. There were no designs on the exterior of the wallet except for the small logo of the head of a stag—complete with delicately carved antlers—made out of pure silver (probably the kind obtained from Occamy eggs), attached at the bottom right side, on the front flap of the wallet. It was just like his father’s Patronus. Just under the logo, written with the same pure silver metal, were the initials of his name—H.J.P. The edges of the wallet were coated with the same metal, giving it a classy look. The thing was a black beauty. Everything in it spoke of money and magic.</p>
<p>“Sirius, this is—,” he couldn’t even finish. Because he really didn’t have anything to say. He was struck dumb by what he was holding in his hands and couldn’t take his eyes off it.</p>
<p>“It’s a wizarding wallet,” Sirius explained, “It was used when Gringotts was newly opened centuries ago. So only the ancient families can get one made for themselves. However, these aren’t used anymore since not many can afford them. They always look like an ordinary flip wallet from outside, but their inner pockets and flaps increase according to your needs. They are custom-made and are integrated with a wizard’s magical signature, which means, apart from you, no one can remove its content. Anything inside this,” he continued, pointing at the wallet, “cannot be damaged, no matter what. They cannot be stolen, because they always follow the magical signature. Distance, wards, locks, nothing can stop it from appearing next to you within two weeks of it going missing, maximum. They are goblin-made and thus have a lifetime guarantee. Of course, many people sell various types of wizarding wallets, but this one is an authentic piece. It’s basically an antique heirloom. I hope I don’t need to spell out that you need to be careful with it,” Sirius warned, giving Harry a stern look. “Not that anything can happen to it. And goblins are obliged to repair or replace it since it’s a matter of their reputation. However, it’s a matter of respect and responsibility.”</p>
<p>Harry gulped. The fact that he was holding a priceless heirloom was a bit overwhelming. And he really couldn’t accept something like this from Sirius. But he didn’t want to seem like he was running away from a responsibility. And Sirius has made it quite clear that it was his, period. It will follow him and is nothing but a showpiece for anyone else.</p>
<p>“It was made on the orders of your grandfather,” Sirius continued, “It’s an old tradition, you see. Where the newborn heir is presented with something valuable from the lord of the family. The heir is supposed to protect it and pass it on to the next generation. It was both, a mark of the family’s prestige and a lesson of respect and responsibility towards the family. James was presented with the invisibility cloak, the most ancient heirloom in your family, which he passed on to you, while you were presented with this. It was to be handed to you by James or your grandfather, once you become old enough to handle it. However, since they didn’t…,” he trailed off. “Anyway, I was given its activation spell as your godfather. And my magic was authorized by James to enable me to give it to you when the time comes,” he finished.</p>
<p>“Oh!” was all Harry managed to breathe. The whole thing was too much to grasp at once. The importance of the present and the sentiments behind it were still sinking in. He looked at the wallet in a new light. It was a gift from his grandfather. A mark of his heritage. A connection to his lost family. He didn’t know what to say and was speechless when he looked up at Sirius with bright green eyes.</p>
<p>“My gift is already inside it,” Sirius said, “It’s a magical money card and is connected to my vault…No…let me finish. It’s for your monthly allowance. Was Remus’ idea, said I need to act more like a responsible guardian and ensure that I don’t spoil you. Not that it will ever happen, duh. Anyway, every month I’ll transfer only a fixed amount into that card. Whether you spend it in one day or choose to save it, is up to you. However, I trust you to not take money from your own vault till…no listen first…it’s to keep your spending habits in check. As a guardian it’s my duty to ensure that you don’t depend too much on your inherited vaults and slack off from making actual efforts. Am I clear?” He finished, giving Harry a stern look.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Harry said in his most sincere voice. Although it was weird to see Sirius going into the responsible father mode, it still felt good to know that Sirius was being strict where it was actually needed. In a way, it made him seem more like a father figure who would love him but also keep him on track. It made Harry feel safe, knowing that Sirius was making an effort to become responsible for his sake.</p>
<p>“I have put our photos in it,” Sirius said, pointing in the general direction of the wallet. He averted his eyes from Harry’s, who realized with a start that Sirius was nervous. “All of us…,” he continued, looking flustered, still avoiding Harry’s eyes, “James, Lily, Remus and…me…you can remove the ones you don’t want…obviously…” he continued to ramble. “I just thought that you would…you know—”</p>
<p>Harry cut Sirius off by jumping on him and squeezing him in a tight hug. He buried his face in Sirius’ chest and was instantly surrounded by the scent of ash and soil after the first rain. He felt Sirius resting his chin on his head; his arms coming up to hug him back just as tightly, as he patted Harry's back and gently rocked him back and forth like a precious baby.</p>
<p>“It’s time for me to go, pup,” Sirius whispered, softly, but did not make any effort to move from his position. Harry just hugged his godfather tighter and buried his face deeper into his robes, if that was even possible.</p>
<p>Sirius chuckled, but it sounded a bit watery, “write to us whenever you can, and don’t forget to place your bets, yeah.”</p>
<p>Harry tried to smile, but it suddenly became difficult. His chest felt tight and his heart felt heavy. His vision became blurry, and he realized with a start that he was crying. He really will miss Sirius. A LOT. For the first time he wasn’t so excited about going to Hogwarts, the place he called home.</p>
<p>“Be safe,” Sirius mumbled into Harry’s hair, “Always carry your map and cloak with you. Practice what we have taught you, and tell us if something happens, okay?” he continued softly, “And always remember that we are just a call away,” he was now running his fingers through Harry’s hair. “Tell us if you ever feel like meeting us; we promise to keep our schedules clear on Hogsmeade weekends.”</p>
<p>With every word Sirius said, Harry felt as if his heart would burst. He suddenly felt such a huge rush of affection for his godfather that he couldn’t control his tears anymore. With so many emotions going through his heart and so many words going through his clogged brain, he didn’t know what to say. Where to begin and where to end. So he gathered all of his Gryffindor courage and decided to finally settle for something which had already been going through his mind since that offhanded comment Sirius made while they were out shopping.</p>
<p>“I’ll miss you,” Harry mumbled, and took a deep breath before adding, in a voice just above a whisper, “Dad.”</p>
<p>Sirius froze.</p>
<p>Harry shut his eyes tightly, and clutched Sirius’ robes at his back into fists. He was so scared that Sirius would push him away that he didn’t even realize that he was holding the older man in a death grip. This is it, he thought. This is where everything will either get better, or shatter.</p>
<p>His blood was racing in his veins and his heart was thudding against his ribcage. With every second that passed with no action from Sirius, Harry’s anxiety grew. And his traitorous brain kept conjuring horrible scenarios.</p>
<p>Until Sirius’ hand started brushing through his hair again, as if nothing out of ordinary had happed, and he simply responded, “I’ll miss you too, son,” as if it’s the most natural thing to say, and then went back to rocking him back and forth.</p>
<p>In that moment, the Quidditch World Cup didn’t seem so appealing, and Hogwarts didn’t feel like home anymore.</p>
