    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Apparently it only takes a virus six hours to overtake one completely. Body and mind. A virus or an addiction, whatever you like to call it, the point is: I was fine and then six hours flew by and I was lost. Lost to the world, my cause and myself. Unrecognisably transformed. It happened without my consent, I didn’t want it to happen, nor did I really allow it to. By the time I realised what was happening to me it was too late. It was done. I was gone and there was absolutely nothing I could do about it. Nothing I wanted to do about it. I still had full control over my body, yet somehow I just didn’t want anything of what I had wanted before those bleeding six hours passed and turned everything upside down.</p>
<p>I used to think I was crazy, but I wasn’t. High spirited, eccentric, impulsive, yes, not crazy. It only took me going actually insane to realise that I had been fine before. Maybe a little unhinged, definitely far off the beaten path, but not as mad as people claimed. Being insane is losing control of your mind, of your thoughts, of yourself. That happened to me. Mind you, not during my prolonged weekend stay in the world’s most horrifying prison, but right here where freedom reigns and life is fucking peachy all the time.</p>
<p>The irony isn’t lost on me. No one ever dared to call me mad to my face but I’ve heard the whispers. I I was said to be a nutter, totally bonkers, demented, daft, batshit, off the trolley, touched in the head, nutty as a fruitcake, a few sandwiches short or a picnic. “Look the other way children, leave the crazy lady be, before you look at her wrongly and she’ll gauge your eyes out because the voices in her head tell her to.” I’ve heard it all and it never bothered me. I took it as a compliment of sorts. I was unpredictable, frightening, I didn’t care much for the things most care a lot for. So I skipped and giggled and acted like a child because it was fun and it worked. It served my cause, I served him and I didn’t have to care about my reputation as long as I was deadly, sufficiently skilled to further the cause and unpredictable enough to not end up back in Azkaban. My reputation served me well.</p>
<p>For the longest time I felt invincible, no I didn’t just feel it. I was invincible cause nothing could harm me. I understood the chance of my side losing was rather big, but I didn’t worry about that. Everything was just fine as long as I was free to breathe in my own air and stand outside unchained. Everything bad had already happened to me, and honestly a lot of it I had brought on myself. I foolishly truly believed nothing could bring me down. I knew I could withstand all the pain anyone could possibly throw my way. And if life somehow became unbearable I could always just pop my clogs. Kick the bucket for the good cause. Lay down with my lord, bite the dust.</p>
<p>I recognized the girl as soon as the snatchers brought her and her friends in. She was the mudblood. The little know it all that liked to hang around Potty and the Weasel so much she apparently had decided to take a little camping trip away from Hogwarts. Now I don’t know how muggle parents feel about their female spawn skipping school to share a tent with two boys, but that was certainly something my father wouldn’t have taken kindly to. I remember thinking it was a ballsy move when I looked at her. I remembered asking myself what was so special about her that two hormone driven boys were willing to participate in a love triangle, but that was before I saw her in the flesh.</p>
<p>I had seen her before of course, at the ministry, the day I killed my cousin. She’d been a mousy girl then, small with too much hair to even properly see her face, not that I paid much attention. I’d only just been freed and honestly I was too caught up in the excitement of fighting and running around unleashed to take more than one look at the girl.</p>
<p>This time I did a double take.</p>
<p>She was feisty, struggling against the greasy moron that held her captive, and running her mouth. She was trying to talk her way out of her predicament. She flushed with anger, not a trace of fear visible on that delectable face. She looked like a proper English rose, high cheekbones, pink skin and rosy lips. Her golden brown hair was still a little untamed but nowhere near as bushy as it once was, it adorned her face beautifully and brought out her eyes that almost perfectly matched the colour of it. She had blossomed into a fine young woman.<br/>I caught myself in time. Started paying attention to the conversation going on before anyone had to remind me to not just stand there and stare at the girl the way a cat might stare at a ball of yarn that’s dangled in front of its face. I composed myself, things escalated quickly and soon I found myself alone with her. For once I was grateful my fellow death eaters were such squeamish little bastards. They all made different excuses, but in truth none of them wanted to be around to witness what crazy old Bella might do to the poor little mudblood.</p>
<p>Just because we were alone didn’t mean the girl became any less spirited. She stood in front of me and called me demented right to my face. I silently listened to more of her uninspired insults for a while, taking in her image, making a mental picture. This was Hermione before pain. I wanted to torture her. I obviously had to, because I had to ask her about the sword, but quite frankly the whole sword business was an afterthought. I wanted to wreck her body with pain and then patch her up only to cause her more pain. I had done it a thousand times before to a thousand people, but never to her. That made all the difference.</p>
<p>Not that she was special, she wasn’t. She was pretty yes, and brave, but lots of people start out brave and lots of people are pretty. I wanted to torture her because I was bored. I felt dead inside. Life on the outside wasn’t shaping up to be all that mind blowingly interesting. A crucio here an avada kedavra there, that was what my life was reduced to. That was the role I played in this war, the part I had committed to such a long time ago.</p>
<p>It took no effort at all to point my wand at the girl in front of me and yell crucio. She fell to the ground immediately and started writhing, screams falling from her pretty lips so loud I had to cover my ears. I watched her body move on its own. I knew exactly what it was like to lose control over yourself so completely, and I’ve cruicod enough people in my life to know that not everyone responds in the same way. There’s obviously pain and involuntary movement, but some people are dancers and others tinmen. She was a ballerina. Even in excruciating pain she was gloriously graceful. A joy to watch, so to speak, and as her screams died down a little, the way they tend to do when one is exposed to prolonged pain, it was like she was singing to me. She performed heart warmingly, I smiled and took a couple more steps in her direction.</p>
<p>I forgot about the questions I was supposed to ask her, the reason she was even there. I forgot about the war and everything else. My mind cleared itself completely as I stared at the squirming body at my feet, drinking in the girly screams, and watching the light of the chandelier reflect on her wildly moving curls. The light making her medium brown hair look golden. I was generally enjoying the beauty of her pain, the way I had done so often before.</p>
<p>I don’t know if I was born a sadist, made into one or simply adapted my needs to the circumstances of my life. What I do know is that, in spite of my naturally cheery disposition, I’m not one to stop and smell the roses. Yet that is exactly what I found myself doing that day. The moment I became aware of it I lifted the curse that had probably already gone on too long for my purposes.</p>
<p>So long that it was likely that the girl below me had already vacated her mind.</p>
<p>She stopped writhing, her screams turned into rather sensual sounding moans and suddenly it was not hard to imagine what it would be like to make her moan for entirely different reasons. That pissed me off endlessly so I tapped my foot on the ground impatiently and counted slowly back from 100 before I hit her with another crucio. Right on cue her wails became unbearably loud all over again and I continued watching for just a few seconds. I knew full well that even if she was strong enough to make it through that first round, she wouldn’t be able to endure much more of that. I waved the curse away grudgingly and stared at the now totally wrecked heap of girl at my feet.</p>
<p>Her face was red, tear streaked this time and she’d bitten her own lips till they bled. The position she was lying in was strange, mangled, but I was pretty sure no bones were broken. She was still occasionally moving, the remnants of the curse making her so sensitive even the breeze could make her jolt. I thought of healing her, to make the pain go away but decided against it. I still had questions to ask and this was only the beginning of our time together. I wouldn’t start building her up until she had totally broken down.</p>
<p>On impulse I threw myself on top of her, which made her cry out. I pressed my forehead against hers and groaned in delight when I felt her body right there, below me. Soft, warm, pliable, defenceless. It had been so very long, too long in fact. I forgot myself for a moment and got lost in the kind of comfort that only comes from having another human body pressed up against you. I closed my eyes for a few short moments and stopped to smell the proverbial roses for a second time that day. I knew that this wasn’t normal, not even for me, that this wasn’t how any of this was supposed to go down but I couldn’t help myself. I pressed pause on my interrogation to fully take in the sensation of her body against mine. It was such an uncommon luxury that I barely managed to repress a shiver. I held my breath and when I had to start breathing again I composed myself and finally started questioning her.</p>
<p>“Where did you get the sword? Did you get into my vault? How did you get into my vault, what else did you take?” I repeated the same questions over and over.</p>
<p>She still had her wits about her although her answers didn’t make much sense and were less than informative.</p>
<p>She looked into my eyes and showed me how scared she was, scared but brave enough to look. There was fear and disgust and a lot of that stupid Gryffindor bravery. I knew she wasn’t going to tell me anything useful. I could have easily used legilimency to take a peek in her undoubtedly unguarded mind but what would be the fun in that? That would be cheating. I stared into that stubborn brown and more and more disgust shone through. That made me angry. I did not deserve to be looked at that way by her. I considered myself a force to be reckoned with, not something akin to a dog turd you slip on in the street. It bothered me that this girl was looking at me that way.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t have bothered me but it did. I can be petty sometimes. She was lying there like the perfect golden haired martyr for her cause, all unearned bravery and heroism. Graceful in her predicament, young and beautiful, and here I was, old, and used up, filthy. I used to be just like her but time had eaten up all of my grace, all of my beauty and most of my humanity. Nobody looked at me the way I couldn’t help but look at her, not any more. That part of my life was behind me. I was a tool. A thing to be used and discarded when the time came. A woman equally feared and mocked. Scary Bella, crazy Bella. “Try to stay on your aunt’s good side, Draco dear, she’s had a hard life.” Not she has a hard life but she’s had. Even my sister knew my life was over. I was done for. I was something to be pitied and/or feared. A once favoured toy that had broken, a knife that was now blunt and useless. And, if this war ever ended, I had no doubt I’d become even more useless, even more unwanted, no matter the outcome.</p>
<p>“You think you have a hard life?” I whispered to the girl. “Welcome to my world, love.”</p>
<p>Her eyes grew large and I giggled to drive the self pity away. I straightened my spine and clamped my thighs around her waist, locking her in place, reached up under my skirt and pulled the dagger out of my garter.</p>
<p>“Meet my little friend, mudblood filth.” I gave her my best grin and dangled the knife in front of her face. She paled.</p>
<p>I know, I know. How un- pure-blooded of me to choose to maim the girl manually. Naturally I know a lot of dark spells that can do a lot worse than cut someone open, or even cut a person open in multiple places with the single flick of a wand, but I prefer the dramatic poetry of using my knife. There is something uniquely satisfying about slicing through living human skin and watching the blood rise up slowly. It’s a lot slower and less efficient but in my opinion anticipation is half the torture. Besides, my dagger was well enhanced, so whatever I decided to adorn her with would stay with her for a long time.</p>
<p>I took her left wrist firmly in my right hand and stretched her arm out. Her skin was the perfect canvas, pale, delicate, not a single mark. I didn’t know I was going to carve her definition into her until I pressed the tip of my dagger against her skin, pierced through the surface and wrote an M. She struggled a little bit and cried a lot. I deliberately took it slow, watching the blood well up and turn my clumsy handwriting into art. It felt so good. I could precisely imagine the look on her face when she found out not a healing spell in the world could rid her of my handiwork.</p>
<p>She squeaked and screamed, sputtered, moaned and grunted and I must admit her variety of tortured sounds was a delight to me.</p>
<p>It was almost as if I could taste her screams, like they moved through my body and changed me. It felt so strange, like a small fire was lit on the inside. Like I was drowning in her pain and glowing at the same time. I had severe issues concentrating on what I was doing and as a result the second O turned out quite a bit bigger than the first one, not that it mattered. I wasn’t exactly trying to beautify her. I wanted to mark her, remind her of who she was, remind myself. I gathered my mind while watching the letter fill up with blood, and then focused fully on getting the D right. No more distractions, I told myself. I knew I would have plenty of time with the girl, cause my fellow death eaters wouldn’t dare disturb me before I told them I was done. So, if I absolutely had to, I could smell the bloody flowers later.</p>
<p>For now my little artwork was done and I gave myself an A-, as I inspected the word. Her previously unblemished skin now said MudbloOd. It looked extra extravagant with all the blood seeping from the wound, but eventually, not anytime soon, it would stop bleeding and leave a nice scar.</p>
<p>I stared at the blood. It wasn’t muddy. Of course it wasn’t, it was red just like everyone’s. It looked like strawberry jam or wine, ketchup maybe not like mud at all. Appetizing, I thought. I lifted up her arm and brought my face closer to the blood. It smelled exactly like all blood does. It’s not like I didn’t know already that mudblood blood is no different from wizard or muggle blood, I wasn’t crazy, not exactly. But whilst staring at her arm a feeling crept over me that I had been trying to push out ever since I signed my soul over to the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>Bollocks.</p>
<p>The whole idea that muggles or mudbloods shouldn’t be allowed to breed with wizards or that mudbloods and halfbloods are inherently less than pure-blood wizards is absurd. Boom. I can hear you thinking you know? You are wondering how it is possible for the Dark Lord’s right hand to feel that way about blood purity. How it is possible that I joined his cause if I honestly felt that way about all that bloodline hogwash?</p>
<p>No one forced me. I joined him and his bleeding cause of my own volition. I signed up because I’d rather be his foot soldier than a bloody housewife. I had already been turned into the wife of one Rodolphus Lestrange and the pressure was on. The choice between starting a war and having another conversation about producing an heir to the Lestrange line with my mother in law wasn’t a choice at all.</p>
<p>He saw something in me and everyone worshipped the ground he tread on, so we made a deal. He appointed me as his lieutenant, his right hand. I would do everything within my power to push his agenda and he would tell my family I was too valuable to waste away taking care of a litter of Lestrange children.</p>
<p>So it was done. My very real marriage turned into a paper union and I was so grateful I would have followed Him to the end of the earth. Make no mistake. I didn’t think he wanted to overthrow the government gently, I knew the things he would ask of me would be cruel and terrible, but I chose Him anyway. I went in with my eyes wide open. There were no mitigating circumstances, I just didn’t care. Along the way I learned that I was quite good at being cold and hurting people, which landed me in prison. And after my stint in Azkaban I tried to enjoy life to its fullest.</p>
<p>So yeah. The real irony lies in the fact that I never gave two shits about blood purity. Sure I talk the talk and act the part. How could I not? I can’t blooming well be the world’s most feared death eater and preach equality!</p>
<p>I don’t think that mudbloods are an abomination, or that they are filthy or stupid in any way. I know some pure-bloods who are terrible wizards and some mudbloods who are brilliant. Blood purity is just a backwards idea that some people desperately cling to because it makes them feel safe and in control. It’s an idea both my parents subscribed to quite seriously. Sixteen year old me thought it was the dumbest thing but it’s not like I ever actually fought against that ideology. I wasn’t Andy, I didn’t care, I rebelled in different ways.</p>
<p>I thought I could convince my father to listen to my objections to getting married at 18 as long as I kept voicing various arguments.</p>
<p>I learned the hard way that my opinion was entirely irrelevant. I was a girl. A baby making machine in the making. I had to always sit up straight and be kind, be gentle, be polite, well mannered, well dressed, groomed. I was a rebel, until I saw my younger sister declared dead to the family, burned off the tapestry. Until I found my own delightful arse pushed down to the altar on the unforgiving arm of my father. I felt powerless. I was, until I met Tom.</p>
<p>He was the most powerful wizard I had ever met. He didn’t shy away from using the darkest magic available to him to get what he wanted. I had always been fascinated with dark magic, but being a girl there was no need for me to even get a chance to excel at such things. “Why don’t you enrol in healing school Bella? I did when I was your age and waiting for my first baby. Healing will come in very handy if you have a lot of rowdy sons.” I wanted to strangle my mother when she told me that, but I smiled, swallowed my bile and did as she suggested, after all, if I was away from the Lestrange house for any amount of time the chances of me getting pregnant would dramatically decrease.</p>
<p>I met Tom when my parents introduced me to him during a family dinner. He was very charismatic and I was instantly impressed. Not with his long lectures on blood purity, but with all the other stuff. The dark things that I knew existed but had no knowledge of. In spite of the age difference we became great friends. He taught me everything he knew, despite me being a girl. He also told me that all the bigotry and hate mongering was mostly advertising. He wanted everyone to be able to use dark magic freely. He wanted it to be taught in schools even. That was something I could get behind.</p>
<p>I guess, somewhere along the line he started to believe his own propaganda, even if he was a halfblood.</p>
<p>Maybe if I had looked beyond my own bellybutton that day I decided to help unleash a war, I would have made a different choice. A choice that may not have cost me fourteen years in Azkaban. Being the right hand of a man obsessed with blood purity wasn’t as exciting as I’d once imagined it would be. Or maybe things had turned out much differently than promised. I never imagined ever being a servant to a man obsessed with chasing after a teenage boy, a boy whom he had had such trouble disposing of. I sure as hell wouldn’t have signed up to serve someone who put his bloody pet snake above me. None of these things were looking much better than raising a flock of pureblood children after all.</p>
<p>But choices were made and it didn’t matter that the most powerful wizard in the world was a mere shell of his former self, or that I had spent a vast amount of time chained up in a drafty cell. It didn’t matter because abandoning my cause would inevitably lead to my demise. I wasn’t quite ready to go yet. I could die whenever I felt ready, or whenever someone got lucky and managed to slay me. Tom had lost his mind, I knew in my heart of hearts that our cause was losing, but it didn’t matter because I still wanted to live. So I went ahead and did what I had to do, what I wanted to do anyway.</p>
<p>In my quest to become powerful I had hurt so many people, caused such grief and pain that I knew there is be no possibility of redemption, no light at the end of any tunnel, not for me. And the cherry on top of that bitter pie was that after all that, my opinion still didn’t count. I had gone from being a stupid irrelevant girl to being a crazy old hag and the only power I had left was the power of destruction. My leash was a lot longer than it could have ever been whilst being fully married to Rod, but I had always worn a collar.</p>
<p>The day I marked Hermione’s pure, beautiful arm with a slur I didn’t even believe had any validity or real meaning. I knew exactly what I was doing. The truth was, it didn’t matter what I believed. People far more stupid than I would see the girl’s mark and judge her. If she lived after our time together, she would eternally be reminded of an ideology that had fuck all to do with her.</p>
