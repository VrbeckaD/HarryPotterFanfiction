<p>Attached is the dry-cleaning bill for the shirt you ruined when you threw your tea at it. I’m not sure if you noticed, but I happened to be wearing the shirt at the time. You are lucky it was cold. Pay the bill and I won’t sue you for assault.</p>

<p>I did notice, because unlike you, I can identify when something is being inhabited, you forest-destroying <em>monster</em>.</p>
<p>You do not require a dry cleaner to get herbal tea out of a shirt. The shirt was black, the tea was camomile, and you have no grounds on which to stand nor sue. Your company, however, WILL be exposed for the havoc it is wreaking upon our natural world.</p>

</p>
<p>oh, evening Tom</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Abraxas Malfoy] to [Tom Riddle] at 7:40pm</strong>
</p>
<p>how are you</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Tom Riddle] to [Abraxas Malfoy] at 7:41pm</strong>
</p>
<p>I asked you a question.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Abraxas Malfoy] to [Tom Riddle] at 7:41pm</strong>
</p>
<p>i don’t know who he is</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Abraxas Malfoy] to [Tom Riddle] at 7:42pm</strong>
</p>
<p>weasleys are pals of harry potter though</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>you asked draco a question? hes an idiot</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Tom Riddle] to [Abraxas Malfoy] at 8:03pm</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, I now realise that. So this Weasley – what does he do.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Tom Riddle] to [Tom Riddle] at 8:03pm</strong>
</p>
<p>he works at wheezes</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Tom Riddle] to [Abraxas Malfoy] at 8:03pm</strong>

<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Abraxas Malfoy] to [Tom Riddle] at 8:04pm</strong>

<p>the joke shop. does the word ‘ear’ ring a bell</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Tom Riddle] to [Abraxas Malfoy] at 8:05pm</strong>
</p>
<p>Oh, yes. That’s why the name was familiar.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Abraxas Malfoy] to [Tom Riddle] at 8:05pm</strong>
</p>
<p>nasty business</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Tom Riddle] to [Abraxas Malfoy] at 8:07pm</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed. Unfortunate that there were no fingerprints at the crime scene.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Abraxas Malfoy] to [Tom Riddle] at 8:07pm</strong>
</p>
<p>very</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Abraxas Malfoy] to [Tom Riddle] at 8:08pm</strong>
</p>
<p>what did the weasley kid do</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Tom Riddle] to [Abraxas Malfoy] at 8:08pm</strong>
</p>
<p>I don’t like the sound of him, is all. He’s coming to the Charity Dinner as a plus one – we’ll be keeping an eye on him.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Abraxas Malfoy] to [Tom Riddle] at 8:09pm</strong>
</p>
<p>right you are boss</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Abraxas Malfoy] to [Tom Riddle] at 8:10pm</strong>
</p>
<p>whose plus one is he</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Tom Riddle] to [Abraxas Malfoy] at 8:10pm</strong>
</p>
<p>That annoying bleeding-heart liberal. Harmony something.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Abraxas Malfoy] to [Bellatrix Black] at 8:11pm</strong>
</p>
<p>HE PRETENDED NOT TO REMEMBER HER NAME</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Bellatrix Black] to [Abraxas Malfoy] at 8:11pm</strong>
</p>
<p>he did it at lunch today as well and kept bringing her up</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Bellatrix Black] to [Abraxas Malfoy] at 8:11pm</strong>
</p>
<p>he is OBSESSED</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Bellatrix Black] to [Abraxas Malfoy] at 8:12pm</strong>
</p>
<p>very tedious but can you imagine if he actually got laid?</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Abraxas Malfoy] to [Bellatrix Black] at 8:12pm</strong>

<p>the interns would rejoice</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Abraxas Malfoy] to [Tom Riddle] at 8:13pm</strong>

<p>its hermione i think. pretty thing.</p>

</p>
<p>what did you do??????</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Tom Riddle] to [Abraxas Malfoy] at 8:13pm</strong>
</p>
<p>Hardly. Too much hair. Maybe if she wore something other than that ridiculous red coat.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Abraxas Malfoy] to [Tom Riddle] at 8:14pm</strong>
</p>
<p>didnt you have a meeting with her the other day</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Tom Riddle] to [Abraxas Malfoy] at 8:14pm</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, she threw her <u>tea</u> at me. Uncivilised.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Abraxas Malfoy] to [Tom Riddle] at 8:14pm</strong>
</p>
<p>not her tea!</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Tom Riddle] to [Abraxas Malfoy] at 8:15pm</strong>
</p>
<p>She refused to pay the dry-cleaning bill.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Abraxas Malfoy] to [Tom Riddle] at 8:16pm</strong>
</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Tom Riddle] to [Abraxas Malfoy] at 8:16pm</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Abraxas Malfoy] to [Tom Riddle] at 8:17pm</strong>
</p>
<p>get her back at the charity dinner. switch the seats &amp; sit next to her and dump soup on her lap or something.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Tom Riddle] to [Abraxas Malfoy] at 8:17pm</strong>
</p>
<p>I already am sitting next to her, I made sure. Also, I would never dump <u>soup</u> in someone’s <u>lap.</u> That would be uncouth.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Tom Riddle] to [Abraxas Malfoy] at 10:54pm</strong>
</p>
<p>I’ll just make her night miserable.</p>

</p>
<p>Tom. As much as I enjoy seeing you torment my least favourite students (sans one). You look like a serial killer and it is not good for public relations. I hope you realise how ironic this text message is.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Severus Snape] to [Tom Riddle] at 11:10pm</strong>
</p>
<p>I understand you are preoccupied at the moment. But I can <u>see</u> you hearing your phone go off.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Severus Snape] to [Tom Riddle] at 11:11pm</strong>
</p>
<p>You put it on silent. We have been friends for a decade.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Severus Snape] to [Tom Riddle] at 11:15pm</strong>
</p>
<p>The press is beginning to take notice. That Skeeter woman has taken at least five pictures of you and Granger. Take your arm off the back of her chair. Stop glaring at Cormac McLaggen.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Severus Snape] to [Tom Riddle] at 11:41pm</strong>
</p>
<p>Weasley has misunderstood the nature of this charity and has wandered off to see if any women will take pity on him. There is no need to sit <u>that</u> close to her.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Severus Snape] to [Tom Riddle] at 11:50pm</strong>
</p>
<p>You look deranged. Stop grinning like that.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Severus Snape] to [Tom Riddle] at 11:51pm</strong>
</p>
<p>Unsure as to why I am continuing to send you text messages when you are clearly busy. I am going home.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Tom Riddle] to [Severus Snape] at 2:17am</strong>
</p>
<p>You overreacted. We were having a debate.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Severus Snape] to [Tom Riddle] at 2:21am</strong>
</p>
<p>I would ask what you are doing still awake when you have a meeting at six a.m. tomorrow.</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Tom Riddle] to [Severus Snape] at 2:32am</strong>
</p>
<p>Don’t be sordid. The charity closed, and we continued our discussion over coffee, that is all. She isn’t my type.</p>

</p>
<p>Yes. I got the tofu as well, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Stop dissing tofu. If you cook it properly it’s delicious and very good for you.</p>

<p>Did you read that article I sent?</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Hermione Granger] to [Tom Riddle] at 7:44pm</strong>
</p>
<p>About how soy causes deforestation? Yes. And may I remind you that most of that soy is grown to overfeed cattle? And that if it was just grown for humans, deforestation would reduce significantly?</p>
<p>
  <strong>[Hermione Granger] to [Tom Riddle] at 7:44pm</strong>

<p>At least send me something challenging, Tom.</p>

  <u>Of course it was a secret you absolute buffoon.</u>

<p>In a small, secluded ceremony (that yours truly was invited to) on Saturday, high-profile and highly-private couple Thomas Riddle and Hermione Granger became man and wife.</p>
<p>Predictably, Granger is keeping her last name. The bushy-haired bride looked understated but classy as she walked down the aisle, beaming toothily at her groom in a modest gown. Mr Riddle wore the finest suit Madame Malkin’s could provide and appeared indifferent to the proceedings.</p>
