          <div class="userstuff"><p>Flower<br/>Riddle rode into town all alone, on a steed of the finest breed.<br/>The young women would swoon and the men would stew in jealousy, filled with anger as they loathed.<br/>He taunted and played, fighting men and stealing maidenheads, until he met his match.<br/>He met a young maiden, proper and prepared, with hair of silken gold. With talent and wit, his heart she snitched, and melted the ice on his soul.<br/>Budding Cecelia, with her smile and warmth, was but a girl born of commoner folk. Not noble, but close, the two lovers gave loyalty in oaths forswearing all others who approached.</p><p>Blooming Cecelia, with her sweet summer hopes, but alas, her love was crushed by a witch with hopes of her own.<br/>A young witch, with potions, to bewitch decided to steal her Riddle's heart away.</p><p>Fair Ceceilia, she  tried her best to save the delicate seeds of care she had sewn, but the concoction flooded her love.</p><p>Wilting Cecelia, she cried and screamed, desperately trying to rekindle love.</p><p>Crushed Cecelia, she became one with the forest, now a blooming Magnolia tree.</p><p>Dearest Cecelia, your Riddle mourns you, from now to the end of eternity.</p></div>
