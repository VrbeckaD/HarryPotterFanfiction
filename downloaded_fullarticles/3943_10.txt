  <em>It’s one of his earliest memories. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>One would think that the more a memory is recalled and examined, the clearer it would remain but that’s not the case. At least for him it’s not, because this memory is fuzzy and vague and he’s never quite sure that what he remembers is actually what he remembers:</em>
</p><p>Ignoring his mother’s order that he is to stay in bed because he’s still getting over his cold, Newt waits until Nanny Elspeth has left and then slides out of bed. He pulls on his slippers and creeps downstairs. The big hall is empty but the painting of Great-grandfather Arsenios spies him and calls out, <em>‘You there!’ </em>Newt shivers because Great-grandfather Arsenios is mean and loud but he doesn’t stop. He runs to the door and then down the steps, across the drive, and around the house to the woods.</p><p>It’s cool amongst the trees and he slows down, thinking he should have at least worn a robe. It’s too late, though, so he keeps going. When he gets to the hippogriff enclosure, he doesn’t hesitate—he slips through the railing and hides behind a tall pine.</p><p>His mother is working with her latest acquisition, a young hippogriff by the name of Calvin. Fascinated by the creature that smells of fire and musk, and is the color of smoke, Newt stares. He’s never been in the enclosure without his mother right by his side before and he’s anxious. But he can’t quite see and so he moves nearer. Eyes on the creature and not where he’s going, Newt isn’t careful and he accidentally steps on a soft, piney twig. The muffled sound is like a crack of lightening in the still forest and quick as quick, the hippogriff turns his head.</p><p>“Newton,” says his mother very calmly, without glancing around. “If that’s you, don’t stare. Back up very slowly.”</p><p>It's proof that his mother <em>does </em>have eyes in the back of her head like Thee has always said, but Newt doesn’t move because he can’t. He’s suddenly frozen, terrified, unable to look away from Calvin’s yellow gaze. Even though Calvin is young, he is so much taller than the drawings in the books and his talons and beak are so much longer. Newt doesn’t cry because tears are for babies and he’s six and eleven months and therefore <em>not</em> a baby. But his face gets hot and his throat tightens and he thinks he just might cry, anyway.</p><p>Calvin ruffles his feathers and lowers his head. He takes a step towards Newt and Newt’s mother gets her wand out of the pocket of her breeches.</p><p>It’s so quiet. Newt can hear the creak of the pines, and what he thinks might be the muted trill of a doxie, and his own heart beating.</p><p>And then three things happen at once: He hears hurried footsteps and then a jolly but hushed, “Hullo, Mother. Everything all right?” At the same time, someone comes up from behind and picks him up. The someone turns so Newt can’t see the hippogriff anymore.</p><p>Newt relaxes because it’s Thee, though it’s not Thee who’s holding him. It’s a boy about Thee’s age with dark hair and black eyes.</p><p>“Theseus,” Newt’s mother sighs. “Thank Minerva.”</p><p>Thee comes to stand by Newt and the boy. “Don’t tell me—he was supposed to stay in his room.”</p><p>“He had a cold. Take him back to the house, please.”</p><p>The boy is already inching step by step towards the big gate; he shifts Newt to his other arm and then looks down at him. “Are you okay?” he whispers.</p><p>Newt nods.</p><p>The boy gives Newt an odd smile and then rubs the damp away from under his eyes with his thumb. “It’s all right,” he whispers.</p><p>Newt nods again. The boy’s black wool coat smells of cigarettes and something that Newt can only identify as air<em>. </em></p><p>When they get to the gate, the boy turns and Newt finally sees Calvin again. Calvin’s feathers are smooth and he’s no longer looking at Newt like he wants to eat him.</p><p>“He’s safe, Mother,” Thee says.</p><p>“I’ll be in shortly for proper introductions.” Newt’s mother replies, putting her wand away. “There’s tea, if you boys are hungry.”</p><p>“We are,” Thee answers, and then, with sudden formality, he bows low. Calvin makes a rough purring sound and bows back.</p><p>“Come on,” Thee whispers as he joins Newt and the boy. Once they’re through and the gate is locked, Thee sighs and shakes Newt’s arm.</p><p>“What were you thinking?” Thee says. “You know Mother is only allowed inside when she’s got a hatchling.” He lets go of Newt’s arm. “You’re lucky we found you. You can thank Great-grandfather Arsenios and Elspeth for that.”</p><p>“It’s rude to look at them that way,” the boy adds, his voice no longer a whisper.</p><p>“I know,” Newt says, frowning because he <em>does</em> know—he really isn’t a baby, no matter what Theseus always says. He pushes back a little so he can see more of the boy, “You sound funny.”</p><p>Thee grins. “That’s because he’s American,” he says, adding to the boy, “you can put him down, you know.”</p><p>The boy shrugs and shifts Newt to his hip. “That’s okay. He’s not heavy and we’re here, anyway.”</p><p>They are, stepping from the cool of the woods to the lea that runs behind the house. Nanny Elspeth is watching from the third floor window. When she sees them, she throws her hands up and disappears. Newt feels bad because he frightened her. He likes Nanny Elspeth—she tells him stories of fairies and pixies and leprechauns.</p><p>The boy puts Newt down and asks, “Sure you’re okay?”</p><p>Newt stares up at the boy. The boy’s eyes aren’t black, but a very dark brown, just like eyes of the wood nymph that lives in the tree near the old forester’s hut. Somehow the sight makes Newt confused and he doesn’t answer.</p><p>“That’s right,” Thee says as he turns to the house. “He saves your life and now you’re shy?”</p><p>Newt frowns and follows, scuffing his slipper on the thyme that grows wild. “I am not.”</p><p>“Are, too.”</p><p>“Am not.”</p><p>Theseus reaches into his pocket and pulls out a pack of muggle cigarettes. “Are, too.”</p><p>“Am not and I’m telling Mother.”</p><p>Cigarette in mouth, Thee pauses. He looks back at Newt. “You wouldn’t dare.”</p><p>“Would, too. Father says they’re bad for you.”</p><p>Thee glares at Newt but he puts the cigarettes away. “Come on,” he says to the boy. “I’ll show you my room.”</p><p>The boy starts to follow but then he turns. Bowing low, just like Thee had done to Calvin, he holds out his hand. “Percival Gondulphus Graves, at your service.”</p><p>Straightening up, trying to be as elegant, Newt takes the boy’s hand. “Newton Artemis Fido Scamander,” he says, stumbling a little on parts because he’s never said his whole name to anyone before.</p><p>The boy—Percival—smiles and says, “It’s good to meet you, Newton. You were very brave back there.”</p><p>Newt starts to tell the boy that no one except Mother and Father calls him ‘Newton,’ but before he can, Thee shouts from the French doors, “Perce! Are you coming or what?”</p><p>With another smile and a wink, Percival drops Newt’s hand.</p><p>The sun hot on the back of his neck, Newt watches as Percival strolls across the terrace and into the house.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
