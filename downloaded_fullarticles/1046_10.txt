    <p>Warnings: Cursing, Violence, Sexual assault, Rape.<br/>Hello.</p>
<p>        My name is Echo. Yes, you heard-well read that correctly. My name is Echo. Echo Moon Rose to be exact, Now, I am fully aware that my name is strange, but what can I say, my mom is what some-most people would call a “Hippy”. Her name is Dawn Omysha Rose. Omysha means smile. My dad-Jack Allen Grivaldi-only went along with it because he loves her.</p>
<p>        Plus, they made a deal before they got married. My dad would name the boys-my older brother John Allen Grivaldi- and my mother would name the girls-me and my younger sister Alice Acacia Rose. Acacia means thorny.</p>
<p>        If you didn't already notice, I have a thing for names I like knowing what they mean. I noticed that the meaning of a name somehow matches perfectly to the beholder of it. My name “Echo” is the name of a nymph in mythology that slowly fades away until only her voice was heard. She never had the first word but she always had the last. An echo.</p>
<p>        It’s pretty perfect to have that as my name then.</p>
<p>        I am currently 11 years of age as of June 29th so I will be a first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I have baby blue hair and blue eyes. My parents and I discovered that I was a Metamorphmagus at a young age, but only my hair color can change. It only changes with my moods through, Blue means i’m calm and neutral, red means i’m angry or irritated, yellow means i’m happy, green means i’m jealous or disgusted, purple means i’m scared, white means i’m numb or void of any emotion, pink means i'm embarrassed, and black means i’m sad.</p>
<p>        I've noticed that some people think that it’s weird being a Metamorphmagus and people have made fun of me for it, but frankly I don’t give a shit what they think. Another thing I do that other kids my age don’t. I curse. A lot. More than I should really. My mum and dad say I can curse as long as I understand that words hurt, even worse than physical pain.</p>
<p>        I understand that perfectly. I get hurt by words everyday, so I know what it feels like. I don't like hurting people, it’s not right in my mind. Even if i’m standing up for myself or someone else I still feel bad for hurting them even if they deserve it. Maybe i’m weird or maybe it’s because of my hippy mother, but I feel that it is our duty as living beings to love one another. But, maybe I am a hypocrite because I myself am mean, rude, sarcastic, and hurtful to people too. Mainly because i've been hurt too many times in the past  and in the present. I put up a wall around me so people won't hurt me anymore. I still get hurt though, so the walls get thicker and thicker until one day i’m afraid I won't be able to love or be loved.</p>
<p>        It’s just too painful to stay open and connect with people when they just end up ripping out your heart and stomping on it. It’s not an excuse or a reason to hide behind, it’s just and explanation. Just because people have hurt me doesnt give me the right to hurt others. The same goes for everyone else in the world.</p>
<p>        I may be a hypocrite but, that doesn't change the way I think or feel. I own my shit. I own the things i've done and the people that i've hurt. That’s a hell of a lot more than others can say they've done.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’ll miss you, sweety.” my mother says pulling me into a bone crushing hug. I return it with the same amount of force.</p>
<p>        “I’ll miss you too mum.” I say into her shoulder. She lets go of me and places one hand on my shoulder and the other on the side of my face. She’s crouched down so we are eye level even though i’m 5 foot 2 and she’s only 3 inches taller than me.</p>
<p>        “Write me everyday.”</p>
<p>        “Mum.” I protest. “Everyday, that's a little much.”</p>
<p>        “Every other day?” She asks and I raise an eyebrow.</p>
<p>        “Better.”</p>
<p>        “Twice a week.” I smile.</p>
<p>        “Deal.” She kisses my forehead and I move to my father.</p>
<p>        “I’ll miss you kiddo. Eat lots of food for me.” he says. I laugh at his joke but I think he’s serious. My mom wasn't actually a hippy as I found out early on. She was actually a Hufflepuff and my dad was a Ravenclaw, my older brother John is a Slytherin. Such a surprise there-insert sarcasm here...Actually I think that's offensive to other Slytherins. I doubt they are all evil twats like my brother.</p>
<p>        I stand on my tippy toes to kiss my dad on the cheek, he pats me on the head and I turn my attention to my little sister Alice. Her blond-almost white-hair is in braided pigtails. Her silver grey eyes shine with wonder and are slick with tears.</p>
<p>        “Please don’t go Echo!” she says hugging my right leg. I bend down and wrap my arms around her. Alice is like a daughter to me. She is the only person I'll let breach my walls, my only exception. Even though there's a six year age gap between us we are really close. Most people find it cute how close we are but, they don't understand. Alice and I are soulmates, best friends, sisters, mother and daughter. She is my everything, if I lost her or if she got hurt I would lose my shit.</p>
<p>        “I have to, It’s not forever. I'll be back soon and I'll write you as much as I can.” I say pulling away from her.</p>
<p>        “Promise?” She asks holding out her pinky finger. I wrap my pinky around hers and we touch thumbs.</p>
<p>        “Promise.” I say crossing my heart. I kiss her on the nose and stand up. I push my cart towards platform 9 ¾ and hold my breath as I go through. The Hogwarts Express is before me and I take in its glory. An old wizard who I suspect works on the train helps me put my trunks on the train. Leaving a small backpack filled with my robes and a cage for my tabby cat to take onboard with me.</p>
<p>        “Echo!” I hear someone yell. I look up to see my brother John, poking his head out of the window. I feel my hair turn a bright red. “Get your arse on board the train before it leaves without you!” I roll my eyes. “Hurry up, you're riding with me and my friends. You know they don’t like to wait.”</p>
<p>        A shiver of disgust runs down my spine. My brother has been prostituting me out to his “friends” since I was six. I only agreed because he threatened to do it to Alice. I will never let that happen to her. Not as long as I am still breathing.</p>
<p>        “Piss off!” I growel. His eyes darken and I know I shouldn't have said that. Any normal person wouldn't have said that. Especially to him. He is one of the most feared Slytherin in the entire school. That’s why i’m no normal person, i’m not afraid of him.</p>
<p>        I board the train and take a deep breath, the red soon fades and is replaced by it’s normal blue color. I walk the opposite direction of him, because i’m stubborn and I know it'll piss him off. I stop in front of a compartment with only two people in it. A boy and a girl my age. The girl has brown frizzy hair, brown eyes, and tan skin. The boy has dark blond/brown hair, blue eyes, and very pale skin. I knock on the door with my knuckle. They stop talking and turn their attention to me. Shock is etched onto there features. I don’t blame them, my appearance is…different than others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m wearing black converse, black ripped jeans, a black tank top with a sleeveless army green jacket over it and I have short blue hair and also I am wearing black lipstick and eyeliner. I like black and wear make up, sue me!</p>
<p>        “Mind if I sit? Everywhere else is full.” I lie, i’m just too god damn  lazy to continue to look for another compartment. Once the shock passes the girl smiles brightly and waves her hand motioning me forward.</p>
<p>        “Yes, come in, come in.” She exclaims. I do as told and sit next to her.</p>
<p>        “I’m Hermione Granger.” She says sticking out her hand, I shake it.</p>
<p>        “I’m Neville.” the boy says. I shake his hand as well.</p>
<p>        “Echo Rose.” I say. “Did you know that the name ‘Hermione’ comes from mythology and is the feminine form of Hermes?” She smiles even bigger.</p>
<p>        “Yes! Are you interested in mythology?” she asks. I shake my head. The tips of my hair turn slightly pink in embarrassment.</p>
<p>        “No, I just like knowing what names mean. I think it’s amazing how the meaning of a name somehow matches the person's personality. It’s kind of an obsession of mine.”</p>
<p>        Hermione laughs. The pink turns darker and spreads farther up the strands of my hair. She hates me. She probably thinks i’m weird.</p>
<p>        “I think it’s brilliant!” I smile. My pink hair vanishes instantly. I smile.</p>
<p>        “How did you do that?” Neville asks. I look over at him and see him pointing to my hair.</p>
<p>        “I’m a Metamorphmagus.” I explain. He nods in understand and Hermione squeals in excitement.</p>
<p>        “I’ve read about those! It’s absolutely amazing! Does your hair change with your mood?” I smile at her and nod. I can feel my hair turning yellow. “What does that mean?”</p>
<p>        “It means i’m happy.” She smiles once again.</p>
<p>        “I think we are going to be best friends.” she says. As if possible my hair turns an even brighter shade of yellow.</p>
<p>++++</p>
<p>        Hermione and Neville are really nice. Neville was shy at first but quickly opened up to me. Hermione is really smart, like wicked smart. She told me he was worried people would make fun of her for it. I told her that if people do, then they will have to deal with me. She reminds me a lot of Alice. Alice is always learning about the muggle world and the wizarding world. She loves anything educational, especially reading just like me.</p>
<p>        Neville somehow lost is pet toad Trevor so now i’m walking down the hallway going door to door asking if anybody has seen it. I come across a compartment with 3 boys my age inside. One is short with brown hair and hazel eyes,the second one is quite tall also with brown hair and brown eyes, so the third boy i quite eye catching among the three because he has white-blond hair and silver grey eyes glazed over with no emotion. The third boy looks a lot like Alice and it is kind of unnerving and somewhat comical if i’m being completely honest. I rap on the door with my knuckles and the three heads spin in my direction. I look around the compartment in search of Trevor but I cannot see him. I sigh getting slightly irritated.</p>
<p>        “Have any of you see a toad around here?” I ask.</p>
<p>        “I’m lookin' at it.” Says the white haired boy. I roll my eyes as the two other boys laugh.</p>
<p>        “Very funny, real original too. Make that up yourself?” I ask sarcastically.</p>
<p>        “Whatever ugly.” he says taking his turn to roll his eyes. I squint my eyes and lean against the door frame, crossing my arms.</p>
<p>        “You could at least put some effort into it if you’re going to insult someone.” I smirk. "Everyone says ‘ugly”, it loses its effect after a while.”</p>
<p>        “Huh?” he says raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p>        “I’m just saying, it would hurt my feelings a hell of a lot more if you spice it up a little. Get creative.’</p>
<p>        “Hmm...I’m Draco Malfoy. That’s Crabbe and Goyle.” He says gesturing to the two other boys who are staring in confusion.</p>
<p>        “Echo Rose.” I say.</p>
<p>        “Pretty.” he says. I roll my eyes and turn around walking down the hallway. [A/n: Warning- Abuse] Someone grabes a fist full of my hair and yanks. I can’t see who it is until they bend my neck backwards, making my neck pop. The yellow green eyes i've grown to hate stare into my ocean blue ones. His face is contorted in rage making him look like an animal with rabies. My hair turns a bright cherry red.</p>
<p>        “Let the fuck go of me, John!” I grunt. He pulls on my hair even harder.</p>
<p>        “I thought I told you to not keep us waiting.” he whispers in my ear. I can feel the tips of my hair turn a sickly green.</p>
<p>        “And I thought I told you to piss off!” I spit. He lets go of my hair and punches me in the stomach, then he wraps an arm around my neck putting me in a chokehold.</p>
<p>        “I saw that pretty little thing you were talking to earlier.” he says in a strange calmness.</p>
<p>        “Who?” I ask through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>        “What was her name?” he pauses as if thinking of the awnser. “Hermione, right?” he says sweetly. I freeze. Strips of purple lace through my red and green hair. He wouldn't do anything to her, would he? </p>
<p>        “I would.” he says as if reading my thoughts. “And I will if you don’t do exactly what I say from here on out.” I swallow, my throat suddenly dry. I take a deep breath and the strands of purple hair disappear. I can’t-I won't let this happen to her, or anyone else. Never ever will I let this happen to anyone else, even if that means I will be tortured for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>“Good girl.” I bite my tongue and taste copper in my mouth. I wince at the pain. “Don’t forget, you’re mine. No one else's, i’m just loaning you out.” he pulls away from me and I take a deep breath. He raises a hand and grabes a hold of my chin. “Mine.” he lets go and drags me down the hallway. I think back to when I was six and he carved the word ‘mine’ into my left side.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” a tall 3rd year in Hufflepuff asks behind us. My brother turn around and glares daggers in him.</p>
<p>“None of your business, Cedric.” John growels. “I’m just talking a walk with my sister. Isn’t that right Echo?” he asks applying more pressure to my upper arm. I wince in pain and nod, but the boy-Cedric- still glares at John. I look at my feet as John pushes past him dragging me along with him.</p>
<p>He guides me through the hallway and past the rooms until we’re standing outside a closed compartment door with the blinds pulled down. John knocks on the door twice, three times, then once. I hear the door unlock and it opens. John shoves me inside.</p>
<p>“You have three hours.” John says then walks off. Someone slams the door closed and re locks it. I look up and see three boys. A tall boy with brown hair, brown eyes, a short boy with blond hair and blue eyes, and a short boy with black hair brown eyes.  They’re all in Slytherin and are “friends” of my brother. Regular customers.</p>
<p>[A/n: Warning- Rape]</p>
<p>“Strip.” says the blond. I do as told and take off my clothes putting them on an empty seat. I went through puberty early so I have a more mature body. I feel like life and mother nature teamed up to be a complete bitch. The boy with black hair stands fist and walks towards me when i’m completely naked. I close my eyes as his hand gropes along my body. My red and green hair turn a blinding shade of white.</p>
<p>I imagine i’m someone else, somewhere else. An astronaut walking the rings of saturn or a fish swimming in the ocean. Swimming deep in the dark blue waters. The water enveloping me with her silk fingers. Discovering the bottom of the ocean where no human has gone, swimming through shipwrecks and finding people's treasures.</p>
<p>I block everything out. I pretend I don’t feel the pain, that every nerve in my body is disconnected and I feel nothing. I pretend that it doesn't feel like a knife cutting into me everytime they move. And I pretend not to feel another brake in my heart, or another piece of me dying, or another chunk of my mind ruined. I try to put bandaids over my wounds trying to fix them. I pretend and pretend but one day reality is going to catch up to me and bit me in the ass and when it does it will destroy me, breaking every last piece of me and I don’t know if I will be able to fix it.</p>
<p>                        +++++++[A/n: Warning -Abuse]</p>
<p>        After what seems like days, John finally comes back. I put my clothes on while the boys pay him. I’m so lost in my thoughts and I don’t realize John is talking to me until he punches me in the face. I stumble backwards a little cupping my cheek.</p>
<p>        “What the fuck!” I say glaring at him, stands of white hair turning red.</p>
<p>        “Did you hear me?” he asks.</p>
<p>        “I usually can’t understand you because I don’t speak dumbass.” he punches me in the mouth and busts my lip open. I taste the familiar copper liquid fill my mouth and run down my chin. All of my hair turns red.</p>
<p>        “I said ‘you better get into Slytherin or i’ll beat the shit out of you.” I roll my eyes.</p>
<p>        “No.” I say through gritted teeth. He claims me into the wall behind end wraps his hands around my throat, cutting off my air supply. My lungs burn and I scratch at his hands.</p>
<p>        “Don’t think I won't kill you here and now. "</p>
<p>        “I don’t care.” I choke out. I lock eyes with him. “Kill me already you fucking coward!”</p>
<p>        Light is slowly fading from my eyes and all I can hear is my heartbeat everywhere. I feel it in my head and in my throat and in my bones.</p>
<p>        John releases me and shoves me out of the room slamming the door behind me. I fall on my knees gasping for air. Oxygen fills my lungs and my vision goes back to normal. I sit against the wall and put my head in my hand lasing my fingers through my short now white hair.</p>
<p>        When I gather my composure I stand up and walk back to my compartment. Hermione and Neville are already in their ropes so I grab mine and leave before they can say anything. I walk towards the bathroom to change when, the boy from earlier-Cedric-stops me.</p>
<p>        “Are you okay?” He asks me. I give a sad smile and I chuckle lightly.</p>
<p>        “No.” I say looking him in the eyes then I walk past him into the bathroom, closing the door behind me.</p>
<p>        I look into the mirror, barely recognizing myself. The girl staring back at me has tangled white hair, a bruised cheek and eye, a bloody lip, blue eyes that are filled with so much pain that it’ll make anyone cry for them, and finger sized bruises on her neck. She looks like a fragile bird, a broken piece of glass, something ready to brake with the slightest touch. She doesn't look like me, but she is.</p>
<p>        I get undressed and notice purple and blue bruises everywhere. Down my thighs, across my chest and back, around my wrists, along my arms. It’s sad to say that I stopped caring a long time ago but, it’s the truth. I stopped caring who gave them to me and why. I stopped caring that it’s not only my brothers fault but mine as well.</p>
<p>        To others that haven’t gone through something similar to this the answer may seem so simple. They say:</p>
<p>        “Tell someone.” and</p>
<p>        “Ask for help.” and my personal favorite:</p>
<p>        “Tell your parents.” but you don't understand. I can't, it’s not out of fear of what John will do to me, but out of embarrassment. I’m embarrassed. What will my parents think of me, what will Alice think? Will people not believe me? Will people think that I am lying to get attention or think that I asked for it or will they call me a slut and a whore? People who haven't gone through this will say:</p>
<p>        “People won’t do that.” and</p>
<p>        “People wouldn’t say such things about you.” But they are wrong because it has happened before and it will happen again.</p>
<p>I’ve seen it with my own eyes. A girl I used to know named Aria-meaning a lion of god- was a muggle who was my next door neighbor, she was raped by her teacher in grade school. When the teacher was caught and sent to prison the kids at her school where so vicious and cruel. They spread rumors about her and called her filthy names. She couldn't take it anymore so she killed herself in her closet.</p>
<p>She was only 12 years old and she was a very sweet girl, she was always helping people and singing songs and one time when she was 8 and I was 7, she saw my brother picking on me and she punched him in the face. It meant the world to me. She was my only friend growing up and I couldn't do anything to help her.</p>
<p>        So I know what people will say or think about me if I say anything about it. I’m barely hanging on to the rope that is life and I know that if people say those things about me I might just let go and I don’t want my parents and Alice to go through what I went through.</p>
<p>        I run a towel under the faucet and wash my body. I want to scrub off my skin. I can still feel them everywhere. I put on my uniform and robes. My mum and dad bought it a while ago and I must have grow. I pull on the vest and since it’s a coupe sizes bigger than the rest of my uniform it covers the ill fitted clothes.</p>
<p>        I finger brush my white hair and put it in a bun on the top of my head, then I rearrange my side bangs so it goes across my right eye covering the bruise. I re apply my black eyeliner and black lipstick and walk back to the compartment with my clothes pulled to my chest and my head held high. When I get back I see Neville and Hermione in the same positions I left them in.</p>
<p>        Neille is sleeping and Hermione is reading a book. I sit down and unlock my tabby cat from his cage. He is a sunshine yellow with sunset orange stripes and snow white paws, cheeks, and belly.</p>
<p>        “Hello, there Esperanza.” I say softly. Esperanza means hope. “Did you miss me?” I ask scratching behind his ear. He purrs in response and I kiss his head softly. Neville groans and rubs his eyes. He sits up and yawns.</p>
<p>        “Hmm...where did you go?” he asks looking up at me, his eyes widen. “What happened to your face?”</p>
<p>        “Me and my brother got into a fight.” It’s not a lie exactly.</p>
<p>        “A fist fight? About what?” he asks.</p>
<p>        “Nothing in particular.” Nevill looks at me with squinted eyes. He obviously doesn't believe me, but he doesn't push it.</p>
<p>        I zone out in my thoughts while I pet Esperanza. I feel like crying, but I have and will never cry because of John. That's one of the only ways I can defy him. The only thing I can’t let him win.</p>
<p>        I remember a line from a bible I fund on the street. I’m, not religious even though my parents raised me in the muggle world. I read it, but, I only like a couple of lines so I circled them. One of the lines said:</p>
<p>        ‘I will not be afraid of many thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around.’</p>
<p>        For some reason that struck a chord in me. I don't really know what the real meaning is, but, I remember this line in times like this. I doze off to a dreamless sleep with Esperanza in my arms.</p>
