    <p>You sighed, your heart twisting when you saw Newt’s shattered heart written all over his face. His green eyes looked vacant, red from crying. <br/>“Newt” you sighed opening up your arms to him. You ran out to meet him in the shack, closing the door to the animals. You moved to the couch as you held him in your arms. As you sat down he leaned on you, you felt his tears moisten your shoulder.<br/>“She doesn’t love me. She could never love me no one could ever love me.” He choked out. <br/>“Newt that’s not true. You know that’s not true. People do love you. Your parents love you Theseus loves you I love you.” His breath hitched and he lifted his head from your shoulder. <br/>“You….love me?” He asked. He looked up at you with his shattered heart in your eyes and your heart twisted. <br/>“Newt. Im your best friend. Of course I love you.” You told him. <br/>You didn’t know it was possible for him to look any more dejected but his mood seemed to drop. <br/>“I loved you once. As more than a friend. Back at Hogwarts. I was in love with you. Because you were handsome, kind, gentle, passionate, and brilliant and loving. You are loving and worth loving and so easy to love. She never deserved your love. She is the one who is incapable of loving, but you are more than capable of being lov-”<br/>You were cut off when he pressed a kiss to your mouth. His lips were warm and soft and needy and insistent. You were shocked, taking in a kiss that you had wished for for so long. Then you tasted the salt on his lips from his tears. But this wasn’t the kiss. You’d imagined a kiss that was sweet and loving and slow and you’d pull away and look into this green eyes full of love. But that’s not what this was. You pushed him away his eyes open and you didn’t see love you just saw pain. <br/>“Michael.” You gasped your boyfriend’s name. Newt flinched. <br/>“I forgot.” <br/>“Newt I can’t. I-I’m not your rebound. I’m not that kind of girl I don’t know what’s going on with you burnt can’t help you. Not like that.” You said. <br/>“Im sorry Y/N.” He said. <br/>You just nodded and hugged him and held him close, trying in vain to fix the broken man before you. <br/>*****<br/>A few weeks later you finally understood what newt was going through. You learned the hardest way possible: through experience. <br/>You had walked into your boyfriend’s office to surprise him with lunch. You were the one who was surprised. He was sitting at his chair making out with a beautiful woman who was straddling his lap, her skirt hiked up around her waist and her shirt unbuttoned. <br/>You dropped the food you were holding. Startled by the sound, Michael pulled awa from her with a suction noise. When he saw you his eyes widened and he pushed her off his lap and tried to wipe at his face. <br/>“I’m so sorry babe. I-”<br/>You just turned and walked away. <br/>“Just. Shut up. Save it. I don’t want to hear it.” <br/>You stalked down the hallway and you heard his footsteps right behind you. <br/>“Baby I’m- Im sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it. I love you. I just-things weren’t working. It’s like an 80-20 kind of thing. You give me 80% but- There were a couple things missing from our relationship but I love you.”<br/>“Missing?!” You asked, turning to face him. <br/>He nodded. <br/>“Yeah. There was something missing. Just small things. I told you-” <br/>“To change my body? Yeah but you also said you loved me.” You said.<br/>“I do. You’re amazing. I was just supplementing but I love you. Baby we can work this out.” He said. <br/>You just stared at him, incredulous then turned and ran away without another word. <br/>“Y/N!” Michael called after you but you kept running. <br/>As soon as you were out of his line of sight you felt your anger crumble into sadness. The wave of sadness washed over you and the realization that you weren’t good enough suck into your stomach like a punch to the gut. <br/>Tears were running down your face and sons clawing from your throat by the time you reached the case. You couldn’t go back to your apartment, back to Michael, so you came to Newt. <br/>Newt saw you and immediately dropped what he was doing and ran out to meet you. <br/>“Y/N! What’s wrong?” He asked as he pulled you into his arms. He escorted you into the shack and sat you on the couch just as you had done for him. You cried on his shoulder as you sobbed out what had happened. <br/>“Im not enough,” you sobbed. <br/>“Y/N. That’s not true. For the wrong person you will never be enough but for the right person you will be everything.” He said, gently pulling your face so you were looking into his eyes. <br/>“He was the wrong person but to the right person you are everything. You will be everything.” For a second his eyes were shining then you saw the same hollowness you’d seen before. A few weeks ago. It hadn’t faded. The pain from the breakup hadn’t faded. And now you understood that pain. That brokenness. You felt it yourself. You looked at Newt’s eyes, the lingering heartbreak in his matched the prominent heartbreak you felt in yours. His eyes flickered from your eyes to your lips. Desperate to feel something other than the heartbreak you moved closer to him. <br/>He leaned down and pressed his lips against yours. This time he was gentle and cautious. But this time you didn’t push him away. You responded to his kiss opening your mouth to his and you grabbed the lapels of his jacket to pull him closer. He responded eagerly I,mediate,y exploring your mouth with his tongue and dominating the kiss. He pulled you closer and pulled your body so it was pressed against his. He kept pulling you closer and closer until there wasn’t an inch of space in between you. <br/>The kiss was filled was filled with fire and you could taste the salt of tears. You couldn’t tell whose. You opened your eyes and pulled away from his lips for a moment. <br/>“Newt?” You asked, panting. <br/>He opened his eyes and looked at you, a hurricane of emotion inside the sea of green. He looked sad and passionate and heartbroken and emotional all at once. <br/>“You know you need this Y/N. This will help you. I will help you.” He said as he gently leaned down to kiss your neck. As he kissed and sucked and bit lower and lower you moaned. It felt so good, but you knew it wasn’t right. Not like this. <br/>“Newt” you said again,marrying to muster a protest. <br/>Now he was at the top button of your work shirt. His fingers hovering at the buttons, his eyes hungry, but still waiting for permission. <br/>“You need this Y/N.” He said, his eyes pleading with you. The pain in his eyes said what he wouldn’t. He needed it too. Both of you, heartbroken, needed each other. And when his lips were on yours the pain was dulled. <br/>You nodded and he eagerly pulled you back into a kiss. His hands hungrily caressed your body, his fingers warm and gentle and insistent against your skin. His lips on your lips, his tongue in your mouth, his fingers on your skin, they were a drug that numbed the pain of your heartbreak. <br/>In the back of your mind and in the depths of your shattered heart you felt a flicker of warmth, a flicker of the love you once had for him. But you pushed it down, not allowing yourself to hope again. To get caught up again. You refused to let your heart be broken by him again. You would use him to heal your heart, as he was using you to heal his. <br/>The mess of your entangled mind and broken heart did not comprehend the irony of two broken people trying to fix each other</p>
