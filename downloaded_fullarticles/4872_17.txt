  <em>POV: Sirius Black</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Year: First</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, go on already! Run through!”</p><p> </p><p>A young Sirius Black stood in front of the pillar between platforms nine and ten at King’s Cross station, his father’s hand resting- <em> quite uncomfortably </em>- on his shoulder. He pushed the young boy lightly.</p><p> </p><p>“Get through the barrier, before some <em> Muggle </em> asks what we’re up to,” his father said sternly.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius couldn’t help his reluctance. Seriously(no pun intended), he had to run at a <em> wall? </em> To get to Hogwarts? Surely, his parents would have informed him of this prior to right now. He wondered if this was just some sort of <em> Ha, gotcha </em> moment. Then again, his father had never had a sense of humor in the first place.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Son-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, alright, I’m going,” Sirius muttered, shrugging his dad’s hand off his shoulder- could he just <em> stop </em> doing that?- and starting towards the barrier with a fast walk. He sped up, squeezing his eyes shut and expecting to run into a brick wall, but the crash never came. When he opened his eyes, he was surrounded by what he assumed to be other wizards. Mothers fussed over whether or not their children had everything. Children dodged their parents’ kisses, scrunching up their noses and saying, “Not cool!”</p><p> </p><p>It was <em> weird, </em>but Sirius didn’t dwell on it. He only had a few minutes to get onto the train, and he assumed that a few minutes would be what it would take to get through the crowd of people. Not bothering to wait for his parents- he knew that they wouldn’t be following, anyways- he began to make his way around people, muttering “Sorry”s and “Excuse me”s and “Could you get out of my way?”s. He finally arrived at the train door with only a minute or two to spare. Wasting no time in his next actions, he managed to tug his heavy trunk off his trolley and pull it up onto the train, immediately searching for an empty compartment. He was not going to deal with the annoyingly pressing questions about his family if he had a say in anything.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, he found a compartment that was completely empty. Sighing in relief, he entered, closing the door and shoving his trunk under the seat. He leaned back, relaxing.</p><p> </p><p>His privacy was cut short, however, when the compartment door opened and a young boy entered, ignoring the look he got from Sirius. He looked around his age, had messy near-black hair, and dark skin. A pair of circular glasses rested on his nose, and he had a look on his face that would make even the most laid back of teachers paranoid. Sirius watched as the boy put his trunk under the seat opposite him and then proceeded to take up the entire seat, stretching across it like a cat.</p><p> </p><p>“What-”</p><p> </p><p>“James. Potter. Nice to meet you, too,” the boy, now named, held out his hand from where he sat, grinning.</p><p> </p><p>“Sirius,” he responded, taking the hand and shaking it.</p><p> </p><p>“Nice name. Lots of joke opportunities,” James said, nodding in approval. “Anyways. You look like a first year. What house do you think you’ll be in?”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius wondered if it was really that obvious that he was a first year, or if James was just a good guesser. Either way, that was rich coming from a boy who still looked ten.</p><p> </p><p>“Uh.. I don’t know,” he said, his eyes shifting to look out the window as the train began moving.</p><p> </p><p>James raised an eyebrow. “Well, I’m going into Gryffindor for sure. It’s the best house <em> ever-” </em></p><p> </p><p>Sirius listened to James ramble on and on about Gryffindor and how amazing it was, his heart sinking with every word. At least this kid knew his house was great. The only thing Sirius knew about Slytherin was that it was renowned for pureblood families- in other words, jampacked with future Death Eaters. He had to uphold the Black family’s reputation, and all that.</p><p> </p><p>“- I think you’d make a good Gryffindor. Your hair’s already halfway to being a mane,” James said, his tone joking.</p><p> </p><p>“Really?” Sirius tilted his head, his eyebrows drawing together in a look of confusion. “I never thought of that.”</p><p> </p><p>“You should think of it, then. Maybe if you see yourself there, the Sorting Hat’ll put you there.”</p><p> </p><p>“Does it do that?” Sirius had never been told that. It was always that he <em> had </em> to be in Slytherin, there was never a debate. It was almost scary to think what his family’s reaction would be if he wasn’t in the house they all had been in. Then again, it would be a huge punch in the face to his parents, which seemed hilarious.</p><p> </p><p>James nodded. “My dad says it did for him when he was a first year.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius pondered this. He decided he liked the idea. Hey, maybe he could prove that the Black family wasn’t all asshats obsessed with bloodlines and power. Maybe he could prove that he had an after-school plan <em>other</em> than Straight To Azkaban. That would be cool.</p><p> </p><p>---</p><p> </p><p>Hogwarts, though he’d seen pictures, was unlike anything Sirius had ever seen. First off, the first years were led to the castle by a <em> gigantic </em> man- James whispered that he <em> had </em>to be at least half giant. Once they got to the entrance hall, he handed them off to a woman wearing dark green robes. He said, “The firs’-years, Professor McGonagall.”</p><p> </p><p>Professor McGonagall nodded, dismissing him and turning to lead them down the entrance hall. Once they got to the end, she stopped, allowing Sirius to get a better look at her. She seemed to be in her mid-forties. Her greying hair and the lines on her face made it evident that she was aging, but her eyes made her seem younger at heart. Sirius knew she’d either be the best teacher or the absolute worst.</p><p> </p><p>“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony. While you are here, your house is like your family. The four houses are Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn you points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the House Cup. In a few minutes, we will enter the Great Hall, and the Sorting Ceremony will begin. I suggest you try to smarten yourselves up before then.” With that, she exited the Entrance Hall, leaving everyone else to their own devices.</p><p> </p><p>James beamed, rocking back and forth on his heels and toes. Most other people were quiet, but James was like a ticking bomb, like any minute he’d explode from all the things going through his head.</p><p> </p><p>Soon enough, McGonagall returned to lead the first-years into the Great Hall. The minute they stepped in, several students gasped. Sirius heard about seven different people say “Woah.”</p><p> </p><p>The Great Hall was lit by thousands of candles, which were floating mid-air under a ceiling that Sirius knew to be enchanted to look like the night sky. Four long tables took up most of the space, with space in between for walking, and another table sat horizontally at the far end of the hall, where all the teachers sat. The Headmaster, Professor Dumbledore, sat in his seat in the middle of the teachers’ table, smiling slightly as he watched the students enter the Hall. Many other kids already sat at their tables. They all went quiet when the first-years walked in.</p><p> </p><p>Professor McGonagall led them to the other end of the hall, where a stool sat on the steps leading to the teachers’ table. A black, worn hat rested on the stool, and several of the first-years gasped when it opened its mouth and began to sing. Sirius tuned out most of the song, sighing with relief once it was over. <em> Yeah, yeah, quit the poetry, let’s just get this over with! </em>McGonagall unrolled a long piece of parchment, no doubt holding the name of every first year in the hall.</p><p> </p><p>“Abbey, Mina!”</p><p> </p><p>And so, the Sorting began. Sirius knew that he shouldn’t try to tune this out- he might miss his own name due to its closeness to the beginning of the alphabet. So, he sat through every A last name, and began to mentally gather himself once he heard “Baker, Joey!” called out. Eventually, they arrived at his name.</p><p> </p><p>“Black, Sirius!”</p><p> </p><p>People muttered. “Black? Another one?” Sirius ignored them. James pat him on the shoulder, grinning and wishing him luck. With a short, determined nod, Sirius waded through the crowd of eleven year olds and sat on the stool, waiting for McGonagall to place the hat on his head.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Oh, another one of you. Well. S-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em> Don’t you fucking dare, </em> Sirius thought.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Really, now? Hmm.. I guess, if you’re so against it.. GRYFFINDOR!” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Sirius grinned. He <em> really </em> hadn’t expected that to work. But there was no time to sit around, looking surprised. He pulled off the hat and gave it back to McGonagall, running to the Gryffindor table, which was filled with people cheering and clapping.</p><p> </p><p>Many people were sorted into Gryffindor before James’s name was called. <em> Camacho, Kevin </em> . <em> Castro, Owen. Evans, Lily. Howell, Theresa. Leiva, Erin. Lupin, Remus. Pettigrew, Peter. </em> Just to name a few.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, McGonagall called out <em> Potter, James, </em> and he rushed up to the stool. The Hat sorted him into Gryffindor immediately, laughing even when he was taken off of James’s head. James shot up and sprinted to the table, taking a seat in between Sirius and a redheaded girl.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, I’m James,” he said to her, holding his hand out.</p><p> </p><p>She laughed. “I can tell. I’m Lily.” Lily took his hand and shook it.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius knew this was going to be an interesting few years.</p>
