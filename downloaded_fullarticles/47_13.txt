    <p dir="ltr">The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the Hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Ah Potter. </em>A voice whispered. <em>Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, my goodness, yes- and a thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting…So where shall I put you?</em></p><p dir="ltr">“Not Slytherin,” Harry thought, thinking of Malfoy’s pinched face and Hagrid telling him about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named back in the Leaky Cauldron.</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">Before Harry could respond, if he were even meant to, another voice seemed to whisper something that Harry couldn’t quite make out. He had an inkling that the confusion he felt wasn’t entirely his own.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>This is highly unusual, sir. </em>The hat almost sounded doubtful and Harry wondered if the hat was even talking to him anymore. <em>I don’t appreciate interference. This is a private, honored tradition…</em></p><p dir="ltr">More whispers. Then, <em>Very well. Let it be: SLYTHERIN!</em></p><p dir="ltr">The last bit rang in Harry’s eats so loudly that he knew the whole hall had heard it. His heart sank and he moved out from under the hat even before McGonagall had lifted it, though maybe that had something to do with the way she was gaping at him. She wasn’t alone. The entire hall was silent. Harry took an uncertain step towards the table Malfoy had gone to. The table still hadn’t started cheering.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry met Ron’s eyes. Ron looked shocked, but he blinked and shrugged when he caught Harry looking at him.</p><p dir="ltr">“Go ahead, Potter,” McGonagall finally said, finally shaking herself from her reverie, “Take a seat.”</p><p dir="ltr">At the staff table, Dumbledore began to clap and the other teachers joined in. Harry hurried to join his table as McGonagall called the next name.</p><p dir="ltr">He took a seat next to the dark-haired girl that had been sorted just before him, who stared at him with a mix of surprise and reproach. Nevertheless, she passed him a silver and green tie. She and the others had already put theirs on, but Harry had never had to use a tie before so instead he twisted it in his lap.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry sat there miserably as the sorting went on until Ron was called to the stool. He turned back to watch, feeling ridiculously hopeful that his new friend might join him. But the hat had barely touched Ron’s fiery hair before it shouted, “Gryffindor!” Harry watched glumly as Ron jogged to join his brothers at the cheering scarlet table.</p><p dir="ltr">“Zabini, Blaise,” was sorted last into Slytherin and took the seat across from Harry. McGonagall lifted the stool and disappeared through the door behind the staff table as Dumbledore stood.</p><p dir="ltr">“Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!” Dumbledore took his seat and then the plates on the tables were suddenly filled with food.</p><p dir="ltr">It was more food than he’d seen in his life and looked a lot better than the sort of foods that Aunt Petunia usually set in front of him. He loaded his plate with chicken, potatoes, and sausages. There was also an odd little bottle labelled pumpkin juice that he took a cautious sip of, though it tasted more like it should be a flavor of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavoured Beans.</p><p dir="ltr">“Good lord, Potter. Planning to empty Hogwarts of all its stores?” Malfoy said nastily, “I’m surprised you could still be hungry considering all the rubbish you and Weasley had on the train.”</p><p dir="ltr">Harry felt wrong-footed about coming to Hogwarts for the first time. He slowed down though it was a bit difficult considering the Dursleys hadn’t been very generous to him ever since Hagrid had busted down their door to give Harry his letter.</p><p dir="ltr">On Pansy Parkinson’s other side, Malfoy boasted loudly about the broom his father would be buying him, between snide remarks about which Wizarding family would be most disappointed after the sorting and how the Weasleys’ robes were <em>especially </em>worn this year.</p><p dir="ltr">It was hard for Harry to see Ron through the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables, but Harry felt very sick that his new friend hadn’t turned to look at him even once. He thought they’d gotten along pretty well on the train, although he didn’t exactly have a lot of experience in the friends department. Still, he knew he would rather be sitting with Ron across the room than here with Malfoy.</p><p dir="ltr">“You don’t have to look so disappointed, Potter,” Parkinson said, elegantly cutting her chicken, “No one here is exactly pleased to have you either, you know.”</p><p dir="ltr">Harry scowled at her.</p><p dir="ltr">“But, “She continued, “We’d be dumb to ignore the opportunity this presents for us. And you’ll be sharing a house with us for seven years after all. It’ll be a lot smoother if we at least get on a bit.”</p><p dir="ltr">Harry would have groaned aloud if he thought it wouldn’t draw any more negative attention. He hadn’t thought about that yet, but McGonagall had said so, hadn’t she? He’d spend all of his time with the Slytherins, dormitory and classes and all.</p><p dir="ltr">“Not everyone has to worship him because of something he did when he was a baby. He’ll have to get used to not being the center of attention.” Malfoy sneered.</p><p dir="ltr">“You don’t have to talk about me like I’m not here,” Harry snapped.</p><p dir="ltr">Parkinson raised an eyebrow at him, “If you want us to include you in the conversation, you’ve got to contribute, you know. You’re worse than Vincent.”</p><p dir="ltr">She offered him her hand.</p><p dir="ltr">“Pansy Parkinson. If you’re so set on making enemies in your own house, you’ll find I’d make a very good ally. I know a great deal about everything.” She said.</p><p dir="ltr">“That means she knows all the gossip,” Zabini said in a bored voice.</p><p dir="ltr">Parkinson scoffed, “It’s more than gossip. You should be able to recognize the importance-“</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah, yeah. Pansy thinks she’s a proper reporter because her mother is an international journalist for the British Ministry of Magic.” Zabini said.</p><p dir="ltr">“She’s very respected,” Parkinson said to Harry, as if that should matter to him, “That’s Blaise Zabini. You’ve met Draco, obviously, and Crabbe and Goyle. Theodore Nott’s on your other side, and Daphne’s down there by Marcus Flint. He’s Quidditch captain, if you’re interested in that at all…”</p><p dir="ltr">“How do you all know each other already?” Harry asked.</p><p dir="ltr">Parkinson waved her hand, “We see each other at all the Ministry events. Everyone’s connected in the Wizarding World.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Everyone important,” Malfoy muttered.</p><p dir="ltr">“And several of our families are very close. The Malfoys, Notts, and Parkinsons are all listed on the Sacred Twenty-Eight, you know.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I don’t know why you keep bragging about that. You know the Longbottoms and Weasleys are on the list too.” Zabini pointed out.</p><p dir="ltr">“Ron’s on there?” Harry asked, interested at last.</p><p dir="ltr">“For now, though it’s only a matter of time before they’re taken off. That family’s the biggest bunch of blood traitors in Europe,” Parkinson explained.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s the only thing they come first in,” Malfoy said spitefully, “That and poverty, I suppose.”</p><p dir="ltr">Harry scowled again and ignored him, instead looking back across the hall. He could see Ron talking to one of his brothers and one of the ghosts that had come into the hall. At the staff table, Hagrid waved when Harry caught his eye. Harry waved back feebly, but he felt even worse for disappointing him too.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, you’ve got to be kidding,” Malfoy said loudly, when he’d caught site of Harry’s wave.</p><p dir="ltr">“What exactly is the Sacred Twenty-Eight?” Harry asked Parkinson pointedly.</p><p dir="ltr">The rest of the meal passed quickly, with Harry mostly listening to Parkinson gossip about anything from pureblood politics to which Slytherins were most likely to make the Quidditch team this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Desert ended with the best treacle tart Harry had ever had (Mrs. Figg had made some once and ended up having to take one of her many cats to the vet) and soon they were following their prefect down to the dungeon to get ready for their first day of classes tomorrow.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Harry’s first week at Hogwarts was spent being steered around by Pansy as she bragged to everyone who listened that she was best friends with Harry Potter.</p><p dir="ltr">It was… different than how he’d been treated at the Dursley’s and it might have been better in some ways, but it didn’t make Harry feel good. It felt more like he was being used and Pansy wasn’t exactly super pleasant to be around even when they were alone. She was especially annoying when she treated him like an idiot. Which was all the time.</p><p dir="ltr">He started making a point of avoiding Pansy just to stay out of the public eye which meant that he spent a great deal sitting with Theodore Nott, who was mostly silent but at least he didn’t parade him around. Or glare at him constantly as Malfoy, and thus Crabbe and Goyle, were prone to do.</p><p dir="ltr">Ron, for the most part, turned scarlet whenever he and Harry exchanged glance, but he returned Harry’s wave with a hesitant one of his own. Harry gathered his courage on the first day of Potions, sidestepped Pansy, and walked up to Ron’s table where he had set his cauldron up next to Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan.</p><p dir="ltr">“Erm, hello.” Ron said mildly when Harry stopped uncertainly next to him.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hi,” Harry said, “Would you mind if maybe I sat with you?” Harry asked.</p><p dir="ltr">Ron glanced behind Harry, presumably at the Slytherins who had gathered at the front of the class. Pansy and Malfoy were openly glaring at them, but Harry didn’t care.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry turned back to Ron, “Look, we got along on the train, right? Before either of us were sorted. I know there’s the weird thing between out houses, but as far as I’m concerned, I still want to be friends.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Go on, then.” Ron said, shifting his bag off the chair next to him, “Better you than Hermione.”</p><p dir="ltr">Harry breathed a sigh of relief and took the seat, pulling out his potions book, “Thanks, I think I’d have offed myself if I had to sit with Pansy or Nott again.” Harry said just as Snape swept through the room.</p><p dir="ltr">Predictably, potions went badly but it was hard to be daunted when he and Ron walked out of the classroom talking as easily as they had on the train. Harry ended up inviting Ron with him to go visit Hagrid, which would probably cause Pansy to have an aneurysm if she’d heard.</p><p dir="ltr">All in all, the week ended in a high note that got progressively better as Harry learned the layout of the castle and spent more time with Ron. That is, until they got to flying class.</p><p dir="ltr">He and the rest of the Slytherins had already arrived. The others had picked over the brooms, looking for the straightest and calmest brooms while Harry picked a random broom as far from Malfoy as he could.</p><p dir="ltr">The Gryffindors arrived. Ron and Hermione Granger were arguing loudly, Ron’s face getting steadily redder and Hermione’s hair seeming to get bushier. Ron joined Harry at his broom furiously.</p><p dir="ltr">“What are you two arguing about, now?” Harry asked, watching Granger stop oddly as she had almost continued following Ron. Seeing Harry watching her, she turned on her heel and stood by Neville Longbottom, her face pinking slightly.</p><p dir="ltr">“She’s bloody annoying, you should share Transfiguration with her.” Ron said, shaking her head.</p><p dir="ltr">“Quiet, now,” Madam Hooch called briskly, taking her place at the head of the two lines, “Does everyone have a broom? Put your hand out over your broom and say, ‘up’.”</p><p dir="ltr">Feeling a bit dumb, Harry stuck out his hand. His broom zipped straight to his hand. Across the grass, Malfoy’s broom did the same. Next to him, Ron repeated a bit louder, only for his broom to turn over sharply on the ground. Neville’s didn’t even move.</p><p dir="ltr">Madam Hooch went around, showing them all the correct way to hold the broom, and then they were finally able to kick off the ground. Neville did a bit more than that.</p><p dir="ltr">As Madam Hooch escorted Neville to the Hospital Wing, Malfoy bent and scooped a clear, glass ball from the grass.</p><p dir="ltr">“Look, it’s that stupid thing Longbottom opened at breakfast. I think I’ll put it somewhere for him to find- up a tree?” Malfoy said gleefully.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry didn’t know what it was, but he hardly felt that mattered. He’d had enough of Malfoy’s antics.</p><p dir="ltr">“Give it here,” Harry said sharply. Malfoy looked at him, his mouth curling into a smirk.</p><p dir="ltr">“Come and get it, Potter,” He said. He leapt onto his broomtick and took off.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry mounted his own broom, but Hermione Granger, who Harry hadn’t personally said a word to since the train, rushed up to him and grabbed his sleeve.</p><p dir="ltr">“No! Madam Hooch said not to move. You’ll get us all into trouble,” She shouted.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry shook her off and kicked off the ground. Flying was easier than he’d expected- in fact he could have whooped with joy at how fun- and effortless for him- it was. He heard Ron whoop and scattered cheers from the Gryffindors as he turned to face Malfoy.</p><p dir="ltr">“Give it here,” Harry called, feeling confident, “Or I’ll knock you off your broom.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, yeah?” Malfoy said, trying to sneer but looking worried.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry shot at Malfoy, who jerked out of the way and shouted, “Catch it if you can, then!”</p><p dir="ltr">He threw the ball high into the air. Without thinking, Harry leant forward and hurtled towards the ball. He caught it a moment before it hit the ground. He had a moment sitting in the grass to feel proud of himself before-</p><p dir="ltr">“HARRY POTTER!”</p><p dir="ltr">McGonagall was running towards them from the castle.</p><p dir="ltr">“Never, in all my time at Hogwarts,“ Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously,”how dare you, might have broken your neck,“</p><p dir="ltr">“It wasn’t his fault, Professor–“ Padma Patil protested and Harry looked at her in surprise. He hadn’t expected her to stand up for someone in Slytherin. Though she’d probably been thinking the same thing about him.</p><p dir="ltr">“Be quiet, Miss Patil–“</p><p dir="ltr">“But Malfoy–“ Ron started. </p><p dir="ltr">“That’s enough, Mr Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.” McGongall said sharply.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry glanced back at the others as he went. Ron looked sympathetic, Granger scandalized, and Malfoy was looking particularly triumphant.</p><p dir="ltr">He followed McGonagall to her office silently. His first few weeks at Hogwarts had been pretty hit-and-miss but he thought it would get better now that he was making friends outside of Slytherin. Even if it wouldn’t, he didn’t think Slytherin was worse than the Dursley’s. He felt sick just thinking about going back.</p><p dir="ltr">“Sit down, Potter.” McGonagall said briskly, and Harry sat numbly in the chair as she settled across from him at her desk.</p><p dir="ltr">McGonagall regarded him, and Harry did his best to look contrite.</p><p dir="ltr">“Potter, I certainly wish you had been sorted into Gryffindor,” McGonagall finally said.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry looked up at her. That sounded like an odd way to word his expulsion.</p><p dir="ltr">She looked less angry now but definitely disappointed.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re a natural flyer. Was that your first time on a broomstick?” At Harry’s nod, she shook her head, “Unbelievable! And here I thought Gryffindor would be able to break Slytherin’s winning streak.”</p><p dir="ltr">Harry had no clue what to say. McGonagall’s eyes suddenly softened.</p><p dir="ltr">“Your father would have been proud," she said. "He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.”</p><p dir="ltr">Harry was stunned.</p><p dir="ltr">“Listen, Potter, if you were in Gryffindor, I would put you on the Quidditch team this year if I could. I’m afraid Severus wouldn’t be so willing. Keep that in mind for next year. I will keep this between us for now, but another risky act like that…I can’t promise Severus won’t find out.”</p><p dir="ltr"> “You’re letting me off?” Harry asked, astounded.</p><p dir="ltr">“No, Mr. Potter, I most certainly am not.” She said sternly, “10 points from Slytherin and besides that, I think it might be in your best interests to at least be civil with Mr. Malfoy. It’s very hard to share a living space with a rival.”</p><p dir="ltr">Harry frowned but McGonagall was handing the remembrall back to him.</p><p dir="ltr">“Do me a favor and give that back to Longbottom. Godric knows he’ll need it.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“Draco,” Pansy sniffed the next morning at breakfast. Draco looked up from his toast.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry Potter was walking into the Great Hall, dressed in his robes and with his school bag over his shoulder. He made his way to the end of the Slytherin table to sit alone.</p><p dir="ltr">“No way. I thought McGonagall had him for sure,” Draco said, craning his head to stare. Harry was now waving across the hall at Ron who was flashing him a thumbs up.</p><p dir="ltr">“He <em>is </em>Harry Potter. Maybe it was a bit much to expect he’d be expelled within the first month,” Pansy said reasonably.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s a bit much to think he’d be expelled at all, and you should give it up,” Blaise said, “I know you have a weird idolizing/rivalry thing going on, but he’s not bad. He’s doing well in our classes, all things considered, and-“</p><p dir="ltr">“Shut up,” Malfoy hissed, “He’s arrogant and full of himself and-“</p><p dir="ltr">“Are you sure we’re not talking about you?” Blaise said coolly.</p><p dir="ltr">“You can be a little prickly.” Pansy said.</p><p dir="ltr">“I am not prickly, and he is not Slytherin material. Do you not realize what our parents would think if we become all buddy-buddy with Harry Potter? The one who ruined most of these people’s families,” Draco gestured around at the other Slytherins.</p><p dir="ltr">“Please, you’ve hardly been ruined.” Blaise scoffed, “Your dad is basically Fudge’s pet. You’re as rich as ever.”</p><p dir="ltr">“And mom prefers journaling, I can tell. I don’t think I’d prefer to have dad home either.” Pansy said.</p><p dir="ltr">“Don’t even get me started on the journaling,” Draco warned.</p><p dir="ltr">“Get over yourself. He’s here, and if you think anyone’s going to kick him out, then you’re mad.” Blaise picked up his bag.</p><p dir="ltr">“You know I hate when he’s right, but this is one of those times.” Pansy said consolingly, “I don’t like him either, especially since he prefers hanging with</p><p dir="ltr">Weasley. But it doesn’t make sense to keep making trouble. Sooner or later, you’ll be caught in the fire.” Pansy took one last sip of her orange juice before following Blaise.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of the table, Harry got up and met Weasley at the door. Before he could think it through, Draco pushed away from the table and hurried after them.</p><p dir="ltr"> “Bragging about how you’re the next teacher’s pet, Potter?” Malfoy called, against his (well, Blaise’s) better judgement.</p><p dir="ltr">Ron muttered something to Harry before they both turned. Harry looked irritated, but smug enough that Malfoy was sure that he hadn’t gotten in trouble the day before. His hair, at least, was as messy as ever.</p><p dir="ltr">“Back off, Malfoy. You’d think you’d give it a rest after yesterday.” Harry snapped.</p><p dir="ltr">“What? That little show? I could have caught that in my sleep,” Draco had actually been stunned. He hadn’t thought Harry had ever been on a broom before, “Though not all of us have dead parents and scars to keep us out of trouble.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You sure do enough wriggling out of trouble of your own,” Weasley retorted, “I guess that’s what happens when your parents are snakes.</p><p dir="ltr">“I don’t <em>wriggle</em>,” Draco said, affronted.</p><p dir="ltr">“Then prove it. Wizard’s Duel. Tonight.” Weasley said.</p><p dir="ltr"> “I don’t have anything to prove to you, Weasel. Maybe if we were to have a battle of pigs. Your family would really take the cake.” Draco sneered.</p><p dir="ltr">“Then I’ll do it,” Harry said quickly, grabbing Weasley’s shoulder.</p><p dir="ltr">“Have you even heard of a Wizard’s duel?” Draco scoffed.</p><p dir="ltr">“Of course, he has. I’ll be his second. Who’s yours?” Weasley said.</p><p dir="ltr">Draco considered his friends, “Crabbe. The trophy room at midnight. Let me know if you chicken out so I don’t waste my time.” </p><p dir="ltr">He flounced away. Blaise would be exasperated, Pansy disapproving, Crabbe excited. It was a little quick for another scheme, but Draco couldn’t help himself. Something about Harry Potter drove him up the wall.</p>
