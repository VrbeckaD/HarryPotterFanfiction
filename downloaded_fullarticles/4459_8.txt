          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Fred Weasley! George Weasley!”</p>
<p>“We’re done for,” George whispered shakily. Fred shuddered.</p>
<p>“Show yourselves!”</p>
<p>George closed his eyes, expression mirroring Fred’s apprehension.</p>
<p>“We could run away,” Fred suggested hopefully.</p>
<p>George shook his head. “She’ll still find us, and it’ll be even worse.”</p>
<p>Fred knew he was right. He gripped George’s hand. “To death?”</p>
<p>George nodded grimly. “To death!”</p>
<p>They left the shed to face Molly. The smell of cinnamon permeated the air.</p>
<p>“Explain,” she demanded. Icing dripped from the Burrow’s now deliciously baked gingerbread walls.</p>
<p>“At least it’s not on fire?” Fred squeaked.</p>
<p>Molly’s frown deepened.</p>
<p>“Right! Fixing it now!”</p></div>
