          <div class="userstuff"><p>The moment he stands before that lake, he knows that this is it.</p>
<p>Years of something deep and quiet slumbers forward from the marrow of his bones and finally, this was what it was waiting for.</p>
<p>He doesn't want to die, no one ever really does, he thinks.</p>
<p>But the truth of the matter is that he's known that this was coming, as the years went by—<em>as that echo of death resonated within him every year he got to live</em>—</p>
<p>Maybe this could've been avoided, or maybe that's just wild wishful thinking on his part.</p>
<p>He wonders if his life will flash before his eyes, or if he's going to regret this, but the crux of the matter is that he doesn't quite feel, well, anything.</p>
<p>It's hard to put into words, but this was the one certainty he could believe in after he lost—<em>Siri</em>—anything that he could put faith into.</p>
<p>Or maybe he never put faith into anything, in the first place.</p>
<p>Half the time he doesn't know if what he's feeling is actually real, or if he's out here just emulating whatever emotions he sees that matches what is societally correct.</p>
<p>Maybe he was never human.</p>
<p>It seems like a running hypothesis that only gains more and more truth as the poison floods down his throat and into every crevice of his body.</p>
<p>He still, even in the end, is incapable of feeling.</p>
<p>Except he is—<em>he's scared, and tired, and lost, and lonely, and he wants Sirius</em>—but maybe that's also a lie.</p>
<p>He's spent so long knowing what will happen, of death built into his very existence, that maybe it ate out everything that ever made Regulus Black, <em>Regulus Black</em>.</p>
<p>A shell of a human.</p>
<p>The thought would've made him laugh if his throat wasn't preoccupied with screaming apologies that he doesn't know or remember having hidden in his thoughts.</p>
<p>Really, in the end, wasn't he just a farce attempting to love?</p>
<p>Black spots glitter across his vision.</p>
<p>Well. It's almost time. There's only one thing left to do.</p>
<p>Scrounging any energy left in that pitiful shell of his, he tells—<em>his best friend, the only existence wherein the truth of his being will be known unto the universe</em>—Kreacher that he must leave.</p>
<p>The small being that houses the knowledge of both himself and the ending parts of a story that is left to be told, cries.</p>
<p>Oh, you poor thing, a part of his soul mutters.</p>
<p>You should not cry over such a pitiful shell, an existence of which has only ever weaved through life in an attempt to end it.</p>
<p>He thinks that something in that beating heart of his, of the crawling peace that's slowly encroaching on him, warms at the gesture.</p>
<p>Regulus Black—<em>or whatever that was that occupied that body</em>—blinks.</p>
<p>And then anything that is alive in that damned cave—</p>
<p>is gone.</p></div>
