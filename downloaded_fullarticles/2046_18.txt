    <p>Prologue</p><p>Salazar Slytherin was dying. He knew he would have only a few days to live, maybe a week. If he was lucky and careful with his magic, he would see a month, but he was not careful. He would die here and now.</p><p>He walked another round around the emerald. The great uncut stone pulsed with Slytherin's magic. The runes written with his own blood were smoking slightly. He had taken great care with them, blending the old Nordic runes with the runes of his homeland India. After another round, he looked to his third wife. She was beautiful, vibrant, young and pregnant with twins. Twins, who would never learn magic – because he was cursed.</p><p>The curse was the reason he was willing to die, was willing to risk his very magic and soul for this one chance … the chance that maybe one day his heir would survive to claim his title, family and magic.</p><p>They say that you relive your life when dying, but Salazar relieved only the most crucial part of it: It was shortly after the completion of Hogwarts (why Helga insisted on this name, was beyond him), he was called to aid a muggle woman. At least that was, what he thought she was. Now he knew, this woman did indeed have magic but too little to name her a witch. Her 3 daughters were ill and asked him to produce a remedy, but by the time he arrived, the eldest daughter was beyond his help and the younger was not much better. And even if he had had the time to administer a cure, he neither knew, what ailed them nor which potion or remedy would save those women. And without enough magic to aid them, he could not even mitigate the pain they were undoubtedly feeling. The eldest died shortly after his arrival and he knew the other women would be following by nightfall. When he told the mother of this, she was devastated or so he thought. When he left after having guided the last daughter to death he found her in her backyard on a small patch of dried grass, a bloody knife in her hand. „If I have to live without that, which is most precious to me, you will have to live without that too. You have refused to save my daughters and now you will lose your sons and your magic! For 3 times 3 times 3 generations no child from your loins will know magic! With my last breath, I will it so and so mote it be!“  She died then and there, her weak magic having burnt her core and taken her life.</p><p>When he came back to his home and wife, both his sons were dead, no longer able to live without magic. His stepson Salazar – his nephew in reality and named after him – had to see the only brothers die he knew. Afterwards, his wife was never the same, wasting away in her grief. He waited until the funeral and until Salazar was in school and left, to find a cure. </p><p>His second wife, a wonderful vibrant hedge-witch, who gave him two daughters and a son -all without magic - died in childbirth while he was with an old mystic. He left his children with their family in India (the name Slytherin should not be linked to them) and went back to Europe. </p><p>And now he was here, in the  Alps to die in the mad hope to save his bloodline. He knew that it was a long shot, he had sacrificed most of his magic in his mad search, but if one squib could do it then he should be able even more so. Death magic was <i> powerful </i>. He <i> had </i>  to save his bloodline and with the magic in his blood, bone and very soul, he might just have to tools to do this. 27 generations were a long time, but if his calculations were correct, his bloodline would be protected until his heir claimed his or her inheritance at least. He made the protections as airtight as possible – no illness, curse, poison or other natural or unnatural circumstance will extinguish his bloodline.</p><p>Gerard was the witness and would care for his wife and children. He had supervised the ritual and had checked the runes and he would, later on, adapt this ritual for his own needs, as the seers of his house have foreseen its end. An end, which would unbalance Europe. And so, Gerard would use their own ritual to enrich the magic of his house and maybe save it from abuse. With enough magic, it would become sentient and should choose the members of its house itself. This house should survive the destruction of the family.
