    <p>Newt didn’t know how any of this happened. One day he was traveling through America, visiting a friend. The next, he was sitting in an interrogation room with his life’s belongings strewn across the smooth reflective table in front of him.</p><p>It turns out that one loose niffler gets you arrested.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Why are you here, Mr. Scamander?” the man opposite him scraped a chair out from the underside of the table, sitting down with his hands folded in front of him.</p><p>Newt looked up from his hands, which were handcuffed. He could feel the electric buzz of the magic that kept them tightly secured.</p><p>“Travel,” he answered curtly, if not a little rudely, and he winced inside with immediate regret as the other man’s brows furrowed. Newt thinks about Arizona, about visiting Frank, and about how many beautiful sketches he could have done if he were there. </p><p>“Then what, might I ask,” the man waves his arms over the scattered supplies and various items on the table, “is all of this for?” He re-folds his hands and sets them down on the cool metal table and pauses for a moment. “And why do you have a bona fide zoo in your suitcase?”</p><p>The man tilts his head and raises his eyebrows, waiting for an answer.</p><p>Newt’s eyes lower back down to his things on the table, and then back to his lap; his sketch pads were haphazardly tossed down, a few vines of charcoal were snapped and left stains on the surface, and the two aurors who had gone through everything had even had the audacity to rip out a few sketches. The room was silent apart from the monotonous whirr of the lights above the grated ceiling.</p><p>Newt let out a mild huff of indignance and shifted again in his seat, “If you must know what the supplies are for, I’m an artist,” he mumbled, “the creatures are rescues, they’re not going to hurt anyone.”</p><p>The man opposite him kept his eyebrows raised, and anxiety began to well up in the pit of his stomach as his ears turned red.</p><p>Another sigh echoed, this time in frustration, “Mr. Scamander, you’re incredibly lucky that your furry little friend here didn’t cause much more than a small disturbance,” he gestured over to the left side of the room where the niffler sat in a small animal cage. “You’re also lucky that there was no property damage and that we only had to obliviate-“</p><p>Just then the door to the interrogation room screeched open, and a small mousy woman burst into the room looking frantic.</p><p>“Mr. Graves I-“ she stopped in her tracks and suddenly noticed Newt, who now resembled a deer in headlights. “Oh. OH. Mr. Graves I am so sorry, but-”</p><p>“Get out with it, Goldstein.” Graves broke apart his interlocked hands and used one of them to rub his face in exasperation.</p><p>“The case…” she had approximately twelve manila folders in her arms, each one overflowing with papers, which were now starting to float to the ground around her feet one by one.</p><p>“Is it urgent?” Graves continued to massage his forehead with his left thumb and forefinger.</p><p>“I’m afraid so, sir,” she began, taking a few careful steps further into the room, “another auror has gone missing.”</p><p>Graves didn’t sigh this time, he just looked down at the table and then suddenly got up from his seat, both hands now splayed on the table.</p><p>“You,” he pointed his gaze directly at Newt. “You’re coming with me.”</p><p>He scraped his chair back under the table, walked quickly over to Newt, and lifted him up by the elbow. The sudden contact startled him and made his cheeks burn. Following the smaller auror, while dodging some flying papers that were falling out of her many folders, Graves escorted Newt through the sharp turns they took through the minimally decorated hallways until they reached the doorway to an open room which was bustling with activity. The top of the doorframe read <em>Department of Magical Law Enforcement.</em></p><p>At the very front of the room, slightly off to the left, sat a secretary. Newt watched as Graves wordlessly took a folder that was handed to him as he swept by. Several cluttered desks were unevenly placed throughout the large room, they looked as if they were once neatly arranged in rows, but based on the sheer amount of paperwork on top of them they were too far gone to be rearranged. Ten or twelve aurors were bustling around from desk to desk, talking excitedly and turning over paperwork. They all looked like they hadn’t slept in a few days. Newt grimaced at the pungent stench of burnt coffee seeping in from an adjacent office.</p><p>Auror Goldstein pulled the doorknob to a closed door, and Newt immediately noticed that this office was in heavy contrast to its surroundings. The hardwood floors didn’t have a scratch on them, the shelves along the walls were neatly organized, and the desk was spotless. The young auror rushed into the room and practically threw all of her notes and folders down onto the polished ebony desk. Newt swore that he could see Graves wince out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>“He hasn’t killed in over three years,” she was frantically sifting through dozens of slightly crumpled pieces of parchment with hand-written notes on them, “I don’t know why he suddenly decides to show up in America and kidnap <em>Mendoza</em> of all people-“</p><p>“Tina,” Graves calmly closed his eyes for a beat, “relax.”</p><p>“I’m sorry sir, but… all we have is a name.” She paused, and threw up her hands in defeat. “And a handful of poorly handled no-maj witness accounts. We’re practically banking on nothing.”</p><p>Newt had a feeling, deep down in his gut. He knew that he was about to get roped into something that he really should not be involved with. He felt Graves’ eyes boring a hole into the side of his skull.</p><p>“I think,” Graves turned fully to him, “that we may have run into the perfect opportunity here.”</p><p>Newt felt his forehead start to get damp. <em>Oh no</em>.</p><p>“Mr. Scamander here is an artist, or so he’s told me.” Graves turned back to Tina with a slight smile and his hands in his pockets, “We could dig through the witness accounts in the pensieve and he might be able to give us a sketch.”</p><p>Newt looked up at him, slightly emboldened, “I’m sorry sir, but I don’t work for free.”</p><p>Graves took his hands out of his pockets and gestured to Newt’s hands as if to ask him to lift them up. Newt did so very cautiously, and Graves waved his hand over the cuffs and they unlocked and vanished.</p><p>“Then we’ll commission you for your work,” he stated curtly, “I’ve looked through some of your sketches and I’m quite confident that you can provide us what we need. All of your confiscated supplies will be returned, of course, and any additional supplies and housing will be provided.”</p><p>Newt stood rooted to the spot, and couldn’t help but question if this was really an opportunity that garnered his attention. Living out of a suitcase was of course not ideal, and the idea of new art supplies and a comfortable bed to sleep in was drawing him in.</p><p>“I-“ he stuttered for a moment, “Only if my creatures are returned safely and unharmed.”</p><p>“Of course.” Graves turned back to the smaller auror behind the desk and gestured a hand in her direction, “This is Tina Goldstein, an auror in my department. You’ll primarily be working with her on this case. I’m also afraid I haven’t properly introduced myself.”</p><p>Graves had his hands in his pockets again and looked back over at Newt. “Percival Graves, head of magical security. I do apologize for arresting you.”</p><p>At that, Graves had a slight crook to the corner of his mouth. Newt’s heart rate quickened, he knew he was in for some trouble.</p>
