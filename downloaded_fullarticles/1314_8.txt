  <p>Hermione Granger screamed as she felt the heat of the flames on her face. The fire looked like a demonic entity with tentacle-like flames erupting all over; anything that crossed their path swallowed by their fiery grip. she dissolved into a coughing fit, her lungs burning with smoke. Distant screams could be heard over the roar of the fire. Hermione cried, shielding herself as best as she could, while she searched for her parents in the rapidly crumbling house. She could hear her mother's screams calling out to her, telling her to leave the house, to save herself. But she could not leave them to die in the blazing inferno. She made her way to her parents' bedroom to find the door already on fire. She peaked from the window and saw her mother clutching her husband to her bosom. Hermione could see that her mother had a huge wound in her left leg, probably something burning had fallen on her, and she was also coughing profusely. her father, on the other hand, was unresponsive.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Mom! Dad! Hang on, I'm coming," Hermione called out desperately. Her mother saw her then and tried to signal her to get out, but the woman was getting weaker. The lack of oxygen and abundant smoke rendering her lethargic an don the verge of losing consciousness. In utter desperation and running out of time, Hermione dragged a heavy chair from the dining room and with as much force as she could, swung the chair hard at the door. It flew open with a loud bang. Securing the blanket around herself, she started making her way towards her parents when she was suddenly grabbed from behind. "No! Let me go. Mom! Dad! she cried in anguish while her captor restrained her. "Let go, let go!" she howled while thrashing in their hold.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"We'll come back. We'll come back for them. We'll save them" the firefighter holding her tried to reassure her. He was much stronger than her and was soon dragging her out of the room. She caught her mother's eyes one last time as the dying woman mouthed to her daughter, '<em>Live for me, Darling.'</em></p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>No sooner had they stepped out of the two storyed house when with a sickening crash the house started to collapse. There was a loud explosion as the roof was thrown outwards. "Noo!!" the distressed girl cried. Hermione felt mad with grief, trying to force her way past the firemen who were blocking her as she tried to get back in the burning house. She had to go back. She had to save them. She had to save them.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>But there was nothing to save. The house was gone. Two of its three occupants gone forever. All the belongings,  everything that made the concrete structure a home were gone. All that was left behind was a grief-stricken and heartbroken orphan.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>
    <strong>A few hours later</strong>
  </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione sat in the back of the ambulance, numb with shock. She was impervious to everything going on around her. All around her the world burned. Almost all the houses on either side of the road were on fire, those people lucky enough to have not been caught in the fire already had left their homes and were seeking the safety of the open, wide road. The leftover houses would soon enough go up in flames as well and no one wanted to stay for that. The firefighters had informed the people that at least four other blocks had been razed by the fire. Nobody knew the origin of the fire and the police and the firemen seemed to be fighting a losing battle against the unstoppable fire.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The past few hours were slowly catching up to Hermione. The impenetrable barrier of grief and loss that had surrounded her was suddenly pierced by a shrill cry. She looked around wildly, the cries were heartbreaking and they seemed to be coming from somewhere near. She followed the cries to another block and came across another house on fire. The house was partially gone. But the cries were now loud enough to be recognizable as belonging to a young child. Hermione chanced a look through a window but couldn't see the source of the wails. Circling the house, she finally spotted it. A babe nestled in a blanket in a crib. The room, the nursery she guessed, was remarkably intact, considering the rest of the house.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione looked around, trying to spot someone who could help rescue the baby, but the street was deserted. Not a soul in sight. The baby's cries were now rising to fever pitch and she knew there wasn't much time left. Spotting a back door to the house, she decided that she would not let another soul be sacrificed to the raging demon wreaking havoc; especially not someone so pure and innocent. Still clutching her blanket around herself, she quickly got inside the house and headed for the baby's room.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Reaching the crib, she looked at the poor baby and wondered where its parents were. Had they left it alone? Had they also been consumed by the fire? Hermione wanted to search but knew it was a big risk. She had to get the baby out of here first. Then she could get someone to search for the parents. Hopefully, they were still alive. Sticking to her plan of action, she quickly ripped all the extra blankets and plushies from the crib until there was only one blanket left covering the baby. On the corner of the blanket she saw the name 'Tom' embroidered in bright red letters.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Tom" she whispered. As if he could understand, the babe turned his eyes to her though he didn't stop crying. "Its okay baby boy, I got you, I'll keep you safe." She quickly picked up the baby and held him against her chest. Miraculously, the baby ceased his crying. She wrapped her blanket around him for added security and then quickly got out of the house. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>It was a long time later when the house was searched for survivors. And it was too late. The young couple in the house was already dead, their bodies completely burnt. Hermione cried with Tom in her arms, who was now sleeping against her shoulder. The two newly orphaned people seeking solace in each other.</p>

  <p>Hermione had been in the makeshift hospital with Tom for two days already. When the fire had finally been controlled and the smoke started clearing, people were horrified to witness the aftermath. The fire had spread to almost ten blocks. <em>Ten blocks</em>. Around 70 houses had been completely decimated. Hundreds of people had been left homeless.  And the worst part, the cause of the vicious fire still couldn't be determined. It looked as if the fire had spontaneously started and just spread around and continued to do so until it was finally satiated. People had lost everything. It was the worst tragedy in the modern history of the city.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The affected people were being registered at the makeshift hospital. Hermione had filled out forms for both herself and Tom. A nurse agar the hospital had assessed Tom and determined that he was indeed a newborn, as Hermione had initially suspected. He was barely a couple of days old. Hermione felt her heart breaking into a million pieces when she realized the precious baby would never get to know his parents. During her stay agar the camp, she had fed him, cleaned him, gave him comfort, sang lullabies to him, all by herself. She knew she had limited time with the boy before she had to let him go.</p>

  <p>About a week later found Hermione going through some major life changes. Her parents' badly charred bodies were buried in the ground with the only people attending the funeral being herself, Tom and a few of their neighbors. She had contacted her parents' insurance company. Even though the house was gone, she still had inherited a considerable sum of money from her parents. She had rented a small one-bedroom apartment in the heart of the city for the time being. She also found herself the primary caretaker of little Tom. She had continuously contacted the authorities regarding the care of the orphaned neonate's care. But amid all the loss and damage, no one cared about one child. The plump woman responsible for registering the people had told Hermione she had two options. She could either leave Tom in the camp where he may or may not be well taken care of. Or she could keep him with her at least until they find a foster home for him. Hermione, knowing she would never let the poor child be put through neglectful care, decided on the latter option.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>And that was how Hermione Granger found herself playing the role of a mother at the age of eighteen to a child that fate had dropped in her lap.</p>
