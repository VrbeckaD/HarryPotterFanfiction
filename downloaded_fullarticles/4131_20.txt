    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>It was a particularly chilly evening in early October, and the streets of Knockturn Alley were quiet. The sun had dipped below the far off horizon hours ago, the lamps blinking to life in its wake. All the shops were boarded up, and there was barely a soul about. Those who remained did their best to hurry on their way, knowing well that no good could come of this place after sundown, let alone past midnight.</p>
<p>Down a side street, away from the prying eyes of anyone who lingered by, Thorfinn Rowle leaned against a grimy brick wall, a hand-rolled cigarette resting loosely between his fingers. He'd positioned himself accordingly, so that he had a good sightline to the area that fell under the beam from the nearest lamp. The shadows where he stood further off provided an excellent cover, which he was thankful for. Wasn't often that he ventured into this neck of the woods anymore, and he could do without being recognized tonight.</p>
<p>He checked his watch, cursed under his breath around an exhale of smoke. Damn kids. Running late <i>again</i>. Not to mention it had been their idea to meet so late. He almost didn't know why he still bothered with them, after the last two times.</p>
<p>Thorfinn remembered fondly the days when he'd run with a more organized lot. Sure, there were some downsides to those times as well, but at least they'd had enough integrity to show up on time. Nowadays, the game was mostly controlled by young upstarts who barely knew what they were doing even on a good day. Few remained of his old group. The majority of them were currently serving life sentences in Azkaban. The ones that weren't were either abroad, or living in secrecy and trying their damnedest not to end up there. Those like him, who had managed by the slightest of chances to escape jail time thus far, were seen as the resident old fogies of the trade. And no wonder, really. Speaking solely for himself, he had been forced into hiding for so many of the years since the war that he was hardly a respectable name in the business anymore. When he <i>was</i> around, it was like he was walking on eggshells. It didn't help that for the last few months what remained of his free comrades were being picked off one by one. It wasn't all the Aurors' doing, either...</p>
<p>Well regardless, Thorfinn still prided himself on knowing how to play, even if these new kids couldn't say the same. He wasn't about to let himself get caught with his trousers down because of their lack of professionalism.</p>
<p>There came the sound of crunching gravel, and Thorfinn pushed himself away from the wall, swivelling his head to check down each stretch of alley beyond him. For a moment, he thought he must be going crazy. Those <i>were</i> footsteps, weren't they? Yet, he saw no one; the street was still as desolate as it had been for the past half hour.</p>
<p>A voice in the back of his mind chimed in with who it might have been, and he promptly brushed it off. Old friends that he was still in contact with around here had been spreading talk of a masked hero, chasing down and snatching up any former Death Eaters he could get his hands on. Even had a fancy name now, although Thorfinn couldn't be bothered to remember it. He was pretty sure it was all rubbish, of course. Yes, there had been several arrests of late that had clearly not been the Aurors doing, if the papers were to be believed, but that didn't mean that someone was out here willingly putting on a cape and tights and running around like a damn lunatic. He leaned back again, feeling foolish for having entertained the notion in the first place.</p>
<p>He was just about to decide on giving them another ten minutes before calling the whole thing off when two figures popped into view from around the far corner. They trod lightly over the old, stone pathway, one glancing from side to side in an almost comical nervous twitch. Thorfinn shrunk back into his hiding spot a bit more, on the off chance they ended up not being who he'd been waiting for. It wasn't until they finally stepped under the lamp, and he got a good look at them, that he rolled his eyes and flicked the butt of his fag into the dirt at his feet. About bloody time.</p>
<p>The boys looked like they'd seen a ghost when Thorfinn stuck a hand into the light and waved them over ― and not of the cheerful Hogwarts variety. They hurried up to him, trying to make themselves look more confident as they did, but he could see the anxiety written all over their faces. Merlin, there couldn't have been more than forty years between them.</p>
<p>"Hi," the taller one greeted him, wincing as he realized how daft that probably sounded. Thorfinn smirked to himself, but chose not to comment. "So. You got the ―"</p>
<p>"I told you, not till I see the money. After that, I'll take you to where they're stored, and you can do what you'd like with 'em."</p>
<p>The two young men glanced at each other, the one who spoke biting his lower lip. Then he shrugged the rucksack off his shoulder and yanked open the drawstrings.</p>
<p>Thorfinn peered inside, suppressing a snort. His eyes may not have been what they used to be, but it was plain as day that there wasn't enough there. Sucking his teeth in mocking contempt, he waved his wand over the bag. The number that shimmered in the air moments later was less than satisfactory.</p>
<p>"You're havin' me on, yeah? I told you, I'm not selling 'em for anythin' less than 30 Galleons a piece."</p>
<p>The short, pudgy one looked to his partner before asking with brows furrowed in confusion, "So you're not even gonna give us wholesale?"</p>
<p>"That <i>is</i> wholesale, you twat."</p>
<p>A scraping sound came from above, and all three of them froze in place.</p>
<p>The two boys looked downright terrified. Thorfinn could feel the hairs on the back of his neck bristling. He stepped out a little further from the wall, peering up at the rooftops around them for signs of...Nah, it couldn't be. He was being paranoid. Was probably just an owl, or a rat scurrying about. These kids could go ahead and get jumpy if they chose, but he knew better.</p>
<p>Shaking off the uncanny feeling, he returned his attention to the matter at hand. The other two still looked a tad put-off, but Thorfinn wasn't about to let a silly wives' tale get the best of him.</p>
<p>"Look, you can take that shit back to your boss, and you can tell him I ―"</p>
<p>A jet of green light suddenly shot through the air. Before any of them could figure out just where it was coming from, it had whizzed over their heads to collide with the wall behind them, sparking like a firecracker on impact. They turned to watch as a symbol begin to form over the spot where it had hit ― one that would have been familiar to many. A skull, burning with all the radiance of emeralds into the dusty, gray brick. After all these years, Thorfinn knew that each one of them still felt an immense dread deep down in their souls as they gazed into its dark, empty eye sockets. Even he, with its brother still branded on his left forearm. Except when it opened its gaping maw, there was not the usual forked tongue and scales they would have expected. Instead, there came a hand, followed by a long, serpent-like arm, twisting first down, then up and around the skull, until it came to float beside it, middle finger lifted in salute.</p>
<p>Thorfinn couldn't help but laugh in disbelief. He should've known. He should've bloody known.</p>
<p>"Oh, you've <i>got</i> to be fucking ―"</p>
<p>A jinx to the back of the head sent Thorfinn down like a sack of potatoes.</p>
<p>Blood burst over his tongue as his jaw smacked the ground. He tried to spit, but found his mouth wouldn't open. His neck was bent painfully to the side, one half of his face smushed against the ground. A whirlwind of noise roared in his ears. His body felt like it had been encased in ice. He could barely open his eyes, and even when he did, he could only make out shapes and faint colors. From his position, he couldn't see much, but he caught sight of what looked like the two boys fleeing for their lives just as a ― <i>fucking hell</i> ― a cloaked figure scaled down the wall at the opposite side of the alley and took off after them.</p>
<p>The shorter one was the first to go down. The bark of a spell cut the air, and then he was suddenly snatched by a net, toppling him over kicking and screaming. Next, the figure charged after the taller one, who was backing away shrieking high-pitched pleas for mercy. Thorfinn could only see them from the waist down, but the man did something when he caught up to him that made the boy shake like he'd been zapped by lightning, before he, too, hit the ground, unconscious. His rucksack fell with a deafening clank, coins spilling from it's open top and rolling between the cracks in the cobblestone.</p>
<p>Thorfinn tried to twist his body, get it to inch further away from the fray. Nothing worked. Must've been a Full Body-Bind, because he couldn't move a damn thing.</p>
<p>The shorter boy had somehow managed to get back on his feet with the net still wrapped around him, and was trying his best to fight off their attacker. He put up a valiant effort, but it didn't get him very far. Unable to raise his arms, he instead opted for throwing his weight into the man, which he easily dodged before coming back with a smooth right hook. Thorfinn didn't see it connect, but he heard the resulting crunch, and honestly if he wasn't already thoroughly brassed, he might've commended the man for his skill.</p>
<p>Just as Thorfinn's vision began to gradually swim back into a clearer focus, the cloaked figure came up to stand beside him, one steel-toed boot resting within kicking distance of his teeth. He braced for the impact, when suddenly he instead felt the paralyzing cold of the spell leaving him as his arms and legs were yanked up over his back, a thick cord binding them all to each other like he was being hogtied. Now he could lift his head, and he saw that the two boys had been propped up on either side of the nearest lamppost, a similar rope holding them taut to it.</p>
<p>Then he was suddenly flying through the air, suspended behind the caped man as they bounded from rooftop to rooftop. The streets of Knockturn sped by below them. Row upon row of old, decrepit shops, curtains pulled tightly shut to hide the seedy goings-on thereof. Thorfinn had never fully realized what a difference there was between there and Diagon Alley till he was viewing it all from above. Worn, soiled pathways merged into clean, fresh cobblestone, and even in the dead of night, this side of town shone like a beacon, its streetlamps glinting merrily through the darkness.</p>
<p>Down they descended to the streets below, the man skidding across a wall with his gloved hands like a gecko, Thorfinn floating along behind him. Around a corner, and then he could see that they'd come to an open courtyard, a looming structure posed ominously on one side. It was with a flip of his stomach that Thorfinn realized it was the Ministry.</p>
<p>After the war, everyone had been fearful about security. The organization's answer had been to shut down all previously used entrances and erect a new one in the heart of this bustling wizarding neighborhood. Now anyone who wished to set foot in Ministry property ― staff or otherwise ― had to first go through this checkpoint, and once they'd been cleared, they would then be permitted to Floo from one of the many fireplaces inside directly to their underground Atrium. The building was enormous, its white marble pillars reaching up to the sky to rival that of Gringotts, a reminder of the Ministry of Magic's all-too-powerful presence in their community.</p>
<p>It was right in the middle of the steps leading up to its doors that the cloaked figure plopped Thorfinn down on his side. From there, he was finally able to get a better look at him ― much to his chagrin.</p>
<p>He was dressed all in black, wearing thick, leather gloves and Hungarian Horntail boots that looked like they could crush skulls. His head was covered by a large hood, the cape trailing off of it hanging down to his knees. Underneath, he had on a form fitting catsuit that looked to be made of a thin, yet protective material, although it left little to the imagination. His face was difficult to make out in the darkness, and Thorfinn realized why as soon as he crouched down, withdrawing his wand from a holster at his side. A mask covered it ― one Thorfinn was quite familiar with, having worn it himself on more occasions than he could count. It was different, however. The eye sockets had green points drawn around them like some twisted Muggle clown, an exaggerated and terrifying red smile painted from cheek to cheek across the mouth slit beneath. And from it's center, a pink tongue, sticking out down to the chin, that looked like it was blowing him a raspberry.</p>
<p>So the rumors <i>had</i> been true. From what he'd heard around, there wasn't man nor woman could do business in this town anymore without this little sod ruining all the fun. Thorfinn had wanted so badly to believe it was all talk, but he couldn't very well do that anymore, not now he was staring the man himself in the face.</p>
<p>"Why are you doing this?" he shouted in a sudden panic. "Who the hell are you, anyway?"</p>
<p>"Me?"</p>
<p>The figure chuckled ― a warm, honeysuckle sound that was so self-satisfied it made Thorfinn itch to smack the smirk he was no doubt wearing under that mask right off his pompous face. His voice was being altered, probably by some spell or device. It came out garbled, gruff, and unnatural. Yet it was odd, but…For some reason, Thorfinn had the unsettling notion that it was one he should recognize.</p>
<p>"I guess you can call me…the Black Adder."</p>
<p>With that, the man raised his wand. The last thing Thorfinn saw was a burst of bright sparks headed straight for his forehead.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>☠               ☠               ☠</p>
</center>A shrill sound pierced the early morning quiet.<p>Ron Weasley bolted upright, his heart thudding in his chest. Long-trained Auror instincts kicked in, and he reached back to grope for his wand where it should have been hanging in its holster from his bedpost. Finding nothing but air, his fingers scrambled across the bed, searching for where it might've fallen.</p>
<p>Only he realized rather quickly he <i>wasn't</i> in his bed.</p>
<p>Under his hand was not the soft mattress he'd been expecting, but a firm cloth cushion. He blinked, and the fog in his eyes began to clear. From where he sat, he could see the line of bookshelves that should've been in his living room on one side, the island where the kitchen began on the other. Looking down, he discovered that he was in fact on the sofa, half wrapped in the flimsy, old afghan that was usually draped across the back, and still wearing the same clothes from yesterday. His holster was still strapped around his shoulders as well, his wand currently digging painfully into his side. A bleary-eyed check of his watch told him it had been barely three hours since he'd finally come home from the office ― and apparently blacked out without so much as taking his shoes off. Or finishing the leftover takeout he'd warmed up, the container of which sat open on the coffee table.</p>
<p>It only took a beat for him to come to the conclusion that there was absolutely no reason for him to be awake right now. He was two seconds away from flopping down again when suddenly full awareness came surging through his brain like rushing water, and he remembered why he'd woken up in the first place.</p>
<p>Someone was shouting ― and he had a feeling he knew exactly who it was.</p>
<p>"<i>Shit</i>," he cursed under his breath as he sprang to his feet, banging his shin on the coffee table and nearly toppling over onto his nose. Nursing his bruised leg, he clambered across the room ― over a pile of garbage bags he'd neglected to take out the day before and a discarded overcoat ― till he finally wrenched open the door.</p>
<p>And nearly collided with the source of the noise.</p>
<p>Just outside his doorstep, a telltale red envelope hung suspended in midair. So that's what that tapping had been about an hour ago. He'd been floating in that realm between half awake and half comatose at the time, and was almost entirely certain he'd imagined it. Damn owl must've found another way in.</p>
<p>The folds of the parchment flapped together as the recorded voice continued to bellow in his face. He was still barely awake enough to register all it was saying, but it was none other than his Head of Department, just as he'd suspected. Fantastic. Nothing he loved more than being battered about by <i>her</i> first thing in the morning. That was when he realized the letter had started a small fire on his doormat, and he quickly moved to stamp it out with the heel of his boot. It left the poor thing even more damaged than it had been thus far. Now it would greet anyone who came by his flat with 'WLCOM ME', and if that wasn't just pathetic.</p>
<p>The Howler was causing such a ruckus that the old crone down the hall had poked her head out to peer suspiciously at him from around her door. When he noticed, she gave him a stern look before turning up her hooked nose and snapping it shut. As soon as she was out of sight, he lifted a finger in salute, then grabbed a corner of the letter as tentatively as he could and dragged it inside, trying not to set himself ablaze along the way.</p>
<p>"― THIRD TIME THIS WEEK ―"</p>
<p>Ron didn't have to listen all that closely to know exactly what this was about. Seeing as there was no use avoiding the inevitable, he decided to start getting ready for the day in favor of an additional hour or two of sleep. He headed into the bedroom, peeling off his layers as he went. The letter left bits of ash in its wake as it trailed along behind him.</p>
<p>"― BEEN WORKING ON THAT CASE FOR MONTHS ―"</p>
<p>A hot shower soothed his muscles, sore from lack of rest and the awkward position he'd been laying in. He stood under the stream for longer than was entirely necessary, warring with himself over whether it was really worth it to go in, or if he should just call off ill. He knew before the idea had even occurred to him which he was going to choose.</p>
<p>"― THOUGHT YOU HAD THIS HANDLED ―"</p>
<p>By the time he was toweling off, the Howler had thankfully ceased its tirade, and had even been so kind as to leave its shredded remains in a tidy little pile on his bedroom carpet. He brushed his teeth, shot a quick Hot-Air Charm at his hair and combed it, and threw on a fresh uniform ― making a mental note to set aside some time for laundry on the weekend. The remnants of the letter he spelled into the takeout box on his coffee table, before dumping the whole thing into one of the bags by the door. Garbage in hand, he trudged to the lift, then out and around back to the dumpster, where after having made his deposit, he promptly spun on his heel.</p>
<p>Diagon Alley was just beginning to wake up itself when he arrived at the Apparition point ― a designated spot the Ministry had put into place in the interest of added security. There were constant reminders of the war everywhere, but the pleasantness of the day was already making up for it. The sun was rising, streetlamps winking out each in turn. Shop owners could be seen unshuttering their windows and flipping the signs on their doors as he trudged down the winding pathways. A small mass of Ministry officials was surging towards the checkpoint in the courtyard, and Ron stepped into file behind them, withdrawing his wand.</p>
<p>Olivia smiled and greeted him with a friendly, 'Good morning, Auror Weasley'. He waited as she checked his wand and scanned his body with her own, glancing idly at the rows of similar workstations along either side of her, already busy as well with their individual queues. Once he was cleared for entry, he along with several others passed through into the second, smaller hall, where the line of Floos awaited them. He chose the closest unoccupied one and stepped inside, vanishing in a whoosh of viridescent flames that proceeded to spit him out into the Ministry's Atrium.</p>
<p>He had just arrived at his desk, munching on a Pumpkin Pasty he'd snagged from the early morning trolley, when Harry looked up from where he'd been conversing with Neville, his expression haggard.</p>
<p>"She wants to see you."</p>
<p>Ron wanted to look incredulous, but decided it wasn't worth the effort. He'd expected this. From the moment he'd stepped out of the lift onto Level Two, he'd been bombarded with the exact type of noise and chaos that had only accompanied a very particular occurrence over the past few months. Employees from all departments could be seen flitting back and forth between their offices out in the hall ― and inside the Auror Department itself was in complete disarray, with every single desk filled (even those of employees that typically worked the night shift), Fire-calls being conducted on all sides, and interoffice memos zooming through the air above like little lilac hummingbirds.</p>
<p>"What, <i>now</i>? Can I at least finish my breakfast first?"</p>
<p>"Sorry, mate," Harry smiled apologetically, "she said to send you as soon as you got here. It's urgent."</p>
<p>Ron was still brushing crumbs from his fingers when he entered Hermione's corner office to find her hunched over her desk, scribbling furiously on a slip of purple parchment. She didn't bother to look up till she'd finished, tapping the paper, which quickly folded itself into a more aerodynamic shape and soared away. Ron held the door open, shutting it with a snap as soon as the letter was gone and stepping towards her.</p>
<p>"It's him again, isn't it?"</p>
<p>The expression on her face told him more than words could've possibly managed.</p>
<p>"He left us another little gift this morning. I just know the press'll have a field day with that one tomorrow. I've been dodging Fire-calls from them left and right since I got in."</p>
<p>"Rowle, right?"</p>
<p>"Unfortunately."</p>
<p>Ron grimaced. He'd been hoping he'd heard that bit from the Howler wrong. Lack of evidence had lost them the charges against Thorfinn Rowle after the war. For years, they'd been keeping a close watch on him, hoping one day he'd slip up and they'd have him. Then they'd caught wind of him being involved in an illegal flying carpet ring, and thought it was the chance they'd been waiting for. Well, they'd gotten him now ― but he knew everyone would've much preferred they'd gotten him on their own terms.</p>
<p>A kettle heating under a Charm on her sideboard whistled. She pushed away from her desk in irritation and crossed to pour herself a cup.</p>
<p>"<i>Eight months</i> Roberts and Thompson had been working on that case. They'd been this close," she held her thumb and forefinger a centimeter's width apart to prove her point, "to getting to Rowle, and subsequently taking down the entire operation, when all of a sudden this vigilante character swoops in and packages up not only him, but two of the younger ones as well, like it was nothing! I'm just glad he was found early enough that none of the shoppers had seen him. What an embarrassment <i>that</i> would've been."</p>
<p>"Yeah. Lucky, that."</p>
<p>She suddenly slammed the mug down at the edge of her desk, huffing a puff of frustrated air through her nose. "Is that all you have to say? Half a year now we've been dealing this. Gotten up to nearly three instances a week in the last month! I thought you'd said you had this vigilante case handled ― I'd expected you would've done something about it by now!"</p>
<p>A bubble of indignation burst in his chest. "Well, perhaps if I'd gotten a touch more sleep this morning, I'd be inclined to say more."</p>
<p>"I ―" Her fingers flexed, and she shut her eyes for a moment, taking a deep breath. "I'm sorry. The news has gotten up to Shacklebolt now, and he's been hounding me since we found Rowle for an explanation of what we're going to do about this. I didn't send that Howler to take it out on you, more just to ―"</p>
<p>"Vent. I know. It's alright."</p>
<p>Seeing her look so defeated, Ron felt his anger quickly subside into concern. As she gradually calmed herself, he took another step forward, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. She turned into the gesture, allowing his arm to circle around her as she buried her face into his chest. He smoothed her frizzy hair and pressed a friendly kiss to the top of her head. Several moments later, they parted, her smiling in thanks as she waved her hand towards the kettle.</p>
<p>"Did you want…?"</p>
<p>"No, thanks. So. What <i>are</i> we going to do about it?"</p>
<p>As she returned to her chair, he settled himself into the one across. Now that he was looking at her through a different set of emotions, he could plainly see how exhausted she was. The patches under her eyes might've even been darker than his, and that was saying something. He watched as she took a sip of tea to steel herself.</p>
<p>"I want those steps surveilled on a regular basis, for a start. As much time as we can devote to it. We need to keep up on our other cases, of course, but we also can't afford to let him sully our reputation any longer. Although he hasn't shown a predictable pattern yet, we know he operates solely at night, and thus we need to make sure that area is being watched as many evenings as we can."</p>
<p>"Guess I'll just stop sleeping and eating altogether, then, won't I? I'm already close enough as it is, these days."</p>
<p>She softened at that, her brows knitting together. For a moment, she looked like she wanted to hug him again. Ron rubbed a hand across his mouth and glanced away, suddenly feeling uncomfortably vulnerable and instantly regretting he'd said anything at all.</p>
<p>"If you need me to pass the case on to someone else, I can."</p>
<p>If he wasn't mistaken, she looked like she might've been further rethinking how she'd woken him up that morning. To tell the truth, he wasn't that upset about it now that some time had passed. They'd all been a bit on edge lately around here.</p>
<p>Seven years since the war had ended, and there were still far too many Death Eaters and sympathizers walking free for his liking ― or anyone's. The community had made their displeasure over this clear on several occasions. Some were in hiding, or had fled the country. Others they hadn't had enough evidence to arrest or convict. He could understand that, even if he didn't want to. Unfortunately, that sort of thing wasn't as easy to explain to the general populace. Since first Hermione and then Harry had been promoted, their team had been working around-the-clock to put things to rights as best they could. That wasn't even to mention all the other cases they had on their docket. Times were definitely hard ― and now there was this wanker running about and making them look even worse. Ron didn't envy either of them for the responsibility that had been dumped so precariously on both their shoulders. He could deal with a Howler every now and then, if that's what it took to keep Hermione sane and prevent her from blowing up on someone who didn't know her as well.</p>
<p>"You could take a couple days ―"</p>
<p>"No!" Ron felt a wave of shame wash over him at the suggestion. Her disappointment, he could handle. Her pity, he could do without. He wasn't the only one being overworked around here. If the rest of them could handle it, then so could he. It wasn't that he hadn't wanted to do his job, to catch this cape-wearing madman and potentially put their department in good standing once again. It was just that there were other pressing cases at hand, as well, and only so many hours in the day. "No, it's ― it's alright, I've got it."</p>
<p>"I know you do." And he knew when she said that, she meant it. With sigh, she added, "I'll admit: maybe nightly surveillance is a tad much. But make no mistake, I want this vigilante's arse on a platter. No one makes a mockery of my team and gets away with it. Whatever you can do to assure he's held accountable for the way he's made us look in the press, I'll support it."</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am." He gave her a fake salute. She laughed, and he smiled back, feeling the tension between them ebbing away.</p>
<p>His gaze dropped to a copy of the <i>Daily Prophet</i> spread out in front of her. He wondered how he hadn't noticed it before. Its front page blared with the headline <b>IDENTITY OF KNOCKTURN'S MIDNIGHT CRUSADER REVEALED</b> ― and the article was written by none other than Pansy Parkinson, which shouldn't have come as a shock. She'd turned into one of the <i>Prophet's</i> star reporters, and seemingly this tights wearing watchdog's biggest fan. Below the title, a photo of the masked maniac himself could be seen preening for the camera from his perch at the edge of a rooftop, his cape billowing in the wind. Ron leaned forward to splay his fingers over the page and turned it, his heart missing a beat. For a brief moment, he thought someone might have discovered who it really was ― but it only took reading the first sentence to show that such hopes were utterly dismal in these times. He should've known.</p>
<p>Even as he scanned the article, his attention kept diverting unwittingly to the picture above. Every so often, the wind would blow <i>just right</i>, the man would angle himself into the light from the lamppost just so, and Ron would feel his mouth go dry. Muscles flexed through the tight jumpsuit he wore. Strong hands held firm to the rain gutter below him. He didn't look like a bodybuilder, but he was toned, perpetually poised for swift action. The man carried himself in a cocky way that was equal parts infuriating and oddly arousing. Reminded him of someone else he knew. And when his cape brushed back far enough to show off the shape of that arse, Ron knew he was doomed. It was a dangerous road he was traveling down, he knew it, but...</p>
<p>He'd discovered just how far he could go on one fateful night a couple months back, after he'd stumbled home from having a drink ― or two or three or four ― at the pub with Harry, Dean, and Seamus. The former had gone home to Ginny, the latter to each other, and Ron had gone home to no one except his own right hand and a flattering photograph of the mystery crusader flirting up at him from the front page of the <i>Prophet</i> where he'd left it on the kitchen counter earlier that morning. Apparently, there was very little he could do to turn back after that.</p>
<p>Now he had a name to pair with the good looks. Well, not a <i>real</i> one, but it was better than nothing, he supposed.</p>
<p>He shook his head, trying to clear it as he covered up his distraction with a chuckle. He wasn't about to make the glaring faux pas of getting a stiffy in front of one of his best friends (and ex-girlfriend) ― least of all to a picture of some masked anonymous. He didn't want anyone to know he was attracted to someone like that. He hardly even liked believing it himself. It had been far too long since he'd had someone to go home to, but really.</p>
<p>"He's got a name now?"</p>
<p>"Apparently," she snorted. "The Black Adder...Now I'm just wondering who's his Baldrick."</p>
<p>"Sorry?"</p>
<p>"Nevermind." She waved the comment away, shaking with laughter. "<i>Vipera berus</i> happens to be the only species of venomous snake in the UK. I'm sure it has something to do with that."</p>
<p>Ron shrugged it off, having learned quite some time ago to assume that whenever she and Harry made a reference he didn't understand, it was probably a Muggle thing.</p>
<p>"I'll see what sort of pattern I can suss out. Get a feel for which nights we should plan to stakeout. Might be good if I speak with Parkinson, as well ― see how she seems to know so much about this 'Black Adder'."</p>
<p>"That's a start. Thanks, Ron."</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>He returned to his desk in the main room with the image of the Black Adder still burned into his brain. Heat bloomed around his collar from more than just the stress of the case laid in front of him. Neville looked up from perusing his own copy of the paper at the adjoining workstation, and Ron convinced himself not to look down at it when he heard him ask:</p>
<p>"I take it she expects us to step up on this 'Black Adder' case, then?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'd say she wants it to be our top priority, now."</p>
<p>"I've been trying, but I can't make heads nor tails of where he'll be every night. Seems he's got his hands in just about every crime right out there. Almost never the same place twice. And it's not always Death Eaters, either. You got any ideas?"</p>
<p>Ron sighed, tearing his eyes away from the cork board on the wall behind his partner's head. The Black Adder's clown-like visage grinned mockingly at him from every angle, making his blood boil for more reasons than one.</p>
<p>"All I know is we've gotta find him. Wherever he is."</p>
