    <p>The corridors were filled with black-robed students as each class rushed off to the next, various students chatting and laughing as they made their way to their class. The auburn-haired teen’s eyes roamed over the crowd, absently seeking out a certain Hufflepuff’s charming face as he sat under a tree, supposedly reading a book.</p><p>He sighed quietly when he realised what he was doing. It was pathetic, he knew. He’s been doing it since his first year at Hogwarts. And now that he was in his fifth year, he was still doing it. Watching that Hufflepuff boy, just hoping that maybe--<em>maybe</em>—he might look at him one day.</p><p>“For fuck’s sake…” he muttered under his breath, careful not to be heard, “I’m a bloody Slytherin. Why would anyone even I look at m–”</p><p>Mycroft cut himself off when he saw him.</p><p>A certain brunette walked down the corridor, a broad grin on his face as he listened to his mate tell him about something he saw in <em>Zonko’s</em>. He promptly broke into a fit of giggles -Mycroft thought he looked adorable.</p><p>A warm smile curled on his lips as he watched. That boy…he was definitely something. Especially since he managed to get the elder Holmes’ attention.</p><p>He was just about to get up to go to his own class, when he saw the brunette turn his head, accidentally locking eyes with him. Mycroft felt frozen in place, his heart hammering and his cheeks reddening as the Hufflepuff looked at him.</p><p>They held each others’ gazes for a few seconds or so, but it felt like <em>hours</em> to Mycroft. Slowly, a warm smile formed on the boy’s lips, and it took awhile for Mycroft to realise that he was actually smiling at <em>him</em>.</p><p>Mycroft turned a bright red, and even brighter –if that was possible—when he saw the boy chuckle. He quickly gathered up his things and stuffed them into his bag, making a hasty retreat before he could embarrass himself. A “hasty retreat” was probably a bad idea, since he ended up tripping over someone and dropping his belongings.</p><p>The elder Holmes groaned internally as he picked up his stuff, muttering apologies to whoever it was he tripped over –Professor Flitwick—and helping him up. He glanced behind his shoulder, seeing the Hufflepuff boy look at him one last time, a smile still on his face, before resuming his walk to class.</p><p>Mycroft let out a quiet groan as he stuffed his bag again, muttering one last apology to the professor, and went on to class.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>Greg turned to look at his best friend, Michael Dimmock, as they walked to Transfiguration. “What was what?” he asked, casting Dimmock a questioning glance; especially at the smirk he was wearing.</p><p>The shorter teen let out an exasperated sigh. “<em>Really</em>, Greg? This is, what? The thousandth time I’ve caught you looking at Holmes? Just do us all a favour and ask him out, for fuck’s sake.” When Dimmock saw the brunette blush hard, he rolled his eyes. “Have you ever even talked to the bloke?”</p><p>“I—well—,” Greg stammered as they navigated their way through the student filled corridors. When he looked at Dimmock, and saw his raised brow, he sighed. “No,” he said quietly, looking away from his friend and huffing.</p><p>“You’ve been here five years,” Dimmocksaid slowly, “And you’ve never even talked to him?” When Greg shook his head, he laughed. “That sure explains why you’re still not put off by him.” Greg looked at him questioningly, so he explained. “A Slytherin prodigy everyone’s been talking about ever since he came here, and then even more when his little brother came at the start of the year—y’know, that one kid who sorted himself into Slytherin and made the Sorting Hat agree with him; Never thought that was your type, to be honest.”</p><p>“Why would the fact that he’s a genius be something to put me off? And honestly, I can’t understand the contention between you Gryffindors and Slytherins.” Although he’s heard things about Mycroft, not all of them necessarily good since a lot of his info came from Gryffindors, he doesn’t really know much about the Slytherin boy.</p><p>Dimmock looked at his friend and shrugged. “Tradition, I guess? Also, I heard that he can know everything about you just by <em>looking, </em>apparently. Lots of people say he’s a legilimen or somethin’ like that; but his little brother says he just deduces things about them. People say its bollocks, but I believe him. He don’t look like the type of kid that lies about stuff like that just for people to like him. And as far as I know,” the younger teen sighed, “No one actually likes the poor kid, especially since that little bastard reveals all your deepest darkest secrets in front of loads of people, and then just leaves you to deal with whatever shit his little deductions put you in.”</p><p>Greg stared at Dimmock blankly, before a broad grin spread across his features. “You sure know a lot about the Holmeses,” he chuckled, “Been keeping a lookout for me, then?”</p><p>“Nah. It was Molly who told me all this stuff, to be honest,” the other teen shrugged, “Wasn’t even asking. D’you know she has a crush on the other Holmes kid? I think you two might get along quite nicely.”</p><p>Greg chuckled as they entered the Transfiguration classroom, taking their seats at the very back of the class. “Your little cousin already has a crush, has she?” a faint smile was on Greg’s lips, “It’s not even been a year yet. Kids these days,” laughed Greg, effectively shifting the conversation away from his...thing...for Mycroft.</p><p>Dimmock stared at Greg a bit, his brow raised. He noticed the topic shift, but that was mainly his doing he realised. But just as soon as he was about to call Greg out, a cat came into the classroom, shushing everyone as it leaped up onto the professor’s desk.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Just when Mycroft thought his day couldn’t get any worse.</p><p>The auburn-haired teen was just lounging around the Slytherin common room as he did some advanced reading on the chapter he was <em>sure</em> Snape would give a pop quiz on—not that he would really need to read up on the subject—when the entrance to the dorm slammed open and Sherlock burst into the room.</p><p>Mycroft could already feel a headache coming on as he took in his little brother’s disheveled form; hair unrulier than usual, bruises all over his face, a black eye and a cut lip. “What happened…?” he asked quietly, already closing his book.</p><p>When Sherlock didn’t speak—or even look at him—the elder Holmes shook his head and stood up, walking over to the younger boy. He cupped Sherlock’s chin in one hand and made him look up at him, a stern expression on his face.</p><p>“…got into a fight…” Sherlock mumbled quietly, his eyes trying to avert Mycroft’s gaze.</p><p>“Who did you fight and <em>why</em>?”</p><p>“…Anderson…”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Fucking Anderson…!” the young boy snarled, glaring at Mycroft now.</p><p>Mycroft glared around the room at the people who looked up at Sherlock’s outburst, before turning back to his brother, a stern expression on his face. “Alright…” he sighed, “Why did you fight him, Sherlock?”</p><p>“Because he’s an idiot.”</p><p>“That’s not very helpful.”</p><p>“But it’s true!”</p><p>The elder Holmes just looked at his younger brother, his eyes roaming over his petulant face. And in an instant, Mycroft knew <em>why</em> Sherlock got into a fight. It was primary school all over again.</p><p>He let out a quiet sigh, grasping Sherlock by the wrist and pulling him towards his prefect's quarters. They needed privacy.</p><p>When the two Holmes brothers were finally alone, both seated on Mycroft’s four-poster, Sherlock was quiet. Almost feeble looking, but still rather snappish. Mycroft reached out a hand and cupped Sherlock’s chin as he inspected the damage.</p><p>“In what state did you leave the Gryffindor boy…?” he asked quietly as he let go of Sherlock’s face.</p><p>Judging from his younger brother’s silence, Mycroft was very sure that the other boy was brought to the hospital wing as soon as his little brother backed off. Mycroft sighed. “What did you do to him, Sherlock…?”</p><p>Sherlock scowled, but said, “Beat him to a pulp… a broken nose, a black eye far worse than mine, and several loose teeth…” the young boy paused a moment before adding, “Oh, and I may or may not have used that spell you taught me a few days ago.”</p><p>“<em>Anteoculatia</em>?”</p><p>“Yeah, that one.”</p><p>At another time, Mycroft would’ve been proud of the younger boy because he pulled off the spell on the first try, but not now –though he couldn’t help the proud smile that ghosted his lips. “Sherlock…” sighed the auburn-haired teen, “Do you realise the consequences your actions have caused?”</p><p>“Well, what I did to the bumbling fool was far less severe than what I had planned…” Sherlock muttered quietly.</p><p>And Mycroft didn’t doubt that. Several times this month, he saw Sherlock practising by himself near the Quidditch pitch when everyone else was in Hogsmeade. And what he saw made him immensely proud of the first-year—and also a wee bit terrified of what Sherlock might become.</p><p>He was sure Sherlock saw him playing with the same spell a few months ago. <em>Magna Mortem</em>. Mycroft remembered what Sherlock looked like, and it frightened him. Sherlock was just a first-year, and yet he was starting to master such an advanced spell…Mycroft hoped to God that no one would ask his little brother to a duel.</p><p>“So why didn’t you do it…? What you had planned, I mean.”</p><p>Sherlock looked up at Mycroft and scowled. “Two boys stopped me…” he mumbled.</p><p>Mycroft quirked a brow at that. That…has never happened before. Usually, the only people who could stop Sherlock were some of the professors, and him. But those two boys…? He needed to know them quickly. He could use them to keep Sherlock in check.</p><p>“Well. Then I should thank them,” the older boy sighed, “If it weren’t for them, you’d be on a train for Azkaban.”</p><p>The younger boy just scowled at Mycroft, making him heave another sigh. “So,” he murmured, “You ran from the teachers, yes? I imagine Snape must be tracking you down as we speak. His favouritism for Slytherins doesn’t apply to either of us, you know. He’ll have you suspended. Or worse, expelled.”</p><p>“I don’t care.”</p><p>“You could’ve <em>at least</em> let them catch you. The consequences would have been far less severe.”</p><p>“Mycroft, you’re talking to me as if I <em>care</em>,” Sherlock snapped, his scowl still firmly in place.</p><p>Mycroft just shook his head and sighed, bringing out his wand to conjure up an ice bag. He held it out to his little brother, and when he didn’t take it, went ahead to press it against the younger boy’s swollen eye.</p><p>“Stop squirming,” Mycroft sighed, “It’ll only hurt more if you–”</p><p>The elder Holmes abruptly stopped talking, swallowing thickly as he looked past his brother, to the open doorway.</p><p>Snape was there.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>In the end, Sherlock was merely suspended from classes for three days thanks to Mycroft’s persuasion of the other professors to help his little brother’s case. Nevertheless, Snape was still furious with the two of them. For some awful reason, he wanted to expel the two Holmes boys <em>badly</em>. Mycroft was curious just why the potions master was always angry with them, but didn’t want to dwell on it for a little while. He can worry about that later.</p><p>Mycroft left the Great Hall after supper, his mood lower than it was earlier in the day and his eyes downcast as he trudged towards the Slytherin dorms. He felt tired, more so than usual, and was just absolutely looking forward to curl up on his bed and shut out the world. But apparently that’ll have to wait.</p><p>His eyes roamed over the crowd as he exited the hall, his eyes immediately snapping to where his brother was backed up against the wall by three Gryffindor third years. One of them, he realised when he saw the blonde, was Victor Trevor; Sherlock’s so-called ‘friend’, who appeared to have been in league with the bullies Sherlock was complaining about to the other boy from the start.</p><p>A fresh new wave of anger, mixed with anxiety, rose in the elder Holmes’ chest as he made his way to the building little crowd.</p><p>“You’re a bloody <em>freak</em>, Holmes!” one of the boys (Augustus Milverton) sneered, poking Sherlock in the chest. “It’s a wonder they even let you stay after what you did to that kid. Should’ve gotten you expelled!”</p><p>The boys around them laughed and sneered insults at the dark-haired boy, the latter just keeping his head down and his fists clutched at his sides. Mycroft knew just how much the younger Holmes was itching to fight back, but knew he couldn’t. Knew he <em>shouldn’t</em>.</p><p>Mycroft thought for a few seconds that Sherlock could handle it, that he’ll be able to keep himself at bay, but that thought was immediately dispelled when the Gryffindors started to push Sherlock around.</p><p>“What’re you gonna do, huh?!” said one of the boys (Mycroft didn’t know his name. Yet.), chuckling as they bullied the younger boy, “You gonna fight us and have yourself expelled?”</p><p>The auburn-haired teen pushed through the crowds, his eyes flashing and a low growl escaping his lips as he got nearer to them. Apparently not fast enough.</p><p>When the boys realised that they wouldn’t be able to get a response from the dark-haired Slytherin, the boy in the front swung his fist, hitting Sherlock hard on the cheek and making him stumble back against the wall. Just when Mycroft thought his little brother was about to snap, somebody else’s fist swung towards the boy who hit Sherlock.</p><p>“Leave him alone!” a blonde Gryffindor boy growled, putting himself between Sherlock and the bullies –like a human shield. “He’s done nothing to you! You’ve no right to bully him!”</p><p>“Why you–!”</p><p>And before the boy could even finish his sentence, the boy was roughly pulled away from Sherlock and thrust toward the wall–by a Hufflepuff fifth year. Mycroft’s eyes widened when he realised who it was.</p><p>“Back off, Wilkes,” the brunette growled, his eyes flashing as he glared at the third years. Mycroft’s eyes widened even more when he noticed that that made the bullies retreat just a bit.</p><p>“Why the hell are you two defending the bloody <em>freak</em>?” the boy (<em>Oh, so </em>that’s <em>Sebastian Wilkes</em>, Mycroft thought) snarled, though it was a bit tamer than before, now that the Hufflepuff fifth year was there.</p><p>“Because no one deserves to be bullied just because they’re a bit different. And you’ve got a lot of <em>nerve </em>calling anyone a freak, Mr. Third-Nipple.”</p><p>A broad grin curled on the brunette’s face as he watched Sebastian’s face slowly contort from confusion, to realisation, and then to horror. He could practically pinpoint the moment when the words “<em>He knows</em>” popped into the younger boy’s head.</p><p>The other two boys looked at Sebastian confusedly, appearing not to know what the fifth year was talking about. Nevertheless, a blush covered the boy’s face entirely, already backing off from the fight.</p><p>“I…you…you’ll regret this day, Lestrade…!” the younger boy growled as he started to back away, before turning entirely and disappearing into the crowd, followed by two confused third years trailing behind him.</p><p>As soon as the bullies disappeared, the two turned to look at Sherlock, who was now sitting on the floor, staring up at them confusedly.</p><p>“Sherlock, you alright?” asked the blonde, who Mycroft realised was John Watson. He crouched down beside the dark-haired boy.</p><p>“I’m…fine, John…” Sherlock mumbled absently, looking at John curiously. He glanced between John and Lestrade, brows furrowed. “I still do not understand why you two are helping me.”</p><p>The young Gryffindor boy held a hand out, which Sherlock took hesitantly, and helped the taller boy to his feet. “Well, I don’t understand why we shouldn’t,” John said, smiling.</p><p>“I’m a Slytherin.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“You’re…a Gryffindor.”</p><p>“Your point being?” Greg said, brow quirked upward.</p><p>Sherlock fell silent for a bit, just looking curiously at his two saviours, and shook his head. “I did not need your help. I could’ve handled it.”</p><p>“You looked like you were about to snap, Sherlock,” Lestrade sighed, “We can’t have you getting your first ticket to Azkaban just for some half-wit bullies. They’re not worth it.”</p><p>Mycroft stood gobsmacked, watching the boys as they interacted with his younger brother.  This can’t be real. It cannot <em>possibly </em>be real. The elder Holmes boy has never seen anyone talk to his brother so…amiably. And not looking like they wanted to punch Sherlock in the face.</p><p>He approached them with a bit of trepidation, not wanting to disturb the curious scene unfolding before him. When he got within a few meters of the other boys, Lestrade turned a bit, then accidentally locked eyes with him. Mycroft tensed up as the brunette flashed a smile at him, a blush blooming on his face.</p><p>Just as soon as the brunette turned to approach him, Sherlock spoke up.</p><p>“Fatcroft,” he sneered, “So nice of you to finally come to my rescue. Had fun watching from afar, did you?”</p><p>“I…I was merely…surprised,” Mycroft mumbled quietly, his eyes still stuck on Lestrade.</p><p>When Sherlock noticed that his older brother still wasn’t looking at him but at the Hufflepuff, a broad grin curled on his lips. “Oh! So this is–?”</p><p>Mycroft immediately rushed over to Sherlock’s side, clamping a hand over his tyrannical little brother’s mouth and giving Lestrade an apologetic smile. “Oh, please do not mind my little brother. But I really must thank you for keeping him in check, Mr…?”</p><p>“Lestrade. Greg Lestrade,” he held out his hand to shake, an idiotic grin on his face.</p><p>The auburn-haired teen let go of Sherlock and shook the offered hand firmly, heart hammering faster in his chest as he felt calloused fingers curl around his own. He hesitantly let go of the older boy’s hand as he turned to look down at the Gryffindor. It took a while for him to realise that Mycroft was asking for his name.</p><p>“Oh. Um. John Watson.” He offered his hand to shake, and Mycroft took that as well.</p><p>“I must thank you two again,” Mycroft said with a tight-lipped smile, before glancing at his brother. “Who knows what he might’ve done if you two hadn’t come along…”</p><p>“I wouldn’t have done anything!”</p><p>“Hush you,” Mycroft glared at his little brother, before turning back to look at the two boys. “Thank you again,” he said, at the two boys, but mostly at Lestrade, “For helping Sherlock, I mean.”</p><p>“Oh, was no problem,” Lestrade shrugged, “Was just doing my job, being a prefect and all that,” he said sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck and unable to look at Mycroft with him smiling like that.</p><p>A small silence surrounded them for a bit, the two teens just looking at each other, not knowing what else to say, while the two first years smirked knowingly at them. Mycroft was the first to glance away, a prominent blush starting to bloom on his face.</p><p>“Well,” Mycroft said, but did not continue. He was looking down at his feet, but then narrowed his eyes at Sherlock and John when they snickered.</p><p>“Well,”Greg replied, grinning, “It was nice meeting you, Mycroft.” As he said this, he noticed the badge pinned on Mycroft's chest. His eyebrows rose. “I didn't know you were a prefect?” He said, surprised. “I never see you at any of the prefects meetings, though—or on patrols.” Greg looked at him with a questioning glance, curious.</p><p>Mycroft was surprised that Lestrade was still talking to him. “Yes, well—,” Mycroft hummed, “The Head Boy and Girl prefer to have private meetings with me, since I do have...rather <em>special</em> assignments.” Mycroft smiled a tight lipped smile, unable to say more.</p><p>“Just say that you're Hogwarts' Spymaster and be done with it,” Sherlock scoffed.</p><p>“Sherlock!”</p><p>“What? It's true!”</p><p>“Wait—spymaster?” Greg and John were looking at Mycroft with wide eyes.</p><p>Mycroft was groaning internally. ‘<em>Damn it, ‘Lock,’ </em>he sighed in his mind. He looked around them to see if anyone else heard, and when he was sure that no one had, he cast a quick immobilization spell on the three students and quickly pulled them into the shadows.</p><p>When they were alone, he released the spell, biting his lip as he watched the three gasp for air as they came to. A small frown tugged on Mycroft's lips as he watched Lestrade shake himself a bit to get rid of the after effects of the spell. ‘<em>Such a shame</em>,’ Mycroft thought, ‘<em>Just when I finally had the chance to talk to him, I have to...</em>’</p><p>“I have to obliviate you, Lestrade.”</p>
