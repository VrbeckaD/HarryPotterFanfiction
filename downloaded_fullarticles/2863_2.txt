Which I shan't do again) So, I wanted to make a special this year instead</p><p>And, as usual, tons and tons of characters. Which, honestly, is why I stopped using OCs in stories tbh. Way too many characters there to already pick and choose from. Anyyyyyways</p><p>For the record, this will include references to all my fandoms, and I have a fair bunch of them. It will also include references to my all my stories, either written, stuffed somewhere in my drafts, or stuck in my head for now.

  <strong>UnknownUnseenUnheard's Christmas Special, 2018</strong>
</p><p>Sora sighed, looking up at their handiwork. Leon had been skeptical when Sora had told him his plans, but had agreed nonetheless. Sora was glad. Villains Vale had never looked more cheery, which was a really weird sentence now that Sora thought about it.</p><p>Decorations here and there, lights strung all over the damn thing, people running back and forth setting the place up(mostly house elves, to be honest, since even Sora couldn't get enough volunteers to turn get massive castle in tip top shape in such short order).</p><p>Preparing for a Christmas bash was busy work, even with massive creepy castles to go with it. Jack Skellington seemed to be having a blast setting all the decorations, though.</p><p>"I can't believe you invited me! I'm so excited!" Jack all but gushed as he busied himself setting more lights.</p><p>Sora laughed.</p><p>"Of course I invited you! I invited everyone." Sora revealed.</p><p>Jack blinked down at him. How he managed to do so without eyes was something Sora was still trying to wrap his head around. Still, Jack managed it, because of course he did.</p><p>"Everyone?" Jack repeated.</p><p>"Everyone." Sora affirmed.</p><p>Suddenly, an arm appeared out of literally nowhere, draping itself over Sora's shoulder. The young Keyblade wielder eeped in surprise, turning his head to gaze at the red leather clad six foot tall Canadian towering behind him.</p><p>"Including me! You're favorite friendly Christmas lovin' Deadpool!" The assassin crooned. Actually crooned.</p><p>"Deadpool?" Sora exclaimed, surprised. "What are you doing here?"</p><p>When had this become a Marvel crossover?</p><p>Oh. Wait. Disney owned Marvel now. Duh.</p><p>Deadpool tsked, wagging his finger at Sora.</p><p>"Sora, Sora, Sora. 'Course I'm here! After all, yours truly has a starring role in From the Heart II!" Deadpool proclaimed, taking a step back and trailing a hand seductively down his torso, head tossed back as he shamelessly splayed himself.</p><p>Sora gaped.</p><p>"Wait, you do? When did that happen?"</p><p>Deadpool shrugged.</p><p>"Who knows. Although… If the author could hurry it up and introduce me, that would be great!" Deadpool shook his fist at the sky.</p><p>Sora continued gaping.</p><p>"But- but- aren't you a little, you know, not PG friendly to be in a Kingdom Hearts crossover?" Sora asked.</p><p>Deadpool squealed, chin cupped in his hands as he swayed back and forth.</p><p>"Oh, my good little Padawan, already breaking the fourth wall! I have much to teach you, my new apprentice!"</p><p>Elsewhere, Young Xehanort could only blink in astonishment as he received his own Christmas bash invitation, wondering if this was some sort of elaborate trap by the Keyblade welder to trap him. But no, it was not.</p><p>When Sora said everyone he, quite literally, meant everyone.</p><hr/><p>

Yuffie exclaimed, jumping up and down in joy.</p><p>Leon could concede this, he supposed. Sora had, in the matter of a few hours, somehow managed to convert Villains Vale into a sunny happy Christmasy place.</p><p>Well. As Christmasy as something can get when one of the decorators is Jack Skellington the Pumpkin King.</p><p>"Well, well. Look at what we have here. Puberty boy. Who would have thought."</p><p>No, no, noooo. Please tell me Sora didn't… Leon turned, and groaned, burying his face in his hands. Sora had. There, striding straight towards him with obvious purpose, was the one person Leon had never wanted to see again, in this life or the next.</p><p>Of course he would survive the fall of the world. As annoying as he was, even Leon could admit, Seifer Almasy was tenacious. Of course he'd survive the end of the world. Seifer literally existed just to annoy Leon, so this shouldn't be as surprising as it was.</p><p>Then, an arm was yanking insistently at his sleeve.</p><p>"Oh hey, who's the blond hottie? Introduce me?" Yuffie begged.</p><p>Oh hell no. Leon would rather tangle with another Heartlessfied Malboro.</p><p>"I'm not dealing wi-</p><p>"Squall!"</p><p>Leon froze. Froze, then turned, slowly. There, making her way towards him past the throngs of people going in and out of Villians Vale, was none other than Quistis.</p><p>Leon gaped. He couldn't help it.</p><p>Quistis reached him, smiled at him, then wrapped him in a quick hug.</p><p>"It's good to see you." His former instructor told him, pulling away. Leon still stood there, stock still, mouth hanging wide open because, what?</p><p>"Oh wow. I don't think I've ever seen him so shocked." Yuffie commented.</p><p>"I have, when I gave him that scar. Ruined his pretty widdle model looks." Seifer drawled.</p><p>"Nah, you just gave him a sexy scar." Yuffie disagreed. "And, I see he returned the favor!" Yuffie eyed Seifer up and down appreciatively.</p><p>Leon just had to facepalm at that. Trust Yuffie's idiotic banter to knock him out of a funk. Leon couldn't help but laugh. Looking around, he realized this party might not be such a bad idea after all.</p><hr/><p>

Sora could not help but gape.</p><p>The other man, tall and exposing and probably three times Sora's size(this, sadly, was not an underestimation, not only was the man was huge, Sora was… Well. Tiny tiny) gazed down at Sora impassively.</p><p>Beside them, Riku facepalmed.</p><p>"Sora… You've met my dad before." Riku reminded him.</p><p>Sora flailed his arms. "But- but- but- I thought Sephiroth was your dad!" Sora exclaimed.</p><p>"Sephiroth?" Riku spluttered so bad he got half his drink all over his shirt. "What on earth gave you that idea?"</p><p>"The hair! And the aura! And the hair!"</p><p>Riku was not impressed.</p><p>Neither, it seemed, was his father.</p><p>Globez, Riku's father, turned towards Cecil.</p><p>"Are all humans this odd?" He questioned his brother.</p><p>"I- er. Occasionally?" Cecil confessed.</p><p>Sora continued to splutter, arguing with Riku back and forth about how there was no way Golbez could be his dad because it was obviously Sephiroth and Riku looked so much like Kadaj so why wouldn't Riku listen to reason and realize he'd been adopted?</p><p>Kairi and Rosa stood to the side, watching on impassibly.</p><p>"Boys?" Kairi asked.</p><p>"Boys." Rosa agreed, no more words needing being said.</p><hr/><p>

I slaughter all the Keyblade wielders, the Keyblade War is averted because, hello, I've taken out the main combatants, and the universe is saved." Kuja dismissed.</p><p>Zidane glared.</p><p>"You're opponent is a Genin!" The genome snapped.</p><p>"Half a dozen Genin," Kuja corrected, "Half a dozen Genin that will fall in the great Genin massacre."</p><p>"What kind of S-Ranked missing nin attacks Genin?"</p><p>"What kind of Genin runs around with a weapon capable of destroying planets?" Kuja countered.</p><p>Suddenly, two menacing presences appeared behind the two bickering brothers. Kuja turned.</p><p>Cloud and Rosso glared at him.</p><p>"Touch a hair on Sora's head…" Cloud began.</p><p>"And we vill end you." Rosso concluded in a hiss.</p><p>Beside them, Zack stood, eyes narrowed, glancing back and forth between them.</p><p>"Oh lookie, the assassin I set on Ashina Uzumaki actually has a heart for something other than herself." Kuja taunted.</p><p>"Sora did not come home for dinner. He's grounded." Rosso snapped.</p><p>Cloud groaned.</p><p>"Really, Rosso? That's where you're going with this? Really?" Cloud asked the woman, exasperated.</p><p>"That boy needs to learn manners." Rosso snapped. "If you vill not teach him, it falls to me. As usual."</p><p>"Oh my god," Zack gasped, causing the two to turn. Zack was looking straight at Cloud. "You two slept together, didn't you!?" Zack accused, pointing a finger wildly.</p><p>"What? How'd you come to that conclusion-" Zidane began, but stopped when he realized both Cloud and Rosso had turned as red as Rosso's hair.</p><p>"This discussion is pointless," Terra announced, standing protectively before Naruto, "Because, if Kuja comes near any Uzumaki under my protection, well… Eraqus tried it, didn't turn out well for him." Terra said darkly.</p><p>"Wait," Zidane's eyes went wide, turning towards the other. "Did you kill Eraqus in this AU, even though you didn't in canon?"</p><p>"I certainly had more motivation to." Terra all but snarled.</p><p>O… Kay. That was ominous.</p><p>"I think we can all agree that Eraqus is bad and leave it at that." Sasuke decided to interject.</p><p>Nods met this statement.</p><p>"We can also agree that Kuja is just as bad since his motives for trying to kill Sora and Naruto are practically identical to the reason Eraqus tried to execute Ven." Sasuke continued.</p><p>Kuja cringed as he was shot several glares.</p><p>"Oh, screw you all. I'm going to save the universe, no matter the price."</p><hr/><p>

Noctis could not help but question.</p><p>"Who knows. Maybe the author was dropped too many times as a baby." Riku said.</p><p>Deadpool ignored them. Instead, he turned towards Leo and squealed some more.</p><p>"And you! I'm gonna find you and train you and you will be my best little firebending buddy ever!"</p><p>"Wha?" Leo blinked.</p><p>"Hey! You stay away from Leo!" Jason snarled.</p><p>"Oh, relax. I won't let Deadpool corrupt him." Anakin.2 said. Deadpool whimpered at him. "Much." He conceded, much to Deadpool's joy.</p><p>"Waiiiit, you're in the story too?" Sora turned on him.</p><p>"Yes!" Anakin.2 proclaimed, fist pumping. "Spoiler alert, but I'm stranded on Robot City, which is where Leo will crash land after Destiny Island falls." Anakin.2 revealed.</p><p>Jason considered this.</p><p>"Okay… You're logical and sane, so I can roll with that." Jason said before turning to glare at Deadpool. "But, what is that then! Why is he saying he's going to corrupt Leo?!"</p><p>"He's my bodyguard." Anakin.2 shrugged.</p><p>"Bodyguard!?"</p><p>"YES! I'm his precious guardian!" Deadpool declared, draping himself over Anakin.2, who rolled his eyes with a deadpanned expression, evidently used to Deadpool's over touchy-feely personality.</p><p>"What? Since when?" Percy asked, confused.</p><p>"I-" Anakin.2 blinked before turning to Deadpool. "Why are you my bodyguard, anyways? All I know is you found me After the Fall."</p><p>"The Fall?"</p><p>Deadpool turned.</p><p>"Oooohhh, I can answer this one!" Deadpool jumped up and down, waving his arm exaggeratingly into the air.</p><p>"Er. Deadpool?" Sora said.</p><p>Deadpool beamed. Somehow.</p><p>"The Great Mouse performed a Thanos snap on the Star Wars Universe, fracturing it into pieces! Little Annie here is from one of those shards!" Deadpool waved a hand in the general direction of the youngest Solo kid.</p><p>"The who?" Sora asked.</p><p>Anakin.2 narrowed his eyes.</p><p>"Darth Mickey the Avaricious."</p><p>"Darth WHO?" Sora repeated, jaw dropping slightly.</p><p>"Wait, wait, wait." Nico interrupted, finally speaking up. "That still doesn't explain why you're his bodyguard." Nico pointed out.</p><p>Deadpool got several looks for this.</p><p>"Spoilers!" Deadpool dismissed with a kissing motion.</p><p>Eyes twitched.</p><p>"Whatever. I'm just excited that I get to beat the shit out of Ardyn!" Bartz interrupted.</p><p>Eyes turned to him.</p><p>"Er… Shouldn't that be, you know, my job?" Noctis asked him.</p><p>Bartz expression became so dark and twisted that for a second Anakin.2 thought he was in the presence of another Sith Lord.</p><p>"I'm going to slaughter that wannabe king and paint the ground with his insides." Bartz declared, the air around him suddenly beginning to cackle with raw magical energy.</p><p>Noctis decided to take a tiny step back. Yes, Bartz was normally the most easygoing of them, but right now? He was downright menacing. The hell did Ardyn do?</p><p>Noctis wondered if this is what the old adage, beware the nice ones meant.</p><p>"I think we can all agree that, whatever the reason, Ardyn probably deserves it."

The Kryptonite laced gun remained locked right under his chin, Jason Todd gazing at him with his lips snarled back. Behind the former Robin stood the first Robin, arms crossed while given Kon a narrow eyed look.</p><p>"Oh, come on! What the hell did I do?" Kon complained, because really? Red Hood threatening him was nothing new. Red Hood threatened people every other day and usually followed it up by blasting the place up.</p><p>Nightwing, though? Kon had thought they were bros!</p><p>Nightwing finally uncrossed his arms, striding forth. Kon relaxed. Ah. Good. Nightwing was coming to his senses. Kon continued to think this for all of the three seconds it took Nightwing to draw an Escrima Stick, jabbing it under Kon's chin along with the gun.</p><p>Ah hell. They'd both snapped. Hm. Maybe he could use tactile telekinesis to pin them both in place long enough to escape? Wait, no, that would never work, these two were trained by Batman, of all people. He'd never get past them. His literal only choice would be to beg for mercy buy ha, noooope. Kon didn't beg.</p><p>"What are your intentions towards our little brother, clone?" Red Hood suddenly growled out, the barrel of the gun digging into Kon's chin.</p><p>Wait, what?</p><p>Red Hood wasn't serious, was he?</p><p>One look at Nightwing confirmed that, yes, apparently they were totally serious.</p><p>Oh fuck. This was it. This was the end. Kon was going to die a virgin at the hands of a pair of overprotective brothers over someone he was not even dating.</p><p>"Kon? KON! Where are you! You won't believe who I just met and- woah, hey, what is going on here?" A new voice joined the fray.</p><p>Ah shit.</p><p>"Run, Bart! Save yourself!" Kon yelled out.</p><p>"What? I can't do that! Dad would kill me!"</p><p>Kon twitched.</p><p>"FOR THE LAST TIME, I AM NOT THE MOM!" Kon's annoyance momentarily overrode his fear as he turned to yell at Bart.</p><p>Bart rolled his eyes.</p><p>"No, no. You're definitely the Team Mom. Tim's the dad. I'm the annoying bratty kid. Annnnnd Cassie is the awesome badass aunt that takes me to all the fun places!" Barts jumped up and down in excitement, seemingly have already forgotten that he was here to save Kon from two apparently psychotic former Robins.</p><p>Then, miraculously, the gun and the escrima stick lowered. Kon could only blink in astonishment. Okay, yeah, he was grateful and all, but why where they letting him go when only a few seconds ago they were willing to blow his brains out all over the castle wall?</p><p>"Wait, you're the mom of the group? Not Tim? So… That must mean…"</p><p>…</p><p>Oh hell no! Kon spluttered, unsure what to think. Of all the asinine, sexist things to- a hand appeared over his mouth before Kon could exclaim his fury.</p><p>"Yeah, totally. So, I gotta take Mommy back to Daddy, thanks, bye!" Barts dashed them away before Kon could even blink, leaving Nightwing and Red Hood muttering to each other in surprised voices.</p><p>"You so owe me." Barts declared. Kon wasn't sure whether to hug him or smack him.</p><hr/><p>

And, by scroll, they meant check the next page because it sure as hell wasn't on the first.</p><p>Minato twitched, glaring at the pair of them.</p><p>"At least the two of you have your story somewhat written.

"Which, frankly, only works since I couldn't kill the Kyuubi properly and part of it is still on our world. I get yanked back to my body, get my kid, and get the hell out of dodge." Minato continued.</p><p>Kakashi's jaw dropped.</p><p>"Wait, you abandon Konoha, sensei?"</p><p>Minato's expression hardened.</p><p>"Konoha abandoned me when they took my last wish and hope and trampled all over it."

"Different versions of me, obviously."</p><p>Surrounding him were the many versions of him, scattered across time. Seriously. Harry was starting to wonder if he wasn't secretly Xehanort with how many different versions of himself there apparently were.</p><p>Bobby Singer cracked his knuckles.</p><p>"Obviously, boy. I swear, I'm surrounded by idjits."</p><p>That one was one of Harry's favorite versions of himself. Anyone who took out Voldemort with a goddamn sniper rifle was good in his book.</p><p>"Hey, lay off the kid a bit." Han Solo chided.</p><p>Solo actually hadn't taken out Voldemort. On the other hand, he had liquified Bellatrix Lestrange in a moment of awesome pissed off rage, so Harry could wave that off. Even if his reincarnation had arguably been Harry's messiest life to the point where Solo used a bloody reset button to get out of the mess he'd gotten himself into.</p><p>A Darth Sidious possessed Dumbledore was a terrifying thought.</p><p>"Herbivores. Let me nap or I will note you all to death." Hibari snapped.</p><p>Flamel had actually gotten off his eternal ass and done something in Hibari's timeline. And, by something, Harry meant fixing Voldemort's shattered psyche and proceeding to turn him into a child. Who got adopted by Cedric Diggory, of all people.</p><p>"If you wanna nap, the fuck are you doing here, pretty boy?" Grimmjow growled.</p><p>Harry was pretty sure Grimmjow was sleeping with Kurosaki. There. He said it. Those two fought like they had wild hate sex.</p><p>Well, that, and he had successfully freaked Dumbledore out enough that Grimmjow was literally fighting his own side in a three way war.</p><p>A three way war that hadn't been updated in wayyy too long.</p><p>"Sleep is for the weak." Gaara said.</p><p>If Harry ever met Gaara's father, he would break his own person thou shalt not kill rule, period</p><p>"Dude. You sleep more than he does, panda eyes." Gray said incredulously.</p><p>Gray got fucked over more by the Ministry than Harry had. He got fucked over so bad it ended with Ginny becoming Ginnymort, which in itself was horrifying when you don't account the fact that Ginny was still alive in there, utterly horrified because her body was moving to someone else's sing and dance.</p><p>"At least you people got multiple chapters." Revan complained.</p><p>"Yeah, me and Revan are way incomplete." Luke Castellan nodded.</p><p>Revan glared.</p><p>"You, at least, got two chapters. I got one and Voldemort got away with the Philosopher's Stone. Can you say cliffhanger?"</p><p>"I got a spin off, motherfuckers!" Grimmjow boasted.</p><p>"A spin off that has not been updated in a year." Gaara's could not help but point out. "Also, a spin off that is far behind based on how far you were in Reincarnation Roulette."</p><p>Grimmjow waved this off dismissible.</p><p>"Who cares, fuckhead? I got a spin off and you don't, I gotta spin off and you don't-"</p><p>Revan lifted a hand lazily. Grimmjow gasped, choking for breath.</p><p>"Stop it. I have a headache from all the genderbending. You have absolutely no idea what hell that does to your hormone state." Revan complained.</p><p>"Gender bending?" Harry repeated dully. What?</p><p>Revan nodded, rubbing at his aching head.</p><p>"Yes. Me and the Exile both suffer from it.

Gray corrected.</p><p>"This Ranma gig is getting old. How does the Exile deal? They never get phased by it!"</p><p>"I think," Gaara began, "that we ought to forget about that and remember my story. After all, I have to fight Herpo the Foul."</p><p>Harry was confused.</p><p>"Herpo The Who?"</p><p>Gaara shot him an incredulous look.</p><p>"Herpo the Foul. The father of the Dark Arts. Lord of darkness. Inventor of Horcruxes and the first to successfully breed a basilisk." Gaara explained.</p><p>"And he's still alive?" Harry said, alarmed.</p><p>"He was suppose to be the big bad for the Next Gen series, but that got discontinued." Revan explained.</p><p>"Next Gen? What's that?"</p><p>As one, Harry's reincarnates turned to gaze off into some dark corner of the castle.</p><p>"The forgotten stories." they each murmured ominously.</p><p>Okkkay.

Other than Shizuo putting Izaya through a wall. Nothing could have stopped that one from happening.</p><p>"Oh? That! That one's easy peasy, Sky boy." Deadpool said. Sora turned to him, confused.</p><p>Deadpool responded by drawing a pair of pistols, opening wild fire up to the ceiling were the ysalamir had made their nests.</p><p>"Wade! Stop!" Sora cried out.</p><p>Deadpool paused even as magic began to seep back into the general area as about two dozen ysalamir fell from their perches, dead.</p><p>Sora face palmed.</p><p>"Wade! You can't just go around killing your problems!" Sora scolded.</p><p>"Why not? That's exactly what you did to the Organization and the Heartless."</p><p>Sora opened his mouth before closing it again with a snap. Ah hell.</p><p>"That was different."</p><p>To this, Deadpool raised an eyebrow. Somehow. That mask had magical properties. "Oh really! They seem more like helpless creatures to me. Could of be you believe in euthanasia!?"</p><p>Sora would like to deny this, but, to be blunt, that's exactly what he'd been doing every time he killed a Heartless or a Nobody.</p><p>"Anyways," Deadpool turned to shake his fist at the sky. "We didn't get our villains panel! Or the Subject of Memory Section! Or a Supernatural section either! Or an Assassination Classroom one! Or one for Strategic Retreat! This is offensive! Evil! Twisted! Lemon scented!"</p><p>Sora decided then and there and Deadpool and Gintoki could never ever meet. The multiverse would not survived. Nope. Not at all. Anyways, back to cleaning.</p></div>
