  <strong>Chapter One</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky - and huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the ground right in front of them. </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>If the motorcycle is huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and least 5 times as wid. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and a beard hid most of his face, his hands the size of trash can lid and his feet in their leather boots were like baby Dolphins. In his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets. </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sending relieved. “At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?”</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore sir,” said the giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle is he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me I've got him Sir.”</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> “No problems were there?”</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>“No Sir  - the house was almost destroyed, but I got him out right before the Muggles started swarming around. He fell asleep as I was flying over Bristol. </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible was a baby boy fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they can see it curiously shape cut like a Bolt of lightning. </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>“Is that where- ?” whispered Professor McGonagall.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>“Yes” said Dumbledore, he’ll have that scar forever.”</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>“Couldn’t you do something about it Dumbledore?”</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>“Even if I could I wouldn't, scars can come in handy I have one myself above my left knee that's the perfect map of London Underground. Well give him – give him here Hagrid - we better get this over with.”</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys house.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> “Could I - could I say goodbye to him Sir?” asked Hagrid. He bent his great shaggy head over Harry and gave him one must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog. </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>“Shh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the muggles!”</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>“Sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large spotted handkerchief in burying his face in it. “But I can't stand it Lily and James dead and poor Harry off to live with Muggles-”</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>“Yes, yes it's very sad but get a grip on yourself Hagrid or we’ll be found,” professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walk to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the door step took a letter out of the cloak and tucked inside Harry’s basket and then came back to the other 2. For a full minute the 3 of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shown from Dumbledore’s eye seemed to have gone out.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>“Well” said Dumbledore finally that's that we have no business staying here. We may as well go enjoy the celebrations.”</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice. “I'll be taking Sirius his bike back. G’night, Professor McGonagall – Professor Dumbledore sir.”</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Wiping streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve Hagrid swung himself on to the motorcycle and kick the engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>“I shall see you soon I expect Professor McGonagall,” said Dumbledore nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street on the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once and 12 balls of lights sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see a bundle of blankets on the number on the step number 4. </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>“Good luck Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel in with the swish of his cloak, he was gone. </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>That's the way this story originally was supposed to turn out. What no one noticed was that as Professor McGonagall, Professor Dumbledore and Hagrid left to join the celebrations there was someone else nearby. Someone who watched with fascination as 3 magical beings left a child on the door step of the most ordinarily boring house he had ever seen.</p>
<p>He walked up to the door step where a small baby with jet black hair and a curious little lightning Bolt scar on his forehead was sleeping in the cold November night. He picked up the baby and said with a smirk on his face, “Well now this isn’t this an interesting situation. I wonder, who in their right mind would ever leave you here? A magical being does not belong with mortals especially one like you.”</p>
<p>“I think you'd be better off with me lad then here in this disturbing suburbia,” he said with a sneer and walked away carrying the baby. As all over Britain people raised their glass say to Harry Potter the Boy-Who-Lived never knowing that Harry Potter now in the arms of one of the most dangerous men ever to walk the earth, the one, the only, Original Hybrid.</p>
