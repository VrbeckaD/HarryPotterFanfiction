    <p>Their story begins on a cloudy day in January. Minerva has been on duty for about three hours and is about to be done with this sorry excuse for a job for the entire rest of the week, when she is made aware of a cluster of Slytherins that are snickering and generally being Slytherins by a friendly Ravenclaw.<br/>
“But don’t tell them I told you”, the puffy girl makes her promise at least three times before she unravels the entirety of the plot. Minerva leaves her right then and there with a quick ‘thank you’ and a warm smile (or at least as luke warm as she can muster) and storms in the general direction of the Slytherins, looking furiously at the one who is obviously behind the whole plot yet again.<br/>
Tom Riddle sees her coming, and to his credit, does not flinch. One day, she is gonna make him flinch, Minerva promises herself.<br/>
“Prefect”, he says courteously, somehow managing to make it sound like an insult<br/>
“Tom.” One day, she decides, she is gonna implode, and then Dippet is gonna shout at her for messing up the hallways while Tom Riddle stands idly by, nodding along. Because that is how her life works.<br/>
“May I help you with anything?” Despite his emotionless mask, the Slytherins behind him are less than innocent-looking. One of them openly sniggers. All are looking at least partly bemused. Riddle is probably gonna lecture them about that later, and they are gonna nod along and try to do better next time.<br/>
All of them, Minerva decides not for the first time in her life, are idiots and deserve to be punished.<br/>
“It has come to my attention that you plan to flood the bathroom in the west wing. Is that correct?”<br/>
“But prefect, why would I do such a thing?”<br/>
“Well, I don’t know, because you have way too much spare time. What are all of you doing here, anyway?”<br/>
“We have a break.” He looks at her like she is dimwitted, and for a moment she considers the possibility that she is indeed dimwitted, because that is the kind of thing that Tom Riddle’s eyes will do to you if they linger too long.<br/>
She is so done with this school.<br/>
“Graduation is only a few short years away”, she murmurs to herself, and then turns back to Riddle and his entourage.<br/>
“Well, since none of your class rooms are even remotely near this spot, and yet the aforementioned bathroom is entirely too near for my liking, I’d bid you to do your waiting in another place.” One of Riddle’s minions, the one with cold eyes and pale skin, positively scowls at her, which is something that she has thought happened only in the bad books that Filius likes to read when he is not doing all of his other reading. He calls it book-eating, which she thinks is hilarious, and he thinks is gonna be an official term in a few years.<br/>
“Of course, prefect.”<br/>
And now she can’t even give him detention, because Tom Riddle has already turned around with a certain elegance that seems to cling to him wherever he goes, his minions following in trail. When Minerva hears about half an hour later that the bathroom has been overflooded by a stupid second year Ravenclaw (incidentally the same girl who gave her the information in the first place), she is not even surprised anymore. She goes to Albus about it, because Dippet won’t listen to her, and he tells her that she is probably right, and that he’ll try to get the Ravenclaw girl off detention at least, but there is nothing he can do to punish Tom Riddle for this new affront to the school rules if he hasn’t even been spotted remotely near to the bathroom, which of course he hasn’t, and he even calls her in to witness for that since she herself had sent him away after all, how he manages sweetly in passing.<br/>
If there is anyone that Minerva McGonagall truly hates, it’s Tom Riddle.</p>
