  <em> “All Student Organisations, Societies, Teams, Groups, and Clubs are henceforth disbanded. An Organisation, Society, Team, Group, or Club is hereby defined as a regular meeting of three or more students. Permission to reform may be sought from the High Inquisitor (Professor Umbridge). No Student Organisation, Society, Team, Group or Club my exist without the knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor. Any student found to have formed or to belong to an Organisation, Society, Team, Group, or Club that has not been approved by the High Inquisitor will be expelled. The above is in accordance with educational decree number 24.”   </em>
</p>
<p>Hermione’s heart sank lower and lower as she read Umbridge’s latest decree aloud to Harry and Ron. It was obviously targeted at the three of them and the meeting they’d hosted last weekend in Hogsmeade. How in the world had that <em> hag </em>heard about it?</p>
<p>“What does this mean?” Ron said, much too loudly. “She can’t mean our Defense—”</p>
<p>“Study Group!” Hermione interrupted quickly, glancing around to make sure no one was listening. She caught Pansy Parkinson’s beady eyes for a moment before the Slytherin girl turned away. “Where I tutor you and Harry after Umbridge’s classes every week…”</p>
<p>“Yes. Maybe she’s mad I’m improving in her class; you know how she feels about me,” Harry added loudly; he looked her in the eyes and gave her a small nod, letting her know he’d realized what she was up to. The middle of a crowd of students from all four houses was not the ideal time and place to discuss such a sensitive matter as their attempted rebellion, after all.</p>
<p>“We should go to breakfast,” Hermione said firmly, looping one arm through each of the boys’ and starting to pull them along. The other students parted for them, and once they were a little ways down the corridor, Harry muttered softly,</p>
<p>“How did she find out, do you think? Did someone tell?”</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head. “No, I don’t think so; if they had, we would know…”</p>
<p>Both of the boys looked puzzled, and Ron asked, “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Hermione cringed slightly. She’d not yet figured out a way to casually bring up her little “safety measure” yet. She didn’t think they’d be proud, at least, not in a way she wanted people to be proud of her. “It’s… not important. I’ll explain later.”</p>
<p>They’d reached the Great Hall, so she released her friends’ arms and strode over to their customary place at the Gryffindor table. Once they were seated, she glanced up at Harry and noticed him directing a sour look towards the staff table, where the pink toad in question was smiling smugly and sipping tea out of a dainty china teacup.</p>
<p>“What are we going to do?” he muttered as his jaw clenched visibly. “Her reign is getting more and more draconian…”</p>
<p>“Speaking of dragons,” Ron mumbled around a bite of toast, “look over at the Slytherin table.” He pointed a finger and Hermione’s eyes followed his gesture until they landed on a certain head of white-blonde hair. “Malfoy sure looks like he’s in a good mood. Wonder if <em> he </em>had anything to do with, slimy git...”</p>
<p>The Slytherin Prefect in question happened to look their way just then, and when he saw them looking, his customary smirk turned into a nasty sneer. He was surrounded by his usual gang of hanger-ons, including Pansy Parkinson, who’d slid herself into the seat next to him and was clinging onto his arm, whispering something into his ear. She too looked towards the trio of Gryffindors and grinned nastily. Hermione suspected she must be relating that slight hint Ron had revealed in the hallway.</p>
<p>“Just watch him take advantage of this, somehow,” Ron said after he had swallowed. He jabbed his finger in the direction of their table, and Hermione realized he was gearing up for another one of his long-winded anti-Slytherin rants. “Those slimy, weaselly Slytherins can’t go an hour without thinking about how to get ahead! They don’t care who else they throw under the hippogriff’s hooves in the process, not even if it leads to a madman taking over the world--”</p>
<p>“Apparently not all the Slytherins are happy about this, though,” Harry interrupted, cutting their friend off before he could really get going. He nodded over towards the end of the table opposite Malfoy, where the other half of the Slytherin fifth years sat. In the very center of the clump a dark-haired young man was currently sending a dark glare towards the Prefect of his own house. “Take a look at Riddle; I don’t think I’ve ever seen him look so angry. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him show that much emotion at all; he’s usually such a robot.”</p>
<p>Ron laughed heartily around another mouthful of food. “Yeah! That’s a perfect description! Riddle’s a row-beet… Er, what’s that, again?”</p>
<p>As Harry sighed and began re-explaining that aspect of muggle culture to Ron, Hermione took a closer look at Tom Riddle. He was something of an enigma within the walls of Hogwarts. Tall, dark and handsome, almost every girl and many of the guys lusted over him (the ones that weren’t too busy throwing themselves at Malfoy, anyway). One of the smartest members of their class, he rivaled both Hermione and Malfoy for the highest marks on any given paper or exam. He’d always found ways of subtly kissing up to the teachers, and had become a veritable teacher’s pet in a way that Hermione had never managed. But despite the fact that his beauty and his brains could have made him one of the most popular students in Hogwarts, he always seemed to hold himself apart from the crowd. He projected an air of distant aloofness, only ever interacting regularly with the handful of other Slytherins he counted as his friends.</p>
<p>Harry was right though, she thought, as she examined his expression. His usual emotionless mask was gone, and had been replaced by an intense anger that sent chills up Hermione’s spine, even from across the room and directed away from her. Was it possible that the tensions that had been slowly brewing within Slytherin house between Riddle and Malfoy’s factions since first year were finally coming to a boiling point, and over one of Umbridge’s insane rules, too? Well, Hermione was glad she wouldn’t have to be in their common room when that happened.</p>
<p>Although that did beg the question, what was so offensive to Riddle about this particular Decree? She tried to remember if he was in any clubs or organizations that would be affected by the edict, but she came up blank. He wasn’t on the Quidditch team, and the thought of someone as self-important as him joining the Gobstones club was almost laughable. Perhaps he had an actual study group or something that met regularly, but surely Umbridge interfering with that wouldn’t make him so… furious.</p>
<p>At exactly the wrong moment, Riddle decided to turn his glare away from Malfoy. His eyes flitted across the Hall before landing on her own. When their gazes met, his eyes narrowed, as if daring her to continue looking. Not one to be intimidated, Hermione kept staring at him, keeping her expression one of casual, indifferent observance. If she looked away, he might think she was embarrassed to be caught looking, which she wasn’t; she wasn’t some simpering schoolgirl with a crush. She was a strategist, trying to gain a better understanding of her opponent.  </p>
<p>Riddle seemed disinclined to back down either, so they stared at each other for over thirty seconds before Blaise Zabini said something that got his attention. Hermione sighed and looked down at her plate, once again wondering what his problem could possibly be. Tom Riddle was <em> never </em>phased, by anything…</p>
<p>She was snapped back to the present when Angelina Johnson came up to talk with Harry and a couple of the Hufflepuffs who’d been at the meeting attempted to wave Hermione over. They had a much more pressing matter to deal with than whatever drama was happening in the Snakes’ dungeon, so she shoved all thoughts of Riddle and his strange reaction into the back of her mind, and began to think of ways to fix their problem. It wasn’t as if it affected her, anyway.</p>

</p>
<p>When Dobby came to them with the idea of the Room of Requirement, Hermione was admittedly skeptical, and felt obligated to voice initial doubts and concerns about safety. But once they started holding meetings, she reveled in the fact that they’d found the <em> perfect </em>space for their illicit lessons. It grew to hold as many members of the newly-christened Dumbledore’s Army as could make it to a meeting, it always furnished itself with whatever objects and tools would be most suited to Harry’s lesson plans, and its magic could be relied upon to keep Umbridge and any spies she might have out. Add in the enchanted Galleons she’d thought up to arrange meeting times and their stint as rule-breakers was going off without a hitch.</p>
<p>Alas, their peace and security was not to last.</p>
<p>Three weeks had passed since the Decree and the start of the DA meetings. She’d taken on much of the organizing responsibilities for working out when meetings should be held, which ended up being a lot of extra work, making the times she set aside for her own private studies and schoolwork all the more sacred. So when she was sitting in her private corner of the library revising for a Charms exam and <em> he </em> approached her, casting a shadow over her textbooks and loudly clearing his throat, she was not in the best of moods.</p>
<p>“What do you want, Riddle?” She asked, knowing who it was without even looking up from her book. He was the only other student who ever came this far back in the stacks, although usually when they were both here they had an unspoken agreement to ignore the other’s presence.</p>
<p>“Tell me how you’re doing it,” he said brusquely, skipping over any sort of pleasantries one might expect when you intend to demand something of someone you’ve only ever spoken to to mock or compare test scores to for the five years you’ve known them.</p>
<p>Hermione raised an eyebrow and lazily turned the page. “Beating you in Care of Magical Creatures?” she said, still not bothering to honor him with her full attention. Maybe if he’d be even the slightest bit civil with her... “It’s called not being a pompous git towards the professor.”</p>
<p>“Oh, not <em> that </em> , I’d only actually care if we had a <em> competent </em> teacher.” Without an invitation, Riddle pulled out the chair next to hers and sat down in it before placing one of his large pale hands over the pages to obscure her view of the text. “I want to know how Potter and your friends are getting around that <em> toad </em>Umbridge and Malfoy’s lackeys.”  </p>
<p>It took all of her willpower, but Hermione was able to stop herself from having a physical reaction to his accusation, which would have given them away at once. Instead, she sighed heavily and carefully creased the corner of the page in her textbook before closing it and gingerly folding her hands on top of it, finally looking up at Tom Riddle with wide and innocent eyes. “I haven’t the faintest idea what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p>She caught a flicker of annoyance in his eyes, which was about the greatest extent of emotion he usually showed. “Don’t play dumb, Granger, it doesn’t suit you. Black heard your inane roommates gossiping about it in the loo.”</p>
<p>Hermione gritted her teeth slightly; it was just like Lavender and Parvati to forget how dire their situation was and let something slip when they shouldn’t. If they were just talking between themselves, her safety-measure wouldn’t have taken effect. And if Riddle was already convinced they were meeting, she doubted she’d be able to dissuade his notorious single-mindedness. But that didn’t mean she was going to just give up their secrets; she would have to deflect. “Honestly, Riddle, that’s none of your business. I’m not even in charge, Harry is leading, so if you want to discuss this you should—”</p>
<p>“I don’t what to talk to <em> Potter</em>,” he snapped, cutting her off. “I’ve come to <em> you</em>. Tell me, or I’ll tell Umbridge you’re still meeting without permission.”</p>
<p>Hermione raised an eyebrow. “Do you have any proof of that? Aside from supposed lavatory gossip, I mean. Because if not, they can’t do anything more than keep a close eye on us, and I can’t <em> imagine </em>them keeping any closer of an eye on Harry than they do already.”</p>
<p>Riddle was silent, and she could see his jaw clench slightly. She couldn’t help but smirk. “That’s what I thought.”</p>
<p>Suddenly he switched tactics, allowing an oh-so-charming smiles to slide across his features and leaning slightly closer so she could see the light glinting off his pearly white teeth. “There has to be a way we can come to some sort of an understanding, Granger,” he said in a voice that was suddenly laden with honey. “Is there anything I could do for you that requires more… finesse than a Gryffindor typically possess?”</p>
<p>Hermione scoffed and opened her mouth, about to reject his offer on principle alone, but paused as she remembered a dilemma she’d been having recently. She really shouldn’t tell him, especially without consulting Harry and Ron about it first, but the DA was not the only thing she was juggling right now. She’d been working on a side project intended to help Harry strengthen his defenses against his enemies, but had recently come across an obstacle she hadn’t yet figured out how to surmount. Protecting Harry was the top priority, even more so than passing their O.W.L.s, she knew that. And Riddle wasn’t <em> with </em> Malfoy and Umbridge; for whatever reason, he was just as against them at the moment as Hermione and her friends were. And while this enemy of their enemy was definitely not their friend, he <em> was </em>someone who could do things that others couldn’t. They could use him. Besides, it wasn’t as if she were the only source of the information about the DA or the Room. There were dozens of other members, after all, and he could probably manipulate some of them into giving up the secret. If she were the one doing the negotiations, at least she maintained some control over the situation, and got something out of it as well.</p>
<p>She chewed her bottom lip for a moment before saying hesitantly, “Actually… There’s a book I want, but… it’s in the Restricted section, and with Umbridge’s latest decree about extracurricular material, I can’t get permission.”</p>
<p>“And your <em> boyfriend </em>can’t get it for you?” Riddle sneered. “I know that Potter’s always sneaking out after hours and getting into places he shouldn’t.”</p>
<p>Hermione rolled her eyes, not even bothering to wonder how Riddle knew that; he had the uncanny knack of gaining sensitive information. “Malfoy’s got his goons parked outside of the Gryffindor Common Room every night so he can’t get out like he used to,” she explained. After a moment she muttered, “And Harry’s <em> not </em>my boyfriend, why does everyone think that?”</p>
<p>“Skeeter’s article last year—” Riddle stopped and shook his head once. “It doesn't matter. Write down the name of this book, and I can get you a copy.”</p>
<p>Hermione pulled out a scrap of parchment and picked up her quill, then scribbled down the name of the tome she was after. As soon as she was done, Riddle snatched the paper out from in front of her and folded it, not even sparing it a glance before shoving it into his pocket. Then he pushed back his chair and stood up, fixing her with another one of his dazzling grins.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s been lovely, Granger,” he said, sarcasm dripping from his tone. “We’ll talk again soon enough.”</p>
<p>He’d turned and walked away before she could manage any sort of reply. As she watched his retreating figure, she couldn't help but feel a knot of anxiety form in her throat. She wasn’t at all sure about giving up the DA’s secret to the likes of Tom Riddle. It wasn’t that he was their enemy, exactly; he wasn’t attempting to establish an educational dictatorship like Umbridge and the Ministry, nor was he allied with the murderous Dark Prince like Malfoy and his pure-blood cohorts were. But there was no love lost between Riddle and Harry, and the rest of Gryffindor House for that matter.</p>
<p>She might hate Divination, but even she could predict that things were about to get dramatically more difficult.</p>

</p>
<p>“What’s your interest in Occlumency?”</p>
<p>Hermione looked up from her potions essay as Riddle once again sidled up to her in her secluded study spot. This time, he had his school bag slung over his shoulder, and from it he pulled out a large book and placed it in front of her on the table. She blinked in surprise as she looked at what appeared to be an old, worn, first edition printing of <em> Magicks of The Mind </em>by Cavalier Vaughn.</p>
<p>She carefully opened the cover and flipped through the first few pages, confirming that it was indeed the book she was after—and was that the author’s signature inside the cover? “How on earth did you get this so quickly?” She finally sputtered, closing the book and looking back up at the haughty Slytherin. It had only been two days since their last conversation, she hadn’t even brought up the idea of telling Riddle about the Room of Requirement to Harry and Ron yet!</p>
<p>Riddle inspected his fingernails, the picture of nonchalance. “I have my ways. Why do you want this book?”</p>
<p>Hermione scowled at him, feeling a surge of annoyance at his promptness. She’d been putting off <em> that </em>conversation with her friends, sure that the difficulty of getting the book would give her more time to figure out the best way to broach the subject. “Is that the question you want me to answer?”</p>
<p>Riddle sighed. “No, I suppose not. Tell me how you’re outsmarting Umbridge.”</p>
<p>Hermione bit her lip. “Well… I actually haven’t talked to Harry about this yet; he’s the one who found our meeting spot, so I should probably see what he thinks before I tell—”</p>
<p>“You should have thought of that before taking the book, then, Granger.” Riddle snapped. “I went through a lot of trouble to get that, you know. You <em> owe </em>me now.”</p>
<p>Hermione stared down at the rare book in front of her, knowing it contained important knowledge she needed if she was going to help Harry overcome his most recent problems with the Dark Prince. But was that worth giving up the DA’s secret meeting spot to someone as self-serving and dubious as Tom Riddle?</p>
<p>But then, there were certainly plenty members of the group she already didn’t trust, not fully. That’s what the parchment had been for. Perhaps that would be enough insurance against Riddle spilling their secret, as well?</p>
<p>“I… think I can tell you,” she said hesitantly, “but… you would have to sign your name first. So would any of your friends you’re going to tell.”</p>
<p>Riddle’s expression was guarded as he looked at her suspiciously. “Sign my name. On what?”</p>
<p>Hermione bit her lip, not wanting to say too much in case he refused. Finally she settled on, “Just a list. A special one. Everyone who knows has signed it.”</p>
<p>Riddle’s eyes narrowed and he held out hand. “Let me see it.”</p>
<p>Hermione scoffed. As if she’d just hand over the list of members of their secret organization for him to walk off with! “Not here! We’d have to meet specially, somewhere we couldn’t be chanced upon. Besides, I don’t even have it with me.” Did he think she was stupid enough to carry something like that around?</p>
<p>Riddle scowled and muttered, “This is unbelievable!” In the blink of an eye, he’d snatched up the book again, slipping it back into his bag. “I’m taking this back until we get this worked out,” he declared, his tone making it clear that she’d caused him a grave inconvenience.</p>
<p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “If you must.”</p>
<p>“Do you know about the secret room on the fifth floor?” Hermione shook her head. “It’s behind the suit of armor that’s missing an arm,” Riddle informed her. “You have to knock on its helmet three times and it’ll open. I’ll be waiting there tomorrow after classes end, and we can do this then. Don’t keep me waiting.”</p>
<p>He left as abruptly as he’d come. When she was sure he was gone, she allowed her head to fall forward onto the table and groaned softly. Just what had she gotten herself into?  </p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>“And <em> when</em>, exactly, were you going to run this by me?” Harry nearly shouted at her as she finished explaining the situation with Riddle.</p>
<p>“Well, um… now,  I suppose,” she said weakly. “And <em> please </em>be quieter; you’ll wake everyone up.” She and Harry were sitting up late in the Gryffindor Common Room, waiting for Ron to get back from a detention with Umbridge. Once the other students had cleared out, Hermione had decided to just rip off the band-aid and get the conversation over with. Perhaps then she wouldn’t spend all day with guilt nagging at the back of her mind.</p>
<p>Harry stood up from his chair and started pacing around the room, gesturing wildly with his hands. “I didn’t even want to do this in the first place, you know! <em> You </em> talked me into it,” he cried, jabbing a finger in her direction. “And now on top of dealing with Umbridge the Ministry and Sanus and Malfoy, we’ve got to somehow trust <em> Tom </em> bloodly <em> Riddle? </em>This is the last thing I need right now! The git’s insufferable!”</p>
<p>Hermione sighed and closed her eyes for a moment, reaching up to massage her aching temples. With the stress of dealing with this secret Defense class business and the situation with Riddle on top of her usual schoolwork, she’d had a tension headache all day, and Harry’s shouting was only making it worse. “Look, I know you two don’t get along—”</p>
<p>“Understatement of the century, ‘Mione,” Harry growled, throwing himself back down on the armchair, his eyes simmering with anger. “He hates my guts. And the feeling is mutual!”</p>
<p>Hermione rolled her eyes “Whatever. The thing is, if we don’t give him what he wants, but on our terms, then he’s going to find some way to make this all come falling down. It’s like the saying: keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.”</p>
<p>Harry scoffed. “Whoever made that saying up clearly never had to suffer through shared lessons with Tom Riddle. But <em> fine</em>. I suppose you’re right. Riddle hates Umbridge as much as we do. And he’s such a nerd that for all we know, he wants a space to do the same thing we’re doing.”</p>
<p>Hermione hummed in response, not wanting to say what she thought about that. It had of course crossed her mind to wonder about what Riddle was so desperate to get a secret space for, and she didn’t think having secret Defense lessons was it. While the lack of proper teaching this year must be getting to him as much as it was to her, he wasn’t the sort to need a teacher or well-structured lessons to learn something; he’d annoyingly always been a natural at DADA, on par with Harry. If anything, he would be the one teaching, and she had a hard time seeing him overly concerned with his friends’ O.W.L.s. No, she suspected his intent was a lot less… wholesome than the DA’s. She’d sometimes gotten a disturbing vibe off of some of his friends, and there had been all those rumors… The strange attacks second year, But she shouldn’t dwell; it wasn’t as if a few fifth years could pose more of a threat than the Dark Prince, after all.</p>
<p>“Anyway, tell me more about this book, and why it’s so important for you to read,” Harry said as he stared into the fireplace, watching the flames dance. Perhaps he was hoping for another secret floo call from home.  </p>
<p>Hermione eagerly seized on the change of subject, knowing that this would be something Harry would find compelling. “Well, you know how you’ve been having so many nightmares about your father’s death lately?”</p>
<p>“I might recall waking up every other night in cold sweat after seeing the life leave my father’s eyes, yes,” Harry responded dryly.</p>
<p>“What if I said I’d thought of a way to stop them?” <b> </b></p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>“I am <em> not </em> signing my name on a piece of paper that says ‘Dumbledore’s Army’ at the top!” Riddle snapped, shoving Hermione’s enchanted parchment back at her. “I’m not interested in <em> joining </em> Potter’s club, I just want to know <em> where </em>in Salazar’s name you’re having your meetings!”</p>
<p>“And I’ll tell you, you just have to sign this parchment first!” Hermione snapped, crossing her arms and refusing to take it from him.</p>
<p>She’d come to the secret room, which was about the size of a generous broom closet, as soon as classes were done. With no time to go back to Gryffindor Tower before the meeting, she’d been forced carry the DA membership list around with her in her school bag. It wasn’t as if they were now conducting random searches of the students’ belongings (yet), and she wasn’t in the habit of losing papers, but she had still been paranoid all day that somehow, it was going to get out and into the wrong hands. The trouble she had taken and the danger she’d put herself and her friends in left her with little patience for this boy’s <em> whining </em>about something as silly as the title on the parchment!</p>
<p>Riddle’s eyes narrowed as he looked down and inspected the list once more. “What curse did you place on it?” he asked after a minute.</p>
<p>Hermione’s brows shot up for a moment, but then she shook herself; she shouldn’t be surprised that Riddle had figured it out. He was almost as clever as she was. And her insistence on him signing it should be dubious to all but the most gullible first-years.  “Nothing too nasty. It’s just a little something that’ll ensure you don’t tell our secrets,” she replied.</p>
<p>Riddle frowned. “My word isn’t good enough?”</p>
<p>Hermione raised her eyebrows as she leaned back against the stone wall. “Name one time in the past four and a half years you or your friends have given me any reason to trust you.”</p>
<p>“Fair enough,” he conceded after a moment of silence, “But I’m still not signing up for Potter’s Dumbledore fan club, and neither will my friends. How about you make <em> another </em>cursed parchment without the stupid title, and we’ll sign that one.”</p>
<p>Hermione rolled her eyes, but she reached into her bag and pulled out her spare roll of parchment. She tore off a section and then sank to the ground, smoothing the paper out on the floor and pulling out her wand. “This is going to take a minute,” she informed Riddle, glancing up at him. He just shrugged and leaned back, gesturing for her to continue. So she turned her concentration onto her work, muttering the incantations she’d developed under her breath and weaving the threads of magic into the paper that would give it the properties of a magical contract.</p>
<p>Once she’d finished, she stowed her wand, stood up, and held out the newly-enchanted parchment to Riddle. To her confusion, he was smirking, his eyes glinting with amusement. “That was a particularly… inventive curse you cast just now. Do the people who’ve signed that list know about it?”</p>
<p>Her silence seemed to give him all the answer he needed, and his smirk grew wider. “Why, Hermione Granger, you <em> bad </em> girl,” he said, in a voice that was almost a purr. “I’m actually impressed! Being sneaky, tricking your friends into entering such a brutal magical contract. What <em> would </em>your precious Potter say?”</p>
<p>Hermione desperately wanted to smack him with something, but the closest object at hand was a piece of parchment, and that certainly wouldn’t leave a mark, so she did her best to stamp out the urge. “Just take it and sign,” she said through gritted teeth. It wasn’t as if she was proud of her safeguard, despite it being necessary; Tom Riddle, Slytherin extraordinaire, complimenting her on it was not helping her feel at peace with her decision.</p>
<p>“Those incantations, they’re based off of an archaic form of the Unbreakable Vow, are they not?” he asked as he took the parchment from her hands and began inspecting it.</p>
<p>Hermione sighed and nodded, finding herself the <em> tiniest </em> bit impressed that he’d been able to pick up on that. “Yes, but I stripped them of their lethal components, <em> obviously </em>.”</p>
<p> Riddle shrugged. “Either way. I’m not judging you; at times like these, loyalty is something that must be ensured, at all costs. Now that I see we’re on the same page about that, I actually feel that much better about working with you,” he said, flashing her a devious grin.</p>
<p>She stared at him. He was joking. He <em> had </em> to be joking. He was making fun of her for having qualms about methods that she had no doubt he’d employ in a heartbeat. “I don’t appreciate your sass,” she spat, crossing her arms in front of her chest. “I don’t know what <em> you </em> are up to, but the problems that me and my friends are dealing with affect the future of our entire <em> society </em>.”</p>
<p>Riddle folded up the blank parchment and slid it into his bag, before looking at her and asking quietly, “You think my friends and I aren’t concerned with wizarding society?”</p>
<p>Hermione scoffed. “Not really, no; forgive me if I can’t picture the members of a house known for their self-serving natures and willingness to backstab others being such altruistic citizens.”</p>
<p>Riddle frowned. “You have quite a… narrow view of Slytherin House, I must say. Aren’t you supposed to be all open-minded and understanding?”</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but scowl at him. How dare <em> he </em>try to critique her on this. “Oh, I try to be; it’s just difficult to want to understand a group known for producing nothing but bigots and dark wizards!”</p>
<p>He scowled right back at her. “Well if that’s what you see us as, I suppose I won’t waste my time trying to change your mind. However, if you or the rest of Potter’s minions are this…antagonistic while we work out the rest of our collaboration, then I’m afraid that I shall cease making an effort to be civil!”</p>
<p>Wait, he’d been ‘civil’ up until now? “Oh, I’m sorry,” Hermione said, rolling her eyes again. “It must be <em> soooo </em>difficult to have to come to us mean, callous Gryffindors for help. Sorry for not falling at your feet and worshipping the ground you walk on like everyone else; I’ll try to do better in the future.” She smiled at him, making it as wide and false as her face could manage. “Shall I curtsy and kiss your ring, My Lord?”</p>
<p>She watched Riddle’s jaw clench and unclench as his eyes simmered with irritation. After a moment, he spoke through clenched teeth. “Very well; if you refrain from ‘sass’, then so will I.” He turned away from her and reached an arm out towards the wall, which he knocked on three times with his fist. As it began to slide and reveal the passage back into the castle, he said, “I intend to follow our negotiations through till the end, you know, and continuously insulting me isn’t going to drive me off; it’s just going to make our interactions less pleasant.” He didn’t look at her again as he stepped out of the door and stomped away from her.</p>
<p>“Because they’re such a cake walk to begin with,” Hermione muttered as she shouldered her bag again and followed him out. She stepped into the corridor just in time to see his robes disappearing around the corner, presumably heading off to the dungeons to plot nefarious schemes or whatever it was he did for fun.</p>
<p>As she began to make her way back to Gryffindor tower, she pondered the situation. Once again, she was forced to ask herself what Riddle could possibly be after. He clearly didn’t get any enjoyment out of talking to her, so only a great need could have driven him to seek her out, to compromise with her, to enter into a magical contract with her, and even (by his own claim) attempt to be ‘civil’. Whatever it was, he must have decided he had no other course of action; Godric only knew how desperate Tom Riddle must be if he was willing to sign her cursed parchment.</p>

<p>When Hermione ducked into the second floor lavatory between her afternoon classes two days after her meeting with Riddle, it was strangely empty for such a busy time. She paid that fact little mind though, until she was washing her hands at the sink and Tracey Davis entered the bathroom, walking straight up to Hermione.</p>
<p>Skipping over any formalities, Davis produced a rolled up piece of parchment from her bag and held it out. “Granger, this is for you. Tom wants to know how soon you can meet with him again.”</p>
<p>Hermione was a little taken aback by her abruptness, but it wasn’t nearly as bad as Riddle himself; her tone was more business-like and straightforward than arrogant and demanding. So she sighed, and after turning off the faucet and drying her hands, she took the parchment from Davis’ hand. When she unrolled it she saw that in addition to Riddle’s neatly curving signature at the top of the page there were five other names scrawled onto the parchment: Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott, Benedict Lestrange, Carina Black, and Tracey Davis. Riddle’s friends. They weren’t Hermione’s favorite classmates by any means, but they were somewhat preferable to the Slytherins who hung out with Malfoy, like Parkinson, or Crabbe and Goyle.</p>
<p>“This is everyone who he’s going to tell about our room?” Hermione asked as she rolled the parchment back up and slipped it into her own bag. Later she would have to double check her enchantments to make sure Riddle hadn’t tampered with them. She wouldn't put it past him or his friends to try and work their way around her contract.</p>
<p>Davis nodded, still watching Hermione expectantly. Hermione pulled another scrap of parchment from her bag and quickly scribbled down a time and location and then handed it over. “Tell him to come alone for the first time, and to make sure he’s not followed up to the seventh floor. If for some reason he can’t make that time tonight, I’ll be waiting there tomorrow, same time.”</p>
<p>“Understood.” Davis didn’t even glance at the paper before pocketing it, turning around, and leaving the lavatory. As Hermione watched the girl’s long blonde braid disappear through the doorway, she couldn’t help but feel a knot of anxiety forming in her throat. Once she showed Tom Riddle the Room of Requirement and he brought his friends there, there would be no going back. Their secret would be that much less secure, there would be six more potential leaks, even with her jinx on the parchment…</p>

<p>That afternoon was not a pleasant one for Hermione; Harry had not been happy with her when she told him she was showing Riddle the Room that night, and Ron, whom she’d purposely neglected to tell about the whole business, had to be informed, and was now not speaking to her. Dinner was silent and tense, and Hermione left the Great Hall well before anyone else had finished their meal, deciding to go early to meet Riddle. She was expecting to be standing at the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy for a good ten minutes before he arrived, but when she finished making the climb up the moving staircases, it was to find him already there, leaning against the blank expanse of wall right where the door to the Room would appear.</p>
<p>“You’re early,” she said once she was within earshot.</p>
<p>He smirked as she approached. “So are you.” His tone was smug and amused, but not as angry as she expected it to be, given how they’d last parted.</p>
<p>“Did you bring my Occlumency book?” she asked, stopping in front of him and crossing her arms.</p>
<p>Riddle nodded. “I’ll hand it over as soon as you bring me to your meeting room.”</p>
<p>Hermione grinned. This part was going to be fun. “I already have.”</p>
<p>Riddle furrowed his brow and frowned slightly. “I’m afraid I don’t take your meaning.”</p>
<p>Rather than explain, Hermione started walking, making her first pass in front of the door before spinning around to make the second, thinking over and over again, <em> I need to show Tom Riddle what he’s looking for</em>.</p>
<p>“Granger, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>Still not replying, she spun on her heels again to make the third pass.</p>
<p>“If you’re trying to make a joke, I must warn you that I don’t—<em>bloody hell </em>!”</p>
<p>The stone wall behind Riddle had suddenly transformed into a door, causing him to fall backwards about an inch. He pushed himself off of it and took a step back, gaping at the newly materialized entrance.</p>
<p>“If I may,” Hermione said, slipping her body between him and the door and pushing it open. The Room was smaller than it became for DA meetings, but there were about twice as many bookshelves. The walls were now hung with green and silver tapestries, likely to honor the intended users of this room, and in the center there was a raised dais, on which an elegant black table with six high-backed chairs was placed.</p>
<p>Riddle was standing in the doorway, speechless and slack-jawed, so Hermione took the opportunity to investigate one of the nearby shelves, curious to see what sort of books the Room had selected for Riddle. Just scanning the titles caused her to frown. They appeared to deal with subjects she’d only ever seen mentioned in the Restricted section… rather <em> dark </em>it seemed to her…</p>
<p>“What is this place?”</p>
<p>She turned around and saw that Riddle had finally stopped gawking long enough to shut the door and begin to explore the room. He’d made it onto the dais and was standing with one hand on the back of a chair.</p>
<p>“It’s called the Come-and-Go Room, or the Room of Requirement,” Hermione explained, going over to stand by him. “It takes the shape of whatever a person has need of when they walk past it. And this,” she said, gesturing to the room around them, “Is apparently what you need. That’s what I asked for, anyway.”</p>
<p>“So it doesn’t look like this for you?”</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head. “No, can you imagine twenty five people stunning each other in here? It can get a lot bigger. Or a lot smaller; Fred and George say they’ve hidden in it as a broom closet once.”</p>
<p>A slow grin was spreading across Riddle’s face as he turned around, his eyes passing over everything as if he were savoring the sight.</p>
<p>“No one else knows about this?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Only Dumbledore and Dobby the house elf, as far as I know,” Hermione said. “And neither of them are inclined to share secrets with Umbridge.</p>
<p>A brief shadow had crossed Riddle’s face when she mentioned Dumbledore, but it was gone in a second. “Well, Granger, I must admit,” he said, shaking his head, “I had my doubts about what you could deliver, but I’m pleased to have been proved so very wrong.” Riddle reached into his bag and pulled out the Occlumency book and handed it to her. “I’m more than happy to let you have this now; it’s yours to keep.”</p>
<p>Hermione nodded and stowed it away. Reading it, mastering it, and then somehow getting Harry to learn it would be her next major side project. She was sure that it would take a lot of time and effort; thank Merlin she and Riddle had finished their negotiations and he would stop randomly accosting her in the Library…</p>
<p>“This is… perfect,” she heard him mutter, half to her and half to himself. “To think Potter discovered something so amazing about this castle before me. I wonder how soon I can get a meeting set up? Maybe Wednesday, if Slughorn doesn’t assign another essay…“</p>
<p>“Umm…” Hermione crossed her arms in front of her chest as he turned to look at her. “I’m afraid you can’t have a meeting here Wednesday night; the DA’s having our own meeting then.”</p>
<p>Riddle’s expression quickly soured as he matched his stance. “I see. And just how often do you use this Room? Because I have things I need to do as well; long-term projects that we need to get set up and restarted, sensitive matters I need to discuss with my friends in absolute privacy…”</p>
<p>Hermione scowled at him. “That’s all well and good, but you know, we were here first, and we’re not going to be pushed on your whim.”</p>
<p>“Granger, I <em> need </em>this Room.”</p>
<p>“And so do we!”</p>
<p>The two of them glared at each other for a long minute before Riddle sighed and said, very reluctantly, “It appears that we will have to come to some sort of… scheduling arrangement.”</p>
<p>“The DA doesn’t have a set schedule, we call meetings on a week to week basis,” Hermione informed him stiffly.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, and his next words sounded heavily forced out. “Well then, I suppose we’ll have to… meet up every week, and… discuss it.”</p>
<p>And just like that, Hermione found herself faced with dealing with Tom Riddle for the foreseeable future.</p>
