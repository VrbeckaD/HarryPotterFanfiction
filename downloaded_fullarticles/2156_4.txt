    <p>Narcissa hears a knock and heads to the door, when she opens it she finds two aurors standing there.</p>
<p>“How may I help you?” She asks politely</p>
<p>The female officer speaks up “ Well a couple was killed and they left behind a child.”</p>
<p>“What does that have to do with me or my family?” </p>
<p>The two aurors look at each other for a minute before the male one talks. “Ma’am how about you get your husband and we can all have this chat together.”</p>
<p>Narcissa wants to object but she is also curious so she calls for a house elf to retrieve Lucius as she leads the aurors to the sitting room. Lucius walks into the room with his mask of pure indifference on and takes a sit next to Narcissa.</p>
<p>“What brings you here?” He asks.</p>
<p>“Well sir a couple has recently passed away and they have left a daughter behind.” The female auror states.</p>
<p>“Ok, but last time I checked I am not anyone’s godfather nor do I run a foster home so what does this have to do with me?” Lucius demands.</p>
<p>“The couple was the Lovegoods.” </p>
<p>Lucius takes in a sharp breath causing Narcissa to look questioningly at him but he doesn’t meet her eyes.</p>
<p>“You are still not telling us what this has to do with us.” Narcissa says.</p>
<p>“We have reason to believe that the child was not Pandora’s husbands. We believe that it is your husbands.” The auror tells her.</p>
<p>Narcissa freezes for a moment and Lucius attempts to grab her hand but she snatches it away.<br/>
“If you will excuse me.” Narcissa tells them standing up walking to the kitchen.</p>
<p>After about five minutes Lucius walks in and Narcissa looks at him and sees the guilt in his eyes.<br/>
“It’s true.” she whispers.<br/>
Lucius walks closer and grabs her hand. “Cissa I am so sorry.”</p>
<p>She looks at him for a moment then responds “ How many times?”<br/>
“You don’t want to know that.”</p>
<p>“No! I do. How many times did you fuck her? And don’t you dare tell me it was only once.” Narcissa shouts.</p>
<p>“I was with her for 3 months.” Lucius says quietly.<br/>
Narcissa pulls her hand from his smacking his so quickly he doesn’t even notice until he feels a stinging sensation.</p>
<p>“Narcissa. Please I am so sorry I never meant for this to happen.” Lucius pleads.<br/>
“Well it did and now you have to face your consequences..” Narcissa says walking out of the kitchen.</p>
<p>That next morning Narcissa woke up and for a moment forgot that her husband was a cheating bastard. She gets dressed and heads down for breakfast. When she enters the dining room she sees Lucius and Draco already seated.</p>
<p>“Hello Draco.” She greets kissing him on the head.<br/>
“Hi mum.” Draco responds.<br/>
“Cissa.” Lucius says but she ignores him. </p>
<p>“Do you have any plans for the day Draco?” Narcissa asks.<br/>
“I was going to invite Theo over.” He says<br/>
“Thats sounds nice.”<br/>
“Narcissa we have to talk.” Lucius says looking over at her.</p>
<p>Narcissa meets his eyes and smiles “About what darling, how you don’t understand how to use protection spells or a fucking condom and now I have to put up with it or be seen as a disgrace.”</p>
<p>Lucius is quiet for a moment “Well yes that but we also have to inform others.” he says tilting his head in Draco’s direction, who is looking at his parents in confusion.</p>
<p>“Ok fine let’s do it now.” Narcissa says and without waiting for Lucius’s response turns to their 9 year old son.</p>
<p>“So your father fucked some knockturn ally whore  and made a baby and now since that lady died her child is coming to live with us.Yay” she exclaims.</p>
<p>Before can the little boy can question anything Lucius interjects telling Draco to play or something.<br/>
“Did you have to say it like that to him.” Lucius complains.</p>
<p>“You should count yourself lucky that I wasn’t more colorful.” she retorts<br/>
“Look I know I made a mistake but it was years ago.”Lucius says.</p>
<p>“Which means years that you could have groveled at my feet begging for forgiveness but instead I had to find out what you did from a fucking auror.” Narcissa hissess out at him.</p>
<p>Before Lucius could say anything Blinky popped into the room and announced that they had visitors.<br/>
“Well let’s go and greet your love child.” Narcissa stands and walks out of the dining room into the sitting room.</p>
<p>“Hello Aurors James and Kate.” She greets.<br/>
“Hello Lady Malfoy how are you?” Auror James says.<br/>
“Oh I’m utterly delightful. Now where is the child?”</p>
<p>“She is right here.” Kate says stepping to the side.<br/>
Instantly Narcissa is meet with a tiny blonde little girl with soft grey eyes. Tears start to rush to her eyes but she holds them back.</p>
<p>“How old is she?” She asks quietly.<br/>
Both aurors look at each other but the little girl answers “I’m 8.”<br/>
Narcissa is shaking now “What’s your name?”<br/>
“Luna.” The little girl answers.</p>
<p>Narcissa’s damn shatters and tears stand streaming down her face as she runs out of the room. She reaches her bed room and heads to the closet. She grabs all of Lucius clothes starts the fireplace and throws them in. It helped for about a minute before her anger burned out and she was left with the sadness. She doesn’t know how long she sat on the floor before Lucius walked in.<br/>
“Cissa.” he says.</p>
<p>She looks up at him and just like that her anger is ignited again.<br/>
“How dare you?” Narcissa demands walking closer to him.<br/>
Lucius opens his mouth to speak but she cuts him off “How dare you do this to me? I loved you! I loved you so much and this is how you repay me.”<br/>
“Cissa I didn’t know it was a girl and didn’t know her name.”</p>
<p>“You think that excuses this. I put my body through hell to give you an heir but that clearly wasn’t enough for you so I got pregnant again knowing that it could kill me but I just wanted to make you happy so I didn’t care. When I lost that baby it broke me. But where were you, off fucking some whore while I was here dying inside because I lost my baby, my little girl, my moon. Instead of being here grieving with me you went out and fucked someone, someone who got pregnant and had what should have been mine.” Narcissa shouts tears running down her face</p>
<p>“You weren’t the only one hurting! I was so happy when I found out that we were having a little girl but then we lost her and you left me alone. I had to deal with my pain alone because you couldn’t even get out of the fucking bed most mornings. So yes I went out into the world but only because I wanted to feel heard and understood. Pandora ended up being that person.When she ended up pregnant I immediately called it off with her. It’s not like I loved her” Lucius argues tears now running down his face too.</p>
<p>“You say you didn’t love her but you told her your dream.” Narcissa says with a sad smile.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?” </p>
<p>“When I first got pregnant with Draco you told me of your dream for your children to be apart of the sky. You say you didn’t love her but you told her your dream.” And with those words Narcissa walks out of the room.</p>
