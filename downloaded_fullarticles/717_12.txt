    <p>Henry laid his head down on his desk, in the dorm room he shared with Theo, and sighed.</p><p>"Tell me again," he said quietly.</p><p>"Miss Weasley was opening the Chamber all year," Theo explained. "She was being controlled by a dark, magickal object. Apparently, one owned by the Dark Lord. Now, we will have to face the consequences of his rising. She died, giving her life-essence to the memory of the Dark Lord, which means he is once again amongst the living. He may even have to be educated here -- his memory self is only sixteen."</p><p>"This is a nightmare," Henry replied. "A true, and horrible nightmare."</p><p>"Hogwarts will likely close," Millicent whispered.</p><p>Theo nodded.</p><p>"Could you not fix it?" Draco asked in a near-whisper.</p><p>Henry whipped around to stare, open-mouthed, at Draco. "Are you saying you don't want Lord WhatsIt to be back in power? Didn't your father serve him?"</p><p>Draco blinked slowly for a few moments. "My mother is terrified of what it may mean, what might happen, now that the Dark Lord is back. If I can, I wish to spare her the terror."</p><p>Henry nodded. "And...all of you..." He looked around the room. Neville and Hermione sat on Theo's bed, Draco stood leaning against one wall, Blaise and Millicent sat on Henry's bed and Vincent and Greg stood near the door, with it slightly cracked, keeping watch. "You all want me to fix it?" he asked.</p><p>A consensus went around the room. </p><p>"Either that, or ask Professor Sinistra if she can," Hermione said.</p><p>"Whatever you do, Henry, someone needs to go back and make sure he doesn't rise out of that object," Neville said. </p><p>Henry took a deep breath and stood. "I won't ask Professor Sinistra to help. She made it clear that interfering with history would be dangerous. I'll do it alone, but you need to understand...it might have repercussions."</p><p>"I can come with you. You might need help saving her," Theo responded.</p><p>"I could prove valuable," Hermione added.</p><p>"Or maybe...Luna could go with you. I know she's only a first year, but...she knows things," said Neville.</p><p>Henry shook his head. "I'll go alone. I'll fix it."</p><p>He grabbed the utility belt he'd put together earlier in the year -- during the summer holidays -- and snapped it on. It contained, among other things, his Invisibility Cloak, the Resurrection Stone, two Bezoars, a small supply of healing potions, and a tiny bottle of fairy dust (given as a gift to him at Litha). </p><p>Henry slipped on both wand-holsters, checked that his wands were inside them, and then shrugged into his black student-cloak. "You won't remember what had happened, when I get back, if I'm successful. You're not supposed to, so don't try," he cautioned.</p><p>He took one last look around the room and then left. </p><p>***</p><p>Henry made his way very carefully to Myrtle's bathroom. He was aware that the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets was there -- as he'd been aware of it all year. If he'd known that little Ginevra Weasley had been the one opening it, and what she'd been doing throughout the year, he would have told someone his suspicions and what he knew. As it stood, he hadn't had any idea what was going on with her. True, people were being petrified, but...Henry hadn't known that the chambers he'd seen in passing were the Chamber of Secrets.</p><p>He knew the Chamber was there because of his Ghost-Walks -- walking in the Underworld. Hogwart's held no secrets when it was seen through the lense of the Underworld.</p><p>Right before entering the bathroom, Henry slipped into the Underworld. It was easy now -- he'd been doing it all year and all summer.</p><p>Standing in the gray and pearly light of the Underworld, Henry walked through the closed door. He'd learned, over a short time really, how to interact with the Underworld. He wasn't corporeal here unless he needed or wanted to be.</p><p>"I probably should have gotten Professor Snape or Sinistra," he muttered to himself as he debated how far back to pull time.</p><p>"Oh!" Myrtle said as she zoomed towards him. "You are here. Are you dead?"</p><p>Henry laughed. "Of course I'm not dead, Myrtle," he replied. "I'm here to...well, to do a really foolish Gryffindor type thing, really."</p><p>"To save the pretty young girl?" Myrtle asked.</p><p>Henry nodded.</p><p>"Oooooh! Should I tell?" Myrtle asked in her sing-song voice.</p><p>"Please, no. Please. I'd really rather just get this done -- and no one, save perhaps Professor Sinistra, will be the wiser," Henry responded.</p><p>"Oh alright. Takes the fun out of it though, Henry!" Myrtle cried. She zoomed around him once more and then flew back to her cubicle.</p><p>Henry stood near the entrance to the Chamber and tried to figure out how far back he should go. Whatever monster was inside was dangerous, and he wasn't confident he could defeat it -- or even that he should. But, he had to save Ginevra Weasley no matter what. Lord Voldemort could not be allowed to rise again.</p><p>He stepped back and reached out with his hands and his magick. As he pulled the threads of time towards his body, images played across the room until light, sound and colour flooded in from past events. Both the images and the magick swirled around him as he focused on seeing only what he wanted to see -- what he wanted to change.</p><p>Henry was careful with how much and how fast he pulled the threads and ripples of time. If he pulled too far, and over-shot his goal, something even worse could happen during his second year at Hogwarts than what had befallen them all.</p><p>Finally, he saw what he needed to see. Ginevra Weasley, eyes glassy, head held high, movements stiff and robotic, moved towards the entrance to the chamber and began to open it. Henry knew it was the final time she'd done so because of what she was wearing, the fact that her fingers on her left hand were covered with blood, and she clutched a black diary in her other hand.</p><p>He knew it was the object to look out for because he'd seen it before -- it had been thrown at Myrtle while he'd been exploring her bathroom in the Underworld, by Ginevra Weasley. At the time, he'd thought it was odd and a bit of a tantrum, but now he knew it was no coincidence that he'd seen it.</p><p>Henry let go of the strands of time and let them snap into place around Ginevra. Still in the Underworld, he emerged into the past. The fact that he was able to feel Ginevra in the room, while he was in the Underworld, was not a good sign.</p><p>"Partially dead already then, in some way," Henry murmured to himself. He looked through his Ghost Seeker's eyes at her -- using Ghost Sight. She looked pale and wan. A thin, black light connected from her heart to the diary. "It's got her magick, that's why," he concluded.</p><p>Knowing that she was connected to death helped him, actually. Still in the Underworld, he reached out with his magick and pushed the diary out of her hand and dragged it away.</p><p>Ginevra spun around, the glassy-look in her eyes faded somewhat. "Who is it? Who's there?" she called out.</p><p>Henry kept ahold of the diary in one hand, and slipped the rest of his body, keeping his hand and arm in the Underworld, out and into reality.</p><p>"Hello, Miss Weasley," he said politely. "It's just me -- Henry?"</p><p>Her eyes cleared. "Oh. Henry. Henry....Peverell?" she asked.</p><p>"Interesting, he lets you go when someone else is around?" Henry asked conversationally.</p><p>"I'm not sure what you mean," Ginevra replied.</p><p>"I'm sure you do. You're being possessed, you know," Henry replied casually.</p><p>When she struck, with her weak magick, Henry slipped back into the Underworld without a scratch. He waited her out. She scanned the room for him, and then began to look frantically for the diary.</p><p>"Where is it!? Where is it!?" she screamed.</p><p>Henry sighed. At this moment he wished he'd taken Theo up on his offer. He needed help -- someone to take the diary to Headmaster Dumbledore, and someone to take Ginevra to the Hospital wing, while he figured out how to destroy whatever monster lay within the chamber, and how to shut the entrance to the chamber down.</p><p>He could feel a dull, throbbing pull from the diary, but he refused to give into it. He was stronger than that, and he knew what it could do. If he left Ginevra here, she might go down into the Chamber anyway and awake the monster. Petrify someone else. Henry shook his head and slipped partially back into reality.</p><p>Henry raised his wand and stupefied Ginevra Weasley with a small, but powerful, bit of nonverbal magick.</p><p>As she fell to the floor, he slipped completely back into reality. He levied her up with the floating spell, and bound her with the Incarcerous spell. He grabbed onto one of the ropes and then slid them both into the Underworld for faster travel.</p><p>Instead of dropping Ginevra off at the Infirmary, Henry headed straight to the dungeons -- to Professor Snape. While he knew that the Headmaster would need to be made aware, Henry trusted Professor Snape far more than he trusted Headmaster Dumbledore.</p><p>Henry moved, with Ginevra and the diary, back into reality.</p><p>He used the Slytherin-Emergency knock on Professor Snape's office door and stood back.</p><p>"What can I do for you at this -- dear Merlin, Mr. Peverell, whatever are you doing with Miss Weasley?" Professor Snape barked as he stepped into the hallway.</p><p>"Not in the hallway, please, sir," came Henry's reply.</p><p>"Certainly," Professor Snape replied as he stepped back to allow Henry to enter with Miss Weasley.</p><p>Professor Snape closed the door sharply behind them. "Explain!" he said.</p><p>"Miss Weasley has been opening the Chamber of Secrets all year, through the means of this diary. She's being possessed. She is aware of it, but doesn't know how to break it. I used some of my Ghost Seeker abilities to save her. I know where the Chamber is, and I fear I also know how to open it. I do not know what variety of monster lies within, but it will need to be killed, sir," Henry said in a rush.</p><p>"What proof have you?" Professor Snape asked.</p><p>"Just the diary, sir," Henry replied as he thrust it forward into Professor Snape's hands.</p><p>Professor Snape flinched and immediately threw the diary onto his desk. He eyed it wearily as he rubbed a hand over his clothed-forearm. "That is most certainly dark magick, Mr. Peverell."</p><p>Henry nodded. "It belongs to Tom Riddle, otherwise known as the Dark Lord, sir."</p><p>It was Professor Snape's turn to nod. "Yes. Well. Yes."</p><p>"May I go now? I'm confident you'll find a way to destroy it and that you'll get Miss Weasley to the hospital," Henry said.</p><p>"I want you to recount your nighttime adventure to Professor Sinistra, and come up with a way of explaining it to the Headmaster, Mr. Peverell. Remember, he cannot know about your abilities. Does Miss Weasley know about them?" Professor Snape replied.</p><p>"No, I didn't share them with her, or show them. She was very distracted by being possessed, as well, sir," Henry said.</p><p>"Very good. You will help me by getting Miss Weasley to the hospital wing. I will take the diary to the Headmaster and inform him about the Chamber. I do believe I know what sort of monster lies within it and I am sure the Headmaster will have some ideas of how to defeat it, if we can get in," Professor Snape said.</p><p>"Alright. Thank you, sir," Henry replied.</p><p>"Good, go now," Professor Snape said.</p><p>Henry grabbed hold of Miss Weasley and slipped back into the Underworld to take her to the Hospital wing. Once there, he shifted back into the real world, tied her to the bed, and pinned a note on her that said: magickal depletion, possession, overall health issues, please help.</p><p>Problem solved, Henry returned to his dorm. He hoped he'd done the right thing and that when he woke in the morning, the school would be safe and Lord Voldemort would still be dead.</p><p> </p><p>**************************************</p><p> </p><p>TBC</p>
