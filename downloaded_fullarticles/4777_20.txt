    <p>“It’s just, he’s so fucking <em> thick, </em> you know? It’s maddening,” Draco drawled. “He can’t even get a simple fucking potion right, everyone thinks the Golden Boy is <em> so fucking brilliant </em> but he <em> isn’t </em> he’s just <em> thick </em>.”</p><p>“Oh for fucks sake Draco,” Pansy finally exclaimed, looking up from her charms homework. “Insult potter, call him an idiot, but for the love of god <em>please</em> <em>stop calling him thick.”</em></p><p>“What?” Draco asked. “Why? What’s wrong with calling him thick?”</p><p>“It’s a muggle term now, Draco, and it means something else. Just, pick a new insult,” she said, looking back at her charms homework and chewing on her quill, accidentally getting ink on her mouth in the process.</p><p>“How would you even know muggle terms? And what does it mean?” Draco asked, curious.</p><p>“Marie told me about it,” Pansy said after pulling the quill from her mouth. She saw the ink and realized her mistake, but cleared it from her mouth with a quiet <em> scourgify </em>.</p><p>“That hufflepuff girl?” Draco questioned. “What were you doing with her?”</p><p>“<em>What do you think?” </em> Pansy asked pointedly and <em> oh. Right. Sex. </em> “Anyways, the term thick is used to describe someone with a very nice body, particularly a very nice arse. And you’ve been calling Potter <em> thick </em> for weeks and I can’t fucking take it anymore.”</p><p>Draco was silent for a minute, and his cheeks may have flushed a little. “Pansy, clearly I wasn’t meaning it in <em> that </em>sense. I mean, I can’t stand the bloke-” Pansy rolled her eyes, but Draco continued. “Plus, I mean, Potter’s arse probably isn’t even that-”</p><p>“What’s that about my arse, Malfoy?”</p><p>Draco froze, and Pansy watched his face completely drain of color, and then turn a bright, light pink. Potter had just walked into the common room with the Granger girl, and caught the end of Draco’s rant. He had a light smirk on his face, and stood about a meter away from them, waiting for Draco to explain.</p><p>“I, er-” Draco racked his brain for something eloquent or witty to respond, but couldn’t think of a single fucking thing to say.</p><p>“Pansy,” said Hermione carefully from beside Harry. “Is that the charms homework? Do you maybe want to go work on it together in the library?”</p><p>Pansy, feeling a bit relieved and a bit saddened to get out of her current predicament, closed her book and stood up. “Sure, Hermione.” They walked back out of the common room, leaving Harry still standing a little ways apart from Draco, who was still sitting on the couch completely frozen.</p><p>Harry’s smirk widened to a grin as he took Pansy’s previous spot on the couch, opening up one of his text books. “Take your time Malfoy, I’m not in any rush.”</p><p>“I was insulting you, Potter,” Draco replied after a few minutes, fighting to keep his voice steady.</p><p>“Insulting my arse? That’s low, even for you Malfoy. I happen to have a very nice arse-” Harry was cut off by Malfoy’s groan of exasperation, and Harry had a hard time keeping himself from laughing.</p><p>“I was talking about how you fucked up the potion with Slughorn today, and I called you thick,” Draco finally blurted out. “And Pansy informed me of what that means in muggle terminology.”</p><p>Harry, knowing full and well what the term thick meant in muggle terminology, decided to play dumb because <em> this was so fucking fun to watch him squirm. </em>“Oh? And what does that mean?”</p><p>Draco sighed and looked determinedly down at the book in front of him, the tips of his ears turning pink. “It means that you,” he backtracks. “It means that <em> someone </em>has a really nice arse.”</p><p>Harry could feel his stomach genuinely <em> cramping </em> from holding in his laughter. “Is that so? Well then I have to admit, the term is fairly accurate, when applied to <em> me. </em>”</p><p>“You absolute fucker I wasn’t-” Draco took another deep breath. “I was trying to explain to Pansy I didn’t mean it <em> like that </em> when you walked in.”</p><p>“Sure, yeah, of course,” Harry agreed, in a voice that made it <em> very </em> clear that he was not actually agreeing. “Here’s the issue though Malfoy: <em> you couldn’t possibly be disagreeing, because my arse is phenomenal. </em>”</p><p>“It is <em> not</em>,” Draco declared, not taking his eyes off of his book.</p><p>“How would you know?” Harry questioned.</p><p>Malfoy froze. How would he know? He could either say he had never checked out Potter’s arse and admit that it might be phenomenal, or stand by the fact that it isn’t that great, <em> thereby admitting the fact that he has, indeed, checked out Potter’s arse. </em></p><p>“Fuck off, Potter.”</p><p>“Oh my god, you’re admitting it, <em> you totally have checked out my arse, </em> ” Harry finally burst out laughing, his eyes filling with tears he was laughing so hard. Draco’s face turned impossibly more pink as he started rambling about how that was <em> entirely unfounded, Potter </em> and <em> there was absolutely no fucking way that I’ve checked out your arse. </em></p><p>Once Harry calmed down enough to be able to talk, he gathered his books and stood up. “Malfoy, you know I’m just messing with you right?” he asked with a grin. “Anyways, I’m heading up to bed. I’ll see you tomorrow.” Draco just kind of nodded, too in shock to do anything else. Harry walked to the stairs that lead up to the dormitories, but paused before going up.</p><p>“Oh, and Malfoy?”</p><p>Draco looked up from his book for a final time, eyes meeting Harry’s. “Yes?”</p><p>“You have a fairly nice arse as well,” Harry said with a cheeky grin, before bounding up the stairs.</p><p>Draco stared at the empty space Harry had once occupied for a really long time, unable to move. His brain felt like it was malfunctioning, maybe it was, because Harry fucking Potter hadn’t <em> really </em>just said that had he?</p><p>Potter thought that he, Draco Malfoy had a nice arse.</p><p>Potter had just admitted that he thought that he, Draco Malfoy, had a nice arse, and in the process <em> admitted to checking out the previously mentioned arse. </em></p><p>Draco felt light headed.</p><p>When Hermione and Pansy returned an hour or so later Draco seemed like he had returned to his reading, but once glance showed Pansy that he hadn’t turned a page since she left him.</p><p>Draco hadn’t moved at all, but in his head he was far, far away.</p>
