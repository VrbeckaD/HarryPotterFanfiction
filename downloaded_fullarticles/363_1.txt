    <p>"That's it, little one," mum (Persephone) cooed. "My little Wren O' Rourke. Such a beautiful girl."</p>
<p>Dad (Cormac) chuckled, "Ay, she is. A heartbreaker, this one."</p>
<p>"Can I see?" Jacob questioned, excited to meet his little sister. "I want to see."</p>
<p>Cormac lifted Jacob onto the hospital bed so he could see Wren. A newborn baby girl, barely a few hours old, his sister. He gasped in awe at how tiny and adorable she was.</p>
<p>Wren yawned and wiggled at the attention. Her little fist swiped against her tiny nose and she sneezed. The little tuff of hair that Wren had changed colors from Chestnut brown to sunset orange.</p>
<p>"Did you guys see that?" Jacob asked, looking at his parents. "Her hair changed colors."</p>
<p>Persephone giggled, "Blimey, she's a special little girl."</p>
<p>Cormac grinned, "Our special little girl. Jacob, you have to protect her."</p>
<p>"I will, I promise," Jacob beamed.</p>
<p>"Kore, she's a beaut," Cormac sighed happily. "She already got me wrapped around her wee fingers."</p>
<p>Persephone whispered to the baby, "That's my girl, Wren."</p>
