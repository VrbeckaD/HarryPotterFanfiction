    <p>Rey tapped her wand against the light wood and watched blue sparks fly from the tip. The hovering broom in front of her shot forward and smashed into a bookcase. Books tumbled to the floor – except for the one with a penchant for hovering – and buried half the broom handle.</p><p>"I didn't think Quidditch involved running into bookcases," a drawling voice said behind Rey.</p><p>She turned to face a tall seventh year with short blonde hair. Her perfectly tailored robes were immaculate as usual, revealing the deep blue of their house. "Oh, come on, Phasma. No one will expect a Cleansweep to be able to go that fast. I just have to figure out how to ride it at that speed." A blonde eyebrow rose slowly, and Rey crossed her arms, self-consciously feeling her too-big robe slide down her right shoulder. "Just because you got suspended from the team for that stupid polyjuice stunt with Hux doesn't mean you shouldn't want Ravenclaw to win the cup."</p><p>Phasma's blue eyes rolled, and she pushed past Rey. "I don't know what you're talking about. Kanata just thought I could use a break from Quidditch."</p><p>Rey watched Phasma disappear into the girl's dormitory before she walked to the pile of books. With a wave of her wand, the books stacked up on the shelves. Rey glared up at the book that had begun to flap around the Ravenclaw statue. "Get down here."</p><p>A bookmark fluttered down and covered her eyes. Rey pushed it off and scowled. "Real mature for a book."</p><p>The book flew higher and rested on Ravenclaw's head. Rey huffed and picked up the broom, rubbing the sleeve of her robe over a scratch on the handle. She tapped the wand against the bristles and watched them straighten. Just because her robes didn't fit properly didn't mean she couldn't keep her broom in top condition.</p><p>The clock chimed once, and Rey jumped. She jogged back to the sprawl of her things and waved her wand. The broomstick polishing supplies piled into a box, and she nearly forgot to latch it as she snatched it, ran past the statue, and raced up the stairs to her dormitory. Depositing her broom and cleaning equipment on her bed, she grabbed her patched bag and nearly fell down the spiral staircase when she tripped on her robes in her hurry.</p><p>She was rummaging through her bag for an elusive book as she reached the entrance hall ran into a short woman. "Oh, sorry, professor!"</p><p>Professor Organa smiled up at her. "It's fine, Miss Smith. Loose something?"</p><p>"I think I left a book in my common room, but I don't have time to get it." The waving figure of Finn caught her eye at the end of the staircase. "I… I need to get to potions."</p><p>Organa gave short laugh. "The Ravenclaw riddles are a challenge when you're in a hurry. I was just glad Slytherin only had a password on days like that." She followed Rey's gaze to Finn. "I should let you get to class. See you in Charms tomorrow."</p><p>"Yeah, see you, professor," Rey said distractedly as she descended the stairs.</p><p>Finn fell in step with her, and she continued her rummage. "Hey. You're late. Something happen?"</p><p>"Just a run-in with Phasma." Rey sighed and zipped her bag. "Can we share your book? I think I left mine by my bed."</p><p>Finn nodded and held up the book clutched under his arm. "Sure. What'd Phasma say?"</p><p>"Just criticizing my broom and denying her involvement in that polyjuice potion thing. I still don't know how she's a Ravenclaw when she gets on better with all the Slytherins."</p><p>Finn rolled his eyes. "Right? I mean, I'm not a fan of really any of the Slytherins, but what they did to Solo was awful."</p><p>Rey nodded and pressed her lips together. "Those two would be better off having switched houses."</p><p>They fell into a friendly silence as they entered the dungeons, but Rey paused as she caught sight of a tall, dark haired seventh year slouching toward the stairs. "Hey, Ben."</p><p>Ben looked up from his shoes and blinked at Rey as if surprised someone would talk to him. "Uh, hi. Rey."</p><p>"Ready for the Quidditch match next week?" Rey flashed a bright smile, noticing the green sticking to Ben's shoes. He smelled like grass and broomstick wood; Slytherin must have had a practice that morning.</p><p>Ben shifted the bag across his shoulder, his pale skin taking a light red tone. "I guess so."</p><p>"Well, ah, try not to hit too many bludgers my way?" Rey's hand twitched as she nearly went to give Ben's arm a friendly hit. Finn gave an impatient groan next to her.</p><p>The red deepened on Ben's face. "Uh. Well, our strategy is to target your Keeper." His brown eyes widened. "Annd I really shouldn't've said that. Uh. Bye. Uh, Rey."</p><p>Rey watched Ben hurry up the stairs with a pang of guilt in her chest. She had last seen that red face in the entrance hall with rumpled hair, yelling at his apparent double that had begun to shrink and grow red hair. "Bye, Ben."</p><p>Finn whistled next to her. "Wow. I didn't believe Poe."</p><p>Rey gave Finn a look as they entered the potions classroom. "What do you mean?"</p><p>Finn set his potions book on the bench between them and unpacked his ingredients from his bag. "Ben Solo's got a thing for you."</p><p>Rey nearly choked on her own saliva. "Ben – what?"</p><p>Finn's lips spread in a knowing grin, and he took a seat as a weathered voice spoke over the general chatter in the room. "All right, all right. Today, you will be brewing me a batch of amortentia." Rey pulled out a quill and parchment and looked up at Professor Snoke. A wrinkled old man, Snoke did not appear entirely human. Rumors were that he had tried to circumvent the long process of becoming an Animagus with a potion. "I assume you've done the reading. Can anyone tell me what amortentia is?"</p><p>Finn's hand rose timidly. Snoke looked over the room with a bored expression. When no other hands went up, he sighed. "Yes?"</p><p>Finn cleared his throat nervously. "It's the most powerful love potion in the world, sir."</p><p>Snoke scoffed. "An incomplete description. Five points from Hufflepuff. Amortentia causes powerful infatuation but does not cause love. A notable feature is that it smells differently to everyone according to what they're attracted to." He paused and crossed thin arms. "You have an hour and a half to produce it. Perhaps you can make a better attempt than the Gryffindors yesterday."</p><p>He swept around the desk and sat down, watching the assembled Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs with an unblinking gaze. Rey frowned and flipped open Finn's book to the amortentia page. "Even the book calls it a love potion."</p><p>Finn shrugged and tapped his wand underneath his cauldron to start a fire. "Shouldn't've tried."</p><p>Over an hour later, Rey wiped sweat from her forehead and pulled off her loose outer robes, draping them over her bag. "Merlin's stars, it's hot in here."</p><p>Finn leaned against the bench and glanced at the book between them. "Says the ten-minute wait makes the potion hot enough to allow the unicorn hairs to do their job."</p><p>Rey nodded and pulled out the hairs to put in after their wait. "You're coming to the match next week, right?"</p><p>"Of course. Poe said he's gotta take notes on your playing." Finn popped an Every Flavor Bean in his mouth. "The Ravenclaw Chasers are the best in the school, and he's going up against you next month."</p><p>Rey hit Finn's arm lightly and shot a quick glance to Snoke, who was watching the Ravenclaws sitting in the front row. "Don't let Snoke catch you eating in here." She smiled as her friend's words sunk in. "And thanks. We've been practicing a lot."</p><p>"You need to get past Slytherin first before you face Poe and the rest of Gryffindor, though." Finn shrugged and checked the fire under his cauldron. "But it might not be as much of a beating as they gave us, considering Solo will just keep watching you."</p><p>Rey groaned and shook her head, tapping her wand impatiently against her leg. "Look, we barely know each other. The only thing we have in common is Quidditch, and we don't even play the same position."</p><p>"Smith, ten points from Ravenclaw for being out of uniform."</p><p>Rey's fist clenched, and she wrenched back on her robe. Snoke loved taking points from everyone. The Ravenclaws had potions with the Slytherins the previous year, and it had been apparent that Snoke was bitter about Professor Organa being appointed Slytherin Head of House over him by how many points he took from her son, Ben.</p><p>Finn began sprinkling the unicorn hairs into his potion. "He still likes you. And you did defend him during that whole fiasco. You figured out that Phasma knocked him out and made him miss his Charms exam."</p><p>"Because she made it obvious."</p><p>"No, they would've gotten away with it had you not done your little investigation." Finn stirred the potion with his wand.</p><p>Rey grabbed his wrist and shook her head. "Book says counterclockwise." She let go and watched her own potion turn amortentia's signature pearl sheen. "So I helped expose Phasma and that jerk Hux. At least Ben didn't get the blame for vandalizing the trophy room."</p><p>Finn raised his eyebrows suggestively. "I mean, Poe didn't save me from massive punishment, but he still showed an interest before we started dating."</p><p>Rey rolled her eyes and set her wand down as Snoke called out, "Time's up. Bottle your potion and bring it up here for grading."</p><p>Spiraling steam rise from the pearly surface of her potion, and Rey dipped a vial into it to collect a sample. Finn took a long whiff of his potion. "Ah. Smells like Poe's shampoo." He grinned and glanced at Rey. "What does it smell like to you?"</p><p>"Grass, broomstick wood, and…" Finn started laughing as he brought his vial up to Snoke's desk. Rey followed him with a groan. "Bloody hell."</p>
