          <div class="userstuff"><p>Fred and George are trying to help Draco forge a bunch of letters to prove he and harry potter were friends.</p><p>Fred:<br/>
Dear Draco malfoy<br/>
We've been way too out of touch<br/>
Things have been crazy</p><p>George:<br/>
And it sucks that we don't talk that much<br/>
But I should tell you that I think of you each night</p><p>Fred:<br/>
I rub my nipples and start moaning with delight</p><p>(Draco grabs the letter away from Fred and George)</p><p>Draco:<br/>
Why would you write that?!</p><p>Fred and George: (trying not to laugh but failing)<br/>
We're just trying to tell the truth</p><p>Draco: <br/>
This needs to be perfect these letters have to prove that we were actually friends</p><p>(Draco is getting visbliy frustrated )</p><p>Just I'll do it</p><p>I've gotta tell you, life without you has been hard</p><p>George: Hard?</p><p>Draco: Has been bad</p><p>Fred: Bad?</p><p>Draco: Has been rough</p><p>George: Kinky!</p><p>Draco: And I miss talking about life and other stuff</p><p>Fred: Very specific</p><p>Draco: Shut up!</p><p>Draco: I like my parents</p><p>George: Who says that?</p><p>Draco: I love my parents but each day's another fight</p><p>If I stop smoking drugs<br/>
Then everything might be alright</p><p>Fred: Smoking drugs?</p><p>Draco: Just fix it! (Draco shoves the paper into George's chest)</p><p>George: If I stop smoking crack </p><p>Draco: Crack?! (Grabs the paper back from George)</p><p>Draco: If I stop smoking pot<br/>
Then everything might be alright<br/>
I'll take your advice<br/>
I'll try to be nicer<br/>
I'll turn it around<br/>
Wait and see </p><p>Fred: Cause all that it takes is a little reinvention</p><p>George:  It’s easy to change if you give it your attention</p><p>Draco: All you gotta do is just believe you can be who you want to be<br/>
Sincerely, Me</p><p>Fred and George: Are we done yet?</p><p>Draco: Well I can't just give them one email I want to show that I was, like, a good friend, you know?</p><p>Fred and George: Oh my god</p><p>Draco:<br/>
Dear Harry Potter, Yes, I also miss our talks<br/>
Stop doing drugs Just try to take deep breaths and go on walks</p><p>Fred: no</p><p>Draco: I'm sending pictures of the most amazing trees</p><p>George: No</p><p>Draco: You'll be obsessed with all my forest expertise </p><p>Fred and george: Absolutely not</p><p>Dude, I'm proud of you<br/>

Your average kind of bond</p><p>Fred: But not because we're gay</p><p>George: No, not because we're gay</p><p>Draco: We're close, but not that way<br/>
The only man that I love is my dad<br/>
