    <p>Theo Nott has been in love with Harry Potter since their fifth year at Hogwarts.</p><p>Before that, he’d just been obsessed with the idea of The Boy Who Lived To Fuck Up Theo’s Life. Maybe he shouldn’t have been so fascinated by the boy who vanquished The Dark Lord, sending loyal Death Eater Nott Sr. to prison for a brief stint. When his father came back, he was a different man. Harder, crueler, more prone to drunken rages that would usually end with Theo dragging himself off to some hidden corner so one of the house elves could heal him enough to sleep.</p><p>Sometimes he wondered if things might have been different if his mother hadn’t died from a sudden illness while his father served his time in Azkaban. But they hadn’t exactly been a happy little family before his father lost his last shred of humanity and decided to join the Death Eaters, so probably not.</p><p>It was a relief when his Hogwarts letter came. Sitting on the Express with the children of his father’s friends, Theo felt like he could breathe for the first time in four years. It was easy to fade into the background, letting Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson position themselves into the power leaders of the group. Let them have their dramatics and schoolyard politics. He just wanted some peace and quiet. The library at Hogwarts was supposed to be one of the best in all of Britain and he couldn’t wait to dive in; reading had been his only escape in recent years. It would be enough if he could spend his hours in the dusty silence between shelves, getting good enough marks not to bring down his father’s anger, and hover without notice at the edges of the Knott Sr. pre-approved circle of pureblood children.</p><p>But when Potter and his friends came to their train compartment looking for Neville Longbottom’s toad, Theo found it nearly impossible to keep his head down and nose in his book.</p><p>While the curly-haired Muggleborn girl argued with Draco, Theo took in the Chosen One’s appearance. Slight and dark-skinned, with messy brown hair and eyes a startling green behind round glasses that kept sliding down his nose, the boy snarled at Draco in defense of his friends, his skinny arms crossed over his chest. Unlike Theo’s neat trousers, collared shirt, and leather shoes, Potter wore his baggy Muggle clothes like he didn’t care what anyone thought about him. It was an attitude Theo admired, but didn’t understand. He was constantly on guard, wary to never step out of line in fear of a report on any bad behavior making it back to his father.</p><p>Theo never spoke without thinking, never moved without deliberation, never reacted without examining the situation from every possible angle first.</p><p>So he kept his face blank, body still, wedged between Gregory Goyle and the window, when Potter swept the whole compartment with a look of scorn and spit out, “I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.” Theo could have taken offense at being included in that number, after all, he hadn’t been the one insulting the Chosen One’s friends. But, he reasoned, just sitting with Draco and Pansy was enough for Potter to assume he felt as they did, it made sense. Perhaps there was still time to salvage the way he saw Theo during their classes, still a way to make friends with the boy who had fascinated him so much while growing up.</p><p>But when Harry and Theo reached the Great Hall, they were Sorted into Gryffindor and Slytherin, respectively. When he saw the look of derision the dark-haired boy threw at Theo's House table, he knew Harry Potter would never accept any offer of friendship that Theo extended. So that was that, and he was consigned to watch the newly minted Gryffindor from afar, wondering what it felt like when Potter turned that brilliant smile on someone or laughed at one of their jokes.</p><p>It was all very innocent until Theo had a big gay sexual awakening when he turned fourteen and couldn't seem to manage a wank that didn't star Potter and his Quidditch calloused hands. He didn't fall in love until a year later, when Potter confronted Snape in front of a crowd of students and accused him of being a Death Eater traitor. He then helped McGonagall drive the professor from the school, his fury and determination blazing out of him in an impressive display of power. It was all very romantic at the time and Theo couldn't tear his eyes away. </p><p>He never acknowledged Theo, and why would he when Draco commanded so much of his attention whenever their two groups collided? Theo was just a silent ghost lingering behind the hulking forms of Greg and Vincent, no one even noticed when he didn’t laugh at Draco’s jeers and jabs. The blond boy had been one of his least favorite people, unfortunately, Theo couldn't afford to avoid him. He never shared the Malfoy heir’s opinions on the sanctity of blood purity, or his father’s for that matter, but he knew better than to voice his opposition. Better to keep his mouth shut and let others battle it out. Not very honorable or brave, but then he wasn’t placed in Gryffindor for a reason. Hermione Granger, Potter’s swotty best friend, threw him a few speculative glances over the years, but she was the only one of their crowd to pay him any heed. He was happy she wasn’t more curious, in truth, when she hauled off and punched Draco in the face in fourth year for yet again being a spectacular prat. It could only be to Theo’s benefit she didn’t think he was worth the effort of further notice. Granger was frighteningly observant when she wanted to be, and her sharp intelligence made her more than a little intimidating. He didn’t want to be the focus of one of her mental dissections, it went in direct opposition to his desire to slip through school in the background.</p><p>So it was more than a little alarming when The Golden Trio slid open the door to Theo, Draco, and Pansy’s Express compartment on their way to Hogwarts for the newly instated Eighth Year, for students who’d lost their seventh year to the war.</p><p>The three Slytherins’ heads snapped around to stare at Potter standing in the doorway, in another one of his overly large Muggle t-shirts that seemed in danger of sliding off one shoulder. Pansy’s face went white, Draco opened and closed his mouth without sound, and Theo tried to disappear into the cushions where he sat opposite the pair.</p><p>“Alright there, Malfoy?” Potter asked mildly as he entered the compartment and sat down next to Theo. The side of his beat-up trainer bumped against Theo’s foot, and he didn’t know what to do. He was already pressed up against the window, there was nowhere else to go. He settled for staring at the novel he’d been reading, now clenched between stiff fingers, watching out of the corner of his eye as Granger shoved a reluctant Ron Weasley into the compartment ahead of her. The ginger-haired boy, the final third of The Golden Trio, muttered darkly as he dropped onto the bench next to Potter while Granger seated herself next to a stunned Draco.</p><p>He pulled himself together admirably in record speed, turning the trademarked Malfoy sneer on her. “Wouldn’t you rather sit with your boyfriend, instead of threatening me with that wild bush you call hair, Granger?”</p><p>“Not my boyfriend,” she said, ignoring his insult to her hair. The redhead just shrugged when Draco arched one derisive eyebrow at him, not looking particularly broken up by his ex-girlfriend's announcement. Granger leaned around the blond, mouth twitching with amusement as he choked out a warning and batted at the curls that covered his face. “Hello, Parkinson. How was your summer?”</p><p>The other girl shot Potter a terrified glance, like she was still waiting for him to stand up and shout at her for trying to sell him out to the Dark Lord during the Battle of Hogwarts. Not that she’d been doing anything more than trying to save her friends and the young children in her House. None of them could have fought, not with most of them having family out there in Voldemort's army. Privately, Theo thought she was stupid for attempting to get the other students to give Potter up to save them from the Dark Lord’s wrath, but he did understand her reasoning. He himself had left without protest when the Slytherins were herded offsite, knowing he couldn't fight for Voldemort, and that his father would kill him without hesitation should they find themselves on opposite sides of the battlefield. </p><p>Potter just looked back at her with polite interest, however, so Pansy cleared her throat and answered that she’d had a quiet summer, thank you. Clearly satisfied that her part in fostering civility was done, Granger gave a nod and sat back, reaching into her bag to pull out a battered copy of Hogwarts, A History.</p><p>Weasley folded his arms across his chest and glowered at Draco. “I don’t really give a shit how your summer was.” He yelped as Granger kicked him hard in the shin, then amended his comment with a gruff, “You dodged Azkaban, anyway, so that’s… good. I guess.”</p><p>Theo tried not to notice when Potter’s body, warm where he was pressed up against Theo from shoulder to thigh, shook briefly as he turned a snort of laughter into a discreet cough. Draco just rolled his eyes and angled himself away from the others as much as possible to whisper with Pansy. The compartment settled into quiet then, only broken by Potter and Weasley’s muted discussion of the Harpies' chances in the upcoming World Cup. Theo returned to his book, although mostly he just stared at the same page, hyper-aware every time Potter shifted.</p><p>“What are you reading?”</p><p>He had been concentrating so hard on pushing the sensation from his mind that he jumped when Potter spoke, his breath caressing Theo’s right ear as he leaned over.</p><p>“Whoa,” the other boy said quietly, his hand touching Theo’s sleeve for a moment as if to steady him, before moving it away. “Sorry. I should have cleared my throat or something. Didn’t mean to startle you.”</p><p>Theo quickly composed himself, smoothing his face into a familiar mask of blankness, even though his heart still slammed in his chest from the unexpected attention. This was the closest he’d ever been to Potter, and it was worth noting that his famous green eyes were ringed with a brilliant circle of gold.</p><p>“It’s fine,” he said, lifting the book to flash the cover at Potter. “Just an old novel I found in the used section of Flourish and Blotts.”</p><p>“Is it any good?” The other boy looked at it with interest, studying the drawn silhouette of a man wearing a sloping brimmed hat and smoking a pipe. </p><p>“Well, it’s Muggle, I think, so I’m having a little trouble following along, but it’s interesting enough.” Theo paused, then transferred the book to his left hand and held out the one closest to Potter. “I’m Theo Nott, by the way.”</p><p>Potter gave him a strange look as he took Theo’s hand and gave it a brief shake. “I know who you are.”</p><p>“Oh,” Theo said intelligently. Potter knew who he was? As far as he knew, the other boy had never even looked his way. He struggled to bring his brain back to some semblance of order. They sat in silence after that, having run out of conversation, Theo rolling his novel into a tube-shape that was surely ruining it, and Potter getting more drowsy with each passing mile. His sideways slump was alarming, culminating with Potter’s cheek resting on Theo’s shoulder as he lightly snored in Theo’s ear. Stiff as a board, Theo frantically glanced around the compartment, at a loss as to what to do with a sleeping Saviour, but no one was paying attention to the two of them. Expect for Pansy, that was, who only sent him a smirk, which was absolutely no help at all. So he just sat as still as possible for the next hour and stared out the window, acutely aware of Potter’s warm breath on the side of his neck.</p><p>As they entered the foothills close to where Hogwarts was situated, Potter finally stirred, but to Theo’s horror, instead of sitting up, he only burrowed in closer. </p><p>“Your shoulder is bony.” The other boy’s messy hair tickled Theo’s jawline and he wanted desperately to run his fingers through the dark curls. He clenched his fingers around the crushed novel in his lap so tightly they turned white at the knuckles.</p><p>“No one asked you to use it as a pillow,” he replied, jostling the other boy hard in an attempt to dislodge him. This was too intimate, like they were something, like they were <em>anything</em> but two strangers who happened to go to the same school.</p><p>With a dramatic sigh, Potter finally straightened, shoving his glasses up to rub at his eyes. “Cranky. Maybe <em> you </em>need a nap.”</p><p>How was he supposed to respond to the teasing note in Potter’s voice? Theo was unprepared to deal with The Boy Who Lived using him as a pillow and making jokes that almost, if Theo squinted hard enough, sounded like he was flirting. But that was impossible. Potter was dating Weasley’s little sister, or had been at the end of last year. As far as Theo knew Potter was one hundred percent straight, and Theo was… very much not.</p><p>Lacking a response, he bent down and shoved his mutilated novel into the satchel at his feet. Unsettled, Theo took long enough to fuss with the order of the bag’s contents that Potter just gave another sigh and turned away to chat with his friends. He needed some space and time to think about their interaction, to puzzle it out. It made Theo uncomfortable that he’d so drastically misjudged Potter’s awareness of him. Had he seen Theo watching him throughout the years? All those times he couldn’t pull his eyes away from drinking in the way Potter would throw his head back and laugh, eyes bright with mirth? Or the way Theo had to hide his baffled admiration every time Potter returned victorious and full of furious life from every adventure he went off on with his friends? Did he know how obsessed Theo was with him? Was that why he had acted the way he had this afternoon? Was Potter just messing with him?</p><p>Theo didn’t know the answers to any of these questions and he didn’t like not knowing things.</p><p>Hanging back once they disembarked, he managed to dodge the rest of the eighth years and caught a ride up to the castle with a group of thirteen year old Hufflepuffs who stared at him the entire time with wide eyes. Still better than Potter pushing into his space, breathing in his ear, and turning those piercing green eyes on him without any consideration for Theo's nerves.</p><p>Yeah, that sounded like a lie even in his own head.</p><p>It seemed the universe was conspiring to foil Theo’s plan to avoid Potter until he had a better handle on things, however. It was revealed once they all reached the Great Hall that all eighth years were being sat at their own table, regardless of House. He managed to situate himself between Greg and Anthony Goldstein, at the far end the table from Potter and his friends. During the walk behind Headmistress McGonagall to the newly assigned eighth year shared quarters, Theo trailed the group, one wary eye on the messy, dark curls bobbing along in front of him. He listened with a half an ear as Draco complained about the food, being roomed in the same dorms as Gryffindors, and nearly every other thing that had happened to him that day. Theo wasn’t the only one to have a weird train ride, it turned out. From what he could surmise, Granger had spent a good portion of the time forcing the blond Slytherin to make conversation with her and, horror of horrors, even <em> smiled </em>at him several times.</p><p>“It was terrifying, Theo, I could tell the Mud— Granger was thinking of different ways to murder me the entire time. No idea why she bothered, when it was clear she wasn’t enjoying our little chat any more than I was. I can only hope I’ll never be subjected to <em> that </em>again,” Draco announced with a shudder, and Theo pretended not to see the way the other boy’s gaze lingered on Granger’s face when she turned her head to talk to Parvati Patil.</p><p>It was a relief when they finally reached the corner of the sixth floor where the castle had expanded itself to accommodate the returning older students, right up until McGonagall left them to read over the room assignments and sort themselves out. Theo watched and waited as the others exchanged high fives and hugs, or turned to their friends and rolled their eyes, depending on what rooms they were put in. Potter stepped up, Granger and Weasley flanking him, and perused the list, a slight smile crossing his face when Granger leaned over and whispered something in his ear. He moved away, his eyes locking on Theo’s for a few seconds before Dean Thomas called him over to join the group lounging on the couches arranged around an immense fireplace. Rubbing at the prickling hair on the back of his neck, Theo joined Draco at the table, searching for their names.</p><p>To his surprise, the rooms were set up for pairs only. No more sharing a dorm with a group. On one hand, he was glad not to be subjected to late night brawling or drunken escapades, the uneven chorus of multiple people snoring, and fighting for shower time with five other boys. On the other hand…</p><p>
  <em> Theodore Nott and Harry Potter </em>
</p><p>He stared at the paper. This must be some sort of bloody joke. Someone found out about his crush and was pranking him. There was no way the universe was this cruel.</p><p>“Bad luck there, Nott. Better keep your guard up.” Draco patted his shoulder in sympathy as he caught sight of Theo's room assignment. He blindly let the blond steer him away from the table, wondering if it was inappropriate common room behavior to give into the threat of hysterical laughter bubbling up in his chest. Rooming with Potter, the one boy he’d ever wanted, who was almost certainly straight, and just happened to be the darling of the Wizarding world, for <em> an entire year</em>?</p><p>He was so very fucked.<br/>
