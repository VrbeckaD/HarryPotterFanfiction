    <p>December 8th, 1979</p><p>Tom Riddle sat at the table in the dining room of Riddle Manor, reading the Daily Prophet, waiting for his wife to come down from upstairs. Severus soon made his way downstairs, shaking as he held the stick close to his chest. Tom looked up when Severus entered, his smile soon turned to a frown as he noticed his mate shaking. <br/>"Is everything ok love?" Tom rushed over to Severus. With a shaking hand, Severus slow brought Tom's hand to his stomach and showed him the test with two pink lines.<br/>"Tom... I'm pregnant..." Tom's jaw dropped for a few seconds before a huge smile broke out over his face as he got on his knees in front of Severus. <br/>"Hi baby, it's daddy..." He nuzzled his mate's belly. Severus just smiled, running his hands through Tom's hair. He's already a great dad. He thought, knowing his baby would be loved greatly.</p><p>February 14th, 1980</p><p>Severus and Tom sat on their bed, Tom sitting behind his love rubbing the 5 month bump as Narcissa Malfoy nee' Black checked up on the baby. <br/>"Your baby is health and they're in a position to get the gender. Do you want to know?" Severus nodded, grabbing Tom's hand. Narcissa smiled before performing another spell.</p><p>"Congrats guys, you're having a baby boy." Tom smiled, rubbing Severus' stomach.</p><p>"We'll have a son." He whispered, kissing Sev's neck.</p><p>"Can you tell if he's gotten our creature genes?" Severus asked. Narcissa performed another spell.</p><p>"He's going to be a pureblood dark veela. He already has some of the bones for wings growing. It looked like you're going to be having a veela birth." Severus nodded, smiling down at his bloated stomach. His chick.</p><p>March 25th, 1980</p><p>Severus lay in their bed, crying as he stuffed chocolate covered pickles in his mouth. Tom rubbed his belly as he cooed in his ear.</p><p>"It's alright darling. I won't let that happen." Seveus cried harder.</p><p>"Ho-how can y-you kn-know?! Y-you ca-can't control t-that!!" He screamed before sobbing harder.</p><p>"I can make some if that ever happens, alright? I won't let you ever go without chocolate covered pickles, even if they do stop making them." He whispered in Sev's ear, nuzzling his neck. <br/>"Pr-promise?" Severus asked in a quiet voice, on the edge of falling asleep from his crying.</p><p>"I promise."</p><p>July 31st, 1980</p><p>A loud screech was sent across the manor as Severus hissed at people to stay away. He had shifted to his veela form, his chick ready to be born. Everyone kept back, Tom cooing at his mate, having also shifted to help calm Severus. He screeched again as he pushed, feeling his chick coming. After 4 hours, their chick was born. Severus curled around the baby veela, keeping it warm as Tom sat near, protecting his mate and chick. The small chick screeched as he cuddled into his mother, soon latching on to his mother's nipple to feed for the first time. Tom and Severus cooed, snuggling with their small child.</p><p>April 12th, 1981</p><p>Hadrian Riddle squawked inside his crib, having not shifted into his human form, only being 9 months old. Severus came in, smiling at his chick as he picked him up, taking him down the family room where his husband and their close friends were. Severus put the baby veela next to Draco Malfoy, the 2 year old son of Lusicas and Narcissa Malfoy. Draco was a pureblood black wolf, and also not being 5 yet, he was still in his wolf form. He slowly walked over to Hadrian, having never seen a veela, let alone a baby. Hadrian screeched, reaching for the pup, who had been startled and was now hiding behind his father's leg. <br/>"Seems Hadrian likes Draco." Tom said. All the adults chucked as Draco nipped at Hadrian, Hadrian cooing and nuzzling Draco in return.</p><p>October 31st, 1981</p><p>Hadrian screeches could be heard as the manor shook. Severus ran into the nursery, grabbing his chick before running to meet Tom in the safe room. He made it to Tom's study just as the window blew open. Severus screamed as he used his body to protect his chick. More members of The Order of the Phoenix came in, pointing their wands at Severus. He quickly left the study, heading to the basement to get to the other entrance of the safe room. Tom soon joined them as they ran, often turning back to fire a spell or two. They make it to the basement and enter the safe room, locking the door and fire calling the Malfoy's.</p><p>"Tom, what's going on?" Lusicas asked, seeing the safe room.</p><p>"Lusicas, we need your help. The manor is under attack. Open the floo to us." The blonde man nodded, before disappearing. Severus got in first taking Hadrian with him as he flooed to Malfoy Manor, Tom right behind him. They closed off the floo before sighing and thanking their friend. They soon found out they weren't the only ones that had been attacked. The Potters had also been attacked, their 7 month old son Jackson being the only survivor.</p><p>July 31st, 1985</p><p>Hadrian screeched loudly as he was in pain. Severus and Tom held their son as he went through his first shift. Their manor had been destroyed, but as soon as they could, they rebuilt it, knowing they couldn't stay at Malfoy Manor. Soon, Hadrian's screeches turned to sobs as he finished his shift, clinging to his parents.</p><p>"It's alright my chick, it's over now." Severus soothed, rubbing Hadrian's back. His skin was pale and his hair midnight black, his eyes a dark red. He was a perfect mix of them both.</p><p>Tom looked at his mate, the two of them making a silent agreement. No one is to know about Hadrian for his protection.</p>
