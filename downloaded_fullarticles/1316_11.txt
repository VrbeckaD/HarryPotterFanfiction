‘<em>Blasted Muggles, how do they deal with such loathsome, decalescent conditions this time of year! Even this time in London it didn’t get this miserable! If only there was a spell I could cast so these poor gits wouldn’t suffer. Curse Abraxas for banishing me to the states for the summer to study at Ilvermorny. It’s not like I wanted to spend my holiday learning here! I wanted to be out reeking havoc with my mates, spending time with my girlfriend, anything but being here in America. This place is horrible. I am a goddamn Slytherin well not this summer I’m a fucking Horned Serpent; I’m a bloody fucking Malfoy for Merlin's sake! Why the fuck am I here? I haven’t done anything to deserve this sort of punishment. At least this is my last time I have to set foot in this hell hole and then I have a few days to myself to do whatever. I think I shall take the time to really visit visit New York City again that was always a fun-’</em> His thoughts were interrupted when he stepped foot into his next class.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Glad you could join us Mr. Malfoy. I thought for sure you were going to skip out on your Arithmancy final exam!” The Arithmancy professor exclaimed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Final Exam? You mean my OWLs?”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Is that not what I said?” The Arithmancy professor raised his eyebrows towards him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“I forget that you’re American and don’t call them levels.” He rolled his eyes and mumbled to himself. “Yes I am here and ready to take my ‘final exam.’” His voice dripping with sarcasm, the whole class chuckled.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Alright cut the crap, Lucius. Just take the damn thing and,” in his best mocking, British accent “be on your merry way. Pip pip cheerio.”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“As you know I find that horribly offensive. I could throw an unforgivable at you.” Lucius threw back sarcastically whilst cocking an eyebrow.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“You could do that if you wanted to. Surely, your father would send you here again in fall for your sixth year and we both you know how that would turn out.” The professor winked at him. Lucius looked at him with a horrified expression. The professor wrote out their instructions for their OWLs on the board and informed them they had an hour and forty five minutes to finish. Lucius studied the board intently, why was he so nervous all of a sudden. He’d never been nervous for an OWL before, why had this one been different?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As the time limit came closer, Lucius rubbed his temples to soothe the migraine he felt creeping, ‘Come on you can do this, you have just the extra question left on the next page. It would probably be an improbably one to answer like calculate the highest number in the Fibonacci or something to do with the Golden Ratio.’ He turned the page to reveal a simple question. ‘Calculate your Vibrational number, write down your birth date in great detail and describe it.’<br/>
<br/>
‘It so simple but I can’t remember how to calculate a bloody vibrational number?!’ He pounded his fist on the desk gaining the attention of all of his classmates and his professor.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Mr. Malfoy are you alright?” He inquired; the professor didn’t think Lucius would have such great difficulty with this exam. He thought that he would have been finished by now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“My apologises, Professor Langdon. I’ve come down with a migraine and I can’t seem to focus on this last question. Am I able to ask you in front of all of my classmates or must I meet you in front of the room?”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“No no, ask away.” Professor Langdon responded whilst putting his glasses on his face.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Could you tell me.. Uh never mind I figured it out. Sorry to have wasted your time” Truth is, he didn’t figure it out. The Malfoys didn’t ask for help, they were better than that. They figured things out on their own.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Are you sure?” Pulling his glasses down to study him more intently.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Yes.” Lucius gritted his teeth and tapped his finger on his parchment. ‘Let’s see, knowing these insolent fools it probably has something to do with my birthday. Alright, simple enough.’ He began scribbling on his parchment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<em>I was born to parents of Abraxas Scorpius Malfoy and Thalia Regina Malfoy. When calculated, using the Agrippan method, their character numbers are both 6. I guess you could say it’s fate, if you believe in that sort of thing. Now back to me, when calculated. I produce a five. Number five is Jupiter. Jupiter is said to be one of instability and unpredictability. Now it suggests a change and chaos and a willingness to take risks and try different things. Us fives are accustomed to take action, meet new people and marvel at the wonders of the world. We can also irresponsible and quick-tempered WHICH IS A CROCK OF SHITE!”</em> He wrote out of sheer frustration and instantly regretted it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Alright class, turn in your exams and you’re dismissed. I’ll see most of you again in a few weeks at the start of the next term.” The entire class shuffled out of the room, dropping their exams on Professor Langdon’s desk as they exited the classroom. Lucius hesitated briefly before setting his exam on the professor's desk, almost praying to Merlin that he passes. “I’m sure you did fine Mr. Malfoy.”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Thanks for the reassurance.” His voice oozing with sarcasm and with that he walked out of his Arithmancy class and headed back towards his dormitory.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Upon his arrival back to dormitory, he was greeted by one of his house elves. “Dobby is here to deliver a message from Master Malfoy, Mister Malfoy!”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Get on with it then!” Dobby pulled out a clean, crisp envelope with the infamous Malfoy wax seal on it. This made him quite nervous and realize he never wrote a letter to his father, giving him updates on his progress at school.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“<em>Greetings My son,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I’ve written to you because there has been a change in schedule. Your mother has fallen ill and I need you home in two days from tomorrow rather than a week as I had promised you when I sent you to America. I apologise in advance because I will also not be meeting you in London, like I said your mother has fallen ill and I must attend to her. I have sent Dobby to help you gather pack your belongings and he can apparate back here. Unfortunately I haven’t taught you that yet, though I promise I will once your mother is of strength again. Dobby has an envelope with some Muggle money, enough to get by for a week, I trust that you don’t blow through it all within a night. But should you need more just send for Dobby and I’ll give you more. Arrangements have been made for you to stay in New York City at the St. Regis. Penthouse. It’s a little excess, but I’ll have nothing but the best for my son! Anyways, I should get back to your mother. I love you, see you in a few days. Best of Luck,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Abraxas.”</em><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“DOBBY! Pack my things; I’m leaving on the next train. It leaves in ten minutes!” Lucius scrambled around his room for a sack to throw some extra clothes in for a couple days. He hadn’t predicted the weather here to be so hot. Forget it, he could purchase Muggle clothing in New York when he arrived later in the evening. Getting to the train was more important. “DOBBY! Apparate me to the South Station, I cannot miss the express to Grand Central!”<br/>
“Yes Mister Malfoy! Right away Mister Malfoy!”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When they arrived at the station, Lucius didn’t even bother to thank Dobby before taking off into a full sprint down South Station. Incompetent elf, apparated them at the end of the terminal. Luckily he wasn’t the only one running behind schedule. There was a woman with black and blonde hair, not much older than he was, wearing similar robes. They went to school together. Suddenly everything seemed to move in slow motion, the girl looked behind her and looked Lucius in the eyes. She had the most beautiful eyes he’d ever seen, skin of porcelain, frail and very tall. There was also a pale pink scar on the back of her neck and he could only see it when her hair swayed as she ran down the platform. I wonder what’s underneath those robes of hers, oh how i’d like to caress her inner thighs and nip at her navel. CHRIST MALFOY NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO FANTASIZE ABOUT THE GIRL AT THE STATION YOUR MOTHER IS UNWELL.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Malfoy looked at her again. There was an expression of terror written across her face as she turned her face back towards the entrance to the Ilvermorny Express platform. She went through the pillar to get to the train and he followed shortly after. Then she was gone. He was greeted with a call from the usher man.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Last call to board the Express, anyone left on the platform is to remain here until the next express arrives in five hours time!” That was Lucius’ cue to board and get out of this miserable place.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When he boarded, the Horned Serpent car was full and he wasn’t able to find the mystery girl from the station. Lucius approached an almost empty car, “Pardon me, might I accompany you on the ride to Grand Central? All the Horned Serpent cars are full.”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Of course you can Mr. Malfoy!” Lucius groaned loudly, he recognized that voice. Of course, he’d managed to find the only car with the teacher he despised most, Professor Langdon. “How are you doing Mr. Malfoy?”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Please stop calling me Mr. Malfoy,” he gritted his teeth. “That’s my father’s name. Call me Lucius. I’m quite alright, my mother has fallen ill and I must get home soon.”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Do you know what’s wrong with her?” Professor Langdon inquired.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“She probably came down with the flu or something, probably nothing too serious. She’ll be fine, my mother is a fighter.” Lucius lied through his teeth. He gazed out the window of the express, the countryside was beautiful. Why hadn’t taken the time to absorb its admiration on the ride in before? Quite honestly, he wasn’t exactly sure how she was doing and he hadn’t bothered to even write to her whilst overseas at school. He’d been too irate about being sent here in the first place to even be bothered to think about anybody but himself. Somebody could’ve been seriously been injured or worse and he couldn’t even be bothered to care. What an arse he was.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Well I hope she gets better, Lucius. Please send her my best wishes.” The professor smiled at him. Lucius wanted nothing more than to slap him. Why he got the sudden urge to? He hadn’t the slightest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“I will, thank you Professor Langdon.” He continued to gaze out the express window taking in the countryside’s beauty and grace once again, admiring the scenery before him.</p><p><br/>
“I was quite shocked about your exam, Lucius. I didn’t think you’d be the type to swear in your answers but I did find it rather amusing.” Lucius looked up him, cheeks bright red with shame.</p><p><br/>
“I am so sorry professor. I was going to erase that portion but you called time for the exam. If you wish to dock me for that childish answer, I wouldn’t be hurt by it. I was just so annoyed because I couldn’t remember how to calculate a simple vibrational number and when I did calculate it I was angry at what my number meant. It’s not your fault.”</p><p><br/>
“Don’t even worry about it Lucius. I thought it was quite funny, your answer was raw, it was real. Most kids in my class are so worried about getting their answers perfect but you didn’t seem to mind with your response. You pretty much said screw it and just wrote what you really felt. I need more students like you in my class.”<br/>
“You want sarcastic prats in your class?”</p><p><br/>
“Merlin no! I want more students who dare to keep it real. Anyways, Lucius. It was nice chatting with you but I would like to get in a nap before we get to New York. You should do the same, it’s quite a long ride.”</p><p><br/>
“Thank you Professor Langdon.”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some hours later…<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lucius got off the train at Grand Central at Platform 9.75, Americans and their numerical system, I swear. What’s next? They aren’t going to use kilometers? Lucius followed the crowd of students to the wall and patiently waited his turn to cross over into the muggle world. He scanned the remainder of the students hoping to catch a glimpse of the girl from the station. He finished the front of the crowd and was starting the back when another student shoved him forward. “Move it!” The nerve of this git. Instead of acting brash, he decided to forego confrontation and wanted to get the hell out of here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When he passed through the wall he was greeted by a man in a funny hat holding up a sign with his name on it. “Mr. Malfoy?”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Mr. Malfoy is my father, call me Lucius.” I should have a piece of parchment that says please call me Lucius attached to my front.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Hello Lucius, I am to escort you to the hotel and from there you are free to do as you please until you check out until the day after tomorrow. Do you need help with your luggage or did your house elf take them with you?” He spoke in a sophisticated manner. They began to walk off towards a utility closet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This man is a wizard! “Um no Mr..”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, my apologises! Areyes, Areyes Shacklebolt.” Areyes held out his hand for Lucius, Lucius reciprocated the gesture with a firm hand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Thank you, Mr. Shacklebolt. Say, are there any parks here I can take a good stroll in?”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Yes there’s many but my personal favorite is Tompkins Square Park off of E 9th St. Now, if you could hold onto my arm dear boy.” There was an unfamiliar tug emanating from his stomach followed by darkness.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The lobby of The St. Regis was completely empty, thank god. He wouldn’t want to be exposed as a wizard. Lucius was mesmerized by the decor of the lobby; it reminded him of the manor in a way; the neatness, the poise but it was decorated with white and cream pieces to brighten the room. Areyes spoke up, “If you could follow me please, here’s this for you.” He conjured a key. “You're in the penthouse suit entire top floor; you'll need the key to access it.”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Leave it to Abraxas to give the very best for his children.” Lucius mumbled to himself. “Thank you Mr. Shacklebolt.”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Tell your father I said hello would you?”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Of course I will.” With that, Lucius pressed the up button and waited for the lift to come down from the twenty sixth floor. He wondered how many floors there were in this hotel.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When he got into the elevator his question was answered, there were 40 floors in this hotel. ‘Merlin that’s a lot of rooms’ He didn’t realize how exhausted he’d become, his migraine was beginning to return. Lucius put the key in the slot and twisted, the 40th floor lit up. Suddenly his vision started to become very blurry and his head started spinning, it was hitting him faster than he’d anticipated. The elevator dinged once he reached the top floor, he’d never been so thankful that an elevator opened inside his hotel room before. He was stumbling like a drunken fool. “DOBBY!” He shouted as he landed face down on the bed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Yes Mister Malfoy!” Why was he always so enthusiastic all the bloody time?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“I need a pain relieving potion and a sleeping draught NOW!”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Does Mister Malfoy want me to get a migraine potion?”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Those don’t work for me, hurry please!” Dobby was suddenly out of the room with a loud pop. Why a loud pop and not a plume of smoke? Dobby returned frantically with only one potion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Dobby is so sorry, Master Malfoy has given the last pain reliever to Madam Malfoy as Dobby walked in. Dobby only has a sleeping draught.” Dobby spoke in a worried tone and Lucius brushed it off.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“That’s fine.” He took the draught and didn’t even remember falling asleep.<br/>
<br/>
The next day Lucius woke up with only a minor headache. He looked over at the clock and it read 12:30pm. He groaned slightly, he didn’t want to get out of bed. Lucius looked around the room and realized somebody had tucked him in and he was changed out of his school robes.<br/>
<br/>
Pulling the covers off of him, he made his way to the bathroom. When he got there, there was his toothbrush and a set of clothes that were appropriate for the hot weather in New York. Quickly getting dressed and brushing his teeth, he decided to go for a walk in Tompkins Square Park today. Conveniently, there was a subway map on his way out the door. Lucius spoke out loud to himself. “Okay, I need to get on the B line at 5th and 53rd then get on the L line at 6th. Take the L all the way to 1st and 14th and walk to the park.”<br/>
<br/>
The subway was crowded with people, it smelled of urine and bad body odor. Before he knew it, there was a voice overhead. “6th street station.” Lucius quickly got up and exited the subway car and made his way to the L platform, which surprisingly wasn’t as crowded as he anticipated for a Saturday afternoon.</p><p><br/>
When the subway pulled up to the platform, he shoved his way onto the L line and off he went. He’d wondered where all those people had come from. Before long, he arrived at the 1st St/14th Ave station and he made his way out of the underground system and suddenly he felt like he could breathe again. As he walked towards Tompkin Square, Lucius wondered if walking back to the hotel later in the evening would be the better option rather than having to suffer through that again.<br/>
He continued walking and he accidently bumped into something, not something, someone. “Oh my sincerest apologies, are you alright?”</p><p><br/>
“Yes, I’m fine.” She sounded annoyed with him. She brushed herself off and looked up at him. “Wait, you’re the man from the station!”</p><p><br/>
“There were plenty of men at the station my dear.” He mused, getting a smile from her, “but alas, I am the man you are referring to. Lucius Malfoy.” He held out his hand.<br/>
“Narcissa Black.” She returned the gesture, he held a firm grip. He pulled her hand up and kissed the back of it softly. Narcissa blushed. “I-”</p><p><br/>
“I-” They spoke in unison, laughed and both looked at their feet.</p><p><br/>
Lucius noticed the journal on the ground next to her and reached down to pick it up when she reached down to get it. Their hands brushed and they felt a surge run through them almost like it was a breath of fresh air. Narcissa pulled her hand away and Lucius picked up the journal. “Is this yours?” Narcissa sheepishly tucked her hair behind her ear and nodded her head yes. “Do you write?” Another nod. “Do you speak?”</p><p><br/>
“Yes” She laughed. “I write too.” They started walking into the park.</p><p><br/>
“What do you like to write about?” Lucius inquired.</p><p><br/>
“Just about how I’m feeling, some songs, poems, essays.” She blushed slightly.</p><p><br/>
“Can I hear something?”</p><p><br/>
“Maybe a little later, I want to get to know you a little bit better before I dump my feelings onto you.”<br/>
“I totally understand. I guess we can start simple. What is your middle name?”</p><p><br/>
“Aurelia. I really don’t like it, I don’t think it flows with my last name.”</p><p><br/>
“Narcissa Aurelia Black.” He let that sink in for a moment and blurted out, “I like the ring of Narcissa Aurelia Malfoy.”</p><p>Narcissa’s eyes went wide and she stared at him for a moment. He turned and grinned at her. “Narcissa breathe, you’re going to faint. It was merely a joke.”</p><p><br/>
“It does sound better, Lucius Malfoy are you courting me already?” She asked slyly while winking. Goddamn she was perfect.</p><p><br/>
“Maybe..” Lucius played.</p><p><br/>
“Well, I would accept your offer in due time. Now, what is your middle name?”</p><p><br/>
“Okay, you’re going to laugh when I tell you. My parents really wanted another daughter but we cursed with me.”</p><p><br/>
“Oh come on it can’t be that bad, can it?”</p><p><br/>
“My full name is Lucius…” he whispered his middle name. “Penelope Malfoy.”</p><p><br/>
“I’m sorry did you say Penelope?” Narcissa burst out laughing.</p><p><br/>
“See! I told you it was bad!” Lucius growled.</p><p><br/>
“No it’s really cute… for someone so manly to have such a girly middle name.”</p><p><br/>
“Now don’t tell anyone, I always tell people my middle name it Abraxas after my father.”</p><p><br/>
“I won’t tell a soul… Penelope.”</p><p><br/>
“I’m leaving, I will not be made fun of.” He started to storm off when she called back for him.</p><p><br/>
“Lucius, I’m sorry please don’t leave!” Lucius smirked and stopped in his tracks. He walked back over to her and she placed a kiss on his lips casually. He blushed.</p><p><br/>
“What was that for?” His lips burned with pleasure and desire.</p><p><br/>
“It was to tell you that I was sorry and I want you to stay.” This time, he kissed her.</p><p><br/>
“All is forgiven. Tell me more about yourself.”</p><p><br/>
“Well my name is Narcissa and I love to write, I will be attending Hogwarts for the first time in autumn hopefully in the House of Slytherin. I use to attend Beauxbatons. I think I would die in any other house so I’ve been told. I have two sisters, Andromeda and Bellatrix. You may have met Bellatrix at Hogwarts, she’s got scraggly teeth and acts a little crazy..” he interrupted her.</p><p><br/>
“If by little, you mean nearly setting me and my best mate on fire for calling her a psychopath in front of our Defense Against the Dark Arts class, then yeah she’s a little crazy.”</p><p><br/>
“It was you and a guy named Snape that she nearly set fire to?!” She screamed louder than anticipated.<br/>
“Ding ding ding!” He said mimicking a bell.</p><p><br/>
“Oh my god I’m so sorry! She really is a psychopath though..” She laughed uncontrollably.<br/>
“Is there something you wish to tell me?” Her laughter died down.</p><p><br/>
“She used a sectumsempra on me a few times just for, what's the phrase.. Shits and laughs?”</p><p><br/>
“Shits and giggles, is the phrase you are looking for. Is that why you have a scar on the back of your neck?” He inquired.<br/>
“You can see it?” She asked, terror written all over her face.</p><p><br/>
“I noticed it when I ran after you in the station. Your glam charm is starting to fade. May I see it?” Without speaking, Narcissa pulled her shirt over her shoulder revealing a thick, pink scar that went from her right armpit up to her neck in the shape of a serpent. Lucius gently traced the scar, sending shivers up her spine and goosebumps slowly crept. “Wow, I don't even know what to say. Bellatrix did this to you?” She nodded her head, she turned and he brought her to his chest.</p><p><br/>
“Thank you and yes, I was always the guinea pig when she was learning new spells. She thought I was an easy target and I was because I was so young.”</p><p><br/>
“When did she start these… experiments?”</p><p><br/>
“When I was 11. So five years ago..”</p><p><br/>
“Next time I see her she’s going to wish she hadn’t used you as a guinea pig. I promise you that. Can you read me something, just to take our minds off?”</p><p><br/>
“Sure.” She walked to the tree and sat under it and signaled for Lucis to sit next to her. “Lay down and close your eyes. It’s pretty intense, You ready?” He complied.</p><p><br/>
“Yep.”</p><p><br/>
“Once upon a time,<br/>
You and all your kind lived underneath bridges,<br/>
Had ridges for ribs that dropped off into empty chests as<br/>
If your hearts were all stolen treasures,<br/>
As if an excavation crew were hired to dig up and remove<br/>
The part of you that let you feel.<br/>
And while the world above you invented the wheel, you<br/>
Stayed put,<br/>
Knowing it would one day need to roll over top of you to<br/>
Get to where it’s going.<br/>
You had an endlessly flowing supply line of food.<br/>
You began to brood over humanity and made meals of our hope,<br/>
As if you crushing our spirits would make you mirrors cast<br/>
Better reflections than the ones they gave,<br/>
As if the only way you could save yourselves was to make<br/>
The world ugly so no one would notice you hiding in it.<br/>
You learned to knit pain into a kind of camouflage,<br/>
Treated hope like a mirage that you could use to lure in<br/>
You next meal.<br/>
You lived off our fears, as if you could taste what we feel.<br/>
And every night, as the moon read bedtime stories to sunlight.<br/>
You took darkness as an invite to head out into the world,<br/>
You curled your hands into wrecking balls, you breath<br/>
Became Squalls, you made rocks rumble, you made land shiver.<br/>
You made boys and girls pray that someone would deliver<br/>
Them from you<br/>
We told them you aren’t real.<br/>
Then one day, the world changed, but you all stayed the same.<br/>
Just migrated from living underneath bridges to living<br/>
Underneath information superhighways.<br/>
Days and nights became meaningless, each already<br/>
Deepened chest became an abyss that no one would ever<br/>
Find the bottom of.<br/>
Concepts like love fell into your gravity, we turned<br/>
Ourselves into life preservers, hoping to save as many as would could,<br/>
But the fathers who stood guarding closet doors and the<br/>
Mothers who secure the floors underneath beds,<br/>
All shook their heads not knowing how to deal with you.<br/>
You, who crept into our lives with tongues like knives<br/>
Stabbing your words into our skin.<br/>
You began to begin uploading yourselves into our homes<br/>
You have computer screens for eyes, and software for bones.<br/>
You turned your hate into stones and hurled them at beauty,<br/>
As if you couldn’t beat to see anything other than ugly,<br/>
Anything different.<br/>
You had fingernails like flint, and scraped them along<br/>
Decency hoping we would be the ones to all catch fire.<br/>
You all had smiles like one-way barbed wire not meant to keep us out,<br/>
Meant to keep us in<br/>
Voice like a firing pin, you spoke in explosions<br/>
It isn’t cute. It isn’t funny.<br/>
You’ve talked strangers into death, and laughed.<br/>
And as each family learns to graft skin over the wounds<br/>
You gave them, you hem yourselves into the scar.<br/>
You have coaxed the sober back into bars,<br/>
Handed out cigars at memorials,<br/>
Offered nooses, cliffs, and pills to those who unfortunately found you before they found help.<br/>
You have praised suffering,<br/>
Waltzed in between tragedies,<br/>
Gracefully dipping misery as if we would somehow be<br/>
Impressed by the dexterity of your animosity.<br/>
You have cheered on rape, dashed through police tape as<br/>
If it were the finish line in a race of who can be awful first.<br/>
Even now,<br/>
You somehow see this as an invitation to turn your<br/>
Keyboards into catapults,<br/>
Wondering which of you can be the first to hate this best.<br/>
Your loathing, already dressed in riot gear,<br/>
Ready to incite rage,<br/>
As if each message board is a stage,<br/>
Where you recite hostility,<br/>
Turning freedom of speech into freedom of cruelty.<br/>
We are stuck with you, the same way you are stuck with you.<br/>
Your mind is glue, and it keeps malice fastened there like cheap wallpaper.<br/>
We were once upon a time told that none of you exist, we<br/>
Dismissed you as make believe or myth.<br/>
Now armed only with resolve, we can no longer afford to tell ourselves that you aren’t real.<br/>
We will not let you make your dinners out of the things we feel.” A single tear slipped out of Narcissa.</p><p><br/>
“Wow, that’s amazing Narcissa. I never knew words could hit that hard. Can I ask you where you got the inspiration for this?” Lucius turned to look at her.</p><p><br/>
“I had an older sister who took her own life a few months ago because she was tortured by her so called friends not only online but at school as well. Her name was Nova. I think about her everyday. She was only fourteen.” Narcissa wiped away her tears.</p><p><br/>
“I lost a sister too.”</p><p><br/>
“How?”</p><p><br/>
“My father found out she was in love with a muggle and he killed her fiance and her. He used an unforgivable, the illustrious Avada Kedavra. I never forgave him for that. I remember your sister married a muggle and ran off. I wish my sister could have done the same within a timely manner.” Narcissa crawled over to him and laid her head on his chest and silently cried. Lucius squeezed her tightly, they both needed this more than they realized.</p><p><br/>
“Lucius I need you to promise me something. If you and I were to ever have children, we must allow them to marry who they choose. Even if they want to marry muggles, please. I cannot imagine never speaking to my child because of someone they marry. I miss my sister so much.” Narcissa broke into sobs.</p><p><br/>
“I, Lucius Penelope Malfoy, solemnly swear that no matter who my child decides to marry, I will love them unconditionally.”</p>
