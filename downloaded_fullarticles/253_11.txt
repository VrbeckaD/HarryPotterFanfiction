    <p> </p>
<p>Sirius glanced at his best friend and wasn’t surprised to see the same worry reflected in Remus’s amber eyes. Harry should be celebrating today. He shouldn’t be on bed, tossing and turning, screaming, crying his eyes out. Harry shouldn’t be sick.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius couldn’t understand what had happened to Harry in a matter of hours. He’d been fine the day before, he’d been in perfect health. There had been no indication that Harry was down with anything.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Neither he nor Remus could understand what had happened to their godson so suddenly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Poppy should be arriving any minute now, Sirius.” Sirius snapped out of his musings as he heard Remus. He glanced at his friend who gave him a tired smile. “Harry will be fine. Don’t worry.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius nodded at his friend as he ran a hand through his hair. This wasn’t how he’d envisioned Harry on his seventeenth birthday. Harry should have been laughing and enjoying with him and Remus. What the hell did someone up there have against his godson?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Mr. Black, please. Calm down.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius lifted his head to look at the matron who gave him a gentle smile. “Harry will be alright. Just let me do my work.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus tugged Sirius to him and squeezed his shoulder in reassurance. “It will be fine, Sirius. We have to let Poppy do her work.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius didn’t want to leave Harry’s side but he reluctantly went with Remus to stand at the foot of the bed with Dumbledore. Harry was in so much pain. His face was deathly pale, sweat pouring down his cheeks in tiny rivulets. The way his hands were clutching the bed sheets, Sirius was surprised that Harry hadn’t torn them off by sheer force.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What the hell had happened to Harry that had reduced him to this state?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Poppy is right, Sirius,” Sirius glanced at the headmaster of Hogwarts whose eyes were devoid of their usual twinkle. “Harry will be alright.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius closed his eyes and hoped nothing worse will happen to Harry. Wasn’t being <em>that</em> enough?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Poppy first put Harry in a magical sleep. There was no way she could treat the teen while he was tossing and turning on the bed. It was clear to everyone present in the room how much pain Harry was in. She caressed the young man’s cheek as soon as he fell asleep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The matron smiled softly as she patted Harry’s head. “You’ll be alright, Harry. You’ll be fine, darling.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Poppy waved her wand over Harry in a circular motion and frowned when the spell showed no results. That was certainly odd. If Harry had any illness or ailment, the affected body part should have glowed blue. But it seemed Harry wasn’t suffering from any sickness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The mediwitch tried two more spells which gave her the same result. Poppy furrowed her brows in confusion as she glanced at the teen on the bed. Harry was physically fine, very healthy, in fact.  She just couldn’t understand why he was sick then. She glanced at Harry’s face and her chest tightened as she saw the remnants of tears on his cheeks. Her heart bled for the boy who was clutching his stomach, even in his comatose state.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Poppy’s eyes widened as the thought crossed her mind. That cannot be true! It couldn’t possibly be true! Harry was only seventeen and she was sure she would have known if Harry had a boyfriend in school. The boy preferred to be alone, she was sure of that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And what she was thinking was too bizarre to even contemplate. Male pregnancies were almost nonexistent. There had only been six wizards in the magical world who had given birth. No one knew what was so special about the six men who had developed appropriate organs for the duration of their pregnancy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Poppy murmured the spell and waved her wand over Harry’s abdomen. She closed her eyes when a small red ball of light formed over the spelled area.</p>
<p>She was right.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus glanced at Poppy and wondered what she had discovered about Harry’s condition when she had examined him. He knew if it was something serious, she would have told him and Sirius immediately. She hadn’t said anything though.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Poppy had quietly asked him, Sirius and Dumbledore to leave the room, they had.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, they were all sitting on the couch, waiting for Harry to wake up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus again looked at Poppy who was sitting beside Dumbledore, looking at her hands as if they were the most interesting things in the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why wasn’t she saying anything? She hadn’t even told Dumbledore what she had discovered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Uh–uh–”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius and Remus immediately stood up as they heard Harry’s groans. They glanced at Poppy and both the Marauders were shocked to see that Dumbledore was alone, Poppy wasn’t beside him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They glanced back at Harry’s bed and Remus couldn’t help but think Poppy must be an extraordinary witch to disapparate to Harry’s side that quickly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“How are you, Harry?” Pomfrey asked as she waved her wand over him in complex motions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry tried to smile at his guardians and Pomfrey but his facial muscles refused to obey. He was just so—tired. He wanted to sleep again, anything to get out of feeling that pain. He didn’t even understand what had happened to him. One minute he was being embraced by Remus and Sirius, next he was screaming on the floor, clutching his stomach. His stomach and scar had hurt so badly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry didn’t think he had ever felt such pain in his life before. Voldemort wasn’t even angry at that moment. He couldn’t understand why his scar had felt like it was on fire.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Better I suppose.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pomfrey smiled sadly at the teen and wondered what he would do once he realizes why he was ill.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius looked close to fainting after hearing Poppy’s diagnosis. It was only Remus’s hand on his shoulder that stopped him from falling on the floor in a graceless heap. Remus himself didn’t know where he got the strength to stand on his own two legs and support Sirius.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dumbledore looked bewildered by his employee’s explanation about Harry’s condition. The man was at a loss for words. He really didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The three adult’s reaction, though, was nothing compared to Harry’s.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry’s eyes widened in shock and automatically his hands went to his stomach. This was a lie! This can’t be happening to him. He can’t be pregnant!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There were so many things that didn’t make sense in that sentence that he didn’t know which thing he should address first. He wasn’t involved with anyone, he didn’t even like anyone. And he was a boy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wasn’t it enough that he was a horcrux of Tom, now he had a child growing inside of him too?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry’s musings came to a halt as he realised what he’d just thought. An icy feeling settled in the pit of his stomach and a cold shiver went down his spine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tom Marvolo Riddle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He had Tom Riddle’s soul inside him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Do a parentage test. Right now!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The four adults turned to Harry and Sirius let out a strangled sound when he saw the tears running down Harry’s cheeks. Why? Why was Harry going through so much?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Madam Pomfrey,” Harry whispered softly. “Please. Tell me who the father is." He looked in the matron's eyes who herself looked close to tears. "I don’t have any interest in anyone. I don’t like anyone. I am not involved with anyone nor will I ever be. I don’t like intimacy or sex or romance in general. I don’t know where this baby came from.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Poppy did the only thing she could in the situation, she hugged Harry to her chest. She felt Harry’s arms tighten around her waist and couldn’t stop the tears falling from her eyes as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Shh, Harry. Shhh,” Poppy whispered and caressed Harry’s back, “You’ll be fine, darling. I promised you, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>Harry sniffled in the mediwitch’s neck and continued to cry in the motherly woman’s embrace.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Are you alright now?” Pomfrey softly asked Harry after he had calmed down.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry nodded. “Yes. Please do the spell.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pomfrey inhaled deeply then waved her wand in circles over Harry’s abdomen thrice before slashing the wand in air. A small slip of paper appeared in the air which she caught and handed it to Harry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With trembling hands, Harry took the paper from Madam Pomfrey. He knew whose name will be on the paper, he just didn’t want to admit it to himself. There was no other explanation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry knew he was brave, he was courageous, but even he wasn’t that brave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With shaking fingers, Harry opened the paper and closed his eyes as he read the name on the white sheet of paper. Fresh batch of tears slipped from his eyes and he didn’t know whether he should laugh or cry. How was this even possible? Was the horcrux supposed to do that?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry.”</p>
<p>Harry slowly opened his eyes he heard Dumbledore call his name. He looked at the man straight in the eyes and wondered for a minute will the man have an answer for this. “Go on,” he said hoarsely. “Read my mind now, professor.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dumbledore’s brows rose at Harry’s words but he didn’t do as Harry asked. Of course, he wouldn’t do that. He did that once when Harry lied about hearing the basilisk’s voice in Hogwarts, he wouldn’t do that again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry, love, what is it?” Sirius asked, taking a step forward.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry sniffled and handed the parchment back to the matron. Pomfrey took the parchment and turned the paper over to read the name. Her brows furrowed in confusion as she saw the name. Who was Tom Marvolo Riddle? She didn’t know anyone by that name. And, why did Harry not seem surprised by the name of the father?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pomfrey handed the parchment to Sirius whose eyes widened in horror at seeing the name written. He whipped his head to look at Harry who was now gazing out of the window, his face completely devoid of any emotion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius gave the parchment to Remus and ran to Harry’s side and gathered him in his arms. The moment Sirius touched Harry, the seventeen year old couldn’t control himself any longer and started crying loudly in his godfather’s arms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pomfrey turned to Dumbledore to ask what the matter was but her words died in her throat when she saw the state Remus and Dumbledore were in. She was shocked to see both the werewolf and the headmaster of Hogwarts shaking where they were standing.</p>
<p>Who was Tom Riddle?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pomfrey got her answer after Harry had quitened and fallen asleep due to exhaustion. Dumbledore told everything to her after the four of them had left Harry’s room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The matron didn’t think the reserved boy her mother had spoken of would one day become the Dark Lord Voldemort. She couldn’t have imagined even in her wildest dreams that the soft spoken boy her mother fondly talked about, Tom, was actually Tom Marvolo Riddle; Voldemort.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pomfrey knew about horcruxes since she had always been a curious child and had read all kinds of books in her father's library. She didn’t think though anybody could be cruel enough to create not only one but seven horcruxes. Nor did she think horcruxes were capable of bonding with the human vessel.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry knows what he is?” Pomfrey asked Albus.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Albus nodded tiredly and wondered for the first time if Voldemort would agree to a truce. “Yes. I told him everything after Sirius was almost killed in the Department of Mysteries. Sirius and Remus are the only two people apart from you and me who know this now.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before Pomfrey could ask anything else, Sirius spoke.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry will never hurt the child,” Sirius muttered softly, “regardless of the fact the father is—” he ran a hand through his hair and shut his eyes tightly. Fuck!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After Dumbledore had told Harry what he was, and about his plans to stop Voldemort by destroying his horcruxes, he and Remus had been prepared to do anything to help Harry. Voldemort didn’t know anything about Harry, so he was actually pretty safe. The soul piece hadn’t harmed Harry, so why should it start now. Voldemort couldn’t even come back because of it because he didn’t know about its existence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius and Remus had decided to to go on a trip to learn more about the items so they could safely extract it from Harry. Dumbledore had told them about some places which could help them in that regard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But they couldn’t do anything now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No, he wouldn’t.” Remus added from beside Sirius.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius glanced at Remus who just gave him a weary smile. “We need to talk to Harry. The only way he can be safe now is if Voldemort knows Harry is with his child. Otherwise, he’ll stop at nothing to destroy Harry.”</p>
<p>“I agree,” Dumbledore said, his blue eyes serious and steely. “We need to give Voldemort something he has wanted all this time, control with boundaries.” He sighed. “Harry has suffered enough, a child shouldn’t have to do any of this. He shouldn’t suffer anymore.”</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>When Harry woke up, the first thing he asked was how this was possible. Unfortunately for him, no one could give him a clear answer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Human horcruxes are not supposed to exist,” Dumbledore explained. “We don’t know how it happened Harry, it just did. We can only make assumptions. Maybe the moment you became an adult, the soul piece of Tom bonded with you in the only way he could.” He shook his head. “Maybe being with you healed him. I don't know, Harry. I don't. Maybe this is why human horcruxes don’t exist.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry didn’t have anything to say in response to that. He did wanted one last clarification though.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Am I still a horcrux?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dumbledore sighed. “I can do the spell to check it, if you wish. But you know the answer to your question.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry smiled sadly. “I know. But, please, for my sake, do it.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dumbledore waved his hand over Harry’s forehead, muttering words none of the people in the room had ever heard. After he was done, he smiled tiredly and shook his head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You are not a horcrux anymore.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry sighed and the four adults weren’t surprised when Harry grinned wryly, his hands going to his stomach.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You always have to make things difficult for me, don’t you, Riddle?”</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>As Sirius and Remus had expected, when Pomfrey asked if Harry wanted to keep the child, Harry started crying.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s not only his,” Harry’s heart ached at the thought of killing his own child. It wasn’t only Riddle’s. “It’s mine too. I am the one bearing the child, they are mine.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pomfrey immediately comforted Harry, caressing his hair and muttering soothing words. “It’s alright, Harry. No one is hurting your child. But we need to figure out what we need to do now.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry nodded slowly and glanced at Remus and Sirius who just smiled fondly at him. “It’s yours, Harry. That means it’s our family too. It doesn’t matter if Riddle is the father.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dumbledore patted Harry’s head and nodded in assent. “You are right, Harry.” He smiled and Harry blinked. “The child will definitely be a trouble maker, that I am sure of. Your and Riddle’s child couldn’t be anything but mischievous.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry finally smiled a true smile, something which made Harry’s guardians, Dumbledore and Pomfrey grin too.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Two days later, Sirius and Remus told Harry what they were planning to do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry clenched his hands into fists as Sirius finished telling him what the four of them had discussed with Snape. This was a stupid plan. How could they even think Tom would listen to them?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“He hates me. What makes you think he will care if I am with his child? He doesn’t seem the type to care about kids.”</p>
<p>“But we have to keep you safe, Harry. The world did not believe you and Cedric that he was back,” Sirius said slowly, “even after the debacle at the Ministry, people are unwilling to believe he has come back. They think it was only Death Eaters trying to kill the boy who vanquished their lord. Snape told us Voldemort doesn't care in the least that some of his followers died at the ministry. He could care less that they are dead.” Sirius grinned wryly, “Not one person gave a damn about my rotten cousin, Crabbe, Macnair and Mulciber. Bellatrix’s own husband, Rodolphus Lestrange had looked relieved by the news of her death.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry pursed his lips into a thin line. He didn’t want to bargain with Voldemort but he knew he couldn’t live in fear either. He had seen what that did to Sirius, he and his child can’t hide inside the Grimmauld Place or one of the Potter’s property forever. He'd been astounded when Rufus Scrimgeour had listened to him and cleared Sirius’s name after he'd been appointed the new minister. (Fudge had been thrown from the office after the attack at the ministry )</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ex-auror even believed Harry that Voldemort was back but he or anyone else could not do anything since Voldemort wasn’t doing anything. Harry and Cedric’s testimony had been dismissed by everyone, they’d been labelled as delusional, insufferable children.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rufus Scrimgeour had advised the Aurors to be vigilant, but there wasn’t anything more he could do. He had cleaned up Fudge and Umbridge’s mess to the best of his abilities and because of his effort Harry wasn’t seen as a ticking time bomb anymore. The man had done everything he could to make sure he and Cedric weren’t seen as mental anymore.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This was their only option.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Alright,” Harry conceded. “But I’ll come with you when you talk to him.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded as he got up. “Of course. You just rest and take care of yourself. We’ll inform you when we have discussed everything with Professor Snape.”</p>
