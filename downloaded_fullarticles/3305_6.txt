    <p>“Are you sure,” Kingsley asked her, looking over the plan she had put to parchment in front of him. “What if it doesn’t work?”</p>
<p>The war-weary woman nodded. “I’m sure. If it doesn’t work, I’m not any worse off. But if it does… I’ll get my best friend back.” Hermione admitted, pushing her hair out of her eyes.</p>
<p>“In more ways than one, I imagine.” Kingsley pulled a fresh piece of parchment off a pile on his desk and wrote a note on it. “This will give you access to the Department of Mysteries without question. Try not to bother the Unspeakables if you can. They’re not used to your kind of pestering,” he teased.</p>
<p>Hermione gave the smallest of smiles. “Of course, Minister.”</p>
<p>Once she was out of his office her hand instantly pushed aside her navy trench coat to her hip flask. The blue anti-anxiety potion was always with her now. War did have a way of toying with one’s mind, returning the clock pieces just a little bent. So when a trigger happened, it was as if the whole world stopped and she was left with a horrible clicking sensation of something trying to return to a normal that would never again exist. And it seemed like everything triggered her. After an embarrassing panic attack in Diagon Alley at Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes, she kept the potion in a hip flask. The apothecarist had been sympathetic but warned her that it could easily become addicting.</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head. No, she needed to be totally clear-headed for this. It wasn’t terribly dangerous, but it did require finesse and concentration. She made her way to the Department of Mysteries, giving her note to the Head Unspeakable. Once she was in front of the Veil, Hermione took off her flask and her coat, revealing jeans, heeled boots, and a green blouse. <em> You can’t do this </em> , the voices began. <em> Even if you can, what’s to say he’ll want anything to do with you? </em></p>
<p>“Shut up,” she growled to the voices, fingering the heavy platinum ring with a black diamond stone on a chain around her neck. She placed the memory vial in front of her carefully - she wouldn’t need to uncork it until later in the spell. So she took a deep breath, closed her eyes, raised her wand, and began the incantation.</p>
<p>Hermione didn’t remember much of the spell casting - she had practiced it so many times that she was almost in a trace, muscle memory doing its job. After several minutes, but what had felt like an eternity, Hermione uncorked Peter Pettigrew’s memories and sat back on her heels. Once the memory finished making its way into the Veil, it was the moment of truth. She opened her eyes, breath held in anticipation.</p>
<p>A young man with scruff and short wavy black hair walked out. He looked at his unblemished arms and hands with awe. But then he looked up and his eyes met hers. “Hermione?” he asked quietly, though the name seemed to echo in the vast chamber.</p>
<p>“Hi,” she paused, unsure, “Sirius.” The man in front of her resembled Sirius - the same hair, the same grey eyes - but he was different. No Azkaban tattoos, no haggard, haunted look, and he looked at least a decade younger. That was certainly a surprise - nobody had mentioned the deaging in her research. But, then again, nobody had actually attempted the spell on someone who had disappeared through the Veil.</p>
<p>Sirius’s face broke out into a huge smile. “You did it!”</p>
<p>Hermione nearly collapsed in happiness. Instead, she threw herself into his arms. “I did!” she said with a laugh.</p>

  <em> Dear Snuffles, </em>
</p>
<p>    I hope you’re doing well - not having to eat too many rats! I would ask you this in person, but I imagine your answer will involve a list of books and this way I don’t have to look like a fool scribbling something down while you’re telling me. Well, that and I don’t know when I’ll see you again. Plus, this way you can answer on your own time in case you need to do some research or look through your own notes. Oh, what am I kidding, you probably don’t have notes - you had Harry’s Dad to talk things through and you weren’t me. Oh dear...I am rambling, aren’t I?</p>
<p>I was wondering if you could give me some advice on becoming an animagus. There, I said it. I’ve wanted to become one every since our first Transfiguration class where Professor McGonagall transformed. It seemed like the pinnacle of magical strength and control for Transfiguration. I feel that each magical discipline has its own pinnacle - Defense against the Dark Arts might be a Patronus, Charms might be something like wards or something like wandless, nonverbal magic. And while I know there are some disciplines I will never reach that summit (Care of Magical Creatures comes to mind), Transfiguration is the one I have most wanted to achieve. I would ask Professor McGonagall but she knows me a bit too well to believe me when I’m asking for “research.” I have been researching with what few books the Hogwarts Library has, but most of them are in the Restricted Section, and it's the summer.</p>
<p>It could really help Harry, I think, depending on what animal I transform into. He really needs all the help he can get.</p>
<p>
  <em> Hermione </em>
</p>
<p>Dear Hermione,</p>
<p>    I’m in a house now, so no more rats for me. There’s plenty of ghouls and other Dark things to keep me full if I don’t want food. As for books on becoming an animagi, unfortunately, a lot of them were at Potter Manor or the flat Remus and I shared, and I’m not sure what happened to them. I’ll start checking another library I know - there’s a few books I don’t know the titles of, but I would recognize their covers anywhere. I suspect you’ll be by at some point this summer, so I’ll start a collection. For the ones I can’t find in this library, you might check the bookstore in Knockturn to see if you can find them. Last time I discussed this with Kingsley, he said the Ministry was regulating the practical books so they knew who was interested in becoming animagi. I guess they didn’t want more unregistered animals like James and me.</p>
<p>It’s a noble goal, and to be honest, a bloody useful one. If you have to go on the run as I have done, it is easier to hide. Well… scratch that. It’s easier to hide that you’re not a human. However, it will really depend on your form. A lioness isn’t exactly going to be easy to hide in the Forbidden Forest. Not that the forest hasn’t hidden stranger or more dangerous creatures before. But, you have to promise me you’ll be careful and owl me when you get past the theoretical stage if you decide to go through with it. I will help you in whatever way I can, I just want you to be safe about it.</p>
<p>
  <em> Snuffles </em>
</p>
<p>Dear Snuffles,</p>
<p>    Are you worried about me? That’s sweet, but I can take care of myself. Thank you for getting the books together. I’ve reread the portions of transfiguration texts that mention animagi over and over again, hoping that they’ll give me some sort of new information. I hate it when I can’t find the answer to something!</p>
<p>    Glad to hear you’re not solely surviving on rats anymore. I can’t imagine they’re a balanced diet anyway! I’m at the Burrow for now so I’m pretty sure that Molly is going to try to fatten me up. She also insists on making me eat food I despise. Like radishes. Who in their right mind enjoys eating radishes? I don't care if they're healthy and all that. They're disgusting. It's times like these that I miss my parents from before Hogwarts. I had to try three bites of whatever food we were having, but after that, it was up to me. I knew where they kept the bread and jam if I got hungry.</p>
<p>Harry hasn't been answering my owls. I think he's upset over Cedric’s death. I mean, it doesn't surprise me. No, it just makes me sad and worries me. Ron says he's not writing him either, but Ron is rubbish at keeping in touch. Maybe you should try. He's sure to answer you!</p>
<p>Hermione</p>
<p>
  <em> Hermione, </em>
</p>
<p>I found more books than I thought I would, and I also managed to find a few of my old notes. Hopefully, they'll be of some help to you. I have such vivid and happy memories of going through the process with James. You have to keep a Mandrake leaf in your mouth for an entire mouth and they tend to make you drool. James nearly swallowed the bloody thing several times. And then there was trying to keep it a secret from Minnie. There were a few times I had to sweet talk her into ignoring what might have been plainly obvious to those who had undergone the process. That's probably one of the reasons she doesn't like being called Minnie to this day!</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly agree. Radishes are disgusting. Much too peppery. Padfoot especially hates them. Also can’t stand peas, in case you were wondering.</p>
<p>I've written to Harry, but Hermione, remember, he needs time to process. It might backfire pushing him too soon - it always did with James. I hope I'll get to see him soon and I'll evaluate from there.</p>

  <em> *** </em>
</p>
<p>The minute the Weasleys and Hermione entered the house, Hermione could feel the dark magic in the air, settling over her like a dark, damp cloak. She felt her magic shift uncomfortably inside her - it wasn’t happy about being here - wherever this was with its peeling wallpaper and mothball smell. Crookshanks hissed in his basket at her feet. The twins, Ginny, and Molly had left her and Ron in the hallway, muttering about finding the best bedrooms or making food for the meeting. That’s when she noticed Sirius, standing at the end of the hallway leaning on a coat rack, his short wavy black hair almost glowing from the light in the room behind him.</p>
<p>“You weren’t kidding about the ghouls and dark things,” Hermione told Sirius, “I can feel it oozing around us. What is this place, anyway?”</p>
<p>“Welcome to Grimmauld Place, the London ancestral home of the Blacks and the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix,” Sirius said with a smirk and a bow.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about Hermione? Ghouls and dark things?” Ron asked from beside her, confused.</p>
<p>“Oh, I sent a letter to Sirius about a Transfiguration assignment. Told him not to eat too many rats.”</p>
<p>“Definitely haven’t been doing that. Kreacher, as disgusted as he is in me, despises rats.” Sirius paused, glancing to see if naming the creature would cause him to appear. When he didn’t, Sirius continued, “I’ll show you guys to your rooms.”</p>
<p>“And then the library?” Hermione questioned hopefully.</p>
<p>Sirius chuckled, “Yes, but don’t touch the books yet. Remus and I haven’t finished inventorying the books that might take your flesh off or sap your magical core.” He pointed towards a curtained section of the wall ahead. “Try not to be too loud or it’ll set off my mother’s portrait.”</p>
<p>“Silencing charm not work?” Ron asked as they began to climb the stairs. Hermione almost started at the sound of the boy behind her. She was so excited to see the books Sirius had located for her, that she had completely forgotten about the redhead. Apparently, she hadn’t lost the over-eagerness for knowledge she was known for those first few weeks at Hogwarts like she thought she might have.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, no. Silencing charms, trying to remove her from the wall… I’ve even tried burning the portrait but she’s there and she’s opinionated - blood purist scum that she was in life continues on in death” They climbed two flights of stairs before Sirius paused in front of an open door. “Looks like Ginny found it already. This is your and her’s, Hermione. Library is down the hall at the end.” He winked at her, “There’s a pile under the desk that might be of interest to you.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The library was not quite the size of the Hogwarts one, but it still made Hermione’s breath go shallow and her mouth drop open. It was like that Muggle film she had seen before ever learning about the magical world - <em> Beauty and the Beast </em>. She remembered coming home from the film thinking what she would give for a library like that - somewhere where she could be with her friends that never teased or taunted her for being too much of a know-it-all or a swot, somewhere where she felt safe and most like herself. She knew she would always be someone who thirsted for knowledge - she had been a curious and precocious child for as long as she could remember and even before that if her parents’ stories about her toddlerhood held any truth.</p>
<p>Despite only being one floor, the shelves seemed to stretch infinitely upward on three sides of the room, unbroken except for a small fireplace. The fourth wall was windows and window seats partially hidden by thick green velvet curtains. The floor of some medium-color wood held stacks of tomes scattered throughout the room, though the majority were concentrated by the blanket-draped couch and the massive desk. If the room wasn’t so large the desk would have overwhelmed the room. Instead, it looked like it fit exactly, matching the two wooden sliding ladders that stood on either side of the room.</p>
<p>Hermione wanted to run her hands over the spines of the dusty books as if she could absorb their knowledge purely by osmosis. But right as her fingertips went out to the nearest shelf she remembered Sirius’ warning and stopped. Her eyes passed over titles that reminded her that though the Black ancestors may have loved knowledge, not all of it was safe for her to partake in - at least not yet. <em> Skinning Your Enemies Alive - Wandlessly! </em> and <em> Why Muggles Have No Reason to Continue Existing </em>were just two of the ones that Hermione had absolutely no desire to touch.</p>
<p>Finally, Hermione made her way over to the desk littered with parchment, stray quills, and what looked like chocolate wrappers (Professor Lupin’s no doubt). She pulled the pile of books from under the desk, pausing in confusion when she saw the title of the top one: <em> Witch Weekly, Vol. 1 to 100 </em> . She opened it and found a witch in a dress that would look more at home in Versailles with Marie Antoinette than in the 1990s. Flicking through she was disappointed to find every single page filled with <em> Witch Weekly </em> issues rather than anything to do with Transfiguration or becoming an animagus. Glancing at the stack, Hermione noted every single book like the topmost one.</p>
<p>She flopped on the couch with a huff. “How in the world are <em> these </em> supposed to help me?” She heard a chuckle behind her and whipped her head behind her to see Sirius standing with a smirk.</p>
<p>“Not a fan of <em> Witch Weekly </em>, Hermione?”</p>
<p>“Not particularly. Too,” Hermione scrunched up her nose, “girly. Gossiping about the most eligible bachelor and how to woo the wizard of your choice, please. The recipes are occasionally interesting, but I’d much rather read <em> Transfiguration Today </em> or <em> Charmed Monthly </em>.”</p>
<p>Sirius’ chuckle turned into a full laugh as he walked towards her. “Well then, good thing these aren’t actually a tabloid.”</p>
<p>“But they…”</p>
<p>“Place your hand on the cover and say, ‘I solemnly swear I am up to no good.’”</p>
<p>“Seriously?” Hermione raised an eyebrow at the older man.</p>
<p>“That I am. Just trust me.”</p>
<p>Hermione rolled her eyes at the pun and did as she was told. While the cover stayed the same when she flipped through the book she noticed it had transformed to be a text about the animagus process. “How did you do that?”</p>
<p>“Some tinkering with some illusion charms and then keying it to your magical signature, which you just did. Anyone who looks over your shoulder will just see <em> Witch Weekly </em> issues. You’ll see the books about becoming an animagus. And should you actually want hair-taming advice, you could read it as <em> Witch Weekly </em> by not saying the passcode.”</p>
<p>“How can it be two texts at once? The laws of physics say you can’t…”</p>
<p>Sirius brushed off her questions with a wave of his hand. “Putting your hand back on the cover and saying, ‘Mischief Managed,’ will turn it back.” He paused, and Hermione had the distinct impression she was being surveyed. “You do promise you’ll be careful?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sirius. Honestly! In all Harry’s told you, what makes you think that I would be reckless?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know, maybe using a Time-Turner illegally and breaking a convicted mass murderer out of a cell or wolf-calling on the night when a werewolf is loose on Hogwarts grounds?” Sirius said dryly.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Hermione was curled up on the couch in the library a few days later, a worn blanket draped over her feet, a steaming mug of tea in her hand, and one of the Transfiguration texts on her lap when someone came in muttering about “that bloody mutt.” She turned to find her former Defense professor running his hands through his sandy hair and shaking his head. “Professor?”</p>
<p>Remus jumped. “Hermione! I didn’t know you were in here. I thought you were…” He searched for an activity.</p>
<p>“Dusting the parlour?” She suggested, rolling her eyes. “Apparently, neither Ron nor I can do it correctly. Molly sent us off to find something else to do. I think she’s getting a bit sick of us, to be honest.”</p>
<p>“And Ron is…”</p>
<p>“Mooning over his Chudley Cannons probably,” Hermione said with a snort. “Honestly, that boy is obsessed with them.”</p>
<p>Remus smiled. “We all have to have our own obsessions. And apparently, your’s is currently…” he looked at the book she was reading, “<em> Witch Weekly </em>?”</p>
<p>“It’s actually a Transfiguration book. Sirius’ transformed it for me so nobody would know what I was reading about.”</p>
<p>“And <em> Witch Weekly </em> won’t arise suspicion?”</p>
<p>“Well, less suspicion than books about becoming an animagus,” Hermione said bluntly, sipping her tea.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, that it would be.” Remus paused, “I just came in here to grab some papers from Sirius’ desk and get back to our meeting with Dumbledore.”</p>
<p>“Don’t let me keep you.”</p>
<p>Remus gathered the papers and was just about to leave when he turned. “Did you say animagus?”</p>
<p>Hermione chuckled. “Yes, dear. Going to see if I’m the big bad wolf or just a kitten.” She hadn’t realized the words were out of her mouth until she saw Remus’ shocked expression and a flush rise into his cheeks. Apparently, she had gotten sassy.</p>
<p>“Right then, enjoy your reading Hermione,” Remus nodded at her before leaving her to a chapter on visualization.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>She couldn’t sleep. Her mind would not quiet, racing with thoughts of Voldemort’s return, Harry’s future fight, her role in it, and the risk involved. It didn’t help that it was an abnormally hot night in Islington and even in skimpy shorts and a tank top she felt as if the air was choking her, slowly draining the life and will out of her body. Perhaps it wasn’t that extreme, but after Ginny groaned at her, “Hermione, you’ve been tossing and turning for the past two hours. Either go to bloody sleep or get out of the room,” Hermione decided it was just that bad.</p>
<p>She slipped out of their room with a book from her nightstand tucked under her arm, closing the door quietly. She thought about going to the library but the room was filled with heavy fabrics and rugs and the thought of all surrounding the steaming air was enough to make her pass that door and head straight down to the basement kitchen. As Hermione filled a glass of water, gulping it greedily, it was then she noticed Sirius, asleep at the large table.</p>
<p>Not wanting to disturb him, she hopped up on the counter to sit while she waited to cool down. Hermione took the opportunity to observe him. His Azkaban tattoo and what looked to be a fresh one stood out against the pale skin on his arm. She could just make out what looked to be a deer, a stag, a wolf, and a dog all looking up at a bright moon. His short hair was clean and damp, although from sweat or from recently showering Hermione didn’t know. She sat there for some time, just watching him, lost in her own thoughts of how she too had lost people precious to her. Perhaps they had more in common than she thought.</p>
<p>As if he could tell he was being watched, Sirius jerked awake, looking around with wide eyes before settling on Hermione. “Hermione,” he coughed, “everything all right?”</p>
<p>“Other than it’s hotter than Merlin’s balls in our room? Yes, everything’s fine.”</p>
<p>Sirius snorted, “Don’t let Molly hear you talking like that.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, I can be the perfect genteel witch when I need to be. Just not when it’s this bleeding hot,” Hermione huffed.</p>
<p>“And yet, you’ve got goosebumps.” He pointed out. “Guess my cooling charms worked?”</p>
<p>Hermione looked down at her arms at the small gooseflesh that had appeared. “Yes, I guess they did. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t do it for you, love.”</p>
<p>Hermione ignored the endearment and the tease. “When did you get that one?”</p>
<p>Sirius looked down at the tattoo with a faint smile. “Last week. Snuck out as Padfoot, went to a Muggle tattoo parlour.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know Lily was an Animagus too.”</p>
<p>“She wasn’t,” Sirius traced the doe with a finger, “It was her Patronus. And she became as much a part of the Marauders as Remus, James, and I were. We were such a force to be reckoned with sometimes. Lily with her spirit, Remus with his logic, James…” He paused. “They were everything.”</p>
<p>“Tell me about them,” Hermione said gently, placing a hand on his arm. And so he did.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Hermione thought back to that night - she had really enjoyed chatting with Sirius. He was an engaging wizard, and she was pleasantly surprised to find more than the drama queen he sometimes appeared to be. In truth, his mind was quick, and as the night wore on, the stories he shared not only were illuminating about Harry’s parents but also showed her a side of him that she found unusually compelling. Not only that, but he seemed genuinely interested in her thoughts and stories, and rather than shying away from her when he didn’t know something, he summoned a book and helped her get an answer that had eluded her earlier that day. They had quickly settled into a routine sitting together at night, sometimes in the kitchen, sometimes in the library, swapping stories. Hermione found herself laughing more than she had in months, but she also found herself yawning more too.</p>
<p>“Harry comes today!” Sirius chirped at Hermione as he bounded into the library. “I’ll get to see my godson!”</p>
<p>Hermione smiled at her friend. “Excited much?”</p>
<p>“If I can’t get out of this godforsaken house at least I’ll have him to help keep me company.”</p>
<p>“What am I? Chopped liver?”</p>
<p>“Dogs <em> like </em> chopped liver, kitten.” Sirius walked over to the couch, squatting down beside her. “I’m sorry. It’s just I promised James I would teach him everything.”</p>
<p>“I understand,” Hermione yawned.</p>
<p>“Someone been keeping you up, Miss Granger?”</p>
<p>“Some dog has been yapping in my ear every night,” she teased with another yawn.</p>
<p>Sirius pulled a thick forest green quilt over her and took the book from her, closing it with a bookmark. “Sleep, kitten. I’ll wake you up when Harry gets in.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Sirius.”</p>
<p>It turned out she didn’t need Sirius to wake her up - she woke up to a slamming door and Harry screaming at Ron. Sirius’ mother started just a few seconds later. Hermione groaned, stretching. This reunion was not going to go as planned.</p>
<p>“And where were you? Why didn’t you write?” Harry leveled at her when she entered his and Ron’s room.</p>
<p>“I did! You weren’t responding and Sirius said to give you a break. Said you wouldn’t like being pushed.”</p>
<p>“Oh, and now you’re talking to Sirius about me!”</p>
<p>“Harry, calm down, we’re just concerned about you… after Cedric and Voldemort coming back, you shut down. I asked Sirius for advice on how to get you to open up.” Hermione tried.</p>
<p>“You had no right!”</p>
<p>“I had every right when one of my best friends is struggling and I don’t know how to help him!”</p>
<p>“You could have helped me by telling me what is going on in the Wizarding World. Tell me what Voldemort is up to!”</p>
<p>“And you think that’s the best thing to put in a letter that could be intercepted?”</p>
<p>“Hermione, we could have given him some of what we knew,” Ron interjected.</p>
<p>“Professor Dumbledore asked us not to!” she snapped, quickly losing her patience.</p>
<p>“Oh, well, if Dumbledore asked you to, then we can forget that I saved you from a troll in our first year.”</p>
<p>“Harry, mate, that’s a bit…” </p>
<p>“NO!” Harry exploded. “This is my fight and nobody seems to want me to prepare for the fight!”</p>
<p>“Well, if you’re going to be like this, I don’t see the point in continuing this conversation! Some of us have given up <em> everything </em> to help you, to protect you, and you can’t seem to wrap your head around that and to be grateful. No, instead you lash out like a petulant child!” Hermione threw up her arms and rolled her eyes. “I’ll be in the parlor if you come to your senses.” She slammed the door behind her, almost stomping down the stairs in frustration. A hand wrapped around her upper arm stopping her progress.</p>
<p>“Hermione, are you okay?” Sirius gently released her arm. He could practically see the magic crackling and fizzing in her rambunctious hair. She reminded him of Lily - her hair would stand on end when her magic acted out during periods of strong emotions.</p>
<p>“Your godson is a complete and utter arse.” Hermione realized who she was speaking to and stopped short. “I’m sorry, Sirius. He’s lashing out just like you predicted.”</p>
<p> Sirius sighed. “I didn’t want this to be an ‘I told you so’ moment.”</p>
<p>“I know.” She deflated. “I just wish I could smack some reason into him.”</p>
<p>“The number of times Lily wanted to do that to James...well, let’s just say her hand would have been permanently red from all that slapping.” He chuckled at the memory. “Give him some time, love. He’ll come around.”</p>
<p>“And if he doesn’t?”</p>
<p>“He will. But, if he doesn’t, maybe Padfoot needs to sit on him.” Hermione couldn’t help but laugh at that.</p>
<p> ***</p>
<p>They were sitting in the library that night, not talking but each enjoying a book and the other’s presence when Hermione slammed her book shut and jumped up. Sirius looked up surprised. “What?”</p>
<p> “I’m sick of this house.”</p>
<p> “Yes, and?”</p>
<p>“Short of some repainting charms which I want to try out but probably shouldn’t do at 3 am, I only see one solution.”</p>
<p>“Which is?” Sirius raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Let’s go for a walk. You and me - along the river. I’m not a prisoner and neither should you be!”</p>
<p>“Just a girl and her dog then?” Sirius asked hopefully as he put his own book aside and stood up.</p>
<p>“No,” Hermione smirked, “a girl and her friend. Dumbledore can go fuck himself.” She summoned a sweater to ward against the early morning chill.</p>
<p>Sirius clucked his tongue, “There you go again with that language.”</p>
<p>“Like you’re going to tell anyone,” she scoffed.</p>
<p>“Who knows, I may tell Kreacher. Make him hate you even more.”</p>
<p>“One of these days you’re going to treat him like he’s more than just a slave.”</p>
<p>“And he’ll die of shock,” Sirius stopped with his hand on the doorknob. “Are you sure about this?”</p>
<p>“It’s a walk at 3 am along the water. What non-Muggle, or Muggle for that matter, is going to be out and about and recognize you?”</p>
<p>“I meant that you want to go for a walk instead of...I don’t know, sleep?”</p>
<p>“Gives me an excuse to get out of the cleaning tomorrow.”</p>
<p>With a shrug, Sirius opened the door and they left into the night. There was a breeze and the trees rustled by it were one of the only noises on Grimmauld Place. Nobody - wizard, muggle, dog, cat - was out, though that didn’t surprise Hermione, this was a quiet neighborhood, to begin with. “I can see why your parents chose this neighborhood - it’s very quiet. Nobody would question their comings and goings.”</p>
<p>“Actually, the family legend is that one of my ancestors - Cygnus - liked his scotch a little too much. This area used to have a lot of pubs and he didn’t want to be far from them. He convinced a Muggle family to ‘gift’ it to him - my guess is Imperius or something similar - and the house has been in my family ever since.”</p>
<p>“How long did it take you to find all the secret passageways to escape without being noticed?”</p>
<p>Sirius scrunched up his face in thought, “I think I was seven? There’s really only two. The former servant’s back staircase and the very rusty, practically falling apart fire escape from the attic. Dear old Mum blocked that one off after Regulus followed me out onto it when he was… oh, I think he was eight at the time… and he fell and broke his collarbone.” They turned a corner before meeting the river path. “What about your childhood? You don’t seem to talk about it a lot.”</p>
<p>“I could say the same of you,” Hermione deflected.</p>
<p>“Well yes,” Sirius said, running a hand over his face. “But I had a miserable childhood by all accounts, wouldn’t you say? Never really knew life could be better until I met James and Remus and…” Peter Pettigrew’s name hung unsaid in the air. “Harry said your parents are dentists?”</p>
<p>Sirius noted the way Hermione closed her eyes and took a deep breath like she was steeling herself for an answer she didn’t want to give. “It’s okay if you don’t want to talk about it,” he offered. “What do you want to talk about instead?”</p>
<p>Hermione was grateful Sirius hadn’t pushed her. That was a secret nobody knew - not even Harry or Ron. When she had asked to stay with the Weasley’s that summer she was happy when Mrs. Weasley had let it go after her explanation that her parents had won a round-the-world cruise and wouldn’t be back until she returned to Hogwarts. She knew she should tell someone but it didn’t feel right yet. It felt too new. So instead she asked a question about the visualization step to finding her animagus form and as Sirius began his explanation she found herself relaxing. She was safe. They were safe. It would be okay.</p>
<p>“Hermione, we’re going to getting close to Kings Cross soon. We should probably head back.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” she yawned. “Probably. I should probably get some sleep too.”</p>
<p>“Have you been actually going to sleep for a few hours before coming to the library?”</p>
<p>“Have you?” Hermione challenged.</p>
<p>“No, but I’m also not fifteen.”</p>
<p>“Sixteen - my use of the time turner meant in one year I aged two years. Technically, I’ll be of age this September.”</p>
<p>He rolled his eyes. “Okay fine, 16. But you should be getting more than what...four hours of sleep a night?”</p>
<p>She shrugged. “It will be good practice for when we go back to Hogwarts and have to start studying for our OWLs.”</p>
<p>“Somehow I don’t think that’s the reason. I’m pretty sure you could ace them in your sleep.”</p>
<p>It’s true, it wasn’t the reason. She had been having terrible nightmares coupled with nighttime anxiety over what had happened at the beginning of the summer. They hadn’t started immediately - they seemed to have really taken off after Mrs. Weasley’s mandated cleaning and purges of the house. But they were enough that sleep was only really restful if she was exhausted. Instead of laying awake or tossing and turning, she had found a solution in Sirius. “Maybe,” she admitted. “But even if it’s not the real reason, it’s a good enough excuse.”</p>
<p>Taking her completely by surprise, Sirius stopped and wrapped her up in a hug. Holding her at arm’s length he looked at her. “I don’t know what’s going on, and you don’t have to tell me, but I consider us friends, and so I just want you to know, we can continue our library chats for as long as you’re here. But maybe not tomorrow,” Sirius said releasing her and slipping an arm through her’s. “Cause you look like you’re about to keel over.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Sirius. Harry’s lucky to have you, you know?”</p>
<p>“Harry’s got nothing to do with this.”</p>
