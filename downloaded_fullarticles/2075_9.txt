    <p>Writing full length fics isn't really getting anywhere, so I decided to write this. It's a way of saying thank you to all the people who read my stuff and who gave me incredibly useful feedback and to save myself from fretting over what to write. You can leave a comment or message me with the character you'd like and the theme of the oneshot.</p><p>The characters I'll write are:</p><p>Sherlock Holmes</p><p>John Watson</p><p>Greg Lestrade</p><p>Steve Rogers</p><p>Bucky Barnes</p><p>Phil Coulson</p><p>Natasha Romanoff</p><p>Clint Barton</p><p>Kevin Ryan</p><p>Christopher Tietjens</p><p>Benedict Cumberbatch</p><p>Remus Lupin</p><p>Â </p><p>If there's a character you want a oneshot of who's not on the list, I might make the exception if I know who they are and feel able to write their character and do it justice. Any oneshot can be inspired by a song, a movie line, a photo or just an idea that occurred to you. Or from the "all of the prompts" blog on tumblr.  </p><p>Again, this is my way of saying thank you to those of you who've read my stuff in the past and made my writing what it is today. I'm so grateful to anybody who takes the time to read my stuff and comments just make my day, so thank you so much. </p><p>I look forwards to hearing from you.</p>
