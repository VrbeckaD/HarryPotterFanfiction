    <p>I sat with my legs swinging underneath me. I looked up at the night stars and grip onto one of the pillars of the bridge. I then looked down at the lake below me to see the gleaming reflection of the stars. Sighing, I let go of the pillar and stood up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> "(y/n), what are you doing." </p>
<p> </p>
<p>tears were now streaming down my face. "Why does it matter?" I say after some time. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He steps forward, reaching toward me, before saying, "What are you talking about? (y/n) what are you doing, you aren't in your right mind,"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Ha, right mind... do I even have one, I don't know anymore." I look down at my exposed arms, "These scars tell different stories. All the wrongdoings, all the mistakes, all the bad times, all the things I did wrong. The first one I always mark first is still being alive..." I turned toward the voice of my longtime friend and crush, Sirius. My vision was now distorted but the tears streaking down his face were as clear as day. 'Look at what you did (y/n), why don't you just fall!' I wavered slightly on my feet making Sirius gasp and try to reach for me but I placed one foot behind me to escape him. He stops immediately but looked at me helplessly. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Please (y/n), listen to what I have to say, at least..." </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I turned back around to stop seeing his pleading face and stared at the moon, which was full, "The moon is rising fast Sirius, you should go help Prongs, Wormtail, and Moony..." I said back to him.<br/>"We need you, too, (your-marauder-name)," Sirius spoke softly. My tears fell faster as he spoke his last sentence, "We need you, you keep us out of trouble..." </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"What an amazing job I've done. Ha, you would do better off without me... Say goodbye to them for me. Oh and Sirius," I turned fully to him with a watery smile, "thank you." I took a step back and fell with my arms outstretched. Before I crashed into the lake below, I saw Sirius take a dive towards me, wand out. Right before I crashed into the blackness of the lake, I felt a hand take mine and I was flying just above the water. I was pulled up and held very closely by a hysterical Sirius. After a moment I started sobbing into Sirius' already shaking shoulder, and we both held each other tightly. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I'll help you through this, we can get through this together" Sirius whispered into my ear as I fell into sleep.</p>
