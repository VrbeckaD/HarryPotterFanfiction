Part 1<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>It was a full moon night, and the forest glowed brightly under the white light. There was nowhere to hide, so all Credence could do was run, run as fast as his exhausted body allowed him to. He could hear the laughing of the three boys that chased after him getting closer with every step he took, and didn't know how much longer he would be able to run.  </p><p> </p><p>“If you keep going much further, a beast of the forest might find you before we do, Barebone!” Yelled one of the boys at him.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, it would tear the skin out of your pathetic bones!”</p><p> </p><p>He heard them roar with laughter and howl in the night to frighten him, but Credence clutched the bread loaf he had stolen tightly underneath his jacket and kept running. Maybe if he went a bit deeper into the forest they would get scared and let him go. With that thought in mind he sprinted towards the darkest part of the forest, but right when he was crossing a clear, the sole of one of his worn out boots bent and splinted right under his foot, making him misstep and fall face first on the grass.</p><p> </p><p>Before he even realized what had happened he felt the thud of one of the boys tackling him down and immobilizing him.</p><p> </p><p>“Gotcha, Barebone… you're so gonna regret this…” He said triumphantly.</p><p> </p><p>The other boys caught up almost immediately and Credence found himself surrounded and unable to even move. He tried to protect the bread with both arms, curling up, but they wrestled it out of his hands.</p><p> </p><p>“Please… you know I’m hungry, please!” He cried, struggling with all his force to try and get rid of them to snatch his food back.</p><p> </p><p>The tallest of the boys landed a fist right on one of his eyes, blinding him with pain.</p><p> </p><p>“This is the third time you take food from my father's stall, so he gave me permission to  dissuade you from ever stealing again, with as much force as I need…” He said with a smirk, and rolled up his shirt sleeves. The two other boys kept Credence down, holding his arms and legs still while he beat him senseless.</p><p> </p><p>Credence’s cries and pleas filled the night, until all strength left him and he was reduced to a whimpering mess.</p><p> </p><p>“Do we break his legs so he can never run again?” Asked then one of the boys.</p><p> </p><p>The oldest one seemed to be considering that suggestion, but he had another idea.</p><p> </p><p>“I say we rape him, that’d be much more humiliating, so he won't go telling people about it, right, Barebone?”</p><p> </p><p>They laughed at the terrified look on Credence's bloodied face, and began deciding who would be the one to go first.</p><p> </p><p>Credence didn't know exactly what a rape was, but from the stories he’d heard at the church he knew it was a tremendously painful and degrading thing, so he was going to have to try to escape somehow.</p><p>The three boys were so caught up in their argument that they left Credence unattended long enough for the boy to drag himself away from them. He wouldn't be able to stand, but not far from them there was a very distinct arrange of white rocks and lilies scattered on the center of the clear. He’d heard about fairy rings on fantasy tales and hoped with all his heart that for once the legends would end up being true, meaning that maybe a Fae could appear out of nowhere and relieve him from his misery.</p><p> </p><p>“Just where do you think you're going, Barebone?”</p><p> </p><p>His chasers followed him up the slight hill at the center of the clearing, not realising where they were walking into, and surrounded him again.</p><p> </p><p>“Please, please, please…” muttered Credence under his breath, as he felt their hands tearing his ragged clothes off.</p><p> </p><p>And then, almost as if he'd been chanting a spell, a magic shower fell over them out of nowhere, piercing his aggressors with drops of light and killing them all instantly.</p><p>Credence gasped with terror, but somehow their bodies had protected him against the rain of lights, saving his life.  </p><p>He could not believe his luck.</p><p> </p><p>With trembling hands he struggled to get rid of the corpses and sit, still too shaken and weakened to properly stand, Credence simply looked around. Then, a pair of lean figures emerged from the dark, they each carried beautiful golden bows and walked under the moonlight towards him so graciously that for an instant it almost seemed as if they glided above the ground. Credence stared open mouthed, unable to react, and he didn’t even feel the pain anymore, just awe before those handsome creatures of the forest.</p><p> </p><p>The tallest of them raised his bow, and from the tip of his fingers emerged an arrow made of light, that he pointed at Credence’s face, ready to strike.</p><p> </p><p>“Brother wait!”</p><p> </p><p>The man that looked youngest walked past him and knelt besides the injured boy, protecting him.</p><p> </p><p>“Move aside, Newt… we can’t let humans roam these forests” Warned the older brother with a menacing grin.</p><p> </p><p>But the creature didn’t move, he even leaned closer, inspecting Credence with timid fascination. Credence observed him as well, he’d never seen a man so beautiful ever before. His fair skin was covered in a dust of freckles, like stars in the night sky, his hair almost glowed as fire, and his green eyes were full of curiosity, lighting up his childish features.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re hurt…” He said with a sad tone at last.</p><p> </p><p>“We can take him out of his misery, step aside Newt.”</p><p> </p><p>Credence was sure none of what he was seeing was real, it had to be some kind of dream. He sat there without tearing his eyes away from the boy named Newt, he was absolutely breathtaking and if he was about to die, he wouldn’t mind taking a lovely memory to the afterlife with him. But the strike never came.</p><p> </p><p>“He is different, Theseus.” Said the boy, he kept staring deep into Credence’s eyes, as if he’d never seen something like him. “I say we take him to Grindelwald and let him decide.”</p><p> </p><p>After a moment’s hesitation, Theseus finally lowered his bow, silently agreeing to his brother’s idea.</p><p> </p><p>“Come with us, we’ll let you live.” Newt tried to help Credence stand, holding him with gentle and warm hands, but the effort turned out to be too great for the broken boy and he fell unconscious in his arms.</p><p><br/>

<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Credence woke up to the gentle rub of a soft cloth against his face, it was wet and felt nice on his swollen cheekbone. He had to turn his head to look at whomever was taking care of him to see them with his good eye.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello, there… glad to see you awake again.”</p><p> </p><p>Greeted him the red haired fae boy from the clearing with the first smile Credence had seen in weeks. His eyes filled with tears at seeing him, because he was sure that the whole thing had to had been a dream, why would the fae forgive him after walking into one of their death rings?</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, it’s okay, there’s no need for crying…” Cooed the young boy as he wiped Credence’s tears.</p><p> </p><p>Credence felt absolutely bewildered, he had been perfectly ready to die so surviving was not something he felt prepared for.</p><p> </p><p>He tried to sit and look around to grasp at his surroundings at least. They were alone at some woden chamber, lying on top of a thick and soft mantle made of green moss, curiously sprinkled with tiny mushrooms and wildflowers… how was that even possible? Also what he thought to be wooden panels were more like untreated wood, natural and uncut, a whole circular room carved from a single tree? And the lights that seemed to float above their heads were in fact living fireflies, dancing all around.  </p><p> </p><p>“It’s normal for you to be disoriented at first, but you’re safe now, we’re not going to hurt you.”</p><p> </p><p>Credence focused his attention back on the young fae named Newt.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought… I thought you were supposed to kill humans… like me…” He whispered cautiously.</p><p> </p><p>Newt’s smile vanished from his pretty face at those words.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, normally yes… but as I said before at the clearing, I think you’re different” He replied tilting his head slightly as he resumed cleaning Credence’s face with the humid cloth. “We’re having a meeting to decide what to do with you in just a moment, we were waiting for you to wake up…”</p><p> </p><p>At that moment a curtain rustled behind them and the other fae he’d seen entered the chamber.</p><p> </p><p>“Is he awake already? Good, bring him to the hearth, Newt.” He ordered, then he turned and left.</p><p> </p><p>Newt offered Credence a reassuring smile as he helped him up from the mossy floor.</p><p> </p><p>“We better not make them wait much longer.”</p><p> </p><p>They walked out through the leaves curtain and up a narrow wooden staircase, Credence had a bit of trouble with the steps but Newt helped him climb holding him closely. At the upper floor Credence could barely hide his wonder at the sight of another beautiful room again carved out of the interior of a tree, although without the moss blanket this time, and with a real crackling fire in the middle of it. Somehow the fire burned lively and warm, but did not damage the wood of the floor, it just floated there in the center. Around it and arranged in a circle stood several chairs made of the same white stones he’d seen at the forest, and seated in them awaited the three other fae. Newt’s brother was the closest to them, but across the fire Credence saw an older man with dark greying hair, and next to him in a much bigger chair, another man with the strangest pair of mismatched blue eyes he’d ever seen.</p><p> </p><p>The three men observed in silence as Newt led Credence to his own chair and invited him to sit there, while he brought a small stool for himself and sat right next to him.</p><p> </p><p>Credence couldn’t help looking back at the blue eyed man, he had white blond hair but did not seem too old, he was strangely attractive and had a whimsical air around him. His different colored eyes pierced him and he had to look away, so he observed the man next to him, he was also very handsome and looked much more mature than Newt and his brother, but somehow he had a slightly more human aura, which gave Credence certain comfort.</p><p> </p><p>“So, we can’t deny that there’s something different about this human…” Began the blond fae, catching credence’s attention once more and gifting him with a mysterious smile. “But we can’t force him to join us if he doesn’t want to, we should at least ask what he thinks of your idea, Newt.”</p><p> </p><p>He looked around at the rest of the fae as if waiting for their opinion.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, we wouldn't be giving him much of a choice, if he rather go back with the humans he won't last for long with the kind of injuries he’s sustained…” Explained Theseus, without a hint of a smile on his handsome features.</p><p> </p><p>At that, the dark haired man chuckled and pointed out:</p><p> </p><p>“Why would anyone rather live among humans? They're barbarians.”</p><p> </p><p>“We should at least give him the option to walk away, he might not want to be involved with us.” Replied Newt.</p><p> </p><p>The blond man raised a hand to silence the others and looked directly at Credence.</p><p> </p><p>“We could at least explain, because I fear our young human is very much ready to faint again..” He said with a smirk, and then he winked an eye at him.</p><p> </p><p>Credence felt himself blushing harder than ever, everyone seemed to be looking at him.</p><p> </p><p>“What's your name, human?” Asked the dark haired man with a softer tone, trying not to sound intimidating.</p><p> </p><p>“Cre… Credence.” He said timidly.</p><p> </p><p>“Allow me to introduce ourselves, my name is Percival Graves, Gellert Grindelwald is our leader, and I think you already met Theseus and Newt Scamander.” Said the man, signaling with his hand as he introduced the others. “We are all that's left of the Fae in this forest.”</p><p> </p><p>“All thanks to you, humans, only caring about yourselves and destroying everything around you…” Spat suddenly Theseus, but he did not look at Credence when he said it.</p><p> </p><p>The mood in the room hardened considerably and Newt had to reprimand his older brother:</p><p> </p><p>“Thes, you're not helping…”</p><p> </p><p>“Indeed, but don’t misunderstand us Credence, we don’t want to cause you any harm.” Grindelwald tried to lighten the mood again with his gentle tone, catching Credence’s attention once more. “When Newt saw you in the circle, he noticed that your heart was pure and decided to spare your life. We brought you here tonight to offer you a deal: we want to change your human nature and let you live amongst us as a fae, thus healing your wounds and teaching you all of our secrets.”</p><p> </p><p>Gellert did not smile or wink now, he looked straight into Credence’s eyes as the boy thought about the words he’d just heard.</p><p> </p><p>“Why… why would you want to help a h-human?” Asked Credence.</p><p> </p><p>But this time it was Percival Graves the one to answer:</p><p> </p><p>“As Gellert said, we are all that’s left of our race here, we’re unable to procreate but we refuse to move to the northern mountains… So Newt thinks he might have found a way of perpetuate this clan, by creating a bearer, someone able to conceive.”</p><p> </p><p>Credence’s heart began beating much faster at that, and it hurt his rib cage just to breathe. Did they mean what he thought they meant?</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not a girl…” He noted.</p><p> </p><p>“We don’t need you to be a girl, the magic spell will take care of the physical barriers, we just need someone pure and righteous…” Newt reached out to hold Credence’s hand in his, reassuringly, and looked at him sincerely. “Your heart is not filled with hatred as most humans’ are, it will allow our magic to change your nature and give it a better shape, you’ll be one of us for the rest of your life, helping us to expand our clan.”</p><p> </p><p>Everyone was still looking at Credence, and he could actually feel Grindelwald’s eyes reading his very thoughts. Were they waiting for him to give an answer? Did he really have a choice in the matter?</p><p> </p><p>“What if I refuse...?” He couldn't look at any of them when he spoke.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll be free to go, although we wouldn’t be able to heal any of your injuries and you’d probably suffer a slow and painful death, considering the current knowledge of your human doctors.” Said Gellert.</p><p> </p><p>The more they tried to explain things to Credence, the clearer it seemed to him that there was not much of a choice really. His head swarmed with questions he did not dare ask. Why couldn’t they heal him and let him go? Why didn’t they have any fae girls to help them reproduce anymore? And why would they choose him? He had absolutely nothing to offer them that he knew of…  Wouldn’t it be just easier to move to the mountains and find other fae? Because there were other fae, right?</p><p> </p><p>A few minutes passed by, so Newt squeezed Credence’s hand to get his attention.</p><p> </p><p>“We don’t want you to stay because you feel forced to do so, but we really think that you might like living with us, Credence… we are a small and loving family and we’ll make sure you never go hungry or feel alone ever again, you’ll be the most important thing for us…” He whispered with his freckle-splattered lips, looking at him with those beautiful green eyes he had.</p><p> </p><p>Credence didn’t even remember the last time someone talked to him like that, like a friend, or a loving one… it felt so warm and nice that before he even noticed, his head nodded on its own accord. He would have agreed to torture if only they told him it would be given with love.</p><p> </p><p>“Bare in mind that you won’t be able to return with the humans once we use our magic on you, it’s forbidden.” Said Theseus from his seat, he seemed more concerned about Credence than the others.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m… I’m okay with that…”</p><p> </p><p>Credence felt himself shaking slightly, he was somehow not surprised at how easily he would jump at the opportunity to get away from his past, from the church where he grew up as an unwanted orphan, from the hunger and the cold...</p><p> </p><p>“Then if you accept the deal, we must proceed with your healing at once, you need a good rest and something to eat.” Grindelwald stood graciously from his chair, the dark and slightly translucent cloak he wore over his shoulders dragged behind him as he walked up to Credence and Newt. “Take him back to the night chamber and make sure he’s comfortable, Newt.”</p><p> </p><p>Theseus stood too and helped his brother to carry Credence down the stairs again, who could barely walk anymore due to the pain and exhaustion. They gently laid him over the mossy blanket and took off his ragged clothes one by one, carefully minding his fragile body.</p><p> </p><p>Grindelwald walked in not far behind and approached them, kneeling right beside him.</p><p> </p><p>“It won't hurt, but your body might need some time to recover after the healing.” He whispered with his warmest tone, as he caressed the boy’s face gently.</p><p> </p><p>Credence felt himself twitching embarrassed under such a man’s stare, his imperfect body was completely exposed now and he’d never been naked in front of other men like that before.</p><p>Newt took his hand once more to reassure him while Grindelwald recited a healing spell and grazed his bare skin with his palms. The moment his magic started flowing inside him, Credence began feeling surprisingly good all over. His limbs and ribs did not hurt anymore and felt strangely light, his face returned to it's normal appearance and his insides tingled pleasantly, with a gentle sensation of non burning flames.</p><p> </p><p>“Good boy, you're doing so well…” Whispered the man.</p><p> </p><p>Credence could feel the magic increasing in intensity, but it still didn't hurt, if anything he felt too good to be true. He had to close his eyes and press his lips in a tight line to stop himself from moaning aloud. Soon he lost himself to the pleasure and saw stars shooting behind his eyelids, then everything turned white and he fell into a deep and sweet slumber again.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>For a second time Credence awoke at the sight of Newt’s beautiful eyes gazing down at him, only this time he didn't feel like run over by a horse. His whole body felt great, better than ever in his life, and his mind was completely clear.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello there, feeling good?” Asked the young man, helping Credence to sit up straight. “You definitely look better now with your normal face and well rested.”</p><p> </p><p>Credence couldn't help blushing at that, and once more the young fae looked closely at his face, as if fascinated by his mundane beauty.</p><p> </p><p>“Newt, you… you don't need to be always by my side, I don't want to be a burden for you…” Whispered Credence.</p><p> </p><p>Newt’s smile widened at that, he was so close that Credence could feel the warmth radiating from his beautiful skin, and he held one of the boy's hands to bring it to his lips and kiss it delicately.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not a burden I really like you, Credence, thank you for staying with us… we’ll do everything we can to make you feel at home here, I promise.”</p><p> </p><p>Their eyes were so lost on one another that Credence didn't notice how Newt leaned slightly closer, ready to meet his lips in a sweet kiss… when suddenly they were interrupted by the rustling of the curtains behind them.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry to disturb you guys, but our guest needs to eat something if we want him to survive the night…” Said Percival as he entered the room carrying a wooden tray with a delicious meal for Credence.</p><p> </p><p>Newt immediately backed away, leaving room for the tray in front of Credence, who could barely understand what had been about to happen between them. Although when he felt the incredible smell of such a wonderful and steaming stew, he forgot about the rest of the world and began eating as if there was no tomorrow.</p><p>He could barely remember the last time he had a hot meal, much less one as delicious and abundant as that one. When he finally left the bowl back on the tray he realised his face was covered in tears again, and he wiped them off as fast as he could, embarrassed.</p><p> </p><p>“My dear… Theseus will not believe it when I tell him that his rabbit stew made you cry…” Graves chuckled softly, and with a cloth he cleaned the boy's chin were he had rests of stew.</p><p> </p><p>“Don't forget your fruits, Credence…” Said Newt cheerfully, as he brought a smaller bowl full of wild berries. “I collected them especially for you this morning, open up.”</p><p> </p><p>Credence blushed slightly at knowing that detail, but he obediently opened his mouth to receive a fruit on his tongue and eat it eagerly. Newt smiled delighted and gave him a couple more, under Percival's surprised stare.</p><p> </p><p>“I see the two of you are quite intimate already, uh? You’re gonna make the rest of us jealous, Newt…” The man rolled one of the young boy’s red curls between his fingers and then gave it a playful tug. “By the way, Gellert and Theseus are already bathing, hurry up so we can join them.”</p><p> </p><p>“They’re bathing without us? Those bastards...!” Complained Newt as he collected all of the empty bowls and placed them back on the tray.</p><p> </p><p>Credence could not believe they were implying that taking group baths was a normal thing, and at the same time he felt a strong desire to see that with his own eyes, and maybe get the chance to join them. He still could not believe he was surrounded by such perfect and magnificent creatures.</p><p>His heart began pounding a bit faster when they urged him to get up and follow them down the narrow stairs to yet another chamber from their tree house. This time it seemed to be on the ground, there were vines growing along the walls, and all kind of plants surrounding the center, where a wide and shallow pond served as a natural pool, filled with perfectly warm and clear water. There were also a handful of the same fireflies that illuminated the mossy chamber flying above the pond.</p><p> </p><p>“There you are, boys, at last…” Welcomed them the older Scamander brother with a smile.</p><p> </p><p>“We were getting quite cold here already.” Said Gellert too, and noticind the presence of their human guest behind Percival, he smiled widely too. “I’m glad to see Credence seems to be feeling better now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, and the lad is already best friends with Newt, you know?”</p><p> </p><p>Graves and Newt were both taking off their small linen tunics to enter the water too, showing themselves quite shamelessly to Credence’s dismay. Then they helped him  take his tunic off too, and the boy nervously tried to cover his parts with both hands, suddenly feeling very conscious of his own body.</p><p> </p><p>“You don't need to be shy, we already saw you naked yesterday…” Teased him Newt with a smile, amused by the boy's reaction.</p><p> </p><p>“It's not easy for humans to show themselves before strangers, Newt, give him some time.” Percival didn't smile as easily, but winked an eye at Credence when Newt turned to enter the pond.</p><p> </p><p>Theseus and Grindelwald had stopped talking and both looked at the others, politely inviting them to join the bath.</p><p> </p><p>“We are not strangers anymore, this is your family now, Credence.” Said Gellert with a gentle smile. He stretched his arms to welcome Newt right between him and his brother, bringing him to sit on his lap under the water. “All thanks to our little Newton here, now our clan might have a chance to survive…”</p><p> </p><p>Percival held Credence's hand while they entered the water, carefully guiding him to the side where he could sit on a smooth rock at the bottom. Theseus came closer too, and cupping the boy’s face in a hand, he observed his face closely.</p><p> </p><p>“You look so much better now, a bit thin maybe, but healthy enough.” He said.</p><p> </p><p>Credence didn't know if that was meant as a compliment or not but he thanked him quietly.</p><p>He still tried to cover himself underwater, the surface of the pond was so clear that he could see their bodies perfectly well in all their nakedness. Both Percival and Theseus were nicely built, with thick necks and arms, broad chests and bulky pectorals each of them. Very different from him and Newt who were slim and slightly childish still, especially in the crotch, where they could not compare with such men. He furtively glanced towards Grindelwald to see what he was like, but him and Newt were whispering to each other in the furthest corner, and sharing small kisses.</p><p> </p><p>“They're… they're kissing…” Gasped Credence, shocked by such public demonstration of love, right there in front of others. He never imagined the Fae would turn out to be sinful creatures, like humans, like himself.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, we’re a very loving family… don't you humans kiss too?” Said Graves as he sat much closer to Credence now and wrapped and arm loosely around his waist.</p><p> </p><p>“Well...yes… but I mean… they're both men, that's… that's not right.”</p><p> </p><p>Credence felt his heart going mad at the sight of Newt opening his mouth for Gellert, kissing and licking each other much harder now. He had never seen anything so hot in his whole life, not even between a man and a woman, and soon his young cock began prickling with interest. Percival’s skin brushed against his and gave him goosebumps all over his body.</p><p> </p><p>“Gellert, that bitch… he’s doing it here on purpose to test the boy.” Whispered Theseus to Graves with a smirk.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean?” Credence couldn't understand what was going on. Percival and Theseus did not seem offended at all, on the contrary, they were watching too and enjoyed it apparently. He looked down and found that each of their dicks were fully erect already, and suddenly he felt trapped between their perfect bodies and those huge dicks.</p><p> </p><p>“Don't you like what you see, Credence? It's okay if you are curious, there's nothing wrong in loving each other…” Said Graves as he grabbed Credence's hips and pulled him up onto his lap.</p><p> </p><p>Credence began shaking slightly at that, he did not dare get up and run away from there, and deep down he wasn't so sure he wanted to, because the sight was still too interesting to ignore. Newt had now both arms wrapped around Gellert's neck and rocked his ass gently over the man's lap in a hypnotizing dance. They were not kissing anymore, instead they seemed to be breathing on each other scent, gasping softly for air.</p><p>He had absolutely no idea of what they were doing, but it sure looked nice… his own cock was painfully hard now and throbbed for attentions. Behind his lower back he could feel Percival's member rubbing against his skin too and Credence did not dislike that at all.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course you do, boy… look at you all turned on by my little brother…” Teased him Theseus, and to Credence's surprise, he slipped a hand down his belly and held his dick gently, massaging the head between his fingers.</p><p> </p><p>Percival did not want to miss the opportunity of touching a human for the first time too, so he brought his hand between his legs and grabbed the boy’s balls to massage them delicately.</p><p> </p><p>“T-this… this feels… a bit s-strange…” Whispered Credence, not knowing exactly if he wanted them to stop or not.</p><p> </p><p>Theseus was now jerking his whole member in his fist, slowly building up a steady pace, and leaning closer to him, he kissed Credence’s neck, pressing him against the other man.</p><p>At the other side of the pond Newt was now moaning aloud, as he shook his hips considerably faster over Gellert’s lap. And Credence couldn’t believe what was going on there, he’d never even dreamt about living a situation like that in his whole life.</p><p>His cock was harder than ever, and the way those fae were touching him felt so much better that the few times he had touched himself in his bed, before he even had time to say something he began cumming under the water.</p><p> </p><p>“Aren’t you lovely…?” Complimented him Graves in his ear, as he kissed his jaw too.</p><p> </p><p>Theseus and him had not finished yet, so they kept touching themselves with the boy still lost in his dream-like state between them.</p><p> </p><p>“Can’t wait to fill that cute ass of yours, baby.” Groaned Theseus on his ear, and then licked his earlobe playfully, making Credence shiver all over.</p><p> </p><p>Soon they both climaxed too, and each bent down on the boy’s face and kissed his red lips briefly. But he was still in shock, so couldn’t enjoy himself entirely. Everything had happened so fast from his perspective that he felt too confused to understand what any of it meant. And Theseus’ lasts words still resonated inside his head without making any sense at all.</p><p> </p><p>“Credence… did you like that?” Came Newt’s cheerful voice, suddenly taking him out of his reverie.</p><p>The young fae brought him into a loose hug, and without waiting for an answer he leaned in to steal a kiss from his mouth too.</p><p> </p><p>“Now, now… leave the poor kid alone for a moment, he’s having a hard time getting used to all of this, remember where he comes from.” Stated Grindelwald as he came closer too.</p><p> </p><p>“He looks tired, we better take him back to bed, he may still need some more time to recover completely.” Added Percival.</p><p> </p><p>All of them agreed to get out of the water and go back to the mossy chamber together. Newt held Credence closely while walking up the stairs, and when they reached the room he took him to a corner where they laid on the moss. He wrapped an arm around Credence’s waist and brought him close to his chest, to keep him warm. The other men all took their usual places on the room and laid down to sleep too.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you for forgiving my life back at the clearing… Newt, I don’t know what would have happened to me if you two haven’t appeared there last night…” Said Credence, barely whispering. A couple of tears rolled down his cheeks and onto Newt’s bare chest.
