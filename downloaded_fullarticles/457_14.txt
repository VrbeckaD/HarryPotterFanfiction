    <p align="justify">Another year another ministry ball on the anniversary of final battle. Draco hated these things. As if he needed reminder of the worst time of his life.</p><p align="justify">If it was up to him he would ignore the invitations, but he had his and his family’s reputation to think of. It has been four years since the end of Second Wizarding War but he still felt angry glares and heard scatting remarks whispered behind his back ever so often. If he skipped on celebration for triumphant defeat of Dark Lord, it would prove that those people were right and Malfoys didn’t change their ways. So he had no choice but to come and suffer through the evening.</p><p align="justify">At least there was something, or more accurately someone, who made these gatherings at least bearable - Luna Lovegood. Draco’s eyes found her on the dance floor in the glittering silver dress adorned with so dark green stars that they seemed black. Sometime since the dancing started she lost her shoes and was spinning on her toes barefooted, but it did not bothered her. There also was no dance partner, not that she needed it as she moved her hands and feet to the rhythm of the music only she could hear.</p><p align="justify">At that moment as if Luna felt his gaze on her, she spun around and pinned him with her big soulful eyes and smiled brightly at him. Her movement slowed down, become more sensual, more seductive as she kept their eyes connected. She knew that Draco was thinking about her, she always knew and did everything to keep it that way.</p><p align="justify">Luna was everything he never expected to have. At the first anniversary ball she was the one to come to Draco Malfoy who was having the most miserable time and she thanked him. She waited patiently as he gapped at her in the most un-Malfoy way. When he gathered his jaw from the floor she explained in that airy, dreamy voice of hers that she was grateful that the time she spend captured she spent in his ancestral home. She said that her situation was better than other incarcerated people who were lucky enough to survive the war. Draco couldn’t help himself as he started laughing from incredibility of the situation - person his family kept in the cell of their dungeon was thanking him. How was it possible?</p><p align="justify">Soon his laughter turned into uncontrollable sobs. Luna didn’t hesitate in offering comfort to the ex-death eater.</p><p align="justify">She was different than other people. She saw more than most people and she had no qualm in walking to the beat of her own drum, not giving a damn that other people thought. That night Luna saw a broken boy and gave him the light and warmth he desperately needed to grow into incredible young man. Draco tried to push her away, but she saw straight through it. Luna stayed with him, she listened to him, she understood him, and even though Draco was hesitant at first, falling in love with her was inevitable.</p>
