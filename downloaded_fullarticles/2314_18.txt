    <p>"Draaaaacooooo?!" cooed Pansy.</p><p>She was dressed up in her best lingerie and she was eager to please. Not that it changed the fact that plastic surgery made her look like a torched Barbie Doll.</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>"Draaaaaacoooo? Daaaarliiing~" she purred again.</p><p>Draco was nowhere in sight, but a rather strange noise was coming from the third door on the left.</p><p>"What's that noise?"</p><p>She padded gingerly over to the door. Pansy put her ear against the door and heard... clothing ripping?</p><p>"What the hell?"</p><p>She knocked on the door, but the noise did not cease.</p><p>"Alright, I'm coming in!"</p><p>She tried to turn the knob, but it would not budge.</p><p>"Damnit!"</p><p>She tried again.</p><p>"Shit!"</p><p>And again... until it finally opened and Pansy was fully worked up.</p><p>"Now what in Merlin's name is going on here?!"</p><p>She asked this without actually looking up.</p><p>It sure was a good thing she hadn't, or she would <em>not</em> have liked what she saw.</p><p>"Umm... Pansy?"</p><p>"Draco?!" she squealed.</p><p>She closed her eyes and jumped straight into the bed.</p><p>"I've missed you so much baby, your touch... kisses... mmm..."</p><p>She was about to pull Draco into a kiss when she heard another voice.</p><p>"Pansy? What do you think you're doing?"</p><p>"Hmm? Of course kissing my lovely lollipop...wait a minute!"</p><p>"Is that right?"</p><p>Pansy <em>finally</em><b> </b>looked up and surveyed the scene around her.</p><p>Draco's shirt was ripped and there was a dark haired man beside him.</p><p>Oh, let's not forget to mention that said man was practically naked.</p><p>Pansy shrieked and sprung off the bed.</p><p>"Who the <em>hell</em> are you?!" she shrieked as she pointed a rather blotchy finger at the man.</p><p>"The Golden Boy?"</p><p>"Who?"</p><p>"Draco's Delight."</p><p>"Excuse me?!"</p><p>"Harry Potter.."</p><p>The mans voice was laced with humor as he regarded Pansy.</p><p>"Hmm, Pansy?" interrupted a rather flushed Draco.</p><p>"Yes my love?"</p><p>"Could you please leave?"</p><p>"And why would I do that?!"</p><p>"Because I—"</p><p>"No, no, no, no, back up." <br/>Her face contorted in fury.</p><p>"WHY IS <em>THIS</em> BELLEND IN YOUR BED?!"</p><p>"I invited him. Get the picture now my dear flower?"</p><p>Pansy's mouth opened and closed, no sound escaping.</p><p>"Now wither away!" crooned Harry.<br/>Draco burst into a fit of laughter.</p><p>"I can't believe this!!!"</p><p>She stormed out, an ugly shade of violet as shame riddled her already discolored skin.</p><p>...</p><p>
