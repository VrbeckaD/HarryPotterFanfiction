  <span>SEEING THE GIFT</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mike Stamford wasn't surprised when objects levitated around him, things exploded or the walls of his bedroom changed colour depending on his mood. He was going to be a wizard after all, just like his parents and his big sister.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The thing that </span>
  <em>
    <span>did </span>
  </em>
  <span>surprise him happened one summer day when he was seven years old. He was playing with his Junior Herbology Kit in the back garden, digging into the soil with particular relish, when he heard a voice.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey! Careful where you're putting that thing. You almost had my tail off!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Mike looked around but he was alone. Thinking he was imagining things, he lifted his trowel again and almost brought it down…</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>On a  snake.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Aaargh!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It'sssssss okay.” the reptile reassured him. “I'm not poisonous.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“But you can talk!” Mike squeaked.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“All snakes can talk, but I've never met a wizard who can understand me before.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Wow!” Mike was enthralled. “Have you got a name? My name's Michael.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The snake eyed him curiously.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Snakes don't really have names. That's a human thing.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“So what do your friends call you?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Now the snake looked really confused.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I don't have...look, you can call me whatever you want. I'm a grass snake, I'm utterly harmless, so we can be friends if you want.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Mike beamed. He didn't really have any friends either. His mother taught him at home as she had done for his sister, so interaction with kids his own age had been limited. That was one of the reasons he was desperate to go to Hogwarts.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I'll call you Monty. Can I pick you up?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yesssss. Be careful.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Mike sat on the grass and picked up his new friend who slithered from hand to hand.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Ooh, you're very warm,” hissed Monty happily.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Mike beamed. The snake didn't feel slimy at all. Scaly but not weird and he didn't flinch when Monty wrapped himself around Mike's tiny wrist.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A shadow fell over them and Mike looked up to see his mother standing there. She looked worried.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Look, Mam!” said Mike excitedly. “I found a friend.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Put the snake down, Mikey.” his mother insisted.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It's okay. He's not poisonous and his name's Monty.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Such an imagination you have,” said Mrs Stamford indulgently.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Don't think your mum likesssss me very much,” sighed Monty.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“She doesn't know you yet.” Mike reassured him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Maria Stamford looked in dismay at her son who was hissing and spitting while the serpent on his wrist looked to be </span>
  <em>
    <span>listening to him.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Come on, Mikey. Come and wash your hands. It's nearly dinner time.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Unconcerned by the change in his mother's demeanor, Mike put the snake back on the ground and followed her back into the house. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>In the kitchen he could smell cottage pie bubbling in the oven and hurried up to the bathroom to wash up. Cottage pie was his absolute favourite and his mother was the best cook in the whole world in Mike's opinion.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His father returned from the Ministry shortly afterwards and Mike couldn't understand why his mother practically dragged him into the living room and shut the door or why his dad had such an odd expression on his face every time he looked at him. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Joan, his sister, noticed nothing. She had just finished her final year at Hogwarts and was all set for a glittering career in the Ministry. Mike never tired of hearing her stories about the castle, the Ravenclaw common room, Hogsmeade and all the different lessons she was being taught. Mike would never say anything but it sounded a lot more exciting than maths and grammar.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>After he went to bed that night, Mike had what he hoped was a very odd dream in which his parents had a huge argument outside his bedroom.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Stephen, he's a Parselmouth!”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Maybe not. Maybe you just…”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Don't you bloody dare tell me I was imagining it. He was speaking Parseltongue! Our little boy...he must get it from your side of the family.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Mine? What on earth makes you think that?”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Your Uncle Randolph. He was a Slytherin. And he hung about with a dodgy crowd…”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“He wasn't a Death Eater! Look Maria, it doesn't matter. You're making it sound like little Mikey has some incurable disease. He's got an extra power, that's all.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“But what about Hogwarts? Can you imagine the life he'll have if anyone finds out?”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“I'll take him to the Quayside tomorrow and have a chat. Man to man. He'll understand.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The next day was a Saturday and Mike nearly choked on his porridge when his Dad turned to him and said.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Fancy a run to the Quayside, mate? See the ships? It's been ages. We might even stop at Shields for fish and chips.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Really? Just you and me?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah. Let your Mam and Joanie do girly stuff.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh yes please, Da!” Mike exclaimed, shovelling in the last of his porridge and beaming expectantly. His dad chuckled and went upstairs to change into Muggle clothing. Armed with Muggle money, the sight of which always made Mike giggle, they walked to the bus stop to catch the next bus into town.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Mike had one of the best days he could remember, wandering through the throng of people enjoying a sunny day beside the river, stopping to look at the boats delivering their catch to the Fish Quay, holding tight to his Dad's hand so they didn't get separated.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They waited patiently in the queue at the chippy,then found a bench to sit on, tucking into golden battered fillets of cod and plump chips slathered in salt and vinegar and licking their fingers when they were done.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Once Mike had put the wrappers in the bin, his Dad looked at him with that odd expression again.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Mam tells me she found you talking to a snake in the garden yesterday. Is that right?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes Dad. I called him Monty,” said Mike proudly.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I see. Michael, there's something you need to know.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Mike started to feel worried. His parents only called him Michael when he'd been very naughty.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What you are is a Parselmouth. It's a really rare gift among wizards, being able to talk to snakes. The thing is, You Know Who could speak Parseltongue too. “</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Mike shivered, despite the heat. He didn't want to share </span>
  <em>
    <span>anything</span>
  </em>
  <span> with the most evil wizard who ever lived.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It's supposed to be a talent that Dark wizards have. Now, no one is saying you're going to be a Dark wizard. You probably won't even end up in Slytherin. Just, when it's time for you to go to Hogwarts, don't tell anyone, okay? I don't want people thinking any less of you because of it. Do you understand, Mikey?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Mike's pleasure in the day had suddenly soured but he dredged up a smile.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I promise, Dad. I won't tell a soul.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Good lad. Now, let's head home and find out what the others have been up to and how many Galleons it's going to cost me.?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Cheering up slightly, Mike followed his father back to the bus stop. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Generally optimistic, Mike didn't worry about this new information. It would be years before he went to Hogwarts and he was a boy who kept his promises. With all the incredible things in the wizarding world, surely no one would be </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> interested that he was a Parselmouth, would they?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>*</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Four Years Later, 1st September, Platform 9 ¾, King's Cross.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Mike pushed his luggage trolley loaded with his trunk and his new owl along the side of the steaming Hogwarts Express, flanked by his parents.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He paused outside a likely carriage and stopped to say his goodbyes. He hugged both his parents, both looking tearful, promised to write at least once a week and that he would work hard.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Out the corner of his eye he spotted a dark haired boy who looked even more worried than Mike felt. Worse, the boy looked like he was on his own.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Just a minute,” said Mike. He had always been a kind boy and he thought this lad could do with some help.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hi!” said Mike. “Need a hand with this?” He indicated the trunk.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, thanks.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>With the help of Mike's parents both trunks were loaded on as the train gave a piercing whistle and began to move out of the station.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Let's see if we can find a compartment,” muttered Mike and the other boy followed close behind, also dragging his trunk.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Near the end of the train was a compartment with only a couple of people in it. Mike stuck his head in and said.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Can we sit here? Everywhere else is full.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The boy and girl looked at him with guarded expressions but the boy said,</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah of course. The more the merrier.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Mike and the other boy sat down and smiled at the other two.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you first-years as well?” Mike asked.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I am,” said the boy. He had ash blond hair and a stocky build. “John Watson.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I am too,” chimed in the girl. “I'm Molly Hooper.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Mike Stamford.” Then he turned his gaze to the other occupant who so far hadn't said a word. The other boy grinned nervously.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Greg Lestrade. I'm sorry, I'm usually a lot more chatty than this. Can't shut me up normally. I'm just really nervous.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey, don't worry.” Mike reassured him. “I think we're all a bit nervous. It's all very new, isn't it?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah. But </span>
  <em>
    <span>magic</span>
  </em>
  <span>? I mean...I dunno what it was like for you guys but one day Professor Dumbledore turns up at our flat and tells me and my Mum that I've got a place at wizard school. That I'm magical. Bit of a shocker to be honest.” said Greg.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, my sister comes here,” John replied. “She's in fifth year. So it wasn't such a shock for our family. What about you two?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I was expecting it,” Molly confessed. “My dad's a wizard, you see.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Mike felt three pairs of eyes on him and felt a bit embarrassed.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“My whole family are wizards,” he admitted. “Have been for as long as anyone can remember. My big sister just left this summer.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They all looked at each other.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You must know loads of magic already, Mike.” Greg asked.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Nah, not really. Mam and Dad told me everyone starts at the beginning, whether you're from a wizarding family or not, so we'll all be learning the same stuff.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>There was a general air of relaxation after that statement, as if Greg wasn't the only one who was worried.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They chatted some more about their families, their favourite things and quizzed Mike mercilessly about Hogwarts and he answered as best as he could.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It'd be great if we were all in the same House,” sighed Molly.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“That's up to the Sorting Hat,” replied John. “Harry told me it's what decides which House you'd do best in, she's in Gryffindor.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“My dad and sister were in Ravenclaw but me Mam was a Hufflepuff. We'll just have to wait and see, won't we?” Mike said.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>As the journey progressed, Mike felt a shameful longing for the four of them to stick together. He'd never met such different but interesting people and was quite surprised at how easy they were to talk to.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Greg especially, once a few of his fears had been laid to rest, was extremely chatty. Passionate about football and Arsenal in particular, he was fascinated by Mike's description of Quidditch.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Sounds incredible. Have you got a team you support?” Greg asked.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Chudley Cannons,” admitted Mike. “Triumph of hope over experience, really.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Molly laughed before announcing a lifelong affiliation to Puddlemere United while Greg and John laughed along with them.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When the lunch trolley arrived, Mike caught Greg looking wistfully at it without getting out of his seat so Mike bought a selection of sweets and pasties and dumped them on the seat between them.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Help yourself,” he invited. “I dunno if you've ever had wizard sweets before but they're really good. Dig in, you two.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Ooh, thanks Mike,” smiled Molly, helping herself to a Chocolate Frog.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Cheers, Mike.” said John with a grin, taking some Every Flavour Beans.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“The Frogs have cards inside,” explained Mike. “Everyone collects them.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Ooh, like Top Trumps,” said Greg excitedly.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What are Top Trumps?” Mike asked, utterly baffled. Molly giggled as John choked on what turned out to be a sprout flavoured Bean which made them all laugh after John had stopped retching. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>As the day drew on they changed into their robes, the four of them feeling a bit self-conscious and, in Mike's case, nervous. Very soon it was going to be real.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They got off the train at Hogsmeade and clustered around the massive figure of Hagrid as he called for more first-years. Once the train was empty, they followed him down to where a flotilla of small boats was waiting to take them on to the castle. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The journey passed in no time and, in what seemed like seconds, Greg, Mike, Molly and John were waiting in a line in front of the four House tables waiting to be Sorted.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Molly was the first of the four. She sat on the stool while Professor McGonagall dropped the Hat on her head. After a minute, a rip appeared and a voice announced</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"</span>
  <em>
    <span>Hufflepuff!"</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The Hufflepuff table erupted in cheers and applause and Molly scuttled over and sat down, relieved to be out of the spotlight and started chatting to another couple of newly-Sorted Hufflepuff girls.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The Sorting went on, then it was Greg's turn. He was pale green by now but walked bravely to the stool and sat down, vanishing under the Hat.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>One minute passed. Then two. Then "</span>
  <em>
    <span>Hufflepuff!"</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>With a wide grin, Greg sauntered over to the table and smiled at Molly who budged up to make room for him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The Sorting continued, soon there was only half a dozen first years waiting. Then Professor McGonagall said.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Stamford, Michael."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hoping that his shaking legs would hold him, Mike stepped out of the line and over to the stool. As soon as he sat down, the Sorting Hat engulfed his head.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Well, well. Another Stamford." said a voice in Mike's ear. "Lovely. Now what shall we do with you? Oh, my. That's an ability I haven't seen since the Riddle boy. Hmmm. Lots and lots of talent there, keen to learn and work hard…"</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Please, " Mike muttered, terrified he'd be overheard. "Don't put me in Slytherin. Anywhere but there."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Slytherin House would make great use of your gift."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"I don't </span>
  <em>
    <span>want </span>
  </em>
  <span>it!" Mike said through gritted teeth. "I just want to be an ordinary student. Please."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Very well. Your friends will help you with that, I believe the best place for you is…"</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"</span>
  <em>
    <span>Hufflepuff!"</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Vastly relieved, Mike got off the stool and hurried over to where Greg and Molly, along with the rest of the table, were cheering and clapping.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"This is brilliant!" Greg exclaimed as Mike sat beside him. "Now all we need is John."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Five students later, Mike, Molly and Greg got their wish and a broadly smiling John joined the rest of the Hufflepuffs.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A hush fell over the Great Hall as Professor Dumbledore got to his feet and spread his arms in welcome.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"To our new students, welcome. To our old ones, welcome back. Let the feast begin."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The table filled with food of all kinds and people helped themselves, chattering away. Greg looked momentarily stunned before reaching out and helping himself to a chunk of steak pie. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"I love magic," he said to Mike. "This grub is incredible."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Isn't it?" Mike enthused as he helped himself to more cottage pie. "My parents weren't kidding. Hogwarts is amazing."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Puddings followed then the first-years followed the two prefects to the Hufflepuff common room. They were shown how to get in (a specially coded knock) and found themselves in a huge room filled with flowers and plants, squashy comfortable sofas and a huge, crackling fire. Mike, Greg and John followed the prefect up a flight of stairs to their dormitory.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Their trunks were waiting for them and the three of them wasted no time in getting into their four-poster beds that were draped in yellow and black hangings.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Excited and overwhelmed as he was, Mike could feel his eyelids closing as soon as he laid his head on the pillow, very glad to be there and even more glad to be among friends.</span>
</p>
