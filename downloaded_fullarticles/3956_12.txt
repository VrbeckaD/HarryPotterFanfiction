<p>Sharing is Caring</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Being stubborn, Draco resisted Harry’s exhortation at first, his body stiffening as he tried to hold himself in check. Apparently it was a trait they shared, however, and so Harry busied himself doing everything in his power to make Draco fall apart. </p>
<p>Harry felt it the moment Draco capitulated, when he gave up and started to come, his body shaking, his inner muscles undulating around Harry’s deeply buried cock. </p>
<p>“Yes,” whispered Harry, his face pressed into the curve of Draco’s neck. “Come for me, love.” </p>
<p>His cock spilling seed, Draco groaned. “Fucking…drive me…mad—”</p>
<p>“The feeling’s mutual,” gasped Harry.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Draco’s trembling subsided, his arms tightening around Harry, who was still slamming into him. His mouth at Harry’s ear, Draco encouraged him with filthy words.</p>
<p>“…should see yourself. Such a gorgeous picture. I bet everyone around us wants you to fuck them, too. I bet they’d line up, arses in the air just for a chance you’d sink your cock in them, but it’s too bad because you’re <i>mine</i> and I don’t share—”</p>
<p>Harry moaned at the imagery, his hip thrusts going ragged. </p>
<p>Catching Harry’s earlobe between his teeth, Draco then delivered the killing stroke. “Love you.” </p>
<p>Keening, Harry came. </p>
