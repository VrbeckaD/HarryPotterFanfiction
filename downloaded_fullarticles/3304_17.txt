    <p>Remus had never gotten over the notion of <em>debt </em>he owed after his Hogwarts days. His father had thought of keeping him home after he was turned, and school had been a distant dream as he trailed behind his father. A man that loved him—he knew that— but that also… feared him. The private visit from Albus Dumbledore had been a surprise. Lyall had come home with Remus at his heels after a day of removing dementors from a muggle forest and there was Hope, being <em>served </em>tea in her own home. Remus was still sure his mother had wanted to serve the headmaster, but she was weak as sickness had started creeping in near Remus’ fourth year of life, not long before he was afflicted with his own kind of sickness.</p>
<p>“I heard that you were planning on homeschooling the child, though he was registered from birth to attend my school… I was simply wondering if there was any reason that I might be concerned of.” It was reasonable. Dumbledore might have worried about some rumor circulating or the reputation of one of his teachers, but Remus had known then that wasn’t why he was there. There was wisdom in his eyes. <em>Knowing</em>. And looking back, his father must have known it, too, to reveal the greatest family secret to the Headmaster. Or maybe it was blind hope, grasping for some kind of <strong>help</strong>. There had been so much Remus hadn’t known then.</p>
<p>Sometimes he felt he was still discovering small details that may have been better left uncovered in the past.</p>
<p>Hogwarts gave him something new. Friends. And a sense of security where he could sleep in his bed without worry. Gryffindor Tower was so high that no man could possibly slip through the long windows. Not like his room, on the ground with bars on the outside after his mother had found him sleeping in the tub because the bathroom didn’t have windows. No shadows of branches that looked like <em>claws</em> tapping at the glass. Still he had gone to the coat closet when he so much as heard a tap outside… And with his hearing enhanced after the bite… But at Hogwarts, that didn’t matter. He heard the breathing of friends. And on nights where he had nightmares, woke up in a fit, his friends were there. At eleven, they found their bodies could all fit on one bed, limbs strewn and an immense heat that made them sweat… But it was comfortable. Even when it wasn’t they still did it. Fifth year changed things… It did.</p>
<p>It was still more than he ever expected for himself, though. And he had Dumbledore to thank for that. When he felt the need to leave home for good after school, Dumbledore had helped provide for him in part in small ways. Setting up jobs for him. Remus was an unregistered werewolf—something he hadn’t been <em>aware </em>of until later life when he began questioning his father. <em>Why can’t I tell anyone? </em>But even without that piece of information, after a couple of months, wizards and witches would begin to suspect. He had learned that the first couple of rounds, before the war got into it’s thick. Then he got an owl from Madame Rosmerta. She needed someone to help tend the bar, clean the rooms. That had been Dumbledore, too, and he knew it the first time the man showed up on his shift. He was nearly nineteen, had hardly kept up with James and Peter—certainly not Sirius—given his unstable living situation and lack of an owl. But Dumbledore was holding a private party in the room above the pub. The Potters were coming, and Sirius, and Peter. He could see his friends.</p>
<p>His schooling, his friends, his job. All because of Dumbledore. And so Remus felt his debt being called upon when the party became a <em>meeting </em>instead.</p>
<p>An unwavering loyalty to Dumbledore had him nodding to every word, and after everyone had gone on—his friends making Remus <em>promise </em>that he would come round more now that he was stable—his old Headmaster took him aside.</p>
<p> “I have something I am afraid I must request of you, my young friend. But of course, you have every right to turn me down if it would be too much.”</p>
<p>“What do you need?”</p>
<p><strong>Unwavering</strong>. Even though he’d gone white as a sheet when Dumbledore explained what he wanted. Even though his worst nightmare was looming ahead.</p>
<p>Remus had been in the forest for nearing a week, somewhere between Poland and Belarus, following scent and <em>hoping </em>to get to the pack he was tracking before the full moon which was approaching. He felt the itch of it every passing day, making him agitated. He wasn’t a tracker by any means, had used the enhanced sense of smell to lead him perhaps once before when Mabel, his mother’s cat, had run off and hadn’t run back. He had been fourteen and found the poor creature mangled.</p>
<p>He was still convinced that it had been one of Fenrir’s pack. He was always convinced when something went wrong it was Fenrir, he had something to do with it. But if he ever mentioned it to his father…</p>
<p>His thoughts cut off when he heard the snap of a twig. A hand tightened around the strap of his backpack, the other holding his wand near his thigh. Nose twitched. The scent was strong, in a straight-line North… Remus paused. Had it been that strong the day before? So overwhelming before he set up to sleep? A low growl came from the thick green, and out of reaction, Remus snarled back.</p>
<p>It was the wrong choice.</p>
<p>He hardly had time to turn, a force like a boulder hitting him so he fell forward into dirt and wild grass. His wand arm was pinned, and he could see the talon like nails as they dug into his wrist, a threat should he try to struggle.</p>
<p>“I always know the smell of a Lupin.” His voice was as he remembered it, low and raspy, as it had been when he said <em>I have a surprise for your father, boy</em> that night in his room <em>stay quiet and I’ll tell you a story</em><em>. </em>Remus had been young, a boy with vibrant dreams, he’d thought the monster of a man couldn’t be real. It was a bad dream and he’d pulled his blanket up to hide his face. He’d been right to fear. “Little Remus finally decides to pay a visit. And the first thing you do is threaten me, aye, lovely? Not very nice.”</p>
<p>The smell of fear had to be rolling off of him in sheets. He’d gone stiff as a board, didn’t know what to say. Afraid of <em>angering </em>the wolf because Fenrir was hardly a man. He’d given away most of the humanity he had ever possessed, shed it like an unwanted skin. It showed in an appearance that Remus didn’t even want to see. One that had haunted nightmares and made him wet the bed for an embarrassingly long number of years—but thankfully when time came for school, the problem had been resolved.</p>
<p>“I’m talking to <em>you, </em>boy. Only us. You let me lead you like a dog on a bloody leash—must really like my scent if you didn’t figure it out. Aren’t you supposed to be <em>bright </em>with all of that fucking schooling?”</p>
<p>“I’ve never had to do this before,” Remus snapped at the even small mocking of his intelligence even though his heart was thudding loudly, fear rushing through him, through his veins. He had taken advanced courses, ones he <em>struggled </em>through. James and Sirius, they grasped things with ease. They didn’t take the things they didn’t need, like arithmancy or ancient runes, but they had an instant <em>understanding </em>that didn’t require they pour over books and keep perfected notes. Remus… he had struggled in a hope to prove he was more than the bite on his side made him. What <em>Fenrir </em>had made him. He wouldn’t let the wolf take that from him.</p>
<p>“No, I guess not.” There was almost pity in his voice, or some mockery of it. Fenrir reached and took his wand. When Remus struggled to retrieve it, still on his stomach, the older released his wrist and put a firm hand on the back of his neck. His fingers squeezed, and Remus couldn’t get a properly deep breath. “I wasn’t there to teach you and your father is no fucking help, is he?”</p>
<p>“My father did all he could—”</p>
<p>“Aye, he didn’t roll over like a coward,” Fenrir snorted. The weight lifted from Remus’ back, then his neck as the older got up. Remus moved quickly, wanting to get on even ground with the wolf he feared. There was a tightness in his stomach, looking at Fenrir. He looked <em>older</em>—of course he did. How old had he been when he’d crawled in through Remus’ window? The scarring is thicker now, making ragged lines through the untrimmed facial hair—more like a layer of fur at his chin and cheeks. But overall there is no mistaking Fenrir Greyback, grinning with sharp yellowed teeth. “So how about you tell me just <em>why </em>you came to visit.”</p>
