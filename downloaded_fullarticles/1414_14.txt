          <div class="userstuff"><p>Ginny’s favourite moments are the quiet ones, sitting close enough to Fleur to feel her warmth, maybe draw some pattern on her skin or braid her hair, watching a sunset or enjoying the smell of rain. They are never long and few in between, and Ginny can’t imagine a whole life of them, but from time to time she needs them. </p><p>Growing up the way she did, many brothers without respect for her privacy or an understanding of the word <em>quiet</em>, friends who are loud and her own tendency towards action instead of silent contemplation, she didn’t have many quiet moments. Fleur isn’t exactly silent either, isn’t annoyed by the noise and doesn’t glare at Ginny when she is too loud or protests going out, but she is a calming influence. </p><p>With Fleur with her, Ginny can sit in silence for longer than she thought possible without growing bored, can settle down and let go, can enjoy the silence. It’s not something she ever thought she wanted, moments of quietly drinking tea or laying in bed together, but by now she has come to appreciate them. </p></div>
