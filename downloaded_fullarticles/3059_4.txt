          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco walked into dark room his collar secured suffocatingly on his neck, his eyes dull and back straight. </p><p>"Scorpius, darling, are you alright?" Draco whispered to the lump on the bed. The lump shifted ever so slightly in response to the voice. </p><p>Draco sighed and clutched the fan in his hand as he slowly approached the bed. </p><p>Rubbing his hand on, where he presumed, Scorpius back was he lifted him out of the confines of the blanket and onto his lap. </p><p>"Scorpius, I know it is hard starting the courting season, but it will be okay. You'll find a lovely Alpha who'll take care of you just fine," Draco said softly, there were tears in his eyes though, contradicting his words.</p><p>"I have a gift for you," Draco whispered smiling softly. He put the green diamond jeweled fan in Scorpius hand, "this is the fan I used when I was going through my courting season."</p><p>They sat in silence for a few minutes, listening to the sounds of each other's breathing. </p><p>Draco couldn't wait any longer and started speaking, "Scorpius I-."</p><p>Suddenly Scorpius jumped up and started yelling, "Mum you don't know what this feels like, having to give myself to someone like that. You couldn't-" Scorpius stopped and resumed his sobbing. </p><p>"I'll try talking to your father," is all Draco said before silently exiting the room. </p><p>All that could be heard were sobs.</p></div>
