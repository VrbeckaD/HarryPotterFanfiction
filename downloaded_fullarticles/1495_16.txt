          <div class="userstuff"><p>Late one evening, Snape was sitting at his desk in his office, grading papers. When he heard the timid knock on his door, his eyes flicked up, and he growled, "I am busy."</p><p>"Oh, sorry then. I'll just come back when it's more convenient."</p><p>Wait a minute. Snape knew that voice. In a flash he was at the door, and opened it with a scowl on his face. The owner of the voice was still outside, and Snape's scowl deepened.</p><p>"Lupin? What are you doing here?"</p><p>"I just came to return your goblet," the man in question answered, proffering Snape the goblet that the Wolfsbane potion had come in. Snape snatched the goblet out of his hands with a sneer.</p><p>"Thank you," he said curtly, and made to close the door. But Lupin was blocking the doorway.</p><p>"Actually, I was hoping we could talk for a minute?" he ventured hopefully.</p><p>Snape cocked an eyebrow. "And what could we possibly have to talk about, Lupin?" his tone implied that it was a rhetorical question, but the werewolf answered anyway.</p><p>"Lots of things. Can I come in?"</p><p>Snape rolled his eyes; obviously Lupin was not going away until he got his little 'chat'.</p><p>"Very well," he said at last, and moved aside for the other Professor to enter his office. He then took his seat behind his desk, and Lupin sat in a chair opposite it. Snape leaned back in his chair, attempting to look bored.</p><p>"So, what is it you wanted, Lupin?"</p><p>There was a moment of awkward silence, and then the other man spoke, plainly and calmly: "I came here to apologize."</p><p>For a second, Snape didn't understand what was going on, and was just about to ask what the hell he was playing at when realization hit him like a Bludger to the head. He gripped the arms of his chair so hard his knuckles turned white.</p><p>"Oh, you did, did you?" he replied, in a clipped voice.</p><p>Lupin sighed and carded a hand through his hair, as if gathering his resolve.</p><p>"Yes. Snape, I'm really, really sorry about what happened that night. I don't expect you to forgive me, but I still wanted to tell you. I tried to when we were still in school, but you'd taken to avoiding me at that point." He took a slight pause.</p><p>Snape was about to protest, but then he remembered the brown-haired, amber-eyed boy chasing after his retreating back in the hallways, saying, "Snape? Snape! I really need to talk to you!"</p><p>He shut his eyes in an effort to block out the memories. Opening them again, he realized that Lupin had begun talking again.</p><p>"--not important. What's important is that I say it now. I'm so sorry that you were subjected to that... to me. And I hope nothing like that happens to you ever again."</p><p>There was a silence, and then Snape snapped, "Are you through?"</p><p>Lupin looked a bit confused, but nodded.</p><p>Snape sneered.</p><p>"So, not bringing your little friends into this? After all, it technically was Black who was behind the entire thing. Why aren't you blaming him, or Potter, or Pettigrew? Or do you, in your unfailing politeness, refuse to speak ill of the dead?"</p><p>Snape had a feeling he was stepping into unwelcome territory, but suddenly repressed feelings from his adolescence were breaking free, and there was no stopping them.</p><p>"Where are your little friends now, Lupin? Is that why you're coming to me? Because you're grasping at straws, trying to hold onto the last bits of your shattered childhood? Trying to retain the memories of the little pranks you and your filthy Marauder friends used to pull on me? Trying to be Moony again? Well, let me tell you Lupin--"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Snape had been cut off mid-sentence, and merely gawped at Lupin, whose eyes were now burning with an emotion he'd never seen in them before: disgust.</p><p>"I'm not Moony, not any more. That part of my life is over and done", Lupin said, with finality.</p><p>"I'm not coming to you as James's and Sirius's friend, Snape, nor as a Marauder. For the first time in my life, I'm coming to you as myself; nothing more, nothing less."</p><p>Seized by sudden inspiration, he stood up and reached across Snape's desk. "Hello, I'm Remus Lupin. Pleased to meet you."</p><p>Snape looked more than a bit shocked at the turn in the conversation, and for a moment considered refusing Remus's hand. He had a right to.</p><p>Then the words that Lupin had just said rolled over in his mind, and he realized that perhaps he had not really gotten to know the real Remus Lupin after all. Maybe now was a good time to start.</p><p>It wasn't like they had much more to lose... they had both lost so much to this war already.</p><p>After a moments' hesitation he took Lupin's hand and shook it, the corner of his mouth twitching slightly upward in what could be called a smirk.</p><p>"The pleasure is mine, Remus Lupin. I'm Severus Snape."</p><p>The handshake ended, and the two stood looking at each other for a moment, unsure of what to say. Then Snape reached behind him and produced a bottle of Ogden's from his supply cabinet.</p><p>"Would you care for a drink?" he asked, setting the bottle down on the desk and getting two glasses.</p><p>For the first time that evening, Remus smiled. "I'd love one."</p><p>Â </p></div>
