</center><p>It was Friday again, thank fuck. After an exhausting week of Auror training Harry had been looking forward to his weekly pub night with his friends. They all met up in the Leaky Cauldron for what they dubbed an all night blow out. It rarely lasted all night, however. He was currently sat at a table, opposite Luna who had been talking about the recent issue of the Quibbler for at least half an hour. He felt like he needed to make a contribution but he really couldn’t be bothered. The only thing on his mind currently was getting drunk. Harry was somewhat solemn today, a week Tuesday past his boyfriend Jared had decided to break off their two month relationship citing Harry spent ‘too much time’ working. </p>
<p>“You alright mate?” asked Ron, who looked at him with a concerned expression on his face. Although he meant well, Harry couldn’t help but feel irritated. He was sick of people asking him if he was okay, it was possibly the most annoying thing ever. Of course he wasn’t okay, the only regular thing in his life had dumped him and got with someone else two days later. I mean, he didn’t love Jared but at least he was there whenever Harry called. </p>
<p>“Yeah, fine.” he mumbled, staring down into his pint glass. It was alright for Ron, he had Hermione - she was a constant in his life and their love was unparalleled. Luna, who was irritatingly still talking about the fucking Quibbler was dating Ginny, his ex. They’d broken up about two weeks after the war, Harry had come out to her and admitted that while what they had was special, it wasn’t meant to be. Thank Merlin she’d agreed and explained that she'd become very close to Luna and her preference for women basically sealed the deal. </p>
<p>Ginny was sat next to Luna, holding her hand on the table. Harry looked down at their joined hands and sighed. He wished he had someone that cared about him. Jared was a good shag but really that was about it. He was as dull as a box of rocks.</p>
<p>The door to the Leaky swung open and in walked Dean and Seamus, who were also a couple. Harry groaned inwardly. It seemed that he was the only person here that was single. “Hiya!” Seamus greeted, sitting down on the bench. “Sorry we’re late, got held up.” Dean blushed, him and Seamus shared a look that Harry knew all too well. Seamus announced he was parched and trotted off to the bar in search of firewhiskey.</p>
<p>“How’s Auror training going Harry?” Luna asked, she watched him closely - he looked up and shrugged his shoulders. “Alright, tiring.” When the hell did she stop talking about the Quibbler? He thought.</p>
<p>The door swung open to the Leaky once again and Harry’s eyes trailed over to the door. What they landed on took him by surprise, his jaw went slack. Draco Malfoy was the last person he expected to walk through those doors, but holy shit.</p>
<p>Beside him stood Pansy Parkinson, to her credit, she no longer had the pug face she once did at school. She was wearing the tightest, shortest black dress he’d ever seen in his life and her arm was dangled around the neck of Blaise Zabini, who wore an immaculate fitted cobalt suit. But what took his breath away was how ridiculously hot Malfoy looked. He was wearing a pair of skin tight black jeans, a green shirt, two buttons undone at the top. His hair was longer, sweeping and a fringe fell over his eyes. </p>
<p>Harry stood up, nodding to Luna who followed his gaze. A smile appeared on her face. “Anyone want anything?” he asked, gesturing towards the bar. Ron held his pint up and grinned. “Another mate, cheers.”</p>
<p>After Harry had gotten all of their drink orders, he walked over to the bar and stood beside Seamus, who was still waiting for his and Dean’s order. “Alright.” he said, nudging Seamus lightly with his elbow. “Aye, how was work?” he asked casually, leaning against the bar. Harry shrugged his shoulders. “Not bad.” he replied, but his attention was elsewhere.</p>
<p>Not only was Draco ridiculously fit, he seemed to be sporting two muggle lip piercings, and an eyebrow piercing. Harry’s mouth went dry.</p>
<p>“Oh, fancy seeing you here Potter.” Malfoy chuckled lightly, gesturing towards the barmaid. “Three glasses of firewhiskey please.” he ordered, before turning his gaze back to Harry. Suddenly, Harry felt very underdressed. He’d just thrown on a plain white t-shirt and a pair of blue jeans and his vans. His hair was still as messy and wild as it once was, however he’d updated his glasses and he now had thicker black square frames. He anxiously ran a hand through his hair.</p>
<p>“Alright Malfoy?” he asked, narrowing his eyes. He knew if he continued to stare at him he’d worry Seamus, who was looking at him with the most devilish smirk. “Well I’ll get back to the table, enjoy.” he winked, before leaving Harry there with Malfoy.</p>
<p>Pansy and Blaise shared a look, then walked through the Leaky to find a table. “Quite well, thank you.” Draco replied, tapping his finger against the wooden bar. </p>
<p>“I er… I like your piercings.” Harry said awkwardly, pointing towards Draco’s mouth. Draco blinked, then nodded a blush spreading across his cheeks. “Thanks, I got them a few months ago.” </p>
<p>Harry nodded in response, an anxious bubble settled in his stomach. “That’s cool.” he mumbled, turning back towards the bar. He realised he hadn’t actually ordered his drinks. “Do you have any?” Draco asked, his gaze was fixed to the side of Harry’s face, studying him. Harry shifted uncomfortably before shaking his head. “No, I er, I never got one.” </p>
<p>“That’s a shame.” Draco shrugged, he picked up the now filled glasses of firewhiskey and nodded his head towards Harry. “See you later, Potter.” he winked, walking off towards his friends.</p>
<p>Harry quickly ordered his drinks, mimicked Draco’s earlier movements of tapping on the bar and mumbled a quick thank you and half jogged towards his table again pushing the pint in Ron’s direction. “Have you seen Malfoy?” Harry asked as he sat down. He earned a groan from the majority of the table.</p>
<p>“What?” </p>
<p>Ron turned his head towards his best friend, the look on his face was a cross between amusement and irritation. “What about Malfoy?” he asked, sighing. “He’s got like, lip piercings.” Harry mumbled, his eyes trailing off in search of the platinum blonde hair.</p>
<p>“Snakebites, you mean?” Luna asked dreamily, smiling. “I think they’re rather nice.” Ginny nodded in agreement. “I saw as he walked past, he definitely suits them.” </p>
<p>Harry nodded along with her, then blushed and ducked his head. “Does this mean you’re going to be obsessed with Malfoy again?” Ron asked, earning a shove in the side from Hermione. “Ow! What? He was!” he exclaimed, eyes wide.</p>
<p>“Shhh” Hermione scolded, shaking her head at him. He just shrugged. “It’s true!”</p>
<p>“We don’t talk about Harry’s obsession with Malfoy, it’s a rule.” Dean pointed out. Seamus agreed. “What, I’m not obsessed with Malfoy.” Harry scowled, sending daggers towards Seamus. “Riiiight.” Ginny smirked.</p>
<p>The night went on, plenty more drinks were ordered and Harry could feel his head starting to cloud. He’d already had four pints before Malfoy walked in, now he was on his sixth firewhiskey and he wasn’t really sure he was able to stand properly. He’d only ordered that many because every time Malfoy went up to the bar Harry suspiciously downed his drink and went off seeking another. They exchanged small talk, nothing serious every time they’d come into contact. Harry hadn’t seen the other man for over a year and he found himself drawn to him. Fuck. They were right, he was obsessed. </p>
<p>Dean and Seamus were the first to leave, saying they had a date with their bed. Ron grimaced at this and waved them off. Then Luna and Ginny left, leaving only Harry, Ron and Hermione at the table. Ron sighed and swirled his pint around, his body weaving a little. “I think we should go home too.” Hermione said, although she was definitely tipsy, she was nowhere near Ron’s current level of drunk. “I thin’ we should go bed.” Ron winked, Hermione cringed. “Come on, let's get you home, are you coming Harry?” she asked, helping Ron up off the bench. He stumbled as he walked around the table his eyes unfocused. “No, I’ll stay for a bit longer.” Harry smiled. Hermione gave him a knowing look and then returned his smile. “Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do, she winked.</p>
<p>After Hermione and Ron left, Harry stared at the empty seats and sighed. He wasn’t sure why he wanted to stay, a combination of returning to an empty house, being slightly pissed and the fact that he really couldn’t stop staring at Malfoy. He realised that Malfoy was also alone now, so he plucked up his Gryffindor courage, stumbled a little as he stood and plonked himself down on the seat opposite Malfoy.</p>
<p>“Hello Potter.” Draco smirked.</p>
<p>“Alright.” he mumbled, stretching out his legs underneath the table. “What brings you here?” Draco asked, Harry wasn’t sure if it was his imagination or not, but Malfoy’s current smirk looked somewhat flirty. Definitely imagining it, how pissed was he?</p>
<p>“My legs.” he retorted, offering Malfoy a smirk in return.</p>
<p>“Touche.” Draco chuckled, bringing the glass up to his lips. He took a sip of the firewhiskey, the burn immediate in his throat. Harry watched as his adams apple bobbed, swallowing the drink down. Harry licked his lips. </p>
<p>Harry really wasn’t sure what to talk about, and he didn’t want Draco to leave either so he settled on the safe topic of Quidditch, they began to talk about the current season, which players they thought would do well, which teams they liked, which all in all was a pleasant conversation, but Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off Malfoy’s lips and Draco knew it.</p>
<p>“You know, Potter.” he started, taking a large gulp of his firewhiskey. “If I knew getting snakebites would have gotten your attention this easily, I would’ve done it years ago.” the wicked smirk was back and Harry knew he wasn’t imagining it this time. He threw his head back and laughed.</p>
<p>“I never really thought about them before, but they’re fucking hot.” Harry grinned, pleased with the shocked expression that flitted across Draco’s features. The other man was absolutely gorgeous. He was still pointy, but the way the dull light of the pub shone down on him, it illuminated the blonde in his hair so much he looked positively angelic. </p>
<p>“You’re not so bad yourself.” he replied, grinning. It was a good look on him, Harry thought. He never really saw Malfoy smile that much - he always had that nasty smirk plastered across his face, it used to piss him off but what he’d realised was now that smirk went straight to his cock.</p>
<p>“Are you flirting with me Malfoy?” Harry asked, mustering as much bravery as he possibly could. If someone had told him a couple years he’d be sitting in the Leaky Cauldron trying to get in to Malfoy’s pants, he would have told them they were mental.</p>
<p>“I am, yes.” he winked. “Fancy another?” he offered, gesturing towards their now empty glasses. “I have a bottle of Ogden’s back at mine.” Harry suggested, winking back.</p>
<p>“Excellent.” Draco nodded, standing up almost immediately. Harry followed suit, he picked up his jacket he’d left at the other table and slung it over his shoulder, leaving the pub as quickly as he could. The air hit him as soon as he left and he was aware he really was pretty drunk but definitely not Ron level.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you dating someone?” Draco asked curiously, eyeing Harry with suspicion. “Broke up.” Harry muttered, stretching his arms a little. “Ah, that’s a shame.”</p>
<p>“Not really, Jared was a dickhead,” Harry shrugged “How’d you know?” he turned his head towards Draco, who was leaning against the wall casually. He reached into his pocket and retrieved a packet of cigarettes and a lighter. Harry frowned. “I didn’t know you smoked.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Prophet, and there’s a lot you don’t know about me.” Draco smirked, he opened the packet and pulled a cigarette out, putting it between his lips and shoving the packet back into his pocket, he quickly lit the cigarette and took a drag. </p>
<p>“It would appear that way yes.” Harry shrugged, he knew the Daily Prophet had reported about him and Jared quite a lot, but he never really thought about the people that read it. Moving to stand beside the other man. Harry only really shared a smoke with Ginny, who had taken up the habit about six months ago when he was drunk. Draco took another drag and passed the cigarette to Harry, who took it and nodded his head. “I only smoke when I’m pissed.” Draco admitted, watching Harry as he puffed on it a few times. “Menthol too.” Harry commented, passing the remnants back to Draco who laughed.</p>
<p>“Menthol is decent.” Draco shrugged. Harry wasn’t sure why he was so nervous, but he could tell Draco could sense it. “I do too.” Harry offered, looking up at him. “I mean, smoke when I’m pissed.” Draco nodded. “So your place then.” </p>
<p>Harry smiled. “Knight Bus or apparate? I think I’m a bit too pissed to apparate.” he admitted honestly. Harry wasn’t great at apparating at the best of times, nevermind drunk. Draco let out a noise. “There’s a floo in there.” he suggested. Harry slapped his forehead and laughed. “Right, of course.” </p>
<p>Draco finished the cigarette and walked back into the Leaky, Harry close behind him. As they reached the fireplace, Draco turned to Harry and frowned. “Where do you live?” Harry picked up a handful of floo powder and walked into the fireplace. “12 Grimmauld Place.” he said clearly, winking as he disappeared. Draco shrugged his shoulders, grabbed the floo powder and repeated the address.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry fell through the floo, he never managed to not fall over after he came out of one of those blasted fireplaces. He quickly brushed down his clothes and turned, waiting for Draco to appear. Once he did, Harry bit his lower lip and shoved his hands into his trouser pockets. </p>
<p>Draco’s eyes wandered around his living room, he pursed his lips his gaze settled on Harry’s face. His eyes were such a bright green he wasn’t sure he would ever be able to stop looking into them. He’d wanted Potter for years, a stupid schoolboy crush that escalated. He had never imagined in his wildest dreams he’d be standing in his living room, with the prospect of sex. Of course, that was all it was but he was sure he could settle for that.</p>
<p>Harry stood for another few moments, before he turned away and walked over to an old mahogany sideboard at the other side of the room, he opened one of the cupboard doors and retrieved a decanter of firewhiskey. He placed the decanter on the top of the sideboard, jumping slightly as he felt two arms snake around his waist. Draco’s chin settled on his shoulder and he shivered.</p>
<p>“How about we skip the drinks and go straight to the bedroom?” Draco whispered breathily into his ear, the sensation sent shudders up Harry’s back, he closed his eyes briefly and nodded. Turning around, Harry’s eyes rested upon those pierced lips once again, then his gaze flickered up to Draco’s eyes, dark and dilated. Draco pulled him closer, leaning forwards to capture his lips in a passionate kiss. Harry stilled for a moment, the sensation of the metal gliding over his lips was surreal, he responded, wrapping his arms around Draco’s neck. He deepened the kiss, running his tongue along Draco’s bottom lip and over the bars. </p>
<p>Draco smirked into the kiss, opening his mouth to let Harry’s tongue explore, Harry could feel the pressure of his erection pushing against his trousers, he shifted uncomfortably his hands drifting off, tangling his fingers in to Draco’s hair, it was soft and silky and just perfect.</p>
<p>After another few moments, Harry pulled back for air, looking up at the pink flush of Draco’s cheeks. He took his hands out of Draco’s hair and grabbed a hold of his hand, leading him through the living room, up the stairs and towards the master bedroom. He put his hand on the doorknob, but was shoved into the door gently, Draco’s mouth latched on to his neck, biting and nibbling gently. A moan escaped Harry’s lips. He turned the doorknob and opened the door, they both stumbled into the room, turning around, Harry’s fingers were immediately on the buttons of Draco’s shirt. He fumbled, growing irritated so he hooked his fingers through the gaps and ripped the shirt open, a wild grin on his face as the clatter of buttons and the sound of their breaths were the only thing to be heard.</p>
<p>“I liked that shirt.” Draco growled, moving forwards to capture Harry’s lips once more. “Shit happens.” Harry mumbled against his lips. Draco grabbed a hold of the hem of Harry’s t-shirt and nudged, Harry lifted his arms up and allowed Draco to pull it up off his shoulders. Draco let out a sound of approval, Harry was still thin, but he’d filled out exceptionally, gone was the scrawny boy he once knew. He was for lack of a better word, sort of ripped. Auror training was paying off, he thought.</p>
<p>Stood shirtless, Harry’s gaze rested on Draco’s chest tracing the silver scars that covered his upper body. He suddenly felt cold. “I..” he started, unable to take his eyes off them.</p>
<p>“Don’t.” Draco sighed, suddenly feeling a little uncomfortable. He didn’t let many people see them, he’d forgotten they were there in the heat of the moment. “I’m sorry.” Harry whispered, looking up into the silver of his the other man’s eyes. Draco closed his eyes briefly, then opened them holding back the tears threatening to fall.</p>
<p>“I forgive you.” he whispered, he began moving forwards grabbing a hold of the buckle of Harry’s belt. Quickly undoing it, he pulled it through the loops of his jeans and tossed it carelessly onto the ground, pulling Harry in to another scorching kiss.</p>
<p>“You. Are. So. Fucking. Hot.” Draco growled, his lips connecting with Harry’s neck, he bit down hard, sucking. It was sure to leave a mark but at this point Draco couldn’t care less, this was all of his wank fantasies and dreams in one.</p>
<p>Harry closed his eyes, moaning loudly. “Fuck.” he gasped as Draco’s teeth sunk in. He reached into his pocket and pulled out his wand, vanishing the remainder of their clothes. Draco let out a growl, his gaze dropped to Harry’s cock, he let out a breath. “Is there anything that isn’t impressive about you?” Draco groaned, dropping to his knees.</p>
<p>Harry let out a short laugh. “Fuck off.” </p>
<p>Draco smirked darkly, he wrapped his hand around the base of Harry’s cock, giving it a gentle squeeze. “I mean, they’re all applauding you for defeating Voldemort but nobody’s applauding you for this.” he laughed. Harry stared at him, wide eyed. He clenched his fist, steadying himself. </p>
<p>“It’s pretty fucking incredible.” Draco continued, bringing Harry’s cock up to his lips his tongue darted over the slit, Harry gasped and bit down on his lower lip hard. Draco laughed, wrapping his mouth around Harry’s cock, his cheeks hollowing as he bobbed his head up and down his impressive length. He flicked his wrist around the base of Harry’s cock, earning the deepest moan thus far. Draco’s cock twitched in appreciation. Gasping, Harry’s fingers found Draco’s hair and he began running his fingers through it, revelling in the sensation.</p>
<p>“F-Fuck, Merlin Malfoy.” he bit out, trying to supress another moan. Harry knew he was loud, and he knew Draco was about to find out just how loud he could be. Pulling his head back, Draco grinned and stood up, pushing Harry further back, he fell backwards landing on the plush bed behind him.</p>
<p>Biting his lip, Harry looked up at the gorgeous man in front of him and wondered if he would be able to let this go as a drunken one night stand. After all, it’s Malfoy. Trying to push that to the back of his mind, he smiled. </p>
<p>“Lube?” asked Draco, looking at Harry expectantly. Harry obliged, wandlessly summoning the lube he passed it to Draco and winked, stood stunned, Draco bit his lip, catching his teeth between his piercing. Harry licked his bottom lip. He wasn’t sure why he was so ridiculously attracted to those metal bars, but they did something to him.</p>
<p>“Well, you seem to have many more talents.” Draco muttered approvingly. He uncapped the bottle and squirted a generous amount in to his hand, he then moved forwards covering Harry’s body with his own, involuntarily Harry bucked upwards, they both let out a moan as their cocks rubbed together, Draco immediately pulled Harry into a kiss, pushing his tongue into the other man's mouth, he reached down, parting Harry’s cheeks his finger brushing against his tight hole. He pushed the first lube coated finger into his hole gently, Harry moaned into Draco’s mouth, his hand moving to tangle into Draco’s hair. </p>
<p>Draco could tell Harry was going to be loud, that was his favourite type. He smirked against Harry’s lips, pushing in the second finger. He was tight, he twisted his fingers in a scissoring movement, Harry shifted, the burn evident. Pulling back from the kiss, Harry’s eyes trailed down Draco’s body to his cock. He then looked up at Draco, who was watching him closely. “More.” he moaned, pulling on Draco’s hair a little more forcefully than he’d intended.</p>
<p>Obliging, Draco added the third finger, Harry gasped, he moved his hips, fucking himself on Draco’s fingers. Draco groaned, it was the hottest thing he’d ever seen, there again he was pretty sure Harry was the hottest thing he’d ever seen too so he may be bias.</p>
<p>“Fuck, fuck, I’m ready - Draco fuck.” he panted, his hand had slackened releasing Draco’s hair and dropped down on to the bed. The sound of his name sent a shiver up Draco’s spine. He reached for the lube again, squirted it into his hand and began coating his cock. He was so hard and he was sure he wasn’t going to last, especially with who he was about to be shagging. He lined his cock up to Harry’s hole, looking at his face for a moment. “Yes.. yes.” Harry breathed, looking at Draco with pleading eyes. </p>
<p>Harry wasn’t usually bottom, but he really didn’t care at this point - all he wanted was Draco’s cock buried so deep inside him he couldn’t think of anything else. Draco bit his lip and pushed his cock inside, a moan escaping his lips. Harry winced a little, not ready for the burn. “Okay?” Draco asked, watching him intently. Harry stilled for a moment, let out a breath and nodded. </p>
<p>Draco began to move, gently at first, but he could tell that Harry wasn’t interested in slow sex, since he began to thrash his hips, fucking himself on Draco’s cock. He moved forwards, flicking his tongue against Harry’s nipple as he thrusted in to him, Harry gasped, an incoherent babble of nonesense coming out of his mouth, it mostly consisted of ‘fuck’ ‘draco’ and ‘more’. Harry gasped as he hit his prostate, a loud, deep moan escaping his lips. Draco shuddered.</p>
<p>“Fuck, Harry.” he gasped out, his thrusts becoming a little more erratic by the second, he was was so close. He gripped Harry's hip with his left hand, using his right he wrapped his slender fingers around Harry’s thick cock and began pumping.<br/>
“Fuck, Draco.. I’m gunna..” he moaned, throwing back his head he closed his eyes tightly, sweat began to drip down Draco’s forehead, he gripped Harry’s hip a little tighter, sure to leave a bruise but the other man didn’t really seem to care, he was a noisy fuck, Draco thought. He smirked. He quickened his pace, thrusting wildly into the other man. After a few minutes of pounding, Draco could feel he was reaching his peak.</p>
<p>He could feel his balls tighten, his eyes slipped closed. Harry came first, splashing hot come up his chest, Draco looked at the tousled sight before him, coming not long after him. Draco gasped, letting out a moan before collapsing on to Harry, trying to regain his breath, “Merlin..” he whispered, his head resting against Harry’s shoulder. He pulled out and rolled over to lay on his side, beside him.</p>
<p>It took a few minutes for Harry to regain his breath, he opened his eyes, looking at the blonde man to the right of him and smiled. Draco’s eyes fluttered open, his gaze resting on Harry, he returned his smile.</p>
<p>“That was slightly unexpected.” Draco laughed, turning to lay on his back, staring up at the ceiling above. “Mm.” Harry agreed, he reached down with his hand and intertwined their fingers. Draco looked down at their hands, a frown creasing his brow. “Holding hands after sex Potter?” he teased. Harry let out a snort and rolled his eyes. “Accept it, Malfoy.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to go on a date?” Draco asked awkwardly, frowning at his own words. He felt like a great big idiot asking that, he wished immediately he could take it back. Harry barked out a laugh, shaking his head in disbelief. “I think we’ve done this the wrong way ‘round.” </p>
<p>Draco agreed, nodding his head. “Yeah, but when did we ever do anything normally?” he offered, squeezing Harry’s hand. “Yes, I’d love to go on a date.” he whispered, Draco turned his head, his eyes instantly locking with the beautiful emerald green, he smiled softly. “Good, because you’re not going to get rid of me very easily now.” he whispered back. Harry shifted and wrapped his arms around the other man, settling his head into the crook of his neck. </p>
<p>“I don’t intend to.” Harry smiled.</p>
<p>He’d spent all those years obsessing over Malfoy, wanting to know what he was doing, where he was going, all those hours scouring the Mauraders Map, of stalking and skulking. He never thought in his wildest dreams he’d want something else with Malfoy, but that was Malfoy and this was Draco. </p>
<p>He wasn’t going to give up this time.</p>
<p>They were inevitable.</p>
