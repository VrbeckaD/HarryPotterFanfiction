<p>
  <span>Darth Vader, Lord of the Sith, took his final breath. As he became one with the force, he expected to see his wife, Padme, but something was not right. This blackness, it didn’t feel right, where was he? It continued for some time before he heard </span>
  <em>
    <span>the</span>
  </em>
  <span> breathing, </span>
  <em>
    <span>his </span>
  </em>
  <span>deep rhythmic breathing. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>No, How am I still alive?! The Emperor short circuited my suit!</span>
  </em>
  <span>" Vader thought before he opened his eyes. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Darth Vader was wearing his helmet once more, but his connection to the force was not cut, before it had felt like he was swimming through honey, his senses muted to the ebb and flow of the force. That was when he realized his suit and the mechanical parts of his body weren't itching or sending pain up his limbs at all. Vader slowly stood up, turning his head this way and that. Feeling for his lightsaber, Vader found that it was missing, those lessons that Obi-Wan had pounded into his head so many years ago came back to him in full force.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Anakin! This weapon is your life!</span>
  </em>
  <span>” His old mentor’s voice circled around his head, he could only smile at the voice. This lesson had saved his life so many times when he had been the feared Dark Lord of the Galactic Empire.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Raising his right hand, Vader called his lightsaber to him. The black and silver hilt flew out of the grass and into his open palm, the familiar handle fitting his hand perfectly. Quickly inspecting the weapon showed that it was in pristine condition and then heard a scream. Screams didn't usually gain his attention, but this one did. It sounded like Padme when he dreamed of her dying, calling out his name as her face twisted and contorted in pain.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"</span>
  <em>
    <span>No, forget about that, she is gone and I am still alive.</span>
  </em>
  <span>" Vader told himself.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"</span>
  <em>
    <span>Then why did the voice gain your attention, Vader?</span>
  </em>
  <span>" The voice of Anakin Skywalker asked in his mind. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Darth Vader ignored the question, it was nothing but the remains of his past self and he accepted that because of his son, Luke. Luke had saved him from the Dark side, but he was Anakin’s dark side. The ‘Hero-of-tomorrow’ was no more, all that remained was the feared and dreaded Darth Vader. But maybe, he could change and become what his son had become, a Jedi. Vader shook his head, no, he was no more a Jedi than he was a Sith. But, if he balanced himself between the dark and the light sides of the force maybe he could start on a path that was close enough to the same path that Luke walked.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The imposing Sith Lord sighed as he sprinted towards the sound. As he ran, Vader noticed something odd about his surroundings. He was in a forest, the trees were bare of anything and made it look creepy, making the Sith Lord instinctively shudder. Where were the people? Vader felt something wash over him, it was a weak force aura that had been destroyed by something powerful. Then he saw the house, the house itself must have once been pure white but now looked old. Lord Vader stopped in front of a destroyed door, lightsaber in hand, he marched into the house. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His helmets scanner's found the body of a man on the floor as if he had been shot, but he had no visible wounds to say he if he had been. Whatever he had died from, it was quick and painless. Continuing towards the stairs, Vader froze as he heard a high pitch voice come from one of the upstairs rooms. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Pity, your mother would have lived if she moved away from you...No matter, your death is near Potter!" </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Vader leaped up the stairs to see a man, draped in a midnight black robe, point what looked like a stick at a child that was in a crib. The man had a aura of pure evil around him and something else, like the man was missing something. Vader felt like the world had just made it so he couldn’t do anything as he heard the evil being shout,</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span> "AVADA KEDAVRA!" </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A bright, deadly green flash of light appeared from the tip of the stick, heading straight towards the baby’s head. To both his and the man's shock, the beam of green energy rebounded against the boy’s forehead and by some twist of fate, sped right back at the castor. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“WHAT?! NOOOOOO!!” The man screamed as the green light hit him in the chest before he collapsed in on himself, leaving the midnight black robe behind. The robe fluttered before a wraith like creature shot out of the robe and flead into the night, screaming unintelligibly as it did.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Darth Vader stood motionless in the doorway, from what his scanner’s had picked up from that green light, it was a concentrated beam of energy that was not to dissimilar to a laser bolt. The boy in the crib had by some miracle deflected the energy back at its source without any consequences. Vader was brought out of his daze when he heard the woman on the floor gasp.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"James?" the women asked, her vision was glazed over, as she looked at Vader. Vader walked over and knelt down, picking her up. The woman had vivid red hair, brilliant emerald green eyes and a beautiful face, this ‘James’ must have been her husband and was one lucky man.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span> "No, I am not James, I am Darth Vader." The Dark Lord of the Sith said.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The mother smiled before she said "Well then, Vader, I’m Lily," </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She started coughing; Vader used the force to calm the spasms before she continued.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"I’m must be a terrible mother in your eyes,” She said in a bittersweet voice before coughing several times.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Vader only said “No, it is not your fault that you were unable to defend your son. That man was more powerful than you, your surviving his attack is proving that you want the best for your child.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She smiled before she said “...Please raise him...I’m sorry for placing this burden on your shoulders...Protect Harry~" </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Vader watched as Lily, the mother of the boy, pass on to the force. The look of peace on her face made it look like she was only asleep, but Vader had only to feel her force aura to know that she had left the plane of the living.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Laying her back on the floor, Vader stood before he spoke "I will raise him, I'll raise your son as if he was my own. You have my word." </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Turning and walking towards the crib, he lifted Harry out of it and walked out of the room. Harry was asleep before the two of them even left the house, thanks to Darth Vader's breathing.</span>

<p>
  <span>Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was worried. Why you may ask, well his plan to have Hagrid retrieve Harry James Potter from the Potter manor had failed. When Hagrid had arrived, he went straight to the boy's room, only to find that Harry was gone. The half-giant had looked everywhere but all signs of the boy were gone. Snape also had said when he had gone to the Potter's house, Harry was missing.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Dumbledore had planned to send Harry to his aunt and uncle, because he thought that living as a celebrity would make the young Harry grow up to be full of himself and that was not what Albus wanted. His plan was to take the young lad to his muggle relatives, the blood wards had been set up and the letter that the headmaster had writing was laying on his desk, but the plan had to have Harry there. The old wizard could only guess what had happened, Sirius had gone after Peter Pettigrew, but the headmaster was confused. Why would Sirius go after Peter when he was the secret keeper?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"But, where are you?" Dumbledore murmured to himself, as he looked at one of the many devices in his office, but this one told him if Harry was alive, if he wasn't, the device would have been turned to dust. Harry was alive, that was a good thing at least, but the million galleon question was, where is Harry Potter now?</span>

  <span>Harry James Potter was blade to blade with his father, Darth Vader, something to which his father said no one but Luke Skywalker could do until now and he was 7 years old! Catching the next slice of Darth Vader's Lightsaber with his own, Harry parried and leaped over his father and held the lightsaber to the back of Darth Vader's neck. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Impressive." Darth Vader spoke before deactivating his crimson lightsaber and putting it back on his belt.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Most impressive, your mother will be pleased." Vader said as Harry beamed with pride. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Darth Vader adopted him and at the age of 4, and that was about the same time that Darth Vader had told him about his parents. The last Potter was shocked to learn that his real parents had been murdered, then he had nearly gone down the utter dark path of the dark side of the force in his rage. Vader saved the young boy from himself by telling him that raging and falling to the dark side would only prolong the man’s life. Harry had final accepted that fact before promising that he would be ready when that man reared his head again.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span> Harry and his father meet his adopted mother, Jedi master Sheldia, when Harry was 5 years old. The Sith Lord had been surprised that an ancient Jedi from the old order had appeared out of thin air. Harry had been playing in the park when the Jedi master had fallen out of the sky and into the playground's sandbox, running over to help her out. Sheldia had taken an instant liking to Harry and when she found out that his mother had died right before his very eyes, she had told Vader that she would adopt Harry as her own child, no if, ands, or buts.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Then Harry found his two adoptive Uncles Jango Fett and his son, Boba Fett. They had appeared confused and amazed that they were both alive. After some introductions, Harry had instantly called them both Uncle, he was 6 at the time, so he had some time to still grow. But Harry was brought out of memory lane by his mother's voice.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Vader! Harry! Time to eat!" </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Coming Mother!" Harry called back.</span>
