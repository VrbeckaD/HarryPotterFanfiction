    <p>I need to fill it in, a lot more. Have a few twists, but nothing worth the time right now.</p><p>Lily had spent three months going over the spells, runes, and rituals. Lily had triple checked the Arithmancy. She had quadruple checked the Blood Seals and the Enchantment. She went over the activation Spell for the Runic circle and individual Runes to power the Ritual.</p><p>Lily thinks as she finishes. If Severus had not told her of the prophecy, he overheard. The time wasted. "Alice" Wunder Longbottom, "Andy" Caitlyn Tonks, Pandora "Selene" Lovegood, and her; together with all four family tomes, Family Magic, and research; came up with an idea.</p><p> The Summer Solstice was in two days. Tomorrow the Runic circle; During the Solstice doing the enchantment, Runes, and Family Magics. Then as the evening sun sets the ritual. Then the sacrifices whenever the attack happens. James or Frank will die to ensure Harry and Neville live. Unborn Luna and Nymphadora will be the linchpins between the two.</p><p>Harry would live, even if it cost her and James's life; and maybe the other twos. Selene did say that in all likelihood all four of us might die, but it does not seem to be a major line. The betrothal contracts for in case it happens are at Gringotts. Whichever one of the boys, the girls want, they will get; even if the same boy.</p><p>Killing Voldy Shorts and letting the four have a great life, would be worth all our lives. Harry sits like the good boy he is. I had just fed him. My nipples feel abused, used, and great. No one noticed the two flies procreating, during the ritual; on Harry, in the circle.</p><p>It was time for the first part. His first Birthday. Neville's had gone perfectly. The ritual is going exactly as made. I made myself cum, beyond belief. Added Alice's, Andy's, and Selene's cum and blood. Harry did not cry, when I made a small cut on his penis. Then drew out semen from his balls. Neville had cried, as it hurts; since they are not old enough to procreate. I used the mixture with his blood to carve out, the seven runes. The ritual seemed to go perfect. So why was I nervous.</p><p>The enchantment was carved with the required runes into the seven spots on his body. Again, he did not cry out. He is such a great boy. I just love him to death. Then we used Dora's blood to seal the seven runes and to wash him, of the blood. Exactly the way we did Neville yesterday.  Everything seemed to go off perfectly. He even laughed and giggled.</p><p>That stupid mosquito was the only thing, making it not perfect. I did not realise, that it had sucked Harry's, then my blood; when I killed it.</p><p>The next part, the Summer Solstice. We repeated both rituals in between the two of Harrys for Neville. It was a good thing there is over an hour between our places. So the setting sun for one was the same setting sun for the other.</p><p>Months pass, Lily still looked for other ways. Selene has Luna OK. She says that something was added to the Ritual. It took us looking thru the Pensive, to see me killing the Mosquito. Then the two flies leaping off Harry. Harry killing them by clapping. So a little pre-done death. That eliminates the line where all four of us die.</p><p>The last part was today, at noon. The part I researched by myself. The part that may damn me. All Hollows Eve, if I do this, Harry will never be normal. But if I don't do this, he might still die.</p><p>The Elves will love him, the others will also. But if he collects to many, he will start to make other races. If he is smart enough... Hmmm... Or has one smart one to guide him... I will have to die in this body or if James is dead; Harry will be my life... She calls the Elves one by one, till the only ones left are ones with under aged, elven children and pregnant ones.</p><p>Happy Halloween, she whispers to herself. The ones with children are done. She feels dirty on her soul; she is forgetting something, but Harry is the most important person in the world. She feels the magic sucking at her soul.</p><p>I joined James on the other side. But I did not seem to be all the way dead. That mutt screwed up. Then that senile old fart... Grrrr... My poor baby.</p><p>Severus digging up my body that still partially lived was sickening. It told me that I was an obsession to him. That everything he did was to have me, after James died. By cutting off my hair and what he did was offensive. My head of hair is shaved. My body abused!</p><p>After three days of not breathing, my body took a breath. The first Elf had died. I continued to breath once every hour. I was happy he could no longer use my body, as a shield would appear to stop anything from entering it.</p><p>The poor girls, the babies he put in them. Then removing their memories and setting them free after six months. His doing it over and over. Three to five young girls each month.</p><p>I realised the children were not mine, but due to the new formula he created, they were genetically part mine. The Full-Polyjuice was not 100%; only about 40% DNA wise. So the children would be all three of ours. Severus's, the girl's and mine; oh my. The effects lasted for the baby, forever. For the girl, a day of rapes.</p><p>Something about this, something about before I married James. Was interfering with my waking up. It was also interfering with me in the afterlife, as I was not all the way dead. So having one breath per hour aged me very little. 23,040 breaths per day on an average person. My breathing once per hour. So every 960 days I aged one day. So 2.63 years, I aged one day.</p><p>James the last Potter, descended of the four founders, was also descended of Merlin. He had used his Head of House Magic to enslave Lily Marie Evans. Charlus had given James the power of the Peverell house, while holding the Potter one.</p>

<p>Not knowing Lily was also descended from Merlin on the Squib side. She was bound to the Head of House Peverell from the magic. Her love of her child, Harry; made it permanent. As Harry was now heir to House Peverell.</p><p>Charlus and Dorea dying from supposed Dragon Pox, sealed all the magic, to do with the Potters, to Harry! The rest is history, for the frying pan almost killing him. The tumbles down the stairs and beatings in the basement. The starvation, the hair cut. The "Harry Hunting".</p>

<p>Dummydore binding Harry's Magic, not once, not twice; but thrice, due to what happens at the Dursley's. Dumb As A Door, still not understanding how Harry keeps breaking the bindings. His not knowing of the sacrifice of the poor Elves, every time.</p>

<p>The blood wards still working perfectly as she, Lily and the Elves loved him and they were not dead.</p><p>The day Selene joined her, was a shock. She is sure that something went wrong. Nymphadora and Luna seem to be soul bonded to Harry. Her and I spent days of the after life; going over the Arithmancy, Enchantment, Runes, and finally the Rituals that I used, beyond what was done with Neville.</p><p>She found out what happened to Frank and Alice; only because they were tied to the Enchantment. They both stayed there looking at it all. Something was off. Alice should not have been cursed into insanity. It had to be a spell, keeping her down. Frank might be permanently gone, as he absorbed so many of the spells to protect Alice and Neville. Bellatrix taking Neville into another room.</p><p>The problem was both of us could only watch anyone involved in the Rituals we were involved in, with in the Enchantment. The deaths of the House Elves from Vernon "killing" Harry, losing their life forces to save him. While we could watch Luna, even though she was supposed to not be tied in. I could also watch my body.</p><p>She watched over Harry, saw that the old Geezer was letting the part Horcrux gain a hold. The poor elves dying from the Horcrux drawing their power, instead of Harry's. That was when they both realized that it was Albus that really betrayed them.</p><p>Selene had been trying to get custody of Harry. Andy was helping her. Her death was so unexpected that they looked through her memories and saw a wand out of the corner of her eye. Then the explosion and the shield forming around Luna, protecting her.</p><p>They watched Hagrid go to Diagon Alley; the Goblin coming to Hagrid and Harry; taking them to his station. They both knew that was not right. They saw what happened and hated Dummydore even more.</p><p>They watched Harry save the girl from the Troll. The life debt and her bonding. Selene squealed as they realized that there were now three girls bound to Harry. She was pissed to see poor Neville, still not get any happiness; except for his plants.</p><p>The stone being hidden by Albus, so he could study it. They recognised it was not the real stone. It was driving Albus the shit, crazy. They both studied it and realised how to create a true one. It was sick, to see how it was made. It needed things similar to making a Horcrux!</p><p>They saw Dumb As A DoorÂ compulse and charm poor Dora. Then Remus, as he was going to talk to Harry. Now that the supposed wards would not stop him.</p><p>NEXT CHAPTER: LILY IS PISSED AND WORKING UNDER COVER!</p><p>I know there is a grammar/spelling error when/then; but now trying to find it while editing, can't!</p>
