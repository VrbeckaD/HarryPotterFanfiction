    <p>The blond man called himself Olivier, but there was something familiar about him. It had been bugging him for some time now. Kevin was sure that wasn’t his real name, sure he wasn’t the mere bard he claimed to be. He was about to say something, but then Olivier sank to his knees before him, beaming radiantly. </p>
<p>“Bless me father, for I have sinned?” He inquired, tongue swiping enticingly across his lower lip</p>
<p>“That’s...not a prayer we use in the Septian church, sin isn’t exactly a theological concept with which we- “ </p>
<p>“Oh good,” Olivier purred, reaching for Kevin’s belt and starting to undo the buckle.  “Then perhaps you won’t mind if I commit another sin?”</p>
<p>Not a Septian matter but Kevin was familiar with the origins of the prayer. He was also aware that it came from a ritual of confession, a ritual which held anonymity sacred. Putting the question of identity from his mind for the moment, he closed his eyes and leaned back against the wall. </p>
<p>“It’s not my job to judge your actions a sin.”</p>
<p>“Then you won’t mind?” Olivier repeated, moving closer, the faintest hint of warm breath finding its way through his clothes, his own body starting to stir just as faintly in reaction.</p>
<p>“Not at all.”</p>
