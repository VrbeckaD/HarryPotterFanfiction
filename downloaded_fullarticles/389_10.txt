    <p>Teddy was honestly a little frightened to go into his Defense Magic class. His teacher was the infamous Draco Malfoy; he had heard so many stories from his godfather about their rivalry. </p><p> He filed in with the rest of his house, Ravenclaw, then Gryffindors also filed in. </p><p>Mr. Malfoy was shorter than he expected him to be, probably a little shorter than even Harry. His cloaks were light blue. He had silky blonde hair, not at all slicked back like he thought it might be. His eyes were icy blue, but his gaze was not cold. </p><p>Teddy sat at a desk like the rest of the students, and they all nervously waited for him to speak. "Good morning, I'll take class attendance, and then we can begin," he said. Teddy perked a little; his voice was gentle even though he didn't smile. He wasn't scowling either, though. </p><p>Once he finished attendance, he set his clipboard down. "My name is Draco Malfoy, to you all, Professor Malfoy. In this class, you will defense spells, learn about some potential threats, and learn offensive spells only to be used in emergencies," the Professor look was stern for a moment. "Today, we are going to learn the best and most useful defense spell. Come and stand around me," everyone got up.</p><p>He cleared the desks immediately to the walls "anyone with any knowledge on such a spell?" he asked.</p><p>A girl in front of Teddy raised her hand, and he called on her "stupefy?" she asked. </p><p>"Good guess, but no, does anyone have any other guesses?" Professor Malfoy asked. Teddy hesitated then raised his hand "yes, Mr. Lupin?" he asked. </p><p>Teddy flushed "um, is it the disarming spell?" he asked.</p><p>Professor Malfoy smiled at him then, the first one since they'd all entered. "That is correct, 5 points for Ravenclaw. The most useful spell in defense is expelliarmus," he said. Everyone groaned "do you disagree with me? It's alright if you do."</p><p>"Professor," a boy on the Gryffindor side raised his hand "there's no way it's the most powerful. There are all sorts of spells that work better, right?" he asked. </p><p>"And by working, you mean that there are spells that do more damage?" Professor Malfoy suggested, and several nodded. "I would agree." Teddy blinked, and he wasn't the only one who was confused now. </p><p>"Maybe it would interest you to know that Harry Potter is known for using expelliarmus as his signature spell," he said. Teddy hadn't known that at all, "maybe one of you can guess why at the end of class. Let's begin," he said. </p><p>He was quickly becoming his favorite teacher; he was efficient and precise in explanation. He let them have time to figure out what they have to do but helped if they asked. Also, Teddy found he gave out just as many points to Gryffindor as Ravenclaw. He was very fair despite being the Slytherin House Head. </p><p>"I got it," a girl, Mariet Pleasure, who was having trouble with it all class, finally did it and had even caught Jackie Maltas's wand. "Professor, I did it," she said beaming.</p><p>"Excellent form, Ms. Pleasure. Ten points for Gryffindor," he gave her a gentle smile. Rare as the last, but it made her even happier.</p><p>They all circled a couple of minutes before the end of class, "you all did wonderfully today even if some of you may feel disappointed. You will get it even if it takes a while," Professor Malfoy said. </p><p>The Gryffindor boy from earlier who doubted the use of the spell was raising his hand. Teddy now knew his name was Mavis. Professor Malfoy called on him, "I think I know why expelliarmus was so useful for Mr. Potter now," Mavis said.</p><p>"Go on," the Professor signaled. </p><p>"You don't hurt anyone with this spell, and I think Mr. Potter maybe prefers not to hurt anyone," Mavis said. </p><p>That earned him one of the smiles that seemed reserved as congratulations. "I think you may be right, but now you understand why our class is called defense. Excellent work," he said. He didn't hand out points, but judging by Mavis's grin, he felt rewarded anyway.</p><p>xxx</p><p>Dear Harry,</p><p>I don't know what Uncle Ron was talking about when he said that Professor Malfoy was cold. He's the best teacher here! Everyone loves him a lot, and so do I. Today, he taught us the disarming charm. Is it true that you're known for it? Anyway, he's not mean to Gryffindor at all even though he's Head of Slytherin. I've met a couple of Slytherin students year; they're kind enough. </p><p>I'll write again soon,</p><p>Teddy Lupin.</p><p>xxx</p><p>"I can't believe it," Ron said, "everyone loves Malfoy?" he asked.</p><p>"Well, we haven't spoken in so many years. He could have changed," Harry said.</p><p>"I suppose. well, I guess we don't need to worry about Malfoy being Snape 2.0, do we?" Ron mentioned. "Always thought be a sassy little twat forever."</p><p>"Guess not," Harry said, then focused, beaming, as James toddled towards him with a teddy bear as big as him.</p><p>xxx</p><p>"You seem in a good mood, Draco. Did something happen?" Neville Longbottom asked, making Draco pause in buttering a biscuit.</p><p>"Do I?" Draco asked. He'd thought he'd kept a reasonably neutral expression. He touched his cheek. Ernie Macmillian, who taught History of Magic now after Binns decided to retire, grinned at him before jumping into the conversation.</p><p>"You may fool your students, Professor, but not us. We can see your happy with those eyes, and you've got a skip in your step," he pointed out. </p><p>Draco somewhat failed this time in trying to conceal his happiness because his cheeks flushed a pale pink. "If you must know, my wife is pregnant," he said. </p><p>"Wow, congrats," Longbottom said.</p><p>"Yeah, that's great. You must be excited," Macmillian agreed. </p><p>He breathed then released, "yes, I am. A little nervous too but mostly happy," he said. </p><p>"Oh, I was nervous too before Alice, my daughter, was born too. I still am, to be honest," Longbottom said. He nodded to Macmillian as he got up from the table and headed out, off to his chambers, maybe.</p><p> "I know that Alice won't have nearly as hard a time as Harry's son may have, but I know some people might have expectations."</p><p>"At least they are good expectations," Draco said, and Longbottom looked to him. Draco hesitated. He'd been teaching almost a year and a half now but hadn't offered much conversation. </p><p>In his defense, he was still navigating how to be a teacher at first. Muggle University had only taught him so much, and many students there were oddly attracted to his standoffish behavior. It was freeing to be in the muggle world, a place he'd thought was supposed to awful and like lying with pigs. </p><p>It wasn't, obviously, and he'd considered staying in it and walking away from the wizarding world. But it left a bad taste, and he wanted to prove to himself, he wouldn't be a coward. "My reputation isn't good, Longbottom, don't look so surprised that I think of it." </p><p>"Still with the last names, huh?" he asked. </p><p>"Habit," Draco shrugged, "sorry, Neville," he said.</p><p>"You know a lot of people like to pretend they never made any mistakes when they were on the right side, I guess, but it's all bullshit," Neville mentioned.</p><p>"Language," Draco said and covered his mouth, he was so used to speaking that way to his students. Ernie chuckled. </p><p>"You were a pretty vicious little brat growing up, not going to lie about that. But I'm pretty sure all kids are vicious monsters some of the time as we all have noticed," Neville said. </p><p>"Oh, have we noticed," Ernie agreed.</p><p>"You're kind, though, now, so what happened to bring it out has changed what we think. Your students adore you so reputation, good or bad, won't matter so long as we remember who's on our side," Neville said. </p><p>"Thanks, Neville, I'll try to remember that," Draco said. "They adore me?" he asked.</p><p>"Yes, they do. I overhear conversations about how Professor Malfoy is their favorite teacher," Neville said, and Draco flushed.</p><p>"No, they don't, stop exaggerating," Draco said. </p><p>"I'm not; it's what they say," Neville laughed, and Draco gave him a shrewd stare "do you want me to use veritaserum? I swear."</p><p>Draco let himself smile, well if Neville was telling even a little bit of truth, he was flattered.</p>
