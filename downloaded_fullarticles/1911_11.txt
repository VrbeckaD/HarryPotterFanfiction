    <p>It’s extremely late.</p><p>The enchanted clock on his mantelpiece makes sure to inform him of that — had he still a wife to return home to, he’d be settled in bed, with her in his arms by now.</p><p>But the fates had bestowed upon him the life of a widower. And if he does not pour all that time and attention, he once spent on his wife into something productive, then what shall become of Draco Malfoy? His father had always said that idle hands were the work of a lesser man; that Malfoys kept themselves busy. Work came in different forms for a man of his wealth, status and power. Surprisingly enough, though Draco had never dared to share this with his father, he was quite fond of working with his hands. Something about getting his hands dirty, quite literally, was incredibly satisfying to him. Gratifying, even.</p><p>His late wife had insisted they’d have a garden.</p><p>A ridiculous notion, he had insisted. At first. They had cooks. Servants. Let them worry about how they’d come by their produce themselves. But ah, sweet Astoria. She, too, enjoyed working with her hands, and it was through her that Draco had grown a deep love for the British soil.</p><p>And it was through losing her, that he lost that love.</p><p>Hadn’t it also been through her that he had allowed himself to love? Learned to, perhaps, too. And it was through her that he had shut himself off again.</p><p>He had Scorpius, of course. So, he wasn’t completely alone or devoid of meaning. His wife had seen to that. She knew him better than he knew himself, it had seemed, for leaving him a son, even if by doing so, she had essentially, doomed herself. He’d always blame himself for it. Her falling ill. Her death. Everything in between. He carried in him this immense guilt, and it was thrust upon him from birth.</p><p>There were many years of guilt Draco carried upon his shoulders, and it’s perhaps those years of guilt that has him working these unsociable, hard hours. If he didn’t know his Minister for Magic to be as driven as he was, he’d dare say that he was the last person to leave the Ministry building. But if Draco knows one thing…</p><p>He knows that no one could be more driven than Hermione Granger.</p><p>The mention of her name brings a smile to his lips. A strange notion, yes. But he’s alone, and he doesn’t have to pretend. Does he? He likes her. He always liked her.</p><p>He once wrote her a letter, which he never sent, in which he talked about things he hadn’t even shared with Astoria and apologised for the way he had treated her. Perhaps it was unfair that he would focus on her so much when he had been horrible to so many, but even Draco knew that he had always been particularly horrible to Hermione. He’d always say it was due to pressure from his father to be something other than what he truly was, to walk in his shoes, as it were, but it was something more than that. Now that he’s a grown man, he can admit to it. Obviously, not to her face.</p><p>Hermione was muggleborn.<br/>
<br/>
And yet Hermione was better than him at… anything magic related. Except, perhaps, flying. That was a small victory Draco held close to heart. She wasn’t fond of flying, and he was certain that she only really attended Quidditch games during their time in school, to support Harry.</p><p>These days, he finds himself thinking about Hermione Granger quite a bit. With Astoria gone, he had free time. Quite a bit of it. How many nights, like this very night, had he found himself standing outside her office door?</p><p>He knows she’s inside. He can hear the music. It’s a muggle artist. Mozart. Draco had done some research, once he had listened to an entire symphony one night, and had the song stuck in his head ever since. Unbeknownst to the rest of his peers, he had more knowledge of the muggle world than many were aware of.  Another gift Astoria had blessed him with, before she parted.</p><p>Acceptance.</p><p>And it’s through that acceptance, perhaps, that he can admit to himself, at least, that he had always, deep down, been in love with Hermione Granger.</p><p>It’s foolish to hope that now, so many years later, when she is a woman married, a mother of two children that aren’t his, the Minister for Magic of Great Britain, their great nation’s heroine and perhaps one of the most famous witches of their generation, she would look at him with something other than professional courtesy.</p><p>When had he gotten up from his office and made the journey here?</p><p>Merlin. He’s gone mad. But here he is, nonetheless, and there she is, behind that door. Her assistant is gone. The paintings that decorate the hallway are asleep, the candles all put out except for the two by her door.</p><p>His heart is drumming inside his ribcage. Like a bird, desperate for freedom. What if he were to just knock, and finally, hand her the letter he never finished and never sent? She deserved an apology, even if she had forgiven him a long time ago. She was the brightest witch of her age, after all. But not only was she bright, she was kind. Understanding, in ways that befuddled him. He got to watch her rise to power; climb through political ranks and the glory of fame that could’ve easily gobbled her up and become something that Albus Dumbledore himself would’ve been proud of.</p><p>It'd pain him to say it aloud, but damn it, was she <em>brilliant</em>. And exactly what they all needed.</p><p>Hermione Granger was the future. And he, was the very embodiment of the past her very existence and rise to power eliminates.</p><p>Perhaps it’s that which drives him to knock at her door. Twice. Once he hears her voice from the other side, a calm and melodic: “<em>Come in</em>,” he throws all caution out the window and does just that.</p>
