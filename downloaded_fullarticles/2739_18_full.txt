  <p><i>Touch my mouth,</i>
</p>

</p>
  <p><i>I’ll be home, safely tucked away,</i>

  <p><i>Well you can’t tempt me if I don’t see the day.</i>
</p>
  <p>—Mumford and Sons, <i>Broken Crown</i></p>
</center><hr/><p><i>8th November 2002</i>
</p><p><i>Little Whinging, Surrey</i>
</p><p>The November air was cool and crisp, with the hint of rain and storms that vibrated in the air. Aster Potter stared up at the thunderheads that churned above, with a mixture of feelings that pulsed through her veins like molasses. A red scarf wrapped around her throat tightly and her leather gloves griped the stroller that she pushed down the street. Teddy Lupin slept soundly curled up in his blanket, with a warming charm to keep the chill away. He was already four years and it was hard to believe that just a little under a year ago that he almost didn’t make it to see fourth birthday. 
</p><p>Her heels clicked against the concrete sidewalk, and she felt much older than any normal twenty one year old should feel. So much had happened in the aftermath of the war, where peace should have existed all there had been was chaos. It had been a slow simmering chaos, deceptive and quiet in how it built up to a breaking point and it crushed her to see how everything fell apart. And now Aster options were limited, otherwise she would have never stepped willingly into Privet Drive again. It was on these streets that Aster had learned far more cruel lessons than a child should ever have to. She had never been a rambunctious child, but held herself with a forlorn air, as if lost and out of place in the very normal and ordinary streets. If the vicious rumors that her aunt, uncle and cousin spewed had not driven other kids and adults to scorn her, her mannerisms would have labeled her too odd to associate with to the small minded people who lived in the England suburbs. A lot of people didn’t like what they perceived as different, the unknown was too scary for them to contemplate. Still she thrived in the face of the cruel attacks—words whispers by her aunt, her cousin’s “Aster Hunting”, and her uncle’s beating—by withdrawing inside of herself and being quiet as a mouse.
</p><p>Her mind had been her refuge, despite the constant darkness—the piece of Voldemort’s soul—that plagued her, trying to destroy the fleeting moments of calm and happiness with nightmares or dark thoughts. She found a place in the local park, hidden behind the holly bushes and hydrangeas, where she would hide away and daydream, as if some magical means would come and make her life all the better. Maybe that’s why she took to the wizarding world so easily because it was her wish come true, right? She had been so neglected, so starving for touch and affection that she accepted the first kind faces as friends without hesitation. 
</p><p>She had been so exceedingly naive. It wasn’t that she hated the people that she once called friends. It wouldn't hurt so badly to have all those relationships fall apart if she hated them. No, she loved and she loved deeply. It was why she had been willing to put up with so much and excuse so much in order to keep them in her life. Ron’s jealousy that reared its ugly head about her “fame” or if a boy showed interest in her romantically, he would be insolent and resentful. Aster was forced to go throw hoops to get him to calm down, most of the time. There were times that Ron came to his senses on his own and apologized, but it just made her feel exhausted after each fight. Friendship, she had thought to herself quietly, shouldn’t be like that.
</p><p>Hermione wasn’t outwardly antagonistic like Ron could be at times, but she had an superiority-inferiority complex, where she needed to be the best or do the best in order to validate herself. While she was exceedingly book smart—arguably the smartest witch of their age—she didn’t always do well when it came to putting her knowledge to practical use, and if Aster did better than her, Hermione would go into inquisition-mode to question Aster on how she did better. This caused Aster to fall into the old pattern of doing her bare minimum on her school work (like Aunt Petunia had forced her to do so she wouldn’t outshine Dudley), using the tests to keep her grades afloat and to keep Hermione off of her back.
</p><p>Aster took her time to go the house marked Number Four. She had no reason to hurry with the Notice Me Not spell active and working. She had lost the people that had been following her back in France, thanks to Luna's well aimed subterfuge and this was the last the place in the world that anyone would ever suspect to look for her. Her startling green emerald eyes with flecks of turquoise turned down away from the gloomy overcast that seemed like a fitting metaphor for all that she held bottled up inside. She wasn’t saying she was the perfect friend, or even was a perfect person. She had many faults and she had done of her fair share of wrongs. Her temper ran white hot at times, overriding her common sense. She would rush head first with emotion, instead of thought and she had contributed to the strife in many of her friendships. Still, in her eyes, she thought the good times outweighed the bad times, and she acknowledged that if not for Ron and Hermione, she might not even be here. 
</p><p><i>But nostalgia was a poor reason to cling to toxic relationships, even if it is all that I know,</i> Aster thought, swallowing down the knot of emotion lodged in the back of her throat. It hadn't always been toxic or suffocating. It had once been something that made them all better. The Golden Trio had been through so much ups and downs, Aster thought they could get through anything. Bad times and good times and war times, but it was the aftermath that fractured them completely. She couldn’t return to a normal life like Ron and Hermione had been able to because the sad truth was that Aster didn’t <i>know</i> what a normal life was. Voldemort had taken her parents, the Dursleys ensured that she had no good foundation for building relationships, and while Hogwarts had been a sanctuary—an escape—it had been a big source of danger, molding her into a dutiful soldier.
</p><p>But Aster played pretend well enough, so why not try to be normal if only to appease her friends. While Hermione started to work in the Legal Department in the Ministry, (some even heralding her as the next "Amelia Bones"), Ron had taken up the position as an Auror with gusto that earned him high praise from superiors for his willingness to get his hands dirty and deal with dark wizards where others would hesitate. Aster attempted to follow the half-hearted dream of being an Auror, as it was expected of her given that she was a hero and her father had been one before her. She had been denied for the fact she had house a horcrux inside her for seventeen years of her life. Her mental state was unfit for that of an Auror, the Ministry had claimed.
</p><p>It was both relieving and disheartening to be turned down. On one hand, it left her in a state of limbo of what to do with her life. Life-long decisions never were easy to her, given that she never really thought she would have a future beyond the next crisis, so being left so idle was a bit of a change of pace that she was at a loss what to do with. Thankfully, Andromeda took her underneath her wing, and taught her the ins and outs of Wizard Politics and how an Heir of Ancient Houses were expected to conduct themselves. It seemed all a bit silly to be honest, at first until it became glaringly apparent that it hadn't been because of horcrux that she had been denied the job to be an Auror, but because she was a high profile half-blood <i>woman.</i> Jokes in polite conversation about how many kids she would have, questions of her love life popped up in magazines, and it could have been chopped up to paranoia if she literally didn't have an old wizard by the named of Blaggerdash tell her that the only value she had was her uterus and that women didn't belong in politics.

</p><p>As if that wasn't outrageous enough, the people in Aster's life couldn't seem to realize why she didn't want that kind of life. It wasn't that she didn't want love or even to have children, but to be reduced down to a baby maker after all she had accomplished was a slap to the face. She bit her tongue though and endured all of it with a smile, even the lists of bachelors that Molly Weasley loved to bring up ever weekly dinner. 

</p><p>Let it not be said that Aster didn't <i>try.</i> She dated around the Wizarding World, but too many people saw her name and fortune as a calling card to try and tie the knot, or get her pregnant like Blaise Zabini and then steal her inheritance. It was a shame he was such a scheming asshole and attempted line theft on her, because he had been intelligent, charming and had been quite talented in bed. She had even gone a couple of dates with a lovely witch, figuring perhaps she would do better with the fairer sex. It had been nice enough, but it just cemented the fact that her tastes swayed more towards a male preference than a female one. She contemplated dating non-magical people, but she dismissed it almost immediately. With the way the statutes were set, Aster wouldn't be able to tell her significant other that she was a witch until the marriage was done and over with. So Aster put herself to work on magical theories and studies, spending time with Andromeda and Teddy. The time she spent with the Weasleys grew scarce, and the friendships with Hermione and Ron grew strained and taut given that their lives all pulled the Golden Trio in different directions. 
</p><p>But all thoughts of love and life fell to the wayside when the Sickness came.

</p><p>The Sickness was a magical disease spread across the whole of Europe in the magical communities with a deadly and life altering consequences. It was a viral infection that started out much like the flu with aches and pains, until it made the victim burn with a fever that raged on for days, if not weeks. No cure or potion could vanquish the viral infection, only improve the odds of a person surviving. Blisters and sores would appear along the skin leaking toxic magic, if the viral gestation had turned lethal and the patient would have to be quarantined or worse. Thirty-five percent of the magical world had been killed thanks to the virus, and those that managed to survive the sickness after being infected had their magical cores weakened to the point they were squibs. The impact was felt with an earth shattering force, especially given that the majority that died had been purebloods.
</p><p>Andromeda Tonks had been one of the victims that had perished in the Sickness. It that hadn't already been devastating enough, Teddy fell ill shortly after and the prognosis didn't look good. It had driven Aster to the point of madness with the fear of losing him. He had been her main reason to keep on moving forward, for getting up in the morning and for growing up in order to be the support he would need throughout his life. She had would move heaven and earth to protect him, and would have torn the moon from the sky if it would heal him. In a frenzy, she recalled how she went to every healer thinkable, to every potions master that would hear her out, even going to the deep dredges of Knockturn Alley to find illegal potions and ingredients that seemed promising. After nine days of a steady regiment of potions meant to bolster his immune system and eradicate illness, Aster woke up in the middle of the morning to see his fever had broken and when he opened his eyes for the first time in days, she wept unashamed. It finally felt like the worst was over and they could all start to recover.

</p><p>The Ministry, however, saw an opportunity in the wake of tragedy. New laws that required witches of the ages between sixteen and thirty-five to enter into marriage or marriage contracts passed, claiming that it was imperative to repopulate the Wizarding World as quickly as possible. Businesses started barring women from having careers and the media played it up, to normalize the way the Ministry was trying to strip witches’ of their rights. And it wasn’t just mundane born that were in danger, the pureblood witches too, suffered underneath this change that enveloped the British Wizarding World. Any heiress to any noble houses could no longer inherit and had to be married to gain their inheritance or it would be passed to the next person in the line. Luckily Aster had already inherited her title and things, so the laws didn’t directly affect her as of yet. It still didn’t stop from Ron from pressuring her into marriage, and who got exceedingly angry of her refusals. Even Hermione—independent and seemingly feminist Hermione—tried to guilt her into by saying that witches had a duty to not let the magic in their blood to die out.
</p><p>Aster realized that they only really cared about her and treated her like family when she fell in line with what they wanted or expected of her, but when she went against their best plans in her interest, she was suddenly treated like a disappointment or an outcast. She knew that they hadn’t been as close as they used to be, but she never expected for things to turn out like this. Aster put up with a lot and swallowed down a lot of veiled insults or attempts to set her up with other wizards, up until at a Yule party when Mrs. Weasley brought up the subject of Teddy.
</p><p><i>“He is a squib, dear, wouldn’t it be better for him to live elsewhere?—You’re so young. You should be starting your own life and own family—It would be cruel to keep him in a world where he can’t really belong.”</i>
</p><p>Aster had gathered up Teddy and left, especially when she found that Mrs. Weasley had saw fit to get paperwork for Aster to put up Teddy for adoption. She had wroth with rage and still any time she thought about the Weasley matriarch, the same dark anger would burn through her from head to toe. That when she went to Gringotts—having made reparations with the goblins after the second war ended, she was able to bank there again—and tried to figure out if there was any way to protect herself and Teddy from the Ministry and the people she once considered family. The Ministry started to print articles implying she was on the path to becoming a Dark Lady, citing the most ridiculous stories and rumors as proof. And the clincher? Was how they felt that she could be saved if only with the right guidance. It didn’t a genius to figure out just what the right guidance they had in mind ways. It was amazing how much and how little things had changed. The thing about war is that when it’s over, people just wanted things to return a status quo and so the Ministry returned to the stagnant status quo that made the fucking war possible in the first place. It kept the pureblood assured in their superiority and put wealthy families’ interests over the common folk and mundane born, and any proposed change was like pulling teeth.  The Sickness had just been an excuse people needed to justified their backwards beliefs and imposed them on everyone.
</p><p>She was already one foot out the door, and it was the letters she received from Gringotts vault left to her by Dumbledore that caused her to completely shut that door. In a letter, he penned shortly before his death Albus Dumbledore confessed a great sin to her—a sin that he had committed to gain a hero for the Wizarding World. He had enacted a very ancient and dark spell to pull a hero from another realm, a hero he could mold into the Wizarding World’s salvation. He had then offered the baby to the Potters’ who had been having trouble conceiving since they were the only other family that fit the prophecy, besides the Longbottoms, when a prophetess had another vision where Neville would fail to destroy Voldemort and the Wizarding World would be plunged into mayhem. 
</p><p>It was still a bitter pill to swallow, knowing what Dumbledore did. It made her feel small and insignificant like a pawn on a chessboard. He didn’t even know who her biological parents or what family she left behind. He had never told the Potters of her true origins, never told them about the target he placed on their backs. He hadn't cared to learn the depths of the story of a little girl he plucked from some universe, only that she had been capable of saving the Wizarding World. Aster shuddered, recalling the pensive memory of a conversation between Dumbledore and Snape. Aster would never be a fan of Snape's, there was too much bad blood to be erased or absolved by the reason <i>why</i> behind his actions, but she agreed with him on his assessment of Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore raised her to be a pig for slaughter, weighing the fate of his world above that of one girl. He may have cared for her in his own grandfatherly way, but he never lost sight of the greater good no matter how great his affection for her was. And on some level, Aster understood it.

</p><p>The good of the many outweighed the good of the few, but the ends in which Dumbledore justified his actions didn't make them any less cruel or callous. 
</p><p>Aster wondered who her real parents were or what kind of family was out there that missed her. What were they like? What was the world like? How different would her life have been if she hadn’t been stolen by Dumbledore’s spell? The thoughts buzzed around her mind constantly and there was no escape from them. The thoughts were not very productive, just more regrets that festered inside of her until she received an ominous warning from her dear friend, Luna. Before Neville and Luna departed Britain to take refuge in France, the wide eyed dreamy blond had given her an ominous warning, "Magic does not spring eternal. We cannot exist as we once were, and you cannot remain here unharmed. You cannot save us from this, but you can save yourself."

</p><p>Many people thought that Luna Lovegood was nothing more than a crazed witch, sprouting off tall tails about made up creatures or was a bit wrong in the head. All those who would discredit the blond were fools because Aster knew there was a lot more to Luna's madness than met the eye, and the young woman had an uncanny ability to have an insight into things that had yet to pass. So she thanked her friend to the warning and started planning in earnest, splitting her time between her godson and research into alternate dimensions. When Minister Kingsley passed away from a heart attack and was replaced by Ignatius Greengrass, Aster could practically see the wheels that spun towards the end begin to turn. If it had been just herself she had to worry about, maybe Aster would have stayed and fought fate.
</p><p>But she had Teddy to consider, and how her choices affected him. She was all he had left in this world and the Weasleys made it apparent where he stood in their eyes, so she could expect no support from them. She would not allow Teddy to grow up surrounded by war and death like she had been. She would not allow him to grow up in a place with an unloving family, always wondering why he had been left alone. She would do for him what Lily and James tried to do her, and give him his best chance in life no matter what the cost. She would not be some martyr to be strung up, or put upon display. She had sacrifice so much for the Wizarding World, she had literally <i>died</i> for it, and if she gave any more of herself away then there would be nothing left. So when she discovered a way to re-engineer the spell Dumbledore used to bring her here, she saw her way out and damnit all, she was <i>taking</i> it.
</p><p>And she was running out of time.
</p><p>The Ministry had sent a notice that they were sending an Auror team—with Ron Weasley on said team—to investigate suspicions of dark magic activity that she was supposedly involved in, and that she would be required to comply to a search of her properties and effects. Aster knew that she could not stay idle any longer, because she could not risk them discovering her plants and so she let the first domino of the great many that she put into place fall. With runes and blood magic, she had created a golem that looked and acted like her, sending it off as if she were to escape to France to join Nevill and Luna. Meanwhile the house elves that had agreed to accompany on this harrowing journey had packed up the mansion with great haste. All other properties that the Potters had owned had been liquidated a while ago and she had already cleaned out the majority of her vaults, setting a good portion for Luna and Neville so that they could have security in the trying times ahead. 

</p><p>So what if her actions were cowardly? So what if they were selfish? She had fought for a better world and to stop Voldemort, and the world didn't get better just because one bad man was gone because what good was stopping one monster, when the monster of apathy still lived on in the hearts of the witches and wizards? What good was stopping a monster only to have another one—more insidious and systematic—to rise in its place? She was already so damaged from her childhood, from the years spent fighting Voldemort and now the unexpected betrayal to fill her nightmares for several lifetimes. She was taking her son—he was her son in everything, including blood now—and leaving this world far behind. Far behind from those that would use and abuse her could never reach her ever again.  
</p><p>Lily and James had loved her like she had been their own child. She had found letters between Lily and Amelia Bones, where Lily joyfully told her friend about how happy she was to adopt a baby. Found pictures of James, holding her as a baby with a proud and beaming smile on his face. Her parents loved her, even if her very existence placed a target on their backs and they sacrificed everything for her. She would be forever grateful for what they had done for her, and she mourned for them greatly, wishing that she had a better chance to know them. They were innocent, caught up in Albus’s greater good as much as she had been. Releasing a shaken breath, Aster pushed the stroller up to the house labeled Number Four. 
</p><p>Aster reached into black wool jacket, and pulled a small silvery disc that was made from iridium with runes . It was an array capture that she needed to draw in the residual magic of the blood wards. The blood wards no longer existed as functionally wards, but she didn’t need the wards to function. She just needed to capture the trace of magic—of Dumbledore’s magic—to use in the reversal spell to send her and Teddy back to the world where she came from. 
</p><p>Aster Potter was taken control of her life and her destiny.
</p><p>She was no one’s pawn this time around.
</p>
<hr/><p><i>17th November 2002</i>
</p><p><i>El Giza, Egypt</i>
</p><p><i>The Pyramids of Giza</i>
</p><p>There was nothing short of wondrous about the Ancient Egyptians’ accomplishments, magical and non-magical. Aster sat inside of a tent, the fabric of it shuddering and shivering as a sand storm raged outside, but with magic to reinforce the tent and to dull the roar of the storm, the inside of the tent was almost idyllic. Cooling charms prevented overheat and Winky set about making tea. Dobby and Winky—along with three other house elves had agreed to stay in her service as paid help, willing to jump worlds with the witch in hopes of a new lease on life much like herself. (Kreacher had stayed on, but passed away of old age several months ago.) Teddy was playing with blocks on the floor with Flutterby, a baby of the house elves Butter Bee and Twinkles, and the two children giggled when Aster made the blocks dance with a flick of her hand. She hated bringing them out here in the wilderness where the desert could go from kind to cruel at the drop of a hat, but the power she needed to open a portal between worlds was no small feat.
</p><p>Dumbledore from the journal he had left behind—perhaps he had known Asher would leave after discovering her origins and left the leather bound book to her as some sort of apology—indicated that he had used Stonehenge to amplify the power behind the spell. However, the United Kingdom was not a good place for her anymore. With the allegations that she had gone "dark" splashed on the front cover of the Daily Prophet, Aster could not risk Teddy’s wellbeing by staying there for a moment longer. In her fifth year, the Ministry had done the same thing and put her on trial for misuse of underage magic when she had only been defending herself. She didn’t trust the Ministry underneath Greengrass’ reign to not try and bring up false charges. Even though they had found nothing in her home when the Aurors ransacked it, that didn’t mean they wouldn’t try again and this time plant some evidence to implicate her as the new Dark Lord (or Lady if you were picky about your titles.)
</p><p>So Egypt had been her third choice. There was untold amount of ancient magic hidden beneath the sands here, waiting for someone to come along and tap into it. Her second choice…well, it had been the Deathly Hallows. With the stone lost and wand broken, Aster assumed that was that, but there were some times that she could feel a chill creep up along her spine. Like the cold hands of death tapping up her back—taunting and teasing—and could feel amusement, and perhaps a reluctant fondness, that was not hers swell up beneath her breast. She could almost feel the wand in the palm of her hand, held there possessively and feel the weight of the stone encased in a ring of silver on right middle finger, hearing the whisper of the dead croon in the depths of her ear. She had thought to try and summon them, but it felt…<i>wrong.</i> She never wanted this power, or intentionally gone searching for it.
</p><p>Some powers shouldn’t be used. 
</p><p>So Aster shoved the impulse to the back of her mind—ignoring the huff of laughter that felt like ice on the back of her neck, and didn’t turn around because she was half afraid she would know just what she would find standing there—and searched through old tomes about powerful places in the world. There were magical pathways known as a Ley Lines that connected sites of powerful mystical convergences, like Stonehenge and the Great Pyramids. If her theory was right then she should be able to used runes to open up the Ley Lines like a conductor and pulled the energy from the Stonehenge site to the Pyramids. It would be a lengthy and exhausting process, but hopefully rewarding by the end of it.
</p><p>Part of her wished that things had ended differently between her and her friends, that they could have been supportive of her in this, but she knew that they couldn’t, or rather wouldn’t, understand what was driving her now. They had their lives, they were content with how the Wizarding World was even in its deteriorating state, but Aster…Aster never felt like she belonged. The wonders and adventures had kept the secret wound from consuming her or she pushed it to the back of her mind, but it always resurfaced with time. Her green eyes glanced over at the letters—the last letters, she had received from Ron and Hermione. Hermione pleaded with Aster to come home and trying to explain how they wanted what was best for her. Ron wrote an apology for rushing her or pressuring her into an arranged marriage, trying to state that he and his family just wanted to protect her from some manipulative pureblood that would trap her. And maybe part of them truly believed that...but it felt like one of those moments that couldn’t be taken back. All three of them at one point had been heading down the same road, but there was turn somewhere, a branch off that Aster had taken. She was so far beyond the point of return that she couldn’t see what path they were on anymore. She wasn’t bitter or angry, mostly just sad and resigned. Some people just grew apart and the Golden Trio had played pretend for as long as they could until outside forces like the Sickness and the Ministry’s oppression completely shattered the foundation of their fractured friendships.
</p><p>She had played pretend most of her life for the sake of others, to be what they needed and they took more than she gave them. She didn’t have any more left in her least she sacrifice the last bit of whom and what she was, and she didn’t have that luxury to be self-sacrificing. Her choices affected a child, and with the darkness growing in England—with no one attempting to put an end to it—she knew that leaving was her best choice. She wasn’t about to let Teddy be orphaned twice over like she had been, and Luna’s words rang crystal clear in her head once more. She couldn’t save the Wizarding World. Magic was dying here in this place. She couldn’t save them, and they would vilify her for it. Place the undeserving blame at her feet. Isn’t that what they were already doing in the papers? Because she didn’t settle down as a Lord’s wife or didn’t magically find the cure, she must be a Dark Lady that was the source of all their problems? Running her hands tiredly down her face, Aster sighed, leaving back in the wooden chair. If there was a single regret she had was that she couldn’t convince Luna and Neville to join her.
</p><p>Neville wouldn’t leave his ailing grandmother behind in France by herself, and Luna had looked at her sadly saying that Aster was going on to a place that they couldn’t follow. It had broken Aster’s heart, but she had to push onward, no matter who she left behind. Reaching across the desk in front of her, she penned a short letter to the Longbottom family to let her know that they were alright. She sent one to Bill and Fleur who also resided in France, ever since the Ministry declared that their marriage was invalid due to Fleur being half veela. The two had been amongst the handful of people who understood her aversion to how low the Wizarding World in Great Britain was sinking.
</p><p>The fountain pen moved fluidly across the paper, the words short and simple. Vague enough that there wasn’t a hint of where in the world they were, but letting everyone know enough to put their minds at ease. She had a subtler side that not a lot of people saw; she had to be ambitious and clever to warrant the hat to want to put her in Slytherin, after all. She also was a hidden bookworm, enough to have the hat mutter briefly about Ravenclaw before dismissing it because her hotheadedness would not do well in that environment. It was because of these two things that she got high enough scores on her tests to make up for the mediocre homework and class assignments where she was careful to not show her full skill. 
</p><p>Finishing the letters, she sat back to let the parchment dry when Teddy decided to crawl into her lap, looking very tired and exhausted. He got so tired and weak at times, a side effect from the Sickness that had nearly claimed him. It was one of the reason she modified a stroller for him so he could still enjoy things like the zoo or parks without getting so physically tired. Not a lot of children his age still used strollers, after all in a few months he would be five years old. She smiled when she saw Twinkle pick up Flutterby—who was half the size of the other elves, and had big eyes—and the toddler elf waved over her mother’s shoulder. “Night, night,” the little elf yawned, her voice like that of a chipmunk which made her even more adorable.
</p><p>Cradling Teddy in her arms, she looked down at her son with bright eyes. “What are you two up to?” She asked, a tone of humor in her voice. 
</p><p>“Mommy,”—yeah, it had taken Aster by surprise when Teddy started calling her that, but in a good way—“why did we have to leave home?” Teddy asked her, his big baby blue looking up at her in confusion. 
</p><p>Aster hadn’t lied and said they were on vacation. She knew the decision to leave England would be a big upheaval for everyone, especially Teddy given that was the only home he had ever known.  She told him the truth, but not heavily on the details. He was only four after all, and shouldn’t have to bear the burden of that knowledge. “The bad people, remember sweetie?” She said, tucking a strand of hair behind his ear. 
</p><p>“But…” the boy pouted, struggling for words to express his thoughts. “But what if things get better? Do we go back?”
</p><p>“Not everyone has the same idea on what better means, Teddy,” Aster spoke, after a long moment. She ran her fingers through his hair as he snuggled into her lap like a cat was ready for a long lazy nap. “Better for someone else doesn’t always mean better for us. I know it’s hard to understand what’s going on, and I’m really sorry for that, buddy. I promise when you are old, I will sit down and explain everything better.”
</p><p>“Maybe the p—” his words were cut off with a loud yawn. “Maybe the people need a hero to save them.”
</p><p>“Sometimes, people have to be their own heroes,” she told him, with a sad sort of smile. She lifted him into her arms, and rose out of the seat. She walked down the hallway—the tent was enlarged by magic to the size of a small home—and took him to his bedroom. He clambered out of her arms and into his bed, and Aster pulled up the blankets to tuck him. “Sometimes, people have to stop looking for some idol or magical solution to come save them, and pick themselves up of the ground and learn to fight to make things better. No one else can do it for them.”
</p><p>But Teddy was already asleep. 
</p><p><i>My poor baby,</i> she thought, feeling choked up. He looked so happy and carefree when asleep, like nothing bad in the world could touch him. She felt her heart clench tight inside of her, and she swore to herself that she would endeavor to keep as carefree as she could for as long as she could. 
</p>
<hr/><p>The winds calmed and the sands fell away, the sun dipped down from the sky and sat upon the edge of the horizon. Aster exited the tent leaving Dobby with the instructions not to allow Teddy or anyone else outside. There was a knot that twisted in her gut, a feeling that strange things would soon be happening. The guards that patrolled the area had been convinced she was an archaeologist due to forged papers. Bill had went through some of his contacts to get her a false identity set up as a curse breaker, and so she was allowed to roam the pyramid site without trouble for the most part. She slipped her red rounded sunglass over her eyes, and adjusted the hood of her sleeveless jacket that had a white tank top underneath. She had on light grey kakis that went down to below her knees and tan steeled toe combat boots, that had a hidden pocket along the side of it to store small items. She had adopted mundane clothing for this venture (she had always mixed up her wardrobe with mundane and wizarding apparel much to the Wizarding World’s consternation), because sometimes robes were entirely impractical. 
</p><p>Especially when someone was going to go tomb diving. 
</p><p>She had already ventured into the smaller two pyramids two days prior, so now she had only the pyramid built for the Pharaoh Khufu (or Cheops, as he was also known by), and made her way past the Sphinx, that thankfully did not ask her a riddle. It once had been like the Sphinx in the maze during the Tri-wizard tournament, but the magics that brought it to life were no longer there. It was merely a statue now. She made her way to the south side of the largest pyramid—a seventh wonder of the world from what she had read—to the opening that led deeper into the resting place of one of Egypt’s most notable pharaohs. She walked up the path built by the locals, and archaeologists from a previous dig, and made her way to the opening. It was a tunnel, dark and filled with shadows, and Aster cast a glance over her shoulder to make sure no guard got curious enough to follow her before she held out her hand.
</p><p>“Lumos.”
</p><p>A ball of light appear hovering her palm, and it flickered for a moment while Aster struggled with the wandless casting before finally it settled. She released out a small breath, happy that her wandless casting was progressing nicely. She had dedicated herself to studying magic and theories after the war, the weight of how many they had lost rested on her shoulder. If she had learned more, done better, perhaps so much could—Aster shook her head, dismissing the thought before it could lead her down a dark path. The moments of helplessness that had been saved by sheer dumb luck echoed in her memories, constantly and she had to get better. She had to be able to protect the people most precious to her now, she had lost too many to Death and lost to many to apathy already. She wasn’t willing to lose anymore.
</p><p>The temperature lowered the further and further she followed the path down into the depths of the tomb, but there was something else. There was a chill that wasn’t quite natural that vibrated through the walls, though Aster couldn’t put her finger on exactly what it was. She bypassed the ascending passage way, knowing what she sought laid down the descending path towards the subterranean chamber. That’s when a sudden wind burst up from the depths where <i>no wind should be coming from</i>, and Aster for a split second saw what appeared to be a humanoid shape shambling towards her from the darkness. There was an unnatural crack of power—of magic and her light was extinguished.
</p><p>Panic prickled at her scalp, and she lowered herself to the ground, bending her knees prepared to fight or flee. She held her breath tight in her lungs, and strained to listen to the scrap of footsteps making their way up the tunnel towards her. A smell of death—just a trace nitre—wafted up towards her, and as her eyes struggled to adjust to the sudden darkness, making her wish that she hadn’t just had the runes expert correct her eyesight. She wanted to add runes that could help her see in the dark and give her an enhanced sight, but to apply so many runes—especially given how fragile eyes were—could be dangerous. By the time, her eyes were healed enough to undergo more runes, they had to flee from London. After several heartbeats, she saw the slight outline of the thing stumbling towards her.
</p><p>Taller than her by a few feet, but thin and emaciated, and wrapped in <i>bandages.</i> A hysterical laughter bubbled up in her throat and she bit her tongue so hard it drew blood in effort to choke it down.
</p><p>A mummy. There was a fucking mummy of all things!
</p><p>It was so cliché, and yet she hadn’t expected it. There had not been any signs of an active curse that she had seen anywhere in the pyramids. Curse breakers had been employed decades ago to make old tombs like these accessible for the mundane, after the whole trouble with King Tut’s tomb had almost exposed the magical world. <i>So what…or who woke the mummy up? Who could animate it in such a manner?</i> Aster thought, with rounded eyes. 
</p><p>Necromancy was not possible, for all the feats magic could create. So that left one possibility that made her tremble from head to toe, and she swallowed the knot wedged painfully in her throat. She slipped her wand out of its holster when a ball of blue fire came flying at her. Aster let out a startled squeak and darted out of the way, and was thankful she did not wear robes! If she had then she would be on fire right!
</p><p>Her palm scraped against the rock in an effort to steady herself and kept from tumbling down into the darkness, and she rolled to her feet after a moment, hearing the undead creature sped up towards her. She pointed her wand when a hardened and mummified hand wrapped around her throat, the joints cracking with sickening pops. It was surprising how much force the mummy had, an inhuman strength that choked her and kept her from being able to drag in another gulp of air. She could see the face swirling above her, desiccated and a horrible parody of a human face. She pointed her wand and thought of fire, the burning inferno and the color of the flames. A shower of embers erupted from her wand shortly followed the <i>woosh</i> of flames, and the mummy let out an inhuman shriek that made her cringe backwards.
</p><p>It caught aflame like wood, the bones creaked and dried flesh snapping. Aster felt bile rush up the back of her throat, and she planted her foot against the mummy’s chest and kicked out with all of her strength. It tumbled backwards, the thuds and smacks of its body against the stone echoed up the passageway. It landed just at the end of the tunnel, just barely in her site and she stayed completely still until finally it stopped moving. “What the fuck?” She cursed, narrowing her eyes in anger. “Who the hell—”
</p><p>Coldness swept across her skin, possessively and tauntingly, and Aster turned her head to meet the eyes of Death who passed by. She had only glimpse him once—one time before she had been swept away to the mystical white train station after Voldemort had killed her with the killing curse—and the second time was nearly as jarring as the first. He was cloaked in moving shadows and tattered old fabric, with a face rotted away so much that it held no features. Only a skull with strips of putrid fleshing spattered across it every so often, and towered over impossibly tall. The bottom of his scythe scraped against the of bottom of the passageway like nails on the chalk board, and then next moment, she blinked.
</p><p>Death was gone.
</p><p>Every cell in her body urged her to rush back up the path and get the hell out of that pyramid, Aster had not been sorted into Gryffindor for nothing and she had faced death before, greeting him without fear. It was obvious that there was some sort of power play going on here and she knew in her soul what it meant—knew that as she stepped down into the lower chamber with the string of rope to guide her and not a spec of light that things were about to irrevocably change. The temperature dropped, cold and frigid as if she was cradled in the heart of winter instead of a desert tomb.
</p><p>The chamber was a decent size, she could tell from the echo her feet hit the bottom. Flames burst to life on torches mounted to the walls and three more mummies burst out from the walls and came charging at her. One swung a wickedly curved blade and Aster ducked to the side, just in time to avoid the sharp edge from slicing her head off of her shoulder. The blade clanged at the wall loudly, and the mummy howled like an enraged dog before lunging at her again. These mummies were pretty spry for being corpses. 
</p><p>“Protego!” She shouted out, erecting a shield to block an arrow launched at her by a mummy across the room. Releasing the shield, the arrow clattered to the floor and with a lightning fast swiftness, Aster swirled her wand around and jabbed it at the mummy. “Relashio!”
</p><p>The mummy with the bow went flying to one side of the room, and the bow went flying in the opposite direction. A movement out of the corner of her eyes was the only split second warning, Aster moved out of the way but not enough to fully escape the sharp blade slicing up the length of her back. It was only a flesh wound, not deep enough to do permanent or life threatening damage, but the burning pain rattled her. She stumbled backwards, feeling blood soak into her cloak. The warm wet sensation was uncomfortable and lulled memories of the war back to the forefront of her mind—<i>how she was rushing through Hogwards, the smell of death and ash hanging all around, body littering the ground</i>—
</p><p>She threw herself out of the way of the mummy’s oncoming blade only to have to scramble backwards on all fours when the second mummy slammed down a war hammer, cracking the floor where she had only been moments ago.  Blood roared in her ears and her heart slammed around her ribcage painfully, her breaths were coming in too short of gasps and the palm that held her wand tightly was slick with sweat. Her mind raced with thoughts, trying to untangle the past from the present and a vision of Teddy filled her mind, the first time she held her godson and she lifted her wand, “Expecto Patronum!”
</p><p>A stag made up blinding pure light burst forth from the tip of her wand, stomping forward using its antler to knock away and tear through the mummies. The mummies screamed and burnt upon impact with the light—meaning that Hermione’s old theory that the spell would work against undead creatures was true, thankfully—and soon the chamber went silent when the patronus brought its hoof down, crunching the last mummy’s skull. Aster sank back against the wall, and let out a tired and exhausted sight.
</p><p>Her patronus walked over to her, and carefully leaned its head down to knock forehead with her. She reached up with trembling hands, petting the sides of the deer’s face and whispered out, “Thanks, Prong.”
</p><p>The stag neighed, softly.
</p><p>Now that her patronus was up close, Aster could see that his shape was not fully formed. It was not that she casted a weak patronus, by any means, but it looked like the stag’s shape was…mushy. All wobbly and wibbly like it was trying to take a different form, but Aster couldn’t understand why. She had heard that patronuses can change if the caster has changed in a fundamental way. Had she changed so much that Prongs was no longer quite what her patronus should be? She wasn’t sure she liked the implications of that, but her life had taken a big turn from what it once was or what she thought it ever would be. The patronus faded, retreating back into her form and that’s when she noticed it.
</p><p>All sound ceased save for the thundering of her heart, and it was as if time itself had stuttered to a halt with beads of dust going still in the air and the flames on the torches went motionless, but still bright. In the center of the room, a shadow began to grow until it formed the figure that she knew as Death. A deep rattling chuckle that seemed to house a million screams reverberated through the room, and Aster felt her mouth go dry with panic. 
</p><p>Jewels clanked together, held on his ratty robes by invisible strings for none was as wealthy as the one called Death, who plane grew more ripe and populated with each passing minute. Dark muted colored jewels like sapphires and diamonds, nothing so bright like rubies or emeralds lest it ruining the dark intimidating presence he had. His face was more now, more flesh than bone and misty colored eyes peered out from the cowl of his hood. She didn’t understand why his appearance had changed, but for some reason it set her teeth on edge. Her fingers curled around her wand, picking it up off the ground. Still no spell or defense fell from her lips because what spell could be powerful to outwit death?
</p><p>“What do you want?” Aster asked, after finally finding her voice.
</p><p>“Death does not want nor desire anything,” Death replied, in a raspy voice that grated along her skin like nails on a chalk board. “It merely is.”
</p><p>Aster narrowed her eyes. “If that were so then we wouldn’t be here, at all, now would we? If Death merely is then why do you interfere? With the Pervell brothers, with me after Voldemort killed me, and here now?” She demanded, hotly. 
</p><p>Death hummed, the sound like cracking bones and ripping skin. “A leash has two ends, My Master,” he commented, his bony hand twisted his scythe ever so slightly that the blade caught the light of the torches and gleamed dangerously. “The holder and the chained, they both push and pull, always testing boundaries.”
</p><p>Aster felt her soul jarred brutally inside of her. She flinched back, as if physically struck by his words and clamored to her feet unsteadily when Death took two steps towards her. “I am not—” She choked on the words in fright, in panic. The gravity of what he implied hit her like a ton of bricks and she felt her skin go clammy with sweat. “I am not your master! I lost the stone and I destroyed the wand!”
</p><p>“Oh?” Death seemed amused, his eyes glanced to the wand she held so tightly. “Then what is that in your hand?”
</p><p>Aster felt her brows furrow into a knot, before she too glanced down. A sound of shock tore out of her mouth, and she dropped the Elder wand like it had burnt her. She didn’t understand! What happened to her regular wand? How had she gotten the Elder wand, whole and intact? Her pulse hammered in the base of her throat and she felt like she couldn’t breathe. Her head felt woozy from blood loss, and her back screamed in agony from where the mummy had gotten her. Still she refused to cave to the darkness fluttering around her vision, and gritted her teeth together tightly. “What do you want?”
</p><p>“A better questions is…what do <i>you</i> want, Miss Potter?” Death questioned, his head cocking to the side after his neck gave a nauseating loud pop. “What do you get out of preforming a ritual so old that it is better lost to time? To align the ancient magics of the ley lines for your personal use as if you have the right to change your fate?”
</p><p>“My fate is mine to change however I see fit,” Aster shot back.
</p><p>“That’s a naïve notion and you are well aware of it. If that were true then you would have never been taking from your home, your world and then placed in a position to be branded with the weight of a prophecy now would you? Your fate has never been in your control, Aster Potter,” Death laughed, shrilly that made her blood congeal like ice in her veins. 
</p><p>“It is now,” Aster hissed, defensively. Oh, how his words hit her where she was vulnerable. Dumbledore had set up events, and she had followed the yellow brick road so blindly. She had been so blinded by the thought of magic, of belonging that she never stopped long enough to question things around her. She had been so desperate for friends and family, she never stopped to consider that maybe some of the friendships and relationships she had were unhealthy. Even in her fifth year after Sirius’s death, how long did she stay angry with Dumbledore? How long did she question his motivations? Instead, that had all been shoved down into a tiny box and locked away in favor of her trying to find a way to kill Voldemort and his hocruxes. “I am making my own path, and no one will get my way. Not even you, Death.”
</p><p>“Is that an order, or a request?” Death asked, lightly.
</p><p>Aster hesitated. Could she order him to leave her be? Could she order him out of the way? It all left a sour taste in her tongue, the thought of being someone’s master. She recalled how the Dursleys treated her; like a servant on the best days, and a slave on the worst. She never wanted to be anyone’s master, never wanted to treat another person in that fashion. “I am not your master. I will not order you about,” she decided, with a shake of her head. 
</p><p>“So a request…how novel,” Death commented, once again seeming entirely too amused by the situation. “Most people make demanded, you know. For more time, to be spared, but none have the power to sway me except you and you don’t even intend on using that power.”
</p><p>“Some power is too great, too awful to use,” Aster replied, after a moment. Gathering up her courage, she stalked past him and towards the center of the room. The runes to align the last pyramid with the ley line and allow the power to flow were hidden from the naked eye. Only someone who had studied runes would know where the secret was hidden, but before she could past Death, his free hand wrapped around her upper arm. It was like being touched by a blizzard, impossibly cold and biting, and she jolted. Her head snapped towards Death and looked at him, fear bright in her green eyes. 
</p><p>“But you intend to use this power, the power of ancients to unravel fate? How is that any different?” Death demanded, maggots falling out of his jaw as the rotten flesh flapped about around his jaw. He got right up in Aster’s face, and it took all the willpower in her to not cringe back from the killing intent that leaked off of him. Fear sliced her down to the marrow of her bones, but she tilted her up her chin defiantly nonetheless.
</p><p>“Dumbledore used it to steal my life—the life I would have had with my birth parents, so me using it now to get back would be setting fate right,” Aster stated, her voice sharp like the crack of a whip.
</p><p>“Perhaps that would ring true if you were not playing with more fates than your own, or do you forget your godson whom you intend to take with you, as well as you faithful little group of house elves?” Death grinned, viciously. She didn’t know how she knew he was grinning, he had no lips to imply that he was grinning, but she could feel it in the magic pouring off of him. “Life is a balancing act, Miss Potter. How do you intend to tip the scales to keep them safe through the passage back to your home world?”
</p><p>Aster faltered, at a loss. She had no quick reply, or answer to give the smug Death. Instead, she felt horror growing in a cold knot in the pit of her stomach and she drew in a shuddering breath. Her eyes turned away from his, unable to bear the stare that bore into her soul and her eyes fell upon the Elder wand that rested quietly on the stone floor where she had dropped it. It was like a light bulb went off in her mind, and she looked back at Death. “The Hallows,” she whispered out. “I will give you back the Hallows. Whatever makes me the Master of Death, you can have it back. You can be free of me, if you can help me balance the scales to help them get through.”
</p><p>If Death was surprised, he did not show it. “So you would choose to live everything you’ve known behind, all your friends and loves ones without a second thought?”
</p><p>“I’ve had second thoughts. I’ve had third ones, and fifth ones, but the circular argument always comes back to this choice,” Aster said, feeling heat rising to her cheeks. She felt angry and defensive that Death was judging her like she was a cold-hearted bitch that had little to no regard to the people she would be living behind when it couldn’t be further from the truth. 
</p><p>“And still you toss away their loyalty and friendship.”
</p><p>“They are the ones who tossed it away first!” Her shout echoed loudly off the walls, and her green eyes started to glow with the rage building inside of her. “I shouldn’t have to fight or beg to be loved or accepted by people who are supposed to have my back! I shouldn’t have to prove myself over and over again to the people who claim to know me the best! Why I do have to constantly prove myself? Why am I never enough for them? Why can’t I <i>just</i> be Aster?” It was like a dam had been broken and all these words came tumbling out of her mouth, and she had no way to stop them now. She stared at Death through the tears in her eyes, with months upon months of emotions that she held back unleashed like a maelstrom through the room. Ancient vases were cracked and shattered while a vicious wind threaten to blow the torches out, and the ground beneath her feet trembled. “Family is supposed to lift you up, not bring you down. Love is not supposed to be conditional or detrimental, it’s supposed to acceptance and warmth and kindness. Do you when the last time I felt such kindness from the people who supposedly had my best interests at heart?”
</p><p>Death stayed still and silent.
</p><p>“And do you know what’s worse? It that I want to hate them, but I can’t,” Asher shook her head, scalding tears pouring down her cheeks. Her hands clenched into tight fists at her side, and her chest heaved fiercely with each gulp of air she drew inward. “They were my family. The people that I fought so hard to protect and I still love them, even though they couldn’t accept me in the end. I can’t just shut those feelings off. It wasn’t easy to come to the realization that it was better to be loathed for who I am, then to be loved for who I am not, and I burned my bridges—so many of them, and it hurts. But staying would hurt more in the long run. And I—” She cut herself off, realizing that her entire body was shaky from head to toe with her sobbing. She felt that she had been brought low by her emotions, and scraped raw from the inside out. She took a few second to steady her breathing, and her nails bit into the palms of her hands. “And I want to…<i>live,</i> not just survive. I don’t want to just be living, to go through the motions like walking through a daydream, either,” Aster told Death, with a watery and sad laugh. “I want to live, love, know happiness, and know that I have a place to belong.”
</p><p>“Fate will never give you a normal life, Aster Potter,” Death warned her, his tone sharp and callous. “You were never mention to fade into obscurity, not even in your birth.”
</p><p>“I don’t need normal,” Aster countered, wiping away her tears. “I just don’t want to feel like I am spending the rest of my life screaming on the inside. I want a place where I thrive, where my son can live and be happy. And I will go to whatever lengths I have to ensure that, even going to another world to do so.”
</p><p>“Why are you so eager to go back to a world you do not remember? Are you so certain that you will belong there? Find that missing piece?” Death questioned, with a p&gt;tilt of his head. The meat of his cheek flapped to the side, hanging on by a tiny piece of sinew. “What makes you so sure that you cannot find that missing piece here?”
</p><p>Seconds ticked by like eternity, Aster’s brows furrowed into a deep knot. 
</p><p>“Maybe I could,” Aster whispered out. “But as the way things are now, with the Ministry trying to brand me a villain and what will surely follow, I don’t want to spend the rest of my life running. I don’t want Teddy to have to grow up always looking over his shoulder waiting for the next attack. So yeah, maybe I could try to find a place to belong, maybe I could try to let bygones be bygones will my old friends, but it comes at too high of a cost. I’m not willing to sacrifice all that I am just for someone’s conditional love. After everything I have been through,” she stated, with a fierce expression and looked Death straight in the eye, “I deserve better than that. So does my son. So are you willing to take the Hallows and help me or not?” 
</p><p>Death stared at her with his beady eyes. “How far are you willing to take this mad quest of yours?”
</p><p>“However far it takes.”  
</p><p>Death released her arm, and slowly the ghastly visage of his faded away into that of a man in his forties with hawk like eyes that were the color of obsidian and pale skin as white as snow. His brow was prominent and strong, with an aquiline nose and high cheek bones. His lips were thin and straight line, as if he did not smile often. His tattered robes became like midnight blue silk, and the gemstones glittered, polished and uncracked. His simple scythe became more innate, with silver runes carved into the wood that glistened like black glass. “You passed,” Death told her, his voice soothing like the sound of rainstorms and gentle thunder. It held no screams or agony in it any longer.
</p><p>Aster reeled back, shocked by his words and transformation. “W-what?”
</p><p>“I had to be sure that you would not use or abuse the Hallows, give into the temptation that has been plaguing you. That you truly would give up such power rather than use it,” Death commented, a flicker of a smile on his face before his expression grew somber. “I do not need the Hallows as payment to see you and yours across safely to the other side. A single memory from each of you shall be payment enough, but I get to choose what memories I take from you and yours.”
</p><p>Aster was flummoxed, her mind racing a mile a minute. “So the spell will succeed?”
</p><p>“Of course, it will. Fate has always favored you, Miss Potter, like a mother does a child.”
</p><p>“Forgive me,” Aster smiled was strained, “but is Fate has favored me like a mother all these years, then I have to say she needs lessons in parenting.”
</p><p>Death snorted, lightly. “When the eclipse occurs in two nights, return here with all your possession and your brood,” the ancient being stated, with a dismissive wave of his hand. “That is when the ley lines power will be at its height.”
</p><p>And Death was gone, and time spun forward once more.   
</p><p>Aster stayed rooted to the spot for nearly five minutes before she weakly went about finding the runes to tune the pyramid into the ley lines, and after thirty minutes, she returned to her tent. Dobby nearly had an aneurysm when he saw she was wounded and he rallied all the house elves, who immediately all went into mother hen mode. They weren’t going to let her get away with doing anything on her own for the foreseeable future, she just knew it.
</p>
<hr/><p>Two days later, Aster was making breakfast—or attempting to, while Winky kept taking things from her and saying, “No, Mistress. Winky can do this, Mistress should rest.” 

</p><p>Aster was too tired to protest and relinquished the bowl of pancake mix without a fuss. Who had known that the skittish elf from years back would gain a spine of steel and a glare that would send even a dragon fleeing in terror? 
</p><p>The withc mused quietly to herself about her mismatched group. The house elves had been brought to her by Dobby over a year ago; elves had long since suffered under the heel of oppression in the Wizarding World for centuries, and after the War, after the Sickness, magical beings such as they were easy targets for misplaced anger. When she learned that the elves just wanted a new and better life, trusting that she could help them in her endeavor had touched her heart. It was a lot of faith and trust placed in her hands, and she felt a responsibility to do right by them. For now, she hired them to care for the camps and supplies, allowing them to save up gold and more in order to have a good footing for whatever came next. Whatever did happen, she had counted each of them as friend. 
</p><p>Aster sat down in her chair at her desk when the mailbox on her desk shuddered. Sitting up straighter, Aster pulled it open to find new letters inside. It was a transportation box that Luna had developed. It was safer than sending an owl that could intercepted along transit. She checked for any nasty spells attached to the letters, cautious about anything and everything.  When no red flags were raised, she ripped the first envelope open and took out the parchment to read.
</p><p>
  <strong><i>Lady Aster Potter-Black,</i>
</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p><i>Firstly, I must apology. I know how much you despise to stand on ceremony and titles, but pureblood manners are too deeply ingrained in me to not address you properly in correspondence. I am relieved to hear that you are doing well, and that you have made great progress in your research. You were wise to leave England, to be honest. The chaos here is covered by a thin veneer and it is cracking with each and everyday. The Ministry held a charity event which was more a farce than anything well intended, and things quickly spiraled out of a hand. Susan Bones is head strong and determined to not be forced into this marriage law, much like yourself, but was attacked by an older wizard whose name I cannot recall. He was quickly apprehnded by Draco Malfoy and his fiancé Daphne Greengrass. It was discovered that this man was kidnapping witches with prominent background and bloodlines, and selling them to the highest bidder. His store was raided by one of my associates and he found stocks of fertility potions, love potions and more. It does not take a genius to realize that this operation is nothing more than a way to exploit young witches, and force them into becoming broodmares for whoever has the coin or influence.</i>
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>I do not have high hopes that the Ministry will pursue justice in this endeavor. The laws that they have pushed through and more that are waiting to be voted upon by the Wizengamot are horrific. The Sickness has brought out the worst of our society once more. Viciousness and selfishness comes more easy than kindness and compassion, but I do not write to you to cause your worries to grow. As terrible and bleak as things are, I would not have you come play savior to people who I do not think deserve such efforts. None of who understand would have you change the path you set for yourself, no matter how much you will dearly be missed. Some people can easily slip back into their old lives, some can find peace with normal things, but for others like us, there is just too many memories making it impossible to stay.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p><i>My grandmother is doing better. She is bound to a wheelchair much to her consternation, but is able to sit with Luna in the gardens and take her tea. I hope that Teddy is recovering his strength steadily, and doing better. Luna has said that you will be “on your way” soon, and I can only think that means that your plan will succeed. Where ever you end up, Aster, please do one thing? Be happy.</i>
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p><i>In Your Confidence,</i>
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p><i>Lord Neville Jonathan Longbottom</i>
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Aster felt tears swell in her eyes. She rubbed the spot over her chest where her heart was. It ached with an untold number of emotions, and she could appreciate Neville trying to give her a bit of peace of mind over her decision. He, too, had a hard time adjusting after the war enduring torture within the walls of Hogwarts and having to learn from the Carrows that Bellatrix Lestrange had gone to St. Mungo’s to finish the job she started on his parents. Neville had been shattered by it all, but Luna had been compassionate and had the patience of a saint. She stayed by him through the nightmare filled nights, the burst of anger and more. If anyone understood how hard it was to just go back and be normal, it was Neville.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>He had been one of the few that she had let see the letter that Dumbledore had left, and he told her that if he had one chance to see his family again, he would take it in a heartbeat. Neville and Luna had both known that she had felt like she belonged in the Wizarding World—or any part of this world for that matter—for a long time, and they encouraged her to do what was best for herself, instead of sacrificing her wellbeing for others who would never see how much she gave. People expected her to save them so anytime she put forth the effort to do good, it hardly matter in their eyes because it was her duty to do that. When she started isolating herself, people had been outraged and Rita Skeeter did a piece every time a crisis happened how the Girl-Who-Lived wasn’t there to save the day. It was a prelude to the Ministry’s bullshit.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Setting the letter down with a hefty sigh, Aster opened the second letter to find the beautiful and artistic calligraphy that could only belong to Fleur Weasley nee Delacour. Her eyes scanned over the letter about how Fleur was so happy that they were safe, and then gushed about her and Bill’s newborn baby, Jillian. She had inherited the Weasley red hair and Fleur’s blue eyes. The joyful tone of the letter turned sad where Fleur acknowledged that she knew that this was likely their last correspondence, and how that she was sad that they wouldn’t see each other again, but that she knew that Aster had to do what was right for her. She said Bill sent his well wishes, and warned her that the Ministry had started to vehemently search for her. Apparently, Minister Greengrass felt that if he could bring the Girl-Who-Lived to heel it would suppress the flames of rebellion that had started in the hearts of the oppressed. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Aster slid the letters into her desk drawer, and then rose up out of the chair with a pensive look on her face. She felt nerves—both good and bad—moved through her blood like a quickening, and she rubbed the back of her neck, her green eyes surveying how the house elves packed up the last bit of the furniture, shrinking it down to fit in a trunk. Unable to sleep last night, she had packed away much of the belongings and so now they only had last minute stuff to pack up now. She had already warned them about Death taking a memory from them, and they were a little bit afraid, but trusted her to let no harm come to them.  
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>It was a bit daunting. Packing up her belongings made it all real, Aster rubbed her arms as if to stave off a nonexistent chill and she smiled when she heard excited footstep rumbled down the hallway. She had only a split second warning before two tiny bodies leapt and latched onto her back, weighing her down and she stumbled dramatically to her knees. “Oh, no! I’ve been taken down by some ruffians!” She cried out, her voice stuttering with laughter. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“Did we get you?” Teddy asked, with his chin resting on her shoulder.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“Did we get you?” Flutterby parroted, her head popping out from underneath her arm.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Aster chuckled, then smirked broadly. “And now I’m going to get you,” she growled, fighting down her laughter when the two children let out squeak and then took off as fast as their legs would take them. She gave them time to find a hiding spot before she rose to her feet, and chased after them. They loved playing hide and seek, but there was a limited amount of spots for them to hide now given that almost everything had been packed away. She checked the bedrooms first, peeking into the closet and then the bathroom. Walking on the balls of her feet, she walked soundlessly across the vinyl flooring and reached out to grab the shower curtain. She pulled it back with a woosh and Teddy lunged forward to tackle her backwards to the ground, not able to accept defeat so easily.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Aster grabbed him before he could squirm away, and started to tickle him without mercy.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“M-mama!” Teddy laughed, uncontrollably. He squirmed, violently underneath her fingers tickling his sides. She only relented when he started to say he was about to pee his pants, and Aster ruffled his hair playfully, hugging him tightly. She gnawed on her lower lip, and prayed silently that she was doing the right thing—not only for herself, but for Teddy, hoping that she wasn’t making a big mistake by taking this leap.   
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“Hey, mama,” Teddy said, looking up at her with small and confused smile, as if he was thinking about something. “What was it like on your last day as a child?”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Laughter bubbled her throat, Aster ruffled his hair about. “Where did that question come from?” She asked, genuinely amused. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“I don’t know,” Teddy said, with a shrug.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Aster chuckled, but she really didn’t know how to answer his question. She wasn’t ever sure she had got to be a child, not really. “I don’t know, buddy,” she told him, softly. “I don’t think I really was paying attention to that while I was growing up.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Teddy accepted her answer, like all children with faith that an adult knew and understood best. “I’m never going to grow up. I want to be a kid and play forever,” the boy stated, with conviction. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“That sounds like a wonderful way to live,” Aster smiled, brightly. “Now get up and go get breakfast. I still have a little Flutterby to find.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“But can’t I help?” Teddy pouted.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“Breakfast,” Aster told him, pointedly. “You can play more hide and seek later.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Teddy sighed, with a mulish expression. “Fine.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>She watched her son run out of the room, and went on the hunt for Flutterby’s hiding spot now. She was smaller and able to hide in places that Teddy could not, but the little house elf couldn’t help to giggle when she saw Aster nearby so she was easily found. Or so Aster had assumed, but no matter which room that she entered there was no trace of a giggle. She was impressed in the beginning, but as time went on, a worry started to grow in the pit of her stomach.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Sometimes, she knew her cautiousness bordering on paranoia. It was a habit ingrained on her by the hardships she had endured. Anything that had could have gone wrong often went wrong in her experience and so Aster cheated, casting a “point me” spell. She watched the blue shimmering light appeared, hovering in front of her for a couple of seconds and then rushed forward, creating a trail for her to follow. Her heart stopped, when she watched the ball of light shoot out beyond the tent walls.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p><i>Oh, God, she’s outside.</i>
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>A million different fears and thoughts raced through her mind, and she rushed out of the tent without another thought. The desert sun was blinding and hurt her eyes, but she blinked rapidly to spot where the trail of magic led. Her heart dropped into the pit of her stomach when she saw the little house elf, sitting about ten feet up on the nearest pyramid with a fascinated look on her face. She stumbled across the sands on bare feet, feeling like her skin was boiling about to peel right off and rushed over as fast as her legs would carry her. She crawled up the large stones, and was halfway to the little house elf when something flew by overhead. Her head snapped up, thinking for a brief moment it might have been a plane, but it was too small and flying too low to be a plane. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p><i>A scout,</i> Aster realized, her blood turning to ice in her veins. It was Ministry scout flying on a broom, and while they couldn’t see the tent or its inhabitants, Flutterby and her were out in the open. When the scout came circling back around after shooting up a spell that cast a plume of smoke into the air, she knew that they had been seen. Aster cried out, “Dobby!”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Dobby appeared with a crack.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“Get Flutterby in the tent!” Aster ordered, her tone brisk with an edge of panic. “Tell the house elves to pack everything essential, leave what isn’t! Get inside of the tomb, and put up the strongest barrier you can muster until I arrive, alright?”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“But what about yo—”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“I’ll be fine,” Aster shook her head. “Just go.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Dobby didn’t hesitate, with a crack he appeared beside the baby elf and then disappeared. Aster summoned the Elder wand to her, having left her regular wand in the tent, and felt a trigger of alarm at how perfect it seemed to fit in the palm of her hand. She gnawed on her lower lip, wondering if Death would hold it against her now if she used the wand, but when she saw three more dots in the sky, she knew she wasn’t going to have a choice. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p><i>I just need to stall them until everyone is safe inside of the tomb, then I’ll get over and place so many barriers on the place that it’ll take them a thousand years to break in,</i> Aster thought, mentally planning. She jumped down off the last block of the pyramid when the four wizards reached her (no witches, <i>shocking</i>) and her green eyes narrowed into slits, glowing like acid when she recognized the one at the forefront. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“Aster Potter, drop your wand and surrender yourself immediately,” Ron Weasley ordered, from astride his broom about fifteen feet above her in the air. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Anger and disappointment boiled up in her soul, Aster glowered up at him. “How do you sleep at night? You may pretend that you have noble intentions, but you are no better than the Death Eaters who were hunting and locking away mundane borns during the war. How can you not see that?” She demanded, her lips twisted downward into a deep frown. Even now knowing that he had been a part of those that hunted her, Aster still hesitated throwing the worst spells she knew at him. She hesitated to give him the benefit of the doubt that they no longer reserved for her if they ever truly had. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Ron’s face twisted in a spasm, before his features hardened. “Look, I didn’t want to believe that you were dark even though you threw everyone that cared about you to the curb,” the red head stated, his tone leaked with frustration. “But then Ministry officials said you had gone back to Privet Drive, that you were messing with the Blood Wards—that’s dark magic!”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“So no one had a problem with Dumbledore using Blood Wards, but now that it’s me they want to paint me as a new Dark Lady?” Aster hissed out, darkly. She had the absolutely gutted feeling that burst through her right now. The blade of betrayal dug deeper than it had been before, and she looked at Ronald and couldn’t see a trace of the person she once called friend. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“You are no Dumbledore!” Spat one of the wizard’s flanking Ron.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>A bitter laugh escaped her before she could help it, and she pinned him with a blistering look. “You are right about that. I am no Dumbledore and I never would want to be,” Aster commented, with a smile that was sharp and all teeth. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw the tent blink out of existence right before the ward she put over it faded out of existence. They were now in the tomb, safely away from the battle and that meant Aster didn’t have to keep the kids gloves on. “Relashio Maxima!” 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>The spell burst out of the tip of her wand in a shower of yellow light that scattered, smacking the four Aurors and she watched with satisfaction as the wizards were flung off their brooms. “Accio broom!” She cried out, pointing her wand to the closest one. It zoomed and flew into her outstretched hand. She ducked underneath a <i>Flipendo</i> spell cast at her by an Auror, and sent one back at him, sending him head over heels down a sand dune. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>The rock nearby her exploded, shattering underneath a spell she did not recognize flung at her by Ron. The shards smacked and pelted her, and she summoned a shield to stop a large piece from striking her across the face. “Windgardium Leviosa!” She pulled a large stone free from the base of the pyramid and smashed it down on the three brooms lying idle in the sand, taking away any chance they had to chase her once she was airborne. “Give up now! I don’t want to hurt any of you!”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“Liar! We know what you really are, You-Know-Who!” Auror Halke—if she recalled his name right—shouted, tossing a cutting curse at her. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>She was so taken aback by what he just called her that she barely had the mind to dodge the spell. She hissed violently when it nicked her upper thigh, and used a combination of a wind and lighting spell to wrap the sand around his feet and turn into glass that held him in place. “What the <i>fuck</i> did you call me?” She demanded, absolutely livid.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“The Ministry knows all about the hocrux! How you took over Lady Potter’s body! You won’t get away with all the evils you committed!” Halke glared, a flicker of fear in his gaze. All the blood blanched out of his face when he realized he had Aster’s sole attention, but he still tried to be courageous in the face of whom he perceived as the most evil wizard of all time. “You won’t get away with the murder of the Girl-Who-Lived.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Aster was so mad that she couldn’t speak. With a sharp wave of her wand, she sent out a spell that blasted Halke out of the glass that imprisoned his feet and several feet back before he landed in a motionless heap on the sand. A silvery spell flew over her head and Aster rushed around the corner of the pyramid to act as a shield as she gathered her bearings. That meant two were down—the wizard sent over the dune hadn’t returned, so either he was out or he fled—and that meant there were two more to go. Heart hammering in her chest, Aster twisted her wand in her palm and knew that she had to end this battle fast. She could feel nausea pool up in her gut and the wound along her back ached with each trembling breath.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Closing her eyes, she braced herself before she rushed out of her cover. She tossed up a shield charm to block the incoming hex, and pointed her wand at the nameless Auror. “Brackium Emendo!” She whispered underneath her breath, watching as the man’s arm that the light hit went limp like a wet noodle. The broken completely disappeared, and she inwardly cackled. It seemed that something that Lockhart had taught had been useful after all. “Stupefy!” She added, after the man went hysterical over his limb and he fell against the ground out cold. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“Confringo!”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>An explosion hit right behind her and she was thrown forward harshly into the sand. She had to roll to dodge the cutting hex that would have severed her right in half, and that’s when Aster realized that this wasn’t a capture mission. This was a kill mission. Ron was here to kill her, and she stared at him with horror in his eyes. Something inside of her broken, cracked in the most painful way and she could barely breathe. “Ron, stop!” She pleaded, trying to get through to his better side. “I’m not Voldemort! You know the hocrux was destroyed! Why would you believe this lie? It’s ridiculous!”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“I won’t believe a word out of your mouth, snake!” Ron shouted, angrily. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“Expelliarmus!” Aster used her signature spell, and Ron wasn’t fast enough to dodge to the side. His wand went flying out of his grip, and lost to the sand when a great gust stirred the sands violently. “Ron…just stop this madness! You know how corrupt the Ministry has proven in the past! Things haven’t changed just because Voldemort is gone,” she continued, breathlessly. She was still trying to get through to him, and get him to see how wrong his misconception was. “I—I don’t want to fight you. Just leave, okay? Just tell the other Aurors I got away! If any part of you was my friend, please do this for m—”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Ron lunged at her, with a roar. Her body fell backwards, her head glanced the corner of a nearby rock and there was a fleeting moment where her mind went blank with pain. She felt Ron strike her across the face, and brought her knee up harshly to meet his family jewels. He made a choked pained noise, and Aster sprang clear, every muscle and limb twitching from the violence of her efforts. She stared down at the man who had been her friend with sorrow and disgust etched onto her features. “I guess you answered that, now didn’t you?” Aster whispered out.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“You—you bi—” Ron struggled to get out.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“Ron,” Aster stated, her tone surprisingly conversational, “eat slugs.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>A green beam flung off the end of her wand, striking him straight in the face. Aster turned her back on him, smiling grimly as she heard him start to retch up slugs and picked up the broom off the ground. She dusted the sand off of it before mounting it and soared into the air without a second look back. It was nothing like her Firebolt, but it got her over to the large pyramid in under less than a minute. She dropped to the ground, and tossed aside the broom carelessly. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>She was running up the ramp at full pace when a <i>confringo</i> spell crashed into the pyramid right next to the entrance. She slid to a stop, the railing clasped in a knuckle white grip and she slowly turned around to see Hermione standing there at the bottom of the ramp. Time ticked by at a snail’s pace with neither of them saying a single thing. “Look at the mess you made,” Aster clucked her tongue, looking at Hermione with a stoic expression on her face. “Somehow I don’t think the Egyptian Ministry of Magic is going to take too kindly to all the damage you and your cohorts have done. If they even know that you are here, which I’m betting they don’t.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>A twitch of Hermione’s lips—a subtle tell was all that Aster needed to know that her guess was right.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“You would have likely gotten away with it, you know? The ambient magic here is a great concealer for spells and such, but seeing how I am technically working here with the approval of the France and Egyptian Ministry, they do send guards to make sure the pyramids are in perfect condition so you probably should leave before they show up,” Aster lied through her teeth, with a sardonic smile written upon her lips. There were no guards—well, magical guards—that would inspect the damage any time soon, but she was tired of the fight. She got no real joy out of facing her former friends, just left with a bittersweet taste on the back of her tongue.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“I know what you plan to do,” Hermione stated, quietly.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Aster scrutinized her for a long moment. “Do you now? Good for you, Little Miss Know-It-All.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Hermione flinched back. “Don’t call me that.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“Why not? I reckon it is a far deal nicer than anything you or Ron have said about me lately given you think I’m the Dark Lord,” the Girl-Who-Lived smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. Her green eyes were dark and filled with shadows, filled with wariness as she watched every single move that Hermione made. Aster gave a harsh chuckle at the trace of guilt that crossed Hermione’s features. “Yes, I know. I am well aware that the Britain Wizarding World has gotten the strangest belief that the hocrux that was in my head,” she tapped the end of the Elder wand to lightning shaped scar that had healed up and was so light now that it could only be noticed if one was looking for it, “somehow turned me into the Voldemort.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“What were we supposed to believe then?” Hermione said, looking genuinely distressed. “It’s just that you haven’t been acting like yourself! You haven’t for years now, you’ve been shutting us out—”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“What you intend doesn’t matter, and I didn’t start shutting any of you out until you made it clear that you would never let me live my life unless it by your expectations. You wanted me to just bow down to the oppression being foisted upon us now like it isn’t the same thing that Voldemort did,” Aster sneered, looking down her nose at the other woman. She couldn’t comprehend how they couldn’t see the parallels to what was happening now to what was happening then.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“It isn’t—”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“<i>It is!</i>” Aster said, with a thunderous look. “It is the same hate, the same ideals, just dressed up in a different and more subtle package. How can you stand there and tell me any different? How can you as a woman and witch, a mundane born who is affected most of all deny how badly things have become?” Her voice became more shrill with each words, her dark hair swirled around her face like snakes and she resisted the urge to curse Hermione right on the spot. “We fought against tyrant before, watched people we knew and cared for die in the wake of it and in the aftermath, you would let another rise and take his place. If you all want to be blink sheep led to the slaughter, then you can go on about your way. But I’m done being led blindly and I’m done fighting for a world that never really accepted me.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“Never really accepted you?” Hermione blanched. “That’s absurd!”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“Is it, Hermione? Do you remember in Hogwarts, all it took was one rumor or one mishap and people were turn their backs on me in a heartbeat? But then I was supposed to just accept them back like nothing happened when whatever happened passed?” Aster countered, with a shower of red sparks spewing out of her wand with each word. She saw Hermione take a step back, as if the witch realized just how little control Aster had in this moment. “You and Ron—for all the support you have given—are the exact same way. I must live life as some kind of idol, expected to be this picture perfect image so people can feel better about themselves or the world they live in. Well, fuck that. Fuck all of your expectations.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Hermione looked near to tears. Her mouth opened and closed, her brown eyes flickered about as if she were searching her memories. “I…I…” Words failed her for more than a minute, and she drew in a shaky breath. “Maybe you are right. Maybe we don’t deserve you to come back and fix things, and maybe we pushed you away instead of you being influenced by darkness. But you can’t go through with the spell, Asher. Dumbledore had the Elder wand and decades on you in magic knowledge, you will die.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Her concern was genuine, but it was too little, too late. Aster stared down at Hermione with a dispassionate stare, and slowly lifted her wand so Hermione could see just what wand she held. The mundane born witch reeled back, shocked and baffled. “But—But—but you broke it—” She stuttered, pressing her knuckles to her lips. A realization passed through her eyes like lightning and she looked up at Aster. “That means—”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“The Master of Death,” Aster finished, grimly. “And more than capable of starting what I finish.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Hermione gaped, floundering for words.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“I’ll make you the same offer I made, Ron,” Aster spoke, her voice so low that it was barely audible. Each breath felt like she was swallowing broken shards of glass and she felt a couple of tears slid down her cheek, but she kept her gaze focus on the woman at the bottom of the ramp. “If you were truly my friend, then you’ll pretend I got away. You’ll leave me and mine in peace.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>A wind stirred the sand, shifting the tiny beads of gold as the sun beat down on the mercilessly. Three minutes stretched like eternity where both of them just stood, neither moving nor giving an inch. Finally, Aster turned her back on Hermione and made her way up the ramp when Hermione called out, “Wait!”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Aster paused, craning her neck to look over her shoulder at the woman.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Hermione licked her dry and chapped lips, her eyes filling with tears. There was so many words that she wanted to say, but she seemed unable to voice them. “Would you have taken us with you?” She finally asked, tears pooling down her cheeks. “You had made you choice to leave before…before the Sickness struck. I found your notes down in the research lab at Grimmauld Twelve. That’s how we knew you were in Egypt, but I never…I never told the Ministry why you were.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Aster stayed silent, giving no indication of her surprise.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“But…but if things hadn’t turned out the way they had…would you have taken us with you? Or would have still left us behind?” Hermione asked, her voice strained and tears rolling down her red cheeks.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Aster felt her shoulders sag with a great breath, her expression turned sorrowful and pained. “I would have taken you all with me, if you had wanted to follow me. I wouldn’t have left anyone behind, unless it was their choice,” she admitted, her voice cracking ever so slightly. “You were my family. There wasn’t anything I wouldn’t have done for any of you.” 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Hermione sobbed, burying her face into her hands.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>And with that, she walked into the entrance of the pyramid. A flash of light burst out behind her, and the ramp turned in invisible while the entrance to the pyramid looked like it had been sealed up behind the Girl-Who-Lived.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Hermione stood there, shaken and pale. Nearly twenty minutes had passed before she was jolted out of her shock by Ron’s hand falling on her shoulder, she saw the group of Aurors trailing behind him looking worse for wear. “Her—Hermione,” Ron said, looking very green. He pressed his hand to his mouth and gagged, and then released a sigh when nothing came up. “Hermione, what happened? You’re crying. Did…did he hurt you badly?”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p><i>He,</i> he said. Not she. Hermione could only stare at him with a grief stricken expression. “No…no,” she shook her head, wrapping her arms around her midsection. Her eyes looked down at the sand, with her wand shaking. “She…she was already gone by the time I arrived. I have no trace of her, or any of those that are possibly with her.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“You’re lucky,” Halke hissed, rubbing his bruised face. “That bitch did a number on us.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“Yeah,” Hermione whispered, nodding. “Lucky.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>She felt many things, but lucky was not one of them.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Night had fallen upon the desert and anyone searching for the Girl-Who-Lived had long since come and gone. Aster paced anxiously along the subterranean chamber, with a bloody and trembling hand pressed to her lips to stifle the urge to cry that crept up on her ever so often since the battle had occurred. Her eyes were wide and there was a wild look in them, like a wounded animal pushed too far and she tried to act normal for Teddy’s sake. She tried to act okay so the elves wouldn’t worry, but she knew that she was fooling no one. She chewed on her thumb, an anxious and nervous habit she had since she was child.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>She jumped nearly out of her skin when a little tug came on her sleeve, and she looked down to see Dobby staring up at her with big wide eyes. “Is something the matter, Dobby?” She inquired, after her heart settled down from the initial scare the house elf gave her. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“Dobby knows that Aster Potter has gone through a great deal as of late,” Dobby spoke, wringing his hands together. The small elf was fierce at times, having faced against Bellatrix Lestrange and barely surviving thanks to the healing magics that Aster had Madame Pompfrey teach her in sixth year. And then other time, he still held much meekness and apprehension ever after all this time. “Much more than is fair or deserved. Dobby just wants you to know that…we are here for you, whenever you need us.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Aster felt her expression soften. “Thank you, Dobby. I appreciate that. You and the other elves, you all have been remarkable and have had my back even when I’m not entirely sure I deserve such loyalty,” she said, with a small sad laugh.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“That’s—that’s absolutely gobblygook!” Dobby gaped at her, horrified that she thinks so lowly of herself. “Dobby has seen the great things that Aster Potter has accomplished! He has seen how much you have done for your friend, and all who lived in the Wizarding World, even for elves like me! Dobby saw how you tried to make things better, to fix things, but the bad wizards stopped you even after the war!”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Aster had tried to make things better for a time. Supporting politicians that wanted to usher in progressive change in the magical world, but her efforts were often scoffed at giving that she did not have a proper upbringing given she was raised by muggles—a derogatory term, she had learned that was only barely better than mudblood so she endeavored to never use it again. That had been shortly before she had received Dumbledore’s letter, and that started her to disillusion her to the world around her. To destroy the last bit of optimism that she had someone clung to all these years that once Voldemort was dead, everything would be alright.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“Dobby remembers something that he read…” The house elf stated, determinedly. “Holding on takes great strength, but it takes more strength to let go. Dobby knows how hard it is to let go of familiar things, even if they aren’t good for you. Things like the unknown are scary, even more scary when you think you are alone.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>A swell of emotion gathered in the middle of her throat, stealing her voice. She drew in a few breaths, too quick and labored, and then she managed a wobbly smile. “Has anyone told you, Dobby, that you are one of the most profound people I have ever known?” She asked, her voice bit watery. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Dobby puffed up with pride and blushed at the praise.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>The air in the tomb immediately shifted, and changed as shadows gathered around. Teddy stopped drawing in his notebook and he rushed to her, instinctively feeling the change. His heightened sense—thanks for Remus—had made Teddy able to pick up on things other children wouldn’t. The house elves moved around uneasily, with Twinkle picking up Flutterby and holding her close. Dobby stood in front of the group of elves at Aster’s side, prepared to fight and protect. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Death appeared, in his more human visage. It didn’t matter though, there was no mistaking him for a normal human. He had a powerful presence that seemed to envelope the entire room and press upon her mind like a weight. “It’s alright. He…he is here to help?” She sent Death a questioning look, half afraid that he would change his mind because she used the Elder wand.  
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Death slanted an amused look at her as if he knew her thoughts. “I am here to help,” the primordial being stated, with a low raspy laugh. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>The tension along her spine eased, and rubbed circles with her thumb on the back of Teddy’s hand where he clutched her hand so tightly. “Teddy, sweetheart,” she said, softly. Her godson looked up at her, his expression very still and quiet. “You remember when I told you that I had to do a big spell. I have do this right now, so I need you to go stand with Dobby and I’m sure Winky will let you hold her hand if you need to, alright?”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Teddy bit his lower lip like he wanted to protest, but nodded. He walked around behind her and shuffled over the elves, not looking at the scary man in the center of the room.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Aster watched her, heart tight in her chest. She retrieved the array capture from her bag and placed it in the center of the room where the ley lines and runes were all connected. The magic thrummed through the walls and floor, the vibrations almost like a song and she felt it call the magical core inside of her. Pricking her finger on a needle, she allowed three drops of blood to pour on the array and it crackled violently with bolts of electricity. She involuntary flinched back, but proceed to pour her magic into the array to mix with the remnants of Dumbledore’s. She poured more and more until she was starting to feel light headed, and the Death placed a hand on her shoulder, pulling her away. Her head bobbed, weakly. “Wha…?” 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“The point of opening this portal is to survive to see the other side,” Death told her, clucking his tongue in disapproval. Then with a great flourish of his hands, Death poured the remaining power into the array and on the far side of the room the runes flared so bright that it was blinding, and then a portal appeared, shimmering and beautiful. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Aster sank weakly to her knees in relief at the sight of it. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“As you pass through, a memory will be taken from you—a toil that is unavoidable,” Death reminded, carefully.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“What memories will they take?” Aster questioned.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“That is not for me to decide. It could be a memory of happiness, or one of sadness, or one of love, or one of heartache,” Death replied, vaguely. “But only a single memory will be taken, the rest shall be undisturbed. I will warn you that where you intend to go, that magic works far differently and your power won’t be accessible readily. It will take an adjustment before you are able to use your powers as you do now, without limitations and the house elves will live through the transition, but that doesn’t mean they won’t be unchanged by it.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Aster nodded, shakily. She walked over to the group, and looked at the sea of faces looking at her for answers. “Are you all absolutely sure about this? If you don’t want to come with me, you can go to Neville and Luna. They will protect you and offer you shelter,” Aster said, giving them a chance to change their minds. 
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Dobby looked back at them, then nodded decisively. “We intends to follow Miss Potter wherever she goes.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Aster smiled. “Thank you all so much.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Aster slung the knapsack over her shoulder, filled with immediate provisions and supplies while the trunks that had been shrunk down to palm size and had been cast with feather light charms hung tethered on by metal chains, looking like strange key chains. As the house elves gathered their own bags, she gathered Teddy into her arms and rested her forehead against his. “Are you ready?” She asked him, softly.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>“I’m ready, mommy.”
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>Aster knew he said those words, but there was no way a child of five could comprehend the irreversible choice that she had made for him. One day, she hoped that he would come understand why she did this. Turning towards the bright light, Aster caught Death’s gaze one last time and he inclined his head acknowledgement. She felt her heart pounding in her chest, and there were too many feelings swirling inside of her just to name one. She felt afraid, anxious, but relieved, too. So many contradictions fluttered around her inside of her head, and she clenched her eyes tight before she walked over to the portal.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>She could hear whispers, like voices and see blurred shapes on the other side. She couldn’t make out just what world sat on the other side, but there was a tremble in her soul—a resonating feeling like something was calling her home.
</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>And she stepped through.

The Sickness—is a magical plague, much like the bubonic plague. The reason that more purebloods were affected as opposed muggleborns is because of the inbreeding the Wizarding World oldest families. Inbreeding causes weaker immune systems, so it makes sense that if a magical plague were to happen that the purebloods would be most affected because of their need to keep their blood lines pure.</p><p>3.) Array Capture—a small metal disc made from metal—any metal that has the ability to transfer magic—with runes engraved on the front. Array Captures, are something I made up, and they are used to capture residual magic to cleanse an area. The array draws in the magic and holds it until it can be safely used or dispelled elsewhere. Can also be used on armor or buildings to draw in opponents magic, but dark spells breakdown the array, wearing it down and it’s useless against the Unforgivables.</p><p>4.) PTSD—I feel Aster (female Harry) would have some form of this after an abusive childhood (even if the abuse wasn’t physically, it was still emotional and neglectful) and then her time at Hogwarts was filled with several dangers and the war. No psych evaluations or therapy done after the many dangers she has faced, that would mess up a full grown adult let alone a child who went through it in their developmental years. Add on top of that, Aster is the kind of person who has a self-sacrificing attitude. She has a need to help people even if she is leaving with Teddy, that instinct was still there but she put it aside to put Teddy first like Lily and James did for her.</p><p>5.) Ley Lines—are what many believe to be a grid of earth energies circling around the globe, connecting important and sacred sites such as Stonehenge, the Egyptian Pyramids, and the Great Wall of China.</p><p>6.) Protego Totalum—a protection spell that can be used on a dwelling or area. It classified as a charm, and it’s purpose is to shield an area and protect the people in it.</p><p>7.) Lumos—a spell that acts like a light to see in the darkness. A magical flashlight if you will.</p><p>8.) Incendio—a spell that conjures up flames.</p><p>9.) Protego—a shield spell that is used to protect the conjurer from spells or attacks.</p><p>10.) Relashio—a jinx that can force an object or person to release their hold on something. It will cause the subject to be forced away from whatever they are grasping. (Relashio Maxima is a stronger version of the spell that can be used against a group of enemies, as opposed to an individual.)</p><p>11.) Expecto Patronum—to protect against Dementors by summoning one’s happiest memories. (And in the canon of this fic also can harm the undead, since they have similarities to Dementors.)</p><p>12.) Accio—a summoning spell. Caster must say ‘Accio (object they wish to summon’ and the object will come to them. Requires a great deal of concentration and focus.</p><p>13.) Flipendo—a standard attack spell that blasts an opponent away.</p><p>14.) Windgardium Leviosa—a charm used to make objects fly.</p><p>15.) Brackium Emendo—removes the bones out of limb that the spell is directed at.</p><p>16.) Stupefy—a spell that stuns an enemy and renders them unconscious.</p><p>17.) Confringo—creates a small explosion where the spell lands.</p><p>PLEASE COMMENT AND LEAVE KUDOS!</p>
