    <hr/><p>After a long day working on next week's homework, Hermione Granger decided she had enough potion ingredients in her head for the evening. In fact, she pretty much had enough of it for the remains of the school year. Ever since Professor Slughorn came back for the position of Potions Master at school, he seemed to be having a lack of discipline for the subject, and the classes had a tedious and boring turn. <em>He's</em> <em>just</em> <em>getting</em> <em>old</em> Hermione thought, <em>and</em> <em>since</em> <em>Professor</em> <em>Snape</em> <em>died</em> <em>at</em> <em>the</em> <em>battle</em>, <em>they</em> <em>haven't</em> <em>found</em> <em>a</em> <em>decent</em> <em>replacement</em>.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, she put her books back inside her bag, and as she got ready to leave the library, her eyes spotted movement in the school grounds visible from the window next to the table. She moved closer to the window, and while her eyes adjusted to the view, she saw a wizard and a witch hugging or rather fondling each other near a big tree.</p><p><em>Draco</em> <em>Malfoy</em>. Hermione's eyes narrowed when she recognised the familiar silver blond hair and tall figure. He looked relaxed and unchanged, just as if the war never happened. Without meaning to, Hermione stayed a second longer watching throughout the window, and as if sensing someone was watching, Draco turned his head towards the library windows and spotted her. Draco noticed her looking, and with the snobbiest smirk, he could muse, he looked straight up the window where Hermione was, and grabbed the girl's fanny with a hand and then lounged in for her neck. <em>For the love of Merlin, could he be any less classy? No, scratch that, any less barbaric? </em>Hermione thought, revolted by the scene she just experienced.</p><p><em>Out of the whole generation, why did he have to be the one returning?</em><br/>
After Kingsley announced that any student who was in the seventh year during the war was exempted from doing their N.E.W.T.S, and had the right to apply to any job without having them, almost no student returned to Hogwarts to re-do their last year. Naturally, Hermione was utterly against the idea and refused to leave Hogwarts without first finishing school properly. Harry and Ron tried to convince her numerous times over the summer to drop her idea to return, but after the twentieth time she turned them down, they gave up, but not without first telling her she was mental for doing it.</p><p>"<em>There's someone else innit?" Ron had told her a day before she returned to Hogwarts.</em></p><p>
  <em>"No, Ronald. There isn't." She'd told him with a sigh, rolling her eyes, "As I've told you before if I want to join the Investigation Department and help you Aurors, then I'm going to have to sharpen my arithmancy skills. And yes," She said before Ron could retort, "I <strong>know</strong> I can have the position right now if I wanted, but how am I going to serve any use as a decent strategist if I haven't mastered the basics? I'm staying Ron, and if you want to keep on with this, then you can't argue with me about this decision, whether you like it or not,"</em>
</p><p>The truth was, Hermione had meant to end her short relationship with Ron before the year started (it wasn't going anywhere), but something inside of her stopped her from doing it at the last minute before departing to Hogwarts. Pity? Guilt? Hermione had yet to resolve her decision to continue with her so-called relationship with Ron, but for the time being, she was glad she could rest from it all while at school. That is, she could rest from it all at school as long as she didn't have a run-in with Malfoy. They were at the brink of Easter holidays, and Hermione couldn't wait for a second longer to stay away from the twat who also went by the name Draco Malfoy.</p><p>After Hermione decided she wanted to go back to school, McGonagall, now as headmistress, was not only excited for her return but also glad to inform her nothing would please her most than to name her Head Girl. But Hermione's excitement over the position lasted short, for when she entered the train's Head Boy and Girl compartment, the face of Draco Malfoy greeted her with an unwelcome sneer and a sarcastic look. "<em>You better stay out of my way Granger, I don't want any trace of Mudblood scum near me or any of my things."</em> He'd told her back then and Hermione, while trying to be polite at most and ignore him in every way possible, went straight to McGonagall first thing when they had already settled in the castle.</p><p>"<em>I</em> <em>can't make any changes, I'm afraid. Draco Malfoy has to stay in the position of Head Boy, it is not only for his safety, but it is also a test from the Ministry."</em></p><p>
  <em>"But can't the Ministry see he hasn't changed? Right then on the train, he called me a Mudblood! It felt like the past year never even happened! It felt as if I wasn't tortured right in front of him in his drawing-room while Harry and Ron were held captive in their dungeon! It felt as if Voldemort was still alive!" Hermione exclaimed, furious he was granted a position he didn't deserve and the fact they now shared a common room and a bathroom.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Minerva only looked at her with remorseful eyes and said, "I know Hermione. And I know Mr Malfoy doesn't deserve this position, but the Ministry wouldn't let me do otherwise. It's one of the main conditions he has to do if he wants to avoid trial. That and, it was also Albus' recommendation." She said while diverting her eyes momentarily towards the defunct headmaster's portrait and gave Hermione a tight smile before saying,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I know this must be hard for you, Hermione. I also know you're still trying to recover your parents' memories, but I beg of you to be considerate and a little compassionate for Draco. You see, he's not only on the fine line between being accused of being an accomplice to Voldemort and being innocent, but he also lost his family, his friends. His father was sent to Azkaban, and his mother is on house arrest. And his friends, well I can't say if he had many, but most of them fled or went into hiding. I'm disappointed to admit it, but most of your Slytherin classmates' parents were Death Eaters."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I don't understand how someone who has lived all those things, could still be so rotten inside," Hermione said, looking down and away from McGonagall.<br/>
"I don't believe he is rotten." Minerva said, and Hermione shot her eyes back at her, "I assume he is just afraid. Afraid of what may come in the future not only for the wizarding society but for him as well. He's unprotected now. The resentment you have towards him; many of your classmates also share it. The position of Head Boy will grant him some security if there were to be any vengeance. It also grants him some time away from everybody and to think clearly about what happened and which side he is on. You might not know this, Hermione, but Draco Malfoy has been in and out from trials ever since the war ended." Minerva said, and Hermione only nodded in return, having remembered she had attended some of them. "What I meant to say is, even though Draco may seem the same as before, don't misjudge him. His defence against the world might be the only thing he was taught over the years; hatred."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I suppose you're right, Headmistress. But that doesn't mean he has the right to belittle me or anyone who crosses paths with him!" She said, her cheeks fuming with heat.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"No, he hasn't. But I only ask of you Hermione, to try and be polite with him this last year. Show him an olive branch he can reach to and hopefully make some change in him."</em>
</p><p><em>"I'll try," Hermione said with a small, defeated smile and turned to leave</em>.</p><p>But the olive branch Hermione tried to give Malfoy only lasted for as long as she next saw him that day in their new shared common room. Ever since the start of the year, it was well known in the student body the quarrels between Head Boy and Girl didn't turn in full-on fights because of their positions.<br/>
Every time Hermione tried to be civil towards Malfoy, he only responded with snide remarks and insults "<em>Fucking</em> <em>Mudblood</em>" He would whisper to her every time he encountered her in the common room whenever he went out or came in. At first, Hermione tried to ignore the name-calling and the nasty comments, but after a month of living together in the small confined space, she also started with the name-calling and hateful retorts. After months went by, their heated arguments, and the belittling that happened whenever giving the briefing for the prefects decreased a little. They instead started to ignore each other and decided only to talk whenever it was necessary. Naturally, it was almost impossible to do it, and it was even more challenging to do, whenever Malfoy had visits coming over to his room.</p><p>The first time it happened, Hermione was returning from a trip from Hogsmeade; she'd bought a new book and couldn't wait to read it in front of her fireplace in the common room. When she reached their dorms, she opened the portrait and was surprised as well as traumatised to find Malfoy shagging the brains out of a Ravenclaw girl right in the middle of the room.<br/>
"What the <em>fuck</em>?" Hermione angrily screamed, and while the sixth-year girl tried to cover her modesty, Draco only stood up and with a smug look, and proceeded to put back on his clothes with all the patience in the world, making sure not to break eye contact with Hermione. After the girl finally left, Hermione was fuming with anger, "Care to explain yourself?" She said, and Draco merely told her unpreoccupied, "There's nothing much to explain Granger. I believe what you saw is what happened. Unless of course, you want me to go over details." He said and flashed her a wide grin.</p><p>Hermione's cheeks went redder. "No, I don't want you to go over details you disgusting prick, I want you to explain why were you shagging a girl in our common room! Not only is it against the rules to bring non-prefects here, but I believe it is strictly prohibited to-to <em>copulate</em> in school grounds!" She said and shut her eyes, trying to forget the image of what just happened.</p><p>"<em>Copulate?</em> No wonder why Weaselbee hasn't fucked you yet Granger. No one in their right mind uses the word <em>copulate</em> when referring to fucking." Draco said, and in her anger, Hermione turned her hand into a fist.</p><p>"Oh? Hit a nerve there eh, Mudblood?" He said, his grin growing, and he slowly got closer to Hermione, who only stepped further back from him and felt her wand in the pocket, just to be sure.</p><p>"Don't." Hermione said "Don't even think you're getting away with this Malfoy, I'm telling Headmistress McGonagall. Maybe you've had your fair share of getting away with things this year, but I don't think she will be as forgiving for this." She said smugly and turned to leave, but Draco was quicker than her. Grabbing her by the wrist, he spun her until her back hit his torso. His arm was around her so both her arms remained still in front of her, trapping her in place.</p><p>"And why," He said, whispering at her ear, "Would you think it's a good idea to tell her?"</p><p>"Because," She said, trying not to stutter, "Actually, I don't need to justify myself, you broke the rules and quite badly if I must say."</p><p>"I was truly enjoying myself before your little mudblood arse came in and ruined the fun." He said, tightening his grip on Hermione, making her slightly whimper, "But you know, I believe our precious Gryffindor princess was enjoying herself too." His words dripped with venom each and one of them, stirring Hermione to the core. Instead of trying and loosen herself from his iron grip, she couldn't help but stay in place, unmoving. "You're delusional if you think for a second, I enjoyed that grotesque view." She responded, gritting her teeth.</p><p>"Oh, but I do think you enjoyed it. I believe it even turned you <strong><em>on</em></strong>." He said, his lips almost touching her ear. "I know a lustful look when I see one, mudblood, and even when the other tart left the room, you still had that gleam in your eye, that ardent look I bet Weasley hasn't given you once." He said, his tongue barely caressing the outer shell of her ear. Hermione snapped to her senses and tried to pull off of him, "Get off Malfoy! You won't get away from it this time, not with your lies nor façades!" She said, and pushed with her back his chest, trying to break free.</p><p>"And for the record, I felt disgusted by your little scene. After my meeting with McGonagall, I will have to go to the loo and vomit."</p><p>"Don't kid yourself, Granger," Draco said, finally letting her go and gave her a superior look. "I know you won't go telling your precious Headmistress what just happened here."</p><p>"Oh? And care to tell me why?" She said, adjusting her skirt.</p><p>"I know you won't tell McGonagall a thing because of your nocturnal escapades." He said with a knowing look and Hermione turned white. No, she thought and narrowed her eyes at him. "You wouldn't" She replied, and he only laughed. "Oh, but, I would. Think I wouldn't know, but I'm a keen listener and an observer, and something tells me it's not for study the times I've seen you late at night with the Weaselette running around the castle, hiding from the teachers, or the times I've heard you enter with her completely pissed here.<br/>
"I also would tell McGonagall that I know of your precious Quidditch captain sneaking out now and then off school grounds and how you've helped her go in and out." He said.</p><p><em>Damn you, Ginny, I knew someone would find out sooner or later about it</em> Hermione cursed herself and started thinking about the possibilities if she told McGonagall, but Draco interrupted her,</p><p>"I know what you're trying to do there; stop it. It is very simple- you don't tell McGonagall what you saw here, and I may remember not to tell anyone about your weekly escapades." He said, and after a few silent moments of debating on it, Hermione exalted, said "Fuck <em>you</em>, Malfoy," pushing him away somewhat hard, and without looking back, went up to her dorm.</p>
<hr/><p>The Great Hall was already packed with students when Hermione arrived for dinner. It was rare to see it full of students ever since the start of the year. Many did not return to Hogwarts after the war had ended. Most of the Muggle-Borns were hiding, dead, or their parents did not think Hogwarts was a safe place to let them stay any further. And as for the rest, many did not return; they weren't completely assured the war was over and were too afraid. Others were in too much grieving to go back to normality. Almost every student knew someone who'd died in the war. Either way, the castle now looked even more significant than it previously did in comparison from other years, and dinner was the time where most students attended the Great Hall, the Slytherin table being the emptiest of the four.</p><p>Ginny was already sitting at the Gryffindor table and waved at Hermione to join her.<br/>
"How long have you been here for?" Hermione asked her and helped herself with some pumpkin juice and kidney pudding.<br/>
"Oh, not long. I'm finished though, but I'll make your company while you eat." Ginny told her with a smile, and without looking at her, instead, she was dolling herself up with a pocket mirror.<br/>
Hermione saw both her plate and cutlery were untouched, and the only things sitting on her place were her juice-stained goblet and a half-eaten apple. She sighed and looked over at Ginny with a stern face, "Ginny, again? I thought you told me this would end weeks ago!" She whispered at her, and the redhead looked at her guiltily.</p><p>"I know Hermione but-" She said and took both Hermione's hands in hers, "It won't be like before, promise. This is just… unfinished business." She said, and Hermione raised an eyebrow at her, not believing her words. "Unfinished business?"<br/>
"Oh, Hermione, come on!" Ginny whined, looking at her with puppy eyes. "I haven't gone there in weeks and is not like I'm doing anything illegal! I'm already of age, you know!"<br/>
"Yes, but you are breaking school rules, and you're with Harry! Remember?" Hermione said, not believing Ginny would do this without thinking about the consequences appropriately.<br/>
"Oh, Harry, Harry, <em>Harry!</em> That's all you ever talk about! Give me some rest here, Hermione! Sometimes I really do think you're more enamoured with him than you are with my brother! That's all you ever talk about, and it's no fun." Ginny said, and Hermione couldn't help but look at her with an incredulous look.<br/>
"What are you talking about? The only times we talk about him, or Ron is whenever they write to us, they're visiting, or when you go to these things! That's still cheating, you know?"<br/>
"Not if it's with a girl it isn't," Ginny said, not looking at Hermione and she sighed,</p><p>"Look, Ginny, it is. And I don't want to scold you or anything because you're my best friend and I know you're old enough to know what you're doing but -Harry is my best friend too, and I know I promised I wouldn't say a thing -it's not my place to tell, and I won't but, I don't want either of you to get hurt." Hermione said and sighed, "Besides, we already have Malfoy in our tails, and I wouldn't want him to find something else to further blackmails us about." She said, and Ginny looked at her with a conflicted look, "I know this may all look bizarre and wrong, but… I feel so <em>free</em> there, you know? The people I meet; it's all a different type of connection and… I don't know, I'm sure Harry has been fooling around lately, and this is just my way of coping with it." She said, picking on her apple and Hermione knew what she was talking about.</p><p>After the end of the war, many parties followed, and with them, firewhiskey followed too. Harry told Hermione that he had drunkenly kissed Luna, and by the time Ginny told her also about it, Ginny said to her she knew ever since the war ended, Harry had been acting strangely. She said to her that even though it all seemed innocent, she had too, seen them again together in Hogsmeade a little over a month after school had started. But it didn't look like Ginny was mad at Luna for what happened. In reality, even though she'd seemed upset at the beginning, Hermione later spotted them making peace with one another in the hall after it happened. Although, more than talking, it looked more like a snogging session.</p><p>"Anyway," Ginny said, snapping Hermione out of her thoughts. "I'll deal later with wonder boy; I would like to hear from you. You haven't mentioned my brother or said anything at all, unless you're complaining about him, in weeks. I mean, I know he is as boring as he gets but, is everything okay between the two of you? I know you wanted to dump him ever since you two practically started going out, but I don't understand why you haven't done it already." <em>Yeah</em>, <em>why</em> <em>haven't</em> <em>you</em>, <em>Hermione?</em></p><p>"I love him," Hermione said quickly without thinking, and now it was Ginny's turn to look at her with an are-you-serious? look.</p><p>"No, you don't. You just pity him, and you well bloody know you do."</p><p>"I can't leave him, Ginny." Hermione said with an apprehensive look, "Every time I want to do it, he finds a way or another to convince me I won't leave him. And I just-" Hermione stopped herself from saying further, ashamed of the real reason she hadn't left Ron.<br/>
"When you find yourself, someone who is really worth it, it'll be as easy as it is to cast a spell for you," Ginny said, and Hermione caught Draco coming into the Great Hall. She narrowed her eyes at him as he sat in the Slytherin Table; Ginny noticed this and in a lower voice said, "Did something happen today?"</p><p>Hermione looked away from Draco and shook her head, "No, just the usual." She said, "But at least I'll have to endure his face for only a bit more, once we graduate, I won't have to see the ferret ever again." She gave Ginny a tight smile, and while drinking from her goblet, she only replied, "If you say so".</p><p>She quickly glanced back at the Slytherin table and found Draco looking straight back at her, his silver-blue eyes unmoving, and he held a snide glare that made Hermione's skin crawl. The stare was so intense, she suddenly felt a dark twitch in her core move she couldn't quite explain. But she knew she didn't like it.</p>
<hr/><p>The morning after, Hermione walked back to her dorm from breakfast, ready to grab her things and meet Ginny near the clock tower entrance to go to Hogsmeade. When she reached the portrait to the Head Dorms, she found Draco was already inside the dorms, in the centre of the common room. Trying not to remember the horrible scene that had happened months ago, she decided to ignore him and went up to her room.</p><p>"Don't go so quick, Granger." Draco said without looking her way, and with a heavy sigh, she replied, "What do you want Malfoy? I thought the other day you said you'd pretend I don't exist for the rest of the year." Hermione said, rolling her eyes, and with a fake smile and in a sickly-sweet tone said, "Did you finally realise you can't live without me and decided to stop being a complete tosser?"</p><p>Draco frowned at her and went up to the stairs, only stopping a step below Hermione, towering her. "Don't think so fast, sweetheart. If I wanted, I could have you dead, you know?" He said, getting closer to her and she replied, unafraid, "So much for pretending I didn't exist. How long did it last? A Day?"</p><p>"Shut up Granger," Draco said, moving a bit back. "I called you because of this." He said with a letter on his hand, and Hermione snatched it from his hands, recognising the envelope. It was already opened. "How did you get your hands on it? I was waiting for this!" Hermione exclaimed, and stepped out from the proximity with the wizard to go down the stairs. "Why did you read it? This is personal! You had no right!"</p><p>"Don't get your knickers in a twist mudblood; you were accepted if that's what you wanted to know," Draco said, rolling his eyes, also coming down the stairs. "And your filthy letter was laying around with some of my letters that came in today. You know we receive correspondence here instead of the Great Hall."</p><p>"I already know that." She snapped, "I just wanted to know why you read it! It's none of your business!" She said with anger; she was furious at Malfoy for reading her letter even more than her excitement for being accepted.</p><p>"Because, Granger," Draco said, stepping closer to her. "It becomes my business when I'll work there too, as an Auror." He said with a devilish smirk, and Hermione looked at him with big eyes, realisation dawning upon her. <em>No</em>. She whispered, "You wouldn't dare," She said, shaking her head, and turning her back to him, "They won't let you do it. You're too dangerous to be trusted as an Auror. You were a Death Eater for Merlin's sake!"</p><p>"Try me, Granger," Draco said from behind her and Hermione turned with a deep scowl on her features. "I've proven my innocence throughout the year, and who better to work in the Auror Department than someone who knows how dark wizards think? You might think you'll see the last of me when we graduate, but if what the letter says is true, then we'll not only keep seeing each other, but we'll work <em>closer</em> than we do in Hogwarts." He said, handing her a letter with an envelope similar to hers.</p><p>It was an acceptance letter to be in the Auror Department immediately after graduation, the new law concerning their generation making it possible for Draco to be an Auror without the three-year training. Hermione quickly eyed the letter, and her eyes fell at the bottom of it; Kingsley signed it.</p><p>"Don't think I'm pleased to know you'll work at the Investigation Department, Granger. I hate to see you and your filthy face every day, and I know it'll only worsen. But if I have a chance to do the things I like and still taunt you over it, then it'll be my pleasure to work with you." He said, flashing her a smug smile and turned to go up to his room.</p><p>"Oh and, Granger?" Draco said before entering his room, "I think I'll go out to Hogsmeade today, might bring someone with me on my way back. I left the prefect patrol schedules on the table there for you to revise them. Well, if there's anything to revise that is, I didn't have the time to do them. I believe McGonagall asked for them. I told her you'd bring her the schedule later in the day." He said, and Hermione looked at him with eyes that could kill, "Don't mean to bother you, but if I were you, I'd apply myself to do them, I mean, you wouldn't want Weasley to get into trouble." He said, and with a final proud look, he turned back and closed his dorm.</p><p>"Malfoy you sodding prick, one day I'll kill you with my bare hands, I'll <em>promise</em>," Hermione said under her breath and decided Ginny will have to wait a bit to go out to Hogsmeade.</p><p> </p>
