  <strong>Prologue</strong>
</p>
<p>Here I am, sitting in a gorgeous church, in a hot stuffy muggle tux, watching my best mate and soul mate get married to each other. </p>
<p>I need to stare at something <em>besides</em> her. </p>
<p>I take the Bible next to me, and a piece of loose leaf flutters out. <em>‘The Ten Commandments,’</em> it reads in very serious looking writing. I start reading them, to gauge how incorrigible I am on the muggle scale of sin.</p>
<p>
  <em>ONE: 'You shall have no other gods before Me.'</em>
</p>
<p>Well, there’s one I haven’t broken, excellent. But then I realize that "having a god before God" meant I was putting something else above Him, and I did that with her. I did that with her every day. I put Lily Potter and her happiness above everything and every one. </p>
<p>Shit. </p>
<p>
  <em>TWO: 'You shall not make for yourself a carved image--any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.'</em>
</p>
<p>If it came between worshipping God and worshipping a picture of Lily, Lily would win. Hands down. </p>
<p>
  <em>THREE: 'You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain.'</em>
</p>
<p>Okay, really, who doesn’t swear? I felt slightly better about myself that nearly all the constituents in this room must also be guilty of breaking this holy law.</p>
<p>
  <em>FOUR: 'Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.'</em>
</p>
<p>Bullocks. I am not sitting at home, doing nothing on a Sunday morning. Usually James works Saturday nights, so I get to wake up and have her in my arms... <em>Stop it,</em> I chide myself. <em>You’re the fucking best man, for Merlin’s sake.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>FIVE: 'Honor your father and your mother.'</em>
</p>
<p>I’m sure if God ever met the Blacks, he wouldn’t honor them either. So, I guess that doesn’t count as much. They’re rotten and deserve it. Although I’m pretty sure being in love with a “mudblood” isn’t paying my respects to their pureblood memories.</p>
<p>
  <em>SIX: 'You shall not murder.'</em>
</p>
<p>If there was one thing I would never do, it would be murder. I would never, ever kill someone for pleasure or spite. It would have to be self defense. I almost have gotten someone <em>inadvertently</em> murdered… but that’s a story for another time.</p>
<p>
  <em>SEVEN: 'You shall not steal.' </em>
</p>
<p>I steal her. I steal her body, I steal her mind. I steal my best mate’s girl.</p>
<p>Well, that’s a bit harsh, I would say borrow. I always give her back… even if I don’t want to.</p>
<p>
  <em>EIGHT: 'You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.'</em>
</p>
<p>Did bearing false witness mean blatantly lying to your best friend every single day since you were sixteen? I think it does.</p>
<p>
  <em>NINE: 'You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's.' </em>
</p>
<p>Yes, I do covet. I covet her more than is bearable. </p>
<p>
  <em>TEN: 'You shall not commit adultery.'</em>
</p>
<p>It’s not adultery.</p>
<p>I was pulled from my perusal to the alter in front of me. “I do.” Lily said, beaming up at my best mate.</p>
<p>“And do you, James Harold Potter, promise to cherish, in sickness and health, until death do you part, Lily Marie Evans?” I stopped breathing. </p>
<p>He smirked. “I do.” </p>
<p>NOW it’s adultery.</p>
<p>And as she walks down the aisle, her white train fanning out behind her, glowing only as a newlywed bride can, our eyes connect. The unreal clarity of emerald green meets my guarded gray, and her smile falters. I can hear her thoughts as clearly as if I was a legimins: <em>This is what you wanted, right?</em></p>
<p>I can’t do anything but break the contact, and look back down at the piece of paper I’m holding. Nine out of ten commandments broken…  I put the page back into the Holy book and slam it shut. I put it down on the pew and stand up. She’s still looking, wanting an answer.</p>
<p>I shut my eyes and try to remember how I… she… <em>we</em> got here…</p>
