    <p>When she meets him, it is all too obvious the boy is scared. Almost as if he is waiting for the world to crash around him. Tina had seen that fear in people. Fellow Aurors who were wounded or cornered into a dangerous situation. Victims who were just waiting for the next blow. Criminals who were facing the reality of what they did and how long they were going to pay for it. Tina sees it in Credence as plain as day as soon as the door opens to reveal him.  </p><p>She knows, logically, he was her age at the least- it was why she was here. Two babies, given up for adoption off families from a sunken ship? That was no coincidence. But her heart both melted and clenched as if she was seeing a poor, defenseless child. Credence was simply that vulnerable, and scared looking. It was in her nature to want to protect and care for him. Do something for him, anything. For a second, she stalls under the emotion.</p><p>It also takes her a moment to process; this could be her twin. Her brother. Queenie is and would always be her family, her sister in everything. Nothing in the world would change that. But it was possible this man and her shared a womb, a birthday, and parents.</p><p>“Hello, I- my name is Tina.” She finally says, trying to smile warmly. Make him more comfortable. “I know this is forward. You see, recently…I, I found out I was adopted from a couple who had just arrived in the country in 1901 recently. My parents passed years ago, and while looking for answers, I found your name. Credence Barebone, right?”</p><p>This seems to grab his attention, and his gaze lifts. Not meeting her eyes exactly, but almost. Nodding, he confirms who he is.</p><p>Tina can’t help but brighten up. “I saw in some documents you were adopted from a family from the same ship. We were the same age, too. I- I’m not sure it means anything, Credence. But the family who brought me to shore never left their name. Maybe we could try and find out together?”</p><p>The whole thing seems to make the somber man happier, and he is about to nod when someone yells from behind him. Making him cringe and curl up visibly, even to someone with a less trained eye to her. That, Tina thinks, could very well be what seems to have spooked Credcene since he opened the door.</p><p>“Credence! What in the heavens are you-” A middle-aged woman comes behind him harshly.</p><p>Tina doesn’t like it. All her senses going up at arms, hearing the voice. Or the way the woman softens and smiles almost too kindly when she takes in the sight of her. Something akin to putting on a mask a second too late. She knew what this woman was- had seen the pamphlets and heard of the speeches. The hope was to avoid Credences adopted mother altogether, if at all possible Credence cowers at her words, though she notices he hides it better after the initial startling from his name being called.</p><p>Deep breaths. “Hello, Ms. Barebone. I hope I’m not a bother. Just, I was talking to Credence about his adoption. I was on-”</p><p>With a syrupy sweet tone, she is interrupted. “Oh, no need. Credence was just adopted from an old woman’s whose grandchildren were orphaned. Couldn’t care for a newborn, and gave him to me.”</p><p>In mild defiance, Tina didn’t respond but looked to Credence. Ignoring his mother. “Is that true? If so…maybe, I am being a bit overly hopeful.” However, his attention turned back to his mother in an almost panic.</p><p>“No, Ma. She said both the people who gave us up came from the same ship to the US…” He says meekly.</p><p>“Well, I was never told about any boat.” She replies, sternly. Credence, she notices, starts shaking. “You must have the wrong name, Miss.”</p><p>Credence panic is now on full display to her.  Clearly, he wanted to argue with his mothers’ words. But he responds stiffly when she looks to him for an answer. “I hope you find your possible family, Miss. Goldstein. But you must have the wrong name or address.”</p><p>Politely she apologizes for wasting their time, and tells Credence she was glad to meet him anyways. To have a nice day. Knowing that whether she was right or wrong (and the Auror would put money on her being right), Mary Lou was not going to allow Credence to find out. With one last look at her possible twin, Tina leaves the door of the church.</p><p>It is her turn to cringe when she walks away and hears a loud crack of skin against skin though the door when she is some feet away from it.</p>
