          <div class="userstuff"><p>A truth. </p>
<p>What does it cost, telling a truth? Not a partial truth, not most of a truth. But the whole truth, the entire truth, the one dipped in pristine white, sacred and hard to look at. What does it cost? Blood? Perhaps. Sweat? Sometimes. Tears? Almost always. </p>
<p>What about its opposite, a lie? What does that cost? Nothing. At least, not right away. Payment is delayed, for a lie. A lie is a stroke of black paint, brushed against the soul. It demands nothing, blanketing its target further with each stroke, until numbness turns into heaviness, weighing painfully on the chest. </p>
<p>To tell a lie, or to tell a truth. Those are my options. Black or white, never grey. For me, grey is forbidden. </p>
<p>I’m good at following the rules, Harry. I have no choice but to follow them, not after what I’ve done. But on that night, that warm August night with its humid air, sweet and cloying, I broke them. I will never forget that night.</p>
<p>Drunken confessions are never good. They’re never truthful, never false. They stain everything they touch, a rusted spoon, an imperfection on shined silver. That night, I told you that I wanted to hide from you. That I hoped to never see you again. That looking at you was like being Crucio’d a thousand times over. </p>
<p>I wasn’t lying. I wasn’t telling the truth. How was I supposed to make you understand that? How was I supposed to dip myself in white, supposed to display myself completely like I know you want me to, without the black paint muddying everything up? Grey is forbidden. It’s forbidden, Harry.</p>
<p>So Harry, I never want to make that mistake again. Never want to break the rules again. Because one broken rule will lead to another, and another, and you know how well that went last time. The truth is never supposed to happen, never meant to be found, dug up like an old fossil.</p>
<p>Love. </p>
<p>Even more complex. Love is neither truth nor lie, neither life nor death, neither black nor white. And you see, greys aren’t allowed. So Harry, don’t you see? I could never have told you, because I was never allowed to. </p>
<p>I’m sure you understand. You understand, right? After all, ambiguity never was your strong suit. Good guys and bad guys, that was our world. Red on one side, green on the other. Brilliant and vibrant when separate, muddy and disastrous when together. Brown is no better than grey, Harry. </p>
<p>But tonight, in this letter, with this ink, I will break the rules one more time. For you, and you only.</p>
<p>I love you, Harry. And that’s the truth.</p></div>
