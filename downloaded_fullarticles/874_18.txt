    <p>The Hogwarts Express ride was Albus’ time to tell Scorpius everything he’d been bottling up all Summer. Letter writing never came easily to him, but Scorpius was more than happy to receive telegram-length owls all through the Summer if it meant he could listen to Albus talk. Almost as soon as they saw each other, it would start. </p>
<p>First, Albus would complain about every grievance delivered by the Potters, the Weasleys, the Granger-Weasleys, and all of his other fifty odd close relatives. He'd move on to detailed descriptions of his Quidditch failures during the traditional family game, where he was always forced to play keeper—“Lily set the Quaffle on fire, Scorp! It could have burned off my hair if I hadn’t ducked in time!”—the day-to-day antics of his pet ferret, Toaster (he’d spent far too much time with his Grandpa Weasley in his youth), and even the rare moments where one or more members of his family actually got along. </p>
<p>Scorpius treasured their yearly tell-all tradition. Sometimes, as he spent the Summer months enclosed in the cavernous, cold, dusty halls of Malfoy Manor (all Malfoy house elves had been long ago released) with his Father moping around, still in mourning attire, it was all that got him through the day. How he was the only person Albus trusted enough to talk to about all this. It proved that they were really, really best friends.</p>
<p>On the September 9th of their sixth year, Scorpius arrived at platform 9 3/4  over an hour early. He’d spent the better part of an hour scanning the crown for Albus’ infamous Potter hair, murmuring distracted hellos to his fellow Slytherins as they went to say hello to the people they really wanted to see. Despite his father's somewhat reassuring presence, he was beginning to feel very alone when, thanks to his recent growth spurt, he finally spotted the trademark red and black Potter/Weasley/Granger heads through the crowd. Leaving his father far behind, he raced towards them as though he’d spelled his dragon skin boots with super speed. But when he’d finally reached his best friend’s side, beaming as wide as he possibly could, he was very unpleasantly surprised. </p>
<p>Albus didn't even look at Scorpius. He completely ignored his outstretched hand, said an enthusiastic but quiet hello, and then become so mute that Scorpius began to wonder whether someone (James, most likely) had cast a lip-locker curse on him, even though he was still able to snap at his Mum when she tried to brush his hair away from his face. His odd disposition had not worn off, even half an hour into their journey to Hogwarts. Albus was sitting on the opposite end of his bench, facing the wall, still not saying a word. Scorpius couldn’t see expression without some dramatic leaning (he’d fallen off the bench already), but judging by his body language, curled up into himself with shoulders shaking, he was not happy.</p>
<p>“Do you want a chocolate frog?” Scorpius asked when he couldn’t bear the silence anymore, his voice cracking even more than usual, the cavernous silence of the train car reminding him an uncomfortable amount of Malfoy Manor. Albus shrugged, so he tried again. “You know what they say about sweets…”</p>
<p>“I’m already your friend,” Albus said, his voice thick and choky, and Scorpius had to abandon his hope that Albus was just shivering from the cold. He knew what his best friend’s voice sounded like after he’d been crying. </p>
<p>“It can’t hurt. Here, take one.” Scorpius extended his hand towards the lump that was Albus, holding the frog tightly in case it decided to make a run for it. Albus blindly reached back and grabbed the part of the frog that Scorpius wasn’t holding, but somehow between them they fumbled the handoff enough that the frog was able to get away. </p>
<p>“Get it!” Scorpius shouted as he threw himself off the seat, lunging to capture the frog as it hopped to the opposite bench seat. Albus sprang into action, leaping across the car and making a grab for the frog. Sensing danger, it hopped back onto the floor. Albus followed in hot pursuit, an as the frog hopped this way and that to avoid his trainers it forgot to avoid Scorpius’s hands. </p>
<p>Scorpius grinned triumphantly as he held up the struggling frog, but his grin slipped from his face as he took in Albus’. His eyes were swollen, his face red and blotchy, the sleeves of his shirt (featuring the logo and faces of some Muggle band Scorpius had never heard of) were smeared with something that looked an awful lot like snot. Scorpius held the frog out to him, a silent peace offering, and Albus reached to take it. Scorpius didn’t want to be paranoid, but it seemed like he was making a pretty big effort to not touch Scorpius’s hands, snatching his fingers back whenever they touched his own. Eventually, Scorpius just dumped the frog into his palm, trying not to feel too upset. Maybe Albus had developed a touch complex over the Summer. Anything is possible. </p>
<p>Albus started back to his corner, to curl up into a taciturn ball of sulkiness again. </p>
<p>“Wait!” Scorpius called after him. Albus turned back. After a moment, he raised an eyebrow (a feat of which Scorpius had always been jealous) waiting for the rest of the sentence. Unfortunately, Scorpius hadn’t thought that far ahead. “What’s wrong?” He blurted out, tactlessly. </p>
<p>“Nothing.” Albus turned his back on him again. </p>
<p>“Come on, you know you can tell me. You can tell me anything.” Scorpius got to his feet and set a comforting hand on Albus’s shoulder, but Albus jolted forward like he’d just been burned. </p>
<p>“Not this. This is the one thing I can’t tell you. I’m sorry.” </p>
<p>“Not even a hint?” Scorpius retreated back to his side of the bench, eyes wide and sad. </p>
<p>“No.” Albus turned back around. “Oh, please, don’t use that face.” A few more tears slipped down his cheek. </p>
<p>“Why not?” </p>
<p>“Because…I’m not telling you that.” </p>
<p>“Come on. I’m your best friend!” </p>
<p>“I know. That’s exactly why I can’t tell you.” </p>
<p>“Can I ask you questions to try and figure it out?”</p>
<p>“Fine, but only if you stop it with that hurt puppy face.” Scorpius beamed, and Albus reluctantly smiled back, like he couldn’t help it. “You can have five yes or no questions.” </p>
<p>“I will have you know that I am the master of yes or no questions,” Scorpius boasted, back to his happy, peppy self. Albus sat back down, looking as though this train led to the gallows instead of Hogwarts. “Is it something about me?” </p>
<p>“Yes,” Albus sighed. </p>
<p>“I knew it!” Scorpius pumped his fist, before realizing the repercussions of this answer. “Oh. Is it something that I did? If it is, I’m so sorry.” </p>
<p>“No, you’re okay.” </p>
<p>“Phew. Is it…an animal?” </p>
<p>“In what situation would you have anything to do with an animal?” Scorpius had never had or wanted a pet. They made far too much of a mess for his liking. The only reason he was so good at transfiguration was because he couldn't stand to have an animal on his desk. </p>
<p>“I thought maybe you found out that I transfigured Toaster into an actual toaster and couldn’t turn him back for an entire day.” </p>
<p>“You what?” Albus asked, changing from a pathetic crying mess to an angry father in less than a second. Scorpius cringed away. </p>
<p>“Well, that obviously wasn’t it. Let’s move on. Is it something you did?” </p>
<p>“Kind of.” Albus was still angry, and slightly sulky, but angry/sulky Albus was better than crying/sulky Albus. Scorpius counted that as a win. </p>
<p>“Is it something about your feelings?” </p>
<p>“My feelings? What kind of feelings? Where did that question come from?” Albus asked, so defensively that Scorpius knew he’d touched a nerve. </p>
<p>“Well, they seem to be hurt.” </p>
<p>“Why would you ever say that?” Albus snapped, narrowing his red rimmed eyes and brushing another tear off his cheek. </p>
<p>“Er…I…you seem…never mind. Just answer the question.” But Scorpius had a horrible feeling that he already knew what Albus would say, and was not at all surprised when the answer was a reluctant: </p>
<p>“Yeah.” </p>
<p>“Oh my god.” Everything was starting to make sense. Every clue falling in place.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry!” Albus whispered desperately, his eyes widening and lip trembling. “I never wanted to…” </p>
<p>“You hate me.” It was the only explanation for why Albus wouldn’t touch his hands, why he wouldn’t even look at him. He was repulsed by Scorpius. “Your family or someone has finally convinced you that I’m Voldemort’s child.” </p>
<p>"But we already met Voldemort's child, and she definitely wasn't you," Albus said, too rationally. </p>
<p>"Immaterial," Scorpius said, flapping his hands in the air. "You you hate me and you don’t want to be near me anymore."</p>
<p>“I what?” </p>
<p>“It’s okay, I get it.” </p>
<p>“You get it?” </p>
<p>“I’ll just leave now,” he said miserably, starting the long trudge of shame towards the door and a long line of people who wouldn’t let him sit with them. But just as he was about to open the compartment door, he felt a warm hand grab his wrist. </p>
<p>“Wait, Scorp. I don’t hate you.” </p>
<p>Scorpius turned back in surprise and a gigantic amount of relief. </p>
<p>“Oh, thank Merlin.” </p>
<p>They smiled at each other for a second, but then Albus seemed to realize that his hand was still wrapped around his wrist, and snatched it back like Scorpius was made of flames. </p>
<p>“Then why do you keep doing that?” Scorpius asked, his voice rising an octave, gesturing to Albus’s wrist, and then his own. “I know we aren’t hugging friends, but refusing to have any physical contact with me seems to be going a bit far.” </p>
<p>“I’m not refusing to have any physical contact with you!” Albus said indignantly. </p>
<p>“Then prove it.” Scorpius held out his hand. “Hold my hand.” </p>
<p>“Please don’t ask me to do that.” </p>
<p>“If you don’t hate me, why wouldn’t you hold my hand?” Scorpius inched his hand further towards Albus, who shrank even further into the corner. </p>
<p>“I’ve developed a phobia to physical contact.” </p>
<p>“Then why did you let your mum and dad hug you goodbye?” </p>
<p>“Well, they’re family. My newly-developed phobia is very specific.” </p>
<p>“You also let Ron and Hermione hug you.” </p>
<p>“They’re also family.” </p>
<p>“You shook hands with Ms. Abbot and you even shook hands with my father,” Scorpius said, pacing and flapping his hands frantically as he became more and more worked up. </p>
<p>“They’re as good as family.” </p>
<p>“And I’m not?” Scorpius nearly shouted. “I’m your best friend.” </p>
<p>“Yeah, well—”</p>
<p>“If anyone’s as good as family, it’s me!” </p>
<p>“I suppose—” Albus began sheepishly. </p>
<p>“Why would you be able to have physical contact with them and not me?” </p>
<p>“I—”</p>
<p>“Unless…you lied before.” Scorpius finished, his shoulders slumping as he came to the inevitable conclusion. “You really do hate me.” </p>
<p>“I don’t hate you, you idiot,” Albus said, probably louder than he intended, rolling is eyes theatrically. “My problem is exactly the opposite.” </p>
<p>“You…really like me? But I already knew that. I really like you too, that’s why we’re friends.” </p>
<p>Albus slapped his forehead, his head rolling backwards with the impact. “No, you daft git. I fancy you.” </p>
<p>“Oh, okay, I suppose that makes more sense.” Scorpius shrugged and went to go sit back down, when the full impact of the words finally hit him. “Wait. You fancy me?” </p>
<p>Albus had squished himself back in the corner, but his miserable nod was all the information Scorpius needed. </p>
<p>“I’m so sorry. I never wanted to ruin our friendship. You can leave if you want, I won’t look.” Albus turned his head back into the corner, waving pathetically towards the door. </p>
<p>“Alright, so you fancy me.” Scorpius thought aloud, as he ignored the invitation to leave and resumed his seat on the opposite end of the bench. “You fancy me, and I fancy Rose, but that hasn’t ruined my friendship with her, so it won’t ruin your friendship with me.”</p>
<p>“You and Rose were never friends.” Albus said, and Scorpius could almost hear his eyes rolling. </p>
<p>“Well, a man can only hope,” Scorpius said with dignity. “But I can promise you that I won’t let this ruin our friendship.” </p>
<p>“Thanks.” </p>
<p>“Hey, maybe we could call ourselves The Love Triangle,” Scorpius said enthusiastically. </p>
<p>“More like The Love Line, because I fancy you, but you don’t fancy me, and you fancy Rose but she doesn’t even tolerate you, and Rose and are first cousins so that obviously wouldn’t work,” Albus explained, drawing an illustrative line across the air. </p>
<p>“Ah,” Scorpius said, crestfallen. </p>
<p>“So you definitely don’t like me, then,” Albus said, with only a slight waver in his voice. </p>
<p>“I’m so sorry, Al,” Scorpius said gently. “But I’m glad you told me.” </p>
<p>“And you’ll still be my friend?” </p>
<p>“Always.” </p>
<p>Albus took a deep breath and nodded once, briskly. </p>
<p>“Alright. Now that’s out of the way, do you want to play Gobstones?” </p>
<p>They settled down to a game, and by the time they had been both been squirted in the face several times, Albus was finally telling Scorpius all about his summer. </p>
<p>"And then, James broke into my room and replaced all of my posters with pictures of gigantic spiders. I wasn't scared, just annoyed, but then Uncle Ron came up to call me for dinner and fainted! Just dead fainted!" </p>
<p>And Scorpius and Albus both could almost forget about their previous conversation. </p>
<p>Almost.</p>
