    <p>Being on the Hogwarts express hadn’t been as bad as Draco had been expecting. No one bothered him. A few weency little first years, their admissions letters clutched in their tiny fists, or showing off their new owls, or robes, or trading chocolate frog cards, had allowed him to share their car.</p><p>Draco wasn’t a prefect anymore, nor was he head boy. Those roles had passed on to the rising fifth and sixth years, and the headboy and girl were seventh years of their various houses.</p><p>Draco, like the other eighth years, wasn’t even a <em>Slytherin </em>anymore. There’d never been an eighth year class before. But for the handful of NEWT students who’d skipped their seventh years because of the second Wizard War, there were a lot of new things.</p><p>They were going to be in the newly dubbed Scamander house, and all the students would be together, sharing a new wing of Hogwarts, taking their classes together, and cooperating.</p><p>No Scamander prefects, the letter had explained. No Head Boys. Just one class, for this one year, and then disbanded.</p><p>“You’re him, aren’t you?” one of the girls asked, tapping his knee imperiously with her fingers. </p><p>There was always that vague pause while Draco decided what to say-- a lot of people took it as snobbery, or deliberation, but really it was only that hint of confusion. Because Draco didn’t always know who he was, or who he was supposed to be. He fought the urge to pull his school robes closer over his chest, or check in the mirror to make sure he hadn’t slipped up. But he knew he was still himself, as he always was.</p><p>“That depends on who you think I am,” Draco said. Coldly, because that’s how he always was. He’d never quite figured out how to be inviting. He made friends through his connections, and he didn’t have those anymore.</p><p>Or friends.</p><p>“Malfoy,” the girl breathed, as if she was awed.</p><p>“Yes?” Meaning, yes, why? But also making sure he was Draco Malfoy. Sometimes he thought maybe he didn’t want to be Draco Malfoy anymore. He’d given some serious consideration to skipping this eighth year nonsense, go to the Continent, and come back in a few years after studying abroad. There was no money for that, and Draco was, in fact, considered a war criminal and he had to check in with his parole wizard if he left the school. No Hogsmeade for him, not this year.</p><p>“Thought so,” she said. “I’m Ariana Filch.”</p><p>“Filch as in--”</p><p>“Yes,” she said. “So, we’re going to be really good friends.”</p><p>“How do you figure that?”</p><p>“Well, Filch is my great-uncle, and he’s a Squib. Everyone thought I was Squib, and I’m not very good at this magic stuff. Uncle Argus says you’re one of the best students at Hogwarts, but you don’t got anymore friends, so… I’m not gonna have lots of friends either. I figure, we can have a go at it, yeah?”</p><p>Draco took a deep breath. He didn’t have any friends.</p><p>Some of them were dead, some of them were in prison. And the Scamander house was going to contain at least three bloody ex-Gryffindors. </p><p>Draco could use a henchwitch. </p><p>“Sure. Let’s be friends.”</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Despite the fact that there was a table set aside for the Scamanders, no one was sitting at it. The first years were clustered in a terrified group near the end of the Great Hall. Several of them stared up at the floating candles, and Draco remembered how they’d looked that first night, when he was full of eager anticipation, knowing that he’d soon be accepted into Slytherin, and that he’d be <em>home</em>. Welcomed.</p><p>Despite still smarting from Potter’s out and out rejection of him, the way the other kids had laughed. The way Potter had smirked at him, like he knew something was wrong with Draco. Knew that he didn’t belong.</p><p>The way he didn’t take Draco’s offered hand.</p><p>But the Great Hall and the Sorting Hat had taken all that away. Had been reassuring. </p><p>He’d never been away from home before, not even for a few days to spend at a friend’s. Too risky, and everyone knew it.</p><p>The class was smaller this year; Draco didn’t know if that was from the war, a combination of less wizards and witches than there had been before, or if more parents were not interested in sending their children away.</p><p>Muggle-born who’d been driven into hiding and who might not have gotten their owls. Who might not <em>know</em>.</p><p><em>What a loss that would be for the school</em>. His father’s voice, mocking and far away. No one cared what Lucius Malfoy thought anymore. The House of Malfoy was fallen. His father was serving a seven year sentence in Azkaban, and while it wasn’t the horror it had been before, it was bad enough.</p><p>Mother… she fluttered helplessly around the Malfoy manor, purposeless.</p><p>It was a loss, Draco decided. There were less than twenty First Years, Hagrid standing over them like a guard. The magical community was so small, and whose fault was that?</p><p>Draco blinked a few times, and looked away. Headmistress McGonagall was presiding over the staff table, and Professor Sprout carried the Sorting Hat in to place it on the stool.</p><p>The entire school seemed to hold its breath as the first students came up, tried on the Hat. Sorted. Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw gained new members.</p><p>Ariana Filch went to Hufflepuff, and appeared more resigned than delighted, going to sit near the very end of the yellow draped table. One of the second year students asked her a question, and when she nodded and pointed at the Caretaker, her uncle, they moved away from her suspiciously. Rude.</p><p>No Slytherins.</p><p>“Well, what did you expect?” There were murmurs all around the room.  “Not a witch or wizard that went bad-- traitors… fled the battle of Hogwarts...”</p><p>“If the rest of you would take your seats,” McGonagall said, standing up to give the start of term speech.</p><p>The empty Scamander table mocked them. </p><p>As one -- they always were, three bodies and one brain between them -- the Chosen One and his bookends moved over, definitely, and took their seats.</p><p>At the Gryffindor table. </p><p>The first years gasped. Second and third years looked both terrified and rebellious, they’d lived through the last year, with the Carrows and they weren’t entirely free of that fear, even now. The upper students burst into wild applause, not only from Gryffindor's table, but from Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff as well.</p><p>Ariana looked at Draco, rolled her eyes.</p><p>Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs shifted around to make room for their old housemates.</p><p>And Slytherin stared at the table, not looking at Draco and Blaise and Millicent, the only 8th year Slytherins.</p><p>Draco didn’t know -- were they not welcome at the house table anymore, or where Slytherins totally isolated from the school?</p><p>He decided he didn’t care.</p><p>Slytherins would need to adapt. The wizard war was over. They lost.</p><p>He took a deep breath.</p><p>And went to sit with Ariana Filch.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>“Did the hat talk to you, the hat totally talked to me inside my head, and why doesn’t anyone ever tell you any of the things you need to know? Like, I can have a pet, but where’s she supposed to sleep?” Ariana babbled as soon as he sat down.</p><p>“Attention, students,” McGonagall said, and Draco didn’t bother to turn his head in her direction. It was a welcoming speech, like so many others that he’d heard before. “This year, as you all know, we maintain the proud tradition of starting and continuing the education of our young wizards and witches, to prepare them for their lives and to create a sense of community among all magical peoples.”</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes, carefully, where no one could see him. He was staring at his plate, and under the table, Ariana offered him a grubby, nail-bitten hand. Draco reached down and squeezed it.</p><p>“As you all no doubt know, those bonds have been sorely tested, but justice and truth won out in the end,” she continued. Well, of course. There probably would have been a similar speech if Voldemort had won, since Voldemort would have been the one giving the speech. “To the end of strengthen our bonds, I would like to introduce some of our new faculty. Professor Fleur Weasley, who will be instructing our Transfiguration classes in my place, and Professor Bill Weasley, who is taking this year only to be closer to his wife and family, and will be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts.”</p><p>There was an excited murmur in the hall, and Draco wanted to do nothing more than slide under the table and die of frustration. Two Weasley <em>teachers</em>, as well as the Chosen One and his admirers. This year couldn’t possibly get any worse.</p><p>“In respect for our bonds, and to get past this terrible event as quickly as possible, we remind students that, no matter what side was chosen in the war, we are all one people again. Fighting will not be permitted, magic is not allowed in the corridors, and--”</p><p>Draco stopped paying attention. There wasn’t much he needed to know, aside from that this year was going to be miserable. The only perk was that being home was likely going to be worse, so he’d make the best of it.</p><p>Dinner appeared on the table.</p><p>And if anyone tried not to pass dishes down to Draco, he didn’t notice that either, because Ariana was making certain he was well fed and watered.</p><p>It didn’t matter. Not like he was hungry anyway.</p><p>“Mister Malfoy?” </p><p>Draco looked up to see Madame Pomfrey standing near him. “Yes?”</p><p>“If you don’t mind, dear, could you please stop by the hospital wing immediately after the feast? We have some things to discuss.”</p><p>“Are you sick?” Ariana asked him.</p><p>“Probably something to do with my parole,” Draco said, which was a lie, because he knew exactly what it was about, and everything was going to be different from how he’d planned it, and-- he didn’t want to talk about it.</p><p>He never wanted to talk about it.</p><p>“Well, that’s good, I hate being sick,” Ariana said. “I’m allergic to a lot of healing magic, so instead of making me better, it makes me worse. My face gets all puffy and stuff. It’s a disaster.”</p><p>“Sounds like it,” Draco said.</p><p>He did notice, at least, that his favorite dessert was offered among the selections, and he ate a slice of bakewell tart very slowly, enjoying every bite. And, also, waiting for the Great Hall to clear out so no one would notice when he had to go off to the Hospital Wing.</p><p>Of course, that didn’t go according to plan, either.</p><p>The upper classes left first, they all knew where their common rooms where, and the prefects were busy gathering up the first years.</p><p>Draco pushed the last few crumbs around on his plate, and then--</p><p>“Malfoy,” Harry Potter said.</p><p>Draco’s wand was not as much of a comfort to him as it should have been. It was still new, and on top of that, the Ministry had laid a number of enchantments on it. Because Draco was a dangerous war criminal.</p><p>“Potter,” Draco returned cooly, standing up and putting his back to the professor’s table. Surely Potter wasn’t about to start something in the Great Hall. Granger was with him, but the Weasel was near the door, watching, his arms crossed and his scowl sadly lacking in ferocity. He probably thought he looked dangerous, but Draco thought he just looked ridiculous.</p><p>“I… er…” Potter started, and Granger nudged him in the back. </p><p>“Go on--”</p><p>“Stop rushing me, Hermione,” Potter said. “Look, your mum saved my life. And we have a lot of history between us. Care to, uh, make a fresh start?”</p><p>“Let bygones be bygones and all that?” Draco scoffed. “You wish.”</p><p>“Yes,” Potter said. “Yes, I do wish that. Will you shake on it?” Potter offered his hand.</p><p><em>You won’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. </em>Draco’s own words echoed in his ears. Had he really ever been that young?</p><p>“Will you be content with us ignoring each other?” Draco wondered.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Draco let his palm ghost along Potter’s, feeling the scrape of a work-callused hand, and strong fingers. The hand of a Quidditch player. The hand of a warrior.</p><p>“Then it’s a deal. You don’t talk to me, I won’t talk to you.”</p><p>There was a sharp spark between his skin and Potter’s, like they’d sealed some sort of bargain, and he glared at Granger because she would set him up, she was always setting him up.</p><p>Granger just shrugged, not intimidated, but also not guilty. And not starting in on one of her “well, of course, you know, I had to try the Adiuro Charm…” that she was famous for. Maybe she hadn’t done anything.</p><p>Draco pulled his hand away, and walked out of the Great Hall without looking back.</p><p>Weasel bumped shoulders with him on the way out, nearly sending him staggering into a wall.</p><p>“Mister Weasley, that will be five points from Scamander House for unnecessary roughness,” McGonagall snapped.</p><p>“But Professor, he’s in my own house,” Weasel protested, and Draco didn’t stick around to hear the rest of it.</p><p>He couldn’t decide if he was glad that someone was keeping an eye on the Chosen One and his friends, or if he was concerned at what a close eye someone was keeping on <em>him</em>. </p>
