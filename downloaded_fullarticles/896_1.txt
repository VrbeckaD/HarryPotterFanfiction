    <p>The war had taken its toll on everybody. It affected everyone differently. Two out of three of the Golden Trio return for their eighth year. One very blonde, very familiar ex-Death Eater also returns. They all have their own troubles and difficulties fitting in, finding where they belong in this new Hogwarts. And of course all Eighth years share one dormitory, not many of them came back after all, not many were alive to come back. As they're all confined in such close quarters new secrets come to light and students find things out about each other that they never knew, or even considered, before.</p>
