  <strong>January 10 1979</strong>
</p><p>The Dark Lord stood at the window gazing over the fields in which the Manor lays. His dark brown eyes sharpened with determination as they portrayed such dominance, with soft black hair curled slightly at the top giving a little more height. He put his back against the wall as he stared at his beautiful star walking towards him. Her porcelain skin with dark features sharpening her beauty with lips as red as the blood of her enemies with the same dark look in her eyes. Her beautiful soft black hair blessed with the famous Black family curls.</p><p>"How are you Bella?" the dark lord walked over to her which such dominance that made her weak at her knees. He walked slowly towards Bellatrix as his robes gently grazed the floor. Hand softly touching her cheek, "I have been thinking......" the dark lord trailed off. "I want to expand our family my love." he spoke softly as he looked up to see the reaction in her lovers face. A smile broke out showing her beautiful pearls enchanting her face.<br/> "oh Tom." Bellatrix wrapped her arms around his waist. "I would love to have child with you" she whispered in his ear. "but I have worries." Bella looked up at her second half.</p><p>The dark lord nodded understandingly "what is it Bella?". Bellatrix turned around as she fisted her hand and slammed it into the wall letting out a scream. "I don't want our child to grow up in a world riddled with filthy blood traitors and mudbloods, to have them be corrupted and weak" Bellatrix spat with venom in her eyes.</p><p>The dark lords eyes hardened as we went over to his angry lover wrapping his arms around her waist and kissed her head, "Don't worry my Star, we will win this war for the future of our children and the children of our followers"</p><p>Bellatrix smiled softly as she turned around kissing him full on. "Then let's do it."</p><p>
  <strong>September 19 1979</strong>
</p><p>A loud scream echoed in the Malfoy Manor. "I WILL KILL YOU TOM!!!" Another scream roared throughout as a young dirty blonde women with dainty features and soft light blue eyes, held the screaming girls hand. "hush Bella" she soothed. "It will all be over soon, I promise"</p><p>"Cissa!!!!!!" Bellatrix screamed as she let out a sob of pain and terror. "i..it hurts Cissy" Bellatrix broke out her voice quivering. Narcissa is the cousin of Bellatrix, and like her cousin - she too held the epitome of beauty. Light skin, with soft blonde hair, her features are pure Black, sharp and dangerous - smiled softly as she gently grazed the tears leaking from her cousins eyes. Even though they were cousins, the pair had a strong bond like sisters. "it will be worth it once you hold your angel in your arms" Narcissa promised.</p><p>The dark lord stood at the other side of the door. His lips pursed together eyes hardening each time he hears his lover scream. "My lord." A pale, white blonde hair man spoke up.<br/> "Lucius" The dark lord drawled smiling in comfort of an old and trusted friend. He feels a hand on his shoulder, "Cissa will take good care of Bellatrix, after all they may be cousins but they are more like sisters" Lucius smiled softly nodding his head.</p><p>The dark lord moved "I appreciate your comfort Lucius, I don't doubt Cissy as she is very dear to my Bella" the lord smiled as he remembers how Bellatrix smiles each time she talks about Narcissa.</p><p>A soft like cry broke him out of his trance as he barges into the room. An exhausted sweating Bellatrix is smiling as she pants softly and a smiling Narcissa holding a tiny baby girl. With dark hair like her mothers as she is blessed with the Black curls and the dark brown eyes of her father. "Oh Bella" Narcissa sobbed holding the small child in her arms, "She is beautiful"</p><p>Narcissa handed the child over to her cousin as the dark lord kissed his lovers lips smiling softly at his first born in her arms. "What will you name her Tom?" Lucius asked softly smiling at his family.The dark lord chuckled, "what star or constellation my love? She is a Black and she is worthy of the pure tradition." Bellatrix shook her head, "no...we have plans for our Princess, to keep her safe, and people will get suspicious of a Black family name.  The dark lord nodded in understanding sighing softly, "she would have been a perfect Cassiopeia..." he summered softly then glanced at Bellatrix who looked up "I was thinking we could give her your grandmother's name, Hermione".</p><p>The dark lord felt his eyes water, "Oh that would be beautiful for a strong dark princess" he exclaimed as he gave his lover another kiss. "and for her middle name she should take after her godmother Narcissa" the dark lord spoke as he glanced at Narcissa with compassion.</p><p>Narcissa's eyes bulged as she opened her mouth shocked "what?" she whispered softly as she glanced at an emotional Bellatrix who was nodding her head. "Hermione Narcissa Black" she spoke with authority as she held her baby close.</p><p>The dark lord's eyes gleamed "she will be the future dark queen and will lead the wizarding world to greatness!"</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Bellatrix let out a loud scream of anger as the windows shattered around her. She just heard the love of her life may be dead.....all thanks to a spawn of a mudblood and a blood traitor. "Mummy?" A soft voice spoke. Bellatrix took a deep breath as she crouched down to her little girl with her dark brown eyes that gains the dark look like her father each passing day, widening with fear. Bella reached out and brushed her daughters dark hair in comfort.</p><p>"if something happened to daddy....if a freaking mudblood killed him, I will make them suffer" she growled at her mothers expression. Hermione was a smart witch. Extremely gifted and intelligent which made her parents proud. Bellatrix smiled at her daughter. "I know you will my love." Bella kissed the forehead of her little girl. "Mommy needs answers, Mione" Bellatrix calmly explained. "and what does mommy do when she needs answers?" Bellatrix asked with a sadistic smile.</p><p>Hermione mirrored her mother's smile, "CRUCIO CRUCIO CRUCIO". The little girl jumped around with a crackling laugh. Bellatrix followed her around laughing too. Narcissa stood in the corner shaking her head at there antics as she held a small Draco. He takes after his father with the color and hair, but his features were pure Black. Sharp and strong facial features Draco took after the pale porcelain skin of his godmother Bellatrix, with the silver eyes of the Black family. He was a gorgeous baby as well as Hermione.</p><p>"Draco!!" Hermione yelled out. Narcissa placed Draco down on the ground as he wobbled towards the hyper girl "let's play!" They both giggled as the ran around the small place screaming many unforgivables.</p><p>"They will be a force to be reckoned with...don't you think Cissy?" Bellatrix smiled. Narcissa nodded, "I believe those two have the power to save the wizarding world." Narcissa and Bellatrix walked out leaving the house elves to watch the infants. "I must go to the Longbottoms" Bellatrix spoke softly after some silence. Narcissa stared, "but Bella....your child needs you".</p><p>Bellatrix look up with anger, "AND TOM NEEDED ME!" She screamed before letting out a cry as she placed her head on the shoulder of her cousin crying softly "I...I need him Cissy." Narcissa sighed, 'I understand Bella." Narcissa stared as she saw Lucius playing with the kids wondering how she would feel if the same things happened to her love.</p><p>"I will take care of Mione, Bella....I promise" Narcissa held the hands of the crying widow. Bellatrix smiled in gratitude "if anything happens, raise Mione.....and Draco like how me and Tom would, yeah?" Narcissa nodded. "I promise"</p><p>
  <em>*Sometime later*</em>
</p><p>The daily prophet showed Bellatrix Black in the cover as she snarled at the cameras trying to free her hands from the chains. Bellatrix Black tortured the Longbottoms into insanity it said. She will rot in Azkaban forever.</p><p>Narcissa burned the paper as she threw her mug at the wall. "Aunt Cissy." A feminine voice spoke but sharp and powerful like her mothers. Narcissa stared into the small but determined eyes of her Godchild, "we will avenge both of them" her voice filled with malice and hate. Narcissa grinned, "we will plan something so big even Albus Dumbledore will be shocked my child".</p><p>The thing about the Blacks is once they set to do something, it will be done.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><b>September 1 1991</b><br/> <b></b></p><p>The Manor was chaotic. “DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY!” A womanly screech echoed through the manor. 11 year old Draco winced as Lucius chuckled next to him. “Better go to her son, don’t want to get your mother mad before you leave”</p><p>Draco glared at the older man as he sulked walking over to the Grand hall where is mother stood with a stern expression, pointing to the broken chandelier on the floor.</p><p>“Explain.” Narcissa’s voice was tense and short. Draco saw Hermione snickering in the back behind the door. “Mummy it was not me!” Draco defended himself. “It was me and Hermione”. He smirked, as Hermione walked over scowling, “Hermione and I, you idiot” She corrected.</p><p>Draco raised his eyebrow “No one asked your opinion you filthy mudblood” he teased laughing. Hermione’s eyes widened at his words as she whipped out her wand, “Draco Malfoy, my mother is Bellatrix Black and she is very good with the cruciatus curse and my father is Lord Voldemort and he too is very good with is unforgivables” she threatened darkly. Draco’s eyes went wide as he staggered back slightly looking at a chuckling Narcissa.</p><p>“Now dear.” Narcissa said softly as she rubbed Hermione’s head. “You have Bell’s temper.” Narcissa sighed as she blinked tears from her eyes of her cousin. Draco looked down before running up to hug his mom, Hermione doing the same. “Don’t worry Aunt Cissa, we will break her out of the hell hole and make everyone pay.” Hermione promised as Draco nodded in agreement.</p><p>“My two strong babies.” Narcissa gloated. “You little devils came up with the most devious plan.” she chuckled. “Having Hermione pose as the mudblood and befriend the little halfblood who destroyed Tom….and then break their little hearts when they find out who she truly is”. Hermione smiled deviously. “Well Me and Draco do make a good team.” she smirked proudly.</p><p>Draco coughed awkwardly “Draco and I” he quickly said before he sprinted out of the room with a angry Hermione following.</p><p>Before the Malfoy family and Hermione flooed to Kings Cross, Lucius gave them each a special journal in which they can keep in contact with each other.</p><p>“Thank you Uncle Lu” Hermione whispered as she hugged him tightly her face buried in his neck. Lucius lifted her up as her legs wrapped around his waist. “I am going to miss you Hermione….stay strong, stay powerful and stay safe...do you hear?” Lucius’s voice was tense as he worried for his children’s safety. Hermione nodded, “Yes sir” she smirked giving up a peck on the cheek before he hugged Draco who hugged him back. “Don’t worry dad, we will both make sure the plan goes by smoothly and very soon the Uncle Tom and Aunt Bella will rejoin us!” Draco exclaimed with the Malfoy pride. Hermione quickly glanced at him with awe before turning away blushing.</p><p>On the train Draco whispered softly, “this is where we leave eachother, keep me updated” before he left. Hermione closed her eyes and nodded, “ok”. She looked around the compartments to see a dark brown/blonde hair kid who looked fat with terrible teeth sitting alone. Hermione smiled fakely, thinking if she was to be a goody two shoes mudblood she needed to act like it.</p><p>She entered the compartment, “Hello, My name is Hermione Granger, and I am a muggle born. I am extremely nervous to be here, do you mind if I take a seat?” she asked the frightened looking kid.</p><p>The kid looked shocked his eyes wide, “o..oh y.yeah of course Hermione” he smiled softly. “I..I am pleased to make a friend this quickly”. Hermione fought the urge not to roll her eyes as she continued to smile.</p><p>“I did not get your name?” she asked in a tense tone before she winced correcting herself with a small smile.</p><p>“My name is Neville Longbottom...I am a pure blood, I can tell you about the wizarding world if you would like?” Neville asked in a soft tone. Hermione’s eyes instantly hardened as her body squared up. The longbottoms are the reason why her mother is in Azkaban. All they had to do was give her mother the information she wanted….they are the reason why she never knew her mother and because of that she is glad they are insane because now they will never know their son. She smiled at the reassuring thought.</p><p>“Hermione?” the blood traitors voice interrupted her. “What?” she breathed out. “D.do you think you can help me look for my toad, Trevor?” Neville fiddled with his hands when he asked looking down.</p><p>Hermione nodded standing up, pleased to get away from this filth, “of course” she said making a hasty exist.</p><p>Hermione walked down the corridors of the train spotting the trolley witch give a substantial amount of candy in one compartment. Hermione narrowed her eyes, “who will buy that much candy?” she thought to herself. She walked towards the compartment and looked inside smiling to see who it was.</p><p>The spawn of the mudblood and blood traitor right there….in front of her….weak….she fought the urge to just kill him now, knowing she wanted to make everyone suffer first. Death..that is too easy. She barged in to see a red headed kid with a rat and a wand waving. She raised her eyebrow, “Oh you’re doing magic!” she pretended to fake excitement. “Let us see!” she cheered, holding back a snicker as the redhead failed to do magic.</p><p>“Wizards like that are a disgrace to our kind” she thought to herself. She pulled out her own wand which mirrored her mother’s, “oculus reparo” she whispered and fixed the filthy spawn’s glasses. He looked in his reflection his eyes wide with amazement. “Thank you!.....” he trailed off looking back at Hermione who simply smiled tightly, “Hermione Granger” she winced out.</p><p>“I’m Harry Potter!” he said as he held out his hand. Hermione hesitantly grabbed it shaking. “And I’m Ronald Weasley...or Ron” the redhead said with his mouth full of chocolate frog as bits fell to the floor. Hermione couldn’t hold back a disgusted look at his actions. “Figures” she mumbles softly.</p><p>“What was that?” Harry asked as he sat back down gesturing for her to sit. “Nothing” Hermione smiled back readying herself for a long 7 years of this to come. She sees Neville who spots her in another compartment as he smiles walking towards her. Hermione holds back a scowl as Neville comes in introducing himself.</p><p>Hermione stares out the window longingly to sit with her beloved….wait friend and a world in which she and her family can rule and make the entire world bow to their feet.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Fers years fers years” a giant fat man yelled as soon as Hermione got of the train with Harry, Ron and Neville. Harry smiled as he ran over to the man, yelling out “Hagrid!!” Hagrid smiled back ruffling Harry’s hair, “I see you made it safely on the train Harry”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry nodded smiling, “this is Ron, Neville and Hermione”. Hermione smiled politely as she stuck out her hand pursing her lips, “it is nice to meet you Mr. Hagrid, I am extremely nervous, for I am a muggle born did you know”? Hermione monotoned her line.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Hagrid chuckled shaking Hermione’s hand back, “well not to worry, I am positive young Ron and Neville can help you and Harry out with the wizarding world”. Hermione nodded, thinking to herself, “yeah right, they barely can do simple magic”; she shook her head.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Hermione and the others got on the boats as she rode to Hogwarts. Even being the pessimistic person she was, she couldn’t deny Hogwarts was beautiful and portrayed the hint of magic that shown through. It stood tall and proud and the Great Hall looked even better than in the books she has read including Hogwarts: A history. The floating candles seemed to illuminate the entire room as she whispered to a confused Harry, “it is enchanted to look like the night sky, I’ve read all about it, in Hogwarts: A history” she explained. “And from Aunt Cissy and Uncle Lucius” she thought to herself. Beside her she hears a soft cough whispering “nerd”. Hermione’s eyes narrowed as she saw the skinny red head looking like a deer caught in headlights when he noticed she had heard what he said.</p><p>Hermione turned around smiling to see familiar white blonde hair talking to Harry. “You see Potter, you will soon to realize that some wizarding families are better than others, I can help you there”. Draco said with a authoritative tone to his voice as he stuck out his hand. Hermione bit her lip as her head tilted up slightly curious to see what the Boy who Lived had to say.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Harry gave Draco a glare, “I can sort the wrong sort out for myself thanks”. Draco retreated back his hand as he looked at Hermione nodding softly in anger. “Well you wrote your own story Potter”. Draco then turned and left Harry standing confused as he looked over back to Ron and a pretend confused Hermione who shrugged her shoulders. “You will regret the day you humiliated Draco Malfoy….I promise you that” Hermione whispered to herself softly.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“What was that?” Harry asked smiling, to which Hermione returned the smile, “oh nothing Harry.” Hermione saw the sorting sat ignoring the ridiculous song it sang. It wouldn’t be needed after a while, for only the greatest house, Slytherin, for whom she is a descendent of, will be the only house at Hogwarts. She hears a Hufflepuff being called as a small blonde haired girl went and sat with the smiling Hufflepuffs who cheered. Hermione yawned shaking her head.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Harry Potter”. Professor Mcgonagall called out. Hermione’s breath hitched as she saw the scrawny looking kid sitting on the stool. She could swear to Merlin she say Harry talking to the hat before it screamed out Gryffindor! The entire Gryffindor Table went ballistic with their screeching. They were esctatic to have the boy who lived in their house. Harry sat next to a body of red heads as she saw Ron amongst the people. Hermione rolls her eyes, “figures”.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Draco Malfoy”. Hermione smiled and perked up as she saw her childhood friend sat on the stool. As the sorting hat was lowered and it barely touched his head, it screamed “Slytherin!” Hermione smiled proudly. The Slytherins cheered because….well it is Draco Malfoy.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Hermione Granger”. Hermione’s breath hitched as she closed her eyes cursing herself for speaking these words, “not Slytherin, not Slytherin”. The sorting hat laughed, “not Slytherin eh”? Before saying “now I could just swore I heard those words before Hermione Granger…..or Hermione Narcissa Black, is it?” Hermione smirked, “of course you know you blundering hat.” Hermione said softly. The hat laughed, “young witch, occlumency doesn’t work on me”. Hermione nodded, “very well, unless you want to burn, you will put me in Gryffindor and you will not tell anyone, Do I Make Myself Clear?” She asked in a haunting tone. The sorting hat let out a sigh “very well then Ms. Black…GRYFFINDOR!”. She caught Draco’s eye and nodded, before skipping to the Gryffindor table smiling happily as she greeted the people she soon will kill.</p><p>Hermione was going to have fun. Make as many friends as possible and she can’t wait to see the look of betrayal amongst their faces.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Alright First Years” the annoying Weasley, Percy said, “The Gryffindor common room password is Treacle Tarts”. Hermione’s heart swelled as she remembered that to be Draco’s favorite treat. Ron groaned beside her as her licked his lips thinking about eating a treacle tart right now. Hermione shook her head as she walked into the common room and grimaced at the hideous decor. The common room had bright red and gold colors everywhere she felt as it blinded her. She missed the subtle colors of the dark green which outlines the manor. She walks into her room to see her stuff on the bed.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Hermione lets out a sigh as she starts to unpack everything making everything big again and setting it to her liking. She hears laughing enter her room. She sees and dark brown girl, with long sleek black hair chatting with a light girl with unruly curly blonde hair. They look at her and smile, “You must be Hermione!” The black hair spoke. “I’m Parvati and this is Lavender.” She introduced. Lavender let out a shy wave, as Hermione ever so politely waved back.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Yes that is me”, Hermione smiled out shaking their hands. “I am so excited for tomorrow!” Parvati squealed. “All the learning we get to do!”. Hermione tilted her head up studying the black hair girl in front of her. “Could she be part of their cause?” She wondered to herself. “Merlin, Parvati, why weren’t you sorted into Ravenclaw with your twin…I ever so wonder” Lavender joked as she leaped on to her bed biting into a chocolate frog, with Parvati jumping behind her.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Hermione smiling softly again sitting on her bed. She grabbed her journal and a quill and began to write.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Draco, are you there?</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span> <em> <b>Hello Mione! How is everything?</b> </em></p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Terrible! Everyone is so annoying, and it pains me to suffer with all the mudbloods and blood traitors. I just want my daddy and mum to be here with me.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span> <em> <b>I know Mione, we know the plan and what it must take with the philosophers stone starting off. We will get Uncle Tom and Aunt Bella back. We will be the rulers of the wizarding world and the stupid muggles will learn to fear us.</b> </em></p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Hermione smiled softly as she clenched her journal to her chest, before writing thank you Draco, I needed that.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Hermione closed her journal enchanting it before putting it in her drawer. She laid on her bed as she closed her eyes getting herself ready for tomorrow and what is to come throughout the years.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span> <b>Authors Note: Hello guys!!
