    <p>Sirius Black hated breakups.</p>
<p>He hated the mess of them all.</p>
<p>The <em>I told you so </em>looks that came from friends who always know best. Sirius happened to hate the stabbing pain that occurred repetitively in his chest when he thought of being alone again, and he despised the way it came when he was beginning to feel okay, as though it <em>needed</em> to remind him he was alone and in pain. Like he'd had the chance to forget.</p>
<p>The worst thing about breakups, in Sirius' opinion, was seeing the person. Again, he didn't want to, for one, even though he'd found out from previous one-night-stands he had very little choice in the matter. Secondly, he never knew what to say. 'Hello' seemed too casual, but not saying anything felt too rude. It would be so much easier if he was from a magical sphere and he could simply whip up a spell and ensure he never had to see them again. But Sirius wasn't living in a magical world, he was living in London. He was avoiding more people than he liked—to the point he had needed to make a list—and he hated the world.</p>
<p>Benjy—<em>the now ex—</em>wasn't entirely wrong. Sirius somewhat knew that, even if it was somewhere deep down in a place he didn't want to truly acknowledge existed; Sirius <em>was</em> immature, he was spoilt, and most of all, Sirius <em>was</em> a brat. But how was he supposed to get better by himself? Even when he asked that very question, the disapproving look he got from Benjy didn't answer it, and even now as he walked down the street, Sirius still had no idea what '<em>take some time to grow' </em>actually <em>fucking</em> meant.</p>
<p>It had been six weeks, and he was still not sure what it meant, or if he'd ever feel like he understood what had gone wrong. Sirius missed Benjy, of course he did, but he was sure he missed the company more than the actual person, and he wondered if that was an indication of a problem.</p>
<p>It was too late to ponder too much on that though.</p>
<p>He'd decided, only that morning, that to really move on, he needed to reinvent himself. He had decided he needed three things; first, he needed a new look—which he immediately reconsidered since he did not want to part with his hair; next, he needed a new number, which he didn't really care about since he changed phone contracts so often. He never kept a number longer than a year. And lastly, he wanted a fresh new attitude, so he downloaded more music to hopefully inspire a new <em>persona, </em>finding he rather like himself how he was. Sirius didn't want to cockily say that there was no point changing perfection, but he did think it.</p>
<p>With a <em>highly </em>dramatic sweep of his foot, he kicked a pebble that looked too good to <em>not </em>be kicked and watched with mild amusement as it rose in the air and cracked against the chalkboard sign advertising some new phone that <em>looked </em>nothing like his old thing. It was a wonder the rock had even lifted that high, and that Sirius had been on this very street ready to kick it, especially when he had taken a wrong turn down Knockturn Street. Sirius didn't know why he decided to stop, and he probably never would have if not for his new idea to overhaul his life, but his eyes wandered over the swirly writing and every <em>single </em>thing it mentioned drew him in.</p>

  <em>Um yes. </em>

  <em>Uh-huh. </em>

<p>Sirius had been in the door before his eyes had even read what shop it was—<em>Florean's Fhones</em>, Sirius appreciated the pun—and he was introduced to Alice before he could even pull his hood down and pull his headphones out of his ears.</p>
<p>"Linkin Park, <em>nice</em>," she said as she stuck her hand out. "Hybrid Theory happens to be my favourite album."</p>
<p>The corner of his lips tugged, and he was surprised to find a genuine smile wanted to appear. She seemed <em>nice</em>, and as she led him over to the phones, he was immediately distracted by the flashing case on the wall.</p>
<p>"Whatever phone fits that case, I want it."</p>
<p>Alice's brow arched, her doe-eyes brightened. "That'll be the iPhone, it's pricey, but we can throw in free insurance for three months, and it has a 64gb capacity." She pointed to the model on the wall. "You also get six months free BT sports—"</p>
<p>Sirius pulled out his wallet, removing his debit card and license from the slots. "I'll take it. But you can keep the BT sports. I prefer to <em>play</em> my sports than watch them."</p>
<p>Her cheeks flushed red, and Sirius frowned until he saw her lashes flutter, giving him a smirk that made him suddenly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Above all else, Sirius hated knowing that someone was right about something—especially when he was wrong—but with James, it was so much worse. He really needed to begin thinking before he spoke, especially when randoms thought he was flirting—when he was just being himself.</p>

  <p>
    <strong>S: So I took the stupid advice and decided I could try and grow as a person and so I have made several important decisions that I thought you'd like to get the inside scoop on Evans. </strong><br/>
    <strong>S: One. </strong><br/>
    <strong>S: It is I, Sirius, and I purchased a new phone and added all the contacts in from memory. So, points to me. </strong><br/>
    <strong>S: Two. </strong><br/>
    <strong>S: I visited that dog shelter you told me *not* to visit. And you were right, I would fall in love with a dog, and I would feel bad about leaving them. So, points to you. <br/></strong>

    <strong>S: How fucking cute is this dog though? </strong>

<p>Remus Lupin had been <em>trying </em>to sleep.</p>
<p>It was several hours since he'd first attempted, and he yet he was still laid against the itchy sheets, eyes burning a hole in the ceiling, as he told himself to fall asleep <em>now. </em>Even if he never did.</p>
<p>He told himself, <em>when you finally sleep you'll feel better</em>, except he never fell asleep and he never seemed to feel better. Today was the second day he was running on coffee and no sleep, and his bones ached more now than they ever had done.</p>
<p>Remus hated his knee the most, although his shoulder and elbow were close seconds. His knee, however important, had been close to being hacked off on several occasions over the last 48 hours, and if not for the fact Remus hated using crutches so much, he was worried he would have.</p>
<p>He hated the scars, both old ones that had turned silver and new that had slowly began to heal and covered its entirety. He hated the pain that flooded through him when it turned wet or cold, or even hot and dry. Remus despised knowing that he would walk with an odd limp, causing eyebrows to rise and people to mutter things. He hated being without clothes, which made swimming—an important part of his physiotherapy—even more painful.</p>
<p>Most of all, Remus hated being lonely. He hated the solitude his chronic pain brought, forcing him to bow out of events with his friends—not that he had many left—and decline invites to bachelor parties and bar crawls. He had never been more lonely since his mum died and his dad buried inside of himself to cope with the loss. Remus had no one to talk to except the sheep in the field next to his house, and the occasional rant at the therapist once a fortnight.</p>
<p>All of him hurt tonight. From his chest to his head, his toes to his fingers, his bones to his organs. He was tired—beyond exhausted—and he was sure he was losing his mind. Especially when his phone went off.</p>
<p>And then again.</p>
<p>And again.</p>
<p>Remus turned over, breathing through his nose as he lifted his phone. He made sure not to cut himself on the large crack he had caused from throwing it and unlocked his phone to see the <em>seven messages </em>from a random number.</p>
<hr/>

<p></p><blockquote>

<p>Sirius had no idea why he was smiling. He shouldn't be, he knew that. For one, he had no idea who this person was and, for all he knew, they could be a hacker or an evil person who did evil things. But for some reason, he imagined them as someone nice who used large words and read books, and wore glasses and probably drank from a teacup over a mug because they preferred to be aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>He liked to be aesthetically pleasing, but that was mainly for the 'gram. Sirius liked trips down streets in London that looked worthy of being brightened and adjusted so they popped on the screen of the few hundred followers he had.</p>
<p>Primrose Hill was his favourite. Sirius liked the colours and how it was so different from his own childhood home. He liked to imagine stories for the people that lived in the various colours; creating worlds where they had cake for breakfast and wasn't forced to wear formal wear for evening meals. Primrose Hill had been his escape, his <em>place</em>, and even the night when he sludged in the rain, water soaked into his converses, the place looked just as beautiful as it did in the sunshine.</p>
<p>Sirius backed out of the messages, staring at the picture he had taken that night before he had gone to James'. The dark grey clouds that hung over the yellow and blue houses, the puddles spreading over the pavement, and he could almost hear the black taxis rolling down the street as he stared.</p>

  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>S: I'd need proof. </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>R: Okay, well I haven't ever murdered someone, I don't think I can be sneaky so an agent is out of the question and I'm terrified of cameras of both photography or filmography kind. </em>

</blockquote><hr/>
<p>Remus woke with a terrible ache in his neck, and he half wondered to himself why he hadn't placed his pillows in the routine upside-down v-shape he usually did. Until Remus remembered the mysterious new friend he had made. He didn't turn his phone over straight away, not wanting to see what time it was or how long he had slept. The sun had gone, that was at least something, but the thick darkness told him it was at least early morning and he knew he couldn't risk moving without waking his father.</p>
<p>If <em>Padfoot</em> had decided to text him—though Remus was unsure why he would—he would have to reply, thus inviting someone into his life who he would most definitely disappoint or annoy. Remus didn't fancy having another person mad at him, especially when he had racked up far too many in the last few years.</p>
<p>He concluded that if he didn't turn the screen over, then he wouldn't have to reply, and therefore couldn't disappoint anyone—which suited Remus perfectly. Except, the voice in the back of his head—the insistent one he hated—had begun to harp, almost <em>sing</em>, until he wanted to turn the phone over just to silence the voice and get it to stop from hacking at his brain. He hated his conscious about as much as he hated the consultants that looked after him, which was no small feat.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, he rubbed the sleep from his eyes, stealing the chance to fall back into slumber away.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>S: I am re-considering such a large dog, Moony. I'm not sure if I should choose a dog more size-manageable. I'm intrigued to know your thoughts.</strong>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Remus found himself smirking, a stranger—one with the name Padfoot—wanted his advice. If he had been awake for longer, Remus would have probably scoffed or laughed until his sides hurt. But he hadn't been awake that long and he was running on little sleep—even if he had slept until 2 am.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>S: Upon more research, I think the size of the dog isn't an indication to its management. I just watched a video on corgi's, and the small-legged creatures look like a challenge and a half.</strong>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Remus had actually already thought of that before he scanned over Padfoot's message, remembering his next-door-but-ones <em>Yorkshire Terrier</em> and how it had chased Remus—a limping idiot—all the way to the Post Office. He despised most of all that he had become perpetually fearful of all small dogs after that, even ones with names like Sugarpuff.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p><strong>S: I have researched a little further and am very confused about short-haired dogs compared to long-hair dogs. I had zero inkling that there was so much to consider when finding</strong> '<em><strong>Man's Best Friend'</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>Rolling onto his side, Remus gripped his phone in his two hands as he let out a kept sigh. He wanted to be witty, almost comical—which was the opposite of who he was in real life. But Padfoot didn't know Remus, he knew Moony, and surely Moony could be funny.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>R: I am so glad you contacted me, Moony: Local Dog Expert, for this life-changing decision. I would first consider the size of your garden for the size of your dog. There is zero point in having Clifford The Big Red Dog when your garden is equivalent to a balcony. Just a thought.</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>He clicked send before he could regret it, half-dashing his phone into the mattress as he visibly cringed at his own text. Why did he call himself a local dog expert? Why did he even mention it? Especially when any dog scared him because any dog could outrun him.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sirius awoke to his phone buzzing on his chest, and for a second he was in a complete daze because of it. The ceiling was not his bedrooms', and the fabric underneath him wasn't his mattress, but rather his sofa. He had fallen asleep, again, in the living room, television flickering with adverts and the candle he had lit hours ago on its last legs.</p>
<p>His flat seemed bigger now that Benjy wasn't filling the space, not that he was ever round that much. He hadn't been shy about saying he preferred for the two of them to go to his, and even when Sirius had jested that Benjy had a problem with Sirius' flat, Benjy had never corrected him. It hadn't stung then, but it did now, especially when Sirius traipsed his eyes around the living room and seeing how mismatched it truly was—especially for someone with his surname and his bank balance.</p>
<p>Glancing back at his phone, Sirius noticed that Moony had replied, and he wasn't sure if it was the effects of the loneliness or the person's humour, but Sirius found himself smiling as he read the reply. He read it thrice before he attempted to come up with something, hesitant at taking the step to reply knowing it was gone 2 am and <em>How I Met Your Mother</em> had taught him no good could come from things that happened after that time.</p>
<p>It was a show he had always liked, it had made him laugh before Benjy had entered his life and it would continue to make him laugh now he was gone. The show—like James—had always been there, a constant, something stable that kept him in place and unable to float away into the sky. Sirius relied on sitcoms heavily for that, for the brief break from his bleak life to live in a world that wasn't his own. He never shared his shows with anyone but James, keeping them to himself because he didn't want to create memories watching them with someone who wouldn't remain—Sirius had already lost far too much, he didn't want to lose his television.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>S: I don't have a balcony, and I do have a garden, although I wouldn't call it large. But that is something to consider. What about this guy?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>S: <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/88/97/0c/88970cdc344ea1f48177d3934fa4c0ed.jpg" alt="" width="107" height="107" data-pagespeed-url-hash="4045486820" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/></strong>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>He didn't know whether to wait for a reply, but Sirius knew he wouldn't sleep either. Placing the phone down on the old coffee table, the one he had bargained for from the charity shop in the village, Sirius slowly stood, staring down at it one last time before heading into the kitchen. When he reached for a glass, Sirius was sure he heard the text tone signalling a reply—except his phone hadn't lit up; when he turned the tap on, he kept one eye on the doorway, attempting to see if light appeared near the sofa—it didn't. With a heavy sigh, Sirius drank the cool water, taking his time so not to choke but also to distract himself.</p>
<p>Sirius was close to the end, seeing the label he hadn't removed from the base when he heard the text tone, and saw the light in the corner of his eye, dropping the glass into the sink as he jolted, hearing it shatter as it met the metal. He practically skidded into the room, not sure why he had a giddy, butterfly sensation in his stomach, but it fluttered and tickled repeatedly.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>R: That dog seems like you'd be forever finding hair in your food. Do you like hair-sandwiches, Padfoot?</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Sinking down onto his knee, curling into the arm of the sofa, Sirius grinned as he began to reply back.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>S: Hair-sandwiches are a local delicacy, did you not know?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>R: Ah, well since I may not be from your area, I did not. : suspicious eyes:</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>S: Where I'm from, if you haven't got a sandwich in your hair, you're doing it wrong.</strong><br/>
    <strong>S: Hair in your sadwich*<br/></strong>
    <strong>S: Sandwich**</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>R: Your phones reluctance to type what you think tells me that you are lying Sir/Madam Padfoot.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>S: Sneaky Moony<br/></strong>
    <strong>S: Sir. Although such formalities are usually saved for my father. </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>R: Duly noted. What about Mister Padfoot?</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>S: Still rather formal, if I do say so. What about just Padfoot?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>R: Only if you call me Mr Moony. I like to be fancy.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>S: Do you wear a tie and a bowler hat?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>R: Only all the time, it is the standard wardrobe attire. Don't tell me you don't?</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>S: Only when I am not wearing a three-piece with a fedora.<br/></strong>
    <strong>S: With a feather reflecting the colour scheme of the day, of course. </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>R: Of course. How silly of me.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>S: Do you think they do fedoras for dogs?</strong>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Remus should have tried to go back to sleep, but he was wired and more awake than he should be for such a time. He also felt buzzed, like he had drank so much caffeine he could climb the walls, and he suspected it had something to do with Padfoot.</p>
<p>It had been a while since anyone had wanted to talk to Remus, never mind for this length of time. Especially over useless things that didn't revolve around his pain or his comfortableness with social situations. With Padfoot, he was a blank slate and he could bury all the pain for a second and be the person underneath all of it—he could be the person he actually was, without painting the picture of his limp or the scars that littered his legs.</p>
<p>He knew diving into Google would only further delay going back to sleep, but the question had niggled him, and as soon as he began to type Fedora for... the search came up with dogs and he clicked it without question.</p>
<p>Remus had to bite down on his lip to not laugh loudly enough to wake his father, bringing his arm around his mouth as he buried the laugh into his skin. He had no idea what dog Padfoot would get, but the images he had seen would prove no matter what breed, a dog would look pretty cool—and hilarious—in a fedora.</p>

    <strong>S: Oh. My. Fucking. Christ.</strong><br/>
    <strong>S: Yes. <br/></strong>
    <strong>S: I don't care what dog I end up acquiring, the dog is having a fedora. </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>R: I love the fact you can have braces for a dog?</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>S: AND A FUCKING BOW TIE, MOONY! A BOW TIE.<br/></strong>
    <strong>S: I should apologise for the language, because how bloody uncouth of me. <br/></strong>
    <strong>S: Siriusly if you mind, tell me.</strong>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Remus spluttered with laughter, burying his head quickly into his pillow to stifle it. He had no idea who Padfoot was, or what he looked like, but he didn't have him down as someone who used the word uncouth, which, ironically, only made Remus smile become a full-blown grin.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>R: I don't. But I am heavily offended by the bad spelling of seriously. You need to sort your auto-correct out.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>S: Oh, Moony. If only you knew. </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>R: ? </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>S: Ah, another time I shall explain, but for now, I bid you goodnight. </strong>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Sirius' heart was pounding. It felt too easy, he had found himself so close to saying his name—the one that would probably give himself away. Moony would stop texting, he wouldn't send him Etsy made dog attire, and Sirius would have to think about Benjy or being an adult, and neither of those sounded tempting.</p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>R: I will hold you to that. goodnight Padfoot of Fedora, I bid you a good sleep. <br/></em>
    <em>R: Don't let the bed bugs bite. </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>S: I'll fend them off, Moony. Don't worry. Night. </strong>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Sirius knew he wasn't going to get any sleep.</p>
