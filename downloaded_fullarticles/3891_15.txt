    <p> </p><p dir="ltr">Hermione Granger was no coward.</p><p>She reminded herself of this as she made her way down into the colder part of the castle, a trembling hand running over the damp stone of the walls. Graduation was tomorrow. She may never have this chance again. Yes, there were risks, but if she succeeded…</p><p>Oh, if she <em>succeeded</em>. Nights curled up reading beside him, the most interesting conversations, his intense, unwavering focus and attention.</p><p>She stopped in front of his door, wrestling with her shaky, stilted breath. She wanted her breathing to be even and calm before she knocked. She wanted to stand tall, to look like the woman that she was, rather than some —</p><p>The door opened, and she sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>“Professor!” she said, “I—”</p><p>“Miss Granger. Why are you standing outside of my door?” He stood with his arms crossed in the middle of the doorway, as unwelcoming as ever.</p><p>The speech she had prepared flew from her mind. “I—Professor Snape, I have to—“ she took a deep breath and clasped her hands behind her back, trying to steady herself. “I wanted to speak with you, if that’s alright.”</p><p>He stared at her for a long moment. “I gave you your Outstanding. What more do you want of my life? I’m not writing you any letters of recommendation, you were a —”</p><p>“It’s not about that,” she said quickly. “It’s not about school at all.” Her hand darted up to her face for some reason. It was shaking even worse than before, and she quickly tucked it into the pocket of her robes. “I – I wanted to –”</p><p>“You steal from my stores, <em>set me on fire</em>, terrorize my existence for seven years with nary a blink,” he snapped “Yet <em>now </em>you’re shaking? What do you believe I’ll do, Miss Granger? Why are you suddenly <em>so </em>frightened?”</p><p>“You knew the fire was me?” she blurted.</p><p>He stared down at her coldly. “What. Do. You. Want?”</p><p>“I-”</p><p>“<em>Spit it out</em>.”</p><p>“I’m in love with you!”</p><p>Snape visibly flinched. She caught only a glimpse of his shocked eyes before he yanked her into his office. “Wait here,” he hissed, and disappeared into his storeroom. He appeared a moment later and shoved a vial into her hand. “Drink it.”</p><p>She stared down at it, tilting it so that it caught the moonlight.</p><p>“What?”  he sneered, “You’re <em>in love </em>with me, but you don’t trust me enough to —”</p><p>She uncorked the vial and tossed it back, holding his eyes defiantly. Hermione slammed the vial down on his desk, the sound jarring in the quiet night. “I don’t need an antidote to a love potion,” she said. “Contrary to what you believe, Professor, I’m not an idiot. My — feelings — didn’t spring up overnight.”</p><p>He blinked. Silence stretched between them until it was nearly unbearable. “Miss Granger,” he finally said. “You’re eighteen years old.”</p><p>“An adult.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Hot, humiliating tears welled in her eyes. She broke his gaze and stared at the far wall. “It’s not about my age. We’re only twenty years apart. In muggle years, it happens all the time. In wizarding years, it means nothing at all. Why don’t you tell me the truth? What? Are you afraid of being cruel? Why now? Why — how did you put it — why after seven years of <em>terrorizing my existence</em>, are you suddenly unwilling to speak your mind?”</p><p>“And what do you think that truth is, Miss Granger?”</p><p>“It’s because I’m not beautiful!” It sounded juvenile hanging in the air. Sometimes, though, the truth was just that juvenile. “If I looked like, like Lavender or Cho or Ginny, you would never stand here and tell me I’m not old enough for you.”</p><p>His snorted. When she looked up at him again, his eyes were crinkled at the edges.</p><p>“You fucking bastard, don’t you laugh at me!” she snapped.</p><p>Snape snorted again, shaking his head and looking up at the ceiling in disbelief. “Oh, to be sure,” he said. “If Miss Brown appeared in my office right now, I would ravish her on my desk, is that what you think?”</p><p>Hermione deflated, feeling ridiculous and small.</p><p>He looked at her again, all traces of humor gone. “Is that what you hoped would happen with you?”</p><p>“No,” she said quietly. “I didn’t expect that.”</p><p>“Of course not.” He brought a hand up to hold his chin, his dark eyes boring into hers. “When you planned this, you told yourself a favorable outcome was possible. Yet, as you so aptly pointed out before, you are not an idiot. You knew that you would be rejected.”</p><p>He took a step towards her, and the scent of sandalwood and parchment came with him. Even now, she wanted so badly to touch him.</p><p>“Let’s be very clear about one thing,” he said. “If Cho Chang, or Ginny Weasley, or <em>Lavender Brown</em> ever tried this, I would <em>not</em> be standing here telling them they’re too young. I would’ve shoved them out of my office the second the potion failed to work. An eighteen year old —“</p><p>“But twenty years difference —”</p><p> “It’s not about the bloody <em>difference</em>. Clearly, if the headmaster at one-hundred and fifteen decided to have a fling with a ninety-five-year-old, it couldn’t matter. This is about your <em>stage of life</em>. You are a teenager. I am a grown man. Miss Granger, what sort of relationship did you think we could have, even if I was at all fond of you --- which I am <em>not</em>?</p><p>  Hermione stared down at her shoes, letting her hair fall forwards to hide her tears.</p><p>  “Let me be blunt,” he said, “With other students, I would’ve assumed that they deluded themselves into believing in the possibility of some tawdry fuck against the dungeon wall. But you knew better. Yet you came anyway. Why?”</p><p>  It took a moment for her brain to restart after the word “fuck” coming out of that mouth, in <em>that</em> context.</p><p>“I needed to know, for myself, that I tried,” she said. “I never — I’d never give up without even trying, and —” she wiped her tears away and forced herself look him in the eye. “I wanted you to know…how much I admired you. Now you do. Good day, Professor Snape.”</p><p>  She forced herself to walk normally out of his office and close the door before her tears overwhelmed her.</p>
