    <p>Lena knew this day would come.</p><p>She had been forewarned. It had been the reason she'd been practicing her dances, her violin skills, and other menial things that she wouldn't bother herself with once she became materfamilias. Her Latin was flawless, and so was her English, her French, her Spanish. The German had always absorbed knowledge the way water did salt. Her stunning academic performance in Durmstrang had not superseded almost all others because of a sheer need to win - though that certainly aided her - but was because she relished it. It was a pity, then, that she had not been born with a cock between her legs; she would require her husband's permission to continue her scholarly pursuits once she married.</p><p>A glance at herself in the mirror made her frown. She would never be beautiful - never mind that she had flaxen hair that reached her waist or piercing blue eyes. Her sister Heini was beautiful, with delicate features and a charming laugh that warmed even the coldest of men. Her brother Alexander was beautiful: broad shoulders and a husky voice that was hard to forget; had Lena not been his sister, she would have fallen in love with him. Even Ivanka had been beautiful before her untimely demise.</p><p>Lena was stuck with the plainer features from both sides of the family. Her jaw was too angular, her lips too full, her cheeks so pallid no amount of blush could give them the rosy glow they desired. She wondered if her intellect and sharp tongue would scare men away or draw them closer to her. Her father, Lord Johann of Westphalia, wanted a good match for her. So did she, though she would not be surprised if they had different definitions of the phrase.</p><p>Dear Nimue. Lena wished she was above this nonsense, but she was not. She was just a girl fresh out of Durmstrang with no decent prospects of marriage, and the only boy she had been friends with, according to <em>everyone, </em>did not count. Her mother had begged her to compartmentalise her curiosity when it came to the matter, and though the blonde had done so she found it exceedingly difficult. He was from a proper family, he was accomplished and handsome, and if she allowed herself to, she could probably fall in love with him too. So what was the problem?</p><p>Inspecting her dress, Lena was glad that the seamstress stuck to her whims despite the dictations of current fashion trends. Her white dress was simple, baring only her ankles so that she would not fall during her dances. The cerulean satin overcoat clung to her form but not as tightly as society would allow, with white lilies and forget-me-nots embroidered on the hem. She bared none of her bosoms, which were high on her chest, and none of her wrist. Upon closer inspection, the ensemble looked very much like her dress robes for school, though with white instead of black.</p><p>Her mother called for her presence, and the blonde gave herself one more look in the mirror. She ran through a bevy of breathing exercises she had devised to keep her calm during the stressful exam period, as well as some Occlumency drills to keep her mind sharp and alert. More than one thing was bound to go wrong tonight.</p><p>Taking a final, bated breath, Lena put on her hat and walked out of her chambers, where over fifty men would wait for her and her friends to make their debut. She hoped he would be there to calm her nerves, but luck had never been on her side.</p>
