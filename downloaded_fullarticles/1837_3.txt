    <p>Located on a small hill near England’s east coast, Mould-on-the-Would had always been a quiet village, mostly occupied by magical families such as the Dumbledores. Percival Dumbledore had grown up there and later inherited the old family home, where he now lived with his wife and children and today, attended the traditional summer fair on the meadow behind the local chapel.</p>
<p>Albus, holding his little sister’s hand, walked calmly beside his father, while Mother grabbed the collar of Aberforth’s shirt, preventing him from running off. “You will stay with us, until we have greeted everybody and don’t you dare pick a fight with anyone,” Mother urged.</p>
<p>Aberforth scowled, but nodded, pulled out of her grip and squeezed in between Albus and Father. “Look, Derrick’s here,” he whispered, so low that Father wouldn’t hear it. Albus let his gaze wander around the meadow. A few feet away he noticed Derrick Benson with a group of other children of the village. Derrick lived three houses down their street and had an excessive ongoing feud with Aberforth since the beginning of the year. It seemed Aberforth really did not care that Derrick was, in fact, three years older and twice as broad as him.</p>
<p>“You heard what Mum said, you should better stay away from him,” Albus replied, equally quiet.</p>
<p>“If <em>he </em>leaves me alone…” Aberforth shrugged. The next moment they were swapped into an enthusiastic embrace by Mr. and Mrs. Archer. The Archers were an elderly couple, who had never had children themselves. That is why they treated all the children in Mould-on-the-Would as their surrogate grandchildren, constantly spoiling them with sweets and small presents. Albus liked Mr. Archer, who owned a Quidditch shop and always told funny stories about his childhood in Bulgaria. Aberforth on the other hand tended to take the sweets and disappear, while Ariana showed off her collection of flowers, making the old couple swoon at her enthusiasm, like everyone always did with Ariana.</p>
<p>It took them half an hour to greet all the other families and settle on a table with the Fawleys. The younger girl, Clementine, was Ariana’s best friend. They danced around the table, always looking for the biggest dandelion as if that was the most wonderful task in the world. The older girl, Rebecca, was about Albus’ age and always made sure that everyone knew how exasperated she was with her little sister. That again, lead to Aberforth’s open dislike for Rebecca, because she insisted on talking to him like she did to Clementine since <em>he </em> was three years younger than her as well.</p>
<p>“What are you reading?” Rebecca suddenly asked Albus, who was sitting on the bench next to Father. Aberforth was roaming the meadow with Hamilton Parker, his best friend, and Mother tried time and again to keep an eye on them without drawing too much attention.</p>
<p>Albus looked up. He’d rather finish reading his book than strike a conversation with Rebecca, but Mother had taught him to be polite with other people and ignoring her most definitely wasn’t polite. “<em>Phenomenal Transfiguration</em>.” He could tell by the way she looked at him that she neither knew the book nor was she very interested in getting to know it. He hadn’t expected anything else.</p>
<p>“Oh, <em>interesting</em>,” she said, eyeing the book skeptically. “Would you like to play Gobstone with Beth and the others?”</p>
<p>“Thank you, but I rather finish this,” Albus said. He didn’t particularly like Rebecca, Beth and the other girls in the village. It was not by principle like many other boys refused to play with girls just like that. He simply wasn’t interested in talking to them. The conversations usually turned out to be either boring or marred with a deep lack of understanding - and usually that feeling was mutual. Albus could only guess that they liked him well enough for his politeness and took pity on him, sitting alone, reading.</p>
<p>“You can do that at home,” Rebecca said and closed his book. Albus had already opened his mouth to protest, when Mother chimed in: “Go, play with Rebecca, Albus. Your book isn’t going anywhere.” She smiled at him and he knew she liked it, when they got along with the other children. He looked at Father for help, but he simply nodded encouragingly.</p>
<p>“Come on!” Rebecca took his hand and dragged him along.</p>
<p>It was not even that bad. He liked Gobstone and the girls were nice to him. They lend him a few stones and, although he didn’t take the slightest interest in dolls or the <em>Little Witch Weekly, </em>he tried to seem at least mildly interested, when his opinion was asked. Cassandra even knew quite a bit about Animagi, since her cousin was one and so, he discovered he actually enjoyed talking to her.</p>
<p>“He’s a lynx and he says, it took him more than a year until he could completely transform,” she told him, while throwing a stone.</p>
<p>“But he is registered, isn’t he?” Albus asked and stepped back to let Beth play.</p>
<p>“Of course! Do you think he would risk being send to Azkaban?”</p>
<p>Albus smiled. “No. How did he get the idea in the first place?”</p>
<p>At that Cassandra’s eyes lit up and she threw her long brown hair over her shoulder. “Oh, <em>that’s </em>a funny story. Two years ago –“</p>
<p>“Hey, Dumbledore!” She was interrupted by a yell.</p>
<p>In theory, his brother could have been addressed, but the girls around him turned to look at whoever had called and, then, stared at him expectantly. He turned slowly and was faced with Derrick, who, sardonically, looked up to him.</p>
<p>“Why are you playing with girls?” he demanded, stepping closer. Albus might have been a bit taller than Derrick, but he was twice as strong.</p>
<p>“I was invited,” Albus said calmly. He was really not in the mood for a row. Behind Derrick stood Orion, Aiden and Richard, his friends of a similar build, who Albus usually avoided.</p>
<p>“By Miss Fatty, probably, right?” He smirked at Rebecca, who looked down at her dress and tried to smooth it, tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Don’t call her that, it’s hurtful!” Albus said.</p>
<p>“<em>It’s hurtful</em>,” Derrick mocked. He and his friends started laughing, while Rebecca started crying and Beth hugged her carefully. “Is she your girlfriend, Dumbledore? Are you in love with her?”</p>
<p>He had to force himself not to roll his eyes. No, she was not. They were not even friends, really, but he couldn’t say that when Rebecca stood next to him, crying.</p>
<p>“She is my friend, I don’t have to be in love with her for that,” he said and resisted the urge to step back, when Derrick stepped even closer.</p>
<p>“Listen up! Dumbledore’s in love with Miss Fatty!” Derrick yelled and his friends hollered with laughter.</p>
<p>“I do not and you should stop talking about things you know nothing about!” Albus said, harsher this time.</p>
<p>“You’re telling me what to do, Dumbledore?” Derrick shoved him and he stumbled backwards.</p>
<p>“I asked you not to insult her,” he replied. He did hate such situations - it was ridiculous.</p>
<p>“And if I do it anyway?” Derrick challenged.</p>
<p>“Just go away, Derrick!” The annoyed voice belonged to Cassandra, who was glaring at Derrick, her hands clenched into fists. Derrick turned his head in surprise. She had narrowed her eyes and although she was a lot shorter than him, she looked quite terrifying.</p>
<p>“You’ve got another friend?” He asked Albus. “Do you talk about dolls, too? Are you in love with her, too? Or are you <em>gay?”</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t just Albus, who flinched at that accusation. Beth gasped, the others stared at them with wide eyes. Suddenly the meadow felt awfully quiet.</p>
<p>“I do not love Rebecca. I do not love Cassandra! And I am <em>not </em>gay!” He had raised his voice this time and stood a little taller, his hands trembling with anger. “And if you had a little brain and  decency, you would not say such things lightly”</p>
<p>“Have you heard yourself?” Derrick laughed. “<em>Decency</em>! What, are you my mother?”</p>
<p>Derrick shoved him again. He stumbled back again, pressing his lips together, glaring at the other boy. <em>Don’t let him pick a fight</em>, he heard his father’s calm voice inside his head. He took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Stop shoving him!” Cassandra yelled again and, in turn, tried to shove Derrick. She didn’t possess the strength, though, and he simply stepped back a little in surprise. Now, he seemed really angry. He bumped her shoulder and she fell backwards. “Alright! Then I shove you!”</p>
<p>“Stop it!” Albus stepped closer now. “You can’t tell me anything!” Derrick roared and Albus did not see it coming, not at all and so, he was too slow to avoid the fist hitting his face. He heard an unhealthy crack and let out a small scream, when hot pain shot through his nose. He felt the warm blood dripping down his nose and into his mouth and pressed a hand to his face, immediately.</p>
<p>“Did you just punch my brother?!” Somebody yelled and it took him a moment to recognize Aberforth’s voice.</p>
