    <p>“Disney? What Even is that?”</p>
<p>“It's a muggle place, Lily’s dying to go, its about all those movies we watched in the summer. Remember Tangled, Toy Story, Moana? Lily loves the stuff and she's finally convinced dad to bring us. I don't want to go. James is bringing Andie and they're gonna be snogging the whole time, and I don't want to be with Lily for a week in disneyland”</p>
<p>“Oh well since you’re selling it so well, I'm just dying to go” smirked scorpius and albus glared at him.</p>
<p>“oh , shut up”</p>
<p>It had been a week since Albus had gotten the letter from his dad. bursting with excitement about the upcoming family trip to Disney. Albus pretended to be less than thrilled whenever Lily and James put on a disney classic,but he loved it much more than he ever let on. Okay maybe he sang “Let it Go” in the shower, but that was nothing a muffliato couldn't hide and that was something Scorpius could never find out about.</p>
<p>After finding out that James was bringing his girlfriend Andie, the idea of going without Scorp seemed like a nightmare. Albus was ready to beg his parents to let him invite scorpius, but he needn't worry. After asking his parents they said that they had already bought the extra ticket and assumed scorpius would be coming along as long as Draco approved. The prospect of being with his best friend, for a whole week, in the most magical place on earth was almost too much to handle.</p>
<p>“Please Scorpius just ask your dad, it's going to be amazing, It's the most magical place on earth!”</p>
<p>“Albus I hate to break it to you… but we go to hogwarts. School of wizards. It's pretty magical”</p>
<p>Albus flushed, a mix of embarrassment and excitement and failed to respond to that statement.</p>
<p>“But.. Ariel, Belle…”</p>
<p>Okay he seriously needed to tone down this absurd love of princesses, but didn't every teenager dream of a happily ever after with a handsome prince.</p>
<p>Definitely not.</p>
<p>Especially not fifteen year old boys, thought Albus as his blush depend looking away from Scorpius and trying desperately to get the picture of a prince Scorpius out of his head.</p>
<p>Scorpius’ voice ended Albus’ day dream. Albus turned to face the real scorpius in boxer briefs and a gray cotton tee shirt.</p>
<p>“I’ll write a letter to dad in the morning. I'm not sure he’ll love the idea of me being gone for a week especially in muggle disneyland”</p>
<p>A thank you about a million times more excited then it needed to be burst out of Albus’ mouth as he leapt across the room and pulled Scorpius into a bear hug.</p>
<p>xxx</p>
<p>Draco’s reply came that morning at breakfast.</p>
<p>Scorpius,</p>
<p>I received your letter last night amongst a blur of letters of excited Potter practically begging me to allow you to go. I have talked to Harry and Ginny about it. I certainly can't imagine why anyone would want to go to a muggle vacation about muggle movies, so I suppose you’ll have to take lots of pictures and explain it to me when you get back. I mean it, you can go. I want you to write to me everyday though and please don't worry if you want to come home I will pick you up immediately.</p>
<p>And don't worry about me, I know you will but it's not necessary. I will be fine at malfoy manor and will pick you up from the potters on July eighth. Remember your manners and have fun.</p>
<p>Love always,</p>
<p>Dad</p>
<p>“I can't believe it!”</p>
<p>Scorpius’s excited cry echoed throughout the great hal turning more than a few heads. He ducked his head with an adorable blush and whispered to albus</p>
<p>“He's letting me go! Disney here we come!!!”</p>
<p>Xxx</p>
<p>The platform was busy as ever and Scorpius had to hold back from reaching out to grab Albus’ hand as they weaved through the crowd to find the potters.</p>
<p>At last a fire of red was a visible sign of weasleys, and potters and weasleys are never far from each other. Ginny pushed through the crowd and grabed Albus and Scorpius into a huge mama bear hug.</p>
<p>“How are my slytherin boys, excited for the trip?’’</p>
<p>“Can't wait! Thank you for bringing me along Ginny” said Scorpius rubbing his ribs and checking that nothing had been injured in the hug.</p>
<p>Lily came skidding through next with her cat screeching in her arms. Excitement seemed to be bubbling off of her. “DAD DAD DAD DAD DAD DAD!” The voice got louder and louder with every syllable, scorpius would have thought she was angry if not for the huge smile spreading across her dark freckled face. “I can't believe it!” she threw herself into Harry’s arms and he spun her through the air.</p>
<p>“Lily Vanilli” he cried affectionately before kissing her forehead and putting her back on the ground and smiling up as Albus and Scorpius. Every centimeter of his face shone with affection for his son as he pulled him into a tight hug and ruffled his hair. “I swear Albus it's even messier than mine was at your age<br/>
“I'm not sure If I can vouch for that” Said Ginny still holding Lily's hand. Looking at scorpius she stage whispered “I'm sure you’ve seen albus’ morning hair and trust me Harrys everyday hair was worse than that when he was fifteen”</p>
<p>Scorpius went bright red thinking of lazy mornings with Albus, his disastrous hair sticking up adorably, no not adorably scorpius reminded himself… “Oh it's not that bad” he said earning a punch on the shoulder from Albus.</p>
<p>“And where are James and Andie” Said Ginny with a look saying she didn't really want to know where they were or what they were doing but they had better come quick.”</p>
<p>“Probably snogging” Said Lily as she mimed throwing up “Blech”</p>
<p>“Lily” Said Ginny sternly, but anyone could see she was struggling not to laugh as she observed albus and scorpius who both looked disgusted by the idea of James and Andie. They seemingly fully agreed with Lilies statement.</p>
<p>When James and Andie finally emerged it was clear that Lily was correct. James apparently didn't care or was terrible at hiding the fresh hickeys all up his neck. Harry jokingly covered Lily's eyes as albus rolled his. “Well then, if you guys are ready to go” Said Ginny who looked as though she couldn't decide whether to hug james or glare at him, finally deciding to smile at Andie and start assuring everyone towards the exit so they could drive home.</p>
<p>“Sorry Mum prefect duties” snickered James as he pulled Andie into his side. The two were completely inseparable and had been best Friends since first year before they started dating in third year. Personally Albus though it was a bloody miracle that they were only thirteen when they started dating and were still dating in their sixth year.</p>
<p>“Sure thing” said Ginny as she went to help Lily with her suitcase trolley.</p>
<p>“Common” albus whispered excitedly to Scorpius. “Were taking the car home and we're gonna have to get there first if we don't want to sit squished at the back with Lily”</p>
<p>They took off running with James and Andie chasing after them, “No way” shouted James as he began to gain on Albus. “I'm so much taller than you and my legs will be crushed at the back”</p>
<p>Andie went into a full sprint screaming after the boys.</p>
<p>“Wow, they've matured so much over this school year haven't they” Ginny muttered sarcastically to Harry and Lily who laughed along watching the four teenagers tackle each other to avoid sitting squashed in the back seat.</p>
<p>By the time Ginny Harry and Lily got to the car Andie and James were bucked into the middle seats completely refusing to budge and Albus and Scorpius were pouting outside the car. “It's not fair mum he never has to sit in the back.” Albus pouted as scorpius nodded enthusiastic. He wasn't about to argue with ginny but he certainly didn't want to sit in the back with squirming lily and moody Albus.</p>
<p>“Fine” Said Ginny in A voice that shot Daggers Albus James Lily, you’re in the back. Scorpius and Andie are gusts they can sit in the seats with an extra five centimeters of leg room” she said sarcastically.<br/>
“Andies hardly a guest” Albus started before being silenced by his mothers look.</p>
<p>Scorpius sat down and could feel James glare on the back of his neck. He turned around timidly and was met with one of the meanest looks he had ever seen james give. “I can switch with you if you like” he muttered.</p>
<p>“Oh scorpius honey you don't have to” said Ginny turning around to look at him when she saw James look. “James, im warning you. That is not how we act. Im serious all this for a middle seat? We will be home in an hour”</p>
<p>James gruffly apologized to scorpius as even And glared at him. “Sorry James is so childish’’ she apologized to scorpius before giving James a dirty look.</p>
<p>“I’ll switch with you scorpius!” Lily said in a bouncy sweet voice.</p>
<p>“That's okay Lily I didn't need… sure?” scorpius was clearly flustered wich Lily used to her advantage as she kept from her seat and ‘helped’ Scorpius out of his practically pushing him onto abus’ lap as she scored herself a middle seat.</p>
<p>James had turned his glare on to Lily and Scorpius was now much more comfortable sitting next to albus. Sure they were squished into the backseat, but in that moment neither Albus or Scorpius were upset by it.</p>
<p>Finally the car started and as harry struck up conversation with Andie about muggle vehicles Albus found his eyes grow heavy as he rested his head on Scorpius’ shoulder. Scorpius had grown over the year, giving him and Albus a significant height difference. At first Scorpius felt uncomfortable in his own skin, and felt like he never knew just how long his arms were. More and more often he was underestimating his own strength. He got used to hs new height though and loved that his shoulder had become a perfect head rest for Albus’ often tired head.</p>
<p>Scorpius focused back into the conversation and made eye contact with Harry, who smiled at him in the rear view mirror. He felt himself joining albus in sleep. In moments the two boys were fast asleep.</p>
<p>“Ew mum I think albus is drooling” James laughed looking at his brothers half open mouth. Andie and Lily both quickly turned around to see, bumping heads in the middle and laughing before they even saw the drool.</p>
<p>Poor Scorpius, he's gonna need to change his shirt” Lily whispered hardly able to contain her loud laugh that was sure to wake up the boys.</p>
<p>“Let him sleep” said Ginny sternly “and no one tease him, you all know he's sensitive, i'm sure scorpius don't mind, they literally live together at hogwarts i'm sure this isn't the first time.</p>
<p>Lily turned to Andie as if she didn't know “Albus drools every time he sleeps. He just never outgrew it I think.” She said as if she was telling the world's biggest secret.</p>
<p>Ginny looked at the boys happily, thankful that her albus had a friend as sweet, kind, and caring as Scorpius.<br/>
Xxx</p>
<p>When the Car pulled into the potters driveway all the kids were asleep and the sun was beginning to set. James Piggybacked lily into the house as Scorpius, Albus and andie stumbled after him. Ginny and Harry charmed the suitcases to float in after them and walked up the driveway behind their children, arm in arm.</p>
<p>“He looks like he's doing better” said Ginny quietly looking at her youngest son. She watched as albus laughed, his rare laugh that seemed to be reserved only for Scorpius and on a rare occasion Lily or Ginny.</p>
<p>“Yeah” said harry in a low voice interrupting Ginny's thoughts. “I hope he's doing better at least. He said with his sadness reaching his voice as he too watched Albus and Scorpius.</p>
<p>Ginny squeezed Harry's hand and gave him a reassuring look before leading him into the house.</p>
<p>Xxx</p>
<p>Even though they had only been home for a couple of hours, the entire school year felt like it was fading away</p>
<p>Harry was in the Kitchen cooking chicken Korma with James and Andie who had impressively not snuck off to james room to do god knows what yet.</p>
<p>Ginny was in the living room with Albus, Scorpius and Lily.</p>
<p>“I’m so excited for Disney, mum you don't even know! I want to go on every ride and Al and i are going to meet every princess, right Albus?” Albus went bright red with embarrassment.</p>
<p>“Sure, I guess, If you like I’ll meet them with you” he muttered looking at his hands and trying to avoid scorpius’ eyes.</p>
<p>“ALBUS” Lily cried “Don't tell me you’re embarrassed, anyone who has ever met you knows how much you love a good disney princess” She sang, nudging scorpius. “Whenever he storms off to his room I hear him listening to the tangled soundtrack. His muffliato aren't as good as he thinks…”<br/>
Albus went redder than he thought possible and more then anything wanted to go up to his room and listen to the tangled soundtrack, but he wasn't about to give lily the satisfaction.</p>
<p>“Well, were just going to go upstairs to, uh, unpack. And then pack what we want to bring to disney…” he blushed and grabbed scorpius leading him up the stairs and away from Lily and anymore embarrassing stories she might feel inclined to tell. Slamming the door behind him albus took a deep breath and surveyed the room.</p>
<p>The walls were the same pale blue they had been his whole life, his desk covered in old drawings and unfinished stories. His bad sat in the middle of the room with his soft green gray sheets and his thick green comforter. On his pillow sat his old teddy bear that had once been enchanted to keep him warm at night. The room smelt like home, and it was here that albus felt the most comfortable.</p>
<p>The two boys flopped onto Albus’ bed and were silent for a moment while they caught their breath after running up the stairs.</p>
<p>“So tell me, albus” scorpius began, “which Disney princess is your favourite” He asked sincerely without a hint of mockery.</p>
<p>“Oh shut up” said albus as he turned towards Scorpius on the bed.</p>
<p>“No, real, i'd like to know. I don't really remember all the movies we watched last summer but im sure if you told me a bit about it I would remember. And I don't know why you’re embarrassed, I think movies are so cool even if they are muggles.” Scorpius rambled.</p>
<p>“It's not that its muggle, it's just, uh, I don't know. The princesses are like, little muggle girl things, so I don't like them much. Or I shouldn't like them much. Lily thinks it's hilarious, sometimes I have to convince her to watch tangled with me. That's my favourite one. With rapunzel and Flynn Rider and Pascalls the little chameleon. It's got good songs too. My favourite is the love song Rapunzel and Flynn sing in the boat, while the lanterns float all around them. It's so pretty I just can't even.” Albus got more and more excited as he spoke, his face completely lighting up. “Sorry, I know it's not that interesting, i can just..”</p>
<p>“Its okay, I like hearing about the things you like”</p>
<p>Albus blushed lightly and closed his eyes thinking about all the amazing movies he and scorpius needed to watch together. After looking for scorpius’ reassuring look, albus went into a long summary of everything about disney tangled and what parts were his favourites and how much he loved Flynn/Eugene.</p>
