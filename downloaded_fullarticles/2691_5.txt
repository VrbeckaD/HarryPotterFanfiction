          <div class="userstuff"><p>“I thought that words weren’t supposed to have periods after each letter,” Harry told Zuri confusedly, gazing at the T-shirt she held in front of him. <em>S.H.I.R.T. </em>was spelled out on the front of it, with a little swirly line underlining it.</p><p>“It’s not a real word, it’s an acronym,” Zuri explained, but Harry didn’t understand any better with this, either. “An acronym is when the first letters of each word in a phrase spell out a word.”</p><p>“What does S.H.I.R.T. stand for, then?” Harry questioned, still confused.</p><p>Zuri smiled proudly. “Snakes Have Inherent Rights, Too!” she proclaimed. “It’s an organization I’m starting because so many of the magical world treat snakes and other animals they keep for potions just <em>awful</em>. I thought about what you said when Snape was hurting that snake when you first got to Hogwarts. He didn’t know, obviously, that he was hurting it, and he wouldn’t ever do it intentionally. But some people <em>do</em>! And so this organization is going to help snakes, and remind people that they have rights too, and they should be treated better. Do you want a shirt?”</p><p>Harry beamed at her explanation and accepted the charcoal grey shirt with green writing without delay, pulling it on over the clothes he had already.</p><p>“I love it,” he said happily. “Let’s go tell people about it!”</p></div>
