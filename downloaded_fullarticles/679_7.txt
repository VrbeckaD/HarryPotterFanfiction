  <b> <em>Dear Professor Snape,</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Have you ever wondered why some puzzle pieces just seem to click together too well? I had and that's why I am writing this. Well more like sending this copy. I've written several others already and this is the only one I ever intend to send. </em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Albus Dumbledore is not what he seems. Though you of all people should know that. I studied some forms of genealogy and know of your husband. Though not if he is who I think he is. </em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Apologies for change of subject there Professor. I fear lack of sleep plays a role. I hold several secrets from the Light side. A joke though that supposed side is. </em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Master and Mistress will not like their property being taken from them by other freaks. I don't wish to deal with the pain that I assume belongs to them. Please save me. I'll do anything for you and your husband if it helps. Just don't leave me with these monsters. </em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Thank you Professor,</em> </b>
</p><ol>
<li><b><em> Potter</em></b></li>
</ol><p>
  <b> <em>P.S. I am sending this through the goblins for hope that Ron, Hermione or Dumbledore do not find out.</em> </b>
</p><p>Severus's hand shook slightly as he read the letter that had ink stains and tear splotches covering it. Harry did not even call them Aunt and Uncle. <em> Master and Mistress as if they were some sort of sexual dungeon owners. That is not what a little boy should call his damn relatives. </em></p><p>Rushing out of his study Severus quickly made his way to the library. Thankfully Marvolo was sprawled sexily surrounded by stacks of dark arts books. Most likely working on a new spell. Shaking the thoughts of his husband's body out of his head Severus handed over the letter.</p><p>“Verus?” Marvolo asked his maroon eyes boring into Severus who just gestured to the letter and spun on his heel. It had been two weeks since the school year, Harry's third, came to a finish. That was two weeks of possible abuse.</p><p>Hoping that Poppy and Cissy were available and home he through some floo powder into the grate calling out for Malfoy Mansion.</p><p>“Sev? What do you need? Is something wrong?” Lucius asked worriedly thinking something may have gone wrong with some lower death eaters.</p><p>“Where's Cissy? I need her here in five minutes at best. I'll explain once you are both here. Floo for Poppy too. You know hers is tracked and cant have that old fool knowing about this place.” Severus interrupted his closest friend. He knew this dealing could be taking precious time away from saving Harry but they were all Slytherins. They did not run into an unknown situation. And this would definitely be one.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Harry carefully measured out about a quarter of what he normally ate, ignoring all of the conversations around him, he went back to planning. Tonight, he had decided, would be the night he wrote the letter to the professor. Harry had thought long and hard about what he had wanted to say but knew in the end the it would most likely be winged. Sighing quietly he tuned back into whatever the idiot duo was doing. It looked a bit like arguing to be honest.</p><p>Ron's snores barely bothered anyone else in the room as Harry sat at the window glaring at him. He wanted to quiet him in some way so that he could think but he knew what would happen. It was just like last time he had an urge. Nothing big he just wanted a hug but it still resulted in a painful round of cruciatus. Rubbing a bruise he was not sure which one had given to him at this point he pulled the parchment closer.</p><p>Harry could only hope that Hedwig would know which goblins to give this to. Glancing up he was not surprised to find her waiting for him her leg held out, head tilted as if waiting for a command. Harry smiled and carefully tied the letter on.</p><p>Wiping away any possible remanments of tears Harry instructed her, "Good girl. Take these two letters to the goblins please Hedwig. Don't wait for a response just come back right away. Be safe girl. Bye girl."</p><p>It was not until the next morning that Harry knew someone had found his books. The books he had bought so that he could look into his family. Considering that he had figured out that the books here at Hogwarts were censored. Wondering who could of possibly at least disturbed them was enough to make shivers run down his body. Hoping beyond hope that it was at least the twins and they had not done anything more than glance over them. If it was not Harry knew he was in for some serious trouble.</p><p>Harry woke up just as the Hogwarts Express pulled into King's Cross station. Blinking away the tiredness Harry was lost for how he could have lost a whole day and a half. Glancing into the crowd Harry was not surprised to find the Grangers and Weasleys waiting for Hermione and Ron. He also was not surprised to find that Uncle Vernon was not there. Harry stopped mid thought frozen almost afraid he was going to get hit for thinking of him as Uncle. Breathing deeply as he tried to push that thought out of his head Harry gathered up his things and waited for Master to pick him up.</p><p>The two weeks had passed by like torture...mainly cause it was. Harry was not even sure if he was going to survive to be a fourth year. To become something more than just the boy who lived. Something more than a tool for Albus too many fucking names Dumbledore.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>It had taken just over an hour for Severus, Marvolo, Poppy, Cissy and Lucius to come up with a plan. Only Severus and Marvolo were going to get Harry as he had sent the letter to Severus and had mentioned Marvolo. Poppy and Cissy would get a guest bedroom set up for healing purposes and prepare for anything. Lucius was to contact Rookwood in case they needed to find out what the boy was. He was also to start looking into how they could legally claim the child without any issues.</p><p>Severus had transfigured Marvolo’s and his clothing into a more muggle look. His clothing stayed black except for a very dark grey for his trousers. Grumbling slightly they both stepped out into the gardens where an apparition spot existed. Glancing at each other they nodded and apparated to Privet Drive.</p><p>Marvolo was surprised they should have been pushed away from the street by the “blood wards”. He knew that Lily was not Petunia’s actual sister but that does not mean they don’t share some forms of blood with each other. Hoping that the child was still alive they both pushed their worries aside and rushed towards number four.</p><p>Severus’s hand shook slightly as he knocked on the door. A small part of him hoped that Harry would answer the door and that he was perfectly fine. He wanted to laugh and cry for that small part of himself.</p><p>A whale answered the door, "What the ruddy hell do you want?"</p><p>Marvolo bite his tongue as he considered giving him a good tongue lashing. Severus barely even glanced at him as he stated coldly, “Vernon Dursley? We are here to speak with your nephew Harry Potter.”</p><p>“I don’t got any nephew. You freaks need to get off my property!” The whale, now confirmed as Vernon Dursley, growled out.</p><p>“We just wish to take the child off your hands sir. No harm will come to you or your family if you just give him to us.” Marvolo told him in a soft yet commanding voice.</p><p>“Get in here!” Vernon growled again. Severus and Marvolo silkily slipped past him into the house. Severus’s sensitive nose was assaulted by the horrible smell of muggle aerosol scents but underneath it he caught it. Glancing at his husband he knew he had smelt it too. Blood, sickness and death just a small trace of it the rest was overwhelmed by the smell of fake roses and other cleaning agents.</p><p>“Where’s your nephew sir?” Again Marvolo asked tilting his head slightly. He was trying to play the I will not harm you card. It seemed to be working as Vernon seemed to find him more approachable. Severus caught the lie before it even escaped the man’s gibbering maw.</p><p>“He’s over at one of those friends houses of his. Did not say when he would be back nor did he say which one he was going to.”</p><p>“Mr. Dursley did you know that Lily and her brother were spies for a long time, In fact her brother is still a spy and can catch anyone lying to him without even watching them for signs.” Marolo asked casually, “You, sir, are lying. I am only going to ask you one more time, where. Is. your. Thirteen year old nephew?”   With each word that Marvolo said he leaned a little more forward threateningly glaring at the fat man.</p><p>“Lily and Petunia ain’t got a brother. If they did that little freak would not have been placed in our house. Messing up with the perfectness of it all.” Vernon ignored and dodged the question by talking about another point in Marvolo’s speech.</p><p>“The Evans family adopted two children, Lily when she was for and later on Severus Snape when he was fifteen. Seeing as I am Severus Snape, I think I would know what my pseudo parents did for me.” Severus glared at him as he stood suddenly, “If you will not tell us where he is. I guess I'll just have to look myself." Grabbing his wand Severus casted a point me spell looking for Harry. He was not surprised when the wand warmed in his hand indicating that Harry was nearby.</p><p>Following the pull of his wand he found himself being pulled towards the stairs. <em> Harry could not have been upstairs this whole time even if he feared that whale of a man he would have recognised my voice at the very least. </em> Severus was shocked though that his wand did not have him go up the stairs but focused on a small cupboard hidden underneath them. <em> No..no he could not be in there. That would be torture for anyone. </em></p><p>Gulping Severus slowly cast alohomora on all of the locks and slowly opened the door. Darkness encroached every little nook and cranny Severus could not see anything. Even more worried, Severus flicked his wand causing it light up the small space. Immediately Severus gagged at the sight before him.</p><p>Harry, his little nephew, was sprawled out on a crib mattress surrounded by vomit and other ominous stains. He must have worn a glamour while at school as he was much smaller than he remembered, Severus swore he could see the boy's ribs from where he was sitting. The boy was covered in blood, bruises blooming across his face and there was evidence of several broken bones.<em> This could not be Harry Potter...how did he miss the signs and for so long...this was part of his own fault...Harry was lucky to even be alive. </em> Severus fell to his knees as tears slowly poured down his face. Grief overwhelming his logical side of taking the child out of there healing him as best he could.</p><p>Shaking himself, Severus carefully pulled Harry out, gently cradling him against his chest he stepped into the living room where the two other men were waiting. Marvolo gasped at seeing the state of his nephew. He had last seen this child as a baby, a healthy one held in the exact same way his husband was holding him now. Harry was not much bigger than when he had last seen him.</p><p>Marvolo vowed silently to himself that he would never allow Harry to be hurt like this again. Never would he allow Harry to be tortured like this again. None deserved this but definitely not Harry. Anyone who had caused this, contributed to Harry's current state was going to pay. Glancing up into Severus's blazing black eyes he knew that he felt the same way. Barely casting another look towards Vernon they apparated on the spot back to their manor to heal the child.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
