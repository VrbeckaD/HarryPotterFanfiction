    <p>Dear, Draco</p><p>Im not sure why im writing this or if ill even send it. Maybe something in me wants to warn you. Or maybe I want to just vent. I don’t know really. I have been with Severus for 7 long years. The time we have spent together in my opinion had been the most amazing magical time in my whole life. But im sure you feel the same way. Probably wrapped in his strong arms right now as im writing this. Im sure your thinking that you won that his love is all yours now. I couldn’t really fault you for that. I know how he works he swears up and down he'd only cheat for you. That he loves you so much more. Hell sit there and butter you up by bringing up what he claims are my meany faults. Tearing me down while building you up. How do I know exactly what he's said to you? That’s easy because your not the first and most certainly not the last person he's been unfaithful with. That’s just who he is. I used to get mad and swore over and over that this would be the last time. That I couldn’t love a man who hurt me so much. Who broke me over and over. Casting me aside when he didn’t need me. But every time he would come crawling back and id realized I still loved him more then the sun and stars. When I was pregnant and he committed what I felt was the ultimate infraction with you in our living room while I laid in our bedroom sobbing. I thought to myself - “this is it I cant do this anymore I wont ever come back” I'm sure you remember me storming out 7 months pregnant. You moved in and had a life of sorts I guess. I was wrong then and every time before. No matter how cruel he is or how he breaks me I still love him. I came back you where thrown out just as cruelly if not more by the time I had our daughter . That is when I accepted it. No longer do I cry or feel broken when he leaves. I don’t badger him with questions about where he's been or what he did. Im sure it looks like I have a very misguided trust in him. Especially because you scream and hex those very questions at him every time he sees me. I don’t. I don’t trust him anymore then I would have trusted voldemort with a kitten. I just don’t care anymore. I want him to be happy that’s all that matters. And if sneaking around with you while I take care of our beautiful daughter makes him happy then so be it. I can live with it because I know he loves me. All these 7 years we never really stopped not truly. He would make promises to others for a life time together but after a week he'd sneak back to me. Crying about how only I made him truly happy. Every time. Even now. He tells you he sleeps on the couch. He sleeps with his arms around me in our bed. He tells you we haven't had sex in weeks. We had sex a few hours before he met up with you. It was wild and passionate. He whispered that he loved me when we where done. He does I know at least that is true. You will be forgotten in a month and he will be all mine again. I tell myself one day ill walk away. One day ill find someone who treats me better. But me and him both known that’s a lie. Because I love him and he loves me so we’re doomed to repeat this cycle till the end of time. </p><p>I think I just love being broken by him. </p><p>                    Much love, Harry Potter</p>
