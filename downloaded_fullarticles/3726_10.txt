</blockquote><p> </p><p>Draco.</p><p>Draco.</p><p>Draco.</p><p>His name drips through Harry’s brain like the specks of condensation raining down the window of his soul- not quite reaching his eyes but always there, always threatening to become something more, more, more.</p><p>Draco.</p><p>Harry decides it’s a horrible name. It spells destruction, pain, mystery, and Harry hates it.</p><p>Even the way it sounds, for Christ’s sake. Yes, it's a horrible name.</p><p>.</p><p>It’s not supposed to be like this.</p><p>It was never supposed to be like this, <em>so why is it like this?</em> Harry thinks irritably, desperately, achingly.</p><p>Irritable, irritable, irritable.</p><p>Always bloody irritable with fucking Malfoy.</p><p>Always has been, always will be.</p><p>.</p><p><em>Temporary</em>, Harry’s mind whispers.</p><p>Temporary, temporary, temporary.</p><p>A quick fix.</p><p>Harry’s not sure what else it was.</p><p>He thinks they need each other.</p><p>He knows he needs Draco.</p><p>He doesn't know, actually.</p><p>He decides to sleep.</p><p>.</p><p>Perfectly dark. Not a light is in sight.</p><p>Harry inhales the night. It’s dangerous, too much like <em>him</em>, too much like what it isn’t supposed to be.</p><p>The air compresses in his lungs, cracks his chest wide open, spills his heart all over the mattress, the floor, the flat, everywhere.</p><p>Harry doesn’t like the darkness, he decides, and turns on the light.</p><p>.</p><p>The light doesn’t help.</p><p>His mind’s on a field trip today (tonight? Who knows), chipping in unhelpfully with every tiny spot of what shouldn’t matter but does, it matters the world, it is the world, and Harry’s not ok, and he needs help, and <em>where</em> <em>is he</em> for fuck’s sake-</p><p>The world is too quiet, he thinks, just as a sharp rap touches his door, touches his soul, touches him in ways he never before imagined.</p><p>.</p><p>He lies still.</p><p>It’s not him. It can’t be him. It’s been too long.</p><p>But.</p><p>But what if it<em> is</em>.</p><p>Harry screws his eyes shut. <em>Please</em>, he thinks.</p><p>He’s not sure what he’s pleading for.</p><p>.</p><p>The door sounds again, and Harry’s mind is awake.</p><p>Harry’s out of the bed in a flash.</p><p><em>Fuck, fuck,</em> he thinks. <em>It’s him, it’s him, it’s him</em>!</p><p>Throwing open the door, he stops.</p><p>.</p><p>It’s not him.</p><p>It’s Luna, bearing flowers and a sad smile.</p><p>It’s daytime, then.</p><p>It's awfully bright, and the sky is blue.</p><p>Harry doesn’t know how the world goes on.</p><p>.</p><p>He doesn’t know what happens next, but the door’s closed and he’s on the floor and it hurts, <em>god damnit</em>, it hurts.</p><p>It hurts so much.</p><p>"Please", he croaks inexplicably. His voice is too loud in the dark flat, too big for this small place.</p><p>He doesn’t know the last time he’s used it.</p><p>He doesn’t know anything anymore- he’s not sure he ever did.</p><p>.</p><p>The floor is uncomfortable.</p><p>Very uncomfortable, but it doesn’t stop Harry from lying on it for hours.</p><p>His mind is a mess, a mantra of <em>Draco</em>, <em>Draco</em>, <em>Draco</em> over and over again.</p><p>Harry hates him, he thinks.</p><p>He doesn’t really know.</p><p>.</p><p>Sleep is a very funny thing.</p><p>She catches you at the strangest times, sometimes a hero, sometimes not.</p><p>But she always catches you, with her soft skin and comforting sighs and tales that stretch on for years.</p><p>Tonight, Harry welcomes her.</p><p>.</p><p>It’s so dark, and Harry doesn’t know where he is.</p><p>For a split moment, he thinks he’s in <em>his</em> bed and that it's last month, and almost rolls over.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>And then he remembers.</p><p><em>Life is a cruel, cruel game</em>, he thinks, as he lies in the pitch black grasp of his demons.</p><p>.</p><p>Maybe he falls asleep again.</p><p>He doesn’t know.</p><p>It’s so dark and he feels so cold, so isolate.</p><p>Perhaps he should open the curtains.</p><p>.</p><p>He can’t.</p><p>His body won’t let him.</p><p>The war ruined him, and Draco helped fix the mess.</p><p>Harry thinks he’s trapped in his mind, which is screaming at him to <em>move, move, move</em>.</p><p>He can’t.</p><p>.</p><p>There’s a knock at the door.</p><p><em>Repetition</em>, Harry thinks.</p><p>He lies still, in the same position that he was in all those hours ago.</p><p>His heart is full of lead, and he can’t move.</p><p>The door knocks again.</p><p><em>Get up</em>, it says. <em>Get up, Harry. Get up</em>.</p><p>It sounds like Draco.</p><p>.</p><p>It’s so dark, and he’s so cold.</p><p><em>Loneliness</em>, he thinks as he shuffles out into the hall, <em>is the worst thing in this life</em>.</p><p>No.</p><p>It’s not.</p><p>His brain pounds behind his weary eyes, and his stomach fills with bile.</p><p>He doesn’t know when he last ate.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry rests his head against the dark doorframe.</p><p><em>There’s someone on the other side</em>, he thinks.</p><p>He would like to say he doesn’t care, but he does.</p><p>He does. He cares so, so much.</p><p>It’s terrifying.</p><p>.</p><p><em>It’s so bright</em>, Harry thinks, as he opens the door and keeps his eyes trained on the doorstep.</p><p>The concrete glows against his tired eyes, and he smiles.</p><p>At least the rest of the world is working.</p><p>.</p><p>There’s a pair of shoes on the doorstep, and Harry studies them.</p><p><em>They're awfully scuffed</em>, he thinks, and then:</p><p>
  <em>They must belong to someone.</em>
</p><p>Perhaps the person wearing them.</p><p>He hears a sharp gasp and his gaze lifts.</p><p><em>It’s him</em>.</p><p>.</p><p>Draco’s hair is long and scraggly. His eyes are scrubbed red, and he looks like how Harry feels.</p><p>"No", Harry thinks- maybe he says it. "This isn’t real."</p><p>But it’s him.</p><p>It’s him, and he smiles a watery smile, chokes- maybe on a laugh, maybe on a sob- and says:</p><p>"Hi", before brushing away a stray tear with long, ringed fingers.</p><p>.</p><p>It's him.</p><p><em>It's Draco</em>, Harry thinks.</p><p>And the sky collapses.</p></div>
