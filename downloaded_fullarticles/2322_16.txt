<hr/><p>Â </p><p>You're walking through Diagon Alley on your way to Flourish and Blotts. You don't exactly need any more books, you've got quite the collection going of ones you still haven't read, but you can't help it. There's something so soothing about the ceiling high stacks of books, and the smell of ancient paper that fills the shop. It's such a beautiful day, you can't bare to leave your beloved dog at home, so you got out his leash, and decided to take him with you. Normally pets aren't allowed inside the store, but you're good friends with the owners, and they know how sweet and well behaved he is. They're also kind enough not to judge you on your choice to get such a muggle dog breed. Your other friends don't understand why you didn't just get a Krup, but you always just shrug. One day you saw an old lady walking her Corgi down the street, and you fell in love with the stout fluffy things. Just as you're approaching the store, the dog somehow slips his collar and takes off down the street. You groan and run after him, calling his name. You turn a corner still in pursuit, and your heart speeds up when you see the Corgi make to turn down Knockturn Alley. You call out his name one more time, still too far away to grab him, and worried you're going to lose him. Luckily, he stops dead when a large man steps in front of him, effectively blocking his path.</p><p>"Whoah there! Wouldn't want to be going down there, if I were you. Not a good place for little dogs like you."</p><p>You run over panting, and quickly scoop up the dog. You stand back up with him in your arms, looking up in time to see the man smile and nod his head at the bundle in your arms.</p><p>"<em>Is he yours, then?</em>"</p><p>You inhale sharply, the words on your ankle tingling in a way they haven't since the marks first appeared.</p><p>"<em>Y-yes. I'm sorry, I don't know what came over him</em>."</p><p>The man chuckles, and you know he's realized the same thing you have. "Ahh, I always say that animals often know things we don't."</p><p>You smile. You can't help but think he may be right.</p>
