    <p>Captain Roark Durin Peverell Potter-Lestrange, or just Roark Lestrange now that it had become such a mouthful to say his full name, stared down at the file he held in his hands in complete horror, and he wasn't, by any means, the only one.  All of the Officers of Counter-Intelligence that had survived the annihilation of the Colonies were in the conference room, some sitting at the table, some standing, leaning against the metal walls, or sitting on the carpeted floor.  All of them had the same looks of horror on their faces as they looked at the file that had been handed to each of them as they had entered the conference room.  Beside him, his husband Rodolphus swore harshly as he turned the pages, and next to him on the right, his brother Harry was shaking his head in disbelief, his emerald eyes wide in horror, as the realization of just how many they had lost began to penetrate his dazed mind.</p><p>Sitting next to Harry, his husband Rabastan was reacting just had Rodolphus had, by swearing sharply as he reached the last page of the report.  They looked up, looking around the room as they heard several others swearing harshly as well.  "We're not going to have enough warriors to make up the squadrons for each of the Battlestar's," Rodolphus said in a far harsher tone than he had intended, turning to look at the three men sitting at the head of the table.</p><p>Admiral Roark Durin, Commander Thorin Durin and Commander Adama looked at him, each of them nodding as they looked up from the report lying on the table before them.  "Twenty-five warriors from the Galactica have survived, twenty from the Solaria, ten from the Acropolis, a few from the other Battlestar's that had managed to launch their vipers," a deep sigh was heard.  "Well, we're going to have no choice," he turned his head to look at Thorin, "we're going to have to go ahead and put the cadets in uniform, whether they're ready or not, and get them viper trained as fast as possible in these circumstances."</p><p>Thorin nodded as Roark leaned forward to look past Rodolphus.  "How many cadets are there, Papa?" he asked quietly.</p><p>"Just over sixty from the graduating class.  Fifty from third yahren, fifty-five from second, and fourty-three from first."</p><p>He lay the file he held on the table beside his open laptop, which was, as usual, humming as it worked on whatever information he had imputed into it.  "So," he sat back in his chair, looking around the room, "we have three Battlestar's, two of which are still being repaired as we move, just over three hundred refugee ships, some of which probably shouldn't even be flying, which we must protect with a handfull of fully trained warriors, those us in Counter-Intelligence, and approximately 210 cadets, that we're going to have to train as we go."</p><p>"That about sums it up, little brother," Dacian said, looking up from where he sat beside their father.  "We are also going to have to go ship to ship, check on their status, check for solium leaks.  Then we'll have to evaluate the passengers, check how much food, water, and fuel they have, as well as their medical supplies."</p><p>"Which we have already begun to do in teams of three to five," Thorin spoke up as his nephew's laptop, as well as several others that had been working, beeped, making their owners turn their attention to them.  "Rory? Boys?</p><p>He looked up, shaking his head.  "Nothing we can do anything about, even were we able too," he told them quietly, his silver eyes troubled by what he was reading on his screen.</p><p>"The Cylons," Chris began from his place near the end of the table, lifting his eyes from the screen, "have returned to the Colonies.  They're going through each planet, killing anyone they can find, I'm sure."</p><p>"On every planet it's the same," Dante said, "radiation levels are high, and still climbing.  It's going to make them unlivable for a very long time, and those that DO manage to survive the Cylon extermination?  Well, they will be living in their shelters for yahrens, and that's even given that they stocked enough food, water, medical supplies and clothing they're going to need to survive that long."</p><p>Gwydion sat forward, his face much paler than normal given the injuries he had sustained from crash landing on the Acropolis and hitting the back wall.  He was being very closely monitored by the doctor's and healers of their group, making sure he didn't overdue, that he got the rest he needed.  "There's also the radiation sickness many of them will be suffering from, as well .  I'll be very surprised if anyone survives on any of the Colonies for long."</p><p>"Which is unlikely given the levels we're seeing," Rabastan said grimly, looking over at their three commanding officers.  "So, what are we going to do now?  Where will we go?"</p><p>Roark Durin Sr. sat back in his chair.  "Roark has been promoted to Commander and will be taking over command of the Solaria.  Commander Adama and Colonel Tigh have both agree to move to the Acropolis to take command there, and Thorin, with Dacian as his second, will have command of the Galactica.  I will be remaining here, Admiral Maxwell will be going to the Solaria and Admiral Jenkins will go to the Acropolis."  He looked around the table at the men gathered around the room.  "As for Counter-Intelligence, our jobs will remain as they were, but we will be re-working the teams, then assigning you to one of the Battlestar's.  If you have a request, be sure to put it in and if the numbers aren't too uneven, that will be where you go."</p><p>"At our current numbers," Gabriel spoke up for the first time, "that will give the Galactica fifteen teams, the Solaria and the Acropolis fourteen teams each.  Also, as Greyson was the Solaria's Strike Commander, his death leaves a void.  Roark will be looking for a new Strike Commander, as will we as Apollo has asked to be transferred to the Acropolis with his father.  Any of you that would like to apply for the position, please see Uncle Thorin or Dacian.  They will let you know their decision within the secton."</p><p>"As for where we will be going..." Adama began, "we are going to look for a planet.  A planet called...Earth."</p><p>Harry sat forward suddenly.  "Grandfather, Earth is a myth, a bedtime story told to children.  Mum and Dad told me the story several times before their deaths."</p><p>"No, Harry, it isn't.  The Book of Kobol tells us of the Thirteenth Lord, how he and his people continued on their journey after the Colonies were settled by the first Twelve Lords, looking for a planet that was called Earth."  </p><p>Roark sat forward.  "I've read the passages you're talking about, Grandfather.  The Lords that founded and settled our Colonies lost all contact with him not long after he continued his journey.  How do you intend to trace the steps of a Lord who, by all accounts, has been lost to history, all references to him little more than supposition?"</p><p>"By beginning to follow the few co-ordinances that we DO have.  I am fully aware it's a long shot, but I believe that we must try."</p><p>Roark's laptop chose that moment to issue several beeps, turning more than a few heads to him , some smirking.  "Given your expression, do we even want to know?"  Roark asked his cousin as he turned to read what had appeared on his screen.</p><p>He turned his head from the screen after typing out a few words.  "Probably not, but I'll tell you anyway.  The Cylons have sent a Baseship to Borealis.  They're requesting aide."</p><p>Swearing around the room as all of them knew, as much as they wanted to, there was absolutely nothing that they could do.  "What about our other trading Allies?" came the question.</p><p>He nodded shortly.  "Chris, Damien and I sent short, coded messages to them, so that they would at least have some warning, but I seriously doubt it's going to do much good at this point.  The Cylons, thanks to Baltar's betrayal, know all of the planets that we were trading with," the laptop beeped and he glanced down.  "Baseship's have appeared at several of them already.  We are going to have look much further afield then we had intended for whatever supplies we are going to be needing."</p><p>A nod.  "Start working on that, son," Roark ordered him.  "We're going to be needing supplies like food, fuel, water, medical supplies and clothing sooner, rather than later, I'm thinking."  He saw him nod, turning to his laptop and beginning to type.  Chris, Damien, Dante and Gwydion doing the same.  "Alright people, let's get to work.  We have over three hundred refugee ships to inspect, and nowhere near enough technical teams to go around.  See Chris for a list of things to look for, and the equipment to do it."</p><p>"Yes Sir," they all said as they got to their feet and moved toward the door.</p><p>                                                                                            cccVccc</p><p>He pressed his hand to the pad beside the closed door, hearing a call to enter a few microns later.  Stepping forward, the door slid open silently at his approach, and he entered the room to find, to his complete surprise, Admiral Roark, Admiral Maxwell, Admiral Jenkins, Commander Thorin, Commander Adama, Commander Roark, Lt. Commander Dacian, and Colonel Gabriel sitting at a semi circle table.  Further back in the shadows of the room near the far back wall, stood someone he could not see clearly.</p><p>"Come in, Lt. Starbuck," came the stern voice of Admiral Maxwell.  "Have a seat and we can get this started.  Yours is not the only case we have to hear today."  He looked up from the file he had been looking through, his expression as stern as his tone.</p><p>"Yes, Sir, but...I'm at a loss as to why I was asked to report here." </p><p>"Charges of dereliction of duty have been levied against you, Lt. Starbuck."  Commander Adama answered in a quiet tone, his expression just as stern as the others that were looking at him as he waved to the file sitting on the table not far from him.</p><p>Starbuck froze for a moment, looking at each of them.  "Dereliction of duty, Sir?" he asked, now moving to the table to pull out the chair and take a seat.  He pulled the file close, opened it, began to read, his face paling.  Once he had turned the last page, he looked up to look at them once again, thinking he knew who had levied the charges, and WHY.  Sudden movement drew his attention, and his head turned to see him stepping out of the shadows, to the end of the table.</p><p>"You would be wrong, Lieutenant," came his harshly spoken deep voice as he looked at him with narrowed, cold sienna eyes.  "Roark has no idea about this as of yet.  I will be speaking to him as soon as he returns from his patrol.  Lt. Colonel Rodolphus Lestrange, Colonial Counter-Intelligence, and the Galactica's new Strike Commander.  I am the one who is levying these charges against you after a thorough investigation into your action the day of the ambush."</p><p>Roark's husband, Starbuck thought, suddenly not really surprised as it was said that Rodolphus adored his husband, and would do anything for him.</p><p>"Did you, Lt. Starbuck, inform your on duty Commanding Officer, Colonel Tigh, and your then Strike Commander, Captain Apollo, that you were not feeling well enough to take your assigned duty patrol the day of the Cylon ambush?"</p><p>"I...did, Sir," he answered, looking over at Admiral Jenkins, who had been the one asking.</p><p>"You were then released from said patrol by Colonel Tigh, were you not, Lieutenant?" asked Admiral Maxwell, looking at him with a cool, disapproving gaze.</p><p>"Yes, Sir, I was."</p><p>"At which point you SHOULD have reported to the Life Center to be examined by either Healer-Lt. Colonel Severus, Doctor-Major Sebastien, or Doctor-Major Robin.  DID you report to the Life Center, Lt. Starbuck?"</p><p>"No, Sir, I didn't."</p><p>They looked at him with stern, very disapproving looks.  "No, Lieutenant, you did not.  You instead went straight to the Officer's Club, where you then entered into a Pyramid game with two visiting Officer's from the Gemaria and several others, ordered several drinks, and smoked several cigarillo's," Commander Thorin spoke up.  "Very strange actions for a man who told his Commanding Officers that he was not well enough to take his assigned patrol duty."</p><p>I...yes, Sir," he said, seeing the look of utter fury in Rodolphus eyes.</p><p>"Then, Lieutenant, we have no choice but to find you guilty of dereliction of duty.  As we need all of our Warriors given our circumstances, the standard punishment can not be enacted, which is the immediate, dishonorable discharge of the guilty party from the Colonial Armed Services."</p><p>"Instead, Lt. Starbuck," Admiral Roark sat forward, "you will be placed on probation.  When you are not on duty, you will be confined to your quarters until you are told otherwise.  You are to have no contact with any of your friends, or your fellow Officer's outside of duty time.  Is that clear, Lt. Starbuck?"</p><p>"It is, Admiral."</p><p>"Then you are hereby dismissed," Roark Sr. turned his head.  "Rodolphus, will you please escort Lt. Starbuck to his quarters, where you, Lieutenant, are to stay until it is time for you to return to duty."</p><p>Starbuck stood, saluted, then turned to leave the room, the silent, threatening presence of Lt. Colonel Rodolphus Lestrange at his side.  "Why?" he asked finally, turning his head to look up at him.</p><p>"Because his Uncle, as well as several of his cousins, died."  They reached the door to Starbuck's quarters, where they stopped, Rodolphus looking at him with a look that made Starbuck shudder.  "Because it very nearly destroyed the man I love beyond life itself.  Your actions that day, Lieutenant, were immature and totally out of line.  You are an Officer in the Colonial Armed Services, and you have a job to do.  You blew off that job for a fucking game of PYRAMID.  Given all that has happened these last couple of sectars, I think you need to think about your priorities, and what this job really means to you."</p><p>Pressing his hand to the pad beside the door, it slid open and Starbuck entered.  "When it is time for you to return to duty, the Counter-Intelligence team assigned to you will be here to collect you." </p><p>The door slid closed and Starbuck heard the security lock activate.</p><p> </p><p>A/N  Well, here we go.  The first chapter done.  I will post the second chapter as soon as I've gotten it written.  Hope you enjoy and please leave a few words to let me know what you think.</p><p>                                                              Acaciarose</p><p> </p>
