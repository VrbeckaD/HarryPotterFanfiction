  <span>Seeing the cursed man in front of him made him pause.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Not quite a beast, not quite a man.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But fully in control.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>His skin was so pale it appeared to blend in with the sheets. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Pushing past the questions, the boy was maneuvered around their shoulders. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After moving down the stairs, they made for the door.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He raised an eyebrow at the family cowering away from them. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>The blood was cleaned off him, but the white lines of scars remained.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When they passed the wards, he took the boy fully in his arms.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A pained sound gargled past his lips in response. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Taking a deep breath, he rushed away with a spell. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>They hadn’t said much, just staring at the boy they had failed.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The wolf behind him started to make floo calls from his fireplace.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A healer.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A friend.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“I should have known. I should have seen it.” The dark haired man whispered.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It took three healers, sworn to secrecy, to heal him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After an hour, one had to stop from exhaustion.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The other two pushed forward.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“You’re not the only one that failed him,” The other whispered back.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Broken ribs. Blood loss.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Infections. Torn muscles.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Concussions. Malnutrition.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>The fell back into silence. Watching the chest of a broken boy rise and fall.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The list seemed to never end.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The healer of hogwarts had downed whiskey straight from the bottle when they finished.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The other sat down with a haunted look.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“He’s going to need all the help he can get.” He stated pushing a hand through shaggy hair.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They agreed he would live.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That he would need to be watched and monitored for awhile. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That his body would be fine.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“A mind healer, a nutritionist, potions, physical therapy,” He started to tick off.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was his mind that they were concerned with. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That he may never fully recover.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That he might not ever be the same again.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“We’ll be there.” He cut the other off. “We’ll help him every step of the way.” </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They stayed up until the late hours working out a routine.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Promises of finding people to keep quiet.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A plan to fix what was broken.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“And if he doesn’t heal?”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A blond promised to find connections outside of Britain just in case.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A burnette gave a list of private investigators.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The healer of hogwarts swore to keep a meddling headmaster away.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Then we’ll burn all those who wronged him.”</span>
  </em>
