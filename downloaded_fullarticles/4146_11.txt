    <p>Hermione Granger was exhausted. Not too strange, considering that the time was four am. <em>Damn you, guilty pleasure,</em> she thought as she turned off the television and the Playstation 4.</p>
    <p><em>One should think I'd had enough of violence,</em> she thought as she was brushing her teeth, <em>considering I fought in a bloody war. Literally a bloody war.</em></p>
    <p>The war ended seventeen years ago, though, and although Hermione still had nightmares sometimes, and if someone startled her, she had them at wandpoint in less than a second, she was no longer <em>traumatized</em>.</p>
    <p>She had finished her schooling after the war, and then she had begun working in the Ministry of Magic. She had also taken her Masters in potions, charms, and transfiguration, and for the last four years, she had worked as a volunteer at St Mungos two or three times a week. Her free time was spent with friends, or creating new potions or charms.</p>
    <p>And that was just <em>some</em> of the things she had done over the years.</p>
    <p>Basically, she was rather busy.</p>
    <p>One should think that was enough.</p>
    <p><em>But it isn't, now is it?</em> she thought as she undressed and got into bed. <em>You're bored, aren't you?</em></p>
    <p>She had to admit it was the truth. Hermione Granger was bored. Her years at Hogwarts had been..exciting. Rather <em>too</em> exciting, one should think, and she <em>had</em> thought that, tried to convince herself of it, at least.</p>
    <p>There was a reason, however, for why she kept herself so busy. She was restless, and it was as if she was searching for something, craving <em>more</em> of life.</p>
    <p>She hadn't quite realised what that something was until she had a ridiculous moment where she heard her own voice in her head.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Oh, Merlin, I almost miss Voldemort.</em>
    </p>
    <p>She had been appalled by herself, but blamed the ridiculous notion on the fact that she had been in the weekly ministry meeting, and had been bored to tears.</p>
    <p>Except that..the thought returned, sometimes, and she hated herself for thinking that way.</p>
    <p>Of course, it wasn't exactly Voldemort she missed, not really, it was <em>her life</em> while Voldemort terrorised the Wizarding World she missed.</p>
    <p>Who knew Hermione Granger was an adrenaline junkie.</p>
    <p>Then, about three years ago, she had discovered a marvellous invention called Playstation. And with it, she had discovered the marvellous world of <em>gaming.</em></p>
    <p>She had, during the last three years, spent <em>countless</em> hours gaming, and had an impressive collection of games. Not that she played very many of them. She basically played <em>three</em> games. Dragon Age Origins, Dragon Age 2, and Dragon Age Inquisition.</p>
    <p>She had completed them both at least ten times, and was currently twenty hours into her seventeenth, or so, playthrough of Dragon Age Inquisition.</p>
    <p>She had just arrived in Skyhold.</p>
    <p><em>Damn you guilty pleasure, damn you fun-to-kill-monsters,</em> she thought as she realised she had to a portkey to catch in less than seven hours. <em>Oh, well, at least you have packed.</em></p>
    <p>She had finished packing days ago, and she once again thanked magic as her eyes fell on her small, leather bag. Her <em>enchanted,</em> small, leather bag.</p>
    <p><em>I could probably survive at least five years, living in the woods with the content of that tiny bag,</em> she thought, <em>but then again, I am going to be on the move for the next year, so who cares if I have brought half of everything I own.</em></p>
    <p>One year was a long time, after all, and she would go mad without her books, her research, her clothes, her favourite elf-made wine, (they didn't have said wine in the States, as far as she was aware) and her..well, everything. Even a ridiculous amount of galleons, because she had every intention of buying presents for everyone, and she suspected she would be making quite a lot of purchases for herself as well. It was not every day one went to the United States.</p>
    <p>The paranoid post-war part of her had also joined in on the packing, and she had five tents in different sizes, extra wands, a ridiculous amount of potions, and everything she would need to survive, basically.</p>
    <p>And then there was the fact that she was going to spend the next year travelling around in the United States, a tour, basically, where she would give lectures in advanced Charms, and Potions, and how-to-invent-and-create-new-potions-and-charms, and also how to merge said invent-and-create-projects.</p>
    <p>Ergo, her bag contained the materials, as she needed them in her lectures, because her lectures were practical for the most part. And Hermione Granger had no intention of using second-grade materials and ingredients, so she brought her own.</p>
    <p><em>Stop fussing over it,</em> she thought as she curled up in the bed, <em>you are fully prepared, and have everything you need.</em></p>
    <p>Sighing, she flicked a finger to turn off the lights, and closed her eyes to get some sleep.</p>
    <p>-o-</p>
    <p><em>Merlin, why did I have to spend six hours playing Dragon Age,</em> she thought as she brushed her teeth the next morning. <em>Gods, I'm tired.</em></p>
    <p>After showering and getting dressed, she picked up her bag, pulled her wand, and focused on the apparition point outside the ministry.</p>
    <p><em>Gods, this is going to be boring, </em>she thought, <em>because Mr Willington has to be the most boring man in the entire world. Wish I could go on epic adventures with The Dread Wolf instead.</em></p>
    <p>With that thought, Hermione disapparated.</p>
    <p>The world came into view again, and Hermione gasped for breath. Her apparation had been dreadful, and it felt like she had apparated to the other side of the planet.</p>
    <p>She quickly realised she was not in the ministry. <em>What the hell? </em> she thought as she took in her surroundings. The room she was in looked..familiar. Oh, so familiar. Why did it look so bloody familiar?</p>
    <p>It looked like...no...no, she was just confused, that was all. Dreaming. She had to be dreaming. Because if she wasn't dreaming, she was standing in the middle of Skyhold. In the main hall, more specifically.</p>
    <p>"Flashy entrance there, I must say! But, who are you, exactly?"</p>
    <p>Hermione spun around, but what she saw did nothing to make the situation any less surreal.</p>
    <p>"Varric?" she whispered. "Are you real? Is this real?"</p>
    <p>The short man gazed at her with puzzled eyes for a long moment. "I am real, as far as I know. As for the rest? Afraid so."</p>
    <p>"Oh, shit," Hermione breathed. "Just... Oh, shit."</p>
