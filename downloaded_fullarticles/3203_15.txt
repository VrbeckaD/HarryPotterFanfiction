    <p>“Slytherin sucks!”</p>
<p>Severus stood at the door of his quarters. He sighed. On his desk a small figurine of a lion waggled its arse at him and shouted obscenities about his House. After the initial burst of profanity, it huffed, shook its mane and curled up again on his desk, just as it had every day since Minerva had snuck it in. </p>
<p>She’d taken the loss of that particular quidditch game against Slytherin very hard, particularly when he’d coloured her hair green without her noticing until Hooch had told her admiringly she was ‘rocking the new do’. The lion had been her little revenge, but Severus had enjoyed it immensely and kept it on his table ever since. It never failed to make him smile, at least, it hadn’t until today. </p>
<p>Now the lion was a reminder that he wouldn’t have any more late night terrible whiskey with Minerva, or the shared withering looks in the staff room or even the pleasant taunting over quidditch matches. Instead, there would by icy silence and isolation. He looked around his room, at the chess game he and Flitwick would never finish, the terrible smutty book Hooch had thrust into his hands with a wink and the odd, bobbly, woollen beanie Trelawney had given him last winter as she said she’d thought his head might get cold in the dungeons. It was probably the ugliest hat he had ever seen in his life, but it was kindly meant so he’d taken it and put it on top of his foe glass. </p>
<p>The foe glass was utterly useless now, so crowded it was with an endless shifting procession of enemies. Mostly it was Potter, staring out with accusing eyes with a shifty looking Weasley in the background—Ronald he assumed, that seemed to be Potter’s personal favourite of the menagerie. They obviously weren’t with the Granger girl anymore, as she’d never appeared with them. He briefly wondered if she were dead, but then thought if that were true it would be news amongst the Death Eaters. She may have gone into hiding, and, given her conspicuous absence from the glass, was obviously no longer with the Order or Potter. That was probably a shame, thought Severus, Potter and Weasley could have used someone with more than half a brain. Today the foeglass showed a shadowy but recognisably dour Minerva, she was obviously thinking of him moving into the Headmaster’s quarters. Wonderful.</p>
<p>Severus decided that standing at the doorway doing nothing was just depressing, so he set about shrinking his belongings in preparation for the move. Slughorn was going to take over as head of Slytherin, and Severus had left him a pile of notes regarding academic performance, students in need of extra attention and a variety of other important background details on his charges. He’d left Slughorn some books he’d procured on anxiety, trauma and sleep disorders. He hadn’t quite managed to get his head around the issue plaguing the senior girls, who seemed to suffer from an unusually high level of sleep issues including night terrors and insomnia. </p>
<p>He’d hypothesised it could be bullying at school, issues at home, academic anxiety, relationship problems but none of those had seemed to be the cause. Well, Severus thought, it was Slughorn’s riddle to solve now. He would no longer have his own terrible sleeping habits disturbed by regular knocks on his door. He’d remembered to also add in a note to Slughorn to make sure the Warming charms on the dormitories were checked regularly, as the older girls appeared to prefer to sleep in practically nothing. Severus didn’t particularly care either way, but he’d tried to impart on them how much less likely they would be to get sick if they would just put on a robe before wandering through the icy dungeons at night. As always, no one listened to him.</p>
<p>Moving in to the Headmasters quarters involved clearing all of Albus’ belongings out. Severus tried to get through it as quick as possible, shrinking and packing, shrinking and packing. He then started enlarging his own items to fill the suddenly barren rooms.</p>
<p>“Feeling at home yet Severus?” asked portrait Albus in a warm voice.</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” replied Severus, not bothering to look up from stacking books on shelves. “It was my lifelong dream to murder someone and then live in their rooms.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t murder but, was it?” Albus countered. “It was necessary. It was our agreement.”</p>
<p>“If you say so,” said Severus. </p>
<p>He stood, having finished with unpacking. A House Elf appeared with a dinner tray, shot him a baleful glance then disappeared. Severus looked at the inviting meal, which looked and smelled amazing. He was starving. He frowned. Starving but not stupid. He cast a diagnostic spell over the meal. It was poisoned. He sighed and sat down heavily at the desk. His eyes fell of the bottle of wine Lucius had given him when he left the Manor this morning, bound for Hogwarts. </p>
<p>“You’ll need this,” Lucius had said with a wink as he’d slipped Severus the bottle. “Careful, it’s expensive.”</p>
<p>Severus lifted the bottle. Well, at least he could have a liquid dinner. He opened the wine and poured a glass. A pair of pale blue eyes briefly flashed quickly across the foeglass. Severus closed his eyes and groaned. He recast the diagnostic. </p>
<p>Poisoned. </p>
<p>Of course it was. </p>
<p>Fucking Lucius. Fucking Elves. </p>
<p>He leant back in the chair and looked up at the ceiling which Albus had charmed to simulate the night sky. He made a sudden decision. Before he could change his mind he threw off his robe and coat and strode to the Headmaster’s apparation point. Five minutes later he was in a small Chinese restaurant tucked away in a less busy section of central London. He’d been there before a few times and the owners recognised him, smiling. </p>
<p>He ate dinner, enjoying the fact that people were engaging with him in a vaguely pleasant manner. After he left, he stopped at a Tesco and purchased some ready-meals and other items which he immediately put under stasis and shrunk, and a case of wine, which also was miniaturised and packed away. He sat on a bench for a while, watching people walk past, slightly buzzing from the ale he had drunk with dinner. He wasn’t quite ready to return to the castle. He thought he should feel it was rather ironic that the only people he currently felt relaxed around were muggles, but he just really didn’t feel anything at all. He was bone tired, which worried him, as the real work hadn’t even started yet.</p>
<p>When he returned to Hogwarts he made his way automatically to the dungeons before suddenly remembering he didn’t live there anymore. He slowly trod up towards the Headmaster lodgings. The meal and wine were still there. Severus stood there, looking at both for a while. He Vanished most of the meal, then played with the rest using the cutlery. When he decided it looked dissected enough he summoned an Elf. They looked at the remains of the meal and back at Severus.</p>
<p>“Delicious,” he said, as neutrally as he could. “My compliments to the kitchens.” </p>
<p>The Elf disappeared without a word, as did the remains of the meal. Severus sat down and penned a note for Lucius.</p>
<p>
  <i>Alas my dear Lucius the wine you graciously gifted me with was of unfortunate vintage. An aggressive taste, with lingering notes of vinegar. It was very rough on the palate. Better luck next time. SS.<i></i></i>
</p>
<p>

    <i>He sent the note off with his owl, then retired to his chamber where he immediately opened one of his own wines and filled the largest goblet he could. Tomorrow he would talk to Albus and move forward with plans for the school, Severus promised himself. Tomorrow he would report back to the Dark Lord on the status of the school, he sternly ordered himself. But tonight he was going to drink two bottles of wine and pass out.</i>
