    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>A rather frail, black haired woman sat behind her thick wooden desk, thin, pale hands firmly clenched around a copy of the Daily Prophet. Her darkened steely grey eyes narrowed in suspicion and anger as they easily glided over the script finely printed over the parchment. She slammed the paper against the desk, unwilling to peruse the rest of the article as she already knew what it would say. Her breath came in deep gulps as she couldn’t look away from her brother’s enraged face on the front page of the paper. The screaming features that looked so much like her own were burned into her vision, and she couldn't shake the terrible memories from her mind. It had been twelve long years since she’d last seen the man. “Son of a bitch!” she yelled into the nothingness of her office. Memories welled up inside her, and she spared a single glance at the old, faded photograph on the desk that boasted the smiling faces of five teenagers. Her young, smiling features gazed back at her, surrounded by none other than Sirius, James, Lily, and Remus. The woman stood abruptly, her chair screeching across the pale wooden floor. Taking a deep, steadying breath, the woman stormed away from her desk, not taking a second glance back at the photo or the Prophet. She needed to speak with Dumbledore right away.</p>
<p>The woman trudged her way to the door, knocking over anything in her path. In her wake, she left papers scattered, textbooks upended, and now, the small table that sat by her door was sailing across the room. With a frustrated growl, she grasped the door handle and swung it open, not caring that it further damaged whatever belongings were scattered across the floor in its path. In her fury, she hadn’t noticed the pair of professors standing outside her office and almost slammed straight into the emotionless face of Minerva McGonagall. </p>
<p>Reeling backward, the younger woman placed an emotionless mask across her features and apologized to McGonagall. “I’m sorry Minerva. I didn’t see you there. Can whatever you need wait? I need to go speak with Dumbledore as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>There was a flash of pity that was in Minerva’s eyes for only a moment before she composed herself. “It’s fine, Amaris. Actually, I assume you’ve seen the most recent edition of the Daily Prophet. You’re going to need to come with us.” Amaris’ eyes flashed over to where she finally noticed Severus was standing slightly behind Minerva, wand at the ready. </p>
<p>Amaris narrowed her eyes at the two of them, her hand stealthily moving to hover over her own wand stashed carefully in her robes. “What’s going on here? I’m not going anywhere until I’m told exactly what’s happening.” Her steely gaze flashed to Snape. She flashed him a harsh glare that he’d grown so accustomed to over their years together. “I’d suggest you lower your wand, <em>Snivellus</em>. Unless you'd like a repeat of fifth year.”</p>
<p>The dark-haired male just sneered at Amaris. “You’re in no position here to be making demands, Black.” Amaris’ hands clenched into fists at her sides, and she felt her nails biting into the flesh of her palms. The two Professors never got along considering Snape’s view of her presence during the Shrieking Shack incident. It didn’t help that she’d also aided Sirius and James in tormenting the man earlier in his life. Minerva took note of Amaris’ jaw working and decided to step in before the situation could travel any farther south than it already had. </p>
<p>Minerva held her hand out to Severus, nodding slightly at him, and begrudgingly, Snape lowered his wand. McGonagall turned back to face Amaris. “Dear, you’re not in any trouble. Dumbledore and some officials only have a few questions for you.” Minerva gestured for Amaris to follow her, and she didn’t wait as she began walking toward Dumbledore’s office. Taking a deep breath, Amaris trailed along behind Minerva and was sure she could feel the painful bite of Snape’s wand in the small of her back. </p>
<p>It was a long walk to reach the headmaster’s office, and it felt even longer than it ever had before as Snape kept continually applying more pressure on Amaris’ back with his wand. If she wasn’t already toeing the line, Amaris would’ve spun on her heel and disarmed the man in a heartbeat. Due to the current situation, she reasoned with herself that she should just put up with it now and make the man pay later. A long list of ways of torment began to scroll through Amaris' mind, and she couldn't wait to be able to put some of them to the test.</p>
<p>Before she could talk herself out of being rational, thankfully, they’d reached the headmaster's office, and Amaris was harshly shoved into the room by Snape. “Now, now Severus, there’s no need for such brutality,” Dumbledore’s voice rang throughout the room. Amaris swallowed hard as Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes settled on her. “Miss Black, I’m sorry we had to summon you in such a manner, but I have some men from the Ministry here that would like to ask you some questions.” Dumbledore gestured two the two short, stout men that stood beside his desk. </p>
<p>One of the men took a step forward and addressed Amaris, arrogance lacing his tone. “Well, Amaris Black, isn’t it great to be together like this again?”</p>
<p>Amaris folded her arms across her chest indignantly. She stared down her nose at the short, portly man shoved into a suit way too small for him. He hadn't changed much since she'd seen him last. “If you mean you throwing insulting questions at me and trying to weasel an invalid confession out of me once again, then of course it’s lovely to be in your presence twelve years down the line.” Occasionally , if the Toad was unable to make a session, the man standing before Amaris currently would fill in for her. It was a rare occasion, but Amaris remembered it clearly.</p>
<p>The indignant man took another step forward, jabbing a stubby finger toward Amaris. Good to see it was still just as easy to get under his skin and torment the man. “Now you listen here Black. I won’t be putting up with any of your shit this time. I’m gonna ask you questions, and you’re going to answer. No witty comments, no snide remarks. Got it?”</p>
<p>Rolling her eyes, Amaris held her hands up in what she hoped to be considered a peaceful gesture. “Of course, Rabin, fire away.” Amaris watched as the Ministry official behind Rabin pulled out a quill and a piece of parchment and prepared himself to begin taking notes on everything that was said between the two of them.</p>
<p>Rabin regained his composure and began his game of twenty questions. “So, you’ve heard the most recent news?”</p>
<p>Feigning innocence, Amaris placed a single finger to her lips and began tapping it lightly against them. A sly grin spread across her lips, and Amaris said, “Ah, yes, I did read earlier about the Appleby Arrows beating the Wimbourne Wasps in their most recent game. Quite the turnout I heard. Wish I could’ve been there to see it.” She shrugged easily, her voice wistful.</p>
<p>Rabin let out a sound that could only be interpreted as a growl, and his round face reddened in fury. “Thought we agreed on not playing games this time Black.”</p>
<p>Amaris held her slender finger between the two of them, a slight smirk donning her features. “Ah, but I merely agreed on answering your questions, and not making any snide remarks or witty comments if I do remember correctly. And for your information, Rabin, I did read about the turnout of that game. No lies here.”</p>
<p>“Your brother,” he ground out between clenched teeth. “Did you know about your brother escaping?”</p>
<p>The dark-haired woman willed her face to remain emotionless. Even though it happened so long ago, the wounds that were left from those days were still fresh. “Yes, I did read about that.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“And that’s all I know about it. He escaped, and he’s now on the run," Amaris said dismissively. "Am I supposed to know anything more about the situation here?”</p>
<p>Amaris heard someone shuffling around behind her, and she focused on Rabin’s partner scribbling away on his parchment. “He hasn’t contacted you?”</p>
<p>Amaris feigned surprise and disgust. “Merlin’s beard, no. What reason would he have to contact me? He knows his place in the family after he was disowned, let alone after what he did to my—our friends.” Amaris paused, twisting her face in anger easily, thinking of the months spent at the Ministry, and Peter's betrayal.</p>
<p>Rabin sneered at her. “If I recall correctly, you were disowned as well. The two misfits from the Black family. Two peas in a pod. And to top it all off, we both know you were there with him the night he was taken from the scene of his massacre. Still can't seem to figure out why though.”</p>
<p>Amaris took a deep breath to steady herself. Of course, the Ministry had been digging into her past for years. It seemed as though they were still trying to list her as Sirius' accomplice. “My disownment has nothing to do with the situation at hand, Rabin. As for my presence there, I was cleared of that months after the incident. The Ministry tried their best but couldn’t find any way to pin the murders on me as well. You should be well versed in that story by now.”</p>
<p>“A mistake on their part, I say. You’re just as guilty as he is Black.”</p>
<p>Amaris wasn't as hot-headed as she was when she was younger, but with everything going on, her emotions were all over the place. She grit her teeth, ready to give Rabin an earful. “You’re right Rabin because he didn’t commit those murders and neither did I. We’re both innocent. He was framed! If you fools would just listen rather than trying to save face all the time you would realize this!”</p>
<p>“Watch your tone with me Black, or I will have you escorted off the premises to be questioned properly once again.” There was a malicious glint to Rabin's dark chocolate eyes. He wished nothing more to get her behind closed doors with no witnesses. Rabin would have her confessing to whatever he pleased by the time he was done <em>questioning </em>her.</p>
<p>Amaris’ jaw set. “To be tortured you mean. Will I be getting to deal with you this time, or will I get to pay a visit to my old, dear <em>friend?</em>”</p>
<p>Before Rabin could spout off whatever insult he was about to sling at Amaris, Dumbledore finally cut in. “Mister Rabin, this conversation seems to have derailed from the original topic. Do you have any further questions for Miss Black about her brother’s disappearance?”</p>
<p>“Only one,” Rabin spat. “Do you consent to a search of your personal belongings?” He cut off the witty comment Amaris was about to spit at him. “It doesn’t matter if you do or not as we’ll return with the proper paperwork to do so anyway.”</p>
<p>Amaris folded her arms across her chest. “Fine, whatever.”</p>
<p>“If that is all, Minerva, Severus, would you show these two where Miss Black resides?” Dumbledore asked, silencing the entire room.</p>
<p>“With pleasure,” Snape drawled, all too happy to lead the officials straight to her quarters. Amaris could do nothing but watch as the two Ministry men shuffled out, following Minerva and Snape back to her room.</p>
<p>As soon as the door shut, she rounded on Dumbledore. Amaris was an absolute mess. “You don’t think I helped him, right?” she asked, her voice wavering with fear and disbelief. Dumbledore shook his head at her, and relief flooded her veins. “I swear I didn’t, but, sir, if I may speak my mind?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore made his way around his desk and sat in his chair. He folded his hands in front of him, eager to hear what Amaris had to say. “Of course.”</p>
<p>Amaris stood before the old wizard, opening her mouth and shutting it a few times as she tried to find the right words to say. “I didn’t help him escape, but I don’t want to see him sent back to Azkaban. He really didn’t do it. You know for a fact that I told the Ministry over and over again about what I saw—what I heard. None of them believed me. Nobody does. Sirius was yelling for Peter and calling him a traitor. And the bodies, he was shocked to see them all.” Amaris paused for a second, the images of all those dead muggles flashing before her eyes, along with Sirius' crazed, grief stricken expression. “As they took him away, the only thing he kept saying was they had the wrong guy. It was Pettigrew. Nobody would listen though; not to him nor me. Do you believe me?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore sighed. “I’m not sure what exactly to believe here Miss Black.”</p>
<p>Desperate, Amaris said the first thing that came to mind. “I can prove it. I’ll find Pettigrew and bring him to justice for his crimes. My brother would be free then, and the Potters would receive the closure they deserve. I just need some time.”</p>
<p>“You do understand what you’re asking of me, don't you?” Amaris bit her lip and nodded. “Very well. I won’t stop you. Should something happen, I won’t be able to protect you from the Ministry this time. Do you understand this?” Amaris solemnly nodded again. “As for your classes, I’m sure Hagrid will be happy to cover them for the time being. Don’t worry, I won’t say exactly what is going on. You’re simply doing me a favor and trying to lure your brother out of hiding for the Ministry.” Dumbledore gave her a sly wink. “Now, Miss Black, I’d suggest you be a sly fox and disappear.”</p>
<p>Grateful tears slipped down her cheeks as she thanked Dumbledore profusely. “I’ll send word if the Ministry is searching for you for whatever reason. Your secrets are safe with me dear.” With that, the headmaster dismissed her and happiness flooded through her for the first time in years. Someone gave her a chance. Someone was willing to listen to her. Now all she had to do was wait until Rabin and his partner were done raiding her belongings.</p>
<p>Amaris wandered the halls, fingers trailing along the cool stone. She needed to get back to her office, but she knew she would be walking straight into the middle of a shitstorm as the two officials, most likely along with Snape, destroyed her quarters. All too soon, she was standing in front of her office door that had been left ajar. Nudging it open with her foot, Amaris stepped in. Her jaw dropped at the sight. Papers were strewn across the floor, her shelves were empty, and her desk was now firmly planted against the far wall. The picture that had rested upon it for years was now shattered again the wood.</p>
<p>A low growl forming deep in her chest, she stormed across the mess, not caring what she stepped on and slammed her bedroom door open. “Find what you’re so desperately looking for yet?” she snarled at the men who were flinging her personal belongings around the room without a care in the world.</p>
<p>She stood in the doorway, shaking with anger. Amaris was absolutely seething and she almost slapped away the calming hand Minerva placed on her shoulder. “Amaris,” she whispered soothingly. “I will help you fix the mess as soon as they are gone.” The younger woman simply nodded, not once glancing at her peer.</p>
<p>Raban glanced up from one of her books that he was shaking violently to dislodge any hidden parchment that could’ve been inside. “Black. Where are you hiding them?”</p>
<p>“Hiding what?” she spat.</p>
<p>“Letters from him. I know you’re in contact with your brother, and it’s only a matter of time before I expose you.” Minerva physically held Amaris back from taking a swing at the official.</p>
<p>“Why not try between the mattresses? I find plenty of things hidden there in the student dorms,” Snape offered from where he sat in Amaris’ arm chair.</p>
<p>As Rabin lifted the top mattress and sent it crashing into the wall, he was crestfallen to find there was nothing there. “Severus, that is quite enough out of you,” Minerva said sternly. She turned to face the two men who were standing in the middle of the room, scanning the wreckage of Amaris’ belongings. “It seems as though you’ve searched everything and haven’t found a single lead. If that is all, I do believe you two should be on your way now.”</p>
<p>With a glare, Rabin and his partner made their way to exit the room. “Don’t worry Black, we’ll be back to search you again soon. That’s if we don’t catch anything before that. We’ve got our eye on you.” Smirking, Rabin shouldered his way past Amaris and out of her room. Her jaw clenched, and she turned to where Severus still sat in her chair.</p>
<p>If looks could kill, Severus would be six feet under many times over with the glare he was on the receiving end of. “Isn’t it about time you crawled back to the dungeons where you belong, snake?” she spat out between her teeth.</p>
<p>Without a word, Severus rose from the chair and swiftly made to exit after the officials. Before he did, he paused beside Amaris. “Don’t worry Black, I’m sure you’ll be easily replaced, and I’m positive Azkaban will treat you as well as it did your brother.”</p>
<p>Before Minerva caught on, Amaris leaned in close and whispered to him, “Watch your back Snivellus, or I promise you I’ll finish what my brother started back in school.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to see you try. Not as tough now that your little gang has been . . . disbanded.” Severus smirked and disappeared through the door. Amaris watched until she saw his billowing cloak vanish around the corner, and as soon as it was, she used her wand to slam the office door shut. Once it was just her and McGonagall, Amaris collapsed to the floor.</p>
<p>“I’m not him,” she muttered. “I’m not my brother. Why does everyone treat me as though I am?”</p>
<p>McGonagall lowered herself to kneel beside her fellow professor and placed a hand on her arm once again. “Dear, we know you aren’t him. Though you do have many similarities. I’m sure this will all be over soon, and things will return to how they were,” McGonagall said cryptically. “Now, let’s get on with fixing this wreck. The Ministry always seems to make a mess no matter what they’re doing.”</p>
<p>Weakly, Amaris lifted herself off the ground and began to magically clean her quarters with Minerva’s help. In no time, both rooms looked like they had before both Rabin and Amaris’ tantrums that day. With a smile, Minerva turned to bid Amaris a good night. “If you need anything at all dear, come find me. I do really mean <em>anything</em>.”</p>
<p>As Amaris stared back into Minerva’s twinkling eye, she felt as though she was about to burst. “Minerva, can I trust you with something?”</p>
<p>Minerva smiled widely. Nothing ever got past that woman. “Of course, Amaris. I’ve known you since you were eleven, and to be blunt, nothing you can say anymore will surprise me.”</p>
<p>Amaris quirked an eyebrow. “Even if I said I helped plot against the Potters?”</p>
<p>The older woman let out a small chuckle as she seemed to weigh the idea. “Okay, that might surprise me a little bit.”</p>
<p>Finally smiling, Amaris reassured her peer. “I didn’t, but I am trying to help Sirius. I didn’t help him escape, and I haven’t contacted him in anyway, but I’m trying to find the real monster. I know who hurt James and Lily, and I won’t rest until he’s put away and Sirius is back. I’ve already spoken with Dumbledore about it, and he’s willing to offer me some support. I was just wondering, if you could cover for me as well. Nothing major, just give everyone some generic excuse for my absence?”</p>
<p>“I think I may be able to do that. I’ll have a chat with Albus tomorrow about it all. Your secret is safe with me Amaris." Minerva gave the woman a warm, reassuring smile. "To be honest, I always thought your brother was a good kid. A little rowdy like the rest of you were, but he wouldn’t be capable of the things they pinned on him. I wish you well in your quest Amaris.” With that, Minerva left and Amaris was alone again. Exhausted, she locked her office door and headed into her bedroom. As soon as she was close enough, she fell into her bed and yanked the covers over her head. Before she knew it, she fell into a fitful sleep full of images of a certain shaggy black dog and a grey furred werewolf.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>The small red fox pranced about the school grounds as had become routine for her the last few weeks, trying to act as normal as possible. She didn’t want to raise suspicion about what was really going on. As far as she knew, only three people on the campus knew about her Animagus abilities and quest for Sirius, and she much preferred to keep it that way. The fox’s eyes scanned the ground, looking for any signs of the wanted man she was on patrol for. She leapt from log to log, chasing the occasional butterfly that crossed her path as the sun began to set. An oddly familiar howl caught her attention, and she paused her chase of a bright blue butterfly that happily flitted away from her previously snapping jaws. Her ears twitched as she tried to pinpoint the location it had come from. Glancing in the direction of the Forbidden Forest, Amaris let out an ear-splitting screech. Another howl sounded in response. She was sure it was coming from the forest now. </p>
<p>Amaris bolted for the forest as fast as her stubby fox legs would carry her. When she reached the tree-line, Amaris didn’t pause in her stride as she let out another series of yips and screeches. Yet again, a quieter howl sounded from deeper within the woods. She dashed in the direction of the sound and a few moments later, she let out a single quiet yip. Amaris yelped in surprise when a single, low woof sounded right behind her. She spun around to face the creature, and sure enough, she was staring into the yellow eyes of a giant, shaggy black dog. </p>
<p>Letting out a series of happy yips and yowls, the fox leaped at the dog, showering it with affectionate, playful nips. The dog simply nudged her away with its large head and shook out his coat. Moments later, Amaris was staring at the familiar form of her twin brother. Still in shock, she transformed back into her human self and threw herself at Sirius. Amaris wrapped her arms around her brother’s neck and buried her face against his neck. She couldn't believe she once again had the chance to hug her brother like this. “I’ve missed you so much Sirius,” she mumbled against his skin, happy tears spilling from her eyes. She then scrunched up her nose in disgust and stepped away from him. “You reek,” she stated blandly. </p>
<p>Sirius merely chuckled at her words and ruffled her hair lovingly. “Living on the run will do that to you. Plus, there’s not much care for hygiene in Azkaban.”</p>
<p>His sister laughed softly, then looked at him sadly. “I’m sorry Sirius. I haven’t been that good of a sister to you I guess, leaving you there to rot. I’ve been trying to clear your name though, I promise! I just . . . haven't been able to track down Peter yet.” </p>
<p>Amaris watched as her brother’s grey eyes darkened. “It’s fine, but Amaris, I think we may finally be able to clear my name.”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened. “What? How? You broke out of Azkaban! The only thing that awaits you now is <em>the kiss</em>.”</p>
<p>Sirius shushed his sister. “I know where he is Amaris. Pettigrew. He’s here. Well, not yet but he will be soon enough.” </p>
<p>Amaris’ voice caught in her throat as her eyes narrowed suspiciously. “No. There’s no way. I’ve been here since the incident. I would have known Sirius. I'll never forget that face, and as soon as I see him again . . .”</p>
<p>“You forget how sneaky that rat really is; he may have finally surpassed even you Vixen.” Sirius’ face twisted with rage and disgust. He began pacing slightly, unable to remain still as he explained everything to his sister. “I got a hold of a copy of the Prophet over the summer while I was in prison. He was on the front page. I know it was him. He’s posing as a pet rat in the Weasley family." Amaris' eyes went wide with shock when she heard the Weasley name. She'd become rather close to Ron over the years due to his relationship with Harry. "I just need your help getting into the castle and we can end this finally. We can be a family again Amaris.” Amaris’ heart leaped at the thought of having her brother back in her life, but that happiness was dulled slightly at the thought of what he was asking of her.</p>
<p>“No, Sirius, I can’t do that. Please. This place is going to be crawling with dementors and students that know your face tomorrow. You can’t risk it. Let me do this. I will find him and we’ll set this right.” Amaris chewed her bottom lip nervously. “I don’t think Peter knows I’ve been onto him since the day it happened. I promise, I’ll get him to you. Just give me some time." Amaris placed a hand on Sirius' shoulder, finally halting his incessant pacing. What she wouldn't give to have him back in her life permanently. "Hagrid is covering my classes for a little while, so that gives me time to bring him out of hiding. Just be patient for me? Hide out in here, and I’ll give you the signal when I’ve come with news. Some of the staff and Ministry are onto me. They think I helped you escape so I’m under a bit of surveillance right now. We have to be careful. Speaking of, I should probably get back to the castle. I won’t let you down Sirius. Just stay away from the castle for now, for me.”</p>
<p>Defeated, Sirius begrudgingly agreed with his sister. “I’ll do my best to be patient, but you know how I get Vix.” He shrugged at his sister’s pointed glare. Shaking her head, she gave her brother one last bone-crushing hug before she turned to leave the clearing. “Amaris, wait, before you go, Hagrid is covering your classes? Does that mean you’re a professor here?”</p>
<p>Grinning, Amaris filled her brother in. “After you were arrested and I was held at the ministry, Dumbledore took me under his wing. He told me Professor Kettleburn was wanting to go study out in the field before he got too old, and he needed a replacement. Considering my excellent grades in the class, he made me the new professor. Been here ever since.”</p>
<p>In a flash, Sirius gathered his smaller sister into a bear hug. “I’m so proud of you Vix. I knew you had it in you to do great things.” He released her, almost unwillingly. “Now go on. I’ll see you soon.”</p>
<p>“Don’t get yourself caught,” Amaris called behind her as she disappeared into the brush leaving her brother standing alone in the forest.</p>
