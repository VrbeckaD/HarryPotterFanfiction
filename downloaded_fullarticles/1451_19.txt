  <span>Chapter 1</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The dark forest seemed bleak. A lonely place to find yourself as you walk to your death. Harry walked slowly feeling scared but confident, as he knew, he always had his parents, his godfather, and both his and their friends with him. The resurrection stone was true to its word. He was ready to lay down his life if it saved his best friends and the rest of Hogwarts.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>As he rounded the corner, he stepped on a twig and it snapped, he then heard voices.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span> </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Harry Potter. Come to die.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span> </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Voldemort was seated at the far end, and around him stood ten or so Death eaters and Hagrid with five wands pointed directly at him. “Harry, NO … RUN.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Harry looked over at Voldemort and stared directly into his eyes and spoke, “Voldemort, I am ready to die. As long as it stops you destroying Hogwarts and killing my friends. Let’s get it over with.” This last sentence was spoken so confidently, that Harry barely recognised his voice.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Voldemort stood up. he took out the Elder wand and aimed it at Harry.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span> </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Goodbye Harry Potter. Avada kedavra.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span> </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The green light emitted from Voldemort’s wand and hit Harry square in the chest. He didn’t even remember hitting the ground. He was already dead.</span>
  </em>

</p><p>
  <span>Seven years earlier… Same month. (June)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry Potter awoke. His eyes felt groggy, as if he was looking through thick fog, the environment around him looked cloudlike, his senses robbed of him, he could not remember what happened the previous night. Harry blinked the sleep from his eyes, before rubbing. Sitting up helped his senses slowly return to him, and he felt a soft mattress underneath him, and a doona on top of his lower body. As his eyes began to focus more and more, he could check on his surroundings: he realised he was in a bedroom, but not the one he had ever been in before. He noticed a chest of drawers, desk and chair and a window to his left. Posters of famous Quidditch players lined the walls. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>‘Where am I? How did I get here?’ Were the questions that were flying through Harry’s mind at the present moment. He was trying to remember the previous night but that was rapidly fading from his memory. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>“Voldemort; Death Eaters; The battle of Hogwarts; Dark Forest; Sacrifice; Death” </b>
</p><p>
  <b>“</b>
  <span>Death” that was the big one. He remembered Voldemort killing him, he had felt his life force and soul leave his body. So, why had he ended up here? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s mind and heart were racing. He needed to find answers and fast. So he looked around for a mirror to confirm who he was. He spotted a small hand mirror on the chest of drawers directly in front of him. He swung his legs over the side of the bed, and picked up his glasses from the bedside table where he must have left the night before, though he didn’t remember doing that and walked slowly over to grab the mirror with his right hand, bringing it up to his face, he gasped. His reflection in this hand mirror did not reflect what he believed he would see. Then he looked closer. He did recognise the face staring back at him, it was his 10 year old self, minus the lightning bolt scar on his forehead. ‘What has happened? Where’s the scar that makes his famous?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>HE SCREAMED.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The high-pitched scream was probably loud enough to wake the neighbours had they been asleep but it was 10am. What it did do though, was cause a middle-aged woman with messy red hair and emerald green eyes, similar to Harry’s, to crash open the door, 2 minutes later.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry sweetie, are you ok? Did you have that nightmare again?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s mind was in overdrive, not only was he now ten years old, had no lightning bolt scar on his forehead, but standing in front of him was his mother, alive and well. He realised he was a seventeen year old mind in the body of a ten year old.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn't know what had happened, but he didn't want anyone to think he was not okay, till he knew what was going on. Or whether how long he would remember his previous life. So he pretended to be a scared kid who had just woken from a nightmare. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I was in a dark forest and all the baddies were closing in around me. Then I pinched myself and woke up.” Harry chuckled to himself, it was a convincing lie.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily open her arms and beckoned her son into a hug. Harry felt his head gently touch her chest. He felt at home, he had never really felt like this before. His parents having died when he was one year old in the previous life. Tears swelled up in Harry’s eyes. He was where he had always wanted to be, in his mother’s arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After what seemed like ages, they disengaged the hug. Harry knew he had been crying but Lily also noticed. “Harry, sweetheart, it was just a dream. No need to panic. I am always here for you, my love will always surround and protect you from harm and I will always love you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded. That love had gotten Harry through some tricky and dangerous moments before. But that was in his other life, which it seemed destined never happen now. He would have to redo all seven years of Hogwarts. Would his friends still be his friends, even if he wasn’t the boy who lived? However, if he wasn’t the boy who lived, then who was, was Voldemort still alive?</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily looked down at her son. “Why not come down to breakfast. After a nightmare you always need food. Your father should be arriving home any minute. The life of an Auror eh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
  <span>Harry smiled. Both his parents were alive and well.</span>
