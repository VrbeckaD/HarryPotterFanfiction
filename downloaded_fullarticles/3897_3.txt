    <p>Harry, Ron and Hermione were currently sitting by the black lake wondering if the Ministry had finally set Sirius free, now that Voldemort had been defeated for good. Harry had found Ron and Hermione’s antics to be annoying, she wanted to ask Harry something about Sirius and Ron tried to stop her but most of all he had hoped that they would soon get together for his own piece of mind.</p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>He sighed and left them bickering by the lake when Sirius, Remus and the new minister arrived followed by other parents and citizens.  Harry smirked before he was bowled over by a black shaggy dog, who was keen on licking him to death.<br/>
'Padfoot stop it.' Harry chuckled.<br/>
'Come on Sirius, let prongslet get up?' Remus chuckled.<br/>
'spoil sport.' Sirius grumbled as he transformed back.</p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>'You’re free right? For good?' Harry asked.<br/>
'Yes, I even got sole custody of my little pup, much to Dumbledore’s fury.' Sirius added.<br/>
'I don’t see why it’s his business where I live? Or what I do?' Harry replied angrily.<br/>
'Neither do we, so when it’s the holidays we are going to check your accounts… have you got the most recent report from them?'</p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>'To come to think of I have received any at all, as far as I know I only have the one I have been using.' Harry replied, noticing the looks of anger on their faces.<br/>
'I think we need to do it as soon as possible.'  Sirius replied.</p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>'ALL 5TH 6TH AND 7TH YEAR STUDENTS ARE TO REPORT TO THE GREAT HALL IMMEDIATELY, ALL OTHER STUDENTS ARE TO HEAD TO THEIR HOUSE DORMINTORY AND REMAIN THEIR UNTIL GIVEN THE ALL CLEAR BY YOUR HEAD OF HOUSE.' Dumbledore voice boomed.</p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>'What is going on?' Harry questioned.<br/>
'The ministry has passed a marriage law, and the Minister here is going to explain it and hand out you assigned partners.' Sirius replied sadly.</p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>'You mean someone has to marry the mutt here, Moony?' Harry smirked.<br/>
'Yes prongslet.' Remus smiled at the shot Harry had just gotten in.<br/>
'Oi!'  Sirius shouted while Remus laughed.<br/>
Entering the hall with Sirius and Remus behind him he saw Neville and the others sitting at the Gryffindor table talking about their upcoming holidays. When Dumbledore gathered their attention and introduced them to the new Minister for Magic, Amelia Bones.</p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>'Thank you Headmaster. This morning you all would have read in the newspaper about the marriage law being passed and that you would receive the notifications today. First I want to explain why this new marriage law was passed... It was passed to increase the population, strengthen the magical community and to unite those of light, grey and dark families. Now I wish to explain what this law requires of all of you. One you must marry by the 1st of September, two you must at least conceive your first child within thirteen months of marriage and have a total of three pregnancies within 7 years of marriage, so if you have twin that is only 1 pregnancy. On another note, you are not to turn to Mr Potter to get him to overturn the law or change the person you have been assigned to. He is in the same boat as all of you!' she paused, seeing them all nod.</p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>'We have done our best to match you to your correct orientation, if we have made a mistake I apologise and we will change it. If you fail to marry by the first then you will lose your magic and memories of our world and forced to live in the muggle world.' She added.<br/>
'You must settle on a date, best man, maid of honour and time and where and we will make sure a minister is there to marry you.' She continued.</p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>Harry became nervous and looked at the others around him who were just as nervous as him, some were paler then normal and Ron was almost green. He noticed that their head of house had a pile of letters and headed their way. Harry chuckled when she saw her starting with the seventh years while the rest groaned. She paused in front of Harry and gave him his letter and gave a rare smile before moving on.<br/>
He smiled and slowly opened the letter and read:</p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <b><i>Dear Mr H Potter-Black,</i></b><br/></p><p>
  <br/>
  <b>
    <i>We wish to inform you that your ministry assigned partner is Severus Snape, Potions Master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. You and your husband to be are expected to marry by the first September, have or conceive your first child within fifteen months and have a minimum of three children within 6 years of marriage. Any failure at any point of this marriage law will result in both of you losing your memories and magic.</i>
  </b>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <b>
    <i>Best of Luck</i>
  </b>
  <br/>
</p><p><br/><b><i>Lady Amelia Susan Bones</i></b><br/><b><i>Minister for Magic</i></b>
</p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>He gulped and looked at Professor Snape who was glaring at him in return… this can’t be good he thought.<br/>
'Harry, who are you partnered with?' Hermione asked.<br/>
'I tell you if you tell me first?' Harry replied looking for Sirius.<br/>
'Fred Weasley.'<br/></p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>'Professor Snape.' Harry muttered as Sirius tapped him on the shoulder.<br/>
'He won’t hurt you Harry,' she replied softly.<br/>
'We’ll see. Hey Padfoot.'<br/></p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>'Harry, I want to ask you if you will be my best man when I marry Amelia Bones?'<br/>
'Of course I will papa!' Harry replied as he hugged his adopted father.<br/>
'Harry, who you have been assigned?' he asked.<br/>
'Professor Snape, Siri do you hate me?'<br/></p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>'Harry why would I hate you son, I don’t care if you are gay as long as you are happy that is all that matters and I will try my absolute best to be civil for you.' Sirius replied hugging his son, as Severus stood by watching.<br/>
'Po- Harry we need to talk, have you asked someone to be your best man yet?' Severus questioned with a slight sneer upon his face.<br/></p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>'Not yet, give me a second?' Harry replied earning a nod in return.<br/>
'Neville, can I ask you something?'<br/>
'Sure if I can ask you something in return?'<br/></p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>'Will you be my best man?' Harry asked.<br/>
'I would be honoured. Would you be mine?' Neville asked.<br/>
'I would love to be your best man.' Harry replied before walking back to Severus.</p>
