    <p>« Minister! Minister, can i get a picture? »<br/>Y/N heard immediate shouts as she took a step in the cobbled alleyway. Flashing a smile to the cameras, she carried along the streets of Diagon Alley with her group of Auror bodyguards following close behind.<br/>“So, where’s the shop you said sold Shield Hats?”Y/N asked.<br/>“The big flashy purple and orange one, right there.”<br/>Y/N’s eyes followed her associate’s pointing finger, looking up to a bedazzled colorful building called “Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes”.<br/>The first word of the name rang a bell in the back of Y/N’s memory. An alarming bell. She squashed the feeling down and moved on.<br/>Fred jumped merrily from customer to customer. He then went back to the cash register, when a large portion of the crowd left, leaving the store almost empty.<br/>Y/N grasped the golden orange doorknob, pulling it; not showing any emotion.<br/>Counting the Galleons, Fred’s gaze was on the counter in front of him. The little bell on the door gave a tinkle, as someone opened the door. <br/>Y/N stepped in, her head turning to look around before stopping at the cash register.<br/>Hearing the sound, Fred looked up, expecting just another customer. <br/>Their eyes met, and the room filled with tension and emotion.<br/>*<br/>“What? No, he definitely does not like me!” Young Y/N squealed at her friend.<br/>“I SWEAR, George told me!”<br/>The color rose in Y/N’s cheeks as she tried to contain her wide smile, but failed.<br/>+<br/>“Wow, you look amazing.” Fred gushed, ears turning red at the sight of Y/N in her dress.<br/>“You look quite dashing yourself.” Y/N giggled before taking his arm as they walked into the Great Hall, along with the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students.<br/>+<br/>Y/N’s hand laid innocently on her lap as she and Fred sat outside on the ground, watching the Giant Squid float lazily on the smooth surface of the lake.<br/>Fred glanced down, before looking back in front of him. His hand slowly precariously slid down onto his own lap, inches away from hers.<br/>This didn’t go unnoticed by Y/N. She looked down before grinning and looking back in front as well.<br/>Their fingers crawled subtly towards each other before entering in contact and lacing together.<br/>Y/N smiled down at their hands, before looking sideways at Fred. He did the same, and looked back at her. His eyes went down to her lips, and his own joined hers.<br/>+<br/>“I swear to God Fred if you push me-“<br/>Fred picked Y/N up by the waist and leapt into the lake with her still in his arms. Y/N mounted to the surface of the water, sputtering and coughing.<br/>“God, you little-“<br/>But Fred interrupted her probably inappropriate words by planting his wet lips on hers.<br/>“Get a freaking room!” George bellowed a few meters away, interrupting his water fight with Ginny.<br/>+<br/>Tears streamed down Y/N’s face as she sat on the ground of the common room.<br/>“Y/N, guess who Harry saw attacking Krum- are you okay?” Alarm took over Fred’s face as he immediately sat down beside his girlfriend, wrapping an arm around her.<br/>She rested her head on his shoulder, her tears wetting his collar.<br/>“Fucking failed my fucking potions exam.”<br/>“So what shall it be, poising Snape in his sleep or set a Hippogriff on him during one of his walks outside?”<br/>Y/N laughed through her crying, punching Fred on the arm.<br/>“Please don’t do either, you’ll get expelled.”<br/>“I’d get expelled for you.” Fred said, shrugging as if being expelled wasn’t a big deal.<br/>+<br/>“Y/N, are you sure this is a good idea? I mean he would get REALLY upset if he saw you kissing me.”<br/>“That’s the point! Fred’s always pulling pranks on me, what better way than getting him back by mistaking his twin for him?” You chuckled at George.<br/>“Ookay, but this is gonna be very uncomfortable.”<br/>“Same for me, but hey do it for the prank right?”<br/>“Yep, that’s the motto.”<br/>“Hey Y/N!” Fred waved as he climbed through the portrait hole.<br/>“Oh hey George!” Y/N waved innocently at Fred.<br/>His eyebrows raise up but before he opens his mouth to say something, Y/N continues;<br/>“Have you seen Fred?”<br/>“Looking for me, darling?” comes George’s voice.<br/>“Oh there you are Freddie.” Y/N exclaims, fighting the laughter coming up her throat.<br/>She goes to hug George, before taking a deep breath and kissing him.<br/>“OI!”<br/>+<br/>“You swear it was a prank?” Fred asked sadly, hugging his knees.<br/>“I swear on Merlin’s pants. God, I’m so sorry, I didn’t know it would get you this upset.”<br/>“I just don’t want to lose you.”<br/>“You won’t Fred. Never.”<br/>+<br/>“And then you just eat the purple end, and you stop throwing up!” Fred says excitedly to Y/N and George.<br/>“And they’ll be called Skiving Snackboxes.” George adds on.<br/>“Wow, that’s very ambitious.” Y/N says. “And um, this shop you will open, it’ll be just like Zonko’s?”<br/>“Yep. Better.”<br/>“Well, that’s a lot of work for you guys to do then.”<br/>“Yep.”<br/>+<br/>“This is so stupid! Fudge is clearly fucking ignoring the whole situation.” Y/N huffs in frustration, circling around the bed.<br/>“Yes, I know darling, but what can you do?” Fred asked, lying down on the bed and staring up at her.<br/>“I’m gonna change it. I’m gonna be Minister for Magic.”<br/>+<br/>“Hey Fred, you coming to bed?” Y/N asked, in her pyjamas and planting a kiss on Fred’s shoulder.<br/>“Mhm yeah.” He said, focused on the Doxy poison potion he was working on with George.<br/>“Ookay.”<br/>And Y/N laid on his dorm bed all night, Fred only coming up when she was fast asleep.<br/>+<br/>“Hello darling.” Fred took a seat down beside Y/N in the library. He started planting soft kisses up and down her neck.<br/>“Sorry Fred, I really have to concentrate. I gotta get full marks on my N.E.W.T.S if I wanna get into the Ministry.”<br/>+<br/>Y/N walked in the common room around midnight to see Fred and George nibbling bits off red colored candies and then wiping the blood off their noses.<br/>She closed her eyes, before walking straight to her dorm.<br/>+<br/>Fred collected the Galleons the first-years handed him and gave them two boxes of Fainting Fancies. He walked down the hall, his pocket jiggling with noise from all the gold in it. He passed by the library, spotting Y/N hunched over a pile of books once again. He swallowed and carried on.<br/>+<br/>“Well I have ambitions too!” Y/N screamed back at Fred.<br/>“Yes, but I’m doing so well on the shop and the joke items, I might as well get started on the business right away! George and I are wasting away in this prison of a school!”<br/>“So, you would leave me to continue your dream?” Y/N said softly.<br/>“I-I, that’s not what I meant.”<br/>“I think it is.”<br/>“Well yeah we would leave, but it’ll only be half a year before you graduate and could see me again.”<br/>“Look Fred, it’s almost 9 I got my exam coming up.”<br/>“I’ll walk you.” <br/>They sat down on the chairs outside the classroom, waiting for Y/N’s turn.<br/>“Y/L/N? The Transfiguration and Charms teachers will see you now.”<br/>Y/N took a deep breath, before nodding at Fred and going in.”<br/>+<br/>“So, when do test results come?”<br/>“Next week.” Y/N responded to Fred.<br/>They gazed out into the lake, the Giant Squid floating along lazily again.<br/>“What’s happening Fred?”<br/>“I don’t know. I think our dreams are driving us apart.”<br/>Y/N turned her head, looking at Fred sadly.<br/>“What’s going to happen?”<br/>“I’ll ditch school with George, and you’ll finish your education. And then, there might be a war, I’m not too sure.”<br/>“I guess time will only tell about us, eh?” Y/N sniffed.<br/>“I’ll always love you Y/N.”<br/>“I will too Fred.”<br/>*<br/>Fred cleared his throat, snapping them both out of their sort of trance as they both replayed the same memories inside their heads.<br/>“Alright Freddie, I got the huge order for the Ministry!” A female voice came from the back of the store.<br/>Angelina Johnson walked in, placing a large box on the counter and giving Fred a kiss on the cheek.<br/>Y/N looked down.<br/>The group of Aurors hurried to the counter and picked up the parcels. They signed the order form and walked back to Y/N’s side.<br/>“12 dozen Shield Hats, Gloves and Scarves Minister.”<br/>Y/N nodded. She turned on her heel, following the Aurors making their way out of the store.<br/>Placing her hand on the doorknob and her wedding ring glimmering in the sunlight, she paused and turned her head back.<br/>She made eye contact with Fred.<br/>She smiled, and he did back. <br/>And she walked out.</p>
