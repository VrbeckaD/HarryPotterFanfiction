    <p>First Glance</p><p>Every day is the same. He has his routine. Get up, exercise, shower, get dressed, and then drive to his favourite coffee shop. Although the shop is no nonsense and is incredibly efficient , despite the name - The Fluffy Ginger Cat and also the fact that the  so called “fluffy cat “ was a monster that always hissed at him every time he passed by his permanent place by the large double doors- the lines were not that long, and the coffee was a little above decent. Some may say that he has an extremely expensive taste in coffee , but he doesn't care, that is one of the things that comes with being the heir to the Malfoy empire.</p><p>	It was exactly 07:45 in the morning when he walked in the coffee shop and got into line, to wait for his turn to order. Although he came here everyday for the past 2 years, so the owner, a bushy haired woman with a death stare to make even the strongest of beings cower in fear, already knew his order by heart, he still liked to wait in line; despite Granger saing a couple dozen times it was unnecessary.</p><p>Let me guess? A double espresso, no foam, no milk, 1 sugar, and double whipped cream?- she said with a smug “know-it-all” grin on her face. He hated that look. </p><p>Well Granger. Seeing as i come here everyday for the past 2 years and order the same thing on the specific days of the week , i would assume you’ve passed the guessing period of this transaction. - he answered with a sarcastic tone to his voice. This had become their routine since the second month he started frequenting the coffee shop.</p><p>	The people that knew him would venture to say that he was the most organised person that they had ever  met, but his best friends knew that draco couldn't organise anything to save his life. But he liked to have a routine, the one thing he hated the most was unpredictable things.</p><p>No need for sarcasm Mr. Malfoy, just checking. Ginny! The tuesday usual for Mr. Malfoy.</p><p>Already here! A double espresso, no foam, no milk, 1 sugar, and double whipped cream for Draco Malfoy.- Ginny said, with a polite smile plastered on her face. </p><p>Ginevra Weasley was part of the Weasley family. The Malfoys and the weasleys didn't get along at all ever since Draco could remember. It was an old school rivalry that started with their great grandfather, and has prevailed ever since. No one really knows what happened, but they maintain that the weasleys started it.</p><p>Thank you very much miss Weasley. - Draco said with cool politeness that the Malfoys were known for.</p><p>	 Just as he was about to head out the door at precisely 8 o'clock, there was  screams and smoke coming out from the kitchens. He thought best to leave it to the owner and crew and left for his long day at work.</p><p> </p><p>	At 07:44 on wednesday morning Draco was standing at the door to the Fluffy Ginger Cat reading the notice.</p><p>Closed until further notice for repairment? Are you kidding me?- His day was just ruined.</p><p>Relax draco is just for a couple of weeks! And then you can come back to pester me every day ok?</p><p>Where am i supposed to find a nice enough coffee shop at last moments notice to get my wednesday coffee?- he drawled with a side of annoyance - why do bad things happen to great people?</p><p>You think im great?- Hermione gasped shocked at hearing that coming from the man.</p><p>What ? wha- No! Im talking about me! </p><p>Oh, ok yeah that sounds more like you! look . I'm going to send you to my friends Bakery and I'll text him your order so that you can just come in and get your coffee and go to work! Ok? Is that good for you?</p><p>fine . just give me the address. I hope that friend of yours is any good at making a decent frappuccino.</p><p>He's great; here, just go two streets over and then go left. It's called the golden snitch. You'll want to ask for Harry.-Hermione said whilst texting this Harry person- I've sent the text  he’ll be  waiting for you, just go directly to the counter.</p><p> </p><p>	Apparently this harry person was the kind of person who thought that smiling at 07:56 in the morning was ok. And it wasn't a polite smile that you would give to a customer nor was it  a warmer good to see you again “ smile that one would give to a regular customer. No. this git had the biggest and warmest smile Draco had ever seen. The closer he got to the counter the more it seem that this “Harry“ person was emitting a warm wave of happiness. </p><p> </p><p>By the gods Draco hated him already.</p>
