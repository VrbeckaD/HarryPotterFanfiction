    <p>It was windy out, and snow fell gently. Sound all around seemed to be muffled.</p>
<p>A small child of maybe eight was panting, unheard by most, fist clutching their side. Blood was slowly welling up and falling through his frail fingers and into the snow below. Slush melted on his skin, tattered pants doing little to keep him dry- and no shoes to speak of.</p>
<p>He was limping hard, right leg mangled and pouring blood. His steps were shaky and uncoordinated at best, and tears were constantly welling up in his eyes.</p>
<p>Blood trickled town his head as well, and he could feel the rivulets on his back slowly thickening.</p>
<p>He whimpered, just making it to the back of the park, before falling onto the open flesh of his knee. He cried out, quickly stifling himself with his other hand, and curled up. Letting out an exhale, he rolled onto his back. </p>
<p>The snow felt almost nice on the gashes and welts littering him, but the pressure took most of it away.</p>
<p>He pulled his hand away from his side, lack of pressure causing more blood to flow out. He could see the black aura steam off the liquid and into the air. His blood-covered hand pulsed with the noxious color- so different than the colorful variety most humans had. </p>
<p>He had seen blues, pinks, and beautiful greens depending on the person. Rooms full of people burst with color- but he had none. Not even the white glow that a few people had.</p>
<p>It was an empty, light sucking black.</p>
<p>He hated it.</p>
<p>And he hated that no one else could see the colors like he did.</p>
<p>The snow around him slowly turned to slush the longer he lied there. Anywhere blood flowed turned faster, warm liquid prompting its melt.</p>
<p>He scratched at his face, spreading the blood already there, and tears welled up in his eyes as he stared at the night sky. </p>
<p>Long black hair framed the quickly paling face and fell out behind him, shining with damp snow, small flakes falling and speckling it.</p>
<p>He let out a choked sob, hand still placed over his mouth and face. </p>
<p>He couldn’t make a sound.</p>
<p>He couldn’t be found.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to be dragged back to the house by his uncle and and hung by his wrists. He didn’t want to hear more whip cracks, he didn’t want to see the glint of a knife buried near hilt-deep in his stomach, his side, and his leg.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to die.</p>
<p>He heard muffled speaking in the distance, and sat up quickly, giving a small yelp at the pain and blood that followed.</p>
<p>He drug himself behind the slide, uncaring of the bloody smears he left.</p>
<p>Their footsteps trailed to a different part of the park, and he was about to try and get away when a dog peered under the slide, and stared right at him.</p>
<p>No, scratch that. Whatever it was, it wasn’t a dog.</p>
<p>The bright red glow proved that highly- only foxes and people can have that color, and they couldn’t be a person.</p>
<p>So, fox.</p>
<p>At this point, blood loss started getting to the boy, and his decision making wasn’t the best.</p>
<p>“You’re… a pretty fox. What’s your... name?”</p>
<p>The dog-fox-creature blinked. </p>
<p>“How do you-” His -going by the voice- muzzle clenched shut. He had spoken unthinkingly.</p>
<p>The boy only looked down blearily, and the fox? dog sighed. “Im… Mystery. My name.” He added the end quickly at the boys starting confusion.</p>
<p>He just nodded his head. “Oh. Well, my name’s- well… um…” He took a moment to think.</p>
<p> “I- Harry? I think…?”</p>
<p>The fox nodded. “Don’t tell anyone else I can talk, alright?”</p>
<p>Harry nodded slowly, and the dog turned from under the slide and started barking. Loudly.</p>
<p>Harry flinched. “W-wait! Mystery- don’t”</p>
<p>But he heard someone running towards his spot, and clamped his mouth shut.</p>
<p>He was getting pretty dizzy, anyway.</p>
<p>He saw a brightly glowing figure as he drifted into unconsciousness- goldenrod and warm as the sun.</p>
<p>……….</p>
<p>Arthur was having a rough day. He had flown to Britain because of a friend of Lance’s dying- he attended their funeral a few days ago. Lance had decided to stay for a little while, leaving Arthur stuck with him, more or less.</p>
<p>Vivi had insisted someone go with him, but she and Lewis were tied up. Now that Lewis had come back… well, they’ve been dealing with a few things- and after the truth had come out, what had happened, it was a little tense between the three.</p>
<p>Well, tense between Arthur and the two of them at least.</p>
<p>Vivi had her memories back, and she and Lewis got back together. Lewis, however, still held a grudge against him- and Arthur really didn’t blame him.</p>
<p>He had stolen Lewis’s life from under his feet, even if he hadn’t been in control.</p>
<p>It was his fault things were so messed up.</p>
<p>Lewis couldn’t go back home, and Vivi was stressing about that secret coming out.</p>
<p>It was all his fault.</p>
<p>Still, Vivi insisted someone go with him. So, she sent Mystery.</p>
<p>Arthur had long since fixed the strained relationship between them when he had found out that he had torn his arm off. In fact, when all of them were together, he spent the most time with Mystery. Vivi was wrapped up in doing the stuff she and Lewis missed, and Lewis…</p>
<p>It was better he didn’t try and hang out with Lewis…</p>
<p>So yeah. He was having a rough day. Rough past three months, really.</p>
<p>He twirled the swiss army knife in his pocket wistfully. He hadn’t meant to go back on that particular habit, but…</p>
<p>With everything he put his friends through, he felt he deserved it. </p>
<p>Sometimes, it was dutiful punishment. </p>
<p>The other times though, it was simply because it stopped everything else.</p>
<p>His mind wouldn’t wander when he did… it. He would solely focus on the blade slicing through skin, and the red beads that would bubble up.</p>
<p>His arm was clean. They had to be in Texas weather. </p>
<p>His legs though, along with his sides, were always sporting harsh, red lines somewhere. </p>
<p>He sighed, and pulled his hand out of his pocket, rubbing his face tiredly. </p>
<p>He left the knife in his pocket.</p>
<p>Arthur stretched, getting up from the floor he had previously been lying on, and shrugging on his vest. He need to clear his mind, and a walk to the park would do just that.</p>
<p>Moments from the door, he heard a short whine.</p>
<p>Mystery.</p>
<p>“Where are you going? It’s really late,” he asked quietly.</p>
<p>“I…” Arthur sighed, “I need a walk. To clear my head.”</p>
<p>Mystery hummed. “I’ll come with you then. Vivi told me to keep an eye on you.”</p>
<p>“Wh- it’s not like someone is gonna come up and mugg me!”</p>
<p>“It’s not other people i’m worried about. It’s what you might do to yourself.” </p>
<p>Mystery looked pointedly at the pocket that held the knife.</p>
<p>Arthur winced. “Fine. Come on.”</p>
<p>Mystery made a noise of content as he followed Arthur out of the motel room and into the night. They were going to walk to the park- one nearby.</p>
<p>No tall buildings, no high trees, no large bodies of water.</p>
<p>No busy highways.</p>
<p>Nothing to give Arthur a chance.</p>
<p>When they arrived, Arthur sat down on a bench and turned to Mystery.</p>
<p>“What… what do you think I should do?”</p>
<p>The silence stretched in the cold night air, snow floating gently between the two.</p>
<p>Mystery cocked his head, “I’m afraid I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>“I…” Arthur trailed off, clenching his hands together. The bite of the metal in his hand grounded him. “Vivi and Lewis are together again. It’s perfect, but… I know it’s selfish, but after what happened, there seems to be even less room for…” he sighed, “...me.”</p>
<p>Mystery set his head on Arthur's knee, looking up questioningly.</p>
<p>“It’s just, I want them to be happy. But for them to be happy, I have to… leave. I know after what I did, Lewis doesn’t… trust me anymore. I doubt he likes me much anymore, and I don’t blame him. I took… everything from him.” Arthur wiped tears away hastily. In this weather, he didn’t want them to freeze onto his face.</p>
<p>“Vivi… I just get in between her and Lewis- it’s obvious. Lewis spends so much time making sure I don’t… pull anything… and Vivi always gets caught in between. I- I can’t do that to her anymore…”</p>
<p>Mystery sighed, letting out a hum. “What happened was not your fault, Arthur. I don’t care what anyone else thinks. You are not to blame.”</p>
<p>He looked up at Arthur’s tear stricken face. “Arthur, at this point, what do you want to do?”</p>
<p>Arthur froze. “I-I- what?”</p>
<p>“I will support you through anything, Arthur. You are my pup. If it means teleporting between you and Vivi every few days, I will do it. If you decide to move across the country, I’ll be there. If you travel, I’ll be there. If you never speak to them again, I’ll support you. Teleporting every few days won’t be difficult now that Shiromori is gone.”</p>
<p>He looked Arthur in the eye. “You are important, Arthur.”</p>
<p>Arthur let out a choked sob, burying his face in his hands. “I- I don’t know…”</p>
<p>He let out a deep sigh, and stood up, walking towards the back. Mystery followed closely.</p>
<p>That’s when Arthur noticed the blood smeared across part of the playground.</p>
<p>“Mystery?”</p>
<p>The dog hummed. “I’ll look near the equipment, you go farther around.”</p>
<p>Arthur nodded, wiping his face, and the two split.</p>
<p>Mystery followed where the smell of blood was strongest, and blanched at the sight.</p>
<p>There was a small child, maybe eight, covered in blood and breathing shallowly. They wore raggedy clothes leaving little to keep the snow out, and his eyes seemed to switch from focused to unfocused.</p>
<p>“You’re… a pretty fox. What’s your... name?”</p>
<p>Mystery froze. This kid could tell?</p>
<p>“How do you-” He shut his mouth quickly. He had just spoken to this… kid. </p>
<p>When he looked at this kid though, and saw the pain and resignation in their eyes, he couldn’t help but sigh.</p>
<p>To fuck with pretending he was a dog, this was a child. A very much hurt child.</p>
<p>“Mystery.” He mumbled, and the kid looked up at him with confusion. “My name. It’s Mystery.”</p>
<p>“..Oh. Well Im- um- Harry? I think..”</p>
<p>Mystery padded a bit closer to the kid, Harry.</p>
<p>“Can you keep this whole talking thing a secret, Harry?”</p>
<p>The boy nodded quickly, and Mystery sighed.</p>
<p>Then, he turned, and barked. Loudly. He needed Arthur over here, he couldn’t change right now without potentially scaring the kid, and he couldn’t leave Arthur alone right now either.</p>
<p>The kid panicked behind him. </p>
<p>“M-Mystery wait! Please, no-”</p>
<p>The kid coughed harshly, and Mystery could see blood splatter between the kid’s fingers. Just as Arthur reached them, the kid collapsed onto Mystery, with surprising lightweightedness. </p>
<p>The stickiness of the kids blood seeping into his fur made him pause, turning to a paling Arthur.</p>
<p>A flash of bright, glowing red and six tails were curling around the kid, and another around Arthur.</p>
<p>A second flash, and they were back in their hotel room.</p>
<p>Arthur scrambled back once he got his footing, staring at the boy Mystery had found with wide eyes.</p>
<p>“Fuck- I- Is that a kid?!”</p>
<p>Mystery nodded, placing the kid on the bed carefully. “I- call an ambulance. And police! Quickly- he’s losing blood too fast!”</p>
<p>“I- Right!” Arthur pulled his phone out quickly and dialed the emergency numbers. Within minutes, he could hear the wailing of sirens. Mystery transformed back into a dog, and Arthur started wrapping gauze everywhere tightly, trying to stem the blood.</p>
<p>There was a bang on the door, and Arthur ran to let them in quickly. </p>
<p>Paramedics flew in like bees.</p>
<p>“Where’s the kid?” one asked, and Arthur led them quickly into the bedroom. “My dog found the kid in the Park- I- I was taking a walk and-”</p>
<p>“We’ll take your statement at the hospital.”</p>
<p>They took the kid in a stretcher, and Arthur rode the ambulance to the hospital, leaving Mystery at the hotel room alone.</p>
<p>The ride to the hospital was a blur, with too many questions asked that Arthur couldn’t answer. As a stand in when they couldn’t find any parents to the kid, they asked him to consent to the surgeries. It was out of practice and almost shady sounding, but Arthur agreed. The kid wouldn’t survive otherwise.</p>
<p>After they arrived at the hospital, the kid was rushed to somewhere important sounding, and Arthur was told to stay in the waiting room and fill out a few forms. </p>
<p>There were far too many blanks where he couldn’t answer because he didn’t know, but he did what he could and turned them in.</p>
<p>It was hours later into the night when he was let back to see the kid, a few bandages on his -her, apparently?- torso. What caught Arthur’s attention however, was the state of the kid’s right leg.</p>
<p>Or to be more precise, the lack of most of it.</p>
