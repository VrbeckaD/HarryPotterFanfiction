  <b>Alright, this is my first work in The 100 fandom, so we'll see how this goes. I have written some fanfiction for Harry Potter and I couldn't shake this idea of Bellarke at Hogwarts. So, whoops? Here we are. </b>
</p><p>
  <b>Some basic knowledge of Harry Potter is necessary, but I do mean basic. </b>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Clark Griffin let out a sigh of relief as she boarded the Hogwarts Express. She had survived the summer, something she wasn’t entirely sure would be possible. Plus, she had made it through without murdering her mother, which was a win. Her mother had crawled back to the Dark Lord, seemingly forgetting that he had murdered her father when he rose from the dead. Clarke would never forgive her mother for that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She slowly walked down the narrow hallway of the train, searching for an empty compartment. She could see the glares of some of her classmates as she walked past and tried to remind herself not to let it get to her. They didn’t know her, not really. They assumed that just because she was a Slytherin that she supported the Dark Lord; it was a stupid stereotype really. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Finally, she found a compartment and with a grin of victory she closed the door, allowing herself a moment to breath. She knew her peace would be short lived and wanted to enjoy it while she could. She couldn’t remember the last time that she had had a moment alone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Much too soon for Clarke’s liking, the door opened revealing the slight figure of her fellow 7th year Slytherin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello Griffin,” Murphy said, pushing his way into the compartment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Murphy,” Clarke nodded in greeting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sorry to hear that Wells transferred to Durmstarng,” Murphy said (and this might be the nicest thing he had ever said to her- Clarke noted). </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke’s entire body shook, screaming at her to correct his lie. Wells wasn’t attending Durmstarng.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Murphy, however, was completely oblivious to the internal debate going on in Clarkes’ mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Me too,” Clarke finally gritted out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heard you made Head Girl though,” Murphy continued, “Been awhile since we’ve had one from Slytherin.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke smiled slightly at that, though she no longer felt as proud of the accomplishment, not when Wells was supposed to be Head Boy, not when they were supposed to be in it together. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s a bummer that you have to work with Blake though,” Murphy said (Clarke would swear that he liked to hear his own voice, just as much as he liked annoying Clarke). </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Blake made Head Boy?” Clarke asked, finally bringing her blue eyes to meet his brown ones. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You didn’t know,” Murphy said, his lips quirking into a smirk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No,” Clarke groaned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was considered one of the known facts of Hogwarts that Bellamy Blake and Clarke Griffin absolutely detested each other. It was right up there with the sky is blue, all the Weasley children have red hair and that Harry Potter would always find trouble. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Should make for an interesting year,” Murphy said, gleefully. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t you have somewhere else to be?” Clarke asked, glaring. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nope.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke rolled her eyes, pulling out her Potions book to help her actively avoid Murphy until the Prefects meeting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bellamy Blake had felt an incredible amount of pride when he received his Hogwarts letter and discovered he was Head Boy. Many people had underestimated him and he fought hard to prove himself. This was a symbol that all of his hard work had paid off, which he and Ocatavia had celebrated by sneaking out to the muggle bar down the street from where their mother lived. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He and Octavia had grown up in the muggle world, their mother working odd jobs and often leaving the two alone. Despite being only a year older, Bellamy took on the role of the adult in the house taking care of Octavia the best he could. Both were oblivious to the fact that magic existed until Bellamy got his letter at age 11. His mother had been fearful, thinking that he would leave her like their father had. She almost didn’t let Bellamy go to Hogwarts, but after assuring her that he would come back, that he was nothing like their father, she had conceded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The minute he got to Hogwarts, he worked hard. He was desperate to prove that just because he had grown up in a muggle household did not mean that he would be behind the Pure-Bloods in their classes. When You-Know-Who rose from the dead, and the prejudices really started showing, Bellamy did his best to protect Octavia, as he always had. Now, he thought smugly, he was the Head Boy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He sat in the Prefects compartment, waiting for the Head Girl to arrive. Their meeting wasn’t set for another thirty minutes, but he was hoping to meet with her to make sure that they were on the same page. He knew that he should have never expected the Princess to show up early, she was probably expecting to run the whole meeting herself. He would never understand how she got through life, always getting what she wanted. He supposed that was what it was like to be privileged though and always in high standing with whomever was in charge. He could never sell his morals just to be in power, but he supposed that was what made him a decent person. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was surprised when the compartment door opened, and Clarke came in, her blonde hair pulled back in its signature braid. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Princess,” he greeted, snidely. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello Blake,” she retorted coldly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was thinking-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You shouldn’t do that, I wouldn’t want you to hurt your brain,” she responded, without missing a beat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bellamy glared at her, running his hands through his hair in frustration, before continuing, “-that I could talk about the patrol schedule and you could talk about the responsibilities.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine,” Clarke argeed, stopping the argument that was on the tip of Bellamy’s tongue. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was thinking that for patrolling it should be done in groups of four instead of two,” Clarke said, “Can never be too safe.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We will never fill all of the spots then,” Bellamy pointed out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What about in trios then?” Clarke asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That would be doable. Is there something that I should know?” he asked, looking at her uneasily. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He knew that her family stood with You-Know-Who, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that she knew something that he didn’t. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just being cautious, that’s all,” Clarke said, glaring at him for his implications. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Anything else we should discuss before the Prefects start coming in?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not that I can think of,” Clarke said, opening the potions book that she brought with her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bellamy just stared at her. Who in Merlin’s name brought a book to a meeting? Rolling his eyes at how rude she was, he looked out the window, willing the Prefects meeting to start. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Slowly, the Prefects started filing into the room. The 5th years were among the first to arrive, all grinning proudly. Clarke could remember when she and Wells had attended their first meeting, they had practically been bouncing up and down with excitement. The 6th years filed in, looking confident, but not over eager followed by the 7th years who were trying not to let their resentment show. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We would like to take a moment to welcome all of you,” Clarke began, standing up to address the Prefects, “Being a Prefect is a great honor, and you were chosen from everyone else in your year to be a leader. Becoming a leader comes with more responsibilities.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke paused, (Bellamy would swear it was just for dramatic effect-though he could not deny that the Prefects were hanging on to every word). </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can now take away house points, but only with a valid reason. You are required to document any time you take away points,” Clarke said, passing around a paper, “The paper looks like this. You will submit the papers to the Head Boy or myself, either at one of our Prefect meetings or in our mailbox. Are there any questions about this?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are we allowed to give out detentions?” asked Draco (and Bellamy fought to not roll his eyes-he had been a Prefect last year, surely he knew the answer to that). </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No,” Clarke responded, “If you feel that another student deserves a detention then it is your responsibility to find a Professor.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke watched as Malfoy rolled his eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Another responsibility you have as Prefects is to help patrol,” Bellamy began, “You will patrol with two other Prefects, which is different than last year. This means that you will patrol more often than you have in previous years. The Head Girl and I will still make the patrol schedule, you receive your schedule for the month at the Prefect meetings. This month we will let you sign up for times, you need to put your name down for three different days.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bellamy passed the sign up sheet around, along with a self-inking quill, “Any questions?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Why are we increasing patrols?” asked a 5th year Hufflepuff, Clarke thought her name was Monroe. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We can never be too safe, especially in dark times like these,” Bellamy replied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With You-Know-Who back and gaining power, Bellamy knew that they could never be too safe. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If there are no other questions, you may leave after you have signed up for your patrol times,” Clarke said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Together, the Head Boy and Girl watched as the Prefects finished filling out the schedule and slowly filed out of the compartment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We should set up a time to meet the two of us. We will have regular meetings with Professor Dumbledore, but I think it will be helpful if we are on the same page,” Clarke said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We can do whatever the hell you want Princess,” Bellamy said, rolling his eyes, why hadn’t he thought of that? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“When will work best for you?” Clarke asked, through gritted teeth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why don’t we wait until we’ve got our schedules first?” Bellamy suggested. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine. Now if that’s all,” Clarke said, standing to leave. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course. I wouldn’t want to keep the Princess hostage.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke rolled her eyes and tried not to slam the compartment door on her way out. Bellamy Blake knew just how to push all of her buttons, while simultaneously knowing absolutely nothing about her. It was positively infuriating. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke made her way back to her compartment, and found that Emori and Raven had joined Murphy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You and Blake did a nice job in the meeting,” Raven said, while Clarke grinned at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The pair had struck an unlikely friendship when they discovered that they were dating the same guy. Turns out, Finn Collins did not expect them to talk to each other, they were in different houses and all. His luck ran out when Murphy started dating Emori last year, and their mutual friend put it together. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When the two got to talking, they bonded over their hate for Finn and learned that they had quite a bit in common. The pair had been friends ever since. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thanks Reyes,” Clarke said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was hoping that you and Blake would duel,” Murphy said, “You lost me a galleon Griffin.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was a dumb bet to make John,” Emori said, but she was grinning. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s not like it’s uncommon for them to duel,” Murphy pointed out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They were very peaceful,” Raven commented. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I never thought I would hear the day,” Emori laughed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I still don’t understand why you two hate each other so much,” Raven said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know that anyone really does, it just is what it is,” Emori said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s just so infuriating. He thinks that he is always right, and he is constantly looking out for himself, not caring what he does to get it,” Clarke said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think that they’re a little two similiar,” Murphy said, smirking because he knew it would anger Clarke. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?” Clarke said, enraged, but after taking a look at Murphy, she realized he was trying to push her buttons, “Go fuck yourself, Murphy.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Murphy, Emori and Raven shared a grin, while Clarke opened up her book, which she continued to read until they reached the castle. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After the Prefect meeting Bellamy made his way to the compartment that Octavia was sitting in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How was the meeting?” Octavia asked, from her spot next to Finn and Jasper. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It went fine, O,” Bellamy said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No one died?” Jasper asked, a teasing smile on his face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No one died,” Bellamy confirmed, rolling his eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m surprised,” Octavia said with a laugh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think we all are, I owe Monty 5 sickles,” Jasper groaned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then maybe you shouldn’t bet on your friends,” Bellamy pointed out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It keeps life exciting,” Jasper argued.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did you get any of Monty’s moonshine?” Octavia asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He brewed a lot this summer, he said he’d get you some,” Jasper confirmed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You are the best Jasp,” Octavia said, while Jasper blushed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bellamy wasn’t sure if his sister was oblivious to Jaspers affections for her, or if she was choosing to ignore them. Either way, it made him uncomfortable. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So, do you all feel old, now that you’re big, bad 7th years?” Octavia asked, grinning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It means I’m one step closer to being an Auror,” Bellamy replied with a shrug.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He loved Hogwarts, it felt more like home to him than the small apartment they share with their mother in the summers. However, he was ready to graduate and start fighting in the war. He hated watching the injustice in the world, knowing that there was nothing that he could about it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clarke climbed into one of the last carriages, after helping Hagrid organize the first years, she was ready to enjoy a few minutes of peace before she started the school year. Clarke knew she was walking on a thin line, and that she needed to be careful this year. If anyone suspected her real intentions, she was a dead woman walking when she graduated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Unfortunately Clarke’s peace was short lived, and Finn Collins hopped into the carriage with her. Clarke didn’t even bother to hide her groan. He had the decentency to look embarrassed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was hoping to speak with you,” Finn said, quietly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh Merlin, here we go,” Clarke said, “Can you not?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Look, Clarke, I know that some unfortunate things happened last year, but I love you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just like you loved Raven?” Clarke asked bitterly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, not like I loved Raven. What I felt for Raven, was a childhood crush. I am in love with you, Clarke Griffin. I will always be in love with you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, that’s just too damn bad Finn,” Clarke said, “It is never going to happen.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Please Clarke, I know I messed up. Just give me one more chance,” Finn pleaded, his brown eyes boring into her blue ones. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not a chance Finn,” Clarke said, “You didn’t just mess up. You dated both of us for a year and thought that you could get away with it.That’s not a small mistake Finn. I could never trust you after something like that.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Please Clarke.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke all but jumped out of the carriage before it had even made a full stop. She was desperate to get away from her ex. She strolled purposefully into the Great Hall, Finn following behind her. Raven shot her a questioning look, which Clarke responded with a puking face. She needed her friend to know that she wasn’t interested in Finn Collins. Raven’s friendship was the best thing she had gotten from that relationship. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see Collins is back to following you around like a lost puppy,” Murphy said as Clarke took the empty seat next to him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If I didn’t know any better, I’d think you saved me this seat on purpose,” Clarke retorted, ignoring his comment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“In your dreams Griffin,” Murphy replied, but he grinned and Clarke nodded gratefully. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At the end of the table Clarke could see Malfoy whispering with Crabbe and Goyle gleefully. That could only mean that he had done something to Harry Potter. Clarke glanced around the Great Hall, looking for his signature messy hair. She could see both Ron and Hermione sitting with nervous looks on their faces, and knew that could mean nothing good. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bellamy sat at Gryffindor table, watching as Finn trailed pathetically after the Princess. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you think he’ll ever learn it’s not going to happen?” Octavia asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not likely,” Bellamy said, “I don’t understand why he’s so obsessed with her.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He claims he’s in love,” Miller said, rolling his eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think he’d know what love was if it hit him smack in the face,” Roma replied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bellamy looked over and saw Ron and Hermione whispering nervously with Neville and Ginny. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you think that is about?” Bellamy asked, as Finn sat down with the group. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t see the ‘Chosen One’ anywhere,” Octavia pointed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Where is Potter?” Miller asked suspiciously, “It normally means nothing good if he isn’t around.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He wasn’t in the last carriages,” Finn answered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>However, before anyone could respond, the first years were paraded into the Great Hall by Professor McGonagall, and the sorting ceremony began. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once the sorting hat finished his song about unity and sticking together, Murphy turned, eyebrows raised towards Clarke. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Has the sorting hat met the Gryffindors?” Murphy asked, “How can we stick together when they are a bunch of stubborn idiots?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke had to chuckle at that, “They aren’t very good at thinking things through. More like a jump first and ask questions later types of people.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That is what separates the Slytherins from the Gryffidnors. At least we use our heads.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Murphy and Clarke watched sorting, neither really paying attention. Murphy was tapping his fingers on the table, while Clarke picked at her nails.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I got some moonshine from Monty on the train, want any?” Murphy asked, holding a flask towards her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m the Head Girl,” Clarke said, “You’re lucky I don’t confiscate that.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Please, I have seen you out drink most of the house Griffin.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That was before I was Head Girl. I need to appear responsible now.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Suit yourself,” Murphy said, shrugging and taking another swig. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke just shook her head, but didn’t stop him. She watched as Professor Snape got up in the middle of the sorting and left the Great Hall. Clarke and Murphy shared a confused look, but continued watching in silence. Once the sorting was completed, food appeared on the long tables in front of them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke started adding food to her plate, keeping her eye on the door. She was hoping that she would get a hint about where Professor Snape had gone. She shouldn’t have been surprised when he strolled in a few minutes later, Harry Potter coming in behind him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m amazed that Potter hasn’t been expelled,” Murphy observed, and Clarke nodded in agreement. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wonder what happened, his face looks bloody,” Clarke observed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Malfoy,” Murphy said, nodding towards their blonde housemate, who was looking smug.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Clarke said, rolling her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They’re hatred for each other might rival yours’ and Blakes,” Murphy teased. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They can have the title as Hogwarts biggest enemies,” Clarke said, before turning back to her food. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once the feast was over, Professor Dumbledore stood to give his speech. Clarke gasped (along with half the student body) when she saw his hand. It was black and looked almost as if it was decomposing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you think happened?” Clarke whispered to Murphy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your guess is as good as mine,” Murphy replied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>All around the Great Hall students were whispering, everyone clearly was wondering what had happened to the Headmaster’s hand. Clarke’s best guess was that he had touched a cursed object, but that didn’t feel right. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s nothing to worry about,” Professor Dumbledore said nonchalantly (though, judging by the incredulous looks of those around him, no one believed him), “Now, to our new students, I would like to welcome you, and to our returning students, welcome back. You are in store for another year of magical education. Our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you that any joke item bought at Weasley Wizard Wheezes is prohibited. Those who wish to play for their house Quidditch team should give their names to their Head of House. Please remember that 1st years are not allowed to tryout. We are also looking for a new Quidditch commentator, if you are interested please see your Head of House as well.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You going to tryout this year Griffin?” Murphy asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No,” Clarke replied, rolling her eyes, “I don’t have time for Quidditch.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course not, Princess,” Murphy said, smirking while Clarke reached over to smack him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now, I would like to welcome the newest member of our staff, Professor Slughorn. He has kindly agreed to resume his old post of Potions Master.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a collective gasp throughout the hall. Professor Snape had been the potions master for many years now and Clarke was wondering what changed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor Snape, meanwhile,” Professor Dumbledore continued, raising his voice slightly, “Will be our new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a “no” shouted quite loudly from the Gryffindor table, if Clarke had to take a guess she would say it came from Potter. Clarke herself was quite surprised at this development as well. Surely Professor Dumbledore knew of his association with the Death Eaters, so why would he have him teaching the students how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts? It made no sense to Clarke. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, that was unexpected,” Murphy mumbled, and Clarke nodded her agreement. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>However, Professor Dumbledore had not finished, “Now, as everybody in this Hall knows, Lord Voldemort and his followers are once more at large and gaining strength.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Great Hall had once more fallen silent, many people flinching at the mention of You-Know-Who’s name. Many Slytherins had decided to tune out the Professor, deeming whatever he had to say on the matter as irrelevant. Clarke tried not to appear over-eager to hear what the Headmaster was going to share. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is, and how much care each of us at Hogwarts must take to ensure we stay safe. The castle’s magical fortifications have been strengthened over the summer, we are protected in new and powerful ways, but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of the staff. I urge you, therefore, to abide by any security restrictions that your teachers might impose on you, however irksome you might find them- in particular, the rule that you are not allowed to be out of bed after hours. I should implore you, should you notice anything strange or suspicious inside or outside of the castle, please report it to a staff member immediately. I trust you to conduct yourselves, as always, with the utmost regard for your safety and the safety of others.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The mood in the Hall had shifted, gone were the excited faces that the students once wore, replaced with nervous expressions. Clarke took a moment to look around and observe the faces of those sitting around her. She noted that Murphy looked uncomfortable, and was reminded about why she considered him a friend. However, most of her table was smirking, and none more so than Malfoy. Clarke had an uneasy feeling as she looked around, and tried to make sure that her face remained neutral. She was grateful that she was no longer sleeping in the Slytherin Common Room, it would make it easier for her to keep her secret. She knew she would be dead if anyone found it out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But now,” Professor Dumbledore continued, “Your beds await, as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish, and I know that your top priority is to be well rested for your lessons tomorrow. Let us therefore say good night. Pip Pip.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Many Slytherins rolled their eyes, while a few students laughed. The first years looked pretty confused, not yet used to the Headmaster’s strange sayings. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So, are you going to stay in the Head Chambers?” Murphy asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why wouldn’t I?” Clarke asked, “A room all to myself?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You will have to share a common room with Blake,” Murphy pointed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can handle Blake,” Clarke replied confidently. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course you can. You’re the brightest witch in our year for a reason.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke grinned at that, she had worked hard to remain at the top of their class. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good night Murphy,” Clarke said, looking forward to going back to her own room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Night Griffin,” he said, before making his way towards the dungeons. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke made her way towards the Astronomy Tower, knowing that the Head Common Room was near them. It would be weird staying in a tower, as opposed to the Dungeons, Clarke thought to herself. However, it would be closer to the stars and would have a good view of the grounds. Clarke was excited about the idea of being able to draw the view. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m surprised you picked to stay in the Heads Commons Princess. I would have thought you would want to stay with your fellow snakes,” Bellamy said, coming up behind her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke tried not to jump, she didn’t want to give him the satisfaction of knowing he startled her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who would say no to a room by themselves?” Clarke asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bellamy shrugged and they made their way to the Portrait in an uncomfortable silence. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Look up at the stars and not at your feet,” Clarke told the Portrait. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Very good, always remember that,” the painting replied, before swinging open. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Motivational,” Bellamy muttered, while Clarke hid her grin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke and Bellamy walked through and what Clarke saw took her breath away. The room was small, but cozy. There was a fireplace in the corner, which was lit and burning, as well as a few leather armchairs and couches. It was decorated in both Gryffindor and Slytherin colors. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bellamy already knew that Octavia would be spending a lot of time napping on the couch, procrastinating her work. Bellamy hoped that Clarke didn’t plan on having any of her friends over, he couldn’t stand the idea of trying to work with stuck up Slytherins around. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke, however, was not thinking about any of that. She was walking around one of the desks and thinking about how much Wells would have loved this room. Clarke shook her head, trying not to think about it. To one side, there was a short hallway, leading to the Prefects meeting room. The Prefects could reach it through the hallway, as long as they had their badge on them. On the other side were two doors, one labeled Head Boy and one labeled Head Girl. Clarke grinned, excited about being able to have a room to herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to bed, good night,” Clarke said, while Bellamy waved from his place lounging on the couch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke’s room was decorated with greens and blues and beautiful paintings hung on the walls. The headboard on the bed was marked with the initials of all previous Head Girls and Clarke couldn’t wait to carve hers into the headboard as well.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a window seat near the giant window as well as a giant bookshelf along the wall. The room was perfect. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke grinned, knowing that she was going to want to paint before she went to bed. She quickly changed into her painting clothes and took out her supplies from her trunk, before sitting down on the window seat and getting to work. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bellamy woke up early the next morning, looking forward to his run around the castle grounds. After changing into his running clothes and tying his shoes, he walked towards the grounds. He was not surprised to see Raven and Octavia already stretching. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Morning Ladies,” Bellamy said, joining them in stretching. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How far are we going today Blakes?” Raven asked, looking between the siblings. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A few miles,” Bellamy said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Race ya,” Octavia said, before taking off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bellamy and Raven raced after her, sharing a grin. Bellamy loved the way the cool air helped him wake up, and it was a nice way to see the Castle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He could see some older wizards appearing to be patrolling the grounds. He wondered if they were Aurors sent by the Ministry as an extra safety precaution. Bellamy had not considered the possibility that they might not be safe at Hogwarts. He had assumed that this was the one place he and Octavia would be safe. Sure, odd things happened, but they had always been safe. He was banking on the fact that You-Know-Who was afraid of Dumbledore. Now he wasn’t so sure. He would need to remain vigilant. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clarke awoke to the sound of Bellamy leaving the common room, and looked down at her watch with a curse. She had fallen asleep while painting last night, apparently forgetting to set an alarm. She jumped out of bed, racing into her bathroom to take a quick shower. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a wave of her wand, she dried her wavy blonde hair while trying to tie her tie. If she raced to the Great Hall she would make it in time for a bite to eat and to get her schedule before classes started. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She cursed herself for not getting up the first time she heard him leave, maybe then she would have been ready on time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She speed walked through the corridors trying to get to the Great Hall, while not bringing attention to herself. It was not a good sign for the Head Girl to be late on her first day of classes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Running behind Miss Griffin?” Professor Snape asked as Clarke approached him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course not Professor,” Clarke replied, “Just got distracted reading my Defense book. Congratulations on the position change.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you Miss Griffin,” though judging by the look he gave her, he didn’t quite believe her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Looking at her schedule, Clarke was relieved to find that Potions was the first class of the day. Potions was easily her best class. Since starting N.E.W.T. level classes last year, all the students in their year took classes together. At the start of the 6th year they had been able to choose which classes they wanted to continue taking (as long as the had the O.W.L. scores needed). With only a select amount of students in each class, they all took them together. Unfortunately, that meant that Clarke had started seeing a lot more of Bellamy Blake, who always seemed desperate to prove that he was better than her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After grabbing a piece of toast, Clarke made her way into the familiar dungeons. She took a shortcut that she had learned in her second year, ensuring that she made it to class on time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Cutting it a little close aren’t ya Princess?” Bellamy asked, smirking at her from his seat in the front. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke gave him the middle finger and kept walking back towards where Murphy, Emori and Raven were sitting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Morning Griffin,” Raven said, smiling. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Late start?” Murphy teased. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shut up.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Forget to set your alarm?” Emori asked kindly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Unfortunately.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s only the first day of classes,” Raven laughed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I accidentally fell asleep painting last night,” Clarke shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, you still got a little in your hair,” Murphy pointed out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Damnit,” Clarke muttered, peeling it out while Murphy laughed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good morning class,” Professor Slughorn said, entering the classroom, huffing as if he’d just run a marathon. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good morning Professor,” the class dutifully responded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Today, we are going to look at three different potions. It is your job to work with your classmates to determine what the potions are. One of the potions can be brewed in our class period today. That is your goal.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke grinned at the idea of a challenge. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, thank Merlin you’re on my team Griffin,” Murphy said, smirking. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lucky you,” Clarke laughed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke pulled out her potions book, her parchment and a quill. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let’s go and observe the potions, we can use our observations to help us figure it out,” Raven suggested. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Together, the group of four made their way towards the potions, along with most of the class. Bellamy was already scribbling down the observations his group had made. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke looked over the potions closely, smiling when she thought she figured it out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I  think I have it,” she whispered to her group, who grinned at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Together they made their way back to their desks. Clarke glared when she saw that Bellamy, Finn, Jasper and Monty were already setting up their cauldron. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you think it is?” Emori asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m thinking it’s Felix Felicis, it has the same clear color as middle potion. Plus, while it is complicated to brew, it does not take a significant amount of time to do so. In fact, many people attempt to make the potion when they realize how quickly it brews. However, if even one thing is done wrong then it doesn’t come out right,” Clarke informed her group.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, let’s not make any mistakes then,” Raven said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do we need?” Murphy asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time class was coming to an end, Bellamy felt confident in his groups’ Felix Felicis. It was the exact clear color that it was supposed to be. Monty just needed to stir it counter clockwise three more times. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Looking towards the back of the room he did not like the confident smirk on Clarke’s face. The one she wore when she thought she was smarter than everyone else. Bellamy shook his head, just because she thought she was smarter than everyone else, didn’t mean it was true. Bellamy was confident that he and his group had gotten the potion correct. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What potion did you brew?” Professor Slughorn asked as he approached. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Felix Felicis, Sir,” Bellamy answered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And why did you brew Felix Felicis?” Professor Slughorn asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The color and the consistency matched,” Monty replied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Plus, it was the quickest to brew of the three potions,” Bellamy added, “Amortenia takes a month to brew and Veritiserum takes two. Neither were quick enough to brew in a single class period.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Very good. I am awarding 5 house points to all of you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bellamy grinned victoriously, sharing a high-five with his group mates. He watched as Professor Slughorn made his way over to Clarke’s group. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tell me, what potion did you brew?” Professor Slughorn asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Felix Felicis,” Murphy replied, smirking at Clarke. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Excellent, why did you brew Felix Felicis?” Professor Slughorn asked, “Why, Miss Griffin. It is excellent to finally meet you, your mother was one of my favorite students. She had such an eye for potions. Perhaps you do as well. Can you tell me why your group brewed Felix Felicis?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was the only potion that could be fast enough to brew Sir,” Clarke said, ignoring his comments on her mother, “The Amortenia takes a month to brew, when brewed correctly and Veritiserum takes at least two. Looking at the color it was going to be Felix Felicis or it was going to be Skele-Gro, both of which could be brewed within a single class. However, it had the sweet aroma of Felix Felicis, not the bitter smell of Skele-Gro.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Very good Miss Griffin, it appears you do take after your mother,” He said, while Clarke tried not to groan, “Everyone in your group will receive 5 house points for brewing the correct potion. Miss Griffin, you will receive an extra 5 points for such a detailed explanation.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“With all due respect, Sir, I would not have reached the conclusion without my group,” Clarke tried. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Very well, 10 points for each of you,” He said, waving his hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nice job Griffin,” Emori said, smirking at Clarke. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clarke grinned victoriously, knowing that is the opposite of what her mother would have done. While Professor Slughorn thought there were similarities between the mother and daughter, Clarke knew that they couldn’t be more different if they tried. Her mother followed the Dark Lord, blinded by his power, giving no mind to the fact that he had killed her husband on his return to life. Clarke, recognized his cruelty and would never follow someone so terrible. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her mother would kill her with little hesitation, if she knew what Clarke had done. Just as Jaha had murdered Wells this summer.  </span>
