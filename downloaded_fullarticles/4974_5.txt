<p>Hermione stumbled on the steps while trying hard to keep up with Harry. He knocked frantically on the Head dorms a few minutes ago asking her to accompany him on an abandoned classroom on the fifth floor, leaving the portrait on the door sputtering in indignation. She asked what it was that he was excited about but he just grabbed her hand, dragged her to Merlin knows where, and told her to see for herself. It was a good thing that Draco Malfoy, the Head boy wasn't around or they would have argued again just like little first years. Boys. She'll never understand them. She was able to catch up just as he quietly opened the door to a classroom unknown to her when they heard the voices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Seriously, why the fuck did you take me here?" Malfoy's clear baritone echoed through the room. It seems he got there first along with his Slytherin minions. They didn't notice their presence and continued their conversation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Just face the mirror Draco." It was Theo. Pushing him to face a rather familiar mirror she'd read about on Hogwarts: A History.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"What's so special about this mirror? I mean if it shows me getting hotter which is impossi-"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Oh just shut up and tell us what you see." Blaise taunted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Fine! This better be worth leaving the warmth of my room." He slowly turned and faced the enormous glass in front of him and let out a chocked laughter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Very funny guys. Who enchanted the mirror to make me see Granger and I with a child?" Draco muttered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"That's the Mirror of Erised and cannot be tampered with enchantments." Blaise said nonchalantly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was snickering and a gasp. The latter came from her. The three heads quickly turned and glanced their way. Malfoy was the first to look away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"The Mirror of.." as if realizing what that meant, the blond's eyes widened, pink staining his pale cheeks. He fled the room in haste as if Dementors were hot on his heels.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Well..that's quite a discovery." Blaise smirked. "Guess I'll be seeing more of you after graduation, Granger." He quietly exited, Theo trailing after him. A quiet conversation and laughter echoing through the corridors followed them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione fidgeted, brows furrowed, and looked at Harry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Uhm, you wanted to show me something?"</p>
