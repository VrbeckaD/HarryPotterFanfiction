    <p>“Three Firewhiskey shots,” you heard a very familiar voice say.</p>
<p>Turning from behind the bar where you had been simultaneously preparing multiple Butterbeer pitchers with your wand, you turned and shot him a wide smile. “Certainly, sir,” you said, your tone teasing. “Though I do feel the need to remind you that the last time you were in this bar I had to help you home, so-”</p>
<p>“I remember.” Draco rolled his eyes, but he was grinning. “In my defense, it was a weekend night. And Theo had to bear most of my weight, anyway.”</p>
<p>You shook your head at him. “Still.”</p>
<p>“Point taken,” he conceded, though he gave you a look that he must have assumed was of supreme innocence. “But am I to blame for wanting to spend some time with my very best friend at her job?”</p>
<p>It was your turn to roll your eyes with a smile. “Excuses, and now flattery? You should know better.” Carefully, you levitated all of the pitchers you had just made onto a tray, along with some empty glasses, and then laughed at the way he was playfully arching his eyebrow at you. “Is everyone else coming tonight, too?”</p>
<p>“Just Daphne and Pansy, I think,” he replied.</p>
<p>“I’m off in just a few minutes,” you told him, and then you walked away, hovering the tray in front of you around the bar and out to one of the booths, which was packed with a group of young men.</p>
<p>“Well hello there, gorgeous,” one of them said, and the others chortled at his comment. All of their eyeballs were trained on you appreciatively, not even bothering to hide the fact that they were scanning you up and down. You were used to this sort of treatment from male customers, and though you were tipped well for putting up with it, that didn’t make it any less irritating at times.</p>
<p>“Hey, boys,” you said easily, ignoring their gazes as best you could and flicking your wand again so that everything filed off the tray and onto the table. “Enjoy your drinks, yeah?”</p>
<p>“Made by you? I’m sure we will,” another one said, and they all laughed again the way that groups of men do when they sexualize a woman in a bar. You merely gave them a humorless smile before striding away back to the bar, rolling your eyes irritably as soon as they could no longer see your face. When you arrived back at your station and began preparing Draco’s Firewhiskey shots, he was watching you carefully.</p>
<p>“Those guys bothering you?” he asked finally, his voice very tight.</p>
<p>“No,” you assured him very quickly. Peeking down, you saw that his arm lying on the counter top was clenched into a fist, and you briefly wondered how much he had heard. You hoped nothing. Draco’s brotherly instincts had caused him to overreact about this kind of thing before.</p>
<p>His voice was low and rough, and it was as if he were struggling not to say it but couldn’t help himself. “Really? Because they were eye raping you.”</p>
<p>You opened your mouth to retort but you were cut off by a loud, female voice that was laced with amusement. “Oh, but Draco, how else would she make her money?” Pansy had arrived, with her arm slung over Daphne’s shoulders, and she was giving you a mischievous smile. “I say that Y/N should use her sex appeal to milk those idiots' wallets dry, personally."</p>
<p>Reaching over the bar, she kissed you on the cheek twice in greeting, as did Daphne, before they settled in the stools next to Draco, who looked very sour indeed and glared at the Firewhiskey shots you passed him.</p>
<p>Without asking, you started making Daphne and Pansy’s favorite cocktails as was your usual routine and set them in front of them. “Thanks, Y/N,” said Daphne, beaming at you.</p>
<p>“Yeah, thanks,” said Pansy, knocking half of hers back in one go.</p>
<p>It was time for your shift to be over, so you went to cash out, take off your apron, and update the bartender taking over for you - Amanda - and by the time you were back and had slid in to the seat next to Draco, Pansy was chatting animatedly about a party she had thrown for a client a few days ago. “So,” she said after the story, “Speaking of parties – Y/N, will you come over tomorrow and get ready with Daphne and I before the Ministry gala?”</p>
<p>Draco groaned out loud, and you couldn’t say you blamed him.</p>
<p>Ever since the end of the second War, things had been rocky at best in the Wizarding world. Relationships between Pureblood families and the rest of the magical community were still rather strained, to say the least, as many felt that some of the Pureblood families deserved more punishment. Indeed, your group of Slytherin friends did not usually get friendly glances in public, to say the least. This Gala they were throwing was a way to try and mend relations and promote unity.</p>
<p>Pansy, whose job involved planning and throwing some of the biggest bashes for the richest people, had been put in charge of organizing it. Of course, that meant the party itself was going to be wonderfully done – Pansy was damn good at her job. The problem was that half of the people there hated the lot of you, and many still wanted to see Draco in particular, the ex Death Eater, behind bars, and they were still angry about his easy trial after the Dark Lord had been defeated.</p>
<p>The Ministry (and not to mention Pansy) had been quite adamant that you all come, however, so there really wasn’t a way out of it. Narcissa had surprisingly been behind the idea, as well. After Lucius had been put in Azkaban, she was desperate to mend public perceptions of the Malfoys and restore the family's good name.</p>
<p>“There’s no way out of it?” asked Draco, who seemed to be thinking along the exact same lines as you.</p>
<p>“Sadly not,” answered Pansy.</p>
<p>“Fine,” Draco said gruffly, a stormy expression on his face Underneath, you could detect the dread in his eyes. “But there better be lots of booze.”</p>
<p>“Oh, there’ll be plenty of booze,” said Pansy, a little darkly. “I think everyone there will need a way to relax. So, Y/N, what time do you want to come by tomorrow? Does 3 PM sound good?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” you said, nodding.</p>
<p>Pansy smiled, though you could see the slight strain on her face. You were sure planning this thing had been stressful on her lately. “Great!”</p>
<p>A cheerful voice suddenly sounded from behind you. “Hey, ladies!”</p>
<p>Three of the men from the group had come over to stand near you, smiling widely. The others were peering across the room, clearly excited to see if their friends would emerge victorious. The Butterbeers you had given this group of men were already beginning to take effect; which was no surprise, seeing as how many of the pitchers were already empty. You were suddenly infinitely glad that your shift was over and they were no longer your responsibility. “You two, hey!”</p>
<p>The man speaking was addressing Pansy and Daphne, and with knowing looks on their faces, the couple turned to face the three men, who were all grinning stupidly. “Want to join us and give us a little show later?”</p>
<p>There was a loud peal of laughter at this, also from the table across the way. Daphne looked positively furious - a rarity on her - and Draco’s shoulders tensed. He quickly reached for his shots and knocked all three of them back so quickly you could only sit there watching, mouth agape in surprise.</p>
<p>Pansy, however, merely gave a soft, tinkling laugh and shot them a smile that you recognized all too well. It was dangerous. “Well unfortunately, boys, even the sight of cock makes us sick, so we’ll have to decline.” Her voice suddenly darkened and got much, much sharper. “To translate? Fuck off.”</p>
<p>There was another wave of rowdy laughter at her response, and their hungry eyes shifted to you. Involuntarily, you leaned away, putting distance between you and them as you felt your heart speed up. You heard but did not see the way Draco shifted in his seat beside you. “Well, what about you, beautiful? How do <em>you</em> feel about cock?” asked one of them jeeringly, and you felt your insides twist at his crude language and the way that his eyes were scanning you.</p>
<p>But you didn’t have to sit with your discomfort for long, because Draco had finally snapped. He stood to face the men and drew his wand, a terrible fury twisting his features and his eyes blazing wildly. “If you want to keep your cock,” he snarled, his voice low but threatening, “I suggest you walk away and leave the women alone. Now.”</p>
<p>Instantly, all three men drew their wands as well, pointing them directly at Draco’s heaving chest. Most people in the bar had turned to watch, and the room had suddenly gotten extremely quiet.</p>
<p>“Draco,” you began to protest - he was outnumbered, and you didn’t like to see wands pointed at him - but he didn’t look at you or give any indication that he had even heard. His jaw was clenched very tightly and his gaze was hard as he simply stared down the group, unwilling to back down.</p>
<p>“Merlin, you’ve got an aggressive boyfriend,” one of them said to you, eyeing Draco with intense dislike.</p>
<p>You sighed heavily. “He’s not-”</p>
<p>But you were cut off by yet another male voice that you knew all too well. “Actually, I like to think I’m only an aggressive person on the Quidditch pitch.”</p>
<p>Your boyfriend of some months now, Ethan, had appeared - apparently intending to pick you up from work - and though his words were somewhat of a joke, his voice was a little strained. However, his narrowed eyes were not fixed on the other men, like you had expected, but on Draco. “<em>I’m</em> actually her boyfriend, you see,” he continued, rather unnecessarily, striding up to stand beside you and facing the men with his chin held high.</p>
<p>Ethan was very tall, with olive toned skin, and his dark eyes glinted at the group rather threateningly. Immediately, looking between the two men flanked on either side of you, their group deflated. And, just as suddenly as it had all begun, they had put away their wands and were already walking away, grumbling to themselves. There was a long, uncomfortable pause.</p>
<p>“That was…” began Daphne, apparently looking for words.</p>
<p>“Ridiculous,” finished Pansy for her.</p>
<p>“I seem to have arrived at the right time then,” said Ethan, raising his eyebrows. His gaze flicked to Draco one more time, lingering momentarily before it moved to Daphne and Pansy. “How are you two?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Great,” said Pansy, giving him a winning smile. “We were just talking about the Gala tomorrow. I assume you’ll be there?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes. I’m looking forward to it,” he said, flashing her a smile just as dazzling. He had lots of practice from all the Quidditch interviews. You missed Draco’s dark, skeptical look from behind you and the way he pursed his lips before throwing back another shot. Ethan continued speaking cheerfully. “Would you all mind if I steal Y/N for the rest of the evening? I was away all last week, you see, so I’d like to spend some - ah - quality time with my girlfriend.” Again, his eyes flicked briefly over to Draco behind you before they rested on you. He smiled.</p>
<p>“Not at all,” said Daphne quickly.</p>
<p>“We can all spend time together at the party tomorrow, I hope?” said Ethan.</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Pansy. “See you two tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Bye,” you said to them, and then turned to look up into Draco’s face. You had the distinct feeling he was trying to keep his temper under control, because you could practically see the tension rolling off his body in waves. You sighed. “See you later?” you said to him, softly, reaching out to touch his arm reassuringly.</p>
<p>He cleared his throat. “Yeah…later.” It seemed to cost him great effort even for those two words, so you didn’t push further. You just gave them all one, final smile and then turned to go. As soon as you had walked away - with Ethan’s arm wrapped securely around your waist - Draco’s scowl deepened and he signaled the new bartender for yet another round of Firewhiskey shots.</p>
<p>“So much testosterone,” giggled Daphne.</p>
<p>“Shut it,” muttered Draco, teeth clenched.</p>
<p>“Seriously,” said Pansy, “Could it be any more obvious that you hate him?”</p>
<p>“What about <em>him</em>?” Draco was sullen that his two friends weren’t immediately jumping to his defense. “He’s always been a prick to me. You notice how he talked to you two and ignored me, right?"</p>
<p>“He, like you, is just trying to show who has the biggest, reddest ass,” said Pansy, grinning. “Men are so easy.”</p>
<p>Daphne nodded wisely. “This isn’t the first time you were mistaken to be her lover. It’s natural he’ll feel threatened by you.”</p>
<p>“I’m just looking after her. Like any good best friend would,” Draco muttered, eyes moving to the counter top and frowning. “He’s just an arse.”</p>
<p>“You say that about all her boyfriends,” Daphne reminded him.</p>
<p>“There’s something really not right about him!” he argued heatedly.</p>
<p>Pansy shot Draco a wicked smile before she scoffed, arching a perfectly shaped eyebrow. “<em>Quality time</em> - he might has well just said what they’re really going to do. That he’s about to be balls deep-”</p>
<p>“Pansy,” Daphne quickly spoke over her, giving her girlfriend a pleading look and glancing at Draco, who had gone rigid in his seat, “No need to be so crude.”</p>
<p>Amanda the bartender suddenly came over to put the Firewhiskey shots in front of him with an alluring, lingering smile. Draco reached for them quickly, desperately needing something to do with his hands. Ethan was essentially the three things he wasn’t, and wanted to be: well-liked in the post-war Wizarding World, not an ex-Death eater, and a professional Quidditch player.</p>
<p>Bastard.</p>
<p>He grimaced, both at these thoughts and the aftertaste of the shots he had just taken. His head was starting to spin deliciously and he welcomed the feeling.</p>
<p>When he looked back over at his friends, he caught Daphne giving Pansy a reproachful look which somehow made him feel even worse. And then he eyed Amanda the bartender; how the sway of her hips was becoming more and more enticing the more shots he had taken and the more his head spun.</p>
<p>He needed a distraction, and to release some tension.</p>
