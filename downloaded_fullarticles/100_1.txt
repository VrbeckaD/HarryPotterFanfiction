          <div class="userstuff"><p>"So what did you have in mind, Granger?" The blond asked.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, Ron's brother George is getting married this weekend and I need a date, as I'm invited and still close with the rest of the family. I thought who would be the one date I could have that would completely make his blood boil over…" she trailed off. </p><p> </p><p>"And you decided on me. What's wrong, Krum wasn't available?" He chuckled.</p><p> </p><p>"You will make Ron crazy with jealousy. So what do you say?" She asked. </p><p> </p><p>Weighing his options while staring at the chestnut haired woman who sat with one ankle on top of  the other, leaning back so Draco could get a good view of the salaciously low neckline that her sundress boasted. </p><p> </p><p>Licking his lips, Draco smiled. The dress fit Granger perfectly. It was sleeveless, covered in cherries, and knee length.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm in. How long do you need my services?" </p><p>He asked. </p><p> </p><p>"The rehearsal is Friday, the wedding is Saturday, and the goodbye party is Sunday." </p><p> </p><p>"And what am I getting out of this?" </p><p> </p><p>Hermione smiled. Typical Draco, always a business man. </p><p> </p><p>"200 galleons, and a long running ad for Malfoy Industries in both my muggle periodical and the Daily Prophet."</p><p> </p><p>Draco sat back and steepled his fingers. </p><p> </p><p>"How long running?" </p><p> </p><p>"Two years," she replied. </p><p> </p><p>"You can do that?" He asked. </p><p> </p><p>A sly smile answered him. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm the editor of the Daily Prophet, of course I can." </p><p> </p><p>Leaning forward, he offered her his hand. Taking it, their eyes met. </p><p> </p><p>"Looks like we have a deal." </p><p> </p><p>Hermione nodded. </p><p> </p><p>"Looks like we do indeed." </p><p> </p><p>Six Days Later….</p><p> </p><p>Hermione waited patiently outside her Diagon Alley flat for her companion to arrive. When he did, he grabbed her suitcase, a silent offer to carry it. Handing him a golden pocket watch, they began to spin. </p><p> </p><p>Touching down again, Draco heard the loud shouts and cheers and jeers coming from a large, fabric white tent that had been raised beside the incredibly crooked house… if it could be called that. Turning to look at Hermione, she smiled, grabbed his hand, and dragged him into the festivities. </p><p> </p><p>When they entered the tent, Molly found Hermione right away and strode proudly over to her. </p><p> </p><p>"Hermione," she began, pulling the woman into a tight bear hug, "you made it! I'm so glad, Rosie is outside playing with Albus and James. You two will be sleeping in one of the accommodations Arthur conjured for all of our family and friends. Go on, just on the other side of the tent. I'm happy to see you both." </p><p> </p><p>Walking in the general direction that Molly had gestured, they were greeted by many people, Weasleys and otherwise. Ron had yet to appear. They made it out of the main event tent, and into the two story brick faced building with an orange shingled roof, that Molly had designated the 'Guest House'.
