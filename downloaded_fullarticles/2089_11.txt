Uncle Vernon had beaten him again. This one had been worse than normal. As he lay there his parents whispered to him. Despite what his aunt and uncle told him, his parents were not dead.</p><p>
  <em> “Harry, love. You must will yourself away now! The longer you stay, the worse it will get.” </em>
</p><p>
  <b>“Your mum, is right Harry, as always. Listen, your mum is always right. She will always be right. And when we don’t listen to her all shite breaks lose.”</b>
</p><p>
  <em> “Stop it, James. Sweetie you must will yourself away. Your magic will take you to where you need to be. Just think and wish to go to your Nana Shea and your Pappy Gregory. Though he will most likely want you to call him Pappy Greg. And your magic will take you.” </em>
</p><p>
  <u> <b> <em>“But …. How will they know that I am really me? And what Papa? And you and dad?”</em> </b> </u>
</p><p>
  <b>“Champ, we will be fine. When you get to Nana and Pappy, they can contact Sev, your papa, and you can break the spell. Then they can take you to the bank. Talk to Griphook, he can help you find us and break the spell the headmaster put on us.”</b>
</p><p>
  <em> “The goblins can also take off any and all bindings on your magic, as well as any other spells old dumbles placed on you. When you get to where your Grandparents are ask to speak with Royal Protection Master Gregory Sigurd and Royal Protection Mistress Shea Sigurd.” </em>
</p><p>
  <b>“Lils, we can’t forget the password. Harry, the password is: Danger await, Family comes first.”</b>
</p><p>
  <u> <b> <em>“Okay, I will try.”</em> </b> </u>
</p><p>
  <em> “Go now Harry! We love you and we will see you soon.” </em>
</p><p>
  <b>“Bye Son.”</b>
</p><p>With that Harry began to focus on his magic and his desire to be safe. He thought of what his mum said about her being adopted, and her birth parents. Harry closed his eyes and wished with all his might. Unbeknownst to Harry a golden light began to gather and swirl around him. Harry thought of his papa, whose memories were locked away to protect him, and the promise his mum and dad made, that his papa’s memories would return. As the light reached its full power, it sighed and whisked Harry away from the cupboard under the stairs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With a soft plop, Harry landed on cushion. The sound of people gasping, forced him to open his eyes. He was sitting on a couch, and in front to the left of him were an older woman and an older man, in front of him and to the right were a woman and man about Petunia and Vernon’s age. It took only a few seconds, but he recognized them. It was the Royal Family. Queen Elizabeth and her husband Prince Philip and their son and his wife Charles and Diana. Harry quickly jump down and knelt before his sovereigns.</p><p>“I am sorry your majesties, I did not mean to interrupt.” He said, still looking at the floor. The Queen moves unseen by Harry, to kneel before him.</p><p>“Child, it is alright. If I am not mistaken, you are one of the magical denizens of Europe. Can you tell me your name and how you came here?” She asked Harry lifted his eyes to meet hers.</p><p>“Mother, must you talk to him like that?” Charles asked</p><p>“Charles, you mother is trying to calm a frightened child, hold your tongue.”</p><p>“Yes, Father.”</p><p>Elizabeth took Harry’s hand and drew him to his feet. She then lead him to the couch where she and her husband were sitting. Harry took a deep breath.</p><p>“My name is Harry Potter, and my mum’s adopted sister, is very unkind to me, as I and my parents before me have magic. My Aunt believes my mum and dad to be dead. This however is untrue. They along with my papa created a spell that allows communication no matter the distance, between a magical parent and child. They cast the spell on themselves and me, because of the threat known as Voldemort. My papa however does not remember because mum and dad hide his memories, because he became the ministries spy. I willed myself away to find my grandparents, after my parents pushed heavily.”</p><p>The Royals faces softened, they knew of the war, the fact Harry’s parent were alive was a shock. Dumbledore had said that they were dead. The royals were not naïve by any means,  He was up to something. Diana, who had till this time remained silent spoke.</p><p>“Harry, who are your grandparents? If you tell us we can get in contact with them. And if you know your papa’s name we can find him as well.”</p><p>Harry took a deep breath.</p><p>“Mum and dad told me papa’s name is Severus Snape. And they told me to ask to speak with…” Here Harry paused, taking a deep breath.” Royal Protection Master Gregory Sigurd and Royal Protection Mistress Shea Sigurd. And to send for the goblin Griphook.”</p><p>Gasps were stifled in the room. Philip got up and went to the door and requested a messenger be sent to the heads of magical security. The other magical guard was sent to send the messages. Harry smiled, things were about to change.</p>
