Her eyes took in her surroundings as they adjusted to the lack of light. The dark mahogany walls were covered in dust and spider webs, the old floorboards creaking under her weight. As she reached the top of the stairs, she noticed a light coming through the crack of the door down the hall. Sophia strained to listen as the distinct sound of voices reached her. She quietly crept down the hall towards the door, staying near the shadows as she moved. </em><br/> <br/><em> "My lord perhaps if we were to do it without the boy and girl,” a man she instantly recognized as Peter Pettigrew said, his voice shaking as the man stood in front of the arm chair, cowering in fright. </em><br/> <br/><em> "NO, THE BOY AND GIRL ARE EVERYTHING. IT CAN NOT BE DONE WITHOUT THEM. AND IT WILL BE DONE AS EXACTLY HOW I SAID," a raspy voice said from the armchair. Sophia tried to get a look at who was sitting down but all she could see was a withered hand. A second person came into view kneeling beside the armchair. His dark black hair lay scraggly on his head, his face dark from the shadows in the room. </em><br/> <br/><em> "I will not disappoint you my lord," The young man said sharply. As Sophia kept listening, she felt something slither by her feet. She quickly covered her mouth, biting back a scream as the large snake slowly went past her and into the room. As the snake went into the room, she heard a strange hiss come from the snake and heard exactly what she was saying to her master. </em><br/> <br/><em> "Nagini tells me that we have a very special guest. The Potter girl is here," the voice from the armchair rasped. Peter moved to the door looking at Sophia as she stood frozen with fear. "Step aside Wormtail so I could give are guest a proper greeting." She stood frozen as Pettigrew moved to step out of the way. </em><br/> <br/><em> "AVADA KEDAVRA," and a green light filled the room. </em></p><p>Bolting up, Sophia gasped as her hand flew to her wand by the bedside table. She quickly surveyed the room, no longer finding herself in the dark, dilapidated home, but back in the burrow, in the room she shared with Ginny while staying over for the summer. Sighing in relief, her hand grazed at the scar on her forehead, a dull ache thriving once again. It always did when she had that particular dream. They had started a month ago, not only for her but her twin brother Harry as well. She tried not to let her mind stray to what it could imply, but the frequencies were starting to unnerve her.<br/> <br/> She looked at the clock on the wall, noting the time was 5:30 a.m. Knowing it was time to get up, she sluggishly pulled herself out of the warm bed and headed to the bathroom with her things. After a quick shower, she dressed in a pair of dark jeans, a maroon sweater, pulling on a pair of worn sneakers. She looked at her reflection in the mirror, noting the dark bags under her brown eyes. She quickly threw her red hair up into a ponytail and headed out and down the stairs, already smelling breakfast.<br/> <br/> "Good morning dear, did you have a good sleep?" Mrs. Weasley kindly asked as Sophia took a seat at the table with Ginny. "Oh yes I did Mrs. Weasley," She lied easily, a smile quickly gracing her features.<br/> <br/> "I can't believe we’re actually going to the quidditch cup today." Ginny bounced in her seat in excitement. The Quidditch World Cup had been all the talk since her and Harry had finally arrived late last night. When she received the letter from Ron that his dad had gotten tickets for the whole family, including herself, Harry and Hermione, she had nearly passed out. The entire month before they were to leave, Sophia couldn't contain her excitement, even when forced to by her aunt and uncle. She loved quidditch dearly, almost, if not more, than her brother.<br/> <br/> "I know what you mean Gin, Fred and I have a bet of 2 sickles. I'm betting on Bulgaria," Sophia said as she shoved a pile of eggs into her mouth.<br/> <br/> "Oy and mum calls us pigs." George said, taking a seat with Fred next to Sophia. Swallowing her food, she quickly stuck her tongue out as the fireplace erupted into bright green flames. Everyone turned and as they died down, Sophia quickly stood up and ran up, enveloping her best friend into a hug that was eagerly returned.<br/> <br/> "Hermione it's so good to see you. I've missed you all summer." Sophia pulled away as Hermione fully entered. "Where's Harry and Ron?" she questioned, noting the absence of two of her friends. "Still asleep most likely." Sophia said, sitting back down, quickly slapping Fred's hand away as he reached for a piece of her bacon.<br/> <br/> "Ouch love, weren't you taught to share." Fred said, his father laughing behind his cup of coffee.<br/> <br/> "I'll go wake them up," Hermione volunteered, setting down her bag by the others near the door.<br/> <br/> "Good luck. I tried and Ron nearly bit my head off." Ginny warned as Hermione made her way upstairs.<br/> <br/> About 20 minutes later, she noticed both Harry and Ron trudge down the stairs, both still trying to wake up. She noted the identical bags under her brother's eyes and when they saw each other, they shared a knowing nod.<br/> <br/> "Alright everyone. Hurry up and eat, we need to get going if we don't want to be late." Arthur said as he stood from the table. Everyone quickly dug into their breakfast, quickly polishing it off. After saying their goodbyes to Mrs. Weasley, everyone gathered their stuff and stated out of the house.</p><p>"I wonder what the big surprise is going to be at Hogwarts this year. I tried getting it out of Charlie but he wouldn't let it slip," Ron said as he caught up with Harry and Sophia.<br/> <br/> "I just hope we can have one normal year at Hogwarts this time." Harry replied, looking at his sister, who shook her head, agreeing. Hopefully they would get just that but knowing their luck and the strange dreams that haunted them, they had a small inkling it wouldn't.<br/> <br/> After meeting up with Amos Diggory and Cedric, the group finally reached a small hill. Sophia and Harry noticed as everyone crowded around an old boot on the ground each taking a hold of it. "Why are they all standing around that manky old boot?" Harry asked, slightly confused.<br/> <br/> "That isn't just some manky old boot mate-"George said, slapping Sophia and Harry on the shoulders as the twins moved past them.<br/> <br/> "-it's a port key." Fred finished as they too grabbed ahold of the boot. Both Harry and Sophia knelt down, still examining the boot. There was no possible way this was how they would be getting to the cup.<br/> <br/> Arthur noticed the two as Amos counted down. "Harry! Sophia grab hold,” Hee yelled and as the two grabbed hold, a scream tore out of Sophia's mouth as she felt a sensation around her navel pulling and in an instant they were gone.</p>
