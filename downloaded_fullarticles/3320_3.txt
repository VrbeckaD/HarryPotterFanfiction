    <p>Orion Rory Black woke up to his alarm on a hot summer morning and tried to think of a reason worth forcing himself out of bed to greet the day. He didn't sleep very well; being plagued with nightmares had that effect. Unpleasant reminders of the war he fought to end as quickly and with as few casualties as possible. He managed to kill Voldemort in May in the Ministry atrium, having lured him there with his own creation of visions of the prophecy they shared.  Thanks to a very good support system Orion managed to hold onto most of his family. They almost lost Sirius, but, thankfully, Remus was watching out for him.<br/>
Now peace reigned, and he didn’t have to fight anymore. He didn’t have to train until he was exhausted. He didn’t have to be hyper-vigilant anymore. He refused to help track down the escaped Death Eaters. “Let the Ministry do something for once.” He remembered Sirius had said. Hell, he didn’t even have to be Harry-Bloody-Potter anymore either, hence the name change. After the war, he sat for his exams and graduated from Hogwarts early. He moved away from England with Remus and Sirius to Northern Ireland where they lived in Black Manor.<br/>
During their self-imposed permanent vacation, Remus and Sirius officially Mated and received their marriage license and certificate. They even adopted Harry and changed his name to give him a clean slate. Actually, they adopted him twice. The goblins performed a blood adoption, which added the last two Marauders to his family tree and shared their magic with him. The side effects change his hair a bit from the fly away birds nest to gentle waves that curled around his ears and framed his face. His bright green eyes darkened to a bottle green and his golden skin paled to a peachy porcelain tone. He remained short at 5’3” and compact. He had tentatively started calling Remus dad and Sirius was papa. And they never even thought to mind.<br/>
After they moved to Ireland, Remus contacted the local werewolves, the Highlands Pack, to inform them of the new family moving nearby. They were hardly considered a threat, but it was considered respectful to the Alpha and his Pack’s territory. Many conversations occurred before the little family decided to perform a second adoption ritual. Under the light of a full moon, Orion laid bare on the forest floor curled up in a submissive ball with a large black Grimm curled around him from behind, lending his warmth. Remus, Moony in that moment, slowly approached the being he considered his child. He acknowledged his Mate with a lick to his muzzle before returning his attention to the pale and weak little cub. It didn’t meet his eyes, remaining submissive, but it shivered with either cold or nerves, he wasn’t sure. But it mattered little as he began licking the pup’s shoulder. After moment he suddenly bit down on the flesh until he tasted blood and heard the pup yelp in pain. He tried to make it quick and when he let go he returned to licking the fresh wound as the virus rushed through his veins. By morning it would be over, and he and his mate would have their pup.<br/>
Two months after that night and Orion had adjusted well to his wolf. He remained small and shy in nature, but he was happy, and he was coming out his shell bit by bit. He had dropped all pretenses that came with his old name and the fame attached to it. He was a new person and he was still discovering himself. He was still trying to adjust to the mentality that came with being an Omega. Apparently, his new position in the Pack came with a rush of new hormones that flooded his body and made his emotions a little unstable. But, the point was that he was happy with his family and he was happy being a werewolf. He wasn’t left behind on the full moon anymore and he was able to cuddle close to his parents without needing an excuse. </p>
<p>Today was another new day, within his new life with a clean slate. So, he yawned and stretched, pulled himself out of bed and climbed in the shower. He finally had clothes that fit him, but he still preferred to cover up as much as he could. He put on his blue jeans and slightly oversized long-sleeve shirt and a pair of socks just as his name was called.<br/>
“Orion!” Remus hollered up the stairs and through the manor. “Breakfast is ready!”<br/>
“Be right down!” He called back with a smile. It was nice to sit with his family at a meal rather than be the one to slave over it and then be shoved away from the room. He calmly padded down the hallways and as he got closer he could literally follow the scent of food.<br/>
He peeked into the kitchen and saw his papa sitting at the table, reading the news paper and nursing his coffee. Dad was manning the stove frying what smelled suspiciously like blueberry pancakes. Orion’s favorite. Dad’s cooking was the best, it made him feel warm and fuzzy inside. Papa couldn’t cook to save his life. He was a Master Ward Smith and invented new charms and improved wards. Dad was in the process of writing a series of charms and defensive magic texts. They both worked from home which was nice. Orion pulled himself away from the wall and took a seat opposite of Sirius just as Remus turned around with a serving plate pile high with the fluffy, fruity goodness that Orion loved.<br/>
Remus smiled at him and reached out to pet Orion’s hair. “Good morning, Pup. How did you sleep?”<br/>
Orion leaned into the touch and sighed. “Morning. I still had a few nightmares, but I slept ok. I almost didn’t want to get up.”<br/>
Sirius laid the paper down and began to serve himself breakfast. “There’s nothing wrong with sleeping in occasionally. I wish there was something that could help your nightmares, though.” They had learned the hard way that Orion was allergic to most sleep aide potions and the rest were highly addictive.<br/>
“It’s ok, honestly.” Orion said.<br/>
“I was going to ask how you were feeling lately. I know these last few weeks were quite the adjustment for your mind and body. You have been rather quiet and reclusive these past two days. Are you sure you’re feeling well?” Remus persisted, holding Orion’s chin in on hand and ran the fingers of his free hand through the inky black tresses as he examined his son’s features.<br/>
Orion’s dark eyes sparkled a little as he gave his dad a small smile. “I’m ok, Dadd..” He cut himself off with a hiccupping gasp and quickly reached for his glass covering it up by pretending to need a drink. ‘What was that?’ he thought.<br/>
Remus frowned, unsure whether to believe his pup, but he didn’t probe further. Their son may be acting strange but trying to force the issue would get them nowhere. Breakfast continued on a quiet note and afterwards the rest of the morning was sedate with Sirius retiring to his office and what few projects he had. Remus settled in the library to continue his writing. He expected Orion to either join him or head outside to soak in the sunshine that flooded the grounds.<br/>
Meanwhile, Orion was in his room, brooding on his almost slip up. He almost said Daddy. He wanted to say it do badly, but I he shouldn’t be saying something so childish. He was 16 for Merlin’s sake. He wasn’t a baby. Deep down, he knew he want to be. It sounded so nice to be small and helpless, no worries and responsibilities. Being doted on and constantly held. Growing up was scary and since he was eleven Orion was scared often and he didn’t like the pattern his life had taken on.<br/>
As his thoughts spiraled out of control his eyes glazed over and his thumb drifted to his mouth. Unconsciously sucking on the appendage only seem to further distress his confused mind. He needed comfort, but his young mind didn’t recognize his surroundings. However, his sensitive nose picked up the familiar scents of his parents, Pack.<br/>
He scooted to the edge of the bed and slipped off. When his feet touched the carpet, his knees wobbled and gave out from under him. He sat on the floor for a moment, looking around and scared. He wanted his daddy. He could smell daddy and papa close. Instead of trying to stand, he crawled to the cracked door and out into the hall. He didn’t see anyone out here, but he followed his nose to another door. It was easy to open it and crawl inside the bedroom he found. Still no daddy or papa. Maybe they were hiding? He went to the closet he only found clothes that smelled like his parents. Where were they? Did they leave him. He missed his daddy and papa.<br/>
He started crying as he pulled down clothes that felt familiar and smelled nice and curled up in the little pile. He pulled his thumb into his mouth again and cried himself to sleep.</p>
<p>Come the afternoon and Sirius was looking for his mate and pup. He found Remus in the solitude amongst the tomes and dust and snuck up behind to wrap his arms around his shoulders and startle him.<br/>
Remus jumped when he was wrenched out of his thoughts by wondering hands. “You startled me, you incorrigible mutt.”<br/>
Sirius chuckled in his mate’s ear. “Forgive me, luv. You are just too tempting for me to resist.” He kissed Remus’s neck and hugged him close. “Have you seen Orion? I’m worried he might be sinking into depression with as quiet as he has been.”<br/>
Remus once again frowned with worry. He seemed to be doing that a lot in relation to thoughts of their son. “I haven’t seen him since breakfast. I think there might be something wrong that he’s not willing to talk about. He’s been too submissive for my liking.  He seems to crave touch and then a second later he’s pushing it away, secluding himself away. I thought he might join me to read, but it’s been hours since I even heard him.”<br/>
“I don’t like this. He was always more outgoing and talkative. Now he’s so shy he even hides from us. If it’s really been that long since he ate, then we should find him, if only so we can get to eat some lunch. He’s already tiny, if he doesn’t eat then he’ll fade away”<br/>
“I’ll go check outside for him if you don’t mind checking his room.” Remus suggested as he stood from his chair. Sirius nodded and left the library in search of their hidden pup. Remus didn’t have to go so far. He only had to open the french doors to the attached balcony that overlooked the gardens and the small pond behind the manor. Orion usually like to linger amongst the various flora and fauna. But his first inspection of the gardens didn’t reveal his pup’s location.<br/>
“ORION!” His voice disturbed a few of the birds but he received no answer. That was odd, Orion always answered. “ORION!” Again, no answer. Remus went back inside and went to see if Sirius had any luck finding their pup.<br/>
Sirius was coming down the stairs to meet his mate at the bottom. Alone.<br/>
“Is Orion coming down?”<br/>
“I was going to ask you if you had seen him outside. He wasn’t in his room.” Sirius’s brow wrinkled with a frown to match his mate’s.<br/>
“He’s not outside. I hollered for him and there was no answer.”<br/>
“Are you sure? That’s not like him at all. Where could he be?”<br/>
“I don’t know and I’m starting to worry.”<br/>
“Alright. Let’s not panic just yet. It’s just like our hide and seek games on the full moon. I’ll shift and sniff him out. I doubt he went far.” Sirius pacified his mate before transforming into Padfoot. He immediately put his nose to the floor and started checking rooms, searching for where his pup’s scent was the strongest. His trail leads up the stairs and into Orion’s room, but he knew he wasn’t in there. Padfoot stopped in front of the door, spun in a circle twice, and was off down the hall again with Remus hot on his heels. Further down the family wing was His and Remus’s bedroom and it was wide open. Orion’s scent lead inside. Now why would he go in there?<br/>
Cautiously, he stepped into the room, but he found no obvious sign of his son. Then the scent changed. It was no longer simply Orion’s sweet scent. It was acrid with sadness and fear. Salt indicated tears. Then he smelled urine. The combination came from the closet. Sirius transformed again and went straight for the closet. It was already cracked open. And he could still smell urine from inside. Upon opening the door, both men gasped at what lay within.<br/>
There was Orion, lying curled in a tight ball, thumb in his mouth, snuggled into a pile of clothes. He was wet from the waist down, it had to be cold as he was starting to shiver, and his face was stained with tears and snot.<br/>
“Oh, Merlin! Orion!” Remus gasped. Hearing his name, Orion startled and looked up at his parents with glazed eyes. He pulled his thumb from his mouth and reached up and started crying. He didn’t stand or even try sitting up. He just laid there and cried.<br/>
Sirius was the first to move and immediately picked his son up off the floor, quickly noticing that he had to support Orion’s head for him and ran to the master bathroom. He set Orion down on the counter and started stripping him of his clothes. Remus noticed what his mate was trying to do and started the bath. Orion was still crying softly. He didn’t understand what was going on.<br/>
“Papa.” He sniffled.<br/>
Sirius’s heart broke. “It’s ok, Pup. What happened? Why were you in the closet?” He was trying to understand the situation.<br/>
Orion heard his Papa’s voice; but where was Daddy?<br/>
“Daddy!” He cried. The tears started anew, and his thumb was inserted to his mouth again.<br/>
Both men froze at that one word. Suddenly, they realized that their sixteen-year-old son was behaving like an infant! Remus’s eyes were flooding when he looked at Sirius only to see that he was looking just as shocked and heart-broken. What was wrong with Orion? They had to pull it together if they were going to figure this out.<br/>
Remus cleared his throat. “We need to get him cleaned up. Afterwards we should call the Highlands Pack to see if they can send a healer over.”<br/>
Sirius took a deep breath and nodded to his mate, but he didn’t speak. He finished undressing Orion and quickly set him in the tub to wash the smell off his skin. As he washed his son he heard Remus moving around and felt magic in the air behind him, doing who knows what. The job took some time since his son was of no help at all lying on his back and his limbs were heavy, but he seemed to like the soothing warmth of the bath. As he calmed down, Orion could begin to focus on the face above him.<br/>
“Papa!” He squeaked happily and splashed his hands in the water. He swished the foam around and reached for Sirius’s hand to play with his fingers.<br/>
“Yes, Pup. Papa’s got you. Daddy is here too.” Sirius whispered. “We’re going to get you cleaned up and then we’ll figure out what’s happened to you.” Orion only giggled and waved a hand at his papa’s face.<br/>
“Is he all clean? I have clothes for him.” Remus leaned over Sirius’s shoulder, peering into the tub. Orion looked up and smiled.<br/>
“Daddy! Up, up!” Orion squealed and reached his arm up, demanding to be picked up.<br/>
Remus gave his mate a watery smile then he waved his wand over Orion and cast a temporary feather light charm. He picked up his son and bundle him in a towel as he babbled happily around the thumb in his mouth. “Oh, sweetheart. What happened to you? You were fine just this morning. Is this a hex or something? Or does this have something to do with your wolf?” Remus laid his son on the bed and cast a drying and warming charm that left his hair a little fluffy.<br/>
“Is this really necessary?” Sirius asked holding up the diaper that Remus had an elf fetch for him. He frowned at his mate with a bit of fear in his eyes.<br/>
“For now, yes.” Remus took the diaper and began the process of padding his pup. After the cream and powder, he was buttoned up and wrestled into a onesie and footie pajamas. “Remember the mess we found him in? He incontinent for the time being and until we have some answers I don’t feel up to cleaning up a mess every ten minutes. I know it seems like overkill but what other option is there? He can’t tell us what happened or why he’s acting this way. We can only react and love him.”<br/>
Sirius sighed deeply. “You’re right. I know that. I’m just scared for him. He’s sixteen and should be having fun now that the weight of the world isn’t crushing him. But he never seemed to know how to do that. Maybe this is a result of his lack of a proper childhood. I never noticed the signs, if there were any. Is this our fault for not seeing something that he needed?” Sirius sat on the bed, cradling his head in his hands.<br/>
Remus hugged his mate, tears in his eyes, feeling just as scared for their innocent pup. “Don’t say that. This can’t be completely our fault. We didn’t know this would happen. We need to call the Highlands Alpha and get some advice and maybe some answers.”<br/>
“Alright.” Sirius sniffed and squared his shoulders. “I’ll make the call while you keep Orion content.”<br/>
“Alright, Luv.” Remus kissed his mate before he left the room. He looked down at Orion, smiling around his thumb and patting the bed with his left hand. He kicked his feet a bit too. He seemed excited for some reason.<br/>
“Come here, Pup. Let’s go calm down a bit until Papa gets back.” Remus cooed at the boy on the bed.<br/>
“Daddy.”<br/>
“Yes, Puppy. Daddy is going to make sure you’re happy as can be.” Remus found himself wonder down the hall to a nearly forgotten room of the manor. It was a nursery meant for infants of the family until they outgrew the room and moved out making room for the next generation. Remus never thought they would ever have need of the room but had told the elves to preserve it. Now he was headed there for the purpose of comforting his teenage son. “Dobby. Winky.” He called gently.<br/>
The two elves popped in front of him and were immediately confused. “Master Moony called?” Said Dobby.<br/>
“Yes. I need you both to open the nursery for me. For reasons unknown, Orion is in need of the room. I need the rocking chair, changing table and crib enlarged and reinforced. Fresh linens and new accessories. Winky, I may need a bottle soon. Please make sure it has a formula specified to Orion’s nutritional needs. I fear we may be living this way for a while, so Orion is going to need a lot of new things.”<br/>
Dobby and Winky exchanged a worried look. Then their resolve hardened. They both saluted Remus. “Yes, Master Moony. Only the best care for the Little Master. Winky will get bottles, clothes, diapers and other accessories. Dobby will take care of nursery and furniture.” Dobby said with all the seriousness he could muster.<br/>
“Thank you.” Remus smiled sadly. He continued walking at a sedate pace as he stared down at Orion. His dark green eyes sparkling as he stared around the corridor. He could hardly imagine what was going through his puppy’s mind. Was he scared? Was he trapped inside his own mind? The very thought saddened Remus.<br/>
When he reached their destination, he found the white door already opened for him. The cream carpet was soft and matched the light blue paint on the walls perfectly. The furniture was all done in white to match the trim and crown moldings around the room and they had been enlarged like he asked. Everything was perfect. Gods, he loved house elf magic. Dobby stood by the rocking chair, awaiting his next orders.<br/>
“Thank you, Dobby. It’s perfect. If we need anything changed later, I’ll let you know. Would you mind informing Sirius where we are? He may be bringing guests with him as well.”<br/>
“Yes, Master Moony. I will do that now.” Dobby said and popped away.<br/>
Remus sighed as he sat down in the rocker. It even had cushioning charms on it. He loved house elves. He settled in to wait for Sirius and Orion’s bottle, which ever showed up first. As he rocked, he watched Orion. The effect was instant. He looked up at Remus with wonder and a smile. Apparently, Daddy knew what he was doing, so far.<br/>
Winky popped into the room, bottle in hand. “For Little Master, good for the tummy and just warm enough. I have a new pacifier too, just in case.”<br/>
“Thank you, Winky. I really appreciate this.” Remus said as he took the items.<br/>
“A pleasure, Master Moony. We is always loyal to Little Master and his family.” Winky curtsied and then popped away again.<br/>
“Is my puppy hungry?” Remus said to the little boy in his arms. “I have something for you to try. Let’s see how you like warm puppy milk.” He cooed as he pulled the thumb from Orion’s mouth. His lip wobbled, and he almost cried at having his new favorite thing taken away. That is until Remus rubbed his lips with the nipple of the bottle. Orion got the hint and latched on quickly, instantly enjoying the warm, sweet milk. He wrapped one hand around the bottle over Remus’s hand and the other grabbed Remus’s shirt.<br/>
“I think that’s a win for the milk. Does my sweet puppy like that?” Remus whispered and leaned down to kiss Orion’s hair.<br/>
Cradled in his Daddy’s arms, safe and warm. Yummy milk filling his belly. Rocking back and forth. The winning combination was lulling Orion into a content sleep. Which had to be when the duo gained an audience.<br/>
Sirius came rushing down the hall, his long hair flying behind him. He froze in the door frame when he saw the bittersweet scene before him. His poor heart gave a sad throb when he saw how content and happy his son was. He slowly walked toward the rocking chair, not wanting to startle his family.<br/>
“Luv, we have some guests waiting downstairs. I didn’t want to bring them up here and make you or Orion feel cornered.” Sirius whispered to his mate.<br/>
Remus nodded. “Alright, thanks for that. Would you just look at him? He’s so happy in this simplicity. Just a bottle, a warm hug and a rocking chair and he’s ready to fall asleep. It’s amazing!”<br/>
“I may be scared for what fate might have planned for our pup, but I’ll admit that he’s rather precious like this.” Sirius smiled. “Come on. We need some answers if we’re going to know how to proceed.” He said as he helped Remus stand.<br/>
Orion noticed the change and he noticed his Papa was there too. Life was perfect. He felt his Daddy moving as he walked but the bottle never left, and Papa was petting his hair now. This was nice. He was almost asleep when his sensitive nose picked up something that wasn’t Pack. It smelled like gun metal oil and pinewood. He never smelled that before. If it wasn’t Pack then it wasn’t family. It wasn’t safe. He fought sleep so that he could see what that smell was.</p>
<p>Remus noticed Orion fussing drowsily, but he didn’t have a chance to find out what was wrong. They had reached the Parlor and were greeting their guests. The Highlands Pack healer was there. She was a short woman with black hair and a round, kind face and a gentle nature that went by Chandra. The surprise was Alpha Ricard. Tall, muscular and imposing with a chiseled jaw and hard blue eyes. He wore his dark brown hair long and in a thick braid. Both of them were dressed in hand made animal skin clothing that seemed soft with fur lining. Overall, their appearances were very wild and intimidating.<br/>
With other wolves in the room and one of them an Alpha, Remus was wary but relaxed. He invited them into his home and the occasion called for a certain level of respect from all parties. Orion normally would have been the same way, if more than a bit shy. But now he was scared. He smelled the sweet peppermint of Chandra, but Ricard’s scent nearly overpowered her. Orion turned in Remus’s arms, hiding his face and burying his nose in his Daddy’s calming lavender and chamomile scent as he started to cry.<br/>
“Alpha Ricard.” Sirius bowed his head in respect to the Alpha. “Healer Chandra. Thank you both for coming on such short notice.”<br/>
“It was no inconvenience, Mister Black.” Ricard said. “When you mentioned your cub was in crisis, we wanted to see how we could possibly help. Cubs are precious to us. Even one not belonging to our Pack.”<br/>
“What seems to be the problem?” Chandra asked.<br/>
“Our son, Orion, has been exhibiting extremely submissive behavior since we performed the adoption ceremony almost two months ago. His turning appeared normal and he had adjusted to life on four paws quickly. However, since his first moon he has clung to Remus and myself and often hides. At sixteen, he should be more outgoing and exploring his surroundings. We have had to remind him to eat on many occasions, such as today. We noticed that he hadn’t eaten since breakfast and when we went looking in his usual favorite areas we could find him.” Sirius had to take a deep breath. Looking over to his mate as he tried to soothe their anxious pup made his chest constrict.<br/>
“Since I am a dog Animagus, I was able to shift in order to track Orion by his scent. We play hide and seek on the full moon, so we thought he had hidden and fell asleep in his spot. We found him curled up in our bedroom closet, in a pile of clothes. He had been crying, he soiled himself and he smelled of sadness and fear. He woke up and his eyes were unfocused and glazed. He could only say ‘Daddy’ and ‘Papa’. He reached up as if demanding to be picked up. When I did so, he couldn’t support his own head. Since then he hasn’t said anything and has remained in an infantile headspace while we bathed and diapered him.”<br/>
“Oh my.” Chandra had a hand over her lips. Ricard had a very concentrated look on his face.<br/>
“I was nervous about feeding him solid foods.” Remus added to the conversation. “I thought he might choke, so I had one of our elves get me a bottle with extra nutrient rich formula. He had drunk it while we waited for your arrival. I had the elves open up the old nursery so that I could rock him. I can’t get over how infant-like he is right now. We adopted him so that we could give him a loving home and a safe environment to explore and find himself as he grew more confident after the life he has had. Now it seems like he has done the reverse. For two months we have watched him become sheltered and painfully shy. Now he has regressed to full dependency.” He said as a small tear ran down his cheek.<br/>
Orion only looked up at his daddy, sucking nervously on the pacifier given to him to soothe his cries. He clung to Remus shirt tightly, shivering, and still whimpering. He could feel his papa’s hand petting his hair, but it wasn’t helping him.<br/>
Chandra and Ricard sat on the opposite sofa from the small family, shocked to their cores.<br/>
“I must admit, gentlemen, I have never heard of such an unusual case. I want to help, of course, but I’m afraid all I can do is give him a basic check up for health purposes.” Chandra sounded as lost as the parents.<br/>
“A check up wouldn’t be amiss, Chandra.” Ricard said. “But I do have some experience in this area.”<br/>
“You do?” Chandra said, shocked.<br/>
“It was a long time ago, but yes, I do understand what has happened here.” He said nodding sadly.<br/>
“Anything you can tell us would be a great help. Please, Alpha.” Sirius wasn’t begging, yet. But he wasn’t beyond it either.<br/>
“Tell me about your cub. You said you adopted him and briefly mentioned his life previous to your involvement.”<br/>
“We have known him all his life.” Remus said, petting Orion as he spoke. “We were best friends with his parents, so when they died we naturally wanted to take him sooner, but the world had other plans for him. You see, he was born Harry James Potter. We changed he name to Orion Rory Black to give him a chance at a clean slate and a new start. After his parents’ deaths he lived with his mother’s muggle aunt and her family where he was abused and even starved to the point that it stunted his growth and immune system. We would have gotten him out of there, but we didn’t know where he was. We didn’t find him until he was thirteen when I became a teacher at Hogwarts. Sirius had just escaped Azkaban and followed him to the school. We watched him separately and after a year of drama and death defying stunts, we vowed to watch him more closely. We couldn’t adopt him officially until January. Voldemort was defeated in May. On the May moon we performed the lycan adoption ritual. And he has been slowly declining since then. I don’t always remember the full moon nights, but I do remember thinking that the naked human lying on the forest floor looked so small and weak. But he was mine. My cub.”<br/>
Orion open his mouth to yawn, losing the pacifier. “Daddy.” He whimpered quietly.<br/>
“Shush, puppy. You’re okay, Daddy’s got you. There’s no reason to be scared.”<br/>
“I see, now.” Ricard nodded in understanding. “Your cub has lived a hard life. His childhood was stressful and traumatic. It is likely he never had a true nurturing presence in his life after his mother and father died. When he was turned he became an Omega. Normally Omegas are the nurturers of the pack. But when Omegas like Orion experience a mental and sometime a physical trauma they can shift in the opposite direction, where the effected omegas require to be nurtured themselves. They become dependent on the pack for care and affection. Some have mentally regressed to a time when their lives were simple and happy. Mentally, Orion has probably regressed to an age before his parents died.”<br/>
“But they died when he was fifteen months old!” Sirius gasped.<br/>
“And he’s acting younger than that.” Remus added.<br/>
“I don’t know why he has regressed so young. Only the probable reason.” Ricard shook his head. “All you can really do now is continue as you have begun. Treat him as an infant, providing him with affection and care as you already have. You expressed a desire to give him a clean slate and this situation, although heartbreaking when you consider his age and coordinating milestones, could be his chance for a happy childhood. I don’t know if he will ‘grow’ out of it or not though. I’m sorry I don’t have a better prognosis for you gentlemen. I would, however, like to extend the support of my pack and our resources to aid the young cub.”<br/>
Remus could only cuddle Orion as he silently cried for his poor puppy. They couldn’t really help, just simply support the family in their time of crisis. For that’s what this was; a crisis. Orion should be a happy, thriving sixteen-year-old preparing for adulthood. Apparently he was too damaged for that opportunity.<br/>
Sirius was just as filled with disappointment. He always felt that if he could have escaped that prison sooner, found Orion faster, maybe he could have saved his son sooner than they did. At one time he thought about steeling Orion away from the wizarding world and moving overseas. But he knew that the war would still find Orion no matter how far they ran. It was smarter to end the war quickly and then take a permanent vacation. But at what cost? Orion may have been physically in one piece when the dust settled, but his mind seemed to have fractured in order to give himself a reprieve from the stressors of life.<br/>
“Thank you, Alpha Ricard. We appreciate the sentiment. Thank you for coming to talk to us and offering what knowledge you could. I admit, I wish you had better news, but I suppose we can live with this. We still have our son, but we get to give him the happy childhood he deserves and perhaps help him to heal from his past as well.” Sirius said sadly as he reached out to shake the Alpha’s hand.<br/>
Ricard shook the hand offered. “No thanks are necessary. I came to help your son any way I could, and though I feel I fell short of that goal, I mean what I said, Mister Black. It’s not an empty placation. You have the support of the Highlands Pack.”<br/>
Chandra stood and moved to Remus’s side and placed a hand on his arm. “Mister Black, I’m sorry that I can only offer my medical expertise and my listening ear to you. But you have them freely. Would you allow me to examine your son for you so that you have a better understanding of his health?”<br/>
“Yes, please.” Remus sniffed. “Thank you, Miss Chandra. I admit that I worry constantly about Orion’s health.”<br/>
“You can just call my Chandra, Hun. Don’t worry, you don’t have to put him down. I’ll just run a few simple test charms.” She flicked a thin wand over Orion and a few green colored sparks lit the tip of her wand, then Orion’s turned a light shade of yellow and then a piece of parchment appeared in thin air with what seemed to be the results on it. Chandra read it quickly humming to herself. “Well, he is definitely underweight, by about thirty pounds. He’s a bit anemic, but that can be treated with a supplemented diet. I did get a summarized version his medical history, but nothing appears to be presently troubling him.”<br/>
“I can easily modify his diet to include supplements. I always knew he was too light, but I never imagined it was thirty pounds.” Remus rocked Orion back and forth. “Oh, my sweet puppy. We got a long road ahead, don’t we?”<br/>
Orion only looked from Remus to Chandra and back again with sleepy eyes.<br/>
“He’s a beautiful boy.” Chandra cooed. “Ricard, come here and meet this sweet boy.”<br/>
Ricard smiled and slowly approached to get a closer look at the cub. When he was in view, Orion’s gaze turned to look at the new face. Those dark green eyes peered into blue seemingly read the man’s soul. Suddenly he reached out a hand for the man. Ricard was surprised at the cub’s forwardness, but he met his hand halfway and grasped it lightly. He felt the wild magic under tender skin and the acceptance that came with pure innocence. Ricard smiled down at Orion when the boy mock growled lightly, causing everyone to laugh.<br/>
“Brave little cub, challenging an Alpha.” Ricard chuckled. He looked to Remus for a moment. “May I?”<br/>
Remus nodded and passed his pup to the other wolf to hold.<br/>
Ricard cradled Orion to his chest with one strong arm and let him play with his other hand. “Oh my, aren’t you just too cute for your own good.” The Alpha said. “I bet you have your daddies wrapped around your finger in no time.”<br/>
Orion spat out the pacifier in order to babble content nonsense to the big wolf. He was bigger than Papa. Now that he had gotten comfortable around this new scent, he liked it. He wanted to tell him so. It was a lot of babbling mixed with growls, but it seemed to get his point across since the big wolf smiled at him. Ricard listened to the little cub practice his lycan vocalizing with adoration. He responded much the same, but he simply started a low growl that rumbled deep in chest. Orion squeaked and squealed happily as he felt the vibrations surround him.<br/>
“I think Orion made a friend.” Sirius said from where he stood holding Remus to his side.<br/>
“He seems to really like Ricard. Most of the pack cubs like him well enough, but he rarely spends on-on-one time with them.” Chandra said, smiling at the picture of the big Alpha holding the small teenager in his arms like an infant. It was a bit surreal.<br/>
“He’s so light.” Ricard marveled at the boys’ size. “You said he was sixteen, but he could pass for a twelve-year-old.”<br/>
“We know.” Sirius nodded sadly. “It’s been one of our main concerns since we found him over three years ago.”<br/>
“He suffered at the hands of his muggle relatives from a young age. One of their favorite punishments was refusing him food. The starvation shrunk his stomach over time to the extent that he’s lucky if he can finish a quarter of a regular plate.” Remus explained. “Maybe those supplement bottle will help him.”<br/>
“Poor little cub,” Ricard cooed at Orion. “You’re so small. We must feed you more to build your strength if you’re going to run with the pack.” Smiling, Ricard looked to the parents again. “He’s going to need high calorie, high protein foods. If you’re worried about choking just smash everything to a baby food consistency. He’s going to need more than milk and formula.”<br/>
“Oh, yes. Absolutely. If you like, I can write a list of suggested foods and even some herbs that can improve his appetite.” Chandra interjected.<br/>
“We’d appreciate that. Thank you.” Remus said. He was watching Orion interact with the larger werewolf as if he’d known him forever. It was quite adorable.<br/>
Orion was loving the attention of the big wolf. He had nice eyes and a soft voice. He held Orion so safe in his big arms as he swayed from side to side. He was getting sleepy. His eyes were almost closed when he started to feel wet and yucky. He didn’t like it and he wanted the feeling gone. He started to whimper and fuss.<br/>
“Oh, what’s wrong, little one?” Ricard asked the cub. His nose picked up the smell of a soiled diaper. “Are you feeling yucky? I think someone needs a change.”<br/>
Remus stepped up to take Orion back. “Come to daddy, puppy. I’ll take care of it.” Orion curled into Remus’s neck, sniffling in discomfort. “I’ll take him back upstairs. I might lay him down after his change.”<br/>
Sirius nodded. “He might be due a nap by now. Go ahead, Luv. We’ll finish down here soon.” He kissed his mate and then his son.<br/>
Ricard noticed that Sirius was still floating in a cloud of misery. “Are you going to be alright, Mister Black?”<br/>
“I will be. This has thrown me, us, for a loop. This wasn’t what we had in mind for Orion. But I suppose we can only move forward and continue to give him the love he deserves. It never occurred to me to stop doing that, but I never thought we would go back to changing diapers.”<br/>
“I understand.” Ricard nodded as he laid hand on Sirius’s shoulder in support. “Please don’t hesitate to call us even if it’s just to talk.”<br/>
“Thank you. It means a lot to know we have a life line should we need it. We are used to flying by the seat of our pants”<br/>
“Since this was the first he showed signs of regressing, I don’t suppose you know of any uncharacteristic behavior during the full moon. Has he shown any signs of being rather young as a wolf?”<br/>
Sirius looked away from the Alpha as he thought back to those recent jaunts under the moon. “I don’t believe he has acted younger, but he has been very effected by anxiety and fear. Every moon since we adopted him we have taken him out into the forest to a clearing for the transformation. We refuse to lock him up. We warded the area to contain werewolves without harm. There is a small creek and lots of hiding places for small animals, plenty of space for him to run. But he doesn’t run like a rambunctious pup. I’ll change first and curl up around Orion as he, and Remus, changes. He’s still small as a wolf and he’s completely black and fluffy. After the change he is always overwhelmed by his senses. After his first moon he has taken to not opening his eyes until he calms down. He will change and then crawl into a hallow log to hide for at least twenty minutes.” Sirius dropped his head in hands. “He scared Remus and I when he did that. We thought something was wrong with him. He just hides until his eyes and ears adjust. When he comes out he sticks close to us. The last time we were out there he was laid curled up to Remus’s side when Remus stood up too quick. Orion didn’t get up with him. He tucked himself into a small ball and tried to hide in the grass like a fawn. He was so scared. We didn’t notice for a few minutes, we had walked to the creek to drink. Usually Orion is right there, sometimes directly underneath us. We lost him for a few minutes because he thought Remus stood to face a threat that Orion couldn’t see. And when I left too he stayed down to hide. We ran back to where we last saw him and found him, as I said, curled up and scared. Remus laid back down and licked him to comfort him. He only tucked into Remus tighter and hid his face against his belly, panting and shivering. I have never seen him so scared before.”<br/>
“What happened when the moon went down?” Ricard asked quietly.<br/>
“He slept through the change like Remus did. When he woke up, he was a bit delirious. He was crying and muttering ‘don’t leave me’ over and over. I think he thought we had left to fight something and we weren’t coming back.” Sirius’s voice was thick with emotion and his eyes were wet.<br/>
“That settles it.” Ricard declared. “I want to see Orion on a full moon. I want to observe his behavior. I was going to invite your family to run with my pack. But I won’t do that yet. It might overwhelm Orion if we jump to that step. I want see him in his environment first.”<br/>
“I’ll talk to Remus about it since he runs the show on the full moon. I don’t think there will be a problem, but I need to explain to him why we are doing this. He may not remember every detail from that night, so I may have to refresh his memory.”<br/>
“There’s time. The full moon is still a week away. Until then, we will leave you to talk and settle into a new routine with your son. I hope to see you all soon.”<br/>
“Please call if you need us, Mister Black. I’m afraid we have been charmed by that sweet puppy of yours.” Chandra said.<br/>
“I will. Thank you, for everything.”<br/>
“You are very welcome. Good evening to you and your family.” Ricard said as he pulled the other man in for a hug, scenting him as a friend.<br/>
“Good evening to you both.”</p>
<p>When both wolves had left via floo, Sirius closed his eyes and turned his head skyward. His shoulders dropped helplessly, and his breath rushed out in a load puff. He knows he needs to have a discussion with Remus and it may just wrench his heart out his chest to have to relive that night, seeing their pup helpless and scared of being abandoned. But, as a father, he will do everything in his power to help his son, even enlist the help of other wolves. Remus may not like other wolves intruding on his territory, but he will agree, for Orion.<br/>
Sirius wiped his eyes and headed up the stairs to tend to his family and to smother himself in his mate’s arms. Their talk could wait till morning.</p>
