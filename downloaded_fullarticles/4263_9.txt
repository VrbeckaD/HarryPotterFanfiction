</blockquote><p> </p><p align="center">Snape looked at the chaos with teary eyes. "Lily is dead. Potter is dead." He said completely monotone. He was dead. When Lily had died so had a part of him.</p><p>"And the girl?" Dumbledore asked. Putting a hand on his Snapes shoulder attempting to comfort him. Snape just shrugged him off. </p><p>Snape hesistated."Dead as well. I have to assume the ashes in the crib are hers. The boy's are alive and well though."</p><p>Dumbledore frowned. "This is a tradegey. Go home Severus. I'll take care of everything else. Go home and mourn."</p><p>Mourn? I don't have time to mourn. I need to think...None of this is making sense."</p><p>I understand Dumbledore. I will...I just need a few minutes alone first." Dumbledore nodded. "I understand. I will leave you be." He looked at Snape with utter pity before apparating away.</p><p>Immediately Snape looked around and quick moved towards the closet and picked up what seemed a baby girl. He rocked her as the tears fell down his face. "Sirietta Severa Lily Remera Potter." Snape whispered.</p><p>The little girl, Harry's twin, now had a scar on her arm. A lightening bolt, and her eyes now red. Her green emerald eyes were now a blood red. Her hair was still black but streaked red. Was this an affect of surviving the Avada Kedavra? But Harry Potter was fine. I'll have to watch her myself. Dumbledore is insane if he thinks I don't know what he's doing. I'm going to protect this girl for Lily, and by protecting her it will he protecting Harry and Alphard. I couldn't hide all three of them but at least I was able to protect one. Snape than apparated to his home. This was going to be complicated.</p><p>He didn't think things through. What was he thinking? Taking his god-daughter so recklessly? He didn't know how to take care of a baby, nor did he know how he would keep her existence hidden. First thing first he would have to create a baby's room. He'd only transfigure a crib for now and then go out in disguise and get some basic things. He walked into an empty room and transfigured a desk into a crib. Sirietta, was still a sleep. She was the youngest of her siblings. Harry Potter was the oldest, the one who Voldemort attempted to kill also. Alphard wasn't attacked at all. It was a strange pattern, also impossible to discover if Sirietta or Harry was attacked first.</p><p>Though from how the cribs were ordered he'd assume Harry, he was the closest to the door. As he put the sleeping child down, and put his ward to keep out anyone who means harm or Ill content. He apparated to a muggle baby store. He quickly grabbed all he thought he would need. I still don't get it. Sirius nor Peter was the secret keeper.</p><p>So why is black going to jail for murder and why is Peter dead? None of this adding up, and the only ones with answers is dead. I'll need to do my own investigation. He then apparated back to his home. The girl, Sirietta was still asleep. She looked similar to James, but something was off. She looked nothing like Lily yet he knew this was Lily's child.</p><p>The child looked like someone else, and he just wasn't sure who. She was familiar though. Very familiar. Snape didn't know how he would explain that her mother and father was dead and she wasn't allowed to know her brothers. He wasn't sure how to raise her so that he could make Lily proud. He wasn't even sure what was going on, but that didn't matter. He looked at this girl and saw purity, innocence, he saw a huge future for her.</p><p>He would protect this girl. He had to.</p>
