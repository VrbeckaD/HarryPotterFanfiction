    <p>The dorm room was filled with residual energy from the Hogsmeade outing, energy that Harry obviously couldn't share. He was torn between listening in and going along with everyone else's cheer and having a sulk. In the end, he settled halfway in between. If he sulked, he'd just end up thinking about the Dursleys not signing his form and nothing good would come of that. He knew he'd be out of sorts all night and into the next day. But he couldn't quite join in either.</p><p>“Trade you that licorice wand for a monster crunchie,” Seamus said to Ron, who was hoarding his small mound of sweets bought with what few sickles he had.</p><p>Ron looked suspicious, but he made the trade, shoving the crunchie in his mouth in one go and grinning.</p><p>“You can have one of my frogs,” Neville said, offering Harry a chocolate frog that was desperately trying to escape from its wrapping.</p><p>“Cheers,” Harry said, trying to sound grateful and not at all bitter.</p><p>Dean and Seamus were apparently arguing over whether a woman they had seen in the village was actually a player for the Harpies.</p><p>“It was her, I swear,” Seamus insisted. “I'd know that bum anywhere.”</p><p>Dean and Ron burst out laughing. “You tosser,” Ron said.</p><p>“Literally!” Dean said. “He's got her picture in his quidditch scrapbook.”</p><p>“I've got all the Harpies, you git. Team of all fit birds.”</p><p>“Not Sprottle,” Ron said, making a face.</p><p>“Oh what do you know?” Seamus said. “You'd like to have it off with the old lady who runs the pub.”</p><p>“Madam Rosmerta?” Neville asked, giggling.</p><p>“Oi,” Ron said. “She's… Well… she's…” He blushed furiously red, his color going brighter than his hair.</p><p>“She's got giant tits,” Dean offered.</p><p>“Huge bum,” Seamus said.</p><p>“Is that your type, Ron?” Neville asked, with a small but sly grin.</p><p>Harry slowly chewed the last of his chocolate frog and tried not to look put off by this whole conversation. It wasn't that he didn't think sex was interesting, it was just that everyone had come back after the summer seeming so much worldlier than him about it all. It was like they all knew exactly what they were talking about.</p><p>“What about you, Harry?” Seamus asked.</p><p>“Huh?” Harry dropped the chocolate frog card he had been fiddling with.</p><p>“Who do you think about when you spank the one-eyed snake?”</p><p>“Er… I can talk to snakes,” Harry said.</p><p>Everyone burst into rollicking laughter. Ron's chuckles were so intense that he flopped over on his bed. Harry, knowing it was the only way to deal with moments like these, also started laughing, as if he had made an absurd joke when in reality he had no idea what anyone was even talking about half the time.</p><p>Not too much later, one of the fifth year prefects poked his head into their dorm and told them all to go to sleep and everyone settled down, pulling their curtains and climbing into their beds.</p><p>It was not too much later that Harry heard a rustling at the foot of his bed. He wasn't tired yet and had been reading his quidditch book again by the light of his wand. When he pulled the curtains back, Neville was standing there, looking unsure, clutching a large, red book.</p><p>“Can I…?” he whispered, gesturing up to Harry's bed.</p><p>Harry nodded. The bed dipped slightly as Neville climbed up, letting the curtains fall back behind him. He was in his pyjamas and his weight made the bed feel slightly uneven. His face looked slightly red and embarrassed. “Can you do a silencing charm?” he asked. “Mine don't work very well.”</p><p>Harry nodded and waved his wand at the curtains, spelling them to block their noise. His muffliato usually worked.</p><p>“What's up, Neville?” he asked.</p><p>“I… er...” Neville looked down at the book in his hands. “I was just remembering that you, well, that the muggles you live with aren't always that nice.”</p><p>Harry grimaced.</p><p>“I just mean,” Neville said, looking at him earnestly, “maybe they didn't do such a good job telling you about bodies and sex and stuff.” The rosy glow of his cheeks intensified in the wandlight.</p><p>When Harry grimaced again, feeling his face turn defensive, Neville added quickly, “My gran was complete bollocks at that too. Probably for different reasons. I mean, she's rather old. She has different attitudes about it all, I think.”</p><p>“Oh,” Harry said, forcing himself not to feel so defensive. It wasn't Neville's fault if he couldn't go to Hogsmeade and didn't know what half the things everyone said these days was really all about. “How did you learn about it, then?” He tried to make his voice sound casual, as if this was about Neville and nothing to do with him.</p><p>“Healers,” Neville said with a little smile. “Since I'm around them a lot...” He trailed off. “Just, er, family stuff. Anyway, I know a bunch of them. My friend Althea, she, er, saw that my gran was maybe not teaching me much about that stuff. And she talked to me a bit. Althea is… she's aces. She's my favorite grown up.”</p><p>“Oh,” Harry said. He tried to sound nonchalant, like he didn't care what Neville had to say, but in reality there was some part of him that was screaming with excitement, that maybe Neville had come to let him in on some secret that everyone else seemed to have discovered over the summer about sex but that had eluded him. He had thought a few times about asking Ron what some things meant, but Ron, with so many older brothers, was obviously swimming in knowledge. He thought Hermione, being raised by muggles like him and being so much more straightforward about things, would probably be a better person to ask, but she was a girl. Surely that wasn't on.</p><p>“Anyway, I thought, tonight, that maybe you, er, would like to borrow this.” Neville held out the oversized red book.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Neville pulled out his wand and tapped the book. “Revelio,” he said. The book went from plain and slightly tattered, with a rubbed out title to slowly turning blue, with a shiny title emblazoned across the top reading, <em>The Young Wizard's Guide to Growing Up.</em> “It's all about bodies and sex and all that,” Neville said. “Althea gave it to me before I came to Hogwarts.”</p><p>“Oh.” Harry looked at the book, wanting very much to open it up but still feeling a little bit like this whole conversation was about to be yet another joke on him.</p><p>“It has a whole page with all the silly things people call fannies and cocks and another with all the funny names for wanking,” Neville said. “That's what Seamus was asking you before. Spank the snake or whatever he said. He meant tossing off.”</p><p>Harry nodded. He knew what that meant, sort of. He reached toward the book, but he still didn't open it.</p><p>“You know what that means though, right?” Neville said.</p><p>“Of course,” Harry said confidently.</p><p>“It's okay if you don't,” Neville said. “I didn't know when Althea gave me the book.”</p><p>Neville had gotten the book more than two years earlier if it was before he came to Hogwarts. Harry felt himself turning red.</p><p>“It just means when, you know, when you touch your own cock. It just means masturbate.”</p><p>Harry nodded, letting that knowledge sink in. He had done that, with some interesting and exciting results a few times, though the Dursleys had always told him it was very wrong. He could only assume anything they said was wrong wasn't, but it didn't give him much to go on otherwise.</p><p>“Look,” Neville said, giving Harry a hesitant smile and barreling on in a discussion that, Harry realized, was almost entirely one-sided. He'd barely said more than, “oh.”</p><p>Neville opened the book and flipped past a few pages. Each page was mostly text with a sort of simple line illustration of a man in the buff on most pages in the corner. “See, there's a whole chapter about it.”</p><p>Harry looked down and immediately read the sentence, “Making things slippery with a lubrication potion can be pleasurable and cut down on friction.” For a second, he tried to understand what it meant and then it dawned on him and he found himself turning bright red. He could literally feel the heat rising. He looked away in embarrassment.</p><p>“Hey, it's okay,” Neville said. “Really. I… I was lucky to have Althea. And Ron has his brothers. And Dean's got his dad. And Seamus, well, who knows where Seamus picks up things.” He smiled again and Harry found himself meeting Neville's eyes at last.</p><p>“The Dursleys always told me sex was dirty and wrong,” Harry said.</p><p>“I'm sorry,” Neville said.</p><p>“I know they're wrong,” Harry said. “I know it. I just...”</p><p>“It's all right,” Neville said quickly. “My gran once told me the only thing I needed to know about sex was that no proper young man should have it until he was married.”</p><p>Harry managed to laugh a little. At least he knew that was old fashioned.</p><p>“You can borrow the book,” Neville said. “It's dead useful. Especially Stanley.” He took out his wand and poked the drawing of the man in the corner. “Go on, Stanley.”</p><p>Harry started as the drawing suddenly moved and stretched. Then he gestured to the topic, which was listed at the top of the page as masturbation. The long, strange word that was new to Harry lit up then faded. Harry watched in both horror and fascination as the drawing lit up key words in different paragraphs then illustrated each thing with his own body. “Neville!” he squeaked, looking around at the curtains and remembering the silencing charm with some relief.</p><p>“I know,” Neville said. “He's right dirty. But he illustrates everything. See.” Neville flipped the pages and Harry watched as the little drawing Neville had dubbed Stanley pointed out parts of his body, the names lighting up. Harry hadn't even known some of those parts had names. “He's also got Edwina, you know, for showing stuff about birds and fannies.” Neville flipped past moving illustrations of Stanley silently pointing to another drawing, this one of a woman in the buff.</p><p>“Wow,” Harry said, slightly in awe.</p><p>“And there's Vincent,” Neville added. He shifted and blushed furiously.</p><p>“There's another man drawing?” Harry asked. “What for?”</p><p>“Oh, you know, for things about gay wizards,” Neville said.</p><p>Harry wasn't entirely sure what that meant and he was relieved and shocked when Neville further clarified. “You know, when two men kiss and, you know, do stuff.” He flipped ahead to a section in the back, where the little drawing of Stanley was next to a drawing of another male figure of a similar size but with different facial features. The title at the top of the page read “Homosexuality” and the two figures leaned forward into a silent kiss that seemed strangely passionate for two very simple drawings who didn't even have the ability to speak.</p><p>Harry forced himself to look away. His eyes had been wide and locked on the page. “I never,” he said.</p><p>“Yeah, me neither before the book.” Neville looked up at Harry, his face still bright red. “I know some people say it's unnatural and odd, but the book says it's totally normal, for some wizards anyway.”</p><p>“Oh,” Harry said.</p><p>“Yeah,” Neville said.</p><p>For a moment, their eyes met, but Neville looked away, toward the curtain. “Like I said, you can borrow the book, Harry.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Harry breathed. He felt strangely warm despite the oncoming nighttime chill that usually settled over the dorms in the fall. Part of him wanted to get up and run around from an excess energy that he wasn't even sure what to do with.</p><p>“You're welcome,” Neville said. “Er… Goodnight, I guess.”</p><p>And then Neville was gone and Harry was left alone with the most exciting book he'd seen since he first learned magic was real and books could contain spells that responded to his every whim. He wasn't even sure that this wasn't just as good.</p>
