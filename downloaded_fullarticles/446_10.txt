    <p>“Hermione,” Harry said softly as he joined her at the table. “Er, can I talk to you for a minute?”</p><p>	Generally, he had learned not to disturb his friend when she was studying. After all NEWTs were only eight months away, twelve days, and nineteen hours away (it was written on her planner in big red letters, thank you, Harry was hardly keeping track himself) but in this case, he really needed her help. He cast muffliato discreetly and that was enough to make her lift her nose from the enormous tome on, er—he glanced at the title just as she set it down—The Importance of Comparative Dynamics of Transformative Conversion. If he had to guess, and thank Merlin he didn’t, it was probably a very old, very technical Transfigurations book.</p><p>	“What is it, Harry?” she asked a little testily.</p><p>	“It’s, well…” This was not something he really wanted to talk with her about, but he knew, knew that somehow this was not a problem he could take to Ron. “I… I’ve been feeling a bit odd lately…” his voice trailed off.</p><p>	Hermione raised an exasperated eyebrow. “If you’re sick Harry you should go see Madame Pomfrey.”</p><p>	“I’m not sick.” Harry took a long breath and closed his eyes so at least he didn’t have to watch her reaction. “I think” —he gritted his teeth and rushed through the end— “Ithinkimanomega.”</p><p>	To her credit Hermione did not gasp or shriek or really have any reaction at all. Maybe her eyes got a little bigger, but by the time Harry warily cracked opened his eyes her expression was smooth. Then she sighed and said sympathetically, “Oh Harry, you have the absolute worst luck.”</p><p>	Harry flushed red and opened his mouth to protest but she cut him off.</p><p>	“I don’t mean that being an omega is a bad thing, Harry, just that male omegas are very rare. The last one in Britain died in 1954.” Trust Hermione to know the dates of obscure magical trivia.</p><p>	“I don’t want to be,” said Harry miserably. “I’ve never wanted to be. I especially don’t want to be a brood mare or even just a, a toy.”</p><p>	“Not all omegas are completely submissive, Harry,” Hermione said gently.</p><p>	“Really!” he said slightly hysterically and suddenly very glad for the muffling spell. “Tell me one who’s not!” Even female omegas were uncommon, and the ones Harry knew might as well have been non-existent. They rarely ventured out of their homes and thus were merely tales told by their alphas. Omegas were supposedly completely incapable of self-autonomy, physically and, far more galling, legally.</p><p>	“Well,” Hermione said, and she began so hesitantly that Harry blinked at her in surprise. “I’m not, for one.” </p><p>	“Oh.”</p><p>	He supposed he would have figured that out sooner or later when his senses caught up with the changes, but right now her scent was indistinguishable from the general mild scents of the library. He snorted internally. Given the amount of time Hermione spent here it wouldn’t surprise him if she smelled like the books she adored so much.</p><p>	Harry shook himself. “Have you had… you know?”</p><p>	“I had my first heat over the summer,” she said. “I think… they’re usually around three months apart so the next is likely not too far in the future.”</p><p>	Harry shivered. “How did you know…”</p><p>	Hermione winced in sympathy. “It starts with just a general sense of something wrong. You start wanting certain foods, mostly iron rich protein, and drinking too much water and feeling vaguely full and sloshy. Then your skin starts to feel sensitive and you notice every little touch from every person, every piece of clothing, every breath of air. Then you got sore in…” she blushed and shifted in a way that made Harry look at her breasts. Horrified he dragged his eyes immediately away to see her chagrinned expression.</p><p>	“I suppose for you it will just be soreness in you low abdomen, but I could be wrong. If you haven’t noticed anything by then the heat cramps, and for you I suppose it would be wetness in, er, the back, will be impossible to miss. The cramps are awful even though you feel really, really horny by the time it gets that far.”</p><p>	“It sounds awful,” Harry said emphatically. “How long does all that take?”</p><p>	“For a first heat symptoms usually start about three weeks before the cramps and slick.” They both turned crimson at the sound of that word. It wasn’t that Harry couldn’t listen to sexual talk; Seamus and Dean had had some very explicit and informative conversations in the dorm over the years. But Hermione was as good as his sister and the two concepts, sex and sibling, emphatically did not mix well.</p><p>	“Harry,” Hermione drew back his attention. “When did you start feeling funny?”</p><p>	He winced. “Two weekends ago.”</p><p>	“Have you been to see Madame Pomfrey? She’ll need to set up an isolation room for you.”</p><p>	“Why?” he asked without thinking.</p><p>	Hermione gave a fond if exasperated sigh. “Because until your first heat you don’t know if you can control yourself around alphas and if you can’t you’ll end up mated to the first one to get their hands on you.”</p><p>	“Shit.” </p><p>Harry’s chest clenched. Was it really too much to ask for one normal year at Hogwarts? The fates must be conspiring against him. He had defeated the Dark Lord (several times depending on how you counted) and restored peace to Wizarding Britain only to have this absurdity forced on him while he tried to finish his education.</p><p>	Hermione’s mouth pinched in sympathy. “Yeah I know.”</p><p>	“Wait,” said Harry, sitting up thoughtfully, “I thought all omegas lost their minds during heat. Do you mean…”</p><p>	“It’s incredibly rare for an omega to be able to keep enough of their mind during heat to be able to defend themselves or make choices. The few that can are called wild omegas because some people think that the wild magic is strongest in them. I knew an omega, a girl from Durmstrang, in our fourth year who was one. She said that unless you have a will that can control Fiendfyre, you probably can’t control yourself during heats.”</p><p>	“So that’s right out for me then,” Harry moaned, shivering at the memory of their one encounter with the cursed flame.</p><p>	“I don’t think I have it either,” Hermione said. “At least not enough for the full length of the heat; maybe for the first day.”</p><p>	“So,” Harry laughed blackly. “Looks like we’re stuck spending twenty days a year in painful isolation unless we feel like surrendering our bodies to some goddamned knothead. Fuck.”</p><p>	Harry planted his forehead on the table and covered his head with his arms.</p><p>	“At least you and Ron…” he started.</p><p>	“Ron’s not an alpha,” Hermione said too quickly.</p><p>	Harry raised his head. “But weren’t you… is that why after school started he suddenly started giving you the cold shoulder? I thought you’d just had a row or something.”</p><p>	“Or something,” Hermione’s mouth curled but it was the farthest thing from a smile. “I told him I was an omega when we got back. He was not happy about it.”</p><p>	“Why not? He…” Harry registered her expression and amended his original wording to “… is not your boyfriend?”</p><p>	“Not now. He wanted to be at the end of last year, but I told him I was traveling over the summer to get my parents and now… everyone in Ron’s family except Bill is a beta. A beta can’t see an omega through their heats, even the first ones and they only get worse with age. There’s no way I can end up with Ron.”</p><p>	“Oh,” said Harry. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>	“Don’t be,” Hermione said briskly and with a touch of irritation. “Frankly I’m not sure that’s what I wanted anyways.”</p><p>	Harry nodded because in all fairness he had never understood how Ron and Hermione would work as—well, as Ron and Hermione. “He isn’t going to like that I’m an omega, is he?”</p><p>	Hermione afforded him a sympathetic grimace. “No, I can’t imagine he will.”</p><p>	Harry let out his breath in a heavy sigh. “It is what it is, I suppose.”</p><p>	“It’ll work out, Harry, I promise.” Harry knew she was trying to convince herself as much as she was to him.</p><p>	“Thanks, Hermione.”</p><p>	For a few minutes more Harry sat digesting the conversation before remembering that he did have homework to complete. He settled at the table with his Charms work and pulled one of Hermione’s books towards him. She smiled at him for his studiousness, writing steadily on her Transfigurations essay before rising to shelve the giant tome.</p><p>	The next set of books she dumped on the table contained chains of symbols and numbers Harry could not interpret so he assumed it was for Arithmancy. He raised an eyebrow as Hermione opened four different books at once.</p><p>	“Shut up, Harry,” she snapped without looking at him.</p><p>	A hint of a playful smile flitted across his face. Harry said nothing and looked back at his Charms. They worked in silence for a while with just the occasional shuffle of other students to and from the bookshelves to distract them. </p><p>	“Granger are you finished with Wilkinson’s Treatise on Arithmetic Certainties?” asked a voice without warning.</p><p>	Harry and Hermione both looked up from their work. A tall, dark haired Slytherin whom Harry only vaguely recognized stood across the table looking at Hermione expectantly.</p><p>	“Um, yeah, here,” Hermione shoved the book she had just been consulting across the table towards him.</p><p>	“Thank you.” The Slytherin collected the book and walked away.</p><p>	Harry gaped at his friend. “Hermione, you are okay? I know you weren’t finished with that.”</p><p>	He watched her blush furiously which only deepened his confusion. </p><p>	“Nott’s an alpha,” she muttered unhappily. “I just wanted him to go away.”</p><p>	“Oh.” Harry felt it might be more than that, but he knew better than to pursue a subject along that line. “You know him?”</p><p>	“He’s in Arithmancy and Ancient Runes with me,” Hermione said, dropping her eyes back to her paper.</p><p>	“Hermione…”</p><p>	“Drop it Harry.” He knew Hermione’s tones well enough by now that he wisely did drop it and thus escaped without talon scratches across his face.</p><p>	“I’ll see you at dinner.” He shoved things into his bag then paused. “You will be at dinner, won’t you? NEWTs aren’t that close.”</p><p>	She rolled her eyes. “Yes, I’ll be at dinner. Obviously, I can’t leave you alone with Ron. You might pick up some of his table manners.”</p><p>	Harry snorted, “Merlin forbid,” and headed back to the common room leaving Hermione alone with her books. His scent swirled behind him, and when she concentrated, she could just smell the beginnings of his gender. Poor Harry. It seemed that fate, or was that Fate, really was out to get him one way or another.</p><p>	“Granger.”</p><p>	Hermione flinched in surprise and immediately wished she hadn’t. Nott stood to her right, dark penetrating eyes fixed on her reaction.</p><p>	“Yes.” At least her voice came out steady. Merlin, why hadn’t she just left with Harry? Had Nott deliberately waited to corner her until after he had left?</p><p>	“You lied when you said you were finished with this.”</p><p>	He set down Wilkinson’s Treatise with a soft thud, and the fall of the book brought a wave of air carrying the alpha’s scent right to Hermione’s nose. She tried so hard not to start trembling.</p><p>	“No, I didn’t.”</p><p>	His expression did not change as he waved a hand at the pile of books on the table. “You have half the Arithmancy section sitting here opened to sections on certainties and your essay is only sixteen inches long.” His low voice was doing dangerous things to her insides. “Why did you let me have the book?”</p><p>	Hermione felt her body curl defensively despite herself. “You… you needed it.”</p><p>	Nott gazed implacably at her and turned abruptly away. Hermione waited until he was past the Herbology shelves before letting out her breath with a shaky sigh. Suddenly joining Harry at dinner sounded vastly more appealing than it had ten minutes ago. </p><p>Capping her ink bottle, Hermione rolled up her parchments and stacked the books neatly to return to Madame Pince. She left the library briskly, eager for familiar, safe company, and quite unaware of the pair of dark curious eyes that observed her hasty retreat.</p>
