  <b>    </b>
  <span>Hermione sighed as she exited the chambers deep in the Wizengmont level of the British Ministry of Magic. An emergency meeting had been called by her late last night, every Minister in attendance. Now it was almost time for lunch the next day according to her timepiece, but Hermione didn’t have time to go down and grab something to eat. Now that she’d gotten the answer she wanted, she needed to act fast before one of them changed their mind and called for another vote.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>At twenty-five years old, Hermione was the youngest Senator for the Alliance of Magical Communities to ever be voted into office. She’d been elected at the tender age of twenty despite her designation, the required age to hold the official title, and the people she served had never looked back. Most of them anyway, her opposition was far less than her support. In fact, she’d just been re-elected this year. She knew she’d been elected mostly because she’d been the sole survivor of the ‘Golden Trio’ after the war. Her, Harry, and Ron; they’d been the driving force of the bloody war waged by her home country and she’d continued to fight for change after they’d won, spurred by her experience and the death of her best friends among many others.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Earth was a Republic planet located in the Milky Way System, considered too far by many enterprises located in the core planets. Her people preferred it that way, as did the Muggles. The Senate tended not to interfere with them too much, Hermione only making the trip to Coruscant once a year. She also suspected her people’s manipulation of magic, the Force most others called it, was enough of a deterrent against meddling Politicians. They were too wary, their power too unknown. In fact, the last time the Chancellor had visited Earth had been for her inaugural ball at the beginning of her first term. Chancellor Palpatine had been concerned when he’d learned an Omega had been elected into office and wanted to see for himself that she was of sound mind and not being controlled. There was a reason the Senate was mostly made up of Betas.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lately though, since the beginning of the conflict dubbed the Clone Wars a few months back, Hermione had been called to give her vote more and more as the Senate meetings increased. She was able to do it by proxy for the most part, but some of her Senator friends were urging her to come to Coruscant more often, even set up a semi-permanent home base. Hermione had been able to wave off the increased efforts to draw her people into this war, but with the latest developments staring her in the face, she knew that time was coming to an end.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dealing with the Muggle population was a big part of her job, especially their Senator. Normally, planets only had one official Senator to represent them, but their agreement with the Republic a long time ago gave Earth two. One represented the Muggle faction, and the other the Magical beings. Magical beings used to only include Witches and Wizards, but under her direction, the list had expanded to include sentient creatures and other classifications. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They were often in disagreement with each other. Centuries of misdeeds and mistrust had seen to that. Hermione only marginally got along with the Muggle Senator, a middle-aged conservative man who sent the wrong kind of chills up her spine. The one thing they’d agreed upon completely was that they would remain with the Republic, and resist all efforts to be drawn into this war.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her discreetly placed spy in their government informed her that was no longer the case.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She trusted this person without question, knew he wouldn’t give her false information. She’d called the emergency meeting after going over his entire report. The meeting had been to ask the Jedi for advice, and to intervene on their behalf before taking their case to the Senate and exposing their planet to further scrutiny. It was a risky move, the Muggles didn’t like the Jedi just as much as they didn’t like them, but the Jedi’s own distrust in Hermione’s people put them a step higher in their eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was her board of Ministers she’d needed to convince.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Jedi were extremely wary of the magical population. They used magic which the Jedi stubbornly labeled the Force. Their beliefs and traditions didn’t sit well with her people. Who, in their right mind, approved of taking babies away from their families? They didn’t, and the magic in their blood made it impossible to get an accurate midi-chlorian count that was mandatory after birth. It wasn’t to say they were completely immune to the Jedi coming and taking magical children. Part of their agreement with the Republic was that if a child showed signs of being more… Jedi to put it simply, they’d be surrendered to the Order. The cut off for this was at the age of five, and only rarely had a child come back because they manifested magic. Purebloods were greatly affected by this, and they were often the driving force behind the unwillingness to become involved with the Jedi anymore than they already were.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione wasn’t so distrusting, but she found some of their practices barbaric and hadn’t pushed for better relations. Until now. The fight had lasted the entire night, but her words had finally made the Minister’s see sense. Now wasn’t the time to hang onto grudges, not when they were at risk of being subdued by the Separatists. She knew she would have to present her case in person, to show the enormity of their concerns. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She made it back to her office, a big open room on the Minister’s level. Dean Thomas, her Head of Security, was waiting for her. “Your transport will be ready to leave when you are.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She smiled in thanks, walking to her desk. “I appreciate it, Dean. I would have given more notice, but I need to act now before something changes.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dean leaned against the wall, watching her start magically lifting files into a briefcase he knew expanded. “The crew understands. That ship is yours only, Hermione.” He stopped talking, mouth twisting into a grimace.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione sighed, already knowing what he was going to say. “Out with it, Dean.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re leaving me here.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Oh, she knew he’d be cross about that order. “Yes. You’re the only one I trust with our guy on the other side. The situation could get worse at any moment. If something happens while I’m gone, you’ll be the one in charge of mobilizing our security forces.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hermione,” Dean growled out, leaving his post by the wall to approach her. His voice changed, the timbre deeper than before. “I’m in charge of your safety. I should be with you.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione fought the shiver and the need to obey. Damn Alphas. “That’s not fair, Dean. I’ve already made my decision. I’ll be safe among the Jedi in Coruscant. Most are Betas anyway.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Alphas and Omegas were few, uncommon across the Universe. They were each considered a minority, the Betas making up a majority of the population. There had been plenty of research as to why, but the reason hadn’t been found yet. It wasn’t as if the need to find out was extremely pressing. Designations weren’t the end-all to one’s path in life. Alphas were charismatic, domineering, proud. Yet, they didn’t rule the galaxy. Omegas were, by nature, nurturing and friendly. No one would accuse Hermione of being friendly when she was on a warpath. Betas were the most balanced between the three; their soothing presence often calming Alphas and Omegas. They were natural peacemakers, their scents weaker. It’d been proven many times before that sending a Beta into a room full of stressed Alphas could diffuse a potentially disastrous situation. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dean wasn’t satisfied with her reassurance. “You’ll take your suppressants.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione scowled. “Those are only for emergencies. You know that.” Suppressants, a medicine designed specifically for Alphas and Omegas, help dull the traits that came with their designations. They weren’t meant to be used daily, the side effects too damaging from consistent use. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hermione,” Dean growled again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her body quivered at his tone, his order. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Obey</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Do as your Alpha tells you.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Except, he wasn’t her Alpha. It was a fine line they played, her and Dean. She was the only Alpha she trusted with her heats, the arrangement starting when he came into her service at the beginning of her term. He would never claim her without permission, not something she could say about other Alphas if given the opportunity to bed her during the most vulnerable time in her life. They both knew they weren’t for each other, but after years of taking care of one another; their instincts were harder to convince. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She knew it was those natural feelings driving him now. She stood her ground, lifting her chin in defiance. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>No</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Dean. That won’t be necessary. I’ll be safe.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dean took a step back, his jaw working through the tension as he rolled his shoulders. “I’m sorry, Mione. You know how it is…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That’s when she knew he was back to normal. He never called her by her childhood nickname when the Alpha in him was driving the wheel. She smiled gently, walking over, briefcase in hand, and patting him on the chest. “I know. You’ll take care of things here, Dean, and I’ll handle things in Coruscant.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He sighed and nodded, conceding the battle. “You’ll notify me right away if something feels off.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It wasn’t an order from Alpha to Omega this time, but one of Head of Security to Senator. She nodded her agreement. When it came to her safety, she knew to trust her instincts. She would call him if she was in danger. It was a promise she’d made when he’d first started protecting her, extracted because he’d known her most of her life. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was only the Jedi Council, a temple full of Betas, who were duty-bound to help them anyway. She couldn’t think of any plausible situation where things would go wrong.</span>
