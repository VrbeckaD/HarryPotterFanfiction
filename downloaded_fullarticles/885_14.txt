    <p>“I wish you had been a girl,” said Narcissa Malfoy.</p><p>Draco laughed. It was so cold in Azkaban. The number of dementors had been greatly reduced, but there were enough of them for Draco’s head to feel cloudy and light, as if he hadn’t slept in days. Perhaps he hadn’t.</p><p>“That’s a new one,” he said. “Why?”</p><p>“We raised you to command respect. If you had been a girl, we would have raised you to be loved,” said his mother. </p><p>They were the only prisoners sharing a cell, to Draco’s knowledge. He didn’t know who he had to thank for that mercy, but he knew it was the only thing keeping him sane. His mother sat across the cell from him, her hair mysteriously shiny and clean, despite how irregularly they were allowed to shower. She managed to keep her dignity, even here. </p><p>“But you do love me,” he said.</p><p>“Of course! My sweet boy, of course. But you were not trained to make people love you. And you will need that, now.”</p><p>“Will I,” said Draco flatly.</p><p>“It’s late,” said his mother. “But you must be taught. It’s the only way.”</p><p>“Teach me what? How to be a girl?”</p><p>“How to make people love you.”</p><p>“You can’t be serious.”</p><p>His mother’s voice was urgent.</p><p>“You’re going to get out of here, Draco, and it’s going to be so hard. No one will respect you. They will pity you, if you’re lucky. But pity can easily be translated into love, and eventually that will lead to respect. You have to make them love you.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Everyone!”</p><p>Draco sighed. </p><p>“Well, I suppose it will pass the time. Go on then. What’s my first lesson?”</p><p><br/>*****</p><p><br/>Blind drunk, Harry stumbled through the front door. Ron had to unlock it for him. </p><p>“Steady on, mate,” said Ron. </p><p>Harry ignored him and went to the liquor cabinet. </p><p>“Firewhisky?” he asked.</p><p>“No thanks, I’m about to puke. And so are you. Go to bed.”</p><p>“Fuck! Fucking <em>fuck</em>!” said Harry. There was no firewhisky left. “Kreacher!”</p><p>Kreacher appeared with a pop. Ron looked distinctly uncomfortable.</p><p>“Where the <em>fuck</em> is the <em>fucking</em> firewhisky, Kreacher? Did you drink it? Where is it?”</p><p>“Master is drunk again,” said Kreacher.</p><p>“Harry, come on, go to bed.”</p><p>“Oh, fuck off back to Hermione.”</p><p>“You know what? I will,” said Ron, going to the chimney. His face matched his hair for colour. “This Angry Fifth Year Harry act is getting pretty old, actually.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry, is my trauma inconveniencing you?”</p><p>“We all have trauma, Harry, but we’re not all being dicks about it.”</p><p>“I’m not being a dick!”</p><p>“You absolutely are, mate. Look, I get it, the trials are hard, but if you would just <em>talk</em> to us about it—”</p><p>“There’s nothing to talk about!” shouted Harry. </p><p>Ron looked tired.</p><p>“Right. Well. Put him to bed, would you, Kreacher?”</p><p>“Master is not obeying Kreacher, Mr. Weasley. Kreacher is obeying Master.”</p><p>“Yeah,” said Harry. “That’s right. And right now, I order you go find more firewhisky. There must be somewhere that’s still open.”</p><p>“Goodnight, Harry,” said Ron, disappearing into the chimney. The green burst of the floo made Harry wince. He didn’t like people using floo powder around him anymore. It was too vivid. Everything was a bit too vivid, since May. Oversaturated. That was why drinking helped; it calmed the colours down. </p><p>Kreacher found him another bottle of alcohol, and eventually, Harry passed out at the kitchen table. </p><p><br/>****</p><p>“Everyone wants to talk about something. You just need to find out what it is, and ask them about it,” said Narcissa Malfoy. “That’s the key to being a good conversationalist. Asking the right questions.”</p><p>“What if they’re tedious to the core?”</p><p>“No one is, Draco.”</p><p>They practiced. Narcissa played a shy, monosyllabic dinner guest. Draco asked her probing questions in an attempt to engage her. After half an hour, he was furious.</p><p>“Anyone so difficult to talk to deserves to be hexed,” he said.</p><p>“My sweet, you must be patient. Patience will make you lovable. Try again.” </p><p>It took several times, but finally he cracked her. She had picked a subject beforehand without telling him, and when Draco stumbled upon it (eighth century dream magic) she began talking enthusiastically. It felt to Draco like eating shellfish: one had to break through the clunking armour to access the meat. </p><p>“That was good,” she said. “Now I will teach you magic words: ‘What do you mean?’”</p><p>“What do you mean?” asked Draco. His mother nodded. “No,” said Draco. “What do you <em>mean</em>? How are those magic words?”</p><p>“Everyone wants to be understood, Draco. When you ask someone what they mean, particularly after they’ve already been talking at length, they feel as if they matter. People love to matter. They love those who make them feel that way.”</p><p>Draco closed his eyes and stretched out his legs. They ached from being curled into his chest all day — or was it all night? It was so dark in Azkaban. So dark, and so cold. His spine shivered painfully, and he drew his legs back for warmth, although it hurt him. </p><p>Where had this belief been during the war, he wondered? <em>Everyone wants to be understood.</em> Had his parents tried to understand muggleborns? Blood traitors?</p><p>He did not say anything. To ask his mother how she could have two such conflicting views would be to criticise her, and he couldn’t do that. It was funny: as a teenager (and he was still a teenager, he reminded himself) he had never tried to spare his parents’ feelings. He told them he hated them, when they wouldn’t buy him what he wanted. He hurled abuse at them constantly. But now that they were all three in prison, the idea of adding to their guilt in any way made his stomach roil. </p><p>“Do you feel remorse, Draco?” asked his mother one day. He knew it was daytime, because they had just had a meal. Bread. Draco was so hungry sometimes it felt as if his insides were eating themselves.</p><p>“I’m too angry to feel remorse,” he said.</p><p>“You must repent,” she said. “No one will love you out there, if you don’t.” </p><p>“Do you feel remorse?” he asked her.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Draco. I wish you could forgive me.”</p><p>She looked so unhappy.</p><p>“I told you already,” said Draco. “There's nothing to forgive.” </p><p>She had often told him how sorry she was, but it seemed to Draco that she was only sorry for how her actions had impacted him, not for their innate immorality. Not that he thought much about morality. It was as he said: he was too angry. When he thought of the war, he felt a surge of fury that blinded him so that he couldn’t make out any distinct feeling beyond <em>unfair, unfair, unfair</em>. He didn’t let himself think about it. That way lay madness. </p><p>The lessons passed the time. </p><p>“Self-pity is abhorrent,” said his mother. “There is nothing less likely to gain you sympathy than seeking it out. You must bear pain bravely and without complaint.” </p><p>“I’ve never been brave,” said Draco. </p><p>“You must be, now, or no one will love you.”</p><p>“You love me,” he said, because her words disturbed him.</p><p>“Yes, yes, I love you so much. I want you to be safe. I want you to be happy. It will be so hard for you, out there.”</p><p>Sometimes, Draco didn’t want to leave Azkaban. It was dark, and cold, and he was hungry, but his mother was there. Perhaps they would both get out. Somehow, he knew they wouldn’t. His mother seemed to know this too. When she spoke of Draco leaving, it was always with the understanding that he would go alone. </p><p>“Do not speak of yourself. Only ask questions,” said his mother.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“It affects the balance of power. At first, people will think you are fascinated by them. This will eventually lead to them being fascinated by you. When you know everything about them, and they know nothing about you, you hold the cards, and they will love you for it.”</p><p>It wasn’t <em>goodness</em> she was teaching him. It was some kind of Slytherin code of conduct. It was a way of stealing power through emotions. All the things he took pride in had been stripped from him, and she offered him another form of strength. </p><p>“Do you feel remorse?” she asked him, often. </p><p>“No,” he said. He was too angry, and he could not look at the anger, so he could not feel remorse. </p><p>It was cloudy in his head, in any case, because of the dementors. His mother sat apart from him, except when he was asleep. He awoke from his nightmares with the ghost of her touch on his scalp. </p><p>“You must repent,” she told him. “You must accept responsibility for the harm you did.”</p><p>“The harm <em>we</em> did,” corrected Draco.</p><p>“Yes,” she said faintly, and he was immediately struck by awful, heart-rending guilt. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” he said.</p><p>“No one will love you. You have to. You have to repent.” </p><p>“I can’t,” he said. </p><p>“Well, to the next lesson. Compliments.” </p><p>She trained him for hours at a time. She filled him with theories about people, about what they wanted, about how to make them love him. She was so frightened no one would love him again. Draco understood that her fear was grounded in guilt, but he wished she wouldn’t say it so often. </p><p>The day before his trial, she said it so much that Draco wanted to shake her. He was quiet, although he tried to comfort her.</p><p>“No matter what, Draco, you must get out of this place. Take any option, other than here. You will go mad if you stay.”</p><p>“I don’t want to leave you,” he said. </p><p>“You will break my heart if you don’t go,” she said simply. </p><p>“I’ll come and visit.”</p><p>“That’s good of you. It will be so hard for you, out there.”</p><p>Draco knocked his head against the wall, gently, so that she wouldn’t hear. </p><p>When the guard came to fetch him, she was frantic.</p><p>“Remember—you must brave—humble—not cowed, but not arrogant—brave—stoic—remember—no one will love you if—be brave—”</p><p>“I know,” said Draco. </p><p>They did not hug. He nodded at her, and followed the guard to the portkey. </p><p> </p><p>****</p><p>Harry had been dreading Malfoy’s trial more than any of the others. It was the only one so far where he was testifying for the defence. Privately, Harry felt that Malfoy shouldn’t have gone to trial at all. Shouldn’t Harry’s opinion be enough? He had saved the entire Wizarding world. Couldn’t they trust his judgment on one miserable eighteen-year-old git? Malfoy had already lost enough.</p><p>He spoke his piece, explaining how Malfoy had arguably saved his life at the Manor, how he had tried to stop Crabbe and Goyle from killing him, how he had lowered his wand instead of harming Dumbledore. Malfoy looked utterly bedraggled, but he sat tall, with his eyes lowered. He had only been in Azkaban for three months, but he was wasting away. Grief had evidently struck him hard. He did not meet Harry’s gaze, even though Harry tried to make him look.</p><p>Harry, it had to be said, was still rather drunk from the night before. He had gone to a muggle club and slept with two different men in a row. The first one was shite so he had to go back for seconds. The second one wasn’t much better, but by the time they were done Harry was so dizzy he couldn’t stand up and he called it a night. </p><p>The prosecutor was the kind of person Harry loathed the most. He hadn’t been involved in the war, but he accused Malfoy with a smug self-righteousness that made Harry seethe. Not that Harry didn’t also think Malfoy was a bigoted little shit. It was just that Harry felt as if his word should hold more weight than the self-satisfied prick of a lawyer who drew terse, monosyllabic replies from Malfoy with such crowing delight. </p><p>“Are you okay?” whispered Hermione.</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>The judge cleared his throat. It was time to hear Malfoy’s sentence. Harry hated this moment. He always looked at the accused and remembered how it had felt to sit in that chair, in fifth year. </p><p>Malfoy was very still, as if he was unbothered by the chains that wrapped around him. His face was impassive.</p><p>“This court hereby sentences Draco Lucius Malfoy to five years in Azkaban under dementor custody—”</p><p>“No!” </p><p>Harry was not aware he had shouted until after it happened. </p><p>“Harry! Sit down!” said Hermione. </p><p>“No,” said Harry. “This is ridiculous. I’ve testified in favour of <em>one</em> person, in all these trials. <em>One</em> person who I think might be redeemable, and you lot won’t even bloody listen?”</p><p>“Mr. Potter, without your testimony, the sentence would undoubtedly have been ten to fifteen—”</p><p>“I don’t care! It’s not about him! It’s about me!”</p><p>God, he really was quite drunk. Had he just said that? But he went on, ignoring Ron’s glowering look. Hermione had her head her hands. Malfoy, infuriatingly, looked completely undisturbed.</p><p>“I <em>died</em> for you! For all of you! And you have the <em>gall</em> not to trust my judgment…!”</p><p>“Harry,” breathed Hermione. “The Wizengamot can’t cater to your whims!”</p><p>“Look at him!” shouted Harry, pointing at Malfoy, who finally reacted. He raised his eyebrows. “He looks like shit! He’s not going to last five years in there. He’s already half-dead after three months. Time served, let him go.”</p><p>“The court declares a brief recess,” said the judge. The murmuring that had begun at Harry’s outburst grew into a loud babble of excitement and outrage. </p><p>“You’ve gone mad,” said Ron. “You just had a mental breakdown about <em>Malfoy</em> going to Azkaban. You love sending Malfoys to Azkaban.”</p><p>“It’s not about Malfoy,” said Harry. “It’s about—it’s about people getting what they deserve.”</p><p>“He was a Death Eater, Harry,” said Hermione. “Don’t you think he deserves to be punished?”</p><p>“It’s not about what <em>he</em> deserves. It’s about what <em>I</em> deserve. <em>I</em> deserve to be listened to!” </p><p>“Stop shouting.”</p><p>“I’m not shouting!”</p><p>The judge reappeared, and the court settled.</p><p>“In view of the <em>unusual</em> circumstances of the key witness in this case,” he said, “we would like to offer an alternative judgment. Mr. Malfoy may either serve five years in Azkaban, or…” He paused to smirk at Harry. “…he may submit to a prisoner’s bond with Harry Potter for a one year period.”</p><p>Everyone started talking at once. </p><p>“Harry, you can’t, it’s too much responsibility— it’s the last thing you need right now,” said Hermione urgently. </p><p>“Mate, no way, it’s <em>Malfoy</em>, you don’t want that git in your house.”</p><p>“Order! Order! Mr. Potter, a prisoner’s bond would ensure that Mr. Malfoy would have to obey any instructions you gave him. He would also not be able to stray further from you than fifteen metres without your express permission. He would be banned from performing magic. You would, in essence, become his jailer.” </p><p>Harry stared at Malfoy. The only sign that he had even heard was that he was clenching his jaw. </p><p>“You’re just doing this to humiliate me,” Harry told the judge. Hermione made a small moan. He  ignored her. </p><p>“Mr. Malfoy is a danger to society,” said the judge. “We believe you would be able to neutralise that risk, but if you are unwilling, we are, of course, happy to send him to Azkaban, as per our original ruling.” </p><p>“No,” said Harry firmly. “I’ll do it.”</p><p>“Harry!”</p><p>Malfoy raised his eyebrows again.</p><p>“Mr. Malfoy, do you consent?”</p><p>“Yes,” said Malfoy, without hesitation. </p><p>“Harry, you <em>can’t</em>,” said Hermione. </p><p>“Honestly, Hermione? Fuck it.” </p><p>He clambered over the stalls to get to where the judge stood by Malfoy’s chair.</p><p>“Hold out your arm,” said the judge. The chains around Malfoy’s chest loosened.</p><p>Malfoy held out his right arm.</p><p>“Your <em>other</em> arm, Mr. Malfoy.”</p><p>Malfoy flushed and held out his left arm. In the grey rags he wore, his forearm was exposed, the Dark Mark hideous and bruised-looking. </p><p>“Mr. Potter, if you would place your hand on his Mark?”</p><p>Harry quailed. It was one thing to agree to have complete power over Malfoy, another thing entirely <em>to touch his Dark Mark</em>. It was revolting. It made him sweat just looking at it. </p><p>Malfoy lowered his arm.</p><p>“Never mind, Potter,” he said. “Thanks all the same.”</p><p>Harry grabbed him and put his hand over the mark. He had expected it to feel different, but it was just skin—slightly cold skin. It was also the most contact he’d ever had with Malfoy without one of them trying to kill each other. </p><p>“You both understand that this is a magically binding contract?”</p><p>“Yes,” they said. Malfoy was avoiding his eye again. </p><p>“In that case…. <em>Captivus carcerem</em>!”</p><p>The mark warmed under Harry’s hand. Malfoy twitched, but said nothing.</p><p>“Well, let’s see if that worked. Mr. Potter, would you give a command?”</p><p>“Look at me,” said Harry. Malfoy turned his grey eyes to him. They were steady and emotionless. </p><p>Harry was disheartened to notice that Azkaban hadn’t really made him any less good looking.</p><p>“Perhaps something he would be unwilling to do, to test,” said the judge. </p><p>Malfoy frowned a little. </p><p>“Um…” said Harry. “Jump up and down?”</p><p>Malfoy was still chained to the chair. He tried to get up, could not, and began to writhe, gasping, in what was clearly agony. </p><p>“Stop! Stay seated!” said Harry quickly. Malfoy drooped, his dirty hair falling into his face. “What the hell was that?”</p><p>“The bond uses the cruciatus curse as a fail-safe. It’s to prevent disobedience.”</p><p>“That’s fucked up!”</p><p>The judge sniffed a little.</p><p>“Well, the spell seems to have worked. I will send over an informational pamphlet that ought to answer any questions you might have. You are both free to go.”</p><p>He touched the chains that still confined Malfoy and they fell to the ground with a clamour.</p><p>“Wait,” said Malfoy. “I thought I would return to Azkaban to await release. I have to say goodbye to my mother.”</p><p>An icy chill spread through Harry. </p><p>“Mr. Malfoy, your mother is dead,” said the judge. “She was killed when they apprehended your father.”</p><p>“No,” said Malfoy, confidently. “She was in my cell with me.”</p><p>“Your father was killed as well,” said the judge, with what Harry thought was a little too much enthusiasm for the truth. “They are both dead. You were <em>there</em>.”</p><p>“No,” said Malfoy, but he sounded less confident now. “No, because… because I <em>saw</em> her. Today, I saw her—” Suddenly his eyes went round. “Oh,” he said, softly.</p><p>“Let’s get out of here,” said Harry, because it looked like Malfoy might cry, and there were photographers hovering.</p><p>It was as if Malfoy tidied up his emotions. They disappeared neatly from his face, and he <em>smiled</em>. </p><p>“Lead the way,” he said.</p><p>“Side along all right?”</p><p>“Yes.” </p><p>Harry put his hand on Malfoy’s elbow, and twisted them to Grimmauld Place. </p>
