  <strong> Chapter 1- Visions</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> 'What WAS that!?' </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Godric Gryffindor, age 21, had been wondering that all day. Thankfully, he had an expert Seer as a friend and was just awaiting his arrival. Speaking of which......</p><p> </p><p>"Hello mine cater-cousin, how art thou <strong>[1]</strong>?" Godric greeted his long time friend Myrddin Emrys at the door of his home.</p><p> </p><p>"Godric mine corky cater-cousin, 'tis good to seeth thou again. I am well. How doth thou fair? <strong>[2]</strong>" Myriddin said cheerfully walking up to Godric</p><p> </p><p>Godric sighed wearily as he embraced the man he saw as a close brother.</p><p> </p><p>"Not well, not well at all I feareth. I've been up nearly half the night pond'ring a dream that I had. <strong>[3]</strong>" Godric responded before leading Myrddin to the sitting room.</p><p> </p><p>After ensuring a house elf brought him and Myrddin some wine, Godric studied Myrddin for several minutes. Myrddin was silent the whole time for he knew his friend well. Godric usually got this way when he was in deep thought or trying to order his thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>Sure enough after staring for a bit Godric blinked and sighed.</p><p> </p><p>"This dream, I am sure 'tis a vision of the distant future. I was hoping thou couldst aid me towards und'rstanding it. <strong>[4]</strong>" Godric said, his voice a picture of exhaustion. Myrddin nodded in understanding of the problem. While his brother in all but blood was not classified as a true Seer, Godric did get the odd vision every now and again.</p><p> </p><p>“Telleth me broth'r," Myrddin said "Speak to me some of this vision so that i may prop'rly parley with the Fates to break this with them.<strong>[5]</strong>"</p><p> </p><p>"I wouldst if I couldst broth'r, howev'r I Saw an entire life's time ov'r half the night. <strong>[6]</strong>" Godric said quietly.</p><p> </p><p>After a few moments of silence Godric continued " The most vivid of the vision howev'r was that of a young lad with hair as black as a raven, vivid bright green eyes that shin'd with pow'r as if they w're em'ralds and a fad'd lightning bolt scar 'pon his brow.... <strong>[7]</strong>".</p><p> </p><p>Here Godric paused and scrunched up his face while he focused on what he could recall of the next part.</p><p> </p><p>"He was fighting a. . . . . . . I doth not wot if I shouldst clepe that being a man," he said slowly, trying to keep focused on the memory, "He wilt hast been bef're as he walk'd on two forks and carri'd a wand of focus. But that one's humanity appear'd to hast left him long ago. An'yhow, this young man was fighting the beast in a castle's ruins and. . . . . well, and then I awoke. <strong>[8]</strong>"</p><p> </p><p>Myrddin sat back in his seat and nodded.</p><p> </p><p>"Giveth me but a moment mine cater-cousin. I will hast an answ'r from the Fates and let thou wot their answ'r in a while. <strong>[9]</strong>" he said. Godric nodded and motioned for Myrddin to continue.</p><p> </p><p>As Godric watched Myrddin quietly, his mind drifted back to the white bearded man in his vision. In Godric's opinion 'Albus too-many-names Dumbledore' was just as much a monster as this Voldemort character. Albeit a different and in some ways more dangerous monster than Voldemort, but still........</p><p> </p><p>'<em> If I was sent this vision f'r a reason. . . nay, I bett'r hold my thoughts until Myrddin confirms 'r denies this </em> .' <strong>[10]</strong></p><p> </p><p>A few minutes later Myrddin's eyes blinked open before looking straight at Godric.</p><p> </p><p>"It seems that the Fates need us both to give our aid to the future. Thou to aid this raven hair'd young fellow and I to assist thou in this endev'r with mine en'rgy, <strong>[11]</strong>" he said after a few moments of gathering his thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>"I seeth, 'tis as I thought then. V'ry well, what doth we need to do to get started? <strong>[12]</strong>" Godric responded.</p><p> </p><p>------------</p><p> </p><p>Several days later, Godric and Myrddin traveled to Stonehenge, the most magic saturated area in England. Godric was relieved, he had been worried that the local magical village wouldn’t allow them use of the site. But after having explained the situation to them, the locals-who were consequently Druids who believed in the balance of nature-agreed to allow them one time use of the site.</p><p> </p><p>As Myrddin got the site set up for the ritual he was going to perform, Godric checked the supplies for the journey back to his house before checking the letter he was planning to send along with the charms on the parchment attached to the letter. He also checked over the package he intended to send with both parchments before nodding while looking at the pure white phoenix perched on his shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>The phoenix had found Myrddin and Godric's camp just the other day. According to the Druids, she told them her name was Hedwig and that her home had been the very time they were sending the letter too. She had been hit by the spell that Godric's own mentor had created. Her spirit had lingered for a time near where her body had lay. Fortunately, before she could decide to move on, a royal phoenix that she knew well had appeared to her.</p><p> </p><p>Fawkes, the royal one's name, had asked her if she wanted to leave her boy. When Hedwig said no, Fawkes had given up his own life force to her, turning her into this phoenix. She said it took her a while to recover and when she did she had found herself in the current time period.</p><p> </p><p>Since then she had been desperately searching for a way home and, after hearing from a few animals of 2 leg walkers who had been heard talking about time travel she had sought them out and had found them only a day's travel away from Stonehenge. After Godric heard that, he and Myrddin had worked on altering the ritual they had created to include sending a live creature through as well.</p><p> </p><p>'Tis almost time lass, art thou ready to return to thy home? <strong>[13]</strong>" Godric asked her softly.</p><p> </p><p>The white one trilled a joyful note and then nuzzled Godric before letting out a lower more sorrowful note. She and Godric had become fast friends. They both also knew they would see each other again, even if that version of her might not remember him. ''Tis alright lass, 'tis not farewell simply a temp'rary good bye. <strong>[14]</strong>"</p><p> </p><p>"Godric, 'tis time," Myrddin said from by the ritual circle. Godric nodded and stroked Hedwig's head gently a bit before handing her the letter and shrunk the package tying it to her leg. "Happy fortune to you lass, safe travels," he mumbled. She took the letter in her beak before heading over to the middle of the circle and settling down on the ground.</p><p> </p><p>Both men got on either side of the circle and started chanting in Welsh, neither noticing the glow of the circle lighting the area. Both were busy picturing a young man that had raven black hair that stuck out at all angles of his head, bright emerald green almond shaped eyes, what looked like funny double eye monicles and most vividly, a lightning bolt shaped scar resting on his forehead in the center.</p><p> </p><p>It took 30 minutes and a lot out of them both of them, but when Godric opened his eyes Hedwig was gone with her package. 'Good Fortune to you Hedwig,’ Godric thought as he looked quietly up at the sky.</p><p> </p><p>............</p><p> </p><p>115 miles and 992 years away, 17 year old Harry Potter was surprised as a white phoenix appeared, perching on his lap and clutching in her beak 2 pieces of parchment.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
