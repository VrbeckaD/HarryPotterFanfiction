    <p>It was a warm day, though the ground was wet from the previous night’s rain and puddles splashed up against the thin ratty socks on his feet and too small trainers his Aunt Petunia picked up from the charity shop last Christmas. </p>
<p>The sun was out, warmth felled only by the cool winds that rubbed against his face and sent goosebumps down his arms. His hands clutched numbly at the old Tesco shopping bag stained with droplets of muddy water and tinged green from many escapades in the grass. It carried all his books, his prize possessions. He spent a long time making sure all his books were pristine, hiding them from Dudley so he couldn’t rip them up. </p>
<p>Harry Potter made his way down the path along the side of the road, hunched over with dark locks of a longer length blocking his face from view. Ten years of age, he was small, though his deceased parents were only average height, the years of neglect and abuse had taken residence in him, the effects now more prominent than the early years with the Dursleys.  </p>
<p>He had long given up hope for a better life, easier to accept what he had to face that whine about what he wished he could have right? After all it would never happen. He would never get away. </p>
<p>“Potter! Hey Potter!”</p>
<p>His feet sped before the ringing words fully reached his ears, instinct to run kicking in, their footsteps heavy and hard against the concrete behind him, only drowned by the cars passing. Panic was beginning to build, and he lifted the bag up to his chest, clutching his exercise books as tightly as he could, trying to ignore them. </p>
<p>If there was one thing anyone needed to know about Dudley Dursley, it was that he hated being ignored. Absolutely hated it. Possibly because all he’d ever known was his parents coming to his every beck and call, answering his every plea for attention and giving in to his every wants. </p>
<p>Harry was fast for his age, long used to, or at the very least attempting to, outrun his cousin and his gang. It always ended badly. Some days they caught up to him, their hands pushing him to the floor, their feet catching him in the stomach and their laughter, always their laughter ringing in his ears. Other days they didn’t, but then they would make up for it in the school playground the next day behind the bike-shed, or a small lie was all they needed to pass through Dudley’s lips and he would be locked away once more, no meals to feed his growling stomach. </p>
<p>He darted down an alleyway, now running as fast as his legs could carry him, taking every twist and turn he could find, until his hands connected with a wall, chest heaving with gasping breaths and adrenaline pumping through his body. He spun round, eyes widening, as five shadows seemed to model into one from the figures blocking his way. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was an ache that came with the bruises marring his skin, the most obvious was a clump of yellow and purple dotted down the side of his face covering his cheek, just missing his eye. </p>
<p>Aunt Petunia hadn’t been happy at the state of his face, the rips in his already undesirable clothes and the droplets of blood now staining on his exercise books. They had been dumped in a puddle and stamped upon, the ink spilling into black blotches and messed up blurs upon their pages. At least his Aunt had been kind enough to let them dry upon the radiator, although it more out of fear the neighbours would doubt their care, dare to doubt their capable hands. </p>
<p>Of course, it was still Harry's fault. He must have provoked Dudley, why else would their precious son lay a hand on the freak? </p>
<p>He’d spent the last two days in the confinement and the comfort in an odd twisted sort of way, of his cupboard, safer yet sadder than he should have been. Dudley would jump at every chance to stay home from school. Harry hated missing it; he sucked in knowledge, anything he might need to know to survive. Knowledge was power in a household that hated questions. </p>
<p>And now it was Thursday, and the bruises were beginning to fade, but a problem had developed over night. There was a draft coming from the attic, his Uncle Vernon too big to fit through the square hole in the ceiling and his Aunt Petunia certainly had no plans to tackle whatever might be up there. So it was left to Harry to sort out. </p>
<p>And by sort out, it meant being thrust up there and locking the latch from the other side. Just another reason to keep him out of the way. </p>
<p>Dust spiralled up as the latch clicked into place, and he coughed, scrambling away from the ladder attached to the pull down door. Harry stumbled, knocking into a cardboard box and winced, watching it tumble to the ground and spill baby toys across the floor. </p>
<p>The Attic was the size of the kitchen, but without all the cabinets, a fairly average size, caked in dust and cobwebs. It was stacked with cardboard boxes and ornaments wrapped in bubble wrap, with old trinkets that had lost their fashion and layers of clothes and blankets that may one day find their way to charity shop. </p>
<p>There was a dim orange light erupted over the room, casting a dance of shadows within the corners as he pulled gently on the thinning string, half expecting it to snap and plunge him into a blackening darkness. </p>
<p>A soft chill trickled in from somewhere, and he clutched the duck tape they had sent him up with, peering into the shadows. He started to shuffle some boxes, avoiding the dust that spiralled up in clouds and settled in the glow of the light. It didn’t take long to find, there was a crack within the wood, easy to duck tape up. He tapped on the door, knuckles stinging slightly, but no one came. </p>
<p>There was a ringing silence within the house.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>He called out, and knocked once more, swallowing the panic in his throat. </p>
<p>Silence. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He wasn’t sure how long it had been, huddled up awkwardly in the attic, no noise from below and no inkling if anyone would be back. His fingers fiddled with the hem of his ratty shirt, twisting the material between his fingers, tear tracks long since dried. </p>
<p>Cramp erupted in his knee, and he whimpered slightly, stretching his cramped muscles out. He rose to his feet a little unsteady, shaking his leg out and giving a large huff of relief as the pain disappeared. </p>
<p>What happened next was an accident, a fortunate, relieving accident. </p>
<p>His limb knocked into a stack of boxes, emerald eyes widening in horror as the shadows lurched forward and tumbled down around him. He staggered backwards, back scraping against cardboard, sharp edges slicing into his skin as something heavy fell across his legs; sending him flailing to the ground. </p>
<p>A loud thump echoed across the house, the empty solitude of the house. His body lay crumpled beneath the boxes, twisted awkwardly, and a thin trickle of blood slid down the side of his head. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Magic happened next. </p>
<p> </p>
