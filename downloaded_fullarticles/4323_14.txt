    <p>The quiet hamlet of Gessot-on-the-Mold prided itself on being one of the most boring places in Great Britain. Home to some 80 people, terrible weather, and a cobwebbed schoolhouse, one did not end up in Gessot unless one was lost, and one did not stay unless one enjoyed the company of bilious cane-swinging geriatrics. </p><p>The newspaper (aptly named Greene's Gessot as it was posted weekly in the Greengrocer's shop) did little more than mention deaths and the occasional birth. Once a small group of Chinese tourists had wandered in and the greengrocer's son had excitedly run a full colour feature. The tourists could not walk a foot before getting harangued by old folk with ancient cameras. With little prompting, Mr Heammet, the butcher, would proudly point his customers to a picture of himself with an arm around a very confused tourist hung over his counter. A mural was set up in the town square to commemorate the occasion, and the pub started having annual visitor's day discounts every 16th of September. Nothing ever happened in Gessot. </p><p>That was about to change. </p><p>The true born locals all agreed that it was The Professor's fault. While not strictly residents, she was  often seen trekking in the moors with her young daughter. The daughter was intolerable enough, being some sort of violin prodigy, and the old men having a pint would wince and shake their heads everytime the faint Mendelssohn could be heard. With Professor Hallen and her daughter came the internet, a mobile signal, hibiscus shrubs blooming out of nowhere in midwinter, floating dogs, and water that sparked and crackled until it set the village fountain on fire. </p><p>And now a blond haired stranger appearing out of nowhere and asking where Libra Hallen lived. He was middle aged, wore odd clothes, and obviously up to something. </p><p>Clearly something had to be done.</p>
