  <em> Another day, another dime </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Another dollar, another crime. </em>
</p><p>A pair of groggy green eyes open, only to be assaulted by a horrible bright light and a searing headache. Harry James Potter groans and turns onto his stomach, urging himself to get back to sleep. He is very much hungover and can already tell this week will be shit.</p><p>What were those words again? It sounded like a poem. Nowadays he finds his brain pulling odd words together at random intervals, perhaps offering him subconscious inspiration. God knows he could use that, his most recent project posing an unusually difficult challenge. He’ll write it--whatever <em> it </em>was--down when he officially wakes up. He has to have at least a few more hours until his afternoon class.</p><p>Harry knows this delusion is not true. If the light pouring from the blinds was any indication, it is well past 11:00, meaning that the moment he steals a glance at his clock will be the moment he is forced to get out of his soft, warm bed, rush into his clothes, and sprint out the door. He’d rather prolong this sleepy peace, even if it means he doesn’t have time to grab breakfast. Maybe hunger will offer a new point of view he can use for this stupid project. Somewhere in his thinking, he’s tossed around to stare at the shining red letters on the alarm clock.</p><p>Oh, and alarmed he is. The class starts in two minutes. It’s a five minute sprint from his apartment to campus, an added three minutes from the front gate to his class, in the very fucking farthest reaches of the school. If it were any other class, he would accept his fate and skip, but it’s Tuesday, and he will not miss his favorite class.</p><p>After jamming his glasses onto his face and taking four pills of advil (the bottle conveniently placed on his bedside table from his last morning hangover), Harry miserably drags himself out of bed and throws on one of his many work tee shirts, a pair of ragged jeans in a similar condition, and a dirty pair of black high tops. At least he doesn’t have to think about what he wants to wear today, the Tuesday class requires a specific set of clothes he doesn’t mind getting dirty. He slings his bag over his shoulder on the way out the door, cramming his wallet and a large water bottle into it at the last second.</p><p>The run to the Delanie School of Art and Design--a sub-campus of the main university--isn’t too bad. While his phone told him the weather would be just warm enough to be uncomfortable, Harry finds that a pleasant cloud cover helps keep the air mild, and a soft breeze ruffles his untamed hair.</p><p>He takes the stairs two at a time and bursts through the foggy glass door of classroom 3F just in time to see the five other students disbanding from a circle of chairs placed in the middle of the room. Harry’s heart sinks. They only have circle meetings when the professor actually has an announcement or instruction to give. Other than that, the students of 3F are free to spend the entire time working.</p><p>“Professor?” He calls tentatively, still standing in the doorway. A man standing in the center of the circle turns, feigning surprise.</p><p>“Oh, Harry! Nice of you to join us!” He responds, taking slow, long steps towards Harry, who smiles sheepishly. The professor is wearing what might have once been a smart white shirt, but after years of use the buttons have been broken and replaced by a myriad of multicolored stones, brooches, and other mismatched baubles that he picked up or fashioned himself. The shirt is only half tucked into his faded jeans, and sags off his thin, wiry frame. If not for the rainbow suspenders looped around his bony shoulders, his body would be lost within its wrinkled depths. He has large square glasses, the frames a rich amber. Behind the lenses, his eyes are a muddied hazel, garnished with crow’s feet and laugh lines across his sharp face. His hair is mousy brown and almost as messy as Harry’s, matching with his short beard and thick arm hair. His fingers are long and pale, and dried clay is stuck in his fingernails and the creases of his knuckles. His bare feet make soft tapping noises as he approaches Harry, still standing in the doorway.</p><p>“Sorry Professor, I slept in.” He mutters sheepishly, running a hand awkwardly through his hair. The Professor grins widely, showing off perfect white teeth.</p><p>“I can tell! You look like a wreck.” Harry rolls his eyes as a firm hand clasps around his shoulder. Professor guides him towards his desk to their right, which is shoved clumsily into the corner beside the whiteboard. Papers cling to the edges of the chipped golden wood, one breath away from toppling to the floor. Markers, pencils, rulers, and a few paintbrushes are scattered here and there, the multicolored plastic cups designated for each utensil lay long neglected to the left side of the desk, the orange one labeled “ballpoints” precariously balanced on the edge.</p><p>Professor disrupts the careful stillness by jarringly ripping open one of the top drawers and rummaging inside it’s messy depths.</p><p>“What we were discussing--ouch,” he tosses a pointy metal compass aside before continuing-- “before you finally decided to walk in was the most recent project.”</p><p>Harry breathes a sigh of relief. At least it wasn’t something new. He would’ve liked to be there to ask questions and hear the full explanation. Professor had a habit of accidentally leaving crucial bits of information out during a recounting, especially if it was something extremely important or fresh off the furnace of outrageous ideas that is his brain. The students quickly learned that it was always best to be there the first time around.</p><p>“As you know, I’m asking you to gain inspiration from music--where are those damn things…” He slams the drawer shut and moves on to the one beneath it before continuing, causing the yellow cup (This one labeled “dumb fucks,” which probably meant to hold colored pencils) to topple to the floor, “I understand that a few of the students are having trouble narrowing down your subject to one song--Aha! There they are!” Professor stands up quickly, waving two pieces of paper in the air. Harry’s stomach starts to churn with anxiety. It isn’t that he’s having trouble narrowing his song choices down, the problem is that he has nothing to choose from.</p><p>No one in his new life knows much about his old one. No one knows that he went through a war, no one knows that he and countless others that he loved were killed. Some close friends know that he had a troubling childhood, and that he had an accident resulting in him being scared of loud noises and giving him a bad habit of drinking himself silly at least once a week because his lucid nightmares are so much worse than his drunken ones. They also know that he can’t join them at night clubs because he’s afraid of music.</p><p>About six months ago, when he’d just moved into his dorm, he heard music for the first time. His roommate--a troll of a boy named Jonathan who always smelled like poorly concealed body odor and firewhiskey breath--invited him to go to a party with all the other freshmen. When they got there, the room was hot and the air was moist. It was dark save for a few multi colored flashing lights that whipped across the room from fixtures on the ceiling. As if the avada kedavra green and expelliarmus red lights weren’t bad enough reminders of the war, there was a heart-crushingly loud noise echoing from tall black speakers at the front of the room. The song started out with heavy, booming drum beats, and Harry immediately felt himself begin to panic. It sounded too much like the crumbling stone from the battle of hogwarts, the hollow thuds as the bodies of his friends hit the ground.</p><p>The sound shifted, however, to a more lighthearted and musical sort of sound. A woman’s voice floated over the crowd as people sang along, and his heart rate slowed. Although the woman sounded much like a robot, it wasn’t so bad. At one point Harry even started to enjoy himself, before someone shouted, “Here comes the drop!”</p><p>The drop? What was that? The music seemed to quiet down slowly but surely, as if it was fading out. He was baffled as to why everyone in the room seemed so excited for such a decline in energy.</p><p>Then all at once, he understood. The speakers went completely silent for a few tense moments, then everyone around him leaped into a roaring, jumping frenzy. The music pulsed through the crowd with renewed vigor, so loud and crashing that Harry could feel it in his bones. Everyone was screaming as the sounds of rocks toppling onto bodies crashed through the battlefield. Loud zapping noises from wands on all sides shot back and forth, and the flashing of spells left spots in his eyes. A flood of green light overtook him, and Harry screamed with terror, his fear swept up with the energy of the rest of the crowd.</p><p>He sprinted from the room, somehow managing to get himself back to his dorm. Fuck trying to be normal, fuck friends, fuck Hermione’s “muggle integration therapy,” fuck all of it. He was better off alone. By the end of the week he’d bought and moved into his apartment, well out of the way of his old dorm and that wretched Jonathan.</p><p>When Professor had announced the next assignment, Harry knew that he would be forced to either tell him--and therefore his classmates, who were the only people he felt he could be himself around--everything in order to get out of it, or fake the whole thing.</p><p>This “faking it” had turned out to be a lot harder than it sounded.</p><p>“I’ve decided to offer anyone who is interested an intriguing new musical point of view!” Professor continues. Harry snaps to attention, already mentally preparing a polite way to decline the offer. “These are tickets to the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra’s Friday night performances for the next three weeks. My wife and I are season ticket holders, but we won’t be able to make it until she gets back from visiting her sister in Connecticut. I thought I’d offer one of our struggling students the opportunity to attend.”</p><p>Harry looks thoughtfully at the tickets. He’d never considered classical music before. It’s supposed to be light and fancy-sounding, right? Probably nothing like that terrifying ‘dubstep’ from the party all those months ago. Perhaps this could be a good way to circumvent his dilemma?</p><p>“Aubry expressed an interest--”</p><p>“He can have them,” a girl with cherry red hair pulled into a loose ponytail calls from behind a large canvas, “I think I’ve found a good piano piece I’d like to try out.” She pokes her head out from behind it to grin at Harry, who shoots her a grateful smile. She has a small map of freckles across her thin, triangular nose, and her skin is slightly sunkissed, especially on her toned, muscular arms, which are exposed by a tight-fitting grey tank top. She’s wearing black sweatpants that say “SRIRACHA” on them, and her white running shoes have little specks of red paint all over them.</p><p>“What piece, Aubs?” Asks a smaller girl to Aubry’s right. The girl in question is working on a 6 foot wide canvas, but it’s only about a foot and a half tall. Rather than sit on her stool, she prefers to stand. Despite this, her birdlike frame still falls about one inch shorter than everyone else sitting. She’s wearing a gigantic pink sweater that Harry helped her pick out from the thrift store, and robin’s-egg-blue colored shorts that are all but consumed by the long hem of her sweater. Her skin and clothes are in the worst shape, paint-splatter wise. Chunks of green and blue are tangled in her short, espresso brown curls, with part of her bangs sticking to her forehead in yellow. The sleeves of her sweater are rolled up to her shoulders, revealing thin, pale arms and delicate fingers coated entirely in blue and green and white. Her bare feet and legs have swipes of paint across them that look almost deliberate.</p><p>Aubry smiles warmly. “The ‘Dear’ one you showed me,” she replies. The short girl--Lucy--returns her smile brightly.</p><p>“Isn’t it just breathtaking?” Lucy says dreamily. Her round cheeks and button nose warm slightly as they begin a passionate discussion about the ins and outs of the musical phrases. Harry’s attention returns to the professor.</p><p>“Well then,” He says, “is it alright if I take them?”</p><p>“Sure thing, bucko!” Professor hands him the tickets and ushers him towards his own station, next to a boy named Arch. “Until then, you better get brainstorming for your next piece. It’s another choice one coming up. Maybe you can get a head start on it while you’re waiting for the performance?”</p><p>Harry scrambles over to his easel, throwing himself onto the stool with such zeal that it almost topples. “Yes Professor! Sorry again that I was late!”</p><p>Harry’s station is in the opposite corner as the professor’s desk, and he absolutely adores it. Since it’s in the corner, he has two walls to work on instead of just one, and it gives him the flexibility he needs to make his work. The Arts building is plain, with boring white walls and tiles, and bright fluorescent lights to simulate natural light. The students fill it with wonder. The walls are covered by sketches, random doodles, and sometimes full murals. Only Juniors and above are allowed to decorate the main hallway walls, but in each classroom each student has their own workspace where they have the walls all to themselves. 3F, in Harry’s opinion, is the most wonderful. Not only is Professor an incredible artist and teacher, but the students are absolutely brilliant, each having their own strengths.</p><p>Arch portrays movement and fluidity through his pieces so immaculately that you almost feel yourself wrapped up with the characters within, leaping or reaching or climbing right next to them. Aubry is a quick learner with all manner of mediums, and she shows it. She can use an odd mix of broken CDs, torn out dictionary pages, oil pastels, and graphite to create chaotically beautiful works of art. Lucy is an excellent emotional painter, and a master of creativity and colors. Harry once was on edge for an entire day after taking just a brief look at a of hers piece about anxiety. The other two members of his class, Hyeouk (HK) and Damian are technical masters. HK specializes in black and white, Damian’s colored pencils seem to come alive on the page. All together, the room is a magnificent mess. Harry couldn’t be happier.</p><p>“Forget to set your alarm again?” Arch asks, leaning over to smirk at Harry as he unloads his supplies and places them in their appropriate places. Harry smiles grimly and shakes his head.</p><p>“Nope, hangover.” He replies. Arch’s smirk turns into a sympathetic smile. His brownish-black eyes glimmer with kind pity. Arch is gigantic. Everything about him seems to be twice everyone else’s size, much opposed to Lucy, who seems to be half of a normal person. His hands are long, like spider’s legs, which stretch up to muscular arms and broad shoulders. Standing at six feet eight inches tall, he’s learned how to grow into his size. Today he wears a mustard yellow tee shirt that stretches across his muscular trunk, and navy blue shorts showing off espresso-colored legs, and a massive pair of caramel colored high tops. His hair is short and clings to his skull in sharp lines around his forehead. He has full lips and a squarish nose, framed by sharp cheekbones, which are dusted with a rich golden highlighter. Harry’s heart fills for his classmates. One of his favorite parts of being an art student is that no one cares if you look different, or if you break certain gender roles. Everyone has their own artistic voice, and everyone somehow applies that voice into every part of their lives--including their physical appearance.</p><p>“Hang in there, buddy. And call me next time, I can try to help you get to bed without any of that.” Arch says kindly. Harry nods, and Arch, satisfied, turns back to his dizzying painting of hip-hop dancers twisting themselves into fascinating shapes.</p><p>Pulling out his sketchbook and grabbing his pen from his bag, Harry begins to sketch. He’d discovered his love for art because of Hermione. Apparently he’d been ‘closing himself off’ and he was ‘depressed,’ so she suggested he try to let out his ‘negative feelings in a positive and constructive way,’ and ‘apply a creative outlet.’ Harry, unimpressed though wanting to keep Hermione’s therapeutic antics at bay, decided to give painting a try. There were never any art classes at Hogwarts, and before that, well…</p><p>After his first terrible painting, he knew that he’d discovered something wonderful. Through careless abstraction and symbolism he learned to spit his feelings onto the paper with ease, and it was so much more than just a relief to all his friends, they could now see clearly what he had failed to express to them with words. What really happened at King’s Cross, how dark it was every night seventh year, how he still hurt inside no matter how well he tried to hide it.</p><p>It was nice at first, watching everyone’s sympathy turn into empathy, but he soon found their pity unbearable. Even Ron, the only friend who always understood him, treated him like a delicate china cup, as if he could break at any moment. Though surrounded by loved ones, he still felt very much alone.</p><p>So to college he went. He submitted a few of his better pieces to a college across the world, Los Angeles, California, and was accepted into their arts program. Life was better. He had new friends, and while he still kept in touch with the old ones, he knew that life was going on without him. Ron and Hermione had two kids now, and Teddy was more than happy to stay with “Grandma Molly” at the burrow until Harry graduated. Harry’s heart hurt sometimes, however, when he realized that his godson might know less of his own godfather than anyone else.</p><p>By the time class was up, Harry was well on his way to perfecting his next idea. He wished he could just skip this music assignment altogether and get on with the Choice (every other project was a freebie, the students were allowed to draw whatever they wanted to build their portfolios), but he knew that he’d have to get it done somehow. At least now he didn’t have to try to pretend.</p><p>Lucy skips out of the classroom quickly--“I’ve got Chem after this and I CAN’T. FUCKING. FAIL.”--With Aubry hot on her trail. Arch takes his time getting ready--“Basketball practice, man. If I have an excuse me to  get there late, I will.”--But Harry, Damian, and HK have free periods before their evening classes, so they usually linger in the art room to keep working. Harry wanders over towards HK, who’s bent over his work, his pencil moving frantically across the page in large, scribbling strokes. Harry whistles lowly.</p><p>“That looks great, HK. Taking a different approach?” He asks. HK looks up and grins wide. He’s half Korean, half Vietnamese, and his face is round, soft, and perpetually stuck in an amicable smile. His hair is dyed bright red, and pieces of it stick out at random from his navy blue hoodie. He’s just over five feet five inches tall, and he rocks an ‘intentionally ragged’ look, with clothes just a little bit too big for him, his red sneakers unlaced, jeans fraying at the cuffs, and a preposterous number of holes riddled across them. A faint dusting of charcoal eyeliner coats the rims of his upper and lower eyelids.</p><p>“Yeah, I wanted to try to incorporate some of Arch’s and Lucy’s weird shading styles to make it look a bit more frenzied,” He replies. Harry studies the piece. It’s on 18x24 drawing paper, and it pictures two figures pulling away from each other, but their shadows--which are drawn as gooey and dripping, this effect intensified by his varying levels of pencil pressure--are stuck together in a desperate embrace.</p><p>“It’s sort of about being in denial about your feelings, y’know? I kinda wanted to incorporate religious symbols in their clothes, but decided it would be too much. I just settled for making their hands like that--see?” HK gestures towards the two figures, who have their hands pressed flat together while facing away from each other. Their eyes are screwed shut in concentration.</p><p>“They’re praying,” Harry responds thoughtfully, although now a little confused. “Why did you want them to be religious?” HK looks at him, dumbfounded.</p><p>“Harry, they’re gay,” he responds plainly. Harry’s eyes widen, now looking at the piece with new light. Yes, he can see now, the two figures are very obviously male, one is slightly taller than the other, with clean blonde hair. The other has longer, messier black hair, and is hunched over himself slightly, whether it be because of guilt, heartache, anger, or a mix of all three, Harry wasn’t sure. The shadows between them cling to each other desperately, melting together in dripping, scribbly anguish.</p><p>“They look so…” Harry struggles for the right word, but there isn’t one. “...sad,” he finishes lamely. HK shrugs noncommittally, but Harry can see he looks a little bit uncomfortable.</p><p>“Yeah, I mean, it wasn’t a very great place to be,” Harry’s eyes snap over to HK, who has returned to his crazed scribbling, but he looks distracted and a bit nervous.</p><p>“This is about you?!” Harry asks, his eyes quickly returning to the canvas in front of him. Now he can clearly see, through the hunched posture of the shorter boy, HK’s soft cheekbones, smallish, round nose, and thin eyes, pooling with hurt. His usually smiling lips are pulled into a snarl of frustration and torment. HK nods solemnly.</p><p>“Who’s the other boy?!” Harry cries. HK’s mouth curls into a loose, lazy sort of smirk, and he leans way back in his chair.</p><p>“Damian,” HK responds. Harry whirls around to face the other boy sitting behind him, who had been quietly working during the whole exchange, Harry almost forgot he was even there.</p><p>“Yep, that’s me,” Damian says without removing his indigo eyes from the canvas he was working on. He appeared like he was trying not to laugh. Harry was at a loss for words. Turning back to HK, he noticed a poorly concealed giggle escape from his mouth before HK managed to pull a straight face.</p><p>“I thought… I thought you guys didn’t know each other until college…?” At this, Damian and HK’s resolve completely crumbles, and before Harry can react Damian is on the floor and HK has fallen back in his chair so far it nearly tips, hysterical laughter filling the echoey room. Harry is still terribly confused. “What’s so…?”</p><p>“He’s not the one the picture is about, Harry!” HK responds, trying and failing to pull himself together. “He’s just the reference image!”</p><p>“Yeah, Harry, I love ya, but do you really think we could fly all the way back to Texas to get an actual photo of the guy?” Damian adds, pulling himself up from the ground. “Hello, sir, excuse me me? Your forbidden gay ex-lover is here to take pictures of you. Say hi to the ‘rents for me!” At this sarcastic comment, HK and Damian dissolve into another fit of giggles, and Harry can’t help but chuckle along with them.</p><p>“Alright, alright, calm down dickfaces, it isn’t <em> that </em>funny,” Harry says, but there’s no hardness in his voice.</p><p>“Easy for you to say,” HK gasps, “you didn’t see your face!” Harry rolls his eyes, turning his attention away from the red-haired boy and towards Damian, who is still giggling slightly, and Harry thinks his tanned cheeks must be aching from all that stupid grinning.</p><p>Damian is the exact opposite of HK, appearance wise. He’s a south California native, so his skin is tanned a deep golden color at all times in the year. During the summertime, you can faintly see freckles that develop on his thin nose, defined cheekbones, and arms, but on a cloudy November day such as this one they’re nowhere to be found. His hair is sandy blond, and he claims that it used to be a reddish-brown color before the sun beat it out of him. His eyes are strikingly blue, and so dark they almost seem purple. He’s built like a track racer, with long, thin limbs and a flat stomach. He’s relatively toned, but his only exercise is year-round surfing, so he has more muscle on his legs than anything else. He’s in a pale yellow tourist shirt featuring the iconic “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas” sign, and--as a proud member of the university’s ridiculous 365 Shorts Club--baby blue swim trunks.</p><p>Of course, personality wise, the two boys sitting before Harry could be twins. They are nothing but 100% pure Hufflepuff material: kind, silly, sweet, and extremely hardworking, not to mention horrible liars. They’re also madly in love with each other, although neither of them can see it. Harry finds it infuriatingly adorable how both will blush and stutter awkwardly if they accidentally touch, or how they sometimes catch each other staring with what can only be described as ‘heart eyes.’</p><p>“What’s this one about?” Harry asks Damian, who is now working diligently on his canvas, though a small smile still ghosts his lips and his eyes still have a slight sparkle to them.  </p><p>“Dealer by Gemini Club,” the blond replies, leaning back in his stool so Harry can peek at the picture. It features a girl leaning over a sparkling chrome motorcycle as it races down a dusty road. He’s used purple and blue to emphasize the shadows, with orange and yellow as the highlights, so it looks like she’s riding at sunset, or maybe dawn.  Her shadow stretches behind her like a cape, rippling in dark blue across the rocky landscape. He’s only half done, but it still looks incredible. “The lyrics don’t exactly match the message, but I feel like the instrumentals sound like something you’d listen to while riding a motorcycle,” Damian explains. Harry nods.</p><p>“I’ve never heard it before, but the picture looks brilliant,” he says admirably. Damian’s tanned cheeks flush slightly with pride.</p><p>“Thanks,” he shrugs and turns to grab another pencil, “I like it too.”</p><p>Harry smiles excitedly. After just a month of spending hours upon hours with his artistic peers, he noticed that while all artists struggle with self-esteem issues, Damian seems to have it the worst. Every piece just isn’t good enough for him, and he has trouble accepting compliments. He once confided to the group during a circle meeting that his insecurity surrounding his art bled into other parts of his life, and he ended up ruining a lot of his relationships back home because he felt like the compliments his loved ones gave him were lies to make him feel better. He therefore started to worry that they lied about other things, such as being his friends in the first place. Hearing him say something positive about his own work, even as simple as “I like it too,” must have been an incredible feat for him.</p><p>“You should be!” Harry responds, perhaps a little too enthusiastically. The blond flinches and neary topples off his stool in surprise. Harry bites back a laugh, holding his hands out in apology. “Oh, god, sorry about that. I’ll leave you alone now.” Damian shakes his head and chuckles, but doesn’t protest. Harry returns to his station, a pit of dread now growing in his stomach.</p><p>Without his friends to distract him, he’s forced to turn his attention back to his blank canvas. He doesn’t want to think about the symphony on Friday, or how he’s going to paint a picture based purely off the memory of the songs, or if he’ll even be able to sit through it all--what if his guess is incorrect, and the music is just as loud and jarring as the electronic bullshit from that party?</p><p>After about an hour of sketching out some more ideas for his next choice piece, Harry packs up his tools and leaves the art room feeling better, but still slightly deflated. His mind has been whirling with all sorts of worst-case scenarios for Friday night, even with the distraction of his work. As much as he’s grateful for the professor introducing an option he wouldn’t have thought of otherwise, he can’t help but worry. What if he has another panic attack? There won’t be a ginormous crowd of drunk college students and air thick with bass to cover the sounds of his panicked crying and heavy breathing. It’ll just be hundreds, maybe even thousands of classical music fans listening silently to what would’ve been a pleasant evening if not for Harry. He doesn’t know how big the auditorium is, he tries to assure himself. He doesn’t even know if anyone still likes classical music! Sure, Professor and his wife are an exception, but they’re eccentric weirdos who also enjoy sewing and playing insanely competitive games of live action Battleship. Perhaps he’ll arrive at the symphony hall and be the only person there. Maybe they’ll even cancel the show because of low attendance. He wouldn’t get his musical inspiration, but perhaps Professor would benevolently extend the project’s deadline?</p><p>Or, an annoying voice in the back of Harry’s head taunts, you’ll be the only one there, so everyone in the symphony will watch you break down. As if to beat his own intrusive thoughts into submission, Harry buts the palm of his hand against his head as he marches down a cobbled path to his favorite café. There’s no proof that the music will even be triggering, so why is he worrying? Similar thoughts of attempted comfort are still doing their best to ease his troubled mind when he steps inside the heavy wooden doors.</p><p>The café is perfect, Harry thinks as he strolls inside, the smells of coffee and gingerbread filling his lungs. The warm air envelops him in an embrace akin to Molly Weasley’s. His nose, cheeks, and fingertips, chilly from the cooler outside air, are immediately rejuvenated as if someone has cast a warming charm. He can’t help the pleased grin that melts across his face as the anxious knots of worry begin to loosen in his brain.</p><p>This café has always felt like home. It’s semi-circular, and covering the round walls are tall, glossy windows framed by rich brown wood. Scattered lazily across the scuffed-up hardwood floors are seats varying from plush leather recliners to smooth wooden chairs. A few couches with lumpy pillows and downy blankets are pushed in the far corner, making a circle that friends can use to play games and eat together. The color scheme for the décor changes depending on the seasons and holidays, and since halloween has just ended the pumpkin-shaped throw pillows and linty purple “beware of ghosts” blankets have been replaced by amicable autumn decorations that remind Harry gleefully of the Gryffindor common room. There are small, circular tables for lone students looking for a change of scenery in their studying, and a taller boardroom style table in the center of the room surrounded by bar stools for bigger groups.</p><p>At the straight end of the semicircle is a long counter where you order at one end of the counter, then can follow along to the other end as the employees prepare your food behind a short glass partition. The employees work fast and effortlessly, and it fascinates Harry to see muggles working with almost the same efficiency as magic allows. After the war, Harry had bought a large flat for himself with every domestic magical shortcut the real-estate agent could shove down his throat. After living in a place where he didn’t have to move to go up the stairs or brush his own teeth, and lights, stoves, and faucets turned on to his personal preferences by themselves, he never thought he’d be able to live with the slow clumsiness of muggle methods again. His first visit to this café had been an extremely humbling experience and he now mourns the two years he had spent lazily allowing magic to do even the smallest of tasks for him, wishing instead that he had learned to flip twelve pancakes in less than two seconds like Carolynn—one of the café’s employees—can. Carolynn is the one to greet Harry as he approaches the far end of the counter to place his order.</p><p>“Hi, Harry!” She says cheerfully. Incredibly, the entire staff seems to have taken the time to memorize all of their regular customers’ names, and Harry is nothing if not a regular.</p><p>“Hey, Carolynn,” Harry replies, attempting to mimic her upbeat tone. “Can I have the veggie spring rolls with peanut sauce and a medium hot chocolate, please?” He asks as Carolynn punches his order into the cash register.</p><p>“Sure thing!” She replies, “would you like anything else?” She asks, already knowing the answer. Harry’s order has remained more or less the same since he first started coming here, sometimes he fluctuates hot chocolate flavors, and his entrée choice changes about every six months once he gets tired of ordering the same thing, but he keeps the general idea simple: a healthy meal so he doesn’t get out of shape, and the sweetest, creamiest drink on the menu. Carolynn turns and places the order receipt on the magnetic board to her left as Harry smiles and shakes his head.</p><p>“Then that’ll be—“</p><p>“7.79, got it!” Harry responds for her, already handing her a ten dollar bill. She smiles, and Harry can’t help but smile back. Carolynn is kind and beautiful, and Harry thinks may be in love with her.</p><p>She has long, glossy blond hair that falls in waterfalls from her ponytail and down her back. Her face is round like a cherub’s and her eyes are brown and kind, and when she smiles they sparkle and her cheeks turn pink. Her hands are deft and delicate, though covered in faint burn scars from what Harry can only assume to be pancake-flipping accidents. She makes Harry happy, and while they’ve never spoken outside the café, he doesn’t really think that matters.</p><p>His order arrives quickly, and he takes it to go sit down in one of the plush chairs and try to relax when an unwelcome thought occurs to him. What if the symphony does nothing? He has to have a backup, and he doesn't even have any ideas jotted down. Reluctantly spinning on his heel, Harry instead walks back out the doors and into the now uncomfortably cold evening air. He'll have to save his evening of relaxation for another date. For now, he has a fake piece to plan.</p>
