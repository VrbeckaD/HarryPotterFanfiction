  <b>19 September 1979</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Parkinson Manor</b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Hand her over to me...Please, I just want to see my baby." The mother begged. Her hands reached out to the midwife, desperate for her wish to be fulfilled. But soon enough, her frail body gave in, and the tears flowed freely as she watched her baby being whisked away to another room.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her husband sat by her side on the edge of the bed, clutching one hand of hers in his, while the other softly wiped her tears away.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"You need to rest, darling. You'll have plenty of time with our little girl once you get your energy back." He reassured her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She smiled up at him despite her momentary sorrow. Her face was pale, but it glistened with the sweat that manifested during her hours of painful labour.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Scourgify." He muttered, pointing his wand at his wife, and successfully erasing all the  messy memories of child-birth. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He watched as the light in his wife's eyes began to dim, until finally, she fell unconscious to the rest of the world.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Goodnight, my love." He whispered, giving her a tender kiss on the top of her head.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>For a while, he just sat there. He stared at his wife in adoration, and thanked Merlin for blessing them with a healthy baby girl.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>All the while, when the midwife entered the nursery, cradling the baby in her arms, she felt the poking of a wand on the back of her neck.</span>
</p>
<p><span>"Make a sound, and I'll end your life right </span><em><span>here</span></em><span>." The mysterious perpetrator threatened.</span> </p>
<p>
  <span>The midwife gasped in fear; not only for her life, but for the baby as well. She heard the man cast a silencing charm in the room.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Who are you? How'd you even get inside? There are wards—" She whispered fervently, but stopped when she felt the trespasser dig his wand deeper into her skin.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Did your mistress have a daughter?" The man asked, "Answer me! Now!" He demanded impatiently.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Y-yes. Mistress was blessed with a baby girl." She stuttered as she quivered in place with the baby securely clutched against her chest.</span>
</p>
<p><span>"Hand her over to me." The man ordered, walking over so that he was now in front of her.</span> </p>
<p>
  <span>"If it's money you want, the Parkinsons will pay you." The midwife reasoned, shamelessly just trying to survive this madman.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man scoffed, "Oh it's money I want all right. But not the Parkinson's.” He sneered in the dark.  “Now give </span>
  <em>
    <span>her </span>
  </em>
  <span>to me." He demanded yet again. Knowing there was no use in arguing, she carefully placed the baby in the man's arms.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Please don't hurt her. She's just a baby." The midwife cried.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Imperio." He whispered; his wand aimed at the defenseless midwife. "Don't worry, love. I'll be back. Don't move, but by all means, make all the sound you want." He cackled.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And with that, the man apparated out of the room, and disappeared before the woman's tear-stained eyes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Muggle London</b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Doctors and patients stared as a woman in dark robes calmly walked out of the hospital, cooing at baby in her arms. The glamour she used on herself showed the Muggles what she wanted them to see, just a loving mother taking her newborn home. But in reality, she was far from Muggle...Or </span>
  <em>
    <span>loving</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When they turned their heads to get another look at her, she was gone into the night.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She appeared outside of the Muggle hospital. The sky was a black canvas, donned with millions of shimmering stars. It was quite a beautiful night. Ironic however, considering what was about to happen.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Do you have her?" The dark-robed woman asked as she approached a man also clothed in dark robes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Of course, my love. You know how </span>
  <em>
    <span>easily</span>
  </em>
  <span> I can get pass their wards." The man gloated, clutching the Parkinson’s baby in his arms.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Take this filth off my hands." She sneered in disgust, motioning to the Muggle baby in her arms.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man and woman exchanged babies. And just like that, the babies' fates were sealed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Take that Muggle back to the Parkinson’s, and meet me back at our Manor, my love." She instructed him, "Today's been such a tiring day." She moaned as she apparated back inside the hospital.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Inside the hospital nursery, the woman placed the baby down into the empty bassinet. "This isn't personal, little one." She whispered to the little girl, "I hope you do enjoy your life as-" She paused to look at the name tag hanging from the side of the bassinet, "Hermione Granger." The woman laughed at the mundane name, and disappeared into thin air.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Back in Parkinson Manor</b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man appeared in front of the midwife once again. But this time, he was clutching a different baby in his arms.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>All babies looked the same to everybody else, but the midwife knew. She knew it wasn't the same baby she helped birthed earlier that night. She watched as the man placed the baby down into her bassinet. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Told you I'd be back, love." The man said cheekily. "Hope you didn't miss me too much." He laughed. He was a sick man.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Per his instruction from earlier, she hadn't moved an inch. Unfortunately for her, he wasn't gone for too long.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Hope you understand what I'm about to do. Can't have anyone knowing what happened here tonight." He told the midwife, as he took his wand out, and began performing memory charms on her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When he was satisfied with his work, he released her from the Unforgiveable curse, and once again, disappeared out of the room.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The midwife shook her head in confusion, wondering why she was standing in the middle of the room, instead of tending to the Parkinson's newborn baby.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Nonetheless, she headed over to the baby's bassinet and soothed her to sleep. As she gently rocked the baby to sleep, her Master walked into the room.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"How's my little girl?" He asked, smiling down at the sleeping form.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"She's perfect, Mr. Parkinson. Have you thought of a name, Sir?" She asked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Pansy." He smiled. "Pansy Parkinson."</span>
