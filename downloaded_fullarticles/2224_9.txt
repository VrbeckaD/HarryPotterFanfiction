  <em>Nurmengard</em>
</p><p>	“Happy birthday,” Grindelwald muttered to himself, standing in front of the Mirror of Erised. Once again, the enchanted mirror was about to show him the most desperate desire of his heart. Grindelwald fought back a sob when he saw Albus Dumbledore in the mirror. He didn’t desire money or power, the blond wizard wanted to love and feel loved.</p><p>	Grindelwald knew he would never feel this feeling again and now tears streamed down his face. He hated crying, but he couldn’t help it. He never felt so alone in his entire life. </p><p>	All his existence was an incredible mistake and there was no coming back for him. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Hogwarts</em><br/>
<em>Dumbledore’s classroom</em>
</p><p>	Dumbledore stared at a picture of Grindelwald and felt his heart ache. He still loved his enemy with all his heart and soul. “Happy birthday, my love…” he said, closing his eyes. </p><p>	He was so lost in his thoughts that he had not seen Minerva McGonagall cross the classroom. Noticing the surprise in her eyes, he hoped she had not heard him. “Hi, I didn’t see you coming…” he muttered in shame.</p><p>	Minerva smiled at him. She considered Dumbledore a friend and she was curious to know who was <em>his love</em>. “I noticed… So… Who’s she?” </p><p>	Dumbledore’s face instantly flushed pink. There was no <em>she</em> in his life. He had a forbidden and tragic love which was doomed from the beginning. <em>Yes, it was complicated like this.</em>“Minerva…”</p><p>	Curiosity got the best of Minerva and she did something Albus wasn’t expecting. “Accio,” she said and the picture came to her hand.</p><p>	Albus rose from his chair, his face flushing even more. He wondered what excuse he could use so Minerva would believe him. “It’s not what you’re thinking…”</p><p>	“Grindelwald?” she frowned in confusion. “How… Oh... I… I’m so sorry,” she apologized, placing the picture over Albus’ desk. </p><p>	Albus lowered his head. “Now you know my secret,” he took the picture in his hand and stared at it. “There’s no <em>she</em>… There’s only him… and it hurt,” he confessed.</p><p>	Minerva cleared her throat. “I had no idea… Oh, Albus,” she stared at him and sighed. </p><p>	“A bit shocking, huh?” Dumbledore faked a smile. “The great and brilliant wizard Albus Dumbledore loves the evil Gellert Grindelwald… Albus Dumbledore, the perfect idiot…”</p><p>	“You’re not an idiot,” Minerva said softly. She felt incredibly guilty right now. <em>Why did she  have to be so curious?</em></p><p>	“Yes, I am… Because despite of everything he has done to me, I’m here staring at his picture, wondering how he’s feeling today, wondering if he’s feeling lonely or scared in that castle…” Dumbledore sighed heavily. “But a side of me wants to hurt him so bad… I sent the Mirror of Erised to Nurmengard,” he confessed. </p><p>	“What?” Minerva didn’t understand. <em>Why would Albus send the mirror to Nurmengard?</em></p><p>	“I sent the mirror to Nurmengard, because I wanted to hurt Grindelwald… The mirror will always show him what he can’t have!” he said, with a strain of bitterness in his voice. <em>Oh, he wanted to torture Gellert, as much as he wanted to have him in his arms one more time. He couldn’t deny it.</em> “He wants power, but he can’t have it! Not anymore!”</p><p>
  Minerva rubbed the back of her neck. “Are you sure?”
</p><p>
  “What?” Dumbledore frowned.
</p><p>
  “Are you sure the mirror will show this to him?” Minerva asked.
</p><p>
  	“What else the mirror would show him, Minerva?” Dumbledore asked, with a shake of head. <em>Obviously he was sure. Grindelwald only cared about power. Of course the mirror would show him ruling the world or something like this.</em>
</p><p>
  “Who knows?” Minerva smiled. “Maybe you should see him…”
</p><p>
  Albus swallowed hard. <em>No, he couldn’t see him, he couldn’t. No after everything that happened.</em> “I can’t… I…”
</p><p>
 “Why not?” Minerva asked softly. “I was hearing you talk about him and I felt so much pain in your words. It’s like you felt both, love and hate. I think you need closure… I think you should go to Nurmengard and see him."
</p><p>
  Albus breathed heavily. Minerva was right, he needed closure. He needed to find Gellert and talk to him one last time. He needed to come to terms with the fact that he would never have Gellert in his arms again.
</p><p>
  <em>	He needed to go to Nurmengard.</em>
