Why did you have to—ugh, if you want to punch me, at least wait until Filch isn’t fucking looking!”</p><p>“Oh, excuse me,” Malfoy retorted, “How dare I ruin the Saviour’s plans for the evening? How very rude of me, indeed.” He scrubbed a spot from the tile more forcefully than was strictly necessary. “It’s not like I didn’t have anything better to do than be stuck with you with my hands full of—”</p><p>“Just shut up, will you?! I don’t care. This is your fault, I don’t want to have to listen to you on top of that.”</p><p>“My fault!” Malfoy spluttered. “You called me <em> ferret</em><em>!</em>”</p><p>“You <em> punched me!</em>”</p><p>“Only because you called me a—!”</p><p>“Well you are one! A stinky, bratty, idiotic ferret!”</p><p>Harry rolled on his side when Malfoy launched himself at him, fists at the ready. Gripping his wrists, Harry kicked Malfoy in the stomach.</p><p>Malfoy yelped, struggling to get free. “Prick!”</p><p>“Twat,” Harry grunted, kicking him again.</p><p>Malfoy almost doubled over. “I—<em> ughh</em>, I hate you!”</p><p>“Well I hate you more!”</p><p>“No you don’t!” Malfoy yelled right in Harry’s face. “You <em> don’t!</em>”</p><p>Caught off guard, Harry hesitated. Malfoy freed his wrists from his grip, but Harry just stared at him as they both panted, neither making the next move.</p><p>“What—”</p><p>“Forget it,” Malfoy said. “Just—forget it.”</p><p>“No. What do you mean?”</p><p>“I—” Malfoy swallowed, a pale tinge of pink spreading down his cheeks to his neck. “You—you spoke in my trial. You said—things.” He frowned, looking away. “Look, let’s just—”</p><p>“No.” Harry sat up. Malfoy leaned back, startled, but Harry just sighed. “I spoke in your behalf because I don’t think you’re a criminal. That doesn’t mean I can’t think you’re an asshole and a ferret. You are.”</p><p>Malfoy huffed. “Prick,” he said, though with less sentiment than before.</p><p>“Twat,” Harry repeated.</p><p>“Imbecile.”</p><p>“Ferret.”</p><p>“You little—!”</p><p>This time, when Harry grabbed Malfoy’s wrists, it was with a smirk.</p></div>
