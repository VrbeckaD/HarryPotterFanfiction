  <span>“Don’t feel bad, Malfoy, you’re worth one twelfth of me, and that’s quite something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco choked on his tea, and looked around to see Longbottom settle on the couch next to him with a…  Merlin, was that a flirtatious expression? On Longbottom? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It looked good. It had no right to look that good on him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Piss off!” he hissed, putting his cup on the side table, in case the oaf did something else outrageous. He didn’t want to waste any more tea, it was brewed to perfection.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The shared common room was empty, and Draco was glad, because he had the sneaking suspicion his cheeks were turning pink. Traitors. Just because Neville had spent all summer helping repair the castle, and the greenhouses, and turned into quite the specimen, did not give his cheeks the right to flush.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You need to stop moping about. It brings everyone else’s mood down too,” Longbottom said, leaning closer. “If you need help lifting your mood…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco stared at him as he trailed off with a raised eyebrow, wishing his heart wasn’t racing, and his breathing hadn’t quickened. Merlin, the oaf looked good. And Merlin, that boldness. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bloody buggering hell. He couldn’t stop himself from leaning forward, and snogging the stupid expression right off his face.</span>
