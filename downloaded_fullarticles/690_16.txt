</center><p> </p><p>“Hermione.”</p><p><br/><br/>She knew by the abruptness of his tone that it was time for her medicine.</p><p><br/><br/>She turned her head, looking over her shoulder at the looming wraith that was her husband. He’d known how to inspire fear once; in her, and her peers. Indeed, the only person besides Dumbledore who hadn’t been afraid of him was McGonagall, Hermione thought with fondness; a smile toying with her lips.</p><p><br/><br/>Now, she only felt warmth when she saw him.</p><p><br/><br/>“Tea, Severus?” She asked, reaching for the floral bowl that held a towering pile of sugar cubes. She used silver prongs to drop two of them into her teacup; thrilled at her ability to do so, before absently spotting at the tea that sloshed over the side. She hadn’t been able to grasp the prongs days before, her hand too unsteady.</p><p><br/>She hadn't been able to hide it before Severus had added another bitter phial to her medicine. "One for your control," He'd said, making no further comment on her weakness; something she appreciated. He never made her feel weak; not when he took her flailing arm, without a word, and led her to the shower, and toweled her off after; briskly, before kissing her soundly, as if she were a normal, whole woman. He could be kind, kinder than anyone knew; in his own understated way.</p><p><br/>She didn't look up as her husband settled across from her, instead of busying herself with making his cup. She knew how he liked it; his tastes unchanging. Two sugars and a dash of milk, she told herself firmly. Two sugars and a dash of milk.</p><p><br/><br/>Across from her, he stirred. “Hermione?”</p><p><br/><br/>She glanced up, realizing she’d said it aloud. “Ah-" He raised his crooked brow.</p><p><br/><br/>“I’m a bit tired,” she said. “Rose kept me awake last night chasing the moonlight.” At the sound of her name, the kneazle swished its tail, before rolling on her back and nipping at her mistress’s feet. “She bumped into the bookshelves and knocked over a lamp-" she sipped her tea, hiding her smile in her drink. Rose was curious and bold; traits suspiciously similar to her owner.</p><p><br/><br/>She couldn’t be angry, not with the full kneazle that was always at her side. She’d been a present from Harry (yes, she thought, Rose was from him. Harry - her friend.) after her familiar Crookshanks had passed.  Rose was a shocking ball of grey and white fluff; her mane as righteous as her mistress's, and meow just as loud and demanding.</p><p><br/><br/>His head shook.</p><p><br/><br/>“I found you asleep outside,” Severus said, his tones clipped. “Ankle deep in the snow and in your nightgown. If Rose hadn’t alerted me with her incessant meowing-" He inhaled, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I suggest you find warmer accommodations, Hermione.”</p><p><br/><br/>Her smile faltered, and she lowered her teacup.</p><p><br/><br/>“Oh.”</p><p><br/><br/>She couldn’t hide the way her cheeks flamed with an abject feeling of failure; her excursion into the snow something she couldn’t remember. Her ankle rubbed against the other; only then did Hermione notice the way her skin was chafed, and red; the lingering burns from frostbite.</p><p><br/><br/>“Would you care? If I’d stayed out there?”</p><p><br/><br/>She wasn’t supposed to ask things like that. His lips curled downwards into his trademark sneer. “Surely you know the answer to that.” Somehow, his words lacked their fiery bite.</p><p><br/><br/>She didn’t flinch, not from him. “Do I?”</p><p><br/><br/>He didn’t reply; turning his head with a snort. (Why?)</p><p><br/><br/>“I didn’t mean to leave,” Hermione said. She didn’t want to fight, not when he was so close to her. He’d storm away from her when he was upset; his hands fisted at his sides, and his back to her. She knew he’d go to his laboratory, or to the gardens, and that he’d come back. Or she’d find him; throwing her arms about his stiff back and press her cheek against the silky fabric of his robes; apologizing, and he’d turn; taking her into his arms while chiding her.  </p><p><br/><br/>“Silly girl,” He’d murmur. “I’m here.”</p><p><br/><br/>He always was, she’d reminded herself. He wouldn't leave her without a word.</p><p><br/> Still, the fear persisted, niggling like a worm when they fought. She felt his knees near hers; the table just large enough for both of them. "I don't-" She paused, chewing on the inside of her lip. "I thought I saw something out there. Someone,” She inclined her head toward the bay window. “Neville.” She decided.</p><p><br/><br/>“Longbottom?”</p><p><br/>"Yes," she said as if it was perfectly normal. It was, she thought, her normal. "It looked like Neville - he was clutching something in his hand - flowers? That he wanted me to see." Flowers carved from newly fallen snow, their petals glowing beautifully bright. "He wasn't there at all, was he?" She asked softly.</p><p><br/><br/>“Your storytelling lacks eloquence,” Severus drawled. “Longbottom would hardly be out in the midst of a snowstorm.” His hands trembled as he flicked lint off his cravat. “If you’d said Potter or Weasley, I may have believed you. No, Longbottom was snug in his bed,” his tone dripped with sarcasm. “The same as you should have been.”</p><p><br/><br/>She reached for his cup, carefully pouring tea into it, before glancing at Severus. His eyes were harsh like obsidian; hard and unyielding, and beautiful too. “Three sugars and a dash of milk,” She said aloud.</p><p><br/> She knew she'd gotten it wrong when he dipped his head forward and slid his hand across the table; phials of amber-colored liquid beneath his fingers. He didn't need to instruct her.</p><p><br/><br/>She took the bottles; one, two, three vials of bitterness and uncorked them, before downing them in the right order. One for her heart, one for her head, and one for her shaking hands and tongue that lolled about in her mouth, as numb as it could be, and bleeding at the end from her sharp teeth. Severus had had to bandage her tongue once; using bandages as if he were a Muggle and made her shakes that she drank through a straw. She still could taste the remnants of cotton on her tongue; the taste burned into her taste buds. No, she never missed a day of her medicine; wanting to be better, no, wanting to be the<em> best</em> she could.</p><p><br/><br/>“Thank you,” She said, before pausing. “Severus.”</p><p><br/><br/>His hand stayed on the table, tantalizingly close to hers, before withdrawing. “You have little reason to thank me, Hermione.”</p><p><br/><br/>She did. She <em>knew</em> she did, her brow knitting.</p><p><br/><br/>Her mind was clouding, and she wanted to drift; her arms wide and spread in the deep, blue sea. Drifting through memories was normal, Snape said. It was nothing to be afraid of; lest it turn into a Boggart. Her professor was smart; smarter than anyone really knew, the potions entirely his own. They were going to cure her; transforming her from the inside out from something.</p><p><br/><br/>Something she didn’t want to know.</p><p><br/>She shook her head, clinging to what she wanted to tell him before she slipped away. "You've done so much to help me," Hermione replied, motioning to the phials (Oh! How she hated them as they stung her throat and nipped at every crevice of her intestines, pulling them apart.) that she needed; regardless of whether she wanted them.</p><p><br/><br/>They let her live again.</p><p><br/><br/>“How many rounds of potions did it take until my hands stopped shaking? You never-" She nibbled at her lip. “You never complained, not once, even when I vomited on your shoes and couldn’t get out of bed for days. I know you don’t like when I say things like this, sir- “</p><p><br/><br/>She knew her professor; the dour, waspish man that excelled at potions with a skill unparalleled. He’d always said her essays were too lengthy (“How is it, Miss Granger, you use every adjective and noun known to man, yet fail to make a point?”) and her thoughts too broad. But she wanted to thank him; she <em>did</em>, even if he snarled and snapped.</p><p><br/><br/>“You turned the pages when I couldn’t - I thought I’d go mad if I couldn’t read again. You knew that, didn’t you?” Her eyes focused on the table, laden with half-opened books and the remnants from their tea. They always cleaned up together, their house free of house-elves. “I think you did, though you’d say I was an ignorant know it all- “</p><p><br/><br/>She giggled, the sound feeling right in her mouth.</p><p><br/><br/>Immediately she covered her mouth with her fingers, realizing that she’d laughed in front of Snape. Her professor! She waited for him to snap and snarl, her eyes darting downward. “Sorry, professor - “</p><p><br/><br/>“Miss Granger,” He interrupted her, his mouth twisting funny about the words. It was how he’d always addressed her, she thought, why was it different now? “Would you do the same for me?”</p><p><br/><br/>She blinked, her fingers lowering. “I’d do anything for you, Professor.”</p><p><br/><br/>He’d laid down his life to protect them - Harry, Ron, and herself - from an errant werewolf, and later, the Dark Lord and his pet, Nagini. Her arm burned when she thought of it, and her lips trembled as she remembered Snape laying in a pool of his own blood, and Harry’s hand pressed to his gushing neck. She couldn’t remember what happened after, how Snape had survived, not by herself; her own memories were vacant, echoing caverns when she tried to remember; throwing her questions (What happened? What had Snape done?) back at her.</p><p><br/> That was why she had Harry's letter, his much read and bedraggled letter, folded into squares and tucked into her skirt pocket. She read it when she couldn't remember when she <em>wanted</em> to remember.</p><p><br/><br/>‘<em>You stayed with him, Hermione,</em>’ Harry’s bold handwriting said. ‘<em>Using every healing spell that you knew (Episky! Episky!) until You-Know-Who was dead, and we could come back- didn’t want him to die alone‘ </em></p><p><br/><br/>‘A miracle- You never gave up on him, ‘Mione. Sorry! I know you hate that nickname but-‘</p><p><br/><br/>‘He was on our side the whole time.’</p><p><br/><br/>His hands were on her then, his gentle fingers wrapped about her wrists. He was crouched before her; a figure swathed in black, and his eyes relentlessly piercing hers. “Did I go-“</p><p><br/><br/>“You did.”</p><p><br/><br/>She shifted, looking back to the table where the bowl of sugar was upturned, and the teapot cracked; tea running like a mud-colored river across the table. Tea was the only thing she could make for Snape after she'd left the gas stove on, and let the eggs burn until they caught fire; steamrolling throughout the cottage. Snape had found her standing next to the stove, an absent look on her face and her lips silently moving; reciting the ingredients for Amorentia. "I'm sorry- "</p><p><br/><br/>She was supposed to do something; something for him.</p><p><br/><br/><em>Two sugars</em>-</p><p><br/><br/>His grip tightened. “You shouldn’t.”</p><p><br/><br/>“Sir?” She blinked, looking at his paling face. His <em>anguished </em>face. (Why? Why was he upset? Her fingers trembled, wanting nothing more than to smooth his furrowed brow.)</p><p><br/><br/>“You shouldn’t do anything for me, foolish girl.” He lifted her hand to his lips, brushing kisses across her knuckles. They were kisses that burned, and she sucked in a breath as his lips caressed her pinky finger. He took the tip of her finger into his mouth; nibbling and fondling it with his tongue, before letting it go. She felt he’d done it before; done something <em>more. </em></p><p><br/><br/>“Please,” she wanted to say, instead of biting her tongue. “Show me what I’m missing.”</p><p><br/><br/>Her toes tingled and curled inside of her slippers.</p><p><br/><br/>“But I would,” she insisted, as Gryffindors were known to do. Gryffindor - she’d been sorted into Gryffindor; the brave and relentlessly bold house. “You died for us.”</p><p><br/><br/>He held her hand still, his fingers rubbing soothing circles over her skin.</p><p> </p><p>“I would have died for one.” He said slowly; softly, in a way she’d never heard before. “<em>One</em>, girl, not three. It would suit you to remember that, Miss Granger.”</p><p><br/><br/>“I know, sir.”</p><p><br/><br/>She did - she <em>did</em>.</p><p><br/><br/>She leaned forward, feeling as if she’d done it a thousand times before, resting against his chest. He didn’t scold her, he didn't snap, as he would have if a student had dared to rest against him. Instead, he sighed, and his arms came about her stiffly, before relaxing. As if she meant something.</p><p><br/><br/>“Impossible girl.”</p><p><br/><br/>Her head turned; ear pressed against his chest and listened to his heartbeat.  “You’re my husband,” Hermione whispered, the realization sudden. She was certain again; certain that he wasn’t her professor, not anymore; not since the war. The exact events since were hazy; though she remembered that fact, through the swirling doubts.</p><p><br/>His hand stroked the small of her back, and she wished, fervently, that she could remember.</p><p><br/><br/>“Aren’t you, Severus?” The words tingled beneath her skin; impossibly warm, impossible right. She wanted to say his name over and over again, as she heard his heart thrum like a wild bird furiously beating its wings against its cage. “Severus.” She whispered as if his name could keep her there.</p><p><br/><br/>His face buried in her curls; wild and beautiful.</p><p><br/><br/>“Yes,” He murmured. “I am, Hermione.”<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
