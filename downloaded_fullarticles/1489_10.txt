    <p>The wind howled across the flat plains that seemed to extend for miles in every direction. Knee high amber grass rippled in waves with the strength of the gusts; no self respecting village or town had taken the chance and staked themselves in this area, largely due to the absence of mountains and trees to take shelter behind. Indeed, the plain was so far removed from any population there were no trails or walk paths retained by the grass- predators and prey alike avoided the vast flatland. The only source of light came from the unusually full moon above, its cool glow adding to the eerie scene. Even the numerous stars visible in the sky did nothing to lighten the surroundings with their twinkling. The wind roared on, picking up to a deafening level and becoming more capricious by the minute. The loud 'pop' couldn't be heard over the racket of the wind, and if it weren't for the two new figures suddenly standing in the grass, you'd never know anything had happened.</p><p>Two tall hooded figured swiveled their heads around, gathering their bearings and without spoken consent, they began to make long strides in seemingly no particular direction. The taller figure took the lead, their head constantly sweeping the area in front of them but never faltering in their step. The second figure was walking with much more care, their cloak held tightly around them. They followed the taller figure with no hesitation, keeping their eyes at their feet to plan their next steps. The pair made hardly a sound as they swiftly cut a path through the grass, the stalks falling before them as if finally happy to have a reason to be free of the wind. Like this they walked for nearly a mile until the taller figure stopped unexpectedly. They held out an arm to catch their smaller counterpart while their eyes searched furiously for something but found only the empty space ahead. They remained still and silent...the smaller figure readjusted their cloak around their body and stilled again. The wind began to ring in their ears and whip at their faces. They exchanged glances, unsure of what was to come next. Then all at once, it all stopped. The air was still. The cold ceased. The noise dampened. The darkness was illuminated. Simultaneously, the two pulled back their hoods and revealed their faces. The taller figure, a man, wore a relieved expression on his face as he pushed back the stray strands of his blonde hair. He looked anxiously back at the woman standing behind him, his eyes meeting hers and then darting down to her cloak which she still held tightly around herself. Her brown curls were tangled around her face but she didn't move to fix them. Instead, she turned her wide apprehensive eyes in front of her to watch the approaching figure.</p><p>The light seemed to be emanating from the new figure, reflecting warmly upon everything it touched. They both watched as the new face came into focus; tanned skin, intense dark eyes and matching dark hair were the first things they noticed about the new stranger. He finally came to a stop before them, a small ball of light in the palm of his hand flickering.</p><p>"You've come a long way to find us. We do not usually share our location with outsiders," said the dark haired man. He looked between the two strangers, lingering on their faces before asking, "Why have you come here?"</p><p>"Please," said the blonde man breathlessly. He gestured to his wife behind him. "My name is Leon and this is my wife Mayra. We run an orphanage. A child was left on our doorstep nearly a week ago. She was left with nothing but a name and a note that told us where to find you." He looked helplessly at his wife as if begging her to help him explain. Her wide eyes never left the dark haired man as she spoke.</p><p>"We have magic but the children we take in are muggles. We're able to take care of the orphans better than most and can still keep our secret. Her magic though... it seeps out of her, even at this age! She's not dangerous but I fear for the other children and what would become of them if her magic became known," her eyes flicked towards to her husband as she added, "I fear that we won't be able to care for her when she gets older. It's unheard of for a child only a few months old to perform such magic." The dark haired man furrowed his brow as he considered their story. After all, they were proposing leaving the child here and it could not be done in haste.</p><p>"Do you have the note that was left with the child?" asked the man. Leon shook his head shortly.</p><p>"No, the note burst into flames after it was read."</p><p>"Do you remember what it said? How it said to find us?"</p><p>"Yes," breathed Mayra. "The note said the child's name was to be Ava. Then it caught fire. Leon was holding it when it happened and he burned himself."</p><p>"It wouldn't heal," he continued. "It throbbed and stung but nothing Mayra or I did helped. It started on my finger. When I woke up the next morning, the burn had spread to my palm. It continued spreading and took a few days to fully form, but it turned out to be a map. And somehow, I knew exactly where to go. We apparated, and ended up here," Leon finished. His blue eyes pleaded with the man's dark ones. He couldn't make heads or tails of what the man was thinking. Leon fervently hoped this man wouldn't turn them away with a sneer and wave of his hand. Instead, he took a tentative step forward, eyes locked on the odd shape he knew to be the child still clutched under the woman's cloak. Even at a distance, he could feel the magical energy surrounding the child.</p><p>"May I?" he murmured while gesturing toward her cloak. Drawing a uneasy breath, Mayra allowed her cloak to fall around her although her careful hands never loosened their grip. The child was swaddled in a thick blanket obscuring most of her body, but her small pale face was still visible over the folds. As if the girl knew she was being surveyed, she turned her head and looked at the man with large eyes. Eyes that held too much understanding for her age. Eyes that made the man stop advancing suddenly, his breath hitching in his throat. Leon's own eyes were quickly darting between Ava and the man desperate to catch some clue to what he was thinking. No one moved for several moments; Mayra was about to break the silence and plead with the man to share his thoughts. Before she could say a word, the man spoke first.</p><p>"You spoke truly. She's special. Even among my people, she will be different." The man held out both hands, leaving the light he was holding floating midair. "Give her here. We will watch over her, raise her as a part of our tribe."</p><p>Leon and Mayra exchanged a glance- they had grown very attached to Ava and now their time with her was up. But she never belonged to them, they knew the minute they read the note left with her that she was destined for someone- somewhere- else. The man noticed the exchange and smiled gently at the couple.</p><p>"She will be safe with us," he assured. Mayra nodded to herself and looked down at the child for the last time. She ran her index finger down Ava's cheek as Leon cradled her head. After their muttered goodbye's, Mayra took a small step towards the man to make the transfer easier. She deposited the bundle in his arms,and once she was satisfied the child was secure, she returned to Leon's side. Leon's arm instantly came around his wife's shoulders. gripping her arm comfortingly. The man shifted Ava into one arm, leaving the other free. He smiled sadly at the couple as he thought of what he had to do next.</p><p>"Thank you for bringing her here. However, I'm afraid you can't leave with the memory of this place. The location of our tribe is not to be known by anyone but our own." He saw the beginning of fear in the couple eyes as they registered what he said. Before it could spread further, the man held up his hand, palm forward, and allowed the magic to flow from himself. He saw their features go slack and knew his magic was working. Once satisfied all appropriate memories had been erased from the couple, he gathered up the light still floating next to him, turned on his heel and began the walk back to the tribe. Glancing down at Ava, he saw her too-intelligent eyes peering up at him and smiled at her. <em>Oh my dear, how special you are indeed</em>, he thought to himself.</p>
