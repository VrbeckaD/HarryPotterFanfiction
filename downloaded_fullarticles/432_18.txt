<p>“Let me get this straight—you paid someone to kidnap me?” Hermione Granger looked up from her steaming cappuccino, certain that her friend had finally gone completely crazy.</p>
<p>“That’s right.” Pansy gave her a smug look and flipped her long dark hair over her shoulder. Hermione had often thought that bad luck followed her the moment they became friends. Because Pansy Parkinson was always in the thick of things... Always.</p>
<p>It was in college, that Pansy’s idea to hide in the men’s locker room and watched the football team <em>au naturel</em> for a <em>tell all</em> expose about how men really act when there are no women around. that cemented the friendship. In which of course, Hermione was the editor in chief of the said university paper.</p>
<p>Hermione had talked to the dean, when Pansy was discovered taking down notes inside the locker room. She defended her from bullies at school. Everyone labelled her friend as a bad influence. While in truth, despite of the numerous piercings, heavy make up and Gothic clothes she was one of the funniest, sweet natured and generous people Hermione had ever met.</p>
<p>They were exact opposites—but perhaps that was why they hit it off so well. So, it was only natural for her to be apprehensive about her friend’s harebrained scheme.</p>
<p>“Who did you pay? Do you even know what you’re getting into? particularly me?” Hermione pushed her caramel curls out of her face and took another sip of her cappuccino. It was perfect, with a thick head of foam that one could put a penny on. Pansy sipped on her eggnog Frappuccino with double whipped cream. They both loved Starbucks especially with its seasonal flavors.</p>
<p>“Well?” she impatiently asked. Pansy seemed more interested to draw patterns on the whipped cream with her straw rather than answer the question.</p>
<p>“Sure, I know what I’m getting into and I know you’ll thank me for it. The actual <em>nap </em>is done by a company called Kidnapped By U. I’ve  read them in magazines. It’s a hit in the US and now, it opened its doors to Europe. they have an office here in London.” She grinned; eyes flashed in excitement. “I saw an article in <em>The Times </em>and I just had to do it.  napped is the <em>It </em>thing right now.”</p>
<p>Hermione put down her cappuccino and rubbed her temples. A tension headache had built. “You’re talking like, it’s some kind of fashion statement that you, just have to get it on. I mean, for Pete’s sake? Do I have to remind you of the time in college in the men’s locker room? or when you had your tongue pierced because it adds up to your oral prowess only to find out your allergic to metal? It swelled so much it hardly fit in your mouth.”</p>
<p>“The tongue thing was so years ago.” Pansy dismissed her friend’s concern with a casual wave.</p>
<p>“Try a month ago.” Hermione snapped. “I drove you to the ER and held your hand while you got unpierced. And I was also, the one who talked to the dean in order for us not to be expelled and loose our scholarships. Don’t you see the pattern here Pans?”</p>
<p>“Whatever, planning your kidnapping is so exciting. I just couldn’t pass it up.”</p>
<p>“Whoa, wait a sec.” Hermione held up a hand, palm up. “You? You actually <em>plan </em>it?”</p>
<p>“Uh- huh. They have this form you fill out. that would tell them all the things that you’re into. you tell them exactly what you want and they do it.” Pansy shrugged. “simple as that.”</p>
<p>“No, not simple at all.” Hermione narrowed her eyes and tapped the table where they sat for emphasis. “For starters, what kind of things are we talking about and how would you know what <em>I want?</em>”</p>
<p>Pansy pouted. “I know what you’re thinking, but it doesn’t have to be sexual—unless you want it to be, that is. There’s no actual <em>intercourse</em> allowed because that wouldn’t be legal. Mostly, they just tie you up and blindfold you and…whatever else you ask for.”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh.” Hermione grimly nodded. “Aside from what you asked for, which is obviously on the kinky side. since, you won’t talk about it. how do you know this is safe? I mean, you’re putting my life on the line Pans, in some stranger that you’ve never seen before.”</p>
<p>“But that’s part of the fun—the danger and uncertainty.” Pansy’s dark eyes flashed as she leaned forward. “I mean, just think of it—you’re walking along down the street at any hour of the day or night—you never know when it’s going to happen—suddenly you’re grabbed, blindfolded and shoved into a van. then they take you back into their lair and do all kinds of things to you—but only things that you specified in the form.” she added with haste. “What could go wrong?”</p>
<p>Hermione massaged her temples some more. “So many things can go wrong I can’t even name them all. For starters, how would you know they won’t go too far?”</p>
<p>“Duh—because then you wouldn’t pay them half of your deposit.” Pansy rolled her eyes as though it was the stupidest question she’d heard. “Besides they’re licensed and bonded.” she giggled. “It’s in their brochure.”</p>
<p>“They have a brochure?” Hermione gasped.</p>
<p>“What government would even license that kind of business? And what kind of license do they even get?” Hermione demanded. “A license, to tie people and do lascivious things to them?”</p>
<p>Pansy sulked. “I don’t know any of that. but there’s a predetermined safe word. If things get too intense then all you have to do is shout it out and they’ll stop. that’s guaranteed in the contract you sign.” she folded her arms over her chest. “And before you ask, Yes I forged your signature. but If you decline and none of this is happening. What’s the point of telling the safe word? it will just only be a couple of days.”</p>
<p>“A couple of day? Oh my God!” Hermione shook her head. “You’ve finally gone off deep, Pans. I can’t believe you ordered me custom kidnapping!”</p>
<p>Pansy smiled. “It’s my Christmas surprise present for you! I was going for the all year-round entrance pass to all the museums and libraries in Paris but this was way cheaper and exciting.”</p>
<p>Hermione frowned. “Oh, I’m surprised all right.  like having your whole nightmare come true surprised.”</p>
<p>Pansy shook her head. “Can you just imagine; you never know when its going to happen. they could just grab you while you and I walk out of Starbucks together!”</p>
<p>“I am imagining.” Hermione said dryly. “I’m imagining what Harry and my parents, would say when I just disappear off the face of the earth and held hostage in a sex dungeon.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare tell Potter! that other best friend of yours, gets too paranoid sometimes.” Pansy pointed one manicured fingernail at her. “I swear to God, if you tell him, I will tell him and Theo the real reason why you broke up with your long-time boyfriend Weasley.”</p>
<p>Hermione winced at the mention of her ex-fiancé.  Ron, he had been the perfect man—according to her parents and friends. He was a businessman with enough financial stability. laid back and loved playing chess on his off hours. anyone would think they were the perfect couple. Both families were devastated when she called it quits. She did want <em>a little </em>excitement and Ron wasn’t comfortable by it.</p>
<p>“I broke up with him because we grew apart.” she said and took another sip of her cappuccino.</p>
<p>“Bullshit.” Pansy slurped up a mouthful of whipped cream from the top of her cup. “You broke up with him because he was boring. and not just in a normal way—boring in <em>bed.</em>”</p>
<p>“Did not! and lower your voice.” Hermione glanced around the crowded Starbucks, making sure the other patrons hadn’t heard her friend. but that didn’t faze Pansy a bit.</p>
<p>“You broke up with him because he didn’t know how to fuck.” she proclaimed in a loud voice and lapped the whipped cream at the end of her straw. “You told me that, One night at The Leaky.”</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t have let you take me there.” Hermione tried not to see the curious eyes that was now in their direction.</p>
<p>“But you did.” Pansy pointed out smugly. “And then you proceeded to drink a whole bottle of tequila all by yourself and that’s when the whole truth came out. and I will gladly tell Potter if you breathe a word that I arranged your gift.”</p>
<p>“All right, all right.” Hermione held up her hands. “but this is crazy, Pans. it doesn’t even sound safe. I’m worried.”</p>
<p>“It will be fine.” Pansy waved her straw with an airy gesture and flipped a glob of whipped cream at Hermione. “don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>Hermione sighed, but she knew Pansy will never place her in harm’s way. she’s crazy and impulsive but she can also be protective and thoughtful.</p>
<p>“Okay. I’ll go with you on this. but the moment things head south, I’m out.”</p>
<p>Pansy laughed. “This is legit and safe.” she promised. “Who knows, maybe the man who does your <em>nap </em>will turn out to be your Prince.”</p>
<p>“The chances of my parents welcoming a professional bondage artist as son in law are about the same as me getting back with Ron.” she said as she raised an eyebrow at her friend.</p>
<p>“Well, a girl can dream.” Pansy tossed her hair and smiled. “You can never tell what might happen in a situation like that. Tied down, helpless, forced to submit while he…does everything that you want based on the form you’ve <em>submitted.” </em></p>
<p>“Well, I still don’t agree with you one hundred percent on this, but I can’t seem to talk you out of it too.” Hermione sighed and reached across the table and dabbed at the whipped cream on her friend’s nose. “So, let’s go—we’ve got more shopping to do.”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As they left Starbucks and head out unto the chilly London evening, she thought an adventure of any kind definitely wasn’t in her cards this holiday season.  the closest she would probably get was, guess the color of the scarf her mom knitted for her on Christmas morning. She just hoped that Pansy’s designer kidnap will not ruin her Christmas and her life in general. but knowing Pansy Parkinson, that wasn’t very likely at all.,</p>
