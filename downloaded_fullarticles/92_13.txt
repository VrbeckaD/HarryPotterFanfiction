Try to be more careful.”</p><p>Draco’s heart hammers hard in his chest.</p><p>The bloody, <em>bloody</em> Muggle car that had nearly ploughed into him races speedily past them both. The ugly red prat behind the steering-wheel screams incomprehensible obscenities. </p><p>Draco doesn’t think that he’ll <em>ever</em> get used to Muggle London. It’s frenetic, loud and terrifying.</p><p>Thank Merlin he has Harry to look after him. Draco knows that his beloved would never let him come to harm.</p></div>
