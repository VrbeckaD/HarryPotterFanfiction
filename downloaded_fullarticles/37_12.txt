    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>After the war was over every student whose studies were interrupted were offered the chance to return to Hogwarts to finish their education. Harry, Ron and Hermione, like most of the peers in their year, had jumped at the opportunity for one last year before they had to part ways and face adult life head on.</p>
<p>  Due to the large amount of extra students that would have already left Hogwarts if the war had not happened, McGonagall created an extra year officially known as eighth year.</p>
<p>  Harry was worried that because of the extra amount go students in each house in the eighth year students wouldn't be able to stay in their usual dorms. Fortunately that wasn't an issue because each founder had added extra living quarters hidden within the dorms. McGonagall had allowed every eighth year student to have their previous living quarters, pushing the first years into the secret quarters that they were more than happy to occupy.</p>
<p>  The transition back to Hogwarts came naturally to most people, some took more time but eventually fell back into the routine. Harry, however, found it especially hard, with May looking; he still hadn't managed to settle back into his old habits. For the first time ever there was no imminent danger to his life and Harry felt at a loss. </p>
<p>  The only option to keep his mind occupied was to delve into schoolwork, to not slip into old habits and to get the best marks possible that would allow him to become an Auror.</p>
<p>  Harry's new behaviour quickly spread around the school and those who knew him quickly realised that he wasn't himself. He was very quiet, only spoke when he was spoken to and focused all of his time on studying and playing Quidditch.</p>
<p>  McGonagall allowed all eighth year students to have a monthly party in the Room of Requirement as a way to encourage inter house unity and for a way to allow those to share their experiences from the war with others who they might not normally engage in conversation with.</p>
<p>  Harry could never find it in himself to go. Everyone socialised and celebrated but Harry couldn't find it in himself to do either so he usually stayed in Gryffindor tower to study, read or sleep.</p>
<p>  Wherever Harry was no one bothered him anymore. After the first few months of no replies people slowly began to stop talking to him. The only people who still bothered were Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna and Neville. At the beginning of the year, Dean and Seamus tried to keep conversations with Harry, but as the year dragged on and Harry refused to come out of his shell they slowly stopped bothering and settled to only exchanging pleasantries.</p>
<p>  So there Harry was, on a Friday night, in the corner of the Gryffindor common room with his notes and textbooks scattered across the table as he finished his potions essay.</p>
<p>  "Mate, come tonight. Please." Ron begged Harry as he walked through the portrait hole with Seamus and Dean.</p>
<p>  Harry sighed. The monthly party was held on the last day of the month and unfortunately for Harry that day was today. "Ron I can't. I'm behind on my potions essay."</p>
<p>  "That was <em>the most </em>tragic thing I have <em>ever </em>heard you say and you have gave me some pretty shitty excuses this year. I'm not entirely sure if you're you or if you're Hermione who used Polyjuice potion to look like you." Ron groaned, sinking into the chair next to Harry.</p>
<p>  "Since when did turning into me become such a bad thing?" Hermione pecked Ron's cheek, causing him to jump. "Although, Ron does have a point Harry. I have gone to every singly party this year and you haven't gone to one. Not that it matters but everyone is wondering what you do. There are some pretty wild rumours circulating."</p>
<p>  "I don't care about rumours. Ever since I was eleven there has been constant rumours about me." Harry said, slamming his quill onto the table.</p>
<p>  "We're very aware of that Harry. But the rumours are so fun. I like the one where Harry goes swimming in the black lake because he made friends with the merpeople in fourth year." Dean said, slipping onto the window ledge beside Harry's table.</p>
<p>  "I like the one where Harry visits Hagrid every night night for rock cake and tea. From personal experience I know the rock cake is definitely not true." Ron laughed.</p>
<p>  "The one that Harry is secretly the owner of the Deathly Hallows and is planning to resurrect You Know Who is a very concerning and oddly specific one." Hermione added.</p>
<p>  "Oh I like the one where Harry visits the Slytherin common room every night to shag Malfoy." Seamus said, with a suspicious grin as he laid across window ledge and rested his head on Dean's lap.</p>
<p>  "I wonder who started that rumour?" Ron said, throwing one of Harry's books at Seamus.</p>
<p>  The book his Seamus with a thud on his chest. Ron, Dean and Seamus burst out with laughter as they began to throw Harry's textbook between themselves.</p>
<p>  "Hey! I need that!" Harry said as he snatched his book back from Ron. "The rumours are stupid and they're a lie. You should all be used to that by now."</p>
<p>  "Seriously mate, we're getting worried. You haven't done anything sociable this year and the year is nearly over. Gryffindor are in the running to win the house cup, thanks to you by the way, but you're not even excited! This might be the last time to have a little bit of fun before Auror training!" Ron exclaimed, shifting in his seat to allow Hermione to perch neatly on his lap.</p>
<p>  "Ron I don't care about having fun. I need to get good NEWT's so the ministry takes me on. I need to get in."</p>
<p>  "Of course you're going to get in Harry! You're The Boy Who Lived, slayer of You Know Who. If the Ministry doesn't take you on for your skills, which they will, they'll definitely take you on for your name." Seamus said.</p>
<p>  "Harry doesn't want to be Ministry propaganda Seamus." Dean shoved Seamus in the shoulder.</p>
<p>  "Seamus does have a point though Harry. The Ministry knows what you can do and they would be foolish not to take you on for abilities alone. Although, the marks that you're going to achieve from all of this studying is surely going to make you more desirable." Hermione said. </p>
<p>  "I don't understand why you want me to go to the party so much. I expect it from Ron, Seamus too but Dean, Hermione, I didn't expect it from you two?" Harry finally began to shove his parchment and textbooks into bag. He was glad to have a break from doing his schoolwork but he would never admit that to Ron.</p>
<p>  "Harry we're worried about you. I know this year hasn't been easy for you. It hasn't been easy for any of us but you have to allow yourself to adjust, to move on just like everyone else is trying to do. Even Malfoy is moving on. You know he's actually very interesting when you get to know him."</p>
<p>  Harry stopped packing away his homework and gaped at Hermione. "You're speaking to Malfoy? After everything he's done?"</p>
<p>  "Of course his ears perked up at that. He seriously hasn't got over that obsession with Malfoy. Maybe the rumours are true." Seamus laughed.</p>
<p>  "Shut up Seamus." Harry and Hermione said in unison.</p>
<p>  "Malfoy comes to the parties Harry. The first few times he was very hesitant, only spoke to fellow Slytherin's. After that he started talking to Ravenclaw's, then Hufflepuff's and when he started talking to Gryffindor's that's when he really started to open up. Harry I know you and Malfoy have had your issues in the past, but you of all people should know that the war has changed people." Hermione explained.</p>
<p>  "He has the dark mark Hermione!" Harry shouted.</p>
<p>  "And he threw you your wand back in front of Voldemort and all the Death Eaters! That would have been punishable by death and still is if a Death Eater finds him! I thought you all people, given everything you have gone through, would not be prejudice. I'm disappointed in you Harry." </p>
<p>  Hermione was no longer sitting on Ron's lap. She was standing over Harry now, her face bright red with rage. Although Hermione was a tiny bit taller than Harry, she looked extremely overbearing. After staring at Harry for an uncomfortably long time she stormed up the stairs towards the girls dormitory. </p>
<p>  "Seriously Harry, now that he's got past all of that Pureblood crap he's actually an alright guy." Dean said.</p>
<p>  "Not to mention he's easy on the eyes." Seamus added.</p>
<p>  "Alright Seamus, anyone would think that you would want to mount him. I mean I still think he's a bit of a prat. Harry, he even talks to me and I'm considered a blood traitor." Ron said.</p>
<p>  "Harry you should come tonight. It will be good to break the ice. And you need to apologise to Hermione." Dean said. </p>
<p>  Harry sighed. "Why? What's so important about tonight? What makes it so different from all of the other parties?"</p>
<p>  "Well, if you must know!" Hermione began to shout as she walked down the stairs from the girls dormitory. She had changed from her school robes into a beautiful pink dress, one resembling the colour of her Yule ball dress. Her hair was now parted in the middle with two buns sitting neatly on the top of her head with her baby hair falling on either side of her face. "The anniversary is coming up and I realised that everyone is going to be more on edge than usual. Especially you Harry. So I decided to relieve some tension for everyone."</p>
<p>  Ron got up from his seat and grabbed Hermione by the hips, kissing her passionately. "Hermione, you're beautiful. Have I ever told you that? Everyone! Look how how beautiful my girlfriend is!" Ron shouted in the common room.</p>
<p>  "Ronald stop it!" Hermione blushed, slapping Ron gently on the arm but kissing him back gently. "As I was saying! I decided to take a trip to see Aberforth at the Hog's Head through the secret passage in the Room of Requirement. I may or may not have stocked tonight's party with enough Butterbeer, Firewhiskey, Elf Wine and Mead to get us all monstrously drunk."</p>
<p>  The four boys gaped at Hermione with identical looks of shock.</p>
<p>  "You're bloody brilliant Hermione. I love you so much!" Rain said as he lifted Hermione by the waste and span her around.</p>
<p>  "Isn't that breaking about a dozen school rules?" Harry said, rapidly blinking at her.</p>
<p>  "Hypocritical coming from you." Hermione snapped. "As much as I care about school rules and regulations Harry, we have broken more than a dozen of them over the past seven years. It's a bit premature in the year for our rule breaking but desperate times call for desperate measures."</p>
<p>  "I love you so much Hermione. <em>So much</em>." Ron started kissing her neck.</p>
<p>  Hermione laughed and shoved Ron off of her. "It's no problem. Considering all of us are of age anyway I doubt McGonagall would be as furious."</p>
<p>  "I can't believe you're not overly worried about the consequences of if McGonagall found out. It is bad that I find that incredibly sexy? Who are you and what have you done with Hermione Granger?"</p>
<p>  Hermione giggled. "Shut up Ron. Don't let this get to your head. It won't happen often."</p>
<p>  "Hermione. I'm sorry about what I said. I shouldn't have said it. It was out of line." Harry quietly said, avoiding eye contact with her.</p>
<p>  "You're bloody right you were out of line! Honestly Harry I have no idea what's going on with you! Although concerning I'm perfectly fine with you sitting around and keeping yourself to yourself. But when you start being prejudice and hateful that is where I draw the line!" </p>
<p>  "I know. It was wrong of me. I guess because I haven't seen Malfoy trying I just assumed he was the same as before."</p>
<p>  "Well, he's not. And if you came tonight you would realise that Malfoy has changed. So keep that in mind."</p>
<p>  "Hermione, how the hell did you manage to pay for all that?" Seamus asked.</p>
<p>  "Actually it didn't. During the reconstruction of Hogwarts, Aberforth and I were assigned to the same part of the castle. We quickly became friends. He helped me with something and I helped him with the Hog's Head. His profits have gone up by sixty seven percent so he was more than happy to give us everything for free. Of course I offered to pay! But he insisted!" Hermione said.</p>
<p>  "What the hell did Aberforth help you with?" Harry questioned.</p>
<p>  "Oh that doesn't matter Harry."</p>
<p>  "Mate, you have to come now! You don't even have to talk to anyone. You can just get drunk in the corner and forget about all of your problems!" Ron clapped him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>  "Oh for gods sake Ronald! That was not the intention behind the alcohol!"</p>
<p>  "Yeah but at least it might make him come!"</p>
<p>  "You know I am right here! Have you ever considered that I don't come to these parties because I don't want to go?" Harry questioned.</p>
<p>  "Mate. You want to come. i can see it in your eyes."</p>
<p>  "My eyes aren't glistening with want Ron."</p>
<p>  "Harry, I agree with Ron. Every time we go, you look like you want to come but there's something stopping you. Considering everything that has happened, we have been more than patient. Harry, we hate seeing you like this and it's clearly only getting worse." Hermione said, resting her head on Harry's shoulder as she embraced him tightly.</p>
<p>  "You're not going to stop until I come, are you?" Harry asked, sighing as he hugged Hermione back.</p>
<p>  "No." Hermione, Ron, Dean and Seamus said in unison.</p>
<p>  "You knew if you put too much effort into this then I would feel guilty for not coming. Didn't you?"</p>
<p>  "Yes." Hermione and Ron said in unison.</p>
<p>  "Fine. I'll come. Let me change and shave first." Harry grabbed his bag and walked towards the stairs leading up to the boys dormitory.</p>
<p>  "NO!" Ron, Hermione, Dean and Seamus as well as a few girls in the common room shouted in unison.</p>
<p>  Harry stopped in his tracks and turned around, facing the group with a puzzled look. "I've missed something here haven't I?"</p>
<p>  "Harry you're the only bloke in this school who can grow a full beard!" Dean exclaimed.</p>
<p>  "Minus the teachers of course." Hermione added.</p>
<p>  "I'm pretty sure Harry can even grow a beard better than some of the teachers. You can't shave it off mate." Ron added.</p>
<p>  "It's a good look Harry. Everyone was drooling over you before but now that you have a beard you're even more popular." Seamus added.</p>
<p>  "Harry. I think you really underestimate how good that beard looks on you. You were handsome before but now, there's just something rugged and mysterious about you. It's so enticing." Romilda Vane said as she walked past Harry, looking back over her shoulder with a wink.</p>
<p>  "Oh behave Romilda. You tried to give Harry a love potion two years ago. You find him enticing no matter what." Demelza Robins said as she rolled her eyes before she turned to Harry. "Harry, usually I don't care what you do. Not interested in the least. But when you came in with that beard I won't deny that even I looked at you."</p>
<p>  Harry gaped at the two of them, not knowing how to respond to their honesty. </p>
<p>  "It's a good look Harry. It's made you more popular that's for sure." Seamus added.</p>
<p>  "You haven't been paying attention at all this year. But we have. The girls who fancied you before Christmas break were always giggly around you and when you came back after the holidays they practically melted. It's a good thing you're not paying attention to them really, if you even smiled at them I'm afraid they might simultaneously combust." Hermione explained.</p>
<p>  "Hermione, you're seriously downplaying it. harry, the girls think you're a sex god." Seamus added.</p>
<p>  "I think you're a sex god Harry." Romilda agreed.</p>
<p>  "Don't forget about some of the blokes either. Ever since you and Ginny broke up they've been praying that you swing both ways. You are the wizarding worlds most eligible bachelor. It says it here in todays Witch Weekly."</p>
<p>  Harry examined the cover of Witch Weekly. The front page was a picture of Harry from a day out to Hogsmeade the week before. His face was slightly turned to the side and his head was tilted up ever so slight. The sun was shining on his face, giving full definition of the thickness of his beard and the green of his eyes. The animation of the picture was Harry's face turning to the camera slightly, his lips curled up in a shy smile. Harry couldn't deny that the photo made him look good, but they had only caught him at a good time. The title said 'Harry Potter, The Boy Who Doesn't Shave'.</p>
<p>  "They could have thought of a better title." Harry said as he rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>  "Just read the article." Seamus said.</p>
<p>  Harry huffed out a breath. "Harry Potter, 18, looked rugged and tired as he headed out to Hogsmeade for a break from his studies. According to sources, young Harry returned to Hogwarts after the Christmas holidays with his very impressive facial hair and has not shaved it since. Some might argue that Harry has lost interest in his personal grooming, but we believe that he has simply discovered his impressive talents and the attention it has brought him. According to sources, Harry has been incredibly focused on his studies throughout the entire academic year. It is reported that Harry, along with best friend Ronald Weasley, have both already been offered a place in the Auror Academy. However, because of their noble natures, they both decided to go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to continue their education and secure their place in the Auror Academy like everyone else. Can you name anymore more noble? At this moment in time, it is understood that Harry is currently single. After his breakup with ex-girlfriend Ginny Weasley shortly after his return to Hogwarts last Autumn, sources have confirmed that Harry has kept to himself and has had no other romantic flings since. Or has he been keeping a special someone under wraps? Stay tuned readers.'</p>
<p>  "Well. That was disgusting to read." Harry said, throwing the magazine back to Seamus.</p>
<p>  "It's an awful article but the picture is fantastic. I've placed loads around the school. You're welcome." Seamus said.</p>
<p>  "Oh for fuck sake Seamus, why would you do that?" Harry sighed as he pinched the bridge of his nose. "I mean they're not wrong about my beard. I couldn't be bothered to shave it all off so I just trim it every once in a while."</p>
<p>  "Mate, I think you're seriously underestimating your beard growing abilities. It's a work of art. Seamus, duplicate the picture for me will you? Mum will want one framed." Ron asked.</p>
<p>  "Oh yes! I'd love one too. Could you make at least seven? I know Andromeda and my mum would love a copy. Oh and Neville would love one too! Just do a dozen so we have some spares." Hermione exclaimed, hugging Ron.</p>
<p>  Harry groaned and rolled his eyes. "I have nothing to add to this conversation. I don't understand why you want so many copies?"</p>
<p>  "Harry go change. We're going to get pissed and I am not sitting next to you if you're going to wear your school robes." Ron said, turning him around and edging him towards the stairs.</p>
<p>  "Fine. Give me ten minutes." Harry said and began walking up the stairs towards his dormitory room. As he reached the top of the staircase he paused and looked down at his friends. "People are going to stare, aren't they?'</p>
<p>  "Of course they're going to stare. You've practically been a recluse this entire year." Ron said.</p>
<p>  "Thanks for the brutal honesty there Ron."</p>
<p>  "Well, you should be used to it. People have been staring at you since you were eleven. You've just been too busy to notice lately."</p>
<p>  "You'll be fine harry. Everyone in that room knows you as Harry their classmate. All those people have known you for eight years. The novelty wore off a long time ago. Now hurry up! I can't be late to a party that I organised!" Hermione said, waving her hand in a shooing motion.</p>
<p>  Harry threw his schoolbag onto his bed. He really didn't want to go to this party but after he scolding from Hermione he knew that she would be extra pissed if he didn't show up. </p>
<p>  When he got into the bathroom he grabbed his clippers from the cabinet and began to trim his heard. He could never grasp how to trim his hair with magic like Ron and he never had the courage to ask, so he reverted to the Muggle ways that he had learned from observing Uncle Vernon. </p>
<p>  As soon as he was done with his beard he noticed that his hair was longer than he would usually like it. He knew that if he left it he would not stop thinking about it. Before he could overthink it, he grabbed the clippers and trimmed the back and sides down a significant amount.</p>
<p>  When he was finished, Harry put the clippers away and vanished the hair. He looked in the mirror and smiled briefly at the finished result. His beard was trimmed, his hair was short at the sides and a fluffy mess at the top. The weight from his shoulders eased a little from his new identity.</p>
<p>  Harry threw on a pair of jeans with a tear in the right knee that had been accidental but he made bigger to make it seem like they were part of the design. He then grabbed a black button down shirt and his black converse.</p>
<p>  As Harry walked down the stairs he heard a gasp and a loud screech which made him jump.</p>
<p>  "Oh my god Harry! Your hair! Your outfit! Marry me!" Romilda cried.</p>
<p>  "Oh well done mate. You've really done it now." Ron said, shaking his head.</p>
<p>  "What? Does it not look good?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>  "Oh no, you look fine. More than fine is the problem." Dean said.</p>
<p>  "Harry you're fit. Not only did that beard add to your looks. You have now cut your hair which has added to the sex appeal. And those clothes. Wow." Seamus said.</p>
<p>  "Oh Merlin, now people are definitely going to stare."</p>
<p>  Before her knew it they were outside of the doors of the Room of Requirement. Harry hadn't been back since that fateful day during the war. He could feel his heart rate quicken as every second ticked by. As if suddenly feeling his urge to turn around and run back to Gryffindor tower, Hermione pushed the doors open.</p>
<p>  Harry couldn't help but gasp as he walked in. The room had been transformed into a cozy common room, filled with luscious sofas and armchairs with fluffy pillows and large blankets. It was similar to Gryffindor tower but with colour schemes from each house. To the left was a long table filled with the countless bottles of alcohol Hermione had acquired, along with two large punch bowls filled with an unknown concoction in the middle and glasses piled at the end. To the right was a small table with a muggle record player with rows of various albums. </p>
<p>  As Harry walked through the door, only few took a moment to glance in his direction. Most of the room hadn't noticed anyone new enter until a distant, somewhat familiar voice shouted from across the room.</p>
<p>  "About time you showed up Potter!" Pansy Parkinson cheered, raising her glass of wine.</p>
<p>  Harry stood still in his place, immediately wishing there to be a way he could turn around and go back to the confides of his four poster bed. Everyone who had not noticed him enter turned around, joining Pansy in raising their glasses and cheering.</p>
<p>  Harry looked at Ron with a puzzled look as Hermione began to over to Pansy.</p>
<p>  "I reckon McGonagall would be pleased with all of this inter house unity. A lot of stuff has changed this year." Ron said, clapping him over the shoulder as he made his way to the drinks table.</p>
<p>  Harry was at a loss of where to go. The room was filled with people from all different houses engaging in conversation that Harry assumed they didn't even know. Apparently a lot had changed while he was held up in his own mind but he just hadn't bothered to notice.</p>
<p>  Hermione sighed and dragged him over to the group she was talking to, which consisted of Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini.</p>
<p>  "Oh calm down Potter. I won't turn you over to the Dark Lord again, I promise." Pansy laughed as she dragged him down onto the bundle of cushions on the floor.</p>
<p>  "Pansy!" Hermione shrieked in shock.</p>
<p>  "Oh pack it in Granger." Pansy said, smirking at Hermione. "Though I am sorry Potter, not my finest hour I'll have to admit. Just didn't like You Know Who in my head is all."</p>
<p>  "It's okay." Harry replied shyly.</p>
<p>  Ron quickly joined the group, shoving a large tumbler of Firewhiskey into Harry's hands and passing an uncomfortably high filled glass of wine as he sat down. "So, what are we talking about? Must have been something good to make Harry actually open his mouth to someone other than his close friends. Even if it was just two words."</p>
<p>  "Oh I was just apologising for trying to turn Potter over to You Know Who. Let bygones be bygones and all that." Pansy explained.</p>
<p>  "Don't edge him in slowly then." Ron chuckled, taking a sip of his drink.</p>
<p>  Harry knew that most of the night would go like this and downed his drink in one. He knew that he could not be sober if people were insistent on bombarding him with questions about the war and offering their apologies.</p>
<p>  "Easy there Potter. Anyone would think that you don't want to be sober to talk to us." Blaise laughed.</p>
<p>  "I'd rather not be sober tonight." Harry sighed as he got up to get himself another drink.</p>
<p>  As he walked over to the drinks table, Harry took a more in depth look at the various different groups. Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones and Terry Boot were in one corner. Cho Chang, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Anthony Goldstein and Millicent Bulstrode all sat comfortably on the sofa in the far corner, leaning on each other. Neville was talking to Luna and Ginny as they picked up some muggle records. Harry smiled to himself, knowing that Ginny and Luna, although in the year below, would be confident enough to join and eighth year only party. The most odd sight was seeing Seamus and Dean talking to Goyle and Malfoy.</p>
<p>  Harry didn't allow himself to look over long enough for someone to notice him staring, especially not Malfoy.</p>
<p>  He filled his drink up and looked at it quizzically, knowing that it wouldn't last him so he picked up an entire bottle and took it over with him. No one would notice it was missing; there were so many other bottles spread out all over the table. He took over a bottle of wine for Hermione and Pansy for good measure.</p>
<p>  "Apparently you're planning on getting smashed then." Ron said as more of a statement than a question.</p>
<p>  "Knew I'd have to keep getting up and down otherwise so I thought it was best if I just brought some over." Harry explained.</p>
<p>  "And you thought of us ladies too. How chivalrous of you Potter." Pansy smiled, taking the bottle from Harry.</p>
<p>  "Let bygones be bygones and all that." Harry smirked shyly at Pansy, taking a large sip of his drink.</p>
<p>  "If I would have known that this would have brought Harry out of his shell I would have planned this a lot sooner." Hermione sighed, taking a large gulp of her wine, leaning against Ron as he wrapped his arms around her.</p>
<p>  "Are we really surprised that alcohol and breaking the rules brought Potter out of his shell?" Blaise laughed.</p>
<p>  "Well he's been doing the latter since first year." Pansy added. "You know Granger, you have seriously outdone yourself this time. I never knew you were such an avid rule breaker."</p>
<p>  "Yes well it wasn't all Harry. Ron and I helped. Although, I would consistently remind them how many school rules we were breaking."</p>
<p>  "And yet you did nevertheless." Pansy and Hermione laughed as Hermione let Pansy fill her glass up some more.</p>
<p>  "I never thought I would see this." Harry stared with a slight look of shock.</p>
<p>  "Yes, it is quite concerning. Granger and Pansy are an unstoppable force. Worst thing to happen for all of us was when they became friends." Blaise added, refilling his own glass with more Firewhiskey.</p>
<p>  "When did all this happen? Surely I would have noticed if Parkinson and Hermione became friends?" Harry asked, finishing and refilling how own glass.</p>
<p>  "Well, you've had your head so far up your own arse this year you haven't been able to see anyone else." Draco said as he came over with a bottle of Firewhiskey and a bottle of wine. "I see someone had the same idea. Hello Potter, nice to see you out and about." </p>
<p>  Harry's breath caught in his throat. From the angle he was before, he couldn't see Draco properly but now Draco was standing in front of him Harry could see him very clearly.</p>
<p>  Draco's hair was no longer slicked back like it was in sixth year, but flopped forward and parted at the side, resembling his look in fourth year. He wore black fitted trousers and a white button down shirt with black loafers.</p>
<p>  "Typical. First thing you saw to him is an insult. Still a prat." Ron rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>  "Have to keep up appearances Weasley. I have been seen being tolerable to all Gryffindor's, can't let Potter slip through the crack too." Draco said as he slipped into the space next to Harry on the sofa. "I must say Potter the new style looks.. good."</p>
<p>  "Oh. Um, thanks." Harry blushed, sipping his drink.</p>
<p>  "Did Malfoy just compliment Harry?" Ron asked.</p>
<p>  "Did Potter just blush?" Blaise laughed.</p>
<p>  "This is more than I could hope for!" Pansy shrieked.</p>
<p>  "Alright Pans, calm down. I merely complimented Potter's new sense of fashion, that's all." Draco explained, sipping his wine.</p>
<p>  "Oh wow. Malfoy admitted he complimented Harry. On purpose." Hermione gaped.</p>
<p>  "Do not get them started Granger. It will be like sixth year all over again." Blaise chuckled.</p>
<p>  "Oh god, that was torture. Harry wouldn't stop following Malfoy around." Ron laughed.</p>
<p>  "Not as bad as Draco. He spoke about Potter non stop!" Pansy groaned.</p>
<p>  "I followed Malfoy around because I thought he was up to something. I was right." Harry frowned.</p>
<p>  ""Yes and Potter was in fact following me around. Neither of us were wrong." Draco explained.</p>
<p>  "Even after all this time the sexual tension is just too much." Ron groaned.</p>
<p>  "There is no sexual tension between us." Draco stated as he sipped his wine and rolled his eyes a little bit too dramatically.</p>
<p>  Harry downed another glass of Firewhiskey, refilling it as quickly as he drank it.</p>
<p>  "Oh, drinking to avoid commenting on the lingering statement. I think Potter may disagree." Blaise said as he shuffled forward and leaned in slightly.</p>
<p>  "There is no sexual tension between Malfoy and I." Harry explained.</p>
<p>  "Well that was very anticlimactic. I was expecting Potter to sweep Draco off his feet." Blaise said, sighing as he rested his head in Pansy's lap.</p>
<p>  "Oh I don't know Blaise, I expected it to be more passionate. Draco and Potter would argue for months on end and during one very volatile argument, Potter would push Draco up against the wall in a searing kiss." Pansy explained, sipping her wine.</p>
<p>  "That was a very elaborate scenario Pans?" Draco questioned.</p>
<p>  "Yes. Well, the thought had occurred to me more than once. I should write a novel."</p>
<p>  "I second that! The scenarios you come up with for other students are incredible! I think they would be a bit!" Hermione said, giving Pansy a thumbs up.</p>
<p>  "Thank you Granger. See, this is why I talk to you. You truly are the smartest witch in school."</p>
<p>  "I don't think McGonagall understands what she has created." Malfoy said.</p>
<p>  Harry shivered as a wisp of cold air blew across his back. Although the Room of Requirement was cozy, it lacked the warmth of a real common room. Harry looked at the fireplace and imagined casting Incendio but he lacked the strength to reach for his wand to actually cast it.</p>
<p>  As soon as the word Incendio finished in his head, the fireplace lit up with a large flame. harry stared at the fire with wide eyes, knowing that no one was nearby to cast a spell. Harry was aware of wand-less magic and non-verbal magic but he was not aware that one could complete such things at the same time.</p>
<p>  "Who the hell just cast that?| Hermione blinked, frantically looking around the room.</p>
<p>  "I'm sure someone cast it Hermione." Ron said, staring at the growing fire.</p>
<p>  "I didn't hear anyone use the incantation?" Pansy asked as an open question.</p>
<p>  "I mean it's possible that someone could have done non-verbal magic. But I didn't see anyone with their wand out?" Hermione replied, sitting up right. Looking around with concern.</p>
<p>  "Granger, I'm sure someone used their wand. You just didn't see. Wand-less and non-verbal magic is practically unheard of." Draco said, filling up Hermione's wine some more. "Calm down Granger, not everything has to be a mystery to solve. Maybe you have had a few too many wines. God knows you have had a lot already."</p>
<p>  "You're probably right. I am feeling rather giddy." Hermione replied, taking a large sip of wine as she leaned across Ron's lap.</p>
<p>  Harry was glad that Hermione was drunk enough to drop it. He knew that tomorrow morning Hermione would not stop talking about it until she solved it which gave Harry enough time to feel less panicked about the situation.</p>
<p>  Harry didn't want to think about the sudden realisation of being able to perform wand-less and non-verbal magic. It was a skill that had only be rumoured in history books and there was no confirmed cases. Harry had already been the subject in many new and ongoing history books. He didn't need to give them anymore reasons to keep writing about his life.</p>
<p>  "I'm not entirely sure if Potter is smashed or just bored of our company." Blaise said as he leaned into the arm of the sofa more, creating space between himself and Pansy.</p>
<p>  "Harry, social distancing himself in the middle of a conversation? Never would have guessed." Ginny laughed, sitting in between Blaise and Pansy.</p>
<p>  Harry frowned at Ginny, knowing that there was only one reason for sitting snuggly next to Blaise instead of sitting next to Hermione. Although Ginny was his ex-girlfriend, they agreed to be friends and Harry felt bad that Ginny obviously thought he was too unapproachable to tell him that she was seeing Blaise.</p>
<p>  Harry shook himself out of his thoughts, smiling at the group. "Yeah I'm fine. Just a lot drunker than I thought."</p>
<p>  "Now that is something I can use to my advantage. Lets play a little game of never have I ever." Pansy exclaimed, jumping in her seat a little.</p>
<p>  "Oh this won't end good. I love it. Let's play." Draco said, sitting on his feet, rubbing his hands together.</p>
<p>  Neville and Luna staggered over, holding hands and laughing as they reached the group. Dean and Seamus followed closely behind.</p>
<p>  "Guys! Sit down! We're playing never have I ever!" Ginny exclaimed, gradually moving closer to Blaise.</p>
<p>  "Now this is a game that I can get behind. Fill us up Malfoy." Seamus exclaimed, sitting on a  pile of cushions next to the fire.</p>
<p>  Draco poured Dean, Seamus and Neville some Firewhiskey and Luna some wine. "Watch yourself Finnigan. Don't let Thomas hear you say that. He might get jealous."</p>
<p>  "He knows that I'll never sleep with a ferret. I might do some crazy shit but that's where I draw the line."</p>
<p>  "Okay is everyone settled? Everyone got a drink?" Pansy asked, looking around to see everyone ready and waiting. "Good! Now lets start. Here are the rules. We only want difficult and sexual questions. If it's boring you'll get a hex because boo. Everyone understand?"</p>
<p>  Harry saw everyone nod at each other. He didn't want to play but he also knew that he would not hear the end of it if he left now. He knew he was drunk enough to answer questions that sober him most definitely would refuse and although the thought scared him he found himself ready to play the game.</p>
<p>  "Okay, we'll start easy. Never have I ever gave a blowjob under the Quidditch stands." Pansy asked, smiling.</p>
<p>  Seamus, Dean, Luna, Ginny, Hermione and Pansy each sipped their drink.</p>
<p>  "Alright Ginny. Didn't need to know that." Ron frowned in disgust.</p>
<p>  "Oh sod off Ron. You can talk, Hermione sipped!" Ginny replied.</p>
<p>  "Okay. My turn! Never have I ever fantasised about a teacher." Luna asked, innocently.</p>
<p>  Luna, Ginny, Pansy, Hermione and Seamus sipped their drink.</p>
<p>  "I know who the girls liked. Who the hell did you fantasise about Thomas?" Blaise asked, generally curious.</p>
<p>  "Same as the girls. Lockheart." Seamus replied, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p>  "He has a thing for pretty boys." Dean said as he winked at Seamus.</p>
<p>  "Enough flirting you two. You can shag it out later. Lets dial it up a notch. Never have I ever cast a dark or questionable curse." Blaise asked, eyes darting from person to person.</p>
<p>  Harry rolled his eyes and drank, along with Draco Luna, Neville, Ginny and Ron.</p>
<p>  "What curse have you three cast?" Dean aimed towards Luna, Neville and Ginny.</p>
<p>  "Bat-Bogey hex. Apparently its a hex with a questionable status." Ginny replied, shrugging her shoulders. "Wait Ron, what have you cast?"</p>
<p>  "Imperius curse. Had to use it on a goblin when we broke into Gringotts." Ron said with a shrug.</p>
<p>  "Draco, I'd like to know what spell you cast." Luna asked, her eyes bright with curiosity.</p>
<p>  "Because you asked so nicely Luna I shall tell you. I cast the Cruciatus curse on Potter. He beat me to it before it could take with- actually Potter what was it again?" Draco asked, so nonchalant, like the spell Harry cast didn't nearly kill him.</p>
<p>  "Sectumsempra. That's not the worst I cast though." Harry replied, looking anywhere but at Draco.</p>
<p>  "Do enlighten me Potter."</p>
<p>  "Um- I uh- used the Cruciatus curse."</p>
<p>  "On who?"</p>
<p>  "On your aunt. Bellatrix actually." </p>
<p>  "Well no doubt she deserved it. She was a fucking psychopath."</p>
<p>  "Okay we're officially off topic! I want to find out more secrets. Never have I ever found Parseltongue sexy." Ginny asked with a laugh.</p>
<p>  "Nice one. Thanks for that Ginny." Harry groaned.</p>
<p>  Draco, Hermione and Ginny all sipped their drink.</p>
<p>  "Oh my god Granger!" Pansy shrieked.</p>
<p>  "No! Not because of Harry! Ron and I had to go into the chamber of secrets and the only way to enter was to say something in Parseltongue. Apparently Harry talks in his sleep and Ron picked up a few things." Hermione explained.</p>
<p>  "Obviously Ginny is a given but Malfoy? Wait, that's also a given." Seamus smirked.</p>
<p>  "Oh shut up Finnigan. It's a nice language is all." Draco explained.</p>
<p>  "Never have I ever kissed two Weasley's." Seamus asked.</p>
<p>  Harry sighed as he drank. "You're an arse Seamus."</p>
<p>  The whole group looked at him with confusion but it wasn't as bad as Ginny's horror stricken face.</p>
<p>  "Harry, what the hell?" Ginny shrieked.</p>
<p>  "Oh my god this is amazing!" Pansy gasped.</p>
<p>  Ron burst into laughter. "No Ginny it's not what you think. Sixth year we got smashed and Seamus dared us to kiss each other so we did. It was like two seconds long."</p>
<p>  "Oh god it was hilarious when Seamus ran down to tell me. I was sure they wouldn't do it!" Hermione laughed.</p>
<p>  "I think we should play a different game." Neville suggested. "I don't have huge amounts to contribute to never have I ever but if we were to play spin the bottle it might make things a lot more interesting."</p>
<p>  "Oh Longbottom you <em>genius</em>!" Pansy shrieked as she waved her wand to produce a neat circle of pillows for everyone to sit on. "Right! Everyone sit down."</p>
<p>  Harry sat down and waited as everyone else grabbed their glasses and took their seats. Pansy grabbed an empty wine bottle and placed it in the middle of the circle.</p>
<p>  "Okay so everyone knows the rules. Whoever the bottle lands on you have to kiss. Got it? Good."</p>
<p>  With the flick of her wand Pansy made the bottle spin. The air was practically vibrating with anticipation. After a few moments the bottle stopped, pointing directly at Hermione.</p>
<p>  "Oh Hermione. Get ready!" Ginny laughed.</p>
<p>  Pansy flicked her wand again and they all watched as the bottle span slower and slower until it landed on herself.</p>
<p>  "Oh my god this is going to be good." Blaise laughed.</p>
<p>  "Shut up Blaise." Pansy waved her hand as she crawled over to Hermione and sat in front of her. "Ready?"</p>
<p>  Hermione smiled and gently closed the gap between herself and Pansy. The kiss was slow, each movement more drawn out than the previous. Hermione slid her tongue into Pansy's mouth and smiled when Pansy let out a small gasp. After a few more seconds, Hermione pulled away.</p>
<p>  Harry sat there with his mouth wide open as Pansy made it back to her seat. He wasn't surprised that Hermione was up for it but what did surprise him was her enthusiasm and the way she lead the kiss.</p>
<p>  "Ron, you alright there mate?" Dean laughed.</p>
<p>  "Uh- uh yeah- yeah I- I'm okay." Ron stammered, staring at Hermione in shock.</p>
<p>  "Close your mouth Ronald, you'll catch fly's." Hermione chuckled, pushing Ron's jaw closed.</p>
<p>  Seamus flicked his wand and span the bottle. This time it landed on Ron.</p>
<p>  "I don't think Weasley's capable of doing anything after Granger and Pansy's affectionate display." Blaise laughed.</p>
<p>  Seamus flicked his wand again and everyone watched carefully as the bottle began to slow down. This time it landed on Harry.</p>
<p>  Ron chuckled a little. "Come on then mate."</p>
<p>  Harry laughed as he leaned in, grabbing Ron's cheek for stability. Ron closed the rest of the gap and put his hand on Harry's cheek. The kiss was slow, with Ron taking charge. After a few more dragged out pecks the kiss began to get more heated with Harry slipping his tongue into Ron's mouth. Ron didn't react, instead greeting Harry's tongue with even more enthusiasm. After a few seconds they parted with a small pop.</p>
<p>  "Wow." Pansy gaped.</p>
<p>  "You sure you're both straight?" Seamus laughed.</p>
<p>  "I'm comfortable enough with my masculinity to kiss a bloke and it not mean anything. So is Harry." Ron said.</p>
<p>  "I can't believe I just watched my brother kiss my ex boyfriend. What in merlin's beard just happened." Ginny said, her face twisted in pure trauma.</p>
<p>  They kept the game going for a while. Luna kissed Neville. Neville kissed Dean, Seamus kissed Pansy. Draco kissed Pansy. Blaise kissed Luna. Dean kissed Ron. Ginny kissed Hermione.</p>
<p>  Harry laughed as the bottle kept making its decisions. He smiled at the group in front of him, realising that he hadn't felt this happy in a long time. Harry smiled to himself, although it was the effects the alcohol numbing his sadness it was nice not to feel anything other than positive.</p>
<p>  Hermione span the bottle and they all watched as it landed on Harry. Hermione span the bottle again and the group went silent as the bottle stopped on Draco.</p>
<p>  Harry felt like an ice cold bucket of water had been poured over his head. The thought of kissing Draco made his stomach roll over and over again. His heart began to beat faster and he felt like he had lost of his breath.</p>
<p>  "Oh this is going to be good." Pansy shrieked.</p>
<p>  "I have been waiting for this day for so long." Seamus said as he clapped excitedly.</p>
<p>  Draco turned to face Harry, leaning in slightly. "Scared Potter?"</p>
<p>  Harry turned to face Draco and leaned in, leaving a small gap between their mouths. "You wish."</p>
<p>  Kissing Draco was like nothing he had ever felt before. Draco's lips were soft and warm. When the he gasped Harry wasted no time pushing his tongue into his mouth. He stroked Draco's tongue with his own, swallowing his moans with relish as he ravished his mouth.</p>
<p>  Harry pulled Draco closer, burying his fingers in the short blonde hair at the nape of his neck, trying to press his body as close to Draco's as he could, given the way they were sitting.</p>
<p>  "Oi!" Someone shouted from beside them, throwing a pillow at them both.</p>
<p>  Panting, Harry broke the kiss and shuffled back into his cushion as quickly as he could. Heat rose in his cheeks as blood surged to his dick. He clenched his hands around his glass of Firewhiskey, needing anything to occupy his mind from his growing erection.</p>
<p>  "Yeah, no sexual tension. None at all." Seamus laughed.</p>
<p>  "Harry never kissed me like that." Ginny said. "Come to think of it he never even kissed me the way he kissed Ron."</p>
<p>  Harry stared at Ginny in shock. When they broke up they talked everything out and agreed to be friends yet Ginny was suddenly making digs at everything Harry was doing. Maybe they weren't as okay as he thought.</p>
<p>  "Ginny. I'm sure that's not true." Ron said, giving her a look that Harry could never decipher.</p>
<p>  "You know he never had sex with me. Not through my lack of trying either."</p>
<p>  "Ginny." Ron warned.</p>
<p>  "What? I mean we're all being open with each other. Might as well be open about this."</p>
<p>  Harry laughed. "Seriously Ginny. You want to do this now?"</p>
<p>  "You never gave me an answer Harry! You were never completely honest with me and when it was all over you shut everyone out so I couldn't even talk to you about it!" Ginny was raising her voice now, causing other groups to look over in confusion.</p>
<p>  When Voldemort was still around Harry couldn't help but be occupied when it came to relationships. He found it hard to balance his love life when there was a chance that he would die before evening turning eighteen. If Ginny wanted honesty, then honesty she was going to get.</p>
<p>  "You want honesty Ginny? How could I have sex with you knowing that Voldemort could look inside my head. I didn't want him to see my most private moments. To invade my life more than he already did. I was disgusted with myself enough knowing that there was a piece of him living inside of me. I didn't want to get too close, knowing there was a possibility that I would die. I couldn't do that to you Ginny." </p>
<p>  Harry could feel the heat begin to rise in his cheeks again. Ginny needed the honesty but he couldn't believe that he had just confessed all of that in a room full of people.</p>
<p>  "I don't think Potter meant to be <em>that</em> honest in front of everyone." Blaise said, giving Harry a small smile.</p>
<p>  "Hm, is it Gryffindor courage or just the Firewhiskey?" Draco asks.</p>
<p>  "Personally I think the Firewhiskey. Harry's acts of Gryffindor courage were always more chaotic." Hermione giggled.</p>
<p>  "Harry I'm sorry, I didn't know." Ginny apologised.</p>
<p>  "It's not your fault Ginny. I didn't tell you. And for that I'm sorry." </p>
<p>  "Potter. What was it like?" Draco asked, before the silence could get too awkward.</p>
<p>  "What was what like?" Harry asked, giving Draco a confused look.</p>
<p>  "To have The Dark Lord in your head."</p>
<p>  "I won't lie mate, I have always been curious." Ron said.</p>
<p>  Harry wondered whether he should open up about his experiences with Voldemort. He knew that there was no point in keeping them to himself anymore. Voldemort was gone and he wasn't coming back. </p>
<p>  "Okay. Fine. If you all want to know, I'll show you." Harry said, looking at the group.</p>
<p>  "Harry, you're terrible at Occulmecy and Legilimency." Hermione stated.</p>
<p>  "Actually, the summer after Voldemort I decided to work on it. Properly this time. I didn't want anyone to be able to get into my head ever again. If no one wants to see just tell me."</p>
<p>  Each member of the group each nodded, indicating that they wanted to see what Harry was willing to show them.</p>
<p>  Harry closed his eyes and evened out his breathing. He focused on his own breath, cancelling out the rest of the noise in the room.</p>
<p>  "Legilimens."</p>
<p>  'Harry's scar burst open and he knew that he was dead: it was pain beyond imagining, pain past endurance. He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with bright eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the creature's began: they were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no escape. And when the creature spoke, it used Harry's mouth, so that in his agony he felt his jaw move.'</p>
<p>  'Voldemort raised his wand, and before Harry could do anything to defend himself, before he could even move, he had been hit again by the Cruciatus Curse. The pain was so intense, so all-consuming, that he no longer knew where he was... White-hot knives were piercing every inch of his skin, his head was surely going to burst with pain, he was screaming more loudly than he'd ever screamed in his life.'</p>
<p>  '"I DON'T CARE!" Harry yelled at them, picking up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace. "I'VE HAD ENOUGH, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I DON'T CARE ANYMORE--"'</p>
<p>  '"Harry Potter." Voldemort said very softly. His voice might have been part of the spitting fire. "The Boy Who Lived." Voldemort raised his wand. His head was still tilted to one side, like a curious child, wondering what would happen if he proceeded. Harry looked back into the bright eyes, and wanted it to happen now, quickly, while he could still stand, before he lost control, before he betrayed feae. He saw the mouth move and flash of green light, and everything was gone.'</p>
<p>  After a sharp intake of breath Harry opened his eyes. His head was throbbing with a dull pain and he downed his Firewhiskey, knowing that it would eventually cause his headache to subside.</p>
<p>  He looked up at the group, their faces matching with equal terror. Hermione and Pansy were wiping their eyes while Draco's face turned white.</p>
<p>  "No wonder why you've been so quiet Harry." Seamus said.</p>
<p>  "Seamus, really?" Dean replied as he punched him in the arm.</p>
<p>  "What? I mean I'd be quiet if I had to go through all that."</p>
<p>  "That's not even the half of it." Harry laughed. "I didn't want to overwhelm anyone. Sorry if it was too much."</p>
<p>  "You had to live through all of that. And while all of that was happening I made your life miserable. Potter I'm so sorry." Draco said, looking at Harry with a look of pure sadness.</p>
<p>  "Thank you Malfoy. It means a lot."</p>
<p>  Harry felt light headed all of a sudden. His vision began to blur and he could feel something warm and wet coming out of nose.</p>
<p>  "Woah, Potter. Are you okay?" Draco asked as he grabbed Harry's shoulders for support.</p>
<p>  "Aayaassssehhh ayaeehayaahathhaahaaaaaah. Ssaahayaeehseyythaassseyaa hatheeeyayaeehhasseeyhaseeyhaaaaaah."</p>
<p>  "Harry?" Hermione asked.</p>
<p>  "Hatheeeyseethaaahaassseyaa?" Harry replied.</p>
<p>  "Mate, you're speaking in Parseltongue." Ron said.</p>
<p>  "Aayaa haassssehh?"</p>
<p>  Harry shook his head. He rarely ever slipped into Parseltongue and even when he did, he was always able to shake himself out of it immediately. This seemed different, it was something he couldn't control.</p>
<p>  "Harry, are you okay?" Ginny asked, her voice trembling with concern.</p>
<p>  Aayaa- hassayesseythahassayaahath!"</p>
<p>  Harry closed his eyes in frustration and focused on his breathing. There was something wrong, something deep inside his core was itching to come out. A surge of anger quickly rose through him.</p>
<p>  "Potter, open your eyes and look at me." Draco asked as he gently placed his hand on the nape of Harry's neck.</p>
<p>  Harry opened his eyes ever so briefly before shutting them again. The small glimpse of Draco left him feeling furious for some reason. He could sense Draco's body stiffen, his hand falling ever so slightly on his neck.</p>
<p>  He focused on his breathing and pushed the anger back down where it had surged from. Not long ago Harry's kiss with Draco left him feeling aroused and now the pure sight of Draco made him want to lash out. Not even when Draco tormented him over the years had he been that angry, yet all he did was look at Harry to make him feel furious.</p>
<p>  The sudden change in emotion concerned him ever so slightly. He hadn't felt anger like that since fifth year.</p>
<p>  "Potter, are you okay?" Draco asked again as he reinforced his grip on Harry's neck.</p>
<p>  Harry slowly opened his eyes. He was met with blue eyes that were so grey that could resemble ice, yet Harry only felt warmth as he looked into them.</p>
<p>  "Yeah. Sorry, I-I don't know what came over me. I think it's time for me to go." Harry said quickly as he got up from his seat.</p>
<p>  "Are you sure mate?" Ron asked, giving him a look that Harry all too well. Ron was questioning him, to see if anything was wrong.</p>
<p>  Harry nodded his head, his expression nonchalant. "Yeah, I think I've had more than enough. I have Quidditch tomorrow anyway so I really should turn in."</p>
<p>  "Harry, we'll come with you." Hermione said, as she gave Ron a pleading look.</p>
<p>  "No, seriously it's fine. I'm just going to sleep anyway. Stay here and have fun."</p>
<p>  As Harry turned to walk to the door, Draco grabbed his arm and pulled himself up.</p>
<p>  "I'll make sure he gets back to Gryffindor tower. I have a meeting with Professor Slughorn before the match, so I better turn in too. Don't want to show up hungover and looking like shit." Draco said as he gave Harry a small smile.</p>
<p>  "Yep. I bet you'll make sure he backs to his room Malfoy." Seamus said.</p>
<p>  "Oh shut up Finnigan. You're obsessed. Goodnight everyone."</p>
<p>  There was a chorus of goodnights as Harry and Draco walked towards the door and out of the Room of Requirement. The walk back was silent but not awkward. They were nearly back at Gryffindor tower until Draco yanked Harry into the nearest alcove.</p>
<p>  "What the hell Malfoy?" Harry groaned as he rubbed the arm Draco had roughly pulled.</p>
<p>  "Potter what the hell was that back there?" Draco asked. His face was filled with concern and a slight edge of fear.</p>
<p>  "I don't know! Sometimes I switch between English and Parseltongue without realising I do it. I've never not been able to switch back before so that was a first." </p>
<p>  "Not that! When you opened your eyes to look at me the first time and you immediately closed them."</p>
<p>  "Yeah, what about it?"</p>
<p>  "Why did you close them again?"</p>
<p>  "What?"</p>
<p>  "Potter are you an idiot? I asked why you closed them again."</p>
<p>  "Fine! I got really angry at you all of a sudden! Is that what you want to hear?"</p>
<p>  "Why did you get angry?"</p>
<p>  "I- Honestly I have no idea."</p>
<p>  "That's because it wasn't you."</p>
<p>  Harry stared at Draco in confusion. If it wasn't Harry, then who the hell was it?</p>
<p>  "Potter, no one noticed because it was so brief but I did. When you opened your eyes they weren't yours. They were-"</p>
<p>  Harry's heart sunk. The feeling he felt had been familiar but he couldn't quite place it. Now he knew.</p>
<p>  "Voldemort's. They were Voldemort's eyes weren't they?" Harry asked, sighing as he leaned his back and head on the wall with a thud.</p>
<p>  "Yes. You don't sound surprised?" </p>
<p>  "It's not the first time it's happened."</p>
<p>  "Potter he's dead."</p>
<p>  "I know. But even after he died I still felt the same. After a while, when school started again, I felt myself becoming more agitated. That's why I haven't really spoken to anyone. I feel like it's fifth year again and I've just been putting it off. If he's not dead I don't understand how he's not. Wait- why am I telling you this?"</p>
<p>  Harry rubbed his scar, the headache from earlier was stronger now, only it wasn't just a headache. It was his scar hurting.</p>
<p>  "It's hurting isn't it. Your scar?" Draco asked, moving closer to Harry.</p>
<p>  Harry nodded and closed his eyes again. He didn't feel angry, he just needed to think.</p>
<p>  "Potter, you need to tell Weasley and Granger."</p>
<p>  "I know. I will. I'll tell them after the game tomorrow. I don't want them to worry."</p>
<p>  "Potter, for what it's worth. I'm here if you need to... talk."</p>
<p>  "Wow. That is completely unexpected. Coming from you."</p>
<p>  "Yes, well, given that my face made your eyes turn into The Dark Lord's it's hardly surprising that I'm offering my assistance for a nice chat. Come on, it's late. And you've got a game to play tomorrow."</p>
<p>  As they walked, Harry could feel Draco's tension. He was itching to say something and although Harry normally would keep the silence, he found himself curious as to what Draco obviously had on his mind.</p>
<p>  "You've got something on your mind. Go ahead and ask." Harry said, turning to face Draco ever so slightly.</p>
<p>  "It wasn't something that I wanted to ask. More something that I wanted to say." Draco admitted.</p>
<p>  "Go on then."</p>
<p>  "That day at the manor. Of course I knew it was you. But I also knew that I was on the wrong side of the war. When The Dark Lord was living at the manor, when you were doing whatever it is that you were doing, that was effecting him. He was scared. After that I knew there was a possibility that you could kill him. I couldn't hand you over."</p>
<p>  "After that night at the astronomy tower I can't say that I was surprised when you didn't hand me over."</p>
<p>  "How did you know about that night? I have always wondered. You came running after Snape and I, furious, telling Snape he was a cowered and I was so frightened because I knew you had seen."</p>
<p>  "I had just arrived back with Dumbledore. We went on a mission. He heard you coming and told me to hide. When Snape came along I thought he was going to help but then he did what he did. I saw you lower your wand, I knew you wasn't going to do it."</p>
<p>  "Snape-"</p>
<p>  "Snape only did it for you, I know. I was furious with him. Little did I know, Dumbledore was actually dying. He also knew that Voldemort had asked you to kill him. He knew you wouldn't be able to go through with it so he made Snape promise to do it if you were to fail."</p>
<p>  "I-I never knew that."</p>
<p>  "What happened with your mother and father after? I can't imagine they were too pleased when I left with your wands and everyone else."</p>
<p>  "Turns out mother only ever did anything for me. I mean I knew she cared but because of the way father and Bellatrix were she just kept quiet. She knew that I would be threatened if she were to go against family beliefs. I can't blame her really, I did the same. Father on the other hand was not best pleased. I paid the price for letting you go but I would do it again in a heartbeat. It wasn't until I saw how much of a coward he was when The Dark Lord set up camp at the manor that I realised all of his influence and entitlement over the years had been a lie. And I followed that path without question."</p>
<p>  "So no more 'my father will hear about this' then?"</p>
<p>  Draco laughed. "No. Definitely not. He's not speaking to me at the minute anyway. Said I'm a disgrace to the Malfoy name. Think he's forgetting that he's already done a pretty good job of it."</p>
<p>  "Oh wow, that seems dramatic, even for him. What did you do?"</p>
<p>  "Mother and father were in France at our holiday home. They came back early and father discovered me shagging some bloke I brought back on a drunken night out."</p>
<p>  "Oh wow."</p>
<p>  "Yes. It's not pleasant for your father to find out your gay when you're in balls deep. Quite literally."</p>
<p>  "He thinks you're a disgrace because you're gay?"</p>
<p>  "No. He has friends who are gay. He's just pissed that I'm the only Malfoy heir and if I don't have a biological child then the Malfoy name won't live on. For the first time in forever I'm deciding what I want and I don't even know if I want kids. It's too early on in my life to think about that anyway. I'm going to pass my NEWTS, get a job I enjoy and see what happens from there."</p>
<p>  The revelation that Draco was gay bothered Harry, but not in a negative way. It bothered him that Draco could very well be attracted to Harry and he found himself wishing that to be true. </p>
<p>  "Well. Here we are." Draco announced as they arrived outside the portrait to Gryffindor common room.</p>
<p>  "Thanks, for making sure I got back. I do feel fine though."</p>
<p>  "Just wanted to make sure Golden Boy got back safe. After all, you have got an important game to play tomorrow."</p>
<p>  "Oh shut up. We're playing against Slytherin. I assumed you would want me to be playing at my worst."</p>
<p>  "Yes well I have got over my pettiness Potter. I like to watch a good game."</p>
<p>  Harry smiled at Draco and Draco returned the smile.</p>
<p>  "Goodnight Malfoy." Harry said as the portrait hole swung open.</p>
<p>  "Goodnight Potter." Draco replied as he turned and began to walk away.</p>
<p>  As he climbed through the portrait hole he had the odd feeling that Draco hadn't entirely left. When he turned around he could see Draco contemplating on whether to go or to come back.</p>
<p>  "You've got something to ask Malfoy. Go ahead and ask it." Harry shouted.</p>
<p>  "It doesn't bother you, does it?" Draco shouted back. "The fact that I'm gay?"</p>
<p>  Harry's heart sunk. His friends were gay and dating each other. Draco had to know that. Harry had cursed himself for giving Draco any indication that he wasn't comfortable with Draco for being gay. He really was so oblivious at times.</p>
<p>  "Not in the slightest. If I was, I wouldn't have kissed you."</p>
<p>  "That was before you knew I was gay. What about now?"</p>
<p>  "I'd do it again without hesitation."</p>
<p>  Draco smiled and let out a small laughed as he turned around and walked further away, towards his own common room.</p>
<p>  Harry ran up to his bed and lay there. For once this year he was going to bed happy. He hadn't meant to make it seem like he wanted to kiss Draco again, but he found himself admitting that his words weren't a lie.</p>
<p>  He wanted to kiss Draco Malfoy again. Shit.</p>
