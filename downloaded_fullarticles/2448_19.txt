    <p>A boy with bright green emerald eyes and messy, midnight black hair was sat alone in a compartment, curled up on the seat watching the noisy Weasley family say goodbye to the Weasley twins, Ron, and Ginny. The youngest Weasleys' who are still attending Hogwarts. The twins being two years older than Harry and Ron whilst Ginny was in the year below them.</p><p><br/>Also standing on the platform was Hermione, also saying goodbye to her parents. Harry craved having parents but his were dead killed by Voldemort, when Harry was only just a year old. The sound of a group of teenagers laughing brought Harry out of his thoughts about that fateful night He looked at the door hoping that it was anyone but Gryffindors who would take him to Hermione and/or Ron or if it was Gryffindors please let it be Neville and/or the twins.</p><p>But when the compartment door opened it wasn’t Gryffindors no, it wasn’t Ravenclaws or Hufflepuffs either no it was Slytherins. The group consisted of Malfoy, Zabini, Nott, Parkinson, Greengrass and Davis. As soon as they saw him they all stopped laughing at once. “Potter? What are you doing here alone? Why aren't you with the mudblood and the weasel?" Malfoy asks with obvious disgust but with a little surprise and curiosity. Harry looks at him with no challenge in his eyes and as he moves his glamour shifts a little before settling back down again. “Is it alright if I stay her I won’t be a bother. Please, don’t make me go back to… to that filthy, annoying, know-it-all mudblood and that weasel who has no manners and beats me a little when I step out of line.” Begs Harry not caring that he just told them that Ron beats him all the time.</p><p>The group was stunned into silence at Harry’s sudden outburst but more stunned that Ron would do such a thing to his friend. Parkinson was the first to react, as she slides down and sat next to Harry and took his hand in her, not missing his slight wince at her touch, “Darling, how could he do that to you, I mean he is you best friend. And as for Granger, well what you said is true but she’s also best friend, right?” Parkinson tries to get some answers from the boy. Harry looks up from their interlocked hands and at her and the other Slytherins who have sat down as well. “Can I trust you to keep a secret? All of you?” Harry asks them eventually looking at them all in turn his gaze lingering on Malfoy the longest. They all nod when his gaze reaches them all looking confused. “They aren’t my friends. Dumbledore pays them to pretend to be my friends and punish me if I step out of line. The mudblood pleasures herself when Weasley beats me. She keeps asking for more as though her life depends on it. She won’t let me pick up a book or learn for myself. Please don’t make me go back there.” Harry looks at the Slytherins to see them looking at him with pity and sadness.</p><p>“Harry, is it alright if I call you that? We are not letting you step foot in Gryffindor again. We are asking Professor Snape if you can transfer to Slytherin and if he says yes then you ae a Slytherin if he says no then tough you are a Slytherin. You can be a Slytherin, right?” Greengrass says to him meaningfully. “And if we ever see the weasel and the mudblood we will give them the beating of their lives!” Says Malfoy dangerously. Nobody but Harry notices the slight greening of his eyes and some strands of his hair go darker.</p><p>For the rest of the ride they all talk and teach Harry things he should know but Granger hid from him.</p><p>When the reach Hogsmeade station they accompany Harry to Hogwarts in the carriages. “Did anyone else see those skeleton horses pulling the carriages?” Harry asks the group confusedly. The Slytherins all shake their heads apart from Malfoy who says, “Oh those things they are called thestrals, they are completely harmless. You can only see them if you have seen someone die. I saw my grandmother die. I hated her, but it still hit me. What about you who have you seen die? Oh, and uh by the way you can call us by our first names now.” Draco gives Harry a soft smile. Harry shyly smiles back. “Well uh the thing is I haven’t seen anyone die. But I’ve always seen them. Weasel and mudblood thought I was crazy when I mentioned them.” Harry answers Draco truthfully. Daphne and Tracey take one of his hands each and gently squeeze them in an attempt to comfort him. "Hey your safe now and for what it's worth we believe you and don't think your crazy." Says Theo smiling warmly. Blaise adds, "And we now believe you to Draco, ok before you go on a rant."</p>
