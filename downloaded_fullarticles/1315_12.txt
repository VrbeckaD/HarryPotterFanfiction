    <p>“You shouldn’t be here,” Credence said, more like a whisper than anything else, as delicate twilight squeezed in through the cracks in the attic and lit up the flying dust. When he speaks, he still slurs his words, and the ambiguous rhythm between the words cannot be part clearly, which is similar to the heavy tongue-and-throat complex tone in the local intonation.</p><p>"Aye?" The New Yorker returned with his seadog-like short syllable, his cheeks reddened with his motorcycle helmet, and his ears hung flat on both sides of his head. Brock stepped on the old wooden floor in his boots, looked like an old cowboy in the 40s, except that his heels were not spikes, but sticking to a piece of gum. That was not a lasso hung in his waist, but a baker. "Hello Phoenix," he said, kneeling to the ground and rubbing the chick. Phoenix shrank and pecked his fingertips. "Hi beauty, how are we today?"</p><p>The sixteen-year-old answered "That’s not his name" in a low voice, and only the shadow beneath the man seemed to echo him, surging very briefly. This little yellow fluffy traitor made a tender chirp and sang along with the man. "Yes, damn weather, black and black. I cannot catch the sun anywhere.”</p><p>Occasionally there was a very distant alarm on the other side of the street. It tore the silence and soon subsided. Eddie didn't drive his motorcycle anymore, the cost of repairing the old rig would be better for him to buy a new one. Moreover, roaming a Harley on the retro Champs Elysees and slate avenues will only attract more obscure attention. Eddie doesn't need attention. He doesn't need it so very much. What he wants is covert publicity. The White house white sunlight while clouds in LA are suitable for him to turn the throttle twist to 200 and head straight to the news scene, but apparently in Paris, black carriages and lace decorations may be more suitable for outsiders to travel.</p><p>Venom hates both, horse and lace. He came by bus.</p><p>"You cannot come," Credence repeated vaguely to himself, his back arched so deep that his shoulders seemed overwhelmed by all of this, and his eyes stuck stubbornly to a wormhole in the floor. He still wore that ridiculous circus vest and looked like a gambling bartender who had run out of a strip club and killed himself.</p><p>Eddie doesn't know what happened to him, but it must be related to the recent crazy murder cases in Paris. "There's no such thing as 'can't'," he answered confidently, almost mysteriously. Venom didn’t rush him, he wanted to see what was hidden in this boy.</p><p>Credence finally raised his head. His eyes and cheeks were deeply sunken. His face was sick and pale. The short spurs of stubble and sideburns grew back, much like Maria Eddie had seen through the reinforced glass door. ‘<em>He's begging me to save him</em>.’</p><p><strong>No, he didn't</strong>. Venom said.</p><p>"What?" Credence trembled and asked in bewilderment.</p><p>Eddie tried to focus on the boy. "Do you want to talk about it?" He flattened his palm and put the chick back on the wooden box, which was her nest. Phoenix leaned against Credence and Credence leaned against Phoenix, as if his body was still at the scene of the earthquake, occasionally trembling ever so lightly. Eddie watched the surveillance video that Dr. Dan Lewis erased in the system. When Venom returned to his body, the symbiote and his body gradually synchronized, just as your brain was trying to make sure your body was still alive, it could cause spasms and twitches in some part of the body. <strong>I hate that. Don't do that again.</strong> Venom is talking like a chattering director's voice track, and the remote control is still <em>not</em> in Eddie's hands. The only thing to be grateful for is that his poker face has been practiced to perfect, even if it's Riot himself—</p><p>Credence is still not accustomed to being given the option. He was not born to reject people, but he does not know where to start too, let alone this American journalist who came here from nowhere half a month ago suddenly just 'hit it off' with him, that is way too suspicious, even for Credence's taste.</p><p>Eddie watched the boy's eyes wandering around, Credence was bursting with black sparks on his skin. He gritted his teeth and breathed a long breath. The veins of his hands swelled, more pitiful than horrible. Eddie has always been this lousy friend in Brooklyn. He can't learn to tame a cruel and helpless soul with a civilized slap. If let Carlton deals it, it might be a lot easier. "You said you were in Paris—"</p><p>"—For my mother." Credence quickly answered, and then he was silent again.</p><p>"Did you?" Eddie asked.</p><p>Credence was surprised at his question, but relaxed a little. He shook his head. "No," the syllable had consumed all his strength. Credence could not bend any more. The black flocculent substance that Eddie was already familiar with appeared on him again.</p><p><strong>That's what I’m talking about</strong>. Venom said happily. Eddie pressed him hard back. Credence did not pay attention to his distraction. Credence was tense with something ready to go.</p><p>" Credence," Nagini appeared silently at the door, signaling that someone was coming.</p>
