  <strong>Chapter 1</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>Harry wasn’t dumb, he knew how he was treated by the Dursley’s was wrong, no matter what they said. Then again, he’d heard Neville’s account of being dropped out a window and knocked off a wharf, so maybe the Magical world didn’t care how relatives treated children either. He’d tried to ask the Headmaster about spending the summer anywhere else, who knew what they would do to him now he was a magic student? But the man had just waved him off before he really got to say much. There was no point trying McGonagall, she hadn’t listened about the Stone so why would she listen now?</p><p> </p><p>Harry knew he’d slacked off this year, but he had gotten used to it since they didn’t like when he scored better than Dudley. By the time he had realised he had been stuck in a groove, slacking off with Ron and letting Hermione take top spot. He swore he would do better next year and would do a good job with his summer work.</p><p> </p><p>Then there was the whole mess with Quirell, he didn’t like it at all. Those traps…had they been meant for them? Brooms for a Seeker, chess for a chess master, logic puzzle for the best and brightest…would they have really slowed an adult done at all? He didn’t like feeling like he’d been set up to what? Kill Quirell? Find the stone? Die? The Headmaster refused to tell him why Voldemort was so interested in him either.</p><p> </p><p>He’d gotten Madam Pomphrey to release him earlier than originally planned, he’d had to swear not to go looking for trouble of course. He slipped into the library and went to work looking for books on the government. He’d heard the Ministry and Wizengamot mentioned, there had to be books on them.</p><p> </p><p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</p><p>Amelia looked up as a regal looking snowy owl flew into her office, several Aurors chasing it. The owl landed on her desk and imperiously held its leg out, revealing a letter. “Get back to work,” she ordered, amused that an owl had outwitted this year’s trainees. She quickly cast some charms on the letter and found no magic on it even as the owl hooted indignantly. She then reached out and relieved the animal of its burden, but the owl didn’t leave, simply getting comfortable on the back of the visitor chair. She chuckled and opened the letter to find rather messy handwriting, obviously someone new to a quill.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>To the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>My name is Harry Potter and I am a student at Hogwarts. I found your department in a book in the library and am hoping you can help me with some legal matters or suggest someone else who can. This is my owl Hedwig, she is very smart and will wait for your answer.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sincerely,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry Potter</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Amelia blinked and read the letter again. She’d known Mr Potter had repapered, Susan had been quick to write of his appearance at Hogwarts. She then looked to the now sleeping owl, she was a very beautiful bird and obviously smart. She had never expected to get a letter from the Boy-Who-Lived himself, her niece had mentioned him in her very first letter home, stating that he had been sorted into Gryffindor after the longest Sorting of anybody there which was interesting. She would like to know what other House or Houses the hat had considered for him. She had almost ended up in Gryffindor herself after all. But what could he be asking for help for? She doubted he had intended for her to receive his letter since he had addressed it so generally, but she would like to sate her curiosity. She picked up her appointment book and looked through it, as today was the fifteenth of June she would be picking up Susan from the station later and then she was solidly booked for the next week and a bit but after that she could fit him in. So, she took out parchment and quill and wrote him a short note.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Dear Mr Potter,</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I have received your letter and am happy to meet with you. I will arrive at your house on the thirtieth of June at 10am. If this is not acceptable, please send a note as soon as possible so that we can arrange an alternate date.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sincerely,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Madam Amelia Bones</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Head of the DMLE</em>
</p><p> </p><p>That date would give him time to settle in back at home as well which was always good. She had found that when discussing legal issues with children it was best for them to be relaxed. She sealed the note and then turned to the owl who hopped back onto the desk and held her leg out patiently. “This is for your owner, fly safely.” She told the bird who took off, hoping to reach Harry while he was on the train.</p><p> </p><p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</p><p>Harry frowned as he stared out at Privet Drive, unable to see any owls. He had received the reply from Madam Bones which had been a shock, he had not intended to contact the head of the whole department, that had to be Hedwig going above and beyond. But since returning home there had been nothing, despite Ron and Hermione promising to write. Things hadn’t been too bad so far, the Dursley’s were scared he would use magic on them so while they locked him in his room he didn’t have the massive lists of chores this summer. His trunk had been locked up in his old cupboard, but he had managed to smuggle his wand, cloak, some sweets and his homework up to his room where he hid it under the loose floorboard. He would have liked his photo album, but he really did need to get his homework done.</p><p> </p><p>The homework itself didn’t look too bad, he’d started on the transfiguration essay after looking them all over. He didn’t know how he was going to do the potions essay, a quick look had shown nothing relevant in the textbook. Hopefully potions would be scheduled later in the week this year and he could get it written in the first week back.</p><p> </p><p>He was nervous about the upcoming meeting, he hadn’t really interacted with anyone outside the shop owners at Diagon Alley, the goblins and Hogwarts staff and students. How did you talk to a Department Head? The book hadn’t given any ideas on that, it had just listed the basic layout of the government and where to find the public access to the Ministry. He was going to meet someone important in his cousins’ massive hand-me-downs since his school robes were locked up. Not that he really liked the school uniform, robes were rather ridiculous. He’d almost prefer his old school uniform, at least that was trousers and shirt with a sweater. The older year boys had said they could wear normal clothes under the robes, it wasn’t like anyone would be able to tell unless your robes flipped up.</p><p> </p><p>Wizards were so…. backwards. he’d listened when in the Alley, despite how overwhelmed he’d felt, it was like they knew nothing of the normal world, despite how closely they lived or at least worked, to it. Electricity a fad? Horse drawn carts? They lived in the Victorian era at least and didn’t seem to care that the world was passing them by. What he wouldn’t give for a pen and paper in class rather than those horrible quills and parchment.</p><p> </p><p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</p><p>Harry sat at his wobbly desk, working on his essay. Tomorrow was the big day but tonight…well he was hoping to be invisible tonight. Hedwig pecked at the lock slung through her cage door, then glowered at Harry. “I can't, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon –" At the sound of the name, Hedwig squawked again, louder.</p><p> </p><p>“Har-ry Pot-ter!” Uncle Vernon’s voice could be heard even upstairs, and Harry flinched before looking to his owl and first friend</p><p> </p><p>“Now you've done it.” He quickly hid his homework and ran downstairs to find the family in the kitchen, Aunt Petunia cooking while Uncle Vernon struggled with Dudley’s bow tie, shooting a glare at Harry.</p><p> </p><p>“I warned you. If you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to go,” the massive man snarled.</p><p> </p><p>“She's bored. If I could just let her out for an hour or two –” Harry tried on her behalf.</p><p> </p><p>“And have you sending secret messages to your freaky little friends? No, sir.”</p><p> </p><p>“But I haven't gotten any messages, from any of my friends. Not one. All summer,” he argued, and it worried him. Didn’t they want to be friends anymore?</p><p> </p><p>“Who'd want to be friends with you?” Dudley demanded as he sneered at his cousin who ignored him.</p><p> </p><p>“I should think you'd be more grateful. We raise you since you were a baby, give you food off our table, even let you have Dudley's second bedroom... purely out of the goodness of our hearts,” Vernon ranted, and Harry bit his cheek to keep from saying something he’d be made to regret.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought he got the second bedroom because Mum was afraid he'd turn us into dung beetles if you put him back in the cupboard under the stairs,” Dudley whined even as his parents exchanged a look. Seeing them occupied he reached a finger for the pudding.</p><p> </p><p>“Not yet, popkin. That's for when the Masons arrive,” Petunia gently pulled him back.</p><p> </p><p>“Which should be any moment. Now. Let's run through our schedule one more time. Petunia, when the Masons get here, you will be –"</p><p> </p><p>“In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home,” she smiled and removed her apron.</p><p> </p><p>“Good. And Dudley?”</p><p> </p><p>“I'll be waiting to open the door.” Dudley puffed out his chest before bowing grandly and Harry rolled his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Excellent,” Vernon praised before turning on Harry. “And you?”</p><p> </p><p>“I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I don't exist.”</p><p> </p><p>“Too right you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career,” he grinned, and the doorbell rang. Vernon shoved Harry out of the kitchen and into the hallway. “Upstairs!   Hurry!” he ordered, and Harry quickly ran up the stairs, retreating to the safety of his room.</p><p> </p><p>Harry entered, turned, and stopped dead; a tiny creature with bat-like ears and bulging green eyes was jumping on his bed as if it were a trampoline.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry Potter! Such an honour it is!”</p><p> </p><p>“What... Who are you?” Harry was utterly stunned but the sight.</p><p> </p><p>“Dobby, sir. Dobby the house elf.”</p><p> </p><p>“I see. Not to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.” Harry moved further into the room, keeping an eye on Dobby the whole time.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, yes, sir, Dobby understands. It's just that, Dobby has come to tell you... it is difficult, sir... Dobby wonders where to begin.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why don't you sit down?” Harry offered warily, not sure what else to do at the moment. Weren’t there wards on the house or something? That was why he’d been sent back after all.</p><p> </p><p>“S-s-sit down?” Suddenly Dobby burst into tears and wailing.</p><p> </p><p>“Shhhh! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you or anything –” he panicked, expecting Vernon to appear any second.</p><p> </p><p>Dobby stopped crying and stared at him. “Offend Dobby! Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal...”</p><p> </p><p>“You can't have met many decent wizards then,” Harry snorted, poor thing probably met the Malfoy’s or something.</p><p> </p><p>Dobby shook his head, then without warning, leapt off the bed and started to bang his head furiously on the floor. “Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!”</p><p> </p><p>Downstairs Vernon was pouring champagne for Mr and Mrs Mason as a banging noise began above them. All eyes shifted to him and he chuckled nervously. “Don't mind that. It's just the... cat.”</p><p> </p><p>“Cat?   What cat?” Dudley asked, and Vernon shot him a glare.</p><p> </p><p>“Our cat, tiger.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry was relieved when Dobby got back to his feet, wobbling, eyes spinning dizzily. Harry regarded him with a mixture of concern... and wariness. “Are you... all right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Dobby had to punish himself, sir. Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir.”</p><p> </p><p>“Your... family?”</p><p> </p><p>“The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they ever knew   Dobby was here...” Dobby shuddered in fear and then looked up and whispered urgently. “But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter. To warn him. Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.”</p><p> </p><p>“Not go back?   But... I have to,” Harry told him firmly, this place was nothing more than a prison.</p><p> </p><p>“There is a plot. A plot to make most terrible things happen. If Harry Potter goes back to school he will be in great danger,” Dobby tried to explain without saying anything he couldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>“What terrible things? Who's plotting them?” Harry pushed, and Dobby made a funny chocking and gagging noise. “Okay! I understand. You can't say –” but it was too late as Dobby grabbed the bedside lamp and started beating himself about the head and yelping loudly.</p><p> </p><p>Vernon is in the midst of telling a joke. “They arrive at the ninth hole and –” yelps from upstairs interrupted.</p><p> </p><p>“Sounds as if that cat of yours has dragged something in with it, Dursley,” Mr Mason commented.</p><p> </p><p>“Not to worry. I'll sort it out,” he managed a smile before moving quickly upstairs, well as quickly as a man of his size could move.</p><p> </p><p>Harry wrestled the lamp away from Dobby. “Stop! Stop!”</p><p> </p><p>Footsteps thundered on the landing and harry paled. Quickly, Harry grabbed Dobby by the pillowcase and pitched him into the wardrobe... just as the door was flung open.</p><p> </p><p>“What the devil are you doing up here! You've just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke. One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy!” Vernon snarled, and Harry cringed away from him as the man stomped from the room, slamming the door.</p><p> </p><p>Harry waited a few seconds before he let Dobby out of the wardrobe. “See why I've got to go back? I don't belong here. I belong in your world -- at Hogwarts. It's the only place I've got... friends.”</p><p> </p><p>“Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?” Dobby asked slyly, and Harry frowned.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I expect they've been -- hang on, how do you know my friends haven't been writing me?” he demanded, there was only one way he could think of.</p><p> </p><p>Guiltily, Dobby took out a stack of letter. “Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby -- Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him... Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir...”</p><p> </p><p>“Give me those. Now,” Harry demanded, holding his hand out. Dobby looked at him sadly, then dashed out the door. Harry flew desperately after, Dobby bouncing like a ping-pong ball down the stairs and into the kitchen. As Harry raced in, he found Dobby on the counter, waving his arms. Aunt Petunia's masterpiece of a pudding rose, then floated into the living room, hovering over the Mason's heads. The Masons didn’t see, but the Dursley’s could and stared with horrified expressions. “Dobby... Please... No...” Harry whispered in terror.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school.”</p><p> </p><p>“I can't. Hogwarts is my home.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then Dobby must do it, sir,” Dobby whispered sadly. “For Harry Potter's own good.” He snapped his fingers and the pudding plummeted onto the Masons.</p><p> </p><p>They jumped up, blinking, covered head to foot in pudding. They quickly moved to leave the house with Vernon and Petunia racing after them.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm sorry. It's our nephew. Very disturbed. Meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs...” Vernon tried to explain as they left the house.</p><p> </p><p>“We have ice cream...” Petunia offered but the Masons got in the car and drove off just as a shrieking sound split the sky.</p><p> </p><p>An owl swooped down and dropped a letter at Vernon's feet. He picked up the letter and opened it. As he read it, a mad gleam danced in Vernon's eye. He turned and raced back inside the house. Aunt Petunia followed in confusion. Vernon waddled back into the living room, extending the letter to Harry. “Go on. Read it.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry took it warily and saw it was on parchment. “Dear Mr. Potter. We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence at twelve minutes past seven this evening. As you know, underage wizards...” his heart sank as Vernon finished it for him.</p><p> </p><p>“... are not permitted to perform spells outside school.” He snatched the letter back. “You didn't tell us you weren't allowed to use magic at home. Slipped your mind, didn't it?” He snarled before smirking. “Well, I've got news for you, boy. I'm locking you up! And if you try to magic yourself out, they'll expel you! You're never going back to that school! Never!” He grabbed Harry’s arm and dragged him back upstairs, throwing him into the bedroom. Harry cringed as he hit the floor, hard, but he didn’t make a noise. Then he heard the sound he dreaded more than anything, Vernon’s belt sliding free. “You need another lesson on lying boy.”</p><p> </p><p>When Vernon left a while later he swiftly locked the bedroom door, securing it with several padlocks. The next morning bars were affixed to the window and a cat flap cut into the door, not that Harry was paying any attention as he tried to sleep off the pain of the lashing.</p><p> </p><p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</p><p>Amelia walked up the drive towards number 4, taking in the sameness of all the houses on the street. She didn’t understand how people could live in such cookie cutter houses. She liked her home to have personality and Bones Manor certainly did, even if it was far too large for just her and Susan. She was dressed in a good quality conservative muggle suite to fit in, unlike many she knew how to pass as a muggle since she had to work with the police occasionally. She subtly scanned the house with a spell as she approached, to ensure the wards would allow her passed, and frowned, she had detected the famed blood wards, but they were barely registering. It would take almost no effort to bring them tumbling down and that didn’t make sense, Mr Potter had lived here for ten years straight before leaving for Hogwarts, they should be impenetrable. Something was very wrong. She made it to the door and knocked firmly.</p><p> </p><p>Petunia opened the door and saw the woman in a suite before sneering. “We don’t want anything.” She went to slam the door.</p><p> </p><p>Amelia quickly put her foot in the gap. “Mrs. Dursley? I am Amelia Bones and I have an appointment with your nephew, Mr. Potter,” she informed the woman only to watch her go red in anger.</p><p> </p><p>“Potter? There’s no Potter here! Go away you freak!” She snarled angrily, and every instinct Amelia had honed over the years as an Auror screamed out that something was very wrong here. The tiny file the Ministry held stated very clearly that Petunia Dursley was the maternal Aunt and guardian of young Mr Potter. The file too brought more questions, there was a lot missing and the little that was in it was very secure, she’d had to use her authority as Department Head to even read it.</p><p> </p><p>“Mrs Dursley I should point out that I am the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, I know very well who you are and who lives in this house. You can either let me inside or I will return with a full Auror squad and warrant to search the premises,” she commanded coldly and Petunia recoiled, no wonder the wards were so weak if this was how the woman reacted to a magical person.</p><p> </p><p>It would have been different if Vernon was home, but he was at work and Dudley was off with his friends, alone Petunia just didn’t want to stand up to a witch, and a full squad of them on the doorstep would just be fuel for gossip. It was better to let the woman in and get rid of her again as quickly as possible. Vernon wanted the boy locked away in his room forever, she wanted him gone, out of her normal house for good. Who knew if that horrible man would be back to give her precious boy more than just a tail?</p><p> </p><p>Amelia walked inside, trained eye immediately taking in the lack of any sign a magical child lived inside the home, even in fully muggle homes there was usually some small sign, a bit of parchment or quill or even a book that could reasonably pass as muggle fiction. As well as that, there were no pictures of young Potter at all, just the woman and what must be her husband and child. She shook off the unflattering thoughts comparing them to various muggle animals and released her wand from its holster, her sleeve still mostly concealing it. Rather than aggravate the obviously angry and scared woman who had retreated to the kitchen, she subtly flicked her wand and the small door beneath the staircase began glowing as well as a trail leading upstairs. Curious she opened the door, despite the woman’s sudden objections, only to freeze. It wasn’t the sight of the padlocked school trunk that caused the reaction but the sight of the small mattress and ratty blankets as well as the shakily scrawled words on the wall ‘Harry’s Room’. She felt utterly sick as she took in the signs of just what the saviour of their world had suffered through. It was obvious the space had been thoroughly cleaned by muggle methods but even so, she spotted the dark stain towards the back and knew what it was, old blood. She pulled out her badge and tapped a sequence into it with her wand, sending for an investigative squad and a healer. “Mrs Dursley at this time I have to warn you that I am placing you under arrest.”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have the authority, we aren’t freaks,” Petunia sneered, and Amelia shook her head.</p><p> </p><p>“In taking Mr Potter in you became liable to our laws where he is concerned so yes, I do have the authority,” Amelia told her before herding her back into the kitchen and locking her within after ensuring there was no phone she could use to warn her husband. Amelia then followed the trail upstairs, pausing as she heard the sound of multiple apparition.</p><p> </p><p>“Madam Bones?” A familiar voice called.</p><p> </p><p>“In here Robards, secure the premises. I need a full search of this house, take special note of the cupboard under the stairs. Healer Jones please come upstairs with me,” she ordered, and the team quickly moved to obey. She made it to the top of the stairs and saw a door glowing from her tracking spell, a door with a cat flap and far too many bolts on it. They exchanged concerned glances before she spelled the locks open and pushed the door in. They entered the room, wands in hand and looked around in shock. The bedroom was small and the only furniture inside was rickety and old. A familiar snowy owl was locked in her cage, looking a bit too skinny. But on the bed was a lump that had Jones moving forward quickly. She leant over the lump and reached out to touch it only to startle as it moved. Slowly a head of messy dark hair was revealed and then dull green eyes stared at them. “Mr Potter, its Amelia Bones and this is Healer Maggie Jones. Are you hurt?” She asked gently.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you here to arrest me?” He asked croakily, and Amelia frowned.</p><p> </p><p>“Why would I do that?”</p><p> </p><p>“For using magic, but it wasn’t me.” He answered even as Jones gently helped him sit up. He swayed but managed to stay upright as she began running scans.</p><p> </p><p>“No Mr Potter, we have an appointment this morning, remember? Just relax and let Healer Jones work, alright?” She asked, and he nodded.</p><p> </p><p>Maggie worked quickly, appalled by what she found. “I am ordering his immediate removal from this house Madam Bones. This place is obviously unsafe for him. Unless a home can be found for him he will be placed in the Ministry’s custody.”</p><p> </p><p>“Until we are ready to go to court no one can get wind of this, therefore I will take him in,” Amelia answered, staring at the worn-out child on the bed. She unlocked the owls’ cage and opened the window, removing the bars. “Have a good hunt and then go to Bones Manor,” he told the owl who hooted softly before leaving her cage. She flew over to the bed and nipped the boys’ ear gently before flying out the window. “Is it safe to move him? Does he need St Mungo’s?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I can handle things here and then finish at your home.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good.” She quickly made a portkey and handed it over. “Take him as soon as he can travel. I will keep an eye on things here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes ma’am.” She cast a few numbing charms on Harry and then used the portkey to take them to Bones Manor.</p><p> </p><p>As soon as they were gone Amelia began looking around the room, finding the piles of broken toys as well as the oversized clothes in the rickety wardrobe. She felt a floorboard squeak and knelt to pry it up, shocked to find a wand, an invisibility cloak, school supplies and the remains of some treats from the Hogwarts Express. “Robards!” She called, and he quickly joined her, evidence book open and a camera around his neck.</p><p> </p><p>“Boss is this…I saw the name in the cupboard,” he looked at his boss with wide eyes. He had been an Auror for almost a decade now, but he’d never seen anything like that cupboard.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, this was Harry Potter’s home. Not a word is to be said to anyone outside the team until the court case, am I clear?” She glared, and he nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes ma’am.” He lifted his camera and she pointed out the contents of the floor. He photographed them and then she gathered them up to return to their owner. He then moved onto the rest of the room, taking extra time with the various methods used to lock the young wizard inside as well as the evidence of blood on the bed sheets. “How badly is his injured?” He finally asked.</p><p> </p><p>“He’s been taken for further treatment but there is nothing life threatening since we got here in time,” she assured him and then moved out of the room to look around the rest of the house. It made her sick to compare the conditions the last Potter lived in with the rest of his ‘family’. Technically child abuse was something of a grey area in Wizarding law, people knew it happened, more in Muggleborn homes. The fact that it was Harry Potter would ensure the case went through, especially since the family involved were muggles. It was unthinkable to most Purebloods to ever consider doing real, permanent harm to their heirs, the few times there was what could be classified as abuse it was almost always done magically, not by hand. She knew they would eagerly believe muggles were doing it all the time. This could cause a backlash against muggles which would be bad but the case had to go ahead to ensure Potter never ended up back here again. She went back downstairs to find Celia keeping watch over the unconscious and restrained Aunt. She looked to the Auror who shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>“She was resisting Ma’am,” Celia Proudfoot informed her boss with a straight face.</p><p> </p><p>“Put her in a cell and then come back. Arrest the Uncle when he shows up.”</p><p> </p><p>“What about the son?”</p><p> </p><p>“Take him for now until we can find next of kin to put him with,” Amelia ordered, and Celia nodded before portkeying out with the prisoner.</p><p> </p><p>Once sure the team had everything under control she left the house and apparated home, walking swiftly upstairs to the guestroom the portkey should have delivered her new houseguest to. Sure enough, she found Harry fast asleep beneath the quilt with Maggie Jones sitting beside the bed to keep watch over him. “How is she?” Amelia whispered, and Maggie smiled tiredly.</p><p> </p><p>“No need to whisper Madam Bones, I gave him some Dreamless Sleep. I’ve healed everything and made a complete record. Did you know he hasn’t had any immunisations since that October?”</p><p> </p><p>“How bad was it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Several broken bones that hadn’t healed properly, borderline malnutrition. Old scars that match the new wounds. The main problem was the wounds on his back, they had become infected and so weren’t healing. With a few weeks of using scar reducing cream I hope there will be only very feint scars left. My question is how did Pomphrey miss this?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know but you can be sure I will be asking her at some point.” Amelia sank tiredly into the chair on the other side of the bed and then removed Harry’s possessions from her cloak and placed them on the bedside cabinet.</p><p> </p><p>“What will you tell Susan? You can’t keep him locked away in here for the whole summer.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know, I doubt he’ll want anyone to know what happened, but the case will make that impossible. I will make sure she knows to tell no one he is here.” Amelia stayed for a while before leaving to go to work, she had been gone far longer than originally scheduled after all. Just after six Celia showed up to let her know that both Dursley’s were now in custody with their son being sent off to a paternal Aunt. So far, they had been lucky and neither the Minister or Dumbledore had caught wind of what was happening. The Headmaster had always kept very firm control over anything to do with the name Potter since James and Lily died and she didn’t want him interfering before the family could be brought to trial.</p><p> </p><p>An hour later she got to go home, and she still hadn’t figured out what to say to her niece. Not feeling like apparating she Floo’d home and then stopped to stare at the sight of Susan sitting and feeding Hedwig owl treats.</p><p> </p><p>“Why is Harry Potter’s owl here Auntie?” Susan asked as soon as her Aunt had vanished the soot from her robes.</p><p> </p><p>Amelia sighed at the question, so much for having time to ease into things. “Mr Potter will be staying with us for the foreseeable future Susan. You cannot tell anyone he is here, understood?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes Auntie,” Susan agreed, looking very curious, but she went back to Hedwig who lapped up the attention and food. Amelia smiled tiredly and headed to her room to change into more casual clothes. She may be a pureblood but there was one aspect of muggle life she eagerly embraced, their clothes. Robes were fine for formal events, school and work but at home nothing beat muggle clothes for comfort and variety. She had even taken to wearing muggle slacks and a shirt under her robes when there was any possibility she would be needed in the field as they were better for moving around in. Once changed she slipped into the guestroom to check up on the still sleeping Harry, Maggie having gone home for the night. He had been given enough potion to make him sleep until the morning, so nothing had changed since the last time she had seen him. She left him to his sleep and went downstairs to join Susan for dinner.</p><p> </p><p>`````````````````````````````````````</p><p>Harry woke slowly, feeling like he was lying on a soft cloud while being toasty warm; he didn’t really want to wake up, but his back had stopped burning in pain which was odd. He stretched and frowned, since when was his bed so big? He forced his eyes open and blearily looked around before spotting his glasses. He grabbed them and slipped them on to look around properly. He was in a large bedroom decorated in calm blues and creams. The bed was even bigger than the one in Gryffindor Tower but was the same style. He had the feeling he was back in the Wizarding World but why and how? He tried to remember what had happened after he’d been locked in his room, but it was all fuzzy.</p><p> </p><p>“Good morning Mr Potter.”</p><p> </p><p>His gaze darted over to the door to find a tall woman standing there, a monocle over one eye. Her stern look reminded him a bit of Professor McGonagall.</p><p> </p><p>“Who…where…” He was confused and yes, a little scared, to find himself in strange surroundings.</p><p> </p><p>“Relax Mr Potter, you are safe here. I turned up yesterday for our meeting to find you in rather shaky health.” The woman smiled, and it really softened her and removed the resemblance to his Head of House.</p><p> </p><p>Harry frowned in confusion and then remembered who he had a meeting with. “Madam Bones?”</p><p> </p><p>She nodded. “You will be staying with me and my niece, Susan, for the rest of the summer. All of your things are in the closet over there or the desk under the window, though your wand is beside the bed.”</p><p> </p><p>“My Aunt and Uncle agreed to that?” He asked in shock as he spotted his books on the desk.</p><p> </p><p>“No…Harry, they are currently in Ministry holding cells. Your cousin has been sent to his Aunt.”</p><p> </p><p>“What! Why?” Harry stared at her with wide eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve seen the house Harry,” she answered gently, moving further into the room. “When I arrived, your Aunt denied you lived there and tried to keep me out. As an officer of the law I insisted on entering. As I didn’t know where in the house you were, I used a spell to find out track your magical signature, do you know what areas lit up?” Amelia asked and watched as he flushed in shame. “Your family is being held on various charges and I hope to have the case seen to before you return to Hogwarts.” She sat on the edge of the bed and studied him seriously. “Why have you never told anyone?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry stared at the quilt. “I did, there was this teacher…she promised I wouldn’t have to go back but then she was gone, and no one would listen. I tried to tell Professor Dumbledore I didn’t want to go back but he said I had to.”</p><p> </p><p>That was more than a little suspicious. “Well I will not be leaving, and I am listening Harry. Now it’s almost time for breakfast so I suggest you have a shower and get dressed, bathroom is through the door closest to the window, the other is your wardrobe.” With that she left the room, so he could wash up, knowing he would need some time to process what she had told him. She swore she would get to the bottom of what was going on when it came to Harry. She would not let him slip through the cracks as the rest of the government apparently had in the mess after Voldemort’s defeat. She smiled as she found Susan already at the table. “Good morning Susan.”</p><p> </p><p>“Morning Auntie, is Harry joining us?”</p><p> </p><p>“He’s just getting ready. Remember, keep the questions under control,” she warned and then fell silent as the kitchen door opened to reveal a nervous Harry Potter.</p><p> </p><p>
