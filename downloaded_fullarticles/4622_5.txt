    <p>There's little difference between the orphanage and the wilds. They're still battling each other for resources. They're still battling each other to survive.</p><p>Tattling is the norm. Stealing and cowering their fellow orphans is the norm. Anything to get a little more to eat, or a little more time in the bath, or the slightly newer clothes or slightly more comfortable bed. Anything to get first dibs at the chores. Anything to get first dibs at the jobs once they're old enough to work.</p><p>He learns. Quickly, too quickly, he learns. And he learns he has an edge they don't.</p><p>In the orphanage - in the wild - they use every edge they can get their hands on. Because the only ones they can trust to give them the best are themselves. Because no-one loves them enough to just give. They have to earn it. They have to take it. They have to fight like their life's a battlefield…</p><p>And they say that the ones who don't grow up on love will never understand.</p><p>Someone who doesn't take advantage of everything around them can't push past the crowd and stand on top.</p><p>And at the top, he can safely keep on living.</p><p> </p>
