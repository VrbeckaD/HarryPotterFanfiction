  <strong>31 July, 1995</strong>
</p><p>It had rained. Hard. And Minerva had spent the last hour in the rain. She'd been on stakeout in London when a squall grew suddenly in the sky. She had been in her animagus form so she'd sought cover under a small box until a shop owner had shooed her off. Minerva had next hid under a dumpster in an alley and had carefully followed her mark from the small bistro until he entered the Leaky Cauldron.</p><p>She couldn't follow him there without being followed. They had eyes in the Leaky Cauldron so Minerva knew he was being watched. She had a meeting with the Board of Governor's in the morning and her paws were getting cold so she decided to call it a day. With a small pop she disappeared from the wet street and reappeared in front of 12 Grimmauld Place.</p><p>Minerva walked up the stairs and knocked. She disliked that she couldn't open the door on her own. She knew it was a safety precaution, but it left her feeling like she had a distinct lack of privacy. As an incredibly private person, she was grateful that Grimmauld place was at least large enough to afford her her own private rooms. But it was hard to stay hidden in the house. Sirius Black was desperate for company and felt trapped. The entire Weasley clan had moved in. And between all the various Order members that were using it as a safe house, it had become crowded.</p><p>Minerva had volunteered to set up a sleeping chart to assign rooms and create some order. She'd volunteered so she could ensure she and Severus had rooms next to one another. It would make it easier to slip in and out of one another's rooms. His room had it's own bath so she was more than happy to take advantage of using the large, claw foot bath in it. But before she could relax, she would need to get in to the house.</p><p>Minerva hesitated to knock again lest she awaken Mrs Black. There was certainly no love lost between Minerva McGonagall and Walburga Black. They'd had a complicated history that had been exasperated by Sirius and Regulus Black.</p><p>But as the wind swept down the street and Minerva felt the chill she decided it was worth knocking again. She raised her hand and was about to rap again when the door swung up to reveal Remus Lupin.</p><p>"Remus," Minerva smiled politely.</p><p>"How many house points did you take after you caught us hosting an illegal speakeasy?" Remus asked as he pointed his wand at her.</p><p>"One hundred points a piece," Minerva replied. "What was your punishment?"</p><p>"A month of detention working in the kitchens without magic," Remus replied.</p><p>He opened the door and offered to take her coat.</p><p>"Come in, you look soaked," he said as he cast a quick drying charm on her muggle coat.</p><p>"Thank you," she replied as she removed her shoes. "I'm going to head upstairs and get dry."</p><p>"Yes," Lupin said as he watched her standing there, dripping all over the floor and looking uncharacteristically disheveled.</p><p>"Dinner is at six," he said as she made her way up the stairs.</p><p>She crept by the portrait of Mrs Black and quickly collected a dressing gown and a change of clothes from her rooms. Opening the door to her rooms she glanced up and down the hallway to ensure she was alone. She quickly and quietly made her way to Severus's door and let herself in. She softly closed the door behind her and breathed a sign of relief.</p><p>She found herself face to face with Sirius Black.</p><p>"What are you doing here?" She demanded.</p><p>"I live here," he said flatly. He eyed the dressing gown and change of clothes and added, "What are you doing here?"</p><p>"Why are you in Severus's room?" Minerva said determined to deter Sirius from snooping again.</p><p>"I'm wondering the same thing, Professor," he added with a grin.</p><p>"I was looking for the bath to freshen up before dinner," Minerva said in matter-of-fact voice.</p><p>"In Severus's rooms?" Sirius asked her.</p><p>"I got lost," Minerva replied, refusing to give Sirius any kind of leverage.</p><p>"Then how did you know this was his room?" Sirius said with a growing smile.</p><p>"I realised as soon as I saw this wasn't the bath and saw you instead," Minerva snapped. "Who else's room would you be snooping through?"</p><p>For a moment she feared he wasn't going to buy it. But after a tense few seconds he shrugged and smiled.</p><p>"Well you've caught me," Sirius said as he ruffled his hair.</p><p>"Get out of his room," Minerva said with a forceful look.</p><p>"After you," Sirius smiled as he gestured to the door.</p><p>Realizing there was no way she could stay, she left the room and headed down the corridor toward the bath. She made her way slowly and shut the door behind her. She waited a moment before peering out into the hallway to see if was abandoned. Sirius wasn't present so she collected her things and began to make her way back to Severus's room.</p><p>She was about halfway down the hall when a voice caused her to jump.</p><p>"Forget something?" Sirius called out as he emerged from the darkness. He must have come back down the stairway that led to the next floor. He was grinning like he'd caught a naughty child.</p><p>"Yes," Minerva replied coolly. She made her way past him and into her own bedchamber. Growing impatient, she did not check before entering the corridor.</p><p>"Did you get everything you needed?" Sirius Black said. He was leaning against the wall in the corridor.</p><p>"Don't you have something better to be doing?" Minerva asked curtly.</p><p>"Not really," Sirius replied. His grin stopped when he saw her look.</p><p>"I'm sorry Professor," he said earnestly. "I'll make myself scarce."</p><p>True to his word, he scurried off downstairs and left her alone in the dark, musty corridor.</p><p>Now that someone knew she was supposed to be occupying the bath, she locked her own door and the door on the bath down the corridor in case Sirius Black decided to go snooping again. Her arrangement with Severus had be kept hidden from everyone. They couldn't risk anyone, even the Order, finding out. Minerva hesitated to call it a relationship. She knew it was foolish to think there could be any sort of normalcy.</p><p>Minerva wasted no time in pouring a hot bath. Her back ached and she was chilled. The hot water was both warming and soothing. Steam had fogged the mirror and filled the air of the small space. Minerva inhaled it in deeply and her sinuses thanked her.</p><p>She pulled her feet out and rested them on the edge as she slid further into the water, stopping when it hit her chin. She did not want to tell Severus about Sirius being in his rooms. She knew it would cause an unnecessary argument. But she was very upset that Sirius had been in Severus's rooms. It wasn't just the fear of discovery. Sirius didn't trust Severus and that kind of distrust wasn't healthy for the Order.</p><p>She rested her head back against the cool tub as she contemplated how she would handle the encounter with Sirius. He did technically own the house and there was little that Minerva could do to stop him while maintaining secrecy from both Severus and the others. She considered discussing the situation with Remus. He was close with Sirius and he would understand the situation. Minerva sensed he suspected that there was something going on between her and Severus. But Minerva wasn't concerned. Remus had never asked and Minerva knew he wouldn't ask. It was safer for all of them that way and Remus understood that.</p><p>Minerva sat up in the tub. She reached up removed her hairpins. She could only image how much of a mess her hair must be. Rubbing her temples, she sunk back into the water. After a moment leaned back and submerged herself in the warmth of the bath. The sound of the bubbles as she exhaled underwater set her at ease.</p><p>After she reemerged, she wiped her eyes with a wet hand and leaned back to soak. But her peace was short lived.</p><p>The door to Severus's room closed. She hadn't locked the door and someone was now in the room.</p><p>She tried to calm herself down. There is a chance it was Severus. But there was an equal chance it was Sirius Black.</p><p>Minerva stopped moving and tried to make as little noise as possible. Her wand was on the counter. She knew the moment she got out of the water the sound would alert the person in the room. She couldn't reach her wand without making noise. She looked at the antique brass knob on the door. She didn't think she could risk wandlessly locking the door as the click of the latch would be heard.</p><p>The moments dragged on. For Minerva, it felt like forever. But she realised it must have only been minutes as the water was still quite hot. She hadn't moved. She could still hear someone rummaging through the other room. Drawers were opened and closed, the door to the large wardrobe had creaked open slowly, and footsteps had shuffled across the floor. Minerva had no doubt this was Sirius Black.</p><p>Just when her fear of discovery had reached a fever pitch, Minerva heard the door to the room open and and close. The footsteps had stopped. The sound of rummaging was no more. Minerva breathed an audible sigh of relief and shifted in the bath. A second later, Minerva heard someone approach the door.</p><p>She froze. Her eyes grew wide as the door to the bath opened slowly. Minerva retreated into the water with just her eyes visible.</p><p>Severus Snape poked his head around the door.</p><p>"You're back early," Minerva said as she pulled her face out of the water.</p><p>"I've been reassigned," Severus said with no emotion. "I've just come to pack."</p><p>"Where are you going?" Minerva asked as she sat up in the water.</p><p>Minerva had just gotten back from Crimea. She chastised herself for being foolish enough to think her and Severus would have time to spend together.</p><p>"Falmouth," he replied shortly as he stuffed his toothbrush into a small sack.</p><p>"LaTour," she said in a far away voice as she pulled her hand from the water and let it rest along the edge of the bath.</p><p>Severus didn't respond. He stuffed his essentials into an overnight pack and shrunk it down to fit in his pocket. He owned very little as he was used to packing light. It had shocked Minerva how sparse his personal quarters had been when she'd first laid eyes on them.</p><p>She didn't ask when he would be back. They both knew there was a possibility that each time they parted it would be the last.</p><p>"Don't ask it," he said as he had read her thoughts.</p><p>"I wasn't going to," she replied.</p><p>They were silent for a moment until Minerva spoke up.</p><p>"When do you leave?" Minerva asked as stood and stepped out of the bath.</p><p>"After dinner," Severus said as he turned and handed her dressing gown to her.</p><p>Minerva followed Severus out of the bath as she tied the knot of her dressing gown firmly around her waist. She swept her hair to one side and began to braid it, frustrated as she would have to wait to wash it.</p><p>"The Cannons traded Brenshaw," Minerva said trying to find a topic they could discuss that didn't involved the Order.</p><p>"Really?" Severus commented as he inspected his cloak. "To the Arrows?"</p><p>"No," Minerva replied. "Portee. They gave 'em Milkthatch."</p><p>"Pity for Milkthatch," Severus said as he used his wand to carefully remove lint from his cloak.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>Dinner was a frustrating affair. Severus found himself longing for Hogwarts where he could dine alone in his own private quarters.</p><p>At one end of the table the Weasley children and Miss Granger were laughing uproariously at the antics of the youngest Black - Nymphadora Tonks. The insufferable Weasley twins were deep in conversation with Sirius Black. Arthur Weasley, Remus Lupin, and Sturgis Podmore were chatting about developments at the Ministry.</p><p>Dumbledore had always encouraged a 'family' atmosphere within the Order. Severus thought this was foolish.</p><p>Across the table, Molly Weasley and Emmeline Vance were discussing the latest installment of Heloise Greenbaum's The Witch is In the Kitch, a popular cooking program broadcast on the Wizarding Wireless Network. Molly's boisterous voice carried through the room. It made Severus uncomfortable. In contrast to this large, loud dinner his own childhood had been filled with cold, silent dinners. As a boy, he and his mother would sit quietly and try not to make any noises during dinner that would upset his father. He was terrified of making a noise.</p><p>Unlike Molly Weasley, his own mother had been weak. Each morning after his father's drunken beatings, his mother would never acknowledge it. She'd say he was ill or nervous about school. And when he was young - before he understood his magical abilities - he would sometimes have moments of uncontrolled magic. A glass would break or a door would shut suddenly without explanation. His father would always blame Severus and his mother would beg him to 'spare the boy.'</p><p>He had wondered what it would have been like to have a mother like Molly Weasley instead of his own chilly mother. The powerful memory of Alastor Moody interrogating him after he'd turned himself in hit him with such force that he began to sweat.</p><p><em>Mummy didn't love you enough?</em> Moody had asked during Severus's interrogation fifteen years earlier.</p><p>Sirius Black slammed his fist on the table in laughter. The sound brought Severus back to the table and out of his thoughts.</p><p><em>Alright?</em> He heard Minerva's voice say in his head as they made eye contact. He gave her small nod and she replied with a hint of a smile before turning back to her conversation with Kingsley Shacklebolt.</p><p>Severus ate the remainder of his chicken Balti curry quickly and excused himself from the table.</p><p>After leaving the table, Severus strode upstairs silently and into his room. Grabbing his finest cloak he swung it over his shoulder and took in his appearance in the mirror in the corner. The cloak was a fine quality and had been one of the first things he'd purchased upon leaving Hogwarts. In his youth, in an effort to blend in with the posh LaTour and always impeccably dressed Lucius Malfoy, Severus had spent a gorgeous galleon (and more) to purchase the cloak. It was handmade by Master Ambrus Koszorus, the famed Hungarian designer that had outfitted the ranks of the wizarding pureblood high society.</p><p>Severus adjusted his collar and ran his hand through his hair before stepping out into the hallway and slipped out of the house like a shadow and into the dark of night sky.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>
  <strong>1 August, 1995</strong>
</p><p>Minerva hated every minute of the Board of Governors meeting that she'd attended that morning. The meeting had been held at the Ministry - which was unheard of - and was led by the Ministry rather than the President of the Board.</p><p>A frustrated Minerva had sat impatiently listening to the Senior Undersecretary to the Minister prattle on about the need for reform at Hogwarts. A student had died and a dangerous intruder had penetrated the school's defenses.</p><p>Minerva felt helpless.</p><p>The Ministry would be appointing a liaison to the school to evaluate and implement necessary changes to the school's operations.</p><p>Minerva had regretted asking who would fill the role of Ministry liaison.</p><p>"By order of the Minister I will serve as liaison and fill the Defense Against the Dark Arts post," the Undersecretary had said with her sickeningly sweet grin.</p><p>Minerva was disgusted by both the idea that this woman would be joining the Hogwarts staff and also by the time she had now wasted in filling the post. Because of her trip to Crimea, Minerva had scrambled during the start of the summer holidays to find a suitable professor to fill the vacant post. After countless interviews and negotiations, Minerva had secured Professor Yseult Hawthorne on one-year contract from the prestigious Salem Witches' Institute.</p><p>"And what of Professor Hawthorne?" Minerva had asked with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>"You'll need to inform her that her services are no longer required," the Undersecretary had replied.</p><p>"Are you an employee of the Ministry then ma'am, or of Hogwarts?" Minerva had questioned.</p><p>"I don't understand why that matters?" Undersecretary Umbridge said as her smile had begun to falter.</p><p>"Are you paid by Hogwarts or the Ministry?" Minerva had asked plainly. She was responsible for signing off all payroll and would need to be in the know if she was paid by Hogwarts.</p><p>"The Board of Governors has already worked out a substantial rate that is suitable for someone of my rank," the Undersecretary had informed her with sickening gleam in her eye.</p><p>Yes, Minerva had hated every minute of that meeting and she was not looking forward to the start of the term. In particular, Minerva had been taken aback by the Undersecretary's comments after the meeting.</p><p>"Minerva dear," she had said grabbing Minerva's arm with her chubby ring-covered little fingers. "Your house has long had a problem with discipline. I intend to change that and I hope you'll take note."</p><p>Minerva had been flabbergasted. Her reputation as a strict but fair disciplinary was well known.</p><p>"Hopefully Professor Umbridge will be able to teach young Mr Potter to stay in line," Lucius Malfoy had sneered as he walked past the women.</p><p>"Oh I'm not concerned about Mr Potter," the Undersecretary had said menacingly. "I know how to handle children like him."</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>For his part, Severus hated his trip to Falmouth. In many ways, it seemed to be nothing more than a trip to relive the glory days of the past by fraternal brothers.</p><p>Upon arrival, Severus had given his cloak to a young house elf who had bowed so deeply he'd nearly fallen over. A second house elf had ushered Severus into LaTour's retiring room where cigar smoke and laughter filled the room.</p><p>Severus was presently seated across from none other than Horace Slughorn. LaTour had invited the aged former Professor to spend the summer as his guest and Slughorn was never one to turn down a party. He was currently regaling the group with his recent trip to the continent.</p><p>It struck Severus as odd that all of these adults would hang on every one of Slughorn's boring words as if they were still children vying for top preference in the Slug Club.</p><p>"Get a good night's rest lads," Slughorn said in a tipsy voice as he stood.</p><p>"Indeed, old boy," LaTour said raising his glass with his signature toothy sinister grin and creole drawl.</p><p>As soon as Slughorn had left the room, LaTour turned to Severus.</p><p>"Severus, please escort our most honored guest to his room," LaTour said.</p><p>Severus nodded and left with a bow to follow Slughorn into the corridor. He knew it was a punishment. Severus wasn't readily accepted back in yet. He'd not met the Dark Lord yet since his return. They were testing him and he would have to work to rebuild that trust.</p><p>Slughorn was an old drunk and Severus had always found the man to be dull. But he knew he needed to follow LaTour's instructions if he had any hope of regaining his position within the ranks of the Death Eaters.</p><p>"Here we are," Slughorn said as he stumbled into a dark room. Severus waved his hand to light to elaborate candelabras that decorated the chamber. Slughorn had indeed made himself at home. His treasured pictures and postcards lined the shelves, table, and any surface available.</p><p>"Steady now," Slughorn slurred as he swayed into a small table and knocking the photos askew.</p><p>The old man dropped to his knees and began to pick up the photos tenderly.</p><p>"Oh Gwenog Jones," Slughorn said brushing the frame. "She's got me tickets to the match against the Tornadoes in September."</p><p>Severus took the framed photo from Slughorn and set it back on the table. One by one Slughorn would pick up the photo and carefully inspect it for any damage and comment on the photo's namesake before handing it off to Severus. But Severus was rapidly becoming bored of this pace. At this rate it would likely take all night.</p><p>Probably what LaTour's counting on. Severus snickered grimly to himself.</p><p>"Ouch," Slughorn snapped as he pulled his cut finger from a photograph where the glass had broken in the frame. "Careful with that, my boy." He said as he handed it to Severus and stuck his bleeding finger in his mouth.</p><p>Severus waved his wand and a small waste bin flew over from the ornate desk that sat in the corner. With a second wave the glass shards on the floor lifted themselves into the air before swirling gently into the bin. Severus gently removed the photograph from the frame and was surprised to see a second photograph behind it.</p><p>Severus set the photo that had been on top down on the table and curiously picked up the photo it had been hiding.</p><p>He recognisedthe young man in the photograph. Severus had seen him before. It was a picture of a young Tom Marvolo Riddle before his transformation into the Dark Lord Voldemort. Young Mr Riddle was standing on a beach in the wind with a young woman. Severus flipped over the photograph to see a note that read "Cheers from Bregu."</p><p>Slughorn was pissed. He wouldn't remember it in the morning. Severus carefully replaced the original photograph and did his best to repair the broken glass. He pocketed the photograph of Tom Riddle. With a flick of his wand the shards he had previously discarded delicately swirled out of the bin and worked themselves back into the frame. Severus checked his work by running his hand over the glass. To his delight, he found it was flawless.</p><p>It occurred to Severus in this moment that Slughorn might be exactly what he needed to find out more information about Minerva. She had been a member of the Slug Club and Slughorn had worked with her for some time. Severus thanked his lucky stars LaTour had assigned him this meaningless task.</p><p>"Do you have any photographs of the old Slug Club?" Severus asked as he helped Slughorn to his feet.</p><p>Slughorn beamed as if he'd waited a lifetime for someone to ask. Shuffling over to his nightstand, Slughorn opened the drawer slowly and pulled out a large, leather-bound book and held it out for Severus to take.</p><p>"You'll find you and your classmates toward the end, my dear boy," Slughorn smiled as he patted the top of the book.</p><p>"Bring her back in the morning!" Slughorn added with one of his characteristic winks as Severus bid him goodnight.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>Walking silently down the corridor, Severus swept past the retiring room. Clinging to the shadow of a large statue, Severus avoided the laughter that had erupted from the men in LaTour's company.</p><p>When he reached his own private guest chamber, Severus lit a candle and opened the book Slughorn had loaned him.</p><p>It was a scrapbook of sorts, collecting photographs and mementos from his Slug Club throughout the years. Severus flipped through and found his own first year as a member of the prestigious Slug Club. He had been a fourth year when he'd finally earned an invitation. His fingers traced across the group photograph. He and Lily had still been quite close then.</p><p>Flipping back through the years, Severus noted many of the famous - and infamous - members of the Slug Club.</p><p>Thinking back, Severus recalled Minerva had taken her N.E.W.T.s in 1943. Turning toward the earlier portion of the book he started looking at 1936-1937 Slug Club photographs. If he'd done his maths properly that would have been her first year at Hogwarts. And to his delight, there she was.</p><p>Turning the pages he noted the members of Slughorn's club at the time were a notable who's who of high society - Niall Nott, Abraxas Malfoy, Corban Yaxley, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Roman Lestrange, Antonin Dolohov, Orion Black, Rufus Scrimgeour, Barty Crouch Senior, Augusta Longbottom, Amelia Bones, and Minerva McGonagall.</p><p>He was looking for any kind of clue as to who she had been in her youth. She was tall as a child, much taller than her classmates until puberty had hit and some had caught up with her.</p><p>As he flipped to the next page he was struck to see a young Tom Riddle in the 1940-1941 Slug Club group photograph. There the Dark Lord was as a small boy not more than thirteen or fourteen. And yet there he sat sandwiched between Abraxas Malfoy and Corban Yaxley. Severus pondered for a moment if they knew then what he would become.</p><p>There was a photograph of a fifteen year old Minerva attending a Slug Club Christmas party on the arm of a young Rufus Scrimgeour. They didn't seem particularly attached to one another in the photograph and Severus got the impression they must have gone together out of a sense of duty to bring a date rather than some mutual attraction.</p><p>But on the next page he noticed something that caught his eye. In that year's photograph for the Slug Club members, Minerva was standing next to Tom Riddle in the back row. A second photograph of the group at a Slug Club meeting showed the two were seated next to one another. And in the annual Christmas photo a young Minerva McGonagall was toasting the holiday with Tom Riddle, Corban Yaxley, and Roman Lestrange.</p><p>This book had raised more questions than answers. He wondered if Minerva had once held the same blood purity beliefs that she now fought against. He also considered the possibility that she still did hold those beliefs but, like him, was indebted to Dumbledore over some personal matter. He dashed that thought as quickly as it had come. Minerva was quite political and Severus knew that well - and the scars he'd seen led him to believe otherwise.</p><p>On the next page, Severus lamented that it was her final year. These would be the last photographic clues Severus would get from this book.</p><p>In the last Slug Club annual photo she had been a part of, Minerva had sat on the great cushioned sofa in Slughorn's quarters. Next to her was Tom Marvolo Riddle. And to Severus's surprise, in a photograph of the 1943 Slug Club Christmas Party, was a seventeen year old Minerva McGonagall with the arm of none other than Tom Riddle around her waist.</p><p>He pulled the picture he'd snagged from Slughorn out of his pocket and compared the two. It was her. There was no doubt about it.</p><p>Severus shut the book and chastised himself for snooping. It seemed that in each step he took to learn more about Minerva's past, he wound up with more questions than when he had started. Minerva had insisted she wasn't a Death Eater. Severus knew there had been a gang of followers before the official start of the Death Eaters. And these photographs were certainly proof that she had known the lot of them. Severus knew the likes of Nott, Yaxley, Malfoy, and Lestrange had been among the earliest followers.</p><p>But Minerva? Severus contemplated as his hand rested on the front of the leather book. He theorized that perhaps the strange placement or color of her Dark Mark were related to this earlier group. But the Death Eaters Severus knew to have been in that group all had their mark on their wrists. A thought crossed his mind that perhaps it was gender related. There had been very few female Death Eaters in the beginning, as gender-related restrictions of pureblood society meant most women were excluded from their husbands' affairs. However, Severus knew that Seraphina Malfoy and Marin Killoran had been there since the start. Severus had never laid eyes on their Dark Marks so he knew not where they lay.</p><p>Severus set the book on his nightstand and turned over, extinguishing the candlelight with a quick flick of his wrist. His fingers brushed along the mark on his wrist and he wondered how long he'd have to remain until he could return to his slice of solitude at Hogwarts.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>300 miles away, Minerva was trying her best to keep her temper under check. A few hours earlier she'd been helping Molly clear out one of the bedrooms when an urgent patronus from Arthur Weasley arrived.</p><p>Potter had been expelled from Hogwarts for use of a patronus charm.</p><p>Minerva had been present at the Ministry with Dumbledore trying to sort out the Potter incident. Now she sat angrily overthinking the events that had transpired.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>
  <strong>Several Hours Earlier - Ministry of Magic</strong>
</p><p>Minerva sat impatiently inside Mafalda Hopkirk's office. A young wizard had escorted her in and assured her Ms Hopkirk would be along shortly.</p><p>Upon hearing Arthur Weasley's patronus, Minerva had raced out of Grimmauld Place and apparated directly outside the Ministry, hurried in, and demanded an audience with Hopkirk who oversaw the Improper Use of Magic Office at the Ministry.</p><p>Minerva had been waiting a full eight minutes when the same young wizard escorted Albus Dumbledore into the office.</p><p>Dumbledore took a seat next to Minerva and they sat in silence waiting. Minerva was rapping her nails along the armrest of the chair and Dumbledore was fidgeting in his seat.</p><p>"Crimea was nice?" Dumbledore said awkwardly breaking the silence.</p><p>"Very," Minerva replied without looking at him. "And Calais?"</p><p>"Hot," he replied.</p><p>They both knew that it was likely they were being observed and that this was not a safe area in which to discuss the Potter situation.</p><p>A moment later a flustered looking Mafalda Hopkirk entered her office and sat behind the desk with a nervous smile.</p><p>"Good evening Professors," she smiled weakly. "To what do I owe the pleasure?"</p><p>"You know why we're here," Minerva said simply. "Let's cut to the chase, shall we?"</p><p>Miss Hopkirk's face blanched.</p><p>"I think what my colleague means is, we are here in regards to an expulsion letter you sent to Mr Harry Potter," Dumbledore said sweetly.</p><p>Miss Hopkirk struggled to come up with the words to respond. She shuffled some papers on her desk and opened a drawer, all the while avoiding eye contact.</p><p>"I, um, well," she stuttered. "I do recall, um, seeing that."</p><p>"Out with it Miss Hopkirk," Minerva said bluntly. "Confrontation was never your strong suit."</p><p>"Maybe we could start at the beginning," Dumbledore offered calmly.</p><p>Mafalda Hopkirk had broken easily enough. It was apparent she had been under pressure to expel Potter from elsewhere within the Ministry. Miss Hopkirk had been scant on details but Dumbledore and Minerva had left her office twenty minutes later after having secured a hearing for Potter.</p><p>Minerva had hoped to speak with Dumbledore before he departed, but he'd left as quickly as he'd come muttering only that he'd see her tomorrow to plan for getting Potter to the hearing.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>
  <strong>Present</strong>
</p><p>There had been no doubt about the Dementors in Little Whinging. Minerva rung her hands as she paced back and forth across the floorboards in a small foyer on the first floor of Grimmauld Place. She had desperately wanted to extract Potter immediately, but she understood there were reasons Dumbledore wanted him to stay at his Aunt's home.</p><p>Padding up the stairs, Minerva crept past the ajar door that led to a room where Remus Lupin was attempting to calm down Sirius Black. He'd been in a foul mood since Arthur's patronus.</p><p>Minerva was beginning to feel that she understood what Sirius had meant when he'd described this house as 'suffocating.'</p><p>Suffocating indeed she thought as she found herself out of corridor. She longed for her own personal space back at Hogwarts where she could hide away in the Library or in her favorite tower. She wanted a cigarette and she wanted solitude.</p><p>Minerva turned and decided to head upstairs and see if she could find someplace to be alone. Creeping past the second and third upper floors, Minerva reached the fourth floor. It was dark and silent. Minerva knew most of the children's rooms were on the floor below and she didn't recall placing any rooms up here. At the end of the dark corridor, Minerva could see a sliver of moonlight creeping through an open window.</p><p>Minerva drew her wand and approached the open window carefully. It was a nearly full-length window and outside the roof was flat. There was a small faux railing and it overlooked the housing blocks of Islington.</p><p>Minerva looked carefully out of the window and didn't see anyone or anything. Carefully she stepped through the window and out onto the roof. The humid August felt refreshing compared to stifling, dusty air of Grimmauld Place.</p><p>Reaching into her robes, Minerva retrieved a muggle cigarette and lit it with a snap of her fingers. Drawing it to her lips, the end glowed a bright orange-red in contrast to the dark sky.</p><p>"Hot night," a voice said from behind her.</p><p>Minerva spun quickly to see Arthur Weasley leaning up against the bricks of the house. He was shadowed in the corner.</p><p>"Arthur," Minerva said as she steadied her breathing.</p><p>"Didn't mean to give you a start," he said sincerely.</p><p>"What are you doing out here?" Minerva asked.</p><p>"For twenty seven years I've worked in this city," Arthur said. "This is the first time I've ever had to live in it. I don't like it. Not one bit."</p><p>Minerva smiled as she exhaled a long puff of smoke into the sky.</p><p>"I suppose this is quite a change from Devonshire," Minerva replied.</p><p>"Ah, yes," Arthur nodded in agreement. "But I suppose this is quite a change from Hogwarts as well."</p><p>Minerva nodded in agreement.</p><p>"At home I have my shed I can retreat to," Arthur explained. "And at night I can see the stars for miles."</p><p>Minerva laughed.</p><p>"I know what you mean," she said as she took another drag. "When I first moved to London from Caithness it was quite a change."</p><p>"I didn't know you'd lived in London," Arthur said brightly.</p><p>"A long time ago," Minerva said allowing herself to remember. "I was here during the smog in '52."</p><p>"I remember Dad telling us about that as kids," Arthur commented.</p><p>"I'm sorry to have disturbed your solitude," Minerva said as she took another drag on her cigarette. "I should leave you to it."</p><p>"Not at all," Arthur said. "I should get back inside and help Molly."</p><p>Minerva nodded and bid goodnight to the father of the Weasley clan. Minerva had always found Arthur easy to talk with. Despite his eagerness for understanding the muggle world, Arthur was level-headed and intuitive. Molly Weasley was a lucky woman to found such a loving, faithful, and stable husband. It was no small wonder they had a large, happy family.</p><p>Minerva had wanted a family at one point. She rarely allowed herself to dwell on thoughts of that period of her life.</p><p>No, Minerva knew she was never cut out for an army of small children. The life of a farmer's wife would never have suited her.</p><p>Minerva conjured a small ash tray and put out her cigarette. She'd leave it here for future use.</p><p>She had a nagging feeling she'd back sooner or later to this dingy rooftop.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>Once back inside, Minerva returned to her room. She changed into her dressing gown but paused to examine the Dark Mark above her left breast.</p><p>It had ached since that night at the end of June. There had been occasional flashes of pain but nothing compared to the pain she'd felt the night the Diggory boy was murdered. She'd discussed it with Severus a few times and he'd felt similar quick bursts of pain from time to time since that night.</p><p>She wasn't feeling sleepy so instead she decided to curl up with her latest side project. Minerva was hoping her notes on multi-form animagi would distract her from the painful twinge from the mark on her collarbone.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>300 miles southwest, Severus Snape had awoken to find a group of Death Eaters in his room at LaTour's Falmouth estate. He'd been asleep maybe an hour.</p><p>"Severus," he recognised LaTour's voice.</p><p>"Yes?" He replied annoyed.</p><p>"Don't speak," LaTour snapped.</p><p>"You took an oath to serve the Dark Lord," said a voice that sounded like Yaxley.</p><p>"You took a life in his name to seal the oath," LaTour continued, "and you betrayed him."</p><p>They were drawing closer with their wands drawn.</p><p>Severus tried to remain calm. This could very well be another test of his loyalty or it could be a legitimate punishment for his actions from the past.</p><p>"Will you serve him now?" Lucius Malfoy asked.</p><p>"I never stopped," Severus snapped defensively.</p><p>Two of them waited for Severus to dress and then led him out of his room. Severus was led through the corridor and down the grand staircase. Once they'd reached the main foyer, Severus was led outside and down a path. Severus realised he was being led to the water. LaTour's estate sat right on the coast of the channel. As he made his way down the path he noticed there was a large bonfire on the sandy beach below and about a dozen Death Eaters surrounding it.</p><p>Once he'd reached the beach Severus realised there was a hooded figure standing near the water.</p><p>"Why should the Dark Lord spare your life?" one of the hooded Death Eaters called out.</p><p>"Am I now permitted to speak?" Severus replied. It was a calculated risk. The Dark Lord had always valued Severus's candor and he hoped his comment would remind the group of that time.</p><p>"How do we know he won't betray us?" another asked as a murmur made its way around the circle.</p><p>"You forgot to take my wand and I haven't done anything to escape," Severus challenged as he turned and addressed the group.</p><p>"Always the snarky one," a raspy voice said from the water. The whispers of the Death Eaters stopped.</p><p>"Come here, Severus," the cloaked figure said.</p><p>Severus approached the figure on the beach.</p><p>"My Lord, is that you?" Severus asked as he made his way closer to the water.</p><p>"Do you serve your Lord now as you did when you made your oath?" the shrouded figure asked.</p><p>"I have never stopped," Severus replied.</p><p>"And are you repentant for the years in which you did not seek your Lord?" it asked.</p><p>"Yes," Severus said solemnly hoping that his answer would prove sufficient.</p><p>In an instant Severus felt his body overtaken with pain as the hooded figure cast the Cruciatus Curse at him. He wreathed in pain as he twisted around on the wet sand. He was unable to cry or scream and his lungs longed for air.</p><p>At the moment he felt he would lose consciousness, it stopped.</p><p>"Are you repentant for the years in which you did not seek your Lord?" the figure repeated.</p><p>"Yes, my Lord," Severus repeated realizing his error was in failing to add 'my Lord' to the end of his previous answer.</p><p>However, this was not the case. Severus's body was flung into the sky and before he could gain a sense of what was happening he was plunged into the cold darkness of the water of the channel. He reemerged briefly, only to be thrust underwater again. There was a force holding his body under the water that Severus was unable to fight.</p><p>But understanding how sensitive this meeting could be, Severus didn't fight it. He put all his faith in his understanding of how the Dark Lord operated and held off from reaching for his wand. As his lungs burned, he continued to refrain. Darkness began to overtake him as he felt water beginning to fill his lungs.</p><p>The next thing he knew Severus was coughing up water as he lay soaked on the beach below LaTour's estate.</p><p>The hooded figure that had tormented him stood looming over him.</p><p>"Are you repentant for the years in which you did not seek your Lord?" the figure repeated for the third time.</p><p>"Not nearly enough, my Lord," Severus answered as pushed himself up onto his elbows.</p><p>The figure removed his hood to reveal a figure that Severus hardly recognized. He was hairless with red eyes and skin that was unnaturally thin and white. The snakelike slits of nostrils were the only hint of a nose. It grinned manically.</p><p>"Welcome back my son," the Dark Lord said as he bent down to touch Severus's wrist.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>Minerva sat upright and grabbed her chest as her Dark Mark burned with pain. She had passed out reading her notes and had awoke from a horrible nightmare. She was soaked with sweat and panting as she tried to get a grip on her surroundings.</p><p>Grimmauld Place she reminded herself as her eyes adjusted to the darkness and she took in her dingy surroundings.</p><p>Minerva got of out her bed and lit the candles in her room to provide some light. Checking the clock, she realised it was nearly three in the morning.</p><p>She quietly opened the door to the corridor and made her way through the darkness to Severus's room. Without a sound she opened the door and cast a quick Lumos. As she waved her wand across the the bed she realised Severus had not returned yet.</p><p>She closed the door to his room and leaned against it. Closing her eyes she tried to catch her breath.</p><p>"Trouble sleeping?" Sirius Black asked emerging from the darkness with a bottle of beer and half an over-sized sandwich hanging from his mouth.</p><p> </p>
