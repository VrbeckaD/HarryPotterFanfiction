    <p>I don’t make a habit out of listening in on conversations.</p><p>The walls in this house are just so thin. People talk so <em>loud</em>. Sometimes I can’t help hearing things in these conditions.</p><p>I don’t know if mommy expects me to be asleep right now, but I’ll assume that she <em> doesn’t </em> know I can hear her. I’ve overheard her talk about me on the phone before, normal ‘my kid exists for me to talk about’ stuff. I would be confused, honestly, if she didn’t mention me at all considering who she’s talking to.</p><p>I haven’t seen my cousins in years even though they do call fairly often. With Uncle Kane calling so late it’s only natural that Sam and I would come up. Still, I know for a fact that this is a conversation I shouldn’t be listening to.</p><p>I mean, I turned the TV off and drifted into the hall to hear better the first time I heard my old name. I’ve been practically holding my breath, nervous that I’ll be caught eavesdropping if I make a single sound. It’s not like I’m trying to not listen, so anything I hear is kind of my fault at this point.</p><p>“I don’t know,” she says, now. “That’s so far. If they’d asked you to send Gray 3,000 miles away from home at that age, would you?”</p><p>I frown.</p><p>“You <em> ran away</em>, that’s different. There’s no reason to even think she’s like you and your kids.”</p><p>A pause.</p><p>“She’s not your neighbor’s niece! She’s—no, I’m not saying it would be a <em> bad </em> thing, but—” She makes a sound, and I mentally pair it with an eye roll. “She wouldn’t really have to <em> leave</em>, would she? Isn’t there a school here?”</p><p>She tuts.</p><p>“As if they’re any better there. If it matters so much to you, talk to that headmaster of yours.” The couch creaks, and she groans as she stands. I start to back toward my own room. “I’m sure he’d be able to find out if she’s on the list.”</p><p>A door opens, and I only manage to catch one more thing before it closes again.</p><p>“We’ll talk about it when we find out, alright?”</p><p>With another wall between me and her, I would have to stand next to her door to hear more. I’m not that brave, not at all, so I retreat back to my room.</p><p>That wasn’t ominous at all.</p><p>I close the door with a soft click. I stand in place for a few seconds to debate keeping the light on, and the desire for sleep ends up winning out against the half-hearted cleaning I was trying. I’ll get it clean this time. It’s just so late, even with tomorrow being Saturday and school almost being over. Summer’s taking too long to get here and the heat beat the end of school to Oregon once again.</p><p>I shuffle across the room, feeling around piles and avoiding breakable items by touch alone. When my toes find the edge of my camping mat, I drop to my knees and burrow under the thin sheet.</p><p>I’ll call Jess tomorrow and see if they know what Uncle Kane had to say and why it’s upsetting my mom so much.</p><p>It takes ages to fall asleep.</p><p>I try to stay put, because you can only fall asleep if you’re not moving, right? My arms, though, don’t like it. They don’t like it when I lay on my back with them at my side. They don’t like it when I face the wall and hug them. They don’t like it when I flop onto my stomach and throw them over my head to sprawl past my pillow.</p><p>Eventually, I whine and wrap my arms around the pillow itself and that seems to shut them up just fine.</p><p>Then my eyes decide they want to look up and make my head pound instead of relaxing and going to sleep with me. This, I don’t know how to fix. I’m still trying to puzzle it out when being awake stops being what I am.</p><p>And then the line between falling asleep and jolting upright only feels like a second.</p><p><em> Geez</em>.</p><p>My heart races, breath coming hard, and I don’t even know what I was dreaming about. I hold a hand to my chest and wait. Wait for everything to steady, for my head to stop spinning.</p><p>“<em>Jessica! </em>”</p><p>I shove the sheet into a bundle at the bottom of the bed and heave myself to my feet. Somehow, it’s harder to get to the door in this half-light than it was in the dark. I end up stumbling past the door instead of walking through it when I get it open.</p><p>“I expected more time, you ass—oh, I’ll call you back.”</p><p>Mommy sits with a notebook in front of her, the phone to her ear, and two plates full of hash on the table.</p><p>Already, this is weird because my mom barely ever cooks. When she does everyone is expected to get their own plates. The way she gestures to the chair closest to the second plate makes it clear it’s for me. It smells good, though, so I drop into the chair and reach for the ketchup.</p><p>“Good morning,” she says as she drops the phone back on the table. She doesn’t really look at me, too busy with the papers.</p><p>So I just echo it back at her and start eating.</p><p>“I talked to Kane last night. And this morning,” she starts again. She clears her throat and finally looks at me. “And he thinks it would be a good idea—I mean, if you <em> wanted </em>to, of course you always have a choice. And it wouldn’t be for another month at least, but—”</p><p>She stops. I busy myself with another mouthful of potatoes.</p><p>She takes a breath and runs a hand over the surface of her notebook. “Your uncle thinks you should come stay with him for a little bit.”   </p><p>Oh.</p><p>Uncle Kane takes kids in from all over the place. He comes to visit every once in a while. They all come to family reunions during the summer. Mommy used to say they were ‘problem children,’ but I’ve never seen any of them cause problems. Maybe I only think that because I’m like that, too. Like how the house apparently smells like cats and mildew, but I don’t smell that at all because I live here. Can someone that causes problems tell when someone else does it? Or is it like the smells?</p><p>“Jess?”</p><p>I drop my fork and look up, snapping back into the conversation.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Oh, Kane would—he’d explain it much better than I can.” She waves a hand back and forth, a dismissal. “You can think of it like a vacation. You’d get to see all of your cousins again while you’re there.”</p><p>“When would I come back?”</p><p>She freezes.</p><p>“Well.” She doesn’t follow that with anything, flipping to another page in the notebook. After a few seconds, she taps a line. “You would be going to school there, s-so, you could always come back during your breaks. And for summers! But—”</p><p>Her smile dissolves, and for a second I think she might cry. It only lasts for that second, though, and her eyes crinkle closed when she offers me a warm but wobbly smile.</p><p>“Things will be weird for a while, but Kane is much better equipped to help you through it than I am.”</p><p>I stare at my plate.</p><p>“Did I do something wrong?” I ask, voice small.</p><p>Her chair squeaks, and she’s at my side to wrap me in her arms in an instant.</p><p>“No, sweetie, you did <em> nothing </em> wrong.” Her words are hushed, thick. “You’ll see when you get there that you are so special and you can be with people who are special, too. I’m so sorry, I don’t know where I would even start explaining past that, but I am <em> so proud of you </em> already.”</p><p>I leave on July 1st.</p>
