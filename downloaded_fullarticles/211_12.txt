    <p>'<em>Not again.</em>'</p><p>Those were the first words Hadrian Lucifer (read Harry Potter) ever thought to himself in life number thirteen. He's in the arms of a red headed woman who drops him a wink.<br/>
Lillian: *in Harry's ear* Death thinks he's funny. Doesn't he?<br/>
Hadrian nods.<br/>
James: Right Lils I'm off to work.<br/>
Lillian: Bye James.<br/>
They kiss. Hadrian looks away.<br/>
James: Bye Prongslet.<br/>
He ruffles Hadrian's hair. Hadrian resists the temptation to roll his eyes. James disapperates. Hadrian changes eternal form.<br/>
Lillian: Well Lucifer it's been awhile.<br/>
Hadrian: Indeed it has, Empusa.<br/>
Lillian: How's Ravana?<br/>
Hadrian: Not happy from what I've heard. I've not seen him in almost six decades.<br/>
Lillian: I swear to Satan if Death did that to James and I, I would commit some serious damage.<br/>
Hadrian: He's done it to Tom and I twice. At least the first time we had no memories of being eternals. This is the first time I have ever remembered.<br/>
Lillian: Same with me and with Asmodeus.<br/>
Hadrian: Nice. You think we're slightly past calling each other by our eternal names?<br/>
Lillian: Yeah you might be right there Hadrian. We gonna call Remus.<br/>
Hadrian: Yeah. I haven't seen him in a thousand years.<br/>
Lillian: I just had a life with him.<br/>
Hadrian: Lucky sod.<br/>
Lillian: He was my brother.<br/>
Hadrian: Life three Tom was my brother. I was adopted because Death likes making me an orphan.<br/>
Lillian: Did you cause a scandal?<br/>
Hadrian: Yes. It was great. We were eventually murdered and we took the opportunity to pay good old Satan a visit. His place is like the best club you've ever been too. There was so much alcohol. We were drunk for three weeks after we left.<br/>
Lillian: While I'm waiting for you back home I am going to go see Satan. Remember that time we got kicked out of heaven?<br/>
Hadrian: Was that because we were all really drunk or because Tom shoved me up against a walk and started making out with me?<br/>
Lillian: I seem to recall it was both along with Sirius doing a fully clothed pole dance around one of the pillars.<br/>
Hadrian: That was one of our better nights. Heaven is supposedly the place where you are rewarded but actually it's boring as.<br/>
Lillian: No sex, no alcohol, no gays, no sex. What kind of place is it?<br/>
Hadrian: I don't know.</p>
