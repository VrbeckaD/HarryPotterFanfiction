  <u> Draco’s POV: </u>
</p><p> </p><p>I didn’t want I be here. I didn’t want to be here just to watch Pansy flirt with Miss-know-it-all. I also didn’t want to watch all the other happy couples that have moved on, have a good time while I just sit here, drink in my hand, with nothing to do. This stupid reunion thing. I never wanted to be here, I’ll always get dirty looks from literally everyone who sees me. I’m honestly surprised that all of the Slytherins got invited to this thing. But of course, <em> Saint Potter </em>has to be oh-so-nice-and-forgiving that everyone is invited from our year.</p><p>Speaking of that waste-of-space, where was he? I needed to make sure to avoid him. And no, I’m not drunk in the slightest. I’ve had two cups of firewhiskey and that’s it. It's not like I'm drinking so I can forget. No one can ever forget what I did, especially myself, no matter how much I want to.</p><p>Oh crap. I found that good-for-nothing. He’s making a fool of himself on the dance floor. He has zero shame. Ugh. As I get up to avoid him, my name is suddenly called by Pansy.</p><p>“Ugh, you finished flirting with that know-it-all now? I’ve found Potter and my mission is to avoid him as much as possible,” I say to her. She laughs.</p><p>“Come on, Draco, go see him. I’m sure he’ll be happy to see you.”</p><p>“Pfft.”</p><p>“I’m serious. You need to talk to him.”</p><p>“Need I repeat myself?” We go on for a bit until she finally mentions that Potter has spotted me. Naturally, of course, I turn around and confirm her statement. He’s looking at me. No, he’s <em> staring </em>at me.</p><p>I turn back around, still feeling his green eyes on my back. I shudder at his gaze. I want to turn around and confront him, <em> talk </em> to him like a normal person. But, as you can tell, (this I'll admit), that I'm a coward. Stupid, stupid, stupid Draco for believing he could ever confront Potter again.</p><p>I suppose I should put what happened at Hogwarts behind me, it was many years ago. But, I can’t. It causes too much pain to think about, and… I’ll admit it was mostly my fault. I had so many chances, but I threw them away. He still is present in my life. He would casually waltz into my dreams or I’d find a paper swan lying around.</p><p>Just as I’m about to start sprinting away, I hear a very drunken Potter behind me, “M-Malfoy? Y-You came?”</p><p>I turn on my heel as slow as I could to face Potter. I try to look confident, but my skin goes paler than normal, and my breath suddenly goes away. Why? I may or may not have forgotten how Potter looks. And I certainly wasn’t ready to see him like this…</p><p>I look him up and down (and no, not checking out). Messy hair, crooked glasses. A slightly too big of a shirt on, but still somehow complimenting is physique. His pants just the right size for him. Still the same as he was from school, but his scar has faded a little, it’s not as distinct. While looking at his scar, I accidentally make eye contact.</p><p>“Uh,” I start to say, well, more like mumble, “Well, yeah. Gotta show up in spite of you not wanting me to come.” <em> What was that supposed to mean? </em> “Y’know, since you hate me and all,” I continue. <em> What am I saying? STOP ALREADY! </em></p><p>Thankfully, before I could say anything else stupid, Potter stops me.</p><p>"What are you talking about?" he says, approaching me, "I actually wanted you to come, I just didn't think you'd even show..."</p><p>I look at him, still keeping eye contact, somehow. His deep, emerald green colored eyes are too distracting sometimes... </p><p>“Wait, you wanted me to come?” I ask, shaking my head, “Potter, you are clearly <em> drunk </em>. Ugh, I’ll just be leaving then.”</p><p>What I did not expect was my hand to be grabbed, and my whole body being yanked towards the brown-haired boy behind me. His grip is firm, and warm. His hands are rougher than I thought they would be, and his hands are pretty big too.</p><p>Why am I thinking about his hands? What? That's weird, don't do that.</p><p>"Potter what are you do-"</p><p>"Shush for once in your life, Malfoy. I've got something to show you."</p><p>I didn't like that, how he said my name. I made a face, but it got ignored because he was already dragging me towards a random door. At this point, I had given up trying to talk, too frustrated to continue, and mostly flustered by the fact that my hand was still in Potter’s. All I could ever think from this moment on is, <em> why me? </em></p>
