    <p>Lily doesn’t know what Severus is doing here. </p><p>James has been telling her such horror stories, his low voice syrup-slick as he leans over to whisper each one of Severus’ sins in her ear. James always wears a coy, oily smirk as he murmurs his poison, leaning so close that his breath ghosts over Lily’s neck, as if each piece of information he gives her is the one that will finally convince her to put his ring on her finger. That’s the problem with James, Lily is quickly learning. He hates to distraction, and so often that hate eclipses whatever love he might feel. </p><p>(Lily refused James quite easily, something she almost feels sorry for, since he’d taken it in his head to propose at their graduation ceremony in front of what felt like the entire Wizarding World. But they’d only been dating for six months, so Lily doesn’t feel like her reaction was in any way unreasonable. Given his resulting tantrum in response to her incredulous <em> of course not, what in the hell are you thinking asking such a thing </em> , Lily feels quite secure in her decision, and each time James visits her home with yet another story of Severus’ misdeeds, she only grows more and more certain that she would have <em> hated </em>being Mrs. Potter.)</p><p>Severus looks good, Lily notices idly as they stare at one another. Distinguished. His long hair is clean and smooth, the ends barely brushing the collar of his unbuttoned duster. He is still thin, but he’s lost the haggard frame of his Hogwarts years. She can see the curve of wiry muscles through his shirt, and while his hands are still stained with ink, his nails are cleaner than she’s ever seen them. He’ll never be as handsome as James-- his thrice broken nose still takes up too much of his face, his teeth are crooked, and his trousers are still a touch too short. But he looks healthy, and the lines on his forehead have smoothed to nearly nothing. </p><p>“Severus,” Lily breathes, forgetting for a moment that his duster probably covers one of those damned tattoos and the late-night promise she made to herself all those years ago to never speak to him again. “You've grown up.”</p><p>A small, nearly invisible smile flits across his face, but it is gone so quickly that later Lily convinces herself that she must have imagined it. It is beginning to snow, and Lily watches, entranced, as snowflakes catch on Severus’ hair, bright white juxtaposed perfectly against jet black. That brief hint of a grin still plays at the corner of his full lips, and oh, he is so, so dear that it is all Lily can do not to weep at the sight of that tiny glint of happiness.</p><p>“So have you,” Severus replies, his voice smoother than she remembers it being. His Northern accent is all but gone, but she can still hear the slight burr in those brief words, and the sound warms Lily down to her toes. His dark eyes are wide as he stares at her, almost in awe, and it is difficult for Lily not to buckle under the unabashed tenderness she finds in his gaze. “You look… You look lovely.”</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Lily forces herself to focus on the situation instead of how his compliment makes her heart twitch dangerously. She hopes that he blames her blush on the cold. </p><p>Severus straightens then, though he was hardly slouching before, his face going carefully blank as he clasps his hands together. Any trace of kindness she might have seen in him is gone in that moment, and all that is left is cold calculation. </p><p>“You have to leave,” he informs her, his voice frigid. “Your flat is one of the next targets in a raid--” his voice hitches, just for a moment, and Lily knows that it is only her intimate knowledge of Severus that even allows her to pick up on his momentary slip, “I have been designated to come and collect you in order to move you to a safe house of the Order’s choosing.”</p><p>Lily gapes at him and doesn’t move. He sighs and runs a hand through his dark hair. It is quiet for a moment, Two.</p><p>“Lily--” he tries again.</p><p>“I don’t remember you being this stupid, Severus,” she cuts him off, ignoring the brief flash of hurt in the dark eyes of the man before her. “What are you <em> thinking</em>?”</p><p>“I--”</p><p>Lily shakes her head, her hair whipping across her face and brushing her bare neck. Severus isn’t in the Order-- if he was, he’d know the codes, he’d know that all their safehouses are full. He must be desperate, she thinks, to risk exposing himself like this.</p><p>“You’re not <em> in </em> the Order, Severus,” Lily exclaims, crossing her arms and glaring meaningfully at his forearm before turning her eyes back to his. He doesn’t look surprised at her outburst, only disappointed, the right side of his mouth twitching unhappily. “You’re-- what are you doing? Are you trying to-- to <em> lure </em> me somewhere? Or--”</p><p>“Lily, please,” the previous iciness in Severus’ tone is melted through, and all Lily hears now is anxiety, is bone-crushing fear as her old friend’s deep-dark eyes widen and he puts his hands up, palms forward, skittish. He hasn’t gone for his wand yet, which is the only reason Lily hasn’t gone for hers, but she’s watching him, waiting for him to make a move. “You need to trust me, Order or not. I’m not trying to hurt you. I’d never-- You need to run. I need you to run.”</p><p>“Why do you want me to run? What do you get out of this? Severus answer me--”</p><p>He does answer her, though not in the way that Lily expects. He takes two steps forward, gets in her face, until his hands are brushing the folds in her dress, and it is all Lily can do not to fall straight into his arms. Idly, she notices how very tall he is, how small she feels standing next to him. It should scare her, this clear imbalance between them. But she can feel his heavy breaths on her cheek as she tilts her head up to stare at him, can feel his fingers ghosting over the fabric at her waist, and all Lily can feel is angry anticipation gathering in her chest, spreading through her bones like wildfire. She wants to kill him. She wants to kiss him. She wants him <em> gone</em>.</p><p>“What do I get out of this?” Severus’s once smooth voice is explosive now, vicious, and most of all <em> hurt </em> as he rages at Lily, as his dangerously heated gaze meets her own fiery glare head-on. “How can you ask me that? How can you even--”</p><p>“You’re a Death Eater,” Lily snaps punishingly, her voice colder than the wind whipping around them, her eyes burning with furious tears as she pounds her fists against his chest. “You’re everything I ever feared. So answer the question Severus Snape, or so help me, I’ll--”</p><p>“What do I get out of saving your life?” Severus asks again incredulously, a sharp bark of a laugh punctuating the question. In one swift, fluid movement that reveals that feline grace that Lily knows he learned from watching his mother, Severus catches both her fists as they fly at him, quelling her with his piercing gaze and the just-this-side of painful pressure he uses to still her hands, to pull them to his chest. “Merlin, it’s like you don’t know.”</p><p>Lily shakes her head, confused, but doesn’t interrupt for once. Somehow, this moment feels too fragile, too vital to shatter with her quick anger and raging hurt. Severus is looking up at the sky, furrowing his eyebrows at the snowflakes as if he is noticing the weather for the first time, biting his lower lip in the same way he did when they were just children and the world was kinder. Oh, Lily has<em> missed </em> him, has missed everything about him-- and isn’t that dangerous? Isn’t that terrible, to love a man with dark magic singing seductive in his blood, a man with violence and terror as his inheritance? Isn’t this <em> exactly </em> what Lily deserves?</p><p>“What do I get out of this?” Severus’ voice is but a murmur now. He leans down further until their noses are touching, and Lily doesn’t dare breathe. His right hand lets go of one of her clenched fists and reaches up to cup her cheek, and though it is colder than death, Lily feels herself leaning into it. Severus lip twitches, and his eyes spark with something ephemeral and wild and seething. “<em>This</em>, Lily. Merlin, I get <em> this</em>.”</p><p>Then Severus wrenches Lily to him, his left hand hand grasping desperately into the flesh of her hip, the other tipping her chin up with those beautiful fingers. He kisses her on the mouth, <em> hard</em>, his cold lips pressed against hers in one single, searing moment of blinding intensity and before she can react, before Lily can open her lips and drink him in, he’s pulling himself away from her almost violently, stumbling as he backs away from her as if <em> she </em> is the dangerous one. Warmth pools low in Lily’s belly and she goes to reach for him, but he looks at her with such shame, such unbridled terror as they stand there, and for just one moment, she sees the mask slip, sees the scared little boy who she loves so dearly. But then Severus remembers himself, or rather, forgets to <em> forget </em>himself, and his face hardens he storms away, leaving Lily standing on her doorstep with outstretched arms and a twice-broken heart. She touches her lips idly, her fingers tracing the outline of his kiss as snowflakes weave themselves between her eyelashes and the wind bites at her cheeks.</p><p>Lily stands in the cold alone, silent, and aches.</p><p>(Later, a nondescript barn owl taps on Lily’s window, a piece of scrap parchment in its claws. The bird doesn’t bother to wait for the bit of bacon she offers it, too much like its master to bother with such pleasantries. </p><p><em> Forgive my forwardness earlier</em>, the letter reads. He doesn’t bother with a greeting or a signature, but Lily would recognize Severus’ spidery scrawl anywhere. <em> I could think of no truer way of convincing you. The raid is scheduled for tomorrow night at six. Either tell your Order now or meet me in Spinner’s End by five tomorrow evening. I never meant to be something you feared, Lily. Please don’t fear me now, not when I can save you. Please </em> (this word is underlined twice) <em> let me save you. </em></p><p>Lily doesn’t cry as she packs up her flat, but it’s a close thing.)</p>
