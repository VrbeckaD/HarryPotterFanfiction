    <p>The 31st of October in the year 1981 had fared well for the majority of humankind. Children and adults alike had pranced around their local streets, begging for fun and treats. All was well for them. They had all gone to bed, hearts filled to the brim with delicious and plentiful happiness.  Joy was present in the air but not for all. </p><p> </p><p>There was silent whispering in Godric’s Hollow. Young Lily Potter murmured sweet lullabies over her infant’s cot. Baby Harry whimpered and whimpered, wishing for his mother to stay with him. She kissed him on the forehead, took a glance at the desperate emerald eyes staring back at her from the cot, and turned to leave the room. She froze when Harry called out to her. He cried on, trying to catch his mother’s attention. Lily wished she could turn back to him with a warm smile on her face, but it was impossible. She did not know when that or any happiness could ever happen again. </p><p><em> Why won’t these treacherous times end? </em> <b> </b></p><p>She gently closed the door, but the subtle scrape of wood echoed throughout the house and cut through the rigid air. </p><p>James Potter sat against the wall, knees up to his chin. His head was buried between his knees, his hands tangled in his raven locks. His wire glasses hung from the tips of his fingers. His abandoned wand rolled towards the opposite end of the corridor and teetered near the couple’s bedroom doorway. As the nursery door’s echo continued, Lily slid down to the floor beside James. She gazed at the wall and watched the wand clatter against it. Every clash and bang against the wall shuddered through the pair on the floor. Lily shivered. She felt goosebumps on James as her arm touched his.</p><p>Lily turned to look at him, sensing his relentless fear. </p><p>
  <em> All we do is be afraid.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>He watched Wormtail run rampant across the expansive dining room. The young man muttered under his breath, blatant anxiety rising with each step. Watching him made Voldemort regret ever coming to stay at the Manor. It was awfully difficult to concentrate on one’s self in these circumstances. </p><p>When Wormtail passed once more, Voldemort seized his arm and leered at the tense man. </p><p>“Wormtail, stop bloody pacing! Sit. down.”</p><p>He jumped and breathed out, “Y-yes, my Lord.”</p><p>Voldemort let go of the arm. He watched as the man pulled back one of the elegant chairs with unsteady hands and sat down. Wormtail kept his eyes away from the Dark Lord, only glancing upon occasion. Voldemort looked out at his followers, the young staring intently. Their eyes all pleaded deep, dark desires they would never achieve. Crabbe picked at his fingernails but inside was wishing to rise to fame. Malfoy’s eyes looked up at Voldemort and glistened with a yearning to be recognized. When the blonde man noticed his master looking, he straightened his posture, ready to fulfill his duty. The deranged Bellatrix Lestrange turned expectedly to Voldemort, mirroring Malfoy. He chuckled to himself. How naïve.</p><p>Voldemort folded his hands, resting them lightly on the hiemal wood. Clearing his throat to awaken those in the room, he finally began to speak.</p><p>“Now that we’ve settled…” </p><p>“My-my lord, if I may…” Voldemort looked out of the corner of his eye. One of the Death Eaters slowly rose. </p><p>“My lord, if I could be your companion on this important task, it would be my greatest honor.”</p><p>Voldemort had to fight the urge to roll his eyes and scoff. With scarcely a thought, he slipped his wand from his robes and pointed it at the imbecile.</p><p>“<em>Crucio </em>.”</p><p>The Death Eater cried out in pain and fell onto the ground, shaking. His wails echoed achingly throughout the room. Raw electricity ran through his burned veins. His body contorted upon the floor.</p><p>The other Death Eaters watched on. Some looked on with fear and thankfulness that they had not spoken up and ended their Halloween night with a glimpse towards insanity. They knew that interrupting the Dark Lord’s word was a perilous business. Others gazed admirably, smirking at the convulsing man.</p><p>Voldemort finally stopped the curse, turning his attention back to the task at hand. The Death Eaters only glanced at the thrashing man before returning to dutiful focus. </p><p>“Tonight is the night we have all been waiting for. Wormtail’s role as Secret Keeper for the Potters has finally come to fruition. I will, at last, be able to go after the boy.”</p><p>Voldemort saw his followers’ eyes glisten with anticipation. Nagini slithered up onto Voldemort’s side. He stroked her lightly. Looking back up at his audience, he hissed, “My reign will be threatened no longer.” </p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>The clock above the nursery door kept ticking and ticking. It kept incessantly reminding the Potters that time was passing by, escaping from them. It trickled away, never to return. Lily began to feel tears running down her cheeks. Hands scrambling to her faces, she tried to hide her tears from herself and the man beside her. Her heart began to race, her breathing heavy and unsteady. She whispered to herself, “No...no, not today. Not today, please. Oh, God...”</p><p>She tried to calm herself. She rarely cried so she wouldn’t start now because of that Voldemort tosser. Her hands shook as she rubbed fast at her eyes. </p><p>James shuffled and finally looked up from his knees. He saw Lily’s state through his blurry vision and felt another pang of despair. He gently wrapped his arms around her as if his misery could channel through her and turn into rejuvenation. Lily persistently wiped at her face to hide her distress. James leaned across the corridor to retrieve his wand.</p><p>“<em>Tergeo </em>.”</p><p>Her tears vanished but the heavy breathing remained. James held his wife as she steadied her breathing. Voldemort would come soon; they could both feel it in their bones. James held onto Lily a bit tighter and felt her squeeze back. Hopefully, Peter would keep them a secret.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>There was creaking in Godric’s Hollow. The rusting gate outside the Potter home slowly opened. A dark figure wearing billowing robes threaded into the back garden and drifted to the door. A thin pale arm reached, grasping into the depths of the robes. Retrieving their wand, the figure pointed at the door handle.<em><br/>
