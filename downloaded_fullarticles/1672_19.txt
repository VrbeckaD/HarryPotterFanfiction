    <p>It was strange to think that war hadn’t turned him into a killer, but 3 years of being punished for it had changed him so much that he didn’t even flinch as he felt the man’s neck snapped beneath his bare hands. He grinned up at Tyson, letting the trail of blood that was dripping from his forehead run over his lips, the taste of it familiar by now on his tongue.</p>
<p>Draco shifted elegantly back to his feet, in one smooth move, his eyes wandering the room, judging who was cheering for him, who was stepping back and measuring each response. It was best to know where everyone around him stood, it might be a different world, but status here still meant everything. Only here he’d finally earnt it for himself.</p>
<p>He swept his hand across his face, smearing the blood out of his eye and his hair back into place in its low ponytail in one move. He walked through the crowd. Apart from the occasional slap on the back in congratulations no one dared touch him, they shifted aside to let him pass as he made his away up to the second-floor walkway where Tyson had been watching him. It hadn’t been all that long ago when they’d still be grabbing at his ass on his way past. No one would dare doing that now. He grinned to himself at the thought.</p>
<p>Well, no one except…</p>
<p>He reached Tyson who was looking at him like he was a treasure. Like he was actually something shiny that he’d dug up out of the dirt, cleaned off and had turned out to be worthwhile. The analogy, while disturbingly accurate, made Draco feel sick. A clenching in his gut that he hid behind a proud, slightly adoring, measured smile that he’d perfected. It was his ‘Tyson only’ smile. One that served him well over the years, and just as well now.</p>
<p>Tyson took a step towards him, snaking an arm around his waist and drawing him straight back into his cell. Tyson’s cell was the only one with a semblance of privacy, one of the bonuses to sleeping with the boss. They ducked under the hanging sheets of his bars. The second they were out of sight Draco was tossed against the wall, his face pressed into the cement wall. He grunted, slightly, but managed to hold back any further response as the older man worked on stripping them both.</p>
<p>‘You did so well out there Draco.’ He half purred, half groaned. Draco shifted away from the wall just enough to let Tyson strip his shirt off, before being shoved back against it. The cold, rough cement was the friction he was used to, he’d taught his body to respond, to use it, to enjoy it the best he could. If it was going to happen anyway he might as well get something from it.</p>
<p>Objectively Tyson wasn’t the worst option in here. He was maybe mid thirties so a bit over ten years older than him, but he was well built. His hands were strong, which ha appreciated as they pressed into his hips, grinding his ass back against Tyson’s crotch where he could already feel the growing bulge. Draco smiled slightly to himself, yeah, that wasn’t a bad part about it either.</p>
<p>‘My fierce little dragon.’ Tyson purred, biting down on his neck as his hand reached around, slipping Draco’s pants over the curve of his ass. Draco reached down, his long fingers wrapping around his own length, well aware that Tyson wouldn’t waste his time with it.</p>
<p>He moaned as he felt those large, warm hands spreading his ass cheeks and braced himself against the wall, waiting for the other negative about being fucked by Tyson. With barely a second notice Tyson pressed into him, forcing himself all the way in with one slow thrust. Draco closed his eyes, biting into his bottom lip as he tried to work past the sting. He was lucky they’d fucked this morning, that Tyson usually managed to have a supply of condoms, with lube, that he was still worked up from the fight, adrenaline pumping through his veins with every heartbeat. But god it still hurt for those first couple of impatient thrusts, until Draco managed to relax, until he managed to shift in time with him and angle himself right so that it actually brushed against the right spot and then-</p>
<p>‘Merlin…’ he groaned out, hand working quickly up and down his length, timed with each desperate thrust.</p>
<p>It didn’t last too long, it was enough to get Draco properly riled up just as he felt Tyson tense, come, and pull out. He closed his eyes, imagining whatever he had to so that he came in the next few strokes. Any longer and Tyson would see that as an offence. So he flicked his thumb over the head of his dick, imaging shiny green eyes, an easy smile, a laugh that echoed through the whole hall… He groaned as he spilt over his hand, knees trembling slightly as he pushed away from the wall and turned back to look at Tyson, making sure his ‘Tyson only’ smile was back in place.</p>
<p>‘So, I take it he won’t be your go to man anymore?’ Draco asked, neatly shifting his pants back up, washing his hands in the sink in the corner and sweeping up his shirt from the floor. The conversation about the man he killed came so easily, so casually. It seemed like something that should matter, but in here it just didn’t.</p>
<p>‘Oh, my jealous little Dragon,’ Tyson laughed, ‘yes Draco. You’ve earnt it. The newbies and C and D cell are yours. And you can take his room, it was a double.’ Draco pulled his shirt on, looking in the mirror as he cleaned his hair, put it back up and tried to wash the blood off his face properly. Which really wasn’t much use while it was still bleeding, the dickhead might have been mostly useless at running things, but he was pretty tricky with a pipe.</p>
<p>‘I’ll take it. Let me know if there’s anything you need Ty.’ He smiled at him, pausing just long enough in case he wanted to respond before ducking out of the cell, ignoring the amused eyes of the guards as he walked down the corridor.</p>
<p>What they thought didn’t matter. There was meant to be a load of fresh meat coming in today, and he was officially in charge of it. For the first time … since he couldn’t even remember but it was probably back at Hogwarts … it actually felt like he had finally gotten his feet under him. And for the first time ever he’d done it himself.</p>
<p>‘Malfoy!’ the annoyingly familiar voice broke through his thoughts, he spun and responded without a thought.</p>
<p>‘What now Potter?’ he snapped, the froze, staring into those deep green eyes.<br/> Well fuck.</p>
