    <p class="western">Noct was dead, and they were dying.</p><p class="western">Prompto could feel it with every breath he took, every step he took; a cold seeping deep into his too heavy bones, the darkness that clung to the edges of his vision even with the painful glare of a new dawn, the yawning <em>aching</em> chasm within him where his bestfriend used to be. He could see it in Iggy's bowed head, his shaking shoulders and trembling hands, the pallor of his skin, scars standing out silver and red in the light of day, his daggers discarded on the floor, unneeded, unable to be returned to the crystalline Armiger they once called home. See it in Gladio, the hang of his head, the dullness of his eyes, his breath rattling in his lungs, and the stillness of his hands. A river shivering on its last trickle. A mountain broken and silent.</p><p class="western">They were dying. All of them. Dying with the first break of dawn in ten years, like they themselves were the daemons they fought so zealously before, being burned away by a light so foreign they couldn't bear its touch anymore.</p><p class="western">This was not <em>their</em> light. Was not the promise of what they clung to for ten years, was not the light they breathed into themselves and bound to their very souls.</p><p class="western">He huffed a laugh, half tears, half pain.</p><p class="western">How could Cor live like this, Prompto wondered, his heart a gaping void of pain. The Marshal had sworn himself to the light of King Mor, and lost him. Sworn himself to King Regis, and lost him. Sworn himself to Noctis....<br/>
<br/>
How did he keep going, Prompto wondered with a numb mixture of pity, horror, and twisted admiration. How did he keep going with this pain? Was he truly as immortal as the stories said? Or was he truly that strong in both heart and mind?</p><p class="western">The sun hurt his eyes.</p><p class="western">He stared at it, relishing the pain, the ache. They had fought so hard for this. To bring the dawn. They'd spent ten years chasing this dawn, waiting for this morning, planning for it. They'd known, of course they had. How could they not? Ardyn told them the very day that Noct went into the crystal what his fate would be, and then spent the next ten years tormenting them with that knowledge. Taunting them, accusing them, mocking them. They knew Noctis was the King of Light, and that eventually he would have to lay down his life to bring the dawn, they had <em>known</em> that. The life of Royalty was Sacrifice.</p><p class="western">He thought he was prepared.</p><p class="western">He was wrong.</p><p class="western">The pain of his eyes facing a light they were so unaccustomed to was preferable to the cold ache inside of himself where Noct's light once was.</p><p class="western">The sky was so blue.</p><p class="western">Like his eyes had been.</p><p class="western">“So.... this is it, huh,” he heard himself saying out-loud in the too silent courtyard.</p><p class="western">“Indeed,” Ignis agreed, his voice rough, and low as he leaned back and sat heavily upon the stone steps of the Citadel, just below him. The sound of his boots scraping the stone almost too loud in the stillness, in the silence.</p><p class="western">Gladio breathed deep, and then sighed, somehow slumping further, before he looked up, and straightened his shoulders. A mountain broken, but not yet shattered as he looked up at the rising sun with something like defiance, “Enjoy the sunrise, boys. I don't think we'll see another one to be honest,” he observed with a deep breath as he closed his eyes, and took in the light.</p><p class="western">“Yeah. No kidding,” Prompto agreed softly, following suit as he closed his wet and aching eyes, turning his face towards the sun, feeling the heat of it bleed into his skin, and felt the stillness fill him along with it.</p><p class="western">He didn't know how long they sat there, breathing it in, soaking it in.</p><p class="western">Part of him felt like he was drowning somewhere in Niflheim. Heavy, cold, and dark even as he felt the newborn sun on his skin. The sun that Noct fought and died to bring back, his last gift to them, his final sacrifice.</p><p class="western">A tiny part of him hated it.</p><p class="western">A tiny part of him said they didn't do enough. Didn't try hard enough.</p><p class="western">A tiny part of him said they should have saved Noct and damn the world.</p><p class="western">A larger one regretted.... regretted not telling him how he really felt.</p><p class="western">The largest wanted to see him again.</p><p class="western">Something touched his leg, and he couldn't even find it in himself to jump or reach for his gun as he opened his eyes and looked down to see what creature had survived.</p><p class="western">Umbra peered up at him with intelligent golden eyes.</p><p class="western">“Hey boy. What are you doing here?” he asked softly, kneeling down to rub the dog's head. When Lunafreya had died, Pryna had passed with her. He had... always assumed the same would happen with Noct and Umbra. The dogs seemed so intertwined with the both of them despite being Messengers of the Gods. If it weren't for the coldness inside of him, he might have taken the messenger's appearance at his side as a sign that Noct still lived. If he didn't feel the absence of his bestfriend's light within him, and know that he was dead, dead, <em>dead</em>.</p><p class="western">Umbra wuffed and pawed at his leg, licking his nose briefly before attempting to do the same to Prompto's chin.</p><p class="western">Who was going to take care of Umbra.... now that both Noct and Luna were gone?</p><p class="western">He would have done it in a heartbeat, but he didn't have many of those left. So, he gave what comfort he could to the animal who would soon be on his own, without familiar faces, or friends, without a kind hand, or a treat, or a book to deliver between estranged lovers. Without a friend to return to. In a dead world where food was scarce, and a dog of Umbra's size would feed a family for at least a few days.</p><p class="western">“You stay safe, you hear?” he told the dog, gently grasping his face and peering deep into his eyes.</p><p class="western">“Yeah. People get mean when they're hungry. Stay out of sight, or they might try to put you on the menu,” Gladio warned, the heavy thunk of his boots approaching before he knelt and added his own hand to the dog, stroking gently down the canine's back.</p><p class="western">“Perhaps the Marshal will care for him, in our absence,” Ignis offered quietly as he joined them, hand outstretched towards the dog who lapped at his fingertips in familiarity.</p><p class="western">Umbra's eyes glowed, and the floor dropped out from beneath them.</p><p class="western"> </p>

<hr/><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“G-Gentiana?” Ignis' voice croaked as consciousness slowly returned to them.</p><p class="western">Prompto ached all over, it.... it felt like he had just been rescued at Zegnautus Keep. His whole body felt bruised, wrung out, and exhausted. It was.... he almost felt too hot for his skin as he panted for breath and slowly levered himself upright out of the – the grass?</p><p class="western">He wished he could snap completely to his senses like they did in stories and games, but everything spun and dipped around him, that darkness around his vision wavered like a heat-haze growing brighter and dimmer every other second as he tried to get his bearings. Yes, it was grass. Beautiful, lush green grass, the likes of which he hadn't seen since they were running across the plains of Duscae ten years ago.</p><p class="western">Now, much of the world was blackened. The plants unable to support life without sunlight to photosynthesise. Patches of land around Lestallum were less effected, Holly and Cindy had worked hard on creating UV lamps around the city that the refugees tended – after the hunters did their sweep to make sure nothing was lurking amidst the plants. Prompto had travelled all of Lucis on chocobo-back looking for survivors. He had seen more of the world in those ten years than he did while travelling with Noct, and all of it was blackened, and dead. The Starscourge was a terrible plague, yes, it killed and stole many lives.</p><p class="western">But the thing that killed the most people was simply hunger.</p><p class="western">There hadn't been enough food for all the mouths they needed to feed, people needed to move to other outposts, needed to farm more food, needed to provide power. Lestallum couldn't power the world, though they did try. And in the end, how many times had Prompto responded to a distress call from an Outpost and arrived too late? Too many.</p><p class="western">Galdin Quay would forever be his biggest regret.</p><p class="western">He had been at Meldacio, practically the otherside of the country, but both Dino and Coctura had been there. They had just gotten married, they were talking about children, naming them. Coctura wanted to call their son Navyth, after her missing Uncle. Dino wanted to name their daughter Pearl. They had been so happy. And then a tidal storm swept in, and knocked the power out.</p><p class="western">Prompto raced the wind itself, pushed his chocobo to the point of exhaustion, and arrived to see the blackened restaurant, his heart in his throat, and knew he had to look, had to check. He raced past nests of mind-flayers, under the swings of iron giants and red giants, leapt over tonberries, and skidded to a stop within the shattered tables and scattered chairs of the restaurant. His eyes locked on the empty piles of clothing abandoned and sodden on the floor.</p><p class="western">Coctura's salt-stained chef blouse, and scarf.</p><p class="western">Dino's snazzy shirt and silk tie that he somehow kept clean despite the years.</p><p class="western">His chocobo hadn't waited for him to regain his senses before it was bolting out the back of the restaurant and leaping directly into the water to avoid the daemons still there. The splash of cold salt-water to his face woke him up, jarred him from his horror, and brought him back to the then and there. He grabbed the reigns and steered his bird to the haven just down the beach, and only once they were there, and they were safe, did he collapse, and cry. Bitter, furious, and heartbroken. He had wanted to tell Coctura that he found Nayvth, alive, and well, fishing for the survivors up at the Vesperpool. He was the only reason Meldacio didn't starve like so many other outposts. No one could sustainably fish for a town better than him, or harvest water-edibles that many didn't even know existed.</p><p class="western">But even the plant-life at the Vesperpool had not survived the years of darkness without trouble.</p><p class="western">Plant-life that now looked half-dead and drab by comparison to the lush emerald green grass, cool and moist, beneath his fingers as he stared down at a <em>ladybug</em> clinging stubbornly to a stem.</p><p class="western">He hadn't seen one of those in.... in years.</p><p class="western">He looked up, flinching from the bright early morning sunlight, and goggled at a world turned <em>green</em> and <em>alive</em> around him.</p><p class="western">Trees taller than alpha Anaks towered over them, thick boughs of unknown wood flush with greenery, the sound of bird-song, so alien it took him a moment to even recognise it as he stared around himself at the bushes, and the <em>flowers</em>, at the milling and buzzing insects he could see in the morning sunlight overhead, a distant butterfly on a pink bloom, and the sight of Gladio sat cross-legged, bewildered, and all of fourteen, not a scar on his face, nor a whisker on his chin.</p><p class="western">Prompto blinked, and then reached up to rub his eyes.</p><p class="western">His hand was tiny.</p><p class="western">What.</p><p class="western">He twisted in place to see Iggy, Iggy who had almost always been over six foot, broad-shouldered, deceptively strong, and perfectly coif'ed, fourteen, messy haired, short and scrawny, bewildered as he gingerly felt around himself like he.... like he had when he first lost his eyes, despite his face being clear of the silvery magic scars the Ring gave him.</p><p class="western">“What.... happ<em>ened</em>?” Prompto heard a voice, a horrifyingly familiar voice, just on that cusp, still breaking with puberty. And felt his face beginning to burn in familiar mortification. He had waited until <em>after</em> he stopped doing that before talking to Noct!</p><p class="western">The others were too kind to comment as Ignis sat back on his shins, and Gladio gestured helplessly, “Umbra. Last I saw was his eyes glowing, and then it – felt like we fell.”</p><p class="western">Ignis nodded, “Indeed. And Gentiana. I heard her voice.”</p><p class="western">Prompto paused in his cautious exploration of his body, and tilted his head, realising for the first time that..... he didn't feel empty anymore. The cold that ached deep within his bones was gone. He could breathe without feeling as though he were drowning, as though the very air itself were made of ice.</p><p class="western">“He's alive,” he breathed.</p><p class="western">There was a moment of silence, and then –</p><p class="western">“He is,” Gladio realised, hand pressed over his heart in something like wonder.</p><p class="western">Ignis staggered to his feet, eyes clamped shut, “We need to find him,” the retainer declared harshly.</p><p class="western">Gladio's arm snapped out and caught him by the back of his trousers, “Hold your chocobos there, Iggy,” he soothed, tugging him back down next to him. “Finding Noct goes without saying, but first, we need to sort ourselves out, and find out where we are. <em>Then</em> we can go looking for His Royal Pain in the Ass, alright?”</p><p class="western">Ignis looked muleish for all of a moment before he sighed in resignation and frustration, eventually nodding. Prompto wrinkled his nose, he <em>wanted</em> to argue, but he was exhausted, filthy, and while his injuries seemed to have vanished the echo of them ached fiercely. He would be of no use to Noct if he collapsed from exhaustion as soon as they found him, any of them.</p><p class="western">“Alright, good plan,” he agreed before flopping back on the grass, fighting off the unease he felt at the unfamiliar texture, at the vulnerable position he had put himself into, determined to enjoy just.... relaxing in the grass out in the sun. Something he hadn't done since they left the Crown City over a decade ago. How many years had they imagined this? Discussed picnics in Duscae once they brought the dawn and had Noct at their side? Joked about retirement where they set up shop at Wiz's, Iggy opening his own restaurant while Prompto and Noct ran the chocobo farm, and Gladio travelled with Sania furthering her scientific research, sending them dorky selfies and post-cards as he went. Cutting out Sania's science articles in the paper and framing them to embarrass the pair when they finally returned. Sending snarky messages to both Coctura at the Pearl, and Weskham at Maahgo challenging them to cook-offs, the smell of delicious meat, the soft kweh'ing of chocobos.... Noct's hand in his....<br/>
<br/>
“I could eat a behemoth,” he sighed, closing his eyes and shaking off the thoughts of... well, being anything other than Noct's bestfriend.</p><p class="western">“Zuu,” Gladio volunteered, “And all the eggs.”</p><p class="western">Ignis made a noise of mixed amusement, annoyance, and disbelief all rolled into one making Prompto grin and roll over onto his front, opening his eyes, “Fluffy chiffon cake with ulwaat berry coulis,” he crooned teasingly, his grin widening at the Look Ignis gave him, well aware he was being teased even with his eyes shut.</p><p class="western">“If you're quite done, perhaps we should make a move, and see about foraging something to eat along the way, yes?” Ignis suggested archly, making Prompto laugh and push himself up.</p><p class="western">“I'll follow you to the ends of Eos as long as you promise to cook,” the sniper vowed.</p><p class="western">“I believe that's called 'cupboard love',” Ignis pointed out as he took the outstretched hand the blond offered, getting to his feet.</p><p class="western">“I'd say it's more common sense,” Gladio quipped as he too got to his feet, brushing grass from the black fabric.</p><p class="western">“Is it indeed?” Ignis asked blandly.</p><p class="western">“Ifrit himself would use ice magic to get a taste of your cooking, Iggy,” Prompto pointed out with a laugh as he took the retainer's hand and began to lead him through the trees, Gladio dodging around them to take the lead as usual in the wilderness.</p><p class="western">Ten years of darkness, of stillness, and daemons in the shadows. It was <em>surreal</em> to wander through thick lush greenery now, to smell water and <em>life</em> instead of starscourge and dust. The birds continued to sing around them as they stumbled their way down a beast path that cut through the undergrowth between the trees. Thickets of brambles bearing tiny white flowers, clumps of livid magenta coloured flowers, daisies, even carpets of blue-bells visible between the trees around them. It.... was like a scene from heaven, from his deepest dreams, and he tightened his hand on Iggy's out of reflex, even though his wasn't the hand he wanted to hold.</p><p class="western">It must have been summer, or late spring, because it was hot, despite travelling under the shadows of the trees. Pretty soon, Gladio had stripped out of his Glaive jacket, tying it around his waist, and Prompto was considering doing the same but kind of stuck on the fact that.... They had been <em>thirty</em> before this. And now they were <em>fourteen</em>. He knew it was fourteen because he hadn't yet lost that last little bit of chub yet, because he was slimmer, much slimmer, but not enough yet, and still, his voice was breaking. He couldn't talk to Noct and have his voice crack in the middle of a sentence, he would die of sheer embarrassment. And yet....</p><p class="western">They were fourteen, wearing clothes that had fit them like gloves at thirty – or as close as Gladio could get seeing as he strained the fastenings of his jacket to some nigh obscene levels. By all rights, they should have been <em>swimming</em> in their uniforms. <em>Especially</em> Gladio who had yet to obtain the minimum pectoral girth of even his twenty-year old self despite looking like a seventeen year old while being fourteen. And yet their uniforms fit perfectly, even Gladio's which hadn't before their jump.</p><p class="western">“What.... is <em>that</em>?” the Shield demanded as they drew to a halt, his eyes turned to their right as they broke out from the forest and stood at the edge of what was clearly cultivated farmland, but on a massive scale unlike anything any of them had ever seen. And stood not even thirty feet away to their right, was a weird looking monster.</p><p class="western">Prompto turned his head to the side and squinted, “Looks a bit like a Garula,” he decided, eyeing the large black and white sides, and large flat nose. Definitely a herbivore, with a long fleshy tail tipped in hair. Like a coeurl, weird.</p><p class="western">“That's one messed up Garula then,” Gladio grunted before rubbing his chin consideringly, “Think it tastes the same?” he asked thoughtfully.</p><p class="western">“Well,” Ignis said, “There's only one way to find out,” he pointed out even as his hand filled with lightning.</p><p class="western">Whatever the beast was, it never stood a chance.</p><p class="western"> </p>
<hr/><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">When the big board lit up like a firework display at the Ministry of Magic, announcing an explosion of magical activity in a muggle location, newbie Auror Nymphadora Tonks thought she was going to have a heart attack as she toppled clean out of her seat. She had only just finished her probationary period after training and had been assigned the board as a milk run, nothing was ever supposed to happen while manning the board. Accidental Magic incidents were all forwarded to the board in the Underage Magic department, while this one was for Auror use only.</p><p class="western">The problem now was that it was going <em>crazy</em>.</p><p class="western">Location: Lark Hill, Salisbury.</p><p class="western">Spitting distance from Stonehenge, and the lesser known Woodhenge. Not to mention a very large muggle military base too. The incident was practically occurring on their back garden, and the last thing the Ministry wanted was to deal with Military cover-ups!</p><p class="western">With that forefront in her mind as she made her report and sounded the alert, the Auror team that assembled for dispatch came in quick and hard with their wands drawn and ready for action.</p><p class="western">“Three different magical signatures have been detected! Shield charms and elemental magic in use. Muggle presence unknown!” she reported as her post was taken over by another auror allowing her to grab her own robe and join her colleagues. As the responding Auror, despite being only a junior, she would be the one to lead them to the incident. “Muggleworthy excuse office has been informed, and an obliviation team is mustering! No presence of Dark Magic has been recorded, but be wary! Portkey will activate on my mark!” she shouted as she charmed the length of rope that was now in the hands of her colleagues, gripping it tightly in her own clammy, slightly shaking hand.</p><p class="western">“Three, two, one, MARK!”</p><p class="western">The Portkey hooked into her naval and jerked her into the air, spinning them to their destination. She hated portkeys, it was only a <em>lot</em> of practice that stopped her from falling on her face the second she landed, feet hitting grass, sunlight near blinding her, and the smell of smoke and roasting meat filling her nostrils.</p><p class="western">Her heart immediately sank at the thought they might have been too late, that there was some poor soul being burned alive, and then paused on abject confusion when she got her bearings and looked up.</p><p class="western">That was a whole <em>cow</em> roasting over an open fire.</p><p class="western">Around it, three teenagers in varying states of battered, bruised, and bloody, wearing some kind of black and silver uniform, looking just as confused and startled to see them as they were to see an <em>entire cow being spitroasted in the middle of the muggle countryside</em>.</p><p class="western">They stared at each other in sheer bewilderment. Of all the things that awaited them on the otherside of that portkey, teenagers eating a <em>cow</em> wasn't even on the <em>list!</em></p><p class="western">“Get on your knees!” Dawlish barked, bringing his wand up, and suddenly all the aurors were jarred into motion, fanning out to surround the boys as they jumped like scolded cats, abandoning their meal (A WHOLE COW), and moving themselves back to back defensively. “Drop your wands! Drop them!”</p><p class="western">But when no wands were thrown down as commanded, Dawlish growled in frustration and threw a stunning charm at the three boys who moved, their empty hands rising.</p><p class="western">A pearl coloured shield flashed up, the red spell splashing harmlessly across it in front of the tall blond with closed eyes. He was not holding a wand. Nor had he even opened his eyes.</p><p class="western">Dawlish snarled and threw another, backed up by Smith and Andrews. The two other boys shifted, and two more shields burst into life in front of them to block the spells – all of them with their hands empty, without wands.</p><p class="western">“<em>Accio wand!</em>” Stubbs commanded, pulling on her wand as though it were a rope, but nothing came to her, and a moment later, disarming charms, banishing charms, even low level curses were being tested upon the pearlescent shields the boys had up. With all the magic impacting against them, they were more white than semi-transparent from the ripples.</p><p class="western">This was getting them no where.</p><p class="western">“Stop! All – oh for Merlin's sake,” Tonks muttered to herself. All they were doing was increasing the risk of the muggle military investigating the light-show they were putting on. If any muggle teenagers, or a local farmer noticed this racket.... “<em>Soronus, </em>AURORS STAND DOWN!” she roared, and, for good measure, strode out into the middle of the cross-fire.</p><p class="western">Thankfully, it stopped.</p><p class="western">She breathed a shaky sigh of relief, she had been slightly worried that Dawlish wouldn't bother, she pressed her lips together and channelled Old McGonagall at her most severe, her metamorphic talents adjusting her features to match that of the stern Transfiguration Professor at her most disapproving to further the impression.</p><p class="western">“Boys,” she called sternly, drawing the majority of their attention away from the aurors around them. “I am Auror Tonks from the Ministry of Magic. Do you know why I am here?” she demanded harshly.</p><p class="western">“No,” the brunet grunted belligerently.</p><p class="western">“Not a clue,” the sunny blond chirped almost dismissively.</p><p class="western">“Indeed not,” the dirty blond admitted gravely, his british accent so thick it <em>had</em> to be fake.</p><p class="western">“What's an auror?” Sunny asked curiously, craning his neck to peer over his shoulder at her as he was the one faced furthest away.</p><p class="western">“Magical Law Enforcement,” Tonks explained flatly, watching as three sets of – well, two sets of eyes went wide, and one set of eye<em>brows</em> went up. “Our sensors detected extensive use of elemental magic and shield charms in a restricted non-magical area. Do you boys have any idea how much trouble you're in? There's a muggle military base not even ten miles away from this location! Not to mention two major muggle tourist destinations! You could have been <em>seen</em>! Anyone with a camera could have seen and taken pictures of you! And to top it off, poaching – a – whole – <em>cow!</em>” she exclaimed, still finding it practically impossible to wrap her brain around that fact. Who kills and eats a <em>whole</em> fucking cow?!</p><p class="western">“That does indeed sound serious,” Closed-Eyes admitted solemnly as he slowly lowered his arms and dropped his shield, the other two reluctantly following suit, but none of them moved position and remained back to back with each other, “But I am afraid the context is somewhat lost on us. What is a muggle? That is a term I have never heard before.”</p><p class="western">Her mouth dropped.</p><p class="western">Magic users in their mid-teens who had never <em>heard</em> of muggles?</p><p class="western">She shared a look with her colleagues, all of them looking just as unnerved and confused by that declaration.</p><p class="western">“If its any consolation, the beast wasn't dangerous, it barely put up a fight, and it died quick and painless,” the brunet offered 'helpfully'.</p><p class="western">Were these boys muggleborn who had been snapped up before their Hogwarts letter got to them, and trained by some kind of rogue element? She didn't like this, and she could already see Dawlish's face darkening with disbelief – he wasn't buying this, but Tonks had been at Hogwarts with <em>Charlie Weasley</em>, that guy could lie his way out of Azkaban with a straight face and nothing but his own cast iron bollocks in hand. She could tell when she was being lied to.</p><p class="western">“Where are your parents?” she found herself demanding suspiciously.</p><p class="western">“Unknown, likely dead,” Closed-Eyes announced flatly.</p><p class="western">“Dead,” Brunet grunted.</p><p class="western">“Dead,” Sunny announced with a concerning degree of intensity (and an undertone of satisfaction that made something uncomfortable turn over in Tonks' gut).</p><p class="western">Fuck.</p><p class="western">“Alright boys, this is how it's going to go,” she announced before Dawlish could open his mouth and ruin what progress she'd made with the three. They'd dropped their shields, they were answering questions, actually <em>talking</em>, which was good. Thankfully Dawlish understood the need for a united front and snapped his mouth shut as she began speaking, gritting his teeth angrily. Die mad about it, Slytherin.</p><p class="western">“You're going to come with us to the Ministry of Magic, we're going to check you over with a healer because, no offence, you look like you've been dragged through a hedge backwards. While that happens, we'll be checking your magical signature against our records to try and find your families.”</p><p class="western">“My only remaining family is my sister, and you won't find her,” brunet interrupted with a grunt and a shrug, “There's no Amicitias' left. Hasn't been since the war.” War? War with Voldemort?</p><p class="western">Closed-Eyes nodded, “My parents likely passed along with Gladio's, and had I any family left, they likely would not have made it out of the Second Burning.” She could taste the capitol letters on that comment, the hell had happened to these boys?</p><p class="western">“Believe me, if I had family left, you wouldn't want them anywhere near,” Sunny stated with grim certainty. Potential Dark Family? If that were the case, how did he not know about muggles or the Laws against magic in public spaces?</p><p class="western">“Either way, we need to check. Procedure. If nothing turns up, then you will become Wards of the Ministry of Magic, and be taken care of, likely enrolled into Hogwarts to teach you to control your magic, and <em>not</em> to endanger the rest of our community by using it recklessly in public,” she added darkly.</p><p class="western">“Is it really such a bad thing? I mean,” Sunny trailed off with a helpless gesture.</p><p class="western">Merlin give her strength, “Yes. Yes it is. How – if the muggle population knew about magic users, the chances of their reaction becoming violent is far too high to be ignored. The last time they knew about us, people got burned at the stake.” Alarmed looks crossed the boys faces and she nodded, “That was before their technology developed to the point where they could erase cities with the push of a button. We would rather not be wiped out, if it's all the same to you. Now. Will you come peacefully?” she asked pointedly.</p><p class="western">The boys glanced to each other, whispering quietly, shaking heads, nodding, and then looking over at her. “We're – there was another one of us. We still need to find him.”</p><p class="western">Tonks nodded slowly, “If he uses magic in any unauthorised locations we should be able to find him. You can issue a description, name, and some other details and have it issued to the papers. Aurors handle missing persons cases as well, if you want to report it, you'll still have to come with us.”</p><p class="western">“Can we bring the cow?” Brunet asked, glancing to where the animal was <em>still</em> cooking.</p><p class="western">Tonks closed her eyes in disbelief.</p><p> </p>
