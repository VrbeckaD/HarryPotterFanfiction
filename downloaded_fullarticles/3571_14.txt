          <div class="userstuff"><p dir="ltr">Adara is seven years old when Regulus is born. Sirius is five, and later she’ll comment bitterly about <em> an heir and a spare and I guess they didn’t try too hard after that</em>, but now her father is placing Regulus in her arms and telling her how to hold his head and he is so <em> small</em>, this little bundle that is her brother.</p><p dir="ltr">When her parents fight, she escapes to his nursery until that isn’t a safe space anymore, and then she takes him and hides in the library. She reads him <em> The Golden Kneazle </em> and <em> The Tale of the Three Brothers </em> and when she runs out of fairy tales she reads him <em> Warding Through the Ages </em> and <em> The Arte of Brewing </em> and anything she can get her hands on. <em> Shields and Countercurses </em> she reads over and over. Her father gets angry, and Sirius isn’t a baby anymore and still not <em> listening </em> and she’s not big enough to hide Regulus and Sirius too.</p><p> </p><p>“Ada,” Regulus calls her as she steps between him and Orion and begs an apology from Sirius with her eyes, because she isn’t big enough yet.</p><p>(<em> she isn’t big enough </em>)</p><p>“Dara,” Sirius flings at her as they yell at each other in the furthest bedroom, Adara screaming everything she can’t tell their parents.</p><p>(<em> she isn’t enough </em>)</p><p>“Adara,” her parents admonish her when she corrects a guest at one of their endless parties about the first step of an alchemical process, the sharpness of their words the only hint of future punishment. “Adara, that’s no way for a lady of House Black to behave.”</p><p>(<em> she isn’t - </em>)</p><p> </p><p>When Adara is nine and Regulus two, she learns to cast a shield spell with an uncle’s cast-off wand.</p><p> </p><p>When Adara is ten and Regulus three, he asks her if she’s going to leave like cousin Andy did.</p><p>“Only for a little bit, Egg,” she whispers, “and not ‘til next year.”</p><p>She starts to sneak into the library at night and find the books she isn’t allowed to read, on the Dark Arts and blood magic and complex rituals. The first one she tries leaves her unconscious until halfway through the next day, awaking to her mother’s acerbic commentary on children who can’t even be bothered to get out of bed in the morning. The second does nothing at all. The third breaks her wand in half, and she’s left panicking in the library until Kreacher tugs on the sleeve of her robe and wordlessly shows her the old wand case in the attic. The twenty-ninth she adjusts, painstakingly, until it seems as safe as she can make it. When she tries it, finally, with her blood as a bond and her brothers as a focus - it’s not perfect. But it’s something.</p><p> </p><p>When Adara is eleven and Regulus four, she holds his hand as they floo in to Platform 9 ¾. She’s in her third-best robes, her own wand strapped to her forearm, and a fixed smile. He has as many wards on him as she could muster and her quiet reassurances in his ear.</p><p>“I’ll write,” she tells her brothers. “Sirius -”</p><p>The pause means <em> take care of Regulus</em>, and <em> please don’t cause trouble </em> and <em> be safe. </em></p><p>“You’ll be back soon, right, Ada?”</p><p>“Just a couple months, and it’ll be Christmas. And maybe the head of Slytherin will let me use the Floo.”</p><p>Their parents turn to them from a conversation with the Flints, and Adara drops Regulus’ hand.</p></div>
