<p>Elphias and I are holed up in a small room at the Leaky Cauldron tonight, our last night on British soil before venturing into the great unknown. Elphias is presently repacking his trunk for a fourth time in order to redistribute the weight of his items for ease of carrying. I suggested that he use an Undetectable Extension Charm on a smaller bag, as I have done, but he does not trust the strength of his magic to hold up to the jolting about of portkey travel. I then offered to do the charm for him, but dear Elphias is a proud young man and is determined to make the trunk work under his own steam.</p>
<p>And so, instead, I am enjoying a butterbeer at the tiny desk in the corner, catching up on some last-minute correspondence and starting this very journal while Elphias’s socks and robes fly about the room in relative chaos. </p>
<p>We are due to take a portkey from the Ministry to Greece shortly after breakfast tomorrow morning. My Aunt Honoria has made arrangements for us to stay with a school friend of hers in Athens before we take a tour of key mythological sites.</p>
<p>I am particularly interested to visit Cithaeron and the Caves of Echo. I have read that Narcissus’s pool outside the larger cave, in which the youth wasted away, was in fact a charmed mirror which showed to him his deepest desire. It sounds like the sort of mythological nonsense which might have some small root in reality, however I cannot find any further reference in my research to a mirror which produces this effect extant in the modern wizarding world.</p>
<p>Ah! I cannot describe the excitement which fills me to finally explore these ideas and theories in person!</p>
<p>I think it is time for a light supper and an early bedtime, though I scarce believe I will be able to sleep for that very excitement which I feel.</p>
