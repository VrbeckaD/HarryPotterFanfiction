  <strong>May 1994</strong>
</p><p>Hermione knocked timidly on the door to the Headmaster’s office. She had the time turner still around her neck and under her shirt. She knew she would have to return it at the end of the term, but there was still a month left. She just hoped she wouldn’t be getting into trouble. She was sure she and Harry had covered their tracks when it came to rescuing Sirius and Buckbeak and she was thinking frantically there must have been something she forgot. Why else would the Headmaster be summoning her?</p><p>The door swung open on well-oiled hinges and Hermione cautiously stepped into the office. “Ah, Miss Granger. So good of you to join me,” Dumbledore said as he gestured for her to come further into the office.</p><p>“Headmaster, I’ve come to return-” Hermione began but was cut off by Albus.</p><p>“The reason I wanted to speak to you, Miss Granger is that something has come to light that could change your circumstances drastically. Please, have a seat,” he gestured to a red velvet chair.</p><p>Hermione, still nervous, couldn't for the life of her think what could change her circumstances so much that would be cause for the Headmaster to summon her. So preoccupied was she that she didn’t see the other person sitting in the shadows of the office quietly sipping at a cup of tea. She took the tea the Headmaster handed to her, but didn’t take a drink, she just played with the cup and sat in silence waiting for the Headmaster to begin speaking.</p><p>After what felt like an eternity, Albus cleared his throat and said, “Tell me, Miss Granger, what do you know of your Grandparents?”</p><p>“Not much, Headmaster. My mother said that she grew up in an orphanage and that Papa’s parents died in a fire when he was at university. Neither one said much about either of their parents. May I ask why?” Hermione said finally taking a sip of her now lukewarm tea. She hid a slight grimace at the mind-boggling sweetness of it and put it back on the desk. “Headmaster, what does this have to do with my circumstances?”</p><p>“I will answer your questions in due time, child. First, let me introduce you to someone that may be able to answer your questions better than I,” Albus said and gestured to someone in the room. </p><p>Hermione turned around and her eyes widened as an elegant figure stood up and approached her. The lady’s black and silver hair was pulled back in a chignon. She wore heavily embroidered silver and black robes that cinched in at the waist but flared out down to the floor. She also had a black lace choker around her swan-like neck. Hermione didn’t know if she should shake her hand or genuflect.</p><p>“Hello, my dear. I’ve waited for years to finally meet you. We have so much to talk about,” the woman said as she stood up and approached Hermione, who continued to sit gobsmacked. “Come, stand up and let me get a good look at you.”</p><p>Hermione let the woman grasp her by the hand and raise her to her feet. Hermione didn’t know what to say, so she just stood there as this stranger continued to inspect her. The woman would make an occasional tsking sound or sigh. Stiffly she turned around in a circle when the woman indicated for her to do so.</p><p>After an interminable amount of time, the woman stepped back and smiled ever so slightly at Hermione. She then waved her hand and the chair she had been sitting in floated up closer to the Headmaster’s desk and she took her seat. She also indicated for Hermione to sit again as well. Hermione slowly sank down, drew in a breath and asked, “I’m sorry, ma’am, but who are you?”</p><p>“So curious, so like your father,” the woman said with that same slight smile. “My dear, my name is Vinda Rosier, surely you know of the Rosier family?”</p><p>“Yes, Rosier is the surname of a pure-blood wizarding family, and one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. They are related to the Black, Lestrange, Malfoy, Mort, Rondeau and Travers families. I read that in a book called “Olim Familiae Wizarding”. I don’t mean to be rude, but what does that have to do with my father?” Hermione asked perplexed.</p><p>“My dear girl, It has <em>everything </em>to do with your father. I’m your father’s mother, your Grandmother.”</p><p>The silence was deafening. Hermione could hear the blood pounding in her head. It couldn’t be true! She began to hyperventilate exclaiming, “W-what?! No! That can’t be, Papa said that his parents both died in a fire while he was at university. Besides, my father is a muggle, both my parents are. I’m a muggle-born!” Hermione was by this time shaking in denial. Was her entire life a lie? Why would her parents lie to her? Did this mean that she was, in fact, a half-blood? She had so many questions she didn’t know where to begin. </p><p>“I have something that will answer a lot of your questions, my dear. I would also like to offer you the opportunity to spend the summer with me at the Rosier Manse in France. I can tell you more about your father and Grandfather.”</p><p>“I- that is a very generous offer ma’am. But I think I need to speak to my parents about this and get their side of the story. I’m so terribly confused. Why would they hide this from me?” Hermione almost whined, her thoughts still spinning like a cat 5 hurricane. She failed to notice that slight tightening of her Grandmother’s lips at needing to speak to her parents.</p><p>No, Vinda didn’t approve of her son and his wife raising their child in the muggle world. She shared many of the same beliefs as her beloved Gellert, but one thing that she felt that was vastly different about muggles was that muggles were, in fact, inferior to magical families. No, she really couldn’t care less about them. They were like house-elves to her. Neither to be seen or heard unless requested and most of the time not even then. They scurried around like cockroaches, polluting the earth and not caring about the damage left behind.</p><p>Vinda’s eyes cut over the Albus Dumbledore and wondered if he suspected Hermione’s full pedigree. She, Gellert and Albus had, at one point been extremely close. So close that they had almost formed a triad. But Albus had wanted Gellert all to himself. And then there was that awful duel that took the life of sweet Ariana.</p><p>In all likelihood, Albus knew exactly who Hermione was descended from and he would try to use it to his advantage. She needed to establish her own influence upon her Granddaughter before he tried to manipulate her into his ideal of the ‘Greater Good’. How her Granddaughter managed to get sorted into Gryffindor, Vinda didn’t know. Though she’d always felt that sorting children so early and trying to force them into a certain mold was archaic. Children are meant to grow and change, not be forced into someone else’s ideal. But that didn’t necessarily stop Vinda from wanting to exert some influence over her Granddaughter.  She would neither confirm nor deny Hermione’s pedigree to him. </p><p>Brushing her elegant hand down her embroidered robes, Vinda let Hermione settle before she spoke again. This also gave her time to observe the calculating look that Albus was giving Hermione, he was always easy to read, even without her use of Legilimency. Folding her hands in her lap she looked at Hermione who looked slightly pale, her face pinched with worry. She spoke in a softer cadence offering Hermione a reassuring look, “My dear, I know this must be awfully confusing, and it was just sheer luck I was able to find your father and when I learned of you, I just had to meet you without interference. I’ve made arrangements with Albus to take you to Gringotts to open your vault and for you to get the inheritance that is rightfully yours. You’re a...Rosier, my dear, part of the Sacred twenty-eight and that will hold weight in this world.” </p><p>Hermione’s eyes were wide as she looked at Professor Dumbledore for his denial of what this woman said, but found nothing except a concerned albeit thoughtful look as he met her eyes. She knew that he wouldn’t put her in a dangerous situation, he seemed to know this woman by the way he looked at her with familiarity. Swallowing the lump that had formed in her throat, Hermione squared her shoulders and nodded her head in assent. If she wanted the answers to her questions she would have to wrap her Gryffindor courage around herself and soldier on. Having her parents come to Hogwarts was out of the question, for muggles weren’t allowed on these magical grounds. But, then again were her parents really muggles? According to this virtual stranger sitting next to her, her father was a pure-blood wizard.</p><p>Professor Dumbledore stood and rounded his desk offering his hand to Hermione, “Your Professors all know you’ll be absent from classes and Minerva is aware you may be out past curfew,” his eyes twinkled slightly as he caught her distressed look when he mentioned her classes. “I’m sure Harry will take excellent notes for you in your stead, I’ll speak to him when you leave letting him know where you are.” </p><p>Hermione wanted to snort at the mere thought of Harry taking notes on <em>anything </em>but the gravity of the situation crashed into her causing her breath to get caught in her throat, “Thank you, Professor,” she whispered as she was led to the floo. </p><p>Dumbledore watched the green flames disappear and sat heavily in his chair. There was a war coming and Hermione was going to be an important piece to win it. He knew the way Harry depended on Hermione’s intelligence and Albus depended on her to <em> herd </em>Harry and young Mr. Weasley in the right direction. He needed her for the upcoming conflict and the appearance of Vinda had thrown a Hippogriff into his plans. </p><p>Standing he crossed the room and clasped his hands behind his back and peered at the innocuous hat that sat on the shelf, “Why did you sort Miss Granger into Gryffindor?” </p><p>The hat quivered slightly before it spoke, “Because she asked me to,” the hat simply said, the fabric folds moving to make it appear as if it was pursing its ‘lips’. </p><p>Albus stood and stroked his beard for a moment studying the hat. It was true that anyone could <em>request </em>a particular house. He wondered…”Where would you have placed her?” </p><p>The dusty hat rumbled a laugh, “Although she has traits from all houses, it would have been Slytherin, of course. She’s destined for great things, greater than you can imagine,” the hat paused for a moment and shifted on its shelf as if it was leaning towards Albus to impart a great secret, “She’ll be a force of nature when it’s all said and done.” </p><p>With that, the hat quivered once more, its folds shifting back to its resting state ending their conversation. Albus’ thoughts turned pensive as he sat behind his desk in his chair and leaned back, his hand still stroking his beard. The quiet ticking and whirling of the gadgets in the room were the only sounds that could be heard as he worked on a contingency plan, one where Miss Granger stayed fully in his control. There was a war coming and Riddle would be back, that he was certain. He couldn’t have all his carefully laid out plans for ending Riddle go to waste now that he had all the players exactly where he needed them. </p>
<hr/><p>A crack of apparition sounded throughout Diagon Alley and Hermione leaned against the brick facade of a nearby building. This was her first experience in apparition and it made her feel slightly ill. After a few moments when she was recovered enough, Hermione took in where she was. Gringotts facade glinted in the sun as Vinda grasped her hand and led Hermione towards their destination. The streets of Diagon Alley only had a handful of witches and wizards doing their shopping, making it easier to navigate the streets. Hermione remained preoccupied with looking around her, she didn’t feel the eyes of her Grandmother assessing her. </p><p>Vinda, looked at Hermione from the corner of her eye as they made their way into the lobby of Gringotts Bank. She had purposely wanted to come early, even though she was quite certain Hermione was her granddaughter she didn’t really want to have to stop and chat with anyone she may have known if they had come later in the day. She had no time for pleasantries nor explanations for anyone. </p><p>It had been years since Vinda had been to the London branch of Gringotts, it was just as she remembered it. The long counters lined up on either side were all occupied with goblins scratching away with their quills in giant ledgers in a fastidious fashion, some pulling wagons filled to the brim with gold and precious gems; but none of that mattered to Vinda. Her heels clicked against the marble floor as she walked towards the end of the row, where the head Goblin was sitting at a raised desk. </p><p>Vinda, still having hold of Hermione by the arm pulled her to stand next to her and looked up at the creature who didn’t acknowledge them, his body was hunched over his parchment, his ears twitching slightly as Vinda cleared her throat delicately. </p><p>The goblin in question paused in his writing, his hand flexing on his quill for a moment before he raised his head and looked down at her. His eyes slid to Hermione and back to her with a bored expression on his face, “Name?” he asked, his voice low and gravelly. </p><p>Vinda sniffed and lifted her chin quite annoyed with the lack of respect, “Vinda Rosier, I have an appointment with Head of Inheritance, Grirx.” </p><p>Looking down the goblin slammed his book shut with a resounding thump and jumped down from his desk, his displeasure evident as he motioned them to follow him. Vinda pursed her lips and without looking at Hermione tugged her along with her as they were led towards a side door and motioned into a small waiting area. The goblin then pointed and grunted, indicating the chairs as he disappeared into one of the many doors that lined the wall. </p><p>It didn’t take long before Grirx emerged from his office, the unknown Golin hobbling away not even looking back as he disappeared from where they came. Grirx motioned them towards his office. Following him into the office with Hermione still in her grasp the door shut with a small click. She released Hermione’s arm smoothing down her robes before she perched on the edge of the chair, her hands folding in her lap. </p><p>“Mrs. Rosier, do you have the key?” Grirx asked after he hefted himself into his chair, his face expectant. </p><p>Vinda placed the ornate key on the desk pushing it with her delicate finger towards the goblin, “As you know two inheritance vaults were set up after my sons were born for their own heirs,” she paused folding her hands in her lap once again, “One of my sons, Evan, as I’m sure you’re well aware is deceased, and my other son was recently...found,” she said carefully looking over at Hermione and back at Grirx.</p><p>“She’ll be the only one who can open that particular vault,” he said as he picked up the key recognizing it, “No other can.” </p><p>Vinda met his eyes and raised an elegant brow at him. This was information she was well aware of. The vaults that she and Gellert had set up for their twins’ heirs were blood locked. Only someone who had <em> his </em> blood flowing through their veins would be able to open the vault. Sure, she could insist on a hereditary test to ensure Hermione was indeed their grandchild, but that would be wasted effort and time. Once she opened that vault, she would be legitimized in the eyes of the wizarding world. </p><p>“Very well,” Grirx said, “Follow me, once Miss Grindelwald opens her vault, we’ll fill out the necessary documents.” </p><p>Hermione’s face paled considerably and opened her mouth either to correct him or ask questions, but Vinda grabbed her hand giving her a gentle squeeze and a small shake of her head as she met Hermione’s eyes. </p><p>Hermione snapped her mouth shut, her lips pursed remaining quiet as she allowed Vinda to lead her from the office following the goblin. </p>
<hr/><p>Hermione’s stomach lurched as the cart came to a screeching halt and had to swallow the bile in her throat. The goblin and her <em>grandmother </em>left the cart with ease but Hermione remained seated for a moment trying to regain her equilibrium. Things were happening too fast from her to process everything properly. </p><p>“Are you coming, my dear?” Vinda’s voice appeared next to her. </p><p>Hermione wrenched her hands off of the bar and shook them as she stood trying to work the blood back to her fingertips. She looked at Vinda as she carefully stepped out of the cart and waited next to her. </p><p>Vinda looped her arm through Hermione’s as the sconces that lined the dark hall flared to life as they followed Grirx. This gave Hermione ample time to look around feigning interest in what was around her. She was trying desperately to remain calm and take in every detail of this trip so she could, she was sure, over-analyze it later when she returned to Hogwarts. Vinda’s voice was a small buzz next to her as she thought about the implications that her parents had lied to her. When the Goblin had called her Grindelwald her heart skipped a beat. She knew that name and what he was. </p><p>Hermione was startled when Vinda’s fingers threaded through hers pulling her towards a large ornate metal door. She swallowed thickly as the goblin inserted the key and turned to her, his large eyes studying her as Vinda gently pushed her forward. </p><p>“Place your hand there, in the middle of that emblem,” Girix nodded at the door where a large emblem was inlaid. The emblem was a triangle with a circle in the middle, a long line from the top of the pyramid to the bottom bisecting it. She had seen it somewhere before, but couldn’t recall where. </p><p>Hermione let out her breath slowly as she raised her hand and placed her palm flat against the door. The metal hummed against her palm, and felt...warm, the magic raised to meet her own. She winced as something pinched her right index finger, but she remained steadfast. </p><p>There was a pregnant pause when nothing happened and Hermione’s heart leapt for joy. She knew her parents wouldn’t have lied to her about something so significant. They knew she had trouble at Hogwarts due to her blood status. She’d told them about the many incidents with Malfoy and how some of the other students also called her that name. <em> Mudblood. </em>Of course, she hated being called that dreadful moniker, but she was too proud of who she was to let it outwardly bother her. She may be a muggleborn, but she was just as brilliant as her counterparts who were Purebloods, if not more so. </p><p>Her joy, however, was short-lived when the sound of metal clicking echoed around her. The door hissed and popped open when the last lock was released, opening slightly. Hermione’s lip trembled as the implication that just unfolded hit her. </p><p>Her parents had lied to her. </p><p>She wasn’t a Muggleborn. </p><p>She was one of the sacred twenty-eight and the granddaughter of one of the darkest wizards on record.</p>
