    <p>Severus really couldn't believe he was finally here, in Romania. He had dreaming of doing this or years. He had wanted to do it when he was done with his apprenticeship, but the war had stopped that dream. </p><p>Dumbledore had tried to stop him from going, giving him all kinds of weird potions he needed to be made, even some assignments. He informed the Headmaster after almost fifteen years without a proper holiday, he was taking one. He wasn't delaying it any longer. </p><p>Severus had arrived three days ago. So far he visited the local potion shops, taken a tour of Dracula's castle, visited the interesting market stalls on the muggle and magical sides and now picking some Nightblood Blooms. He wanted to see if he could improve on some of blood and healing potions using it. He was actually hoping to create a healing potion that also provides a blood replenisher, something that many had tried to combine for decades.</p><p>"You know you picked a very bad spot to gather ingredients in." A voice from behind him sounded in the stillness of the night.</p><p>Severus froze, he looked up, he was surrounded by vampires. "I meant no offense." He didn't think vampires were in the area. No one mentioned them.</p><p>"Dinner is served." A chuckle from the other vampires made his blood run cold.</p><p>"No! He is mine!" A voice Snape recognized, a voice that belonged to someone he thought dead. A voice that Dumbledore had told him died five years ago in the Battle of Hogwarts. His hand went to his throat. The only reason he was alive was because of the voice he now recognized. </p><p>"Potter?" Severus wasn't sure what was going on, but he didn't want to be responsible for getting the Brat-Who-Lived becoming vampire chow. He didn't need to try and figure out how to get both of them away from the group of vampires. </p><p>"Be quiet." Potter ordered stepping through the circle of vampires. "I claim him as mine." The vampires shifted their stance. Some relaxed, others tensed up. </p><p>"NO! I don't want anything to do with you." What was going on? Why would vampires listen to Potter? A human wizard. He hoped he could pull this off. </p><p>Potter turned, fangs extended, eyes filled with blackness. "Then you will be their dinner. Make your choice."</p><p>Snape was shocked. Potter was a vampire. He looked around, he could see the vampires were waiting for his decision. He was trying to process that Potter was a vampire. Only one way out of this mess. "Yours."</p><p>"He's dinner, I found him first." A vampire standing directly in front of Potter declared. He couldn't see the features clearly, but the vampire was big. Potter had also grown, his shoulders were a lot broader, he was now taller. Potter had a few inches over himself. </p><p>"He's mine." The growl came out of Potter. Severus could see long claws coming out of where Potter's hands should be. He didn't need to see Potter's face to know there would be ridges over the eyes, as well as fangs extended out of his mouth.</p><p>"Children, children, we shouldn't fight over one human, there are plenty." A voice from behind Severus spoke. Severus didn't turn to see who it was.</p><p>"Stuff it, Preacher. I saw him first, he is dinner. I declared it, so it's so."</p><p>"He's agreed to be mine, I claim him as mine, back off Demetrius, or I will kill you here and now." Potter's voice held that steely determination that allowed the boy to keep Severus alive and kill Voldemort.</p><p>"I would like to see you try. Your nothing but a coward." Demetrius laughed. "I'll tell you what, you win, he's yours, I win, he's our dinner."</p><p>You could almost hear the purr of satisfaction as Potter answered. "Deal." Before Severus could process what happened, Potter was holding Demetrius' head as his body hit the ground. "Anyone else?"</p><p>"He's yours." The vampires faded into the night.</p><p>Potter threw the head on the ground and it rolled a bit away. "Come on, let's get you safe before someone else decides you are dinner."</p><p>Severus went to speak, but Potter turned and glared at him. He didn't comment as they walked. </p><p>______________________________________________________</p><p>Severus saw a castle, he hadn't realized was nearby, come into view. Severus followed Potter through a maze of halls, up and down several flights of stairs, to a set of huge, heavy set of engraved oak doors. The doors opened as Potter approached. Potter stopped. </p><p>"Hand." </p><p>Severus held out his hand, he knew Potter was taking some of his blood to allow him entrance through the wards. </p><p>"It will allow you to enter my chambers, the common areas, and the Castle but you won't be able to leave the wards." Potter used one of his fangs to draw Severus' blood. "My saliva will grant you unfettered access to my common rooms and my bedroom." </p><p>"Potter, I'm not sleeping in y-"</p><p>"You are now mine. You have no say." Potter had Severus held up against the left door. Potter's eyes were solid black, the fangs were out. "You obey or you die. There aren't any second chances here until I mark you. Once I mark you, you won't be classified as a free meal."</p><p>Severus was let down. He had a thousand questions he wanted to ask, but his finger was bitten. He felt the magic of the wards accept him. Potter released his hand and entered the huge chamber. Severus was impressed. </p><p>He saw numerous bookcases filled with well-used books, along two of the far walls. There were two fireplaces on each end of the room. There were large pieces of comfortable looking furniture spread around the room. There were several large area rugs. There were tables with stacks of books and parchment on them. </p><p>Potter headed to the far right, there was a smaller version of the oak doors. "This is the kitchen. Call Kreacher or Dobby, they will bring you what you wish to eat or what you require." Potter pointed to a second door. "That is my potion lab, stay out of it. I will arrange for you to have one, but it has to be after you're marked. Right now, you are basically a pet, so don't go anywhere without me. Someone will kill you." </p><p>"So just mark me." Severus wasn't about to let anyone treat him like a pet. </p><p>"I don't have time. I need to leave. I was already leaving when I spotted you. I will be gone a week, at least. Stay safe in here. If you need anything, do not leave, have Kreacher or Dobby get it." Potter looked at the old grandfather clock in the corner, that Severus missed. </p><p>Severus went to reply but Potter was already gone and Kreacher was in front of him. "You hurt him, we hurt you." The elf disappeared.</p>
