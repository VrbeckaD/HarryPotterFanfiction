    <p>There were some things in the world that were always meant to be. Things that were made to be discovered; events that were fated to happen; wars that were destined to be fought; <em>people</em> who were meant to be born.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>And then, there were the mistakes. The things that Fate could not control, and that created infinities of different possibilities, of universes, of <em>futures</em>. It was what humans would call the Butterfly Effect. A simple event that Fate couldn’t control would lead to a change in the timeline; a change which could be unimportant just as it could be catastrophic just as it could be <em>miraculous</em>.</p>
<p>Severus Snape had always been fated to become a Death Eater, and Lily Potter had always been born to drift away from him. Fate had controlled Albus Dumbledore’s path, and Tom Riddle’s descent into madness, and so much more. What It hadn’t been able to control, however, was Melody Goldstein.</p>
<p>There was a world in which Melody died at the age of two, leaving behind a devastated family who would eventually fall to the dark. And another in which her mother miscarried, and she never got a chance to exist outside of the woman’s heart. Another in which she was alive, but stayed far away from the war, far away from anything that could hurt her. Many in which she was a coward, and many others in which she fought for those she loved.</p>
<p>Melody was an unknown factor that changed everything. There was a world in which she had been charmed by the Dark Lord and gave up her soul for power, one where she died in battle for the Light, and another where she had been sent to Ilvermorny with her brother, tucked away in a blanket of safety.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>And then, there was this world. A world in which Melody was alive and in Hogwarts. A world in which she fell in love with a man only to turn away from him when he needed her most. A world in which her family’s hold on her was too strong for her to ignore. A world in which she laughed and knew joy, but let her ambition get in the way of her happiness.</p>
<p>And in this world, she took Severus Snape’s hand and went to Hogsmeade with him. She kissed him, held him, and daydreamed about the day when they would be married. She let him take her heart, her virginity, and everything that she could give.</p>
<p>However, in this world, Melody was a coward. And when she was given the choice between a hard life with the man she loved or a simple life without him, she left the Death Eater and chose tradition.</p>
<p>So although she had changed a lot of things, Fate got its way, and Severus Snape was left alone, abandoned by the woman he loved and the best friend he had known all of his life. On the 31<sup>st</sup> of October 1981, Lily Potter died, and Severus joined the Hogwarts staff.</p>
<p>Melody Goldstein looked from afar and tried not to cry as she held a screaming child in her arms. Severus Snape locked away his heart and shut everyone out, trying not to break when he heard of his love’s wedding. And Victoria Harmony Snape dreamed about her father, hoping that someday she would finally have him at her side.</p>

<p align="center">
  <em>16<sup>th</sup> of September 1980</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Melody had always thought that her wedding would be a beautiful day; she would wear a stunning dress and traditional robes, and she would be the happiest woman in the world.</p>
<p>The brunette sighed and looked at her reflection in the mirror. She looked miserable; the bags under her eyes were barely concealed by the layers of makeup that she had applied, her skin was paler than it had ever been, and she knew that as soon as she let go of the sink, her hands would be shaking.</p>
<p>At least her outfit was superb, black and deep purple, strands of silver making it sparkle – she told herself that she looked gorgeous, over and over again, but there were tears in her eyes as she whispered it into the empty bathroom.</p>
<p>Someone knocked at the door – third time in twenty minutes – and she knew that she would have to leave soon. In less than an hour, she would be married, and her new life would begin. In less than an hour, her parents would finally be satisfied, and she would officially be stuck in a loveless union.</p>
<p>“Melody,” her mother’s voice called out. She screwed her eyes shut and counted to ten.</p>
<p>“I’m coming, mother,” she responded.</p>
<p>She was too old for her parents to be treating her like a child – she was too <em>young </em>to be getting married.</p>
<p>“She’s crying again, Melody,” her mother continued. She grit her teeth and looked at her <em>beautiful </em>outfit. “You got yourself in this mess; the least you could do is take care of her.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you ask Darius?” the young woman snarked back. “You wanted her to have a father so badly, why not just let <em>him</em> deal with her?”</p>
<p>The silence that followed was answer enough; she was the woman, she was the wife, she was the one who had given birth to a child out of wedlock. Once she was married, everything she did would have to portray her as an exemplary pureblood; it was <em>her </em>duty to take care of the girl.</p>
<p>The thought made her want to cry all over again: she couldn’t even say her daughter’s name. She couldn’t even bring herself to cherish it in the secrecy of her own mind. A part of her wished that the child could have taken her maiden name, or even Darius’ last name, but her parents had been firm; if she knew who the father was, then the child would take his name.</p>
<p>It was the law.</p>
<p>How she hated the law, the tradition. She had finally found her place in life; she had a good job, enough money to leave her family home, a respected name… And then she had to ruin it all by getting pregnant.</p>
<p>It was the price she had to pay for falling in love, her parents said.</p>
<p>“Melody!” her mother hissed from behind the door.</p>
<p>She clenched her fists and walked out, barely looking at the woman who gave birth to her as she headed for the nursery. The room was plain and bare, bigger than necessary, the perfect reflection of purebloods’ whole lives.</p>
<p>Her daughter, as her mother had said, was crying. As usual, her tears were mostly silent – always too quiet, probably remembering Melody’s screams on that second night.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that she didn’t love her. She did; the girl was her flesh and blood, and she was so <em>small</em>, begging to be cared for. But she looked so much like him, with her dark eyes and darker hair, her skin paler than any Goldstein’s had ever been. She saw him in their daughter, and her heart begged her to go back to him.</p>
<p>Her mind was stronger.</p>
<p>“Shh,” she soothed, picking her child up and rocking her gently. “Victoria, shh, you can’t be crying right now. I have to go do something important, and you need to go to sleep. It’ll all be better when you wake up, I promise. We’re going to live here, and it’ll be okay.”</p>
<p>Her words didn’t help – they never did – so with a sigh, Melody started to hum. She had lost her love of music months ago, but Victoria would only fall asleep to the sound of her voice. She had been the same, as a baby. It hurt her even more, to know that even though her daughter looked nothing like her, the two of them were already <em>so</em> similar.</p>
<p>Finally, the crying stopped.</p>
<p>She looked at her child one last time, telling herself that she was doing this for <em>her</em>, before heading outside to find her husband-to-be.</p>
<p>Darius Nott wasn’t a kind man, she didn’t think, but he was wealthy. He had power, influence, a respected name – even more so than her own, in some ways – and no need for an heir. He needed a trophy wife, an excuse to stop the offers, a way to satisfy his parents, and she needed something very similar.</p>
<p>Victoria would be… She would be taken care of.</p>
<p>Melody would be able to finish her apprenticeship – which she had had to put on hold during her pregnancy – and start working as soon as she was a Mistress of her discipline.</p>
<p>She would forget about those years of weakness, those months of pain, and she would move on. Darius would let her live her life as long as she let him live his – she wasn’t foolish, the lack of a fidelity clause in their marriage contract was blatantly obvious.</p>
<p>Nott Manor was big enough for the three of them; too big, big enough that they would hardly have to cross paths if they didn’t wish to do so. It wasn’t the family’s main residence, but Melody had grown up in a townhouse; she couldn’t even begin to imagine what the main manor must have looked like.</p>
<p>Darius looked her up and down appreciatively as she walked down the aisle, and she had to withhold a shudder of revulsion. The Nott brothers were older than her – not her first choice – and known to enjoy the company of women at all times.</p>
<p><em>Stay strong</em>, she told herself, <em>this is the beginning of a better chapter. </em></p>
<p>She ignored the pity in her brother’s eyes, the regret in her grandparents’ gaze, the glee in her mother’s stare. She ignored them all, focusing on the lesser evil. He was cruel, she had heard, but she was smart.</p>
<p><em>Leave him alone, </em>she whispered to herself, <em>and he will do the same.</em></p>
<p>She knew who his friends were, could see it in the way all of their left arms were covered, could feel it in the tense air, could hear it in their words. Death Eaters. They probably knew <em>him</em>. She wondered if Darius had told them about her daughter.</p>
<p><em>Chin up, Melody, </em>she steeled herself, taking Darius’ hand in hers, <em>there was nothing else to do</em>.</p>
<p>A thin smile, a tight grip on her wrist, and her life began again (ended, ended, <em>ended</em>).</p>
