<p>“Don’t worry Draco. We’ll get it sorted.” Harry reassured his entirely reasonable husband in the crowded arrival’s lounge.</p>
<p>“Sorted? SORTED?! How did it get lost in the first place?! It was put on the same plane as us, clearly labelled, so how can it go somewhere else?!” Draco’s voice became unfortunately louder.</p>
<p>“These things happen darling.”  Harry gulped as the blonde’s fiery eyes were set upon him.</p>
<p>“This is all your fault Potter! You made us go visit Granger in Australia on this blasted muggle contraption, Mr Portkeys-Make-Me-Violently-Ill! Now the damn idiots have lost my suitcase!” </p>
<p>The brunette bravely tried to placate once more, “I’m sorry Draco, we will replace everything of course.”</p>
<p>“Replace?! You think my mother’s elf-woven handkerchief can be replaced? My grandfather’s tomes of  research? Portraits of my great-great aunt and uncle? My childhood vanity mirror…”</p>
<p>“Why did you bring those on holiday with you?” Harry began. Fortunately, before Draco could answer, a guard approached warily. </p>
<p>“Excuse me, sirs. We found your luggage, it seems there had been unusual activity that needed investigating further.”</p>
<p>Harry could only shoot Draco a look.</p></div>
