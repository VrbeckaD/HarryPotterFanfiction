    <p>Harry had come to the conclusion that somebody must be laughing at him. He had been very patient this summer; he didn’t attack Dudley or his friends, he didn’t talk back to his Aunt, and he didn’t do anything even remotely disrespectful to his Uncle. And yet, here he was.</p>
<p>He was on the ground in fetal position as his uncle kicked the crap out of his staved body. He was having trouble breathing, no doubt his ribs had broken and pierced something. There were bits of carpet burn that he could feel from having this skin rubbed raw against it earlier and it was sticking to the open wound on his upper leg. He couldn't feel his toes, which was probably not a good sign.</p>
<p>“You’re nothing, worthless! No one is coming to save you; your freaks aren’t going to ever push you into my home again! You're going to die and I'm going to laugh.” His uncle tried to sound menacing, and from a perspective that wasn’t Harry’s, he supposed he did. The tone made Harry want to rip his tongue out. The rage was a warm star under his heart, keeping his blood thrumming through him and his magic flowing through him.</p>
<p>He had no doubt that if he didn't have magic in him, he would be dead already.</p>
<p>He thought he heard his aunt scream, thought he saw an enraged Sirius Black crash through the doors, wand at the ready…still, he was positive that he saw nothing but darkness afterwards.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>The Order Headquarters was quiet. Currently, Lucius and Draco Malfoy were being questioned in the other room, while Hermione and Ron stayed close by. The twins and Ginny were asleep, which was understandable, as it was very early in the morning.</p>
<p>The father and son had been brought in by Severus Snape, who claimed the Dark Lord tried to kill them. Thus, a mini-trial was being held. From what they could hear – or rather, not hear – it was going well; the two teens heard the whole beginning of the improvised trial. They had to admit, it sounded to them, at least, that Draco Malfoy was telling the truth. They couldn’t read his father quite as well, but that wasn’t the topic of tonight’s discussion.</p>
<p>From where Hermione was curled with her head pillowed on Ron’s lap – his hands running through her hair – she looked up at him, speaking softly in Korean. Both knew that none of the Order members knew that particular language.</p>
<p>“Seems Harry was right again. <em>A change will come about involving Draco Malfoy. </em>Damn, that’s just not fair.” Harry had predicted last year that something like this would happen, and after four years of friendship, the two were convinced that Harry was a better Seer than their divination professor.</p>
<p>They talked about this and that, digressing off topic before returning to it. They finally decided that they would treat the younger Malfoy based on how he treated them from this day forward. If he was hostile towards them after this, then they'd go off of that.</p>
<p>“We really should look at Harry’s letter. We keep getting interrupted.” Ron said, waving the parchment in question as he spoke. Hermione moved so she was leaning against his shoulder, both of them holding an end of the parchment as they unraveled it.</p>
<p>“There is no ‘dear’…doesn’t use anybody’s name, ‘you guys, you people’…the content isn’t like Harry at all.” Ron was alarmed now. He looked at Hermione, who grabbed the letter from him as she stood up to pace. She always thought better on the move.</p>
<p>“Rigid, not flowing…messy, not sloppy…This wasn’t written by Harry. Any amateur could see that – we really <em>should</em> have read this sooner.” Hermione said hotly.</p>
<p>“Go upstairs and get those rings.” Last year, when Hermione had bought some muggle mood rings for the trio, she and Ron had charmed both of theirs to show what physical/mental shape Harry was in. It didn't work for a lot – honestly, the most it did was give them the ability to check if his heart was beating at a normal rate – but it gave them peace of mind. Under normal circumstances, the rings were translucent.</p>
<p>(When the portkey had taken Harry and Cedric during the third task, the rings had been useless because Harry hadn't been wearing his. It wasn't until the end of the year, when Harry would be locked away at the Dursleys, that Hermione and Ron managed to talk Harry into wearing and keeping it on for the summer. She never wanted to be in a position where she didn't know if Harry was dead or alive every again.)</p>
<p>Ron retrieved the rings and came back down.</p>
<p>“We have to talk to the Order. Now. The rings are black.” For a full span of two seconds, the two teens simply looked at each other, feeling helpless and child-like. For a full span of two seconds, they were terrified out of their minds. What did it mean that they were black? Did that mean Harry's heart had stopped? Or was it just slowed dangerously? If Harry was <em>dead</em>, would the rings be black or would the charm break to show that?</p>
<p>Hermione threw the door separating them and the Order open with a bang.</p>
<p>“Miss Granger, Mr. Weasley! We are in the middle of a -” Professor McGonagall was abruptly cut off by Ron.</p>
<p>“Harry’s in danger.” The statement seemed to capture everyone’s attention. Hermione explained about the letter and the rings in her calm, yet efficient manner. She told them that she wasn't exactly sure what black meant, but she was sure that her near hysterical voice conveyed her fears. Mrs. Weasley grabbed the younger Malfoy, and kicked out all three of the teens. The door was then slammed shut and warded.</p>
<p>“Is it really that bad?” Malfoy’s voice was soft, yet distantly cold.</p>
<p>“It would make sense for black to mean near death. If he were dead, I feel like the charms would just break, because they'd be without an anchor.” Ron said, hopeful. No one said much after that. A few minutes later, when the Order was leaving to confirm Hermione and Ron’s claims, the three had sat down with a board of Chinese checkers between them.</p>
<p>Almost an hour later, the Order came back and appeared as if ready to commit mass murder. Sirius looked near homicidal, even as tears flowed down his face; Snape shouted for Madam Pomfrey and Professor Dumbledore as he rushed by them. He was holding what could only be Harry's limp body, all his normal glamours and magic gone, leaving his hair a tangled long mess. It was the only part of him that they could make out before they were all shooed out of the way. Madam Pomfrey's magic seemed to slam against the walls of the room as Hermione stood outside the closed door, staring at it as if that alone would make the door open so she could see for himself what the state of her best friend was.</p>
<p>The twins and Ginny came downstairs cautiously, full of questions about the noise, but they were distracted from getting any answers when Molly Weasley started bellowing in another room.</p>
<p>The twins regarded Draco Malfoy for a short moment, clearly decided that there was more important things to be curious about, and turned to Hermione for answers. When she didn't turn to even glance at them, they turned their looks to Ron.</p>
<p>“What happened?” They asked, voices blending into one.</p>
<p>“Hermione and I had reason to believe that Harry was in danger and it was deemed credible. The Order sent some people out about an hour ago to check and they have brought him back. From what we could see, he doesn't look good. Malfoy is here because he and his father are...switching sides? I guess? I know that they were attacked in their house by that old fucker-who-we-do-not-name.” Ron explained</p>
<p>“The Dark Lord murdered my mother.” Malfoy said quietly.</p>
<p>“Oh.” The twins said, clearly not sure what to say to that.</p>
<p>“And Harry? Was Harry attacked by Death Easters?” Ginny asked, clearly not wanting to talk about Malfoy and his problems.</p>
<p>“Doubt it.” Hermione said, finally pulling her gaze away from the door. “It was most likely his relatives.” She finished.</p>
<p>“What.” Ginny did not phrase that as a question, but a hard statement.</p>
<p>“His...what?” Malfoy said in confusion, like the very idea was too much for him to even wrap his mind around. Considering he was the pureblood heir of an old clan, child abuse probably wasn't something he had a lot of reference for, if any. From what Ron knew of his parents, they fussed and spoiled him so much, so that was at least a nice thing to consider.</p>
<p>“How much torture is too much torture? Surely there's an allowable limit?” Ginny asked, twirling her wand absentmindedly. The tip lit up every time it pointed up, not quite a spark but enough to show that she was upset.</p>
<p>“Everything is allowable if you don't get caught.” Malfoy said and Ginny gave him a truly worrying grin.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>“A new dawn, a new hope, a new face.” Ron recited a quote he often heard Harry say. His siblings and Malfoy all gave him blank looks. Hermione took a deep breath and lead the small group to the adults.</p>
<p>Molly Weasley gave them a small, strained smile. All the adults looked exhausted; Sirius still had blood on his clothes from where he had picked Harry up. Lucius Malfoy was writing something with quick, precise movements, his jaw notably tense. Remus was pacing, every now and again he'd pause to growl, and then resume his pacing.</p>
<p>“Harry is stable, finally; we almost lost him when his heart stopped beating. He’s in a coma right now, being fed nutrients through potions. Poppy says he can hear us, so if you want to talk to him you can.” Mrs. Weasley explained, her voice so gentle in a way that made Hermione want to scream. It was the voice she often heard when Harry was unconscious and she and Ron were not – the voice that meant they were being treated with kid gloves, fed only the most hopeful of news.</p>
<p>“What is going to become of the Dursleys?” Ginny asked. Her mother’s eyes hardened and she pursed her lips together. Hermione started to mentally compile her argument, arranging it quickly to hopefully get the honest truth. Next to her, she heard Ron take a breath, no doubt getting ready with his own arguments.</p>
<p>They were both halted when Remus whirled on them, fury rolling off of him in a wave. Hermione was impressed – she didn't think the older man <em>could</em> get angry.</p>
<p>“The Ministry is refusing to do anything about it! They say Harry is a liar and won't accept any evidence! On top of it, they purposely moved his trail date to tomorrow, which he is obviously going to miss, <em>BECAUSE HE'S IN A </em>COMA!” He roared and Sirius finally leaped up and shot a calming spell at Remus, then dragged him away with an apologetic look to everyone.</p>
<p>“They can’t do that! Father, can’t you do something?” Malfoy's voice obviously came as a shock to the remaining adults present.</p>
<p>“I’m trying, Draco, but there’s only so much I can do.”</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Sleep did not come easy that night to one Draco Malfoy. He was frustrated, annoyed, outraged, and absolutely disgusted…on behalf of Harry Potter. He was frustrated because the Ministry was full of heathens that apparently condone severe child abuse. He was annoyed because obviously Albus Dumbledore <b>didn’t give a fuck</b>; as Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot he had a lot of power. Get a popular vote of incompetence and Fudge could be booted from office, then Potter could have political justice. His outrage came from much of the same thing.</p>
<p>It was his disgust that befuddled him. Sure, it was hideous what the muggles did, but what did he care about what happened to the sometimes strange, always annoying boy? They weren't friends, often weren't even friendly except in very rare situations (those usually involved younger students or Draco swallowing his pride and asking Potter for help in schoolwork, in the deep corners of the library where no one can find them) so why the disgust?</p>
<p>Because some muggles harmed a magical child? Because someone was hurt? Because he knew Potter, for all that they often fought, and that was scary?</p>
<p>
  <strike>Because his mother was dead and she would know why he was feeling like this, would help him find the words to make sense of it?</strike>
</p>
<p>He rolled over and closed his eyes, wanting desperately to turn his brain off.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>A soft, light giggle bounced into his hearing. He opened his eyes, ready to growl at whoever had entered his room while he was asleep, then blinked in confusion. He was not in his room…in fact, he wasn’t even in the Order of the Phoenix’s headquarters anymore.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>He was in a field of flowers near a babbling brook with what looked like moonlight streaming down. The flowers were all sorts of colors, even some colors that should not have been on flowers, like blue-violet. A strange color that looked like a mix between black, yellow, and pink was also present on these flowers. </em>
</p>
<p>“<em>That combination should not be possible.” He muttered to himself. </em></p>
<p>“<em>Why not?” A gentle, almost feminine, voice asked from what sounded like right behind him. Draco turned and was met with Harry Potter’s curious face. The boy's hair was unbound and cascaded down his back, his eyes weren't hidden behind hideous spectacles, and from this close Draco could almost count the other's eyelashes. The boy before him was beautiful, unbroken, and free of the often oppressive magic he usually wore at school. His face was angled in a softer way than what Draco was used to, his cheekbones not as prominent and his ears barely peaking out from the dark strands of his hair. </em></p>
<p>“<em>When did you get there? Where are we anyway?” He ignoring Potter’s question to ask a few of his own, backing away from the other boy as he spoke. Potter laughed again, the sound sending goose flesh up his arms. </em></p>
<p>“<em>Limbo. The space between living and dying. Where did you think we were?” </em></p>
<p>“<em>Why are we here?” Draco asked, not even attempting to answer Potter's almost childish question.</em></p>
<p>“<em>I’m here because I have no choice. You’re here because you want to be here.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>I don’t want to be here.” Draco denied, taking a chance to look around himself. The field stretched on as far as he could see and this had to be a dream. </em></p>
<p>“<em>You wouldn’t be here if you didn’t want to be; you’re not dying.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Neither are you; they stabilized you!”</em></p>
<p>“<em>They stabilized my body.” Potter said and folded himself down to sit among the flowers. Potter wasn't looking at him, was looking down as he picked flowers, but for some reason Draco felt like they were in Hogwarts, wands out and ready to curse each other.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Why word it that way?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>I am me. A body can be in perfect health, but that soul might not be in there. They stabilized my body, but I am not free to go to it yet.” Potter started to weave the flowers into a circlet, the stems bending together and the flowers overlapping against each other. Draco took a breath and squatted down, so he wasn't towering over Potter, feeling as if this conversation was getting away from him.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Why not?” </em></p>
<p>“<em>I’m not healed. Thanatos wants me here.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>The Personification of Death?” Draco asked incredulously. </em></p>
<p>“<em>The Demi-god of Death. The first person to serve Death.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Demi-god?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Halfling. Half god. Thanatos was a human; he fell in love with Hades and became a half god: thus, Demi-god.” Potter explained this as if he was explaining a basic arithmancy equation. It was as baffling as it was annoying. </em></p>
<p>“<em>But…he’s the personification of Death.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Yes. Not Death itself.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Oh.”</em></p>
<p>
  <em>Potter giggled again and put the circlet of flowers upon his head. The bright flowers stood out on his hair and something about the image seemed familiar, like a lullaby he knew by cadence but not words. </em>
</p>
<p>“<em>You sound like a girl, Potter.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>So?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>You’re a guy.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Your point?” Draco blinked. What was his point? Did it really matter which gender Potter acted as?</em></p>
<p>“<em>I don’t know.” He admitted.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>They lapsed into comfortable silence. </em>
</p>
<p>“<em>Why are you being so civil?” Of course it was Draco that broke the silence.</em></p>
<p>“<em>You’re normally the one who is nasty. My friends aren’t here for you to insult, so there is no reason to be nasty to you.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>But I’ve insulted you by yourself tons of times.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>By insulting my friends. I don’t care if you insult me. I insult you too, sometimes, it doesn't really bother me.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Oh.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>You’re waking up.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>So, I am dreaming?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>No.”</em></p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco woke up with a yawn, sitting up in his bed. He was in the room he feel asleep in, with no signs that he had been anywhere. He felt…nice; like all his frustration and annoyance from yesterday was gone. Who knew he’d feel so…nice…from talking to Potter?</p>
<p>Wasn’t there a better word than “nice”?</p>
