    <p> </p><p>Draco ran into his bedroom before quickly working his way under his covers as he smiled brightly at his parents.</p><p>Narcissa smiled at the boy as she sat on the bed, her hand coming up to brush Draco’s hair out of his eyes. “What story would you like to hear?” her gentle voice a comfort for Draco.</p><p>Draco opened his mouth to answer but stopped as his father walked in his room. His father never entered his room unless it was his turn to read the bedtime story.</p><p>“Dear?” Narcissa asked, her tone soft as she moved to watch him walk and sit down next to Draco.</p><p>Lucius nodded his head to her before his attention was firmly on Draco. “Perhaps a tale of our bloodline before we became Malfoys.” Lucius stated as he showed Draco a black leather bound book that looked ancient and brittle.</p><p>Biting back a groan of disappointment, Draco knew that this was not a tale or myth but a history lesson. Purely it was retaliation of Draco skipping his history lessons two days ago to go play at a nearby playground.</p><p>Looking towards his mother, Draco just knew that she was not happy with father by observing her tightly pressed lips as she gazed at father with an emotion Draco could not name.</p><p>“In the early twelfth century, we have Aibell a ruler of a kingdom in Wales. Aibell was recorded as a powerful being that laid waste to armies with her songs, beauty, and a magic harp.” Father droned, and Draco could feel himself falling asleep because history was always and will always be boring. “During a battle, Aibell made a tactical error and was chased away from her kingdom to Italy where she gave birth to her daughter Prudence.” Pausing in his reading, Lucius looked up at Draco to make sure Draco was still paying attention to the history lesson.</p><p>“After giving birth, Aibell disappeared in a mist of green. Prudence, knowing her mother’s reputation changed her name from Prudence Corliss to Desirae Turley. Dreaming of death’s harbinger, she wrapped herself in red cloth and fled to Scotland.”</p><p>Draco hid a yawn as he blinked at his father’s regal figure continued to lecture. “In Scotland she married an influential merchant and bore him a son. On a trip to France her son gained the attention of Lady Malfoy, the two were wed.” Lucius slammed the book shut causing Draco to look up in surprise at the sudden loud noise.</p><p>“Father?” Draco asked as his father stood and quickly pressed a kiss to Draco’s forehead.</p><p>His mother leaned over to press a kiss to Draco’s check before she stood. “It is time for you to sleep.”</p><p>Draco yawned again as he briefly gave his ‘goodnights' to his parents.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Draco wake up with a start. Eyes going to the window Draco blinked at the darkness of the sky. Choking a sound, Draco quickly covered his mouth as he keened loudly. Tears prickly at the corner of his eyes Draco shakily sat up before he clumsily got out of his bed. Walking around the house Draco blinked as it became easier for him to see in the dark, even the darkest corners seemed lighter as Draco continued his idle walk.</p><p>Wondering why it was easier to see, Draco stopped outside of his father’s study. Noticing the light still on, Draco made to move away before he heard his father speaking harsh at someone. Looking through the cracks, Draco’s hand went to cover his mouth as his eyes widened at the sight before him.</p><p>His father sat in his chair as he twirled his wand while a familiar looking man screamed in pain as he withered on the floor.</p><p>Draco took a step back as the man stopped screaming with a wave of his father’s wand. Watching as the man spoke, Draco hastily stepped forward before he placed his ear against the door to hear what the man said better.</p><p>Blinking back more tears, Draco rapidly back pedaled so that his back met the wall as he slid down. He did not hear that, he did not want to hear that. His father admitted to killing, admitted to killing families and torturing for fun.</p><p>A child’s voice quickly cried out and Draco wanted to scream. His father just killed a man because he was bored, he was bored so he killed the man because he could. Looking up sharply as he heard a child crying, Draco keened lowly.</p><p>He had met that man before. It was the father-son pair from the playground, and his father had killed the younger male in front of Dylan the toddler that wanted to play all day with Draco.</p><p>His father waved his wand and the little boy shrieked in pain as he fell to the ground, body convulsing in pain. Not wanting to see anymore, Draco ran.</p><p>He ran past his bedroom, past the kitchen, past the parlor, and into the nearby woods surrounding Malfoy manor. Stopping in the middle of the woods in the most covered parts of the woods that looked horrifying in the day and even more so in the dark, Draco dropped to the ground as he keened loudly.</p><p>In a moment, Draco felt a shift inside him and suddenly he knew. He knew that the little boy younger than him had been murdered by his father, Lucius Malfoy. Feeling as if he was about to throw up, Draco opened his mouth to gasp. Tears streamed down his face, Draco felt pain in his throat as his soft crying changed to releasing a loud and terrifying shriek.</p><p>His shriek didn’t stop as it became louder that the air around him vibrated and trees rustled. Any animals in the nearby area fled as Draco’s shriek continued. Then suddenly everything went silent, Draco had passed out on the cold damp ground of the woods.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Draco awoke again, the air was lighter and the sky was brighter. He was warm even the floor of the forest was damp with the morning dew and the wind was chilly even though Draco sometimes got huffs of hot air on the back of his neck. Actually, his entire back felt unusually hot even with the pulsating-</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Draco feeling dread slowly turned around to face what was near his back. Bright orange eyes peered out through a deep rough shaggy white fur. Swallowing a yelp, Draco shuffled away quickly, making sure to keep eye contact. Biting back a yell, Draco’s hand slipping on a wet patch of leaves making his wrist bend in an unnatural way. Falling on his back Draco cradled his wrist, the large ball of shaggy fur silently moved forward as it sniffed Draco’s hair.</p><p>‘Are you okay?’ in a neck breaking quickness, Draco lifted his head to stare at the creature across from him.</p><p>“D-did you- Did you just speak?” Draco asked as he slowly sat up, careful of his injured wrist.</p><p>Orange eyes blinked at Draco as it too appeared to sit back. Not that it made any difference the beast still towered over Draco by a lot. ‘You can hear me? Understand me?’ the oddly shaped ball asked.</p><p>“Y-yeah.” Draco nodded his head as he stuttered. “Um you’re not going to eat me are you? I’m just five and I don’t have a lot of meat on me!” he shouted, his mind going to all the ways he could die from the beast in front of him.</p><p>White fur blew gently in the wind as a chuckle was heard from the beast, ‘why would I eat you?’</p><p>“Then why are you here?” Draco asked, his head tilted as he stared into the orange eyes.</p><p>The beast laid down and Draco was suddenly aware that the beast was probably an overgrown dog that hadn’t been groomed. ‘You called me.’</p><p>Draco blinked at that answer. “I did not call you.”</p><p>‘Yes you did, you screamed. So I followed your voice.’ The beast responded with ease as it rolled over on its back.</p><p>Frowning, Draco pouted as he looked up at the beast. “Why did you follow my voice?”</p><p>‘I think because I wanted to protect you.’ The dog-beast rolled over again so that it was laying on its belly.</p><p>Draco heaved a sigh in confusion. “Why would you want to protect me?”</p><p>‘I don’t know but I do feel like I was meant to be here with you’ the dog huffed in defiance.</p><p>Shrugging, Draco frowned in thought of what the beast had just said. “You’re my familiar!” the child shouted in glee. Only strong witches and wizards got familiars after all. His mother always said that he was meant for greatness and his father-</p><p>His father, the man that murdered to relieve his boredom. That thought brought Draco’s joyful mood down a notch as he remembered the boy that was younger than him being tortured and killed. At least his mother is innocent of any crimes from what Draco now knows.</p><p>‘You okay?’ the beast asked, head lowered to get Draco to make eye contact.</p><p>“Help me up.” Draco demanded and the two awkwardly shuffled so that Draco was standing. Walking together, Draco smiled as he spoke to the dog that walked slowly by his side.  </p><p> </p>
