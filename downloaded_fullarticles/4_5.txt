    <p>Harry Potter is doing perfectly fine, thank you very much. Stable job, a nice flat, well, a flat at least, friends who love him. Plus the world hasn’t been destroyed in a huge bloody war! Really, what more could a guy ask for? He has no place to complain, so he doesn’t. He does his job, he saves people, he gets blasted with Ron at the pub, he laughs with Hermione, and he feels fine.</p><p> </p><p>	Harry Potter doesn’t hate his job, that’s just ridiculous. He was meant for it, and it makes him feel useful. He knows he’s actually helping people, and that’s all that matters. Who cares if most of the time he’s bored out of his mind and buried under piles of paperwork? There’s still the realest part of being an Auror, what it’s all about, the action. Throwing his body headfirst into the danger, defending victims, blasting spells left and right. He loves it. </p><p> </p><p>	Which is what he’s trying to remind himself of has he receives a new call to action. He loves it, loves the rush of adrenaline that goes through his veins. That’s what this is, adrenaline. Definitely not dread. He swallows his saliva, grabs his wand and runs off to find Ron. At least they’re still paired up together, a well oiled team. He knows Ron always has his back, hopes he’ll always be able to have Ron’s. And they work very well together, don’t even need to talk to know what the other will do.</p><p>	“Where is the call coming for?” he asks Ron as they apparate.</p><p>	“Uh, you’re not going to like it.” There’s no need for Harry to ask him to elaborate, because they’re already there. And yeah, Harry doesn’t like it.</p><p>	“Fucking Malfoy manor?” </p><p>	“Told you.” Ron looks both apologetic and mocking, which Harry thinks is a pretty impressive feat, before shrugging and walking towards the manor. Harry debates on whether he should just fuck off, leave this one to Ron, but his duty pushes him forward, and it’s with an angry scowl and a heavy heart he enters Malfoy manor. </p><p> </p><p>	He fucking hates the place, hasn’t been there since the war. He remembers the terrible events that transpired there as he walks in, and he can taste blood in his mouth. He knows Malfoy has been hosting charity galas in here, and has been trying fix it, heard about it in the papers. Every time he caught a glance of Malfoy in papers though, he folded them up and threw them in the trash. He doesn’t want to hear about Malfoy, doesn’t care about what he’s doing, doesn’t care about all the good publicity he’s desperately trying to raise.</p><p> </p><p>	And yet here he is, back in Malfoy manor. This better be important. He swears to god, if Malfoy pulled a prank call on the fucking wizarding police, he’s going to lose it. He walks in carefully through the empty rooms. The manor looks good he guesses, still looks like a disgusting display of wealth to him. It also looks empty, which puts him on edge. Ron takes the ground floor, so Harry walks up the marble stairs, tries to calm his nerves.</p><p> </p><p>	He hears noise from one of the bedroom, puts on his invisibility cape and carefully peers in. Malfoy is sitting in the corner of the room, eyes wide with fear, his wrists bound, a nasty bruise forming on his right cheekbone. Someone in a black robe is standing in front of him, their back turned to Harry. Malfoy’s eyes set on Harry, and they grow even wider. His mouth hangs open, and Harry thinks he looks fucking stupid, like a fish out of water. An ugly fish. </p><p> </p><p>	But he is looking right at him. And Harry’s wearing his invisibility cape. So Malfoy must be able to see through invisibility spells, which is convenient in this specific situation, and something Harry wishes he knew in school, because that could have really fucked him up. Malfoy looks at Harry, than at the figure, then back at Harry. He must think Harry is taking too much time to rescue him or something, because he rolls his eyes, the absolute dipshit.</p><p> </p><p>	Still, Harry should probably do something about this home intrusion situation, even if it is Malfoy’s home. He silently casts a disarming spell, then, taking advantage of the hooded figure's surprise, throws himself at them, crashing into the wall. Malfoy screams out, and Harry really wishes he was anywhere else. But this is his job, so he magically bounds the intruder, calls up Ron, and rips their hood off.</p><p> </p><p>	He has no idea who that is. Which, you know, ok, he doesn’t know every criminal by face, but it makes the hood feels a bit anticlimactic. He casts a binding spell on them, right as Ron barges in.</p><p> </p><p>	“You found anyone else in the place?” </p><p>	“No.” Ron replies “Or if someone is here, they can hide from a locating spell and then we’re kind of fucked anyway so.”</p><p>	“Alright, well I think this bugger is the only intruder then. We should take him in.”</p><p> </p><p>	Malfoy clears his throat then, and  as Harry remembers he exists, his mood drops to the floor. </p><p>	“Would any of you beautiful saviors of the humanity kindly take the time to fucking untie the traumatised victim?” HIs voice is high pitched and cold, all sharp edges. God, Harry has not missed those notes since school.</p><p> </p><p>	Harry looks at Ron. “Can we just leave him here? Would anyone care, really?”</p><p>	“If you do that, I will sue your pants off for Auror brutality.” Malfoy yells out from the corner. “ Do not tempt me, I won’t hesitate to take this to court.”</p><p>	“Oh yeah, the magical ex-nazi versus the boy wonder who saved the world, that will go over well for you.” Harry smirks, but he still unties Malfoy with a flick of his wand, because he’s a nice person, and is known to often take higher road.</p><p> </p><p>	Malfoy rubs at his wrists, and he doesn’t reply with an insult or a sarcastic quip. He looks away, actually seems scared. Harry remembers he’s actually an home invasion victim, and tries to put the whole “sworn enemy since he was 11” thing on the back of his mind, and treat him like he would any other victim. It’s hard, but he tries.</p><p> </p><p>	He’s barely seen Malfoy in the 5 years that have passed since the war, only once at his trial, when he testified for him, in passing glances at newspapers, and at galas he was forced to attend he can count on one hand. Each time, they stared at each other uneasy, smiled for the photographs, and desperately tried to make small talk. He even shook his hand once or twice. Water under the bridge and all that. Well no, because Harry pretty much burned the bridge but you know, water. It’s there, there’s a river or something. This metaphor has gotten away from him.</p><p> </p><p>	Anyway, right now, Malfoy isn’t the 11 year old bastard taunting him, or the 22 year old making comments about the canapés. He’s a victim and maybe Harry should put a blanket around his poor traumatised shoulders. He’s not going to, because<br/>
1) he doesn’t have a blanket on hand and<br/>
2) he’s pretty sure Malfoy would burn it before it even grazed him, but he can at least get a medic to look at that bruise, and get the criminal out of his home as quickly as possible.</p><p> </p><p>	So they call renforcement to bring him in, and Harry’s charged with the case, and that means he needs to go back the next day to take Malfoy’s disposition. He tries to argue, asks why Ron can’t do it.</p><p> </p><p>	“Weasley has another case, and he can’t be taken off of it.” replies his boss, head buried in paperwork. She looks up, an eyebrow raised. “What, you can’t take care of it?”</p><p>	“No, no I can. It’s just I.... It’s Malfoy.” </p><p>	She raises her eyebrow higher. Clearly she doesn’t understand how fullproof his argument is.</p><p>	“We had...This whole deadly feud in school? He tried to kill me?”</p><p>	“Yeah, well I don’t have anyone else to assign on this so, you know. Get over it. Don’t let him kill you.”</p><p>	“You really overestimate my ability to talk to this man without trying to assassinate him.” </p><p>	“I’ll ask you again. Can you not do it?”</p><p>	He sighs, puts his head between his arms.<br/>
“No, no, I can do it. I’ll take care of it.”</p><p>	“Good Because, you know, it’s your job Potter.”</p><p>	“I know, I know. Sorry.”</p><p>	“It’s okay. Now get out of my office, I have other things than your weekly breakdown to take care off. </p><p> </p><p>	He steps out of her office and sighs longingly against the closed door. He hopes this will be an open and shut case, because he really doesn’t want to spend any more time than he’s contractually obliged to with Malfoy. Tomorrow ought to be a fun day. At least he’s done with today.</p><p> </p><p>He pops by Ron’s cubicle and asks him if he wants to walk out together. Ron agrees with an happy smile and a nod, picks up a messy pile of paperwork and indiscriminately shoves it in his bag, before putting out his coat and following Harry out. He pops a Bertie Botts bean in his mouth before leaving his office, offers one to Harry, who politely declines. The tall lean ginger loves sweets as much as the goofy 11 year old Harry first met, and that thought always brings a smile to Harry’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>	The smile is gone when he remembers his assignment, and he complains the whole way down. </p><p>	“I can’t believe they assigned it to me. This is gonna go badly, I can feel it. He’s gonna open his stupid mouth and I’m gonna cast a whole fish in it.”</p><p>	“Seems mean to the fish.” Ron’s mocking him, isn’t taking his pain seriously.</p><p>	“Ron Weasley.” He dramatically lays a hand on his heart. “How can you mock my pain like this. This is Malfoy we’re talking about. For all we know he could be plotting to kill me right now! What if this is all part of an evil plan?”</p><p>	Ron just laughs. “Harry, not to defend Malfoy, because I hate the bastard as much as you do, but if he wanted to kill you, don’t you think he could have tried something earlier? Also, “getting assaulted inside one's own house” is kind of a bad start to an assassination plot.”</p><p>	“Yeah well, maybe that’s what he wants us to think.”</p><p>	“Sure Harry. But hey” he slaps an hand on Harry’s shoulder. “I’m sure you can defend yourself right? A big strong auror like you? Versus pallid old Malfoy other there? No competition. Besides, you can tell me all about how terribly it went tomorrow night.”</p><p>	“We’re still on for pub night then?”</p><p>	“Of course, wouldn’t miss it for the world.”</p><p> </p><p>	And then Ron is walking away, whistling a tune, and Harry goes home. He lives in a small muggle flat, close enough to Diagon Alley that he doesn’t have to walk too much to get to work, but far away enough that he doesn’t get constantly recognised. When he was with Ginny, they lived right in the middle of the wizarding neighborhood, and walking around made Harry’s skin crawl. People kept turning around to gawk at him, children pointed at his scars, random strangers would scream out their gratefulness while he was out buying groceries. And, you know, it was fun the first few months, when he was still on that high of having just saved the world and coming back from the dead, but it quickly just became anxiety inducing.</p><p> </p><p>	When Ginny broke up with him, he didn’t want to spend more time than he needed in the wizarding world, so he left her the flat. Everything there reminded him of her, so he barely took any stuff in the move, just his clothes and the essentials. He stayed very sad for a long time, after Ginny broke up with him. He still gets sad, when he thinks too much about it, or when it’s too late, or when he’s already feeling bad about other stuff. It’s like she made a little hole in his heart when she left, and he can’t fill it up with anything, and sadness just keeps leaking out.</p><p> </p><p>	He’s fine, though. He’s doing better now. He got back into the dating scene, has a few more exes to add to his love life. It’s all fine. Ginny is happy too, seems much more accomplished now that she’s dating Luna then when she was with him, and he likes to tell himself that it doesn’t hurt. It does, obviously, but he likes to pretend it doesn’t. </p><p> </p><p>He tried dating witches and wizards, at first. But that was kind of the worst idea, because they all saw him as the chosen one, and if it was easy to find people, no one seemed to see past the perfect world saver varnish. And eventually, that varnish always crumbled, and they left. When he first got over Ginny, he dated a tall dark and handsome guy, a few years older than him, with golden brown eyes, who gave great hugs, and greater compliments. </p><p> </p><p>Harry only panicked a little bit about the whole bisexual thing, having one small breakdown in Hermione’s fireplace at 3 am. (“But no one told me I could also like boys?” “Your education lacked in so many departments I’m honestly not surprised Harry.”) But then Harry had a panic attack in front of him, broke a mug and ended up with blood all over his palms, and the tall pretty boy grew more distant, until he broke up with Harry by owl, insisting on how sorry he was, and how it wasn’t Harry, it was him. Harry knew it was all him though, isn’t that stupid, knows he doesn’t hold up to the savior the wizarding world knows him at.</p><p> </p><p>Then, he got with a cute asian witch, with a round face and deep dimples when she smiled, and dark hair she kept short. He really liked her, thought maybe it could work out, but he barely had the time to settle in a feeling of domesticity before she told him it would never work out, in tears, that she didn’t feel like she could ever be enough for the great Harry Potter.</p><p> </p><p>So then he thought alright, fuck this, I know about pop culture, I thought I was one until i was 11, I can date muggles. But that turned out to be a bust too, because he was always hiding so much from them, and saying he’s a cop isn’t that far from the truth, but it really doesn’t cover it at all either.</p><p> </p><p>But at the time, he didn’t know that, so het got himself into muggle bars, let his body shake out loose and wild on the dancefloor. He drank good old regular non magical alcohol and thought the wizarding world really had a lot of catching up to do on music. The Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears? Come on.</p><p> </p><p>He told people he got his scar from falling on keys as a baby, and they believed him and it was all so easy. He wasn’t seen as something he wasn’t. He was just Harry Potter, a regular old fella. Sometimes, he was Harry, the really good looking fella. Harry, the guy you want to make out with right now on this dancefloor oh god your hair looks so fucking good like that. And that was fun. That’s how he met his third girlfriend, a tall thin university student with long dreadlocks, who made him laugh until he spit his drink through his nose, and who could tie a cherry knot with her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>She looked remorseful when she left him, but she said she felt like he was never truly there, like he was never actually speaking to her. Harry couldn’t exactly deny it, and what could he have told her? “No wait, I only act so distant because I’m a wizard. Here look I can make you levitate!”  So he just watched her leave, and decided that dating maybe wasn’t for him.</p><p> </p><p>He still brought people home, but they never stayed long. He likes to think it’s enough, that he doesn’t need anything more. It’s not, and it’s a constant ache in his chest, but he’s good at pretending. He still misses Ginny so much, tells himself she would have maybe stayed if he wasn’t so fucked up, so stuck inside his own head. He sees her sometimes, because he’s still invited to Weasley family reunions, and he thinks he’ll never have a relationship more fulfilling than what he had with her, thinks maybe he just isn’t deserving of that type of love.</p><p> </p><p>He tries to not think about that, because it just bums it out, and because it isn’t fair. Not to Ginny, not to his friends. So what if he hasn’t been so lucky in the romance department in the past 3 years, he’s still surrounded by love! So much love, in fact, that he still doesn’t think he deserves any of it. He’s certain that one day, they’ll all realise their mistakes and leave him. That’s the childhood trauma for you, he guesses!</p><p> </p><p>And you know, he can make jokes about it or try to rationally tell himself his friends do love him, that they’re grown people who can make their own decision and his 11 year old didn’t somehow trick them all into being his friends but, well, the feeling doesn’t go away that easily. So he goes to the pub nights, he laughs with his friends and he tries to see their love as genuine. Sometimes, he even succeeds, and he feels all warm inside, his heart singing out a happy little tune.</p><p> </p><p>He walks up the stairs to his 5th floor flat (the elevator has been broken since he arrived), and unlocks the door to the studio he’s lived in for the past 3 years. It’s fine. Not anything too spectacular, but it’s fine. It’s enough. There’s a pipe in the bathroom that won’t stop leaking, no matter the fixing spells he throws at it, but he’s learned to live with it, doesn’t have the energy to try harder.</p><p> </p><p>He drops his stuff with a heavy sigh, kicks off his shoes and heads to the cramped kitchen to cook his dinner. He likes cooking. It’s one of the only time of the day his mind actually shuts up. He’s been thinking about this recipe, a mushroom pie, since he got off of work. He whistles as he sets the fire and starts chopping the mushrooms. His fridge is small, but it’s always filled with fresh ingredients. It has to spend 30 minutes in the oven, so Harry tries to clean his flat in the meanwhile.</p><p> </p><p>It shouldn’t be hard, the studio really is small, but Harry gets in these periods where he doesn’t have the energy to do anything after work, and so he sometimes lets the dishes in the sink accumulate, as well as the dust. It’s fine. He pulls up his sleeves, puts on some pop music, and starts by taking everything off the floor. There’s a surprising amount of stuff on it, dirty clothes and papers, mostly. He really needs to do a laundry run soon. Sure, he could vanish the stains away, but he always knows, and he ends up still feeling dirty.</p><p> </p><p>Then the oven dings, and he gets to enjoy his pie. It’s really good, maybe only needs a touch more butter. He makes a mental note of it. He’s eating alone at his small table, when he remembers he has to see Malfoy tomorrow, and his heart drops in his chest. Urgh. Is there still time to quit his job and go live in the forest or some shit? No, no there isn’t. He also needs to interrogate the intruder tomorrow, but that’s far less of a burden on his mind than the prospect of having to talk to Malfoy for half an hour.</p><p> </p><p>He goes to bed with anger and dread pulsating around his heart, and with Malfoy’s stupid fucking bruised face behind his eyelids.</p>
