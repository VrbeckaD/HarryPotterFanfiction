    <p>Hermione couldn’t open her eyes. It was as though someone had glued them shut and she risked ripping her very skin if she tried to have a look at what was going on around her. Her mouth was clamped shut, too, muscles rigid and throbbing after the bouts of torture that Bellatrix had just put her through. The Cruciatus curse’s rements still pulsed through her body, stinging like she had hornets trapped under her skin.</p><p>Bellatrix was holding her up, one arm around her waist, the other holding a short and silver knife to her throat. The same blade that she had used to carve into her skin. Hermione wanted to flinch but she couldn’t move at all.</p><p>“Drop your wands,” Bellatrix whispered. “Drop them, or we’ll see exactly how filthy her blood is!”</p><p>There was a moment of silence. Hermione wished that she could see what was happening...what Ron and Harry were doing. (It must be them, after all. No one else would be frightened into obedience by a threat directed at her, after all.)</p><p>“I said, drop them!” she screeched, pressing the blade into Hermione’s throat: Hermione could feel beads of blood welling up with the faint sting of cut skin. Somehow less painful than the curse that she had endured.</p><p>“All right!” Someone shouted. It sounded like Harry, and there was the clatter of a wand falling to the ground.</p><p>‘No!’ Hermione thought desperately to herself. They couldn’t possibly be so stupid as to give up their weapons for her life.</p><p>But, apparently, they were. Hermione felt Bellatrix’s grip on her tighten as she barked her next orders.</p><p>“Good. Draco, Pick them up! As for you, Harry Potter? The Dark Lord is coming. Your death approaches.”</p><p>Hermione wanted to scream, but her mouth was still clamped shut. No. This couldn’t be it. This couldn’t be the end for them.</p><p>“Cissy,” Bellatrix ordered. “Tie up our little heroes, again. Greyback - take the Mudblood. She’s yours to do with as you wish.”</p><p>Before Hermione could even begin to panic, there was a peculiar grinding noise from above. This finally prompted her to open her eyes. The crystal chandelier trembled from above them. Then, with a creak and an ominous jingling, it fell. Bellatrix shrieked, jumping out of the way with Hermione still tightly held in her grasp.</p><p>The chandelier crashed against the floor with an explosion of crystals and chains. No one in the room was unscathed by the blow. Bellatrix suffered a cut on her cheek, while Hermione could feel that one of her arms was freely bleeding. She saw Draco double over in pain, just as Harry lunged across the room.</p><p>He wrestled all three wands from Draco’s hands with no trouble at all, pointing them at Greyback. Hermione silently cheered as he shouted.</p><p>“STUPEFY!”</p><p>Greyback was thrown up into the air and then smashed into the ground, rendered unconscious.</p><p>Hermione was finally dropped to the ground as Bellatrix brandished her knife, again, looking for the threat. Narcissa was quicker, her wand pointed at the doorway as she pulled Draco into her side to protect him from further injury.</p><p>“DOBBY!” She screamed, causing everyone in the room to freeze in shock. “You! You dropped the chandelier - ?”</p><p>The tiny elf trotted into the room, his shaking finger pointing at his old mistress.</p><p>“You must not hurt Harry Potter!”</p><p>“KILL HIM!” Bellatrix shrieked at her sister. “KILL HIM, CISSY.”</p><p>Before Narcissa could so much as raise her wand to carry out the act, there was a loud ‘crack’ and flew across the room, out of Narcissa’s reach.</p><p>"You dirty little monkey!" bawled Bellatrix. "How dare you take a witch's wand, how dare you defy your masters?"</p><p>"Dobby has no master!" squealed the elf. "Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends."</p><p>Hermione’s gaze shifted to Harry. His face was scrunched up in pain and that could only mean one thing… Voldemort would be there soon.</p><p>Gathering up what strength she had inside of her, Hermione screamed to them both.</p><p>“GO! HARRY, RON, RUN!”</p><p>“Hermione!” Ron shouted, he started in her direction, but Harry grabbed him, holding him back. He stared at Hermione, his green eyes filling with tears. They had talked about this, before Ron came back. What they would do if the other was captured… what they had to do for the good of the Wizarding World.</p><p>“GO!” She screamed again, refusing to let them stay and get themselves killed for her. Ron struggled against Harry’s hold but it was too late. Harry grabbed Dobby, as well, and they vanished on the spot.</p><p>Hermione watched as Bellatrix threw her silver knife at them, but it was too late. They were gone and the knife simply clattered to the floor.</p><p>Bellatrix turned to look at Hermione, her eyes wide and full of rage. She stole the wand from her sister’s hand and pointed it at the girl on the floor, screaming -</p><p>“CRUCIO!”</p><hr/><p>Hermione had no memory of falling unconscious. One moment, she was writhing in agony… and the next, it was over and she was waking up in the dark. She was lying on someone cold and hard...the ground? Her hand twitched at her side, feeling the surface. Concrete. Where was she?</p><p>Groaning with pain, she pushed herself to sit up. It took a few moments for her eyes to adjust to the darkness, but she was able to make out shapes, eventually. This must be the cellar, the thought. Where they had taken Ron and Harry…</p><p>There was an unidentified mass near her, she realized. Something distinctly human looking. Another prisoner? Unconscious and injured just like her? Hermione inched closer, her voice quiet and raspy.</p><p>“H-hello?” She whispered. “Are you okay?”</p><p>The lump didn’t move.</p><p>Hermione was about to inch closer when the door to the cellar suddenly burst open. The light from the stairs was blinding, and Hermione turned her head to save her vision...and was wholly unprepared for the sight that unfolded in front of her.</p><p>The lump on the ground was not another hostage, she realized. It was Peter Pettigrew. His silver hand was at his throat; his own fingers digging into the skin there. There was no question as to whether or not he was dead.</p><p>Hermione retched, skittering back away from the body and her fear was met with horribly familiar laughter.</p><p>“Ickle Muddy has never seen a dead body?” Bellatrix crooned as she stepped into the cellar. She was paler than she had been, before, and her every step looked pained. She’d been tortured, Hermione realized. For letting Harry escape.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Her throat suddenly felt dry. Bellatrix had come to kill her. She was sure of it. She braced herself, waiting for the spell and wondering if it would hurt… but it never came.</p><p>She opened her eyes again, startled to find that Bellatrix was crouched down in front of her. Her dark eyes gazed into Hermione’s, searchingly.</p><p>“The Dark Lord killed Greyback.” She told her, conversationally. “Slaughtered him for failing. I guess you won’t make a present for him after all.”</p><p>Hermione’s heart was pounding in her chest, threatening to break through her breast.</p><p>“The dog would have fucked you bloody and then eaten you alive.” She said, her tone still pleasant. She reached out and brushed the back of her hand against Hermione’s face with a wicked smile. “But now, he’s gone. And what do you think I’m going to do with you?”</p><p>“Kill me?” Hermione asked, her tone braver than she felt.</p><p>Bellatrix just laughed.</p><p>“That would be too easy, little mudblood.” She purred. “I’m not going to kill you, filth. I’m going to break you.”</p><p>She suddenly grabbed Hermione by the collar of her shirt, forcing her to stand.</p><p>“Let’s go get you cleaned up, shall we?” She asked, her voice dangerously sweet.</p><p>Hermione didn’t have a chance to give an answer before she was dragged up the stairs.</p>
