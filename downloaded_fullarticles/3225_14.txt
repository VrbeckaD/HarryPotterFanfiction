  <strong>Silence.</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>That was the loudest noise he’s ever heard.</p><p> </p><p>The large halls of ancient stone, the castle, his parent -<em>friend, carer, companion</em>-, echoed the silence in every brick of its being. Walking –<em>pacing, running, chasing</em>-, through these corridors his whole life, he had memorised every crevice as he imagines one would have memorised the face of their mother <em>–father, friend, sibling, lover</em>-.</p><p> </p><p>At first life was sweet, if a tad bitter, he had never known more- still doesn’t quite. His earliest memories were of staircases moving him towards his desired destination, floating silverware topped with food zooming to and from his laughing mouth, sparks of all colours lighting up the daunting darkness in a light show worthy of a standing ovation. He was never lost, never quite alone. The castle was quite literally everything to him; looking after him and caring so dearly, guiding him, teaching him, healing him, entertaining him.</p><p> </p><p>There was so much to see; the books that floated to him, eager to be read and understood; the rooms filled with abandoned messes of tables, <strong>more books</strong>, papers, black board sketches, notes of conversations passed, some rooms more filled than others…</p><p> </p><p>Even away from the castle, he was cared for. He was sure to never fall over a root and be scratched in the thickets; they more aside and left the grass and softest of leaves to caress and reassure him in his venture. When ever he looked over his shoulder across the grounds, he saw it, the castle, there and waiting. Like a parent, reassuringly always there, always watching and waiting in case it was needed.</p><p> </p><p>He’d walked <strong>every</strong> hall, explored <strong>every</strong> room, read <strong>every</strong> book, flew on <strong>every</strong> broom, slept in <strong>every</strong> bed.</p><p> </p><p>Yes, when he was younger, it was enough. But now he was older. Piece by piece he put an explanation together. The castle could only provide so much. Despite his cries on many nights and his pacing of a certain corridor, it couldn’t say; for all it was, and wonderful as it is, his one companion is still a castle. It had tried, it gave him books and papers and objects of all sorts to help him find the answers he needed. When that didn’t bare enough fruit it tried to distract and side track him. Most attempts were met with a repentant, yet thankful grimace.</p><p> </p><p>The thing was, the castle was empty, physically. The frames on the walls hint at depictions of another time. The messes of spilled ink-pots and ruined beds spoke of hurried exits. The scarring of the castle still too deep for itself to mend spoke of a trauma beyond his comprehension, and apparent living memory. The books were far more useful though.</p><p> </p><p>As he said before, he has read every book. He knows of what once was, or, at least, what must have been. He knows where he must be: Hogwarts. He knows of magic and wizards, witches, society, culture, people, stories. But when? How late was he in joining this wonderful world of human connection? Why is he not a part of it? Where did it go? <strong><em>Why is it not here?! </em></strong></p><p> </p><p>So, he researched. <strong>Every</strong> historic text, <strong>every</strong> birth record, <strong>every</strong> important event- until he found it. He needed to know when it all ended. So, he looked at when every book was published. Every, last one. So devoted and obsessed with his pursuit for an explanation and closure was he, that Hogwarts had to step in a few times and force him to rest and care for his needs. However, as soon as he could he was back to searching. When he found what he was looking for, he was over-joyed! A newspaper, filed -or rather shoved- in amongst the others in the library’s collection, held the date of <strong><em>first of May, 1999!</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>Rushing up the staircases to the seventh floor, he was aided in his flight by the speedy changes of the staircases, preemptively organising themselves in a path to his destination. Once he reached his desired corridor, he paced, desperately hoping to convey his excitement at finding it finally and his terror at what answers this may yield. But, overall he held the need for his question to be answered in his mind: what was the year!?</p><p> </p><p>The doors soon revealed themselves and he rushed inside. Within he was met with innumerable clocks, calendars, watches, newspapers. None gave the answer he so absolutely desired.</p><p> </p><p>There he was left. Fallen to his knees at the evidence of his friend’s desperation to give him this one wish and heal him of this agony. Nevertheless, it wasn’t Hogwarts’ fault, he knew that. If it could it would give him a book, like this room, which could give him every answer to all of his questions, it would have in any one of his heartbeats. With a grateful and understanding smile-<em> if a little shattered</em>-, he got up and exited the room.</p><p> </p><p>The halls once again, never had been quite so depressing. He could <strong>almost</strong> hear the taps of hundreds of feet, racing to class with their friends. He could <strong>almost</strong> hear the voices, laughter, yelling, calling of the children to each other in their conversations, so whimsical, and holding both none and all the meaning in the world at once.</p><p> </p><p>The paintings never had been quite so bare. Some canvases blank and without scenery or object, others with knocked chairs, trampled grass or a complete scene of hurried escape and no thought otherwise. Looking past the once intriguing art, he looked through a window. The sky was a juxtaposition blue, to both him and the state of all under it. The grounds hadn’t escaped the wrath of whatever onslaught met the castle however long a-</p><p> </p><p>So back to that thought it was, ‘however long ago…’</p>
