    <p>Akira arrives at Shibuya’s Scramble looking around for the connecting train leading to Yongen-Jaya, while doing so a Metaverse tear opens up next to where he is standing and a cloud of Desire emerges, latching on to the nearest person who is feeling anything truly negative, such as depression, which happens to be Akira himself. Akira blinks his eyes as the world starts to move from where it had appeared to stop.</p><p>Akira finds his train and heads onto Yongen-Jaya, knowing he’ll have to find Sakura Sojiro’s house somewhere in the backstreets of the place. He eventually does but gets directed to Leblanc.</p><p>A couple of days after finding his new residence, Akira wakes feeling nauseated. He blinks, trying to stand up despite the pounding in his skull. Sojiro offers him coffee and curry, which he’s starting to become accustomed to during the admittedly brief time he’s spent here, but he’s barely able to swallow a few bites before sticking the rest into the fridge for later and pushing the cup away completely.</p><p>“You ok, kid?” Sojiro looks mildly concerned, a rare occurrence for him. </p><p>“Headache,” Akira grits out, trying to remain standing and leaning on the counter to do so.</p><p>Sojiro rushes into the bathroom and grabs a couple tablets of Naproxen before returning and handing them to Akira along with a glass of water. “Drink it and hurry off to school, you should be fine by the time you get there. I’d better not hear you were late.”</p><p>Akira groans, “Yes sir,” before taking the meds and plodding out the door, flipping the sign to open on the way out.</p>
<hr/><p>Akira exits the station grimacing as the rain falls, obscuring the glasses he wears as he’s nearsighted, making it even harder to see. He removes them and tucks them into the breast pocket of his uniform just as someone slams into him from his left side, Causing him to stumble and nearly fall. Grunting, he turns around to anchor a swift glare to whoever wasn’t watching where they were going.</p><p>The person straightens up, revealing messy blond hair, a look of guilt and concern on their face. “Shit, sorry dude! I was trying to stop someone I know from getting into a car with a slimeball.”</p><p>“Obviously it didn't work,” Akira grumbles under his breath as the other male looks at him curiously before kicking at a stray can.</p><p>“Yeah, that bastard teacher!” The short, excitable blond yelled in frustration.</p><p>“Hmm?” Akira makes a curious sound.</p><p>“You don't know him? Don't you go to this school? I'm Sakamoto Ryuji, by the way,” He said, looking mildly embarrassed by his poor manners before he proceeds to investigate Akira.</p><p>“You're that transfer student aren't you? People have been talking about you.”</p><p>Akira rubs his forehead as he suddenly feels dizzy. “Yeah.”</p><p>Ryuji grabs Akira's arm. “Come on, we'd better hurry!” Akira finds himself dragged to school.</p>
<hr/><p>After school, Akira heads back to Leblanc, he can’t think of it as home just yet as he’s only been there for a couple of days. Sojiro hasn’t exactly been accommodating, and he made sure since the day he arrived to let Akira know that he wasn’t truly welcome there, and it’s hard to accept that his parents shipped him off without a second thought to some… Stranger, but he wants to make this work. He has to, he doesn’t have a choice. Damn that man for being so clumsy, and damn himself too for wanting to do the right thing. <i>I guess it doesn’t pay to do the right thing…</i> Akira thinks before he begins coughing, unable to breathe.</p><p>Stumbling, he realizes how thankful he is for the poles on the train. It makes it easier to hide that he’s still shaking, and keeps him from accidentally falling on someone. Luckily, by the time he gets off the train, the dizziness and his headache has eased as well as the sudden coughing fit, making it easy to get back home. Sojiro is there waiting impatiently.</p><p>“Get something to eat then head back upstairs, I’m going to lock up for tonight,” He tells Akira gruffly while muttering to himself about how much a pain in the ass it is to wait for his charge to arrive.</p><p>Akira just nods, quietly memorizing Sojiro’s scent as he leaves, the older man smells of coffee, curry, and cigarettes - an odd, but somehow pleasing scent that makes a part of him purr. Doing as bid, he ignores the faintly tempting raw strips of beef and grabbing the plate beside it. He shuts the door and places the plate on the counter, taking a seat and eating a dinner that tastes off, but he can’t say why. After cleaning his plate and setting it on the rack, Akira heads upstairs to finish his homework before getting ready for bed.</p>
<hr/><p>The next day finds Akira dizzy and weak but he finds enough strength to haul himself out of bed and stumbles down to the bathroom, hugging the toilet bowl. Blood, pieces of last night’s meal, and finally bile mixed with more blood are given to it. Akira tries to get himself in order after looking up and seeing Sojiro as he looks on in worry, Akira didn’t notice the older man opening the door and seeing him in the state he was in.</p><p>“Are you sure you’re going to be able to go to school?” Sojiro asks carefully as Akira looks up at him.</p><p>“Yeah, I’ve no choice, do I?” Akira flushes the toilet and begins to put himself to rights.</p><p>Sojiro rubs the back of his neck. “I suppose not. Head upstairs and get dressed, I’ll have something set out for you when you return.”</p><p>Akira does so and comes back down to see Sojiro setting down a cup of peppermint tea and some toast. He thanks Sojiro and begins to eat, despite the toast tasting like ash in his mouth and the tea isn’t much better. Akira heads off to school with a worried Sojiro staring at his back - is it just him or did it ripple oddly?</p>
<hr/><p>After Akira’s first period, he stops by the bathroom and regurgitates the food he was given that morning. He had wanted to during, but luckily was able to keep his stomach from rebelling, a move his stomach made him pay for as he was barely able to get to a stall before heaving and this time he had to close his eyes as they felt like they were burning. <i>Please tell me I’m dreaming, I can’t be a Phantom, I just can’t… I’m not a monster…</i> He prays desperately, not wanting to face the truth. He opens them to find nothing, he hears water rippling nearby and smells the nauseating scents of piss, blood, and other unappealing things.</p><p>Akira finds the handle to the toilet and flushes it, wincing at the sound before carefully feeling the wall and grimaces at how disgusting it is, he finds the handle and exits the stall. He finds the sink by pure luck and after washing his hands, the soap feels wrong to him, too chemically to his nose and skin. He leaves the bathroom and tries to find the way back to his class, following his own scent.</p><p>The rest of the day passes by agonizingly slow, in between rumors of him being sick and wondering why he even came to school start to spread another mentions his eyes and how they don’t seem to focus properly with the originator wondering if he’s just faking being able to see to begin with, he overhears a conversation where two of his classmates are hoping it’s not contagious. After school, Anne and Ryuji corner him asking what’s wrong. Akira doesn’t answer and instead walks away, heading back to Leblanc. He can’t tell them after all, no one needs to know.</p><p>Sojiro looks up as Akira enters the shop. “I heard you were sick this morning.”</p><p>“It’s nothing, I’m fine.” Akira deflects easily not looking at Sojiro, but Sojiro doesn’t believe it.</p><p>“If you say so…” Sojiro replies doubtfully as Akira climbs the stairs to the attic bedroom, ignoring Sojiro’s offer of food. In the privacy of his room, Akira allows himself to cry uncaring if anyone hears him.</p>
<hr/><p>Sojiro notices on the morning of the 14th that Akira is listless, his eyes are bloodshot, and he’s focusing on his cup of coffee. Sojiro serves him a larger than usual helping of curry seeing as he missed dinner last night.</p><p>“You’d better not pass out while on the train or at school. If you still feel off afterward, we can talk then.” Sojiro tells the younger man sternly before his voice softens at the end.</p><p>Akira just nods, finching at how loud Sojiro’s voice is compared to when he arrived and flips the sign on the way out, feeling that gnawing emptiness that he’s come to be familiar with over the last week or so. Luckily, no one says anything - Akira senses they are too afraid to but can’t say why that fact excites a part of him - but Anne and Ryuji are starting to give him some concerned looks while he pokes at his bento during lunch after noticing he’s been making frequent trips to the bathroom and the rumors that he’s ill that have started because of it.</p><p>After school lets out, Akira heads back to Leblanc and is met by a waiting Sojiro who looks at him carefully. “Any problems?” Sojiro asks him quietly, remembering how Akira had flinched this morning.</p><p>“No more than usual, but I feel tired. I’m just going to head upstairs.” Akira explains softly.</p><p>Sojiro sighs and tosses something at him before beginning to leave. “Here’s a key to this place, there’s a clinic just down the street if you start to feel lightheaded.” </p><p>Before Akira can nod, he’s already gone. He looks down at the key and places it in his bag, zipping it closed once more. He pokes around the fridge looking for something to eat, his stomach cries out as he sees the raw meat there. Akira grabs it, clinging to the hope that Sojiro won’t mind, he’s just so hungry….</p><p>Akira places it on a plate and starts slicing the beef into thin strips, the juice from the meat just making him hungrier. He tosses the knife into the sink after licking the remaining juice from it and begins to gnaw on the strips, it tastes better than he thought it was going to. Akira looks in the fridge hoping for more but finds none, pouting, he rinses the plate and sets it on the side to dry along with the knife before heading to bed, feeling better than he has in days.</p><p>That night Akira dreams he’s looking at himself, but the image has red slitted eyes, claws, feathers for hair, and sharp teeth. Not to mention the wings he can see behind the figure. He wakes up chilled, gasping for air and feeling like his airway is blocked by something. He coughs and his hand comes away sticky with blood. After wiping it on his pajama pants and making a note to hide the stain from Sojiro, he takes hours to get back to sleep. Even then, it’s fitful.</p>
<hr/><p>The next morning after placing the soiled garments in the bottom of his laundry basket and making a note to wash them that night at the laundromat, Akira heads downstairs on weak legs and asks Sojiro for a thermos with tired eyes and a shaky hand before pouring his cup of coffee and then some into it and leaving, not even hearing his calls to come back and clean up the coffee he spilled on the counter. In Shinjuku, he grabs a container of salmon sashimi and devours it quickly before tossing the remains in a nearby trashcan and catching the train to Syujin. It’s not as satisfying as the beef from last night though and Akira shies away from just why that is.</p><p>During school, Akira runs to the bathroom a few times to empty his stomach; nausea getting to him, he looks disgusted at seeing blood and bits of raw meat in the toilet. <i>What a waste of food</i> Akira thinks, just as he retches again. This time, he feels something large in his mouth and he coughs trying to remove it. He’s not sure why, but Akira feels better - like something that needed to be removed was. He flushes without looking down, not seeing the pieces of what looks like bone floating on top.</p><p>He along with the rest of the class sees Shiho on the school’s roof but before she can jump a rift opens behind her and a gust of wind suddenly blows her toward it.</p><p>“No! I have to find her!” Anne cries out, worried.</p><p>After the day ends, Akira heads to Yongen-Jaya but before heading back to Leblanc, he decides to find that doctor Sojiro told him about just so he can say he’d gone and not have Sojiro nag at him because he hadn’t.</p><p>One quick look around later finds Akira at Takemi’s clinic, he enters to be faced with the doctor herself.</p><p>“I'm pretty sure I have a problem, can we talk privately?” Akira requests.</p><p>“Sure, head into the back, I can examine you there.” Takemi remarks.</p><p>Akira does so and sits on the bed.</p><p>“So what’s the problem?” Takemi looks bored.</p><p>Akira looks shifty, before holding his mouth closed in alarm and quickly running outside where he begins to retch once more. Tae sees teeth that are sharper than a human’s in the boy’s mouth.</p><p>Tae looks at the young man in slight pity. “I see, come back inside and sit, I’ll clean up and we can talk about this properly.”</p><p>Akira goes back inside, while Tae whispers something under her breath causing the pile of vomit mixed with blood to vanish like it never was.</p><p>Takemi faces Akira after she enters the back room. “You have to know that there’s no way to cure an infection of this type, your only hope is that when you blossom for the lack of a better term, you are not a danger to the population at large.”</p><p>Akira listens attentively as Takemi continues to speak.</p><p>“Before that day comes I would like to keep notes on what your current physical and mental states are at, And afterward, if you need treatment in any form, my door will always be open. Also, I’ve noticed you’ve been hunching your shoulders a bit, turn around so I can examine your back and take off your blazer and top.”</p><p>“What do I get out of it?” Akira asks while doing so and Tae sees that his skin is stretched taut with something black internally extending from his shoulders all the way down to his lower back, it looks like it’s pressing on his ribs and causing his shoulder blades to jut out more prominently than usual.</p><p>“I have no way to pay you for the exams plus I need to figure out how to pay Sojiro back for...” Akira chokes up.</p><p>“For?” Takemi waits, knowing this is important and the least she can do is listen.</p><p>Akira looks down in shame, a sob in his voice. “I had the beef he uses in his curry. I have nowhere else to go if he kicks me out.”</p><p>Takemi hugs Akira in sympathy. “I know Sojiro, whatever he told you at the beginning was not something he truly meant in the way you’ve taken it. Now, come. I’m sure you’re hungry again. Let’s grab something for you and to take back to him as a peace offering.”</p><p>Takemi leads Akira to the supermarket nearby and they pick up chicken for Sojiro and some salmon for Akira.</p><p>The walk to Leblanc is quiet, Takemi tells Akira to wait while she talks to Sojiro.</p><p>A few minutes pass, Akira overhears his name mentioned several times, as well as other things that he willfully ignores before Takemi calls out, letting Akira know he can enter. Akira does so, looking like a wounded animal before Sojiro places his hand on Akira’s shoulder. “Thank you, doctor; I think I can take it from here.” Tae nods and leaves.</p><p>Sojiro waves Akira to a seat and begins to make him a cup of coffee. “I’ve been thoroughly chastened on my earlier actions towards you, and I’d like to say I’m sorry for the unintentional distress I’ve put you though. Now, finish your dinner and if you need money for food until you can get a job, just ask.” Sojiro heads home.</p><p>Akira looks relieved and does as bid, a sensation of warmth, that’s not from the coffee, in his chest. He rinses out his cup and tosses the package containing the salmon into the trash before heading upstairs to get some sleep, feeling full for the first time in days and forgetting that he needs to do laundry as he faceplants onto the mattress.</p>
<hr/><p>Akira wakes up sore and on his stomach, the same position he fell asleep in last night, his shoulders and back ache for some reason; is it just him or do the stairs look less blurry than yesterday? Akira sees strands of his hair around the bed and feels his head, only to find it fluffier than yesterday. He shrugs, putting that train of thought out of his mind before cleaning up the hair and getting ready for the day. Akira finds out his uniform feels tight around his shoulders along with his skin itching before heading downstairs for his usual cup of coffee and curry. He smiles at Sojiro in thanks, and the older man just shudders.</p><p>“Don’t. You look like you’re about to maul someone when you smile like that.”</p><p>“Oh,” Akira’s face falls. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Akira leaves for school, depressed, and blinks at seeing Kamoshida first thing that morning. <i>ick, a pink speedo? And what’s with the yellow eyes…</i> It fades and Akira is quick to dismiss it as a hallucination as he hurries to his first class of the day.</p><p> During lunch, Akira, Anne, and Ryuji hang out together, chatting aimlessly about their lives.</p><p>After school, Akira heads back to Leblanc and gets started on his homework before heading downstairs and grabbing some of the beef with his name on it. He washes the plate quickly and setting it off to the side so it can dry before getting ready for bed.</p><p>The next morning Akira heads to school like normal, thankful it's a Saturday, when he doesn't see Anne or Ryuji. He sends both a quick text, glad that they had exchanged numbers a week ago. There's no reply, as the day goes on he starts to get even more worried. He overhears Kawakami-sensei talking to someone but he’s not sure who.</p><p>“Takamaki didn’t show up today, neither did Sakamoto for that matter but that’s nothing new.”</p><p>Akira hears the other person reply when he checks his phone once more and shakes his head, blaming the tightness in his throat as worry when he doesn’t see a reply to his constant texts. Frowning, he checks around the school entrance for them, they’re not around. Akira starts panicking after checking the underground mall as well as the arcade - places he knows Anne and Ryuji hang around and decides to check the back alley near the school, he remembers Ryuji mentioning it one day shortly after he transferred in.</p><p>At the alley, Akira feels something off, it makes his fingers itch and it turns into discomfort and then outright pain as the nails on both his hands lengthen into claws. He instinctively raises his right hand and slashes at the air, causing a rift leading into the Metaverse to appear. Akira steps inside to find himself faced with a castle, he walks in only to find Anne and Ryuji hiding behind a pillar with a shadow right behind them as he sees another boxing them in. The one behind them starts to bring its sword down as Akira runs toward them, screaming in fear followed by agonizing pain as he raises his arms to try and block the sword instinctually.</p><p>Anne and Ryuji look on in horror as their friend gains about three feet in a matter of moments followed by him scratching at his skin, strips of it coming away and showing the feathers underneath. His feet grow larger and gain claws, his wings burst out of his back in a spray of blood, bone, and strips of skin that cover Anne and Ryuji as they begin growing and most of his skin being torn away by Akira’s claws as he scratches himself, trying to relieve the itch and is replaced by black feathers. The new phantom looks at the shadows in front of him and tears into them, Anne and Ryuji try to find safety while hearing the tearing of limbs and crunching of bone, hoping that they won’t be next.</p><p>After Akira finishes the shadows off, he settles down in front of Anne and Ryuji and starts to lick the blood off of his feathers, ignoring them. Ryuji inches closer before being held back by Anne.</p><p>“Are you nuts? He’s a phantom!” Anne screams at Ryuji, causing said phantom to look up, wondering where the threat is.</p><p>“But he’s our friend, shouldn’t we try and get close while he’s not inclined to attack?” Ryuji counters as Anne lets go in disgust.</p><p>“Fine, but it he mauls you, it’ll be your own fault.”</p><p>Ryuji edges towards the phantom form of his friend, carefully scratching at a place he can reach when Akira’s tail reaches out towards Anne and snags her before putting her near Ryuji and covering them with his wings, making happy chirping sounds as he begins to walk towards the rift with them in his hands.</p><p>“Come on, we need to get home and you should change back if you can, Akira.” Ryuji points out. “My ma will certainly know I’m missing by now.”</p><p>Akira tilts his head in confusion. “Change?”</p><p>“Yeah, buddy; we can’t take you back in the real world like this. You need to be human, or as human as possible at least.” Ryuji encourages him.</p><p>“I try.” Akira tries to find the memories of being human, but his instincts aren’t helping. After what seems like a long period of time, but is actually only five minutes, he’s able to turn back to a mostly human form, albeit one with small wings, feathers for hair and slitted red eyes not to mention the tail that stubbornly decided to remain. Ryuji looks over at his mostly human, although naked friend and hands Akira his jacket. “Hopefully we can find a clothing store near the school, I don’t relish trying to take him on the train in his condition.”</p><p>Anne muses out loud. “I’m sure there is one. If nothing else, we can duck into the school and grab some of your gym stuff, Ryuji.”</p><p>“Great…” Ryuji sighs. When we come back here, it’ll have to be after we get another set of clothes for this guy and costumes for us along with anything else we need.”</p><p>The three of them walk through the rift that remains open and after not seeing a shop around, sneak a mostly nude Akira into the gym while Ryuji goes to his locker and grabs the clothes there, handing them to Akira while Anne turns her back so Akira can get dressed although he can’t wear the shorts. The three of them go on the train to Shibuya and drag Akira to a clothing store, explaining that he had an accident with the clothes he was wearing and needs new ones but not specifying what the accident was.</p><p>After getting everything Akira needs, including a hat to hide his hair and the small nubs hidden by it as well as a new long coat for his wings as well as the tail, Anne, Ryuji, and Akira split up and head for their respective homes.</p><p>Akira enters Leblanc and heads upstairs, he gets undressed and after cutting a slit into his pajama bottoms carefully to account for his tail and putting them on. He doesn’t care about the top and it would be uncomfortable with his new wings anyway, just getting the pajama pants adjusted was hard enough. He proceeds to flop onto his stomach, he’s found that position more comfortable than anything else, falling asleep immediately.</p>
