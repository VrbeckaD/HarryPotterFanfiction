    <p dir="ltr" align="justify">Recently I have come across a word <em>monachopsis </em>that means relates to the subtle but persistent feeling of being out of place. It’s a neologism, so out of place in a dictionary as the feeling it describes, yet it’s the perfect definition for the first eighteen years of my life, despite the fact it did not exist during those years.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">My parents died when I was barely over one year in a house robbery gone wrong. Ironically, my father, James, was an agent in the MI6 – a fact that to seven years old, had made me think my father to be James Bond, they even shared the same name. My mother, meanwhile, was named Lily and was as beautiful as the flower, if photographs are to be believed. She was a doctor, a goddamn good one. Those tales were told me post-mortem, as I have no remembrance of them. Till this day, I am unable to inform anyone if my parents were right or left-handed, if they drank tea plain or with milk, if they were aggressive or passive drivers, if they were heavy or light sleepers. When I was maid acquainted with the word injustice, that was how I defined it: it was an injustice that my parents appear to be the most exquisite kind of couple, and that I never had the chance to know them.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">After their premature deaths, no one could claim blood ties to me, therefore I was made part of the foster care system. I would need more than the fingers provided by my hands to count the amount of families that have housed my young self. During the following seventeen years, I have had zero to five siblings, I have lived in lavish houses and humble apartments, I frequented public and private schools, and had been addressed in villages, small cities, and big cities. I never had a place to call my own, a guardian to name as mine, or friends to console. For those years my soul couldn’t belong anywhere but under my skin, and my home could be fitted into two bags of clothes and books.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">Perhaps because I did not hold of the ground to bury my roots in, I buried those into the world and in the pages of the books about its history. If only I had known what such passion would lead to, maybe I would have dedicated my time to literature.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">At nineteen years old though, I was free. I had finally obtained my inheritance, a considerable sum that would certainly be useful after my graduation. Indeed, my graduation – as I have just been admitted into a scholarship to prestigious College of Humanities, Social Sciences and Arts of Hogwarts University. For the last two years, I had studied the same subject in Essex University, yet I had obtained glowing recommendations for the second. </p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">Located at the Scottish Highlands, the University of Hogwarts was a forty-minute drive from Edinburgh, Hogwarts was one of the oldest universities of the country, and famous for the Romanesque ruins three miles away the modern buildings, dated back 1680, in Palladian style.  As the train arrived at the village of Hogsmeade, the view of that pile of light stones and columns approached the rail, a dream of promises of belonging to wanderer’s eyes.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">In fact, Hogwarts was just as beautiful inside as outside, large hallways and history seeping in every stone. The dorms were just as enchantingly surprising in its lack of disappointment. Located in the far-eastern complex, three rectangular buildings with a cloister at the middle of each, and spiral staircases at every vertices of its geometry. The room that was assigned to me was illuminated and spacious – two hundred sixty square metre –  with wall-length diamond widows at each side of the bed, painted glass forming the school insignia at the middle of both. The iron bed had beige and the other furniture was a dark wooden wardrobe. </p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">Those first days before September 1<sup>st</sup> were spent on my own company, in a euphoric state of liberty, perusing the books I had acquired with the allowance I had established for myself from my inheritance. My wardrobe was filled by things I purchased around: a bottle of Scottish Single Malt Whiskey, from a distillery thirty-seven miles away from Hogsmeade; a box of Cuban cigars and tea, too much tea. I wandered around the campus, drinking whisky from a teacup (as those were the only available utensils in the dorm kitchen always) or with a cigar in hands, leaving a behind a smoke trail that translated the daze that was my state of mind.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify"> </p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">I had been planning to sign for Roman Empire course, as Julian-Claudian dynasty was a period that held my fascination to its extremes, however when the professor that had been serving as my counsellor, Professor Minerva McGonagall heard that she immediately advised me not to. A stern woman in her fifties, black hair tied imperiously in a bun behind her head, her sudden change of behaviour had been at least unsettling. When I asked why, the woman relented.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“You will be disappointed, I suppose, but there is only one professor assigned to the course, and I am afraid he is rather exclusive in his methods.” In my attempts that reassure her that no exclusive behaviour would make me relent the study of the Rome, she had revealed that the man, Riddle, only accepted students he approved of himself, and that I would never be chosen by him. Disheartened for the moment, or at least unwillingly to put a struggle in front I person I was aware would never yield in her conviction regarding her colleague, I allowed that subject to be silenced, for a moment of course.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">Nevertheless, as I left the office of McGonagall, I remember asking her more on the same subject. “Does that sort of thing happens often here?”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“Pardon me, Mr Potter?” Her clipped tone indicated that despite knowing the subject I referred to, the woman had no eagerness to discuss it. I would not be deterred though, and had no qualms on explaining my reference.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“Of course, there are plenty of difficult teachers at every school. Have a biscuit, Mr Potter. You will find that with such a large collegiate as the one we have, the University of Hogwarts has plenty of eccentricities one must learn to adapt to. I trust your discretion on these.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“Sure.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“Professor Riddle is a special case anyway, he comes from a very wealthy family and refuses to receive his salary – donates it entirely to the university. For that some allowances had been afforded. Notwithstanding, even if you have a deep contemplation for the Imperial period, continuing to pursue the study of it would be a deprivation of the entire academic experience.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">Those harsh words would be forever engraved in my mind. At the time, I thought of them to show the deep envy the faculty in general held for Riddle, even though he was easily one of the most consecrated professors in his field. I was foolish making assumptions during that time, a toddler trying his firsts steps at the hall of a house he didn’t know.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">And it was this foolish self of mine that with an apprehension moulded by McGonagall’s words, made the choice to watch the so-called students of Riddle. They were five, always together and they seemed too different, too fascinating for me. Their group was never present in any parties – and there were many – thrown around the campus, and their postures were impeccable. Three boys and three girls, whose personas nobody knew a fact about but despite of that, there was plenty of gossip available.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">The smallest of the boys (even though he was taller than me) was lithe and silver-haired, pale skin contrasting against the dark tailored overcoats he wore, a strong jaw and his remaining features delicate. He was handsome, there was no doubt but in an ethereal, unattainably cold manner that could never charm one to his presence. His name was Draco Malfoy, and while the fact his family was French was not a secret only later I would discover that his mother came from a family of British astrologists, hence his first name.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify"> The second boy was evidently much closer to Malfoy than the others, and he attended to the title of Blaise Zabini. He was extremely gaudy in his choice of clothing, despite keeping a palette of mostly beiges and browns, he could be found wandering around the campus velvet vest over silk shirts, a mane of dark curls framing his face, dark complexion and a too-easy smirk, his approachable aura deceiving and his eyes with a shine of audacity that one could never tame.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">The tallest of the boys was Ronald Weasley, gangly of frame and covered by freckles against a skin just as pale as his French colleague. His eyes were the bluest I have ever seen, and his lips sported a gentle smile, that translated his good-nature. He always wore grey tweed trousers, and usually tweed jackets although I have come to think of him as one in a jumper light-grey, his nose always smeared be it with ink, chocolate or coffee. He had a sister, Ginevra that also attended Riddle’s classes. I can count in one hand the occasions I have seen her wear skirts (and they were always rather provocative) otherwise she would be found in trousers, flared like bells and of tartan textile – her favourite were the Douglas and the Ramsay tartans, though she wore clan Macqueen very well – and oversized jackets she stole from the boys. She sadly didn’t share his eyes, but her hair was a lush of vivid fire and her face was savvy as her tongue.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">And the last of them would always be Hermione Granger. Beige skin faded by a lack of sun-exposure, mid-length pleated skirts and jumpers that were always covered by a maze of bushy dark hair, dark blue and purple tones. Clicking Mary-Janes. Almond hazel eyes with too large lower and upper lids, thin nose and shaped lips. Her company was always an array of books and she, I heard, was a genius. Her parents taught at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">I was deeply interested by them at the time, even though the word obsessed could never be used. Every time their group was mentioned, I felt myself trying to hear a bit of what was being said, and when they weren’t, I proceeded with my own life. I made myself acquaintance with those that lived in the dorms and shared classes with me, and it was if those that I would come to known the parties in the campus, and tell me which was the best person that could sell booze, spliff, snow and well, everything. They called me friend, but we were not truly, and one Thursday, after leaving the room of a passed out girl with a goodbye kiss and her calling me Willy, I took a train down to Edinburgh where I purchased overcoats, and blazers and partially cashmere jumpers, in my attempts to emulate a group of people I have never known.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">It was the middle of September and I was just as lonely as I have been my whole, my studies were my cause of breath and the time I got between them was sedated by alcohol and smoke. That day, when I returned to campus, I found myself sitting through the piles of books, in the giant library of the university. It was almost empty, for most students at that time should be just getting ready to get high, again.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“No, he couldn’t have been granted the right to become a <em>consul </em>at seventeen. It is very clear, Sulla’s reforms were very clear: the minimum age for patricians was thirty.” The words were enunciated clear, not a care for those who might hear – to be fair, it didn’t seem to exist anyone else there. Indeed, there they were, unapproachable sitting around a coffee table, papers and books thrown around their bodies relaxed in armchairs: Blaise and the siblings. The one that had spoken had been him, Blaise.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“Yes, and that happened fifty-seven years before him. At the Republic<em>. </em>I know what I am saying about my country, Blaise. The rule changed.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">Ginevra’s words had easily made the connection for my Julio-Claudian obsessed brain. I could spot Sulla’s time around 80 BC, which would mean he was referring to something around 23 BC. And a discussion with that heading could only be referring to one particular Roman. “The rule did not change because you wish for it to have. This is history, and you are not an augur.” It was a particular clever retort of Ron, in my particular opinion. One very spirited.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">Immediately I closed the book I was reading, about the Byzantine Empire, and walked to them. “Excuse me?”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">They immediately stopped talking, three heads turning into my direction.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“I believe Velleius Paterculus states in Roman History that Tiberius entered politics under the directions of Augustus, and was made a <em>quaestor</em>.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“Being granted the to stand for election as praetor and consul five years in advance of the age required by law. I told you I would remember it!” Was the self-righteous shout of Ginny, who escaped her armchair in order to peruse the bookshelves.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“I believe the same provisions were made for Drusus.” I completed, a tiny feeling of satisfaction taking over me, for knowing a fact those three special students were unable to remember. That feeling couldn’t last very long however, as I stood around like a sore thumb, unable to leave in my wish to have my wonderings confirmed. When she returned with The Lives of Twelve Caesars and Roman History in hands, I felt relieved by her reappearance.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“It was here the whole time, exactly as I said!” She was euphoric with her winning, and when she turned around to me, threads of hair were glued to her lips, amber eyes filled with enjoyment. “I want to shake your hand, stranger. For allowing me to show up these two.” And she came to hold both my hands, a grin on her face. “Very nice to meet you, yes, yes.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">I was a bit overwhelmed by the sudden attention of them. For two weeks, they had been an object of curiosity of mine, much like a painting you walk across every day, briefly fascinated. At this moment, the vivid duality of colours of my painting had jumped out of its frame, and shook my hand, like a neighbour in the lift after returning from a long trip.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“Blaise Zabini.” Was the second introduction.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“Harry Potter.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“I believe I have already heard the name Potter. Your family is from Devon?” That was Ronald.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“I do not think so.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“Maybe it was Porter then…You know your Rome.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“Some parts of it better than others. I read a lot about the beginning of the empire.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“But you are not studying it.” That was Ginny. “We would know.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“Someone told me that Professor Riddle is rather selective.” At that moment, Draco Malfoy approached the strange group that had been formed at the library, his eyebrows arched to my persona.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“Draco, this Harry Potter. He studies Imperial Rome.” The introduction was made by Zabini, giving the leeway to the blonde analyse my persona and keep its entire face devoid of any impression I may have caused.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“Not here, surely.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“No.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“It was he that reminded us of Augustus nomination of Tiberius as <em>quaestor.</em>”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“Useful. Are you Tiberius scholar?”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“I prefer Claudius.” I remember answering, because in my opinion Pliny the Elder was never more right in calling Tiberius the gloomiest of men.  </p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“I prefer Nero.” Draco had retorted, and if I did know him a bit better, I would have answered ‘you would’.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“And I prefer Caligula.” Blaise continued, without missing a beat. “What does that say about us?”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“That we should leave, before one of you turns this library in a brothel and the other burns it down.” That was the beginning of my admiration for Ginny’s tongue, no doubt.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify"> </p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">I don’t know which part of that meeting had made the thought of becoming Riddle’s student seem possible – perhaps it had only been the touch of my favourite period in Ancient History (even though it had been a Tiberian touch, which in someone else would lead to death by boredom) or perhaps in had been Ginny, rouge of hair and of temper. Yet that idea had been seeded and watered in my mind, and therefore, it bloomed.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">Professor Riddle’s office was adjacent to his classroom, and nobody ever entered there. It was at the top of the eastern wing of the History department main building, which I had heard had been entirely reformulated by Riddle’s donations. The first time I was accepted into this rooms, I was terribly impressed with the marble columns against the wall, the pale blue-greyish walls, the busts and paintings of historical figures – all of them, I would later discover, were truly from the same period the person they portrayed – and the large windows, that allowed all light in and a very dramatic visage of the ruined castle of Hogwarts below a tempestuous sky, feverish autumn colours.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">As a History academic, Tom Riddle certainly lacked the looks for it. At the time of our first meeting, he had lived forty-three years and many months. It was easy to guess who all of his students attempted to emulate, for he was impeccable in style. A rather partial to Italy  when choosing a suit – something he would teach me about himself, and would recommend a British tailor for myself. The man was a true Adonis, had Adonis lived to age past the wild boar. A chiselled slim face, hooded dark eyes, imperious eyebrows, thin lips, straight, refined nose, he was tall and shaped, some spots of silver among the black, all of it gelled in a conservative properness.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">If there is something that crossing paths with Riddle had taught me, were the name of luxury items brands, and the several connotations of it. I have yet to meet someone more obnoxious in his choices when purchasing items for oneself. He used Dunhill fountain pens, for its functional but minimalist design, he drove a Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith for its historicity, he tied Windsor knots in all his ties for the tradition it referred to, Pour Monsieur as a statement of his persona. In a bar, his order would be Scotch and in a social event, Cabernet Sauvignon. It was him that established the scent of Blenheim Bouquet that still can be found around my body, and the small fortune I am bound to spend once I walk inside a restaurant. By this man, I was made a creature of habit (habits I happen to despise) yet his presence by my life continues to be unfaltering as ever.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“And how may I help you?” He drawled, a deep baritone voice. His eyes hovered over my entire form, even though I couldn’t actually see them moving.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“I wish to be your student.” My courage – oh there it was – my fool-hearted courage, that made me sputter wordings that in the next moment would already be turned in regret.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“I see. Well, Mr –”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“Harry. I mean, Potter...Harry Potter.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“Very well, <em>Harry. </em>Naturally, you must have been informed that my classes are all complete. That being said, maybe we could cast aside one these gentlemen –” his hands gestured to the busts that watched us, faces solemn at the prospect of being <em>tossed away</em>. “ – they have, after all, no brains but solid marble. Of course, they are all gentlemen, and in order to not strike their ego, we must dismiss one of them by title. Do you have a suggestion?”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">I remember gazing to those stone faces in overwhelm. None of these had the amount of detrition needed to classify them as belonging to Antiquity, I surely wasn’t able to recognise figures with such dexterity. Yet, the long and plain face of Tocqueville came into my sight, by the grace of my own vision, and I almost breathed in relief. “Maybe France? Or should I address Alexis as America?”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“A good recommendation in fact. I believe I have heard about you. Son of James and Lily Potter, wasn’t it? I believe I have met one relative of your when I was a young man. Fleamont Potter, a big name in the pharmaceutical industry in the sixties and seventies.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">I had known, of course, that Fleamont was the name of grandfather and that he had quite a lot of money, yet until that day I would have been unable to name his profession.  I briefly confirmed my blood relations, substantially unsettled by his interest on my past relations.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“Of course, your own achievements are admirable, indeed. However, before we may proceed there are a few conditions with which you must agree.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“What?”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“You must go to the Registrar’s office tomorrow and request a change of counsellors. It’s my policy to never accept a student unless I am his counsellor as well. You may have already observed that the faculty and I walk not in the same line of thought.” He reached for a pen in one of the drawers of his desk, he wrote a note and delivered it to me. “The Registrars never assigns students to me if they are not requested.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">His handwriting was pedantically sized; in the way one could almost believe him to be an Euclidean theoretician. The lining was surprisingly strong, despite the delicate character of the curvature.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“For the same reason, you should gather some drop-add formularies as well. Other professors are prone to be rather opiated about me in any other class you may attend, which would render those useless.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">And <em>that </em>speech almost rendered me speechless. “I cannot drop all my classes.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“Why not? All the classes I wish for you to be part of will be taught by myself. The administration is not new to this process, I assure you they are unable to make a criticism. We will cover all periods, from antiquity to contemporaneity. If I find you deficient in one I may meet with you outside classes.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“All my classes with one professor?”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“I believe having several teachers is harmful and confusing to young minds. In the same way I believe one ought to aim for knowing one book intimately than fifty superficially. The moderns may disagree with me, yet Plato had, after all, just one teacher.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">Undoubtedly, it was strange the way in which I was lured to such an unbelievable scenario with an infinitesimal amount of doubt about his methods. A meeting of eyes and one arched eyebrow of his was enough for me to be convinced, and in a similar prompt fashion to the one he had showed in taking me as a student, I accepted his terms. </p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify"> </p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">Settling things with the Registrar’s office had been surprisingly simpler than one would have thought; despite the apprehension my former counsellor had showed when I told her of my transference under Riddle’s wing. McGonagall had been barely able to contain her frown when she heard about it.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“You have come to your inheritance recently, haven’t you?” She had asked. I had agreed, a bit overwhelmed by the fact that in a university with over ten thousand students, everyone seemed to know where I came from. She had proceeded to warn me on keeping my pockets close, otherwise I would have no inheritance by the end of my studies.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">The following Monday, I was officially heading for my first class, grey puppytooth trousers and black derbys I had purchased solely for a good impression, and in an attempt to be fitted in their group, and thus fade one particular way among those selected ones. The moment I arrived at the classroom, I saw Ginny, a grin on her face, mischief on her bones.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">“So, you are the new addition. I knew you would come the right moment I saw you.” Her grin was contagious, paper white skin dotted by freckles. “Come for me?”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify"> I remember the warmth of the flush that permanently resided by my cheeks during those days. I remember self-conscious manner I would swift on my feet, and a ducking of head. The girl that I now remember fondly of, in our first interactions would overwhelm me with her physicality. It’s strange to think, how much can one be changed by such a small group of people.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">My first meeting with them had been incredible awkward. I was an intruder, despite the attempts of the Weasleys to cover the apphrension all of them felt for me. For two years (in the case of Draco and Blaise that period could be extended to approach a lifetime) they had the opportunity to assemble their roles and acts in this miniverse  that one Tom Riddle had sculpted and for once, they found among themselves a hostile presence, who they did know nothing about.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">My past was, in some sort of way, known for the world yet my persona had never left any traits behind, lingering ties or scars. I had been a wanderer for all my life, walking past sceneries unable to leave a footprint in the fen. This would be the only time I was able to stop in my path, and glance into the pond that reflected my image.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">I did not like what I saw.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">There is good in all of us, that’s true, and we choose to belief that the acts we made are the exercise of it – however they rarely are, for while the good exist in all of us, neutrality prevails, and in this, specks of darkness can be found. This darkness can be translated into anger, pride, pettiness, luxury; and each of these traits can be found in a wider or narrower range inside of every soul in Earth.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">During that time frame, I learnt that every soul can be nudged to act on their natural sins. I would ask the reader for their understanding and empathy, but that’s not a right of mine. I doubt one will ever read this, anyway.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="right">
  <em>And in closed-eyes, he walks into the pit.</em>
