    <p>
  <span>He should’ve known it was a trap. He was already on to Lupin. Disappearing every full moon, an uncanny aversion to wolfsbane and silver, a strong sense of smell. He knew he was a werewolf, and like a fool be had been baited into following him while he was going to transform by Sirius Black of all people. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When Snape had gone down into the tunnel he expected to catch Lupin with his pants down, well, in the figurative sense. But he was met with barely dressed Gryffindor who looked absolutely mortified and yelled at him to get out of there. Before Severus could even get out a quick jab or even give the other teen a good glare, Lupin started transforming. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He’d never forget the gruesome pop of bones extending into an unnatural shape and the half-human howls of agony that were let out before he was face to face with a snarling werewolf. Snape had always thought he’d die young. Life wasn’t exactly on the up and up for him. If it wasn’t Potter and his gang going too far one day (like today) or his father beating him to death, then he’d get tied up with the Death Eater mess that his friends always preached to him about. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Snape may not have been a Gryffindor and on a bad day he could be a bit of a coward, but if he was going to get mauled to death by the inhuman form of one of his enemies, he’d do so with both eyes open and a stiff upper lip. Despite, his brain telling him it was a stupid idea to literally see his death coming, his eyes pried open to see sharp teeth already gnashing. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Forcing down a whimper he fixed his face into a glare. When he met Salazar Slytherin in the afterlife at least he could tell the founder he went down with a look that would make him proud. The beast let out heavy breaths in his face, the dog breath caressing his cheeks was not doing wonders for his dignified last moment. The iridescent eyes of Lupin found his own glassy ones and they stared into each other.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Come on then you stupid dog! Get it over with!” He yelled. His death had been prolonged enough and if he was going to die, he wasn’t going to give the beast the satisfaction of catching him off guard and striking, “Eat me already!” Snape yelped as the cage of teeth came apart and Lupin’s jaw opened. His only regret would be never being able to hex his father into oblivion like he dreamt about every night he went to bed with bruises. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>What he was expected was a mess of mangled teeth right into his shoulder. Or better yet his neck. At least then he’d be taken out brutally but swiftly and lose blood faster than he felt pain. Instead of all that, he got a wet nose trailing his neck, a soft whine, and a lick on his cheek.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What the fuck?” Snape wasn’t one for language like that, he’d leave those kinds of remarks to the recently foul-mouthed Avery, but it was said in complete surprise as the snarling, teeth gnashing werewolf was now acting like a touched starved puppy. A furry head had made its way under his right hand as Lupin tried to get him to pet him. Not knowing what else to do, Snape let his fingers comb through the wiry fur. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I know you can’t understand me, but aren’t you supposed to be a little more than an oversized lapdog?” Everyone knew what werewolves were supposed to be like. Running through the woods killing any wildlife they come across. Creatures only fueled by instinct with no reasoning. And yet here Lupin was trying to lick closer and closer to his mouth.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No! Bad dog!” Snape scolded pushing his head away. He froze for a moment expected to be bitten or worse, but instead, the creature whined and put his head down in his lap. He moved back until he was propped on a wall, only for Lupin to throw more of himself onto him in an attempt to make him stay put. Looks like he was spending the night in the shack even if the damn thing fell asleep, his life couldn’t get any worse. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Snape! Snape! Oh Merlin, Snape!” Nevermind.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bursting through the tunnel came a dishevelled James Potter, who he knew was most likely expecting to see the torn up remains of one Severus Snape. So imagine his surprise when instead he saw a very much alive and unharmed Snape sitting against the wall with a sleepy werewolf in his lap. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Snape looked up, his mask of indifference putting in overtime since he now had to deal with Potter after hours. The bespectacled teen stood before them with his mouth hanging open. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Snape, you- but Moon- I mean Remus- but he’s- how did you-“</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Can you form a coherent thought before opening your mouth. You sound like you are in the middle of having a stroke.” At his jab, the Gryffindor closed his mouth and his lips went into a firm line. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t know how you calmed him down, but you need to get out of here,” James said walking towards them. As he came within touching range, Lupin’s eyes snapped open and he leapt up growling, stopping James in his tracks. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Looks like you’re the one who needs to go, Potter,” As much as Snape was enjoying the half betrayed half-frightened look on his tormentors face, he did hope that the other teen wouldn’t try and come closer. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Potter then, like he could read Snape’s only good intention his way and sought to crush it, took a purposeful step forward and tried to go around the werewolf. Giving him no chances, Lupin’s growl deepened as his eye trained on James. </span>
</p><hr/>
<p>
  <span>“Hey Moony, it’s me, James. Look Snape needs to go. Thanks for not killing him and all. After he’s back in the castle I’ll come back, okay? So just let me,” as James pulled his hand back fast enough for the momentum to pull him to the floor as the werewolf snapped at it. Seeing his challenger vulnerable, Lupin towered over James snarling and ready to strike. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“NO! Bad dog! Lupin heel! Sit! Stay! I don’t know just leave him alone!” Snape yelled standing up. James’ eyes widened for two reasons. The first one being the fact that Severus Snape was scolding a werewolf like he was training a puppy and the second being that said werewolf responded as such. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Crawling practically on his belly, James watched his lycanthrope friend place his muzzle on Snape’s foot. Snape sighed sitting back down but huffed as the werewolf rolled over and whined. He wiggled around with his belly exposed until he realised that the raven haired Slytherin was paying him no mind, instead he tried to get more comfortable against the wall. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you want now? Good job not eating your friend mutt,” Snape said patting the beast’s muzzle. Letting out a happy yip, a sound James had never heard before from the werewolf, he tried to lick Snape’s face. As soon as the wet muscles made contact with a pale cheek, Snape blushed and pushed the head away like it was some uppity dog and not a werewolf. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I told you not to do that! Go to bed already!” The teen chided wiping his face free from saliva while also glaring at Lupin as he got comfortably repositioned with his head resting in Snape’s lap. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What did you do to him? Is it a potion? A charm? Does it only work on you?” James was firing questions off before he even thought them through. From what Sirius told him Snape had pretty much figured out that Remus was a werewolf on his own and this was meant to scare him even though it was stupid. But now he was here and seeing his once violent friend resting peacefully in the lap of their nemesis. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Believe it or not I didn’t do anything. He’s just like this,” Snape said crossing his arms. He obviously wasn’t happy about the developments. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay, but did you see him change? Was there something different? Do you have ancient runes or-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I saw him change, realised Black sent me here to be eaten by a werewolf, made peace with my death, and then didn’t die. Now I am going to sleep Potter so please do me a favour and either shut up or leave.” Nodding James scooted closer. Seeing no reaction from the lycan and only a raised eyebrow from Snape he moved again. When he was once more within range, Lupin growled causing him to scoot back an inch or two. Pleased with the teen’s distance, the growls subsided and so James stayed put. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>By then, Snape had already leaned back and closed his eyes, his chest rising and falling evenly. The tension slowly dissipated from his face as he allowed himself to get some much needed sleep. His pale skin shone in the moonlight and for the first time, James noticed how long his eyelashes were. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shaking his head, James still couldn’t believe what he was seeing. The first time they’d been with Lupin in the shack, after taking their animagus forms, of course, he tried to eat Peter, eat him, and kill Sirius. But now he turned all obedient lapdog with Snape. With Snivellus of all people! It didn’t sit right with him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was glad that Snape wasn’t torn to shreds or turned into a werewolf, but seeing him there, his stomach getting nuzzled by Lupin and his hands gripping onto the werewolf while he slept. James didn’t like that. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Deciding there was nothing he could do, the raven haired teen closed his eyes and allowed himself to fall asleep as well. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>                                                                                                               XX</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James’ eyes opened slowly as the first bits of sunlight hit his eyes. Not seeing the red and gold canopy he was used to, he quickly sobered up as his mind helpfully supplied him with memories of the night before. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He looked to where his friend was to see that Snape had taken his leave and all that was left Remus covered in his red trimmed cloak. Looks like Snape cared enough to make sure the Gryffindor was warm before he left. For once after a night of transformation, there were no wounds on him, proof that he spent the entire time cuddled up with the Slytherin. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey Moony, wake up,” James said rolling him around. Those green eyes opened only to slits before Remus popped up, almost hitting James in the chin with his head. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Where’s Severus?!” He yelled looking around for any evidence of him. In his shock, the stag animagus ghosted over the fact that he used Snape’s first name and instead chose to focus on his practically naked friend looking for the Slytherin. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you remember last night?” James asked as he watched the other teen get up and start dressing. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course, I remember! I always do. I didn’t attack him Prongs. It was- I don’t know- just different this time! Usually, it’s like I’m tied up in the back of a carriage or something and can only see what happens but this time I had my wits about me to some extent. No scars, I’m not exhausted,” Seeing as how the prefect was bouncing around while trying to make himself look presentable, he surely had a full night’s rest, “I may not have been in control it was so much better,” Remus replied with a growing smile on his face. His voice was absolutely giddy. He then blushed a bit and looked back at his friend, “Sorry about snapping at you by the way.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s whatever Moony. I’m more curious as to why you didn’t attack Snape,” James asked looking at him. He expected the obvious answer, “I don’t know” but instead Remus’ blush darkened.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That doesn’t matter! What matters is that Snape calms the wolf and I need to tell off Sirius for that stupid stunt,” Remus said, his expression darkening. If Snape wasn’t whatever he was, he most definitely would have been killed or bitten, Remus would’ve executed, and Sirius would’ve been expelled. James opened his mouth to agree when a completely different thought hit him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Shit. Do you think Snape will say anything? The bastard might expose you! What if he goes straight to the Ministry!” James said pulling both of them out of their rage at their friend’s idiotic actions. Looking at each other they quickly went through the tunnel and left. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Running into the castle they were relieved to see the earliest risers out and about. At least they weren’t too early returning. That however made James wonder how Snape had managed to sneak back in. Climbing up the steps to their tower, they whispered the password to the Fat Lady and entered. Remus’ face had gone back to being angry as they made it to their room door. As the opened it, they found a pacing Sirius and a distressed looking Peter.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Moony I’m-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Save it. I rather hear your apology when I don’t feel like hexing you,” Remus muttered as he grabbed a clean pair of clothes and his bath items, “I’m gonna go take a shower.” With that, he stormed off making sure that even the door felt his rage.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Did you get Sniv- Snape out in time?” Sirius asked actually looking worried. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James turned to him, trying to look angry but not as pissed off as Remus had been. While he agreed fully with his friend’s anger, he didn’t want to pile up on Sirius, “What you did was so bloody stupid! You could’ve made a murderer out of Remus just to teach Snape a lesson!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So he’s fine? You got him out in time?” Sirius pressed on desperate to clear his conscious. James paused not knowing if he should share the developments with Sirius just yet. He was sure Remus wouldn’t care and it’s not like he needed Snape’s permission. But he already didn’t like what happened and he wasn’t keen on repeating it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I didn’t have to save Snape. Moony, the wolf...likes him?” James phrased it more as a question when he said it. It still didn’t make sense to him as to how and why the werewolf chose to like Snape instead of attacking him and if Remus knew why he didn’t share. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>While the other two looked at him in astonishment, James began changing into a clean uniform. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Likes him?” Peter echoed from his bed. For a moment James had forgotten he was there.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah he acted kind of like a regular dog when Snape was there,” he said adjusting his tie before tossing on his robe. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I also tried to attack James,” Remus added from the doorway. His hair was still a little damp, as he claimed drying spells made his hair feel weird.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You what?” Sirius added with his mouth hanging half open. Forgetting he was in trouble with the green eyed boy he pressed on, “Why would you be nice to Snivellus and attack one of your best mates?” Remus blinked before walking into the room and grabbing his things for class. Without so much as a look at Sirius, he left for breakfast.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Looks like he’s still mad,” James said a little sympathetic as the curly haired teen deflated. Peter added his own sympathies as the trio got ready for class and made their way down to the Great Hall. As James entered he already spotted Remus sitting away from their usual spot with a few other prefects. It wasn’t the first time Remus had been mad at them and it probably wouldn’t be the last. He needed his time away and after a while, he’d be back with them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sitting down, James served himself, putting as much food as he cared to eat on his plate. Soon enough his eyes roamed over to the Slytherin table to see Snape sitting down between Rosier and Avery. Across from him was Regulus trying, and failing, to engage him in conversation. As they all talked around him, his nose was still in that book and a quill was in the hand that should have had food in it. No wonder the teen was so thin. Snape looked up and glared, however, it wasn’t at him. Following the line of sight, he saw Remus giving the Slytherin a small smile before looking away.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Right James! James!” Sirius called before playfully punching him in the arm. He turned to his friend with an undignified huh, “What are you even looking at? Evans is on the other side of the table.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James shook his head, “Nothing, just thinking about stuff.” Sirius nodded solemnly before returning to his own food and re-entering his argument with Frank Longbottom about Quidditch or something. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His eyes fell back on Snape as the other boy got up. He motioned for Regulus to sit back down as the younger teen got up to follow him. James got up as well, telling Peter to tell Sirius he went to get something from the room and he’d meet them in Potions. As he walked out he passed Remus and brushed a hand on his back to get his attention. Soon enough he was followed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What are you doing?” Remus asked once he caught up with him. They walked down the halls until they found Snape waiting outside the Potions classroom still writing in the old book he carried around.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Snape!” Remus called. If he actually was a dog, his tail would definitely be wagging. He bounded forward stopping short when the Slytherin got into a defensive stance.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you want?” Snape spit out glaring over the top of his book. James knew his wand was concealed behind it, ready to strike them if they drew their own.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We just wanna make sure you won’t go squealing about what happened last night,” James said eyeing those pale hands for any sudden movements. Snape could be a tricky bastard when he wanted to.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I have no interest in exposing your mutt,” Remus frowned a bit at the name calling, “Besides knowing Dumbledore he’d sooner try and shut me up than let me tell anyone about what he allows on school grounds. If that’s all you wanted then sod off,” he ground out, though it sounded more tired than anything. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well that’s good,” Remus said taking another step closer. James wanted to reach out and pull him back, but he squashed the weird feeling, “Anyway the-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Severus!” The three of them turned to see Regulus Black speed walking down the halls. His neutral expression was replaced with a sneer as he saw the two Gryffindors. His wand was out in a flash as his eyes narrowed dangerously. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t get ahead of yourself, they were being civil for once. As hard as it is to believe,” Snape said walking towards his housemate. Regulus’ eyes didn’t leave them and neither did his wand until Snape laid his pale hand on the other teen’s and pushed it down. Both Marauders tensed at the ease in which the raven touched the other teen, “Reg, stop.” The frosty expression melted for a second as Snape let a small smile spread across his lips. James huffed, greasy git never smiled at him, “Don’t you have History of Magic? That’s on the other side of the castle. You’ll be late if you don’t go.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Regulus pouted like a scolded child, “But you told me not to follow you and then they,” he pointed an accusing finger out at the pair, “Followed you. I was concerned. And it’s not like Binns will notice if I’m there or not. He probably doesn’t even know he’s a ghost.” Snape rolled his eyes as Rosier and Avery walked down the hall along with a lot of other students heading to classes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Go to class Reg. I’ll be fine Rosier and Avery are here now,” with one last look, the fifth year nodded and walked off nodding to the two older Slytherins that he passed. Rosier and Avery soon flanked him and continued walking as they started their daily argument about who would get to mooch off of Snape’s potion prowess that day and who would be stuck actually trying with Wilkes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, that was weird. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him look like that, not since the last time he spoke to Lily,” James said turning to Remus. The once happy kid, was now sporting the same pout that was on Black’s face, “Okay, what’s up with you?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“James, can you keep a secret?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, what is it?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I like Snape.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You what!” Both teens looked up to see a scandalised Sirius and a wide eyed Peter. </span>
  <span></span>
