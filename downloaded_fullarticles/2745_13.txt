</p><p>The thing about lives, Harry mused, is that they aren’t like stories. Stories end. Lives continue after “the end”. He stared at the crocheted <em> thing </em> hanging on Mrs. Weasley’s kitchen wall and was vaguely aware that Hermione was talking. What was that, a duck?</p><p>“Harry Potter, I swear to Merlin if you don’t start listening, I’m charming your Firebolt to play the sodding national anthem every time you fart.” Hermione snapped, and Harry looked at her guiltily.</p><p>She looked exhausted. Her normally bushy hair had taken on a life of its own, and was curling wildly out of the bun she’d thrown it into earlier that morning. He checked the clock. It was nearing two in the afternoon. The scrubbed kitchen table was strewn with pamphlets emblazoned with different Ministry departments, and a few with the Wizarding Exchange University emblem: a wand and a quill, crossed over the seal of a prominent British muggle university.</p><p>It had been almost a year since the battle at Hogwarts. It had been a year of healing, of sitting in waiting rooms and by bedsides at St. Mungo’s. It had been a year for justice, where Harry himself had been asked to testify at the trials of many prominent Death Eaters. And it had been a year to mourn. Those who had fallen on the battlefield and those who had passed more quietly afterwords from their injuries had been buried, and those that remained had grieved.</p><p>And still it wasn’t over. Harry felt as exhausted as Hermione looked.</p><p>“You need to figure out what to do next.” Hermione said, more gently this time. “I know you, Harry. You won’t be able to sit around and let Molly feed you forever.”</p><p>Part of Harry wanted to disagree. It had been wonderful, coming back to the Burrow on weekends and having Mrs. Weasley not-so-subtly pile potatoes and roast on his plate. Some evenings he would even return to Number Twelve to a charmed parcel waiting by the Floo. Ron and Hermione had decided to stay with him. Hermione’s parents had remained in Australia. And Ron wouldn’t say, but he’d wanted to be closer to St. Mungos and his brothers’ shop while Fred recovered.</p><p>Ron emerged from the living room, carrying a box of Weasley products. “I dunno, Mione, it seems to be good for mum. Maybe you should just join the Aurors, mate. You’re bound to get in!”</p><p>“Yeah, because rushing off after Dark Wizards is going to be <em> healthy </em> .” Harry muttered, and dropped his head onto the tabletop with a resounding <em> thunk </em>. Hermione made a noise of consideration, and Harry squinted up to see that she was holding a pamphlet for the Auror’s Academy.</p><p>“Actually, Harry,” she said slowly, “that’s not a bad idea. I mean,” she continued, when Harry and Ron gaped at her, “the Academy seems very… structured. You wouldn’t be able to go rushing off after Dark Wizards. You’d have a partner, someone to watch you back. And it’s not like you’ve gotten the saving people thing out of your system.”</p><p>“I haven’t got a ‘saving people thing’.” Harry said, mulishly.</p><p>Ron turned and gaped at Harry instead.</p><p>“Mate, did you or did you not get a kid out of a tree last week?” he demanded.</p><p>Harry grunted. He had. But she’d accidentally levitated herself up there after her kite and gotten scared, and it wasn’t like…</p><p> </p><p>He sighed. “Any idea where your mum keeps the parchment, Ron?”</p><p> </p><p>~*~</p><p> </p><p>It turned out that applying for the Auror’s Academy as Harry Potter was both easier and more complicated than Harry had expected. After submitting a formal letter to the Head of the Department, a Mr. Randolf Huntsworth, Harry had received a letter informing him that they would be glad to welcome him into the new class the next fall. However, as he had failed to take his NEWT exams, he would be expected to undergo intensive tutoring in a number of Auror-related subjects.</p><p>Hermione, who had already applied for and been accepted to the Wizarding Exchange programs at both Oxford and Cambridge, was thrilled at the news.</p><p>“We can be study partners, Harry! Imagine how nice it’s going to be to focus on homework and not the end of the world.” she enthused. Harry had a sneaking suspicion that his future contained more colored timetables than he’d prefer.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re sure you don’t want to apply too? Suffer with me?” Harry joked to Ron during a regular pub night. Hermione, already a cider and a half in, was arguing elf rights with an overwhelmed looking man by the dartboard.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m sure. It’s been fun, working with the twins.” He drained his pint and leaned back, looking content. “Besides, Fred’s still getting used to the new leg, he fell off of a ladder again last week.”<br/>
<br/>
Harry winced. Fred’s leg had been damaged by the curse that they had thought had killed him. It was only some very quick thinking on Hermione’s part and a Healer willing to listen to what sounded like the ravings of a distraught friend that had saved him.</p><p>“He isn’t trying to make his own yet, is he? I know the replacement isn’t quite his style.”</p><p>“What, because it doesn’t shoot off fireworks? I think I overheard him talking about improvements.” Ron looked thoughtful. “Mind you, between that and George’s ear, the joke business might take a backseat to building some more useful prosthetics. Moody’s eye is about as advanced as it’s gotten, Fred says.”</p><p>Harry grinned. “And if it just happens to have the ability to make rude noises when you walk?”</p><p>Ron grinned back. “Kind of pedestrian for him, but really that’s just icing on the cake, isn’t it?”</p><p>Suddenly, a very familiar voice rose over the general din of the pub.<br/>
<br/>
“—AND YOU, SIR, HAVE THE COMPASSION OF A TOERAG.”</p><p>Ron sighed. “Let’s go get Hermione.”</p><p> </p><p>~*~</p><p> </p><p>Auror Academy was in a word, intense. Harry knew walking in that he had eighteen months of grueling classes and lectures to look forward to, followed by eighteen weeks of intense physical and magical training. Students had the option to live in the severe dormitories on the small campus, but Number Twelve was close enough to the London Portkey entrance that Harry elected to commute.</p><p>It meant waking up every day at five, wolfing down a boiled egg and some toast, and Apparating to the Apparition Point by five thirty in order to make the five forty-five Portkey. Many of his classes were at least interesting. When presented through the lens of one day potentially saving a life, even History of Magic was fascinating.</p><p>“Yes, there is more to Wizarding History than a pair of Dark wizards and a lot of Goblin Rebellions.” Auror Singh said dryly on their first day of class. “And you will be expected to know it. Understanding the history of a conflict is going to aid you in de-escalating that conflict. Your role as an Auror is not to go in, wands blazing, and take down the conveniently attired Dark wizard. Though not everyone here has the same level of experience in that, ey Potter?”</p><p>Heads had turned to look at him, and Harry had felt his ears going red. But Auror Singh, an older Indian woman with a pleasantly lined face, was smiling warmly at him, and he felt himself smiling back.</p><p>“Now then,” she continued, business like, “Who can tell me the main catalyst for the rash of house burnings in 1872?”</p><p>~*~</p><p>Harry was in Potions Class, staring at the board. It seemed deceptively simple, and yet his cauldron did not contain the venom antidote that Auror Blackwell had assigned, but a mass of grey sludge. He turned to stare into the cauldron, and began trying to remember what he had done differently.</p><p>Auror Blackwell prowled the aisles in much the same way Professor Snape had, but the similarities ended there. He was a tall man, powerfully built, with skin like teak and a wicked sense of humor. He stopped in front of Harry’s cauldron and peered in.</p><p>“That, Potter, isn’t what you meant to brew.” It was a statement, not a question. Harry shook his head.</p><p>“No sir, it is not.”</p><p>Auror Blackwell considered him carefully. “The directions on the board are not complete. Did you realize this?”</p><p>Harry blanched. He had not.</p><p>Auror Blackwell nodded, thoughtful. “I understand much of your Potions education was under Professor Snape, and that your final year at Hogwarts was spent on the War effort?”</p><p>Harry nodded. “Yes, sir.” His mind was racing. Would he be thrown out? He’d tried his best, it was true, but if he didn’t know enough to be here then-</p><p> </p><p>“I’m getting you a tutor.”</p><p>Harry’s brain screeched to a halt. Tutor?</p><p>“Another Auror, sir?” Harry asked politely, and Auror Blackwell snorted.</p><p>“We don’t have the teachers to spare, the Academy is stretched as it is. No, you’ll be paired with someone from the Rehabilitation program. There’s a young man, about your age. Gifted in potions. I’ll have to ask you, Potter, to give it a chance. You need to pass this, and I know that you have the ability to with help. Huntsworth had said this might be the case, but I wanted to get a feel for your abilities.”</p><p>Harry was already nodding as Blackwell continued, “His name is Draco Malfoy. Normally we’d avoid conflict so soon after the war, but he’s been a model prisoner-”<br/>
<br/>
<em> “Malfoy?!” </em> The exclamation was past Harry’s lips before he could stop it. Blackwell was struggling not to look amused.</p><p>“Oh, you know him. Good, that will save us introductions. Your first tutoring session will be tomorrow, be prepared to brew this again.”</p><p>“But-”</p><p>“No buts, Potter.” And with that, Auror Blackwell strode down the aisle to the next workbench. Harry slumped in his seat, staring at the mess in his cauldron. He’d finally found something he felt like he ought to be doing, and sodding Malfoy was the only person that could help him through it.</p><p>Hermione was going to laugh herself silly.</p><p>~*~</p><p> </p><p>Ron and Hermione’s reactions to Harry’s news that night were predictable. Ron’s ears went red and he stomped around, ranting about ferrets and cauldrons and ferrets in cauldrons and ferrets <em> as </em>cauldrons and-</p><p> </p><p>“Really, Ron, you shouldn’t be so shocked. You were at the hearing.” Hermione said, wiping tears of mirth from her eyes. “And Harry, it’s not the end of the world, it really isn’t.”</p><p>“Might be the end of his world.” Harry growled. He poked the sausages in the pan with a little more force than was strictly necessary, and one squeaked. He sighed. “Ron, did you get these from your brothers?”</p><p>Ron shrugged. “They were free. They don’t do anything much.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m not even going to bother reminding you how much is in my vault and that you have a key.” Harry retorted, poking the sausages again. They each squeaked in a different pitch. He played a little tune, while Hermione came up behind him and looked over his shoulder.</p><p>“That is rather clever, isn’t it?” she said, and Harry looked at her.</p><p>“I think it was just ‘Row, Row, Row Your Boat.” he said, confused.</p><p>“Not the song, the sausage. It’d cheer kids up, don’t you think? Mind you, if they turn any bit of me a different color I’m going to have words with Fred. That danish he gave me last week took days to wear off. Hair isn’t supposed to be pink.”</p><p>Ron looked at her, confused. “Your hair didn’t look any different last week.”</p><p>Hermione blushed. “Not that you could see, no.”</p><p>Ron and Harry’s eyes met, and they quickly looked away.</p><p>“Eggs?” Harry squeaked. Hermione laughed and passed him the carton.</p><p>“Seriously, Harry, what are you going to do about Malfoy? They’re not going to give you another tutor, the program is stretched pretty thin.”</p><p>Harry took the eggs and removed one, breaking it neatly into another pan. “I’m not sure,” he said, Vanishing the shell and repeating the action twice more, “Auror Blackwell’s a decent sort, and I can’t imagine Malfoy being able to hoodwink the entire staff. And I need this to pass, and to learn for the field it’s just-”<br/>
<br/>
“Your life is some kind of cosmic joke where you can’t get a break?” Ron chimed in sardonically. Harry pointed at him with the spatula.</p><p>“That’s the one.”</p><p>“Did you seen the paper? Maybe you can join one of those support groups.”</p><p>~*~</p><p>The next day, Harry arrived at the Potions lab Auror Blackwell had indicated ten minutes before the scheduled meeting time. He wasn’t sure what to expect. Malfoy had been in Azkaban for six months, the full extent of his sentence, until a month and a half ago. Harry’s own testimony had been instrumental in keeping the sentence short, but Harry didn’t expect Malfoy to be <em> grateful </em> for telling a room full of people that he’d once found him crying in a bathroom.</p><p>This was going to be awkward.</p><p>At eleven o’clock, precisely, the door opened and Malfoy walked in. He looked thin, gaunt, but his jaw was set. He wore a set of pale gray robes, and Harry could see the shine of a silver band around one wrist. The digits 8 0 0 glowed dimly in its surface.</p><p>Harry stood and offered a hand. “Malfoy.”</p><p>Malfoy froze for a second, looking at the proffered hand, and then took it and shook it. “Potter. Let’s get to business, shall we?”</p><p>Harry nodded, and indicated the potion textbook on the table. “It’s a general antivenom. It keeps-”</p><p>“Going grey and sludgy?” Malfoy interrupted.</p><p>Harry glared at him “Yes.”</p><p>Malfoy sighed. “Potter, I don’t want to be here with you either. But I have eight hundred hours of community service to complete, and sitting in a cool-charmed room with you is still slightly preferable to cleaning bedpans at St. Mungo's so if you <em> don’t mind </em>, I’ll get on with it, shall I?”</p><p>Harry, taken aback, nodded.</p><p>Malfoy took a quill and some parchment from a stack on the table. He loaded the quill with ink, methodically, and drew a circle. From it he drew a line, then another circle, and another line.</p><p>“Those look like molecules.” Harry said, surprised. Malfoy looked at him.</p><p>“They are, in a way. How do you think antivenom works?”</p><p>Harry shrugged, he hadn’t considered it. “Doesn’t it just… stop it?” At Malfoy’s raised eyebrow, Harry threw his hands up. “I don’t know!”</p><p>“Think, Potter.”</p><p>Harry thought. “Well,” he started slowly, “it must neutralize it somehow. And in order to do that it must, what, stick to it?”</p><p>Malfoy nodded. “Close. It binds to it. Where the potion differs from muggle antivenom is that this is effective against the venom of magical creatures, and doesn’t have to be tailored to the exact species it works against. However, the molecular structure is incredibly fragile. They teach this one on purpose, you know.”</p><p>Harry looked at him, confused.</p><p>“It can be bought at any apothecary, and is inexpensive. But you can’t <em> mess with it </em>, and you need to add ingredients precisely. Tell me, what were you doing while reading the directions for the next step?”</p><p>Harry considered this. “I was stirring,” he said, realization dawning, “Absentmindedly.”</p><p>Malfoy nodded. Harry was surprised at how little he wanted to punch the smug look off of Malfoy’s face.</p><p>“Do it again,” Malfoy instructed, “And this time, pay attention.”</p><p>Nevermind. Harry wanted to hit him again.</p><p>~*~</p><p>In the weeks that followed, Harry fell into a routine. Wake up, go to class, Potions practice with Malfoy, go home. Pub on Thursdays and alternate Tuesdays. It was a lot of work, and he was often asleep before his head hit the pillow, but it felt… good.</p><p>His favorite class became Stealth and Tracking, to his own surprise, even after Auror Dolage confiscated his Invisibility Cloak.</p><p>“Remarkable,” the older wizard had said, turning the shimmering fabric in his hands, “but ultimately unhelpful. You’ll be out of luck without this. Keep it out of class, I want to see what Potter can do, not what Potter’s Cloak can do. You can have this back at the end of this session.”</p><p>Even the Potions tutoring was going well, to Harry’s amazement. His inability to get into hexing matches with Malfoy likely had something to do with that.</p><p>“I still have your wand,” he confessed to Malfoy while waiting for an antidote to render. At Malfoy’s raised eyebrows he shrugged. “The Ministry thought it had been destroyed in the Fiendfyre.”</p><p> </p><p>“The wand I was using was. You realize I cannot possess a wand until my parole is over?” Malfoy said smoothly, not looking at Harry. Harry’s gaze slipped to Malfoy’s wrist. The dimly glowing digits now read 7 6 0. As he watched, they changed to 7 5 9.</p><p>“Is that how many hours you have left?” Harry asked, aghast. Malfoy looked at him.</p><p>“It’s not a fashion accessory, Potter. Any wand in my hand will cause the bracelet to become shackles.”<br/>
<br/>
Harry felt sick. This was Malfoy, yes, and at least he wasn’t in jail. But-</p><p>Hang on.</p><p>“What’s that?” Harry asked, grabbing Malfoy’s other hand without thinking. A burn covered it. Malfoy snatched his hand away.</p><p>“Some mail from a fan,” he snapped, “Don’t yours send caustic ingredients?”</p><p>“No, they don’t, just lots of weird perfume on letters. Malfoy, did you report this?” Harry demanded, trying to grab Malfoy’s hand again.<br/>
<br/>
“No, I did not, and lay <em> off </em>, Potter. Your antidote is going to explode if you don’t add the sea slug.”</p><p>Harry yelped and ran over to the cauldron, which was still bubbling merrily. When he looked up to glare at Malfoy, he was gone.</p><p>~*~</p><p>“I’m telling you Hermione, it was weird. I can see why Malfoy would be harassed, but he’s always run to someone about it.”</p><p>Hermione looked up from an essay she was writing. “Is it really so surprising? He’s lost the authority figures he used to go run <em> to </em>, Harry.”</p><p>“Yeah, there’s no one to snivel at, Snape’s dead. Ow!” Ron added.</p><p>Hermione delicately tucked the foot she had kicked him with back underneath of herself. “Professor Snape. You realize that being suspicious of Malfoy is a terrible habit, Harry?”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. “I’m not suspicious, I’m just, I don’t know. Concerned. He’s been decent.”</p><p>It was Ron’s turn to roll his eyes. “Yeah, Malfoy’s been ‘decent’ with an Auror trainee in a building full of Aurors. Give him the key to the city. Toss the paper this way, would you?”</p><p>Harry handed him the <em> Daily Prophet </em>. “You don’t think it’s weird?”</p><p>“Nah. I wouldn’t mind a swipe at him now that he can’t hit back.” Ron disappeared behind the paper.</p><p>Hermione looked up from her essay again, thoughtful. “Although… there has been some research about rehabilitation and removing negative influences,” she offered, “Maybe he really is turning over a new leaf.”<br/>
<br/>
Harry shrugged. “Maybe. Still a git through.”</p><p>“That’s just how you know it’s Malfoy,” Ron scoffed from behind the paper. “Hey, that one support group has a name now! Children of the Phoenix.”</p><p>Hermione frowned. “Are they affiliated with the Order? I don’t remember hearing about anyone in the Order starting a support group.”</p><p>“Nah, looks like some former Hufflepuff up near Hogsmeade. People really like him!” Ron replied, and then, “Oh, hell, Cannons lost.”</p><p>Harry laughed. “Give it up, Ron. That’s never going to change.”</p><p>Ron threw a cushion at him.</p>
