    <p>"I am truly sorry that you were hurt as a result of my actions," Draco said, as sincerely as he could. "I didn't intend...the necklace was chosen by the Dark - no, dammit - You-Know-Who, and I did my best to prevent... Oh, fuck it." He pinched the bridge of his nose, avoiding his own gaze in the mirror. "Right. Let's try this again."</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>
  <em>To Tognuk, account manager of the Malfoy Heir vault at Gringotts Bank, Draco Malfoy, Heir Malfoy, sends greetings</em>
</p><p><em>This letter entitles the bearer, Miss Katherine Bell or her representative, to withdraw a sum of </em><u>two hundred and forty-eight galleons, ten sickles, fourteen knuts</u> <em>from the Malfoy Heir vault.</em></p><p>

</p><p>"Aunt Andromeda," Draco said formally, approaching her desk with a thick sheaf of parchment in his hands. "I have been attempting to...reconcile the Malfoy accounts, and I have encountered something of a difficulty."</p><p>Andromeda raised her eyebrows, nodding at a chair and holding out her hand. "Surely the totals aren't out of whack - Cissy was always excellent at mathematics."</p><p>Draco sat, silently passing her the papers as he tried, yet again, to wrap his head around the idea of his elegant, stately mother ever being called <em>Cissy.</em></p><p>Andromeda skimmed the first page, flipped to the last, hummed a little, then began to look through them all more carefully. "...I believe I see the problem," she finally agreed. "All your major business partners and middle-men are on your list of prohibited persons, aren't they?"</p><p>Draco nodded. "I can't contact them under the terms of my deferred sentence," he replied. "But House Malfoy cannot afford to leave business unattended for the year or more I will be under these restrictions, and nor can we afford to entirely alienate our old allies."</p><p>"I'll make some enquiries," Andromeda agreed. </p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Another letter from the DMLE arrived over breakfast. Draco didn't manage to get it off the table before Andromeda noticed.</p><p>"Oh for goodness' sake," she muttered. "Dora, <em>do</em> remind your superiors of the benefits of organisation? There's no need for Draco to be getting all these interview and testimony requests in dribs and drabs. Just because he's obligated to comply doesn't mean he's not due the courtesy of a compiled schedule."</p><p>Tonks (she had given Draco a rather deadly look when he'd attempted to call her Nymphadora) rolled her eyes, putting little Teddy up over her shoulder and patting his back. "We're run off our feet, Mum, there's so many active warrants you wouldn't believe it."</p><p>"Darling, you forgot - " Andromeda sighed as Teddy spat up all over Tonks' work robes, her warning a little too late. "Turn around, I'll get it."</p><p>"<em>Accio</em> stain cloth," Draco said, being well-familiarised with the results of Teddy's messes by now. It sailed into his hands, and he passed it over to clean up what <em>tergeo</em> missed. "It's fine, Aunt Andromeda," he promised. "It's no great inconvenience."</p><p>"Who are they asking you about this time?" Andromeda asked. "And how much notice are they giving you?"</p><p>Draco opened the letter and scanned it. "Tomorrow afternoon, and...oh for Merlin's sake, I don't recognise any of these names!"</p><p>Tonks shrugged, passing Teddy off to Andromeda. "They'll see if you recognise the faces then, I guess. I'd better go." She got up, and yelled up the stairs, "Dad, I'm going! Are you ready?"</p><p>Draco sighed.</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Professor McGonagall was waiting at the school gates when Draco arrived, on the first day of his court-appointed assistance with the Hogwarts repairs. "Mr Malfoy," she said, surprisingly warmly, holding out her hand. "Welcome back to Hogwarts."</p><p><em>Am I?</em> Draco shook her hand with an awkward thank you. "I'm surprised you're meeting me yourself, Professor," he admitted as they began the walk to the castle. "I'm sure you must be busy, managing the repairs, as well as the usual summer's work."</p><p>McGonagall smiled a little. "I am, but I've always enjoyed a walk for clearing the head," she replied. "And you're something of a special case."</p><p>"..how so?"</p><p>"There are two main groups contributing to the repairs," McGonagall explained, settling into lecture mode that had Draco feeling oddly nostalgic. "There are the volunteers - community members who feel a love for Hogwarts and want to see it returned to its full majesty before the start of term. And there are the convicted - those members of Voldemort's allies and followers who were convicted of more minor crimes, and are here to fulfil their sentence."</p><p>Draco frowned, daring to interrupt. "Surely there is no question that I belong in the latter category?"</p><p>McGonagall glanced at him and raised her eyebrows. "Can you think of no reasons why you might not?"</p><p>Draco flushed, looking away. "...I'm a marked Death Eater?" he guessed.</p><p>"Certainly not!" McGonagall's forthright tone made Draco stare in surprise. "No, Mr Malfoy, we are reluctant to place you with the convicted because you are <em>young</em>. And don't try to tell me you're not, when I've been teaching here for more than twice your lifespan. And we are reluctant also because you were coerced in the first place, and have been cooperative since. Because you represent the leaders who lost the war for their side, when those leaders are imprisoned and unavailable to hear their displeasure. And, to be frank, because we remember you having a terrible habit of annoying people when you were younger, and the implicit threats that kept you safe then are no longer at your disposal."</p><p>Draco hadn't thought of that. <em>Why</em> hadn't he thought of that? Of course the Snatchers would hate him. Of course he was at risk from them. But he'd been so caught up in worrying about the people on the <em>other</em> side of the war, he hadn't even considered the collection of enemies that now faced him. "And you...would rather I not be targeted?" he said tentatively.</p><p>"By either group," McGonagall agreed immediately. She paused, and her tone softened. "Mr Malfoy, whatever your crimes, you were missed here. I was not the only teacher concerned for you, either. A young man may make mistakes, when he is surrounded by people such as you were forced to tolerate. But I, and others, hope to see you grow into a <em>good</em> man, one who is considered and compassionate in his actions. And you will not be able to do so unless we give you the chance."</p><p>There was a long silence as Draco tried to absorb that astonishing speech. "...who will I be working with, then?" he eventually asked.</p><p>McGonagall gave a small, approving nod. "You will be working with Professor Tiresias Smethwyck, Severus Snape's replacement as Head of Slytherin House, and my own replacement as Transfiguration Professor." She paused briefly. "...you may find he is able to give you some news of your friends; I know you cannot have had much."</p>
