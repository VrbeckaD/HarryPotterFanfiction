    <p>“Look, it’s Hermione Granger!”</p><p>All aboard the Hogwarts Express, students were pushing one another as they gawked at Hermione Granger, war heroine. Hermione fidgeted as she nervously kept her head down and tucked a stray strand of wild brown hair behind her ear. She was making her way through to the Head Boy and Girl compartment on the train. Coming back to finish her education after the war had been a no brainer for her. What she hadn’t anticipated was the amount of commotion people would make at the sight of her. After all, she had simply assisted Harry and not Harry himself.</p><p>After the war, Harry had been put straight into the aurors department and of course, Ron had followed suit. Hermione felt a pang as she thought of them. Ron had knew his place was to be beside Harry but where did she fit in? She had to find her own person and forever be following them around. Hogwarts had seemed like an easy answer to it all her questions. Finishing her schooling was the first step to building a solid foundation for any knowledge.</p><p>Finally she reached the door to her compartment, Hermione went inside. To her relief, it was empty. It was a nice relief from all the stares and whispers. More spacious and luxurious than the regular student compartment, this one held sofas and soft cream curtains.  She moved forward to take a seat when the door opened again. Her eyes dart over to the entrance as a tall, blonde in Slytherine green moved in.</p><p>“You!” She snarled as she leaped over, wand drawn and pointed at his neck.</p><p>“Me,” Malfoy drawled, not the least concern. His light grey eyes narrowed at Hermione as he took steps towards her, forcing Hermione against the wall.</p><p>“Don’t come any closer or I’ll…”</p><p>“You’ll what? Kill me?”</p><p>Hermione stuttered. She didn’t actually know what she’d do. All she knew was that the sight of Malfoy brought back all the memories that she wanted to move past. </p><p>“Well? Cat got your tongue for once?”</p><p>Hermione gasp as she felt the wall behind her but Malfoy didn’t stop. He didn’t stop all the way until she could feel the warmth of his breath on her face, their bodies practically touching, and the tips of his shoes meeting hers. Suddenly his arm whipped our and pinned her wanded arm over her head. Hermione winced at the pain. She glared at him and struggled to pull her arm free. </p><p>“I’m not a criminal. I’m Head Boy.” He jabbed his thumb at the badge pinned on his chest. “So get off your high and mighty horse and accept it.” He nose was practically touching hers now and Hermione turned her head in discomfort. Despite her initial reaction of anger, she was keenly aware of Malfoy now. His body towered over her, the large hand at her wrist, the masculine scent of pine and cedarwood, the pale jade of his eyes, and the warmth of him. Her cheeks were flaming and her heart was racing. She had spent the last summer, almost entirely alone, and she blamed that for the way her body was responding. </p><p>“Malfoy,” she breathed out. “Let go of me.” Trying to wrench her arm free just caused further unintentional touching of his body so she froze. Her other hand press against his chest in a weak effort to push him away and to keep a little space between their bodies.  She was keenly aware of how she actually wanted she lean in and touch more. </p><p>“Oh, am I making you feel uncomfortable Granger?” he whispered, his head bending down, his breath practically grazing against the exposed area of her neck.  He must be able to hear her heart now. “Well, get used to it. I’ve had plenty of practice over the last year.”</p><p>Hermione turned her head to look at him. She had underestimated how close he was and in doing so, her lips brushed against him. </p><p>Both their eyes snapped wide in shock.</p>
