    <p>“What have you done to him?” </p><p>The glare Hermione was giving Pansy was so scary, the whole room went quiet.</p><p>“Relax, Granger,” Parkinson said, rolling her eyes. “It was just a prank.”</p><p>“You made him drink a potion!”</p><p>“Not a dangerous one.”</p><p>“You can’t prove that.”</p><p>“Guys—” Harry looked around the eighth year common room, at everyone staring at them, getting more uncomfortable by the second.</p><p>“I’m going to report you,” Hermione fumed.</p><p>“She’ll get kicked out,” Zabini interjected.</p><p>“Well, she should have thought about that before putting Harry in danger,” Hermione shot back.</p><p>“Guys,” Harry tried again. “I feel fine.”</p><p>Nobody seemed to be listening.</p><p>“It’s been fifteen minutes and nothing has happened yet,” Parkinson said in a bored tone. “Honestly, I thought it would be more entertaining.”</p><p>“You really should watch your pumpkin juice, mate,” Ron whispered into Harry’s ear. “It was far too easy for her to slip something into it.”</p><p>Harry let out a sigh and pressed a finger against his throbbing temple.</p><p>“We’ll go down to Slughorn’s quarters and—”</p><p>“Don’t get your knickers in a twist, Granger, he—”</p><p>“DON’T interrupt me when I’m talking!”</p><p>“I bloody well will when you’re talking nonsense like that!”</p><p>“Guys…” Harry closed his eyes.</p><p>“You’re walking on thin ice,” Hermione glowered.</p><p>“Oh yeah? Want me to show you how much I care?”</p><p>“GUYS!”</p><p>The two girls kept glaring at each other.</p><p>“You’re not a prefect anymore,” Parkinson snarled, “and Potter is not lying on the floor dying, so what do you even—”</p><p>“You can’t just go around, putting potions into people’s pumpkin juice,” Hermione yelled, her face glowing bright red.</p><p>“It was a harmless potion for Merlin’s sake!”</p><p>“You admitted you don’t even know its effects!”</p><p>Harry gritted his teeth as the pain in his head became almost unbearable. When Parkinson started shouting at Hermione, he balled his hands into fists and yelled, “Ugh, I wish you two would just SHUT UP!”</p><p>All eyes were suddenly on him. Some started whispering as Ron backed away and Zabini blinked at him. Hermione opened her mouth as if she wanted to say something, but she seemed to think better of it. Or… did she? </p><p>Her eyes widened and she suddenly looked panicked. Harry’s eyes wandered over to Parkinson, who had a similar expression.</p><p>“What?” Harry asked, throwing his hands up in the air.</p><p>Hermione made a choking sound and her hands flew up to her throat.</p><p>Ron darted over to her. “What is it?”</p><p>Hermione gestured to her throat and shook her head.</p><p>“You can’t breathe?” Ron asked, stunned.</p><p>Hermione shook her head and clamped a hand over her mouth.</p><p>“You can’t… speak?” Ron arched an eyebrow.</p><p>Hermione nodded. As did Parkinson.</p><p>“What just happened?” Seamus asked. He looked over at Harry. “Did you do that?”</p><p>“What? How would I—”</p><p>“Yeah, you said you wished they shut up,” Zabini said, giving Harry a speculative glance.</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“Do it again,” Zabini suggested.</p><p>“Do what again?”</p><p>“Wish for them to speak.”</p><p>“That’s stupid, I won’t—”</p><p>“Just do it!”</p><p>Harry let out a sigh, feeling incredibly foolish. “I wish you two would speak again.”</p><p>The second these words left Harry’s mouth, Parkinson started screaming.</p><p>“WHAT THE BLOODY HELL DID YOU JUST DO?”</p><p>“I— I don’t—” Baffled, Harry took a step back.</p><p>“Oh my god, Harry, that was scary,” Hermione wheezed.</p><p>“But I didn’t—”</p><p>Again, everyone was staring at him. It reminded him of second year, when the school had found out he was a Parselmouth. Great.</p><p>“How did you do that?” Hermione asked.</p><p>“I have no idea,” Harry said, truthfully.</p><p>“Do you think…” Ron gulped. “Do you think it has anything to do with that potion?”</p><p>A murmur went through the room that made Harry feel even more edgy.</p><p>“Wish for something else,” Zabini said.</p><p>“Like what?” Harry almost stomped his foot. This was beyond ridiculous. Why in Merlin’s name was this happening? And why was it happening to him?</p><p>“Just…” Zabini looked over his shoulder. “Wish for that cushion or something.”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes but held out his hand. “I wish I had that red cushion over there.” He almost toppled over when the cushion zoomed over and hit him in the face. A few people started laughing, others looked rather concerned.</p><p>“Bloody hell,” Ron murmured.</p><p>“This is bad,” Hermione whispered.</p><p>“What do you mean, bad? This is fantastic?” Ron roared. “Harry, the things you could do!”</p><p>“Like what?” Harry asked, skeptically.</p><p>“I don’t know. But you can wish for things! I wish I could do that.” For a moment, Ron was perfectly still, as though he was hoping the effect would somehow rub off on him after his declaration.</p><p>Over the next few days, Harry found that, unsurprisingly, Hermione was right. It was bad. After he went to Slughorn and told him he had ‘accidentally’ come across a weird potion that apparently made his wishes come true, the Potions Master had simply laughed while patting his own belly and told him, he should enjoy it while it lasts; the effect would wear off in a few days.</p><p>“I know you aren’t one to take advantage of that, my boy,” he had chortled. “Besides, you deserve some fun after… everything.”</p><p>Still, Harry was constantly on edge, trying to watch his words. But, of course, it slipped out once or twice. And, of course, it happened at the worst times possible. </p><p>Professor Flitwick had decided they should take a mock test to which the whole class had groaned. Harry had stared at the parchment and muttered, unthinkingly, “I wish I knew the answer to that.” Mere seconds later, several books had been floating towards him, but Professor Flitwick had flicked his wand before Harry could even touch one.</p><p>“Ten points from Gryffindor,” he had announced with a disapproving look on his face. “Mr Potter, I would have thought you wouldn’t need to cheat your way through this class. I’m very disappointed.”</p><p>Harry had groaned and buried his hands in his hair. When was this bloody potion going to wear off?</p><p>He was still feeling irritated when he headed to the Quidditch pitch after dinner. Being alone and clearing his head while flying seemed like the perfect thing to do. Except, he wasn’t alone. Of course. Harry mentally grumbled as he spotted white blond hair on the stands. </p><p>He decided to simply ignore him. There was only one problem. Malfoy didn’t ignore him.</p><p>“Potter,” he spat. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“What does it look like, Malfoy?” Harry sighed.</p><p>“Whatever. Do it somewhere else.”</p><p>“This isn’t your property, Malfoy,” Harry ground out.</p><p>“Well, I was here first,” Malfoy said defiantly.</p><p>“You argue like a first year,” Harry retorted.</p><p>“Just piss off, Potter.”</p><p>Harry narrowed his eyes. “Can’t you just sulk somewhere else?”</p><p>“I am not sulking!”</p><p>“What’s your problem then?”</p><p>“My problem—” Malfoy was fuming, but he cut himself off as though he had been about to say something he’d regret. It piqued Harry’s interest.</p><p>He cocked his head to the side, deliberating his options. He could make Malfoy tell him. It wouldn’t exactly be fair play, but… it was Malfoy. And maybe, hearing the truth for once would finally clear the air. Yeah… probably not. But it was worth a try.</p><p>“Honestly,” Harry began, “I wish you would just tell me what your problem is.”</p><p>Malfoy glared at him. “You. You are my problem,” he hissed.</p><p>“How so?” Harry said. “I thought we finally—”</p><p>“Yeah, you just had to play the hero again and save me from Azkaban,” Malfoy sneered.</p><p>“I just spoke at your trial. It wasn’t my decision—”</p><p>Malfoy huffed. “And you’re telling people to give me a second chance.” He made a face.</p><p>“I’m just trying—”</p><p>“Don’t,” Malfoy interrupted him.</p><p>Harry bit his lip. He had been wondering if he was going a little overboard. He should have known Malfoy’s pride would take a hit. He peered at Malfoy from under his lashes and bit his lip harder.</p><p>“Is that all?” he asked.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I just wish… err… I wish you would be honest with me. Tell me what’s really bothering you.” Harry almost took a step backwards when Malfoy rose from his seat and leaned closer to him.</p><p>“I just told you, you’re what’s bothering me,” he snarled. “You and your tousled hair, your annoying smile, your stupid hands, your arse, which is honestly just bloody—”</p><p>Harry’s eyes widened as Malfoy clapped both of his hands over his mouth. He looked as shocked as Harry felt. They stared at each other in silence for a few seconds, before Harry finally croaked, “What?”</p><p>“Why did I just say that?” Malfoy whispered, horror-stricken.</p><p>“I— Err—” Harry had no idea what to say. Had Malfoy just— Was he saying— No, it couldn’t be. Right?</p><p>Harry licked his lips.</p><p>“Malfoy,” he said, his voice slightly shaking. “I really wish you would tell me what you really think of me.” He held his breath as Malfoy slowly lowered his hands and his face turned a rather unbecoming shade of purple.</p><p>“I think you’re a bloody wanker,” he choked.</p><p>“Oh,” Harry said, wondering why he suddenly felt a tinge of disappointment. Then again, Malfoy was kind of a wanker, too, wasn’t he? At least in Harry’s opinion. Maybe he wasn’t asking the right questions. But what was he supposed to ask?</p><p>“You know,” Harry said, pulse quickening, “I wish you’d tell me how often you think about me.”</p><p>Malfoy looked as though he was trying very hard to keep his mouth shut. Literally. He seemed to be holding his breath, too. Before Harry could ask again, he wheezed, “All the bloody time.”</p><p>Harry blinked. Well, that didn’t necessarily mean—</p><p>“You’re all I can think about.”</p><p>Oh. Now that—</p><p>“What the fuck did you just do to me, Potter?” Malfoy was positively livid. He lunged at Harry, grabbing him by his robes.</p><p>“I— Um—”</p><p>“Spit it out, Potter.”</p><p>“Would it help if I told you I think about you all the time, too?” Harry said, hesitantly.</p><p>“Don’t change the subject, you— Wait, what?”</p><p>Malfoy’s grip on his robes loosened a little, but he was still clutching them as though he was about to throw Harry to the ground. Not in a good way. </p><p>“Yeah, I, err—” Harry licked his lips again.</p><p>“I don’t believe you,” Malfoy said, narrowing his eyes.</p><p>“If— If I try something,” Harry mumbled, “will you promise not to get mad?” Harry knew it was a dumb question to ask. This was Malfoy after all. But Harry’s head was spinning. Did Malfoy even realise how close they were standing?</p><p>“Try what?” Malfoy said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Um— Malfoy,” Harry gulped, “I wish you would tell me what you want us to do right now.”</p><p>Please don’t let it be ‘fight’! Please don’t let it be ‘fight’!</p><p>“I— I—” Malfoy looked like a fish on dry land. He was obviously trying not to say it. Whatever ‘it’ was.</p><p>“I— I want—”</p><p>“Yes?” Harry leaned forward the tiniest bit.</p><p>“I—” Malfoy’s eyes flicked down to Harry’s mouth.</p><p>“You want to kiss me, don’t you?” His voice didn’t even remotely sound as confident as it had in his head. Luckily, he didn’t have much time to feel embarrassed about that.</p><p>“Yes,” Malfoy whispered.</p><p>Harry’s breath caught in his throat. “Then do it.” He waited, heart pounding in his chest, to be violently tugged forward. Instead, Malfoy moved achingly slow and took a step forward until their bodies were touching.</p><p>“You asked for it, Potter,” he whispered before his lips brushed against Harry’s. It was strange, Harry thought, how well their mouths fit together. Tentatively, he put his arms around Malfoy’s waist. They both jerked at the contact, but after the initial shock, Malfoy only seemed encouraged. Harry felt the warmth of his palm against his cheek and melted into the touch.The kiss was so much softer and sweeter than he had anticipated.</p><p>Much to soon, Malfoy pulled away. His eyes were huge and his cheeks enchantingly flushed.</p><p>“I— I don’t— What just—”</p><p>Harry tried to give him an encouraging smile. “So… my hands, huh? They’re stupid?”</p><p>Malfoy blushed even more. “Whatever you did to me, Potter, you’ll pay for that!”</p><p>“So you didn’t like the kiss?” Harry said, teasingly, but also a little worried.</p><p>“That’s… not what I said,” Malfoy said, averting his eyes.</p><p>“Okay,” Harry grinned. He took a tentative step forward. “How about, err—”</p><p>“What?” Malfoy snapped.</p><p>“How about I wait for you in the common room after everyone has gone to bed?”</p><p>“And then what?” Malfoy scoffed.</p><p>“And then…” Harry bit his bottom lip, willing himself to ignore the embarrassment and just say it. “And then I could put my stupid hands to good use?” Dear Merlin, why did he have to sound so squeaky?</p><p>“Your— What?”</p><p>“Okay, see you then,” Harry said hastily, hurrying off before Malfoy could make fun of him.</p><p>In the distance, he heard Malfoy scream after him.</p><p>“That better not be an empty promise, Potter!”</p><p>Harry grinned, suddenly feeling incredibly giddy. Who would have thought he could wish for something and it would actually come true? Damn it, Parkinson could be such a pain in the arse. But just this once, Harry decided, he was willing to let it slide.</p>
