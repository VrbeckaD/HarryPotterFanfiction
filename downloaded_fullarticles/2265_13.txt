    <p>      We have just come back home from the Grammy's and have a week off before we go back on tour. I've been thinking about this for the past couple of weeks and have finally made the decision. I can't lie to them anymore. I have to tell them and what better time than during our short break. I was so deep in thought I didn't even notice when the door to my room opened or when the bed dipped with the weight of another body. I came to a surprise when familiar arms wrapped around me and a face buried in my neck. I can feel tiny kisses being placed upon my neck.</p><p>"Hey, what's up?" I asked removing myself from Yoongi's arms and turning to face him.</p><p>" Jin's been calling you down for dinner and you didn't come. He sent me to come to check on you," he said. I smiled at him and gave him a quick peck on the lips.</p><p>" Well, we should get going before Jin comes and drags us by the ears," I said, giggling softly to just the thought of that happening. Yoongi must have thought the same because of the smile he had on his face. He got up from the bed and held out his hand for me to grab. I playfully slapped his hands away and laid back on the bed. He sighed at me then dragged me up and led me down the stairs to the dining room the whole way down I just playfully pouting. </p><p>When we entered the dining room I was met with the rest of the members and suddenly thought back to what I was supposed to tell them today. The thought quickly made me become serious again. I didn't like it but, they had to know the truth I can't hide it from them anymore.</p><p>"Finally!" Jeongguk shouted and started filling his plate up with the food in front of him. I must have looked confused because Namjoon then told me that Jin wouldn't let them eat until we came back. I just smiled and sat down to fill my own plate.</p><p>"Yah! Jeongguk slow down or you'll choke on your food." Jin scolded and tried to stop Jeongguk from stuffing his face. We laughed and the rest of dinner went smoothly. We talked about future concerts and our dances that we should practice more. It was great to eat together like this again but, throughout all of dinner just in the back of my mind, I've been thinking. The other members must have noticed me throughout dinner because when we were finished Tae called out to me.</p><p>"Are you okay Minnie?" his voice full of concern. I looked at him and nodded.</p><p>"Yeah just thinking about something. It's actually been on my mind for a while." I whispered looking at the table as if it was suddenly the most interesting thing ever. I suddenly look up and say louder than before. "I think we should have a family meeting."</p>
