  <em>July 31, 1980</em>
</p><p> </p><p>A loud wail of agony, accompanied by vulgar cursing, mainly threats to his manhood, made James wince and wring his hands anxiously. It had been twelve months (the normal gestation period for a Teneshi) of excitement, happiness, panic, aggressive mood swings, thrown vases (and a chair at one point) and bruised heads that all lead up to this. Now that it was finally time for his child to come into the world, James didn’t know if he was ready. </p><p>While he did have a very good father who had raised him into the man he was today, he didn’t know if he could transfer the lessons his father taught him unto his child. He just hoped that he would be able to do his father’s lessons justice when raising his child. </p><p>A final loud scream, then the cry of new lungs meeting oxygen made James go white as snow. </p><p>“You alright there Prongs?” Sirius asked, placing a hand on his best mates shoulder. </p><p>“Yeah, just peachy…” James muttered, staring at the door in trepidation. He was stiff as a wooden board and when the Medi-Witch opened the door, almost snapped himself in half to get to his wife. </p><p>“Congratulations Mr. and Mrs. Potter, you have a perfectly healthy baby boy.” James absently nodded his head in her direction, never taking his eyes off his wife and his son. Even while sweaty and a worn out, Lily, his beautiful Lily, was the most radiant thing he had ever seen. She was practically glowing with her smile so bright she could blind the sun. Resting on her heaving chest was a small bundle wrapped in a white blanket, a small tuft of wet black hair poking out of the top. </p><p>James was pretty sure he wasn’t breathing as he walked over to the mother of his child and sat at her side, moving the blanket slightly to get a good look at his son’s face. His <em> son </em>. Sweet Merlin, he had a child, and a boy nonetheless. He had a successor to the Potter line and couldn’t ask for anything better. </p><p>A soft whimper escaped the wrinkly blob, and a tiny had reached out of the blanket and felt at the air, most likely looking for the blanket that had been covering his face. He scrunched up his nose cutely and then blinked open his eyes, squinting in distaste at the bright hospital lights. James saw a sliver of emerald green before his son closed his eyes and dozed off. </p><p>“-- hold him?” Lily’s voice broke through his starstruck reverie.</p><p>“What was that?” He asked, reaching down and stroking the baby’s soft head of curls. </p><p>“I asked if you wanted to hold him.” Lily smiled, pushing the baby into his unsteady arms. “Now just hold his head-- there you go.”</p><p>“Good job Lils, he’s gonna be a charmer I can tell.” Remus and Sirius had entered the room without James even knowing, too caught up in the overwhelming feeling of finally being a father. James stared down at his son and wondered what he had ever done in a past life to deserve this kind of blessing. </p><p>“You’re going to be batting off marriage proposals before he even gets to Hogwarts,” Sirius commented, reaching forward and poking the boy in his soft cheek. “....He’s so <em> wrinkly </em>.”</p><p>“Sirius, I just gave birth, but I am not above getting out of this bed to throw a vase at your head right now.” Lily sent him a withering glare before looking back down at her son. She wrapped one of his drying curls around her finger and placed a soft kiss on his smooth forehead. “What do you want to name him?” </p><p>“Dad wanted to name him Fleamont II-”</p><p>“No, absolutely not, I will not saddle my child with that name. It may have been respectable when your father was born, but a name like that will just get him bullied now.” Lily vetoed the idea before it could even get off the ground. </p><p>“What about Harry?” Sirius suggested. </p><p>“That could be a nickname, he’s going to be Lord Potter one day and mother would want him to have something more ‘sophisticated’.” James raised one hand to make air quotations, almost dropping Harry in the process.</p><p>“Hadrian?” Remus half asked, half suggested, wrapping an arm around his husband’s waist. Sirius leaned back into the embrace and nodded his head at the name. </p><p>“I like it,” James smiled. “Hadrian. Hadrian James Potter.”</p><p>“Well it's a far cry better than Fleamont II.” Lily said. “Hi Hadrian,” She cooed, her son smiling at his name. </p><p>“He’s perfect,” James said. In absolute awe at the family that he had created for himself. </p>
