    <p>Student party at The Three Broomsticks went very well this weekend. Many students from obviously higher classes attended and quite a few got completely wasted. Party was about to end around 1AM but Remus and Sirius decided to sneak out earlier so they don't have to deal with drunk James who always tried to make it till the morning ending up being just annoying instead falling asleep in weird places. </p><p>Wolfs were best friends. Not only because of their secret but also because of sharing the same dorm room. And one double-bed. Of course it used to be awkward at the beginning but then after few years they grew extremely close. Did majority of things together basically behaving like an old couple without even knowing it. James and Lily had their own suspicions about the two of them but never said anything out loud hoping that maybe they will figure it out by themselves. </p><p>And maybe they were right. Because lately Remus was feeling weird around Sirius. Start noticing things that he hasn't noticed before. Like the softness of his friend's skin or his silky hair. Beautiful, soft face. Lean, perfect body. And the smell. He never quite understood why Sirius smell always made him calm down just kind of run with it throughout those years. But now it was different... his smell made him more... possessive. Quite frankly he could just press other boy's body against the wall and have his way with him but he wouldn't even dare taking his minds that far. Not just yet. </p><p>They were going back to the dorm with Remus' arm around other's shoulders while Sirius' arm around other's waist. They were quite tipsy to say the least. Walking slowly through the fields holding each other's for stability. </p><p>'That was... good... although I enjoy more our little music-talk evenings.' said Remus meaning the times they've been spending by their own in their dorm room just drinking, listening to music and talking. That was definitely typical to Remus' character. No parties, just chill evenings in the comfort of their own room. </p><p>'True. We should do it soon. Maybe next week? I got some whiskey that my father sent me for Christmas. We could celebrate perhaps?' asked dark-haired boy, looking in the other's direction. Actually straight in his eyes. </p><p>Remus on the other hand was way too deep in his head to pay attention to every word coming out of Sirius' mouth. His eyes were going from Black's soft lips back to his eyes. And again back down to his lips. Almost like he was planning to confess right here and there but just didn't have a courage to do so. </p><p>'Mhm, good idea.' he answered softly turning his head a bit more to grab Sirus' shoulders pressing him more against his body and soon after closing his eyes to smash their lips together into a quite messy kiss. Drunkenness of course didn't help the cause therefore Remus' kiss was much harder than he intended to. Slowing the pace of their walk to stop completely after few seconds that felt like eternity he finally moved back to look in his friend's eyes. </p><p>'Woah.' said the other opening his mouth a little. It's not that he didn't notice how his friend was looking at him lately. How all of the sudden he didn't mind all the cuddling in the middle of the cold nights that just few months ago he would quickly refuse. </p><p>'Ye I know. I don't know... I think I like you. I was like... I'm gonna kiss you and if I don't like it I would have known but... ye. It's all good, right?' Lupin was obviously slurring his words not knowing how to describe the new set of feelings. </p><p>'Mhm, it's all good.' said the other in answer smiling softly. He was... a bit relieved actually. Rather than saying anything more he just continued the walk. Picking up the topic from before like nothing happened.</p>
