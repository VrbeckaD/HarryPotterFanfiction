  <span>Luna smiled brightly. “You say that as if I wouldn’t happily walk in any direction with you.”</span>

  <span>“Oh, Luna,” she said, sighing and playing with her hair. Luna caught her hand and drew patterns on her palm with her fingertips, before looking up at her with a warm, gentle expression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can this new direction be a kiss though?” she asked. “You do have such lovely lips, I have been wanting to for quite some time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny’s breath caught in her throat, and she felt her face heat up. Luna only looked more delighted, and touched her cheeks. “I’ve made you blush, how lovely.”</span>
