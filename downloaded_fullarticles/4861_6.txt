  <b>HOGWARTS  |  ENGLAND</b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The rain pelted the school, the air icy cold. Students huddled in their common rooms, silent save for a few panicked whispers as they listened to shouts and screams float in from outside the walls. James Potter cast his eyes around, searching for two of his friends who sat apart from all the other Gryffindors. Remus Lupin and Lily Evans were deep in an argument, both whispering furiously, but clutching each other’s arms all the same. James only spared a brief moment to question whether they’d ever tell everyone their secrets, whatever they were. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A lightning bolt flashed across the sky, lighting up the common room in a harsh white light. A first year squealed in fright, and instantly, Remus was there, calming the girl down. Lily followed, smiling reassuringly at the younger kids. James wondered if anyone else could tell how frightened the two third years were. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The hand on his shoulder tightened and James turned to Peter Pettigrew and Sirius Black, the former of whom had started trembling slightly. Sirius noticed the same time he did, and drew the boy closer to his side, leaning slightly against James. The three boys shivered together, waiting. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James swore hours had passed before something happened. Many students were nodding off, though they only relaxed slightly. Even in sleep, they kept firm holds of their wands. Peter was among them, head on Sirius’s shoulder. The two black-haired boys were tired, though they stayed awake with Lily and Remus, both of whom kept standing on the balls of their feet, wand at the ready. When the portrait opened with a bang, they were both in the front of the now-awake and frightened children, with a few older kids with them. Even when Professor McGonagall ran forward, slamming the portrait door closed behind her, they didn’t relax. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The aged lady looked around at her students, all of whom stared at her in hope. She swallowed before shaking her head. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Dumbledore is dead,” she whispered, though her voice carried through the silent room. “Hogwarts has fallen.” She nodded at two third-years who stood erect at her side. “It’s time.” Instantly, sobs and gasps breaking out though many of her students only looked at her in confusion.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Professor, you can’t mean -” Gideon Prewett cut his brother’s protest off by pulling his arm as McGonagall turned her pained face towards him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But it was all hypothetical!” A prefect argued, clinging to his partner. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you mean?” A sixth year called out, voicing the question on many people’s minds. No one answered him however, as Remus and Lily traveled through the room. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Half-bloods to me!” Remus shouted, just as Lily said, “Muggle-borns, get your packs.” Slowly, the students in question ran up to their rooms, coming down with a backpack each, bundled in jackets. As the comprehension dawned on some of the purebloods, many were still left in the dark. James lept up, pushing his way to Remus. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Remus, what is going on!” He shouted, trying to reach his friend. The brunet turned to him, apology written on his face. He reached over and clutched James’ shoulder in a tight grip. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“James, we’re leaving. I can’t explain - it’s for your own good,” he added desperately as the other boy’s face contorted to horror and anger. “Lily and I - we’ve been working with Dumbledore for the last two years. It’s all planned.” He hesitated, looking at where other purebloods were clutching at their friends, trying to stop them. He looked at Sirius and Peter, as they both struggled to get to them, realization shining on their faces. He focused back on James’ face. “Listen to Slughorn,” he continued quickly. “He’ll explain everything soon enough, but you have to promise me not to do anything stupid. Take care of everyone here.” He pulled the taller boy in for a quick hug. “Thank you for everything. Goodbye James.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He gave one last squeeze before turning away, herding his group towards the fireplace, where Lily was counting everyone up. James watched as he kept stopping, prying friends apart, pulling his sobbing charges along. With a swift stroke of her wand, Lily revealed a passageway behind a tapestry, and with one final look around her beloved home, she led the students down the darkness. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus urged students through, ignoring his friends’ shouts. He glanced at McGonagall who quickly nodded. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Students,” she intoned, and the purebloods were instantly silenced. “Unfortunately we do not have time. Voldemort is here.” She ignored the cries and shudders. “He will not hurt any of you, as long as you do not argue back.” She gazed around, letting each and every one of them to see the pain in her eyes. “Professors Slughorn and Tenny will explain everything. But I beg you all, do not rebel. Do not speak out. From this moment on, those students who left are not muggleborns, but…” here she hesitated. “They are </span>
  <em>
    <span>mudbloods</span>
  </em>
  <span> to you.” Shocked silence greeted her pronouncement but she didn’t wait for them to agree. “Do not follow us. We will collapse the tunnel as we leave. I am proud to have been your professor. For all of you. Be Gryffindors. Be Lions. Be careful.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James stared, taking in the sight of his proud professor with tears brimming her eyes. He didn’t understand how this could be happening. By now all the halfbloods and muggleborns were gone, save for Remus, who was waiting for McGonagall impatiently. He didn’t meet James’ eyes, but instead stared down the passageway, head tilted. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Professor, they’re coming. We have to go now,” he urged suddenly. James figured being a werewolf had some benefits after all. The Head of Gryffindor nodded, turning away from her students to follow the boy down the passageway, the tapestry falling down behind them. Silence once again settled in the common room, only now he reckoned it was a miserable, deadened silence. Not the horror-weighted one from before. He jumped when a hand landed on his shoulder, spinning around to find Sirius and Peter staring at him with the same shock that he felt. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Now what?” Peter whispered, shaking again. Sirius looked to James for help, but James could only wish he had an answer for his friends. </span>
