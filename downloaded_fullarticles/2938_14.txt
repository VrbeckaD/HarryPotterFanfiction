  <p>In less than two weeks, it would have been Christmas and - at the same time - their 4th anniversary, so Ginny asked Harry to do something to celebrate. How she counted their years together was still a mystery. After the Battle they continued to get on and off again, and now it was almost a year together without too many problems. Harry didn’t know what was wrong: he loved Ginny, but sometimes little things annoyed him too much like her way to always hug him from behind squeezing her boobs on his back, or how she always wanted to kiss him and hold his hand in public. Why would someone be so blatant about their relationship? Also, they argued… a lot. For these reasons and so many others, such as sex. Harry knew he had a problem, but he didn’t want to discuss it constantly, for god’s sake! He was convinced that the war and all of those years living in danger and constant vigilance made him put sex in background. Naturally his prick worked perfectly fine, <em> thanksverymuch</em>, he just wasn’t all that interested in having sex or blowjobs or hand jobs or… ok, there was something wrong but that was it and Ginny should have learnt to accept him how he was.</p>
  <p>Anyway, finally, they found a compromise. Sometimes sex was good, Ginny understood love isn’t all about sex, and Harry learnt to care more about her, little presents sometimes without reason, a hug, a kiss on the cheek when they were out with their friends, and things like that. But this was too much: a week in the Italian Alps in a fucking mountain retreat at 6.560 feet of altitude, with spa, thermal treatments, skiing equipment, Ron and Hermione.</p>
  <p> </p>

  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>He loved them, but they were insufferable together in close spaces for more than 2 hours, no wonder an entire week. … guess their friends had a point when they said he was no more capable of fun and he was always grumpy. That’s why in the end he said he’d go.</p>
    <p>But that didn’t mean he couldn’t complain about it in his mind, drinking a glass of good Ogden’s Old Firewhiskey in his favorite chair of the living room.</p>
    <p>
      <em> <strong>December 21st, 2003 – The day before the holiday</strong> </em>
    </p>
    <p>“Haaaaarry, looooove!” Ginny’s voice came from the bedroom while Harry was brushing his teeth in the bathroom. “Have you finished your suitcase? It seems a bit empty!”. Harry wiped his mouth, sighed and left the bathroom. “Honey you know I am a light traveler, don’t worry, it’s all packed,” he said entering their bedroom.</p>
    <p>Ginny was beautiful that night, with her black silken nightdress and her high ponytail. It made her facial traits sharper and he liked that. Maybe it could be one of <em> those </em> nights. Harry walked over to the bed and sat down, bringing Ginny on top of himself. She looked surprised but quickly regained control of herself and smiled to Harry: “You’re pushing tonight”. “It’s just that you’re beautiful Gin.” He kissed her and switched their positions so that now Ginny was lying on the bed and Harry was on top of her. His cock was still flaccid, but Ginny knew how to deal with it: she turned so that her ass was pushing to his prick and started rolling her hips. If there was something Harry really couldn’t resist, it was taking her from behind, on all fours.</p>
    <p>Harry felt his cock filling with every roll of her hips until he pulled her from the waist so that she was on all fours and he undressed her. With a hand he shoved his own pajama bottoms down together with his pants and conjured some lube… “No, wait!” Ginny called “I don’t want to do it like that, Harry, fuck! I don’t want to give you my ass, I want to have properly sex!”. Ginny sounded angry and Harry didn’t know what to say. “But…you said you like it!” he still had his hand covered with lube. “Yes, but not always, for merlin! It’s acceptable sometimes, but I’d really love to have sex like normal couples from time to time”. Ok, that was reasonable, but …</p>
    <p>“Oh my god!” she shrieked “your cock is already soft! What the fuck, Harry!”.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="aentry-post__block--unstyled">
  <p>“What did you expect? You’re shouting at me, it’s not the most comfortable thing in the world…” Ginny sighed heavily and with trembling voice said: “I can’t understand what the problem is, Harry. Don’t you like me? It almost seems like you don’t want to see me in the face during sex and I’m so tired of this." She had tears at the corner of her eyes and Harry felt like he was the worst human being on Earth. “Of course, I like you Ginny, don’t even think about it! It’s just… I… I can’t really explain what it is, I’m so sorry.” With that he took a pillow and a blanket and went sleeping on the couch. Ginny remained in the bedroom, sobbing quietly.</p>
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>Next morning was the one of the departure. Harry didn’t sleep a minute that night. He always had problems sleeping even after the Battle, because of nightmares and a generalized anxiety and it got worse when he had an argument with Ginny. During nights like these he usually thought of everything, with mixed feelings.</p>
    <p>He thought about the years with the Dursley and how they mistreated him; he didn’t know that when he was a child but starvation, segregation, isolation from peers… they abused him in the true sense of the word. Then he got lucky because he found out he was a wizard and entered a completely new world where he was rich and had friends and… there was a maniac who tried to kill him every year.</p>
    <p>He had fun playing Quidditch, going to Hogsmeade, with his friends in the dormitories, but deeply he always had death breathing on his neck, he always lived with fear, misunderstandings, half-truths.</p>
    <p>Then he thought about the war, the fear of losing the loved ones, a fear that turned out to be founded, the constant feeling of guilt in his gut. He couldn’t help but feeling like he owed the wizarding world the losses of the war because he couldn’t do better and couldn’t defeat Voldemort alone.</p>
    <p>Then there were the death eaters’ trials where everyone wanted something from him: pity, justice, help, a hand to shake, his opinion on matters. And he just didn’t feel up to the task, he wasn’t a hero, he was just a seventeen years old guy, he didn’t hold the truth in his hands and he couldn’t help everyone.</p>
    <p>Draco Malfoy’s trial was one of the hardest and still resounded in his head. Harry was so torn between believing he deserved a second chance and thinking he did very bad things for which he deserved punishment. He knew Malfoy had the influence of his father, but it wasn’t like he hadn’t a choice; it was still true that a crazy man threatening you and your family didn’t help making a different choice. In the end, he testified for him and he was happy he did. But Malfoy seemed seriously in a sorry state and Harry simply couldn’t avoid feeling useless. Moreover, there was that time in the bathroom at Hogwarts. Harry still thought that maybe if he hadn’t reacted so badly, maybe he could have helped him. He seemed in serious difficulty and pain; he could have offered some help. However, they were hard times even for him and they certainly weren’t on good terms, it would have been a hard choice to stop and talk to Malfoy. Now though, with everyone thinking at him like a saint, he was retracing his steps, and everything seemed confused and variable and in a gray area.</p>
    <p>Finally, there was all the anxiety derived from the expectations people had on him, even now, 5 years after Voldemort. Everyone wanted him to be an Auror and he joined them, he really wanted to be one, but then they made him Head of Team, after only a year on the field, and expected him to be always perfect, impeccable, resolute, with a happy life, a happy wife, children and he just couldn’t breathe if he thought about those things all together.</p>
    <p>Fuck, these were the worst nights. Nothing could help him, not teas nor herbs or potions. He would just lay awake, with his heart rate raising, his breathing hard and difficult, his chest aching like he was holding inside a big monster that tried to escape tearing his ribs apart and he wouldn’t sleep.</p>
    <p>But he was leaving for a holiday, it was supposed to calm one’s nerves, right? Right.</p>
    <p>
      <em> <strong>December 22nd, 2003 - First day of holiday</strong> </em>
    </p>
    <p>Hermione knew. She always knew when there was something wrong with Harry. Ginny and he arrived at the Portkey point without talking or holding hands, they weren’t even looking at each other.</p>
    <p>With their gruesome faces they arrived in Italy at 2 p.m. and started arguing almost immediately.<br/> “I can’t understand why we took a Portkey if now we have to do a 3 hours walk to arrive at our retreat! We could have arrived directly there!” Ginny was making this complaint since they first booked the Portkey.<br/> “Because there’s no point in going to a mountain retreat if you don’t take a proper look at the landscape! I’ve never gone to a White Week before, I’d like to experience it in the right way!” Harry was so fed up with this argument and with having to explain himself. If she didn’t want to do this walk, she could have taken another Portkey arriving at the retreat by herself. When he pointed this out, even Ron had a reproachful face: “It’s supposed to be something you do together mate.”</p>
    <p>Thus, when they finally arrived there, after 3 long and silent hours of walk, Harry was already thinking about coming back home. They all checked-in together and went to their rooms, which were adjacent, to unpack the suitcases. After Harry finished unpacking, he sat on the bed; Ginny was in the bathroom taking a shower after the <em> “horrible and absolutely useless walk” </em>. He was thinking a way to live peacefully the next six days when he heard a knock on the door. He went to open it and he found Hermione looking at him with a concerned smile on her face and a book: “Fancy a tea in the entrance hall? I said Ron I wanted to read to get rid of him.” She winked and made a nod of encouragement to Harry. He scribbled a note to Ginny “went reading with Hermione” and followed her to the lobby.</p>
    <p>It was lovely: entirely made of wood with a fire place and big armchairs in circles around little tea tables. On every armchair there was a blanket and on the tables some books. It was cozy and there was this vague scent of chamomile in the air that made Harry instantly relax. He always liked the smell of chamomile. They quietly sat on two armchairs besides the fire place and Harry looked outside the windows: there was a big snowy Pine tree decorated with Christmas lights of all colors. He saw it when they arrived, but he couldn’t give it proper consideration since he was glooming about his argument with Ginny, but it was truly beautiful. Harry always loved Christmas trees, they cheered him up and remembered him of Hogwarts, the first place where he learnt to love (not only Christmas). They asked the keeper two hot teas and when they arrived, Hermione took a sip and looked at Harry very carefully.</p>
    <p>“Listen, I know there’s something wrong between you and Ginny. I’d like to talk about it Harry, you know you can be honest with me”.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="aentry-post__block--unstyled">
  <p>He didn’t truly know what to say; he loved Hermione and at this point he was grateful she and Ron were here with them, but he was always uncomfortable talking about whatever-was-it with Ginny and so he went defensive: “Nothing ‘Mione, we often fight, you know that, you and Ron are the same.” Wrong thing to say, he knew that, but he couldn’t help it.</p>
  <p>“Oh Harry, it’s not me and Ron we’re talking about. It’s not just that you fight, it’s that you can’t even look at her face!”</p>
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>“That’s not… I… err, I don’t know if I can talk about it with you Herm.”</p>
    <p>“Why? What is it?”</p>
    <p>“Err.. it’s just.. we never talked about things like these before, have we?” Harry was blushing and started feeling hot and he was ready to blame it on the fire place.</p>
    <p>“Which <em> things </em> Harry?” She narrowed her eyes at him.</p>
    <p>“…sex and stuff”. He murmured with a low voice, looking intently at his mug. They never talked about things like that and it was silly, actually. They shared so much in the tent during the hunt of horcruxes, but it simply wasn’t an argument that came up frequently between them.</p>
    <p>“Oh.” She seemed surprised. “Ok. Would you prefer to talk to Ron?” She was starting to blush too and she moved as if to stand up.</p>
    <p>“No! God, no. Ron is even worse, he’s always so prudish and he never talks about these things. Neither at school, with Seamus, Dean and the others. They talked about sex and Ron would always stay quiet, not joining the conversation. I mean… I mean, of course he knew stuff, we all saw him with Lavender. I mean, oh Merlin, I just mean he doesn’t talk about things if not in an ironic and funny way. Oh! Not that I think it’s funny between you, it’s just.. err.” Harry had his hands on his eyes and he was red in the face like a tomato and when he looked at Hermione she had crinkles at her eyes and a hand on her mouth as if she…was restraining from laughing! What idiots they were! They shared a look and started laughing so much they had tears at their eyes.</p>
    <p>After a moment Hermione calmed herself, took a deep breath and tried to regain control. “Ok, sex is the problem. We can talk about it!”</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="aentry-post__block--unstyled">
  <p>“Yes. Ok, yes. It’s weird. But yeah, I’ll need to talk with someone sooner or later.” Harry wiped his eyes with the sleeve of his hoodie and took a sip of his tea now cold. He cleared his throat and tried again: “Do you and Ron do it… frequently?”</p>
  <p>“Emh, ok so now we’re blunt. You’re funny Harry. What do you mean by "frequently"? We do it a reasonable amount, I suppose. Ow, this is weird.” She paused for a moment laughing lightly and Harry was relieved they could talk about it. “It’s something that comes naturally, isn’t it? At first, after the war, we… well, we were doing it all the time. I think it was something like &lt;we are free now, we have to recover lost time&gt;. Now we’ve settled, and we live together and it’s more &lt;we have all the time to do it, it’s not the end of the world if we wait tomorrow&gt;.”</p>
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>“Mmmmh.. ok, ok. Once a month could be considered normal?”</p>
    <p>“Harry, it’s not about how many times you do it, but how it is when you do it. Do you enjoy it? Do you want to do it?” Harry couldn’t understand how, but she always knew the right thing to say.</p>
    <p>“I… don’t know. I honestly can’t answer you. I like Ginny, I really do, but I just don’t want to have sex with her all the time. I don’t… I don’t particularly enjoy it or blowjobs or.. and oh my god you’re thinking I’m weird and asexual or things.”</p>
    <p>“Harry, relax and take a deep breath. I don’t think you’re weird or things. When you say you like Ginny… do you like her as a sister or more? Because Harry if you’re no more in love with her it’s okay, it happens sometimes. You thought it was love and then it was just a deep friendship. We wouldn’t judge you and it would be better to be happy apart than sad together.”</p>
    <p>Sad together. It was strong to hear. “Hermione.. she’s Ron’s sister.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t be stupid! It would be difficult for Molly and Arthur and maybe even for Ron, they love you together, but you are part of their family and you know that. They wouldn’t kick you out!”</p>
    <p>“Ok let’s say we break up. And I search for someone else,” Harry hesitated a minute to find the right words, “what if I don’t like it with them too? Herm, I really doesn’t feel those kinds of things when I look at women. And I’ve tried seeing porn too, you know. But I just didn’t enjoy it enough…” saying it was harder than he thought.</p>
    <p>“Mh. Harry, have you ever thought that maybe you’re not into women?” from the way her eyes lighted up, Hermione seemed amused by this. Harry pulled a face: she shouldn’t be, she was supposed to help him and comfort him, not to mock him!</p>
    <p>“Hey! You should be by my side!” They were laughing together when the door of the entrance hall opened and a noisy group of friends entered laughing, covered in snow. Harry and Hermione turned their faces to them and their mouths dropped open.</p>
    <p>Just there Draco Malfoy, Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott and Gregory Goyle were walking through the hall towards the rooms.</p>
    <p>Harry and Hermione looked at each other with widened eyes and darted to their rooms. They arrived just a minute after the Slytherin gang reached a room at the end of the corridor. Harry went inside his room while Hermione went to call Ron to later re-group in Harry and Ginny’s room. But when Harry entered his room, he found Ginny curled up on the bed with her knees bent over her chest and her head rested on them. When she felt Harry’s arrival she looked up and she had red shiny eyes, like she finished cried just a moment ago. “Merlin! What happened Gin?” Harry run to her, sitting on the bed and enveloping her in a tight hug. She propped her head on his shoulder and calmly told him she wasn’t happy. She wanted to, she had always wanted to be with Harry and now she just couldn’t keep on like this. She missed his friend Harry.</p>
    <p>And Harry had no words. He could understand her, of course he could, but he was shocked too. He always thought that <em>he</em> was the problem, that <em>he</em> had the problem, while Ginny was fine.</p>
    <p>“I’m sorry Gin. I didn’t know you were so unhappy, and I feel such a shit I didn’t see it. I don’t want you to be sad.”</p>
    <p>She raised her head and looked him in the eyes: “Are you happy Harry?” It was a tough question and he had to look away to answer her: “Sometimes I think I can’t be happy anymore Ginny.” She hugged him tighter and whispered: “You’ll be and I don’t want to lose you. Promise me.”</p>
    <p>“Never, I promise. I just need to figure out things, I believe. This won’t be easy Ginny but I love you and I can’t imagine not staying friend with you.”<br/> “Me neither, Harry.” They remained silent for a bit, holding onto each other.<br/> When the silence became overwhelming, Harry tried for small conversation: “There’s a beautiful Pine right outside this retreat, have you seen it? It gives me such strong Christmas vibes, I like it.”</p>
    <p>“Oh, I didn’t see it. I guess we aren’t living a proper Christmas this year, but I’ll check for it later.” Ginny got up and went to the bathroom to clean her face and her voice came from there: “Oh Harry, what were you doing with Hermione?”. Shit! Malfoy!</p>
    <p>“Ginny, I almost forgot! Hermione and I, we had a news for you guys. You’ll never guess who we met in the entrance hall. And.. where are she and Ron? She said they would have immediately reached us.”</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="aentry-post__block--unstyled">
  <p>“Ah, I was talking with Ron while you were gone. I’m sorry Harry but he understood something was off and he wanted to talk. He helped me so much but then I asked him to leave me alone to talk with you, so I think they’re waiting for us. Who did you meet?”</p>
  <p>“I’ll call them and we’ll tell you together! It’s big news!” Harry quickly went to call Ron and Hermione and together they reached Ginny.</p>
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>“What? What is it? Harry, if it’s for the break up, I already know. I’m sorry but if you weren’t happy together then…”</p>
    <p>“Ron, maybe we’ll have this conversation in private, yes? Now, big news. Have you told him ‘Mione?” Harry was so eager to share who was right there right now with them.</p>
    <p>“No Harry, I was waiting for you” Hermione said between laughs and smirks.</p>
    <p>“Good! We saw Malfoy in the entrance hall!” Harry shouted it and Ginny and Ron looked between him and Hermione, opening and closing their mouths without saying anything.</p>
    <p>“Oh Merlin’s tits Harry, are you bloody kidding me? What is he doing here alone? Do you think he’s spying on us?”</p>
    <p>“No Ron, he’s not alone, there are also Parkinson, Goyle, Nott and Zabini with him. They didn’t see us.”</p>
    <p>“So what, do we have to share time with them? Say “hello” and drink tea with them in the hall? They’ll ruin our holiday! I don’t like this, it seems like a conspiracy to me!”</p>
    <p>“Ron don’t be silly. We’ll surely say hello, we’re not barbarians and the war finished years ago. We can be civil and it’s not like we have to spend time together. We probably won’t meet each other for a long time. Now get a move, I’m starving!”</p>
    <p>“Man, she still scares me sometimes, you know.” Ron whispered to Harry and he smiled because he could count on them to be the same good friends they always were during school. Harry turned to Ginny and she smiled at him. It was a stretched smile: the next six days would have been hard, but he knew he could always count on her too.</p>
