    <p>Luna was dragged by the hair from the corridor she had been found in. It was late and she couldn't tell through the blur of darkness and patches of moonlight who was dragging her at first. The graffiti she had left behind, sporting slogans like "DA Still recruiting" and "Potter Lives" had been a relatively minor crime. But under the new regime there was no such thing. Particularly given her past misdemeanours and her father's controversial stance on Harry in the Quibbler. Luna heard a mewling noise nearby and twisted her head painfully to catch sight of Mrs Norris staring up at her. Now she knew who's hand was wrapped tightly in her hair. The wheezing breath confirmed it: she'd been found by Filch and he was taking her down to his new office. They'd heard days before about the rearrangements. With Snape vacating his dungeon rooms in favour of the Headmaster's study Filch had moved into the subterranean chamber s and taken all his things with him. A few students had spotted the various chains and other foul things that Filch had kept for years without ever being allowed to use them. Even under Umbridge, when he'd been given the go-ahead to punish the Weasley twins they had never gotten far enough to actually go through with it. Surely they wouldn't do it now. </p><p>The office door banged open and Luna was shoved through it and dropped roughly to the floor. Filch muttered to himself as Luna remained prone, catching her breath. "Now... now... where are we... ah... yes... No more of your shit... I'm done with playing nice... all these years and Dumbledore never once let me hurt one of you... but now..." The relish with which he spoke made Luna more afraid than she had felt in a very long time. He lifted her face to his and said with a horrible grin, "I think there are others who'd like to help me with you, girl. I'll call them." Filch went over to a large fireplace at the very end of the room, took some floo powder from a pot on the mantelpiece , cast it into the embers and cried, "Professors Carrow!" Out of the emerald flames the danced for a moment in the alcove stepped Alecto and Amycus Carrow, both smirking widely. </p><p>"You called, Mr Filch?" Filch pointed to Luna who knelt on the cold stone floor staring at the three of them. "Ah, I see." Smiled one with a grin. "An example must be made." Giggled the other. Amycus raised his wand and Luna flinched, ready to hear a cry of "Crucio." I didn't come. Instead, Amycus muttered, "Evanesco" and Luna felt her body temperature drop as her clothes vanished. She gasped in the combined cold and embarrassment. Alecto chuckled as she marched over to Luna. "Very nice..." sh observed as she circled Luna, taking in her pale, smooth skin, her rounded arse and the sides of her large, white tits, partially obscured by her protective arms and hanging blonde hair. Alecto twirled her wand and a collar and chain burst from the tip. "Put it on, girl," she ordered and Luna obeyed. As soon as the leather was round Luna's throat Alecto tugged hard, making the girl cough. She dragged Luna to a stool. A hand pushed her down so her ample chest was squashed agaist the surface of the stool, pressing out at the sides, and her arms hugged the legs. "Stay as you are" instructed Alecto's voice, "Mr Filch, are you doing the honours?" Addressing Luna once more, "Listen, bitch, when you are punished you will thank Mr Filch and beg him for more, do you understand?" Luna gulped, her throat very dry. A resounding slap connected with her bare bum and Luna hissed in pain. "I said, do you understand?"<br/>
"Y-yes." Luna said weakly, through the pain.<br/>
"Good..." crooned the Death Eater. At some unseen signal Luna heard a swoosh through the air and a split second later the whip connected with her back. She screamed. Her face was slammed into the stool with tremendous force and her nose began to bleed. "You're supposed to thank Mr Filch and ask for more."<br/>
"I-I'm sorry," sobbed Luna.<br/>
"Then do as you're told."<br/>
The whip came down again, hitting Luna's arse and as she moaned in pain she cried, "Thank you sir, I'd like more, please." She heard the laughs of all three and felt the whip again. "Thank you sir, I'd like more, please." Now she felt strong hands on the back of her legs and her knees were prised apart. Luna sobbed harder. The whip whooshed again and struck her directly on the lips of her sex. Luna felt sideways, howling and curled herself up. to protect what little she could.<br/>
"Tut, tut," came the voice Amycus, "perhaps a greater punishment is in order for the girl's disobedience..."<br/>
"I think so..." Wheezed Filch. </p><p>Alecto tugged on the collar to bring Luna to her knees again. "Have you ever had an orgasm, girl?" Luna looked shocked "Well, have you?"<br/>
"Yes... yes I have..." Whispered Luna.<br/>
"Who granted you it?"<br/>
"I-I did it myself..." Alecto's hand raked across her face.<br/>
"Little whore, masturbation is a disgusting sin. Only others can give you orgasms. I only permit my brother," she gestured to Amycus, "to give me mine."<br/>
She pulled Luna across the room and lay her across a long wooden table. Her legs were bent roughly into a painful angle and another piece of wood was slammed down onto her so that her legs could not move. Luna's lower torso was completely separated from the rest of her body. Her head was curved back, off the edge of the table, her breasts exposed upwards and wobbling from the force of her traetment, observed by the two men greedily. She whined in fear, knowing how exposed she was, unable to protect her herself from anything to come.</p><p>And come it did.</p><p>To be continued...</p>
