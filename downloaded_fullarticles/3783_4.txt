</center><br/><p>It was all Credence Barebone’s fault! Ever since he appeared in Wane’s cell and mentioned Scar, he’d been haunted by that idiot. In his dreams or awake as his mind slipped between reality and something else, Scar would appear and make all sorts of stupid comments. Just like he used to do in the past, before the war, before he died.</p><p>“He did have a point though,” Scar commented casually, sitting cross-legged on Wane’s cot while Wane restlessly paced the small room, “you never did believe in anything. You were just in it to advance your own powers without any real goal to it. You’re no leader; you didn’t want to replace Grindlewald, you merely wanted more; like a greedy child.”</p><p>Trying to ignore the ghost and failing, Wane suddenly spun around to face him. “Shut up! For the love of Merlin, just shut up! You were annoying in real life and dying has, if possible, only made you even more obnoxious! I’m not interested in what you got to say. Scar is dead! You’re only something my mind has made up!”</p><p>Shrugging, Scar rested one elbow on his knee and his chin in his palm. “Maybe I’m your subconscious telling you truths you don’t want to face?”</p><p>“What I want,” Wane snapped, “is for you to shut up and go away!”</p><p>“Obviously not,” Scar grinned, “as I’m still here. If I’m really a figment of your mind, you created me and you’re keeping me here. Did you really miss me that much?”</p><p>Stalking towards the cot, Wane leaned close to sneer at him. “You should be glad you’re not real, or I’d kill you myself right now!”</p><p>Scar’s grin widened. “Temper, temper,” he tutted. “No wonder they’ve kept you in isolation for twenty years. I’m amazed they don’t keep you sedated all the time, but maybe they enjoy hearing you scream as they do their experiments on you?”</p><p>Wane’s restraint snapped and he acted before realizing it would be futile; throwing a punch straight at Scar’s smirking face. </p><p>It was hard to say which one of them had the most surprised expression on their face after Scar lifted a hand to pretend to catch the fist and a shockwave of magic shot out from the impact of Wane’s hand hitting his palm. Lights flickered and sparks flew from electrical sockets. Wane and Scar were merely staring at where the fist was caught in a very real hand.</p><p>“What…” Scar began, whispering. “What just happened…?”</p><p>Wane’s gaze moved up from their hands to stare at Scar’s face. “You’re… real?” How was that possible? He’d never been real before! He’d seen the man appear and disappear like the ghost he was. At one memorable occasion, Wane had thrown a book at him and it had gone straight through his face!</p><p>Scar released him and placed his hands against his own torso as if to check for himself. “I don’t…” He went back to stare wide-eyed at Wane. “What did you do?”</p><p>-</p><p>“I didn’t do anything, you moron! You’re the one who has changed!” Wane held his hands up in front of him and shook them, making the chains around his wrists rattle. “And I’m wearing these, so I couldn’t do anything, even if I wanted to!”</p><p>“You must have done something!” Scar accused, his voice rising along with his agitation.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the surreal situation, Wane would have loved to watch the unflappable Scar freak out, but as luck would have it; he was too busy freaking out himself to pay attention to it.</p><p>“There is no way I could have…” Wane began, close to shouting now, but his voice fell silent as he saw something that explained what had happened, even if he didn’t know ‘how’ it had happened. “Oh no,” he whispered, the situation going from bad to worse.</p><p>“What?!” Scar snapped.</p><p>Wane reached out and grabbed a hold of Scar’s left and very real wrist, drawing his attention to his hand and the black smoke emerging from it.</p><p>“What…?” Scar repeated, his voice now soft with horror.</p><p>“That’s Obscurus-magic,” Wane mumbled, torn between morbid curiosity and dread. “That’s MY Obscurus-magic!”</p><p>Scar yanked his hand free and glared at him. “Take it back!”</p><p>“I would if I knew how to!” Wane countered angrily. “You’re not worthy of such a gift! I bled for those powers! I earned them!”</p><p>“Well, I don’t want them!” Scar exclaimed. He glanced nervously at the door, hearing distant shouting. “Oh, Morgana… The guards… Why did you mess with the lights too? I don’t want to end up like a science experiment thanks to you, Bathory!”</p><p>“While I love the idea of you suffering at their hands, I don’t relish the thought of them getting their hands on MY Obscurus.” Wane huffed a humorless laugh. “Ok, Scar, these are the facts; somehow you’ve managed to steal my Obscurus-powers, making yourself corporal, and you’re stuck in the basement with a whole bunch of Unspeakables who would love to pick you apart. Maybe they’ll enjoy listening to you scream as well as me? You can either take your chance with them, or… we get the hell out of here. Now.”</p><p>“And how do you expect me to achieve that?” Scar replied through gritted teeth. “I don’t have a wand and that is supposing I’m alive enough to actually cast spells!”</p><p>“You don’t need a wand or common magic,” Wane said, “because you ‘are’ magic now. Use your new powers, idiot.”</p><p>“I don’t know how!”</p><p>“I suggest you hurry up and find out, because those guards will be here any minute…” Wane crossed his arms and sent him a faint smile. “Tic tock, Scar.”</p><p>Getting up and jumping off the cot, Scar glared at him. “And, by the way, ‘we’? What ‘we’? I’m getting out of here and you can stay where you belong. Give me one good reason why I should bring you along.”</p><p>Wane clenched his jaw angrily. “Because,” he said, “those are MY powers that you stole and without me you won’t have a chance of controlling them. This is very different from Barebone’s Obscurus, so he can’t help you either. Do you want to risk turning into a monster?”</p><p>Scar hesitated, but then there were some distant shouting and he snapped out of it. “Fine. For now.” He turned to the door, clenching and unclenching his hands. “Okay… Let’s see what I can do…”</p><p>-</p><p>“Hurry!” Wane hissed, hearing the guards approaching. Minutes had passed and they were still stuck.</p><p>“I’m trying!” Scar hissed back, hands outstretched towards the door. “It’s not working!”</p><p>“You’re doing it wrong then!” Wane stepped closer, hovering. “Tap into the powers. Break the damn door down!”</p><p>“I should have expected that something you created would be this shitty!” Scar snarled, shaking his hands before holding them towards the door again. “I’m telling you; it’s not working!”</p><p>“There is nothing wrong with my powers! You’re clearly the problem! If it was me, I’d have that door down ages ago!”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>“You always thought you were so much better than me, and now you can’t knock down a single door.” Wane leaned closer as he heard one of the guards unlocking the door. “Not so smug now that you know they’ll tear us apart and it’ll be your fault?”</p><p>“SHUT UP!” Scar shouted, furious, and a wave of darkness shot out from him; sending the door flying off its hinges and slamming into the two guards outside the room.</p><p>For a moment both Scar and Wane merely stared at where the door was lying in the hallway and the unconscious guards half-hidden underneath it, but then Wane raised an eyebrow. “Ok. Not bad.”</p><p>Scar rolled his eyes and stepped into the hallway. “Let’s just get out of here before more guards show up.”</p><p>Wane followed him. “You know, this would be a lot easier if you would just remove these damn chains.”</p><p>“Yeah, no, I don’t think so,” Scar mumbled, carefully making his way down the hallway. “I don’t trust you. Besides, you have no wand, so better to keep the fighting to the professionals.”</p><p>“What professionals?” Wane snarled. “You could barely knock down a door and have no idea how you use your powers.”</p><p>“Keep talking, Wane, and I’ll change my mind and just leave you behind.”</p><p>Wane fell silent. But he did make sure to glare at Scar’s back the entire way.</p><p>Against all odds, and much thanks to the confusion after the flickering lights and electrical hiccups, they made it outside the massive building disguised as a hospital. Once outdoors, the two walked away at a brisk but not overly suspicious pace. </p><p>It was only when they were two blocks down and having rounded a building that they dared to exhale and actually look at each other.<br/>
Now what?</p><p>-</p><p>“Listen,” Scar began, holding up a hand to silence Wane as the other man was about to speak, “this is what is going to happen now. You and I? We’re going our separate ways from here. Like I said; I don’t trust you. Hell, I don’t even like you, Wane, and I’d prefer to spend my second chance at life as far away from you as possible. I let you tag along because I resent the Ministries and for old times’ sake, but from now on you’re on your own, okay?”</p><p>Wane’s eyes glittered with something dangerous, but he merely put on a cheerful smile. “Am I happy that you are walking away with my powers? Of course not. But the thought of you as far away from me as possible is worth it.” He lifted his hands up to his chest. “Before you go, mind freeing me of these?”</p><p>Scar pursed his lips thoughtfully. “Noo… I don’t think so.” He grinned. “Something tells me I’d be safer with you in them while I make my escape. I have no doubt you’ll get out of them.” He added a wink. “Eventually.”</p><p>And with that, the man with eyes as black as his hair sauntered off and left a seething Wane Bathory to stalk in the opposite direction.</p><p>Walking down the street, Wane was soon calming down and absently observing how much the world had changed in the twenty years he’d been locked up. He was also dreaming of all the different ways he could murder Scar on a later occasion. </p><p>At first he didn’t really react to the throbbing sensation in his head, but it slowly grew worse and more insistent. And then the moment came where he had to stop and pinch the bridge of his nose as it suddenly felt like his sinuses were about to implode.</p><p>The throbbing abruptly turned to the mother of all headaches. In addition, he started to feel dizzy and very cold; as if his very body heat was being drained out of him. Groaning softly, he pressed his palms against his eyes and swayed on his feet. What was going on? What was happening to him?</p><p>In the darkness of his closed eyes, Wane had a flash of Scar leaning against a brick wall; barely able to stand and in agony. And just like that; Wane knew he had to find him or they’d both perish. </p><p>Turning around, he stumbled, half-blind, in the direction he knew Scar was. How he knew, he had no idea, but he knew.</p><p>As slowly as it had begun, the headache began to ease as he walked and finally he could see a familiar figure stagger his way towards him as well. When Scar came to an unsteady halt in front of him, they both turned their backs to the brick wall they were standing next to and sank down to sit on the pavement, shoulder to shoulder, ignoring the odd looks sent by people walking by them.</p><p>For a few moments, they sat in silence and recovered; both feeling drained and severely unsettled. </p><p>Eventually Wane couldn’t help himself and glanced over at the pale and weary Scar. “I’m guessing this means going our separate ways is out of the question?”</p><p>Scar could only manage a glare.</p>
