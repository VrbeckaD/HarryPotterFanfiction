    <p>The transport was scheduled to leave at nightfall; that way passengers could sleep through the ten-hour journey, the only relief from travel in cramped craft with hard seats and mandatory five-point-harness restraints. But Harry couldn’t sleep—he was too anxious. He’d been pulled from the field abruptly and wasn't told why. He’d hoped, now that he’d been out of academy six years, he might even be elevated to the next rank. The promotion would have comes as a relief after three years serving just one rank above entry-level infantry. But that obviously wasn’t the reason for his re-deployment. If he was being sent out as the head of a new unit, he wouldn’t be the only non-civilian on the ship.</p><p>Harry got off craft before the civilian class passengers had even woken up. When he stepped into the natural atmosphere, he felt a hint of nausea. He had a strong tolerance after six years of service, but he’d never been to New Earth. His body needed a few moments to calibrate. He waited at the top of the ramp for his stomach to settle and his vision to clear. As it did, he took in his surroundings bit by bit. The air was hot and warm. The massive Fading Sun was grey-silver, emitting a dim white light. It was famous in tales but underwhelming in person.</p><p>Then he took in the rest of the landscape: a vivid green sea of grass that was so dense and even, he imagined walking on it would feel like sinking into a cool pillow. The land rose and fell in gentle hills, with stripes of small trees where the plains knitted together to form waterways. Other than the infrastructure for the dock and the silent hovering transport with its sleeping passengers, they might have been on a fertile and unsettled planet. Harry had grown up in dense settlements and artificial biomes. The sight of so much quiet space gave him a feeling of deep-seeded ease, fed more by instinct than experience. Something inside him, much older than memory, recognized its home.</p><p>“Morning, Potter,” called a voice, drawing Harry from his reverie. He blinked down at the young pre-Captain assigned to meet him. He recognized her from their comms when they made his travel arrangements. Her dark red hair was neatly braided away from a striking face. She stood at the bottom of the dock with her hands in her pockets.</p><p>“Morning, Weasley,” Harry replied with a smile, descending the ramp in a few long strides. Weasley shook his hand. She wore an indicator, which was lit green. Harry was bemused. He had never seen one on someone in uniform, and tried not to blush, instead avoiding a direct look at her throat, the same stilted manner by which he'd try not to stare at an ugly scar. She shot him a quick, sly grin that told him she'd noticed.</p><p>“Another transport will be along for the rest of the passengers. I had a feeling you'd be out early." She gestured behind her at a small, sleek craft. Harry rounded it to the passenger side.

</p>
<p>"Thanks, and yes, I couldn't sleep."

</p>
<p>Weasley nodded. "I bet you're functionally immune to the aerosol sedative they disperse on a civilian-grade vessel like this one."

</p>
<p>Harry smiled absently and didn't answer. The question was obviously rhetorical. Anyone with more than a few months of military training would be. The interior of the small craft was glossy and modern. Harry was surprised by the whir of automated restraints, and held awkwardly still as they slid into place. That a craft this extravagant was being used to taxi him in surprised him. Weasley noticed his reaction.</p><p>“New Earth isn’t like anywhere else,” she said by way of explanation, getting behind the navigation board and keying in a request for manual controls. “We have the funding of the every other outpost combined, to hear the outside Captains complain. I can deactivate your restraint too, if you’d be more comfortable.”</p><p>Harry nodded, relaxing marginally when Weasley touched a command on the panel and the strap across his chest cooled a few degrees as the sensors deactivated. Meanwhile, Weasley maneuvered the manual steering column into position and set the  column for a wide grip.

</p>
<p>The rest of Harry's latent tension left him with a sight. Despite all the statistics that told him he shouldn’t, he preferred manual controls to computer navigation. Weasley had a deft, sure way of grasping the steering mechanism and the advance from the ground was commendably steady. On a craft this size, Harry felt the exhilaration of being close to the engine and the outside environment. Through his window he could clearly see the grass rippling from the centrifugal thrust of the engine's various forces. 

</p>
<p>They advanced another dozen meters before Weasley built a slow but steady acceleration latitudinally, toward the hazy silhouette of an energy chimney in the distance.</p><p>“How long have you been on this post?”</p><p>She glanced at him, her automatic smile fading to a thoughtful frown as she considered. “Well, I’m a legacy, so I grew up on post. But if you mean how long have I had officer status here, the answer is five years. I came straight from Satellite.”</p><p>Harry nodded. “You’re just a class behind me, then. I thought you looked familiar.”</p><p>“You went through with my brother, Ron.”</p><p>Harry frowned, trying to think of a Weasley who would have been in his year, but his classes were large and he’d mostly kept his head down. He had no interest in drawing any attention to himself; being neither seen nor heard had served him well throughout his childhood at his aunt and uncle’s. Now it was a habit he couldn’t shake.</p><p>“I didn’t have a lot of friends.” It seemed like the closest thing to an honest answer which wouldn’t give offense. Weasley smiled again. It was a nice smile, natural and relaxed, revealing straight teeth and emphasizing her slightly pointed chin. Harry’s glance strayed to her indicator, which was still lit, even after several minutes of semi-awkward small talk. He had no idea what he was doing right.</p><p>“That’s what Ron said, when I got this assignment and asked him about you. He also said you were gifted. They thought you’d get recruited to the flyers.”</p><p>Harry grimaced. “I was all right," he hedged. The near-miss of flyers recruitment still stung six year later. "It was the only thing I really enjoyed. So I guess I had a lot to pour into it.”</p><p>Weasley hummed, and eased back on the column of the craft to land it. Then she looked over at a puzzled Harry with a full-on grin. “We have a little extra time before we’re expected,” she said in a conspiratorial murmur. Harry blinked in startled dismay, and knew that this time he couldn’t pretend he wasn’t staring at the indicator.</p><p>“I was going to offer to let you <em>drive</em>,” said Weasley, laughing. Seeing Harry’s mortified reaction, she restrained her laughter and hastened to add, “But no, really. I bet you don’t get a lot of chances, and I do it so often it’s boring.”</p><p>Harry knew from her attitude of reverence in handling the craft that she was far from bored. But he wanted to say yes too badly to argue. They had to de-craft to switch positions; there wasn't room in the cabin. The warm energy of the silent engine made hair rise on the back of Harry's neck, and the grin he shot at Weasley as they passed one another in front of the craft's nose was probably giddy. He slid into the navigation seat, adjusted the column with one hand and buckled himself in with the other at combat-haste speed without even trying. The movements had the ease of an ingrained habit, even if he hadn't flown in several years.</p><p>Harry began maneuvering it at an efficient but conservative pace, like Weasley had. Then she reached across the center console dividing them and pinched him hard. He jumped; he could hardly feel her through the thick fabric of his uniform, but still--had <em>anyone</em> ever pinched him?

</p>
<p>"Don't be boring," she demanded. "Show me something cool." 

</p>
<p>Harry had never been good at backing down from a challenge. The craft wasn’t meant for dynamic flight, but it was small and high quality; it leapt at his touch and turned at his gesture, guided by the flow and angle of his palms. A smile broke out on his face when Weasley made a whooping sound as he maxed out the craft's internal speed limit to get a feel for it. Just before the bay in the chimney’s shadow, there was a ridge that sloped off abruptly, giving him an excuse to gain a little altitude and then dip back to the south, angling the craft perilously near its tipping point and causing the emergency thrust to kick in, which he utilized to force it into a burst of forbidden speed when it leveled out. They made a rapid, tight lap around the chimney that threw them each hard into the left side of their harnesses. When he looked over, worried he’d overstepped, Weasley was pale but grinning back.</p><p>“Not bad, Potter. You’re almost as good as me.”</p><p>Harry laughed and fell back into a conservative flight pattern as they circled back to the chimney, letting the craft coast carefully into the bay. The veridian world outside was abruptly replaced with a standard cube of metallic surfaces, and Harry felt the euphoria of the flight leave him. As soon as it did, all the anxiety he'd been wallowing in on the flight in resettled on his shoulders.</p><p>The light by the column came on to give him the option of reverting to automatic controls for docking, but Harry ignored it. A manual dock was a delicate business, but he liked the thrill of doing so easily what had once seemed impossible. He eased the craft into place and felt a wave of satisfaction when the anchor slid into place beneath them without so much as a hitch; the only sign they’d connected was a barely-audible click and the automated release that freed their restraints. When Harry looked at Weasley again, he found her perplexed.</p><p>“Manual docking? Maybe you <em>are</em> better than me.”</p><p>“You’re the one who brought out the manual controls,” Harry reminded her, oddly self-conscious. He hadn’t meant to show off.</p><p>When they got off the craft, Weasley’s posture changed, alerting Harry to the Captain’s presence before he saw him.</p><p>“Pre-Captains,” said Captain Moody, looking just as terrifying as Harry recalled him from his guest lecture at the academy on Satellite. “Weasley,” he said with a short nod, then turned to Harry. His bionic eye swung around first before its organic counterpart joined it. Harry, unsettled, focused on the natural eye as he reached out to accept the Captain’s wrist-clasp.</p><p>“Potter,” said Moody, frowning like Harry's presence was a surprise. As though he hadn’t been the one to summon Harry there. “I hope you know what you’re getting yourself into.”</p><p>Harry didn’t, actually. He frowned back at Moody. “Captain, I was only told I'd been flagged for an unspecified consult.”</p><p>Moody's bionic eye spun briefly toward Weasley and back again. After a stilted pause Moody barked a laugh, rubbing the back of his neck. “Please, tell me you’re joking.”</p><p>Weasley looked distressed. She touched Harry’s arm. “Are you joking?”</p><p>Harry stared back and forth between them, his cheeks hot. He hated the feeling of not knowing the score. “No,” he said slowly, drawing out the vowel and now wondering if <em>they</em> were joking. It wouldn’t be the first time he was late on the uptake.</p><p>“He must not have gotten the report,” Weasley said to Moody. 

</p>
<p>“There was no report,” Harry said with rising dread. “Just the order. I assumed I was here for relief staffing.” That would be par for the course with Harry’s service. His habit of invisibility meant that he was shuffled around a lot. Everyone got along with him but no one was loathe to part with him.</p><p>“No, Potter,” said Weasley quietly. “You’re here to be evaluated for forging.”</p><p>Harry just looked at her for several beats. He had never considered himself a candidate for forging, and therefore he hadn’t daydreamed about it as some young people did. So he had no emotional reference point. He wasn’t sure whether to be excited or terrified. Pragmatism won out in the end.</p><p>“No,” he said. Moody was focused across the middle distance, but the bionic eye continued to stare. The result made Harry’s head hurt so he looked at Weasley instead. “I’m too old.” Weasley just met his eye with a patient expression and waited for him to work out the answer on his own. Forgings occurred when Improveds were sixteen, with similarly-aged links. The only thing that broke a link was death, as far as Harry knew, but if a link died it was rare for the bonded Improved to survive. Still, it could happen, and there was no other explanation for Harry's presence here. “So this is for a reforging?”</p><p>Weasley and Moody exchanged a swift look. “Not exactly,” said Moody. “Come now, Potter. We’ll show you the report.”</p><p>Harry felt the particular, miserable tension of not understanding. He tried not to let too much of his inner turmoil show on his face as he fell into step alongside Weasley, a few paces behind Moody. They walked through the shadowy sterility of the bay, then through a vacuum chamber into the true interior of the silo.</p><p>New Earth’s superior budget was on display again. There were dozens of false windows in the vaulted space, giving the impression they walked through a tower rather than the first subterranean level of a structure extending deep underground. Harry was too distracted to appreciate any of it, however. The stunning vistas of the green plains, transposed here as though seen from high above, didn’t earn more than a distracted glance.</p><p>“It’ll be alright, Potter,” said Weasley encouragingly. “It’s an honor, you know. I know you're surprised, but it's a <em>good</em> surprise.”</p><p>“Hmm,” said Harry, sweeping a finger down the bridge of his nose to adjust glasses that weren’t there any longer, an old habit. “I’m certainly surprised,” he allowed, then bit his lip.</p><p>“The report will explain a lot,” she assured him, but her eyes were shadowed. “And Moody’ll answer your questions after, if you still have any.”</p><p>They entered a lift which closed them off from the manufactured view and cavernous dimensions of the main column. After they descended, they emerged out into a wide, tubular hallway, which was still softly illuminated to give the semblance of natural light.</p><p>Moody keyed open a chamber just a few paces from the lift, and gestured for Harry and Weasley to precede him inside. There was a table, a depressed place on the wall that was probably the hologram space, and an impressive selection of pastries and warm drinks.</p><p>“We thought you’d be hungry,” Weasley explained. She pulled out a chair for Harry and he was helpless against the compulsion to be polite, so he sat in it. “Do you want me to stay?”</p><p>Harry had the wild urge to demand that <em>she</em> tell him what he’d prefer, since he had absolutely no idea what the report even contained. Weasley's insistence that this was an honor--a "good surprise"--felt contradictory to the way she was looking at him now, like he was about to be asked to identify the body of a friend or family member. As always, though, Harry's urge to accommodate, rather than inconvenience, was too strong to resist. He shook his head with a dismissive gesture and watched her walk out.</p><p>Moody was activating the hologram on the wall. Harry swallowed a wave of nausea, shoving the nearest plate of cookies as far away as possible. The hologram wavered into life, generating an image of a startlingly handsome young man, with flawless fair skin stretched over pronounced cheekbones, hooded dark eyes, and a severe set of black eyebrows which emphasized the elegant arch of his smooth brow. His chin had the hint of a dimple. His full lower lip was captured protruding slightly in a smirk.</p><p>A narrator’s voice, one that Harry recognized as a military standard, emanated from a speaker in the table. “Subject is TMR, in his sixteenth year of life, genetically and hormonally male, latent potential beyond definition.”</p><p>Moody stopped the feed by pointing at it and then looked quizzically at Harry. “Do you know the Broad Scale?”</p><p>Harry knew it existed and that was all, so he settled for an uncomfortable shrug. Moody pointed again and the screen showed a wide three-dimensional chart that gave Harry an immediate headache. Then Moody rattled off a few more commands and the image switched to a simple two-dimensional graph showing the correlation between the population of Improveds and strength of their abilities. At the far right of the graph, past the ninety-ninth percentile which were indicated as “mapped G10” was a narrow blue arrow, beneath which some fine print read, simply, “beyond.”</p><p>“Forged Moon 9, Day 13. Forging did not settle; after period of convalescence, link stabilized. But upon release, emotional health of link swiftly declined. Before staged intervention could commence, link self-terminated.”</p><p>Harry’s eyes widened. Looking at the young man’s image, he felt a wave of pity. He had rudimentary knowledge of Improveds, to be honest, but everyone knew that devotion to their link was embedded within them. It must have been a devastating loss, even so early in the process.</p><p>“Subject psychological narrative,” continued the narrator tonelessly, and the image of a stationary TMR was replaced with recorded images of TMR in what looked very much like Harry’s dormitories at school, with unfamiliar youth around TMR’s age milling around him.</p><p>“Narcissistic; emotional IQ low; cognitive IQ high. Violent tendencies. Link chosen according to criterion 67.”</p><p>Where TMR and his peers had been, criterion 67 appeared. The narrator read the text aloud, as though for emphasis.</p><p>“The violent and mildly sociopathic Improved is best partnered with a link of stable personality and viability as a sexual partner.”</p><p>Harry, who rarely thought about sex with other people, had thought about it much more than he cared to today.</p><p>“TMR is pansexual,” the narrator supplied. “System <em>does</em> have sufficiently detailed profile content to generate likely viability as sexual partner along with biological-link compatibility, given a DNA sample and brain scan.”</p><p>Harry, horrified, distinctly recalled being subjected to an unexpected brain scan recently, and handing over a hair follicle as he filed out. He had assumed it was a new protocol, and hadn’t questioned it. Harry was very good at following orders without thinking about them very hard.</p><p>“First forge: female, first class, sixteen years aged. Settlement period: unknown. Forge terminated when link self-terminated, and bond had not fully settled at such time.”</p><p>Another image appeared, this one of a pretty blond teenager Harry thought of at once as an attractive contrast to TMR. Then he berated himself for even fleetingly connecting the concept of attraction to this report.</p><p>“Protocol 91 applies,” said the narrator. Anticipating correctly that Harry hadn't had the hundreds of Improved management protocols memorized since he was a bored primary school student, the full text of the procol flashed up on the screen.</p><p>“Protocol 91: incomplete forging. Unlike a reforging, which is not time-sensitive, replacing an incomplete forging due to incompatibility, failure of the bond to settle, or premature death of a newly-bonded link must be prompt. The Improved is likely to be lost for want of a bond if not successfully forged within seventy-two hours of the original forging's disruption, assuming prompt transition to stasis.”</p><p>Harry observed an image of TMR in stasis, his arms, legs, and hairless white chest bare, his modesty preserved by a folded blanket. His face looked almost unearthly, softened in repose, the chamber’s glass softening all the sharpness from his features.</p><p>“Subject TMR has been in stasis forty-six hours and was genetically incompatible with three presented candidates, making him eligible for pairing with a nontraditional candidate selected from a pool pre-tested for viability. Brain scan compatibility being of utmost importance as TMR had violent emotional opposition to first link. TMR has been granted a history-based risk score of Z and an asset-potential value of 10, triggering protocol 100.”</p><p>Harry sat up straighter in his chair and felt all the blood draining from his face, leaving him chilled. Even he remembered protocol 100, these many years later, and it was playing through his memory even before it flashed on the screen.</p><p>“Protocol 100: the Z10 link will be granted the supreme privilege upon consignment.”</p><hr/><p>Before Harry could make an official decision, he had to meet TMR.</p><p>The Technicians took TMR out of stasis under protest, but in the end they didn’t have a lot to lose. Harry would either agree, or they would terminate TMR anyway. And Harry made it clear that meeting the boy was a condition of his agreement. Since they hadn’t time to spare, Harry was sitting outside the cryogenic chamber when TMR opened his eyes and sat up as swiftly as, and with the natural tension of, a cat. Harry hadn’t spent much time around raw Improveds, or any Improveds at all, so the ease with which the boy transitioned from stasis to consciousness startled him.</p><p>“Who are you?” demanded TMR. He was looking Harry over with an assessing air, much more composed than he had any right to be. According to the reports as embellished by Moody, he knew very well that his link had hung herself in the lavatory and he was likely to be scheduled for imminent termination.</p><p>“Pre-captain Potter,” Harry said, then added belatedly, “Harry.” The boy’s eyes were brighter than the hologram had let on. In that image, they’d seemed almost black, but here, boring into Harry’s, they were more obviously brown, a rich burnished-gold color, alight with dangerous intelligence. Harry swallowed and felt his heartbeat stutter. Maybe he shouldn’t have been so skeptical about the results of that brain scan.</p><p>“Then you’re the candidate. They wouldn’t let you in here with me on your own, otherwise.” TMR put his head to one side and leaned back on his hands, which tightened all the muscles in his lower torso that disappeared beneath the towel. 
</p><p>He smirked when he saw Harry notice. “Of course you are,” he said more softly, almost purring, and angled his hips toward Harry so that the towel very nearly slipped away, just catching on the sharp angle of his jutting hip-bone. “Aren’t you a lucky boy?”</p><p>The last word broke Harry out of his mesmerized stare, and he looked TMR in the eye and glared. “I’m not the <em>boy</em> here,” he said through gritted teeth. Inadvertently, he reminded <em>himself</em> of TMR's youth as well, and was uncomfortable all over again. Human or otherwise, Harry couldn't reconcile being so drawn to someone who was only sixteen. Harry knew vaguely that people tended to objectify Improveds, since they tended to be physically perfect and consequently appealing. But Harry couldn’t restrain the notion that it was wrong to see TMR that way. He was technically a child. Worse, he was legally subordinate to Harry. </p><p>“I want you to take part in the decision of whether we should be forged,” Harry said, reverting to an even tone. “Is there anything you want to ask me?”</p><p>TMR looked surprised, then he examined Harry more carefully, absently straightening the towel over his groin, to Harry’s relief. If it dropped all the way to the floor an awkward situation would be made ten times worse.</p><p>“You’ll do,” TMR decided. “Although—and I don’t intend any offense—I would be hard-pressed to turn any candidate down, considering. It’s literally life or death for me, you know.” He smiled slyly. “What about you?” he purred. “Anything I can do to convince you?”</p><p>Harry hastily held up a restraining hand. “No,” he said, but he was watching TMR’s parted lips and had to blink to break his focus. “Like you said, it’s life or death. So I’ll do it. But I couldn’t decide for both of us.”</p><p>TMR’s amusement mixed with something else. “We’ve decided then,” he said, reclining back on the hard surface of the chamber platform as though it was a featherbed. “I’m all yours.” He winked. Harry refused to let a kid make him blush, but it was still a close call.</p><p>The Captains separated Harry from TMR for the formal consent, just in case of undue influence, though they kept assuring Harry that wouldn’t be possible underground. Harry didn’t care to ask what TMR <em>would</em> be capable of when they <em>were</em> above ground. Presumably, the forging would ensure that Harry could control him. Though, Harry had a hard time imagining a subordinate version of the smug teenager he’d just met, his careless attitude unfazed even by the threat of death should Harry refuse him.</p><p>The forging was scheduled for the next day, and Harry was given a barracks to himself, which was a strange feeling and, he realized, an indicator of his changed status.</p><p>Within an hour of staring blankly at the walls and wishing for sleep that wouldn’t come, he heard someone buzz the door. Harry went to answer, puzzled. The military culture on New Earth was more relaxed than Harry was used to, but it was borderline misconduct for a Captain to visit the barracks.</p><p>It wasn’t Moody on the other side of the door, though; it was pre-Captain Weasley.</p><p>“Want to blow off some steam?” she asked, grinning. She wore a flight jacket with a high collar, but her leggings and footwear were casual.</p><p>“Are you off duty?” Harry said, startled into the non-reply. Weasley laughed.</p><p>“Yes, Potter, and so are you. We’re off every evening after end-of-duty tasks. Welcome to New Earth.”</p><p>“I should have asked for a transfer ages ago,” Harry joked, reaching for his coat where it hung on a peg next to the door. “I only have uniforms,” he added apologetically, glancing down at his flight suit, which was his default in the evenings since it was the most comfortable of all of them.</p><p>Weasley followed his gaze. “You look fine. Good, even. And even better when you blush. Fuck’s sake, Potter, are you even half as innocent as you act?”</p><p>Harry tousled his hair, a nervous habit, and smiled wryly. The words that came out of Weasley’s mouth would put him on the defensive if almost anyone else said them, but there was something about her that made it impossible to take offense.</p><p>“At least half,” he assured her. Her laughter was still ringing out through the corridors after he shrugged into his jacket and followed her out. Weasley navigated the dense grid of identical hallways with the ease of someone practically born and raised in the facility. When they arrived at a large sealed door marked “external,” Harry frowned at her in surprise.</p><p>“Surely we’re in the wrong place?”</p><p>“Not at all,” Weasley replied, grinning. “After you.”</p><p>Harry grimaced, but couldn’t contain his curiosity. What could be outside an <em>underground</em> facility, after all? He stepped forward cautiously and the doors swept open as they sensed him coming near, revealing a yawning, dark cavern filled with a rushing-water sound.</p><p>“Go on,” Weasley encouraged him, raising her voice to be heard. “Trust me, I wouldn’t take a candidate somewhere they could so much as stub their toe. Go!” She punctuated this last command with a playful shove, and Harry relented and walked past the threshold. The cold, clean air was like a slap to the face, and the cushion of the standard walking surface in the facility transitioning to the rough hardness of stone.</p><p>Above them the sound of the water echoed off a stalactite-studded ceiling like wind, yawning space spreading around them like a dark, vast bubble. The door slid closed behind them, sealing them in.</p><p>“Don’t look so worried. It’s perfectly safe,” Weasley assured him. “We didn’t even have to pick a lock, did we? Or go through a vacuum?” She brushed past him to lead the way, and as the darkness surrounded her two illuminating patches lit up on the shoulders of her jacket.</p><p>Harry followed her cautiously, but his heart was beating hard with the excitement of doing something truly on-planet. He didn’t have much experience, since his aunt and uncle had raised him “safely” away from inhabitable atmospheres in the sterility of the industrial space station between Earth and Mars. And though he'd been enlisted six years, he’d never been assigned to a combat zone.</p><p>Although, that was likely to change, now that—</p><p>The ground sloped and Harry stumbled, knocking into Weasley who rotated on the spot, catching him with a strong, lean arm and laughing close to his ear.</p><p>“You can’t stay inside your head on an adventure, or you’ll fall on your face,” she said, then propped him up, leaving him warm and blinking, and set off again. She added over her shoulder, “Also, getting out of your head is the fucking point of an adventure. Come on, Potter.”</p><p>“You swear a lot,” Harry observed, paying more attention to the footing as he continued to walk close behind her to take advantage of the illumination patches. She hummed to acknowledge that he’d spoken and, presumably, to emphasize that what he’d said didn’t merit a response. When they got to the bottom of the slope, the stone was wet. A massive and furious underground waterfall crashed over the opposite ledge, filling the air with dense mist. Weasley grinned at him, undid her belt and stepped out of her pants.</p><p>“Weasley,” Harry began, shocked, and she paused to arch an eyebrow at him, then slid the rest of the way out of her jacket and let it pool at her feet. The light angled up to show her smooth, long calf in brilliant relief; he could have counted her freckles from where he stood.</p><p>“Come on, Potter,” she said, “I’ve seen you ogling my indicator. And even if you don’t want to do anything other than to ogle my naked body as well, that’s fine with me. I’m only here for a swim; anything else is extra.” She wriggled out of her underwear and suddenly the patches were lighting her up in an impossibly lewd way. Harry, fascinated, couldn’t look away.</p><p>He shucked off his own clothes almost as quickly as she had but with far less grace, and after she winked at him and dove nimbly off the ledge, tumbled after her. It wasn’t until he stepped into thin air that he realized that the water was quite far below them, and some sort of underwater phosphorescence cast the water in a thousand patches of neon blue and pink, mingling together into green where they met. When he broke the surface and went under, his own velocity forced him down close to the source of the light.</p><p>It was some sort of lichen with long, trailing vines. Schools of fish burst out of hiding at the disturbance. The water was shockingly warm. Harry rolled over back toward the surface, having taken an insufficiently deep breath just before his impulsive leap. As he turned, he saw Weasley’s long, elegant limbs treading water above him.</p><p>When he crested, Weasley was looking at him. “What do you say, Potter? Want to do more than look?” She inched nearer, and he felt her knee nudge his hip. He nodded slowly, and she grinned and put her legs around his waist, making him tread furiously to keep them both buoyant. She balanced them with a slowly paddling arm, then reached between them with her free hand to seize his already hard cock.</p><p>He’d been in a state of semi-hardness most of the day, somehow. Earlier, he’d blamed it on Weasley’s indicator, but mostly her letting him fly the craft. It had felt like waking up from a long dream. And then all the shocks of TMR, particularly the way he had acted, spoken, and <em>looked</em> during their brief time in person . . . </p><p>Harry nearly tipped over backwards when Weasley stroked him, and, both laughing, they broke apart.</p><p>“This seemed like a very sexy idea,” she said, looking around in mock-disappointment. “Underwater sex is <em>very</em> hot in novels.”</p><p>“So you don’t bring <em>all</em> the nontraditional candidates here?”</p><p>She glared at him, but obviously took no offense. “No, Potter. You’re very special. Follow me.” She ducked underwater and was gone, and Harry filled his lungs and followed her. The bottoms of her feet seemed appealingly pink, her toes a bit long and crooked, as she swam with a fish’s efficiency ahead of Harry. Several times he fell so far behind she slowed and looked back, then waited for him to catch up. By the fifth or sixth time this happened, Harry’s lungs burned; when he pointed at the surface questioningly she rolled her eyes and swam on.</p><p>Finally, she began to swim <em>up</em>, and when they did surface they were on the backside of the waterfall, and a slippery carpet of shorter-stranded, bright blue lichen formed a spongy beach.</p><p>“Is this stuff safe?” Harry asked, already following her lead and pressing the heels of his hands against the lichen-furred ledge to lever himself up. He was almost shouting to be heard over the pounding water.</p><p>In answer, Weasley spread her legs and hooked an ankle around his thigh to drag him up between them.</p>
