    <p>Platform 9 ¾ looked just the way it always had. There were the same bricks, here were the same magical entrances, and across the way were the same benches. The train sat in its usual place, waiting expectantly to be boarded by students and whisk them off to another year of school. Only the crowd had changed.<br/>

Neville walked with his Gran and searched the crowd for a friendly face as he pushed his trolley, just like he always did. Yet as hard as he tried, he couldn’t find Harry, Dean, Ron, or Hermione. It’s not like he thought he would, after certain recent Ministry decrees, and yet his eyes kept roaming of their own volition. Looking around, it seemed like at least a third of the usual hoard of students and parents had suddenly disappeared, leaving strange, empty patches of space in a place that was usually packed to the absolute brim.<br/>

“It might be Kurples, you know.”<br/>

The light ethereal voice sounded just behind Neville’s left ear, and he spun abruptly on one foot to find its owner. As expected, Luna stood about six inches away, complete with her customary dreamy expression and radish earrings.<br/>

“What’s a Kurple?” Neville asked, by way of hello.<br/>

“They make your eyes spin and dance, of course. Yours kept jumping around.” Luna said this, as always, with a tone of utmost seriousness. Neville couldn’t help smiling in response.<br/>

“Who is this?” Gran’s voice cut in sharply, making Neville jump. He’d almost forgotten she was there, which was quite a feat considering her hat contained not one but three different types of waterfowl. It’s hard to forget about someone who’s gazing primly at you from underneath several pounds of feathers.<br/>

“This is Luna, she’s in sixth year. Luna, this is my Gran.” Neville gestured awkwardly and hoped Gran wouldn’t comment on Luna’s fashion choices.<br/>

“Pleased to meet you,” Luna responded demurely. “I like your hat.”<br/>

Gran puffed up a little at this. “Thank you, dear, it’s quite a masterpiece, isn’t it?”<br/>

“It’d be very good for attracting Pilirisms, they’re fond of dead birds.” Luna’s eyes slid gently away as though unconcerned about receiving a response, and Gran’s threatened to pop out of her head.<br/>

“I beg your pardon?”<br/>

“C’mon Luna, let’s go find a compartment,” Neville interjected quickly, ushering her away towards the train. He turned back to say his goodbyes and found Gran with a strange look on her face that had nothing to do with his friend’s peculiarities.<br/>

“Everything alright, Gran?” Getting no response, Neville followed her gaze down the platform, but couldn’t tell what she was looking at.<br/>

“Yes of course,” Gran replied, tearing her eyes away from whatever it was. “Have a good term, and apply yourself to your studies.”<br/>

Neville refrained from sighing, if only by the skin of his teeth. “Bye, Gran.” He turned to follow Luna, and just caught a glimpse of her climbing into a car. He hurried to catch up, and dragged his trunk in behind her.<br/>

“Well of course, Luna, but I still think- oh hi, Neville!” Ginny sat cross-legged on the bench and seemed to be in the middle of an earnest discussion with Luna, as though they had been conversing for several hours instead of approximately thirty seconds.<br/>

Neville said hello and settled in to the compartment, gazing out the window and letting their intent discussion wash over him as the train pulled away from the platform. It was odd, wasn’t it, how everything outside could be so different, so scary and dark, and the company of good friends could remain as comforting as ever. It seemed there was a silent agreement not to discuss anything more important than their current game of exploding snap or the magical creatures Luna had recently been studying that may or may not actually exist. The specter of the real world hung outside the window, of political corruption, mysterious disappearances, and terrible rumors, but after all, they were only sixteen, weren’t they? Surely they could spend at least a few hours away from all of that. Whoever Gran had seen getting on the train completely vanished from Neville’s mind. Those mysterious hooded figures lurked nearby, but Neville remained entirely unaware. Night fell and the train sped closer and closer to Hogwarts and to the next year of their lives.</p>
