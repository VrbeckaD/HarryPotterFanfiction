<p>Disclaimer: I do NOT own Harry Potter or anything from it, just this new storyplot that came out of my imagination.</p>
<p>Warnings: James and Lily Potter are alive but are slightly nasty at first and becomes horrid in the future chapters, if you dislike this type of thing then I suggest you leave (Sorrryyyyy). Swearing, abusive Dursleys, Bashing Dumbledore, some Bashing Weasleys and the Potters are damn bashing as well (not Harry) and beating/blood/violent but NO sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Pairing: DRACO MALFOY/HARRY POTTER</p>

<p>This is now rewritten, I hope you enjoy this improved version! Please look at the note at the bottom for reason.</p>

<p>Chapter One</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A black figure moved towards the Potters' home silently, it laughed madly when it blasted the plain front door down and merely brushed the screaming nanny aside with a deadly green light that shot out of a thin, smooth and white stick held in its pale skeleton-like hand.</p>
<p>The mysterious figure slowly walked up the pale carpeted stairs, it's hand held up with the same pale stick that killed the nanny immediately... this enemy was not to be unterminated at all.</p>
<p>Twin cries was heard from the closest room, the door to it was shut tight and was decorated in childish and colourful stickers.</p>
<p>"Far too easy." The mysterious figure whispered darkly and smirked as it pointed it's pale stick at the door handle, it shot out a blinding ball of light and the playroom's door immediately opened with a CLINK.</p>
<p>The pair of cries grew louder as the door swung open to reveal the playroom of the Potters' two young children. There was selves full of toys and cuddly teddies, two cots in front of the large window which had a good view of the front garden. The walls was a pale yellow and also decorated in cute stickers, strange children drawings and a large picture of the Potters.</p>
<p>The Potters are a prideful and noble family full of Light wizards, the family members were gathered around a stone marble water fountain and all wore dark red and black robes with the Potter crest sewn on the top pocket proudly. James and Lily Potter stood in front with two sleeping children in their arms, the grandparents and other relatives stood behind them fondly. They all laughed and smiled at the camera silently... a happy memory captured in this very paper and magic.</p>
<p>The figure slowly crept over to the crying from the two cots, like a cat stalking its prey hungrily, its pale deadly wand raised to the wooden cots. A playing smirk grew on the figures' hidden face.</p>
<p>The two young Potters twins cried in dismay; one child had fluffy dark red hair like Lily's, chubby round face and a pair of round-shaped almost hazel eyes. The other child was around two hours older than the red headed Potter child, he had raven black messy hair that stuck up in different angles, a sharp toned jaw and skinnier faceshape... a pair of breath-taking emerald eyes opened and wearily stared at the dark figure.</p>
<p>The figure watched them carefully, the black haired child stopped crying and was observing the strange person in front of him while the red haired child cried loudly, taking no notice of his surroundings at all.</p>
<p>"Stupid child... SILENCIO!" The figure hissed at the red haired child with a blast of light from it's pale stick and the sounds of crying disappeared but the chid appeared to still be crying with his mouth open wide.</p>
<p>The figure turned to the quiet black haired child, observed the silent pale child.</p>
<p>"You are a strange one, child... do you not fear me?" The cloaked figure leaned towards the raven haired child, he blinked and innocently looked at the dark figure silently.</p>
<p>"It's almost a shame that I have to kill you..." The figure pondered out loud while observing the quiet child, "I can tell you are more powerful than any child I have ever met... more than that screaming twin of yours..." The figure glanced at the sobbing and demanding red haired child in distain.</p>
<p>"I have to end the one who's destined to kill me..." The figure muttered and straightened up, raised its pale stick at the emerald-eyed child.</p>
<p>The figure used it's other hand to reach up and pulled it's black hood down to reveal it's face finally. The face was a unnatural shade of white, sharp cheekbones, slits for a 'nose' and a pair of sharp crimson coloured-pupils. A sinister smile stretched on its smooth face.</p>
<p>"I am Lord Voldemort, you shall remember me as your last pitiful memory." He smirked even more and it slightly fell when he noticed the black haired twin didn't give any reactions... he stared at this so-called 'Voldemort'.</p>
<p>Voldemort didn't halter at this and carried on observing while a pale deadly green light glowed at the end of the thin white stick;</p>
<p>"Goodbye Harry Potter"</p>
<p>A burst of the bright green light shot out of the 'wand' and hit the pale exposed forehead of the oldest Potter twin. The black haired child gasped at a burning pain, the green light of death immediately burst out of the raven-haired child and hit Voldemort.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The house shook violently in reaction, the window behind the children's cots completely smashed immediately, a sharp shard slashed the left cheek of the red haired child- leaving a shallow cut that bled, which would scar as the pressure of the glasses was high meaning there were cuts both twins on their arms and legs as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A blood-curling scream echoed around in the night. All there was left of Voldemort was absolutely nothing... but a pile of dark ashes.</p>
<p>But as for Harry Potter, a raw and bleeding lightning bolt-shaped cut was to be scarred and to forever stay on Harry Potter's right forehead... to haunt him of the Dark Lord who tried to murder him.</p>
<p>(A hour later)</p>
<p>A desperate dark-brown haired man rushed forward, hand in hand with a crying woman with dark red hair... James Potter and Lily Potter nee Evans had come to collect their children... a feeling of dread filled the air around them.</p>
<p>An old man followed almost in a 'gravely' way, he had a long white wispy beard and wore tiny thin glasses on his large nose, he also wore a strange combination of colourful patterned robes... this old man was Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Lily gave strangled scream at the sight of the pale stiff woman on the floor nearby the stairs, it was the Potter nanny laying dead with a face of horror glued on her face.</p>
<p>James gasped and bowed in respect before rushing up the stairs to storm in his childrens' playroom. Lily rushed ahead of her husband to children's cots to let out a breath of relief... they were alive and were just sleeping. </p>
<p>She gasped at the shallow cut on her youngest child's left cheek and picked him up in concern, forgetting about the oldest.</p>
<p>Dumbledore strolled in boldly, eyed the cut on the red haired boy's left cheek. He looked in the raven haired boy's cot to see his face... unfortunately his forehead was covered by his usual messy hair, the cursed scar was hidden from the truth.</p>
<p>Dumbledore walked away from Harry and picked the red haired child from Lily's arms, inspecting the child and almost smirked in a glee like way.</p>
<p>Just as Harry awoken, Dumbledore next words was heard by the raven haired child;<br/>
"May I announce that this child, Kevin James Potter, as The Boy Who Lived, the defeater of Voldemort!"</p>
<p>Lily gasped happily, James eyed Kevin proudly and Harry watched this scene with wide eyes. He felt that they might send him away.</p>
<p>He was merely forgotten until Lily eyed him almost in disgust... Harry stared at her in shock, how could mummy look at him like that?</p>
<p>"What about Harry?" Lily spoke, not bothering to cover up the disappointment in her words, Harry felt his heart break into pieces.</p>
<p>"Ah well," Dumbledore's eyes twinkled at Harry, "We can't let the poor child to get jealous of his younger brother, right? Your dear sister can take him in and when Harry reaches 11, we can introduce him to the wizarding world and look up to his younger brother."</p>
<p>They did not expect that Harry was a clever child who understand what was going on here nor that he'll remember every memory he ever had, no matter how old he gets, he will remember.</p>
<p>"Yes yes, Petunia dear wouldn't mind. I believe that she has a child now, Harry will be of no problem then." Lily huffed and held Kevin in her arms again, James nodded in agreement... his hazel eyes stared at Harry in sworn and disappointment.</p>
<p>Harry began to cry and tried to wiggle away from Dumbledore when the old man bent over the bars of the cot and reached for him.</p>
<p>Harry did not glance at his parents for the last time as Dumbledore carried him downstairs and out of the dull house... he knew from the sounds of cooing and giggles from the smashed window that his own parents we're not concerned or thinking of him, they were cooing and fussing over Kevin.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a shabby rat stumbled to grab the pale wand that belonged to the fallen Voldemort and ran away into the darkness.</p>
<p>The so called "Boy Who Lived"...<br/>
Harry James Potter vowed revenge and to get rid of the filthy Potters' blood.</p>
<p>-/-/-/</p>
<p>(A few years later... ) [Author Note: Harry is around 6 in this time as it fits in my story plot ^^]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Boy! Get up and make our breakfast! Up! Now!" A high-pitched voice sharply spoke and more sharp knocks was heard on the pale small door.</p>
<p>Harry James Potter awoke and almost sighed irritatedly, "Yes Aunt Petunia."</p>
<p>"Hurry up then!" She screeched and footsteps moved away to enter the dining room.</p>
<p>Harry sighed, he was reliving that horrible memory- his knuckles clenched and turned white at the thought of "his family".</p>
<p>He will never forgive them.</p>
<p>Harry immediately got dressed into a pair of second-hand oversized dark jeans with an old cheap belt to keep them up, a baggy dark green t-shirt and a pair worn-down blue socks.</p>
<p>He then climbed out of his tiny cupboard that lived under the creaky stairs and quickly rushed into the plain kitchen to start on the breakfast, it wouldn't do him any good if they beat him again.</p>
<p>Petunia was fussing about the large amounts of presents that piled up on the brown family table and on the floor aswell- ah Harry forgot that it was Dudley's birthday.</p>
<p>As soon as Harry finished cooking the breakfast and laid it all out, which was difficult as the table was full of presents, the fat whale of the son walked in with his head held up high.</p>
<p>This boy was Dudley Dursley... the 'angelic' son of Petunia and Vernon.</p>
<p>Harry walked out of the kitchen to wait by the open living room's door as always for years.</p>
<p>He started to shake slightly out of fear when he heard his Uncle's heavy footsteps coming down the creaky wooden stairs, Vernon smirked nastily at him when he strolled in the living room making Harry flinch.</p>
<p>Harry was afraid of his Uncle, his beatings and "punishments" were not merciful and was always painful... his scarred back gave a sharp jolt at the memories of the 'belt'.</p>
<p>Dudley counted his presents and was pleased to find that he had 3 more presents from last time [Remember that Harry is 6 at this time and this scene is NOT exactly the same as in the first book where he was older, less presents aswell] and crazily torn into them. Harry winced at the childish behaviour... [well I know they are children but still]</p>
<p>They dug into their large unhealthy breakfasts as Harry watched them, his stomach growled in hunger as he watched his uncle and cousin disturbingly chomp loudly with food in their mouths.</p>
<p>Petunia finished hers and stood up sharply to grab a long piece of paper with black writing on it and shoved it into Harry's outstretched hands.</p>
<p>"Finish those before we come back! You'll be damn lucky if we'll give you any food afterwards!" Petunia shrill voice spoke as she walked away to grab her handbag, Vernon and Dudley followed her after chomping down the last pieces of their breakfast.</p>
<p>Dudley punched him hard that he fell to the floor with the list in his tiny hands, the fat bully smirked in triumph and left the house.</p>
<p>Harry sighed as looked at the list. There's no way he could get them done in time, he would definitely get another beating then.</p>
<p>-/-/-/</p>
<p>Harry was right. He sat alone in his cupboard with his back spouting raw, bleeding cuts from Uncle Vernon's new belt.<br/>
He couldn't get the last job done when the Dursleys pulled up in the driveway, Vernon's face was purple with anger when he saw that Harry hadn't finished and whipped him hard with his new belt.</p>
<p>Harry winced at the burning pain and tears fell down his pale skinny cheeks,<br/>
"Please... someone help" Harry whispered heartbrokenly, he just wished for something to lead him on his way... to help him show that the Dursleys must fear him.</p>
<p>Now, Harry already knows about his magic and made a guess of having a wizard heritage. [due to memories]</p>
<p>But he just needed someone to help him control it and find the wizarding world, his world.<br/>
Harry whimpered as his cupboard grew colder unnaturally... but he froze when another gaspy breathing joined his small breathing of terror.</p>
<p>He could actually feel that someone else was here with him.</p>
<p>He shook slightly, "H-Hello?" He whispered in the silent atmosphere with the pair of breathings that loud.</p>
<p>"Child of Death... do not fear me." A low voice whispered as a pale hand reached out from the darkest spot of the cupboard to cup Harry's tear-stained cheek.</p>
<p>Harry blinked in shock at the warm comforting hand on his right cheek and nodded numbly as he noticed a shadowed dark ring on this man's hand.</p>
<p>"Do you know who am I, Child?" The voice whispered wonderingly at Harry. Harry knew and gasped as the figure came out.</p>
<p>It was a man, he had long black silky hair that had slightly curled ends, pale skin and sharp cheekbones of high blooded, pale lips and nose... what caught Harry's attention the most was the pair of piercing ice blue eyes that met with Harry's emerald eyes.</p>
<p>"Death..." Harry whispered in awe as he looked at the man who wore dark clothes of; a soft, black, long jacket matching with dark trousers and dark blue shirt, the man nodded and smiled fondly at him.</p>
<p>"That is right, Child of Death. I have come to complete your wishes of help, young one."<br/>
Death crouched down a bit more so he met with Harry's head height, Harry was shocked... Death came to help.</p>
<p>"B-But why me? I'm just a freak..." Harry whispered and jumped when Death's hand shot out and lifted his jaw so their eyes met again.</p>
<p>"You are not a freak. It's wrongful of your 'family' to abandon you so you had to suffer this abusive fate," Death growled, "You are special and powerful and therefore my Child..."</p>
<p>Harry stared at him in shock, "W-What? Really?" He slammed nervously, Death nodded and leaned forward to hug him.</p>
<p>"Then... are my 'parents' are actually Lily and James Potter?"</p>
<p>Death did not answer but moved his hand, Harry caught the sight of the ring which had a symbol of a triangle with a circle inside which also had a thin line running through it. [Deadly Hallows symbol as some may not be able to picture this description in their minds]</p>
<p>The hand then moved to Harry's forehead.</p>
<p>A sharp pain ran through his body when a finger pressed gently on his forehead, he was overcome with blackness and fell unconscious into Death's arms.</p>
<p>"Now, you are truly my son..." He spoke as he watched the changes of his son began.<br/>
[Now, to clear up some confusion; Tom Riddle's soul part isn't removed in this progress]</p>
<p>/-/-/-/-/</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry wearily blinked his eyes open and realised that he could see for the first time without his broken glasses, he looked around in awe then to Death who watched his son in amusement.</p>
<p>"W-What did you do to me?" Harry asked in wonder.</p>
<p>"Removed your 'parents'' DNA and replaced it with mine so we're genetically and by blood- related now. I hope you do not mind that..." He almost trailed off in worry but that worry disappeared at his son's look.</p>
<p>"Really? Oh wow! Thank you so much!" Harry cried happily and hugged his shocked father, Death then smiled at him.</p>
<p>"I shall show you." Said Death as he summoned a candle and mirror, he lit the candle as Harry watched in awe.</p>
<p>Harry gasped at his new appearance; his hair was darker and more silky like black instead of messy hair look, his face only changed slightly to match Death's features and his eyes became a darker shade of green and developed Death's icy look.</p>
<p>He looked back to Death who smiled at him proudly, sending a warm feeling through his chest that he never felt before.</p>
<p>"Young one, I will teach you of everything and stay with you always until you can truely join me." Death whispered fondly as he stroked the matching silky hair of Harry's.</p>
<p>Harry sobbed finally and clung to the man's robes, "Thank you!"</p>
<p>"It's really no problem, my child." He kisses the raven haired boy's head passionately and hugged again.</p>
<p>"I will teach you of many things and prove to everyone that you are strong, I am proud of you little one." Death smiled and Harry's heart gave a jolt of happiness at this fondness.</p>
<p>-/-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It took many years for Harry James Potter to master the knowledge of magic and how to get in Diagon Alley, magic came to him easily and had no problems doing the spells wandlessly from many books that Death sneaked in for him.</p>
<p>Death couldn't of course always be there when Harry did chores for the Dursleys or had to leave to do his job as the god of Death... He had always healed Harry's wounds from Vernon's cruel beatings but couldn't get rid of the scars.</p>
<p>Death was there when Harry sobbed of painful memories and the punishments from his uncle, comforted him when he needed it.</p>
<p>Together, Death and Harry grew up together happily... Harry was forever grateful, Death taught him everything.</p>
<p>Harry grew into a young boy of 10 with long black silky hair that had curled ends and his cold emerald eyes always seemed to stare in everyone's souls piercingly that it burns pain into the heart of the soul... [dramatic yes I know lol]</p>
<p>His teachers at school was afraid of him and never act knowledge him in fear, children ran away from him in terror if Harry snapped angrily at them like a poisonous snake.</p>
<p>Harry became more cold and emotionless as he grew older before and the Dursleys grew to fear him which resulted in more food and less chores.</p>
<p>Dudley avoided him more and more until Harry barely seen his cousin at all... which of course pleased Harry.</p>
<p>But Harry hadn't forgotten... He never forgets.</p>
<p>-/-</p>
<p>(A year later and is a day before Harry's birthday)</p>
<p>The Potters were coming for him tomorrow, Harry scowled unhappily at this information.</p>
<p>Harry had waited patiently for his Hogwarts letter but it hadn't came yet and he huffed in anger... they would need to hurry up.</p>
<p>He walked back into his cupboard and opened his trunk to climb into it after hissing "Open" in Parseltongue - Death had discovered his talent and took Harry to Gringotts to discover his inheritances.</p>
<p>He was the Slytherin Heir and Peverell Heir! [the three brothers' bloodline from the Deadly Hallows Tale]</p>
<p>The goblins also discovered the horcrux in his lightning bolt scar, they asked if he wanted it removed but Harry said that it may be useful in the future as it's harmless at the moment but gave a few sharp pains sometimes or when 'Voldemort' is mentioned.</p>
<p>Death brought this trunk for Harry so he could practice magic and show Death, it had six compartments. A training room, a large library, a kitchen with open dining table at the counter, a bedroom that was decorated in dark green and black colours connected with a white bathroom, a comfy living room so Death and he can talk on the sofas in front of the fireplace and a Potion lab to create potions in safely.</p>
<p>Harry smiled fondly at the rooms and grabbed an apple from the fridge, ate it on his way to the training room.</p>
<p>The training room had all sorts of weapons on the walls behind the clear cases, there was sports equipment on the other side of the room where he could train his body. He and Death believed that physical strength should be needed when unarmed without a wand or magic, weapons are particularly useful as wizards and witches never really uses these.</p>
<p>Harry's body was slim and had a lot of muscles but not too bulky, his stomach was hard and stronge and fast legs. Heck Harry was really fast.</p>
<p>He trained his body for today after eating the apple and went out of the trunk to see if he has his letter yet.</p>
<p>Here it was, sitting on the Dursleys' doormat was a heavy thick envelope with dark green inked writing:</p>
<p>Mr Harry Potter<br/>
The Cupboard Under The Stairs<br/>
4. Privet Drive<br/>
Little Whinging<br/>
Surrey</p>
<p>Harry smirked, finally he had his letter and turned it over to see the wax sealing the envelope, it was dark red with a letter 'H' and animals (Hogwarts houses' animals) around it was stamped in the wax.</p>
<p>Harry opened it to find the letter and the list of things needed for the year, it's simple really. Time to visit Diagon Alley!</p>
<p>-/-</p>
<p>Harry was exhausted: he had his robes measured, got his cauldron and potion ingredients, quill and ink and other school stuff. He met the Malfoy Heir and made friends with him (not the bratty jerky type of Draco )..l</p>
<p>He also visited a shop that had some snakes for sale, he hissed to them and see if his familiar is here, Harry then discovered his familiar which turned out to be a large black snake and was an unknown species with deadly poison.</p>
<p>It had deep purple eyes and smooth scales of pure black, the snake immediately bit Harry's outstretched hand with white sharp fangs, claiming him as the snake's Master and the snake hissed pleasantly around his slim neck.</p>
<p>Harry named him Arashi, it meant 'storm' in Japanese. [Apparently]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-/-</p>
<p>Death was waiting on the living room's sofa in the trunk, his expression turned to amusement when he saw Arashi hissing softly and curling fondly around Harry's neck. Harry got irritated at the snake but understood as Arashi found him a last as he waited years to find Harry.</p>
<p>"Had fun?" Death spoke in amusement and Harry nodded but frowned.</p>
<p>"Dad, I am confused about something..." Harry called Death his father since meeting him, Death was his father in blood/sperm and magic as a result from the ritual when he was younger. [shown in earlier scene of the 6 year old Harry]</p>
<p>"What is it little one?" Death became worried.</p>
<p>"Mr Ollivander had to make to make me a custom-made wand and he had this strange expression of shock when I held the wand made of holly and had a Phoenix feather and it burned immediately in my hand. My wand is made of Blackthorn wood and had some dementor blood and crushed basilisk fang. It's a strange mix actually..."</p>
<p>Death pondered, "Maybe it's because he was expecting you to be paired with the holly and phoenix feather... he may be an ally of Dumbledore. Hand me your wand so I can remove the Trace."</p>
<p>Harry nodded and handled him his black wand with strange carvings in the wood, his father waved a hand and the strangle thin cover on it disappeared and he handled it back. Harry could see the magic around the thin wand more easily and wondered why... Oh wait- the Trace, of course.</p>
<p>"All ready for Hogwarts in September?"</p>
<p>He nodded and remembered the Potters were coming tomorrow... a feeling of anger and hatred filled my stomach.</p>
<p>-/-</p>
<p>Harry woke up sleepily and found his father next to him, stroking his black silky hair.</p>
<p>"Morning little one and happy birthday!" Death chirped and Harry groaned tiredly but perked up when he saw presents at the foot of the bed.</p>
<p>"Thank you dad!" Harry bounced on the bed happily while moving the presents closer to his father so he could open them next to him.</p>
<p>Harry received wizarding sweets (Harry is particularly fond of Blood Pops ), new soft robes, a picture album of Harry and his father throughout those long years (Of course they had to sneak out to take Harry to places as treats for his successes or occasions like birthdays), a protection necklace and a certain cloak of Invisibility.</p>
<p>"Harry, that is my Cloak. Do you remember the Deathly Hallows I spoke of?" Death quietly spoke and Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"That's the same one from the Tale so it's yours now little one."<br/>
Harry's eyes widen, he has one of his father's deathly hallows!<br/>
"Thank you Dad, it's means a lot" Harry almost teared up and hugged Death.</p>
<p>"Its alright little one." Death smiled and then handled Harry some parchment rolled up, he looked at his father in confusion and opened it up.</p>
<p>His eyes widen, it was his true birth certificate! And another parchment to willingly change his name!</p>
<p>"I can change my name?" I gasped and Death nodded.<br/>
" Then... Harrison Salazar Slytherin-Peverell-Death?"<br/>
Death smiled, "I approve, Harrison."</p>
<p>The parchment glowed and disappeared immediately, Harry felt satisfied and hugged his father again.</p>
<p>“But what if my whole name gets called out Dad?” Now Harrison asked curiously as he looked at his father. </p>
<p>“Then will it with your magic to change to a simple and smaller name. “</p>
<p>Harrison nodded and hugged him again. His father leaned down and whispered, "Happy birthday, Child of Death."</p>
<p>-/-/</p>
<p>Harrison growled when the door knocked, he went to open it to reveal Lily and James Potter standing there. They wore black and red with yellow robes, the Potter crest was sewn on the top pocket. Harrison almost scowled at their bad taste of robes but couldn't say anything really as he was wearing Dudley's old hand-me-downs for this... occasion.</p>
<p>"Hello? How can I help you, Sir and Madam?" He spoke innocently.</p>
<p>They blinked and glanced at each other, Lily bent down to Harrison and patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>"Harry, it's us. Your parents, We have come to take you home." She spoke sweetly almost sickeningly.</p>
<p>He almost winced and narrowed his eyes at her.</p>
<p>"Wonderful. Can we go then?" Harrison drawled coldly, they both flinched at the unexpected coldness.</p>
<p>"O-Of course..." James slammed nervously and Harrison scoffed at him.</p>
<p>He picked up his compartment trunk with everything in it and Arashi slept peacefully in his bed in the compartment bedroom. Harrison wrapped a black coat around himself and simply walked out of the Dursleys' house, never wanting to see them again for the last time.</p>
<p>James's car was waiting outside with a driver waiting for them.<br/>
Harrison sat in the back in between James and Lily silently, not speaking a word to them until they arrived at the Potter manor. </p>
<p>He frowned at the white mansion and a red haired boy rushed out of the front doors towards Lily.</p>
<p>"Mum! Mum! Can I have some chocolate and of my cake? Plus go to the Burrow aswell!" The demanding 11 year old yelled.</p>
<p>The boy was Kevin Potter, he wasn't much different from when Harrison had seen him as a baby. Messy dark red hair, a lot of light freckles, chubby cheeks and slightly fat body (no offence readers...) and hazel eyes.</p>
<p>A faded thin scar ran across his left cheek which showed his "The Boy Who Lived" status. (Caused by the smashed window, remember?)</p>
<p>"Alright Kevin dear, go ahead." Lily spoke fondly to her youngest twin child.</p>
<p>Kevin turned to Harrison and looked him up and down in disgust and scorn, Harrison was around four or five inches taller than Kevin.</p>
<p>"You must be my older twin brother, welcome back." He spat and ran off to firecall the Weasley mother.</p>
<p>"Come on Harry, there's a lot of things to discuss at the moment." James nudged him painfully in the ribs, Harrison gave him a dirty look and followed his 'parents'.</p>
<p>The mansion was plain, decorated in red and gold brightly with no taste, they showed Harrison around the manor but nothing caught his interest at all.</p>
<p>Now, they led him to his own small room; it was all creamy white walls and dark grey carpet, a double bed was against the wall and was in shades of red colours. A plain chandelier hung from the ceiling... a least he had a balcony with view of the back garden.</p>
<p>"Now Harry, I wonder if you know about mag-" James started but Harrison held up his finger which silent him while dropping his trunk at the foot of the bed.</p>
<p>"I do indeed know, James. "</p>
<p>"What?! How?" James demanded, not really noticing that Harrison called him by name not father.</p>
<p>"What did I do as my last moment with you, James and Lily Potter?"</p>
<p>James blinked, "S-Staring at us? You were a quiet baby..."</p>
<p>"Exactly I observed and heard everything... I believe I have Hyperthymesia disorder." Harrison turned to them with anger in his cold emerald eyes.</p>
<p>They gasped and struck back in fear... "Y-You remember?" Lily asked, dreading the answer.</p>
<p>"Of course I do! How dare you give me to my Aunt so you can focus on your youngest child! Surely I was the first twin? Surely I wasn't important? You'll regret this fucking moment now..." Harrison's eyes glowed with magic as he stalked towards them, confirming their fears.</p>
<p>"H-Harry please don't s-speak to your parents like that!" Lily slammed nervously, "You'll be g-going to Hogwarts and your brother will go with you..."</p>
<p>" I do not care and I will not recognise you as my parents." Harrison spoke quietly in the tense atmosphere and sank onto the ugly bed. </p>
<p>They scrambled off, Harrison smirked darkly.</p>

<p>Rewritten: 23rd December 2018 (Merry Christmas!)</p>
<p>Edited again: 21 January 2020 (because of some spellings and wrong information)</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed the first chapter! It took awhile... phew! Let me know on how it is!</p>
<p>Plus I would like to explain the birth dates of the children as they are involved with the damn prophecy. </p>
<p>Harry was born first on the 31st July at 3am (yes the devil's hour ), then Neville was born at around 3:20 ish and finally Kevin was born last 2 hours later as the youngest. The prophecy states the child born at the end of July but Harrison was born first, meaning that he's the real chosen one ^^ for those who don't agree, well damn it's my fanfic here.</p>
<p>Sorry if you felt if this was too short but... Ta!~</p>
