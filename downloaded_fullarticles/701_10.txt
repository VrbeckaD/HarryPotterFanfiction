  <p>
    <u><b>JUST BEFORE DAWN - 1 AUGUST 1980</b> </u>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>The silence that rests over the London streets is heavy and tense, a coiled spring that waits to be sprung and there is an anticipation in the air that can’t be placed. The whole of everything, magical and muggle alike, is waiting, waiting.</p><p>The silence builds, unnatural and still until, with a sigh, it eases. The crickets and cicadas start their songs; restless sleep settles, deepens and the witch watches what she has done. The magic she’s worked over the hours old infant take hold; his high cheekbones and aquiline nose soften, his alabaster skin darkens to a tan, pitch dark hair lightens to soft brunette and emerald green eyes that match hers perfectly mottle to an unmemorable muddy brown. Her son, the child she shouldn’t have had, the child she couldn’t keep, the child she couldn’t name. The son that wasn’t her husband’s.</p><p class="p4">The glamours stabilize and the baby looks up at her without crying. He hadn’t cried but once in the last few hours, just had stared at her since she’d started disguising his features. Ancient pureblood features that would look close enough to her husband’s to match but weren’t. She could have kept him, passed him off as her husband’s. But she hadn’t told him. Hadn’t told him that her betrayal had lasting consequences nor had she told the infant’s father. The witch had kept the pregnancy to herself, glamours and spells to hide the effects and her bump. She knew she would never forgive herself for bringing him into the world not with the war waging over them. But she hadn’t been able to make herself kill him, either. Her son. This was better. He would live and he would grow and he would be safe.</p><p>But he had to be ordinary, unremarkable in every way. The only way to keep him safe from the wizarding world was to make sure he never entered it and the only way to ensure that was to bind his magic. Binding a wizard’s magic was extremely dangerous, especially a child’s. You could never be sure what would happen -- Magic doesn’t like to be controlled. It is a gift, a blessing; it doesn’t bow to wizards. She was doing what she had to do. For herself, for her husband, for her son. For the Greater Good.</p><p>“Please,” she whispered. “Please let me keep him safe.” Magic built in the air as the witch did one last ritual - ancient Blood Magic, illegal and uncontrollable. The pressure builds and builds until with an almost audible ‘pop’ it disappears as fast as it came on. Her son’s magic sealed away with five drops of her blood ensuring that only she would be able to release it.</p><p>She heaved a sigh of relief as she picked up her still silent baby. She was exhausted: physically, mentally, emotionally, magically. But she had done everything in her power to protect her son. No one would know he existed and he would be safe from the war that plagued her world. A world he would never be a part of. There was just one more thing she had to do and she disappeared with a ‘pop’.</p><p>Lily Potter reappeared in the south of London, hours away and across the street from the orphanage that would be her son’s home. At least, for a while. She knew someone would adopt him, take him in. Infants always found a home. He would be loved, raised in a home that wouldn’t know of her world or of the threat that hung over their heads.</p><p>In the first rays of dawn, she crosses to the orphanage doors and places her bundled infant on the front step. Her breath hitches, her composed façade cracking for the first time as she looks down at her son. Lily's hand trembles, reaching for the doorbell without taking her eyes from her son. She backs down the stairs and apparates back across the street before the door opens. It's only once the matron has looked back and forth down the street before picking up the silent baby and going back into the building does Lily let the tears run down her face with a gasp.</p><p>"I'm sorry. You'll forgive me one day. I did what I had to. I had to." She nods to herself, taking a deep breath and apparating back home to James.</p><hr/><p> </p><p></p><blockquote>

    <u> <b>AROUND NOON - 31 OCTOBER 1981</b> </u>
  </p>
</blockquote><p class="p1">Defeating the Light, in the end, is easier than the Dark Lord had even considered. Amongst all the turmoil and fear of Him and His followers, His reign, they had infiltrated the Ministry. And it had been done in completely legal standard. At 12:30pm on the 11<sup>th</sup> of December 1980, Tom Riddle succeeded Harold Minchum as Minister for Magic and the war that would eclipse the war with Grindelwald ended. Not with a bang but with a whimper.</p><p class="p1">Tom Riddle, who his classmates and professors remembered from Hogwarts - Prefect, Head Boy, top of his class and charming without seeming insincere - had been the dark horse in the race. With a war going on, it didn’t seem to be the best time to hold an election but, alas! Traditions must. Tom Riddle, who had worked for Burgin &amp; Burke after Hogwarts (a <em>glowing</em> recommendation), who had done work in Albania, ex-Headmaster Dippet sang his praises. Tom Riddle, who only Albus Dumbledore had anything bad to say about.</p><p class="p1">Of course, the majority of the Wizarding world only knew that the deaths and people going missing stopped going into the new year. Wizards waited on pins and needles for something, anything to happen. Headmaster Dumbledore, defeater of Grindelwald, believed the war wasn’t over and most of the population believed him. For a little while.</p><hr/><p> </p><p></p><blockquote>

    <strong> <u>1981 Forward</u> </strong>
  </p>
</blockquote><p class="p1">Once the New Year came, once January turned to February turned to March…the Wizarding World breathed a sigh of relief. The more Albus Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix tried to convince them that they were still in danger, the more the majority of the population pushed back and shunned them. After months of peace, no one wanted to believe that they were in danger. Surely, things would be happening if they were in danger, if the Dark Lord Voldemort were still a threat.</p><p class="p1">Suspicion and doubt drive the werewolf Remus Lupin from Dumbledore’s flock. A falling out with Potter and doubt in his Light loyalty make Sirius Black all but withdraw from the public. Peter Pettigrew, loyal to the Dark, stops pretending. The famed Marauders of Hogwarts no more.</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the end of that school year, the Hogwarts Board of Governors calls for Dumbledore's removal as Headmaster. Shifting seats in the Wizengamot take from him his position as Chief Warlock. The International Confederation of Wizards' Conference meets in the summer of 1982. A new Supreme Mugwump is elected and the Ministry revokes Albus' seat on the Confederation of Wizards. </span> <span class="s1">By the end of the year, Albus Dumbledore has no direct political power. Yes, many wizards still hang on every word he says. Yes, he is still powerful in his own right. But, the world is changing in the aftermath of the war that ended suddenly and more and more people are noticing that Albus is not. </span></p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Muggle raised Wizards are found at the first sign of accidental magic. They are raised with understanding and knowledge of magic and, if necessary, they are taken from families that <em>don't</em> react well then are placed with a magical family. The New World is more tolerant to everyone - human and non-human, muggle born and pure blood. Britain's Magical World doesn't feel threatened and is flourishing.</span>

  <p class="p1">
    <strong> <u>September 1986</u> </strong>
  </p>
</blockquote><p class="p1">The report had been made when the Matron of White Warden Cottage Homes in London had found the boy as an infant on the steps of the porter's lodge five years earlier. An abandoned child but nothing was found. So the baby stayed at the homes. The Matron and her husband named the child and placed him in one of the six cottages on the grounds. Each cottage housed 10-15 children as well as a rotating staff member.</p><p class="p1">She knew Harrison never fit in, had kept an extra eye on the boy who'd been left on their doorstep. He was quiet and picked on; the older children knowing he'd been left there only hours old - unwanted. But the six year old was normal. Nothing strange happened, nothing odd. Nothing until now.</p><p class="p1">Now, one of the cottages burns. Now, the still quiet Harrison glares down the older boys who'd pushed him and they scream when their clothes catch flame. The sky darkens, thunder rumbles and as they fight to put the fires out, the boy sits where he fell and stares at them all.</p><p class="p1">"Freak."</p><p class="p1">"Devil."</p><p class="p1">As the cottage burns, the matron's husband grabs Harrison by the arm and hauls him off the ground. "What did you do?" He shakes the still silent boy. "Huh? What did you do?"</p><p class="p1">The clearing of a throat gains their attention and matron and husband turn to the icy blonde woman and the nervous looking man beside her. His tongue flicked out, licking the corner of his lips as he takes in the fire that still burns with a smile.</p><p class="p1">An hour later, Narcissa Malfoy and Barty Crouch leave White Warden Cottage Homes with a curious Harrison tucked between them. The woman takes his hand, pats it gently and, with a small pop, the trio disapparates away.</p>
