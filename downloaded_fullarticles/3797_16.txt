    <p>The Starters:</p><p>#7 Harry Potter-Striker</p><p>#11 Cedric Diggory-Striker</p><p>#2 Draco Malfoy-Sweeper</p><p>#10 Fred Weasley-Right Mid</p><p>#12 George Weasley-Left Mid</p><p>#13 Marcus Flint-Center Mid</p><p>#8 Oliver Wood-Goalie/keeper</p><p>#6 Ron Weasley-Stopper</p><p>#16 Adrian Pucey-Center Mid</p><p>#9 Micheal McManus-Left Defense</p><p>#4 Jason Samuels-Right Defense</p><p>Â </p><p>Coach made it increasingly difficult to make Boys Varsity, no doubt only a mere 16 boys made it onto varsity, even getting onto JV was pretty hard 20 were on the team, 36 out of the 73 boys that tried out made onto a team. Which was why it was most impressive when Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy made it onto the school's Varsity team. But it wasn't that surprising they both breathed ate and drank soccer, they practically were the sport. </p><p>For Harry, soccer was truly everything, when he was young, his parents Lily and James wanted their son to be whoever he wanted to be, if he showed interest in something, and wanted to do it, you bet your sweet arse the Potters' let their son do it, and their other children. So at the young age of 3 they bought him a soccer ball and let him run around kicking it through the goal James set up from his youth. They truly encouraged it as for one thing James was a center-mid when he went to Hogwarts. Secondly as said before they encouraged and believed their children could do anything they wanted and who were they to stop them. </p><p>As soon as Harry was old enough to start on a rec team, they let him, outshining all of his team. At 11 they found him a private travel team, that he started along with the rec team. And of course Harry wanted to play on the middle school, team, and of course he made it, three teams seemed like a lot for one kid but Harry kept pushing through. </p><p>Lily and James were the parents that always showed up dressed in the team's colors, cheering on their son, it killed James every time work kept him late. They always wanted to show up, because that's the type of people the Potters were.</p><p>The same could not be said for the Malfoys. Lucius and Narcissa, never really showed a loving interest for their only son. It was always about whether or not Draco embarrassed the family name. He started at private school, in preschool, always the best and most expensive teachers for the Malfoys. Draco loved soccer, and begged to play, but the answer was always no. One day Narcissa spoke up claiming it would keep him active and busy. So the reason he played soccer was to keep him busy.</p><p>So at 4 they started him with private lessons, his parents didn't seemed very interested when his coach came in to tell them their son was one of the most talented pupils he had coached. Draco grew bitter despite everyone else, and their encouragement, he wanted his parents. So he got better, he practiced more and more so that his parents would notice but they never seemed to care. </p><p>Harry's talent really seemed to come naturally, of course practice did help, but it was mostly pure talent and skill. For Draco his talent, came from anger and hours of hard laborious practice. Which is a reason a rift came between them, Draco was angry that the talent just came to him, but he was furious his parents encouraged him, unlike Draco's. So that was the start of what some would call a rivalry between the two boys.</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>Harry's cleats were marking their place in the ground, as he ran up the field, dribbling close to his feet, looking up around to make sure no one was in his way, before passing to George Weasley, but the pass was short and the opposing team, came to intercept the pass, Harry groaned, as #17 took a shot. Draco ran up from the top of the Goalie box and booted it to the other half's 18. Harry chased after it, pounding his feet into the ground sprinting up to catch up from his spot at the half mark, he swept in and scored another point for Hogwarts. The game ended 2 and a half minutes later, the score 5-2, making them 6-0, another win. This was one of the best teams the school had seen for awhile. However despite their win Harry was fuming. </p><p>"What the bloody hell Malfoy" He shouted.</p><p>Draco sneered "What"</p><p>"You need to work on your power kicks"</p><p>"They seem to be pretty powerful" He scoffed</p><p>"That's the fucking problem"</p><p>"Last time I checked you still scored, and we still won. No need to get your panties in a twist because of your lack of skills on the field"</p><p>"Shut up-"</p><p>"-Boys! Stop this nonsense" Their coach ran over shouting "Stop arguing"</p><p>"Draco started it" </p><p>"I most certainly did not"</p><p>"I don't give a damn about who started it" Their coach snarled "I care about unity between the team, and you two are always causing a rift. I don't care if you two are the captains I will not hesitate to bench you both". he paused "For an entire game" </p><p>They both nodded in understanding and left to grab their bags trading each other looks of vengeance. Harry walked over to his mother. Draco stared at him as he started his walk over to his car.</p><p>"Hi Harry"! Lily smiled "Something wrong"</p><p>"Draco's being a twat" </p><p>Lily sighed "Of course he is" she said laughing.</p><p>"What"?</p><p>"When you were little I used to hear a lot about the goals you scored during the game now all I hear is about how Draco did this during the game, or Draco did that" She giggled. Harry grew red and humphed "What" </p><p>"I'm not obsessing over Draco"</p><p>"I never said you were" She smiled brightly "Now give me your stuff I'll bring it home, you take your car and go celebrate with the Weasley's, and I'm sure you want to see the end of Ginny's game right"? She winked. </p><p>He smiled and walked over to the JV field where Ginny was, everyone knew she would make Varsity next year when she was a junior she was amazing. Sure he wanted to see her play they were dating. But in all honesty he just wanted to go home.</p><p>He made it over and smiled at her, as she ran up to take a shot, the goalie caught it, and Harry along with others chorused an 'awww'. He yelled "Nice shot Ginny"</p><p>When the game ended they had lost 4-3, a close game Ginny come off the field sprouting a frown but smiled when she saw Harry. "Hi"</p><p>"Hey, want to come with Ron and me, and probably George and Fred we're getting some food."</p><p>"Sure let me just tell mum" </p><p>Harry waited and swung his keys, before walking with Ginny to his car. The Weasley's brothers all shared one car, that used to be Percy's and then the twin's, but they sometimes gave Ron a ride. Usually Harry drove him to school. But today Ron got a ride with the twins. </p><p>They made it to a Pizzahut, and met Fred George and Ron inside, where they got two large pizzas, and talked about their games, and of course Harry brought up what a little git Draco was. Ron talked about Oliver's save, in the first half and how next year he wanted to go out for keeper. </p><p>Ginny got a ride home with her brothers which left Harry alone in the car, he turned the radio on, to The Strokes. "Last nite" Was on. </p><p>When he got home both his parents were asleep. Which left Harry alone once more but this time with his thoughts. Why did he care so much about Draco?</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p>Thank You all so much for Reading !!!! Tell me what you think, comments and kudos are appreciated and I hope you enjoyed. I'm trying to think of good Jobs for the parents so any ideas are also appreciated. Thanks again -Sam</p>
