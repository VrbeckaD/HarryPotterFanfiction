    <p>Harry watched as she became closer to <em>that boy</em>, it was a slow process over the years. Harry thought that it probably started in third year around the time of the yule ball, but that could have just been when he first noticed it. Harry had always thought that she would end up with his best friend, he couldn’t complain though, not when he saw them together and they just seemed to fit. Like puzzle pieces. They really loved each other, and <em>he</em> was good for her. The hard part came after the last battle was over at Hogwarts, when she was given the news that <em>he</em> had died. That was the first time Harry saw Hermione lose herself. Harry found her in a corner with a bottle of fire whiskey, sobbing. He sat with her and let her yell, hit, and blame him. Then he held her and let her soak his shirt with her tears.</p>
<p>After everything was over she moved in with Ginny and him and Harry watched as she picked herself back up and stood tall. She received a job at the ministry and threw herself into her work so much that she lost almost got lost. She was broken but strong, but she didn’t let anyone else get as close to her as <em>he</em> had. Harry worried about her a lot, especially after she moved out after only three months with them, and got her own apartment. He didn’t see her very often after that. Sure she came around for the birth of Harry’s children and their birthdays, but that was it.</p>
<p>On the tenth anniversary of the battle, Harry heard that she wasn’t going to Hogwarts for the memorial. When he visited her, he found her holed up in her room. The dining room table was covered in a weeks’ worth of owl messages from work. She hadn’t been there in almost a month. It was the anniversary of<em> his</em> death too. Harry again held her as she cried, he hadn’t had to do this in years. Harry, and everyone else, had thought she was getting better, now he wasn’t so sure. Harry didn’t know what to do anymore.</p>
