    <p>High Fidelity is a truly horrendous novel, but some No-Maj had left it behind on the tube at South Kensington and Crispin forgot to pack a book in his shoulder bag, so he doesn’t have much of a choice if he wants to keep himself from being bored to death during the awfully long train ride to Hogwarts. There is some parchment and a quill in his bag but it will be another two months until he will come of age, so using his usual spells is out of the question, and writing with his own hand is a rather tedious task, especially in an old train like this, jolting over the tracks, so the book has to be enough. Although, he thinks while he reads about yet another of the protagonist’s pathetic past relationships, he ought to slow down. The train is just rolling out of King's Cross and the pages are already melting away between his fingers. Crispin forces his eyes to take in each letter individually, letting them become words in his head, and the words become sentences. It’s highly annoying, reading like this, but it will have to do. At least he is alone. A few other pupils had peeked into his compartment but nobody has opened the door, not even the group of giggling first years, if only because he has given them a lingering stare until they disappeared. The silence is precious, he knows he won’t have another quiet minute when the train arrives.</p><p><br/> But of course, as life usually goes, a loud voice sounds right outside his compartment the second he finishes his thought.</p><p><br/> “ … - should get a cabin first but of course you had to court Evans first and now the entire train is, as I have predicted, full“, a boy says and Crispin glances over the edge of his book just in time to see a group of four teenagers, all around his age, show up in front of the door. One of them peaks into the compartment, a shiny badge forming the letter P pinned to his worn-out jumper. Crispin meets his eyes and sighs quietly when the other boy's brows furrow as he, very obviously, tries to place the stranger.</p><p><br/> “There’s enough space for us in here”, Crispin can hear him say quietly, and his companions turn around and stare, first at the empty seats and then openly at Crispin as if they had just been presented with the last living unicorn. He doesn’t mind, it will happen more often in the nearest future, but he does mourn the loss of his privacy when the door opens and the boy with the badge enters, ignoring his friend’s objection that the compartment isn’t, in fact, empty.</p><p><br/> “Come on, Sirius”, P-boy says and sits down next to Crispin, the rusty buckles of his bag scratching over the stiff leather of Crispin's. They nod at each other, and the thin lines of P-boy's lips curl upwards.</p><p><br/> “Yeah, come on, Sirius. And it’s not my fault, by the way”, one of the others says and pushes the boy named Sirius, who is still standing outside giving Crispin a wary stare, right into the compartment until he collapses on the seat opposing Crispin, immediately taking up the entire legroom for himself. Crispin wouldn't be surprised to find Sirius' picture printed somewhere in his book as he is the spitting image of the self-absorbed and supposedly indifferent High Fidelity's protagonist's teenage self.<br/> “Hands off, James”, he says and pulls down his battered The Rusty Cauldrons t-shirt that slid halfway up his chest thanks to his friend's manhandling. James laughs and nudges Sirius’ side as he sits down himself.</p><p><br/> “As I was saying, not my fault. Pete was busy courting Millicent -“</p><p><br/> “It isn’t courting when she is already my girlfriend”, the last of the group says with his back turned towards them as he closes the door. Crispin hasn't really noticed him before. It's clear he is that friend who has to walk behind the group when the path isn't big enough. Crispin, his eyes finding their way back to his book, stores the information away in his mental list about Hogwarts’ students. It’s a very short list as of now but it will grow immensely over the next few weeks and every detail might be of importance one day.</p><p><br/> “Girlfriend? How did that happen?”, James asks and Crispin finds himself listening instead of reading. Their topic is not any better than the novel but at least this way he is learning something about his new school mates, who are significantly more interesting than Rob Fleming.</p><p><br/> “Yeah, listen up James, maybe he can teach you how to finally get Evans to date you”, Sirius says loudly, as if he and James are two carriages apart instead of sitting right next to each other.</p><p><br/> “Shut up.” A thud sounds, followed by a barking laughter and suddenly the two boys are wrestling with each other, arms and legs flailing. Crispin crams his own feet in the small space between his seat and the heater so he won’t get kicked, and reminisces about the solitude of his attic room in his family’s new house in London, his padded chair on the roof deck, piano music playing quietly in the background. He should have brought his walkman, despite the warning that electronic devices won’t work in Hogwarts.</p><p><br/> Sirius yields and James retreats with a triumphant shout, his glasses dangling from his left ear, when the door is opened and a girl sticks her head in, frowning at them before looking directly at P-boy, the same badge pinned to her jumper.</p><p><br/> “Hey Remus, prefects meeting is about to start, you coming with me?” P-boy, Remus, nods, grabs his bag and gets up.</p><p><br/> “I’ll catch you later”, he says to his friends and follows her out of the compartment. A prefect, Crispin thinks and flips a page, for appearances’ sake. He had been asked to become prefect himself, last year, but had politely declined. Taking care of younger children and running around reinforcing rules isn’t exactly his definition of time well spent.</p><p><br/> “I don’t know you”, James says suddenly and it takes a moment before Crispin realises he is talking to him. He glances at the other boy over the edge of his book, purposefully ignoring that the other two are again staring at him as well, and waits for a question for him to answer. Until now James has merely stated the obvious.<br/> “Who are you?”, James asks when he finally seems to realise that Crispin won’t start talking on his own.</p><p><br/> “Crispin Bonham”, he answers.</p><p><br/> “I don’t know you, Crispin Bonham”, James repeats, attempting to mimic Crispin’s unusual way of speaking. It’s really just a combination of his father’s archaic Received Pronunciation and his own habit of drawing together the ends and beginnings of words, but while it merely stood out as exotic before, it sounds nothing but out of place back here. Not that Crispin cares.</p><p><br/> It takes James a moment until he notices that Crispin has no intention to further participate in the conversation, but when he does, his eyes narrow slightly and his jaw tightens as he leans forward in his seat, elbows on his knees. It’s at that moment that Crispin decides he doesn’t like James. He usually tries not to judge people prematurely, but James’ sheer arrogance definitely rubs him the wrong way.</p><p><br/> “What are you doing here?”, James demands to know, talking like a strict father to his misbehaving son. Crispin resists the urge to roll his eyes. Two can play this game.<br/> “I’m on my way to Hogwarts”, he says and fakes a quizzical look, “This is the Hogwarts Express, isn’t it?” James grits his teeth before he throws himself back with an exaggerated sigh, arms now crossed in front of his chest. For a moment there is silence in the compartment, then a lot of things happen at almost the same time. James’ right hand moves to his side, pulling his wand out of his pocket and Crispin immediately drops his book, his left following James’ example.</p><p><br/> “Calvario!”, James shouts and Crispin manages to draw his wand just in time to cast a shield in front of him, repelling the red spark hurtling towards him. Sirius shrieks and drops to the floor when the spell hits the wall at the exact spot where his head has been only a split of a second ago. James, apparently stunned by Crispin’s quick reflexes, only gapes at him, and Crispin uses that moment to disarm him. His Expelliarmus charm is wonky as usual and James’ wand ends up in Peter’s lap, but Crispin doesn’t care. He has long accepted that spells aren’t his strong suit.</p><p><br/> James grunts and leans over to take back his wand, a flush appearing on his cheeks. Whether it’s from anger or embarrassment, Crispin can’t tell, but he assumes it’s a combination of both. Anyhow, he doesn’t loosen the grip on his own wand, although he lowers it, showing that he isn’t interested in continuing their little quarrel. This is not exactly how he has pictured his first day and it is definitely far from his usual endeavour of staying out of trouble.</p><p><br/> “James, if you’d have hit me, I swear I would have plucked out every single one of your hairs individually”, Sirius says from where he is still lying in the aisle, one elbow digging into the toecap of Crispin's boot. He pulls himself up until his back is leaning against the side wall, warily glancing from Crispin to James and back, as if he was considering if he could deem it save to return to his seat.</p><p><br/> “I’ll go and find Evans”, James snaps, his jaw tight, darting another glare in Crispin’s direction, and he storms out of the compartment. Peter flinches when the sliding door slams shut and he shifts on his seat, head ducked, his face reminding Crispin of that of a frightened animal. He mumbles something about his girlfriend, unable to look neither Sirius nor Crispin in the eyes, then gets up from his seat and flees the scene as well.</p><p><br/> “Yeah, of course, abandon me, you tossers!”, Sirius shouts after his friends, but as he turns his head to look at Crispin there's a grin plastered all across his face. “Quick reflexes. Most people stand no chance against James.” Crispin stifles a snort as he puts his wand back into his pocket and watches the other boy climb back onto his seat, his fingers running through his long curly hair. “Man, that’s been a close call. I’m just glad that spell didn’t hit me. It would have taken years to grow it all back and it’s finally at a decent length.” He bends down and picks the book up from the floor, its paperback cover now torn and the first few pages crumbled.</p><p><br/> “Ah, shit, sorry about your book”, Sirius says, grin melting into a frown as he glances down.</p><p><br/> “It isn’t mine, I found it on the tube.”</p><p><br/> “Oh. Well then…” Sirius throws it on the empty space next to Crispin. “It’s a muggle book, isn’t it?” Crispin nods, because yes, it is. There aren’t that many fictional novels written by wizards and most are frankly bad, at least in Crispin’s eyes. Not that this particular exemplar is any better, but generally speaking the muggle world offers a much bigger range of books. “Well, I don’t think I’ve ever read one. A muggle book I mean. Though I know shit about books anyway.”</p><p><br/> When Crispin doesn’t react, Sirius falls silent as well, face going entirely slack, and he begins to fiddle with the hem of his t-shirt. He talks too much and too loud but Crispin decides he doesn’t dislike him, partially because he can’t put everybody he meets on his mental list of people he doesn’t want to talk to, and because he is usually rather indifferent about others. As long as they don’t bother him, he doesn’t care.</p><p><br/> “Okay, Crispin… who are you? I mean, you’re obviously not a first year but I’ve never seen you before.” Apparently his seam wasn’t interesting enough to hold his attention for long, because Sirius is looking at him again. And Crispin has to revise his first impression: while Sirius' features all melt into each other his eyes are sharp, attentive, sparkling with a certain intelligence.</p><p><br/> “I originally went to Ilvermorny, but my family moved back to London this year so I decided to transfer to Hogwarts for my last two years.” It’s the explanation Crispin has settled on a few weeks ago, the one he knows he will have to repeat dozens of times after arriving at Hogwarts. Of course it’s also the truth, but the shortest version of it.</p><p><br/> “Ilvermorny?”, Sirius asks and raises his eyebrows, “But why not stay there? I couldn’t imagine leaving my friends and starting over thousands of miles away.” Crispin shrugs, not intending to tell him there isn’t anyone he will miss. There had been people who considered him a friend but nobody who can’t be replaced. He usually gets along with most people as long as they don’t try to get too close.</p><p><br/> “Wait, are you going to get sorted with the first years? We have houses - do you have houses at Ilvermorny?” Ilvermorny is based off stories about Hogwarts, so they do have houses over there. Crispin nods.</p><p><br/> “Thunderbird, Wampus, Horned Serpent and Pukwudgie.”</p><p><br/> “Here we have Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin”, Sirius starts to explain, as if Crispin wouldn’t know already, “Basically Ravenclaw is for the know-it-alls, Hufflepuff for the losers, Slytherins for the arseholes and Gryffindor for the cool kids.” Sirius laughs. “I’m a Gryffindor, of course. We all are.” He waves at the empty seats next to them.</p><p><br/> “I see you are not prone to prejudice.” At that, Sirius throws his head back and barks out another laughter.</p><p><br/> “It’s not prejudice when it’s true.”</p><p><br/> “It is good to know how you will define my character.” Crispin wonders if Sirius would have said the same if he knew he had already been sorted. Dumbledore brought the Sorting Hat with him during their meeting at the beginning of summer to save him the awkward moment of the sorting ceremony among a group of eleven year olds, and there is already a green and silver patch on the front of his new robe. Would Sirius even talk to him? It doesn’t matter, not really, but he is curious now. His father warned him about the stupid rivalry between Hogwarts' houses and Slytherin's reputation.</p><p><br/> “What house do you think I will end up with?”, he asks, feigning ignorance.</p><p><br/> “Let’s see”, Sirius says, bites his bottom lip and stares at him, his grey eyes scanning him slowly. “As quick as you reacted you can’t be a Hufflepuff. You also can’t be a Slytherin because a Slytherin would have either insulted James or set him on fire. Although a Gryffindor would probably have set him on fire as well, I mean, I know I would have. Which leaves Ravenclaw, and that makes kinda sense with your reading and the way you talk and everything.” He seems happy with his deduction, and he isn’t too far off. The Sorting Hat had indeed wavered between Slytherin and Ravenclaw, the respective houses of his father and mother.</p><p><br/> “Therefore you think I’m a know-it-all?”</p><p><br/> “Uh”, Sirius says, the corners of his lips curling upwards, and he scratches the back of his head, “Well, are you?”</p><p><br/> “It appears you will find out soon.” Sirius snickers and opens his mouth to say something when the door bolts open and James returns, his cheeks even more flushed then when he had left. He collapses next to Sirius and hides his face in his friend’s shoulder.</p><p><br/> “It went that well, hm?”, Sirius asks, seemingly having forgotten about their conversation, and gently pats James’ head. James sighs and starts to talk about a girl named Evans and his unsuccessful flirting, and after a few seconds Crispin picks up his book and continues reading, listening only halfway because he really doesn’t care about James’ love interest. At some point Remus returns, and soon James and Sirius start debating over a Quaffle throwing contest they apparently had during the summer during which Remus fell asleep.</p><p> </p><p>The Hogwarts Express is dashing through the Scottish Highlands, and the sun is disappearing behind the mountains when Crispin finishes the book and he lets it disappear with his third attempt, which Sirius comments with a smirk in his direction. Gladly he seems to be the only one who noticed, as Crispin is sure James would have said something otherwise. But James is too busy describing yet another one of his unbelievable Quidditch manoeuvres, not minding that nobody really seems to listen, except maybe for Peter, who came back about half an hour ago.</p><p><br/> “We should get changed”, Remus says after looking at his watch, “I’ve got to go and make sure everybody finds their way out of the train.” He opens his bag and pulls out his robes, the Gryffindor crest displayed on the front.</p><p><br/> “Finally”, Sirius sighs and shuffles on his seat, his calf rubbing Crispin’s thigh, obviously not grasping the concept of personal space with his feet wedged between Crispin and Remus, bumping against either of them with each rumbling of the train. “I’m starving.”</p><p><br/> “Because you forgot the lunch my Mum made for you”, James says.</p><p><br/> “I didn’t know she would do that!”</p><p><br/> “Of course she did, have you ever seen me starve on the train?”</p><p><br/> “I’m not you…”, Sirius mumbles and slides off his seat, pulling his own robe out of his bag. Crispin observes him, continuously adding more and more information to his mental list. Figuring out that Sirius moved in at James’ this summer hadn’t been hard, although he doesn’t know why yet. It is also rather obvious that James’ family is wealthy, it only takes a look at the clothes the boy is wearing, all new and perfectly fitting.</p><p><br/> “Thank Merlin you’re not, I like being one of a kind”, James says.</p><p><br/> “Oh, of course, you can’t-“</p><p><br/> Before Sirius can finish his sentence, Remus interrupts him, informing his friends he will catch up to them later, then he leaves, and the three other boys continue to talk about the forthcoming feast. Peter and Sirius are taking turns at listing every possible dish they can think of when Remus suddenly returns, sticking his head into the compartment.</p><p><br/> “Crispin, Wilkes is waiting for you in the front, he’s the Slytherin prefect”, Remus says, and the other boys fall silent instantly, their heads turning towards him. While James’ eyes are narrowed, Sirius’ widen in surprise, as if Crispin’s clothes disappeared at once revealing a merman’s body. Crispin ignores them both.</p><p><br/> “Thank you”, he says as he gets up, and he grabs his bag and walks straight past Remus.</p><p><br/> “Of course”, he can hear James say at the same time that Sirius mutters “Slytherin?” in what sounds like utter disbelief, then the door closes behind him and he heads to the front of the train.</p><p> </p><p><br/> He has to push his way through crowds of students, and it’s horribly noisy with all the chatting and shouting, and everybody seems to be looking for something or someone or is just overly excited about their imminent arrival. When he finally makes it to the carriage with the word ‘prefect’ written on the door he puts on his new robe and runs his fingers over the crest on his chest, as he has done embarrassingly often during the past two weeks. Then he closes his eyes for a second before he raises his hand to knock. It only takes a few heartbeats until it opens and a stocky boy stands in front of him, dressed in a Slytherin school uniform, eyes first set on Crispin’s neck.</p><p><br/> “Crispin?”, the boy asks as he lifts his chin, and a warm smile appears on his face when Crispin nods. “Hi, I’m Wilkes, I’m supposed to show you everything.” He extends his hand.</p><p><br/> “Thank you”, Crispin says, although he truly doesn’t believe it is necessary, and he meets Wilkes with an equally firm grip as they shake hands. However, he thinks, it probably won’t hurt to get to know some of his house mates and who would be better for introductions than a prefect?</p><p><br/> “So you went to Ilvermorny? Is it true that the houses choose their students themselves?”</p><p><br/> “Yes. Sometimes multiple houses want you and then the choice is entirely up to you.” Personally, he had been invited to join both Thunderbird and Horned Serpent, leaving him with the choice between the soul and the mind. Ironically, he went with his heart when he made his decision for the former.</p><p><br/> “Did you get to choose?”</p><p><br/> “Yes.” Wilkes doesn’t ask any further and Crispin doesn’t elaborate. He doesn’t think the boy knows anything about the houses’ differences anyway.</p><p><br/> “Alright. I’ve heard you had to spend the whole day with Potter and his friends. I probably don’t have to tell you this but as the new kid I’m going to give you some advice: Stay away from them. You don’t want to be seen with people like them.” Crispin doesn’t care who he is supposed to be seen with or not, but again he is curious.</p><p><br/> “Why?”, he asks all innocently, even managing a slightly confused expression to show on his face. Wilkes snorts and pulls him into the seemingly empty prefect’s carriage.</p><p><br/> “Lupin is a dirty, sickly half-blood, Pettigrew… just look at the little rat, he probably follows Potter into the shower to rub his back. Speaking of Potter, he’s the most arrogant cunt you’ll ever meet. And don’t get me started on Black. If you ask me, he’s the worst of the lot. Traitor to one of the greatest pure-blood families in Britain. Anyway, you will quickly learn what really matters at Hogwarts.” He snorts again. “Or in life.”</p><p><br/> Crispin doesn’t know who is who but it isn’t hard to figure out that Potter is James, and Pettigrew is Peter, and his guts are telling him that Black is Sirius, because it would explain why he prefers to stay at James’ house.</p><p><br/> “I suppose I will”, he answers, already knowing that Wilkes won’t end up among his favourite people but will probably be useful to keep around.</p><p><br/> “What do your parents do?”, Wilkes asks him casually after a brief, awkward moment of silence.</p><p><br/> “My mother works on inventing new healing methods, my father researches ancient spells for the ministry”, he answers truthfully, aware of what Wilkes is actually asking about. Despite both his parents being wizards, he isn’t a pure-blood, all four of his grandparents had been muggles. It doesn’t matter to Crispin, if anything he thinks it’s beneficial. He knows both worlds and truly considers them equal. There is much to achieve for a wizard in the muggle world.</p><p><br/> “Slytherin?”</p><p><br/> “My father, yes.” One of the very few muggle born exceptions. Crispin chose Slytherin over Ravenclaw because he shares much more traits with his father than with his mother, and he knows that despite the prejudices, his father succeeded in his house.</p><p><br/> Before Wilkes can ask any more questions, the train slowly comes to a halt, and Crispin turns to look out of the window. They’re at Hogsmeade, as a sign at the station shows, and Wilkes shoulders his bag, motioning Crispin to follow him. Together they leave the train and weave through the crowd of students to a large row of carriages. There are no horses in front of them, but one by one starts moving along the path, up the hill where a huge castle sits enthroned above a forest, its windows alit, like hundreds of yellow stars sparkling in the distance.</p><p><br/> “Welcome to Hogwarts”, Wilkes says, grinning, and ushers him into one of the carriages. Crispin sits down and leans his head against the window, staring up at the castle. This is going to be interesting. </p>
