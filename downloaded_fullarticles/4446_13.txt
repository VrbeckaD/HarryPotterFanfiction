    <p>Severus landed at #4 Privat Dr., He looked around and heard various neighbors talking. "Excuse me, can you tell me what happened?"</p><p>"We aren't sure, the house went up in flames fast. They said all three of them were burned."</p><p>"Three?"</p><p>"Yes, Vernon and Petunia Dursley and their son Dudley."</p><p>"Thank you." Severus replied. He was furious, he was lied to. Albus knew Petunia hated magic. She terrorized Lily every time she was home. He began to wonder where was Harry. He quickly moved away from the crowd, pulled out his wand, cast "Point-Me Harry Potter" His wand pointed away from the house and down the street. Severus began to walk and saw a small child, covered in bruises and blood. </p><p>He approached the child and heard him singing quietly.  </p><p>Deck the house with gasoline<br/>
Fa la la la la, la la la la.<br/>
Strike a match and watch the flame<br/>
Fa la la la la, la la la la.<br/>
See the blazing house before us,<br/>
Fa la la la la, la la la la.<br/>
Watch their bodies turn to ashes,<br/>
Fa la la la la, la la la la.<br/>
Now we've learned to play with matches,<br/>
Fa la la la la, la la la la.<br/>
See the pretty lights flashing,<br/>
Fa la la la la, la la la la.</p><p>He glanced back to the house and back to the boy. He was so small. There was no way he was eight. He heard the sounds of a few apparitions, he saw Albus Dumbledore with Minerva and some Aurors. He looked down at Harry. "Harry." No response except for the singing. He knelt in front of Harry. "Harry."</p><p>Harry looked at him, gave him a slight smile. "They can't hurt me now."</p><p>"I know. May I take you someplace safe?" He watched Harry look down the street then back to him. "I promise no one will ever hurt you again." He meant it. No one was going to. Harry nodded his head. "I am going to need to pick you up, so we can leave. I need you to hold your breath and close your eyes." Harry again nodded his head. He stood up and reached down and picked Harry up and apparated them away.</p>
