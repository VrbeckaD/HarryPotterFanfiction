</p><p> </p><p>“Detention Mr Potter!” Snape growled from behind the safety of his desk at the front of the classroom.</p><p>Great.</p><p>What had he done this time?</p><p>Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes as he packed up his books and quill before stuffing them into his bag. He always hated getting singled out in class, especially when it was in front of everyone by the one person he hated more than any other. Professor Snape had always pertained a deep, verging on irrational dislike for him but lately it seemed to be growing worse.</p><p>Harry suspected he knew why.</p><p>The professor had just started teaching the topic of his dreams, Harry had no doubt he knew the subject through and through, but why would Dumbledore pick an ex deatheater to teach students about the Dark Arts? It was a puzzle that Harry didn’t have time to figure out as Snape’s condescending eyes lingered on his form. Though, it was one set of many. Harry dared not turn around as he could practically taste the essence of smug that lingered on Draco’s lips. He wouldn't dare give the blonde wizard the satisfaction of knowing he was aware of it.</p><p>“Class dismissed.” Snape drawled, as if disappointed to see the subject of his torture disseminate from within the the classroom walls. At least that’s how it appeared to Harry as he threw the strap of his bag over his shoulder. He felt the heat of Snape’s eyes dissipate for a mere moment, prompting the young wizard to investigate. He dared to look up, only to realize the professor’s eyes were locked with another, his lips tainted with venom as he smirked at one wizard and one wizard only.</p><p>Draco Malfoy.</p><p>The sight turned Harry’s stomach as he fled from the room. Great, now he had another reason to hate defense against the Dark Arts, as if he actually needed another one.  </p><p>Harry reached into the pocket of his robes as he strode down the dark corridor, his fingers desperately searching the small cavity for his class timetable. The truth was he should know it off by heart by now, only he didn’t. Part of him was reluctant to view the folded up piece of parchment as he suspected today was the dreaded day. Defense against the Dark Arts followed by Potions. He didn’t dread potions as much as he once did now that Slughorn was taking the class, though that in turn gave birth to another kind of pressure, the pressure to stay at the top of the class. It was a title he was never after in the first place, but thanks to that old book in the cupboard, and the half blood prince, he had now inherited it.</p><p>“Ah, Harry my boy!” It was a voice he was only too familiar with as he turned around to greet the man.</p><p>“Professor Dumbledore.” The dark haired wizard offered the Headmaster a smile as he tried to determine the underlying reason the man had chosen this moment to speak with him.</p><p>“Harry, I though we might have a word.”</p><p>“Of course, Headmaster.”</p><p>“Follow me to my office.”</p><p>Harry nodded without hesitation, allowing a deep breath to consume his lungs as he followed the elderly wizard towards a room he was only all too familiar with.</p><p>“Take a seat Harry.” Dumbledore waved his hand toward a vacant couch, it was an offer the boy wouldn’t dare refuse as he sat awkwardly in the middle of it. Albus smiled, collecting a bowl of Licorice snaps in his fingers before holding them out towards the young wizard.</p><p>“I’m fine thank you.”</p><p>“Very well, I might as well get to the crux of why I brought you here today Harry.” Dumbledore sighed as if he were about to deliver a euluge.</p><p>The man’s actions only made Harry more apprehensive as he awaiting the wizard’s words.</p><p>“I’m going on a little adventure tonight and I wondered if you might join me tonight dear Potter.”</p><p>“I can’t professor, you see I have detention with Professor Snape.”</p><p>“Detention? Oh dear, that does surprise me, I do hope you are behaving yourself Harry.”</p><p>“To be honest sir, I don’t exactly know what it is for, maybe he’s getting a head start and it’s for something I haven’t done yet.”</p><p>Albus offered the boy a smile but said nothing more as he rose to his feet before pacing towards his window.</p><p>“He hasn’t inherited an easy life you know.”</p><p>Harry opened his mouth, but words refused to be summoned as he waited for Dumbledore to elaborate, only he didn’t. Silence lingered about the room, slowly growing thicker before finally becoming suffocating.</p><p>“Why does he hate me so much?” Harry severed it, his words a knife against the thick air.</p><p>“Because you remind him of everything he could have had, and you are the promise that he will never have it.”</p><p>“I-I don’t understand.”</p><p>“One day you will. Perhaps that old potions book can teach you more than potions.” Dumbledore winked, his eyes proving to Harry that this the most information he would get out of the Headmaster.</p><p>He was on his own now.</p><p align="center">*~*~*</p><p> </p><p>Harry felt the thick, familiar smoke of potions class compile in his nostrils. The dark, dank classroom didn’t exactly help matters in the slightest. The noise of wooden spoons colliding with cauldrons, knives slicing through whatever was on the recipe board today, Hermione’s heavy breathing all collided in his head. He felt as though it were about to explode. These were all sounds he should have grown accustomed to these five and a half years at Hogwarts, yet today they were only getting under his skin.</p><p>“Aren’t you going to open you book? You can’t exactly follow the recipe when your just staring at the cover you know.” Ron snuck up behind his best friend, causing the dark haired wizard to jump in surprise.</p><p>“Sorry mate, I didn’t mean to scare you.” Ron’s smile faded into concern as his young features became marred with creases.</p><p>“You alright?” The red haired wizard narrowed his eyes on his best friend, suddenly doubting the state of him.</p><p>“Yeah, fine.” Harry lied before quickly shoving the book open as if nothing were wrong.</p><p>Ron continued to stare at him, his eyes combined with his jaw hanging open proving he wasn’t at all convinced.  </p><p>Ron was right and he knew it, but ever since Dumbledore had alluded to the books potential secrets, he had been both curious and a little bit afraid.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p align="center">*~*~*</p><p> </p><p>Curiosity got the better of Harry as he sat up on his bed. Everyone else in his dorm had long fallen asleep. This was the moment he had been waiting for, this was the time he craved the most. He was on his own now, he had time to think without interruption as he clutched his dated potions book with in his grasp. Harry pulled the cover over his head before collecting his wand from the nightstand.</p><p>“Lumos.”</p><p>Harry’s heart pounded as he ran the tip of his wand over the faded cover.</p><p>What secrets did it hold? Why had Dumbledore brought it up when they had been discussing Snape? How did the Headmaster even know he had the book? Then again, this was Dumbledore, he knew just about everything.</p><p>Harry peeled back the cover, an act he had done many times before, only this time he wasn’t after the recipes. He was after something else, only what? Harry turned page after page, his heart began to pound as he approached the back of the book. There was still nothing. Could Dumbledore have been wrong?</p><p>He ran the glowing tip of his wand over the most valuable set of words for this particular task: <em>This book is the property of the half blood Prince.</em> </p><p>Perhaps he should try an old trick Snape himself had used?</p><p>“Reveal your secrets.” Harry whispered, expecting nothing to happen yet praying desperately that it would.</p><p>Harry’s jaw dropped as the pages before him began to multiply, each page falling flawlessly into the next. He sat there mesmerized as delicate inscription rivaling that of a princess began to take shape on the pages before him. Could this really be what Dumbledore was referring to?</p><p>Harry’s jaw hung open as dates and times began to mark the top of various pages.</p><p>Could this be... Snape’s Diary?</p>
