    <p>I did what you’ve all been asking for…I started the PJO/HP crossover fic and am now just starting the 4th chappie! Things are going a bit slow right now bc it’s the beginning (and all beginnings of books are pretty dreary) so I’m just getting some of the basics out of the way. Also, this is my very first crossover fic SO in conclusion, my very first HP/PJO + HoO crossover fic.</p><p>BUT BUT BUT.</p><p>There are some things I want to let y’all know b4 I post the first (and possibly second) chapters of this fic and starting posting the rest as time goes on. Here, I have compiled a list just for y’all (how sweet of me! XD).</p><p>1. Since I have LOTS of shit to do (who knew junior year could be so stressful?), I won’t be updating on the daily. In fact, updates are gonna be quite slow at first until I get the hang of things in my life.</p><p>2. Takes place after the Battle of Hogwarts (during Golden Trio’s ‘seventh year’) and after the Giant War</p><p>3. Harry is arrogant in here (and for a reason too, it’s important to the plot) and tries to compete with Percy (also for a reason) and gets a little crush on Annabeth (also for a reason)</p><p>~ I don’t consider ToA (Trials of Apollo) canon (except for CALEO) so nothing…from that mess is in here</p><p>~No normal wizardry magic can harm the demigods (well…not fatally), except for some potions and any spell a DEMIGOD or DEMIWIZARD uses on them</p><p>~Monsters CAN’T be harmed by wizard magic (unless that certain wizard is SO powerful to mess up the magic of the monster’s very lifeforce (*cough* don’t even consider Harry, trust me *cough*)</p><p>4. The pairings in this book that I will say (for now bc I don’t want to spoil the book) that are non-spoiler are:</p><p>-Percabeth (Percy x Annabeth)<br/> -Jasper/Jiper/Jasiper (Jason x Piper)<br/> -Frazel (Frank x Hazel)<br/> -Caleo (Leo x Calypso)<br/> -Solangelo (Will x Nico)<br/> -Hinny (Harry x Ginny)<br/> So basically all the canon ships XD I’m still contemplating Hinny and whether I want the characters to end up with other ppl but this is likely who I want them to be with.</p><p>5. Hermione is just as suspicious as Harry in here and wants to expose the Americans bc she thinks they’re not really wizards/witches (she just acts like a know-it-all mostly in here at first, also relevant to the plot)</p><p>6. Ron’s just confused with his friends and exasperated by their paranoia (VERY important to the story and there is a MAJOR reason why, although it might be a different version of what you think it is;))</p><p>7. So legit out of the entire trio, Ron is like the only sane one here</p><p>8. Wizards can see through the Mist (something that Demigods use to hide their godly stuff)</p><p>9. There are gonna be demiwizards in here (so basically a demigod and a wizard). Here are two that won’t spoil the story: Draco is a demigod (a son of Zeus) and Luna is a daughter of Iris</p><p>10. Snape is alive (and also a demigod, but he’s not gonna be suuuper chummy like in other fanfics with the demigods, he’ll still show off some of his normal self to them)</p><p>11. Dumbledore is alive as well</p><p>12. There ARE gonna be OC’s, like probably three or four (actually like three and a half bc one of them is not technically an OC…but you’ll see what I’m talking about ;))</p><p>13. Also, there are gonna be deaths sooo…beware of those.</p><p>14. Oh and btw, there are gonna be gay pairings if Solangelo hadn’t given you a clue (I am a multishipper so you might expect me to do one certain pairing among others, based on my other fics but chances are…I’m won't)</p><p>I know it seems like I’m favoring the demigods more than the wizards but like I said, I love both fandoms equally and both authors express the hardships of their characters in different ways. I’m just making the wizards like this bc it is IMPORTANT TO THE PLOT! (I know you’re seeing this a lot and going ‘pff yea right surreee it is’ but I’m so freaking serious, if my story goes the way I want it to go, this will all make sense like in the middle of the fic).</p>
