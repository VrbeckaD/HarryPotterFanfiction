    <p>He stood out amongst the others. Naturally, how could he not when he was at least a foot taller and was hands down the most attractive person there? No, it wasn’t even comparable: this young man was probably the best-looking person Tom Riddle had ever set eyes upon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But there was more to him than just good looks. As a wizard well-experienced in the Dark Arts, Tom knew that there was something special about him. He could see it in his eyes: there was something there that was missing in others: they were the eyes of a leader, the eyes of a person that others would fear to cross. And that was the exact kind of person Tom wanted to recruit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It didn’t come as a surprise that Light Yagami was sorted into Slytherin. As the others had eyed the sorting hat nervously, he’d fearlessly approached it, not even thrown off guard as it spoke to him inside his head. In all the time it had taken for Light to be sorted, Tom hadn’t taken his eyes off him. And no sooner had he taken a seat when Tom swooped down beside him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Light Yagami, it is an honour,” said Tom, outstretching his hand. “Yagami” was not a name associated with purebloods in the UK. However, judging by his looks and his name, Light may have come from somewhere a little further away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I see my reputation has even spread as far as the magical schools of Europe,” Light smirked, flicking his brown hair out of his eyes. “I can’t say that I am surprised. I am the top student in Japan and have represented my country in countless of contests.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sadly, I cannot say that that I’ve heard of you by name per se, but I know a true mastermind when I see one. However, there is something I don’t quite understand. You’ve come in with the first years, but there is no way that you are eleven years old.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You are correct in assuming so. I am seventeen. The wizarding world was so impressed with my abilities that they offered me a place at this school. Ah, but you have not shared your name with me yet.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Light stared at Tom, looking somewhat concerned by his sudden silence. Tom had been trying to process what he’d heard: did Light mean that he was incapable of magic… a muggle? But something else caught his attention: all of a sudden, he was overwhelmed by an unworldly dark presence, something unlike any of the dark magic he’d ever encountered before. Light followed Tom’s gaze before turning back to him with an expression somewhere between puzzlement and perhaps fear.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Can… can you see him?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I cannot. But I can assure you that I’ve never felt a presence so strong. That is some kind of dark magic that is far beyond what can be learned from books. I would be honoured if you were willing to share it with me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Light took a second to process what had been said. But then his face split into a grin, his eyes dark and filled with malice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I think we may be good friends…”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Tom. Tom Riddle.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, Tom Riddle. I believe that this is the beginning of a most beautiful friendship.”</p>
