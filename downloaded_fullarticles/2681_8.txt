    <p>And just like Atlas, I found myself holding the entirety of civilization upon my slim and starving shoulders. I, however, did nothing to deserve punishment as unjust as this.</p>
<p>For the sake of survival, I embedded a knife into my very soul and twisted it until I could twist no longer -- until it shattered under the pressure of the sharp instrument and my soul fell away at the seams.</p>
<p>Not long after the body at my feet begun to cool, the roars of victory rang loud over the decimated castle I once called home. I felt myself grow tired, weary and fatigued. How much longer was I supposed to follow the path others had laid out for me? Was I, the man who died and fought for others, not allowed to live? To be happy?</p>
<p>Days after the Battle did my friends finally pursue me; in tow was Ginevra Weasley, the sister to my friend and brother in all but blood, Ronald Weasley. He looked none too pleased, yet the two women before him beamed in unhidden glee.</p>
<p>I welcomed them into my home, and I was burned soon thereafter. Ginevra was to become my wife, Hermione had spoken. Ronald had apologized following the sudden silence that Hermione's words had brought. "Sorry, mate," he'd said. A grimace evident on his pale and tired features. "mum found a contract buried in dad's workshop. I would've warned you but..." I understood. I felt no ill-will to the youngest Weasley male. He was a good friend, if not jealous and petty at times. He was a child, I could not fault him on his attitude through our Hogwarts years. He had stood with me while I denied the contract and its contents; I had not been so lucky with Hermione.</p>
<p>The women left fuming, and Ronald appeared more tired and distraught than before. I offered him a room to rest in and he took it with a grateful smile. I was not long after that day that I had been struck with a sudden illness. Part of it had been because of the refusal of the contract. I had fainted while talking to Ronald one night and he had caught me mid-fall. The Healers at Saint Mungo's declared that I was dying and I felt no fear, only relief.</p>
<p>Life had not been kind to me. It would make sense that Death wouldn't be either. "You're not dying, Mister Potter," said Ragnar, a Goblin Healer from Gringotts Bank. I had asked him to explain and he gave me a cutting smile. "you're becoming something other. A curse, possibly. Have you touched anything you weren't supposed to? Break anything, perhaps?" My heart stuttered and I stared down at my paper-thin hands. I had snapped the Elder Wand in half and thrown the pieces away soon after the War. "Yes," I replied. My voice soft and my brows furrowed. "the Elder Wand. But it's -- that's just a <em>myth</em>, isn't it? A legend?" The Goblin paused and seemed to give me a pitying look. I hadn't been sure back then, I couldn't decipher the emotions of Goblin's as I can now. "All legends have some truth behind them, Mister Potter. It's just the matter of finding out where the truth lives."</p>
<p>I drew my shoulders up and hunched my back as if the stance I held could protect me from the onslaught of emotions that overcame me. I had asked Healer Ragnar what I should do. He gave me a considering look. "Accept it."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, I did.<br/> </p>
