    <p>Hermione sipped her lukewarm cappuccino as she browsed her laptop in the muggle cafe. She could charm the coffee hotter but she wasn’t in the mood. She didn’t really mind it that much. If The Burrow had WiFi she’d look for a new flat there but unfortunately this was the best she could do.</p><p>Not that it wasn’t extremely nice of the Weasleys to let her live with them! It was and she truly appreciated it, but since her and Ron has broken up and since she’d finished her 8th year at Hogwarts, she felt it was time to move on. Australia would be ideal, to find her parents, but she knew she wasn’t ready for that yet. She would need more training with her old professors and the doctors at St. Mungo’s if she had any chance of learning how to safely reverse her own “Obliviate.”</p><p>She came across a listing that seemed too cheap to be true. Maybe she’d misread it. Hermione gulped the rest of her coffee and rubbed her tired eyes before refocusing her pupils on the words on her screen. She was right the first time. A 2-bedroom flat with a male roommate in Wiltshire. She could get a bus from there. Maybe apparate eventually if her roommate didn’t question it. </p><p>Hermione cast muffliato and pulled her cellphone from her beaded clutch to call the number listed for the flat. It was late and she was only planning to leave a message but he answered. He sounded relieved that someone wanted the other room, which Hermione knew couldn’t be good but she ignored her gut.</p><p>“Is there anything else I should know about the place?” she tried to sound formal.</p><p>The man on the phone grunted and sounded like he was shaking his head, “No no, water, heat, and electric are covered in the rent. If anything breaks you can call me anytime. My name is Tom by the way.”</p><p>Hermione was briefly haunted by a memory of Voldemort before she could shake it away. She mentally reminded herself what a common name Tom is, the asked about appliances.</p><p>“Each unit has a dishwasher. Laundry room is on the first floor. Your roommate already bought the little things.”</p><p>“Little things?”</p><p>“He has a coffee maker and a tv.”</p><p>Hermione glanced around the coffee shop nervously. No one could hear her. She asked about the roommate.</p><p>He tried to dodge the question but she asked again.</p><p>Tom sighed resignedly, “he’s not an easy man to live with. I’ve been through 4 roommates with him already.”</p><p>Hermione clutched her beaded purse. She carried everything she owned with her all the time, a habit from the war. She didn’t have to go back to The Burrow at all if she said:</p><p>“I’ll take my chances with him. Can you move me in tonight?”</p><p>The man on the phone was a bit stunned to say the least but agreed to meet Hermione. She agreed to pay her first months rent and move in right now.</p><p>She stepped out into the cool night air and walked until she was away from the streetlights. Then she apparated to her new home.</p><p>The landlord was surprised by how quickly she got there but she only smiled and didn’t bother explaining. He unlocked led her up several flights of stairs until they reached the top floor. When he unlocked the door, Hermione thought the living room was even larger and nicer than the photos online made it seem. There must be a catch. Still, with a rate so cheap she should at least try it. She could use the money she saved toward rare potion ingredients to help with her research and training.</p><p>She gave the kitchen a cursory once over. She checked the bathroom and saw it was clean and well stocked with towels and luxury men’s grooming products. She tried to open one bedroom door and found it locked. She turned around and the door directly across from it was unlocked. The room was pretty bare but already furnished with a bed and a nightstand. It was enough.</p><p>She discovered the catch when she told the landlord she’d take it. He brought her back to his office to sign the lease and give her a key, and sign a non disclosure agreement. Hermione questioned him but he was adamant that he couldn’t tell her unless she signed so reluctantly she did, curiosity outweighing her good judgement.</p><p>Tom grumbled, “your roommate, now he’s not dangerous!” The words made Hermione’s stomach flip. “But, he’s on probation. He’s a war criminal. But like, you can’t look him up online because it wasn’t a war for our kind of people. You know what I mean?”</p><p>How this man managed to be both vague and detailed just enough to terrify her, Hermione had no idea. She shook her head and Tom took pity and relented, giving her more details.</p><p>“His name is Draco Malfoy. He’s not a bad kid, I can vouch for him! He’s just a bit rough around the edges. War will do that to ya!” </p><p>Hermione was unfortunately afraid she knew exactly what he meant but good godric how would any muggle know what he meant? How did he even know what he meant? Of course everyone knew what a war war but they didn’t know wizarding war.</p><p>“No,” she said decidedly, still testing the waters with Tom. “I don’t understand what kind of war criminal can’t be googled. Is that a fake name?”</p><p>Tom sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose, “Miss..” he shuffled his papers until he found her name on one of them, “Granger. Do you believe in magic?”</p><p>Hermione shrugged. Of course she did but she was curious how much this man would reveal to a muggle. He’d already told her Malfoy was a war criminal and she hadn’t even met him yet, supposedly. No wonder he couldn’t hold down a roommate.</p><p>Tom leaned in and whispered, as if he was telling a secret. He was telling a secret actually, but they were alone. “I didn’t. But I had to learn so much to take that man as a tenant and most people just don’t want to learn that magic is real and it’s not magical, it’s a war.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. She wanted to leave but she had to ask, “what happens to the old roommates who found out about magic?”</p><p>“The magic government has a way of erasing their memory.” Hermione shuddered. If for nothing else, she’d have to be Malfoy’s roommate so no one else would be Obliviated.</p>
