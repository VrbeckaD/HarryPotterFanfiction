  <b>Chapter 1: The Platform</b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It wasn't as if he hadn't been expecting it. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Standing in a hallway with one of his best mates, James Potter grumbled to himself. He had known Remus wanted to break the news to him for half the summer but he had selfishly hoped Remus would feel too much guilt to go through with it.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Prongs, I'm sorry. I just can't keep doing it." It was more a nervous plea than a statement of resignation, as he spoke, Remus’s eyes shifted and he fidgeted with is fingers, wringing them nervously. James sighed, knowing he could not ask Remus to keep doing something he wasn't invested in, even if he wished he could persuade him otherwise. Remus was too good a friend to press into service, and lord new he had enough on his plate to stress about with our adding quiditch to the mix.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Moony don't sweat it, McGonagall will pick someone else." His hand automatically rose to sweep through his already messy mop of hair, belaying his discomfort with the idea of a stranger taking up Remus's post. "I know you only volunteered last year to help me out, and you didn't even do much anyway."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The slight jab eased the tension between the two friends, as it was meant to and both boys laughed and turned to head back into the sitting room down the hall.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Really James, that's why I am stepping down, so that this year you can have a manager who knows something about the sport. Someone who can hopefully give you a hand, maybe even make your job easier." The smile and easy confidence had returned to Remus's face as he nudged James with his elbow.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James returned the grin, but with less ease and confidence as he let the truth of that statement settle around him. More than likely, McGonagall would be flooded with raving fourth year girls eager to fill the role of team manager. The team would be stuck with someone who would only show up to stare at James’s male quiditch mates and make herself even less helpful than Remus had been. But James did not share these fears as they reemerged into the sitting room occupied by the rest of his friends. He felt no need to make Remus feel like he was leaving him in the lurch.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tomorrow started their sixth year at Hogwarts. Tomorrow, he would beg Professor McGonagall not to appoint a manager at all.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Platform 9 ¾ was deserted when sixteen-year-old Lily Evans arrived. She was not surprised however, as it was 7:34 in the morning and the train did not depart until eleven.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She stood for a moment and marveled at the empty platform, even devoid of the shining red steam engine she would be boarding in a few hours. In the five years she had been coming to the platform, it had never been empty before, not even close. The uncharacteristic emptiness filled her with an uneasy awareness of how alone she was. The ominous cover of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Daily Prophet</span>
  </em>
  <span> she carried with her was a reminder of how dangerous it was to be by oneself during these dark times. Lily shrugged her shoulders subconsciously, pushing off the nerves she felt, knowing there was nothing to be done about it now.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mr. Evans usually scrambled his schedule to make the time to deliver his youngest to the Hogwarts Express, juggling the sporting events he covered and submitting his articles well before his deadlines so he could afford the hour it took to see Lily off. He took his job as a sports writer very seriously and was one of the most respected in his field. This year however, he had been unable to find the time on September the first for his youngest and Lily was honestly surprised it had taken this long for her father to disappear from this aspect of her life as well. Her older sister Petunia had reluctantly agreed to deliver Lily to Kings Cross on her way to work. Her agreement had only been secured after Lily had threatened that missing the train would mean she would still be at home.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>If Lily had found herself in this predicament before this year, it would have been easy to travel to Kings Cross with Severus. But Severus was no longer an option and Lily pushed him out of her mind, not wanting to dwell on what she had lost at the end of her fifth year.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With a sigh, she double-checked that her wand was tucked safely into her zip-up and wheeled her trunk against a wall. She set herself on it, crossing her legs, her kitten curled in its small carrier next to her. She felt safer with her back against the wall and the platform visible all around her. Lily Evans stared sadly at the cover of the Daily Prophet for a moment before flipping past the doom and gloom splashed across the front page. Opening to the sports section, she settled in to read.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>***</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Two hours later she still sat alone, now hoping that the train would arrive before anyone else appeared on the platform. Lily would have preferred to hide her extremely early arrival and avoid the need to explain her singular presence. However at half past nine she still sat alone and felt slightly awkward that she would soon be discovered. She suppressed her discomfort, reminding herself there was nothing embarrassing about being prompt. Busying herself with the paper, she pretended not to notice the boisterous group entering at the other end of the platform.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Mum! We beat the train! I told you we could have slept in." James Potter looked smugly down at his mother with a gleam of mischief in his hazel eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His mother, a petite woman with the same mischievous air, laughed and swatted his arm. "Oh James, I can't help that you are finally growing up! Last year I woke you lot at the same time and we almost </span>
  <em>
    <span>missed</span>
  </em>
  <span> the train."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her heels clicked as she walked further onto the platform, gesturing with her arms wide, "I did always like seeing the platform empty as a girl," she smiled and turned in a circle, catching sight of Lily against the far wall, "We are not the first! Isn't that Miss Evans?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James’s head shot up in surprise. When he caught sight of the slight redhead sitting on her trunk, a huge grin spread across his face. It took no time for James to cross the platform, his long stride eating up the distance as the sound of his mother's tittering voice stalled his three friends in the background. As solemn as his marauder vows were, his mother would always be his first accomplice. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>At the end of their fifth year, James Potter and Lily Evans had come to an understanding. A number of events had transpired just before OWLS, resulting in a fight the likes of which had not been seen before in the Gryffindor common room and was likely - well <em>hopefully</em> - never to be seen again. Words had been exchanged and a promise of violence had hung in the air, warding off any of their friends who would have intervened. But by the end of OWLS, James found himself still pondering the last thing Lily shouted at him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>"Potter, how do you expect to date me when you don't even know me?"</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That was exactly what James resolved to do. As they left the Hogwarts Express to begin their summer, he stopped her on the platform after she ahd said goodbye to her friends and told her so.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"</span>
  <em>
    <span>Evans!" He shouted, chasing after her off the train. She whirled, red hair flying, and shot him a venomous glare.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"</span>
  <em>
    <span>I am going to get to know you, Evans. Because you were right." Eyes wide, he held his breath as she looked up at him, her expression softened in thought as she stayed silent for a long moment.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"</span>
  <em>
    <span>In that case, you could try calling me Lily." Her smile was small and hesitant and did not reach her eyes, as though she didn't feel comfortable with her own decision. She turned to leave but James called out again.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"</span>
  <em>
    <span>Lily!" She stopped but only to look back questioningly over her shoulder. "Have a good summer." He waved her off and smiled brilliantly. She smiled hesitantly and called over her shoulder,</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>"Same to you James."</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With thoughts of what had passed between them the last time they stood on Platform 9 ¾ , James approached her with an exuberant smile, only slightly hesitant of disturbing the tenuous peace established at the start of summer. Two months could have strengthen her resolve towards friendship, or given her enough time to regret their tenuous peace. At this moment Lily seemed completely unaware of his approach, poring over her newspaper with a pencil and a focused expression.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Hey Lily."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The sound of his voice shocked her out of a quiditch-score haze. Her arms flew up, sending the paper and pencil flying. The trunk, still on the trolley, rolled forward as she hopped back against the brick wall. She let out a loud yelp and her green eyes grew large as she fell backwards. James stepped forward quickly, blocking the trolley with his leg and stopping her fall with his hands, catching Lily up behind her head and waist.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His smile was dazzling but honest as he said, "Caught you," as if she were the snitch. She stared dumbfounded into his hazel eyes as he lifted her easily and slid the trunk back under her. Time felt like it had slowed to a crawl as Lily's mind jumped from memories of their last encounter on the platform to her lonely summer, the first summer she ever spent friendless, and the part James had played in it.  She had also spent a whole summer brooding and pondering their fragile truce, and Potter’s proclamation of his intentions. Just as James had settled her back on solid ground, her mind settled and echoed with resolve.</span>
  <em>
    <span> 'Give him a chance'. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Lily sighed as she said his name, almost like a breath she didn’t know she was holding.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Potter." James’s eyes flashed and she stuttered, "er...James" She instantly felt silly, wondering why she suddenly found herself so inarticulate.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But Potter didn't miss a beat. "Present," he quipped, "which is more than I can say for you."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She bristled momentarily before seeing the look of amusement in his eyes, tinged only with warmth and lacking any of the malice she had expected to see.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Cool it, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Lily thought to herself.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Sorry, you startled me,” she said aloud.  “Oh, bugger, and now I've lost my pencil!" She scrambled about the top of the trunk picking up her </span>
  <em>
    <span>Daily </span>
  </em>
  <span>Prophet and scooting closer to the cat-cage to make room for James on the end. She did not notice the steadying hand James left on the trunk that kept it steady for her. </span>
  <span>Lily kept her eyes trained on the sports page for a moment longer before looking at James, feeling slightly unsure of how to approach him as a candidate for friendship, so she tried to keep it light.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"How long have you been on the platform? I think it looks quite odd without the train." She cringed to herself wondering why she had chosen something she hadn't wanted him to notice. Why hadn’t she just gone with the generic, '</span>
  <em>
    <span>how was your summer?</span>
  </em>
  <span>' But seeing as that was also a subject she wished to avoid, she supposed it was a lose-lose situation.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James cast a sidelong look at her before gazing at the spot soon to be filled by the massive engine. "I just got here. How long have </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> been waiting?" James’s tone was conspiring as if he suspected something, and Lily had a suspicion that he would be displeased to learn she had been sitting at the station alone for over two hours. "Long enough to read the Prophet cover to cover I see,” he said. “Is that a muggle paper you have there as well?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James turned his full gaze on her and behind his glasses; Lily could see the beginnings of a reprimand. The high handed and imperious James Potter was lurking beneath the surface. But reminding herself of her promise to give James Potter a second chance, she firmly skirted the issue, giving him the choice to move towards friendship rather than to adopt his usual high-handed attitude. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Yes,” Lily said. “Well, nothing interesting in either today I'm afraid. Have you seen the sports page? There is a very interesting preview of the rest of the season." She held it out to him, hoping he would disregard the notes covering the margins, a clear sign she had indeed been on the platform for quite some time.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James scanned the pages and behind his glasses his eyes narrowed once again. Fearing the upcoming rebuke from pretentious Potter, Lily prepared herself to let go of the idea of James as a candidate for friendship. So when the next words out of his mouth were, "You really think the Cannons are going to beat Falmouth this weekend?" she took longer than usual to answer.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Well, yes. The Falcons will be forced to start their back-up seeker because Nathanson is suspended. The second stringer is definitely back up for a reason, rather awful if you ask me. Not to mention Faungood has been out for a month. His arm will be out of practice! And yes, the Cannons as a team are rather rubbish this season, but not their keeper. Racking up points will be hard for Falmouth without their chasers in tip-top shape, especially against McPherson." She paused and looked up at his face, noting that both eyebrows were raised behind his glasses before continuing, "Besides I can't resist rooting for the underdog."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James let out a low whistle and leaned back against the wall. "Well Miss Evans, I never knew you were so well-versed in quiditch! I am pleasantly surprised."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She looked down with a half-smile "You aren't going to argue? No one picks the Cannons over anyone, especially not against the Falmouth Falcons."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"No, I think you are spot on. I’ve been arguing with Sirius over that match for the past week, I am glad to have found an ally."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lily laughed at that. "I think that is the first time we have agreed on anything."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Hogwarts Expressed arrived unnoticed by the two as they spoke, and the platform was suddenly filled with people. Lily found herself relieved to have her first encounter with James Potter unfolding quite well. Knowing that even as friends they would have their share of disputes, she was glad they avoided any confrontation in their first conversation of the year. It felt like a fresh start.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James walked her to the train and helped her load her trunk and her cat cage she kept with her. The ginger tomcat was on the small side, with big, light-green eyes and long whiskers.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James looked closely into the cage, smirking at the similarities in color between kitten and owner. "What's his name?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Sir Lionel." Lily's tone was matter of fact as she pushed aside a twinge of uncertainty, worried the bullying toe-rag Potter she remembered from her first five years at Hogwarts would reemerge to taunt her. Even she acknowledged to herself that naming her cat a peer of the realm was a bit odd.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Instead, James smiled and asked "Little lion is it?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lily forced herself to relax and gave James a quivering smiled. "No, it's </span>
  <em>
    <span>Sir </span>
  </em>
  <span>Lionel. You can drop the title once you become better acquainted." She pulled her messenger bag over her shoulder. "Thanks for your help, James. I'll see you on the train."</span>
</p>
<p><span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Across the platform Remus Lupin was grinning smugly, while one Sirius Black, was gaping like a fish. Having expected the first of many catastrophic fights to explode between James and Lily, the sight of them sitting together on her trunk looking almost amicable had been rather shocking.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"It would seem Mrs. Potter was right about him growing up,” Remus said to a still bewildered Sirius Black. </span>
