    <p>Draco cannot recall a time he’d ever been as offended by a finger being curled towards someone’s palm.</p><p>And yet here he was, his jaw loose and his eyes boggled out of his head at Granger.</p><p>Because there was no way that Hermione Granger, the swottiest of swots, had admitted to a group of her peers that she’d gotten off in the Library. Were it not warm and light outside, he’d assume it were Christmas.</p><p>“I — “ Granger gargled. “The game isn’t about details. It’s about honesty.”</p><p>Michael Corner, who’d convinced her to join in, laughed.</p><p>“Never have I ever shagged Weasley,” Blaise said with a smarmy grin.</p><p>And her fingers remained up as much as her brow, which was arched at Blaise. “You aren’t supposed to target people.”</p><p>“You’re very focused on rules for someone who disgraced the school Library." Draco lip curled around the sentence like it were a fine wine. Tart, a little sharp, and every bit as intoxicating as the embarrassment that spewed across Granger’s face.</p><p>“Never have I ever,” said Abbott, who was beside Longbottom. She sucked the spit between her teeth as if in deep thought. “Shagged in the Quidditch change rooms.”</p><p>Draco, Blaise, and Pansy all dropped a finger at once, which sent the group into laughter all around. It was strange, to hear their Eighth year dorms full of laughter. But it was the end of May and if they were going to get drunk, it might as well be a week before their exams. They’d written so many essays their hands were shaped like claws around invisible quills. And Draco smiled at Blaise as if to discern who he’d had in the change rooms.</p><p>The game wasn’t very fun given that Pansy shared many of her confessions with him. But at least he was never as alone as Granger, who had put down two fingers. One for the Library, the other for if they’d gotten off in the dorms. Which granted, everyone had lost to.</p><p>But the fire whiskey was strong and the tension was palpable.</p><p>Michael and Granger never joined their peers in such games. They were busy with patrols and mentorship and all that boorish time-wasting. They were more invested in the school than Draco could understand, but at least it wasn’t him. He leaned back into the black leather couch, the same one that he’d claimed at the start of the semester. The visitor’s quarters from Fourth year, given their limited numbers and their age gap with the First years.</p><p>They were adults, after all. As if he wanted to wallow in the muck with the children when he could sip fire whiskey by firelight.</p><p>Not that he deserved the joy, but he was too relaxed for self-pity right now.</p><p>The game petered out as Longbottom and Abbott broke into a debauched confession of how they’d uprooted a slew of mandrakes by mistake and…</p><p>He’s distracted if he’s honest.</p><p>Not for the first time.</p><p>Draco rested his elbow on his knee, his eyes narrowed at Granger. She had a glass of water next to her fire whiskey and a droop to her eyelids. She hadn’t touched the fire whiskey he noticed. He didn’t know why, but he had. She lifted it as if she were about to drink and then she’d set it aside. He knew the gesture, as he’d been doing the same. His glass remained full though he took a slight sip every so often. Not enough to get drunk, not like the rest of them. </p><p>(Excluding Granger.)</p><p>“— his fault!” Pansy shoved Draco hard in the shoulder.</p><p>Which sent fire whiskey down his front. The full glass meant that he was coated, collarbone to crotch, and all he could do was deadpan at the girl.</p><p>“Oops?”</p><p>“Let me clean it,” Blaise said with a lazy tongue.</p><p>“As if I want a drunkard pointing their wand at me,” Draco spat.</p><p>“I’m only a wee bit drunk,” Blaise pouted.</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes. He’d left his wand in his dorm as he’d felt safe enough without it. He got to his feet without a word, to stalk towards his dorm. The laughter waited at least until he was through the archway to the boys’ dorm. There were so few of them that they had a private room each. The wing had been designed with the Triwizarding tournament. Thirty identical rooms were laid in either corridor, though he took the right path. He didn’t care that whiskey dripped along the floor, not until he heard someone shuffle and slip behind him.</p><p>But he had no wand —</p><p>Draco pivoted, to grab whoever it was. He assumed it was Pansy out to apologize, and he was somewhat right. It’d been Granger, slight and similar to Pansy. He always assumed Granger was big, given her hair, but his hand cleared her wrist and his fingers overlapped around it. She had her wand out and wide eyes, a sight that made his stomach clench.</p><p>“We made it this far in the year without a fight,” he said, his tone thin.</p><p>And it was true. Draco had been on his best behavior, as the Ministry had a direct link with Hogwarts. If he stepped out of line or misbehaved, he’d be sent to Azkaban. He’d avoided Granger like she were cyanide but now all he can think is how she’s not as plain as she had been, before.</p><p>Granger didn’t fight against his grip, her gaze wary up at him.</p><p>“I’m not drunk.”</p><p>“I…” Granger trailed off. “I wanted to help you, with your shirt.”</p><p>“It’s more than my shirt,” he said with a wry smile, which was as close to a smile as she’d ever get from him.</p><p>Granger made a strange face up at him as if she wanted to argue the point with him.</p><p>He let go of her wrist, aware that it’d been far too much to remain. His face scrunched up as he stepped back, the whiskey washed all the way down to his shoes. He returned to his stride — and then he stopped. He swooped back to her with a sizable gap left between them.</p><p>Granger took a step back, her brow set.</p><p>“Who’d you get off in the Library with? Weasley?”</p><p>Granger let out a laugh.</p><p>“Potter?”</p><p>Her laughter faded but the mirth didn’t disappear. Instead, she narrowed her eyes up at him, a defiant distance between them. They weren’t friends. She didn’t owe him anything, least of all an answer to such a question. She looked over her shoulder as if it were some grand secret, and he supposed it was.</p><p>It wasn’t as if Granger was known for such things.</p><p>Granger lifted her head, an air of superiority that made him want to grab her by the throat. “I never said someone else was involved.” She gave him a once over, to the fire whiskey stained clothes he wore. And she waved her wand, as simple as anything, and a horrible wash of warmth and light brushed him from head to toe.</p><p>His arms remained outward at ninety-degree angles, his fingers formed into claws.</p><p>“You should get some sleep,” she stashed her wand. “We have a practice exam tomorrow morning, you will want to be prepared for it.” And she turned, to head back towards the group.</p><p>Draco watched her go, a pit in his stomach that growled and grew as she walked away. He’d kept away from her all year, terrified of her, terrified of everything between them. He wasn’t some changed man, out to prove the world wrong. He was the same man, driven, loyal, calculating — the last trait is what kept him in place. She didn’t have to say that. She could have said it was a lie, that it was a joke, but for some reason, Granger is a proud girl with an honest streak.</p><p>She lied often, he was sure. She lied about plenty of rule-breaking.</p><p>So she was either lying about this for fun.</p><p>Or —</p><p>Draco jogged after her before she could reach the end of the corridor. She’d slowed her gait, just a fraction, and tipped her head to watch his approach.</p><p>“Why confess?”</p><p>Granger narrowed her eyes at him. “Because no one would believe you.”</p><p>And she left.</p><p>As if he gave her permission to leave.</p><p>As if he wanted her to stay.</p><p>Draco remained fixed to the spot, an empty spot formed in his chest. He couldn’t quantify it, but it hadn’t been there before. His hand hovered by his ribs as if she’d yanked out his liver for a laugh. Beneath his long fingers, he felt warm cotton… Which was strangely vanilla scented, as if she’d struck him with an extra layer of charms. She was such a show-off.</p><p>He changed once he was in his dorm because his clothes smelled like her now. He tossed them into a corner and crawled into bed without even bothering with pajamas.</p><p>Five minutes later, he’d come like it was a chore. He growled her name like a threat to the open air, anger bubbled in his veins because he’d not done that since Fifth year if that. And of all the stupid people, of all the insufferable idiots, why did it have to be Granger that thrust his cock against his palm. He couldn’t picture it, not perfectly. It was shapeless shadows, her seated on a desk, or a seat, between books, in the aisles. He couldn’t decide what was best.</p><p>Worse than that, he came, but it wasn’t…</p><p>It wasn’t enough. Like, yes, functionally he’d come, but it felt so shallow. But he was tired and they had practice exams, and he’d throw himself into the Great Lake naked before he jerked off to the thought of Hermione Granger a second time.</p><p>(He was already damned for the first time, he didn’t want to make it worse.)</p><p>…</p><p>Granger couldn’t know, of course.</p><p>But he felt like she might, given the sly smile she shot his way as she passed him in the dorm. But his guilty deference betrayed him as he stared at a tapestry, an essay flaccid in his grip. He strained the parchment to read it, but Granger dawdled, back and forth, her hands and mouth moving so much that he had to look at her.</p><p>She was practicing for an exam, and she looked ridiculous.</p><p>Draco glared at her as she walked although her pace remained predictable. As if she didn’t care that he was glaring at her. Which was annoying in itself, as she’d been such an irrelevant element all year. He’d not thought about her outside of his usual fare, of how he’d loathe her need to answer every question. But they’d remained out of one another’s paths.</p><p>And now she was here, pacing and mouthing around shapes.</p><p>And it was annoying.</p><p>“Must you do that here?”</p><p>“Do what?” Granger had the audacity to look surprised.</p><p>“Pacing,” he gestured at her with his essay which fluttered. “Mumbling.”</p><p>“Oh, sorry,” she smiled a weak smile. “I’m waiting for Michael.”</p><p>“Adorable,” Draco said like it were the worst insult he could muster.</p><p>Granger’s lips twitched as if she’d not caught the spite. “We aren’t dating if that’s what you mean.”</p><p>“No, you’re a future victim of the Weasley clan,” he withdrew from her, to slouch back onto the couch.</p><p>“I… What?”</p><p>“The number of children they have — it’s a death sentence.”</p><p>“No, I’m not with Ron.”</p><p>Draco tipped his head just a little, just enough to look up at her from his patented patent leather couch. He kept his expression distant and sharp to avoid any softness that had formed from his surprise.</p><p>Granger shrugged a shoulder as she turned to look at Longbottom, who stumbled in with a huff and a puff.</p><p>“Michael’s cramming for his Astronomy exam tonight.”</p><p>“He… Did he forget he had it?”</p><p>“They moved the exams for Astronomy around, clouds,” Neville waved a hand. He shot Draco a sharp look as if he wanted to kick him in the stomach where he laid.</p><p>Draco smiled, an edge like a knife as his teeth flashed. It was the cruel sort of smile you gave behind your parents’ back to the ugly children they forced you to play with.</p><p>Granger watched as Neville tromped off towards the corner where Abbott had a bunch of snacks and a little pile of books. Draco wanted to go over, to steal their sweets and toss their books into the fire. As if anyone was allowed to be happy at school in the middle of exams, the absolute gall — </p><p>“Draco.”</p><p>Draco’s hand defaulted to his chest as if someone had driven a dagger to the hilt between his ribs.</p><p>“I need to do patrols, and… You aren’t busy, are you?” Granger stared at him, her hands on her hips. It wasn’t a question, no matter how lilted her tone was.</p><p>“I am busy. Incredibly busy.”</p><p>“Well, you were a Prefect, so you know the drill.”</p><p>“I said I’m busy.”</p><p>“I can’t do patrols alone. If I get cornered, or if something really is going on, I need someone with me, it’s protocol.”</p><p>Draco stared up at her as if he were waiting for the offer to dissipate. But Granger remained, her arms crossed and her brows furrowed.</p><p>“You either offer to help, or I’ll go ask McGonagall and she’ll make you help.”</p><p>“I preferred when you hated me,” Draco hissed with a wave of his arm.</p><p>“I never hated you,” Granger said with a visible bob in her throat. </p><p>Draco shoved himself to his feet which gave him the advantage of height. And with Granger, he needed every advantage he could get. She was clever and deadly, two factors that were easy to forget given how plain she looked. She wasn’t angular or cruel, she wasn’t a clear threat. She was soft brown eyes wrapped with a mop of brown hair, which she’d braided into a messy knot at the base of her neck. She was as threatening as a maid in a stage play, the sort you didn’t even look at twice.</p><p>And yet he stood there, his gaze fixed on her.</p><p>“I felt sorry for you but I never hated you,” Granger said like it were poison, slipped through his ears and into his mind.</p><p>Draco grimaced through his wounded pride, his throat tight and his shoulders squared. He had a choice. He could turn away the request and make McGonagall have to come down here, to yell at him. Or, painfully enough, he could help her. It wouldn’t be much help, he doubted Granger needed him with her. She had fought the Dark Lord, she had survived, she was so strong, blah, blah, blah. He’d been smothered in praise of her since the end of the war.</p><p>As if the war had actually ended.</p><p>“Fine,” he spat as if he might bite her.</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>They set off on a patrol of the Fifth floor, then the Sixth. They’d work their way up then back down to the Fourth floor. Their dorms were on the Fourth floor, after all, it only made sense. The visitors’ quarters had been set up beside the Library and near some abandoned Study Halls. It didn’t matter that he’d been at this school for eight years now, he’d never see every inch of it. He’d done a few patrols of the upper floors, but he’d usually been kept to the lower floors and the dungeons.</p><p>They paced the Sixth floor in silence.</p><p>The same with the Seventh.</p><p>But he’d watched her because the portraits were all asleep and the air was still. Exam time bred weary students and so this patrol thing was a scam. Draco refused to look at Granger directly, refused to acknowledge her, and she permitted this. She had her chin high and her eyes wide as if she expected to be attacked at any moment.</p><p>Draco’s gaze skimmed the empty tapestry rungs, up to the left.</p><p>The spot across from the Room of Requirement.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Granger said. “About Crabbe.”</p><p>“It was his own stupid fault,” Draco swallowed hard.</p><p>Granger stared at him through the shadows and he pretended not to notice.</p><p>Silence swallowed them again in their silent patrol. He should have left her to her precious patrol. It wasn’t as if he had nothing better to do. He could stand on the spot and slam his head into a wall for all the good that would do. But he continued, his pace as swift as she’d match. She didn’t seem pleased either, it wasn’t as if she wanted to be here with him.</p><p>“I don’t need your pity,” Draco said, his voice tense.</p><p>“I don’t pity you.” Granger dropped her head, her brows furrowed. “I said that I felt sorry for you. For Crabbe.”</p><p>“Which is pitying — ”</p><p>“There’s a difference,” Granger stopped, which was the opposite of what he wanted.</p><p>Draco looked at her across his shoulder. He’d avoided her for the entire school year. Why now, why several weeks away from their last days together?</p><p>Why couldn’t she stay away?</p><p>“Feeling sorry for someone is pity,” Draco said in a strangled voice. </p><p>“I think there’s a difference.”</p><p>Draco crossed his arms to stop his hands from twitching. He wanted to grab his wand, to<em> Confund</em> her and leave her in this hallway. She could do the damn patrol on her own, as she should have when Corner had double-booked.</p><p>“Pity is more distant. Feeling sorry for someone is more — empathetic,” she said, stripped of what confidence she had before.</p><p>“Empathetic?” He snorted.</p><p>“You had no chance,” Granger said, her voice clear. “Your family was already trapped into their allegiance before you were born, everything was stacked against you. While you took to your side the same way we took to ours, I can’t help but wonder if we’d only… That is, I wish that we’d been able to help you, maybe we could have — ”</p><p>“No. We’re not doing this,” Draco said with a wave of his hand. He pivoted to continue along the corridor, his arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>Her little heels clicked on the floor behind him, closer.</p><p>Draco continued unaffected, his chin raised as high.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Granger said with a heavy huff. “I’m sorry that we let you down.”</p><p>The silence returned between them as he picked apart her words. It was idiotic, of course. He had chosen his side, his side had lost. His family had defected just before the loss and his mother had helped bring down the Dark Lord. She’d done her best and she’d succeeded. It was a small miracle that he and his father both remained out of Azkaban, but Potter had insisted. He had testified, as had a handful of others. Including Granger, who’d never mentioned it, never asked him about it.</p><p>If she wanted a tearful thank you or gratitude, she could shove it up her arse. No. He was on this stupid patrol at her request and that was as close as he’d ever get to gratitude towards her. He’d not even thanked her for her concern the other night, or how she’d cleaned his clothes for him. Which brought him back to the worst part of this patrol; that scent of vanilla and how it’d worsen when she worried her hair.</p><p>They looped the Seventh floor, then the Sixth.</p><p>By the Fifth floor, he’d began to trust the silence.</p><p>And then they were on the Fourth floor which meant they’d be back to the dorms.</p><p>“The Library,” Granger said with a croak. “We have to clear the Library.”</p><p>Draco gritted his teeth.</p><p>“There’s a book Madame Pince uses by the front desk, it detects students in the Library,” she said with a rushed tone. She waved him after her towards the great, tall doors that opened up into the Library. It didn’t matter how many times he entered the place, it made his breath catch. For all his malice and showmanship, he did enjoy school. He loved to read and he especially loved to be right. His gaze skirted the lower shelves and the bird-like waft of books through the shelves.</p><p>A set of encyclopedias was in hot pursuit of a dictionary above like crows after a sparrow.</p><p>He smirked.</p><p>His gaze dropped down to Granger who’d crouched down beside the front desk. He stared unabashedly at her arse for there was fuck all else to do. He leaned back against a shelf, his arms crossed to match his ankles as he watched her search.</p><p>She’s so much more agreeable from this angle, even in the dark shadows and the dim light. He didn’t even hesitate as he pictured how easy it’d be to yank up her robes and grab her by the hips, to fuck her until he’d worked through whatever strange fascination had appeared when she’d confessed her masturbatory fantasy — because she couldn’t really have gotten off in the Library on her own.</p><p>“Here,” she said with an exhale, a pleased look on her face as she showed him the book.</p><p>His expression betrayed none of the thoughts, for they were only thoughts.</p><p>Granger slapped the book down onto the desk, the thick red leather so soft it arched with the pressure. She smoothed it, over and over. Whatever incantations and runes she were inciting spilled from her, her fingers in motion as her hair crackled with electricity. And then the book shuddered as if it’d been brought to life. It flapped once, twice, then shot off into the dark.</p><p>“Is it…”</p><p>“If no one was here, nothing would happen,” Granger said with a frown.</p><p>Draco groaned as he pushed away from the shelves. She’d already sprinted after it so he was left on a wild Niffler chase, off after the girl like he had nothing better to do.</p><p>(The head slamming thing; that would be better.)</p><p>He darted through the Charms section, through to Divination. He caught the whips of Granger’s robe and hair, then her foot, her elbow. He chased her and she chased the book. And by the time he saw her, the back of her, she was frozen in place. His stomach turned over on itself as he whipped out his wand, his eyes wide.</p><p>He stalked closer to shove her backward, against the shelves, his wand pointed at whoever the book had found.</p><p>Michael Corner and some Ravenclaw girl that Draco didn’t recognize were huddled in the corner with feigned nonchalance.</p><p>“Astronomy preparation, hm?” Draco said with a laugh.</p><p>“Well, it — we were,” Michael said with a heavy scowl. “We needed a textbook.”</p><p>“For reference,” the girl added, her shirt untucked and her hair skewed to one side.</p><p>“Go,” Granger said in a hot tone, her hands bunched by her sides.</p><p>“You… I’m a Head, too,” Michael said with a slight laugh.</p><p>“Get out!” Granger shouted, so loud that the shelves shook. She was magical enough to cause things to shift or shake by sheer volume, which explained the thick thud in Draco’s chest. The worse thud, lower, because he had some awful masochistic streak when she yelled and he didn’t have enough time in this world to pick that apart.</p><p>Michael and his study partner bolted at the sound of her. They were long gone. But Granger remained, her hands bunched at her sides and her shoulders so tense they might pop her own head off.</p><p>Draco waited for her to yell, or to storm off, or for something. But she remained fixed to the spot as if she’d become part of the Library itself. He watched her with cautious attention. He could leave, as she might have meant for him to leave alongside them. But… Call it ridiculous, but he didn’t much care to leave her alone in the middle of the Library. He’d been afraid of death once upon a time, afraid to die, but right now he welcomed it.</p><p>“Do people really care about anything else.”</p><p>“What’s the question?”</p><p>Granger turned as if she’d not expected him to be there.</p><p>Draco raised a brow at her, his wand held aside.</p><p>“Sex.”</p><p>Draco kept still and silent as if he might die otherwise.</p><p>“It’s always… Everything’s always about sex, sneaking off to have it, meeting up to have it, it’s like that’s all anyone ever seems to care about. Never mind the fact we have exams, and — and a world to rebuild, and there’s so much injustice in the Minstry — ”</p><p>“You can care about all that and have sex.”</p><p>Granger stared at him as if he’d just appeared; as if she’d not seen him until that moment.</p><p>Draco really wanted to be back in his dorm right now. He should have followed Michael and that girl, maybe he could have used their presence as an excuse to sneak away. But he was here with Hermione Granger, stuck in a conversation about how the world was too invested in sex. Which felt ridiculous to even say, given — </p><p>Given he’d not even had it since his Fifth year, and that had been one of a small handful of times. It wasn’t as if he were an expert on the subject.</p><p>“Have you done it? Had sex?”</p><p>“Obviously,” Draco said as if she’d burned him with a cigarette. “Who hasn’t.”</p><p>Oh, no shit.</p><p>She hasn’t.</p><p>Granger gave a tart smile before she shoved past Draco, her elbows squared and her feet too high as she marched away.</p><p>By the time Draco caught up with her, they were back in their dorms. She had vanished down the girls’ corridor and he was left to his side, quite sure he’d lost his mind somewhere between the start of that patrol and the end of it. Because as he threw himself into bed, all he can picture is Granger. Again. As if the last time wasn’t terrible enough. But this time it was a coy, shy Granger, her face turned up to him in the dark, about how she’d never had sex before, about how she wanted to, just once, with him, harder, please, she could take it — </p><p>Draco came with a hiss because he’s angry about it. He’s legitimately angry with her, with her stupid bushy head and her big brown eyes like a mutt, that stupid Granger.</p><p>He could strangle her.</p><p>…</p><p>Granger had tricked him twice. It couldn’t be a coincidence.</p><p>But she made him chase her.</p><p>Draco didn’t chase people.</p><p>Draco got what he wanted and those he wanted felt lucky. That was how it had worked until it didn’t — his name was an affliction now, not an advantage. He hadn’t enjoyed much of anything for so long. His Eighth year was a focused study and feigned normalcy. He’d have to hit the ground running once he was out of school to become a politician or something of note, as per his father’s plans.</p><p>His time was dedicated to the future, to change.</p><p>So to have Granger play the holier-than-thou card, as if she never thought about sex, it annoyed him. And he’d gotten off to the thought of her seven times at this point, and he felt dirty for it each and every time. </p><p>Granger was the only one who said ‘happy birthday’ to him, aside from the few Slytherins he spoke to.</p><p>He added that to his list of reasons to strangle her.</p><p>He’d started calling her “Hermione” at some point after that, though he isn’t sure why.</p><p>Because it’s Hermione Granger, the plain pain of a Gryffindor. The Mudblood, Hermione Granger.</p><p>Never just ‘Hermione’.</p><p>But that stopped mattering somewhere, somehow, and he’s mad about that too.</p><p>And Hermione was mad, too. He noticed it with how she avoided Michael. She avoided everyone, in truth. Exams made that easier as she was the first to sit down and the first to leave. He’d only see her at meals or in passing in their dorms. By the night before their last…</p><p>He couldn’t be in the dorms. They were empty, and even with his private room, he felt that emptiness. He’d declined the invitation to Hogsmeade as the Eighth years were off to get drunk at the Leaky Cauldron. He couldn’t be there, or in the dorms alone.</p><p>It felt wrong.</p><p>And so he set off into the school. Because tomorrow he’d be on the train back home. He’d never have to come back to Hogwarts. He’d be free. For as long as he’d dreamed of that freedom, it didn’t feel as secure as it once had. It felt more like he was about to be drowned. He had an estate to manage, a job to secure, social engagements… He was expected to remedy his family’s image issues, he was expected to plan a future for the Malfoys, he was expected to fix everything his father had done.</p><p>Whether by cruel fate or that masochistic streak, he wound up at the Library.</p><p>Even if Granger found him, what could she do?</p><p>Give him detention?</p><p>Draco let out a low scoff. A small part of him hoped she’d find him, just for the satisfaction of that moment. He’d laugh in her face or hex her for his own amusement. Or he’d mock her for that pesky virginity of hers, about how everyone had gotten laid except for her, because — well, he needed to mock her for something and she’d flashed that like an exposed throat. She wanted to be mocked for it, given how defensive she’d gotten.</p><p>And to his utter non-surprise, he found her. She was in the Muggle Studies section where they kept the picture books about planes and dentists. He smirked in the low light, as the moon had dipped low enough to cast a light across them. She had her knees bent and her head bent lower, as if she were reading. And maybe she was, or she was half asleep. Or, sobbing.</p><p>Why did it have to be the latter.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>Hermione jumped, out of fear rather than shame. She swiped at her face and tossed aside her book on teeth.</p><p>“Everyone’s out celebrating the end of exams.”</p><p>“So why are you here?” Hermione asked with a croak.</p><p>Draco blinked at her as she’d stolen his question. The other Eighth years had gone out to Hogsmeade to get drunk and celebrate.</p><p>Hermione shoved herself to her feet, her arms folded and her chin raised at him.</p><p>“I wanted to be alone.” Not that she deserved an answer.</p><p>Hermione simmered, as if in anticipation of his mockery. And he had every reason to mock her, alone in a picture book section of the Library, crying. The virginal outcast, the savior of the Wizarding world who was overlooked while everyone jerked off Potter and Weasley. They were Aurors, as Draco had read. They were out there, fighting, surviving, all that Ministry propaganda.</p><p>“And you?” He squinted at her as he took a step closer to her as if she might dissipate. “Why’re you sobbing in the Library at three o’clock in the morning?”</p><p>“I’m going to miss it,” she said with no shame. “The books, the — “ her voice broke as she bunched her hands by her face.</p><p>Draco stared at her, terrified. This wasn’t his place. She shouldn’t be upset, least of all around him. He should’ve mocked her for her sobby little mess of a face and left. He should’ve hexed her and left.</p><p>He should have left, period.</p><p>“Sorry,” Hermione said with a thin smile. “I’m not going to report you, you…. You can go, or, do whatever it is you were about to do.”</p><p>“That’s very generous of you,” Draco said with thin malice in his voice.</p><p>Hermione let out a gentle laugh, her arms spread wide as she gestured to the Library. “I shouldn’t be here, neither should you. So long as neither of us admits the other was here — ”</p><p>“Are you suggesting a truce.”</p><p>Hermione’s hands flexed outward, her fingers to her palms, gentle arcs formed as she considered him. Her gaze lingered through the dark, a shadow cast by the mass of her hair around her face. It wasn’t braided back, it was unruly around her face. “Only took us eight years.”</p><p>“Who says I agreed.”</p><p>Hermione frowned.</p><p>“Why did you do it?” Draco said, no hesitation. “You said you got off in the Library; why, you of all people.”</p><p>Even through the dark, Draco could see her blush. She turned her face away a fraction, her brows furrowed. “I — I lied.”</p><p>“Sure,” Draco said with a dismissive snort.</p><p>“I hadn’t done anything, not really, and everyone else was almost out. I — ” Hermione locked eyes with him in the dark, her lips pouted outward. “I just wanted to play along, it’s not as if anyone would remember anyway. They were all drunk…”</p><p>Draco considered her, sharp silver pried through her soft brown eyes. It took no effort to pick through her surface thoughts to catch the truth. He’d learned from the best and had the benefit of natural Occlumency and Legilimency running in his family, though he’d trained in both.</p><p>All to work out if Hermione Granger had fingered herself in the Library.</p><p>(His aunt wouldn’t be proud.)</p><p>“You lied,” Draco said, so sarcastically scandalized he came full circle back to true upset. He pressed a hand to his chest, his mouth popped open at her.</p><p>“So?’ Hermione swelled with undeserved anger. She had been the one to lie, after all.</p><p>Draco tongued the inside of his mouth, his own anger burst like a blood vessel in his temple. He’d jerked off to a lie, and he felt cheated. He couldn’t even pinpoint the feeling she’d slammed into his chest that night or how she’d toyed with the very machinations of his mind. He’d never wanted to fuck her before, never even considered it. Not unless you counted that night at the Yule Ball or one Potions class where she’d taken off her robes — </p><p>No, he’d been lied to, and he had every right to be mad.</p><p>Draco frowned through the dark as Hermione’s breath evened out. She’d not been that deep into her misery when he’d arrived, but the book about teeth remained a few paces away, splayed. She picked it up with a snap to her posture. She ran her fingers over the paper to remove the creases. She didn’t meet his eye, not as she pushed out the marks she’d caused.</p><p>“You’ve thought about it though, haven’t you.”</p><p>Hermione’s hand stilled, her eyes narrowed through the dark.</p><p>“Strange thing to just make up on the spot to fit in,” Draco said with a dip in his gaze. He looked over her, once, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>Hermione dipped her head but he caught it; a smile.</p><p>Draco glared at her through the dark.</p><p>“It’s late.”</p><p>“Wait,” Draco cut her off, his hands raised. “That night when you caught Michael and whoever that poor girl was — were you jealous?”</p><p>“Of Michael?” Hermione said in a bored voice as if he’d asked her what time it was.</p><p>“Of them, fucking in the Library.”</p><p>Hermione reared the book as if she might throw it at him.</p><p>Draco’s face lit up, that flame of mockery rich beneath his tongue. He tasted blood now, in how she ducked her face away to tuck the book into it’s home as if it needed to be done. She could have set it down anywhere and he’d have flown back in time. She’d turned because she’s a fucking swot and she wanted to get fucked in the Library and he’s — Draco doesn’t know how to feel.</p><p>His birthday was earlier in the month yet he was sure it’d come now.</p><p>“We should go to bed.”</p><p>“No, no,” Draco waved a hand through the air. “I should have guessed, you of all people…” He smiled at her as if he’d cracked the case.</p><p>“I’m not jealous.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t blame you. I always wanted to shag someone in the Library,” Draco said before he’d caught it, and he flipped the dream into a nightmare. His jaw froze around his thought as his gaze rolled down to her, this bright ball of red and brown cast in the Library shadows.</p><p>She looked unconvinced.</p><p>“I suppose that’s too far for you though. Too much rule-breaking,” Draco drawled with a wave of his hand.</p><p>“Too much of you,” Hermione said with a scoff.</p><p>Draco masked the gut reaction to wince. “I mean… Objectively…”</p><p>“You can’t just say ‘<em>objectively</em>’ as if that makes the point for you,” Hermione said with thin exasperation.</p><p>Draco stared at her, his jaw rolled sideways as he watched her through hooded eyes. Because in his panic over exams and the end of school, he’d pictured her bent over a desk, against the shelves, on her knees… He’d turned her over in his mind, he’d picked the angles he’d best want to fuck her from and she hadn’t the faintest idea. Because, objectively, he could hate her and still want to fuck her.</p><p>(Not that he really hated her — he just didn’t very much like her.)</p><p>Hermione flexed her brows, as if to ask what he had to say for himself.</p><p>“Objectively,” Draco repeated, a slow smirk spread across his lips. “There’s ways to avoid looking at one another during.”</p><p>“Oh,” Hermione said with a snort. “Yeah, sure, we’re — you aren’t serious, Draco.”</p><p>Draco leaned against the shelf to his left, his arms crossed. “I’m just stating facts.”</p><p>“As if you’d want to.”</p><p>Draco shrugged.</p><p>Hermione stared at him as if he’d lost his mind, and in truth, he probably had. Somewhere between her confession about the Library, the patrol, the birthday wishes… Hermione was this strange, warm thing that he wanted to try just once, just to see what it’d be like. He doesn’t want her, not in any permanent way. And he isn’t even sure that he wanted her, as she was. But he noticed her curves that he’d not seen given their time apart. He’d not seen her much their Sixth year and they’d spent the time from then on apart.</p><p>They’d both been afforded the luxury of sleep and good meals at Hogwarts. The latter meant that she’d developed a nice arse. And Draco, for all his blood purity of the past, hadn’t felt fuck all since — shit, Fifth year? Fourth? He’d toddled along, aware that he had a cock and a distant interest in the opposite sex, but he hadn’t ever really thought about someone in such specific, yearning terms. Not that he’d confess that part to her, he’d die before he said that.</p><p>But he could stoop low enough for a pity fuck in the Library.</p><p>Oh, a ‘sorry’ fuck, as she didn’t pity him.</p><p>Draco didn’t move as she stepped closer. Not even as she reached out to touch his chest, her thin fingers against his robes. He was thankful that the robes were thick enough to keep her from touching the scar Potter had carved into him as he had no time nor patience for the tragedy of ‘woe is me’ — he’s done that for a year, more, and he wanted less than that. He wanted her, at least a little, at least once.</p><p>But he remained still because he wouldn’t be culpable.</p><p>He refused.</p><p>“I appreciate the thought,” Hermione said in a small voice as if she might scare him if she spoke louder. “But I don’t need your pity.”</p><p>“What if I just feel very sorry for you?”</p><p>“Well, that’s different,” Hermione slid a hand upward. It toyed with his tie as if it were the wrong color. As if she could change it with the brush of her fingers. Her gaze lingered there, somewhere beneath his jaw and by his throat. He swallowed hard, enough to make her gaze bob. And she leaned up to press a kiss to his pulse point, though she rushed back with fear in her eyes.</p><p>But it was too late for that.</p><p>“Sorry,” she mumbled. “I’m — sorry.”</p><p>Draco raised a brow at her, the thin white strip of his teeth flashed before he snatched her up. He kissed her because he was already in this, in this stupid decision, because even if all it turned into was a kiss, he’d be able to say he kissed Hermione Granger in the Library.</p><p>(Not that he’d tell anyone.)</p><p>The worst part was that she kissed him back. She encouraged him with the twist of her fingers into his hair and the eager moan into his mouth. He should have known. The girl was a people pleaser by default. She twisted closer to him, lost to the gesture and all he can think is how the fuck they ended up here. He’d avoided her all of their Eighth year, he’d not thought about her much at all, and now he was tongue deep in her.</p><p>Because he’d deepened it, enough to loosen the moans from the back of her throat. He grinned into the kiss, his knee pressed between her thighs and she screamed into the space between their lips. He snickered, cruel and thin, his teeth nipped at her lip. Because she was fun to tease, fun to mock, and now she’d offered herself up on a silver plate. His hands formed along her ribs, her hips, enough to shove her against the shelves. They didn’t rattle given they were old shelves, ones that were built into the foundations. If they were against a returns shelf, it’d be a mess.</p><p>But this shelf is sturdy enough to handle how he rocked his thigh against her, the surprise wide eyes matched by the shock-popped mouth.</p><p>“You okay, Granger?” Draco asked with the same nastiness he always had because to be nice would feel too much like caring.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Hermione said with a snippy tone. She spoke between gentle moans, so that snippiness was a lie.</p><p>Draco furrowed his lips into a dismissive look as he drew back, to meet her eye.</p><p>“What?” She frowned.</p><p>“I’m just — Merlin Granger,” Draco gritted his teeth. “I was making sure you were actually fine.”</p><p>“Why do you care?”</p><p>Draco withdrew with mild amusement, as she made the most lascivious sound of disappointment. “I’d rather fuck you if you’re willing, as if that’s some grand surprise.”</p><p>“You want to — ”</p><p>“Don’t,” Draco snapped a hand over her mouth, his eyes narrowed down at her. “Don’t act as if that’s a surprise.”</p><p>Hermione glared up at him over the curve of his palm.</p><p>“I’ve always wanted to fuck someone in the Library, you’ve always wanted to get fucked in the Library — ”</p><p>“Please stop saying it like that — ” Hermione whined as she yanked his hand away.</p><p>“So that’s all it has to be.”</p><p>Hermione leaned against the shelves, her robes splayed as much as her legs. She fidgeted with her hands as if she were about to make a deal with the Devil.</p><p>“Neither of us tells anyone; we never mention it again.”</p><p>“Never?” Hermione repeated, her eyes fixed on her hands.</p><p>Draco caught her jawline with the width of his palm, to meet her eye. “As if either of us would want to admit to it.”</p><p>Hermione searched his eyes for longer than he liked, but he allowed it. If only because his cock was throbbing against his thigh and they didn’t have much time to make the choice. But his question was answered as she reached out to cup him through his slacks, a shy smile on her face.</p><p>“We probably don’t have too long,” Hermione said before she pulled him close.</p><p>He wasn’t quite sure who picked up the pace, but his belt had been yanked open and his slacks had inched down around his thighs. He kept his attention on her, on the soft warmth of her mouth and the thin loop of her arm around his neck. He can taste that desperation, the sort that made him think of death in the usual way. He wanted nothing more than to exist in the moment, to bury himself inside her and scratch the itch she’d cursed him with.</p><p>But he wasn’t sure how she’d handle such a shift.</p><p>Instead his wormed his hand between them, to drag skirt up enough to cup her through her underwear. She was wet all along her thighs and worse against her cunt. His fingers searched for what his cock had yet to reach, that firm warmth that shattered what shallow joy her mouth provided. Tongues thrashing didn’t rival the satisfaction of her underwear, tugged to the side. Worse, how hot she felt around his fingers as he teased her, against her folds, the soft edges than the tight, tight center of her.</p><p>It’s all so wet and warm and he’d want nothing more than to bury himself but —</p><p>He smirked as he drew back, enough to catch her closed eyes and open mouth. She had buried her face into his throat as he toyed with her clit and throw her head back when his finger sank inside. He’d had his hand worked into her hair to save her skull, for which he received no thanks. He kissed her again to capture the moans because they were his after all. He had caused them and so they were all owed to him, every single one. He coaxed each one from her, one finger thrusting into her until he was sure he needed two.</p><p>Because, despite all his cruelty and his malice, he didn’t want to hurt her. He refused to watch her ache and cry and plead, he refused to be that sort of evil. He kept his left forearm away from her as if that made up for the Dark Mark, but it never would.</p><p>He withdrew his hand with a slick sound of skin to grab her hip. He spun her so she was faced against the bookshelves and — she could be anyone this way.</p><p>And he could be someone more to her tastes.</p><p>Corner, or Weasley.</p><p>Anyone else.</p><p>She hadn’t looked at him since he’d pushed his fingers into her and — that’s fine. It was what he’d offered. He didn’t give a fuck. He just wanted to have the perverted privilege of being the one to fuck Hermione Granger in the Library.</p><p>(Not that he’d tell anyone.)</p><p>“Please,” she said with a gentle exhale. “Gentle.”</p><p>Draco felt his heart shatter. He almost stopped but she grabbed his hips to pull him close and he’d been made aware of his erection. He’d disassociated from sexual desire a long time ago, just one of those fun trauma things. But he’d regained it in the stress of exams, and now all he wanted…</p><p>Merlin, he didn’t deserve this.</p><p>And yet he felt her hand grasp him, to help because she wanted this. Not him, of course, she wouldn’t look at him, but she wanted this. And he wanted to fuck her, as he’d said a dozen times, and he didn’t care. He didn’t care about her, most of all, he cared about himself. But he’d give her gentle for as long as he could manage. He couldn’t do anything else.</p><p>With a little shift in the posture of his hips and hands, he was inside her. Not all at once, just a little, then she shifted, and inhaled, then shifted further.</p><p>Draco touched her neck then her cheek, gentle, then he grabbed her shoulder.</p><p>And then he was inside her and he really didn’t care, he really didn’t — </p><p>But Hermione kept her eyes shut tight. He should've done the same. He’s stupid. He suggested this, he’s the one who said they didn’t have to make it about one another. And yet he watched her as she took him in with all the same curiosity she had in classes, this angry befuddlement that cracked like an egg once she understood. That was her problem. She was so expressive. He could see where the head of his cock caught against the ridges of her cunt, where it’d be best to strike.</p><p>She made it too easy.</p><p>She’s so stupid like that. So easy to read. He’d pity her if he wasn’t so eager to make her open her eyes, to realize it was him who’d given her this gift.</p><p>Because yes, he’s a gift, absolutely fuck anyone who said otherwise.</p><p>The grip on her shoulder remained while he took her hip into his other hand. She gripped the bookshelf and his hand, the one on her hip, and he isn’t sure how they ended up here. Or how he’d ended up fucking Hermione Granger, the swottiest of swots, in the Library. And yet here he was, cock deep and his toes curled. He gritted his teeth and lost any sense of ‘gentle’ and she didn’t seem to mind. He’d taken it slow, he’d given her all that he could. And his hand, the one on her hip, slipped.</p><p>He pressed inward against her, his hips still aggressive as he marked her inside out, that she’d always be his in this way. Draco cared deeply for that which was his.</p><p>And she was his right now, as he toyed with her clit to listen to those tiny moans. The ones she caught between her lips, her eyes strained shut.</p><p>He took the hand away from her shoulder to ruck her shirt up enough to tease her through her bra.</p><p>He did every little thing he could think of. Every stupid trick he’d heard other boys mention.</p><p>“You’re so tight Granger,” he said against the shell of her ear, a laugh at the edges of his voice. “Wish I’d done this a long time ago.”</p><p>“Oh shut up,” she managed, in spite of the sopping wet mess that was pressed against his pelvis. “As if I’d have let you,” she tensed against him.</p><p>“You let me now,” Draco said, at least more in control of the pace and ergo, his voice.</p><p>“Because I was desperate,” she said with a laugh, bright and wonderful despite the cruelty.</p><p>The bitch.</p><p>Draco tongued his lips apart. He wanted to have some pithy thing to say back but he didn’t. All he had was the pace. And so he dropped the hand from her tit to settle onto her shoulder. He gripped it, firm but gentle. He’d made considerations for her, so as to not appear like a total cunt, but she’d not extended the same favor in kind. And so he withdrew from her altogether, his hand on her hip and her shoulder used to flip her.</p><p>Hermione stared at him, which she’d not done once since he’d first been inside her.</p><p>Draco smirked down at her as he picked her up by her arse, no hesitation as he picked her up. Her fingers scrabbled with the shelves behind her, her elbows outward like right angles. He poised himself against her, but not quite. The weight of her arse against his pelvis allowed him enough freedom to toy with her clit, which he thumbed with idle interest.</p><p>“You are desperate, aren’t you.”</p><p>Hermione glared at him, a deep red to her cheeks.</p><p>Draco raised a brow at her, his thumb doubled in pressure and pace. She responded against her personal resistance; not that she’d seem upset with him, more brattish. And he’d never really toyed with his food before he’d eaten it. He’d never given much of a fuck about whoever he was with, but if he’d only have her once, he wanted her to remember him.</p><p>“Draco,” Hermione said with a sharp ache in her tone.</p><p>“Hermione,” Draco responded, his thumb stilled.</p><p>“I — don’t… Don’t stop,” she said with such a deep scowl the lines might be permanent.</p><p>Draco rolled his hips forward, pleased to see the way her eyes rolled and closed all at once. And for all his plans, for all the horrible things he wanted to do to her, they didn’t have all night. His gaze flicked between her shirt that had rolled up, the bunched skirt, the occasional flicker of skin between her skirt and his stomach. But no matter how much he wanted to, he’d never get enough of this moment, he’d never get to catch every little sigh and moan and tense.</p><p>Instead, he watched her, her eyes closed and her mouth open as the heat welled in his stomach.</p><p>But — </p><p>She came, which shocked him so deeply that he lost that apprehension only a moment later. The ripples of her cunt, the tightening, the way she scrabbled her fingers, the wide mouth and strained neck, the way she arched closer… The rock of the books, the freeze-frame of her undone against him, the tension lost, the moment gone, that debased curiosity satiated. He had watched Hermione Granger come because of him; he’d come inside Hermione Granger.</p><p>The moment warmed as he watched her, cautious as if to make sure she was okay.</p><p>And she was; of course she was. She smiled like a pleased cat and wriggled so as to be free of him.</p><p>And Draco shoved himself back into his pants before she had even fixed her skirt.</p><p>And he —</p><p>He left.</p><p>He shouldn’t have.</p><p>But he had to.</p><p>Draco skipped breakfast that morning. He remained in his room. He attended the final ceremony out of obligation. Granger stood by Corner, pleased. She gave a speech about house unity and Pansy made a joke about it, something sexual, and Draco laughed. And then he watched Granger rush over to the girl Weasley and giggle and part of him wondered if she’d told Weasley. Or anyone. Or if it had even happened.</p><p>She didn’t speak to him, or look at him.</p><p>For the best.</p><p>They had agreed that it would be a moment; a single time. And he hadn't taken his time. He hadn't given her enough, he hadn't done enough. But there was no sense in it, no real place for them. He didn't care about her and she didn't care about him.</p><p>They had fucked in the Library in some <em>la petite mort</em>. He had to focus on his future, he had to secure his family's future. Granger had every pleasantry to focus on, all the accolades and whatever job she settled on.</p><p>There was no happy ending here.</p><p>It was sex. Just sex.</p><p>He repeated that over and over. His compartment was packed with Slytherins, half of which he didn't recognize. He hadn't seen any other Eighth years and he felt even emptier as they trundled into the summer evening.</p><p>He wouldn't miss Hogwarts or anyone therein.</p><p>But he might miss Granger.</p><p>He shouldn't have left.</p><p>But he had to leave.</p><p>He couldn't handle the conversation. She'd have made him promise to keep it quiet. Or she'd look at him with regret-stained cheeks, a blush around her edges because that hadn't been the first time she'd wanted for herself. He hadn't done enough.</p><p>By the time the Hogwarts Express pulled into Kings’ Cross station, Draco had convinced himself it was a strange dream he’d had, brought on by the stress of his exams.</p><p>“Hermione!”</p><p>Draco felt his skin turn to ice as he stood by his mother, who was in talks with Pansy’s mother.</p><p>Draco stared at the ground as he listened to Potter and Weasley bustle over to her. The foley of the crowd killed the conversation. He fidgeted with his family ring, as he dragged his thumbnail over the ‘M’, over and over.</p><p>A hand caught his elbow. He looked towards it, as he expected his mother.</p><p>But it was Granger.</p><p>“Owl me about your results, okay?” Granger said with a glare. “I want to know if you beat me.”</p><p>And she rushed off to link arms with Ron, that stupid tall git. And he kissed her, gently, a blush on her cheeks.</p><p>And Draco watched her go.</p><p>And he did owl her.</p><p>(Not that he'd tell anyone.)</p>
