          <div class="userstuff"><p>Remus Lupin was having a great day.<br/>
Which isn’t something he can say often about the day after the full moon. But here he was, laying on a picnic blanket in the beautiful spring sun. No one was talking, but it was perfect. James and Peter were on the other blanket a few feet away, snoring up a storm.<br/>
But Remus didn’t care. All he cared about was the boy next to him. He looked over into Sirius eyes, who met his, smiled, and looked back to the spring sun. </p><p>Sirius. Lovely, funny, sweet Sirius. The boy smiled. Remus knew he was in love with Sirius, but he didn’t need to worry about that now. Because here he was, the afternoon after the full moon, covered in new scratches that would definitely scar,and he was completely at peace. </p><p>Sirius was so happy. Well Remus was happy, and that was pretty much the same thing. Sirius wanted nothing more than for Remus to be happy. And he was. Everything was perfect.<br/>
For a while anyway.<br/>
“Well, well, well,” Snape walked up to the group, “if it isn’t the Marauders?”<br/>
“What do you want Severus,” James sighed, now awake. The four boys sat up, the perfect afternoon over.<br/>
“Nothing, just wanted to check up Remus,” Severus looked him up and down.<br/>
“A little roughed up aren’t you? Your boyfriend give those to you?” He asked, gesturing at Sirius.<br/>
“Excuse me?” Sirius stood up.<br/>
“What? Mad that I called you a homo?” Severus smirked<br/>
“Hey-“ James stood up. Sirius tore his eyes from the asshole in front of him.<br/>
“James, I got this,” Sirius assures. James reluctantly sat back down.<br/>
“No, actually.” Sirius said, finally answering Severus’s question.<br/>
“Anyone would be lucky to date Remus! But the fact that you said I would hurt him.” Sirius finished, hissing the last words.<br/>
“No, I know what really happened,” Severus turned his attention to Remus, who was still sitting on the picnic blanket, “you should just kill yourself, honestly? It’d make things easier for everyone.”</p><p>Sirius charged at Severus.</p><p>“I’LL KILL YOU! I’LL FUCKING KILL YOU!” Sirius was so focused on hurting Severus that he barely notice Remus holding him back.<br/>
“HOW DARE YOU! ILL FUCKING MURDER YOU!” Sirius thrashed against Remus, trying to escape.<br/>
“LET GO OF ME!” He shifted his attention back to the boy running away from him, “YOURE SO LUCKY HE’S HOLDING ME BACK! I’D FUCKING KILL YOU! I’LL KILL YOU FOR WHAT YOU SAID!”</p><p>After a few minutes, the three boys were able to get Sirius to calm down. They sat him against the tree and crouched around him, trying to shush him. He was still muttering threats and pointing in the direction Severus ran.<br/>
Remus put his hand on Sirius arm.<br/>
“Hey,” Remus whispered, which was enough to tear Sirius from his trance. </p><p>“Don’t listen to him. He’s a liar. A fucking douchebag. I’ll kill him.” Sirius started again.<br/>
“Sirius!” Remus snapped, “I’m okay!”<br/>
Sirius looked up at him with those beautiful eyes, and Remus almost sighed.<br/>
“Are you sure?” Sirius sounded like he was in pain. And in a way, he was.<br/>
“Positive!” Remus assures.</p><p>James and Peter glanced at each other.<br/>
“Hey Moony,” James whispered, Remus turned to face him, his hand still on Sirius’s arm, “if you’ve got this, Peter and I are going to head to dinner,”<br/>
“That’s fine,” Remus smiles, and the two boys got up and walked away.<br/>
James hates leaving Sirius at a time when he was so vulnerable, but he knew he needed to be alone with Remus right now. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Sirius said, once Peter and James were out of earshot.<br/>
“Pads, what on earth do you have to be sorry about?!”<br/>
“Not me. He shouldn’t have said those things about you!”<br/>
“You think I care what Severus Snape thinks about me?! You must really be thick!” Remus joked. He expected at least a weak laugh, but Sirius just sighed. He stood up, and held his hand out for Moony. Remus took it and stood to meet his friend.<br/>
“Are you sure you’re okay?” Sirius whispered sadly.<br/>
“Absolutely, after all, I’ve got you to protect me” Remus half jokes.<br/>
“You do have me,” Sirius smiles. Remus’s heart soars at his words, even if he knew that isn’t what Sirius meant.</p><p>But it was what Sirius meant. Not that Remus would know that. At least, not for a little while.</p><p>———————————————————</p><p>“Don’t you think we should tell them?” Peter asked. Peter and James knew their friends were in love with each other, it was so glaringly obvious.<br/>
“No, they’ll figure it out,” James started, “....eventually.”</p></div>
