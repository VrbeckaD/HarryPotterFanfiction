    <p class="western" align="LEFT">The caste is a secondary gender you are born with as a magical child. There are 3 organizations AMS, BCS and the OSS that care for magical people depending on what their caste is. Not all of them have their own hospital but what services they do offer varies from country to country. Often BCS is attached to the main area hospital. With AMS and the OSS both being small clinics. But it can vary due to the need in that area.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Two examples of this are England and Greenland. In England, the BCS is attached to Saint Mungo's. The service itself acts more like a counselling group and monitors people who might need help. They also run small clinics for magical creatures that the Ministry will not let be treated at Saint Mungo's like Werewolves. The OSS and AMS both have small clinics to treat their people only. The OSS has theirs in a block of Terrace houses they have knocked together, spelled and taken over. The AMS, by contrast, has a large field with several purpose-built buildings.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Greenland, on the other hand, is one large hospital with small wings dedicated to the different organizations. These allow the people who need to stop over to do so but still be safe and can be closed off or guarded as needed. This is due to Greenland being smaller than England.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">AMS stands for Alpha Monitoring Service.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">BCS stands for Beta Counselling Service.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">OSS stands for Omega Support Service.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Each one obviously takes a specific caste. How much you are affected by your caste depends on your designation. An alpha could be a sadist, dominant or Alpha. An Omega could be a Masochist, Omega or Submissive. A Beta could be a Sadist, Dominant, Beta, Submissive or Masochist. They have the whole spectrum.<br/>
<br/>
The spell<br/>
<br/>
A spell decides which caste you are. This spell is embedded with a complex arithmetic equation. This scans you to see which secondary gender you are. Just because you are a male does not mean you are going to be under the AMS or BCS. You could be a rare submissive male.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">To know which caste you fall under the spell is cast. Someone qualified will cast it on you and you will glow the colour of that caste. AMS will glow red, BCS will glow yellow and the OSS will glow orange. The Organization will when do a further test to decide which designation you are. This test is much less secure and is done on paper as your designation is decided by your personality and as such can be faked. The OSS is currently trying to create a spell to determine this as well.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Not many remember the spell being cast on them as it is done so when the child is 2 years old. However, particularly in England, there are those that prefer their children to one particular caste. They will bribe the ministry official to record the child wrong. They do not want to believe that they have given birth to a child that is not that particular caste. This is dangerous, illegal and can affect the child's health. However, sometimes it is other people who record a child wrong for various reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Gifts<br/>
<br/>
All children also have gifts that can affect a person though it does not go towards deciding which caste or organization a person is.<br/>
These gifts are:<br/>
Beast Speakers<br/>
Parseltongue<br/>
Shadow Walking<br/>
Teleportation<br/>
Telekinesis<br/>
Natural Animagus<br/>
Metamorph<br/>
Elemental Magic<br/>
Invisibility<br/>
The ability to make yourself Transparent<br/>
Being Sensitive to magic<br/>
Seeing Magic<br/>
Seer<br/>
Empathy<br/>
Telepathy.<br/>
<br/>
How do the gifts affect someone?<br/>
<br/>
Some of these gifts affect a persons ability to be treated by magic when they are sick. There are ways to minimise this such as the person going through regular purification baths or showers. However as much as possible, it would still be better to save the strong concentrations of magic to treatment. Rather than to find out what is wrong with them in the first place. Simerly the OSS has done a study and discovered that using magic on an Omega while they are pregnant can cause harm to the child. Increasing their chances of being born a Squib.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Not all gifts affect someone in this way. However being a sensitive, seer or having the ability to see magic do. All people with these gifts need to be treated in a non-magical manner. As such they are often found in Omegas but that is not always the case. The AMS can treat people non-magical but they prefer not to. The BCS has minimum facilities to do this and there are rare cases of them referring a Beta to the OSS to be under their care due to their magical gift.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">The next five gifts are affected on a smaller scale. Empathy, Telepathy, Elemental, Metamorph and Natural Animagus. Empathy and Telepathy are simply due to needing strong training. It is impossible to turn off the gift of empathy completely and they will always feel some people peoples emotions. Telepathy if not trained properly can drive a person mad or cause them to share dreams with other people. Metamorphs and Natural Animagi are most often fine with large quantities of magic. However, this is only as long as they are in their natural form when being healed. Elementals have been known to lose control in highly distressing situations. As such all major hospitals have elemental suppressing wards over them for this reason.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">The next lot is Invisibility, Telekinesis, Transparent, Teleportation and Shadow Walk. This is the biggest group. Non are really affected by healing magic. The gifts of Transparent and Invisibility are often seen together and can occasionally cause magical health problems. Teleportation and Shadow Walking are methods of transport outside of Apperation. Shadow walking is most often seen in Vampires and is rare in a human. Telekinesis is another that once you have control does not affect your ability to be treated with magic.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">The last group of gifts is Beast Speaker and Parseltongue both of which are languages. Therefore they are not affected at all in any way.<br/>
<br/>
Births<br/>
<br/>
How magic decides who is born an Alpha, Beta or Omega is complex and been studied closely over the years. To the point that magical know which castes have the highest chance of producing certain types of children. Certain types of secondary genders will not be able to have children together.<br/>
The combinations that can have children together are:<br/>
Alpha Male with a Beta Female<br/>
Alpha Male with an Omega Male<br/>
Alpha Male with an Omega Female<br/>
Alpha Female with a Beta Female<br/>
Alpha Female with an Omega Male<br/>
Alpha Female with an Omega Female<br/>
Beta Male with a Beta Female<br/>
Beta Male with an Omega Male<br/>
Beta Male with an Omega Female<br/>
Beta Female with a Beta Male<br/>
Beta Female with an Omega Male<br/>
Beta Female with an Omega Female.<br/>
<br/>
The combinations that can not have children together are:<br/>
Alpha Male with an Alpha Female<br/>
Alpha Male with a Beta Male<br/>
Alpha Female with Beta Male<br/>
Omega Male with an Omega Female<br/>
<br/>
The Statistics of having which type of children are:<br/>
<br/>
An Alpha Male with a Beta female will have a 25% chance of having an Alpha Male. 15% chance of having an Alpha female. 25% chance of having a Beta male. 25% chance of having a Beta female. 5% chance of having an Omega Male and 5% chance of having an Omega female.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">An Alpha male with an Omega female will have a 25% chance of having an Alpha male. 15% chance of having an Alpha female. 15% chance of having a Beta Male. 15% chance of having a Beta female. 10% chance of having an Omega male and 20% chance of having an Omega female.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">An Alpha male with an Omega male will have a 25% chance of having an Alpha male. 15% chance of having an Alpha female. 15% chance of having a Beta Male. 15% chance of having a Beta female. 10% chance of having an Omega male and 20% chance of having an Omega female.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">An Alpha female with a beta female will have a 25% chance of having an Alpha Male.15% chance of having an Alpha female. 25% chance of having a Beta male. 25% chance of having a Beta female. 5% chance of having an Omega Male and 5% chance of having an Omega female.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">An Alpha female with an Omega female will have a 25% chance of having an Alpha male. 15% chance of having an Alpha female. 15% chance of having a Beta Male. 15% chance of having a Beta female. 10% chance of having an Omega male and 20% chance of having an Omega female.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">An Alpha female with an Omega male will have a 25% chance of having an Alpha male. 15% chance of having an Alpha female. 15% chance of having a Beta Male. 15% chance of having a Beta female. 10% chance of having an Omega male and 20% chance of having an Omega female.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">A Beta Male with a Beta female will have a 5% chance of having an Alpha male. 5% chance of having an Alpha female. 40% chance of having a Beta male. 40% chance of having a beta female. 5% chance of having an Omega male and 5% chance of having an Omega female.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">A Beta Male with an Omega female will have a 10% chance of having an Alpha male. 5% chance of having an Alpha female. 30% chance of having a Beta male. 30% chance of having a Beta female. 5% chance of having an Omega male and 20% chance of having an Omega female.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">A Beta male with an Omega male will have a 5% chance of having an Alpha male. 5% chance of having an Alpha female. 30% chance of having a Beta male. 30% chance of having a Beta female. 10% chance of having an Omega male. 20% chance of having an Omega female.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">A Beta female with an Omega female will have a 10% chance of having an Alpha male. 5% chance of having an Alpha female. 30% chance of having a Beta male. 30% chance of having a Beta female. 5% chance of having an Omega male and 20% chance of having an Omega female.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">A Beta female with an Omega male will have a 10% chance of having an Alpha male. 5% chance of having an Alpha female. 30% chance of having a Beta male. 30% chance of having a Beta female. 5% chance of having an Omega male and 20% chance of having an Omega female.<br/>
<br/>
In total there is 190% chance of an Alpha male being born. A 115% chance of an Alpha female being born. A 270% chance of a Beta male being born. A 270% chance of a Beta female being born. An 80% chance of an Omega male being born and a 175% chance of an Omega female being born.<br/>
<br/>
For example<br/>
<br/>
If a Beta male and Beta female had 4 kids they would have a 1.6 chance of having a beta male and a beta female. But only a 0.2 chance of having an alpha male, alpha female, Omega male or an Omega female. So they would have 1 beta male, 1 beta female. 1 more of there and then 1 of the other castes.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">However, if they had 6 kids they would have a 2.4 chance of having a beta male and a beta female. But only a 0.3 chance of having an alpha male, alpha female, Omega male or an Omega female. So they would have 2 beta males, 2 beta females, 1 more of either and then 1 of the other castes.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Although if they had 12 kids they would have a 4.8 chance of having a beta male and a beta female. But only a 0.6 chance of having an alpha male, alpha female, Omega male or an Omega female. So they would have 5 beta males, 5 beta females. 1 alpha either male or female and 1 omega either male or female.<br/>
<br/>
If an Alpha Male and Beta female had 4 kids they would have a 1 chance of having an Alpha male, beta male and a beta female. A 0.6 chance of having an alpha female. But only 0.2 chance of having an Omega male or female. So they would have 1 Alpha male, 1 beta male, 1 beta female and 1 Alpha female.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">However, if they had 6 kids they would have a 1.5 chance of having an alpha male, beta male and beta female. A 0.9 chance of an Alpha female. But only a 0.3 chance of having an omega male or female. So they would have 1 Alpha male, 1 beta male, 1 beta female and of extra of any of the 3. They would also have an Alpha female and 1 omega of either male or female.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Although if they had 12 kids they would have a 3 chance of having an Alpha male, Beta male, Beta female. A 1.8 chance of having an alpha female. But only a 0.6 chance of having an omega male or female. So they would have 3 alpha males 3 beta males, 3 beta females, 2 alpha females and 1 omega either male or female.<br/>
<br/>
If an Alpha male and an Omega either male or female had 4 kids they would have a 1 chance of an Alpha male. A 0.6 chance of an alpha female, beta male and beta female. A 0.8 chance of an omega female. But only a 0.4 chance of an omega male. So they would have 1 alpha male. 1 alpha female, 1 beta either male or female and 1 omega female.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">However, if they had 6 kids they would have a 1.5 chance of an alpha male. A 0.89 chance of an alpha male, beta male and beta female. A 1.2 chance of an omega female. But only a 0.6 chance of an omega male. So they would have 1 alpha male, 1 alpha female, 2 betas either male or female, 1 omega female and either an omega male or alpha male.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Although if they had 12 kids they would have a 3 chance of an alpha male. A 1.7 chance of an alpha male, beta male and beta female. A 2.4 chance of an omega female. But only a 1.2 chance of an omega male. So they would have 3 Alpha males, 2 alpha females, beta males, beta females, omega females and 1 omega male.<br/>
<br/>
If you wish to calculate what this would be for any combination go on google and type in percentages. It will bring up 3 ways to do so. Use the one that says find a value with number % of and number. Put the number of children into the second box and then the percentage from my statistics above. This will then calculate the chances. You will need to do all combinations for that pairing to have your chances. If your chance is over a whole number you will definitely have at least 1 or more of that child. If it is lower I went with a higher chance. Have a play with it and see what you come up with.</p>
