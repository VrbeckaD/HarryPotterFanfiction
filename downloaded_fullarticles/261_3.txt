  <em>THUD. </em>
</p><p>Harry woke up, his heart pounding. His hands clutched at the sweat-soaked sheets beneath him as yet another violent sound echoed from downstairs. </p><p>
  <em>SCREEEE— </em>
</p><p>“<em> Fuck it! </em>” Harry growled, his voice raspy from sleepiness as he ripped the sheets off himself. He got out of bed and lit the tip of his wand, stomping through the creaky hallways to see what the <em>hell </em>was going on at four in the morning. Because even though Grimmauld Place was old, it wasn’t quite old enough to justify the sounds that were coming from downsta—</p><p>
  <em>THUD. SCREEE— </em>
</p><p>And there it was again, this time accompanied by the same scratching noise.  </p><p>Frustration turned into something closer to fear. With his heart pounding furiously, Harry quickly made his way to the bottom floor. He clenched his wand tightly in hand as he surveyed the dimly-lit living room, Auror senses on full alert. There was nothing there, and further inspection of the other first floor rooms yielded no suspicious activity as well.</p><p>
  <em> THUD. </em>
</p><p>This time, Harry managed to successfully pin down the source of the commotion. It seemed to be coming from outside the… front door? That was odd. Nothing should have been able to get past the Black wards.  </p><p>"Hello?" he called cautiously through the door after casting a few detection spells. </p><p>Silence met his greeting.</p><p>Harry scoffed under his breath. Of course, now of all times, the mysterious infiltrator decided to stay quiet.</p><p>“Well, good bye then,” he muttered sarcastically, turning back around. “Please don’t come back.”</p><p>He was answered by a loud bark, followed by several short yaps. </p><p>Harry froze, mind racing.</p><p>Maybe Sirius had gotten stuck in dog form again. The last time that happened, Harry had been forced to call his parents over to revert him back. They were in France for Lily's Healer work, and they'd been quite exasperated by the interruption. </p><p>But, <em>wait. </em>Harry paused near the front door, frowning contemplatively. Sirius was vacationing in Romania with Remus. </p><p>So what was a dog here? </p><p>The barking and scratching resumed. Curiosity got the better of Harry, and he hesitantly opened the door… only to be met with the sight of a jaw-droppingly large Doberman. </p><p>Lean muscles rippled below a thick coat of pitch-black fur, drawn taut as though the dog was preparing for attack. The beast’s head reached just below Harry’s chest, his ears upright and giving the illusion of constant alertness — or, as his mentor Auror had once put it, <em>constant vigilance. </em></p><p>But the creature’s most striking feature was its <em>eyes. </em>Abyss-black, deep and eerily knowing. Their intelligent gleam forcibly reminded him of Sirius… but also of <em>someone else. </em> </p><p>Harry couldn’t look away. The dog maintained eye contact with him, opening its jaw ever so slightly. For a split second, he could have sworn the dog was about to <em>speak </em>to him, however foolish the notion was.</p><p>But what came out of the dog’s mouth was an unintelligible stream of growls and yaps, breaking the strange illusion of familiarity. And then then creature’s face pinched into something priceless —  an irritable expression not unlike the one Sirius wore whenever Remus kicked him out for doing something spectacularly stupid.  </p><p>Harry was immediately in love. </p><p>"Why hello there, big boy!" Harry exclaimed happily, all wariness forgotten as he leaned down to engulf the dog in a tight hug. "Where's your owner, sweetie?" </p><p>The dog snarled and snapped at Harry, clearly unimpressed with the manhandling. </p><p>"Sorry about that," Harry apologized hastily, stepping back hastily to give the creature some space. "I don't see anyone nearby, so I'm going to assume you're here on your own. Are you lost?" </p><p>The dog made an angry biting motion again. Its silken jowls were bared in a ferocious snarl, revealing terrifyingly sharp teeth.</p><p>"Right. Dogs can't talk, my bad.” <em>Normal dogs </em>can’t <em>, </em>anyways. Spending time with Padfoot had ruined all standards of normality for him. “Do you mind if I take you inside?" </p><p>Another growl. </p><p>"Sounds good!" Harry said, knowing full well he sounded crazy for talking to a literal dog. "I'm going to bring you inside. It sure gets cold during these summer nights, huh?” He held his hands up in the universal sign of surrender, hoping to appease the guarded creature. “Please don't get mad at me." </p><p>Ten minutes later, he had the dog situated in the living room. His hands were littered with scratches and his pajama pants had been cleanly bitten through at the cuff. But despite getting his hair rumpled and glasses askew from chasing the dog around, he was beaming.</p><p>Harry had spent so many years living alone in Grimmauld Place, perfectly content in his solitude; he hadn’t even realized how decrepit and sad his place was, nor how much he actually craved… <em>company, </em>until it turned up at his door.</p><p>"Merlin! You sure are a feisty one, aren't you?" He said with a fond grin, still slightly out of breath from dodging the dog's bites. </p><p>The dog growled for the thousandth time and promptly bit another hole through Harry's pants. Molly was going to <em>kill </em>Harry for ruining this pair— she had only just redone his wardrobe.</p><p>"Ha!" He chuckled weakly, mildly distracted by the dog's painful hold on his leg. "What a boisterous young boy! I ought to name you Buster or someth— <em>ow </em>!" </p><p>The dog had punctured Harry's shoes with a well-aimed bite. Harry crossly hoped that the dog would taste dirtied rubber for days.</p><p>"Oi! Stop that!" Harry cried indignantly. "Oh, you know what? Keep this up and I'll give you a stupid name. Like Fluffy." </p><p>That earned another ferocious bark. </p><p>"Look here. I'm trying to be nice, okay? It's like you're trying your hardest to piss me off. Merlin, you're worse than Riddle." </p><p>At this, the dog froze in mid-lunge, his eyes comically large. But Harry paid no attention, his mind now completely turning to the bane of his Hogwarts existence.</p><p>“Ah, well, that was rude of me.” Harry’s mouth curled unpleasantly. “You’re certainly far better than him — not that Riddle isn’t perfectly lovely.” He snorted to himself. “Well, once you get past his homicidal tendencies as a schoolboy, that is.”</p><p>Harry sat in silence, stewing over the former Slytherin Head Boy. Even after leaving Hogwarts and becoming a full-fledged Auror, the man remained a sore spot of his.</p><p>“Stupid snake,” Harry muttered.</p><p>The dog, which had been shockingly quiet for the past few moments, began to growl louder than ever. If Harry didn't know better, he'd say that the dog was barking the canine equivalent of cuss words. And as his eyes caught on the black, curling lock upon the dog’s head, inspiration struck. </p><p>"I ought to name you Tom," Harry grumbled. "That'd suit your personality perfectly." </p><p>More barking of the furious, viciously wild strain. Harry raised his eyebrows at it. <em>Such disobedience… </em>he’d have to train <em>that </em>out at some point.</p><p>Because while this dog seemed like the bully type, Harry was no pushover. </p><p>"All right, Tom it is!” Harry declared cheerily, clapping his hands together. “I christen thee Tom Marvolo Riddle, named after the biggest asshole I ever knew,” Harry paused dramatically, for effect. “May you bring honor to his tainted name.”</p><p>Never had Harry seen an animal look so completely, utterly furious. </p><p>~~~~~______~~~~~______~~~~~ </p><p>Tom Riddle was ready to commit murder.  </p><p>Well, that was how he generally felt all the time, but he was currently seething with <em>especially </em>lethal fury at the ignominy and humiliation of his current situation.  </p><p>He'd been minding his own business, pursuing world domination via his Death Eater (DE) circle and plotting the creation of his first Horcrux when <em>Albus Dumbledore happened. </em></p><p>The wizard had materialized directly inside the anti-apparition wards that Carrow had constructed only earlier that week. In retrospect, perhaps entrusting Carrow with such a crucial task hadn't been very wise.</p><p>While Riddle had been somewhat distracted with thinking of a proper punishment for his Death Eater (the <em>Cruciatus </em>or… well, that was about it, really, unless he was looking to cut down his ranks), Dumbledore had begun to cast a myriad of spells. Tom had put up a wandless shield and half-heartedly dodged the first few, preparing draw his wand out and return the favor twice as <em>hard </em>when—</p><p>A flurry of light had broken through his shield and caught on his thigh, blasting him back. It had taken less than a second for the spell to take effect. And by the end of it,Tom found himself neither human nor dead… but something far worse.</p><p>A dog.</p><p>Perhaps Dumbledore was right after all. There were far worse things than death, and this was his former Transfiguration professor’s way of teaching Tom that very lesson.</p><p>Immediately after You Know What, Tom attempted to summon his magic for a wandless reversal spell. But much to his alarm, he couldn't access his magic. </p><p>So not only had he become a dog — he’d lost his magic in the process.</p><p>This realization nearly lost him a tooth. In his rage, Tom resorted to ripping up pillows with his teeth until his murderous craze had simmered to a cold, calculated sort of determination.</p><p>Yes, he <em>would </em>destroy Albus Dumbledore once and for all. </p><p>… As soon as he figured out how to turn back into a human. What on earth had the old man cursed him with?</p><p>More concerningly, Tom had been in the middle of a solo mission when attacked. Meaning that none of his Death Eaters knew where he was. Secrecy may have been key, but it consequently meant there would be no salvation for him. </p><p>In this animal form, he was at the mercy of all that he came across. Even Muggles would find him as easy prey.</p><p>How far the mighty Lord Voldemort had fallen. </p><p>Perhaps it was a good thing his followers didn’t know this had occurred. Tom would get past this shameful ordeal and never speak of it again.</p><p>And so, with that resolution in mind, he quickly regained his canine composure. A quick mental assessment of his situation deemed that he'd first have to find a shelter before deciding upon anything else.  </p><p>So, Tom trotted—<em> walked </em>— briskly towards the nearest wizarding society, strategizing for his future travels. He needed to find a sympathetic wizard as soon as possible, and it wouldn't do to simply go to the general Diagon Alley area where he could be hexed by a drunken bargoer.  </p><p>Who in Greater London would be foolhardy enough to take in an unknown, clearly magical dog? And in answer to his unspoken question, his subconscious raised the hazy image of a green-eyed dumbass. </p><p>Harry Potter.</p><p>~~~~~______~~~~~______~~~~~~ </p><p>"C'mere, Tom! Ooh, you cute little thing, why don't you come give me a kiss? Just one? No? Aw-- ouch!" </p><p>Tom was still warming up to Harry, and life with Tom truly wasn't easy. The magnificent Doberman was pissy on good days and downright murderous on others. It didn't help that Harry was kept busy by his hectic life as an Auror. </p><p>He had been so preoccupied with work that he'd neglected to inform Ron and Hermione of his new…friend. </p><p>So when Hermione and Ron dropped by Grimmauld Place for their usual Friday evening meetup with Harry, they were very much alarmed by the formidable, growling beast of a dog. Harry had to physically stop Ron from blasting a stunning spell at Tom. </p><p>"Harry, what were you thinking?" Hermione sighed once Harry finished explaining. </p><p>"Well, I couldn't exactly leave him out on the streets, could I?” Harry frowned, crossing his arms defensively. </p><p>"Yes you bloody well could have," Ron muttered mutinously, cradling his still-throbbing hand from where Tom had bit him. He narrowed his eyes with no small amount of wariness, continuing to stare at the thing that would have happily chewed his hand off without Harry’s intervention. </p><p>When Harry only stared reproachfully back at him, Ron tried again. “Look, that nasty mutt could be a spy, a human in disguise for all you know. Remember Skeeter?" </p><p>At this, Hermione glanced up in alarm. "Ron's right. Did you even use the Animagus detection spell?" </p><p>Harry's guilty expression said it all. </p><p>"What kind of Auror are you?" She scolded, rolling up her sleeves as she pulled out her wand. Tom looked strangely skittish, but Harry wrote that off as an animal's natural reaction to seeing a wand. </p><p>Hermione spent the next several minutes casting a variety of animagus detection and reversal spells, but all to no avail. It seemed that Tom really was a dog. </p><p>"Well, what do we do now?" Hermione said at last.  </p><p>"I say we boot the dog out and send it on its merry way." </p><p>"Ron!" Hermione admonished. "That's not what I meant. I just meant that Harry should find someone else to take the poor thing in." </p><p>Meanwhile, "The Poor Thing" attempted to maul Hermione's handbag. </p><p>"What, you think I can't take care of him?" Harry demanded. </p><p>"Yes," Hermione and Ron answered in unison.  </p><p>"But why?" </p><p>"Harry, you live alone and you're out of the house around the clock for Auror work," Hermione elaborated exasperatedly. "He needs to be taken care of while you're gone." </p><p>"It's been working fine so far, and he has a <em>name </em>," Harry replied stubbornly.  </p><p>"Oh? What'd you call him?" </p><p>"Tom, obviously."  </p><p>Hermione's jaw dropped. "Harry, you named him after Tom Riddle? You mean the— " </p><p>"— horrid Slytherin a few years above us?" Ron finished, looking equally aghast. </p><p>"Uh, about that," Harry muttered, frantically trying to come up with an explanation that didn't incriminate him further. "Er, the dog kind of looks like a Tom? And he almost looks like the Tom we know. You know, their grumpy expressions, black curls, and whatnot." </p><p>Ron shot Harry an uncannily shrewd look. "You sure it's not because you had a crush on that wanker of a—“ </p><p>Harry clapped a hand over Ron's mouth, eyes darting frantically around the room as though Tom Riddle himself would manifest behind them and Avada Kedavra them.  </p><p>“Shut up, Ron,” Harry hissed before getting a hold of himself, removing his hand to casually brush off imaginary lint from his robes. “Yeah, I don’t know what you mean by <em>crush— </em>”</p><p>"Oh, Harry," Hermione said sympathetically, placing a hand on his arm. "I thought you'd gotten over him." </p><p>"Gotten over him? I have no clue what you're talking about." Harry could feel his cheeks burning, his body fighting against his own words as he crossed his arms defensively. “There’s nothing <em>to get over! </em>” </p><p>He stared determinately at the floor, trying to avoid Hermione and Ron's painfully understanding gazes. Godric, even the dog seemed to be staring at him. </p><p>"Harry." </p><p>"Can we please stop talking about this?"  </p><p>“It's all right to have a schoolboy infatuation with Tom, you know," Hermione said over Ron’s outraged sounds of disagreement.</p><p>"I told you, I'm over it," insisted Harry, lying straight through his teeth.  </p><p>"If you ever feel down about these things, you can always talk to Ginny," Ron offered hopefully. </p><p>"No," Harry snapped automatically, before catching himself and sighing tiredly. "Ron, I love Ginny as a sister, and that's all it'll ever be." </p><p>There was a long pause before Ron shrugged half-heartedly and made to turn away.  </p><p>"Oh come on," Hermione said abruptly. "Ron, let it go. We've been over this before. And oh, would you look at that. It’s time to watch the movie we came over for." </p><p>Harry gave her a grateful smile. They went over to his living room and just like that, the issue was dropped. But Harry knew the situation regarding Tom, though, was far from being resolved. </p><p>Merlin, he really needed a drink or a distraction. Or both. </p><p>~~~~~______~~~~~______~~~~~ </p><p>That distraction, unfortunately, came in the form of Head Auror Robards the next day. </p><p>"Auror Potter, Weasley, I need you to stay late and help with some additional cases." </p><p>Ah, yes. The joys of Monday mornings. Robards' tone clearly brooked no argument, not that it stopped Ron from complaining anyways. </p><p>"But sir, you've already tasked us with the DE mafia--" </p><p>"No buts, Weasley. It'll be just a few extra cases, and small ones to boot." </p><p>With that, Robards strode out of their office. Once Robards was out of earshot, Ron heaved a mighty sigh and stared morosely down at the newly-deposited stack of papers. </p><p>“D'you think he'll let us give these to Cho and Padma? Hermione's going to kill me if I miss dinner because of work again," Ron groaned, leaning back in his chair.</p><p>"They're busy with the Gibbons investigation, Ron. And from the looks of it, the cases Robards gave us seem to be pretty easy to handle," Harry noted as he flipped through the pile. </p><p>"Easy to handle? <em>Easy </em>? Harry, these are missing persons files!" Ron cried incredulously. </p><p>Harry hummed distractedly as he continued reading.  </p><p>"Remember the last time this happened? The missing persons turned out to be part of a trafficking scheme! And don't get me started on what we already have to do. Do you know how time consuming it'll be to hunt down the mafia? Months! Years! <em>Decades </em>! And— Harry, are you even listening to me?" </p><p>"You're absolutely right,” Harry said absentmindedly without looking up.  </p><p>Ron threw his hands up in exasperation. "If you're listening, nod once." </p><p>"Absolutely,” Harry mumbled while flipping the page.</p><p>"How's your day going?" </p><p>"Yes." </p><p>"How old are you?" </p><p>"Of course." </p><p>"Are you gay for Gilderoy Lockhart?" </p><p>"Certainl— <em>what the hell </em>?" </p><p>"Oh, so now you listen. Since you're so bloody high up in that cloud of yours, how about you do all these cases tonight? I sure won't be staying late," Ron huffed as he stormed away. Harry only stared after him before shrugging half-heartedly and returning to their casework. </p><p>The rest of the day passed relatively uneventfully. Harry went through some absurd civilian complaints and toiled the afternoon away by reviewing clues about the mysterious DE circle. It was well past standard work hours when he finally got to the missing persons cases, which were mercifully only the most recent ones from earlier this year. </p><p>Janice Pzietski…………................

  <em>Wait, what? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry hastily flipped back through the papers. Thomas Marvolo Riddle? Had he really read that correctly? He hastily flipped through the file, his eyes growing wider and wider by the second. </p><p>It turned out that Riddle —the very same one upperclassmen who'd frequented Harry's nighttime fantasies— had vanished just weeks ago. He was last seen near some obscure, rocky seaside far off in the country several weeks prior, but other than that, he'd been unofficially missing for quite a while. Albus Dumbledore, of all people, was the one to file the missing persons report. </p><p>Harry's heart thudded as he looked over the file again. Suddenly, he didn't feel so sleepy anymore. Although Riddle was nearly five years above Harry at Hogwarts, even Harry knew that Riddle wasn't some foolhardy person who'd simply get lost. He couldn't easily see Riddle as the victim of kidnapping either, because the Slytherin was far too intelligent and cunning for either extreme. How had Riddle disappeared, anyways? </p><p>Harry was certain of at least one thing, though. He'd find Tom Riddle if it was the last thing he ever did, and that wasn't his supposed crush on Riddle speaking. No, it was a matter of justice. Totally.</p><p> ~~~~~______~~~~~______~~~~~~ </p><p>Back in the Scottish Highlands, a certain wizened Headmaster chuckled delightedly. </p><p>
