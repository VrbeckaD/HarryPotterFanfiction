    <p>"Do you remember our first day?" Draco asks the dark haired boy next to him.</p>
<p>"Of course I do. I thought one must be mad to run head first into a brick wall." Harry chuckles and intertwines his fingers with Draco´s.<br/>
The two of them sit on a couch in the eighth year common room, watching the crackling fire.</p>
<p>"Unbelievable that was eight years ago. We´ll be out of school in about one and a half months." Harry says.</p>
<p>"Yeah." Draco sighs, "I still need to choose what I want to do after school. Mother wants me to study magical law but that´s not really what I want."</p>
<p>"What do you want then?" Harry asks and turns his head towards the blond.</p>
<p>"I don´t know and that´s the problem. The only thing I know for sure right now is that I always wanted to spend time with you." Draco looks at Harry as well and has to smile.</p>
<p>"You always wanted to spend time with me? Doesn´t seem like that in the first two years." </p>
<p>"Can we forget about first year? And maybe second year as well?" </p>
<p>"Never." Harry laughs.</p><h3>First year</h3><p>"It´s true then. Famous Harry Potter is going to Hogwarts. My name is Malfoy. Draco Malfoy." The blond boy extends his hand waiting for the other to take it.</p>
<p>"Seems like you know my name already. Nice to meet you anyway." Harry takes the hand and shakes it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"SLYTHERIN!" The sorting hat yelled when it barely touched Draco´s gelled back hair. The blond gets up and walks over to the Slytherin table where his so called friends, Crabbe and Goyle, are already sitting.<br/>
He sits down and doesn´t pay attention anymore until a certain ravenhaired boy is called to the hat.<br/>
When he sits down and the hat is placed on his head the hall went silent. After a couple of minutes, when the tension could be cut with a knife the hat yells out:</p>
<p>"Slytherin!"</p>
<p>At once the whole table stands up and applauds while Harry walks over and takes the seat next to Draco.</p>
<p>"Seems like we´re gonna spend a lot of time together then." Draco says and Harry smiles.<br/>
Later that evening, when they reach the dungeons and inspect their dorms Draco makes sure that Harry gets the bed on the right side of his own and Blaise, his closest friend so far, gets the bed on the left. Crabbe and Goyle take the left over beds without a word.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When their first class starts, Transfiguration by Professor McGonagall, Head of Gryffindor House, Draco sits next to Blaise and looks out for Harry. He doesn´t show up until twenty minutes into the lesson. Together with a red haired boy.</p>
<p>Draco rolls his eyes to focus on his work again and the only thing he hears before it´s silent again is:</p>
<p>"Or better into a map? In case you need one to find your seats." </p>
<p>Both of them sit down and start to take out their things.</p>
<p>"I´m Ron Weasley by the way." The redhead whispers and Harry introduces himself as well.</p>
<p>After this Harry starts to spend more time with the redhead and a girl with bushy hair, whose name is Hermione Granger. He comes back to the dorms shortly before curfew and he sits with them during lunch and dinner.<br/>
Draco can only watch from the sideline and a dark feeling start to grow in his belly. A feeling he can´t name. A feeling he didn´t knew before.</p>
<p>One night after christmas, when Harry gets up in the middle of the night again, Draco decides to follow him. He needs to know where his friend is going off to.<br/>
He follows the blackhaired boy up the stairs where he sees how Harry meets up with Hermione and Ron. The trio walks out the castle towards the groundskeepers hut. When the door is closed again Draco slowly walks towards the window right next to it from where he has a good look at the four persons.<br/>
He doesn´t know how long he stood there when he hears the half giant asking who is standing at the window. Draco turns on his heels and runs back up to the castle where he directly walks to Professor McGonagalls office.<br/>
He needs to tell her that those bloody Gryffindors tricked Harry into breaking the rules.<br/>
She calls the trio into her office and starts a lecture about curfew and why students aren´t allowed to wander around school grounds at night before she takes fifty points from each of them.</p>
<p>"I´m sorry Professor I think I don´t quite understand. You said the four of us?" He asks with his voice getting higher and shaky. His confident smile is gone.</p>
<p>"As noble as your intentions were, you also left your bed after curfew so you heard correclty. I take fifty points from each of you and you´ll all be getting detention."</p>
<p>The four of them leave the office in silence. Harry says "Goodbye" to Ron and Hermione at the stairs and walks down to the dungeons with Draco. </p>
<p>"I´m sorry I told Professor McGonagall." Draco starts.</p>
<p>"Leave it Draco. You wanted to get them into trouble. You wanted us to get detention but I don´t know why." Harry interrupts.</p>
<p>"Yes but-"<br/>
"Don´t even try to defend yourself. Just leave me alone ok?" Harry storms into their dorm and practically jumps into the four poster bed pulling the blanket over his head.</p>
<p>Draco tries to hold tears back. Tears he didn´t even know where there. He hadn´t cried since he was a child. His father hates it and says it´s a sign of weakness. And Malfoy´s aren´t weak.<br/>
He goes to bed as well and blows out the candle on his nightstand thinking about what happened minutes before.</p>
<p>Harry doesn´t speak with Draco until the night of their detention with Hermione and Ron. Filch, the caretaker, brings them to Hagrid who explains that they will go into the forbidden forest to find out what happened to a unicorn. </p>
<p>"Ron, Hermione you come with me, Harry you´ll go with Malfoy." Hagrid says.</p>
<p>"Fine but I´ll have Fang then." Draco says looking at the large dog sitting next to the groundskeeper.</p>
<p>"Oh sure but be aware that Fang is a big coward." And with that the little group walks into the forest.<br/>
At the second crossing Harry and Draco turn right while Hermione, Ron and Hagrid turn left. The two of them walk down the small path looking around and listen to every sound they could hear in the distance.<br/>
When they wandered around for another hour they found the unicorn. Hagrid and the other two arrive after twenty minutes and Hagrid figures out that the unicorn died because it fell badly over one of the big roots growing out the floor.</p>
<p>Back at the dorm Harry goes back to bed immediatly and Draco doesn´t get the chance to apologize again.<br/>
He took the last days to figure ot that the growing, dark feeling in hiy stomach is jealousy. And next to it he found guilt that build up since the day he got detention. </p>
<p>The two boys don´t really speak for the left weeks of the year.<br/>
When Slytherin wins the house cup and everybody is cheering and celebrating Harry gets up to sit with Ron and Hermione on the Gryffindor table, leaving Draco behind.<br/>
Harry also shares a compartement with the two Gryffindors at the train ride back and leaves the platform without glancing back. </p>
