    <p>Elsa sighed and wrapped her arms around her knees, pulling them tight to her chest. It was nearly two in the morning and she couldn’t sleep. Again. She gazed out of the window of her dorm room, high up in Ravenclaw tower. All she wanted was to have a normal experience at school, but as fate would have it, that would not be the case for her.</p><p>So much had happened in just her few short years at Hogwarts and while Anna had kept telling her that some things never change, she couldn’t help but feel like everything had done nothing but change. And she hated change. She liked her schedules and routines. Not having a logical explanation for things or not knowing what to expect made her anxious. </p><p>Things had started out relatively normal, by Hogwarts standards, at least. She and her adoptive sister came to Hogwarts at the same time. Anna had been sorted instantly into Gryffindor. She on the other hand was what some called a ‘hat stall.’ Unusual, but not unheard of. The Sorting Hat had waffled back and forth for several minutes debating whether she would be in Slytherin or Ravenclaw. Eventually she just simply asked not to be Slytherin and was astounded that the Hat <em> listened </em> to her.</p><p>And there were other normal things she did. She went to class, worked hard and got top marks. While she preferred to keep to herself, she had managed to make a few friends, namely her roommate, Rapunzel. Others just tolerated her presence by association with the personable and vibrant blonde. Anna was also there for her when she could be, but she was popular among her own social circles. Not to mention that Anna was half of Gryffindor’s dynamic, red headed, bludger beating duo. Anna and Merida Dunbroch made the Gryffindor house team as Beaters their second year. It had caused some friction between Elsa and Anna their first year, when Elsa made the Ravenclaw house team as their Seeker, a feat that hadn’t been seen since Harry Potter’s first year, 23 years prior. Again, strange, but not entirely abnormal. Some people said she was a flying prodigy. Others just said it was classic Hogwarts favoritism. Her adoptive father was Viktor Krum. Her other father was Charlie Weasley. Despite her amazing record on the quidditch pitch, she couldn’t help the doubt that gnawed at the corners of her mind.</p><p>Things started getting weird for her part way through her fourth year. Her body was starting to change, as all bodies tended to do whenever puberty decided to come knocking, but puberty hit Elsa like a freaking truck. She hid it well, though that wasn’t exactly difficult to do. The black robes weren’t the most flattering. Even when they were allowed to dress casually for Hogsmeade visits, she covered herself in thick layers to obscure her form. She wasn’t ashamed of her body but she couldn’t help but notice a steadily growing number of admirers. It seemed that every time she walked into a room, heads turned, jaws dropped, eyes glazed over, and in extreme cases, drooling ensued. Mostly the male population, though she noticed some ladies having the same reaction. She supposed she should be flattered, but really she just found it annoying.</p><p>At the end of her fourth year she noticed her <em> magic </em> was starting to change. She normally had extraordinary control when it came to casting classes like charms, transfigurations, and defense against the dark arts. But she found her power becoming unpredictable and erratic. As if she was thinking one spell but saying another, like her mind and body were at war with one another. Sometimes she struggled to cast the most basic of spells and a few times she could have sworn she saw a bluish aura around her spell’s area of effect. Naturally she had her wand inspected over the summer but it seemed the ten inch aspen wand with a mystery core was not to blame.</p><p>But a little blue light was nothing compared to when she started hearing eerie singing in her mind. The first time she heard the song was at the beginning of her fifth year, which she was currently in, and it had startled her so much she screamed out loud in the middle of potions class and received a week’s worth of detention for interrupting.</p><p>Try as she might, Elsa couldn’t deny it. Even in the magical world, she wasn’t normal. Not by a long shot. She rolled over and closed her eyes. <em> Pretending to sleep was like sleeping, right? </em></p><p> </p><p>Elsa was roused awake by a sharp poke to her ribs. She looked over to see Rapunzel, her eyes darting quickly between her and the front of class, gesturing subtly with her head.</p><p>“Miss Weasley-Krum?” A soft voice with a thick French accent floated through the air “perhaps you could answer the question?”</p><p>“I’m sorry, I don’t know.” Elsa stammered. She hadn’t even heard what the question was. She heard several snickers behind her, whatever the question was she had clearly answered wrong.  She was having a hard time staying awake in class, all of her sleepless nights catching up to her. </p><p>“I see... well, perhaps you could stay after class until you do know your answer then?” Professor Delacour tutted and turned back to the blackboard.</p><p>Elsa groaned and leaned back in her chair, staring at the ceiling.</p><p> </p><p>After class Elsa packed her books and parchment and went to the front of the class, staring at a particularly uninteresting spot of Fleur’s desk. “You wanted to see me, Professor?”</p><p>Fleur sat down in her chair and gestured for Elsa to take a seat “first, I want to make it clear that you are not in trouble.” Fleur waited until Elsa was seated to continue “I’ll speak frankly with you. I’m worried for you.” She paused but when Elsa merely responded with a shrug and refused to look at her she continued “I’ve noticed a dramatic decline in your performance in class. You look like you haven’t slept in days and Rapunzel tells me you barely eat anymore. As head of your house, I hope you know you can trust me and I would like you to know that you can speak to me about anything. This is a safe space.”</p><p>Elsa looked up a little “I... I don’t know, Professor. I just...” she closed her eyes tight when she heard the song again. She had conditioned herself not to flinch or be startled but it still took her off guard. It was louder this time, the notes clearer than before. As if it was demanding that she listened. </p><p>Fleur raised an eyebrow, noting Elsa’s reaction “you heard it?”</p><p>Elsa’s jaw dropped “Professor?”</p><p>Fleur held up her hand for silence and quickly cast a number of protective enchantments around the room to prevent anyone from listening in or interrupting.</p><p>Elsa gazed in wonder, <em> was Fleur hearing the same voice? </em> But she knew that was impossible. She had thoroughly researched spells to make someone hear voices in their mind and had come up empty. The closest thing she found was occlumency but that was more about seeing and manipulating existing memories. “How? How did you know?” She stammered.</p><p>Fleur smiled gently “Because I went through something similar to what you are experiencing now when I was about your age.”</p><p>Elsa couldn’t believe her ears “you know what’s wrong with me? I thought I was going mental!”</p><p>“My dear, there is nothing wrong with you. I’ve always wondered about you but didn’t say anything, lest my suspicions proved to be incorrect...” Fleur waved her hand and her teapot came floating across the room with two mugs. “Tea?”</p><p>Elsa nodded but was getting impatient. She wanted answers and she wanted them <em> now </em>.</p><p>Fleur slid a mug of tea over to Elsa and gripped her own, taking a sip before continuing “you are awakening.”</p><p>Elsa furrowed her brow “I’m fairly certain I <em> am </em> awake, Professor.”</p><p>“In the physical sense, yes, I suppose you are correct... but there is a power inside you. And all this time it has been sleeping deep inside your mind. But no longer. It is stirring.”</p><p>Elsa gawked at her teacher. “I’m so confused. What were you wondering about me?”</p><p>Fleur simply chuckled “Elsa, may I call you Elsa? I feel like we are past formalities, at least in this setting. Before I say anything, what I am about to tell you is a very big secret and your very safety, as well as the safety of others, depends on you keeping that secret. You must promise me that you will not speak of any of this to anyone else. This includes your own family, at least for now. Can you do that?” Elsa nodded and Fleur continued “have you ever wondered why we look so similar? The hair, the skin, the eyes? When we first met, you felt safe around me, yes? Like you could trust me?”</p><p>“I mean, I suppose it is a little unnerving, our similarities.” Elsa set her mug down.</p><p>“It’s because we are alike, you and I.” </p><p>“What do you mean? Alike how? Are we related?”</p><p>“No, we are not related... but you are like me” Fleur smiled softly “You’re a Veela, Elsa. And your Veela is awakening.”</p><p>Elsa was glad she had set down her tea, otherwise she probably would have dropped it on the floor “I’m a what?”</p><p>“A Veela.” Fleur repeated “We are a proud and noble species, but over the centuries we have been hunted out of fear or to exploit our resources, like our feathers, hair, even eggs. So we have kept most knowledge of our existence and culture out of the public books. There are some wizards who have made assumptions about us, so even what is written about us is not always correct."</p><p>Elsa stared wide-eyed but nodded for her to continue. </p><p>“We usually live in close-knit clans. Or in my case I decided to spread my wings but I still keep in close contact with my family, but I keep my identity hidden, even here.” She paused “though I’ll admit I’m rather curious that you did not know and also how you came to be out of a clan in the first place. Would you mind telling me about your childhood?”</p><p>“I’m told that I was found, abandoned as a baby... my dads were on a dragon research mission in Norway and they came across an abandoned house or something and I was inside.” Elsa shrugged. </p><p>Fleur frowned “are you sure? That is very un-Veela. It is not our way. It is very rare for a Veela to find their one true mate, as it is, and even if we are successful in finding them, there are other challenges. We come into cycle very infrequently and we cannot procreate with anyone other than our mate, so our numbers have been slow to grow. Sometimes a couple will only have one or two children in their long lifetime together. Therefore each offspring is extremely precious to us, parents and even clans would rather die to protect... oh... <em> merde... </em>” Fleur stopped talking immediately as Elsa burst into tears.</p><p> </p><p>“Remind me exactly why I’m helping you with this?” Honeymaren groaned.</p><p>“Because you’re my roommate and you love me!” Anna giggled “and because Merida has detention for accidentally setting Maleficent’s robes on fire...”</p><p>Honeymaren rolled her eyes but did not say anything back.</p><p>“Look, I know you don’t like my sister... in fact I think you might be the one person that borderline despises her, and I guess I’m okay with that. I mean, you’re welcome to have your opinions and all... but I need your help. I can’t do this alone.”</p><p>“There are literally <em> a hundred </em> other people I’m sure would be clamoring over themselves to help you plan this foolish attempt at a pick-me-up for Saint Els... ugh I mean your sister.” Honeymaren huffed “Fine... but you owe me. Big!” She finally conceded when Anna pulled out her puppy eyes.</p><p>Anna squealed and hugged her friend “I knew I could count on you!”</p><p>“How do you know something is wrong or that she even wants this? And more importantly, how do you even know where to find her? I mean, I heard she kinda fell off the face of the planet a couple weeks ago after her talk with Professor Delacour. Like, no one knows where she goes when she’s not in class or on the quidditch pitch.”</p><p>Anna rolled her eyes “okay first, I just <em> know </em> because she’s my sister. I can see it in her eyes whenever I do see her... second, it’s chocolate and Elsa <em> lives </em> for chocolate. And third... it’s chocolate. Whatever. I’m certain she will come running! And I kinda convinced Raps to let us in their room later. So she’ll get it, eventually.”</p><p>Honeymaren shrugged “fine. What do you need me to do?”</p><p> </p><p>Three hours later, Anna, Honeymaren, and Rapunzel had finally managed to enchant a dozen chocolate snitches to hover and zoom around Elsa’s four-post-bed. </p><p>Honeymaren flopped down on the bed, feeling mentally drained. They had started with three dozen snitches but lost about two dozen due to trial and error as they practiced getting the enchantments just right. The exploded, melted and smoking  snitch corpses still littered the floor. </p><p>“You know that’s my sister’s bed, right?” Anna crossed her arms and raised an eyebrow. </p><p>Honeymaren immediately jumped up and brushed herself off. </p><p>“I’m pretty sure Elsa doesn’t have cooties.” Rapunzel giggled “I still don’t know what your problem is with her, I think she’s really nice.”</p><p>Honeymaren shrugged “Maybe to you... and does it really matter? I’m allowed to not like people, you know.”</p><p>Anna sat down next to the blonde “Elsa accidentally hit Honeymaren in the face with her broom in Diagon Alley the summer before first year. She apologized of course but I think Maren still holds a grudge. Either that or she’s just jealous of my sister… either is viable I think.”</p><p>“I am not jealous! And I am not a child, I don’t hold grudges!” Honeymaren protested. She looked around the dorm room and something caught her eye. She moved over to Elsa’s night stand and picked up a family picture, the little figures waving up at her from some beach, gentle waves rolling in the background. She noticed a much younger looking Elsa and Anna, both with giant grins. “Wow... I didn’t know she was capable of smiling.”</p><p>Anna got up and looked at it “oh, yeah, that was from our family vacation a few years back. We went to Shell Cottage... it’s been in the family for generations. Papa says that they used it during the great war, like, as a hideout. Pretty cool, I think.” Anna smiled at the memory and knelt down to start clearing the floor of evidence of their failed spells. </p><p>Honeymaren hummed and set the frame back down where she found it. Her eyes caught a quick movement out the window and she looked out just in time to see a platinum blonde-haired figure disappear into the Forbidden Forest.</p>
