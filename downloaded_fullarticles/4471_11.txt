  <em>He’s coming. -MH</em>
</p>
<p>Two words, glaring from the phone screen, enough to send a mix of disgust and panic shuddering through Sherlocks thin frame as the detective stood in 221b Baker Street. As he aimlessly glared at the message, his phone buzzed once more.</p>
<p>
  <em> I advise you warn Dr. Watson. Last I checked, he was unaware of our predicament. -MH</em>
</p>
<p>With that, Sherlock hurled the offending phone across the room, stalking throughout the flat, ignoring John Watson’s call of “What was that?” as he approached the door. The dark-haired man started locking it, something he almost never did, when John came up behind him. “Sherlock, what the hell-are you locking the door?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” John walked into Sherlock’s view, confusion evident in his face.</p>
<p>“And why are you doing that?”</p>
<p>“Avoidance of an old friend.” Sherlock muttered, the word friend spat out in disgust. John merely rolled his eyes in response, long-used to Sherlocks definition of ‘friend’.</p>
<p>“Right, well try to keep blood out of the carpet. Mrs. Hudson will throw a fit.” John replied easily, before turning and leaving his eccentric roommate to his business.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>Two days later found John’s voice carrying through the flat as he stared at Sherlock’s newly repaired phone. “Why the hell is Mycroft texting you about my sister?”</p>
<p>Sherlock appeared in his doorway, goggles balanced haphazardly in his black curls as the ash-blonde continued. “‘Harry will be there soon. Do warn Dr. Watson.’ What the hell is he on about?”</p>
<p>“Oh. That.” Sherlock replied blandly before leaving. John stood, following.</p>
<p>“Yes, ‘that’! Sherlock!”</p>
<p>Sherlock whirled around, labcoat flying dramatically around him, facing the older man. “It isn’t your sister. I told you, it’s an old friend. One from school, in fact. It doesn’t concern you.” John stepped back as though physically hit at the last remark, opening his mouth to yell out a scathing reply when a knock sounded at the door.</p>
<p>Sending Sherlock one last glare to make it clear the conversation would continue, John went to see who their newest case was, opening the door to find a thin young man with messy dark hair and eerily green eyes. The man’s face fell when he saw John, smile leaving thin lips, glasses sliding down his nose. “I’m terribly sorry, but does a Sherlock Holmes live around here?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. I’m his flatmate, John Watson.” John ushered the man inside, briefly scanning the street for a car or taxi only to find neither. He mentally shrugged, closing the door.</p>
<p>The thin man standing inside offered John a smile. “Sorry, I just didn’t think Sherlock the type to share a flat. I’m-” The man suddenly cut himself off as Sherlock appeared in the hall, only to turn and attempt to walk away. “Sherlock!” Sherlock barely even stopped moving, just glanced over his shoulder to glare at the green-eyed man.</p>
<p>“My answer remains the same, Potter. I’m not one of you. Not anymore.”</p>
