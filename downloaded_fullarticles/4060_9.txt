    <p>"Ariesa! Come on!" Scorpius whined, "Could you take any longer?" </p><p>Ariesa was currently hogging the shower. The Malfoys had about a dozen more. But wandering the mansion meant that Scorpius would have had to leave his sister. Which he rarely did. Actually, scratch that out. He never left his twin sister's side. Ever. Not even to leave for the bathroom. They were Malfoys after all. Their name had been tarnished long ago. Meaning, sneers had glares wherever they went. They were haunted by reality. And the twins were the only ones who could get each other. In a way only twins could. Especially, the Malfoy twins. </p><p>"Give me a minute!" Was her reply. </p><p>Scorpius scowled, yet, he still stood his ground. </p><p>"You said that about fifteen minutes ago!" He shouted accusingly. </p><p>A sigh erupted from her throat. Throwing open the door, Ariesa glowered at her brother. </p><p>"Done," She stated before pushing past him. </p><p>However, she leant against the wall instead of leaving. </p><p>"What are you waiting for?" Ariesa asked innocently. </p><p>Shoving the door of open, Scorpius muttered a series of cusses under his breath. </p><p>。．。．。．。．。．。．。．。．。．。．。 </p><p>Groaning, Ariesa stretched her sore arms. Blinking, she rubbed her eyes. She looked to her left. Scorpius was lying on his side - facing her. He was still in deep slumber. Ariesa sighed. He looked so peaceful. Ariesa liked it like this. She knew - very well - that Scorpius was older by five minutes, but she still felt like she was. </p><p>"Scorp," Ariesa whispered, shuffling over to him, "Wake up." </p><p>Scorpius mumbled something into his silk pillow. Ariesa desperately tried to think of a reason to get him out of bed. Ultimately, realization splashed her like a bucket of ice water. Ariesa pulled herself out of her warm sheets. Her feet touched the frozen floor. Ariesa hissed softly. She carefully tiptoed to Scorpius' bed. </p><p>"We're going shopping for Hogwarts...," She muttered into his ear. </p><p>Scorpius was on his feet in seconds. </p><p>"We are!?" He questioned. </p><p>"D'you really think that I would lie about that?" Ariesa responded, smirking slightly. </p><p>It was times like this that she felt older. But she still knew that she wouldn't be able to function should Scorpius disappear from the face of the earth. She needed him. So bad. </p><p>"Hey... Uh... Ariesa?" Scorpius noted, "You're doing it again." </p><p>He waved his hands in front of her face jokingly. </p><p>Ariesa apologized, saying, "Sorry, but we had better go change." </p><p>Her brother nodded. Grabbing a black shirt and jeans from his closet, Scorpius made his way to the bathroom. Ariesa snagged a sweater and tights before following her brother. Beeline. She caught up. They walked together. </p><p>Hopping out, Ariesa grinned contently. Scorpius looked at her weirdly. </p><p>"No, just look," She insisted, pointing at the window. </p><p>Scorpius followed her gaze. His parents were standing outside their manor. Standing together. Astoria was resting her head in the crook of Draco's neck. He had an arm around her waist. Their mother was incredibly frail, having had a curse passed on to her from an ancestor. Childbirth had been risky - too risky. Yet, she had the twins. </p><p>Scorpius tried his best to sound amused, "When you came out, the first you look at is the window? Seriously?" </p><p>"What else was I meant to look at!?" Ariesa exclaimed, "You!?" </p><p>Scorpius laughed this time. It wasn't the usual hollow sound. But a real laugh. Not held back - restrained. A laugh only Scorpius Malfoy could do. It unsettled people. However, he only ever laughed like that with his sister. And she grinned. </p><p>"Let's go," She urged. </p><p>Scorpius beamed in compliance. Tailing his sister to the door. </p><p>"Are you ready?" Astoria asked, standing up straighter. </p><p>The twins didn't smile. Around their parents they were cold. They loved them dearly, don't get it wrong. But, they couldn't help it. They barely knew their parents. Apart from random holidays to countries they could barely pronounce, the twins didn't have the comfort of knowing that they were loved. </p><p>"Yes, mother," Ariesa put out. </p><p>Not mum - never mum. Always mother. </p><p>Draco took Astoria's hand and turned on his heel. The twins lumbered after their parents. </p><p>。．。．。．。．。．。．。．。．。．。．。 </p><p>~~One Week Later~~ </p><p>Dizziness was the only thing that Ariesa knew for a long second. A churning stomach. The faint smell of smoke filled the air. Limiting their view. Wizards and Witches zoomed about. They had Apparated to Platform 9 and 3/4. Much to the displeasure of the twins. And the gulp of pain their mother had let out only made it worse. </p><p>Recovering, Astoria smiled as kindly as she could, saying, "Sweets. They always help you make friends." </p><p>Ariesa took the sweets her mother had held out. Scorpius smiled thankfully. But that grin was wiped away immediately. Ariesa quietly stuffed the treats into her pocket. </p><p>"Your luggage?" Draco questioned coldly. </p><p>Astoria beamed. </p><p>"I have them," She reassured them. </p><p>She handed the two trolleys to the respective twin. Grinning the entire time. </p><p>"Thank you," Ariesa breathed. </p><p>Scorpius smiled slightly. The trained emitted a sound. Sighing deeply, Ariesa trudged silently into the train. Not even bothering to say "Goodbye." Scorpius however managed to give Astoria a quick hug before belting after his sister. Yet, he didn't know that he was being eyeballed by a certain redhead. Four, in fact. He didn't know that that simple hug would make a difference in his life. A huge difference. </p><p>。．。．。．。．。．。．。．。．。．。．。 </p><p>"Scorp, have you found one?" Ariesa inquired. </p><p>"No," Her brother admitted, "Everytime I look into a compartment, those in there just glare at me. They don't want us in there." </p><p>Ariesa mumbled incoherently. Scorpius groaned. </p><p>"How about that one?" Ariesa questioned. </p><p>Scorpius looked up, his eyes glistening hopefully. </p><p>"It's empty," Ariesa added. </p><p>His face fell. </p><p>For a second he thought someone might not have been so narrow minded. So... He couldn't even think about it. Shrugging, Scorpius lugged his luggage into the compartment. Throwing it down haphazardly. </p><p>"Hey," Ariesa voiced out, "Don't take it out on your luggage." </p><p>She proceeded to force a fake a laugh. </p><p>"No, I just thought... I just - you know dad said that Hogwarts would be the best we'd ever get? By that, I thought, you know what? Maybe people might just forget the surname. I mean - !" Scorpius ranted. </p><p>"Is anyone sitting here?" someone asked nervously. </p><p>The twins turned to look at the beholder of that voice. Unkempt, jet black hair mounted his head. Deep green irises that you could get lost in. Slightly tan - very slightly. A girl stood next to the raven haired boy. She had flaming hair, redder than a fire. Expressive dark brown eyes and pale, freckled skin. Rose Weasley and Albus Severus Potter. </p><p>"No...?" Ariesa offered. </p><p>Albus nodded. Rose, however, crossed her arms. </p><p>"Al, do you know who they are?" She coughed. </p><p>"Yes," Albus shrugged, "I think." </p><p>"They're Malfoys! Merlin's beard, Al!" Rose snorted. </p><p>Ariesa visibly shrank. Leaning back further into her seat. Scorpius winced at her condescending tone. </p><p>"They seem nice enough," Albus noted. </p><p>"Al...!" Rose whined, "Let's go!" </p><p>Suddenly, Ariesa remembered. </p><p>"Sweets?" she asked quietly - hopefully, "We have some Sugar Quills." </p><p>Albus grinned. Reaching out for one. Throwing her hands up, Rose groaned. </p><p>"They could have poisoned those things!" She exclaimed, "They know who you are!" </p><p>Ariesa exploded, yelling, "We did not!" at the same time that Scorpius mumbled, "Albus. Albus Severus Potter." </p><p>Rose glared at the silver haired girl. "I don't trust them," She announced before storming off. </p><p>Albus rolled his eyes. </p><p>"She's like that," Albus said, taking a Sugar Quill, "Sorry." </p><p>The twins gaped at him as he sat down. Ariesa almost burst into tears. Call her a tad dramatic, but she was a Malfoy. She bore the most powerful yet the most disliked - hated - name in the wizarding world. Apart from Voldemort, that is. People never spoke to them. Much less willingly sat next to them! </p><p>"What?" Albus questioned when he caught them staring, "What's wrong?" </p><p>Ariesa blinked. Scorpius cleared his throat. </p><p>"Scorpius," He introduced himself, "And that's my twin sister, Ariesa. I guess you know who we are, but... Uh... - Good afternoon?" </p><p>Albus beamed. He honestly didn't care for formalities. </p><p>"Call me Albus," Albus laughed, "Or maybe Al." </p><p>Scorpius nodded instinctively. Ariesa's lips quirked upwards slightly. </p><p>"So," Ariesa looked hopeful, "You're not leaving?" </p><p>"No...," Albus dragged out, "Why would you think that? Do you want me to?" </p><p>"NO!" The twins vociferated. </p><p>Albus was taken aback. Those two must be really lonely to want me around, he thought. He was right. For the former of his thoughts. (Just the first six words.)</p><p>"Okay...?" He mumbled, slightly weirded out. </p><p>Since when did any Malfoy want a Potter as company? Sometimes, things were too much. Ariesa grinned a little. Reaching into her pocket, she removed the remainder of the Sugar Quills. </p><p>"Take them," She urged Albus, "I don't fancy sweets anyways. At least, not these." </p><p>Beaming stupidly, Albus gratefully grasped the treats in his hand. Somehow, he knew, these people were going to mean a lot to him. </p><p>。．。．。．。．。．。．。．。．。．。．。 </p><p>The cold was really getting to her at this point. She wasn't really freezing though. Not physically at least. But somehow, her insides just felt cold. Like standing-on-a-sinking-ship cold. Freezing your feels instead of chilling your bones. Like the thought of knowing that you were going to die. Depart from this cruel world. Leave. Ariesa felt like that. Like she knew someone was going to die. </p><p>"Scorp," Ariesa mumbled, nudging her brother, "Are you cold?" </p><p>Scorpius stopped halfway through his sentence. </p><p>"No. Are you?" He answered, worry edging his voice. </p><p>Ariesa risked a glance at Albus. He was looking at them. Not looking down on but looking at them. Like any other person would to another. Ariesa would have laughed with relief if she could. But, instead, she replied with a quick, "No." Scorpius nodded, but he made a point to shift closer to her. Ariesa smiled to herself as she rested her head on his shoulder. They were that close. </p><p>"I have a homemade sweater if you need it," Albus offered. </p><p>"No," Ariesa assured him, "It's fine. I'm not." </p><p>"Sure...?" Albus gave up trying. </p><p>Scorpius motioned to their luggage. Gazing at her, he nodded. If you could read looks like a book, Ariesa knew that he wanted her to get a pillow. Take a nap. A nap was probably the last thing on Ariesa's mind. Considering what had happened. They had literally been glared at by a Weasley. Friended by a Potter. And she'd been having a sick feeling in her gut. Still - sleep wasn't even an English word to her. Not anymore. </p><p>"Are you even listening to me?" Scorpius asked, slightly annoyed, slightly worried. </p><p>Ariesa's eyes snapped into focus. </p><p>"What?" She questioned dumbly. </p><p>Scorpius' gaze softened. </p><p>"You have bags under your eyes. Go take a nap," He repeated.</p><p>Naps were almost like dying. A very condensed way of leaving the world. Most people died in their sleep. One second they're alive and awake, the next they're just... Dead. Death was just so sudden - so final. You never knew when you'd go. You wouldn't even know if you'd die happy. In the least, fulfilled. </p><p>"Ariesa," Albus called. His voice sounded so far away. </p><p>"Are you okay," He aske.<br/>
Life seemed to flood back into her body. </p><p>"Yes," She responded simply. </p><p>Scorpius straightened a little. Ariesa glanced tiredly at him. Almost reluctantly. </p><p>"Is it - " He tried but she cut him off. </p><p>She already knew what he would say. What he would worry about. What he would waste his precious time on. </p><p>Her. </p><p>And she secretly loved it. But that didn't mean she liked him all protective. Not overly. It just felt good to feel loved. Worried over - having others' time wasted on you. </p><p>"I'm fine," Ariesa insisted, "I'm going to sleep." </p><p>She turned at little. So that her back was against the wall. </p><p>Hugging her legs to her her chest, she muttered, "Wake me up an hour before we reach Hogwarts. Remember." </p><p>Then, she was knocked out cold. Breathing raggedly. Scorpius was left to watch Ariesa in slumber. And he swore that he heard her murmur something weird.</p><p>"Is she... Like delirious?" Albus asked quietly, afraid to offend him. </p><p>Instead of getting offended, Scorpius bit his lip. </p><p>"A little," He replied, "She sees things differently. If she's delirious? Maybe not. Maybe just a really pessimistic person." </p><p>"Is she suicidal?" Albus questioned, still cautious so as to not cross boundaries. </p><p>Silence ensued. </p><p>"Aren't we all?" Scorpius asked him back. </p><p>"Most aren't," Albus pointed out. </p><p>With a sinking feeling in his gut, Albus realised that Scorpius was actually answering his question. Just very subtly. </p><p>"You're not, are you?" Albus voiced out. </p><p>Scorpius stopped dead. He racked his brain for an answer. It had never really occurred to him. Death. He was ten - still young. Yet, he was was an ten-year-old who faced death glares every single day. He couldn't leave his manor without being jeered and sneered at. People didn't pity him. </p><p>Scorpius remembered vividly, when he was five. His parents had taken him and his sister to Diagon Alley. And left them for five minutes. Ariesa had fallen over and broke her leg. He'd screamed bloody murder. Ariesa hadn't even shed a tear, still, she was in excruciating pain. </p><p>And no one had helped. </p><p>Nobody had even lifted a finger to assist them. Even though there was a five-year-old girl lying on the ground. Unable to stand. In brilliant pain. And no one had helped. They just stared. Scorpius had heard some, </p><p>"Serves them right!" </p><p>And... </p><p>"Silly little girl! Can't even walk properly!" </p><p>Maybe even, "There's a Malfoy here! Malfoys! I'm leaving!" </p><p>Scorpius was so young when he realised that life wasn't perfect. He realised that life was cruel. People weren't any different. Sure, they didn't judge you by your blood. As long as you weren't of Malfoy blood. Or from any family that was in ties with Voldemort at one point in history. And their children were those who suffered the consequences of their parents. They did nothing, yet, they had to face everything. </p><p>Still, Scorpius said, "No." </p><p>Albus only nodded. However, he knew that Scorpius was lying. </p><p>。．。．。．。．。．。．。．。．。．。．。 </p><p>She looked too peaceful to wake. Scorpius knew it all too well. Yet, he knew, he'd have to face her wrath, should he not do so. Unwilling, Scorpius poked her ribs. Ariesa squirmed slightly, pushing his hands away. </p><p>"You're not making this easy for me," Scorpius told her, pouting. </p><p>Ariesa groaned, annoyed, before ripping her eyes open. Albus had his knees to his chest. He was staring at them keenly. </p><p>"Are we there yet?" Ariesa yawned, covering her mouth with her hand. Say what you want about the Malfoys. They were taught mannerisms. </p><p>Scorpius shrugged, "Almost." </p><p>Ariesa nodded as the words sunk in. Almost. They were nearly there. Their redemption. Hogwarts. </p><p>"We should put on our robes," Albus suggested, "We're nearly there, aren't we?" </p><p>Robes.... It hadn't been hard to locate them. But convincing the shop keeper sell it to them hadn't been an easy task. It wasn't because they couldn't afford it. They had enough gold to last three lifetimes. But people were indirectly shutting them away from Hogwarts. Unwilling to let them have their supplies. The downright refusal hurt. </p><p>The twins shrugged. Removing the thick back robes from their suitcases, they threw them on. The warmth enveloped her body. Almost reassuringly. Telling her that it was going to be okay. The train slowed eventually. Ariesa felt a surge of hope flood her senses. </p><p>She was going to try and start anew. But she knew that it wasn't going to be easy. Her goal was mainly to make a few friends. Get to know people. Let them know you. Just a couple of people you wouldn't be bothered by her surname. Just be her friends. Simple enough. </p><p>Compartment doors were thrown open. The stupid, giddily insane sensation vibrating through the train. The excitement for a new year. Buzzing. Her head was buzzing. Ariesa had no experience with being drunk. But she was sure she must have felt like she was. Her brain was mush. Goosebumps appeared on her pale skin. Her cheeks were flushed from the cold. </p><p>"Are you okay?" Scorpius asked brightly. </p><p>Ariesa grinned widely. Her twin was always too excited for his own good. The unsuppressed jubilance never hurt. </p><p>"Never better," Ariesa replied. </p><p>Albus lugged the suitcases out from under their seats. He handed them to the twins, beaming broadly. </p><p>As if he felt her inquisitive look before it had even formed, Albus laughed, saying, "Rose has mine. I hope she doesn't burn it." </p><p>Scorpius chuckled at that. The twins gratefully took their luggage, depositing them with the carriages. </p><p>"ALRIGH', FIRS' YEARS!" a gruff voice rumbled through the station. </p><p>The lot of them shuffled towards the beholder. An incredibly tall man with a corpulent body was herding all the anxious eleven-year-olds. His beard was a mangled mess. Parchment coloured shirt and a brown robe. Black three quarter pants and enormous boots. His warm beady eyes scanned the area. A megawatt smile plastered on his face. </p><p>"ALBUS!" his gravely voice bellowed. </p><p>Albus' eyes snapped up. Their gazes met. </p><p>"Hagrid!" Albus beamed, waving.</p><p>Hagrid grinned back in response. He stared at the two masses of silver hair next to him. He did a double take. </p><p>"Oh...," He let out. </p><p>The tips of Ariesa's ears went red. </p><p>"Come on now, firs' years this way!" Hagrid chose to just ignore the twins. </p><p>Albus noticed the crestfallen looks on their faces. Whispers rippled through the crowd. Scorpius didn't seem as hyped anymore. </p><p>"It's okay, Hagrid's like that. He didn't really like your dad...," Albus consoled. </p><p>A sinking feeling in her gut, Ariesa plainted inwardly. Who does like our dad? </p><p>She felt like screaming. But she couldn't. Not here. Not now. Not with so many people here. Just bottle it up. Just... Ariesa sucked in breath. </p><p>She wasn't coming here to make friends. Not anymore. She was going to salvage what was left of the Malfoy name. She'd be living. She'd live. Not just breathing. Not just sucking up all the negativity. She'd live like any other. Her surname won't be hated when she was done. She would do it for herself... </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And her brother.</p>
