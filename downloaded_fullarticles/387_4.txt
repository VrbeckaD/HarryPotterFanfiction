    <p>"Miss Lovegood!"<br/> <br/> Luna looked up dreamily at the sound of her name, her eyes travelling up to where her Potions professor was glaring at her.<br/> <br/> "Yes?"<br/> <br/> "Yes, <em>sir</em>," Professor Snape corrected curtly.<br/> <br/> "I'm actually not a sir, sir, I'm a ma'am," Luna said, channeling Harry Potter inadvertently.<br/> <br/> Snape looked ready to lecture her and - oh, he <em>was</em> lecturing her now. Deciding that she had better things to do than listen to his condescension, Luna looked back at her potion and carried on swirling it round.<br/> <br/> "Lovegood!" S barked angrily. "Are you listening? 5 points from Ravenclaw!"<br/> <br/> Luna's housemates looked unbothered; they were used to losing points all the time. The Ravenclaw next to her, Terry Boot, even chuckled at Snape's expression. Luna didn't look up, instead continuing with her potion.<br/> <br/> "I did not," Snape hissed from next to Luna, "want you to make <em>this</em>." He gestured at her cauldron. "I asked for the antidote to poison berries."<br/> <br/> Luna beamed at him. "Exactly! I'm making it using an old family recipe."<br/> <br/> "The instructions are on the board," Snape said, sounding frustrated. "I expect you to follow them."<br/> <br/> "Oh!" she said. "Well, we shouldn't all follow expectations all the time, right? Professor Dumbledore was telling us that the other day."<br/> <br/> Snape looked livid as he said, "This is <em>my</em> <em>detention</em>."<br/> <br/> "Of course," Luna smiled. "But wouldn't it be wonderful for you to learn how to brew a new potion? This one uses Nargles' blood."<br/> <br/> "Nargles have blood?" asked Terry. Luna nodded, before launching into an explanation of how she had acquired this particular sample of blood. As she did, Snape scowled and drifted to the front, muttering about how much he hated Ravenclaws... and Gryffindors.<br/> <br/> Across the classroom, Michael Corner and Anthony Goldstein were exchanging whispers as they pondered on what exactly everyone had done to get in this particular detention. Luna's reason was the easiest to work out: the way she consistently managed to drive Snape up the wall was simply legendary. Little Jess from first year was probably here for hexing another Slytherin, and her best friend Kerrie seemed to be her accomplice. Wanda from seventh year had probably used wandless magic in Potions again. Michael told Anthony proudly about how he hadn't handed in his essay for over a month.<br/> <br/> "Every week I forget, Professor Snape adds another scroll," Michael added, making Anthony shake his head in disappointment. "Why are you here then?"<br/> <br/> "Restricted Section," he muttered, remembering how he had been caught in the library at 3am with piles of books about dark magic. "I just wanted to read something about Egyptian curses, but apparently 'students shouldn't be looking around in places they're not wanted'."<br/> <br/> "Filch's words?" Michael guessed, to which Anthony nodded.<br/> <br/> The two looked over at the final person in the room beside the teacher: their good friend and roommate Terry.<br/> <br/> "So what d'you think <em>he</em> did to get here?" Anthony said, and Michael seemed to know who he meant.<br/> <br/> "No idea. Did he forget work?"<br/> <br/> "No chance. He's the one who keeps reminding us to hand it in on time."<br/> <br/> "Unauthorised magic?"<br/> <br/> "Can't be, we'd hear about that."<br/> <br/> "And it isn't like him to get caught anyway," Michael mused. "He couldn't possibly have cursed someone?"<br/> <br/> "Doubt it," Anthony said, but even he looked doubtful at his own judgement. "We could ask, I guess."<br/> <br/> "Thanks for volunteering," Michael grinned, patting his best friend on the back and sending him off towards Terry, who was currently pouring some of his potion into a small vial for Snape's inspection.<br/> <br/> Sighing, Anthony approached Terry and painted a smile onto his face.<br/> <br/> "Hey, Terry!" he greeted. His friend turned around, mid-pour, and waved. The vial overflowed, but Luna leaned over and fixed the problem quickly.<br/> <br/> "Thanks, Luna," Terry said, before turning back to Anthony with a confused look. "What's up?"<br/> <br/> "We were, uh, just surprised to see you here," Anthony said. "In detention. Without telling us."<br/> <br/> Luna giggled as if he had told a joke and Anthony frowned at her, causing her to shake her head and turn back to her strange concoction. Terry, on the other hand, seemed unfazed.<br/> <br/> "The usual," he said, making Anthony blink. "I tried to get into the Puffs' common room. Didn't work as well as usual. Professor Sprout knew as soon as she saw the vinegar, but she thought I should have detention with Snape instead because he's supposed to be more mean."<br/> <br/> "You go to their common room often?" Anthony said, surprised.<br/> <br/> "Sure," Terry nodded. "They have this fascinating debate club - didn't anyone tell you?"<br/> <br/> Anthony was half-shocked that Terry regularly went to the Hufflepuff common room and half-offended that he hadn't been invited. Sensing his annoyance, Terry reached over and patted his shoulder.<br/> <br/> "I'll ask if you can come next week," he consoled. Packing up his bag and tidying away his materials, he slipped a spare vial of the potion into his pocket. "Are you going to the dorm after this?"<br/> <br/> "Yeah, I might as well," Anthony said. "It's getting a bit late."<br/> <br/> "Not too late for you, apparently," Terry laughed. "I heard you were caught in the Restricted Section with some banned books."<br/> <br/> "Word spreads fast," Anthony mumbled, returning to his seat.<br/> <br/> Behind him, Terry turned to Luna and offered the spare vial to her. "You might want the version Snape asked for, to avoid more detention."<br/> <br/>Luna thanked him but declined. "This potion - the one I'm making - works, too. I know he doesn't like it, but he has to open his mind."<br/> <br/> Terry sighed. "Your choice, I guess. Bye, Luna."<br/> <br/> After depositing his vial at the front of the classroom, he left the room with an unceremonious wave to the other Ravenclaws.<br/> <br/> Snape watched in disgust as Luna added a daisy chain to her now-turquiose concoction. Lamenting silently about his tragic childhood, he watched the remaining Ravenclaws finish their potions and leave one by one. It was confusing, to him, why so many from the so-called 'smart house' were so incompetent. The very fact that he had to reserve an hour for the weekly build up of Ravenclaw detentions was a clear sign that Flitwick needed to clamp down on this bad behaviour.<br/> <br/> With this in mind, Snape slipped from the room and locked the empty classroom behind him. Next week, he thought to himself, he should get them to clean the storage cabinet or something.<br/> <br/> Little did he know, there was someone hiding behind him, waiting for him to lose his guard. The person knocked him out with a quiet <em>Stupefy!</em> and pulled out a strangely shaped bottle. Opening the bottle's lid, they squeezed the substance onto his hair and tried to rub it into his scalp.<br/> <br/> "About time you shampooed," they whispered, before scampering off into the darkness, their yellow-and-black-striped scarf flying behind them as they ran.</p>
