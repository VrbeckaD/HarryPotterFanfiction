    <p align="justify">“No Potter, I will not go with you,” Lily was on auto-pilot; these words had become a part of her daily vocabulary since the Yule Ball had been announced just over a month ago. Every day since, after the bell that signalled the end of the day’s classes had rung, she was greeted promptly by an arrogant Head Boy, who seemed to enjoy nothing more than tormenting her. So much so, that he seemed to revel in her constant rejections, only seeing it as another opportunity to bother her again tomorrow. Luckily for Lily, this was the last day of term, however she doubted that James would let something like a lack of schedule deter his efforts to make her days that little bit more irritating.</p><p align="justify">“Oh come on Evans, going alone would just be sad,” James Potter sat down next to her at the Gryffindor table, leaning against it to try and establish eye contact but to no avail “And who better to go with than the Hogwarts champion? We get to open the ball you know, the champions and their partners get their own dance, so it would be just us an-“ he was cut off from his rambling fantasies by the sound of  a book being slammed shut and Lily hastily making an exit. James quickly stood up to follow her.</p><p align="justify">“Evans where are you g-“</p><p align="justify">“Going alone would be sad would it?!” she turned on him, cutting him off once again and finally giving him the attention he had so desperately wanted.</p><p align="justify">“What’s <em>sad</em> is the fact that you have been asking me every day <em>for a month</em> to go with you to the ball,” she spat “and even though I have <em>repeatedly</em> said no you come back the next day as if overnight I’m going to have changed my mind about how insufferable you are!” they were starting to attract the attention of various onlookers now. James winced, but his charming grin didn’t falter.</p><p align="justify">“Same time tomorrow then?” James winked. Lily rolled her eyes, groaned loudly, and stormed off.</p><p align="justify">Lily mumbled profanities as she stomped hurriedly down the halls of Hogwarts School, carelessly shoving the books into her bag that she had quickly snatched from the table in an effort to spend as little time in the company of James Potter as possible.</p><p align="justify">“Such an arrogant, slimy little…” she wasn’t looking where she was going as she rounded the corner. The sudden presence of another human being made her jump back slightly as she managed to fit the last of her books into her satchel.</p><p align="justify">“P-professor!” Lily had found herself face to chest with Professor Slughorn. She raised her head and saw him beaming down at her, a twinkle in his eye that was familiar from the Hogwarts Potions Master.</p><p align="justify">“Ah, Lily! How fortunate, I was hoping I might run into you sooner or later,” he smiled warmly “I have something to show you in the potions room, do you have a minute?”</p><p align="justify">“I have quite a lot of time, actually,” she smiled, glad to have some place to go to avoid Potter, now that her study session in the great hall had been interrupted, much like her study session in the library had been the day before, and the one in the Gryffindor common room the day before that. Slughorn beckoned her and she followed suit.</p><p align="justify">It was a short walk to the potions room, which was empty of students as was usual for after classes on a Monday, however especially after classes on the last day of term. The small, dark room with short, stone walls was a contrast to the great hall, with its bright lights and tall ceilings. Over her seven years as a student of Hogwarts, Lily had learned how to feel at home in both, though at first each had seemed incredibly intimidating for very different reasons.</p><p align="justify">Slughorn walked over to the back of the room where his desk stood. Lily followed and waited patiently as he fumbled around for a moment, looking through several wooden drawers before pulling out an old, worn book. He came out from behind the desk and handed the book over to Lily, who perused its cover for about a second before noticing the author’s name.</p><p align="justify">“Is this… a potions book written by Gregory the Smarmy?” Lily’s eyes widened at the cover, and she glanced up to see Professor Slughorn smile a little.</p><p align="justify">“Well, yes and no,” he looked down slightly “it is likely a copy, of a copy, of a copy of a potions book written by Gregory the Smarmy,” he looked up again and smiled “but yes, in principle it is indeed a potions book written by Gregory the Smarmy,”</p><p align="justify">Lilly smiled excitedly as she careful turned through some of the pages.</p><p align="justify">“But where on earth did you find it? These recipes are almost a thousand years old, to find a copy of them must be <em>extremely</em> rare,”</p><p align="justify">Slughorn winked and tapped his nose, “I have a project for you for over the winter holiday, as I am assuming you are remaining here at the castle,” a lot of the older students were staying this year in order to attend the Yule Ball on Christmas eve, even some of the students who were too young to attend on their own were staying behind as dates to those in fourth year and above so for once it was almost expected that most of Hogwarts’s students would be remaining at the castle for Christmas. Lily’s smile faltered only slightly, she still didn’t know whether she wanted to stay behind or not; she had mixed feelings about attending the Yule Ball and hadn’t quite made up her mind about remaining at the castle for the break in order to attend.</p><p align="justify">“What was the project Professor?” Lily asked formally.</p><p align="justify">“Well, I was thinking it might be an idea to try some of these old recipes out, you know, as classes have wrapped up now and you have a little bit of free time,” his eyes shone, “I have not a clue what half of these recipes are, as you can see they are all hand written and a little bit hard to make out in places but I have transcribed some of them as best as I can,” Lily noticed some small pieces of parchment peeking out from between the book’s old pages.</p><p align="justify">“I wasn’t sure if I was going to stay here over Christmas professor,” Lily confessed, very aware of not wanting to let Professor Slughorn down.</p><p align="justify">“Oh?” Slughorn looked a bit surprised, “are you not staying for the Yule Ball?”</p><p align="justify">“No…Well maybe but-“ she sighed, Slughorn raised an eyebrow and tried to suppress a smile that was twitching at the corner of his mouth.</p><p align="justify">“Well Miss Evans, why not stay and take on my little project, no harm in that, hmm?” he let the smile spread over his face, and if Lily weren’t mistaken, it seemed knowing.</p><p align="justify">“I-“ she paused, her mind trying to come up with any reason she might have to avoid the castle over the holiday. She sighed as her attempts at finding an excuse came up short “Alright Professor, I will give these recipes a go.”</p><p align="justify">“Splendid!” Slughorn clapped his hands together “Let me know how you get on, I look forward to seeing your results!” his smile grew even wider as Lily waved and left the classroom.</p><p align="justify">As soon as her footsteps had faded down the hall, Slughorn took a sigh of relief and chuckled, thinking to himself.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Well, I’ve done my bit.</em>
