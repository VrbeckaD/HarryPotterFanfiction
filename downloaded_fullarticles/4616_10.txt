  <span>“Get down on your knees.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Zabini shot Ron a dirty glare, before doing it anyway. It really was the only way to reach the back of the shelf to clean it, and Ron was sick of hearing him moan about being unable to reach. The Potion storeroom floor was disgusting, and cleaning the room without magic was the worst detention he’d had so far. But at least he was cleaning higher shelves.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of all the reasons you could tell me to get on my knees, this is the most disappointing. I’d much rather hear you snap that at me for another reason,” Zabini muttered, looking at him over his shoulder with a dirty leer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron froze, his mind grinding to a halt. Did he mean… </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut your mouth, Zabini!” he snapped. His face was heating up, and he couldn’t stop himself from looking at the git’s mouth. Who said things like that? Out of nowhere? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merlin, he was thinking about it now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh? Like the sound of that, do you, Weasley?” Zabini said, raising an eyebrow at him, and turning away from the shelf. “Didn’t think you—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not!” Ron snapped, trying to calm down as Zabini shuffled closer on his knees. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why was that so damn arousing? He didn’t even like the git. But neither could he bring himself to say anything further as Zabini reached for the fastening of his trousers, looking openly interested, and disgustingly smug when he discovered Ron was already getting hard.</span>
