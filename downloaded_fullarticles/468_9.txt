    <p>To: Alice Lily Potter<br/>Hello, miss Potter. <br/>You are probably very confused about this letter. First, let me introduce myself. My name is Gray, I am a magician, student from the Clock Tower of London. <br/>If I am not mistaken, you should be in the second grade of Hogwarts. As you learned from your history class, we are not using the same magic as the witch and 200 years ago, the magicians had definitely stopped all contact from your world.<br/>But here am I, writing a letter to you.<br/>Itâ€™s actually about your parents, miss Potter. Hattori Megumi and Hattori Daichi.<br/>They were japanese.<br/>I think you should have a lot of questions from me. I cannot write all the informations in this piece of paper because of the enemy just near us, in our shadows. But I wanted to tell you that your parents did not abandoned you. They loved you, and that is why they had to give you to the Potter family.<br/>You have just turned 14, miss Potter. This is the limit of time. Beyond this age, the witch do not have any authority to you anymore, because you became a mage. <br/>You still have family. Two cousin and a uncle. But the only one that we can really contact is your first cousin, Hattori Chise.<br/>Please, if you are interested by your family, if you want to know more about yourself, write me an answer to this adress.<br/>Gray, apprentice of Lord el-melloi II, Waver Velvet.</p>
