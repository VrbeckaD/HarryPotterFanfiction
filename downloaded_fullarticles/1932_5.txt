    <p>It was late; perhaps too late to be shouting at the top of his lungs like this but he couldn’t seem to think straight.</p><p>Neville stormed through the house, his winter coat still heavy with snow, draped across one arm while he opened doors and made as much noise as possible.</p><p>Rage coursed through his veins and as much as he tried, nothing seemed to erase the horrifying images from springing up in his mind.</p><p>He gritted his teeth as he finally reached the bedroom and flung his cloak and other things onto an armchair near the fireplace. He turned to look at the bed. It was made; fluffed up well with cushions and warm blankets and clean pillows. It did nothing to lessen his anger, in fact it charged him up some more.</p><p>Footsteps, tentative as they were, followed him into the bedroom. He’d forgotten to bolt the door shut and lock it. Even though he knew that would be unfair to lock his husband out like that.</p><p>Neville realized he was breathing rather heavily; his ears were still ringing with the sounds of their loud arguments in the kitchen after he arrived. The fact that they argued was painful to him.</p><p>He expected his husband to deflate under his anger, he expected to be pacified with pleading grey eyes and yet –</p><p>Draco <em>fought</em> with him.</p><p>Neville whirled around to face him; his darling husband of two years. Where was the commitment now? Where was all the trust they had allegedly placed between them years ago? Why did he have to take this decision all on his own now?</p><p>Draco’s expression was drawn, his face paler than usual. His eyes didn’t reflect worry but rather anticipation.</p><p>It was breaking him from the inside. He’d vowed to wipe his every tear, and solve all his problems and yet –</p><p>He swallowed against the words wanting to jump out, instead choosing to question, “Why did you not tell me?”</p><p>Draco looked down and away, shaking his head. “It never came up. And then you went on that mission – “</p><p>Neville laughed humourlessly, “It’s always about my job, isn’t it?”</p><p>His husband narrowed his eyes, “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p>“Exactly what I’m implying. You’ve always had a problem with my job. If it wasn’t coming late then it was about me getting scrapes and cuts and what not.”</p><p>Suddenly, Draco bit out with a burst of emotion, “Of course you daft idiot. I love you and I care for you and I’m always going to worry about you.”</p><p>Then he reached out with his hands, placing warm palms against Neville’s cheeks. In any other moment of his life since he met Draco, he always loved when he did this. He’d revel in the sturdy warmth of his hands, the softness of his skin, the sound of his calming breaths as they leaned into each other.</p><p>But now they felt too heavy; shackling almost. Neville leaned down and placed his forehead against Draco’s and closed his eyes. He took a moment to breathe in his scent; the same scent that clung to their pillowcases, to the walls in their shower, to the clothes Neville wore to work.</p><p>He was going to miss it.</p><p>Trembling slightly, he raised his head and placed a soft, lingering kiss to his husband’s forehead. He ignored the small sigh of relief from Draco.</p><p>And then he excruciatingly pulled away from the comfort.</p><p>He didn’t look at Draco again, even as he felt hands on his face, arms and chest, urging him to come back.</p><p>“Neville?”</p><p>Neville walked the few steps towards the armchair where he’d dropped his things, hefting them onto his arm once again.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>He ignored Draco’s questions and turned to walk out of the bedroom, and towards the front door of their house. The warmest and homeliest place. Sometimes it felt warmer than Hogwarts, echoing with the sounds of Draco cooking while humming under his breath, with the sounds of Waldo slinking over the wooden floors to steal scraps from their kitchen table.</p><p>And he’d thought here would be the sounds of children playing but –</p><p>He quickly shut the door on that box of thoughts. That wasn’t going to happen anymore. Not now that he’d have to go.</p><p>“No, stop it. Where are you going? It’s too late at night right now and it’s storming out.”</p><p>Neville flung the front door open, a loud whoosh of air meeting him.</p><p>He turned to look back at Draco who was still stood in the hallway, eyes brimming with tears and a fearful expression.</p><p>“Don’t leave, please. I promise we’ll work this out and I’ll tell you everything – “</p><p>But Neville looked away, shaking his head, “I need to go now.”</p><p>“No you don’t. Come, Neville, please, darling come inside let’s have a chat about this at least – “</p><p>Once again he interrupted, “I need to be away from here right now, Draco.”</p><p>With that, Neville tore himself from the moment and walked out, when he heard a loud sob.</p><p>That stopped him dead in his tracks. In the years he’d known Draco he’d never seen him cry. He’d seen him grimace in pain when he broke his arm in the third year and he’d seen sullen expressions in the fifth year. Even at the Battle, he’d seen that face scrunch up in disgust at the sight of Voldemort.</p><p>But in all the years he’d spent getting to know him and eventually falling in love with him, Draco had never once cried. Let alone sobbed so openly.</p><p>Surprise made him turn around to face a red-faced Draco with tears running down his cheeks.</p><p>“You said –“ He started, hiccups making it difficult for him to talk.</p><p>Neville stood there stock still with a storm raging at his back.</p><p>Draco rubbed a hand down his face, wiping his tears frustratingly, “You said in your vows. You said that you’d never leave me.”</p><p>His tone was accusatory but his words were the cause of his heart breaking.</p><p>He rushed back into the house towards Draco and pulled him into a fierce hug.</p><p>Draco instantly buried his head into Neville’s chest and heaved long breaths, trying to control his emotions.</p><p>“<em>Never</em> – “ Neville started, his tone hard.</p><p>“Never assume <em>ever</em>, that I’m leaving you. I’m not leaving you. I still love you and I always will. Do you understand me?” He gently shook Draco by the arms as the two separated but still remained embraced.</p><p>Draco pursed his lips and nodded shakily.</p><p>Finally, Neville leaned down to press his lips against Draco’s trembling ones. Slowly, he coaxed the other’s mouth open and reveled in the feeling of their tongues entwined with one another. One last time, he promised himself.</p><p>For the last time, he took his time to kiss his husband.</p><p>Because this was the last time, for a very long time.</p><p>It took all that he had to shove himself away from Draco, ignoring his pleas and cries as he rushed down the steps into the cold dark and Apparated away.</p><p>Neville arrived on a lonely, dark street lined with dilapidated looking houses, grimy with the pollution in the air and rife with ugly graffiti. He sucked in a breath and looked around him. There were no lampposts on the street anywhere, making it easy for anyone coming to be concealed in the dark.</p><p>His chest was still heaving from holding all the pain in, the echoes of Draco’s pleas fresh on his mind. A newfound rage consumed him. He was going to kill whoever had caused him to forcefully leave the love of his life like this.</p><p>He would kill the person responsible. But for that he’d have to find out whom.</p><p>Neville looked up at the house directly in front of him. He knew everyone was waiting for him inside.</p><p>His mind decided, he finally stepped towards 12 Grimmauld Place, the new headquarters for the D.A. Faction of the New Order of Aurors.</p><p>***</p><p>It was a laughable concept at the time when Harry announced they’d be naming this new faction ‘D.A.’ thanks to him, Ron and Neville being on it. There were others on this faction too who had nothing to do with the time when Hogwarts students came together as Dumbledore’s Army to fight Umbridge and learn more about the Dark Arts.</p><p>But time went on, and with every successful mission of digging up hidden Death Eaters and sending them to Azkaban, the name stuck. Every other faction under the Order was calling them that, the few mysterious individuals no one knew, because their job was to be invisible and undetectable.</p><p>It was a difficult time for them all, once they realized that the War was never really over. The attack of October 1998 was forever etched into their memories.</p><p>Luna and Rolf were getting married in a beautiful ceremony near the Lovegoods’ house meadows. Neville wasn’t a fan of fancy robes but he’d donned a pair once Luna had batted her sweet, blue eyes at him and he’d caved very quickly.</p><p>He'd thought soon after the War had ended, that there was maybe something to explore with Luna. But they'd ended up one night in the Three Broomsticks, absolutely drunk on Firewhiskey. And there, Luna had admitted to him about her special 'pen pal' from America.</p><p>With dreamy-hazed ocean eyes, she'd whispered to him of his kindness, his appreciation of her love of quirky Magical Creatures, which Neville assumed was probably because he was Newt Scamander's grandson. She mentioned how he was in the process of moving to Britain to work for the Daily Prophet. When Neville had questioned her over the possible rivalry with the Quibbler she'd only smiled at him serenely.</p><p>"Neville," she'd hummed in her low voice, "when there is someone who makes you so happy you feel as if you could touch the very stars that reflect in their eyes, nothing else matters." Those words had taken his breath away; there was never anyone in his life to make him feel that way. But if Luna had found such a person, he'd support her no matter what.</p><p>So when he'd received news of their upcoming nuptials, he'd ignored his Grandmother's laments of <em>'when will you be finding someone and settling down'</em> and had ordered the first pair of fancy robes he could find at Diagon.</p><p>There was a slight breeze in the air that day; a perfect day for a perfect ceremony.</p><p>Almost their entire batch was present, but it was particularly lacking of any Slytherins.</p><p>But no one questioned it since so many of them were either incarcerated in Azkaban or had gone into hiding with their parents.</p><p>The first blow had felt like the ground was exploding. And then another one hit, and one after.</p><p>Soon, the earth around them was vibrating with the force of explosions and fireballs as spell after spell hit and revealed, a group of cloaked individuals, brandishing their wands at the wedding party.</p><p>Without much thinking, Neville, Harry, and Ron had shoved away from the group and chased the cloaked people, quickly engaging in a furious battle of spells.</p><p>Behind them, Ginny and Hermione gathered large crowds and rushed them back towards the Lovegoods’ house; many of the wedding guests had Apparated halfway through.</p><p>Curiously, the cloaked individuals were barely attacking. The trio of Auror Trainees would know;</p><p>Their Training Officers were harder on them than these pathetic idiots. All they used were lame Disarming spells and Protection spells with a couple of more harmful ones dotted in between.</p><p>But then it seemed to hit Neville in the middle of it.</p><p>Ron had thrown up a strong Protego Shield that covered them all and caused the cloaked individuals to stumble back a few steps.</p><p>Apparently, The Boy Who Lived wasn’t the only powerful Wizard there; during their Training it was revealed quite shockingly that Ron could cast a mile-wide Protego Shield and not bat an eyelid while doing it.</p><p>Neville quickly turned to Harry while the Shield did its work.</p><p>“They’re decoys, Harry, they <em>have</em> to be. They’re not fighting they’re defending!</p><p>Green eyes widened in understanding as Ron’s wand wavered in shock, dropping the Shield. But as the three of them faced their enemies once again, they were surprised to see the group had Apparated away.</p><p>Harry turned to them, grim expression on his face, “I think you’re right Neville. C’mon we need to report this to Kingsley right away.”</p><p>Ron was confused, “Kingsley? Bit far up, mate. Shouldn’t we start with Cahill, you know, our boss?”</p><p>The Weasley raised his eyebrows at his best friend who shook his head, “No, Ron. This wasn’t just some random attack. Neville’s right, something’s not adding up. C’mon let’s Floo him.”</p><p>The three rushed as quickly as possible to Luna’s house, which still had a scattering of traumatized wedding guests, near the edge of the lawn. Neville quickly stopped by Ginny tending to an old man who seemed shaken.</p><p>“Gin, do you know about Luna and Rolf, are they safe?”</p><p>Ginny smiled up at him, “Don’t worry, Rolf grabbed her and Apparated as soon as we heard the noise. I’ve just received a Patronus from them and they’re at their honeymooning venue. They’re fine, bit shaken up.”</p><p>He blew out a relieved breath, “I could do with a honeymooning getaway right about now.”</p><p>Despite everything, Ginny laughed, “Get married quickly then, you git. I’m still waiting to be your Maid of Honour.”</p><p>Neville shook his head teasingly, “Not how it works.” With a parting smile, he followed Harry and Ron to the small cottage and hurried up the steps.</p><p>***</p><p>That day had set off a series of events that led to the D.A. Faction being the uppermost in the chain for handling this new group of Dark Terrorists. They’d been bumped up to number one on their Most Wanted list due to their notoriety of crashing large-scale events hosted by prominent Ministry officials.</p><p>Kingsley was being pressured by the Ministry elites to do something about it and it didn’t take much to convince Harry, Ron and Neville to take the lead on the case.</p><p>Months later, they were chasing leads in a small village in Scotland, a few miles out from Hogwarts.</p><p>As far as Neville knew, the village was full of Muggles so weeding out Magicals wasn’t going to be too hard. <em>Hopefully</em>.</p><p>Little did he know, that mild afternoon in the village market would soon change his entire life. With the flash of a pair of grey eyes.</p>
