    <p>
  <span>The little garden around the cottage and the countryside beyond had been covered overnight with a blanket of invitingly soft-looking snow, that was what Harry noticed when he looked outside from their second-storey bedroom window that morning, bare feet planted on the somewhat chilly floorboards. He smiled in delight and then glanced back at the bed, at the rumpled sheets and the padded quilt and the stretched-out figure of the body lying underneath it all. He dove back under the covers with a grin.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco shrieked, startled awake from his almost-awake slumbering, he hated mornings, especially on the weekend. ‘Cold feet! What have I bloody said about cold feet, Potter?’</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry pressed a kiss where his lips landed, which happened to be a spot of skin just behind Draco’s ear, where he was ticklish and squirmed away, sleep-heavy hands pushing at Harry. ‘That I should wear socks?’ Harry offered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They scuffled a bit and Draco ended on top, looking down at Harry, all sleep-mussed and indignant in his striped pyjamas, the top button of which was now open, showing an inviting sliver of pale skin. He was shaking a finger at Harry. ‘You wretched man!’ But his eyes were laughing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry reached and Draco let himself be drawn down for a kiss that lingered and lingered on until they were breathless and no-one’s feet, or any other part for that matter, were at all cold any longer.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>‘Come out with me, it’s snowed in the night,’ Harry said after they’d kissed their fill and stoked lazy morning lust into flame.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco was curled against his side, his striped pyjamas gone and head resting on Harry’s shoulder, Harry’s arm around him. ‘But it’ll be cold! And we have not even had our breakfast yet!’ He burrowed deeper under the blankets. Their cottage might be picturesque and delightfully out of the way, but it did get a bit cold during the winter.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>‘Well, after breakfast,’ Harry amended, tapping a lazy rhythm on Draco’s shoulder, ‘it looks really nice.’</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>‘If you insist,’ Draco finally huffed, ‘but you’re making breakfast first, you hear?’</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>‘As if I wouldn’t.’</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>‘And no snow-balls!’</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>‘Spoil sport.’</span>
