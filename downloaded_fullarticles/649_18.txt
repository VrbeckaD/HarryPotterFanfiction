What was she doing here? With a sigh she took a sip from the tall glass and frowned at the colourful paper umbrella in her drink - she plucked it out and tossed it away with disgust.</p><p align="justify">Her eyes wandered over the heated, moving mass. Bodies swayed different rhythms, clashing to beat. She was fascinated by the patterns. It appeared like all the dancers heard something different than she did.</p><p align="justify">It was ten years after the war, and she was pushing thirty. Ten years in which she’d built herself up. She was successful, strong and independent. But most of all - alone. Men were afraid of her, they walked around her on eggshells, whispering and trembling at her ire.</p><p align="justify">What was she doing here?</p><p align="justify">Trying to recapture her lost youth, perhaps? Youth misspent on war and career instead of on pleasure and boys.</p><p align="justify">She wanted… No, she needed something--someone. She wasn’t looking for a relationship, just a body--the right kind of body to make her feel. She’d picked this place, a Muggle club, because it was one where her name and face meant nothing.</p><p align="justify">But she’d been wrong; the place bored her. The music was just a drum beat with an unending base pulse. Repeating in an infinite loop. And no one had caught her attention.</p><p align="justify">“Sod it all,” She stood, leaving her half finished, too-sweet drink and a bill next to it. She turned to walk away and that was the moment she saw—</p><p align="justify">
  <em> Him. </em>
</p><p align="justify">A beast among the sheep that covered the dance floor.</p><p align="justify">He wasn’t dancing. He was standing, back arrow-straight, lean arms crossed over a see-through shirt that stretched across lean, well-defined muscles. Slim legs snuggly clad in fitting and tastefully revealing trousers. His face was covered with black lace so intricate that she couldn’t help but admire its beauty.</p><p align="justify">He was thin as a whip and just as sharp.</p><p align="justify">Clad all in black.</p><p align="justify">Exposed, and yet she could have bumped into him on the street and not known him.</p><p align="justify">His dark eyes fixed on hers and she felt electricity running down her spine. His eyes, deep and dark, reminded her of another pair of eyes. Eyes she would never see again.</p><p align="justify">He grinned and she slowly took her seat again.</p><p align="justify">His eyes shifted to gaze behind her back and he raised his left arm, elegant long fingers signaling number two. Hermione nearly jumped when the barman placed a tall sweaty glass next to her and another in front of the empty seat to her right.</p><p align="justify">“On the house, Miss,” he explained before disappearing.</p><p align="justify">Blindly she took a sip. The bitter tang slid down her throat. She needed that drink, even if it was poison--she needed it to steel her nerves. She continued to watch him as he walked towards her.</p><p align="justify">His movements were fluid; it was like she watched a huge dangerous cat moving gracefully towards its prey. The dancing masses split to let him pass. She shivered and without looking, took another big gulp of her drink.</p><p align="justify">Only when he was close did she notice his short, raven black hair and his smirk. His features were now clear, but still unrecognizable--she wasn’t expecting to know him anyway. He was almost in her reach when all courage deserted her.</p><p align="justify">
  <em> What if he… Maybe he won’t like me? </em>
</p><p align="justify">She cast a quick glance down her body. The little black dress had seemed like a good choice at the time, but now she wondered if she was perhaps overdressed. She grabbed the glass again and took another gulp, then frowned; she was sure there should be less liquid in her glass.</p><p align="justify">A slight shift in the air forced her to raise her head.</p><p align="justify">Black eyes, glittering with mischief, greeted her, Hermione stopped breathing. He clucked his tongue and his fingers grazed hers when he took the glass from her hand. With a shadow of a smile tilting the corners of his lips, he drank, a long swallow sending the curve of his throat flexing.  </p><p align="justify">She noticed he wore a thin, snug neck corset. Black leather danced while he gulped the drink. She licked her lips. Placing the glass on the counter, he leaned towards her. She could smell him: a sharp, rich, spicy herbal scent.</p><p align="justify">He was so different from the men she usually found herself with, but Merlin help her, she wanted him. She didn’t want to know his name, actually--nothing about him. She wanted what she saw. Hermione was momentarily afraid that the stranger would talk and ruin her perfect fantasy.</p><p align="justify">Her fear was unfounded.</p><p align="justify">She couldn’t help it, she stared at him. His skin almost ghostly pale, a sharp contrast to his black clothing, his hair and eyes. Hermione couldn't quell her disappointment when he stepped back, but it was only to extende one long elegant hand. She accepted it without a second thought.</p><p align="justify">He wasn’t as tall as she’d first thought; she wasn’t all that tall and somehow they were same height. True, she had 3-inch heels on, but they didn’t add much. Walking backwards, he led her to the dance floor.</p><p align="justify"><em> Gods!!! </em> whimpered her brain.</p><p align="justify">He was so warm, his body radiating heat made of sharp angles and steel hard muscles. He moved like water, each motion liquid and powerful. She didn’t know how to dance to this music, but she didn’t need to. They swayed, same as everyone around them, in slow motion, sensually.</p><p align="justify">The drum beat echoed in her chest, so offbeat of their movements and yet... so right. She nuzzled her nose close to him, inhaling deeply. It was a bit disconcerting. She was slightly embarrassed by her own behaviour, but this sensation was the reason she’d come here.</p><p align="justify">
  <em> It is not like I’m going to see him ever again. </em>
</p><p align="justify">That thought returned her courage. Her hands glided over the slim torso and down his back, pausing for a fraction of a second before she bravely slid them to his behind. Her fingers curled around the firm swell of his buttocks, relishing in the flex of muscle.</p><p align="justify"><em> Merlin, he could crack nuts with his butt. </em> </p><p align="justify">Her dance partner didn’t seem to mind her liberties. His own fingers dug into her hips and pulled her closer. If closer was a possibility without melting them into one. It seemed possible after all. Their bodies undulated in a rhythm familiar only to them, and Hermione could feel heat rising--a deep, smouldering heat, threatening to choke her from inside.</p><p align="justify">Her pulse followed the drum beat, fusing them into one sound.</p><p align="justify">He swayed them, leading her, still dancing. She floated, in a low hum of excitement. Hermione had done her research about this club and the habits of those who came here.</p><p align="justify">Dance floor - they wanted to be seen.</p><p align="justify">Sitting at the bar - looking for someone.</p><p align="justify">Back hallway - …</p><p align="justify">Now, that was her aim, her hope, the one she’d deserted after only a few minutes spent here. And yet...now.</p><p align="justify">Now she was moving towards that back hallway with this stranger.</p><p align="justify">Now they were walking, his long-fingered hand holding her small one. All around them were couples, snogging the life out each other. That sobered her up, enough. The stranger seemed to sense it, or at least he was of the same mind. He pushed a panel in the wall and they were in another hallway, equally dimly lit, but free of others.</p><p align="justify">He turned to her and she leaned her back into the wall. Even through layers of brick, she could feel the drum-base beating. Hermione let out a shuddering breath. He stood silent, a breath away from her but not touching, not reaching.</p><p align="justify">
  <em> What is he waiting for? Permission - my permission! </em>
</p><p align="justify">With a low growl vibrating somewhere in the back of her throat, she reached for that flimsy lace shirt and pulled him to her. His lips latched to hers. The bitter tang of drink and mint-laced ice of assaulted her senses. She moaned and raised her hands to remove the lace from his face.</p><p align="justify">His lips moved away. His fingers gripped her hands. Slowly, he shook his head.</p><p align="justify">With a nod, she pulled him back against her, dragging her tongue against thin leather covering his neck. He groaned, tossing his head and exposed his neck to her. Tendrils of excitement zapped through her body, straight to her core--finding its target, if the wetness between her legs was anything to go by.     </p><p align="justify">This was so unwise, unsafe, so exciting. She needed this!</p><p align="justify">Sinking her teeth into the hollow of his throat, just beneath the leather choker, she elicited another groan, followed by a low hiss. His hands brushed over her breasts, the pressure firm but not unpleasant. His thumbs grazed over her peaked nipples.</p><p align="justify">It was an odd sensation--odd but not unwelcome. The silky material enhanced the pleasure. Rough wall scraping at her skin, exposed by the low cut back of her dress.</p><p align="justify">She hooked one leg around his hip, wobbling on the uneven stone floor, and he pressed in with his pelvis, grinding against her in a slow, maddening tempo.</p><p align="justify">It was nice; his skin tasted the same as he smelled--intoxicating. But she needed more. And she needed it now.</p><p align="justify">Only then did she remember that she’d left her purse--and its contents--on the counter, next to her drink. Living in the wizarding world didn’t need such aids, but here in the Muggle world Hermione didn’t want to take any chances. Pressing a kiss to the leather on his throat she allowed herself a frustrated groan. The prospect of losing the moment just so she could go and retrieve her purse wasn’t appealing to her in the slightest.</p><p align="justify">She could feel the pulse of his throat before she heard the chuckle. He backed away a space, just so, and gazed at her, fires flickering in his dark eyes, mixing with amusement. Without a word, his eyes guided hers to his hand. A piece of thin foil shimmered between his fingers.</p><p align="justify">“Yesssss, please. Now,” she whispered with relief.</p><p align="justify">Her hands were already fumbling with the button and the zipper of his fine woolen trousers. He unhooked her leg and she whimpered. His lips found hers again, while their hands worked in unison. She ripped the foil; he plucked the rubbery promise from inside of the foil.</p><p align="justify">Everything felt rushed and simultaneously too slow.</p><p align="justify">He bunched up her dress and hummed with approval. She’d come prepared, if one could call the lack of the undergarments such. His fingers danced briefly over her moist, covered labia and he smiled in a flash of expensive dentistry.</p><p align="justify">Pushing her back firmer against the wall, he helped to wrap her legs around his slim waist. Her nails dug into his shoulders. The feeling of him entering her was--different. The thin barrier took away some sensation, but not too much. Hermione whined at his slow pace. She could feel every inch stretching her, filling her, and she released a needy noise into his mouth. Her need was much greater, much hungrier than the slow-motion slide he provided. He chuckled again at her eagerness.</p><p align="justify">Once he was fully inside her, he stilled, shifting her into a better position. His lips traveled down her jaw and neck, nibbling on the juncture where neck met shoulder. She whimpered again, ready to beg if needed be.</p><p align="justify">There was no need.</p><p align="justify">As soon as he had a firm grip of her, his hips started to dance. The cadence of the beat in the sync with the drum-bass, alternating between harsh staccato and a steady, but tempered surge. She crossed her ankles in the small of his back, scraping him occasionally with her stilettos. He didn’t seem to mind. The same way he didn’t mind her sharp nails stabbed into his back, or her teeth fastened to his shoulder.</p><p align="justify">The wall bit too, into her back with each thrust. She relished that. Lost in the sensation, lost in the demand that steadily swelled in her body. The pressure whistled in her ears. His grunts and her sharp sighs filled the corridor.</p><p align="justify">Her brain tried to reason with her.</p><p align="justify">
  <em> I’m having sex with a stranger, in the hallway of a Muggle night club. </em>
</p><p align="justify">The thought wasn’t as nearly sobering as it should be, adding to the thrill instead of dampening it. Her hips surged to meet his. Hermione didn’t need this to last. She needed it to end, to end satisfactory for them both, and fast. Heat rose up, tightening her muscles, and forced its freedom out of her in a shrill, short shout. The sound mixed with his hiss.</p><p align="justify">They stayed like that, intertwined, for a few long moments, breathing heavily.</p><p align="justify">Finally she detangled her legs and he supported her, until she was stable on them. She smiled at him and busied herself lowering her wrinkled dress, and making herself presentable. When she was done, he looked the same as he had when she’d noticed him for the first time.</p><p align="justify">She kissed him once more, just a soft press of lips. He touched something and the wall slid open. She smiled again and he took her hand, pressing his lips to her fingers. Without another glance she walked out of their hiding place and the panel slid closed behind her.</p><p align="justify">Sporting a huge grin, Hermione walked towards her seat to take her purse. Somehow, she was sure it was still there waiting for her.</p><p align="justify">This was what she’d needed.</p><p align="center">~ S ~ S ~ S ~  </p><p align="justify">Leaning against the wall, he lit a thin, dark cigarette. The smell of mint filled the corridor. He inhaled a deep satisfied drag, watching a thin strip of bluish smoke spiral up. Suddenly he was shoved against the wall, face first, hands pinned above his head. His body pressed with a brawny mass that towered over him.</p><p align="justify">With a small pang of regret, he watched the cigarette roll across the floor. An involuntary shiver ran up his spine when he felt the rush of air and the harsh whisper in his ear.</p><p align="justify">“Does she know it was you?”</p><p align="justify">He shook his head; the grip loosened. He could feel the deep inhale behind him.</p><p align="justify">“Did you enjoy it?” Another whisper in his ear and a light nibble at his earlobe.</p><p align="justify">Twisting to face his attacker, he stared into pair of whiskey-coloured eyes with amber flecks. A sly smile danced on his thin lips.</p><p align="justify">“Did you?” he asked, his voice a bit rough.</p><p align="justify">“Lose it,” growled the attacker.</p><p align="justify">He flexed his shoulders and neck. Black hair spilled over his shoulders, falling all the way to his shoulder blades. His perfect smile was replaced with a row of imperfect teeth. The grip around his wrists tightened and he ground his behind against the enviable bulge his attacker had pressed to him. He shivered again, to a rumbling chuckle.</p><p align="justify">His companion released him. Now his back was against the wall again, eyes locked with the taller man’s. Rough hand grabbed his jaw; a thumb caressing his cheek. He leaned into the caress. The amber flakes in those eyes became bigger. One finger slid down his throat. He sighed, his black neck corset shimmering out of the existence.</p><p align="justify">“You are mine.” That was almost a growl. He smiled at the man.</p><p align="justify">“Shame, such an elegant glamour. So, did you?” he repeated the question.</p><p align="justify">“You did. I’m amenable to give you whatever pleasure you desire,” the man replied. He dragged the back of a finger against a veiled cheek “You have no idea how sexy you look now.” The finger caressed his lips and he caught it with his teeth, pulling it deeper into his mouth, gaze still locked on now almost completely amber eyes. The man moaned. “I want you.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m spent,” he chuckled, releasing the finger from his mouth. “But I can help, nonetheless.”</p><p align="justify">He pushed the taller and much brawnier man to the opposite wall and dropped to his knees, unzipping the fly on snugly fitting jeans. He loved this part, he loved to make him fall apart under his mouth. He pushed the jeans a bit lower, releasing a long, thick cock and smiled.</p><p align="justify">
  <em> A monster befitting a beast. </em>
</p><p align="justify">He dragged one nail down the length, watching the cock twitch. Gently pulling the foreskin down,  he licked the tip of the heavy head and then wrapped his lips around it. The man groaned, his hips making a miniscule motion.</p><p align="justify">He took as much as he could of the cock in his mouth. More than half, but he never could take it all, not without choking himself to death.</p><p align="justify">He bobbed his head, covering what he couldn’t take in his mouth with one hand, the other hand sneaking to pull on the heavy sack, rolling it occasionally. His partner was close; he knew it would be like that, that the sight of him with the girl would elicit a surge of jealousy and arouse his lover.</p><p align="justify">Groans, grunts, and sharp inhales became more frequent and he doubled his efforts. Soon he could feel a throb and pulsation as thick bitter liquid filled his mouth. He drank it, not stopping to move his hand or pull on the sac. The rough voice hissed his name.</p><p align="justify">“Severusssss.”</p><p align="justify">He nearly smiled, he would have were he not with this in his mouth. A hand sneaked into his hair and pulled him up. Firm lips pressed to his and he gave in with a moan.</p><p align="justify">
  <em> Yes. </em>
</p><p align="justify">When they stopped kissing, both of them were in presentable shape. They didn’t use magic often, but tonight was special. His partner lited two cigarettes and gave one to him. He inhaled a long drag and released smoke lazily.</p><p align="justify">“You haven't answered me, did <em> you </em> enjoy it?” Severus asked again.</p><p align="justify">“I wouldn’t mind a repeat of the scene,” replied his partner.</p><p align="justify">“Good. She will return, you are aware of that.” A devious smile curved his satisfied lips smugly.</p><p align="justify">“Shall we tell her?” asked the man and Severus glared at him.</p><p align="justify">“Remus, we are dead,” he replied sharply.</p><p align="justify">Remus just grinned at him and shook his head. “I do love being dead.”</p>
