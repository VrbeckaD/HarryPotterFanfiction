    <p>Draco had always loved the sea. With his eyes as gray as the waves and hair like sun through fog it had matched him - the cold northern waters provided a setting in which he moved naturally, camouflaged by the pale spray of the water and wholly at home with the weaving and swaying which suited him as both a sailor and a Slytherin. </p>
<p></p><div>
<p></p><div><p>The sea was untameable and vast, cold and strong and tempting. It was all that Draco aspired to be and all that had driven him away from his family's seat of power and their conniving machinations. Lucius had wanted a duplicate of himself in miniature; a perfect replica who behaved at family dinners and would marry and mate and keep the Malfoy name afloat. Narcissa desired a decorous doll, someone who could be wrapped in velvet and silk and displayed to courts and competitors as a point of pride.</p></div><div><p>Both of them had been disappointed in their only son.</p></div><div><p>Draco was wilder than his parents, named for dragons they shouldn't have been surprised when he roared and sparked and struggled against their constraints.</p></div><div><p>The final straw for their strained relationship had been pledging Draco's allegiance to the Dark Lord without affirming that Draco would agree. He had suffered through the end of the war, quiet only to keep his parents safe, and as soon as Potter had dispatched the threat Draco had run to the rushing waves.</p></div><div><p>The danger and tension of the war had sapped Narcissa's delicate strength and she died not long after Draco left. Lucius had called his son home to berate him through the funeral. As a last resort the elder had tried to chain him below Malfoy Manor, trapping him as Voldemort had done, to beat the insolence out of his heir. Draco had emerged scarred but stronger, and had abandoned his home and his name, leaving Lucius to wallow in the weight of his mistakes.</p></div><div><p>So instead of returning to Hogwarts for an eighth year like so many of the other students Draco left for the siren call of the sea and took to the ocean like an otter. He started as a lowly crewman on a merchant ship but in a few short years was the captain of his own vessel, a small but swift craft that was welcome in every port but feared on the open ocean. Among muggle sailors the Imperator had a reputation for devilish luck and heartless cunning; frequently she was a simple freighter, carrying goods that had to arrive fast for customers who were willing to pay. And when there weren't any customers willing to pay, well, the gold kept coming and the less that was said about that the better.</p></div><div><p>Draco was happy - happier than he ever would have expected to be living among muggles and doing manual labor and feeling his face stiffen with salt. He was free. And that was what mattered.</p></div><div><p>Then one day he returned to the house of his father, intent on liberating a book of spells he had left behind many years ago. Instead of a spellbook he found a Weasley and his world changed forever.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>***</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>The sun was red and low on the horizon as Draco and his crew prepared  for a dinner on the deck. Fred passed behind him holding a cauldron and clapped him companionably on the shoulder before levitating the kettle over the side and into Ron's reach. Ron hauled a flounder up out of the water and into the pot, muscles honed from long days of swimming glittering in the sunset that so complimented his red hair and copper scales.</p></div><div><p>"Do we have any lemons left," Hermione asked as she examined the flopping fish and put it out of its misery with a neat wave of her wand.</p></div><div><p>"Of course," Neville said, opening a cupboard behind the wheel to reveal a miniature tree, no taller than a pixie, spotted with tiny ripe lemons. He plucked two and enlarged them in his hand, passing them to Hermione, who gave him an absent peck on the cheek as she continued her wandwork, skinning and deboning the fish in midair, pulling vegetables out of a basket and zesting the lemons over the cauldron.</p></div><div><p>Neville left her to it and conjured a table as Ron was finishing his difficult climb onto the deck. "A little help," he called, as he flopped into one of the narrow shore boats that rested just inside the railing. Draco walked to his side and cast aguamenti, rapidly filling the small vessel with fresh water. Ron sighed, relieved to have water to support the massive weight of his tail on the deck.</p></div><div><p>It was all pleasant bustle and preparation. The twins bounced plates and spoons around in a merry dance that filled the air with a pleasant, clinking music. Hermione and Neville put their heads together over the cauldron, adding herbs and cream and broth while the pot floated over the deck and warmed on one of the tiny, blistering, blue fires that Hermione produced so readily.</p></div><div><p>Draco stepped back from the action and leaned against Ron's dinghy, enjoying the sight of his busy crew but glad to be out of the jostling elbows and cavorting flatware. Ron folded his arms on the ledge of the boat next to where Draco sat and rested his chin on his hands. He tilted his head to the side so it was just brushing Draco's arm. Taking the hint Draco lifted his hand to caress Ron's back, his fingers sliding from the cool water back to sun-warmed skin in a soothing interplay.</p></div><div><p>"Where's Harry," Ron asked. Draco flicked his eyes up to the top of the center mast.</p></div><div><p>"Where's Charlie," Ron asked again, with a grin this time, and Draco's eyes once more lifted heavenwards and he grinned a bit too.</p></div><div><p>"Oi, lovebirds," Ron shouted, "It may be called a crow's nest but you're not supposed to roost there! Come down, dinner's almost ready!"</p></div><div><p>Potter's messy head looked over the edge of the little observation platform. "Yeah," he called back "and knowing you there'll be none left for anyone who's half a minute late."</p></div><div><p>"I've been swimming all day," Ron replied, "after all some of us have to work for a living!"</p></div><div><p>Harry laughed and swung over the edge of the crow's nest, quickly finding purchase in the rigging. Charlie followed shortly after, his face glowing a lovely shade of pink when his feet hit the deck. Before Ron and the twins could start in on ribbing him Hermione nodded at her cauldron and levitated it toward the table.</p></div></div><div>
  <p>As the crew crowded around the table Draco hung back with Ron. He watched Ron's friends and siblings laugh and dish out stew for one another with a wistful eye. He felt Ron's hand close around his wrist and squeeze gently. He squeezed back and went to the table to serve up a plate for himself and Ron.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione's stew was wonderful and he told her so; eating heartily and seeing Ron pretend to do the same out of the corner of his eye. The sun set as the clatter around the table ebbed and flowed. The incomprehensible clan of gryffindors Draco had found himself surrounded by seemed to speak a language he barely understood and told stories about homes and families he couldn't imagine. Only Potter seemed to share Draco's silence when cozy remembrances of bedtime stories and hot cocoa by the fire are raised - then he'll exchange a still and knowing kind of eye contact across the deck; but it's fleeting - soon the stories will shift to teen years and pranks and Potter is back in the mix. He may have been orphaned at one point but the Weasleys had long been his family.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>At some point during the retelling of another family legend (thoughtfully animated by Fred and George in glowing airborne lines) Ron had slipped overboard and fallen soundlessly into the sea. Draco waited a few minutes after he noticed the missing redhead before charming their plates clean and bidding his crew goodnight.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>His cabin took the breadth of the stern and was oriented around a single wide window that gave Draco a panoramic view of the ocean whenever he needed it. He opened the central pane and tossed down a ladder, throwing himself after it and climbing into the night.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>***</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>In the dark, silent waters beneath the Imperator Ron dove. His tail thrashed steadily, his eyes narrowed to slits. He reached ahead of himself with his hands, smoothing his profile and making a lethal missile of his own flesh. He sensed movement near him in the water - below and to the right, and spun quick as lighting. He had the struggling fish in his hand before he even realized he'd made the decision to change his course.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He swam slowly to the surface, looking up to the dim glow of lanterns above the water. Over and over he lifted the fish to his mouth and tore away great hunks of it, clouding the water with cold blood. The few bites he'd taken of Hermione's cooking sat like coiled poison in his belly and he chased them away with the cleansing taste of salt and iron.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He scrubbed scales away from his cheeks and picked them carefully out of his teeth before gliding around the ship in a lazy circle, full and satisfied. When he heard the splash of a heavy rope hitting the water he ducked and headed aft.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco's hair blazed like the sun, lit from behind by the tremendous window of the Captain's cabin. He was seated on a broad plank that hung from the stern window, a swing that sat low enough to let him dangle his feet in the water.</p>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>***</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco had always loved the sea but now he knew it better. He knew the way the smell of salt changed when it was being carried on skin instead of the breeze, he knew the sound of the ocean's surface parting almost silently as a hand reached out of the water. Ron hauled at the rope beside the swing, drawing himself up like a pail from a well and spilling himself on the swing next to Draco.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You're cold," Draco said as he pulled Ron against himself, unmindful of the water streaming from the smooth skin into his dry shirt.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You're warm," Ron said with a smile, lowering his mouth to Draco's throat and licking at the pulse point. "You're always warm," he whispered, feeling the heat increase against his lips as he sucked and bit and drew blood to the surface of the skin. Draco produced an incoherent little sound and his warm arms were around Ron's shoulders, one hand tugging at his hair and tipping his head back so Draco could kiss him harder, tongue sweet and hungry.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco cast his mind back to the first time he had seen Ron after Hogwarts. He remembered the frail arms and deep bruises and mottled skin of a rawboned youth in an absurd globe of glass, trapped in greening water and tortured by his father. He had twitched fitfully in his sleep, and upon waking had cringed away from the sight of Draco's white-blonde hair.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>The look of revulsion on Ron's face and the futile retreat had sickened Draco, and he had only been slightly surprised to find that he valued Ron's life more than Lucius's. It was easy, after that, to find the Weasleys, ally himself to them, and aid in the utter destruction of his father.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Watching Ron heal had been harder. It took months for him to build the stamina to swim more than an hour or so at a time, and some of the scars would never fade.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>There was, of course, the impassable gulf between them. Draco could dive into deep waters and hold his lover but he couldn't follow him through the waves. Ron could climb on deck and rest in shallow water but he couldn't stay for long before the weight of his own body became unbearable.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>And Ron was heartbroken over the loss of his magic. Draco could see it wearing on him more every day and didn't know what could be done to help or how long it would take for the presence of magic, the casual ease with which Hermione levitated a cauldron or Bill spelled a mend in a sail, to push Ron away completely.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>But for now his arms were around his lover, his mouth full of the taste of him. They had each other and the dark night and the cold ocean, and for the moment that would have to be enough.</p>
</div>
