    <p>Trailing behind her wife, Fendra watched with a growing smile while Anise investigated every nook and cranny of their home. Her lover always had an air of childlike excitement at times like these, and Fen couldn't help but share in the glee. It seemed to overspill from the boundaries of the little woman's body, permeating everyone nearby like some strange and beautiful magic. It was part of the reason the stolid witch still paid any attention to such holidays, always taking the opportunity to give Anise something to smile about. </p><p>    Still, impatience slowly crept in. As much as Fendra enjoyed letting Anise relive the traditions her Muggle-born bride had grown up with, she couldn't help but want things to hurry along as the search started into its second circuit of the house. There were other activities she looked forward to even more. The sort she enjoyed sharing with Ann for the sake of the pleasures they brought both of them, instead of only the one. </p><p>    Just about to step in to give Anise a hint, she was surprised when the shorter woman turned back and smirked at her, a catlike expression of satisfaction framed between her sweeping bangs.</p><p>    "So you DID stuff the basket with something naughty!" Looking up at Fendra with validated delight, Anise stepped close and prodded a finger accusingly against the taller woman's chest. "You only shift your feet like that when you're getting ready to jump my bones. I can't believe you'd expect me to just blindly fall for something like that, especially after what you pulled last year!"</p><p>    Caught out unexpectedly by Ann's insight, Fen's mouth fell open, innocent facade cracking for a moment as she stammered.</p><p>    "I-I didn't... I mean... You enjoyed..." Cutting off and taking a breath, she composed herself. "Since last year went so well, I thought I might try something similar." She considered Ann for a moment, the other witch staring back with hands upon hips. Fen hesitated before venturing a guess of her own. "I take it, then, that you already know where the basket is?" Her tone was tentative, looking to avoid further insult.</p><p>    Rolling her eyes by way of answer, Anise stuck out her hand. </p><p>    "Wand," she ordered. "Now." Her fingers beckoned once, insistent.</p><p>    Sighing, Fendra slipped the requested item from her sleeve. Tapering gradually from its thick handle to a thinner tip, the 14 inch rod of white elm contained a single unicorn hair at its core. It was the only wand Fen had ever used, and she prized it more than anything else she'd ever owned. </p><p>    Putting it in her wife's waiting palm, she felt a strange giddy glow from within her belly, the display of deference more for her than she'd ever have expected in her earlier life. While her family hadn't been pure-blooded, they'd still looked down somewhat on the Muggle-born, and that attitude had been strengthened during her school years in Slytherin house. </p><p>    Giving up her wand for any reason had always made her feel humiliated, naked, and vulnerable all at once. To be giving it over to one such as her wife made the emotions even more potent, though she'd long overcome her conscious prejudices. Her maturity mingled with the nature of their relationship transmuted the shameful feelings into a guilty pleasure, deliberately making herself submissive to her lover by surrendering the symbol and instrument of her power as a witch.</p><p>    "Thank you," Anise said sweetly, aware of all that was going on in her lover's heart and mind. She'd always been the more insightful of the two, making her first overtures towards the stoic Slytherin during their final year of school. Stepping out of the scholarly social circles most Ravenclaws kept to, she'd made a move that few in the school could have ever expected to bear fruit. Yet Fendra had been ripe for the plucking. Years of casual observation and consideration had lead up to that first pass, the keen emotional intelligence behind Ann's amber eyes reaching the correct conclusion long before her heart and loins provided the impetus to act on what she'd deduced. </p><p>    Immediately tucking the wand away alongside her own, Ann enjoyed the pleasant contrast the long pale shape made against her dark little tool of ebony and heartstring. It felt to her to be a deeper reflection of the ways they were so distinct from one another, yet so compatible. Fendra was tall where she was short, skin olive while hers was creamy, hair straight where hers was kinky and black while hers was red. To look at they seemed nothing alike, as distinct as two people could be. Even their personalities were dissimilar, mismatched in temperament and interests.</p><p>    Anise reached out her hand, and Fendra took it. Despite their differences, the pair of women moved together in a harmony of understanding, their dissimilarities fitting against one another like two pieces to a puzzle. Their teasing words and domination games were mere ripples across a deep well of love, a bond between them that was deep and more magical than anything either could create with a wand. They knew each other's excitement, and together reveled in it. </p><p>    Leading Fendra through their home to where she'd spotted the basket on her first search, Ann now hurried to see what delight her lover had prepared. Ostensibly done to keep her from springing whatever trap there might be, in truth the ritual of taking away her wife's wand had been done to heighten Fen's enjoyment of whatever was to come. The quiet witch always had more fun when she felt like Anise was in control, though she tried so often to accomplish the opposite. </p><p>    Coming to a sudden halt in their kitchen, the couple looked upwards, heartbeats quickening in tandem. There atop the ancient fridge were several cereal boxes arranged into a makeshift wall, partially obscuring the shape of a large Easter basket behind it. Only the wicker handle was left visible, though the presence and size of the rest could easily be inferred by the placement of the boxes around it. </p><p>    Glancing back at Fen, Anise flicked her eyes toward the hiding place. It was too high up for her to reach, which made her doubt that there was any booby trap ready to spring on whoever touched it. Not exactly like last year, then. Reinforcing this conclusion by retrieving it without hesitation, Fendra shuffled aside the boxes, obediently bringing the huge woven basket down for Ann's inspection.</p><p>    As was typical, the basket was loaded with all sorts of treats both magical and mundane. Stocked to satisfy the tastes of each woman, one half was dedicated to Muggle candies, Fendra making an effort to gather the Reese's, Kit-Kats, and Rolos that she knew were Ann's favorites. The other half held Fizzing Whizzbees, Every-Flavor Beans, Chocolate Cauldrons, and other sweets from the wizarding world. </p><p>    Most interesting of all, three unfamiliar packages sat centered in the nest of smaller candies. Three were of equal size to each other, big enough to comfortably contain a loaf of bread apiece. These rattled curiously as their contents shifted and stirred, reacting to the movement of the basket. Approaching with caution, Anise read the name inscribed in flowing gold letters upon each.</p><p>    "Lady Lasivi's Erotic Eatery?" Raising her eyebrows, she looked to Fendra. "Why're they moving?" </p><p>    Biting her lip, Fendra shifted her feet again, then shook her head at the question.</p><p>    "I'll promise it's not a trap, but I don't want spoil the surprise beyond that. You can open one up and see."</p><p>    Ann felt the fine hairs along her arms rising in anticipation, part of her wanting to do as Fen suggested and let the consequences come as they may. Picking one up, she felt the weight within it shift with an independent will, reminding her of how it might feel to pick up a cardboard box with a cat inside. Putting it down on the table, she licked her lips. A sudden craving for sugar had come over her, though she was unsure whether it was an effect of some magic or simply due to the scent of so much chocolate.</p><p>    "Can I eat it?" Given the name on the box, it seemed an question with only one possible answer. Still, she wanted to be sure before opening it up.</p><p>    "Take it out and ask it," Fendra suggested. The same patient smile from earlier had found its way back onto her lips, loving to watch her wife puzzle over something.</p><p>    Licking her lips yet again, Anise felt increasingly sure her desire for candy was nothing natural, something in the box calling to her sweet tooth. Unable to hold back any longer, she popped the lid open, gazing down to what was contained within.</p><p>    Laid upon a bedding of candy grass, a living chocolate bunny blinked glossy black eyes at her. </p><p>    Mostly humanoid, its little body was shaped with exaggerated feminine curves, human limbs ending in stubby paws and head sporting a pair of long floppy ears. The delicious brown tones of its flesh varied subtly, darker at the large puffy nipples and genitalia. There were two sets of the latter, the pussy a small hole carved out of the smooth chocolate just behind a pair of testicles and stiff, twitching shaft. These last two were far out of proportion to the rest of the bunny, which was approximately the same size of the animal to which it bore token resemblance. Ann was far from an expert, but to her the candy cock seemed nearly as big as an adult human's.</p><p>    Only after she had spent a solid minute coming to terms what she saw did Anise realize the bunny was bound, hands and feet tied by little silken ribbons. The tiny carrot stuffed in its mouth wasn't for decoration, but to keep the candy creature gagged. </p><p>    Glancing over at Fendra'd grinning face, Anise gently pried the carrot out of the chocolate bunny's lips, leaving the rest of the restraints in place for the time being. Recalling her wife's suggestion, she addressed the tiny hermaphrodite.</p><p>    "Can I eat you?" It was a bizarre thing to ask, but this was a bizarre situation. Magic never failed to surprise her, even after all the years she'd been exposed to it. Most surprisingly of all, she found herself wanting a certain answer, the candy craving grown almost unbearably intense now that she could see the bunny's chocolate flesh.</p><p>    "Eat me!" The bunny's voice was squeaky, but eager with affirmation. "Fuck me! Eat me! Fuck me, eat me!" It wriggled, trying to entice her with its pillowy chest and bobbing cock. She was amazed by how soft its body looked, mouth watering as she imagined the chocolate flesh on her tongue.</p><p>    Hands touched her, Fendra pressing close. Anise realized she was frozen, panting softly with strange, mixed desires. She was suddenly soaking between her thighs, openly drooling as she stared at the bunny's breasts. Her wife's olive fingers reached out, freeing the creature from its bonds while Anise watched. It squirmed and stood, half-lapine face smiling cutely up at the pair. </p><p>    "Eat me?" It ran a chocolate paw along its shaft, looking plaintive as it begged. Something white began to bead at the tip of the creature's cockhead while it stroked, a chocolate drizzle leaking from its pussy and onto the table below. </p><p>    It was more than Anise could take. Her strange hunger finally winning over her lack of understanding, she grabbed the creature and brought it to her mouth, its giddy expression flashing in her awareness before she tasted the perfect silky sweetness of its skin. The bunny moaning while she licked and nursed, Ann sucked one of its breasts into her mouth, the candy flesh softer than she'd imagined as it pressed against her tongue. Something liquid and potently magical leaked from its nipple, addictively sweet milk oozing down Ann's throat. Feeling hungrier and hornier with every gulp, she swallowed it greedily.</p><p>    Though its squirming grew slowly weaker during her nursing, the little rabbit continued to repeat its mantra, sounding increasingly happy and pleasured. The pleading murmurs cut through all other thoughts, replacing Anise's brilliant mind with purely carnal motivations. Hunger had been partially sated, but the tingling need between her legs cried out in an ever louder voice. Eventually it was insistent enough even to overcome her desire to drink more and more of the rabbit's cream, her lips popping off the chocolate breast, tongue darting out to collect the last of the sweet, viscous milk.</p><p>    "Fuck me," the rabbit moaned, touching itself with its stubby limbs. The amount of white liquid leaking from its breast had increased greatly, oozing thickly across its chest. Despite being made of chocolate, there was barely any evidence of melting from its time spent in the heat of Ann's mouth. Only the opening at the tip of its darker nipple had changed, visibly wider compared to the other. Whimpering, it milked itself, sending little gouts of its cream across the kitchen table while Anise panted and pulled down her panties. The enraptured witch barely noticed the hands pulling off the rest of her clothes, her wife's loving touch helping her enjoy herself even when Fendra was practically forgotten.</p><p>    Pulling the bunny's cock towards her, Ann's saliva dripped off her lower lip and down onto bare breasts, grunting in a sound of animal pleasure when it thrust itself into her. Watching it shudder and buck, her whole body thrummed with a need to be touched while it humped her squeezing slit. Olive fingers helped by spreading her own saliva across her chest, the sound of her own shameless moans and rapid heartbeat the only things she could hear besides the creature's insistent command.</p><p>    "Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck... fuck... eat... eeeeeeE!" The brown little body quivered, clumsy paws squishing a fountain of milk from its chest while its hips rose and shoved all of its length into Anise's slit. She felt an outpouring of thick, hot liquid inside her, the bunny squeaking as it unloaded. She rode it through the climax, still needing more, hungry for her own release.</p><p>    Falling slack beneath her, the rabbit's plump chest heaved, a silly smile decorating the lapine features. Its shaft slid free, leaking copiously from the tip in a manner similar to its lactating breast. Anise stared at it, legs quivering. A tongue was in her pussy, scooping out the sugary load that had been deposited inside. It felt so good she could barely stand, yet she couldn't look away from the rabbit's cock. It called to her, pulses of its white ooze leaking out in time to her heartbeat.</p><p>    "Eat me," the rabbit urged. It seemed lethargic, yet no less lustful. "Eat me."</p><p>    Her hands scooped up the magical candy, bringing it up to her mouth in a rush of hunger. Its shaft popped into her mouth of its own accord, pushed forward eagerly, ready for what came next. </p><p>    Anise's teeth closed sharply, biting off the chocolate cock. She chewed it, the magical properties that had kept it from melting suddenly no longer in effect. It was delicious. Better than Reese's. Better than Rolos. Better than any wizard chocolate she'd ever had. Best of all was the filling, the viscous core of goopy cream that was the creature's milk and cum, the essence that it had pumped her full of. Gouts of it now poured into her mouth from the hole in its castrated crotch. She greedily sucked more from the opening, the rabbit in a paroxysm of ecstasy as it encouraged her, not seeming to mind the mutilation at all. Between her thighs her wife extracted Ann's own creamy filling, tongue working deep to get every precious drop.</p><p>    She came while sliding the rabbit down her throat, eating it in huge bites from toes to the tips of its ears. It coaxed her on until its last utterance, compelling her to keep eating it even as she whimpered and shook with climax. Only when the last swallow of its sweet inner liquid trickled down her throat did the chocolate bunny finally fall still, its head crunched between her teeth before disappearing into her belly.</p><p>    Simple as that, she was back to her senses. Anise blinked, feeling shuddery and weak, surprised to find herself on her knees. Face buried between her thighs, Fendra laid across the kitchen tiles, the both of them now utterly nude. Dazed, Ann ran hands over her own body, realizing she was covered in drool, sweat, and sticky sweet cream. Licking her chocolate coated lips, she touched her belly, faintly concerned by what had just happened.</p><p>    "What did I..." She stopped, realizing she knew perfectly well what she'd just done, and how much she'd enjoyed it. A different question was far more pressing. "Why did I do that?"</p><p>    Fendra scooted forward a slight amount, eyes bright with excitement as they looked up at Anise from between her legs. Smiling with a mouthful of cream, she swallowed before answering.</p><p>    "Siren's milk, and mandrake sugar. Some sort of lust potion, too." Licking a stray smear of white off her wife's thigh, the taller woman giggled, her normally reserved attitude melting like the chocolate in Ann's belly. "Plus who knows what else. Lady Lasivi keeps her recipes secret, after all. Definitely those three ingredients, though. They make up the cream that animates the chocolate, that makes you want to do what it wants."</p><p>    "But..." Ann started, a dozen different questions dying on her lips as she took a moment to recover her wits. Fendra returned to her task, licking out the last of the bunny's load while Ann made soft sounds of enjoyment.</p><p>    Eventually a coherent query formed itself in the redhead's awareness, slipping out before she could even form a hypothesis.</p><p>    "Why did it want... that?" </p><p>    Sliding out from between Anise's legs, Fendra stood and helped the other witch to her feet, faintly amused by her lover's perplexed expression.</p><p>    "Because it knew it was made for that purpose, and was happy to fulfill it. More than that, it was enchanted to feel amazing pleasure from letting out its filling. For the bunny, you biting off its member was even better than getting to cum. The faster its cream was let out, the greater ecstasy it felt." Reaching into the Easter basket, Fen retrieved another box, casually flipping it open and undoing the binds of a second, identical chocolate rabbit. "Here. Let me show you my favorite way to eat them."</p><p>    Anise felt a flare of the same dual desire as the new bunny was lifted in Fendra's arms, understanding now that this was a magical effect of the siren's milk comprising its inner cream. Clearly experiencing the same response, her wife cradled the candy creature against her chest, stomach grumbling and eyes glowing with lust. It rubbed itself against the olive skin of Fen's cleavage, speaking up while the tall woman started to massage its brown breasts.</p><p>    "Eat me! Eat m-" </p><p>    Before it could even finish its second exclamation, Fen's mouth encompassed its head. A soft crunch sounded as she bit down, decapitating it without hesitation. Ann gasped softly, one hand going to her mouth, the other touching between her legs as she experienced a sudden pulse of arousal. Chewing with obvious enjoyment, Fendra kept the bunny's body close, seeming to anticipate what came next. </p><p>    Hips twitching madly and paws scrabbling at her skin, the headless rabbit began to squirt cream in great gouts from its nipples and cock. Despite the violence that had triggered the outpouring, the reaction was so obviously an orgasm that Ann felt her cheeks start to heat as she watched, only able to imagine how good she'd have to feel to flail and quake in the way that the remainder of the rabbit was currently doing. Rapidly pumping its entire of capacity of cream out of its breasts and crotch, the bunny painted Fendra's front white in a bukakke of sugar. Thick frosting-like liquid spread across her skin, dripping off her nipples and highlighting the subtle curves of her belly. Smiling at her wife, Fendra made sure to give Ann an eyeful, displaying her candy-coated body as the bunny drained itself of every last drop.</p><p>    The chocolate shell fell still with a final squirt of its payload, Fen opening her mouth to catch it directly on her tongue. Swallowing with relish, she casually dropped the remains onto the table, the suddenly stiff limbs cracking and breaking from the impact like any mundane chocolate might.</p><p>    "Care to help me clean up?" Fen asked casually. Her hand lifted one breast, tongue extending to lick the cream from a swathe of the skin. Anise experienced a moment's jealousy, as she always did when reminded of the extra opportunities Fendra enjoyed due to her larger bust. This emotion was soon gone however, smothered as she noticed her lover's dark brown nipples stiffen beneath their coating of cream.</p><p>    Abandoning her reservations and questions for a while, Ann allowed herself to enjoy the moment for what it was. For a lovely stretch of time she and Fen were of a single mind, each lapping up sweet cream from olive skin. Her fingers pushed into Fen's pussy, feeling the soaking wetness there, touching and stroking in ways that made the taller woman have to pause and gasp before cleaning herself further. </p><p>    Soon every inch of Fendra's chest that had been coated in white glistened instead with a sheen of saliva. Ann's own drool-coated breasts slid and pressed against her lover's equally messy bust, two pairs of hard nipples poking each other's soft flesh, mouths melding and sharing the sugary sweetness lingering on their tongues.</p><p>    "We still have one more," Ann suggested, slipping the comment in while Fen broke away for breath.</p><p>    "Let's do it together," Fen agreed, lips moving against Anise's mouth long minutes later.</p><p>    It was some time more before they were able to pull away from each other, withholding from present pleasures for a more unique indulgence. Fendra fetched the last chocolate rabbit, untying it slowly as if to tease the chocolate creature. For its part the bunny seemed even more eager than its predecessors, its identical pleas muffled by the gag still stuffed in its mouth. Anise watched it buck and strain, wanting so much to be free so it could be fucked and devoured. An familiar urge took her then, staring at its tiny chocolate slit. It was a compulsion at odds with her gender, a desire to stick herself into that hole and plow the tiny creature until it split, to give it what it so sweetly begged for.</p><p>    Fendra's attention went to her wife as soon as Anise reached for her wand, the redhead's eyes full of a hunger Fen had seen a few times before. Ann had always had a particular talent for Transfiguration, and it hadn't been long into their relationship before such magic had found its way into their bedroom. They each preferred the female form quite exclusively, but there were times when the equipment one was born with simply did not suit the task. Though Fendra had never had a man as lover, she knew intimately the feel of a living cock, flexing and filling her inside in a way unlike anything else. Most often it was Anise's cock. Her own, once or twice. </p><p>    So when Ann pointed the darkwood wand down at the peak of her own pubic mound, Fendra knew what to expect. In a moment she understood her wife's intention, her own anticipation rising to meet her lover's desire. Almost she mouthed the words of the spell along with Anise, holding the bunny down for what was coming its way.</p><p>    "<i>Phalleus Malleus</i>"</p><p>    Stabbing the tip of her wand into her flesh, Anise moaned as it was cleanly swallowed by her skin. The stuff of her body seemed to stick to the black wood as she slowly pulled outward from herself, skin clinging and stretching like taffy wrapped around the rod. Twisting, pushing, and angling her tool in minute ways as she continued to coax her own flesh into a new protrusion, she expertly stretched and shaped the growing pillar into a phallic shaft. Its head acquired the proper color, soft delicate veins showing along the length. While she put on the finishing touches it even began to twitch and throb to the beat of her heart, looking for all the world as if it were a natural part of her anatomy.</p><p>    Pulling her wand free of what was now her cock's urethra, Ann bit her lip as a jet of precum followed the rod's exit, looking all too eager to use her new toy. Seeming unperturbed by this skillful display of magic, the bunny spread its legs, a puddle of chocolate pussy juice forming around its asscheeks. Once Fendra pulled free its gag, it immediately began to plea to be used for its only two purposes in life.</p><p>    "Fuck me! Eat me!" Its legs quivered as it held them wide, Anise's cock seeming huge as it pressed against its small slit. Although she'd made herself fairly small, her shaft was still as wide around as one of the rabbit's thighs. The dark chocolate hole seemed impossibly tight, barely big enough to stuff a finger into. Despite this she pushed determinedly forward, sure in the knowledge that if she broke the little creature in half it'd only thank her all the more.</p><p>    Leaning over the little bunny, Fendra kissed its chest, watching from up close how its body reacted to the increasing force. Little streams of sugary lactation started to spray against her tongue as she lapped across the creature's front, licking Anise's shaft as well, saliva mixing with chocolate syrup, cream, and precum as she spread the fluids across the place her wife and the rabbit were joined. She could feel the slow give of the bunny's body, Ann's hips bearing down on it as the redhead huffed in effort. Peppering Fen's face with little kisses, the candy creature pushed back with equal determination, ready to take its pleasure from being used. </p><p>    A squeak of happiness sounded in the instant the bunny's pussy gave way, Anise's moan coming in answer as she slid suddenly into the tiny body. Belly bulging just below its breasts, the rabbit grinned, touching Ann's cock through its thin chocolate shell.</p><p>    "Fuck me," it said, almost as if in appreciation. Like twin shield volcanoes its breasts were coating themselves white with a steady release of cream, Fen slurping at its chocolate cock in attempt to bring forth more. Its entire body shuddered as Ann slowly withdrew, then slammed back in, her pink tip never popping free. "Fuck me," it repeated, more demanding, hips rocking back against the thrusts. "Fuck me!"</p><p>    Fendra slowly milked its tiny breasts between her fingers as Anise picked up the pace, her new cock profoundly sensitive to every little squeeze of the chocolate sheath wrapped around it. The rabbit soon began to cum, its orgasm triggering once it reached a threshold of pleasure, then continuing on indefinitely as it was provided with ever more stimulation. Swallowing several mouthfuls of magic cream, Fen eventually pulled back to let the bunny shoot its load straight into the air, covering itself and Anise with white.</p><p>    Kneeling beside her wife, Fendra looked up at Ann to see the redhead flushed with pleasure. Sensing she was close, Fen adjusted her hold on the spurting rabbit, fingers wrapped around its body as if she were holding her wife's own shaft. Its breasts squished between her middle and index fingers, leaking cream over her hand. Her pinky pulled its cock flat across her knuckles, the tip coming down to point directly at the bunny's own panting mouth.</p><p>    Jerking the tiny chocolate body up and down on Anise's shaft, the sudden cries of ecstasy from both participants made Fen grin with glee. Wrapping her free arm around her wife's hips, she helped to hold the other woman steady while utilizing the cumming bunny as a fleshlight, its moans gurgling past the facial it gave itself with every thrust. </p><p>    Ann came without warning, going breathless and rigid, one of the many strokes setting her off. Her magical endowment swelled within the bunny's body, pulsing and spurting cum to mix with the leaking cream. Streaks of thick semen began to appear in the outpour from the chocolate rabbit's tits and shaft. Fen moved to lick them up, enjoying the combination of salty and sweet.</p><p>    Coming down off her climax, Anise suddenly pulled free of the candy creature, her sugar glazed cock softening and leaking leftover cum across the table. Fendra's mouth was around it in an instant, moving away from the discarded bunny to eagerly slurp the shaft clean. Behind her the chocolate creature sprawled out, weakly oozing a sticky mess out of its naughtier parts. Between its legs its pussy gaped wide, a slow flood of cum and cream pouring out to puddle across the tabletop. It smiled as its essence leaked out, black candy eyes blinking slower and slower, cock twitching less often. Eventually it fell still, becoming only a solid shell, a lewd sculpture made of the finest chocolate.</p><p>    For a moment the only sound was of Fendra's mouth working across Ann's cock, gently cleaning every inch of the shaft even as it slowly disappeared, retracting back into smooth flesh. She serviced her lover with pure devotion, licking up the strands of sugar and seed that stuck to her skin, rubbing muscles while Anise stood panting from the exertion of her passion. She had almost gotten every last drop of the mess when her wife stopped her, a palm cupping her cheek.</p><p>    "That was wonderful, Fen." Ann's face tilted towards her, glazed eyes coming into focus through a haze of afterglow. "Incredible. You have no idea." She took a shuddering breath, pulling Fendra up onto her feet before embracing her tightly. "I love magic," she murmured, the words muffled by her lover's cleavage. "I love you."</p><p>    Close as she was, Anise couldn't miss the quickening of her wife's heart. Fendra was already anticipating her reward. Smirking slightly, Ann tilted her face up towards the taller woman, then spoke her consent. </p><p>    "For the pleasure you've given me, I will allow you to indulge." She was keenly aware Fen hadn't cum during their play, hadn't even tried to find orgasm. In repayment, she would give her wife the opportunity to enjoy her guiltiest pleasure. It would be a rare treat for her, as the bunnies had been an even rarer one for Ann. "You may call me what you like, and use me as you wish."</p>
