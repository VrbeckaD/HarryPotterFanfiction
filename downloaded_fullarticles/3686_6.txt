    <p>A thin smile spread across her weathered face as she lay her quill to rest on the bedside table. Her expression softened; deep lines traced a map of the valleys and peaks of adventure, joy, worry, and pain of this life. Gently closing the leather bound book of parchment that lay across her lap, she inhaled deeply, the scent bringing back memories that swirled heavily around her. The last of her most important thoughts, the burden of knowledge she had carried, lay within. It was time, and she was ready. </p><p> </p><p>Ch 1:</p><p>Minerva had always been fascinated by many things. Considered by most, if not all, to be the brightest witch of her class, she was determined to leave her mark on Hogwarts. A half-blood with no family name to rely on, reputation was everything if she hoped to make a life there. </p><p>She was a talented Quidditch player, and House pride carried her when talent and training, though considerable, fell short. The roar of the crowd bolstered her further as adrenaline coursed through her veins. The freedom of flying was invigorating and juxtaposed the rigor and ferocity of her focus for academics, providing precisely the outlet she needed. </p><p>The outlet was needed, of course, so as to have the determination to carry on with the exhausting and mind boggling feat that lay before her in transfiguration. Minerva had yet to meet a challenge which had defeated her. As she studied with Professor Dumbledore, toiling endlessly, she was determined to garner success once again and register as an animagus before her time at Hogwarts was through. </p><p>On top of Quidditch and her academic pursuits, she had made her desire for leadership known. The last four years of hard work had seemingly begun to pay off, and having secured her position as Prefect, she was on her way to becoming Head Girl. The balance between juggling her school life and that of maintaining her family’s secret at home weighed heavily upon her shoulders. There were few, if any owls exchanged during the year, so as not to arouse the neighbor’s suspicions. It was challenging, at first, as she missed the comfort and reassurance of her dad and mum at home, desiring to share with them the magic and wonder as she discovered it. But, as the years passed, it became easier to throw herself headlong into her world at Hogwarts, disconnecting from her Muggle life at home. The challenge then became, of course, the months of break from her studies while she was back home; re-acclimating to the Sundays in her father’s parish and maintaining the facade of normalcy to protect them all. </p><p>The trouble, she pondered now, with so many fascinating pursuits was, of course, the limits of time. How was she to continue with a successful Quidditch career, become an animagus, secure all of her O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s, make a real name for herself and continue to make her parents proud? </p><p>Her mum was proud, of course, having been Quidditch Captain herself. The news of Minerva being made a prefect had been met with joy and celebration. But, making her mum proud was always conflicting, as the strain of carrying the burden of secrecy regarding his wife and children's magical abilities weighed heavily upon her father’s shoulders. Her abiding love and respect for him bolstered her during these long summers as she lay her wand to rest until she went back to school each Autumn. </p><p>Time, it seemed, was the answer to all of her problems. Making a quick mental note to spend a bit more time in the library when she returned, Minerva wondered again why no one has a magical solution for this finite commodity, yet. Time, quite probably, was the most elusive of restraints, and Minerva loathed being circumvented by anything.</p><p>“Oi, Minnie!” She startled and turned to stare at the gangly Dougal McGregor as he pulled his horse and cart to a sharp stop before her. Still laying in the field, she was blocking his path and, so lost in thought, had been in danger of being trampled.  </p><p> </p><p>“Are you alright, then?” He ventured, wiping bits of hay and grass from his trousers as he hopped down from the cart. He reached her in two strides and held out his hand to help her from the ground. Minerva’s stomach flip flopped as their hands met, and her heart raced. </p><p>His eyes, the most striking grey, never ceased to unravel her. As children, she had been captivated by their beauty, trying repeatedly and unsuccessfully to capture their magnificence on parchment… artistic endeavors, having never been her strong suit. And now, again, she found herself lost in their depths, the swirling contrast of dark and light mesmerizing her. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m... sorry,” she stammered, and realizing she was still clinging to his hand, let go quickly as she steadied to her feet. Her hands moved to her head, trying to sweep the leaves and grass from her coifed hair without being too obvious. </p><p>He studied her apprehensively for a moment before continuing. “I didn’t realize you’d come back from school yet. How was it, this year?” </p><p>“Fine. It was fine,” she spoke hurriedly. It always made her uncomfortable to speak of school at home. Living in a countryside filled with Muggles, her father’s parishioners, and bound by the International Statute of Secrecy, was difficult for the moral-bound Minerva. “It is certainly nice to be home,” she offered. </p><p>“It’s rather nice to have you home,” Dougal said, his eyes wavering between the ground at her feet and a spot in the sky somewhere above her left eye. He cleared his throat and then launched into a headlong monologue he had clearly been practicing, though perhaps not enough. “Would you, maybe, if you’re not predisposed, or perhaps if your mum and dad aren’t disinclined, though of course you’ve only just gotten home, so they must want to see you, but, only, the lot of us were thinking of heading into town tomorrow, and I’d be happy to accompany you, if you’d want to, though you probably wouldn’t want to ride with me?”</p><p>Minerva stared at him for a moment, trying to decipher the message and keep up with the words tumbling out of his mouth. She stood, lost once again in those eyes, before realizing it had been an invitation and a response was quite necessary. </p><p>“Oh!” She turned pink. </p><p>“No, you probably wouldn’t want to, it was silly of me to even ask,” he rushed as he turned and trotted back to climb onto his cart without looking back at her. </p><p>“Yes!” She shouted, a bit louder and much more enthusiastically than she had intended. </p><p>He stopped in his tracks and slowly turned to look at her feet once again before his gaze moved slowly upward to her eyes. “I’ll be around then, to ask your father this evening?” </p><p>She nodded hurriedly and turned around to run back home without another word. Thoughts of Quidditch practice and transfiguration nagged at the back of her mind. Well, certainly, Minerva, she chastised herself. You’ve one summer to accomplish feats of extraordinary challenges, why not add a boy? </p><p>The weight of everything came crashing staunchly back on her shoulders. Time, she knew, would be the key to all.</p>
