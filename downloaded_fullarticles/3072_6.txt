    <span>Dirty. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry hated that word. It was the word his aunt Petunia used to scream. It was the feeling of Voldemort crawling around his mind. Now it was the reason his world was ending.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>The medical equipment was dirty.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry glared at the wall. Someone was rubbing circles on his back, but it didn’t feel comforting. He couldn’t feel anything right now.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>The bleeding was stopped, but the magical gauze was contaminated, causing infection.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry tried not to think of that- the bleeding. They all bore their scars from the war, but being on the losing side had had a special impact on Draco. He loved him, but Harry knew he’d never understand the pain that caused Draco to slice through his arm, removing the stain of history from his perfect flesh. The worst part was that he hadn’t known how to help him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Of course, this was purely an accident, nothing to do with the patient’s criminal record.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That had been an odd thing for the healer to mention. Draco had no criminal record.</span>
</p>
