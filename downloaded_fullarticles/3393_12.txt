          <div class="userstuff"><p>It was a shock when my friendship he spurned,<br/>
And, many years later, to find I'd been wrong<br/>
In my pride and arrogance, oh how it burned.</p>
<p>My overture, Potter should have returned,<br/>
I reached out and offered my hand through the throng,<br/>
It was a shock when my friendship he spurned.</p>
<p>With his rejection, my ire he earned,<br/>
Plummeting us into hatred headlong,<br/>
My pride was wounded and oh, how it burned.</p>
<p>I parroted chapter and verse I had learned;<br/>
Pureblood dominion the theme of my song,<br/>
Still angry after my friendship he spurned!</p>
<p>Eventually I saw the truth and I turned;<br/>
I lied to my Aunt, Potter's life to prolong,<br/>
My pride and arrogance â€“ oh, how it burned.</p>
<p>Now the war's over and still I'm concerned<br/>
Foolishly with what I craved all along,<br/>
It was a shock when my friendship he spurned,<br/>
In my pride and my arrogance, oh how it burned.</p></div>
