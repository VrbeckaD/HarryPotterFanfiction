          <div class="userstuff"><p>Remus was sitting in his favorite armchair in the gryffindor common room and was reading. Well, in fact he was staring at the page. No, <em>actually</em>; he was trying to look anywhere else than what he was really looking at. These small blue lines under Sirius‘ tanktop which showed definitely too much of his skin. Or too less? Moony couldn’t really decide.<br/>
He knew all of Padfoot’s appearance was a part of his rebellion, of showing, how much he <em>wasn’t</em> like the rest of his family. Remus totally got that. If his parents had treated him like that, he maybe would’ve done the same thing. Okay, to be fair, if his parents were like Sirius‘, he wouldn’t have survived until now.<br/>
He felt so bad for his roommate. Every time something reminded him of Sirius‘ cruel fate there was a stinging pain in his heart. </p><p>But a few months ago he started to feel a similar pain more often. Like every time he saw Padfoot with a new girlfriend. Or when the marauders planned a new mischief and he was discussing with Prongs, excitedly fixing the <em>other</em> boy‘s eyes and not <em>Moony‘s</em>. Or all the time when the black haired beauty smiled at <em>anyone</em> but <em>him</em>.</p><p>It took Remus more than six weeks to figure out that what he felt was jealousy.
</p><p>
  <em></em>
</p><p>
And that he felt it because he was totally fucking IN LOVE with Sirius Black. Padfoot. His best friend. Someone he couldn’t risk losing. At all.
</p><p>
  <em></em>
</p><p>Since then he recognised the <em>other</em> feeling he had every time his eyes fell on his mate. A funny, warm...thing in his stomach. He’d always known that Sirius was handsome but now he was just like <em>Omg! This tattoo on his chest! This perfect fucking skin! This silky, curly black hair! And look at those steel grey eyes</em><br/>
In other words: that boy drove him <em>mad</em>!
</p><p>
  <em></em>
</p><p>And don‘t even ask what happens to Moony <em>when they touch</em>. His whole body shivering and blood shooting up into his cheeks. Remus’ face would be burning red.<br/>
And now the boy he wanted so much stood up and walked over to his place. The wolf’s heart started to race just as fast as it did during his transformation at a full moon.
</p><p>
  <em></em>
</p><p>“Do you need something?“,<br/>
asked Sirius.
</p><p>
  <em></em>
</p><p>
                <em>Yes, you!</em>
</p><p>
  <em></em>
</p><p>“N-no, I don’t. W-why should I...I mean mean you came to me, didn’t you?“
</p><p>
  <em></em>
</p><p>

                  <em>“Yeah, I did. But only because you were staring at me like you wanted to eat me or something!“ </em>
                </em>
              </em>
            </em>
          </em>
        </em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>
Sirius didn’t now how close he was to the truth. Remus felt himself blush. Again.<br/>
He was trapped and he couldn’t think of any good explanation for it as long as this perfect body -with it‘s muscles and this super hot face with this naughty smile on top and this <em>tattoo</em> - was standing right in front of him.

But his brain wasn’t working with HIS handsome, perfect, <em>bloody beautiful</em> face so close to his own. Unable to think, Moony couldn’t resist it anymore and suddenly his lips were pressed to Padfoot‘s. It felt so right to him to finally do what he wanted to do for months.

What on earth did he just do? This could ruin everything!<br/>
Sirius didn’t push away. It even seemed like he was pulling the other boy‘s body closer to his own.<br/>
But now Remus did. He stared into the ground, his hands going to fists and whispered over an over again:</em>
