    <p> </p><p> </p><p>Tom was holding a gun right to Quirrel’s face. Quirieus was going to die tonight. He hadn’t paid back the debt to the Riddle family, and as per tradition, he had to be killed. Quirrel’s house was stunning : hardwood floor, priceless paintings on the walls, crystal chandelier in the living room. The house was magnificent.</p><p>“I will pay b-back. I-I promise, I just had a rough c-couple of months.” Quirrel stuttered from the fear.</p><p> Tom narrowed his eyes to get a better look at the garden behind the bay window in front of him. “Is that a new pool ?”</p><p>Quirrel’s head went back and forth between the pool and Tom’s face. “It’s not what you think.”</p><p>Tom shrugged and removed the security from his gun. He was about to pull the trigger when he heard someone coughing behind him. He turned his head around and saw 25-ish-year-old woman standing near the couch behind him.</p><p>“Sorry to interrupt.” She said.</p><p> She was wearing a black suit with high heels and her curls were loose.</p><p>“What the fuck ?!” Tom declared, surprised by the woman’s presence in a house he thought to be empty.</p><p>“Good morning Mister Riddle Junior. Would you mind putting the safety back on your gun ? We wouldn't want an accident to happen.” She said to him in a patronizing tone.</p><p>She walked to stand next to him.</p><p>“Who the fuck are you ?” Tom barked.</p><p>“I am Agent number 713 from Dumbledore Incorporated, or as we like to call it The Order, much more dramatic.” She said like a well-rehearsed text. “I just got assigned to your case.”</p><p>She looked at Quirrel and pointed towards the American bar in the kitchen. “Would you mind if I.. ?” She didn’t wait for an answer from him that she sat on one of the high stools. She pulled out a large file from out of nowhere and put it down in a loud thud on the counter.</p><p>Tom was astonished. He didn’t understand a single thing she had just said and was clearly impressed by how calm she was considering that he was about to kill a man in front of her eyes.</p><p>Agent 713 opened the file and skimmed through the pages. “By violation of the article 192-b of the Wizengamot Code, you have exceeded the limit of people you are allowed to kill in a lifetime which is  77.5 people…”</p><p>Tom opened his mouth to answer “I don’t care what you… wait, 77.5 ?”</p><p>“Yes I know it’s not logical. Apparently leaving someone braindead works too, I don’t understand it either. It’s bureaucracy, it’s beyond my scope.”</p><p>She looked fed up just talking about it.  </p><p>“You have exceeded the limit of people you are allowed to kill in a lifetime which is 77.5 people.” She resumed her monologue. “You, Mister Riddle Junior, by murdering Mister...” She stopped and read a line of the file “... Gregorovitch have reached 78 kills. So by decree number 43 you have been assigned a Stopper to... “ She looked at him and gave him a small nod “...stop you from killing more people.”</p><p>“Come again ?” Tom asked, totally lost.</p><p>The woman closed the file and exhaled exasperated.</p><p> “This means I am on your ass.” She finally said.</p><p>They were staring at each other and Tom pulled the trigger without even thinking. Quirrel’s body hit the floor loudly.</p><p>Agent 713 huffed and puffed. She took a look at the body. Tom was expecting her to react to the pool of blood but she only rolled her eyes. “79.” Her gaze found him and she kept talking “I probably should have skipped the introduction and directly should have told you not to kill him.”</p><p>She slapped her hands on the side of her thighs and gave him a pinched smile. “Well, I believe we are bound to see each other from now on.”</p><p>Tom only blinked for half a second that the woman was gone. He turned around him looking for her, but she had just disappeared into thin hair. He wondered for a couple of minutes if it had just been a hallucination but it just seemed too real.  </p><p>“The fuck…” He said to himself.</p><p> </p>
