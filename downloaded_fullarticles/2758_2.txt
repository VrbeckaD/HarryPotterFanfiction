</p><p> </p><p>Harry bit down as he tried to hold back the sobs. He prayed that his uncle wouldn’t come back but he knew better as he tried to turn over onto his side. His naked body was littered with cuts, bruises and lashings. He cringed as he felt what was either blood or semen or possibly both run down his thigh and onto the bare mattress.</p><p>He hated coming back here but he had nowhere else to go. He closed his eyes as he heard the voices of joyous Christmas carollers get steadily closer.</p><p>Ironic…</p><p>He tried to force his mind elsewhere… His body was stuck here but his mind didn’t have to be… He allowed thoughts of Ron and Hermione in, thoughts of the previous year in, Quidditch, Hedwig and Hagrid. A smile began to faintly appear on the boy’s lips, not that anyone was there to see it but that didn’t matter.</p><p>The sound of footsteps in the hallway grew louder, thrusting Harry back into his current reality. Instant panic gripped at Harry’s heart. His breaths grew shallower as the footsteps ceased in front of the boy’s door. The sound of the key being inserted into the lock pierced the Harry’s ears and his heart.</p><p>The door clicked open.</p><p>
  <em>No… </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Here we go again…</em>
</p><p>Harry pushed his head into his arms as his body braced for another assault.</p><p> </p><p>“My dear Severus, I might ask a favour of you” Dumbledore looked at the man standing in front of his desk.</p><p>“Might you go and check on Harry for me”</p><p>“Why is it you want me to do it?” Snape questioned the wizard’s motives, unsure why Dumbledore couldn’t go himself</p><p>“I would go myself but I have important business with the ministry that simply can’t wait.”</p><p>The older wizard refused to take his eyes off Snape</p><p>“Please Severus, I have… Shall we say… A feeling he might be in a bit of a pinch”</p><p>“Why” the words slipped slowly out of Snape’s mouth</p><p>Dumbledore stood from his chair and turned to face Fawkes</p><p>“I’m not sure what you’ll find Severus… But do be careful”</p><p>Snape didn’t feel like he had a say in this but knew when he’d been dismissed.</p><p> </p><p>Harry sunk his teeth into his arm, a futile attempt to divert his attention from other sources of pain…</p><p>“Now boy” Vernon held the whip in his hand before tearing it against Harry’s torn flesh. “I have been kind enough to give you the food that falls off our table and Dudley’s second bedroom”</p><p>Harry saw the whip land in the corner of the room as the large man climbed on to the bed before straddling the wizard. Harry cringed as he felt a hardness poking at his opening</p><p>“And what have you given me back?”</p><p>“Argh!” Harry tried not to scream but failed miserably as he felt Vernon force his way inside his body</p><p>“Nothing” he hissed viciously before pushing his way in and out of the wizard. The sharp pain subsided to a dull ache as tears slid from Harry’s eyes. He refused to let his uncle see how much he was hurting him.</p><p>“What would your freaky little friends think if they saw now aye?” Vernon pulled out, only to flip Harry over and force his way back inside. He reached forward before grasping his fat fingers around Harry’s neck, cutting of the boy’s air supply. Harry instinctively raised his hands up to his Uncles, trying to pry them free as his desperate lungs cried out for oxygen.</p><p>Harry bit down as he felt the man continue to pound inside of him, half of the wizard prayed someone would save him, the other half wished his uncle would just finish him.</p><p>“They wouldn’t want to be friends with you, they would be disgusted by you” he continued tightening his grip as Harry felt his arse fill with the man’s seed.</p><p>Who was he kidding… Who would come to save him…  </p><p>Harry’s vision began to dim and his surroundings started fading from view</p><p>
  <em>This is it…</em>
</p><p>Half of him was terrified</p><p>The other relieved as he began to accept his fate at the hands of this awful man</p><p>“You will join your freaky parent’s soon boy!”</p><p>A bolt of light flashed across the room before the grip around his throat loosened and the weight on top of him was pulled off.</p><p>Harry fell off the bed onto the floor, coughing and gasping desperately for air as it began to slowly fill his lungs</p><p>Harry blinked repeatedly, trying to figure out what just happened and if it’s what he thought it was, was it actually for real or just another hopeless fantasy.</p><p>The boy’s vision slowly coming into focus as he looked up, expecting to see Hagrid or Hermione or Ron or even Dumbledore…</p><p>His eyes met with Severus Snape…</p><p>He wasn’t prepared for this… But he just saved him… Why…</p><p>Snape looked shocked to say the least, unable to summon words as he looked down at Harry’s body strewn naked on the floor before offering him his hand.</p><p>“Th-thank you” Harry grasped the hand</p><p>An instant later they were back at Hogwarts, the room was unfamiliar to Harry as he took in the decor</p><p>“Wh-where exactly are we?”</p><p>“My quarters” Snape replied bluntly, not taking his eyes off the cuts and bruises plastered over the boy’s body.</p><p>Harry suddenly remembered he had nothing on as he instinctively tried to cover himself. An instant later he felt a blanket around him.</p><p>“Nothing I haven’t seen before Potter” he glanced at him once more “don’t feel ashamed” the words leaving his lips were slow and precise</p><p>“Th-thanks” he whispered, his throat was hoarse  </p><p>“Dumbledore is away on important business and Madame Pomfrey is away for Christmas so I guess it’s up to me” Snape stated slowly before turning toward the myriad of potion bottles littering the bench nearby.</p><p>“Why…” Harry began before his voice choked back, feeling unable to ask the rest of the question but wanting desperately it’s answer</p><p>“Dumbledore sent me” Snape replied, already knowing what the boy was going to ask as he fossicked through the jars.</p><p>“He had a feeling you were in a bit of a predicament…” the professor stopped to look at him “and he was right”</p><p>Snape stepped towards the younger wizard</p><p>“Drink this, it will help with the pain” the professor’s gaze was met by the boy’s</p><p>Harry tried to figure out what it was he was seeing in Snapes eyes… Was it… A hint of sorrow?</p><p>“I’m sorry you had to experience that Potter” his voice sounding surprisingly empathetic</p><p>“And don’t worry, you will not be going back there, you get to spend Christmas with me instead”</p><p>“Aren’t you lucky” A faint smile hinted on the professor’s lips</p>
