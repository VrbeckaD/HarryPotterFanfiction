<p>“This is ridiculous,” muttered Blaise. </p>
<p>“Agreed.” </p>
<p>“Let’s galvanise him.” </p>
<p>“How?” asked Pansy.</p>
<p>Blaise sighed. “I’ve an idea…” </p>
<p>Pansy smirked. “Go on, then. You’re up.” </p>
<p>Snorting, Blaise sauntered towards Potter. From the corner of his eye, he saw Draco watching. </p>
<p>Potter looked up. “Zabini?” </p>
<p>“Hello, Potter.” Blaise leaned forward. “I understand you’re looking for a date for the Ministry’s Spring Ball.” </p>
<p>“I—”</p>
<p>“Blaise?” snapped Draco behind him. “A word?” </p>
<p>Smirking internally, Blaise nodded. “Of course.” He winked at Potter, who looked utterly confused. “Excuse us, Potter.” </p>
<p>Once out of Potter’s earshot, Draco growled, “What the fuck, Blaise?” </p>
<p>Blaise smirked. “Something wrong?”</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Well done,” said Pansy after Blaise returned. </p>
<p>Blaise looked over to where Draco was <i>finally</i> chatting with Potter. “We’ll see,” he muttered. “Because if I’m forced to listen to Draco whinge about Potter again—</p>
<p>“Shh, he’s back,” murmured Pansy. “Everything okay, Draco?” </p>
<p>“I hate you both,” Draco said, sitting down. He glared at Blaise, but his expression looked pleased. </p>
<p>Blaise smirked. “Well, if you weren’t going to ask—” </p>
<p>Draco rolled his eyes. “You were trying to galvanise me.” </p>
<p>“It worked, didn’t it?” said Pansy.</p>
<p>“I suppose.” Draco’s eyes widened. “Shit! What do I wear?” </p>
<p>Blaise smirked at Pansy. “You’re up.” </p>
