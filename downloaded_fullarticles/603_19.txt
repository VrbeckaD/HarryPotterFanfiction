      <p>Finally, with winning the second wizard war under their belts, the Hogwarts class that started with Harry Potter had graduated. There were new friends and there were missed friends, and there were new relationships. Harry and Ginny were having a baby after marrying a year or two back, Ron was engaged to Lavender Brown, and Hermione? Hermione Granger was still a virgin. Though she was about to change that. Feeling alone and having nothing extra millennial to celebrate, Hermione decided, after a good couple of drinks, to loose her virginity.</p>
      <p>Also in the same room, was Draco Malfoy. Bored out of his mind and drinking with almost every other breath he took-after all, he had been on the loosing side of the war-Draco thought about having some fun. The smartest wizard of their time (hey! it wasn't <em>un </em>true) cast an all around Legilimency spell. Whoever he looked at, he could hear their internal thoughts. Most of them were simply over excited about passing the exams, like <em>that</em> was a task, while others celebrated their futures. The most interesting one he found belonged to the one person he ever considered to be almost equal to him; the smartest witch of their time: Hermione Granger.</p>
      <p>Had they been a couple years back, when you couldn't tell Granger apart from that oaf of a grounds keeper, he would have chortled in agreement to her thoughts and moved on. But this wasn't then. This was now. And now, not only was Hermione the smartest witch, he was willing to argue that she was the most beautiful as well. A real ugly duckling story, she was. She was perfect, and didn't Draco Malfoy deserve the best? It would be a crime to let Hermione Granger continue to be a virgin for long. And that <em>is </em>what she wanted tonight, right? He broke the spell and set his mind, walking over to her.</p>
      <p>"Hey there, Gra...Mione," Draco faltered as he came closer.</p>
      <p>Hermione turned to her name being called, not expecting to see Malfoy.</p>
      <p>"Can I help you with something... Draco?" She decided to use his first name as well, as he'd started the decent exchange.</p>
      <p>"<em>Actually, </em>I was wondering if there was anything I could help <em>you </em>with."</p>
      <p>Hermione was shocked. He didn't know what she was thinking, did he? She cleared her throat and shook her head. He couldn't. This made Hermione wonder <em>who</em> she would even do it with. Sure, there had been a thing between her and Ron on the run, but to be honest, it wasn't like she had much of a choice. Harry had Ginny, and Ron... wasn't exactly on par with her.</p>
      <p>Draco Malfoy on the other hand...</p>
      <p>Oh no! She couldn't think that! What with their history and all. He was an insufferable little ferret with shining silver eyes and that beautiful blonde hair and oh the rumors! No Hermione, absolutely not! But then again, there could be worse. Hermione swallowed down the images that came in her mind from thinking of those rumors.</p>
      <p>"Whatchya thinkin' bout, Granger?" She heard him ask and saw his hand resting on hers.</p>
      <p>She breathed and slowly pulled her hand from his as she turned back to face him.</p>
      <p>"Draco..." She began but was cut off with his mouth crushing on hers.</p>
      <p>Draco didn't know what came over him, but soon as his mouth caught her bottom lip, electricity shot through him and he couldn't think of doing anything better. Oh what hell!</p>
      <p>He felt her resist and pulled her closer with his hands cupping her face. Hermione eventually let in and her hands went to his chest, feeling his pecks through his shirt. A moan escaped her lips and Draco lost it. He placed his hands on hers and apparated them to his head boy dorm.</p>
      <p>Oh Merlin!</p>
