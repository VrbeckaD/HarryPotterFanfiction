</p><p>Pounding pounding pounding. His whole body felt like it was being torn apart and smashed back together again. Ugh his head, even in the welcoming embrace of the darkness of unconsciousness where he should have been completely unaware of pain it tore at him, stabbing him as his magic violently disagreed with something.</p><p>Ringing ringing ringing. His dark place refused to quiet. A piercing terrible noise. After what seemed like a eternity the pain eased a strange obnoxious beeping continued to torment him. Refusing to quiet. A rhythmic sound. Beep be-beep beep unending.</p><p>A rolling nausea rippled through Harry, his eyes darted open and he groaned as his body seemed to protest at his eyes even moving. "Sick." Was all he was able to managed out before he began heaving. His body almost seeming to protest his very survival.</p><p>"Shit! Here-here you're gonna choke to death!" a masculine voice said frantically, forcibly turning Harry's head and holding some sort of tub under his chin. Ugh he felt like he was going to heave up his guts! When was the last time he ate? It was like all he had was a stomach full of acid... But he had literally just ate before leaving home? It didn't make any sense! Though the pain didn't either...</p><p>Slowly the man pulled the puke tub from Harry's face, wiping at his mouth with a wet wipe. "You alright now kid? I mean not to sound like an ass or anything but you look like crap... Nearly died so I guess that's probably the reason... but... uh. Yeah. Anyway. How are you feeling?" The man asked. Harry's vison refused to stop blurring exhaustion was almost all consuming and all he felt like doing was sleeping, not talking. He forced himself to sit up though, stiffening when the man's words finally sunk in. Wait he had nearly died? What?! His vision seemed to almost snap into place after that. The strange man that had helped him becoming crystal clear.</p><p>Tall, he was very tall but ghastly thin and gaunt. Thick brows with strange sunken eyes. His hair was spiky and blond with two strange long strands in the front. Even looking deathly sick and frail Harry could feel power a kind of power that filled the air and took over an entire space, cloy and potent and consuming. It was a power that choke the breath out of all but the most powerful of beings by just being in the same area with it. Harry was thankful he was a very powerful wizard or he would be having some trouble as sensitive as he was to other's magical strength. He shuddered lightly as the taste of bile made the nausea roll through him again. He was hardly able to keep it in check.</p><p>"Kid?" The man pressed. Looking nervous, leaning forward in his set like he was expecting Harry to get sick again.</p><p>"I-I where am I?" Harry finally managed to get out. His brain still jumbled and confused. The annoying beeping was even louder when awake he thought distantly.</p><p>"Huh... Yeah... Well you're at the hospital, I mean pretty obvious right? Anyway, uh... So do you remember anything?" The man asked Harry, absently he sat the tub of throw up on a little side table next to the bed.</p><p>"Rem-ber anything? I-I left home... I was going to go to my Auntie Bella and Uncle Rabastan's home... Mum and Dad... they.. Were going to leave to go on a trip with friends for a few days. I-" Harry furrowed his brows trying to remember what happened next. "I had just finished lunch and used-used the floo to head over but it's been acting up because mum used some manky old spell he found and though would summon something I guess... and we hadn't gotten anyone out to fix it yet... It was taking us to random places but... I-I thought it would be fine. That-that since it was taking me to different floos I could-could just use the one I got spat out of to get me to my Aunt's. I stepped through then-then," Harry paled and his eyes widened becoming distant, nearly blank looking, "I saw a strange purple glow and felt a pull. Like I was... b-being being torn apart and put back together over and over again... It hurt so much!" He whispered shuddering. The memory making him nearly heave. Suddenly the feeling of cotton mouth hit him, making him go into a fit of coughs.</p><p>The man immediately snatched up a cup of water and carefully put to Harry's dry lips. Forcing him to take little sips so he wouldn't throw up again. After a few minutes of silence the man began to speak.</p><p>"No idea what the hell you are talking about... spells and such... but I'm assuming you're talking about a quirk or something. But it sounds... like the guy that you got spat out of's quirk must have somehow crossed with your mother's and grabbed onto you... in the middle of the battle he was... in with the heros." The man said, grimacing and itched at his cheek.</p><p>"H-heros? What are you talking about? What's a quirk?" Harry asked trying to straighten himself up more.</p><p>"What? You-uh a quirk? They didn't say you hit your head!" The man said, looking at Harry with pure worried disbelief.</p><p>"I'm a wizard! Wait, where is my wand?" Harry asked, panic filling him. He desperatly tried to force himself upright.</p><p>"Wait wait wait, wand, like from movies? You must have hit your head way harder than I thought! I saw a white stick literally burst into flames on it's own like some fantasy movie or something when you hit the ground but I mean it was a stick. It didn't look anything like like merlin's staff or anything!" The man insisted, looking like he was trying to force back laughter.</p><p>"I'm not joking! I'm a wizard, Harry Lupin-Black, heiress of both lines! My family must be worried sick! Auntie Bellatrix will be on a rampage by now, likely cursing anyone she comes across and my Uncles won't be far behind! All of this and I don't even have my wand so I can at least try and figure out a way to get home or protect myself!" Harry insisted, tears filling his eyes. What was he supposed to do now?</p><p>"What? Cursing what the hell does that mean? Wizards, kid you aren't making any sense!" The man said, looking at Harry like he thought him crazy, even scooting away slightly.</p><p>"My Auntie Bella is vicious she'll try hunting me down! My uncles to but Auntie Bella is um... a little unstable.." Harry vaguely explained.</p><p>The man cringed going stiff at what he had been told. Was this the child of a villain? Even so he was unwilling to judge so fast. What was all this magic crap though it sounded almost like this kid was a noble or something. What was up with the heiress bit though? He had thought the kid was a girl at first but this... kid clearly had at least the outside equipment of a boy. Something felt kind of creepy and archaic about this.</p><p>"So what you don't have a quirk or something you have magic and wands and crap?" The man asked, trying to get the kid to explain more.</p><p>"I don't even know what that-that is! And yes we do! I'm from a magical wizarding community in Britain!" Harry insisted, looking ready to bawl his eyes out.</p><p>"Ugh. You know the ability you are born with? 80% of the population has one! The guy that spat you out had a type of warp quirk that made it so he could create portals and spit objects out from other places. He unfortunately died because he ended up imploding after spitting you out. You obviously have one as well, I mean green lightning lashing out at everything... You were nearly dead before anyone could even get anywhere near you." The man explained.</p><p>"What? Wait... So most people have these abilities?" Harry Asked in a hesitant tone of voice. Dread slowly filling him, drowning him.</p><p>"Yeah of course! Why?" The man asked. "Wait, hey, hey you alright?" He asked jumping to his feet as Harry went a deathly shade of grey and dry heaved, trembling head to foot.</p><p>"It-he- the spell mum did must have done this! He- no no no! Magic in my world is only able to be used my a few people! This is bad-bad! I thought it felt different... My-my magic is all twisted. It isn't the same anymore! It isn't just a part of me anymore... it-it is me! There is no separation, not even slightly." Harry babbled hysterically.</p><p>"Wait slow down! What the hell are you even talking about?" The man demanded, wide eyed.</p><p>"I'm not where I should be! No wonder I was in so much pain... My magic changed somehow. It feels so strange!" Harry said, ignoring his pain. He managed to fully sit up.</p><p>"What? You know this sounds crazy right?" The main pointed out, pale.</p><p>"It's not like I tried to make this happen! I'm-I'm never going to see my mum and Dad ever again am I? I'm all alone now!" Harry sobbed realization just truly fully hitting him, a desperate fearful sorrow filled his eyes so completely with hopelessness that the man couldn't help but feel sick. That look, the kid had lost everything no one could fake that kind of hopelessness and emotional pain. In that moment he believed him. This kid, Harry or whatever... Oh god. This poor boy! So small and alone. He had to help him, to protect him!</p><p>"Hey, hey it's... okay." The man said, placing a hand next to the boy's arm. "I mean it isn't... but I'm not going to leave you all on your own okay? You'll live with me." The blond haired man said compulsively. Moving his flexing hand to place it on the child's head. He still had trouble believing that this kid was a boy. He inhaled, startled by the softness of the kid's silky hair.</p><p>He couldn't remember ever seeing a boy so pretty before with his delicate small frame, soft lightly curled nearly shoulder blade length ink black hair, and large soulful strange almost luminescent green eyes. Something in him insisted that he had to protect the kid. He was just so tiny and vulnerable looking, fragile, poor thing! He looked like he could hardly be more than nine or ten, though the blond man knew that was unlikely by what doctors had told him.</p><p>The man gave the boy his best smile, his super hero smile. In an attempt to reassure him.</p><p>"R-Really? But you don't even know me!" Harry pointed out sniffling.</p><p>"Yeah, really you'll stay with me, okay? I mean... It's not the same as having your family but... Well... Anyway, we'll probably have to figure out a back story for you or something... My name is Toshinori Yagi by the way. You can call me Toshinori." The man said, grinning at Harry. What was he even doing? Offering to take some random kid in! Toshinori forced that from his mind, trying to put the kid at ease with a good natured guff.</p><p>Toshinori couldn't let that poor boy be all alone in a completely different world than his own... Especially with his odd... Ability to get pregnant the doctors had mentioned and besides that he looked to only 9 or 10 and already everything about him screamed vulnerable cinnamon bun Uke boy! He definitely would protect him who would if not him? Ugh the idea of even leaving the poor kid all alone made Toshinori feel ill. Some creepy would happily take advantage, he was sure!</p><p>"Thank you!" Harry exclaimed, lunging forward to try to hug the man, falling into his lap instead as his body seized with pain.</p><p>"You-you shouldn't exert yourself like that kid! You literally just-just got out of a 3 day long coma! Besides that you shattered your leg." Toshinori stuttered, uncomfortably patting at Harry's back as he quietly whined and shuddered in pain, his leg absolutely on fire along with the rest of his body.</p><p>"Didn't think bout it!" Harry whimpered. Trying to take in a deep breath. His cheeks beat red.</p><p>The blond haired man slowly stood up and sat Harry back on the bed, careful not to yank out his IVs and tossed the blankets over him. "I'm going to go see if I can get you another blanket or something, you feel kind of cold. You need to be careful from now on, you don't need another surgery on that leg to... I'll be right back." Toshinori muttered, shuffling from the room.</p><p>As much as Harry wanted to protest his body demanded he went to sleep, he felt drained emotionally, physically, and the pain he was in made it even worse. He wished that someone would just hand him a pain potion, an extra strong one would really be appreciated at the moment! Even as stressed and nervous as he felt, sleep almost instantly forced itself on him. Even then Harry could hear the obnoxious beeping in his sleep, like before. It thundered through his troubled dreams beep be-beep beeping all around him.</p><p>
  <strong>00000000000000000000000000000000000000</strong>
</p><p>Harry had been in the hospital for nearly a month before finally being able to be allowed out... more convinced to be allowed to leave. He didn't heal nearly as fast as most people. His blood results were apparently strange, interesting but also worrying in some ways as he had several different mineral levels that were low. After several tries to up them it became apparent that he had issues things like mineral absorption and heat regulation. They also were worried about the way his body may be reacting to his quirk. Even with everything, Toshinori had thankfully managed to convince the hospital staff to release his new charge. Harry hid his twinges of pain from his changing body and badly broken leg. He wanted to just get out of the place that smelled of death and antiseptic. Toshinori was with him nearly constantly, other than a few hours a day. Teaching him about this 'new world'. The man had actually found the hardest part of everything to be trying to teach Harry about technology and things that Harry had deemed 'Muggle'... what ever the hell that meant...?</p><p>"So here's My place! Your room is over here! I tried to go by what you were telling me you like so sorry if it isn't to your liking..." Toshinori said, nervously rubbing the back of his neck. Feeling more nervous than he had expected.</p><p>"No, it's perfect!" Harry insisted. Smiling kindly up at the man. Hearts and stars shining around him. Making Toshinori recoil, looking at him with his face twisted in horror at how utterly adorable and sweet he looked. It wouldn't be long at all before boy's would be trying to take advantage of his ridiculously pretty sweet heart of a charge because there was no way in hell this kid was going to be attracting any girls, at least not straight ones! Why, why did he have to be such a... Uke boy?</p><p>Toshinori let out a nervous gush of air, smiling. "Good I wasn't sure." He admitted, 'I've never had to figure out a room for anyone let alone practically a girl before. I'm so glad I hit the nail on the head' He left out. Harry's, or as he had begun to call him, Harrison, because no way was he going to be calling him 'Darling Flower or Darling Harrison' like the kid's weirdo uncle apparently called him, taste seemed to strongly lean towards delicate and ...well girly things. It was like the poor kid was preprogramed into wanting kids and babies which at 13 years old was rather alarming for Toshinori. Especially as the man had already begun to find himself feeling an almost parental attachment to the child. And as his kid, Harrison would not be making him a premature adoptive grandpa or what ever the hell he was now going to be! The idea of it made Toshinori shudder in horror.</p><p>Harry gimped across the room on his crutches and sat on his bed flopping back onto it, marveling at how comfortable he could already tell it was. He couldn't ever remember finding a bed even half as comfortable as the ones at the Malfoy estate before. This one had to be just as comfortable and from what he had learned they couldn't cast softening charms in this place. How did they manage to make the mattress feel so nice without one though? Harry laughed rolling about on it, rubbing his head against the mattress, marking it with his scent. He loved it so much! All of it! Toshinori was so good to him! Everything was so pretty!</p><p>Harry's bedroom was a dusty purple color consisted of a queen bed with vivid peacock feather print bedding with it's coloration varied from emerald green to a bright purple. It had a large desk, and a plush dark green love seat next to a nearly bare book shelf. Harry squealed when he one of his hands felt something worn and familiar feeling. He immediately snatched it and pulled it to his chest, tears beginning to weld up in his eyes. It-it was, how did he find him? Paddy! "How-how did you find him? I thought he got destroyed or something?" Harry bawled, hugging his childhood stuffed animal close.</p><p>Toshinori smiled, sitting down next to Harry and affectionately ran a hand over his hair. "He was in a pocket on the inside of the bit of the clothes you had left... When you told me about him... how much he meant to you I... I went and got him repaired." Toshinori explained, rubbing his neck.</p><p>"Thank you so much!" Harry exclaimed, hugging the man, tears still running from his eyes.</p><p>Toshinori cringed when he pulled away and saw the bleach spots on Harry's far too large, shirt. They would really need to go clothes shopping as soon as possible Toshinori decided. Harrison couldn't be using the same two pairs of clothes forever and he forgot to get some stuff to wash Harrison's hair! Damn it! He'd have to go out and get some. It wasn't like bar soap or straight shampoo could be used with hair like that. Toshinori sighed, he was already doing a crap job at being a parent.</p><p>"Hey... So hows the leg feeling?" Toshinori asked, nibbling his lip. Hoping that he wouldn't need to leave Harry on his own.</p><p>"Hmm, it's alright. It doesn't hurt as much today as yesterday or anything." Harry said, sitting up and running a hand through his lose hair, Paddy was still fir.</p><p>"Good, want to go out to eat or something? Then we could go get you some stuff after if you're feeling up to it." The man said, giving Harry a nervous smile.</p><p>"I'd like that. Um, could we get a decent brush or something to? The hospital comb is practically useless." Harry explained, blushing as he ran a hand through his hair. Giving the man another nervous gentle smile that made him absolutely melt.</p><p>"Of course. Anything you need kid!" Toshinori cheerfully agreed, fully meaning it. He hadn't known him long but Toshinori could already feel himself truly caring for the boy.</p><p>
  <strong>000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</strong>
</p><p>It had been a few months and in that time Toshinori had grown to love Harry as if he were his own flesh and blood child. Even with all the awkwardness that came with having a boy raised to be a 'heiress' with an adoration of stuffed animals well and live animals, children and really just cute 'girly' things in general and with the unnerving ability to eventually have.. them... like a girl, some day ugh, Toshinori couldn't stop having nightmares of Harry coming home with a baby and declaring him a grandfather for some reason. Getting use to going shopping for painfully cute clothes and learning how to braid hair wasn't exactly things he was expecting to have to learn either.</p><p>The hardest thing to deal with was the random quirk spaz outs though. Having to try to explain away why one of his bathrooms had to be not just repaired but completely rebuilt hadn't been easy especially when he was supposed to be a quirkless man with a strange probably bordering on creepy obsession with All Might. Asking them to have to completely rebuild half of the upstairs 2 weeks later had been awkward... and that was understating it. All over one goddamn spider Harry insisted was the size of a football and had pulled knife on him that he had never even seen. He was pretty convinced the kid was seeing things when he was half asleep in the middle of the night.</p><p>Harrison's quirk... was destructive to say the least. Toshinori had learned the does and don'ts around Harrison who was a rather meek and shy especially if he didn't know someone. He was prone to panic attacks and in general didn't do well in situations he wasn't familiar with or that involved being around lots of people... coming up behind him while he was half asleep without making any noise was also a total nono... electric shocks really weren't fun.</p><p>Anyways, reacting in fear all the time to things didn't seem to be a good thing when it came to such a quirk which he didn't seem to have much control over at all. His abilities lashed out in situations of stress, much like a small child's would sometimes do. Unlike most children or well people in general Harrison's quirk was dangerously powerful and destructive even without direction... Especially without direction! Lightning and Hurricane force winds... yeah not a good combo for a neurotic person. Mother nature must have either had a cruel sense of humor or was a total idiot.</p><p>In Toshinori's opinion Harry really would have been more suited to a quirk like super cleaning or something to do with babysitting things he would enjoy and be ridiculously good at... not something that could destroy a city block if he became too frightened because he had the control of a toddler. That was okay though, because Toshinori was sure that given a little training and encouragement that Harrison could become a great hero! They had a little over a year after all to get him ready and Toshinori was sure that they could. He believed in Harry who was already catching up with school sorts of things incredibly fast. He was extremely intelligent and a very fast learner It shouldn't take much for him to get a hold of at least what ever basics there were to control his quirk once they figured it out. And of course with an amazing quirk like that Harry would surely get into the Hero program at U.A.! Toshinori was sure Harry would be one of the greatest of heros!</p><p>Sadly even as amazing as he was, how kind and sweet, Toshinori didn't think that he would be suited to being the next torch bearer of his particular quirk. With his fragile body Harrison could never handle such a quirk. And Toshinori was certain that no matter how much training he were to ever do, it would never be enough. That was why when U.A. got into contact with him, Toshinori accepted their offer. He was going to be a teacher for at least the semester at the world premiere Hero school. He would pass the legacy of his quirk on and would surely be able to find the perfect person for it in a school for heros, the premiere school for heros to boot!</p><p>Agreeing to be a professor at U.A. meant that they would have to move. Something that Toshinori felt extremely stressed out about, not for him, but for <em>his</em> sweet nerotic Harrison. Being forced into a place packed with people all the time. Being forcing Harry into a school with other kids. Nearly sent the man over the edge with worry. Kids could be so mean after all and what if Harry got scared or needed him? He was such a sweet sensitive child after all! They hadn't been separated more than a few hours at a time since Toshinori had saved and took him in.</p><p>Toshinori had been homeschooling him in an attempt to catch him up to more normal things as the kid seemed to be able to brew up a mean headache reliever quite literally brew one which was freaky and ridiculous that wizards and witches apparently literally taught their kids to make potions with cauldrons, but knew nothing about science or conventional math. Toshinori still had trouble wrapping his head around it.</p><p>

</p><p>"It says here that you have to connect the red cord to the third bracket down." Harry said, sitting cross legged on an air mattress, hair dripping wet.</p><p>"Okay got it." Toshinori said, giving a thumbs up. "What's next?"</p><p>"Uh, give me a second." Harry said, flipping through a booklet. "Okay now all you have to do is connect the input.. Jacks into the matching colors." Harry said, squinting at the ridiculously small print.</p><p>"Yes done! Now what movie do you want to watch? I've got that new one, Vindicator- civil war or Dr. Odd." Toshinori said, holding up two movie cases.</p><p>"Dr. Odd, he's supposed to discover magic right?" Harry asked.</p><p>"Yeah, it's got really good reviews." Toshinori nodded.</p><p>"That one then!" Harry insisted, eyes lighting up with excitment.</p><p>Toshinori removed the DVD from it's case and crawled over to the flat screen sitting on the floor and pushed the open button on the player sitting next to it, putting the disk inside of it before closing it. Before sitting down he rolled up the inflatable mattress that refused to work and stuffed it back in it's box, he would return it in the morning he decided, the sooner the better after all. Toshinori snatched the remote and shuffled on his knees back. Sitting next to Harry on the huge inflated mattress. "Wait, you should probably brush your hair out before it dries too much." The man pointed out, his little over a year worth of strong parental instincts telling him Harry would regret it if he did it in the morning.</p><p>"I don't know where my brush is yet. I think I accidently put it in a box with my bedding stuff." Harry explained, smiling sheepishly.</p><p>"Well, sit in front of me then." Toshinori ordered. Clicking play on the DVD remote. He began carefully running fingers through black hair, absently easing through knots and tangles. After doing that, the gaunt man pulled a dark green scrunchy from his wrist, without even glancing from the screen he began braiding silky locks effortlessly. Twisting the hair tie around it's end, not having to look at what he was doing even once he was so practiced.</p><p>He and Harry continued to sit there like that for the remainder of the movie, making commentary, only pausing it a once when they forgot to grab some snacks. Harry fell asleep leaning against Toshinori Going completely limp, snuggled up against him making the man almost want to coo at his cuteness. Toshinori yawned, clicking off the TV. Glancing at the mess he grimaced, pushing the bowls away with his sock clad foot. "I'll deal with that tomorrow." He mumbled to himself.</p><p>He picked Harry up and laid him down on the inflatable 'super tough All Might' air mattress sitting among a couple dozen unpacked boxes in the living room. He tucked Harry in nice and tight, parental adoration bubbling up in his chest as Harry nuzzled his pillow and curled up in a tight ball. The blond haired man crawling in on the other side of the mattress with his own blanket and sprawled out, thoughts of everything they had to get done whirling in his head before he finally fell asleep, feeling hopeful and content as his pride and joy, his 'baby' slept soundly next to him.</p><p>
  <strong>0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</strong>
</p><p>Toshinori flailed around in panic, Harry would be meeting his protegee today in the entrance exam for U.A.! He hoped he liked him. Toshinori didn't know what he would do if he didn't! Harrison's opinion was more important than anyone's to him, they just had to get along! He was glad that Harry at least wouldn't have to worry about the hero program portion of the exams. Being the world's greatest super hero definitely had it's perks in everyone listened to him when he said something.</p><p>Toshinori was still worried though. Harrison hadn't been in school the entire time he had him. It was for both his and other's safety, Harrison's control hadn't really improved much other than being able to cause things to sort of happen with it at will. It wasn't that Harry didn't try to learn control it but his ability was too wild and powerful and was out of control in such a way that Toshinori really didn't know how to help deal with it. How did you gain control of something as wild and unpredictable as a true natural disaster? He sure as hell didn't know that was for sure! Dealing with it was nothing like dealing with his own quirk. Harrison's was like trying to treat a rattlesnake like a dog. Not exactly easy when all it wanted to do was kill you! Toshinori was convinced that half of the problem was Harry's lack of confidence and naturally nervous demeanor. But he was sure his sweet boy would still be an amazing hero once he learned the trick to controlling his quirk.</p><p>"Are you sure you're ready to go tomorrow, I wouldn't care if you wanted to you know... stay home if you wanted." Toshinori wheedled wringing his hands together. Sweet literally poured from the man.</p><p>"Nah, I-I think I'll be okay!... I need to get into a-a good school so I can get a good job when I'm older." Harry insisted, scuffing at the floor with his toes.</p><p>Toshinori practically deflated at Harry's words. He really much rather have Harry never leave, then he at least would know that he was okay and no one was taking advantage of him or being mean to him. Harry smiled up at him in that sweet adoring reassuring way that just melted Toshinori. No he needed to support Harrison! Not make him feel like he was doing something bad! Harry already had enough confidence issues without him making them any worse with his hovering. Toshinori instantly forced himself to straighten up and laughed enthusiastically, his super hero laugh on full display as he grinned, "Of course if that's what you feel comfortable doing I'm behind you 100%!"He insisted, giving Harry a thumbs up. "Now go on! Go take a bath so you won't have to be in a hurry tomorrow, alright? Then straight to bed." Toshinori insisted, affectionately running a massive hand through Harry's near mid-back length hair.</p><p>"Okay! I promise." Harry agreed.</p><p>" No staying up until 3 again reading, got it? I don't want too you tired for tomorrow." Toshinori warned, suddenly looking far more serious.</p><p>Harry squeaked in embarrassment. "That was one time!" He eeped covering his cheeks when he felt them heat up.</p><p>"Uhuh." The blond haired man snorted. Practically shrouded in a cloud of scepticism.</p><p>"I'm-I'm taking my shower now." Harry muttered looking very much like a scolded pouting puppy.</p><p>
  <strong>00000000000000000000000000000000</strong>
</p><p>"You remembered your lunch right?" Toshinori asked, looking half ready to panic on Harry's behalf, frantically darting around trying to find everything.</p><p>"Yeah, right here." Harry said, holding up a zip up lunch cooling bag.</p><p>"And your bag right?" Toshinori exclaimed, eyes frantically darting around his whole body jittering as he wrung his hands together.</p><p>"Um, yeah. It's on my back..." Harry said pointing over his shoulder to his bag with cute little green puppy paw prints on it. "Have everything I need." Harry assured the man.</p><p>"Your phone?" The gaunt man pressed, blatantly ignoring Harry.</p><p>"In that Faraday cage thing you got me." Harry sighed, jingling the rubber and metal contraption at his side.</p><p>"Oh, you forgot a hair tie." Toshinori called out in triumph, ready to drag his charge back home that very moment.</p><p>"Oh I did didn't I? It's fine it looks nice this way anyway, doesn't it?" Harry said, tossing his hair out of his eyes. Not realizing what he had done had looked horrifically seductive.</p><p>Toshinori twitched, "Yeah, you're putting your hair up." He insisted hissing slightly at how ridiculously attractive his Harrison was.</p><p>"Oh... Okay?" Harry mumbled, completely baffled looking.</p><p>Toshinori pulled a scrunchy out of his pocket with a grimace. Quickly putting Harrison's hair up with a triumphant noise. He completely recoiled in horror and began making choking noises and almost looking like he was seizing when Harry turned to him as the bell rang, tilting his head and running a hand over the top of it. Practically sparkling and shining. Oh god what had he done?! Showing off his full face was way way worse! He was almost sickeningly adorable with his hair that way! Oh god he didn't want to be a grandfather yet! No!</p><p>"I guess I have to go in now. See you later um... D-dad!" Harry said nervously smiling at the man before heading towards the building. Looking back at the man looking slightly concerned as he continued to just stand there, clawing at the air and gasping. Delusions of Harry showing up with a baby running as clear as one of his beloved flat screen movies through the man's mind.</p><p>

</p><p>"First day of school. Room A 1. General education." Harry muttered to himself. Harry had been worried during the exams that Toshi had signed him up for the hero courses, being All Might, but he didn't have to do more than the basic exams. The only thing that he had to really worry about the whole time is if he had answered a few essay questions satisfactory. No terrifying robots, no chance of severe injuries. It was a major relief! He didn't want anything to do with that lifestyle at all. No matter how much he loved his adoptive father he didn't want to be in constant danger. What Harry did want was a calm fulfilling job and to find someone to fall in love with then have a big family.</p><p>Harry tried to not be very noticeable when he entered the room. Thankfully it didn't have too many people in it yet so that wasn't too hard. He sat down, trying to be as discreet as possible he stayed quiet, too nervous to try and introduce himself. For some reason he always seemed to garnish a ridiculous amount of attention when he entered a room. Harry really wasn't a fan and was baffled why.</p><p>"Are you listening to me! Get your feet off of that desk! Be respectful of this institution and the students before us!" A very serious looking black haired student with a pressed uniform and glasses insisted. "Um... are-are you alright?" The teenager asked the boy he was lecturing after seeing the look on his face. The ash blond haired red eyed, sharp toothed boy's face was turning a worrying shade of red, eyes wide and vacantly staring. The boy backed away as the air around the blond began to heat up.</p><p>The tall serious looking student nervously followed the other boy's eyes confused by the display of anger towards a petite rather beautiful student, siting quietly, nervously arranging writing utensils. What a ridiculous response to someone sitting respectfully waiting to be educated! Something was obviously wrong with this barbaric boy! He would just have to make sure that the hooligan left her alone.</p><p>"Hi their cutie! My names Denki Kaminari! What's your quirk? Mines Electrification. I bet a pretty person like you has a really pretty name!" A electric blond haired boy said winking and flexing his arms flirtatiously, accidently knocking everything on the desk to the ground. The boy jerked away fearfully when he heard an enraged almost feral sounding growl.</p><p>"What the hell do you think you are doing extra? She obviously doesn't like you shit head! Look what you've done, knocking shit all over the floor what an asshole!" The ash blond teen suddenly yelled, his whole body smoking. He immediately stomped over making the other boy flee out of intimidation and began to help collect Harry's things. "He. He didn't do anything else.. Right?" The boy asked, face still a worrying shade of red now almost purple as he fidgeted with his sleeve involuntarily.</p><p>Harry shook his head, still completely confused by the boy's odd behavior and more than a little concerned about the smoke emitting from the boy's skin. The heat felt nice though. He was always pretty cold so being next to a practical heater didn't feel too bad.</p><p>"Good or I would have had to beat the shit out of that <em>pervert</em>!" The boy snarled, sparks rolling over his palms, his eyes almost crazed looking.</p><p>"Okay?... Um anyway I guess it's nice to meet you-...?" Harry said, trying to remember what the boy's name had been... he swore he saw him up on the screen when the students wanting to enter into the Hero program had been assigned to different practice city simulation grounds or what ever they were. That meant... aww! He didn't make it into the hero class, it wasn't what he would want to do but like many attending the exams it was likely his dream. Poor guy! Being in his class that meant he must not have passed!</p><p>"Katsuki Bakugou. Losers are only allowed to call me Bakugou, my last name, but I want you to call me by my given name Katsuki!" Bakugou said in a bragging tone of voice. The tone he used while telling Harry he wanted him to call him by his first name sounding much like he was bestowing upon him the greatest of honors.</p><p>Harry gave the boy a kind smile. "Oh-okay if that's what you want..."</p><p>Bakugou's eyes widened, feeling his mouth go dry. What was this weird feeling, like his heart was going to explode? She was so-so... pretty.. No more than that bigger calling her pretty would be like saying his quirk was just 'okay or average' no he was fantastic practically a god! Saying such a thing would be near blasphemy. No maybe beautiful, gorgeous? There weren't words to describe this person. That smile though. It made him want to hide this person away from the world and keep 'her' all to<em><strong> himself</strong></em>. Something was so unbelievably genuinely sweet and innocently almost fragile about them. Like a sunny day almost, the feeling reminded him of the day his quirk appeared. He wanted to protect this person. Wanted them to be <em><strong>his.</strong></em></p><p>Bakugou nearly choked as realization hit him. Did he really just develop a crush on someone he had only just meet? Did he really have an actual crush, is that what this was his first one? No it was something else, stronger. Yes, he wanted this person to become<em><strong> his</strong></em> girlfriend... m-maybe possibly more! "Of course that's what I want! I wouldn't have said I wanted you to call me that unless I wanted you to!" Bakugou grumbled, looking away and rubbing at his neck feeling nervous and pathetic like-like that loser, Deku. NO! Nothing he did could be anything like that quirkless lesser! What else did he say though? Wait, what was her name? Yeah that's what he was supposed to ask right?</p><p>"So uh, what's your name anyway?" Bakugou asked, leaning against the desk behind him.</p><p>Harry shyly twirled a finger through a lose curl. "Harrison... I'm not sure if it's Yagi or still Lupin-Black... since my adoptive... Dad... and I decided that I would probably have less mix ups with paperwork and such... And well then-then I... wouldn't stick out so much if I had the same last name..." Harry explained, an uncomfortable look on his face.</p><p>Bakugou nearly cringed at the shitty name his crush had. Who in the hell named their kid, let alone daughter something as awful as that? A thoughtful look inched itself across his face as he forced his way past the name and focused on the other information revealed to him. Harrison... Yeah he would need to come up with a good nickname or something... was adopted. Where her parent's dead? Was she abused and taken away? Was it neglect? Ran through his head at rapid pace. He could already tell that she seemed to be a bit of a nervous person though he wasn't sure if it was because he was talking to her or if she was just shy.</p><p>"You can call me Harry if you want though, that's what everyone use to call me." Harry said.</p><p>Bakugou went stiff and growled, forcing himself not to blow up anything. NO way in HELL would he be calling 'her' <em>that</em>! It absolutely infuriated him that anyone had ever even called Harrison that! How could she let people demean her like that? The future girlfriend of Katsuki Bakugou would not be allowed to be made fun of that way! Katsuki would just have to make sure of it! "Come on, you can sit by me..." The aggressive boy growled, snatching everything up that was left on Harry's desk. A vein throbbing at his forehead at the thought of someone calling his, well soon to be <em>his </em>girl, <em>that</em>! feeling furious didn't even start to describe how angry he was. He stormed over to a desk and sat everything he had grabbed from Harry's desk down on the one next to the desk he chose for himself. It was in the front row at the very corner of the room. Being there would make it easier to keep track of Harrison and keep others away.</p><p>"W-wait... so um does this mean we are... are friends?" Harry stuttered, half curling in on himself as he stumbled after the other boy.</p><p>"Why else would I be letting you sit next to me? Of course." Bakugou said, feeling nearly giddy at the idea of the other wanting to be around him even though 'she' didn't seem to even know him past what he had just told her. Though it did hurt his pride a little to. That was okay though, forgivable, because it sounded like she wasn't from the area. Her ignorance of his magnificence could be forgiven. He already had a feeling that there was probably not much that he would think unforgivable from the other though.</p><p>Bakugou froze as Harry suddenly lunged forward and hugged him.</p><p>"I'm so happy! I hope we come to be good friends! I haven't had a friend in forever..." Harry nearly cheered, his chest swelling with happiness grinning. He was so lonely. He had Toshinori and loved him very much but the companionship of a parent and a friend were two very different things. He was so glad he had found a friend even if he seemed a little odd acting and a bit rough. It sort of just reminded him of his old friend, Cerburus... though with a mix of Dionysius added in...</p><p>That smile completely melted Bakugou, making him feel strange and oddly content the anger he normally felt seemed to simply fade away like it hadn't even been there. He couldn't help but smile back, all sharp teeth. Running a hand through his hair. His smile twisted into an enraged sneer when he heard the extra pestering him introduce himself excitedly to someone stuttering in a sickeningly familiar way. He turned to look on reflex. What, why the hell was that little shit here? Deku! He would pound that no body into the pavement! He would crush him to bone dust! He would kill hi-</p><p>A man's voice began to grumble in the hallway making everyone quite down in curiosity.</p><p>"It took you 8 seconds to quite down." a strange unkempt looking man grumbled, surveying the students. "Time is a precious resource. You aren't a very... rational lot, are you?..." The tired looking man voiced, sighing. He rolled his blood shot eyes then unzipped himself from a sleeping bag and walked over to a podium in the front of the room, dragging the bright yellow cocoon like bag behind him. "I'm your home room teacher, Shota Aizawa... Pleased to meet you." The homeless looking man said, grabbing his sleeping bag and holding it out to the meek seeming green haired boy that Bakugou had been half ready to kill earlier. "Quickly, hand these out... All of you, change into your GYM uniforms and head out to the grounds. I'm going to be testing your quirks."</p><p>"Wait! But what about the entrance ceremony?! Or our guidance sessions?" A girl with brown hair whined, looking half devastated along with most of the other students.</p><p>"There's no time to waste on that stuff if you want to become real heros. Shows like that are useless in the real world." Aizawa muttered, pulling out a juice pouch and began sucking on it.</p><p>Harry went green at what the man had just said.. Feeling vertigo. He instantly held his hand up, arm shaking.</p><p>"Yeah? What is it?" The man half groaned.</p><p>"Um, I'm sorry but I think I was put in the wrong class! I took the exams to go into General education, not the Hero program!" Harry squeaked.</p><p>Bakugou's face twisted into a mixture of confusion and anger at that admission.</p><p>"What's your name?" The man asked, now seeming to be mildly interested.</p><p>"Harrison Lupin-Black!" Harry said, trying to force himself not to just run out of the room screaming in terror.</p><p>The man leafed through a pile of papers. "Yeah, this isn't a mistake... You got a recommendation, something pretty hard to come by, now please sit down." The man said turning to continue speaking to the rest of the class.</p><p>"W-What? This is the first I have heard of this! I-I am requesting that I be allowed to talk to a councilor or something. I need to get this changed right away! I'd be no good at this at all!" Harry exclaimed, feeling ready to throw up.</p><p>The man's eyes narrowed. "Well someone obviously thought you were... And you got... a 96% on the test, second best over all on the written exams."</p><p>"They were obviously wrong!" Harry couldn't help but snipe. " My-I-I have taken a career aptitude test and everything. Hero definitely didn't come up as one of the careers recommended for me! I'm much more suited to be a elementary school teacher or daycare provider and the closest things I got to being a hero was being a social worker or a veterinarian!" Harry explained, beginning to sound manic. He pawed around in his bag to try and find the paperwork. Practically ripping it out of it's labeled folder to hand it to the man.</p><p>"Yeah... I don't really care. Mine said I should be an accountant or life coach of all things.. so... I kind of take crap like that with a grain of salt. Please, just sit down. I'm not changing my mind." The man grumbled.</p><p>Harry did as he was told, his throat feeling like it was closing up on him. He gripped his knees, trying not to visibly tremble.</p><p>"Anyway, get those on so we can head outside for your assessments. Today is the first step for some of you in the right direction to becoming pro heros."</p><p>
