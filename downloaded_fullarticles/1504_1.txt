    <p>His Royal Highness, Roark Killian Potter al Aurelia, the youngest son of the Royal House of Aurelia, was fourteen today.  His brother, Hadrian James would be twenty, born six years earlier on the same day.  That, however, wasn't what mattered most to Roark.  'Why should it?' he had asked of himself, he had shared this day with Hadrian for fourteen years.</p><p>No.  What REALLY mattered to him...ALL that mattered, was that he was FINALLY going to be able to attend his first official Ball tonight.  He'd been wanting to attend one since his brothers had began to tell him everything about the ones they got to go too as they were older.  He had tried to sneak down on such nights that a Ball was being held in the Grand Ballroom, but each time he had been caught by one of his brother's Guardian's. usually Maverick, or Kartiel, his brother Aleksander or Adreian's Guardian's.  They would take him back up to his room, scolding him the entire time about sneaking out, especially as he knew just how dangerous it was with so many strange guests in the Palace.</p><p>On this particular morning, he had awakened early, the excitement thrumming through him as he heard the arrival of several carriages in the private inner courtyard beneath his open balcony doors.  Wanting to see just who was arriving so early, he threw back the light blanket and silk sheet, jumped out of his bed and ran out onto his balcony.  Stepping up onto the bottom rung of the golden ornate rail that ringed his balcony, he leaned over to look down.</p><p>"Aidan! Kili! Uncle Thorin!" he called down to them upon seeing them, all talking as they headed toward one of the many doors into the Palace.</p><p>All three of them stopped, looked around, then up upon hearing their names being called out so excitedly.  His Uncle was dressed in smoky blues and grays, a jeweled circlet resting in his dark head.  Kili was wearing blues with silver trim along all the edges, a simple golden circlet resting in his own dark head.  Then finally Aidan, who wore soft grey and black, he too with a plain golden circlet, resting on his auburn head.</p><p>"Well, good morning, birthday boy!" Aidan called out cheerfully, a wide grin twisting his lips as he looked up at him.</p><p>Thorin was about to scold his youngest nephew when he heard, "Your Highness!!" the voice was deep, sternly scolding as it came from somewhere inside the bedroom behind Roark.</p><p>Roark looked behind him.  "Um...oops," he said, not sounding at all contrite at being caught doing something he knew he wasn't supposed to be.</p><p>Aidan and Kili both began to laugh.  "Caught again, Imp."</p><p>"You two should not be encouraging him so," Thorin scolded his son and nephew lightly, though he was smiling.  "As for you, young man," he called up to the imp they all adored, "you know better then to be climbing up and leaning over balcony rails."</p><p>"You should not be out here, Highness, in your pajama's, bare of foot, and leaning so dangerously over that rail.  Come inside at once--OH! Good morning to you King Thorin, Prince Kili, Prince Aidan."</p><p>All three inclined their heads to him.  "Good morning to you as well, Guardian Maverick," Thorin said in an amusement rich voice.  "You have your hands full with our imp, as always I see."</p><p>"Aye, that I do, Majesty, but I do not mind, nor would I have it any other way."</p><p>"I'm sure you wouldn't.  We will be seeing you very soon, my Ghivashel {precious}."</p><p>"Okay, Uncle.  See you at breakfast."</p><p>"I'll be up to see you very soon, Rory.  There's a couple of things you and I need to take care off."</p><p>"Okay, Aidan."  He jumped down, then turned to face the frowning, disapproving visage of his eldest brother Aleksander's Guardian.  "I'm sorry, Maverick, but I heard the carriage arrive."</p><p>A shake of his sandy brown head.  "Of course, you did," he said resignedly.  "As did most of your brothers, but you do not see THEM out on their balconies, calling down to guests, now do you?"</p><p>He shook his messy midnight haired head.  "No, but then Aidan, Kili and Uncle Thorin aren't guest's, are they?  They're family."</p><p>A soft chuckle sounded almost reluctantly.  "Well reasoned indeed, my Prince.  Now, come inside at once.  Let's at least get your bath done before Prince Aidan comes up."</p><p>"Okay," he said, following him back into his bedroom.</p><p>                                                                             cccVccc</p><p>It was early afternoon now, and most of the family and guests that had arrived to attend the birthday ball of the two youngest Aurelian Princes, were now in their rooms, resting before the start of the festivities later that evening.  On the third floor of Ravenhill Palace that was the home of the Aurelian Royal Family, in a large, brightly lit room, sitting relaxed in one of the chairs before an empty fireplace, was the High King of the Aurelian Planetary Star System, James.  In a matching chair across from him sat his Guardian, his best friend, Sirius.  Also in the room, sitting in various chairs and couches spread around the fireplace that nearly took up one wall, was James' wife of thirty eight years, Lily, her Guardian Remus, who was also one of their best friends.  His eldest son Aleksander, Crown Prince and Heir to the Throne of Aurelia, sat beside his mother, while Lily's brother, and King of Erebor, Thorin, sat in the chair on James' right.  Another of James' long time best friend's and the King of Calseres, Corvus Lestrange, sat across from him and beside his own eldest son and Heir, the husband of James and Lily's only daughter, Caelyn, Crown Prince Christian.</p><p>To this day, many people wondered how James and Corvus had ever become such good friends, even Sirius and Remus had often wondered, as it was said that the Lestrange Family had a reputation of being as Dark, as James was Light.  Light and Dark magic were opposites, like love and hate, life and death.  Two sides of the same coin and you could not have one without the other, without destroying the balance that existed, though to some, like Tom Riddle, now called Voldemort by many, and Albus Dumbledore, who was Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry here on Aurelia, it must be one or the other, for you could not have both.</p><p>Fools, James thought, the both of them.  It was why he had resisted sending his children to Hogwarts, because he had not wanted them pulled into THAT war, as well as the one between those that could use the Force and those that could not.  The Force, and those able to wield it was no-where near as prevalent as Magic was, and even more rare was that you had both.  Which his son Adreian, and his two youngest did, and though he had so far been able to keep that from the Dark Lord Voldemort, as he so liked to call himself, and Emperor Palpatine on Coruscant, he had not been able to keep it from Albus Dumbledore.  HE came to the Palace every day to badger him about sending Hadrian and Roark to Hogwarts.  So that he may teach them what they needed to know to control their magic, and their Force abilities, even though he himself was not able to use the Force.  How, James had asked him tartly, did he hope to teach his sons how to use something he himself could not?  Dumbledore's answer, as always, had been vague, couched in explanations no one but him could ever hope to understand.</p><p>The Force had all but been wiped from the Galaxy.  Those that were able to use it to any affect in hiding for their lives as the man who had once been a Councilor, but had, in fact, turned out to be a Sith Lord in hiding until he was powerful enough to take over, killing the Jedi Knights, even the children that had been in training in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, had been killed.  It was not long after that, that Lord Darth Vader had appeared, serving the man who had declared himself Emperor, hunting down the Jedi that had escaped the slaughter at their temple.  Any one they heard of that showed any signs of being able to use the Force were generally hunted down and killed.</p><p>"James?" came the quiet, worried question.</p><p>James turned his head, his eyes meeting his beloved wife's emerald green eyes, looking at him worriedly.  "Nothing, darling, just thinking about things I can do nothing about at this point."</p><p>"Then can we get this started, please?" she asked.  "I'd like to make this as quick as possible.  I need to go up and check on Roark."</p><p>James gave her a smile.  "Of course, Lils.  Corvus, my friend, Lily and I have, of course, spoken with you on this matter before, but at the time Rodolphus was still wed, and we had discussed the possibility of betrothing Roark to one of your two youngest sons.  But now..." he paused, looking between Corvus and his son in law, who, even now, sat back in his chair blowing on a steaming mug of coffee.</p><p>Corvus followed James' gaze, smiling at Christian who sipped carefully from his mug.  Realizing that they were now looking at him, he raised his eyes, returning their smiles.  "Now, we can thank all the Gods, Dolph is a widower, you have since betrothed Rabastan to Harry, and Cameron...well now, there's the question, isn't there?"</p><p>"Christian," Corvus scolded his eldest, though truth be told be couldn't put much heat into it.</p><p>Christian shook his auburn haired head.  "I'm not going to say I'm sorry, Papa.  Everyone here is aware of exactly how I felt.  That...BITCH made Rodolphus' life sheer hell for the short time they were wed.  I know she was your cousin, Sirius, but had Bellatrix not been killed in that riding accident when she was, I was, may the Gods forgive me, strongly considering killing the spiteful, hateful bitch myself.  Your pardon, Lily."</p><p>"No pardon needed, Christian.  Much to all our regrets, none of us saw just what Countess Lady Bellatrix hid so well beneath the surface, and yes, Siri, I'm well aware you tried to warn them, and us."</p><p>"Yes, and as I am sure you know, Chris, I would have gladly helped you," Aleksander spoke up.  "As would Rohan, Aidan, Fili, Ethan, Brady, Simon and Adreian.  In fact," the grin he gave would have made lessor men shudder, it was so malicious, "we had already spoken to Maverick, Raiden, and Kartiel.  They gave us some very good ideas--"</p><p>"Alright, Alek, that will be quite enough," James said amid Sirius' not so soft chuckle, making him turn his head.  "Sirius," he said, even as Thorin began to chuckle as well.</p><p>Sirius shook his head.  "I warned you all about Bella, but no one would listen because she seemed so perfect.  I may be your Guardian, James, but I feel it is as much my duty to protect your children and their friends as much as it is my job to protect you."</p><p>Aleksander gave Sirius a warm smile.  "For which we thank you for, believe me, but as you wish, Adad, {father}," he said as he sat back beside his mother, her hand slipping into his to squeeze as her lips twitched.  "Though I DO feel the need to point out it was actually Aidan and Rohan who came up with the best punishments."</p><p>"Ah yes," came from Christian, "the vengeance of empaths and Healers.  You should have heard what my dear wife, your beloved daughter, wanted to do to her on several occasions," he gave a deep shudder.  "VERY nasty."</p><p>Lily laughed.  She just couldn't help it.  She threw her head back, laughing heartily, making them all look at her.  "Never, my dears," she said breathlessly, wiping tears of mirth from her eyes as she looked at them, "doubt the vengeance of a woman bent on protecting those she sees as her family."</p><p>"Amen to that."  Christian said heartily, raising his mug in salute before drinking his cooled coffee.</p><p>Corvus could only sigh now.  "Yes, my son, I am well aware of your feelings on this matter," a nod to Aleksander, "and yours as well, Aleksander.  You, your brothers and cousins, have all made your feelings clear, as had our King of Elendia and the Crown Prince.  You have all always been very protective of each other, and the younger children, especially after what happened to Cameron."</p><p>All of their expressions darkened at the mention of Cameron.  "We did not protect him as we should have, and what happened to him must NEVER happen again.  We will NOT make the same mistake twice.  If Kili hadn't come forward when he did, we may never have known what was happening and therefore, lost Cam for good to that monster."</p><p>"No," came Aleksander's hard voice as if reinforcing a promise made, "it will not.  That Kili realized what Cameron was hiding from all of us, even after he had been returned to us, and went to Uncle Thorin about it was a miracle in itself.  Besides, if we don't look out for each other, who else will?"</p><p>"Oh, I don't know," James said, "your Guardian's perhaps?  That IS, after all, why they are there."</p><p>"Forgive me for saying so Sirius, Remus, but we can not always depend on our Guardians, or the King's Guard, for that matter to protect us, Dad," he said quietly, his blue eyes meeting and holding his father's gaze.  "You, better than anyone, should remember that."</p><p>James looked at Lily, she at him, both of them remembering very clearly that day their eldest was talking about.  The day their youngest, their most precious treasure, had been born.  "We do remember, son.  It is something that Lily and I are never likely to forget, as it so very nearly cost us Roark's life before he was even born."</p><p>"My sorrow to have even brought it up, Adad {father}," he said, as he too remembered the assassination attempt on James, Lily, and James younger brother Valerian.  That surprise attack had led to Roark being born nearly six weeks earlier than he should have been fourteen years ago today.  He smiled as he thought of his youngest brother.</p><p>"No, Aleksander," Thorin said, "never be sorry for bringing up the past.  As unpleasant as it is to remember, it is something we must never forget, for it reminds us just how precious life truly is.  They were all very lucky that myself, Corvus, Remus, Sirius and Garrett, as well as several of the King's Guard were so close."</p><p>"Yes, they were," Corvus agreed, "but unfortunately it cost Valerian, Garrett, and three of the King's guard their lives.  As for the Countess, I fear I made a grave mistake in insisting that Rodolphus honor the betrothal.  Bella was, as you well know, son, your grandfather and step-mothers choice, and at the time she truly did seem like a good match for your brother."  He shook his head, amber colored eyes holding deep regret.  "And as Lily said, none of us, not even your brother, saw the monster hidden beneath that veneer of sweet innocence, until after they were wed."</p><p>"That is not exactly true, Papa.  Three saw it," Christian's voice held fury.  "Roark saw it, but no one would listen to a child who was just beginning to learn to control his magical outbursts," grins all around as they remembered Roark inadvertently setting fire to things, or if it was storming, playing dodge the lightning, which often got him yelled at rather extensively, but he simply grinned, "then his other gifts that were sporadic at best.  Cameron saw it, but again, no one would listen to HIM because he was a fifteen year-old reliving his kidnapping and brutal rape.  Or so the doctors told us.  Finally, Kili saw it, but no one would listen to HIM either."</p><p>Another, even deeper sigh sounded.  "One mistake after another where your brother's were concerned.  They are, however, mistakes four years past, and nothing we can say, or do now, will change what happened to either of them.  We can only look to their futures, make sure they are given a chance at happiness.  Which is why we are here now, and Fiona is not.  She will, I fear, once she hears about it, fight what I have in mind for Rodolphus."</p><p>Christian blinked at his words, setting his almost empty mug aside, his eyes full of alarm.  "Fight WHAT, exactly?"</p><p>Corvus looked over at James, who merely sat back in his chair, his fingers forming a steeple under his chin as he looked between them, to Lily, who gave him a warm smile, to Thorin who nodded, before looking back at James, who raised a dark brow.  Damn.  No help from any of them then.  He sighed, looked to his son to see that his grey eyes...his MOTHER'S eyes, had taken on a very stormy look.</p><p>"Father, just what have you done now?"</p><p>Several smothered chuckles sounded at the tone of Christian's voice.  "I've chosen a husband for Rodolphus."</p><p>"Chosen a hus--  FATHER!!"</p><p>"Christian, please do not shout at me."</p><p>Christian forcibly controlled himself.  "Your pardon, Papa, but have I not made it very clear that Rodolphus has no wish to wed again?  Ever.  Be it a man OR a woman."</p><p>"You have, as has he when he came to me to talk to me about several things, but as our choice is yet a bit too young to wed, I figured it wouldn't be too much of a problem.  He has, after all, just turned fourteen."</p><p>"Just what has that to do with any--  Four...teen?" Christian broke off what he was going to say with a sudden gasp, looking slowly around the room.  First, to a now grinning Aleksander, to a widely smiling Lily, to an amused Thorin, then finally to James, who's eyes were dancing with gleeful mirth.  "Roark," he breathed.  "You want to wed him to Roark."</p><p>"Yes, Christian, that is exactly what we would like to do."</p><p>"But he..." he broke off, shook his head.  "Never mind.  Though how you can know this soon is beyond me.  I thought so when Kae told me you were talking of betrothal possibilities for Roark as early as a year ago."</p><p>Several brows rose at once, but it was James who answered.  "Between the magic, the Force and our other special gifts, we have known since just after he was born.  So now we're asking you.  What do you think of our proposition?"  He sat forward.  "The original talks had us betrothing him to either Rabastan or Cameron."</p><p>"Either of whom would have been a good choice for Roark as neither of them has ever been known to be mean, quick to temper, or as cruel as Sylvester has been known to be on occasion."</p><p>"As Sylvester was never considered, we agree with you there," Lily said, " now however..."</p><p>"Now Rodolphus is free, Rabastan is betrothed to Harry, and Adreian has been making some very subtle moves toward Cameron for several weeks now, despite still being betrothed himself."</p><p>"I trust, Chris, that you find no faults with my youngest brother?"</p><p>"Fault, Alek?"  Christian looked over at him, shaking his head.  "Of course not.  Though I've not spent much time around Roark, you, Kae and the others have had nothing but good to say about him.  My concern at this point is Rodolphus."</p><p>"As it should be.  So, you have no real objections to a betrothal between your brother and my youngest son?"</p><p>"No, of course not," he said, looking over at James, "though Rodolphus may.  I'll need to talk to him about it.  IF Dolph should happen to agree to the betrothal, I do have a demand of my own."</p><p>"What would that be?"</p><p>"Roark must be told about this.  I will not see my brother wed to another who neither wants him, nor LOVES him, any more then I would see your son trapped in a loveless marriage."</p><p>Lily raised an auburn brow as she got to her feet.  "THAT, my Lord Prince, you will never need to worry about.  You are, after all, wed to our only daughter, and I am quite sure that Rabastan has shared the details of his betrothal contract with you.  You may also have noticed that two of our son's are not yet betrothed, or wed for that very reason, and Braeden has yet to set a date for his marriage to Princess Leia Organa.  I also think we will see Adreian breaking his contract to Duke Kennedy sooner, rather than later.  We don't know his thoughts concerning Cameron as he has yet to come to us about it.  That, however, is neither here nor there.  Do you honestly believe that we would see ANY of our children in a union they would find loveless regardless of their Royal status?"</p><p>"No, Lily, of course not."</p><p>"Then you should know that Roark will be told.  If Roark has no wish to wed Rodolphus, then he will not."</p><p>"Okay then, I had best go find him and talk to him then," he said as he got to his feet.</p><p>"James, you know my thoughts and wishes on this matter.  I'll leave you to work out the details.  I'm going to go upstairs and check on Hadrian and Roark."</p><p>James nodded as he stood, moved to her to brush his lips to hers.  "Tell the boy's I'll be up shortly.  I love you," he murmured giving her another brief kiss.</p><p>She smiled, touched fingers to his jaw.  "I will.  I love you.  Gentlemen," she said with an inclination of her head.</p><p>Aleksander, Thorin, and Corvus all rose to their feet as she turned and left the room, with a silent Remus a few steps behind.</p><p> </p><p>A/N  Well, there we are.  The first chapter of my rewrite of Star Wars with Harry Potter.  As with my Battlestar Galactica, this story has been in the making with constant changes being made.  There were changes made to what I have on my external hard drive as I was typing it out.  I hope you like what you read.  Please leave me a review telling me what you think, be it good or bad, as I would really like to know.</p><p>                                                                             Acaciarose. </p><p><br/> </p><p>Edited the chapter, added a bit when I realized I had made Tom Riddle/Voldemort and Emperor Palpatine the same.  Separated them as was always intended so that now we have two separate fights.  Or so it may seem anyway.  I have also decided after long thought, to return Killian back to the name I originally gave him, which was Roark Killian.</p><p> </p>
