    <p>I was walking to Hogsmeade on Christmas Eve. I hadn't gone home for holiday this year. I didn't go too far before I tripped over an unseen log in the snow. Someone coughed deeply behind me. "Miss Sinclair."<br/>
I turned to see Snape behind me. "Yes, sir?"<br/>
A look of concern reflected in his eyes but it vanished quickly. "Miss Sinclair, can you walk?"<br/>
I tried to stand but the pain was too great. I started crying it hurt so much. "No, sir, I can't."<br/>
He sighed. "Give me your hand. I shall have to carry you back to Hogwarts."<br/>
I gave him my hand and he hoisted me up into his arms. I was surprised how strong and muscular he was.<br/>
I searched his eyes. "Professor, why are you still here at Christmas? Don't you have a family to attend to?"<br/>
He glared at me. "That is none of your concern, child."<br/>
"But you must have someone! No one should be alone at Christmas!" I protested.<br/>
Snape sighed loudly. "I wish to be alone at Christmas. I have potions to brew, papers to mark, things to do! Even the staff do not inconvenience me with such frivolity as Christmas. I do not care to be present at Christmas dinner in the Great Hall."<br/>
"You sound just like Scrooge when you say that." I replied nonchalantly.<br/>
He scowled. "If you expected someone with affection for Christmas, then it is not me, girl."<br/>
I rested my head on his shoulder as he walked the rest of the way back to Hogwarts in silence. I was asleep when I heard Snape's silky voice arouse me.<br/>
"Miss Sinclair, wake up." He said softly.<br/>
I opened my eyes. I was in the potions classroom sat in at a table with my foot bandaged up. "Shouldn't I be in the hospital wing?"<br/>
"Madame Pomfrey said its just a sprain. I am to watch over you until your foot is well." He said calmly, not looking at me.<br/>
"Good, then I can spend Christmas with you."<br/>
Snape shot me an icy glare. "Don't speak of such things to me again, Miss Sinclair. Christmas is for children...I am a grown man! I hate Christmas, do you hear me?!"<br/>
I got up to leave and barged for the door, trying to use one foot.<br/>
Snape was in front of me before I could open it. "Stay away from me!" I shouted.<br/>
He raised my chin to meet his eyes. "You must stay here with me. Dumbledore has asked me to care for you during the holiday."<br/>
"Fuck you! You hate Christmas and you hate me!" I yelled, turning my head away from his grip.<br/>
"Do not disrespect me, child. You are in my custody until you are well enough to move about on your own!" He spat.<br/>
"You are the most hated and the most cruel of all the professors in the history of Hogwarts!" I screamed. "And the most heartless and the most unloved!"<br/>
Snape took a deep breath, trying to control his temper. "You are correct, Miss Sinclair. I am all of those things but only because I'm compelled to be. My life is not the happiest of stories. I am not accustomed to kindness and love as you are. I shall grant your wish, you may go now." He sighed deeply and walked back to his desk, the sound of his long, swishing robes flowing behind him.<br/>
Guilt flooded me immediately and I felt repulsive. I slowly made my way up to his desk. The sound of scribbling filled the air now as he was marking essays.<br/>
"Sir, I apologize. It is I who have been rude. Please forgive my impoliteness." I said smoothly.<br/>
Snape looked at me and sighed. "Very well. However, while you are here you must do as I tell you."<br/>
I nodded. "Yes, professor."<br/>
He smiled at me. "Good."</p>
