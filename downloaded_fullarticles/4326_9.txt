  <em>Poland, 1944</em>
</p><p>Pale hands belonging to a short boy with unusual viridian eyes were tightly gripping an older teen's, he was nervously glancing around, watching people digging in trenches, catching sight of the numbers on their wrists...He glanced up a little at the worn and tired older woman on the left hand side of the taller teen, and she caught him, offering him a wan smile as if to say, 'It's okay'.</p><p>The smile was familiar, comforting.</p><p>In his inattention, he hadn't noticed. Everything happened in a blur. The woman pushed in a different direction than the older teen and his hand was momentarily released as he tried to go to her aid, to bring her back to his...their side. It just escalated from there, the older teen could not be moved and when the soldiers gained up on him, trying to drag him away from the iron wrought gate the woman had been shut behind.</p><p>As the gate started to bend forward, toward the older boy who was yelling incoherently, the younger slipped past the soldiers, dodging their cruel and rough hands, all too willing to climb through the gap and be reunited with the woman. But he was caught around the middle before he could get too far and without thinking on it, he bit down as hard as he could on the offending appendage that dared to touch him; unbeknownst to him, his incisors had lengthened and sharpened just enough to sink through flesh, break through the bones of the assailant's hand and enter veins. He was blind, deaf and dumb to the fact that someone was trying to yank him free of the hand he was currently gnawing on like a stubborn dog with a bone, the veins were becoming prominent, the person's hand turning grey...</p><p>White light burst from the sudden darkness of his vision. His mouth unwittingly opened and the hand was released, the boy dropped like a stone onto the muddy earth.</p><p>"<strong><em>FRANZ</em></strong>!"</p>
