    <p>"Does any of this remind you two of anything, or is it just me?" Harry asked. For some mysterious reason, the hairs on the back of his neck were standing up - usually that indicated the presence of curses or protective enchantments, but his gut told him that this was something else...something darker.</p>
<p></p><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Not just you, mate," said Ron. "The blood, the water on the floor...feels just like second year again, doesn't it? All we're missing is a message from the heir of Slytherin on the wall."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Except that time, the water on the floor was from Moaning Myrtle throwing a tantrum and was completely circumstantial. And also, in that case, Mrs. Norris didn't die." said Hermione.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"But she could've," Ron countered. "Only the reflection saved her. This person might not have been so lucky."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"This wasn't a basilisk," Hermione said flatly.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry said nothing, but he agreed with her. Even though the scene before him brought back memories, it still felt off. Almost like someone had staged it and was watching the drama of his reactions from somewhere unseen. He looked around quickly, but saw nothing behind him but the impassive black screen of the television in the corner of the living room, reflecting his tense face. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Everything about the scene they now surveyed felt cruelly ironic. Outside, palm trees swayed peacefully, basking in the hot Miami sunshine. Inside, a young girl had been murdered in what appeared to be brutal circumstances. The glass-topped coffee table was on its side, glass shattered on the floor. Water pooled on the wood floor and bloody splotches trailed from the fallen glass until a point halfway down the bungalow's long, carpeted hallway. However, that's not where Harry, Ron, and Hermione had found the body. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>They stood now in the kitchen, looking into the open door of the walk-in pantry. Kathy Merona was in there, seated on the floor with her legs straight out in front of her. Her hands were neatly clasped in her lap. A white kitchen towel draped over the top of her head and covered her face, but the tips of her curly, brown hair were partially visible over her shoulders. The sight of her made Harry feel desperately sad in a way which defied explanation...it was something about her clasped hands and her legs, perfectly straight, her feet tipped slightly apart, like a doll posed on the floor by a child...</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>It had taken Harry, Ron, and Hermione a good 20 minutes to find her. The Muggle who had reported the murder had not seen the body - merely the blood on the floor. She had been a work friend of Kathy's, stopping by the house to check on her since she had not shown up to work the day before or answered her texts. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>A watchwizard stationed in the Miami police department had tipped off the International Task Force for Magical Acts of Terror (InTaForMAT) immediately after Kathy's friend reported the blood on the floor. That was how Harry, Ron, and Hermione had gotten involved. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>After three years of serving as Aurors with the Ministry, they had all been promoted to InTaForMAT by the International Confederation of Wizards. Harry liked the work. It was exciting - he apparated to a new country every day. Normally InTaForMAT investigated politically-motivated crimes - assassinations or acts of terrorism - since the local magical authorities were usually able to handle other incidents without any bias or conflicts of interest. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Indeed, they were here in Miami today due to the suspicion that the attack of Kathy Merona might have been politically motivated: her mother, Jill Merona, was a sitting member of the International Confederation of Wizards.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Well," Ron said uncomfortably. "Should we go ahead and do the spell? Just to be sure?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione nodded, biting her lip. "Verita Mori," she said, brandishing her wand.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>For a moment, a black cloud of smoke seemed to pour from the body's pores, first covering the head and then the rest of the body. Within another moment, the odorless smoke had evaporated, leaving all three friends heavy-hearted, twice as aware of the dead silence in the house as before. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>They could have found out the same thing from touching the body, searching for a pulse in the wrist as Muggles did, but the spell told them what they needed to know without corrupting any evidence: Kathy Merona was dead.</p>
