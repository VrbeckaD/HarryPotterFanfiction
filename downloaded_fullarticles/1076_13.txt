<p>
  <span>“Happy Halloween!!!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Looking up from the Daily Prophet, Draco sent a glare at the idiot in front of him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What in the name of Merlin are you wearing?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s a halloween costume, I’m a wizard!!!” Harry grinned, he had a big wizard’s hat and robe from a muggle costume shop. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Come on, you have to go trick or treating with me and Teddy!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco just looked at him before shaking his head and returning to his paper. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That sounds stupid.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry pouted, sticking his bottom lip out. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But babe~, you said you wanted to understand muggle culture more.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I said no such thing,” Draco snapped. “And I distinctly remember you saying that dressing up was for children.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah but Teddy dressed up and I felt left out!! Come on~! Teddy’s already here and he wants you to come too,” he pleaded, taking a seat in Draco’s lap and throwing the newspaper to the side. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His boyfriend’s glare increased in animosity but Harry just grinned, immune to it. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I even got you a great costume.”  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>…</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Why am I wearing this cape?” Draco hissed.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Running ahead of them, Teddy moved from house to house with practiced ease and came back each time with armfuls of sweets. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Because you’re a vampire!” Harry chuckled, taking Draco’s hand as they walked. He watched his godson run around in a superhero cape. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His boyfriend was less than impressed. “Since when do vampires wear capes??” He growled, shivering from the crisp, autumn wind, they were lucky it wasn’t raining tonight. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Cold?” Harry asked, squeezing the blond's hand. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m fine,” Draco huffed. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry pulled him closer, wrapping his arms around his boyfriend’s back. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thanks for coming with me,” he smiled. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco sighed, threading his fingers through his idiotic boyfriend’s hair as he felt the warmth radiating off of him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just don’t make me do it again,” he muttered. </span>
