  <em>August 02, 1981</em>
</p><p> </p><p>"Food's in the fridge for both of you. I've also got a permanent Tracking Charm on Harry's favorite blanket since he lays it down and loses it all the time—what else, what else? Ah, er, he knows quite a few phrases already, but if you can't figure out what he's on about I've left a picture book somewhere that has pictures he can point to—"</p><p>"Lily, breathe," Albus Dumbledore advises.</p><p>He is relieved when she obeys without arguing, and gets some much-needed color and breath back. Motherhood under the banner of war has added several extra lines to the heart-shaped face of Lily Potter née Evans, and it would be a shame to grant her any more when her concern in this case is unnecessary.</p><p>"Though generally my charges are a little older, I do have pleasant memories of watching my younger siblings long before your time. Harry will be fine."</p><p>"Oh, I know, and I <em>do</em> trust you implicitly, Headmaster, it's just—anything could happen. I can't help but worry."</p><p>Albus lifts one eyebrow. "If you prefer, I can send Dorcas on this mission with James and myself so you might remain here. As you are aware, my original intention was only to relay your husband's message; it was you who asked to switch duties with me."</p><p>"I'd rather be there myself. I'm still on top of Charms and Ancient Runes; getting us in the manor with stealth will be a breeze. No offense, but you... tend to attract attention."</p><p>"I, attract attention?" But there's solemn acknowledgement under his playful words. She's right, after all; whether with his wardrobe or his power, Dumbledore is guaranteed a flashy, "warm" reception any time he shows up to assist his Order of the Phoenix. Sometimes that even warrants Voldemort slipping away from wherever he's currently sequestered to do battle with his old headmaster—more than enough to make even the most bloodthirsty of the Dark Lord's followers run for cover. That makes his participation in missions to arrest known Death Eaters (outside of pitched battles) nearly impossible.</p><p>Lily's chuckle is gentle and gratifying. Her eyes shine as she pockets her willow wand. "I really appreciate this. It's been so long since I've been out of the house, helping with the Order."</p><p>"A fact which no one begrudges you, I assure you. As long as your family has Lord Voldemort's attention, your safety is paramount."</p><p>"We don't want for safety in this lovely town. Especially with the Fidelius covering our backs." Lily's smile fades. "Still—I can't help but miss apprehending Death Eaters."</p><p>"Fewer missions is a worthy trade for your lives," Albus insists—then changes the subject. "Tell me about Harry. Is he adjusting well after the move here? Is there anything I need to know while I look after him?"</p><p>"Oh, he's had a very good attitude about his new home! You should be fine as long as you don't allow him to get your wand or wander off—he's just as mischievous as James and Sirius."</p><p>The mental image a baby James or Sirius getting hold of the Elder Wand makes him chuckle. "I will be sure to stay on my toes."</p><p>"Great! I shouldn't take longer than two or three hours—and I'll send my Patronus if I'm held up."</p><p>Albus waves his hand, unconcerned. Even an hour away from the school and the public places-turned-battlefields is a welcome break. And it <em>is</em> such a fine Sunday evening, cool and still, perfect for settling down in a chair somewhere and entertaining a child.</p><p>"Will you excuse me a moment?" Lily asks. She briefly dismisses herself when he nods, exiting the sitting room and calling kindly but firmly for her son. "Harry? Where are you, dear? Mummy's getting ready to go."</p><p>The headmaster hums to himself while he waits. The Potters' safe house smells faintly of lemon verbena, enough to remind him of a sweet he stumbled across and is eager to try again. The magic of being a wizard (or witch) means that it takes little time to move into a new home and make it feel "lived-in", so for all that Voldemort's potential wrath chased them here, no average observer might guess that Lily, James and Harry had ever lived anywhere else. The couch-cushions are Gryffindor-scarlet and well used; plenty of moving pictures adorn the (Floo-blocked) fireplace; and a handful of stuffed animal toys are spread across the floor, waiting for their owner's return. It is quiet and soothing—the epitome of a happy home nestled in the chaos of wartime.</p><p>His lips quirk in a wistful smile as he takes it all in. <em>Perhaps, in another life...</em></p><p>A flicker of red catches his attention and breaks his thoughts. Lily has returned, with her messy-haired quarry in tow.</p><p>"I'm back! Harry, say hello. You remember Professor Dumbledore, don't you?"</p><p>Albus glances down and is instantly met with bright green eyes and a wide, gap-toothed smile. He is immediately delighted.</p><p>"Pwofessor!"</p><p>"Hello, Harry," he says cheerfully. His eyes twinkle at the toddler's attempt at titling him properly. "Are you having a good day?"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>"That is wonderful to hear indeed."</p><p>Lily smooths Harry's hair down and sets him on the tall nearby ottoman; when he blinks up at her and lifts his arms, she smiles. "Not now, Harry. The Professor will be looking after you for a little while while Mummy goes out. I need you to be the best little boy in town for me. Stay inside and don't mess with any wands, okay?"</p><p>Harry nibbles on his lip (as best he can with so few teeth). Clearly he's considering this schedule shift and whether or not he approves of it. When he looks Albus' way, the headmaster favors him with another smile in the hopes of dispelling any tears or tantrums—and from the way he nods and smiles brightly back, it seems to work. "Okay."</p><p>"Great! In that case, I'm off—"</p><p>Lily pecks Harry's forehead swiftly but gently, and holds her hand out for Albus to shake. While doing so, he pins her in place with his gaze for an extra moment. "Keep yourself safe. Stay alert. If Voldemort arrives—"</p><p>"I'll send you my doe and come straight home with James; I promise. See you soon, Headmaster."</p><p>"And you."</p><p>She's out the door and retreating down the walk a few seconds later. Albus stands at the window and watches until he sees the tail of her red hair turn and vanish with the rest of her, then he releases the curtain and crouches next to the ottoman to catch his new charge's attention. And just in time, too—Harry is watching the swinging curtain with dawning comprehension, the beginning of a frown.</p><p>"Well, Harry, it is just the two of us now. You may be barred from a wand, but I am sure your mother wouldn't mind if you saw some magic."</p><p>Just as he hopes, the last word puts a curious sparkle in the toddler's eyes.</p><p>"What do you think?" he asks merrily, waving his hand at some of the stuffed toys at Harry's feet. Blue sparks enter each one, a prelude to the trickier animation to come. "Shall I put on a show?"</p><p>Harry claps his hands with obvious delight and chants, "Yes, yes, yes!"</p><p> </p><p>The first hour is gone before Albus thinks or cares to look for it.</p><p>He ensnares Harry's focus by animating the well-worn stuffed dog, rat, stag and wolf toys strewn about the sitting room and making them dance around the ottoman. They're close enough for the little boy to touch, and he seems awed at the way they move without any tiny hands behind them. Any worry about what Harry's mother is up to is muffled by his rapt devotion to a more animal-friendly re-enactment of "The Fountain of Fair Fortune", which according to Lily is his favorite of Beedle's tales. His excited babbles remind Albus that Lily had mentioned a picture book that she used to help decipher some of her son's more incomprehensible phrases, and he summons it to himself with another wave of his hand. Between the book's detailed illustrations, Harry's pointing, and his own considerable intellect, the headmaster gathers that Harry wants to be taught how to make his animals move.</p><p>Briefly, he cancels the charm and gives the toddler his full attention. Unlike his students, he cannot afford to leave the youngest Potter to his own devices. Eye contact and a measured, unhurried tone have so far served him well in keeping Harry calm and entertained. "Would you like to know what spells I am using, Harry?"</p><p>"Move," the boy replies, prodding the wolf. His eyes are bright and wide and earnest. "Pwofessor, me move. Please?"</p><p>"I'm afraid you cannot move things on your own just yet. To do that, you will need one of these—" And he produces his wand from inside his sleeve. The Deathstick hums within his fingers, dissatisfied with wandless tricks for small children, but he ignores its tempting whispers and holds it out for Harry to inspect. "It will be some time before you are allowed your own wand, but once you have it, you will be welcome to make as many of your toys chase each other as you desire."</p><p>"Ick?" Harry asks. He is frowning again, but this time it is the frown of a child trying to work something out which is far beyond his comprehension—Albus recognizes the pinched look as belonging long ago to his brother Aberforth. "Ick?"</p><p><em>Ick?</em>  Albus wonders; is there something suddenly making the wand disgusting or unsatisfying to the boy? <em>But Harry doesn't seem repulsed or upset</em>. When he rolls it over and over in his fingers a few times, insight hits: Harry is trying to say <em>stick</em>. Of course he has probably seen James' or Lily's wands before seeing Albus', but this may be the first time he has had the time to ask just <em>why</em> the adults around him are holding on to specially-carved wood.</p><p>"This 'stick' is a wand," he explains with a patient smile. "It allows me to channel my magic—"</p><p>Harry stares blankly at him.</p><p><em>He is not even thirteen months old</em>, Albus reminds himself, and tries not to flush with embarrassment or self-scorn in front of a baby. <em>Of course he will not understand what I mean just yet.</em></p><p>"Ah—this wand helps me move your toys, like so..."</p><p>With a flourish, he abandons nonverbal wandless spells and points back at the black dog with his wand. "<em>Animatum</em>."</p><p>The 'dog's' glassy brown eyes gleam, and his mouth opens in a silent bark as he leaps up to join Harry on the ottoman. The little boy laughs and squirms as the dog pretends to lick his face. Albus' eyes twinkle again at the display.</p><p>"Again!" Harry cries, between giggles. He points with one chubby finger at the other animals arranged patiently below him. "An-mate-um. Again!"</p><p>"Can you handle another?" A swish, a flick, and the stag leaps up too, nudging Harry with its antlers. His response is to squeal with delight and dodge the plush horns—his reflexes are rather sharp for such a young person. Perhaps he's ticklish, or perhaps it's just how he likes to play.</p><p>"Again!"</p><p>Albus' own delight at the game causes him to add a third animal to the ones crowding the boy. He forgets for a few blissful moments about balance and being careful, gets caught up in waving his wand thoughtlessly to bring joy and not pain. For once he is not an opponent for bloodthirsty or blood-obsessed foes; he is not defending countless nameless, faceless wizards and Muggles from men and beasts of uncommon power; he is not Transfiguring tea cups into ale mugs for generations of Hogwarts students. For one single evening, he is just an old man creating wonders for a baby boy that could be his own great-grandson, had the Fates been kinder.</p><p><em>Had I been less of a fool</em>.</p><p>There is a gossamer film over Albus' eyes, altering what he sees when next Harry laughs. Instead of observing a small boy with healthy tufts of black hair pushing at the gray wolf toy and his other two 'attackers' in turn, he sees the boy's short black hair as longer and pale yellow, the round green eyes as smaller, less expressive blue ones. His memory takes over, and suddenly Ariana Dumbledore is there in her younger unmolested years, giggling at her own toys as they're brought to life by their mother. It is 1887 and he and his brother are enchanted by their newest sibling.</p><p><em>"Abbus!"</em> she chirps, as she had back when the letter L was her worst enemy. <em>"Abbus, again!"</em></p><p>"Yes," he whispers, and raises his wand with Kendra's favorite spell on his lips—</p><p>A yelp makes him flinch, blink twice, then twice more. The film tears: it is 1981, and Harry has cried out.</p><p>The stuffed animals which were nuzzling and crowding the baby boy have unintentionally pushed him off the ottoman, setting him up for a nasty fall. Albus moves like the wind, but he is too far away to catch Harry without magic. Even so, he must forego words. He thrusts his wand out, and his brain half-forms <em>Arresto Momen</em>—</p><p>"Eee!"</p><p>Albus halts, mentally and physically. That was not a cry of pain. Harry is no longer falling. In fact he's... bouncing.</p><p>Instead of hitting the floor with a thud (and possibly earning blood and bruises), Harry had bounced off what looked like a faint red shield, and he's now moving up and down more slowly as his velocity returns to zero. Surprise has made his eyes even bigger than normal, but the more he bounces without any pain the less likely he looks ready to whimper or cry.</p><p>Albus completes his trip anyway, kneeling and gathering the boy in his arms. "Oh, Harry," he breathes, trying to keep his voice even. "Oh, well done, dear boy!"</p><p><em>Accidental magic</em>, he thinks, with a sigh of relief. <em>Unusual in one so young, but not at all unwelcome. Harry rescued himself.</em></p><p>Of course, Harry doesn't understand this at all—not the danger he narrowly avoided or the headmaster's well-concealed concern. Although he babbles pleasantly at being held for a few minutes, and even cuddles closer to the old man's beard, before long he is clamoring to be freed.</p><p>"Oh no," Albus tells him. "I'm afraid my old heart won't stop racing until I'm quite certain you're all right, and that does require you staying near me for a little longer."</p><p>"Don' wanna," Harry protests. His tiny features are so set and stubborn that Albus chuckles.</p><p>"I know you don't want to, Harry. But will you do it for me anyway?"</p><p>The little boy frowns some more.</p><p>Albus racks his brain for some new way to distract Harry from getting back on the ottoman and putting himself in danger once again. As he does, he doesn't notice the way one of Harry's chubby fingers accidentally brush over the Elder Wand, held loosely in his right hand now that the danger to his temporary charge has passed.</p><p>Thus, there is another moment where his mind and body freeze—when Harry's tiny hand closes around his wand and he squeaks excitedly. "Boo!"</p><p>"Harry, please let g—" Albus begins, too late. A flash of light too close to his half-moon spectacles makes him wince and squint, and when he dares open his eyes wider again, his long, well-groomed silver beard is... well.</p><p>It's blue.</p><p>"Harry!" he gasps, and gently but firmly wrests the terrible wand out of the baby's hands. The little boy just claps like he's done the finest magic in the country. "How in the world...?"</p><p><em>How did he manage this? </em>The Elder Wand is picky about its master and pickier about its spells. Moreover, Harry is adorable and clearly precocious, but he cannot even <em>enunciate</em>. How had the wand sensed his intent...?</p><p>"Boo!" Harry repeats, proud of himself. He runs his right hand down Albus' beard like he's petting a small animal. As the shock wears off, Albus can't help but be pleased at the new color and shine of his beard and mustache, even as he knows he must eventually change it back. The shade is deep and rich and defiant, rivaling the auburn he once wore proudly before age and stress leached the color away.</p><p><em>I really must use a </em>Finite<em> on it. However... it seems to have lifted Harry's spirits</em>.</p><p>Regardless—Lily will do her best to kill him if she comes home to find her son handling a wand, with half the house as blue as Albus' beard.</p><p>He takes a deep breath, and with another flick restores Harry's toys to their former positions strewn around the floor, in easy reach. He sits, balancing Harry in his lap, and gently taps the boy's nose with one long finger while holding the wand at a safe distance.</p><p>"<em>You</em> have a very particular sense of style," he teases. "I think I'll keep the beard the way it is, for now."</p><p>Harry beams.</p><p>Albus glances at the moving planets on his watch, and slaps a hand to his mouth in exaggerated fashion. "Goodness me, an hour has passed already! I think we ought to find something else to do for the remaining two, hmm?"</p><p>"An-mate-um?"</p><p>"Perhaps not that," Albus demurs. His own blue eyes brighten. "Something better instead."</p><p>From the way Harry tilts his head, it's clear he can imagine nothing better than having his toys play with him—but Albus has already had a more wonderful idea. Hadn't James crowed at many a meeting about his son's natural affinity for the sky?</p><p>"You have a little broom, don't you, Harry?"</p><p>Harry's smile is so huge it nearly marches off his face. "Bwoom!"</p><p>"Yes, indeed! We might as well put it to good use. How about going for a fly?"</p>
