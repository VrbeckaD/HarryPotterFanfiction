    <p>It’s said that fwubbings are harmless, docile creatures that wouldn’t even hurt a fly.  Or, at least, that’s what Newt Scamander says and though he still believes that the man doesn’t always have the best judgement when it comes to his precious beasts, Percival is more inclined to believe the magizoologist in this instance. </p><p>It would just be nice if they didn’t multiply quicker than the rabbits they resembled. </p><p>“Fwubbings don’t need to mate you see,” Newt says, a breathless smile on his face as he accompanies Percival in catching the damned beasts.  “They simply decide when they need to repopulate and copy themselves!”</p><p>“If they continue in this manner then we’re going to have an epidemic on our hands,” Percival grunts as he puts on an extra burst of speed, spying a fwubbing scampering beneath a bush, shaking its behind in a way that Percival <em>knows</em> is meant to taunt him.  He nearly knocks over a bemused No-Maj in his haste, offering her a brief apology as he regains his footing.  It’s lucky for them that fwubbings simply look like larger, longer eared rabbits and so the general non-magical public just think they’re a slightly odd breed of bunny. </p><p>“They’ll be fine once they’re all together,” Newt informs him once he’s caught up.  “I-It’s only because they’re so spread out that they’re multiplying at such a high rate.  Their instincts are telling them they need to replenish the colony.  Of course, you can domesticate them to curb that particular habit!”</p><p>“That’s wonderful but it doesn’t help us catch them!”  Percival lunges to the ground, not caring that the dirt is ruining his suit or that the thorns from the bush stab his face and hands, and is rewarded with the fluffy creature in his grasp, staring mournfully at him.  Percival kneels on the grass, holding the fwubbing up to his face critically.  The creature’s nose twitches, long, fluffy ears brushing against his hands. </p><p>“Oh dear, it looks like it’s going to-”</p><p>The fwubbing sneezes and with a popping noise, there are now two fwubbings where there had previously been one.  The new baby appears on the ground beside Percival’s knees and immediately scampers away, too quick for Percival to catch. </p><p>“…multiply.”</p><p>Percival takes a deep breath, lest his internal screaming attempt to become external.  “Here.  You take it.”  He shoves the fwubbing in Newt’s direction and in the brief few seconds where they both have a hold on the creature, it abruptly turns pink and emits a high pitched squeak.  If it hadn’t been for Newt, who is now staring wide eyed at the fwubbing, his mouth agape, Percival would have dropped the animal. </p><p>“What in the world was that?!”  He exclaims. </p><p>“Um, I…,” Newt becomes shiftier than normal, his blue eyes darting everywhere apart from Percival’s face which is slightly disheartening because Percival had thought they were past this stage.  “Nothing.  N-nothing at all!  Just a fwubbing thing.”  Newt distracts himself from Percival by rubbing the now brown-furred and content fwubbing on the belly.  “You like that hmm?  Well, you’ll like it even more in my suitcase.  I have a special fwubbing play area where you’ll make lots of new friends.”</p><p>Cradling the fwubbing like one would an infant, Newt bends down and encourages the creature to hop into his suitcase.  Newt sticks his head in after it, letting out a squeaky call, before lifting it back up and closing the case with a snap.  When he stand, he still avoids looking at Percival. </p><p>“I think I see another one!”  He says and quickly runs ahead, leaving a puzzled Percival to jog after him. </p><p>It doesn’t escape his notice how Newt is very careful to ensure they both don’t touch another again. </p><hr/><p> “It has been,” Percival starts, slamming his drained tumbler on the desk, “a long day.”</p><p>“Um, yes.  Yes it has,” Newt agrees, tugging nervously on the collar of his coat.  When Percival had offered Newt a nightcap to celebrate the capture of over a 100 fwubbings he’d hoped to sort out whatever had gone on but to little avail.  The other man continues to refuse to look Percival in the eye and has been stuttering over his words far more than normal.  It had to be related to the strange fwubbing incident but Percival doesn’t have a clue how. </p><p>“I b-believe I best be off now.  Good night’s sleep and all that.”</p><p>Newt hastens to stand but before he can leave, Percival gently grabs him by the wrist. </p><p>“Could you at least tell me more about the fwubbings?” He asks.  “We’ve caught enough of the blasted things that I feel I ought to be an expert on them.”</p><p>Newt scratches the side of his head with his free hand.  “Well, uh, you know most of it already.  Related to the rabbit family; very peaceful.  They won’t escape again if that’s what you’re w-worried about.  Once they find a safe home they tend to stay there for life.”</p><p>“And the changing colour?”  Percival asks with a raised eyebrow. </p><p>Interestingly, a blush rises from Newt’s neck to his freckled cheeks.  “As I said, n-nothing more than a fwubbing thing.  I really ought to-”</p><p>“What kind of fwubbing thing?”  Percival pushes, though he instantly chastises himself.  This is not an interrogation, even if there is a reason the rest of his colleagues call him the Interrogator, capital necessary. </p><p>“It’s, I, um,” Newt ends up so flustered that Percival takes pity on him. </p><p>“If it truly makes you uncomfortable then you don’t have to say,” he relents, letting go of Newt’s wrist.  He actually happens to rather like the odd man, perhaps more than he ought to, and he doesn’t want to risk pushing him away over such a matter. </p><p>“Well, it’s…”  Newt bites his lips, pupils flickering back and forth between the door and Percival before he finally flops back into his chair, fiddling his fingers and staring intently at a point just beyond Percival’s ear.</p><p>“It’s...it’s been said that fwubbings have a gift.  It’s not much more than a legend really and it’s only, um, been documented a couple of times so I wasn’t sure whether to believe it.  They say that fwubbings can, can identify a matched pair.  S-soulmates if you will.”</p><p>The blush spreads further, coating Newt in a shade of red that Percival would note looks adorable were it not for the fact that his mind is attempting to process what he just heard.  Soulmates?  Such an idea is ridiculous, inconceivable even but…</p><p>“And so I assume when these…soulmates touch a fwubbing at the same time, it turns pink?”  He asks in a tone far more calm than he feels inside. </p><p>“Y-yes, essentially, but of course it could be absolute nonsense so I wouldn’t take it seriously.  Not that I thought you w-would but-”</p><p>“Newt,” Percival interrupts, holding out a palm pacifyingly.  “What are your thoughts on the matter?”</p><p>“M-mine?”  Newt squeaks.</p><p>“Do you think it’s true?”</p><p>“I, I mean there the possibility I suppose but how can people really know if it’s true?  It might mean something entirely different…”</p><p>“How…how would you feel if it were true?”  Percival asks cautiously, actively focusing on keeping his restless fingers still. </p><p>Newt bites his lip, already chewed enough that Percival can see frayed skin.  “H-how would you feel?” </p><p>Percival accepts the switch-around and is unable to prevent his toe tapping lightly on the floor.  Not much can get Percival anxious but this…this has his heart racing in ways he is unaccustomed to and he has to clear his throat before speaking. </p><p>“I’ve never really believed the notion of soulmates myself,” he starts, not missing the slight resigned dip in Newt’s shoulders.  “However, concerning you…I find myself interested.”</p><p>Newt’s head snaps upwards, his eyes connecting with Percival’s for the first time since that morning.  In them he can see uncertainty, fear…and hope.  Percival wouldn’t be surprised if the same emotions are being reflected back to Newt.</p><p>“Interested?”  Newt repeats, his voice lowering a notch. </p><p>“While I was intending to reveal my…affections at a later date,” <em>Or whenever he finally, if ever, gathered the courage, </em>“I think you are fascinating Newt and I would like the opportunity to get to know you better.  Perhaps take you out.”</p><p>“A…a date?”  Newt clarifies shyly and Percival gives a sharp nod, hands clutching his pants tightly. </p><p>“If you would like.”</p><p>“I would like that very much,” Newt says, a small smile lighting his face and Percival feels the tension drain out of him, his own lips quirking upwards.</p><p>“I’m glad,” he says softly.  “But you were right.  We really ought to get some sleep.”  He has no doubt that when Newt returns to his little apartment he’ll be down tending to his creatures before taking care of the dark smudges under his eyes but Percival himself will need all the rest he can get.  He knows that courting Newt will be similar to courting his beasts as well and he wants to make sure he’s prepared for such an event. </p><p>“Here.”  Percival stands and holds out his hand to a still blushing Newt, helping the lithe man to his feet.  “I’ll see you tomorrow?  Perhaps we could go out for dinner?”</p><p>Newt nods, a little quick and shaky, and Percival can’t help himself.  He slowly leans forward and presses a soft kiss against Newt’s chiselled cheek.  In response, Newt makes a quiet, high pitched noise (much like a fwubbing) and Percival steps back, his hand trailing along the other man’s before releasing it. </p><p>“Goodnight Percival,” Newt says and Percival takes it as a high compliment that the magizoologist has the same wondrous expression on his face as he does when he’d found a new beast.</p><p>“Goodnight Newt.”</p><p>Percival watches Newt leave with a small, fond smile on his face.  He may not really believe in soulmates but should they exist then he couldn’t really ask for a better partner.</p><p>He also thinks he has a fwubbing to apologise to. </p>
