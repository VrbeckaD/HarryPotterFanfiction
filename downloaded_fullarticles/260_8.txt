    <p align="left">Lily Evans was running down the halls late to Charms yet again; something that threatened to become a recurring problem in her fourth year, for various reasons. This time, she had fought with Potter about whether he has a pet dog that he kept trying to slip into the Common Room. Amidst his and Black's snickering she had flown off to the nearest loo, intending to calm down before class. As soon as she realized how late she was going to be, she had taken off at a sprint.</p><p>Unfortunately, her timing meant the third years were coming out as she was making her way through the halls, forcing Lily to work to get through</p><p>"Excuse me. Pardon me. Lookout! Sorry, so sorry. I just—excuse me!"</p><p>It took her a bit to make it even close to the door to Charm’s class, and just as she was making a lunge through the end of the crowd she ran head first into someone else, knocking him to the floor.</p><p>"Sorry, so sorry!"</p><p>Lily reached down to help pull him up, only to be greeted with a scowl as he jerked his hand away and picked himself up. It was then she registered the green insignia on his robe as he tried to straighten it.</p><p>The boy sneered at her in disgust. "Aren't you that mudblood that hangs out with my brother?"</p><p>Before she could answer, he shoved past her, knocking his shoulder against hers in his rush to get away.</p><p>"I don't need help from scum like you."</p><p>Lily reached for the doorknob dumbfounded and in tears as she slipped into the back of Professor Flitwick's class.</p><p align="center">*****</p><p>It had been a long day of dealing with people, and Regulus Black was thankful for the chance to get some of his frustration that night out on the Quidditch pitch during practice. He had spent a bit of extra time flying about—darting around the stands and between the goal hoops—before landing and heading off to the showers.</p><p>It was oddly quiet when he entered. Usually, at least one of his teammates would still be finishing up, but tonight the locker room was dark and empty. It didn't phase Regulus at all—he was used to the dark and comfortable being alone—but still turned up the lights before heading to the showers.</p><p>He didn't notice it at first, spending a good five minutes just standing under the water as it rushed over him, but as he went to wash his chest he noticed a blood—red flowing script there that he'd never seen before.</p><p>As he registered what it said, he threw up in the shower before throwing on his clothes and storming off to his dorm.</p><p align="center">*****</p><p>Lily was tired. Between her fight with Potter and running into Black's younger brother, she had spent the rest of the day short tempered, causing her to snap at everyone and everything that even mildly annoyed her. She decided she needed to go up to bed after she yelled at Remus before realizing he was just offering her some chocolate. She had apologized before taking it from him and headed upstairs.</p><p>Lily was munching on the sweet now as she changed into her pyjamas, focusing so hard on its taste that she didn't even notice her room—mates come in.</p><p>"What the—hey, Lily…?" Ariana began, a concerned look in her voice.</p><p>"Yes, what is it now?" Lily grumbled as she pulled her shirt on and moved to button it, still not wanting to deal with people.</p><p>"It's your chest!" Jo examined excitedly. "How long have you had your Soulmate mark?"</p><p>Puzzled, Lily dropped her gaze towards her heart. Clear as day, she noticed the words 'Sorry, so sorry,' written there in a firm, precise handwriting she didn’t recognize.</p><p>"The fuck is that!" Lily almost screamed, trying to rub the mark off with no luck.</p><p>"I told you, it's a Soulmate mark!" Jo reiterated with a slight eye-roll.</p><p>The two Muggle born witches looked at her thoroughly confused.</p><p>"It's a mark—"</p><p>"Yeah, we got that part," muttered Ariana.</p><p>"—that appears when you first speak to your Soulmate. It records the first words you ever say to them."</p><p>"Ooo! Tell us, tell us!" Ariana insisted, "who's the lucky person!"</p><p>"I—I'm not sure," Lily admitted. "I was pushing through a bunch of third years trying to get to Charms class and I said that to so many of the students."</p><p>An unbidden thought came to Lily's mind. She couldn't remember exactly what she had said when she slammed into Black's brother. But surely it wasn't him? She decided not to mention him as a possibility to the other two witches. Knowing full and well that if she did, it would be broadcasted around the dorm, and half the school in a matter of days. No, it was heaps better if she kept that to herself and hopefully in time forget all about it.</p><p>Surely it wasn't him...</p><p align="center">*****</p><p>It had been over a year since that fateful day, and nothing Regulus did would remove the mark. He had ceased showering in the locker rooms, changing with the curtains open in his dorm room, or anything that might let someone see his chest. As hard as it was to avoid people at Hogwarts, though, being home at Grimmauld Place had been worse. He even had to swear Kreacher to secrecy — a risky move because he wasn’t sure that the house elf would be able to keep such a thing from his parents — his rightful and current masters — but it was necessary to see if his magic might work.</p><p>Poor Kreacher had become quite upset when he couldn’t find a way to help him. Not just with the mark, but also because it insinuated that his young master was destined to be with a mudblood. That alone was apparently more than enough incentive for him to not let Master Orion and Mistress Walburga find out at any cost.</p><p>They had created a little system when he was home — a series of knocks that would let Regulus know when the coast was clear to get to and from the bathroom, extra house elf magic to keep his bedroom door from opening as easily, or on rare occasions creating a distraction that blocked the other members of the family in such a way they could blame Kreacher for just being old and clumsy.</p><p>Regulus was currently sitting on the edge of his bed, waiting for the signal to say he could make his way to the shower without being bothered. It didn’t take long before the familiar knock—knock, knock knock KNOCK, knock—knock echoed into the room.</p><p>He grabbed his clothes, opened the door and was immediately greeted with the familiar sounds of yelling. Even over Christmas break, he had to ward his room heavily to keep the sound out. It seemed this time his brother was quarrelling with their mother over yet another scantily-clad mudblood poster plastered onto his wall. Regulus shook his head and made his way down the hall to the bathroom.</p><p>It didn’t take him long to do his morning routine, and he had just finished towel drying his hair when he noticed his shirt must have fallen from his grasp in his haste to get to the loo unnoticed. Cursing, he threw on the rest of his clothes and wrapped a towel around his shoulders before tentatively poking his head out the door.</p><p>He had almost made it back to his room when Sirius came storming up the stairs. In his haste, Regulus couldn’t tell if he had run into his brother or if Sirius had knocked him down, but what he did realize was that his towel had flown off in the process.</p><p>Sirius had a look of shock at first before he pulled up his brother and dragged him into his room, grabbing his wand off his dresser and casting a silencing spell as he did.</p><p>“What in Merlin’s name is that?” the older Black demanded as soon as the room was secured.</p><p>“I don’t see any reason I need to tell you that.”</p><p>“Alright, then I will just tell Mother and Father—”</p><p>“No!” Regulus insisted. “Anything but that.”</p><p>“Fine. Then tell me exactly why ‘Aren't you that mudblood that hangs out with my brother?’ is scrawled on your chest in Lily Evan’s handwriting.”</p><p>“Why the bloody hell do you think, you witless lion? It’s a damn Soulmate mark and you know it!”</p><p>“Fair. When did you get it?” Sirius asked, a bit calmer than earlier.</p><p>“Third year. Damn witch slammed into me coming out of charms one afternoon, that’s the only time I’ve ever interacted with her.”</p><p>There was a pause before his brother replied. “I knew Lily might have one — her room-mates are terrible gossipers — but it was easy to dismiss as nonsense as even she seemed to have no clue who she would be tied to.”</p><p>“She’s not.” Regulus explained simply. “There is no way I am soul bonded to such filth. I refuse to accept it. Next thing you know you’ll be telling me that my heirs will be house elves.”</p><p>He watched as Sirius rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Lily’s actually quite nice — if you don’t get on her bad side. She’s smart as a whip too, and a spectacular spell caster. Much better than most Pureblood wizards I’ve met. It’s easy to see why James has the hots for her.”</p><p>“Then he can have her,” Regulus spat. “I will not sully our house with such rubbish. Now, are you going to let me get dressed or continue to ruin my day?”</p><p>“Oh, I doubt that would be much of a problem. I’ve decided to take up James’ offer to move in with him and his parents. I was actually coming up to grab my things and say goodbye.”</p><p>“Honestly, I’m surprised it took you this long. It will be much quieter here without you around for sure.”</p><p>He waited a moment, unsure of whether he should finish out his thought.</p><p>“Maybe even too quiet.”</p><p>Sirius wrapped his brother up in a hug, causing the younger wizard to feel quite awkward at the sudden embrace and more than a little panicked.</p><p>“I knew you’d miss me. There’s always room for one more if you ever come to your senses about all this blood supremacy bullshit. Who knows, I might even be able to put in a good word with Lily for you.”</p><p>“Do that,” Regulus informed him with an icy glare, “and I will personally unleash a hell-storm of hexes on you upon my return from winter break.</p><p>Sirius let go of him and backed up slowly with his hands held in front of him like a shield. “Okay, okay, I won’t. But you’d be surprised how much you’d like her if you gave her a chance.”</p><p>Regulus scowled silently as he grabbed his towel and wrapped it around his shoulders before shoving past his brother in search of a shirt.</p><p>“Oh, Regulus — one more thing before I go.”</p><p>With one hand on the knob to his room, he turned to release one final glare at his brother.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Take care of all the pin-up posters for me, yeah? I doubt Mother will be able to get rid of them quite as easily as she got rid of me.”</p><p>Regulus just shook his head in disbelief before heading into his room and slamming his door.</p><p align="center">*****</p><p>It was the first Slug Club meeting after winter break and Lily couldn’t be happier. Feasts at Hogwarts were delicious, but Slughorn’s parties could always somehow top them. She also enjoyed the diversity of different houses coming together— mostly. More than once she had wondered whether certain members of the group would have been invited had the host not been the head of Slytherin House. At least at these dinners, they tended to curb most of the hostility they typically directed towards her. Any other time Emma Vanity, and that damn Black boy would be sneering together and calling her the most hurtful of names, but here they would be somewhat civil to her and the other Muggle borns.</p><p>She had had some difficulty locating her dress robes — finally finding them at the bottom of her trunk with the rest of the clothes her mother had washed and still needed unpacking — and as such was ever so slightly behind getting ready. She wouldn't be late, but she wouldn't be early either.</p><p>Racing through the halls towards the dungeons she managed to arrive just as her professor was setting out his unique hourglass.</p><p>"Ah, Miss Evans, do come in. You are just in time."</p><p>She smiled in acknowledgement of his words before scanning the room for empty seats. Most were already taken, and what was left didn't fill her with delight. There was one between Sev and Professor Slughorn and another next to Black. She was torn and could see the look in Sev’s eyes pleading with her to take the seat next to him, but she was stubborn and still wouldn’t forgive him for what he had called her. So in the end, she considered the lesser of two evils, and squeezed in between Regulus and a Hufflepuff boy she didn’t remember seeing there before. Sev looked heartbroken, but Lily almost didn’t care at this point.</p><p>Though as sad as Severus had looked, Black seemed much more uncomfortable. For the life of her—she had no idea why, but she scarcely had time to think about it before Professor Slughorn addressed the group.</p><p>“Attention, everyone. I wanted to thank all of you for coming tonight. You can all see we have a few new faces at the table tonight. Let’s see, ah yes, most of you probably don’t know Flume here — Ambrosius Flume.”</p><p>“Hello,” the boy seated next to Lily muttered softly with a slight head bow.</p><p>“And we had one other — ah, yes, here he is.”</p><p>A tall, lanky boy in a green robe sauntered in, the expression on his face unreadable as he took the last remaining seat at the table.</p><p>“Thaddeus Fawly, how good of you to finally make it. Now then, where was I? Ah yes, I hope everyone makes our newest members feel right at home in our little...soiree. And, as always, a toast, to Hogwarts’ best and brightest.”</p><p>Slughorn waved his wand over the table, causing the goblets to fill with liquid. Lily lifted her goblet in unison with the others before taking a sip of perfectly chilled butterbeer.</p><p>Well, almost everyone. She was surprised to see Black’s hand shaking as he reached for his glass,clipping it against his plate when he placed it back down. For someone raised in a high etiquette pureblood household—as she knew he was—she would have assumed he’d be much more fluid in such an environment. Come to think of it, normally he <em> did </em>have a much more regal bearing about him, and she was perplexed at the sudden change.</p><p>Apparently, she wasn’t the only one.</p><p>“Black, my boy, everything alright tonight? You seem a little jumpy.”</p><p>“Everything is fine, Professor,” he replied, a little more clipped than his normal speech. “My apologies if I disrupted dinner. It won’t happen again.”</p><p>“Nonsense, not to worry, not to worry, you haven’t disrupted anything. Though speaking of dinner, I guess we better start then, hadn’t we.”</p><p>A moment later the table was filled with mint jelly lamb, beef wellington, and all sorts of other things Lily had only dreamed of trying as a child. She knew others at the table had feasted on such things most of their lives, but to her it was almost a magic in and of itself. She savoured each bite of her meal, barely remembering to add to the rotating discussion around the table.</p><p>Despite what he had told Professor Slughorn, Black was contributing even less than she was. She knew it wasn’t because he was enjoying his food like she was—in reality, he seemed to barely eat, sliding what food he had on his plate back and forth with his fork.</p><p>Black jumped particularly high as she accidentally grazed his arm when she reached for more potatoes, spoon dropping from his hand and startling everyone enough to look their way.</p><p>Lily braced herself, expecting a slew of obscenities directed at her for touching him, but it never came. He merely breathed in heavy , reached to refill his drink, and turned a cold shoulder towards her. Something about it stung, and she had no idea why. There was no reason for her to seek any kind of interaction with him, yet this lack of one somehow hurt deep inside her chest. Unless...no, she had told herself long ago that there was no way Black could be her Soulmate, and chastised herself for even thinking of such nonsense again.</p><p>Instead, she busied herself by talking to the charming young boy beside her, intrigued on how he planned to open a candy store one day, and their mutual interest in chocolate. Lily was so caught up in conversation with him, she made it through both the rest of dinner and her dessert without realizing it, and was almost sad to end it.</p><p>“Alright now, settle down everyone,” Professor Slughorn called over the table. “We are going to try something new for next dinner.” He waved his wand as the stack in front of him and it spread out in front of each person.“You will note the quills and paper in front of you. Now, before you leave tonight, I want you all to write down something you would like to be served at our dinner in February . I’m rather curious to see what all of you decide on.”</p><p>Lily reached for her paper and quickly wrote down—treacle tart, before placing down her quill. She quietly glanced around the table as everyone else finished contemplating their choices. Her gaze involuntarily came to rest last upon Black’s paper as he began writing.</p><p>She watched in horror as a firm and precise handwriting wrote a single word.</p><p>Sorbet.</p><p>Everything in her world halted as she stared unblinkingly at those letters—so familiar to her and yet so foreign. Tears tried to form as she was forced to realize what she had feared for so long.</p><p>“Professor, if you would excuse me, I—um—I’m not feeling well all of a sudden. Too much pie I’m afraid.”</p><p>“I understand Miss Evans. Thank you for coming. Run along and I’ll see you in class on Monday.”</p><p>As she stood to leave, her eyes locked with Black’s. In a moment of clarity she could tell he also knew, as he broke away from her glare, swore under his breath, and crumpled the offending paper in front of him.</p><p>Lily all but ran from the room, taking off in a full sprint as tears began to stream from her face. Sad, almost forlorn tears at first that turned more into hot angry ones with each slap of her feet against stone. By the time she had entered the Gryffindor Common Room, the red head was fuming.</p><p>“YOU!” she screamed, pointing towards where Potter and Black were sitting over a chess game with such fury that everyone in the near vicinity jumped and cleared from her path.</p><p>“Look, Lily, I can explain,” Potter began, standing up into a defensive position as she charged towards them. “ I don’t know what I did, but—”</p><p>“Not you!” she snapped, “HIM!”</p><p>Grabbing Black by the necktie, she dragged him towards the portrait hole, one brave Gryffindor managing to get out a cat—call before earning a glare that sent the poor boy scurrying to his room, but Lily had bigger problems to deal with.</p><p>She pulled him down the hall and threw him into the first empty classroom she came to before she let loose of his tie.</p><p>“Lily, what the? I’m flattered, but you aren’t exactly my type...”</p><p>Another look from Lily and he was silenced.</p><p>“I need to ask you a question,” she finally calmed down enough to say.</p><p>“Al—alright. What?”</p><p>“It’s about your brother. I assume you can recognize his hand writing, yeah?”</p><p>“A pretty good assumption as I have seen it pretty much my entire life,” he chuckled.</p><p>Lily swore under her breath, causing Black recoil further away as if he was expecting to be hit.</p><p>Slowly, she started undoing her dress robe to pull down her collar before Black reached out to stop her.</p><p>“There’s no need to show me — I already know my brother’s script is across your chest.”</p><p>She gasped before slapping him hard across the face.</p><p>“Why you cheeky, perverted—”</p><p>“No, you don’t understand — it’s not like that, I swear! I only know because I saw yours on his chest a few days ago.”</p><p>“You knew — and you didn’t tell me!”</p><p>“Well, I thought — most people know at least who they were talking to when their mark shows up, so why wouldn’t you?”</p><p>“It’s — complicated,” she admitted as she slumped down into a nearby chair.</p><p>“Tell you what, how about you tell me your side of the story, and I won’t blab about this all over the school, okay?”</p><p>Lily scowled, momentarily debating actually slugging him in the face.</p><p>“Okay, so I won’t do that, but please, in all sincerity — can you tell me anyway? I might be able to help.”</p><p>She paused in thought a moment, weighing in her mind how badly she needed to confide in someone against how likely he would be to laugh with Potter about this in the common room later.</p><p>“Alright — but just because I need to get it off my chest, okay?”</p><p>He nodded, but didn’t say anything as he twirled a chair around and sat facing her in it.</p><p>“I was running late to charms back in fourth year — late enough I had to wade through a whole group of third years coming out of the classroom as I got close. I must have apologized to over a dozen of students that day, the last one being when I slammed into your brother and knocked him to the ground.”</p><p>“That explains what was on his chest…”</p><p>“I honestly don’t remember what he said to me, only that it hurt.”</p><p>“Well, he asked if you were the girl that hung out with me, but...he didn’t call you a girl.”</p><p>“What did he call me then?”</p><p>“Merlin’s beard, witch!” he exclaimed with a bit of fear on his face. “I saw what you did to Snivellus when he called you that — I’m not about to mutter in front of you — or anyone for that matter!”</p><p>Lily tried to rage a moment before falling forward in her chair, sobbing. Without missing a beat, she felt an arm around her shoulders as Black moved beside her.</p><p>“Hey, hey there, what’s wrong?”</p><p>“What’s wrong?” she managed to get out between sobs. “What’s wrong is my Soulmate hates me — hates everything about me — and he has a constant reminder of it on his chest. And now I know that I’ve got a Pureblood elitist’s writing on my chest for all time.”</p><p>“Well, not necessarily all time — they are supposed to disappear if you fall in love with one another.”</p><p>Lily tensed, causing Black to leg go of her.</p><p>“Like that will ever happen,” Lily grumbled quietly.</p><p>“He’s not <em> all </em> bad,” Black insisted. “I mean, sure, he’s a prick, a bit obsessed with Voldemort and blood supremacy, but he’s also loyal to a fault, a bit brilliant, not quite as handsome as me but passable, pretty damn courageous for someone not in Gryffindor, and — I’m not selling him very well, am I?”</p><p>Lily was shaking in sobs at this point, and was grateful when Black gripped her shoulders to keep her upright.</p><p>“Though I would like to ask — you told me how you got your mark, but not how you figured it out it was my brother. What happened tonight?”</p><p>“It was at the Slug Club dinner. Slughorn asked us to write down what we would like to have to eat at our next meeting and he wrote down sorbet.”</p><p>He looked at her like a confused puppy for a moment before she realized he didn’t understand. </p><p>“My Soulmate mark says ‘Sorry, so sorry!’ on it.” </p><p>His face fell, the expression somewhere between anger and concern, only changing as she began to chuckle like a mad woman.</p><p>“Imagine, both of us being cursed with things that remind us of how wretched our Soulmates are to us — him having the constant reminder of what filth he was marked with and me, forever seeing mine as an apology to him for what I am in his eyes — nothing more than a stupid mud—”</p><p>“Hey — don’t call yourself that! You aren’t mud or filth or anything his lot has called you — you are just as much a part of this world as James and I are, and don’t you ever consider it to be otherwise, okay? I’ll personally hex you if you try to call yourself that again.”</p><p>“Thanks...Sirius,” she smiled faintly, trying the new name out for the first time.</p><p>“Don’t mention it, Lily. Now, why don’t we head back before James starts telling everyone we’re off snogging or some such.”</p><p>A laugh — a real laugh — escaped her lips as she wiped away her tears before following her classmate — and newfound friend — back to their common room.</p>
