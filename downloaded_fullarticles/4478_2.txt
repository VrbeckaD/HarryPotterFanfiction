    <p>Sundays were made for staying in your pajamas and wasting the day away by laying around, doing absolutely nothing. You couldn’t think of a better way to spend such a rainy, dark day. Snuggled up in your favorite sweatshirt with the coziest socks you could find, which somehow actually belonged to Remus, you were perfectly content. </p>
<p>Except, you were missing the vital piece that would make this day picture perfect. Your boyfriend.</p>
<p>Remus had rushed out of the apartment at around nine, pressing a quick kiss to your cheek before bolting out the door without a word of where he was going. You were a little disappointed, as Sundays had always been a day for just you and him. Nevertheless, you let him go without a fight. He was allowed to do his own thing, after all, even if you wanted all of his attention. </p>
<p>Getting bored with the show you had been watching for the last few hours, you got up from your seat on the couch and started to roam around the small studio apartment. </p>
<p>It was only two rooms - the main living area and then the bathroom. Three if you counted the overcrowded closet. The bed you and Remus shared was pushed into the back corner, separated from the rest of the room with an old tapestry you had found in a trunk in your old common room. You often joked that it was a cave. The couch, along with a small TV and shelves containing miscellaneous objects, was closest to the window which gave view of the street below. The kitchen was small, with hardly enough room for a single person to cook a meal comfortably. </p>
<p>It wasn’t anything special, really, but it was home. A home you had created with the person you loved the most. What else could you possibly ask for?</p>
<p>You stood at the window for a moment, watching the rain roll down the glass like tears down wet cheeks. Everything looked beautiful when it rained, you thought. Maybe it was just the calming affect the weather gave you, but you would argue with anyone who said otherwise.</p>
<p>Just as you were about to turn away and go back to your show, a flash of movement caught your eye. There was a person running down the sidewalk, and you instantly recognized the gray beanie and worn out flannel. A smile flew onto your face, a small chuckle falling from your lips. You shook your head as you watched him jog up the steps to the building, disappearing inside a moment later. </p>
<p>You reached for your wand laying on the shelf, and with a flick of your wrist, soft music began to fill the apartment. Only seconds later, you heard a key in the lock, and footsteps make their way into the apartment as your boyfriend had finally returned. However, you kept your back to him, letting you gaze linger on the storm outside. </p>
<p>You could hear him shed his coat, shaking the water from it briefly before throwing it over the hook on the wall. He padded over to where you were still stood, swaying slightly to gentle song, and wrapped his arms securely around your waist. He bent down, burying his head into your neck as he began moving with you. You chuckled as his slight stubble tickled you.</p>
<p>“Hello, darling,” he mumbled against your skin, punctuating his greeting with a soft kiss.</p>
<p>“Hello, m’love,” you said in return, twisting in his arms in order to give him a proper kiss. “Enjoy your afternoon out?”</p>
<p>Remus looked almost sheepish for a moment before he nodded. “I was visiting with the boys. Lily let James out of the house for once.”</p>
<p>You rolled your eyes in response, earning yourself a small chuckle. </p>
<p>You broke your embrace with the man in front of you, dragging your hands along his arms as you dropped them, but something was missing. You raised an eyebrow, grabbing hold of his wrist to inspect it. “Honey, where’s your watch? I know you had it on this morning, you never leave the house without it.”</p>
<p>“I dropped it off to get the battery replaced,” he spoke quickly, a small blush growing across his pale cheeks. </p>
<p>You looked at him skeptically for a moment before letting go of his arms, enabling him to dry off and change into some comfier clothes for the rest of the night in. Upon glancing at the clock, you saw it was nearly time for dinner. How had it gotten so late?</p>
<p>You moved into the kitchen area, pulling out one of the two pots you owned and upon looking at the contents of your fridge and cabinets, opted to make a chicken fried rice. </p>
<p>You were rarely able to treat Remus to an extravagant dinner. Most nights, it was some sort of rice or pasta and a vegetable, but neither of you complained. At least you were both fed, and not going to bed hungry. </p>
<p>Remus emerged from behind the tapestry, pulling his sweater on the rest of the way. You smiled at the sight of him. You always loved the way he looked in sweats.</p>
<p>“Can I help?” he asked while approaching the counter that also acted as your only eating space. He pulled out one of the bar stools, taking a seat as he watched you work.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” you chuckled upon seeing him lounge back, “did you actually want to?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely not.”</p>
<p>“Probably for the best. You’d totally ruin it and we’d be eating a jar of pickles instead.”</p>
<p>The food didn’t take long, and it took even less time to eat. You didn’t tell Remus that you let him have all of the chicken; he would’ve argued and insisted on giving you half. </p>
<p>It was pitch black outside now, and the music you had been listening to played on while you and Remus had been spread out on the floor, reliving stories of your days at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>“-and then the time that you and James raced around the castle, and you knocked him off of his broom and into the lake.”</p>
<p>“Or that time you and Sirius charmed all of the statues to follow Filch around one night.”</p>
<p>Both of your heads were thrown back in laughter, your sides aching in the best way possible. You didn’t have a care in the world as you lay there beside one another. </p>
<p>Remus rolled onto his side, propping himself up on his arm as he smiled at you - looking into your eyes as if they held entire galaxies just waiting to be explored.</p>
<p>“Dance with me,” he whispered, not giving you a chance to answer before he stood, pulling you along with him. </p>
<p>You let out a small chuckle as you wrapped your arms around his neck while his moved to your waist just as a new song began to play; Can’t Help Falling in Love by Elvis Presley. </p>
<p>Never breaking eye contact with Remus, you softly sang along. Tears sprang to your eyes at all of the love displayed in his own. You had never felt so deeply for another person before, and you were sure you would never feel this way for anyone else. You couldn’t picture a life without him in it. </p>
<p>Remus leaned forward, pressing his forehead to yours as you both swayed to the gentle music. </p>
<p>He closed his eyes, taking in a deep breath before speaking a muffled phrase. You furrowed your eyebrows, sure you hadn’t heard him right. “Remus wha-”</p>
<p>“I said marry me,” he whispered once more, opening his brilliant green eyes to meet your own. </p>
<p>He removed one of his hands from around your waist, pulling a small object out of his pocket. You gasped at the sight. There was no box, but in his hand stood a small silver band with single round cut diamond. Your hand flew to your mouth as the earlier tears returned. </p>
<p>“I had this whole big, romantic plan but…I-I just couldn’t wait. I know it’s not much, but-”</p>
<p>“It’s perfect,” you interrupted, tearing your gaze away from the ring to look back up at the man before you, “absolutely perfect.” </p>
<p>He smiled down at you, placing a tender kiss to the end of your nose. “So it’s a yes, then…?”</p>
<p>“Of course it’s a yes.”</p>
<p>And with that, Remus lifted you into his arms and began pressing sloppy kisses to any piece of visible skin he could reach. You giggled, keeping your arms hooked securely around his neck as he twirled you around. </p>
<p>Now, you didn’t have to picture a life without him in it.</p>
