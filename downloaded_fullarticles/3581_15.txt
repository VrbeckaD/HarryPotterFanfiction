    <p>Contrary to the belief of James and Lily, Remus did, in fact, know, Sirius was a player. The smell of someone else on his clothes, the palpable tension that comes from when their now alone, the strange disappearances he often resulted to. Of course, there's also the obvious marks that mar his skin that he displays, like a new tattoo he acquired. Remus also pretends to not know James called him out on it.</p><p>His boyfriend of four years. His friend since childhood. With Sirius now display of obvious cheating, Remus was left puzzled on how to approach the subject. That wasn't to say it didn't fucking <em>hurt</em>, what he was doing. But it's not like it had surprised Remus. He should have expected it really. From the years of high school and university, Sirius was always a player. What Remus didn't expect in his life, was carrying a life-threatening disease.</p><p>The news was broken to him after the heart attack. It ended in a blur of tests, and diagnoses, when he finally left the hospital, only to be faced with the concerned faces of his childhood friends. James, Lily, Peter and of course, Sirius stood around in the waiting room, frantically asking questions. He vaguely answered questions and gave reassurances. Conveniently skimming over the fact that he had a newly diagnosed heart disease.</p><p>Sirius and him went home after that, heavy silence filling the car-ride back, not letting up even when they arrived at their shared apartment. Sirius eventually asked if he was really okay to be home, and Remus continued to dodge questions related to his hospital visit. When they finally went to bed, he pointedly didn't mention the reek of alcohol on Sirius, and feigned sleep, pretending not to notice when his partner slipped out in the middle of the night. His heart squeezed painfully, the heat from Sirius side of the bed, now made Remus feel hauntingly cold.</p><hr/><p> Remus turns over, glancing at the still empty side of the bed, sighing deeply the numbing feeling in his chest slowly spreading. The light spreading throughout the open windows gives the bedroom a rather calming feel. The pretty morning light reaching out through the room should have given him some sort of peace. Instead, the only thing he feels is a dull ache in his chest. Now whether that was from a heart that was broken or sick was up for debate. He sighs deeply once more before trudging his way out of bed, having previously made plans with Lily for tea. The sooner he was out of this hellish and empty apartment he called his home, the better.</p><p>Arriving at the Potter's home took more out of him than he would have liked. The short walk to their residences winded him, he had to take long gulps of air, trying to get more oxygen into his lungs. The signs of his newly discovered disease should have been more obvious. Realizing his heart wasn't pumping enough blood to meet his body's needs, made him shudder involuntarily.</p><p>As he regained his breathing, he gave a swift knock on the door, meeting Lily's smiling face not long after. She embraced him quickly, relief flooding her dainty features as she pulled him into another hug, her growing stomach making it a little awkward.</p><p>“Well, hi to you too.” He joked, “I'm fine Lils,” Remus assured, pulling away and giving her a grin.</p><p>“You worry me so, Remus.” Lilly scolded, ushering him inside and into the living room he was so well acquainted with. She already had the tea ready, a china tea set she was rather fond of sat on the coffee table. It was one of the things he learned about Lily in their years of friendship, she was surprisingly girly. Not to say it was a bad thing, just surprising for her fiery personality.</p><p>“Now, now, that can't be good for the little Prongslet,” Remus tutted in reply, making himself comfortable on the well-used couch.</p><p>She grinned in reply, placing a dainty hand on her stomach before sitting beside Remus. Lily had filled the two cups with tea, placing two sugars in Remus', and only cream in her own. She took a small sip before glancing back at Remus, a pitying look crossing her features and a frown etching its way onto her face.</p><p>Remus simply placed the cup down, crossing his arms, “What is it now? I already told you I was fine to leave the hospital.”</p><p>“Why are you still with him?” She inquired suddenly, determination now breaking through in her voice.</p><p>His resolve faltered for a moment, fear flickering through him for a brief moment. He shook his head, replying in a quiet voice, “You know why.”</p><p>Lily shook her head as well, taking a sip of her tea, “It's not right. You deserve someone who doesn't-”</p><p>“It's fine, Lily.” Remus quickly cut her off, not wanting to hear the words and face the reality of them. “I don't want to date anyone else.” <em>I don't want to date anyone but him.</em> Was left unsaid, but they both thought it. The conversation was steered to something more pleasant after that, talk of the new baby that would soon be in their midst, well, not Remus'. He tried not to dwell on that thought. They continued to talk throughout the afternoon, Remus only noticing how late it had gotten when James had come home, greeting him with a brotherly hug, and a soft press of lips to Lily. Remus also tried not to dwell on when was the last time he and Sirius did that. </p><hr/><p>A week had passed, Remus avoiding Sirius like the plague. Not that it was rather difficult, considering the man was never home. Excuses of visiting old high school friends, and trying to repair his relationship with Regulus. Nevertheless, Remus took the appropriate precautions, not wanting his resolve of silence to break if they were in the same room for too long. He had learned that the hard way, remembering a fight they had, and Sirius pleading for forgiveness, which ended in words he never wanted to say being said, and make-up sex that he heavily regretted later.</p><p>But as the week passed, it was littered with doctors appointments and consultations. Remus sat on the tall, plastic bed, absently swinging his legs back and forth. He had explained the intense history of heart disease that ran in his family, to his doctor. He was a strange man, his doctor. Sort of short and stubbly, his voice normally would have grated on Remus to no end, but he simply didn't seem to care as his Doctor, - Doctor. Binns, his brain helpfully supplied, droned on.</p><p>“Sadly the case with CAD, is there is no cure as of yet.” Binns went on, “It has a death-rate of over 385,000 people in the US each year.”</p><p>Remus just nodded, words not fully processing. The doctor looked down at his clipboard, neatly organized files that contained Remus results stacked on top.</p><p>“To really break down this disease for you,” Binns said, a grimace making its way onto his face, “So, the small blood vessels that supply the heart with oxygen and blood, become narrowed and blocked, so your heart is receiving less blood. When this happens, the heart must work harder to supply the vital organs, straining your heart, which led to your heart attack, you see.”</p><p>Again, Remus nodded, the words swimming around his head. Death-rate. No cure.</p><p>“Now the good news,” Doctor Binns spoke up again, dragging Remus from his thoughts. “Is that there are some drugs and medical procedures that can be taken.”</p><p>He said nothing, his head still swimming. Remus felt completely numb, he couldn't feel his body. The words 'death' and 'incurable' repeating over and over in his head.</p><p>“Mr. Lupin?”</p><p>Remus' head shot up, staring wide-eyed at Binns as if he just realized he was in the room. “I-” his voice cracked, and he quickly cleared his throat. “No, I don't. I don't think I'd like to take any more drugs.</p><p>The rest of the appointment went by in a haze, he only remembers Binns talking about the specific medical procedures he could go through, all to help improve blood flow, one has to keep him hospitalized. Remus continued to refuse any treatment.</p><hr/><p>Somehow, Remus had made his way to their apartment. Sirius wasn't there, no surprise. He shrugged off his jacket and shoes, before flopping down on the bed. Pulling the cover over his head, his thoughts finally caught up with him. It was a lot to process. He had a heart disease. Okay. He had a incurable heart disease. Reasoning, he could spend all his money on said drugs and operations that have a possibility to help. Remus sighed heavily, spending all his money on a possible failure didn't seem like the best option.</p><p>The tightness in his chest made him take a few ragged breaths, distracting him from the thoughts of how he never noticed his ongoing symptoms. The pain in his chest only worsening, making Remus give into exhaustion and slipping into a fitful sleep.</p><hr/><p>The next following days, their group was supposed to hang out. James had finally gotten a day off, which prompted him to make the group go out, he had been complaining about wanting to go bowling, and so there they were. Peter sitting next to Lily, who looked closer and closer to popping, her stomach getting larger by the day. James was excitedly going around, looking at which bowling ball he wanted. And then there was Sirius, who still <em>wasn't</em> here.</p><p>Remus and him had eventually been at their apartment together one night, the exchange tense and harsh. Sirius giving indirect replies to what he's been up to, and Remus dodging questions on his doctors' appointments. So came the settled agreement that Sirius would show up after meeting with Regulus. As if he truly believed that obvious lie.</p><p>However; true to their agreement, Sirius eventually came. Two games in, looking thoroughly pleased. His hair was sticking up as if someone was running his or her hands through it, and his clothes were rather wrinkled. Remus wanted to pin the painful squeezing of his heart on his disease. Remus also wanted to pin the worried glance Lily sent him on anything else than the obvious.</p><p>“Prongs!” Sirius cheered, throwing an arm around him, grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>Said male looked Sirius up and down, anger flashing through his eyes so quick, Remus almost thought it wasn't there.</p><p>“<em>Sirius</em>, mate, you're late,” James replied, emphasizing the use of his real name, voice surprisingly tight.</p><p>“Er, yeah, sorry.” He replied, removing his arm from James' shoulder, scratching at the back of his neck sheepishly.</p><p>“S'okay,” Peter replied instead, successfully gaining Sirius attention, trying to steer the tense atmosphere in a more pleasant direction.</p><p>They continued a few more rounds, mainly just Peter, James and Sirius though. Lily sat out after the first round, complaining about it being too tiring, and so Remus left as well, keeping her company on the stools they sat on. She tried to bring the topic of Sirius up, and Remus quickly shot her down, talking about a pesky cat that kept coming back to the apartment. As the day continued on, Remus and Sirius hardly interacted, only talking tensely when needed.</p><p>The first mistake Remus made was not coming with Sirius, actively setting James mode off. The second was excusing himself to the bathroom, leaving James and Sirius alone. He could hear the yelling from the bathroom still, he sighed heavily, drying off his hands before making his way back to their table.</p><p>“Why the hell are you texting someone else? You're dating <em>Moony</em>!” James screamed in Sirius' face. They were both standing, James had Sirius phone in his hand, holding it so tightly his knuckles were turning white. Lily sat idly, pursing her lips and crossing her arms, while Peter stood on the sidelines, hands up as if trying to diffuse his two friends.</p><p>“Oh wow, thanks for pointing that out, I hadn't noticed! Sorry, does that mean I'm just chained to him now?” Sirius retorted, sarcasm dripping from his words.</p><p>Oh no. Oh god. Remus starts to panic, walking faster towards his boyfriend and James, they did not need to be fighting over this.</p><p>“So what? You just don't care now, is that it? So then break up with him, or stop fucking cheating, you asshole!” Yelled James, lunging towards Sirius, the phone forgot on the ground.</p><p>“Jesus, stop it, James!” Remus tore him away from Sirius as he finally got there, Peter then also stepping in and getting in between them as well.</p><p>“No, let go, Remus! How can you let him treat you like-” James was saying, thrashing around against Remus hold, before looking down at him. He went white-faced and instantly clamped his mouth shut. <br/>“Moony..” He said softly, regret marring his features.</p><p>“Just. Drop. It.” Seethed Remus, letting go of James before turning back to Sirius, who was staring at him with an unreadable expression.</p><p>He picked up the now cracked phone before dragging Sirius away by the arm, and out of the bowling alley. They walked in silence through the parking lot, Remus only speaking once for Sirius keys, and Sirius dropping them in his hands without a word. The couple drove in silence to their apartment, the soft murmuring of the radio was the only thing keeping Remus from exploding on Sirius. <br/>The pent-up frustration, the lack of answers, all of the hurt and pain that Sirius had instilled onto Remus was getting to be too much.</p><hr/><p>The two arrived at their apartment, but the walk up their stairwell came to be too much for Remus. He tried to take large breaths, but the lack of oxygen he was getting made him cough, breathing was proving to be very difficult. Remus could only vaguely hear Sirius asking if he was okay over the sound of his own coughing, trying to get oxygen into his lungs.</p><p>He was dragged over to their couch and pushed down onto it, coughs were still wracking his body and tears were gathering at the corner of his eyes because of it. Remus could still feel the calming circles being rubbed into his back from Sirius, and he finally regained control over his breathing. A glass was being pushed up against his lips, and he took several generous gulps.</p><p>“Are you okay now?” Sirius asked, placing the glass down on their coffee table.</p><p>Remus nodded, avoiding his eyes. Shit. How was he going to explain this? Oh yeah, I'm totally good, I just forgot to mention I have a heart disease that could kill me and doesn't have a cure. But I mean, why would you care at this point?</p><p>He laughed bitterly, shaking his head.</p><p>“What, so you're not okay?” He asked, crossing his arms.</p><p>“Oh, no, no. I'm fine.” Remus lied, looking away from Sirius. His chest was aching painfully, as he continued, “So.”</p><p>“So.” Was the distant reply, followed by a large sigh. “Let's break up?”</p><p>Remus again, ignored the painful tightness in his chest, taking a shaky breath, “If you want,”</p><p>His vision was starting to get black spots, and he felt like he couldn't breathe. The pain and tightness in his chest only increased, stress piling higher and higher as the conversation progressed. This was it. It was the end. He let it go for too long, they were breaking up. He was completely losing Sirius for good now. Small glimpses of when they were together flashed through his mind, eating away at his conscious. Remus clenches his teeth, the tightness in his chest only getting worse. Memories of summer days wrapped in each other's arms flash through his mind, the memory blurring, soft touches and muffled laughs the only thing Remus can think of now.</p><p>The distant chanting of his name forgotten in the blackness that surrounds him. The only thing he can feel is the horrible pain in his chest, from his heartbreaking or the blood flow in his heart-stopping, is anyone's guess.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Remus blinked his eyes open, the stark white and fluorescent light an unwelcome change to the comfortable black he was previously surrounded with. The strong scent of chloroform and disinfectant attacked his nose, making him scrunch it up involuntarily. The next thing he noticed was the uncomfortable tube that was stuck in his arm. There were a few wires everywhere actually, and it was then that he noticed the steady beeping of a heart monitor as well.</p><p>Remus glanced around again, taking note of the nurse that was in the corner, scribbling furiously on a clipboard. She glanced up, finally noticing Remus and giving him a kind smile. Her graying hair was tied up in an alarmingly tight bun, Remus noted.</p><p>“The doctor will be here in just a bit, he'll get you all squared away, love.” Said the nurse, before making her way past his bed and onto the next.</p><p>The next few minutes passed by in a general check-up manner. He was explained what happened, what they did to save him, and was asked how he felt. Apparently, Lily was called, as she was on my emergency contact list. He was dreading that particular conversation. Remus only then remembers passing out while Sirius was there, now remembering how he got to the hospital in the first place. Well shit.</p><p>He was given a few minutes before both Lily and Sirius came in, matching expressions of worry on their faces. No one said anything, seconds passing, the only sound being the heart monitors rhythmic beeping. Finally, Lily spoke up, her voice hoarse as if she'd been crying,</p><p>“James and Peter are in the waiting room too, we can't all come in at the same time though.”</p><p>Remus simply nodded, looking down at his hands that were twisted in the thin hospital blanket that was resting over him. Guilt was slowly clawing its way at him, having been caught in his lie. He continued twisting his hands over the rough fabric, his thoughts aimlessly wondering how many people had used this same blanket.</p><p>“When were you going to tell us?” Came Sirius voice, except, his voice was also strangled and gruff like he was swallowing down emotion.</p><p>Remus let out a shaky exhale, hands now grasping the fabric tightly. “So the doctors told you, did they?”</p><p>“When were you going to tell us?!" Sirius repeated, his voice was even more strangled now and it startled Remus into looking up.</p><p>He looked between the two, really taking in their appearances now. Lily's hair was thrashed and it looked like she hadn't slept, he noticed her in the same clothes as yesterday. Remus turned to look over at Sirius and choked down a sob, guilt flooding him. His hair was matted like he hadn't washed it, dark circles were blooming under his eyes, his skin was far too pale and looking over his appearance, Remus finally noticed how skinny Sirius was getting.</p><p>A brief memory of Sirius when he was a teen passed through his mind. Skinny and scared. Remus thinks back to his bad depressive episodes and self-destructive tendencies. When Sirius was damaged, how Sirius is still damaged. Remus can't stop the choked cry that breaks past his lips this time.</p><p>“I'm sorry.”</p><hr/><p>
  <em>“You look upset, Pads.”  Whispered Remus softly, and Sirius just smiled, eyes not leaving the open sky he was currently gazing up at. He wrapped his arms tighter around Remus, enjoying the warmth his lover was radiating.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I'm not,” Sirius answers, removing the book from Remus' hands, holding one of them while combing through Remus' hair with the other. A muffled laugh escapes Remus, head pressed against his lover's chest.</em>
</p><p><em>“As much as you and James think you're good at lying, you truly aren't.” Remus mummers, untangling himself from his clinging boyfriend, much to his displeasure. “Is something wrong? Are you worried about talking to Regulus again?” He inquired, gazing up at Sirus stubbornly.</em><br/> <em>He smiles down at Remus before pulling his boyfriend back into his lap, “I'm just a little stressed is all, Moons.” Came his easy reply, winding his fingers in Remus golden curls again.</em></p><p>
  <em>“Do you want to talk about it?” Pushed the former again, wrapping Sirius free hand into his own.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He sighed, “Not really Rem, I'm okay, I just want to lay here with you.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sirius could feel Remus' worried eyes on him, not wavering in conviction. He doesn't speak, doesn't press any other questions, but continues to look at him, concern etched across his features. Despite the heavy topic of Sirius family at hand, he can't bring himself to worry. Not when the sun is hitting Remus face at that angle, and he's looking at him with such worry and love. The whole scene is just so horribly domestic, that Sirius can't help the lovesick sigh that escapes him as he looks at his lover.</em>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>Remus takes a seat next to Sirius on the couch of the Potter's home. James was over at Lily's, and his parents had gone away to London for the weekend. Sirius had already moved into the Potter's home, almost never talking about the reasons he left, or why he hates talking about his parents. The scars that line Sirius' back brought up a few concerned questions from all of them though.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He scooted closer to Sirius, noticing the strong smell of alcohol on him. He had a bad day today, Remus realized. Sirius had those. A lot of those. Sometimes he could barely get up, and when he did, he would drown in the contents of alcohol, normally in his room, out of sight of the others. When Remus had questioned it one day, Sirius fave the simple reply of 'to drown out the hate.'</em>
</p><p>
  <em>His self-destructive habits only got worse from there.</em>
</p><hr/><p>The next week passes and Remus is still hospitalized. James, Peter, Lily, and Sirius visit regularly. Things didn't magically get better because Remus and Sirius were now talking though. They still hadn't broached the subject of Sirius cheating, regularly, but they were talking. Their playful banter was back, light touches here and there, their relationship was slowly being built back up again.</p><p>James had confronted Sirius again, resulting in more of a one-sided fistfight. Sirius had broken down a few times as well, including the time now. He sat at the side of Remus hospital bed, holding his hand almost painfully tight, not that Remus would have said anything either way though. He was crying, his words spewing out of him like he just couldn't hold them back anymore.</p><p>“I'm sorry, love, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean it. Any of it.” Sirius choked out, “It was always you, Moony. Always. I couldn't think, I didn't know what I was doing. I've always known you were too good for me, always, always. I'm too broken. I'm too fucked up. I'm so sorry. I love you, I love you, I love you.” He repeated, sobs wracking over his body.</p><p>Remus shushed him, dragging his free hand though Sirius hair, absently, trying to calm him. He whispers soft reassurances until he calmed down. Remus doesn't saying anything about it, doesn't confirm if it's okay or not. Doesn't forgive or forget, simply mummers softly,</p><p>“I love you too, Pads.”</p><hr/><p>Hope Lupin visit the next day, for the first time. She broke down the first moment she saw Remus in the hospital bed. Pale, tubes sticking in his arms, and struggling to breathe past the tightness in his chest. It had worsened. Everyone had tried to convince him into getting the surgeries, taking the medicine. Lily had gotten so frustrated she resulted in yelling, becoming so worked up that James had to drag her away to the waiting room. Remus parent was no exception to this convincing. Offering to pay, offering to do anything just to help him. Still, Remus declined, smiling softly at his adoring mother. He felt guilty. She already paid for a plane ticket to fly across the country, just to see him. Remus knew he couldn't ask that of her.</p><p>Hope continued to cry, holding onto Remus as if he was a lifeline. Remus only distantly thought he was going to be leaving his mother the same way his father had. Exhaustion overtook his body again, leaving his mother sobbing, holding onto him.</p><hr/><p>Remus woke once more, the bright lights still as unwelcome as the first time. He was getting sick of this hospital. Of the tubes. Sick of always hearing his heart monitor, hearing it repeatedly beep again and again. Remus was mostly sick of all the pitying glances. Lily and James, Peter, and Sirius always looking at him like he was about to die any second. Well, technically, he was, but that was beside the point. He couldn't stand to see Lily and James give one more shared look to each other. Couldn't stand hearing her talk about the baby, <em>Harry</em>, they had decided on, knowing he wasn't going to be there. He was sick of Sirius constantly saying “I'll see you in the morning, right?” before giving him a terrified look.</p><p>Remus was tired too. Tired of the constant pain in his chest. He was tired of being here now. He was tired of not being able to stay awake for more than an hour. His spiraling thoughts were interrupted by Sirius meekly coming in.</p><p>“Hi, Moony.” He said softly as if raising his voice would break Remus. They intertwined their fingers.</p><p>A soft sigh passed his lips as he traced circles on Sirius' hands, “I love you, Sirius.” He choked out, breathing becoming more and more difficult.</p><p>“Moony?” Sirius asked, his voice was so scared, Remus noted, closing his eyes, just focusing on Sirius' hands. He heard his name being called over, again and again, Sirius voice becoming more and more panicked. The last thing he heard from Sirius was a pleaded 'I love you' before there were doctors and shouting.</p><hr/><p>Remus Lupin didn't last the night and was proclaimed dead at 3:45 AM.</p>
