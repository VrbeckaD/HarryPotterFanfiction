</p><p> </p><p>~31th October 1981</p><p>
  <span>Rose Le Fay. Being a direct descendant of Morgan Le Fay clearly had its advantages. But Rose never claimed the lordship to the Le Fay line. Why? Well for one she wasn't interested in the wizarding world. The intrigues, the fighting for power and wealth and the pureblood supremacy was never to her liking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She always had a soft spot for children, but she only took a child as her ward once. His name was Albus Dumbledore, she had high hopes for him but he still got himself corrupted by power. So to minimise the damage he could do, she obliviated him to forget that he was ever in her care.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After that she never set foot in the wizarding world again, but in the evening of the 31st October 1981 Lady Magic called to her, told her to go to Godric's Hollow. Drawn to the house, she used her magic to make herself invisible. When she was looking inside a window, she was shocked by what she saw. The man who was her ward once stood next to the dead body of a woman and picked up a little boy, he was probably only one year old.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In her shock she only noticed the man in a black robe running inside the room, when Albus turned around and smirked. "It's good you came Tom. I was worried there for a second that you wouldn't come." Tom pointed his wand at the man Rose once saw as her own child. "Put Harry down Dumbledore. This is something between you and me. The Potter's had nothing to do with this. So why did you kill Lily and James?" The pain over the friends he lost was clear in his voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Albus... he just started to laugh. "Something just between the two of us!? No, you are simply my puppet, like Harry here who is going to become one. With the two of you I'm going to rule the wizarding world. With you as the Dark Lord and Harry here as the Boy Who Lived. He's going to kill you, because he will think you killed his parents. And while he’s fighting you, he will die. And I as his loyal and caring mentor will kill you out of revenge. The wizarding world is going to celebrate me, because I freed them of the evil called Lord Voldemort."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why are you telling me this?" "Oh, because you are not going to remember!" And with that Albus Dumbledore cast a spell which separated Tom´s soul from his body, then he split his soul and put each piece into a thing he materialized and vanished them, when the soul piece had been put in it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He vanished the largest soulpiece and placed the smallest piece in Harry. Rose was devastated by what she saw, she believed these spells to be long forgotten, because even though she looked like she was in her late twenties, in reality she was 273 years old. The only prove for Albus' gruesome deed now was the lightning shaped scar on the small toddlers forehead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <br/>
  <span>With this done he set the whole room on fire and apparated. Naturally, Rose followed him.</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <span>But they both didn't notice the man with the flying motorcycle. Who, when he saw the scene before him, Lily and James dead and his godson nowhere to be found, went after the man who he once called friend. Peter Pettigrew. But unknown to him, he was going to be the one blamed for James and Lily Potter's death.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>The place Rose landed was Number 4, Privet Drive, Little Whinging. When she focused on Albus, she saw him placing the toddler in a basket  at the front door with only a thin blanket and a letter. Then he turned around, not even knocking at the door and apparated . "Does he want the boy to die?", was the thought that crossed Rose's mind before she made a decision. She took the boy and apparated to her home.</span>
