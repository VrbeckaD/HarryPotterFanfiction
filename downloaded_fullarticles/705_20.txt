    <p>"You know, this is why a lot of people don't like you," Harry said to his husband Draco one night. They had just gotten back from Ron and Hermione's house. It killed Harry that his husband and his best friends had trouble getting along. And even though Harry loved Draco with everything in his heart, he knew that more than half of the time, it was Draco's fault. </p><p>"You like me and that's all that matters," Draco said. </p><p>"It's not all that matters, though." Harry said. "It matters to me that you try to get along with Ron and Hermione more." </p><p>Draco shrugged, unconcerned. </p><p>"This isn't your parents house anymore, Draco." </p><p>"What's that supposed to mean?" Draco asked. </p><p>"It means, you were spoiled rotten by your parents. You ruled over Malfoy Manor with all your desires and whims and your parents catered to them. That's not how it should be in our house, in our relationship. You go over to my friends house, and you act like you're the king. You order them around, complain about their meals, and it's not very nice. You never learned how to be nice." </p><p>"Why have you never told me this bothers you?" </p><p>Harry shrugged. "Dunno. But it's just been building up." </p><p>"You're too soft," Draco shot back. "You let things like this build up and you don't say anything to me. Maybe it's because your Aunt and Uncle made you think that you didn't have any control at all." </p><p>Harry went quiet, "Maybe you're right." </p><p>Draco went to bed that night, thinking about this argument he and Harry had. He knew in his heart of hearts that Harry was right. He was an asshole, and that's because his parents had let him be one his whole life. And now that he was an adult he had no idea how to stop being so selfish. </p><p>A small thought was forming in his head. </p><p>And over the next several days he tried to get the thought out of his head, but it wouldn't go anywhere. It implanted itself in his brain, and like a seed began to germinate until he had a complete picture of how to change, and how to fix his relationship with Harry. </p><p>______________</p><p>"Babe," Draco said one night. They had finished dinner and Harry had done the dishes. They retired to the parlor where Harry was setting up a chess set. "Let's not play chess, there's something I want to talk about." </p><p>"Okay," Harry said, putting the chess set away. "What is it?"</p><p>"You remember the argument we had a few weeks ago, about my attitude, and how my parents spoiled me?" </p><p>"And how I'm too weak because of my Aunt and Uncle?" </p><p>"I think I know how to fix it," Draco said. His voice was tremulous. He was nervous.</p><p>"Oh yeah?" </p><p>"What about domestic discipline?" </p><p>Harry paused, his eyes widened. "You want me to beat you?" </p><p>"No!" Draco said. "It's not like that! I mean, when I act up, when I'm a little shit like I was at Ron and Hermione's that night, you get to discipline me." </p><p>"Discipline you how?" Harry asked, suspicious of Draco's plan. </p><p>Draco shrugged, "That'd be up to you, as the Head of Household. You'd decide what I needed, whether it's corner time or grounding or even spanking." </p><p>"This sounds bizarre." </p><p>"I know it does, but I think it could really work!" Draco said. "I want to be a better person, but being selfish and spoiled is so ingrained in me, I don't know if I can change. And being soft and allowing people to walk all over you is so ingrained in you. It cold help us both!" </p><p>"But....hitting? Isn't that abuse?" </p><p>"Not when I agree to it." </p><p>"Hmmm," Harry said thoughtfully. "I don't know." </p><p>"I'll have a safe-word" Draco said. "In case I think the discipline is going too far." </p><p>"And I would stop when you use the safe word?" </p><p>"Yes. Basically you punish me when I break a rule. I guess we'd have to come up with some rules." </p><p>"I'll think about it." Harry said. </p><p>"That's all I ask."</p><p> </p><p>_______</p><p> </p><p>Several nights later, Harry was laughing nervously. He and Draco were at the kitchen table, a roll of parchment in front of them. "I can't believe we're doing it," he said. "Making rules for you like you're a child." </p><p>"I didn't have rules as a child," Draco pointed out. "And you had too many rules with no control over them. We're just fixing things now. So, what's one thing I do that really bothers you that you want to fix?" </p><p>Harry licked his lips. "I hate that I work outside the home, and you stay home but I still do most of the cooking and cleaning." </p><p>"If we'd get a house elf-" </p><p>Harry cut him off. "No. House elves are slaves and we aren't doing that." </p><p>"All right," Draco said. "Cooking and cleaning. I don't even know how to do that." </p><p>Harry took the parchment and wrote something out. </p><p>They continued to talk a little about Draco's needs and Harry's needs. And finally after a long time, they had a list that looked like this:</p><p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>Harry's rules for Draco:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>1- Every day, Harry will give at least one cleaning chore for Draco to do. It must be done by the time Harry gets home from work. </p>
  <p>2-Harry will choose recipes in a cook book, and Draco must try a new one every day. On Harry's work days, Draco is responsible for dinner. </p>
  <p>3-Draco is to awaken before Harry, and be ready to see him off to work. Monday through Thursday, he is to have a lunch ready for Harry to take. </p>
  <p>4-Draco will have a budget for household supplies, Harry is in charge of doling out money. </p>
  <p>5-Draco gets an allowance for personal items and must not go over his monthly allowance. </p>
  <p>6-Draco is to serve Harry with a happy and servile attitude. </p>
  <p>7-Draco is to respect Harry's ultimate authority in the household and willingly submit to any disciplinary acts that Harry deems necessary. </p>
  <p>8-Draco is to treat all others with respect and kindness, and watch his attitude toward others.</p>
  <p>9-Harry reserves the right to add other rules to the list, but must talk it over with Draco first. </p>
  <p>10-Draco is permitted to get out of discipline with a safeword, which is 'checkmate.' Draco promises to only use it if the discipline is going too far. </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Draco and Harry read over the list. "Starting tomorrow?" Harry asked. </p><p>Draco nodded. "Tomorrow." </p><p> </p><p>_______</p><p>The next day, Harry awoke for work. He got his auror robes on. He walked down stairs to see Draco in the kitchen, hunched over a loaf of bread, trying to get even slices. "Good morning," Harry said. </p><p>"Morning," Draco looked frazzled. "I'm having trouble cutting this bread evenly. I was going to make you a sandwich for lunch." </p><p>Harry kissed Draco on the cheek, "Evenly cut bread with come with practice. I can eat crooked bread." </p><p>Draco looked relieved. He placed a couple of slices of thick turkey onto the bread and added some lettuce and a tomato. He wrapped it in paper, added an apple and a bag of crisps to a bag. He looked proud of himself. "Lunch!" he said proudly. </p><p>"Thank you," Harry said. "I was looking through some of these cookbooks, and I'm going to start easy with you. For dinner tonight you need to learn how to scramble eggs for me. And I think we can have bacon and fruit salad." Harry took some money out of his pocket and handed it to Draco. "Go to the markets today and buy what you need for dinner. I want you to look through the cookbooks and find other things you might want to try. They can be simple until you get the hang of cooking, OK?</p><p>"Yes, Harry." </p><p>"Buy what you think you'll need for the next few days of food." </p><p>"And my household chore?" Draco asked. </p><p>"I think the shopping and planning meals is enough for today." </p><p>"Yes, Harry." </p><p>"Now give me a kiss goodbye." </p><p>Draco gave Harry a kiss, and Harry left for work. </p><p>______</p><p>For the first few days, Draco was impeccable. He was awake early, had Harry's lunches and had managed a few simple dinners. Bacon was a little burnt, and pasta a little under-cooked, but those were learning curves. He'd done a few chores, such as dusting the woodwork, and doing dinner dishes. </p><p>By about day four, the newness had started to wear off and Harry started noticing Draco not being as compliant. He still woke before Harry and still had Harry's lunch ready for him, but it was without a smile. That day over breakfast, Harry said to Draco, "Your chore for today is to clean the toilets. Both bathrooms need to be washed and scrubbed. I noticed the bathtub is getting a ring." </p><p>"Oh no," Draco said. "I'm sorry, but cleaning toilets is disgusting work." </p><p>Harry folded his hands in front of him and looked at Draco intently. "I'm sorry, but who do you think cleaned the toilets before we started our domestic discipline situation?" </p><p>"You did, but I-" </p><p>"But nothing," Harry said sternly. "The toilets need cleaning and you are going to do them." </p><p>"Harry, come on. We've only just begun. Can't I work up to that?" </p><p>"No. It's easy work, Draco and I don't want another word." </p><p>"It's house-elf work," Draco said petulantly. </p><p>"That's it," Harry threw down his napkin and took Draco by the hand and led him to the living room."</p><p>"You're not going to discipline me because I think toilet cleaning is gross!" Draco said, in disbelief. </p><p>"You're breaking two rules right now. You must clean what I say, and you must serve me with a good attitude. Now drop your pants and come here." Harry sat on the couch. </p><p>Draco didn't move, so Harry pointed his wand at Draco and vanished his trousers and underwear. "Come here," he said in a severe voice. </p><p>Draco walked, slightly hunched over toward Harry and lay himself, ass up, over Harry's knees. He could feel Harry trembling and was happy to know that Harry was as nervous about doling out discipline as he was about receiving it. </p><p>"Two spanks for each rule broken. That's a total of four," Harry said, though he was unsure if that was correct. "And, uh, you need to count along, OK Draco?" </p><p>"Yes Harry," Draco said. He braced himself, listening to Harry's deep and nervous breathing. </p><p>Finally Harry raised his hand and it landed with a slap across Draco's backside. "One!" Draco called out. It...actually wasn't that bad." </p><p>Harry must have realized he didn't hit hard enough to make an impression, because the second spank came just a bit harder. "Two!" Draco said. </p><p>The third spank was harder still, and now it was landing on skin that had already taken two hits. Draco's voice caught as he called out, "Three!" </p><p>The fourth and final spank was hardest still and Draco was barely holding back his tears as he said "Four," in a quiet and wobbly voice. </p><p>"Stand up, Draco," Harry ordered. Draco stood rubbing his backside. Harry noticed Draco's cock was at half-mast, which didn't surprise him because his own was already throbbing behind his robes. He'd had no idea that doing this would be such a turn-on. "Go stand in the corner for three minutes," Harry ordered, pointing to a corner of the room. </p><p>"Can't I have pants?" </p><p>"Once your punishment is over," Harry said. "You need to stand there and think about what you've done." </p><p>Draco went to the corner and stood facing it. </p><p>Harry hurried out of the room and made it to their bedroom, pulling up his robes and vanishing his own trousers. He jerked off as fast as he could and came all over the floor. He bit his lip to keep from moaning as semen spilled from the end of his cock. When he was soft again, he quickly brought his trousers back and put them on. He pulled his robes back down and tried to look dignified as he went back into the living room and said to his husband, "You can come from the corner." </p><p>Harry flicked his wands and Draco's trousers and underwear appeared in his hand. He handed them over to Draco who began to dress his bottom half. </p><p>"Well," Harry said. "What do you have to say." </p><p>"I will clean the toilets today," Draco said. "It's my pleasure to serve you." </p><p>"That's better," Harry said. "I'm off to work."</p><p>Draco rushed to the kitchen and grabbed Harry's lunch. "Here's your lunch, Harry." </p><p>"Thank you." Harry leaned in for a kiss, and though their kisses goodbye were usually just a peck on the lips, this one was much more smoldering. </p><p>"Something to look forward to when you get home," Draco said, smiling. </p><p>"I can't wait." </p><p>Harry stepped outside, my God, he hoped Draco would misbehave again soon. </p><p>______</p><p>That night when Harry got home, he inspected both bathrooms and found them to be sparkling. Draco was still working on dinner, whistling a jaunty tune as he whisked a simple sauce for their chicken. </p><p>After dinner, Draco handed Harry a brandy and told him to go relax while he did the dishes. Harry went to the parlor, but couldn't relax. All day at work, he'd wanted to come home and fuck his husband hard. He couldn't stop thinking about the reaction he got whilst spanking Draco. </p><p>When Draco was done the dishes, he joined Harry in the parlor. "Let me see your ass," Harry demanded. </p><p>"What?" </p><p>"I want to know if you're still marked from my spanking this morning." </p><p>Draco grinned slowly, as his hands made their way down his front and to the button of his trousers. He unbuttoned and unzipped, and gods he was going so slowly that Harry knew he was being seduced. Draco started to work his trousers down his hips, but Harry couldn't take the wait. He leaned over and yanked the trousers and underpants beneath down and turned Draco around. His ass was perfect and white - not a mark on it. </p><p>"How long did it hurt?" Harry asked, massaging Draco's ass, and working his hands around the front where he found Draco's cock at nearly fully erect. "Not long," Draco admitted. </p><p>"Maybe it'll have to be harder next time?" Harry asked, with a huskey voice. </p><p>"Unless I'm a good little boy from now on," Draco said. </p><p>"Oh babe," Harry said, giving Draco's cock a light jerk, "We both know that's never going to happen." Harry turned Draco around and planted a smoldering kiss on his lips. "Get naked," Harry demanded. </p><p>Draco quickly vested himself of the rest of his clothes, and Harry did the same. They faced each other, taking in the others' body, all lean muscle and large erections. The fell to the couch together, kissing and fondling the other. Their breath becoming harder, and turning into moans. "I want you to fuck me," Draco said. </p><p>"What's that?" Harry asked. </p><p>"Fuck me, please Harry." </p><p>"Are you serious?" Normally Draco did the fucking and Harry got fucked. It'd been quite a while since Draco allowed himself to be opened for Harry's cock. </p><p>"You're in charge," Draco said. "I want you to really be in charge." </p><p>Harry pulled Draco roughly to the floor, "On your hands and knees," he said in his most demanding voice. </p><p>Draco's face flushed red, but he followed Harry's orders and got on his hands and knees. Harry inspected Draco in that position for a moment. His pert white ass poking out, waiting to be filled, his engorged cock visible only from a certain angle. Harry stroked his own cock, just watching Draco's body quivering in anticipation. "Please, Harry," Draco whispered, his hips started moving, as though they were fucking thin air, and Harry knew that Draco needed to be touched and filled. </p><p>Harry positioned himself behind Draco and cast a quick lubricating spell. He slipped a finger inside Draco's waiting asshole and moved the finger around and in and out. "Yes!" Draco yelled. "Oh Merlin YES YES YES!" </p><p>Harry pulled his finger out and slicked up his own cock before setting the tip just at Draco's entrance. "Relax," Harry whispered in Draco's ear. "You'll be too tight if you can't relax." Draco took a deep breath, and Harry could feel his asshole loosen. Harry pushed forward.</p><p>Gods but this was magnificent. Draco's tight hole was gripping tight on Harry's cock. Harry moved in a little more. </p><p>"Yes!" Draco said. </p><p>Harry grunted as he pushed in a little more, then a little more, until he was fully inside his lover. </p><p>"Move Harry! Move dammit!" Draco said desperately. </p><p>Harry slapped the side of Draco's ass, causing him to yelp. "I'm in charge here," he said with a growl. </p><p>"Yes, Harry," Draco said. "Oh yes you are!"</p><p>"I say when you can come." </p><p>"Yes Harry." </p><p>Harry stayed inside Draco for another few moments, completely still but for the quivering they were both doing. Finally without warning, he started thrusting. And he didn't start slowly, he immediately went for a  fast and punishing speed. Oh gods this wasn't going to take him long. He wanted Draco to come first, so he could feel the delicious squeeze of Draco's sphincter muscles around his cock. Harry reached his hand around Draco's body and took hold of his cock and started stroking to the same rhythm. </p><p>"Not until I say you can come," </p><p>"Mmm-hmm," Draco said, his eyes closed in concentration at holding back his orgasm. </p><p>Harry continued the punishing speed, and realizing it'd be torturous to hold Draco back anymore, commanded him, "Come!" </p><p>Within two seconds, Draco released with a loud and guttural moan. And just like Harry wanted, as Draco came his muscles clinched around Harry's cock. Harry thrust a few more times into the even tighter space but within seconds of Draco coming, Harry followed suit, his semen spilling into Draco's used asshole.</p><p>The thrusting slowed, their breathing was heavy but evening out, and Harry pulled his cock from Draco. Draco fell to the floor, his body limp. </p><p>Harry rolled Draco onto his back, and kissed him deeply. </p><p>This was the start of a great new life for them. </p>
