  <strong>Authors Note - This is a re write of the original, some people thought it was moving too fast, so I'm changing a few things. The first chapter is basically the same as in the original, but with a few minor changes towards the end of it. </strong>

  <strong>Chapter One</strong>
</p><p>The first time Tony Stark met Kitana was by accident. Well, more like it was he was trying to hide from his fans and she was in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p><p>Kitana had just travelled through the Veil in the Department of Mysteries, carrying everything she owns including all her money from Gringotts, in a never-ending bag. It was 19 years after the war had ended and she wanted to get away. She was still in the body of a 25-year-old girl, never looking any different and never changing. The first few years she didn't notice but around the age of 34/35 she finally agreed with what she'd known for a while. She wasn't aging and it seems everyone else was finally noticing too. After the war, she'd fallen out with Ron and Hermione and the rest of the Weasley's too, except the Twins and Bill and Charlie. But they were gone now too. All of them were gone now. And it was all her fault.</p><p>She choked back a sob and checked everything had come through with her. The Elder Wand was strapped to right arm, her Holly strapped to her left. The Resurrection stone was around her neck in a necklace, strapped together by a leather cord and the Cloak was tucked in her pocket. After the war, no matter how many times she tries to get rid of them, they'd all find some way back to her eventually. In the end, she gave up and accepted it. She had become the Master of Death, or Mistress as Hel liked to call her. As Mistress of death, she had some control over Death itself and can travel in-between Earth and Hel's dimension.</p><p>Shaking herself out of it, Kitana stepped out of the alley way and looked around her. She had not travelled very much in the years after the war but she'd recognize New York anywhere. But it looked different, more... Modernized. Especially the big building with 'Stark' written on the side. That building looked so much different to the buildings she was used to, that alone was her proof she'd travelled somewhere different, whether it was into the future... Or a different dimension all together.</p><p>Walking at a slow pace, looking with wide eyes almost like a child would, she didn't notice what was about to hit her until it happened. A body hit hers at almost full force, knocking her down hard. Landing with a wince on her backside, she glared up and noticed a man equally as wide eyed as she'd been moments ago, only this time in shock and panic.</p><p>About to speak, she was stopped by a large hand covering her mouth and a male voice whispering in her ear frantically. "I'll give you anything if you don't scream my name right now, I'm trying to hide from some fans and they're going to be coming around that corner any seconds now, I need to hide from them and after their gone we can talk about what to do to keep you quiet, okay? Good, you're coming with me!" With that, he let go of her mouth and grabbed her hands, pulled her up and dragged her back to the alley way she appeared from. Pushing her into the corner hiding both his and her body from view as well as both their faces and shocked her by kissing her full on the lips. Kitana stiffened in shock, eyes going wide and letting out a squeak. Just as this happened a hoard of people ran past, screaming a name she couldn't quite make out at that moment. She started to feel slightly light headed when he finally pulled back. She breathed in the much needed air and her mind cleared. Her eyes narrowed and she looked to the man in front of her, who was looking away from her checking for any fans nervously. Finding none, he let out a breath and turned to her, a shit eating grin on his face. It slipped off when he saw the angry look on hers.</p><p>"Who do you think you are? Knocking me over then dragging me off into an alleyway just to kiss me, my first kiss! And you were talking about what you're going to do so I keep quiet! What does that even mean?" Her voice rose from annoyed too irate and he cringes back from her before her words kicked in and he looked incredulous.</p><p>"You don't know who I am? I'm Tony Stark! You know, the guy whose CEO of Stark towers, Iron man billionaire, Genius, Philanthropist?" A cocky smile was on his face as he observed her to see if there was any recognition but there was none. "You seriously don't know who I am!? And what do you mean your first kiss! I can't be your first kiss? You what, like 23/24? Geez if I was your fist kiss, you must have been really frigid!" He looked even more shocked than her not knowing who he was and started the laugh at the end.</p><p>She didn't look impressed, and just crossed her arms, staring him down with one eye brow raised. He noticed her gaze and stopped laughing. He stared back at her and looked her up and down as if noticing there was more to her than just her head. He gave a roughish grin as he noticed her short stature, legs elongated by heels and showed off by tights and a semi short skirt. A white vest was under an off he shoulders ripped black top and her bag was on both shoulders.</p><p>His gaze seemed to stay on her legs and she lightly smacked his arm, growling slightly. "My eyes, are up here!" His eyes slowly went up to hers and he didn't seem the least bit embarrassed at being caught staring.</p><p>"Yes, and what a pretty pair of eyes they are Red. I've just realized, you now know my name but I don't know yours, Green eyes! Care to indulge me in it, beautiful?" He winked at her even though she was glaring holes into his head.</p><p>She glared at him for a while longer but his grin didn't relent. Finally, she sighed slightly and slumped a little bit before offering him her name. "Kitana. Kitana Potter."</p><p>His grin became even larger if possible. "Kitana, a beautiful name for a beautiful face." He grabbed her hand and extravagantly kissed the back of it. Unbidden, a blush made its way to her face.</p><p>"So Kitana. Since you now know who I am and I know who you are, because I knocked you down, dragged you off and kissed you, taking your first kiss apparently, what would you like in return? Money? Cars? A night with yours truly?" His cocky attitude never ended, going as far as to leer at her and wink at the end.</p><p>She reared back from him, shock on her face as she realized what he meant. Her hand automatically came up to smack him but she stopped herself. She was new to this world, and even though he was a pig, if what he said was true, she didn't want to get on the bad side of him.</p><p>"Don't worry, I don't want anything from you. I don't like being bribed or bought because of something I did or saw." His face she said this was shock, covered by curiosity.</p><p>"You don't want anything? At all? I don't believe it; any normal person would jump at the chance of me owing them something! So what'll it be? Clothes, shoes, makeup anything you want I can give you!" He grinned the same grin as before, faltering slightly when she just shook her head.</p><p>"Sorry, I've already said, I don't accept bribes or anything of the like. The only thing you can do for me is, step far away from me and give me directions to the nearest Hotel so I can have a shower and get some sleep, hopefully finding this whole thing to just be a dream." her sarcasm showed through and he narrowed his gaze on her, trying to see what she was getting at.</p><p>"Alright, say you actually don't want anything from me now, I don't like the thought of you being able to call in a favour at any time at all. So how about, I give you my personal number and that way if you think of anything you need, you can call me and then we won't need to speak to each other again, alright? Although, you do seem like the kind of girl I would like to get to know, so... You never know." his trademark grin was on his face again and didn't let up this time until she nodded, but only after looking him over to see whether he was lying or trying to trick her into something.</p><p>"Alright. Deal. Now show me to a hotel, so we can hopefully never meet again, alright?" She wasn't in the best of moods at the moment and she knew she shouldn't really take it out on him, even though most of it was his fault. Even thought he was cocky and annoying, he seemed like a mostly nice guy, but at the moment, she just wanted to relax and try and figure out what she was going to do.</p><p>"Sure thing, I know all the hotels around here! There's one about 5 Blocks away, pretty good, not 5 stars but still pretty good. Another is in the other direction about 7 blocks away that's high class and 5 stars. The last one is just around the corner, but its only 3 stars. Or your last option is still standing, you could spend the night with me!" Winking at the end of his sentence, he let her know he was only joking. Well, half joking at least. In his head, he was thinking he wouldn't mind spending a night with the beautiful woman in front of him. Realizing she wasn't exactly impressed with that, by her stance of arms crossed and one leg further out to the side than usual, he made his facial features change into a smile.</p><p>"I have money, enough that I don't care which hotel I go to and it doesn't matter where it is, although I'd prefer somewhere that isn't in a bad neighbourhood." Her arms uncrossed from their position and she motioned to the alley way opening, raising her eye brow as if to say <em>'After you.'</em></p><p>"Alight then, we'll go to the Ritz Hotel, It's the furthest away so I'm gonna call my driver so I can drive you there and make sure you made it alright." Tony stepped away from her, going towards the opening more and then lent against the wall before pulling out his phone and dialling. While he spoke to who she assumed was his driver, she swung her bag off of her shoulder and place it on the ground in front of her. Crouching down beside it, she rooted through it before pulling out a very small pouch. In real life, it was an equally as big a bag as her back pack and inside it held all her money. Reaching in and pulling out a purse at random, she placed the pouch back inside and enlarged the purse when Tony wasn't looking. Inside the purse was quite a lot of money, but not in the right currency. Hoping the currency was the same in this dimension as her, she tapped it and quietly said "American Dollars."</p><p>All the money inside changed, and her I.D did too, to make it seem like she was a US citizen. Hearing Tony say goodbye, she closed her bag again and swung it up onto her shoulder again.</p><p>"Alright, my driver Happy is on his way. We can either go straight to your hotel or... I can show you around New York if you like?" Tony smiled brightly at her, it never faltering even when she had to stop and think before shaking her head at his offer.</p><p>"No thanks, I have all the time in the world to check out New York, but at the moment all I want to do is have somewhere I can stay." Nodding at her in agreement, they both waited in silence, Tony occasionally glancing over at her. A thought going through both of their head was <em>'Well, meeting him/her was interesting...'</em></p><p>
