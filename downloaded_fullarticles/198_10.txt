    <p> </p><p>Professor Jacob Cartwright. He was tall with short brown hair with a longer fringe going down the side of his face, lightly tanned skin and green eyes. The girls adored him, they were constantly vying for his attention and he seemed to welcome their unending fawning for the most part, giving a charming smile every chance he got making them all swoon. He’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and he was actually quite good at his job. He was ten times better than the last professor they had everyone thought so but even so-</p><p>Sirius loathed him.</p><p>And why did Sirius loath the professor?</p><p>Well…</p><p>N.E.W.T’s were just weeks away, to save time they had more mixed classes. Slytherin was usually paired with Gryffindor, something most of the students from both houses would complain about for hours at a time.</p><p>D.A.D.A was one of those classes.</p><p>The period had just started, professor Cartwright was having them practice the spell that he’d been teaching them in a previous period. The desks were moved off to the side, students were standing scattered across the large dimly lit room, wands raised as they tried the first part of the spell, most of them were failing but there’s only one student that their handsome charming oh so wonderful professor was paying any attention to.</p><p>“Mr Snape, having a bit of trouble?” the man said as he approached the raven haired Slytherin. Said raven haired Slytherin paused in surprise before quickly averting his gaze.</p><p>“Oh, I’m fine sir.”</p><p>“Professor Cartwright, I’d like some help.” A brown haired girl said, raising her hand a few feet away. Professor Cartwright waved her off dismissively.</p><p>“Flick your wrist to the right, Ms Mills, I’m sure you’ll be fine.” The older man said the girl huffed as she went back to practicing the spell. Professor Cartwright stopped at Snape’s side and gave him a soft smile.</p><p>“Now now Mr Snape, there’s no need to be shy. Here let me help you. Like this,” The professor said stepping in behind the teen and reaching out to position his hands, lifting his wand hand to mimic the necessary wand movements. The brunette leaned forward close to Snape’s ear, “See just like that, first to the left and then the right.”</p><p>Snape started to flush, “Yes sir.”</p><p>The older man chuckled, “You’re much too tense Mr Snape, you need to relax.” No one noticed, everyone was too busy with the spell, they didn’t notice the way the professor pressed even closer to Snape’s back. They didn’t see the way that Snapes blush went one shade darker as the older man spoke.</p><p>“Arch you back a bit more and tilt your head back just like that.” The brunette smirked as he used his free hand to take hold of Snape’s chin and moved his head. Professor Cartwright spoke with his lips mere inches away from Snape’s. “You need to feel the magic move inside you, coursing through your body. Understand?”</p><p>Snape seemed to shiver, “Yes-yes professor.”</p><p>“Very good.”</p><p>This.</p><p>This is why Sirius loathes professor Jacob Cartwright.</p><p>Stormy grey eyes filled with rage, Sirius’ jaw clenched, sparks started to light up the end of his wand as he watched the scene play out. Just then the teacher pulled back stepping away from the Slytherin and looked up at Sirius.</p><p>The man gave a snort as he turned around and continued his rounds through the class room.</p><p>“Mr Black, I suggest you stop gawking at your fellow classmates and get started before you fall behind.”</p><p>Sirius glared, hard.</p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p>Professor Paul Abbey</p><p>James despises him.</p><p>He’s the new Quidditch professor but he was also incredibly talented with Transfiguration. He taught flying to first and second years and sometimes, he’d stand in for professor McGonagall in some of her classes whenever Dumbledore needed her to take care of any other duties. N.E.W.T’s were coming up and professor McGonagall was busier than normal so of course professor Abbey took over her classes.</p><p>Professor Abbey had messy blonde hair and dark eyes, he had an average height with pale skin and a body that left very little doubt as to why he became the quidditch professor. The witches in school adored him, the wizards looked up to him, wanted to be just like him. He’s an incredible flyer and could transfigure just about anything.</p><p>Everyone loved him.</p><p>Except for James.</p><p>And why did James despise professor Paul Abbey?</p><p>“Ow!” James hissed when a hand connected hard with the back of his head and he looked up just in time to see the professor walk by his desk, his eyes narrowed ever so slightly. Some of the students giggled</p><p>“As attentive as ever Mr Potter.” The man said glancing back at the teen as he kept moving, “I should hope you’ll pay more attention during your game against Ravenclaw next week.”</p><p>James glared at the man’s back, fingers clenching around the quill in his hand as he watched the man until he paused at the desk right in front of him</p><p>Snape’s desks.</p><p>“Excellent work as always Mr Snape.” Professor Abbey said putting a hand on the teen’s shoulder. Snape looked up in surprise before he looked back down at the parchment before him.</p><p>“Thank you sir.”</p><p>This is why James despises professor Paul Abbey.</p><p>“Although,” the older man paused with a slight frown on his lips as he leaned over the slytherin, “This part here isn’t quite right. Transfiguring liquids can be a bit tricky you see. Doing it this way might cause an explosion.”</p><p>“Oh,” James could hear Snape’s tone drop with disappointment when the man smiled.</p><p>“This is some solid effort though. It’s nothing that can’t be fixed with a bit of tweaking. There’s still some time before you need to hand this in.” professor Abbey lowered his voice so only Snape could hear him but James was still sitting close enough to hear, “I could help you if you’d like. Some private tutoring should improve your transfiguration skills quite a bit.”</p><p>Snape looked up at that, “That really isn’t necessary professor-“</p><p>“I insist.” The man offered with a soft smile, “It might even give us some time to improve your flying. Today after lessons, just the two of us.”</p><p>“What about dinner?”</p><p>“I’ll have the elves throw something together, its best not to have any distractions. We have a lot of work to do.” Professor Abbey pulled back with a smile, reaching out to brush Snape’s hair behind his ear.</p><p>Snape blushed, “Yes professor.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>James’ quill snapped in half.</p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p>Professor Christopher Newport.</p><p>Remus… well it’s not that he disliked the Ancient Ruins professor. No it’s just.</p><p>Alright fine Remus hates him.</p><p>Hates him with a passion.</p><p>The older man has pitch black shaggy shoulder length hair and bright blue eyes, tall with broad shoulders and pale skin. He seemed like an intelligent man, quiet and reserved. The girls called him brooding and mysterious.</p><p>Why did Remus hate professor Newport?</p><p>“We’ll need this one and this one.” The professor said, taking one book after the other from the shelf while the slytherin beside him stood with at least three books of his own clutched against his chest.</p><p>Snape nodded to another just a few shelves above his head, “What about that one? I read it in third year when I was looking for references on curse breaking spells.”</p><p>Professor Newport reached up to the leather bound hardcover book to look at the cover and blinked in surprise.</p><p>“Cursed curses and the magix that bind them. This is an eighth year book. You read it in third?”</p><p>Snape gave a nod as he looked away and the man stared at him in awe, “Se-Mr Snape, that’s incredible. Thirteen years old and already reading at this level? You should’ve been pushed up by at least two grades. You never cease to amaze me.”</p><p>Snape blushed, “Thank you sir.”</p><p>“Come along, we’ll need all the time we can get if we’re going to finish your assignment in time.”</p><p>“Sir you really don’t need to help-“</p><p>“I want to.” Professor Newport said and a light blush seemed to flood the older man’s cheeks, “If you’d like, I could set some time aside, tutor you more often. I know you don’t really need it but, a little support always goes a long way.”</p><p>“I-“</p><p>The slytherin paused before looking up and giving the older man a smile, “Thank you sir.”</p><p>“It’s my pleasur-oh!”</p><p>Suddenly Snape seemed to trip over his own robes and he might have gone crashing to the ground had the older man beside him not moved quickly to reach out and catch him.</p><p>“Are you alright?” The man asked as he helped the slytherin stand up straight but didn’t remove his arm from around the teen’s waist. Snape flushed.</p><p>“I’m fine, thank you sir.”</p><p>“There’s no need to thank me.” Professor Newport said as he started walking steering them towards a desk near the back of the library still with his arm around Snape’s waist while Snape fought against the flush in his cheeks.</p><p>Remus watched the exchange from three shelves away where he was looking for a book for his potions test. He found a book started paging thprugh it when he caught sight of professor Newport and his star pupil.</p><p>The werewolf watched them settle at a desk on the opposite end of the library. When he looked down his eyes went wide when he saw the shredded remains for the book in his hand.</p><p>“Great.”</p><p>This…</p><p>This needs to end.</p><p> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p>The door opened with a slam.</p><p>“This was not part of the deal!”</p><p>The three men in the room looked up at their visitors.</p><p>Professor Abbey and Cartwright sat at a small side table near the bookshelf playing wizard chess while professor Newport sat in a large plush chair beside the fireplace reading a book of some sort.</p><p>In the door stood three teens. Remus Lupin, James Potter and Sirius Black. They were furious.</p><p>The three professors spared the wizards just one more glance before going back to what they were doing before.</p><p>“What on earth are you talking about?” Professor Cartwright asked as he looked down at the board deep in thought. James stepped forward and his friends followed.</p><p>“Snape! Seducing him was not part of the deal!”</p><p>Professor Abbey looked up at that, “Excuse me?”</p><p>Professor Cartwright leaned back in his seat to give the boys a bored stare, “The deal was you get rid of Pettigrew, look after Regulus and work on getting your relationship with Lily off the ground.” The man said giving James a pointed look and the boy almost flinched back as he continued, “We take care of Severus. That was the deal.”</p><p>“I think we’ve been doing rather well on our end of our arrangement.”</p><p>“I do too. Don’t you think we’ve been doing well professor Newport?”</p><p>The man only nodded his head and professor Abbey hummed, “We’ve been doing extremely well. How about you?”</p><p>“Exactly what part of taking care of him requires you to seduce him?” James hissed and professor Abbey gave a shrug.</p><p>“None, that’s just a perk.”</p><p>Sirius’ hands clenched, Remus stepped forward, “What about those things the what’re they called-“</p><p>“The horcruxes?” Professor Newport supplied and professor Cartwright nodded, “Oh right, we already took care of those.”</p><p>“Oh, remember the look on Malfoy’s face when he realised the book was missing?”</p><p>“That was brilliant!”</p><p>“Almost as good as Padfoot falling off the boat once we got out of the cave.”</p><p>“I was tripping on poison potion!”</p><p>“You would’ve died if it weren’t for the potion Sev made for us.”</p><p>“Yeah, we really should do something for him. he’s been helping us so much and he’s had no idea why.”</p><p>“There’s a Cannons game this weekend.”</p><p>“Do you think Dumbledore will let us take him for the weekend?”</p><p>“I don’t see why not, we are his guardians.” Professor Cartwright said with a shrug. Remus frowned.</p><p>“Guardians?”</p><p>Professor Abbey looked up, “Yes guardians, we just got the paperwork finalised this weekend now all that’s left is to tell Severus.”</p><p>Professor Newport smiled, “Oh he’ll be so excited.”</p><p>“I know right-“</p><p>“Wait wait wait,” James said shaking his head with a deep frown on his face, “What do you mean guardians. You weren’t supposed to become his guardians you were supposed to blood adopt him. So he’d be your son?”</p><p>The three professors shared a look until Professor Cartwright spoke.</p><p>“There was a change of plans,” The man paused brushing his hair from his face, “We realised that a blood adoption was maybe just a touch bit extreme and could complicate things in the future.”</p><p>“Complicate what?” Remus asked incredulously when Sirius spoke with a dark glare in his eyes, “Oh I get it. Making him their son would complicate them trying to shag him whenever they want. That’s not going to happen by the way.”</p><p>Professor Cartwright gave a sigh, rolling his eyes as he got up off his seat to walk over to the bottle of fire whiskey perched in the corner near the shelf of books.</p><p>“Merlin, was I always this dramatic?”</p><p>“Honestly I don’t see what our relationship with Severus has to do with any of you.” Professor Abbey said pointedly looking at James yet again, “He’s safe, he’s protected and he’s well taken care of and besides, you hate him remember. What he does in his own time has nothing to do with you.”</p><p>James tensed, glaring at the older man with seething hatred but he didn’t say a word. Remus sighed.</p><p>“We got rid of Pettigrew, Sirius’ made peace with Regulus and Lily-“ The werewolf paused to look back at James, “James is working on it.”</p><p>“Not hard enough.” The blonde hissed and James’ jaw clenched, Remus took a step forward, “The point is that we’re doing our part the way we promised we would. You on the other hand-“</p><p>“Oh fine, we’re trying to seduce him so what?” Professor Newport hissed in frustration as he went back to reading his book.</p><p>“Professor Newport.” Professor Abbey said dramatically and the other man sighed in frustration. “Oh so what, Severus is happy isn’t he? Isn’t that what’s important? He’s happy. We’re happy. Why does anything else matter.”</p><p>“It matters because you’re too old for him!” Sirius all but screeched.</p><p>“Again! This has nothing to do with you.” Professor Cartwright said after taking a swig of whiskey, “He’s not taking the mark, he’s staying far away from he-who-must-not-be-named. Whatever we choose to do with him now is none of your business. Isn’t that right professor Abbey?”</p><p>“Oh enough with the professor crap!” Sirius hissed, the men only smirked at him, “You’re not professors of anything, you’re just-“</p><p>Knock knock knock!</p><p>“Hello? Professor Newport, Professor Cartwright?”</p><p>Six pairs of eyes went wide at the voice they heard on the other side of the door. The blonde sitting in the chair quickly reached into his holster to pull out his wand and aim it at the three teens in the room.</p><p>
  <em>“Stupefy!”</em>
</p><p>With no time to react they were frozen almost immediately.</p><p>“Get the cloak.”</p><p>Professor Newport immediately moved to the other side of the room, digging around in the large brown chest at the side of the couch near the shelf while Professor Cartwright levitated the three teens closer and up against the wall. A cloak was thrown over them and they vanished from sight.</p><p>Knock knock knock!</p><p>Professor Abbey took a deep breath, patting down his robes and fixing his hair before taking a deep breath.</p><p>“Right then, ready?”</p><p>
  <em>Knock knock knock!</em>
</p><p>“Ready.” The other two said and the blonde reached out and opened the door to reveal a raven haired teen with pale skin and the darkest eyes standing on the other side.</p><p>“Professor Abbey.” The teen said sounding a bit surprised as he tugged at the strap of his bag, “I thought you’d still be supervising quidditch practice.”</p><p>The blonde man shrugged, “We finished a bit earlier tonight. Come in, I assume there’s a reason you decided to visit us?”</p><p>“Yes sir.” The slytherin stepped into the room giving a shy smile as he looked up at the other men in the room. “Good evening professors.”</p><p>“I thought we already discussed this whole professor thing,” the Cartwright said with a smile as he stepped closer to the boy while Abbey shut the door behind him, “When we’re alone, you call us by our names.”</p><p>Severus flushed just a bit, “Yes professor-I mean- Jacob.”</p><p>Abbey rolled his eyes while Newport gave the teen a soft smile, “What are you doing here so late? Its almost curfew.”</p><p>“I know but,” the teen walked over to the couch and set his bag down on his lap. Newport and Abbey both sat on either side of him while Cartwright leaned over the back of the couch as the teen pulled out a worn looking note book, “I’m working on a project for potions and I was hoping I could get your advice.”</p><p>“Of course, anything you need.” Abbey said reaching out to tuck the raven’s hair behind his ear and Severus flushed just a bit more. The teen cleared his throat.</p><p>“Right well, the potion is a bit like the Polyjuice potion, it alters the subject’s physical form only it alter’s their essence as well.”</p><p>“A potion with transfiguration and curse like properties, with a touch of dark magic.” Newport said, “Impressive.”</p><p>“Severus,” Cartwright said reaching out to place a hand on the teen’s head, “We talked about all this dark stuff-“</p><p>“Not all dark magic is bad, some of it is actually quite… with the right balance of light magic it-it’s actually quite beautiful and-” Severus interrupted with a sigh, “It’s not a dark potion. At least not completely.”</p><p>“Dragon scales, unicorn blood… wolfsbane…” Newport cut himself off to stare at the teen, “You’re trying to find a counter for the werewolf’s curse.”</p><p>Cartwright blinked, “Oh.”</p><p>“I know it seems like a waste of time-“</p><p>“No, no of course its not a waste of time.” Abbey said with a soft smile, “This is wonderful Severus. How can we help?”</p><p>Severus gave them a small pleased smile as he arranged his notes.</p><p>Through all of this, James, Sirius and Remus watched from the other side of the room, anger raging through their veins.</p><p>This all started at the beginning of the year when Professor Cartwright, Newport and Abbey first started teaching at Hogwarts.</p><p>At first it was just a weird thing that they noticed. They noticed how the new professors were somewhat more friendly with Snape as opposed to everyone else.</p><p>It started off with the odd, “Well done, Mr Snape”, “As brilliant as ever Mr Snape”.</p><p>But Snape usually got praised in class so it wasn’t really that big of a deal. But then they noticed how the professors would suddenly just stop in the middle of a period to pause by Snape’s table to ask him how his day was going, if he managed to study over the weekend, if he needed extra help with whatever new assignment they got.</p><p>It was odd but Snape was always a know it all goody-goody student so they brushed it off. But then they noticed other things. Like how professor Abbey would always reach out to brush Snape’s hair back or actually run his fingers through the slytherin’s inky black locks when he clearly thought no one was looking. they noticed how professor Cartwright insisted on personally assisting Snape in performing whatever spell he’d taught them that week, not that he didn’t help the other students but he didn’t get quite as handsy with them as he did with Snape. They saw how professor Newport would have Snape stay behind after class and once the rest of the students had left and he thought they were alone, the older man would pull the Slytherin behind his desk, supposedly discussing one of Snape’s essays.</p><p>Then they were asking Snape assist them after classes ended for the day. Whispering in the slytherin’s ear during classes. Pulling Snape aside in the hall ways to have some sort of secret discussion.</p><p>The last straw however was when the professors started punishing the Marauders for pulling pranks. Now, they usually got punished for pulling pranks whenever they got caught in the act but they were usually able to get away with most of them with a slap of the wrist. Maybe only have one days’ detention or something like that.</p><p>That changed after the new professors started working at Hogwarts.</p><p>They were usually pretty lenient whenever the marauders pulled pranks on other students but they’d be ruthless whenever the pranks were aimed at Snape. One day’s detention would suddenly turn to three or four weeks worth. Arranging books and paperwork in class turned into scrubbing down the dungeon walls, cleaning potions instruments for Slughorn or cleaning out the stables. Most of the time they wouldn’t even be caught in the act but the professors would still punish them since they somehow just knew that they had something to do with the last prank pulled on the slytherin. They lost hundreds of house points between the three of them. So many points in fact that even other students in Gryffindor didn’t find the pranks they pulled to be funny anymore since they knew it would be another sixty to a hundred points deducted from Gryffindor.</p><p>They were actually quite pissed to be honest.</p><p>It wasn’t till about three months later that it all came to a head. This came after they were sneaking around the hallways one night, trying to sneak back into Gryffindor Tower when they found the older men whispering among themselves in an empty hall after curfew.</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>“Yes, I’m sure. I checked to make sure Severus was still in bed. Malfoy hasn’t gotten the chance to sink his hooks into him just yet.” Professor Abbey whispered, “You know it’s a little disturbing how easy it is for professors to get into dorm rooms.”</p><p>“Exactly why can’t I check in on Severus again?”</p><p>“Because you don’t know how to keep your hands to yourself.”</p><p>“You can’t be trusted with him alone in his bedroom.”</p><p>“Oh please, like you don’t get turned on every time he calls you professor with that ridiculous look in his eyes.”</p><p>“Seriously its like they go on forever.” Professor Abbey said, “Why didn’t I notice that when we were younger?”</p><p>“You were too busy with Lily to notice.”</p><p>James tensed, “Lily?”</p><p>Abbey rolled his eyes, “Yeah, I’m not interested in her now so-“</p><p>“Speaking of your errant wife,” Cartwright started as they made their way down the hall, “You know who hasn’t been paying much attention to her. Have you noticed?”</p><p>Abbey sighed, “Yes, I’ve noticed.”</p><p>Newport shook his head, “You know why this is happening James-“</p><p>“James?” the three boys gasped in unison as Newport continued.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have interfered with what happened at the lake.”</p><p>“I couldn’t do that. Lily made me promise that I’d make sure she and Severus stayed friends and besides, I can’t stand the thought of him hating me. I had to stop it.”</p><p>Cartwright huffed, “Well now thanks to you we have to find some other way of forcing them together. We can’t risk losing Harry.”</p><p>The three men were moving closer now, Abbey sighed in frustration. “I know I know, I’ll think of something. Honestly though, this would’ve all been so much easier if I weren’t such an arrogant little twat-“</p><p>And then suddenly the blonde stopped right in his tracks, staring right at the spot where the marauders stood huddled under the invisibility cloak. James’ eyes went wide. Remus put a hand over his mouth to stop from breathing and Sirius instinctively moved closer to his friends.</p><p>“James, what’s wrong?” Newport asked in confusion, but the blonde didn’t answer so the two men turned to look in the direction where the other was staring. Cartwright’s eyes went wide.</p><p>“Shit!” he hissed and then he suddenly pulled out his wand. The three teens had no time to react before.</p><p>
  <em>“Stupefy!”</em>
</p><p>The spell hit them and they froze involuntarily. Professor Abbey moved forward and much to the marauders horror pulled the invisibility cloak right off before his eyes went wide along with professor Newport's.</p><p>“Oh Merlin.” Newport gasped while Cartwright kept cursing in the background.</p><p>“Shit, shit shit! Wait O.K, maybe they didn’t hear-“</p><p>“We can’t know for sure.” Abbey said not looking away from the  teens’ frozen forms for a moment before he spoke, “We can’t leave them here. C’mon we’ll take them to the room.”</p><p> </p><p> </p>
