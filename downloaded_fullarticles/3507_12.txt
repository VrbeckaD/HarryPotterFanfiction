    <p>Debbie had been known to be skeptical of new people, a reputation for acting harshly. Some could call her a cold-hearted bitch, most people did. No matter how much Debbie loved her family she blamed them for her closed off nature and quite honestly she did not care anymore. She had grown to love the thieving and conning that ran from generation to generation helping her brother Danny with his antics from a young age. Their parents had not encouraged this behavior but it had not totally been discouraged. Debbie came from Slytherin after Slytherin and it came to no surprise when Debbie had been sorted when she arrived. Tammy her childhood friend and neighbor, on the other hand, had been sorted into Hufflepuff. Little Debbie had been disappointed that she would not get to live with her but Danny knocked some sense into her, "you'll still get to be in the same classes, it's not like you're not going to ever see her again."</p><p>Danny slouched against the trolley containing her valuables. Unlike most students, Debbie had opted against having an animal companion. She wasn't the best at looking after things let alone animals, she had learned this the hard way in her first year.<br/>

"Ugh ... I forgot how busy this place was."<br/>

Debbie rolled her eyes, "You really don't have to be here, actually I'd prefer it if you weren't"<br/>

Danny ruffled her hair before she could duck from his approaching hand. "Family first."<br/>

Debbie wrapped her arms around her brother and savored the moment before she had to board the train.<br/>

"Try not to get into as much trouble this year. My charms might not be able to keep you safe forever."<br/>

Debbie rolled her eyes and began lugging her baggage onto the train. Danny did little assisting but helped none the less. A few of the younger Slytherins batted their eyelids and cooed towards the pair, " Hi Danny."<br/>

"Hey Cynthia, Julie"<br/>

"you're gross, I wonder what Tess would say"<br/>

"I'm just being polite Debbie, not like you would know what that means."</p><p>Tammy tripped into the cabin Danny and Debbie were currently occupying. Her hair was a mess and her face was red, and a hickey glowing on her neck.<br/>
"wow, who were you getting freaky with Tammy"<br/>

Tammy looked confused and continued to be out of breath. Debbie motioned with her finger towards her own neck, "you've got a hickey."<br/>
Tammy clasped the side of her neck as her red face deepened. The horn blared signally 5 minutes until departure.<br/>
"well see you later Debbie, Tammy"<br/>

"Bye Danny."  Tammy finally was able to get out before she collapsed onto the seat.<br/>

"Now tell me who the lucky guy it is."<br/>

...<br/>

"girl? it's a girl, it is."<br/>

"... ok, you know the Ravenclaw with dreads."<br/>

"we don't have anyone with dreads in our year level."<br/>

"No." Tammy pointed downwards.<br/>

An audible gasp, "the year below? Nine-Ball??"<br/>

"yeah"<br/>

"Didn't know you had it in you" </p><p>The train jutted forward, and Debbie took her seat beside the window. She spotted the back of Danny's head disappear through the wall of the station.    Debbie kicked off her heels and swung her feet onto the empty seats beside her. She put her head against the glass of the window as the green pastures started rolling into view. The rattling train and busy noise in the neighboring cabins prevented her from her shut-eye. Tammy being the nice person she was cast the charm muffliato. Debbie dozed off to the rocking of the train and the sweet sensation of knowing she would be returning to her second home away from the family drama.<br/>

Her neck is cramped and when her she begins to peel apart her eyes, the windows are a deep blue, the stars beginning to emerge. She swears she sees a blonde bob and the back of a signature velvet suit jacket exit the cart before Debbie is able to sit up the figure is gone and Tammy is staring down at her dressed in her Hufflepuff robes. Daphne and Rose sitting arm in arm their faces just far enough to not be pda. Constance the small 4th year Debbie took under her wing last year. She wanted to get up and chase after her, but then again if Lou had wanted to talk to her she wouldn't have left right as she woke up.<br/>

"Your feelings are showing Debs," Daphne commented, "You were never great at covering those."<br/>

"Do you guys know? How?"<br/>

"We were there Debbie, you guys are great at stealing not so much hiding."<br/>

Debbie gave a sigh and hurriedly shoved her robes on top of her clothes. The train came to a jolting stop and the group began piling out.<br/>

"Please kill me before I die from embarrassment," Debbie whispered to Tammy so the others wouldn't hear.<br/>

"We're all your friends. No one cares we just want you to be happy."<br/>

"ugh ... so cheesy"<br/>

Tammy rolled her eyes as they jumped down from the train steps and walked towards to the Thestrals. Their feet crunching against the leaves and twigs on the floor. Her white converses were graffitied with mud and dirt. She stopped in her tracks when she saw Lou stroking the creature that only a few could see. Debbie wanted to run to her. The hurt in Lou's eyes could be seen under the moonlight. The wind blew her platinum blond fringe around her eyes, the yellow flickering of the torches illuminated the shine of the highlight on her cheekbones.  Her long tender fingers stroking what she imagined to be the head. Tammy almost had to pull off Debbie's hand to get her to move again.<br/>
"You could be a little more inconspicuous, people are snickering."<br/>

As Tammy dragged her along the dirt path she continued to stare at the stunning girl under the evening sky. Lou turned and their eyes met for a second and everything turned into slow motion. A tall brunette strolled up behind Lou wrapping her hands around her waist burying her nose into her neck. Someone might as well take a hammer, rip her heart out and smash it on a bed of needles.<br/>

"Tammy, Tammy who the fuck is that bitch."</p>
