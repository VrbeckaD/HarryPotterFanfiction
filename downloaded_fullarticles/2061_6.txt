  <em>
    <span>The first time he set his eyes on her he couldn't help but to think, she'll be the death of me. If only he knew just how true that was. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione Estrella Black was the epitome of Pure-blood grace and royalty. Men doted upon her, eagerly fulfilling her every whim while she looked on bored by their eagerness. Their desperation. It reeked off of them like the too expensive cologne that clogged her throat and made her eyes burn. Their sharp smiles reminding her at every turn that she was simply a trophy to them. One to be fought over, then placed on a shelf to be admired while they spent their days running their businesses. Smoking their cigars and sipping their whiskey. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The women were no better. All of them prattling on about the Season's balls, and who was going to propose to whom, and the latest scandal in pureblood society. All of them air brained fools only concerned with finding a husband to care for them. One that had house elves to care for the children they would bear, while they hosted their tea parties and luncheons and balls. None of it entertained her in the slightest. She would much rather live out her days as a spinster like her elder cousin Cassie, than to turn into one of these ingrates. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Worthless, the lot of them. Oh, there were the slight few that rose above the rest. Like Evangeline Shafiq, the dark skinned beauty finding her place among the researchers of Ancient Runes. Or Amelia Fawley, who spent her days with dangerous beasts, seeking to re-establish their numbers. Even Evan Rosier was better than the droll men who surrounded them. He at least had a promising career in Quidditch, therefore he believed that a wife was irrelevant to his goals at the time. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So Hermione was intrigued when said Rosier introduced her to one Tom Marvolo Riddle with such a reverent tone. The man was beautiful, of that there was no doubt. With full sensuous lips, high cheek bones, a jawline for days, and icy blue eyes. Women flocked around him, and while he was polite, he showed no real interest in them. Brushing them off politely one by one, smirking as they walked away dejectedly. It was a game to him. One she was all too familiar with. One she played herself with the fools that surrounded her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Warning bells sounded inside her mind when he flashed her a confident smile, bending low to brush a kiss along the back of her hand, with a murmured "Pleasure."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She excelled at the game, but she had the sinking feeling he was better. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was the beginning of the Season, and her mother was having yet another fit. The woman could rant for hours, about how ungrateful and disappointing Hermione was. How as a nearly eighteen year old witch, she should already be married, with at least one child on the way. Her father would always bring her mother to heel, though. As his only daughter and child, he doted upon her. She was not the last of the Black's. There was of course Orion, Alphard and Cygnus, as well Lucretia and Walburga. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Yes, Phineas doted upon Hermione like the princess he saw her as. He had married his wife Alessandra Travers, as a final attempt to re-establish his place among his family. Oh, he still supported muggle rights, but now he did so quietly. Placing funds where they needed to go when muggles were attacked in muggle-baiting, applying the right kind of pressure to ensure laws to protect muggles went through, and instilling in his only daughter that muggles and muggle-born were not inferior. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione had took his lessons to heart. She treated everyone equally, when she was able. Which as the only daughter of a minor line happened to be quite frequently. She was a Slytherin through and through, though. Just as she would hold her hand out to help someone up, she would use that same hand to slit their throat if they crossed her. Everyone commented on how the rumored Black Madness had spared her, and seemed to burrow itself into her cousin Walburga, but they didn't know the truth. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They didn't know about the dreams of another life. One where she was an outcast, fighting in a war she was far too young for. Alongside a messy raven haired boy, and another lanky red headed boy. They didn't know about the man, no monster, named Lord Voldemort, who killed children and women and men, pure-blooded or not.  They didn't know about the mad cackles of a crazed haired wide eyed woman who inflicted the worst possible pain imaginable. They didn't have to see faces of dead friends they would never know float across their mind at night, chasing sleep from their addled minds. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They didn't know, that perhaps, she was the maddest Black of them all. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Her train of thought was broken by her mother's shrill voice, "Honestly Hermione! You're nearly eighteen, and you have no prospects to speak of! I can hardly bare to show my face at the Ladies Luncheons."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione let out an indelicate snort, "I have plenty of prospects, Mother. However, seeing as how they all bore me to tears, I've turned them all away."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Alessandra's eyes widened in fury as she spluttered in anger, "You WHAT? How could you Hermione? Why must you break your poor mother's heart? Oh Phineas!" </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione sighed, wishing she could get away with casting a silencing spell on her mother. The woman was far too dramatic. How they shared blood was a mystery to her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Phineas' easy chuckle could be heard from behind his morning paper, and Hermione envied his easy-going nature. He was still just as cutthroat and vengeful as all the other Black's, but there was a certain peace he carried. As if he knew exactly who and what he was, and he was comfortable with that. Hermione hoped that one day, she too would have that peace about her. Living with her mother though, made it seem an impossibility. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Leave the girl alone, Ali. She'll find a husband when she's good and ready." A flick of his wrists to straighten his paper, as if to say the conversation was done. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"And if she doesn't? It's bad enough Cassiopeia is in her potion's lab all day, and we won't speak of poor Marius, Dorea married that Potter boy, and your brother Arcturus has had nothing but daughters. Not to mention Lycoris and Regulus are more interested in chasing dragons, the bloody fools. That leaves only Sirius' son Arcturus and Cygnus' son Pollux's children, and Hermione." Alessandra huffed out, arms crossing across her chest defensively. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione for her part sat in her chair, mimicking her mother's speech. One she had heard at least once a week since she came home at seventeen without a husband. Why did she need a husband anyway? She was honestly much too young for one. She would rather travel, and explore the world. Or help her cousin Cassie in the potion's lab. Or stick needles in her eyes. Anything other than getting married to one of the droll men who surrounded her at every soiree. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Hermione cannot pass on the Black name. Unless of course you want me to beg for Alphard to be reinstated into the family, so that he can marry her?" Phineas growled, placing his paper down on the table. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Alessandra let out a sharp gasp, appalled. "Of course not, Phineas! But-"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"But nothing woman! I am the man of this house, and if I say Hermione doesn't have to marry, then she doesn't have to marry." Spittle flew from his lips as he glared at his wife. He cared for her deeply, but Hermione was his whole world. And he could see that Alessandra's harping was upsetting his daughter. And he had vowed on the day she was born that no one would get away with harming her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione placed a gentle hand on her father's forearm, "It's alright Father. Mother only wants what she thinks is best for me. It's not her fault that society has told her that it's for me to get married and have children. Isn't that right, Mother?" </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Alessandra's lip trembled, and she nodded. Truly all she wanted was for her daughter to find a man to care for here, a man to spoil her the way Phineas did. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Phineas let out a shallow breath, "I'm sorry loves, I didn't mean to raise my voice at you. Forgive me Ali?" </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And just like that, all was right in their world again. </span>
</p>
<p>                                                                                               ~OoOoOoOoOoOoOoO~<br/><br/></p>
<p>
  <span>"Oh, isn't he handsome, Hermione?" Asked an excited Walburga. Her sharp nails digging in to her arm as she sent coy looks to Tom Riddle. Hermione made a noncommittal noise. He was indeed very handsome, and from what she had been told, incredibly smart. They had attended Hogwarts together, however they stayed outside of each other's social circles. Tom spending his time with Abraxas Malfoy, Evan Rosier, Thaddeus Carrow, and a few other pure-blood boys. Hermione saw through their simpering smiles and polite behaviors; they were sharks. All of them just as eager to tear and rip and destroy as the next. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tom however, seemed to have a certain elegance about him. As if while he tore you to shreds, he'd have you begging for more. A certain danger surrounded him, and yet it did nothing to fend off his many admirers. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione remembered something from her dreams, about how Tom Riddle had risen as a creature named Lord Voldemort. How he had caused death and destruction and anguish wherever he roamed. Shaking the thought from her mind she returned her attention to her cousin. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"I thought you were set on marrying Orion?" Hermione remarked, taking a sip from her champagne glass. Wrinkling her nose as the bubbles tickled it. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Walburga sent her a mild glare, "Of course I am. I won't sully myself with anything less than the Black bloodline. However, I can still appreciate a handsome man." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione smiled at her cousin. Walburga may be mad, but she was family. And who's to say she wasn't a little mad too?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Opening her mouth to respond, she was surprised to hear a smooth voice beside her instead, "May I have this dance, Miss Hermione?" </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Turning to face the man who had interrupted her, she was surprised to see Tom standing there. Raising her brow impertinently, she nodded slightly, placing one of her gloved hands in his. Truthfully, she could have denied him this dance. After all he was a mere half-blood. Oh sure, he was the last of the Gaunt bloodline, but they were better off extinct anyways. The poor sods were even madder than her family, and she dreaded to think of what could happen if the two bloodlines crossed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They swept into a classic waltz, neither speaking, simply staring into each other's eyes as they swooped across the dance floor together. Hermione had enough tact to let him lead, knowing that even if he danced horribly, she had years of lessons. So she was surprised when she noticed he danced as if he had been born to it. She was even more surprised by the voice screaming inside her head. Don't trust him! Don't trust him! Don't. Trust. Him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When the dance finally ended, she gave a polite curtsy and made her way back to Walburga, who was now joined by Orion. Who, while several years younger, towered over them both. His dark hair and grey eyes watched Tom suspiciously. Hermione was his favorite cousin, after all, she would protect him from anyone, even his father. He'd never forget the day she walked in on Arcturus kicking him as he laid curled in the fetal position. Hermione's family magic had roared in displeasure, and with the simple flick of her wrist she had Arcturus pinned against the wall. Her magic had left him there for days, until the bruises on Orion's face and torso had healed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When he had finally been released, he made straight for Hermione, only to be met with her wand and that of her Father's. Phineas had read Arcturus the riot act, and swore that if he ever discovered him lying another harmful hand on his nephew or niece, that he'd gut him. Arcturus must have seen something in his Uncle's eyes, because after that day, he hardly spoke to his children. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So naturally, Orion was just as protective. He had heard things about Tom Riddle. About how he would take girls to his rooms, and they would leave with bruises and no recollection of what had happened to them. About how he was fond of throwing out unforgivables like they were merely household charms. Orion had heard it all, and he would not allow Tom Riddle to harm his cousin. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Seems you have yet another admirer, Cousin." Orion remarked caustically, eyes boring daggers into the older man as he made his way to his Uncle Phineas. His eyes narrowed in displeasure as they moved to a darkened corner to speak in hushed tones. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"One of many, that will never see anything come of their admiration." Hermione replied, sending a smile full of teeth his way. A warning. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Orion sighed, and nodded, the message clear. Hermione Black was capable of fighting her own battles, and his interference was not appreciated. Chancing a glance at Walburga he left out a small sigh of disappointment. Walburga was beautiful, but she was mad beyond reason, and if given the choice between her and Hermione. Well, he'd choose Hermione every time. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"May I have this dance, Walburga?" He asked quietly. At her eager smile, and Hermione's reassuring one, he felt his heart sink a little lower in his chest. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Tom Riddle was feeling rather bemused. For the past several weeks, his mind had been occupied with thoughts of Hermione Black. The girl was beautiful, that anyone could see, but she was also cold and callous. She carried herself as if she were a queen, and yet she would mingle with the peasants. He remembered her in school, incredibly intelligent and seemingly always bored. She took to magic and learning as if it were as easy as breathing. She had always been unfailingly polite to him, and yet she never fawned over him the way other girls did. Perhaps he would have taken it as an insult if she had spent her attentions elsewhere, but Hermione never fawned over anyone. So when he saw her at the graduation ball, he had asked that one of his Knights introduce them. He ignored the moment of hesitation in Rosier's eyes, and smiled politely as if the waiting didn't bother him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He had felt a sense of satisfaction at her sudden blush. As if he were to be the one to thaw the ice queen. But then she was back to her normal coolness. Her eyes watched him appraisingly, lips barely curled into a smile. It infuriated him. How easily she could dismiss him. As if she was anymore important than he was. So after their brief introduction, he began to quietly ask around. Why wasn't Hermione Black married yet? Did she have any suitors? Did she have some sort of disease no one was aware of? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The responses he got were often stilted, and disjointed. Apparently, Hermione had upset quite a few scions over the years. As far as anyone knew she was a sane as the Black's came, was in incredible health and showed no interest in suitor's of any kind. Rumor has it that she refused to marry, because she'd much rather explore the world. And so, a plan began to form in Tom Riddle's mind. An obsessive plan to make the insufferable witch his. He would need to proceed carefully, for this was the highest stakes he had ever played for. Imagine if he were able to gain her hand in marriage, the amount of respect and reverie it would bring. Oh he already had their reverence, but to take the ice queen, and make her his Lady? Well, no man would ever doubt his powers of persuasion again. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So at the Season's first ball he had managed to dance with her. The brief touches set his skin alight, and his groin to stir. She had smelt of honey and cinnamon, as well as a floral scent he couldn't quite place. Her womanly curves were showed off modestly in the expensive ball gown she wore. The feel of velvet under his hands, made him wonder which would be softer, her dress or her skin? Once the dance had finished he had made his way to her father. Phineas Black was an imposing man, easily in his late sixties, with graying salt and pepper hair, and cool mercurial eyes that matched his daughter's. Approaching the man for a brief word made a tendril of something curl in his stomach. He wouldn't dare admit it was anticipation or nervousness. He was the heir to  Salazar Slytherin, and such feelings were below him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Mr. Black, I'd like to have word with you, concerning your daughter." Tom spoke quietly, lest any nosy busy bodies hear. Phineas raised on eyebrow as if saying 'do you now?', but motioned Tom over to one of the darker corners of the room. Turning on his heel, Phineas regarded the young man before him. Merope Gaunt's only son was devastatingly handsome, a blessing considering the turn the whole family had taken in the later years. No one knew who the boy's father was, but seeing that Riddle was not a wizarding name, many speculated a muggle father. It was of no concern to Phineas who the boy's father was. After all </span>
  <em>
    <span>he</span>
  </em>
  <span> wasn't asking about his Princess. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"What might I do for you Mr. Riddle?" Phineas inquired, eyes fixed on the wizard before him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tom swallowed, and straightened himself further, "I'd like permission to formally court your daughter, sir."  Tom prepared himself for the sting of rejection he hoped didn't come. He hated the feeling of unwantedness that came with it. He was Tom Marvolo Riddle, dammit, and he didn't need anyone's acceptance. It didn't matter anyways, he was set to become the next Dark Lord. After all, he'd already killed three people and tortured nearly a dozen more. He knew more about the Dark Arts than anyone else he knew, he could manipulate anyone to do his bidding, and his power was rivaled only by the likes of Dumbledore and Grindelwald. If he were perhaps very lucky, those two would kill each other, and he would be free to step into his role as the Dark Lord formally. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Phineas' booming laughter was the last thing he expected to hear. Frowning he stared at the man as he clamped a hand on his shoulder. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Does Hermione know you're asking me this?" Phineas chortled. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tom's frown deepened, "No, sir." He answered slowly, utterly confused. What did it matter if she knew he was interested in courting her or not? She was a daughter of an Ancient and Noble House and she would do as her father bid her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"You've a lot to learn about her, boy. I'll make you a deal. If you can convince her to ask me to allow you to court her. I'll grant you my full blessing." Phineas smiled, teeth glinting in the dark shadows where they stood. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Something told Tom that getting Hermione to agree to a formal courtship with him would be easier said than done. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They were at yet another gathering, and Tom had made his way to the edges of the dancefloor. He brushed off the vapid girls that surrounded him like they were merely annoying pieces of lint that clung to him. He only had eyes for one witch, and she stood surrounded by her cousin's Walburga and Lucretia, as well as one of the Shafiq girls. he could see how the other girl's tittered around her, while Hermione looked bored by whatever they were saying. He could tell that she was making the appropriate noises and movements though, based on the happy smiles on the others faces. Taking a slow sip of his champagne he made his way around the floor, never taking his eyes off of her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Clearing his throat as he approached, he smiled charmingly at the other women, before settling on Hermione once again. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Miss Black, would you do me the honor of dancing with me, again?" He kept his voice soft, and stared directly into her eyes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The blush was back and he felt a surge of pride that he had been the one to cause it. She placed her hand gently into his own, and he marvelled at how small it was compared to his. Lifting her hand he lead her into a Waltz seamlessly, twirling her away from the now giggling trio. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He smiled down at her, surprised when she breathed out a deep sigh. Raising his eyebrow in question, he felt a smirk grace his lips. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Thank you. They're all dear girls, but one more comment about marriage and babies and I was going to scream." Hermione huffed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tom's lips quirked, "You don't desire marriage and children? But I thought that was every pureblood girls dream." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was really quite lucky that Hermione had revealed such a thing to him. Perhaps he could find out why she was so averse to marriage, and be the one to change her mind. He couldn't care about children either way. After years in Wool's Orphanage, he had come to detest the little blighters. Noisy and sticky and snotty as they were. Though, perhaps wizarding children would be different. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione rolled her eyes and sniffed delicately, "Perhaps that might be true of the tart's you're used to, but some of us actually have brains we'd like to use."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Oh?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her forehead wrinkled as she took a moment to assess him. Was he truly interested or was it merely a ploy? Seeing no obvious signs of deceit she relaxed slightly. Internally telling the voice screaming at her to run or to kill the young wizard in front of her to shut up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Yes. For instance, I'd rather like to see the world. Explore the ruins of Alexandria, trek through the Amazon Rainforest, see Stonehenge and the Louvre. " Hermione's eyes shone with excitement as she spoke of her dreams. And Tom felt himself smiling in return, so it seemed that the ice queen wasn't so frozen after all. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"And why can't you? After all Evangeline Shafiq explores the world all the time in her work. Of course that in itself is rather scandalous, isn't it?" Tom inquired, moving them into a complicated foxtrot, along with the other dancers. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione fell into step effortlessly and let out an annoyed sigh, "Mother has convinced father that it's far too dangerous for an unwed woman to go gallivanting across the globe without a proper chaperone. And most of the available wizards would rather have a pretty trophy to show off, while they globetrot." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tom smiled at Hermione's eagerness to share her frustrations. Undoubtedly non-Slytherin of her, but very useful for him indeed. An idea was solidifying in his mind. He already had desires to travel the world, exploring more of the Dark Arts along the way. Why not take a wife with him? One who was frighteningly intelligent and from a affluent and influential family. One whose family magic was deeply steeped into the Dark Arts itself? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"That is a conundrum. Have you considered hiring a chaperone?" He queried intently. If she hadn't, he would ensure that no one would willingly travel with her. And if she had, it simply cornered her even more.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Yes," She ground out bitterly, " Father won't allow it." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tom nodded sympathetically at that. Inside, however he was ecstatic.He now had enough information to begin to put his plan into place, but first he would need to ensure he gained Hermione's affections. And looking at the beautiful witch before him, he couldn't say it would be such a hardship.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione awoke drenched in sweat, with tears pouring from her eyes. Another of those terrible dreams. Blood had flowed in rivulets down the stairs of Hogwarts. Echoes of screams surrounded her, as she was running. Running, but the walls were closing in on her, and a faceless man was gaining quickly. His skin was bone white, with terrifying red eyes, and two slits for a nose. His long spindly fingers had just managed to grab her robe, when she woke up to the sounds of her own screams. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was a monster, this Lord Voldemort, one that was seemingly determined to haunt her dreams. Frowning, she took a moment to breathe deeply, calming her racing heart. He was not in her dreams every night. On some nights it was the wild-haired witch who looked so much like her, it was eery. She would carve into her flesh with a bone handled knife, before using her wand to cast crucio after crucio upon her. Hermione had never felt the curse herself, but the phantom pains that would run through her body after that made sure she had an idea of what it would feel like. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Closing her eyes, she ignored the voice in her mind telling her that there was a connection between this Lord Voldemort and Tom Riddle. It was a preposterous thought. The Black Madness afflicting her once again. Calling softly for her elf, she requested a vial of Dreamless Sleep Potion, knowing there was no other way she would be getting rest tonight. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When Hermione awoke again she felt rested for the first time in weeks. Glancing at the clock that adorned her wall, she let out a startled gasp. She had missed breakfast, and if she didn't hurry, she would miss lunch as well. Scrambling through her routine, she was able to make it to the dining table with a few moments to spare. Her father glanced at her worriedly over his cup of tea, and Hermione sent him a small smile. She knew her silencing spells were strong enough to contain her nightmares, but he would surely noticed the vial of Dreamless Sleep missing from his stores. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Hello Father." She greeted politely, crossing her fingers that he would let the subject drop for now. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Phineas sighed, but greeted his daughter warmly, "Hello, princess." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Smiling brightly at her father's pet name for her, Hermione turned her attention to the spread of food before her. Grabbing a blueberry scone, she waited for her father to finish taking a drink of tea. A question had been burning on her mind since the night she first danced with Tom, and now without her mother's chittering, she felt comfortable enough to ask him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Father, what is your opinion of Tom Riddle?" She held her breath. She rarely asked questions about the wizards she met, and desperately hoped he didn't set about drawing up a marriage contract for them. She didn't think he would, but he would inform her mother, who would pressure him to do so. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Phineas eyed his daughter for a moment, "From what I know, he's incredibly intelligent. Charming, and a favorite student of Professor Slughorn. His mother was Merope Gaunt, and there's speculation about his father. Why do you ask?" </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione took a delicate bite of her scone, thinking carefully as she chewed and swallowed, "Because he's unlike any other wizard I've ever met. He seems to be interested in me, and as a person, not just as some trophy."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Phineas smiled smugly at his daughter, he had always told her that one day a man would come along and gain her interest. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"He asked my permission to formally court you." It was the wrong thing to say. Hermione's features turned into a scowl and she stabbed the bit of salad before her viciously. Phineas sighed, and felt the inane urge to pull his hair out by it's roots. He loved his daughter. He loved her fierce spirit and her unwillingness to be cowed, he loved her stubbornness for all the grief it gave him. But he wanted her to be happy. He knew she would never be happy in some manor hosting balls and tea parties while elves raised her children. No, his daughter wanted to explore the world and all it's secrets. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"And I suppose you gave him your approval then?" Hermione huffed in annoyance, ignoring the pang of hurt that seemed to be growing in her chest.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"No." Phineas shifted enough to place his hand on her arm, "I told him, that he would have my blessing if, and only if, you came to me asking for him to be the one to court you formally."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione glanced up at her father in surprise. Tears welled in her eyes, and she cursed her emotional hormones. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"You're giving me a choice? You're giving me </span>
  <em>
    <span>the</span>
