  <em> Note before the story: Everyone who died during any wars or whatever are still alive, because it’s more fun that way. Thank you, bye. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Note number 2: Soccer (football for British people) is the muggle version of quidditch in this story. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Note number 3: The time periods are obviously messed up - just go with it. And pretend they happened at the same time, but they were 100% unaware of each other because.... um... external forces. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Note number 4: Everyone (all the fantasy people) is in ninth grade. The other three grades... are all mortals. Sorry. </em>

  <b>Chapter 1: Harry Potter POV: The Letter</b>
</p><p>
  <em> July 1, 7:57am </em>
</p><p>Harry Potter woke up from a dreamless sleep. He checked the time - it was almost 8:00 am. He remembered the war that had just ended only a few months ago and mentally celebrated. His best friend, Ronald Weasley, was still snoring loudly in the bed next to him. Right. He was at the Burrow.</p><p>In the other room, he could hear Ginny and Hermione chatting happily. They were talking about Hogwarts. Harry looked at the sleeping Ron, and decided to join the girls. He walked over, and knocked on the door.</p><p>“Can I come in?”</p><p>“Sure!” Hermione’s voice replied. Harry went inside the room.</p><p>“So what were you two talking about?” he asked casually.</p><p>“Just Hogwarts,” Ginny replied. “I’m going to take my seventh year. Hermione’s sad because she missed her last year thanks to your lovely Horcrux Hunting adventures.”</p><p>Suddenly, there were three owls tapping at the window. They looked like the Hogwarts school owls.</p><p>“Three owls? Isn’t Ginny the only one going this year?” Hermione sounded more excited than curious.</p><p>Harry went over and opened the window. He took his letter and read it.</p><p>“Hermione... we get to redo our seventh year if we want!” he exclaimed.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Meanwhile, in the other room, Ron was still sleeping. The poor owl kept tapping at the window, but Ron wasn’t waking up. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The letter basically said something like this:</p><p>“Dear Mr. Potter,</p><p>We are inviting you to redo your seventh year! Any seventh years from last year who choose to do this are going to be taking special classes. Dumbledore says it’s a surprise. We await your owl no later than 31 July. Term starts September 1, but we want you to come August 28 at 3:30pm. Please apparate to Hogsmeade and then have a nice walk.</p><p>Professor McGonagall”</p><p> </p><p>“We are totally doing this,” Hermione said. “Special classes, no student in Hogwarts history has ever been able to take any of these classes! Well, none of them had some war against a Dark Wizard, but still. We can’t miss this chance!”</p><p>Harry, Hermione, and Ginny sent a reply back to Hogwarts on the school owls.</p><p>“Wait,” Harry paused. “What about Ron?”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> In the other room, the owl had given up tapping and was sitting there patiently. Ron was still sleeping soundly. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry walked into their room and saw Ron.</p><p>“Um, how long has it been already?” He checked the time. “It’s already 9:30, someone get a bucket of water! We are waking him up the easy way!”</p><p>“No need!” Ginny was smiling evilly. “Aguamenti!”</p><p>A stream of water splashed into Ron.</p><p>“AAAAAAH!” he screamed. “SPIDERS!!! THEY ARE DANCING AND... oh. What was that for?” he accused.</p><p>“The owl has been there for a while Ron, you should let it in,” Hermione chided.</p><p>Ron read the letter, looked like he was going to die of annoyance, realized both Harry and Hermione were probably going to do it, so he also sent his reply.</p><p>“Special classes though,” Ron muttered. “What is it, therapy for the war?”</p><p>
