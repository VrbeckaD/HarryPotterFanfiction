    <p>Once not so long ago, a world now wreathed in flames and filled with naught but ash and creatures of the worst sort once cheered at the return of the Girl Who Died protecting the Boy Who Lived returning to life and her acceptance to the greatest Wizarding school in the magical world, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Raised under a false name under the careful watch of her Uncle in hiding, Regulas Black and her Godmother Minerva McGonagal until she was able to reclaim her name and face the stares and comments towards her great absence. All starting with a smirk from the tall woman reading the long scroll of names who cleared her throat and clearly read aloud, “Jaqiearae Black.”</p><p>But just when the wars they imagined to be over, the Boy Who Lived, didn’t, leaving only the Girl Who Died, and died, and died to save what was left of their world. With the school in flames and crumbling around them Albus Dumbledore rallied the mandrake doubles of his students. An illegal act, creating doubles of anyone for purposes of war, one that had her sentenced to a lifetime of serving the school she’d fought so hard to defend in place of her being sentenced to Azkaban for that and her role as a Death Eater to gain information for the Aurors.</p><p>Calming the students and guiding them back to their dormitories once they were secured as the Aurors secured the grounds and checked that after the Dark Lord fell his followers were rounded up and locked away. But much like the Hydra, you cut off one head and more pop up to claim their place. Just as the dust was settling on his grave three different fractions rose and started their own reign of terror. So in yet another last ditch effort Dumbledore’s Army and Order of the Phoenix members already bearing Dark Marks split into groups, using their already tight bonds with the dark Wizards to infiltrate their ranks.</p><p>Word spread of a single joining event, all three planning on attacking at once. Without time or chance to warn anyone they dared to trust in the Auror system a plan was set in motion and followed to the T, sparing thousands that would have otherwise died. Under the cover of darkness the teen spies all split through the barriers of the homes the dark armies were claiming as headquarters and raced out silently, snatching any and all Muggles, animals, towns and suburbs along the way leaving large patches of nothingness behind.</p><p>Ensuring of as many innocent lives and resources could be spared as the others in Dumbledore’s Army rounded up all student and their relatives of the three Wizarding schools of the east still standing freely, shrinking their homes, schools and marketplaces as others in the Order of Phoenix and other trusted Aurors hid all creatures and locations they could of their world to be rehoused later in a safer location yet to be determined.</p><p>…</p><p>Swarms of broomsticks and various flying objects and creatures flew straight into the floating open door of your home leading out to the secret lands you’d entrapped it in years prior for it’s secrecy through your faked death and later search for the horcruxes. All filling the space you’d allotted them while the small group of your closest allies joined you on a long racing flight through enemy lines you blasted your way through with the aid of your two shielded Dragons you and Charlie Weasley were in charge of guarding, Norberta and Opal.</p><p>With one last barrage of curses you cast the enemy forces split and a town came into view through the melting barrier you had broken with a long thought forgotten enchantment in Draconic. Gripping your brooms tighter you and Charlie felt the shrunken Dragons curl around your backs tightly as the portkey Seamus called for and enlarged it for everyone to get a hold flew straight at your forming circle. But just as you latched onto it your eyes opened wider as the enchanted and tattered book flipped open and sucked you all inside.</p><p>.</p><p>All around you words swirled and the flapping of pages grew into a colorful blur as what once was a white world with black blurry stripes grew into a painful collision with your gasping at being the first of Dumbledore’s Army to crash into the mahogany door sealing off a small closet and the carpet coated floor inside. A quick shift of your hand had the group of brooms shrinking to save them from damage.</p><p>One after another crashing through the opening and falling on top of you and Charlie, sending pained groans through the small home as your pile of squirming teens climbed and wiggled your way free from the split door. One by one they all ducked in the main hall avoiding the low ceilings and beams aiding the next in line as the two Dragons climbed down from their gripped position on the top of the split door, having jumped off just before your crash.</p><p>With another groan you were helped up by your adopted Twin Brothers, Fred and George, both chuckling as they brushed your bloodied and matted pale silvery blue curls slipping free from your loose ponytail formerly covering your purple eyes that appeared green when looked at from the side. Gently they helped shift your torn flannel shirt over your blood stained tank top from the slowly bleeding wound on your shoulder. Then shifted your bangs off your reddened cheek that was already covered by the massive pink swirling scar covering nearly the entire left side of your face under your side swept bangs from when the Dark Lord tried to kill you and your Cousin Harry as children.</p><p>George, “No worries.”</p><p>Fred nodded and brushed your ponytail back over your back, “All upright now.”</p><p>Your head turned to Seamus in a steadying grip on the arched beam you limped out under, eyeing the teen who was sitting down gripping the wrist he’d landed hard on as Dean helped him wrap a long bandage around it. “Seamus? What, exactly, did you use as a portkey?”</p><p>In another staggering step on your badly throbbing dislocated left leg your weight shifted back to your right with the twins to support you he replied, “Professor Dumbledore said to pick something they wouldn’t find, so I picked this old book my Gran used to prop up her seeing glass with.”</p><p>Running your fingers over your face Hermione sighed blinking her tear reddened stinging eyes leaning back against the wall under Ginny’s depressed and slumped cried out frame against her chest, “You’re not supposed to use books Seamus.”</p><p>Seamus, “Why not?”</p><p>Turning your head you caught sight of a short man with a chestnut head of curls eyeing you from behind a doorway with an even taller man in all grey with his beard pooling over the shorter man’s face.</p><p>Percy, “The Wizard Merlin used a book as a portkey once and hasn’t been seen since.”</p><p>With a quiet head nod the twins led you closer to the wall placing you in full view of the peering pair as well as the group of scowling bearded men behind them. After a weak chuckle you said, “Hi. Sorry to intrude. Bit of a mix up on our escape plan. Sorry for the damage and the shock.” You glanced back at the closet drawing your wand from the sheath in your pocket, which with a simple flick mended the closet and door back to its former state drawing the pair out as the taller of the two stated, “You’re a Wizard?”</p><p>You nodded, “We all are.” They glanced over the group of mangled and blood soaked teens, all having to either break free of physically tortured roles in gaining trust of your faked allies or the escape itself.</p><p>Stepping forward the tall man extended his hand and said, “I am Gandalf the Grey. You’re all so young.”</p><p>You smiled, switching your wand to your other hand and shook his hand, “Jaqi Black.” His brow rose, “Family name, not a title.” Causing him to nod his head with a relieved smile.</p><p>One by one you pointed to each of the group, “Fred, George, their brothers Percy, Charlie and Bill, all the redheads are Weasley’s, their Sister Ginny in on Hermione Granger.” In her head nod her eyes shifted to the familiar blonde in the bunch of short men whose shoulder bumped into his brother’s holding his wide eyed stare on her making her shift her gaze to Ginny again to keep from blushing recognizing him from your dreams on the trio from years prior.</p><p>“Cedric Diggory, Victor Krum, Oliver Wood, Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood beside Draco Malfoy, then Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan, and, where are…” Your head turned as a loud roar sounded over head, “Ahh, there’s Hagrid.” The roar died and with a knock at the door two crouched figures appeared after Alastor had used his eye to search the houses to find you all, having you finish, “Harid on the right and Alastor Moody on the left. There’s more but they’re in the school and at home.”</p><p>With a curious expression over your head from the smaller man you giggled and held your hands up aiding the Dragons that had walked across the thick doorframe to crawl down to your shoulders and you to say, “And Norberta and Opal.”</p><p>With a firm grip on his ax the sternest of the group neared the short man as he stated, “Bilbo, Bilbo Baggins.”</p><p>You smiled at him, “Pleasure to meet you Mr Baggins. Again, so sorry for having interrupted your party.” Making the small Hobbit grin for a moment until his eye wandered to the still flowing trickle of blood down your chest through your shallow breaths at your badly bruised ribs. Looking up at the man creeping over with his ax you asked, “And your name?”</p><p>He scowled at the creatures on your shoulders as Gandalf stated, “This is Thorin Oakenshield, future King of Erebor.”</p><p>Thorin, “What is the meaning of this Gandalf? You urge us to secrecy and yet you bring these children and their, beasts, to our meeting?”</p><p>Your eyes lowered to Bilbo as he eyed the other rooms trying to see if anyone else was hiding there causing him to flinch slightly and smile at you nervously, “Your home, I presume?” He nodded, “We do apologize for intruding, normally our magic is blocked from allowing us to enter the homes of others unwelcome, it wasn’t our intention.”</p><p>Thorin, “And just what were you intending?”</p><p>Your eyes shifted to him, “We were escaping a war, and used an enchanted item, that was supposed to take us out to a hidden island, there we were meant to regroup and move forward from there, but Seamus didn’t know we’re not supposed to use books, and we got sucked inside and here we are.”</p><p>A soft clearing of a throat sounded from a white haired man behind Thorin who gently tapped Thorin’s hand to lower his ax and say, “Excuse me Miss, you appear to be bleeding. Perhaps we could aid you in your mending and we can discuss this further.”</p><p>You nodded and glanced at Bilbo, “You look hungry. Should be about time for supper. Allow us to make up for the intrusion.”</p><p>The teens around you all rose as tall as they could manage as you snapped your fingers and a door appeared causing Bilbo flinch again and eye both sides of it curiously, with a smile you met his eye saying, “I promise you won’t be harmed.”</p><p>He nodded and followed your group, all limping your way through the long dim hall that opened, after a colored wheel turned beside the door on the other end, to the Hospital Wing in Hogwarts. Side by side the group of teachers all grouped around the bruise and burn coated figures of Snape and Regulus both sharing a bed, eager to count the number of survivors of the brave teens leading the charge.</p><p>With a relieved exhale Minerva raced to you and the twins pulling you into a tight hug and ushered you over to the bed closest you while Bilbo and Gandalf both led the timid group of Dwarves through the doorway. In a curious glance from you to the group Dumbledore stepped forward, meeting Gandalf who met him halfway to share introductions, with Gandalf fully assuming he might possibly be the head Wizard in charge.</p><p>Albus, “Welcome, I am Albus Dumbledore.”</p><p>Gandalf shook his hand, “Gandalf the Grey.”</p><p>And he motioned to his side at Bilbo who was eyeing the giant pair of phoenixes gathered around you crying over your wounds healing them, that were slowly being exposed layer by layer as you stripped while the other adults claimed a teen to start tending to. Around you Regulus and Severus sat listening to your assumed head count of those you had seen take hits. Minerva eased the list in her hands down ticking off each survivor with Sirius, Tonks, Harry, Remus, Arthur and Ron the last ones you had no clue what had happened to them. Harry and Tonks at least you could ask the clearly distressed Ginny for information on them as they had taken your portkey to fetch her themselves. A ruffle of your hair from Regulus’ wand helped to clean your hair of blood after the cuts on your scalp were healed.</p><p>“This is Bilbo Baggins, and the rest of our Company, Thorin Oakenshield, his heirs Fili and Kili. And his Cousins and other kin Dwalin, Balin. Oin, Gloin. Bifur, Bofur, Bombur. Dori, Nori and Ori.” Each bowing their heads as they were introduced before the teachers were introduced.</p><p>Glancing around Thorin asked, “What is this place?”</p><p>You met his gaze as you rose right after a loud crack from your formerly dislocated left hip and knee being popped back in place with a brace added over your knee. Holding your gaze on him you pulled on your freshly magically washed shirt over the self cleaning tank top in the pinch you gave it making it wave then settle around you again. “Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”</p><p>Thorin’s brow rose at your lack of a reaction to the pain clearly showing in your eyes, “A school for Wizards?” You nodded, “Are you, are you all students?”</p><p>Dumbledore motioned his hand to you as the door opened and Mrs Weasley raced in and drew you and her children into tight tear stained hugs tearily ignoring the absence of her son and husband. The very pregnant Fleur waddled in slowly beside Dobby and Kreacher who were holding the hands of your Nephew Teddy slowly walking between them. “Miss Black is our Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor.” Causing their eyes to shift to you as you bent to grab Teddy and give a gasping smile at him while you raised him to your hip pecking him on the cheek. Next your Aunt Narcissa Black and her Husband Lucius walked in with relieved smiles on their quiet path to their Son’s side giving him calming hugs and helped to clean him up as well.</p><p>Thorin met your eyes again after your hair shifted to a bright yellow to match Teddy’s after his excited giggle as Opal nuzzled her head against his while Norberta flew to Charlie’s shoulders again. “You let your child around that creature?”</p><p>“Opal would never harm a soul, unless provoked and left no other option. Antipodean Opaleye’s are notoriously docile and friendly. All the more cruel why someone had chained her in a bank to guard their hoard after they caught and blinded her.” Causing his lips to part, “I’m not certain what grudge you hold against the Dragons of your world, but ours share our emotions, no matter the size or defense they hold, they all only attack out of fear. We respect them and they respect us.”</p><p>You met Bilbo’s eyes as your hair turned back to silvery blue and said, “Right, Supper.” Turning to Dumbledore you said, “We’re early for Supper still, correct?”</p><p>To which he nodded, “We can add a few more tables to the end of ours, plenty of food to go around.”</p><p>Bilbo nodded and smiled at you softly, saying “Thank you.”</p><p>After another catching of Thorin’s curious gazes at Dobby and Kreacher you said, “Do you have a problem against House Elves as well?”</p><p>His eyes rose to yours as he playfully repeated with a growing smirk mirrored on his kin’s faces, “House Elves?” You nodded, and he shook his head, “No, no problem at all.”</p><p>You rolled your eyes and let Draco grab Teddy as you accepted the crutch Fred had passed you and led the way through the castle. After speaking to Regulus and Severus Narcissa and Lucius turned to your enchanted doorway joining Alastor for another search over the sleeping city for any sign of others lost along the way.</p><p>Barely five feet into the hall leading to the Great Hall the Dwarves’ smiles dropped at the flood of cries coming from the hoards of children all sniffling and rubbing their faces as older teens and young adults they knew tried to calm them. Each glancing up at you as you passed for the long path to the empty tables filling with the children that rose in tears from their magically mist induced naps at the tremors due to the use of the portkey to join you for the meal.</p><p>Softly through the sea of distressed students the tap of your crutch was heard and halfway around the teacher’s table a weak grin split across your face seeing Barty trotting over to you through the crowds and curious Dwarves. In a rush at once you were engulfed in a warm hug as you shifted your crutch to the side heading him mumble into your hair, “There you are, Darling.”</p><p>In his pull back the little hand on Em’s raised arm patted your badly bruised once split cheek and you said, “Just a bruise. It doesn’t hurt.”</p><p>Barty ushered you around the table, “Come, let’s get you settled and fed.”</p><p>Once in your chair your crutch stood behind it and in a reach over to you Em was claimed and settled on your lap mumbling, “We all shook Mummy.”</p><p>With a grin you answered sweetly, “Yes, well, we’re safe now.” At her large yawn you kissed her cheek and said, “Now, I believe it’s story time.”</p><p>With a sleepy nod from her Barty lifted her again after her hug around your neck you felt the eyes of the settling Dwarves on you through. A peck on the cheek later and Barty said, “Sleep tonight. You need it.”</p><p>“I know.” Peering up at him he stole another peck on your cheek and grinned at Em saying, “Now, which story did you want tonight?” In his stroll back through the vast hall towards the open doors leaving the oldest Dwarves muttering between themselves in their own gravely language at a guess for how old you were as they began to notice the slight point growing on all your ears.</p><p>In their new seats the younger Dwarves mumbled to each other about where all the adults were before Ori asked, “Miss Black?”</p><p>Your brow rose in the turn of your head to face him, “Yes Ori?”</p><p>In a hushed tone he asked, “Where are all their parents?”</p><p>Averted gazes from the teachers close by as well as a few from the DA did as well while you answered, “Like I said, we were escaping a war. Their parents sent their children to us for safe keeping, we managed to save the adults able to make it to the meeting points in time. We saved who we could.”</p><p>Ori asked in a trembling tone, “Who would attack children?”</p><p>After a steady exhale you replied after glancing over the Dwarves giving all the hundreds of quieting children claiming their seats with the aids of hundreds of house Elves pained glances, “In our world no child is safe. Any and all creatures were targets. The adults did what they could, but we had to learn to defend ourselves.”</p><p>Thorin, “So you formed the school?”</p><p>“No, we formed our own armies.” Causing their lips to part, “There isn’t a teen over thirteen that hasn’t seen some form of battle since the war began. This school among others have been around for centuries.” In a shift of your gaze you eyed Neville releasing his baby sister Nellie from her tight hug, having shared the news of what had happened and that you were all safe now inside the world of the book.</p><p>The usual gasps filled the hall at the magically filling tables causing Bilbo’s face to light up at the selection mumbling, “I’m in Hobbit Heaven.” Then filled his plate as you did the same with the Dwarves slowly joining in after you assured them they were not taking any of your supplies and there was plenty to go around.</p><p>After dinner was over Albus rose and gave a small speech that they had now found a new world, one that they would be safe in that was far from the war and dark Wizards that had hunted them. But curiously enough for the Dwarves most of the children all glanced to you after and only seemed to relax at your confirming nod.</p><p>.</p><p>On your feet again you guided the men back through the emptying Great Hall where they watched the children wishing you a good night as you did the same naming them in return turning for the distant dormitories guided by the other Professors and older teens among your group. All who were helping to take care of the younger children taking up newly formed dormitories in the school and toddlers and infants. Over their heads Norberta and Opal flew to speak with Fawkes and the giant Phoenixes. Back again into the main hall you made your way to your waiting enchanted door only to see Lucius, Alastor and Narcissa enter again shaking their heads, “No sign of them.”</p><p>With a nod you said, “Well, maybe they landed farther along in the book?”</p><p>Alastor, “We’ll smoke them out eventually.” Patting you on the shoulder in his move past you, “Don’t you be staying up too late now. I won’t be having you passing out on us. Padfoot might be loose but I will not be letting you slide out of pace.”</p><p>Narcissa said, “I’ll keep watch over Teddy tonight.” Giving you a gentle hug in her move past you.</p><p>“Thanks.” Through the door you led the way and once inside the smial again Thorin asked, “Who is Padfoot? Should we be concerned?”</p><p>Turning to face him you shook your head, “Padfoot is my father’s nickname. Him and my uncles and my brother Ron didn’t land with us. They’re off alone,” in a glance at the window you mumbled, “Harry and Tonks are somewhere too, unless they blocked a curse from Ginny so she could make it through.”</p><p>Thorin, “I apologize for your missing people, though we cannot aid you in searching for them. We must wake early to barter for horses.”</p><p>Shaking your head you said, “If they were close by I would know it.” Making his eyes narrow, “My bloodline, we can all sense one another. They are too far from me to sense them.”</p><p>Thorin met your gaze as you accepted the offer to move into the sitting room around the still lit fire, “What, what is your plan now? For your people?”</p><p>You exhaled slowly, leaning against Fred’s side on your right, “First we need to find an unclaimed stretch of land to set up our homes. These are just the children from the Wizarding World, there are more hidden in our protected homes, then we still have the non-magic population to rehome as well.”</p><p>Balin, “Non-Magic?”</p><p>Fred, “Like us, but without the powers.”</p><p>Kreacher popping up in front of you drew your gaze and handed you a slip of paper, “The Muggles have been fed my Mistress.”</p><p>Dobby appeared at his side adding, “Though their ears haven’t changed as the Wizards have.”</p><p>“Good to know. Thank you.” They bowed their heads and zapped off to your home to join in watching over Teddy and the others.</p><p>After a small momentary huddle initiated by Fili alerting his uncle to his need to know Hermione better, Thorin turned back to you and said, “Out past the Misty Mountains there is plenty of land to claim.”</p><p>“Misty Mountains?”</p><p>He nodded, “We would show you, for a fair trade.”</p><p>“What sort of trade?”</p><p>Thorin nodded his head to the sleeping Dragons, “You tame Dragons, we happen to be heading after a Dragon who stole our home.”</p><p>“So we handle the Dragon for directions?”</p><p>He shook his head, “There’s a destroyed city at the base of our Mountain called Dale, you handle our Dragon, do whatever you will with him, and we grant you the ownership of Dale.”</p><p>After a glance at Charlie to the left of George, refusing to leave you with the strangers, who shrugged through a nod, you extended your hand to the Dwarf who rose with a smirk to accept your shake, “You’ve got yourself a deal.”</p><p>Approaching with a table hovering beside him Gandalf pulled out a map he laid across it and shared a better view of where you were headed as well as informing you of a large stretch of Southern Greenwood unclaimed for centuries now. A topic that stirred the mention of Moria, bringing up a creature, later upon research in one of your books on mythical creatures was discovered to be defeated quite easily.</p><p>With a nod Thorin rose from the table stating, “Well, Miss Black, we should get our rest. As I said, we rise early to barter for horses in the morning. We’re leaving by sunrise.”</p><p>He paused at your black brow rising, “Wouldn’t flying be easier?”</p><p>Thorin lowly asked, “I am not flying on a Dragon.”</p><p>You smirked back, “And ours would never allow you to mount them. I meant Thestrals.”</p><p>Thorin, “Thestrals?” Causing you to nod and draw out your magical creatures book summoned from home you opened to their page explaining what they were to the curious group of huddled Dwarves.</p><p>.</p><p>It didn’t take long for the men to make their way to their preferred beds while you turned back for your door that led you straight into your home. Charlie and the Twins hurried off to spread news of your deal and round up volunteers for the first leg of the journey in the morning.</p><p>Right onto the glass wrapped ballroom you went and eyed the sky mirroring the one around the bag holding your hoard of shrunken dwellings. Canus Major was right in front and as the clouds rolled in to hasten the snow coming in you sighed and turned to your bedroom. Glumly on the bed Ginny sat and looked up at you watching your path to her side. Leaving your crutches by the bed you magically pulled off your shoes leaving them by the bed easing your task of settling up against your pillows. “Hey Gin.”</p><p>Tearfully in the quiver of her lip she asked, “I told him I never wanted to see him again!” After a sniffle she said, “Then the ass goes and says he loves me, and to be happy. Then pushed me and Tonks to the portkey when the group spotted me taking the last of their library.”</p><p>“Tonks was with you then?”</p><p>Looking at you she wiped her cheek asking, “She wasn’t with-, why, didn’t Dad and Ron show up with her?”</p><p>You shook your head, “They must have fallen somewhere later in the book.”</p><p>“We are going to look for them, aren’t we?”</p><p>“Alastor, Narcissa and Lucius took a flight trying to look for them around the city,” you shook your head, “No sight so far. First we have to help the Dwarves resettle so we can settle in their old city of Dale. Then we can spread out a full search of, what they call Middle Earth.” In the quivering of her lip your hand settled on hers resting on her leg and you said, “We’ll find them. No doubt the longer we are here I’m bound to get a glimpse of where they are, or they might even be on the way.”</p><p>Ginny nodded and sniffled again wiping her cheek, “Can I sleep with you?”</p><p>You nodded, “Of course.”</p><p>“Maybe if I’m with you I won’t dream about Harry.”</p><p>“Well if you don’t want to dream I can help there too,” waving your hand calling a vial of dreamless draught from your office you passed over she downed and you laid back with her snuggling close in the dimming of the lights to get some sleep. Though as she drifted off your slitted eyes flashed to silver and you watched the memory of Harry sacrificing himself to save the pair and how Tonks blocked a fireball curse from hitting Ginny and got sent off on her own. Forcing your eyes shut you tried to clear your mind focusing on your meditations to refocus calming yourself to head off to sleep yourself hoping for a dream of your father.</p><p>.</p><p>Inhaling deeply your eyes cracked open at the mooing of your alarm clock you silenced then struggled to your feet to brush your teeth offering a spare brush to Ginny. Combing your hair was next to pull it back up into another ponytail before adding your boots and limping your way down to breakfast finding the Twins, Bill, Percy, Luna, Draco and Neville all up around the table filling their plates from the spread Regulus had set out as you took your own seat to eat as much as you could before helping to gather the herds you would need.</p><p>A quick stop to the Forbidden Forest later and you were outside the hidden home resting under a tree waiting for the others to wake and exit the home as they had intended. Stolen admiration ended with the cracking of the front door making you turn again ready to help the men up onto the steeds.</p><p>Outside Bagend in the bright sunlight Bilbo eyed the giant carriage borrowed from Madame Maxime the Dwarves had loaded with their belongings, commenting on the spacious mansion housed within discovered to be your family home at Nori’s questioning. One that would house the Dwarves and Wizards not on their flying shift around it through the days, lowly Thorin named the first group to join him on the first leg. After Bilbo’s own inspection leaving his own bags his eyes shifted to the winged pure white horses the Twins ensured to be secured properly. Open mouthed he gawked at the gorgeous creatures before he said, “Those look nothing like the sketches you showed us.”</p><p>You chuckled softly, eyeing the elder Dwarves inching closer to the timid Thestrels sniffing them as they neared, choosing their passengers on their size and smell, “It’s alright Bilbo. You can’t see them, but they’re around us.” He spotted Bofur, the first to climb on his, floating curiously mid air on a shifting invisible body leaving strange hoof marks in the dirt path below. “Which is why, I thought Buckbeak might be a better choice for you.”</p><p>His brow rose, “Buck-beak?”</p><p>You nodded your head and he approached, eying the same clothes you had worn the night before yet scrubbed clean with the large brace on your leg drawing a limp from you as a grey feathered mixed creature stepped from out behind the Pegasus to eye the small man at your side with a curious squawk. “First rule with Hippogriffs Bilbo, is never insult or disrespect them, very proud vain creatures. So when approaching, you bow, like so.”</p><p>He eyed and watched your bow at the waist leading to a curious glance from Buckbeak at why you would request his permission to approach when you cared for and disguised him and his father for the past few years since you and Percy had saved their lives. Bowing in return anyway he squawked at you and nuzzled his beak and forehead against your cheek as you approached before realizing you were training the small man how to greet him properly.</p><p>In another cautious glance over him Buckbeak inhaled then lowered his head in return. After his timid tro closer the Dwarves all watched you help him up onto his back and led Buckbeak to the front of the Pegasus as you walked to straddle your Father’s motorcycle left outside by Hagrid the night prior. Sitting on the seat beside the shrunken dragons in the sidecar at Bilbo’s yearning glance at his home you drew your wand shrinking it into a protective orb. In the spell the gaze of those watching shifted curiously at its sinking and leaving an empty patch of dirt in place of the small house under the hill at the base of a massive tree and surrounding gardens. A gasp left Bilbo at your pocketing the orb you’d trapped it in your bag settled in the sidecar before you met his eye to ask, “You didn’t want to bring it along? I can put it back, it’s a bit of a habit, we never leave our homes behind.”</p><p>He shook his head, “No, thank you. I’d hate to leave it. It will be safe in your bag?”</p><p>You nodded, “It’s enchanted, keeps everything safe inside, besides the orb is enchanted as well.” Making his smile grow. With a smile of your own you kick started the bike revealing the source of the roar from the night before drawing awed expressions on their faces George called out, “Brooms up.” Causing him, Fred, Bill, Percy, Luna, Draco and Neville to hover around you for the first leg of the trip. Steadily you led the path down the road and at the curve took off into the sky with Thorin’s Thestral following after stirring a ripple of the others and Buckbeak to do the same as the Pegasus did the same pulling up the rear.</p><p>Up into the frigid air you inhaled sharply trying not to cry knowing you were heading off leaving those lost to their own just so you could hope these men would be truthful and grant you the land promised to house your people. You wanted this to be true, to be real, and that you would not be left to drastic measures to protect your people and ensure prospering in the future. Still snowflakes fell around you from the clouds above and you tried to keep your gaze off the sidecar where your mother’s cat Crookshanks should be lounging had you not lost your second bag in the trip he was napping in. You should have left him at home, but he kept yowling insisting to go with you and no doubt would teleport to your lap anyways had you left him behind. The bag was enchanted so he should be safe, you hoped he was merely lost with one of the others and could show up one day dragging the bag he was in ready to leap into your arms, as soon as you’d let go of your father whenever he would be found.</p>
