    <p>Remus Lupin knows how to spend time alone, he has spent his whole life alone. He  knows that his mother and father have done the best they can, he knows that his father blames himself for his son’s lycanthropy, he knows that his mother cries on the full moon, and most of all Remus Lupin knows that werewolf children do not have friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The neighborhood kids did not know, of course, why he could never come out to play, and Remus Lupin knew all too well what his mother means when she says, “Are you sure you can go out and play with Grant and Tim? The nights have their magic Remus.”</p>
<p>In his mother's eyes it was always too close to the full moon for him to be among the muggle children. So he stayed inside, and on the full moon he went “camping” and did his best to forget what it felt like to have friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus Lupin knows every constellation visible from the roof of his house in London. His father spells the roof to allow the lights of the stars to outshine the city brights after watching his son trying to count the stars in the sky. Lyall Lupin wears guilt on his back and buys his son every book on astronomy that he can get his hands on. The expansion spell on Remus’ bookshelf allows them all to fit, but only just, and Remus learns about the stars.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He started with the children’s guides, meant for easy use and school teachers with syllabus requirements, then quickly progressed to the thicker books of star charts and constellation names that he could never spell on his own. Remus Lupin watched the stars chase each other across the sky, wished to become a part of it, liked the moon best on its last day of waning, and memorized the lines in the sky.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Year One</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Remus Lupin spends hours atop the astronomy tower upon his entry to Hogwarts. He finds his stars again, the ones that are his favorites, orients himself with the shift in angle, and watches the sky in the same manner as before. He does not know the names of the boys who share his dormitory, and he tries not to feel guilty when one of them has nightmares of wolves. Remus Lupin stops sleeping in his bed and falls asleep trying to decipher the sky, back pressed to the cold stones of the tower. He knows that McGonagall sees him sneak up, but because she hasn’t stopped him yet, he continues his night time trips to the highest point in the castle.</p>
<p>McGonagall started to leave him books of muggle constellations and their myths, and for the second time in his A.B. (After Bite) life, he had something to look forward to at the end of the day. He flew through the books left outside his bed, lifted the heaviest star charts to try to apply to his stars above the castle. The story of the hunter and his dog, the predator’s club turned to a second companion through translation error. The Bootes constellation felt like a metaphor for his life. Remus Lupin found himself lost in the challenge of constellation maps that didn’t move for you, and learned everything that the Hogwarts library could teach him about the cosmos.</p>
<p>It almost feels like contentment, but Remus Lupin is too afraid to hope for that. </p>
