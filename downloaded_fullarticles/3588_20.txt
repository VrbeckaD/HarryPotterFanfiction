    <p>[On the deck of a ship cutting through early morning fog a slim young man with loose blonde hair is climbing the rigging, the rowdy crew beneath him is singing, Greek Chorus style, about the story they’re about to be involved in.]</p><p>I’ll tell you a tale of the waves of the sea,<br/>
And of pirates and merfolk, heave-ho -<br/>
As strange and as different as lovers can be<br/>
On shore and in fathoms below.</p><p>Heave-ho, heave-ho!<br/>
On shore and in fathoms below!</p><p>A prince and a pirate all copper and gold,<br/>
A rollicking tale to behold<br/>
How they met and love joined their fates<br/>
On shore and in fathoms below.</p><p>Heave-ho, heave-ho!<br/>
On shore and in fathoms below!</p><p>[A sudden wind blows the fine blonde hair back from the young pirate’s brow. Draco Malfoy smiles as the clouds part, though his brows draw together as his eye catches an unexpected flash of red in the overwhelming blue of the ocean. The bright red interrupts the surface only for a moment, disappearing beneath the crest of the next wave.]</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>[In a cozy cavern a family of red-headed, merfolk are singing as they cavort and toss shells to one another, having a grand time]</p><p>Oh we are the children of Molly,<br/>
Sea Queen who loves us and raised us well – </p><p>Percy<br/>
Bill<br/>
Charlie<br/>
George<br/>
Ginny<br/>
Fred</p><p>And the youngest brother, whose legs are now gone,<br/>
He got us all cursed to be merfolk, that Ron!</p><p>[The mer-siblings and Molly look around the cavern but Ron is missing. They shrug and go back to chatting, swimming, and sporting around.]</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>[Ron is in a kelp forest, surrounded by thick strands of seaweed and cushioned and raised by a bed of the stuff. He is twenty feet below the surface, staring longingly at the open air.]</p><p>Look at the sky,<br/>
Isn’t it clear?<br/>
Wouldn’t you think that I’m happy here?<br/>
Now that I’m prince wouldn’t you think<br/>
I’ve got everything?<br/>
Deep in the sea<br/>
How can it be?<br/>
I’m now everything I wanted to be?<br/>
Special and rich wouldn’t you think,<br/>
Ron, he’s got everything</p><p>I’ve paid for my mistakes already,<br/>
I shouldn’t have to suffer anymore<br/>
I’ve trapped my family here with me,<br/>
Oh to be free, to stand tall on the shore – </p><p>I want to be where the wizards are<br/>
I want to cast<br/>
Wingardium Leviosa<br/>
Stir up a potion<br/>
And how I’d love to fly<br/>
Being stuck here with fins isn’t much fun<br/>
And so long without magic<br/>
Makes me want to<br/>
(hate to say it) cry.</p><p>Up where they charm,<br/>
Chart moon and sun,<br/>
Up where so much magic is done –<br/>
Wish I could be,<br/>
Careless and free,<br/>
Part of that world.</p><p>Why did I make<br/>
Such a mistake<br/>
Above the waters?<br/>
How long should I pay<br/>
For one awful day<br/>
That got out of hand?<br/>
When I was on land<br/>
I just wanted to save my father –<br/>
Trapped my mother<br/>
And my brothers<br/>
In a kingdom of sand. </p><p>I’m ready to go where the wizards go<br/>
Hold another wand<br/>
And make some magic –<br/>
Start a fire and hold it<br/>
Don’t let it burn!</p><p>When’s it my turn?<br/>
Wouldn’t I love<br/>
To walk once more up above?<br/>
Out of the sea,<br/>
Wish I could be<br/>
Part of that world.</p><p>[Ron is distraught and letting himself drift back to the seafloor. Arms wrapped around his torso, crying unseen tears that immediately are lost to the saltwater that makes up his world. Fred and George swim together out of the kelp where they have listened to their brother’s lament. They catch his arms and whisk him away to a bright grotto to cheer up their little brother by hatching a plot to help him find his way home.]</p><p>(to be continued)</p>
