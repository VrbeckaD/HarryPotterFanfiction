    <p>Rey suspired. Professor Binns had assigned them seven rolls of parchment on the witch burning in the fourteenth century and she hadn’t even managed to write one yet. She gazed at Finn, who eagerly scrawled word after world, only incidentally stopping to take a brief glance at his edition of ‘A History of Magic’. ”You know what, I’m done.”, she whispered, sounding fairly bugged out. Finn stopped writing, but he didn’t look up. ”You know you’ll have to write it eventually, right?” ”Yes.”, she muttered, ”See you in the common room!” She stuffed parchment and quill into her shoulder bag, and Finn watched her leave head-shaking, but with a smirk on his lips.</p>
<p>The big swing door of the library had quietly closed behind her, but instead of taking the stair on the left that would take her to the Gryffindor tower, Rey decided to take a stroll around the hallways. It was her third year at Hogwarts, but she still loved wandering around, discovering all of the enchanting places that were hidden all over the castle. She went down the stair to her right, and as it started to move she looked up and watched the staircase spin around her. This place was of a truly magical beauty. Rey went on and on climbing down stairs until she reached the bottom of the staircase, entering a narrow corridor that was lit by a single torch. As she turned around the corner, she was almost run over by two smaller boys. They were wearing Gryffindor uniforms, Rey remembered having bumped into them before. Harry and Ron were first years, and just as her, they seemed to have a thing for being found in places they weren’t supposed to be. “Hi!” She impishly smiled at them (both were obviously surprised to find another Gryffindor roving around down there) and continued her way into the darkness.</p>
<p>Blackly shadows were running over the walls of the hallway, constantly hustling with the glint of the torch. The warmth of the gloom somehow calmed her.</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>A sharp voice dragged her out of her thoughts, back into the reality. “Fuck.”, she muttered under her breath. Being caught wasn’t part of the plan. She turned around, expecting to find a teacher, or worse, Filch, to encumber her way back. Instead, Rey found herself opposite a tall, sable-haired boy. She recognized him; Kylo Ren was captain of his Quidditch team, straight-O-student, prefect, the pride of house Slytherin. And known for torturing younger students. As far as Rey was concerned, a giant prick.</p>
<p>“What are you doing down here?” He apparently tried to sound menacing. “None of your business, that’s what!”, Rey replied aggressively, intensely staring at him. For a moment, they were facing each other without a word. She noticed his deep brown eyes that didn’t fit the rest of his appearance. They almost looked soft, sad. Yet an imperious trait appeared on his face. “You will return to your filthy common room instantly or I’ll report you!” Rey had heard more effective threads before. She stared at him a little longer before she repelled snappishly: “I’ll do whatever I…”</p>
<p>When she saw his wand sliding into his hand, she was already petrified. His hand rose. Without a word he stepped closer, pointing his short, coal-black wand into her face. Rey wanted to shout, reach out to her wand - she could feel it pressing against her thigh in her pocket - but none of her muscles would obey. He was so close that Rey could feel his breath on her skin –</p>
<p>Suddenly the flickering crepuscule of the corridor turned into deep black. She fell. Deeper and deeper into the darkness, without a scream.</p>
<p>As abruptly as it had appeared, the blackness around her had yielded into a strangely familiar scenery. She was standing amidst a living room, dated and untidy. A man greedily drunk from a bottle, probably some booze, while a grubby looking woman seemed to be sleeping on the olive couch. Someone screamed - a child, a girl. Rey turned around, searching for the source of the crying. There, in the door. A woman, tight-coifed, in a grey tweet coat and skirt, was holding the hand of a little girl, maybe three or four years old. The girl’s face was covered in tears, she was howling, trying to break free from the woman’s tight grip. Rey couldn’t breathe. This was her, this were her parents, what…? Panic flew through her entire body. She turned back to the couple that didn’t take notice of the little girl. Why didn’t they do anything, why…? Another flash of horror stroke her body. Across the room, leaning almost bored against a shelf filled with empty bottles, Kylo Ren watched the scenery. “What are you…? What is this…?” Rey screamed in panic. “What..? Get out of my head! GET OU…”</p>
<p>Darkness. Again, she fell,  for an eternity.</p>
<p>This time, she found herself in the corner of a hall. The room was beautiful, the walls and the ceiling were covered in stucco embellishment, and torches casted warm beams of light on the oval wooden table amidst the room, which was crowded by bustling wizards and witches. Rey recognized Leia Organa, Minister of Magic, and to her right Amilyn Holdo, an Auror, both Gryffindor heroes. Again, the crying of a child dragged away her attention. A toddler boy was sitting in front of her, sobbing bitterly, in his hands a wooden toy hippogriff, with one wing broken off. But none of the adults took any notice. His sad brown eyes and sable curls strangely reminded her of someone. She looked up. The same eyes, the same sable curls. Kylo Ren intensely stared at her, in his eyes the same sadness, but also offense, and fury.</p>
<p>Darkness. Falling.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Rey opened her eyes. She was lying on the floor of the corridor, breathing heavily. Next to her feet, Kylo Ren was pressing his chest up from the floor, breathing equally heavily. His eyes were locked to hers. She tried to look away, tried to understand what had happened, but she couldn’t. The picture of her younger self had burned itself into her mind, and it ached. “You’re a monster!”, she pressed out, while putting herself up, “what the hell did you do?” He stared at her, without a word, confused, yet captivated and again with this innate sadness, that did something to Rey, whether she wanted or not. “You need a teacher.”, he mumbled. “You…”</p>
<p>“What’s going on here?” Another boy had appeared on the corner in front of them, red haired, with a prefect’s badge emblazoned on his Slytherin uniform. “Nothing. Fuck off, Hux!”, Kylo barked at him, still sitting on the floor, with Rey right next to him. Hux threw him a derogative peek, which then shifted to the Rey. His cold blue eyes rested on her as she rose. “Snape wants to see you, Ren!”, he stated dryly, without taking his eyes off her. Kylo finally got back on his feet. “I’m going, now fuck off!” His contempt against Hux was almost physically perceptible. Hux raised an eyebrow, but he left.</p>
<p>Kylo picked up his wand. “Go!” he said firmly, “He’s going to get Filch.” Rey wanted to say something, but the words inside her head just wouldn’t form a reasonable sentence. She didn’t want to take his orders, but she couldn’t think of what to do either. Without a word, she took her bag, turned around and walked away, towards the light of the staircase. Before she turned around the corner, she stopped, and slowly turned around. She presumed he had gone, but Kylo Ren was still standing in the same spot, watching her leave. With this damn sad look in his damn umber eyes.</p>
