    <p>Andromeda Epione Black was reminiscing as she lay on her death bed.  She had survived a lot in her sixty-three years. First her own insane family, then the Slytherin Politics of Hogwarts, being shunned from her own family, marriage, giving birth, and finally two wars.  She had survived longer than her cousins, her husband, her daughter, her sisters. She was the last of her generation.</p>
<p>
  <span>Her elder sister was killed in the last battle of the Second Blood War.  Her younger sister had wasted away after her husband was sentenced to prison for life.  There were many opinions about her sisters that the public had. Andromeda preferred to remember the early days, before any of them received their Hogwarts letters.  The young girls the Black sisters had been were very different from the women they had become. Bellatrix had been a loving, protective sister who had always taken the punishments meant for the younger girls.  Narcissa had been a sweet, inquisitive little girl who followed them around and always asked questions.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Wizarding World only knew of three daughters of the House of Black.  There had been seven of them at one point. It was less than a year to be honest.  Andromeda had been young. She had been nine when the eldest of the seven of them had been killed.  Rhea Druella Black turned eleven years old and never received a Hogwarts letter. Their Aunt Walburga had fought to have a ritual performed to gauge the magical strength of Rhea.  Rhea was found to have just less than enough magical strength to be accepted into Hogwarts. She was what Walburga classified as a hemiwitch.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Walburga then tested all the girls old enough for the ritual to not outright kill them.  Bellatrix and Andromeda had enough magic to be accepted into Hogwarts, to be considered ‘true witches.’  Their sister Azalea did not. Walburga had Rhea and Azalea killed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It changed them all.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When Narcissa and Nyx were tested when they were seven, less than a year later.  Nyx was dead before the moon had risen. A little over a year later, Tyche was put through the same ritual.  After Tyche’s death, their parents stopped trying for more children. They stopped trying for the heir their father always wanted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Andromeda never wanted to know how many of her own children Walburga had killed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As she closed her eyes, the dying woman wondered what their lives would have been like if the ritual had never been performed.  Or if their sisters had enough magic to satisfy the ancient ritual. Or if Walburga wasn’t a kin killing bitch.</span>
</p>

  <span>“Well that didn’t work out,” the youngest looking of the Fates, the maiden, groaned.  She stared at the very diminished Tapestry in front of Them.</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>“Really?” another of the Fates, the matron, sassed, holding a pair of shears.  She looked ready to cut the entire woven fabric.</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>“Where did We go wrong?” the last and oldest looking, the crone, wondered as they looked at the proposed plans for the Tapestry.</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>Many thought the Tapestry of Fate was created as events happened.  They were wrong. The Fates lived outside of the sway of Time. They planned the eras of the mortal world before letting mortals pluck at threads.  Oh there was Freewill. When in Their realm, the Fates could see the most likely route the mortals would take. However, the Fates had been weaving the Tapestry for eons.  They often could predict the results of the mortal’s Freewill. There were very few times where they felt it was needed to scrap a planned era due to the whims of mortals.</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>“Where did it go wrong?” the crone wondered again.</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>“Wizards,” the maiden snapped.</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>“Well, Magick would be the first to fall,” the matron pointed out.</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>All three peered at the small frame of time, less than a century, where those under Magick declined into nothing.</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>“So the question becomes: fix this or start fresh?” the crone asked her sisters.</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>The maiden looked to the matron but found her sister focused on the threads.  “I suppose We start over. I don’t see a point where we can prevent the loss of Magick and then the mortal realm itself.”</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>“What if We have Magick bless one,” the matron wondered.</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>“A Chosen?” the crone gasped.</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>“There hasn’t been a Chosen since mortal created various names for Us,” the maiden huffed.  “The Powers will never agree. Give me the shears.”</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>“Hold on,” the crone held her hand to the youngest, “there might be a way. There will still be loss but We can’t stop that World War.”</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>“If We go back a third of the way,” the matron pointed to various threads of shimmering black that were cut short.  “These four were cut short by mortal hands for being </span>
  <em>
    <span>less</span>
  </em>
  <span> by one mortal woman’s standards. Could We turn four to one?”</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>The maiden huffed as Her sisters started to unravel the Tapestry segment.  “There is no way Another would bless the mortal. Why look?”</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>“Why not?” the crone shrugged.  “We have the Time.” </span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>“Four strands is too strong,” the maiden huffed at her sisters after they prepared to run the era again.  “You would make a mortal too powerful for their skin.”</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>The other two stopped as they looked back at the Tapestry.  Groaning, the matron nodded. “She’s right.”</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>“So we leave the eldest alone,” the crone stated.  “Let them know the pain of losing a sister before her time. But be happy to have the rest survive.”</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>“Cruel,” the maiden grinned.</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>“No more than allowing Magick to die,” the matron shrugged.</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>“She’ll still need a blessing,” the crone stated.</span>
</p><hr/>
<p align="right"><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bellatrix Metis Black knew she would never forget the sight and sound of her big sister dying.  As the ten year old kept her younger sisters behind her. Andy, Cissa, and Nyx did not need to see as well as hear the eldest of them die.  Andy helped by keeping her hands over the twin’s eyes as Bella used her body to shield them.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Aunt Wal- No, </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> woman was no longer family.  Bellatrix refused to consider the woman family in her own mind.  Walburga Black was not kind in the act of ending Rhea’s life. In fact, it looked like the woman was taking </span>
  <em>
    <span>pleasure </span>
  </em>
  <span>in the pain she was causing.  The crazed woman stabbed Rhea several times, none of which were killing blows.  The first two times Rhea had kept silent; Bella suspected to help protect the six year old twins from hearing her death.  Now, on the eleventh wound, Rhea simply didn’t have enough control over herself to stay silent.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bella stared into the dimming charcoal gray eyes of her beloved elder sister.  She forced herself to watch as her best friend and confidant was killed before her own eyes by their own blood.  She would not let that woman hurt the rest of them. She would make </span>
  <em>
    <span>certain</span>
  </em>
  <span> Rhea knew she would protect the others.  No matter what, Bella promised her dying sister, the rest of them would survive and </span>
  <em>
    <span>end</span>
  </em>
  <span> the insanity that caused Rhea’s death.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As Rhea Druella Black took her final breath, the oath Bellatrix swore took hold.  In another world, the death of Azalea Nemesis Black mere hours after Rhea’s would break the young girl’s mind.  In this world, Azalea was never born, in order to ensure the survival of the youngest twin. Bellatrix felt the oath take hold of her and </span>
  <em>
    <span>knew</span>
  </em>
  <span> Magick would help her.  She had no proof, but the ten year old knew she, Andromeda, Narcissa and Nyx would survive this.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Now, let us test the others,” Walburga grinned.  Bellatrix stood tall as she stepped into the circle.  She would </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> show this woman weakness.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Less than a year later, the twins were tested in the same ritual room where their eldest sister died.  Both were found to be ‘true Blacks.’ As the blood of the twin girls fell on the circle, Bellatrix renewed her oath.  The insanity that was the prejudice that ended Rhea’s life simply for being a ‘lesser witch’ would end. Unknown at the time, Andromeda Epione swore a similar vow as her sister.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Across the room, Narcissa and Nyx silently promised each other that </span>
  <em>
    <span>every single adult</span>
  </em>
  <span> that simply stood back and let this ritual take place would pay.  They would show them what the true might of Black was.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="right">
  <span>And as all four took their oaths, Magick blessed them all.  While She had only been asked by the Fates to bless the youngest, who they had combined three lives to create, She knew her domain well enough to know a Blessing such as this was better shared.  The Fates may have Seen Her survival when only one was Blessed, but Magick did enjoy throwing them a ‘curve ball’ as the mortals called it.</span>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <span>As the ritual ended and the mortal kin-killer left, Magick bound the four sisters in the strongest bond She knew.  It had been eons since the last Blessed Coven had been formed. And though there was no going back, Magick could not regret changing the Tapestry the way She did.  Even if it turned on Her, Magick would never regret Blessing a group instead of a singular mortal.</span>
