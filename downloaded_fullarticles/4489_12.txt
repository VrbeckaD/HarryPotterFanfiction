          <div class="userstuff"><p>The decorations were hung with care and the stockings were hung along the fireplace awaiting Saint Nick's arrival. There were lights strung along the pathway of the cottage lining the way for the his arrival. The Christmas tree was covered from top to bottom with tinsel and there was a plate of cookies laid out especially for the man in red.</p>
<p>It had only taken them five hours, but Draco and Astoria had finally finished decorating their cottage for the Christmas. The only downfall to the entire thing was that it was Christmas Eve and their family would be here bright and early the next morning.</p>
<p>"That took way longer than it should have," Draco said, collapsing into bed after a long shower.</p>
<p>"Yes, but everything looks perfect!" Astoria cheered as she climbed in underneath the blankets beside him.</p>
<p>"You look perfect," he cooed, wrapping an arm around her waist and rolling her towards him as he began to place gentle kisses along her neck and collarbone.</p>
<p>"Not tonight," she scolded, pushing him away slightly, laughing quietly at the whimper she heard escape his lips. "The quicker we fall asleep, the quicker we will wake up and be able to find all of the presents that Santa left for us under the tree."</p>
<p>"Really, Tori?" Draco sighed, rolling from his side to his back and allowing his arm to hang off the side of the bed as he slammed his head against the pillow. "You are worried about the presents that Santa is going to leave for us? We're almost thirty…"</p>
<p>"Age is just a number, Draco. Now get some sleep," she replied, leaning over to turn the light off before placing a soft kiss on his cheek and then pulled the blanket up around her chest. "I love you."</p>
<p>"You, too," Draco huffed, slumping onto his side and turning off his own light before curling up into a tight little ball as he was whisked off to dreamland.</p>
<p align="center">. . . . . . . .</p>
<p>Draco was roused from his slumber to find a very excited Astoria practically jumping up and down on the other side of the bed as she shook his shoulder frantically in an attempt to wake him. Glaring at her as he yawned, Draco slowly pushed himself up into a seated position as he searched aimlessly for the clock with his right hand and scrubbed his face with his left.</p>
<p>"What time is it?" he moaned groggily, picking up the clock once he had found it and turned to look at it. He had to do a double take when he read what the clock said. <em>4:30 am</em>. <em>4:30 in the freaking morning</em>. "Tori… do you realize what time it is?"</p>
<p>"It's Christmas time!" she replied happily, leaning over to cover his cheek with kisses. "Merry Christmas, darling."</p>
<p>"No, no, no. It's 4:30 in the morning," he said, placing the clock back down on the night stand. "Do you know what I'm supposed to be doing at 4:3o in the morning?"</p>
<p>The only response he was met with was a fit of giggling, causing him to shake his head. The smile on her face was beaming brighter than he had ever seen. Christmas really was her favorite holiday. Shaking his head, he leaned over and kissed her softly on the lips.</p>
<p>"Merry Christmas, love," he mumbled into her lips.</p>
<p>"Come on then, let's go find out what we got from Santa Claus!" she cheered, pulling his arm to get him out of bed. "I've got hot cocoa simmering in the kitchen."</p>
<p>"Well if there's hot cocoa, I guess I can get out of bed," he replied with a laugh.</p></div>
