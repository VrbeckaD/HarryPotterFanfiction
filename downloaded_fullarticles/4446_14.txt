    <p>“I’ll be fine mom. It’s not that dangerous.” You laugh, slinging your backpack over your shoulders. She gives you a tight hug before smiling a sad smile then stepping away. <br/>“Send me an owl okay? Every day.”<br/>“Mom.” You laugh and shake your head at her. She smiles back again then you throw a handful of floo powder into the fireplace. “Diagon Alley.” You say clearly then step into the green flames. When you step out of the flames you’re surprised by the silence. You are in the right place right? You glance around and see wanted posters, boarded up shops and there’s a chill in the air. You’d been here before, once before your dad died he’d brought you to Ollivander’s to get your wand. Claimed there was no better place in all the wizarding world. It had been a busy and bustling place, full of life, but not now. Now it was, grey, dark and cold. <br/>A loud squawking alarm is going off. Possibly because of you, since it had been silent until you stepped out of the fireplace. Sure enough three men in all black appear out of nowhere. They’re wearing masks that look like half skulls. You’re suddenly filled with dread, there’s nowhere you can go. You’re too far from the states and you don’t know anywhere in England. <br/>“You’re out past curfew.” One of the men says. <br/>“I’m sorry. I didn’t know there was one.”<br/>You tell him honestly. <br/>“American.” He sneers, he stalks toward you and you destroy the fireplace you’d just walked through. “How dare you!” He growls and you pull your wand from where it’s been tucked into your sleeve. <br/>“Stupify!” One of the hooded men cries and you easily block the spell. <br/>“Crucio!” The man who’s been doing the talking takes his turn. <br/>“Seriously?” You cry, “An unforgivable curse? I haven’t even done anything!” It is helpful that they seem to have to speak to cast a spell. You stun the man that tried to stun you then turn your attention back to the first man. You use a body bind curse then accio their wands to you. The third man hasn’t done anything. But you can feel his eyes on you, even if you can’t see them. <br/>“Do something Draco!” The one on the ground snaps. You get ready for his attack but are confused when he disapparates. He appears behind you a second later and you don’t know what to do when he grips your arm before disapparating again. This time with you in tow.</p>
