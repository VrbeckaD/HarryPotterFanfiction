    <p>Forests are queer places at night. Filtering moonlight shivers sullenly among the leaves. Water drips with pointed noise from some hidden source. Creatures of indeterminate size form fleetingly before melting into shadow. Eye-lanterns gleam questioningly before shuttering in disinterest.</p><p> </p><p>An intruder would feel themselves simultaneously closely watched and utterly isolated.</p><p> </p><p>Like the only living thing in existence.</p><p> </p><p>Like the only living thing, but a thing imprisoned in a glass test-tube. The scientists whose experiment you are may be absent, yet their desire to turn you inside out and find what you’re made of remains.</p><p> </p><p>The fae that live in ancient forests such as this are not scientists. Not in the strict human sense of the word. But they are curious. Deadly curious. About anything or anyone which they do not understand.<br/><br/></p><p>Two children were lost in one of these forests in the same year. One escaped whole, never meeting its inhabitants, the other was lost forever. This is their story.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Forests are queer places at night. And you, oh human wanderer, you are the queerest thing they’ve seen.</em>
