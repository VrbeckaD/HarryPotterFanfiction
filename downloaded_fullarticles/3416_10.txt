    <p> </p>
<p>There had been days that Harry absolutely hated. This turned out to be one of those days; October 31st, the day throughout the entire year that never failed to cause him the most grief. All of the students had been moved from their respected dorms into the Great Hall, with the insane escaped murder Sirius Black, having roaming inside. Nowhere had been particularly safe. The teachers were doing their rounds inspecting the castle and left no one other than Filch to look after the students and his cat, Mrs. Norris; that the entire student body despised. With good reason. The cat had been insufferable chasing after students and getting up in their business.</p>
<p>However, that had been neither here nor there. Given the amount of eyes that burned at the back of his head. He had felt them for awhile and sat quietly knowing that the tension would break. Ron and Hermione were beside him and grimaced. Harry knew that they were aware of the stares and had their wands at the ready, preparing for the worst case scenario. His own wand never left his sleeve.</p>
<p>"This is your entire fault Potter!" A girl, from his year, wearing a yellow and black badge upon her breast. Unfazed that it had been a Hufflepuff which shifted the blame upon his shoulders.</p>
<p>Harry steadily raised an eyebrow. "And pray tell how is this exactly my fault?"</p>
<p>"That we're all stuck here in the Great Hall!" This time a Ravenclaw, whom came to back up the Hufflepuff. "instead of in our dorms!"</p>
<p>Their names escaped him. Probably because he didn't know, or cared even less so of the accusations from the so-called House of Loyalty and the House of Knowledge; and watched in anticipating as many more Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws started to bubble up their support. There had been one little Ravenclaw that entered his line of sight that staring at the rest in disappointment and shook her blonde locks as her blue eyes glazed over. It took less than a second for the Hufflepuffs to appear in droves. Loyalty to each other but never loyal to anyone else; a complete hive mind. That had been the true way of Hufflepuff House.</p>
<p>"How is that even remotely my fault?" Harry retorted. "If it's anyone's fault. It's Sirius's Black's fault for breaking into Hogwarts. I'm not sure how he managed to do so with all these Dementors around." No way was he going to slip up and reveal that it had been Neville's fault. The fact his fellow Gryffindor dropped the parchment paper with the passwords. The timid Gryffindor had already suffered enough. "Instead of trying to pin the blame on someone, placing it on the murder."</p>
<p>A snort came from the crowd.</p>
<p>"Yeah right Potter." Seamus' voice broke through, frowning darkly. "We all know that Black's come for you. And you only!"</p>
<p>"We don't know that." Hermione spoke softly, deadly even. Her eyes flashed with a quiet gleam that promise pain and revealed her fingers dangling the wand in full view showing how serious she truly had been.</p>
<p>Ron's grimace spoke of all that needed without words watching the students warily.</p>
<p>"Oh come off it!" Malfoy sneered. "We both know that you and Granger would love nothing more than to get rid of Potter. Why keep him around when there's a murder on the loose? Better for us to live and let Black have the one he's after."</p>
<p>Hermione threw a glare. "That's just like a Malfoy to say. Unlike you, we're actually friends. We'd never throw Harry to wolves!"</p>
<p>"Malfoy has a point though." The Hufflepuff from earlier stated. "If we get rid of Potter, then he'd leave us alone. I say we give Black who he wants."</p>
<p>Harry narrowed his eyes at the threat. It had been sad to know that many of the faces in the crowd reflected that way of thinking even among the Gryffindors. Not that he counted on them taking his side, they never did. They turned on him, Ron and Hermione whenever necessary without fail early as fast as the rest of the houses. It appeared that his instincts were correct as always.</p>
<p>"You can't take on all of us Potter." Another Hufflepuff sneered and whipped out their wand. "Now cooperate with us willingly and I'm sure we'll be gentle."</p>
<p>'<em>Gentle</em>.' Harry thought in disbelief. "Forgive me for saying hell no."</p>
<p>"Fine then." Ravenclaw stepped up this time. "Stupefy!"</p>
<p>Harry managed to dodge out of the way with Hermione and Ron reacting quickly to the attack and flinging their own spells back at the Ravenclaw, knocking him out. Then skid to safety as the Hufflepuff collective immediately jumped into the fry firing their own spells. The Slytherin's merely sat back and watched with glee on their faces, but none more so than Malfoy, gripping his own wand with a look of deviousness and stepped forward to join in the attack against the Golden trio. Beginning to conjurer a spell glowing dark purple and shot towards Hermione. At the time she had been busy fending off a few of the Ravenclaw students that were busy helping their fallen comrade. Ron struggled against the Hufflepuff's using his brute strength to toss them aside with Harry backing him up when able.</p>
<p>The two had not realized that the spell had been hurtled towards Hermione until it had nearly been too late. Horror eclipsed their faces looking on as the spell came closer and closer to hitting Hermione, being pushed in front of the spell by a sadistic smiling Ravenclaw knowing fully what they done.</p>
<p>"Hermione!" Ron and Harry were horrified witnessing the spell tossing her to the side and slide across the floor as her head knocked against the wall and fell unconscious. The two had zero time to notice the crowd around them approaching, wands drawn and pointed at three with a vigilant force not to be meddled with. To his utter disappointment among the Gryffindors, several faces he recognized immediately; the majority had been from his year and up with the younger ones looking torn of what to do deciding to look away; unable to blame them. They were children being pulled into a fight against their will, for that Harry could forgive. It had been the older students that were the problem, the poison of Hogwarts that swept into halls and students. Turning their backs whenever something went array and shoved the blame onto another rather than responsibility.</p>
<p>It had been childish beyond belief and yet never failed.</p>
<p>"S-stop that!" Neville stuttered out, attempting to push through the masses, with that blonde Ravenclaw seen earlier stepping with him brandishing their own wands circling around Ron and Hermione as they aided in protecting their fallen friend from the masses. "H-Harry didn't go anything wrong. H-he never asked to be the target of a killer."</p>
<p>The blonde girl with the dreamy expression nodded. "Harry is an innocent in all of this. It must be the nargles that have affected you all. I'm sad to see that none of you protected yourself from them."</p>
<p>"Shut up Lovegood!" A girl, a Ravenclaw for certain, scowled openly. "No one cares about your freak imaginary creatures!"</p>
<p>Parkinson snorted. "And since when were you friends with Potter, Loony? I thought you'd be too busy hiding in the corner and playing make belief!"</p>
<p>"I bet she must have gotten '<em>help</em>' from Potter on occasion!" Malfoy jeered, snobbish with a crude smirk on his face.</p>
<p>Lovegood titled her head absently. "No. I can tell his heart is pure. Purer than any of yours, and that saddens me most of all. Perhaps that's what the <em>she </em>meant." Shaking her head in dismay with an elegant sadness to her that Harry could not explain, feeling touched that she would help him without knowing him. Though her words were puzzling for now he could not question the aid. Her fingers wrapped around her wand gentle holding it before them with a vacant stare.</p>
<p>"You two…." His voice trailed off, swallowing and shaking his head. "Thank you."</p>
<p>Just as those words left his mouth a streak of red flashed from his eyes and soared far past the two, hitting Ron's side and watched as his friend blanked on toppling straight onto the floor. His arm threw upwards retaliating using any spell Harry could think of. Uncaring at the whom came to harm. The desire to avenge his two fallen friends blinded him from everything else, spell after spell shot at the students each more powerful than the last ignoring the horrific cries of the students. Each flying against the walls and in the air before crashing onto the ground. His emerald eyes seethed with anger clutching his teeth with Lovegood and Neville helping when able. The crowd's anxiety heightened to fear before turning to anger when realizing that they had the advantage and sough to exploit their numbers and took out the other two, being knocked out by stunner spells.</p>
<p>It simply added to the burning sensation flowing through his body unwilling to compromise and yield to the assailants as they scooted closer with savage smiles resting upon their faces. Harry knew, just as they did, the winner had been decided.</p>
<p>He had lost.</p>
<p>"Now then Potter." The Leader of the Hufflepuffs sneered as she smiled wickedly. "Going to finally give this show a rest? You're out numbered and out powered, your little friends are knocked out and can't do anything. So how about you leave nice and quietly, hmm? That way no harm will come to you."</p>
<p>The Slytherin Leader; Malfoy grinned sadistically. "Why stop? We might as well have a little fun. Potter's been causing trouble since he came here. It's his fault we've all suffered."</p>
<p>"Quite true, Malfoy." The Ravenclaw leader, Roger Davis nodded. "However, I think getting him outside post haste will keep the rest of us safe."</p>
<p>"Just do it quick." The Gryffindor Leader prompted; unable to see the face but the voice rang familiar to him but given the situation Harry could not place the voice to a face.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes started to search the crowd looking for even an inkling of help scanning across the Gryffindor section and saw the smug look that Seamus wore and the utter shame that appeared on Dean's. Pavarti and Lavender appeared torn between helping and crying choosing to force themselves to look away hiding themselves among the Gryffindos. His Quidditch mates did not even bother to help. Oliver Wood looked enraged with a red ridden face. Ginny could not even be seen nor could the twins. As the three chasers; Angelina, Katie and Alicia were standing with Lee Jordan all appearing uncertain at what to do and simply stared remaining in place with Percy glancing back and forth from the Ravenclaws and back to him.</p>
<p>It did not take very long to guess their choice. Once again the so-called house of the brave had abandoned him leaving him out to try. Alone once more.</p>
<p>"I'll leave."</p>
<p>The words said quietly. His pride had been beaten down and defeated, with good reason, there had been no way knowing what might have happened to his four friends if things had the battle ensured their safety.</p>
<p>"As long as Ron, Hermione, Neville and Lovegood aren't harmed." Harry added, and swallowed. "I'll leave now, quietly too."</p>
<p>"Then what are you waiting for?" Bones held up her wand. "Go already."</p>
<p>The jeers from the rest of the students goaded him into gathering his bag; containing his dad's invisibility cloak and the photo album. It had been the very few things that he held dear to him. Materialistic wise, approaching the front gate out of the Great Hall ignoring the lingering lethal stares from the students. He paused with his stride glancing to his unconscious friends, and curled his hands into fists feeling the powerlessness that came over him. Hating how things ended and hated the fact that this were how things came to be. Unable to do anything to help without pulling them into even further trouble. The very least he could do was protect them in his own way.</p>
<p>Hopefully someday Harry would be able to gain their forgiveness.</p>
<p>For now. This is all really what Harry could do proceeding through the Halls making his way out of Hogwarts Castle for the final time and he stepped into the night glancing back at the majestic building behind him.</p>
<p>Just him and his bag. Hedwig would more than likely end up following all on her own, she had been an intelligent owl always knowing where he'd be.</p>
<p>Walking under the pale moonlight shining above him smothered in the darkness of the night, his arms wrapped around himself feeling the tingling of cold air pressing against his body flying through the fabric of his sweater. It had been stupid of him to not have retrieved a warmer jacket. Lucky enough, snow had yet to fall.</p>
<p>The chances of the teachers finding out immediately were less than likely. Given the resourcefulness of the Ravenclaw's and the cunning nature of the Slytherin's they'd be able to contrive a story to keep the mob's actions a secret; censoring and bullying his four friends into complete silence to prevent the truth from reaching ear. Not that any of the staff would be bothered to investigate his disappearance until it had been too late. McGonagall already established her uselessness during the first and second year dismissing the claims from Ron and Hermione, barely coming to their aid until everything had been said and done. It had been no wonder that no one in Gryffindor bothered to go to her for help. Snape's abusive attitude had been proof enough. Any complains against him were dropped or vanished or so the rumors said. Snape would more than likely use the situation to make a show and blame him for the outcome.</p>
<p>Sprout and Filtwick more than likely wouldn't really care either. The only person Harry knew that did care is Hagrid, at least the staff might have been pleased with the unity shown today. He snorted quietly to himself.</p>
<p>The backstabbers the whole lot of them.</p>
<p>In the end there that had been that. There were no chances to going back and now needed to choose a path for himself, going back to the Dursleys were completely out of the question. Asking for lodging with Tom at the Leaky Cauldron seemed to be the best idea until figuring out where to go. Maybe there would be another school that would accept him?</p>
<p>Harry regretted never brushing up on his history outside of Britain. It finally began to bite him in the ass, with Binns as a History Professor droning on and on with the Goblin wars made it increasingly difficult to care. Given how many people fell to asleep the moment the ghost's mouth opened during lectures said a lot. The only useful piece of information they ever gain had been back during second year retelling the tale between the four founders and the chamber of secrets, and the event which caused Salazar Slytherin to turn away from the school after the disagreement with the other three leaving the basilisk dwelling deeply beneath the school. Only for Slytherin's heir, Tom Marvolo Riddle AKA Lord Voldemort, to use the basilisk to attack students; paralyzing and committing murder to cleanse the school of muggle-borns, only to be stopped by Harry in the end.</p>
<p>A part of him wondered what Slytherin would have thought about that.</p>
<p>Not that Harry could even ask. Considering how far deep and under his corpse currently was; if there even was one.</p>
<p>
  <em>Crack.</em>
</p>
<p>His body stiffed. The sound of a branch snapping rang through his ears audibly, gulping quietly to himself and slipped his wand from his sleeve, tightening his hold. He did not dare turn. Not now.</p>
<p>Each second passed with the shadow growing closer, and closer. Focusing on the subtle noise that came from the frosted grass, crunched beneath the shoes.</p>
<p><em>Careful. </em>Harry thought quietly, breathing in tandem with his thoughts. <em>Focus.</em></p>
<p>The sounds stopped. Seeing the shadows reflecting in the looming light of the moon reach towards him shooting his wand arm up straight at the person. Emerald pools widened staring in horror. Revealing a haunted looking man with long black hair that stretched far past his neck and shoulders curling at the ends with a pale white complex that had seen far better days. Lacking any substance of sunlight and the grey eyes which held a small spark of life staring. The clothes that donned his body were torn and damper, grimy too. Looking closely know seeing the bones from his wrist and arms realizing just how skinny this man had been. Feeling a wave of empathy passed through him, knowing how horrible starvation could be, and have suffered first hand. That wave of empathy vanished upon realization of the man that stood before him relapsing from empathy straight into wariness and into fear.</p>
<p>The mass murder, Sirius Black. The intruder that slashed at the Fat Lady… to get to him.</p>
<p>"It's you," Harry swallowed, still holding the wand tightly. "Sirius Black."</p>
<p>Black made no movement. And then, gave a slow nod. "Yes," He answered. "It's me, Harry."</p>
<p>"So. Come to finish me off have you?"</p>
<p>At that moment a startled look appeared on the man's face replaced quickly with repulsive and disgust. "Why in Merlin's name would I want to kill you?" Black sounded incredulous and shocked. "And more important, what the bloody hell are you even doing outside? It's cold for heaven's sake! You should be inside where it's warm with the other students."</p>
<p>"You'd like that wouldn't you," Harry began, gritting his teeth. "Getting not only me but the rest of the student body at the same time. So sorry that you're out of luck. It's just me."</p>
<p>Black's confusion grew larger. "No, seriously. What the bloody hell is going on here? Why do you think I want to kill you?"</p>
<p>"Stop with the façade. It's getting quite tiresome." Harry snarled with narrowed emerald eyes, flashing. Maybe he could stall for time?</p>
<p>"Harry." Black's tone became gentle and soft, kneeling down to his level. "I swear to my magic, and my life. That the very last thing on my mind is to ever lay a hand to harm you, I would never to do that. Lily and James would never forgive me for even thinking of harming you."</p>
<p>The very first instinct would have been to scoff right then, and there. Harry had learned at an early age that adults were powerless to help, some tried and failed and others simply did not care. That had been why Harry trusted in himself and his own abilities to survive. When meeting the soft shimmering pools of grey, a sense of warmth started to appear seeing the genuine sincerity that came from Black; the man meant every word. At the darkest part of his mind a nagging feeling nudge against the side of his brain prompting him to drop his bag and pull out his photo album, flipping through the pages until Harry came across a very handsome man with short black hair with the same grey eyes as Black.</p>
<p>Alarm bells instantly went off in his head glancing up at the wistful smile that rested upon Black's face. The dots connected instantly.</p>
<p>"You…." Harry started, and yet unable to finish the sentence.</p>
<p>Black gave a slight laugh. "I was your dad's best man at his wedding. We were practically brothers; James and I. I owe your father not just my friendship but my brotherhood and life. He saved me when I was unable to save myself, for that I could never repay him." A nostalgic look crossed his face before his hands curled and became frustrated. "And because of my stupidity, it lead them to their deaths."</p>
<p>"Wait what?" Now it had been Harry's turn to be confused.</p>
<p>"Originally when your parents went into hiding, James and Lily named me as their Secret Keeper. The person that kept them safe from harms way." Black answered and swallowed, the grey eyes were grim with memories of old. "At first I had been honored by their trust. It didn't last long. I figured that my closeness with James would reveal my status as their Secret Keeper. It was as obvious as daylight. That's why I asked them to change the Secret Keeper from myself to Peter Pettigrew," A snarl escaped his lips. "None of us realized it but that little rat turned out to be the traitor. That rat had no problem selling them and you out. James set up an alarm to my watch if anything happened, by the time I arrived it had been far too late…"</p>
<p>His hand buried into his face as droplets of water began to slide down his face onto the ground revealing the look of sadness mixed with frustration and self-loathing. The gears inside of Harry's head were going into overtime listening to the story being shared. At first doubting the truth of his tale; with the way Black looked, there were no way the things he shared had been false. No one had been that good of an actor to fake such a reaction.</p>
<p>"You said that Pettigrew was the traitor," Harry said choosing his words slowly piecing together the story carefully. "But didn't you blow him up all those years ago? Laughing?"</p>
<p>Black shook his head, and swallowed. "No. I never got the chance, he hide his wand in his hand and used a type of dark arts to do so. Only dark magic could have that level of magnitude in a small area. Then transfigured himself into his animagus form and seeped into the sewer."</p>
<p>"Wait animagus form?" Harry's eyes knitted together.</p>
<p>"The ability to transform into an animal," Black informed with a faint smile and chuckle as they glowed bemused. "I believe you've must have seen McGonagall turn into her's-"</p>
<p>"A tabby cat!" Harry realized, and flushed a bit at his own outburst.</p>
<p>"That's right. We magic folk can only transfigure ourselves into one form only depending on our personalities and characteristics," Black continued. "Your father was a Stag; Protection and faithful. Mine is a dog which is a symbol for-"</p>
<p>"Loyalty and friendship," Harry interrupted. "A bit cheesy."</p>
<p>Black shrugged. "Maybe. But it works. And Pettigrew's animagus form was a rat."</p>
<p>"A rat." Harry seemed non-plussed by the revelation, yet curious as to why. "Cowardice."</p>
<p>"When I was in Azkaban Prison I received a news paper from or <em>lovely</em> Minister Fudge. So graciously he tossed over a ragged newspaper that happened to be with him at the time," Black rolled his eyes slightly. "I asked for it. Said I missed the crosswords, but I was starving for information on the outside and what happened to you. That's when I saw it on the front page. That rat with the Weasley's. With a missing finger."</p>
<p>Harry felt trepidation run up in his spine finally understanding. "Ron's pet rat-"</p>
<p>"Twelve years from what I've heard and has the exact same missing finger." Black stated, grimly. "A rat, even a magical one at least can't live for twelve years. They simply don't have the body to do so. But do you know what does?"</p>
<p>"Humans." The teen swallowed thickly. "Then all this time I've been sharing a room with a Voldemort supporter and traitor."</p>
<p>"If I wanted to kill you then why would I bother going over to the Weasley boy's bed rather than yours?" Black pointed out. "In the long run it wouldn't make any sense. When Peter learned of my escape he must have realized that I knew he was alive and came after him. If I know him well enough, Wormtail probably had been waiting for the right time to take you to Voldemort or to one of his inner circles. Malfoy would be the most likely candidate."</p>
<p>"Wormtail?" Harry asked, warily.</p>
<p>"Nickname. All four of us had one went around calling ourselves the marauders; James was called Prongs, I was Padfoot, Pettigrew was Wormtail and Remus was Moony." Black said, with a sheepish grin.</p>
<p>"Remus? As in… Professor Lupin?" Harry inquired, feeling stupid for asking such an obvious question.</p>
<p>Black nodded. "That's him. I must admit I am surprised to see him back at Hogwarts given the circumstances and such, then again maybe I shouldn't be…." His voice trailed off a bit shaking his head. "That aside why are you here outside? You never answered me."</p>
<p>"Your little scare had a negative effect." Harry answered, blandly with a pointed stare. "The rest of the student body ganged up against me and threw me out. Ron, Hermione, Neville and a Ravenclaw girl called Lovegood tried to stand up for me but the numbers were stacked against our favor. I… I decided to leave. I had to protect them from further ridicule from the rest of the students; better me to suffer than them. I can handle it."</p>
<p>Black's face had been grim at his words as a flicker of anger flared behind his eyes seething violently until it simmered down after a quiet murmur. "That isn't right," he growled. "Where were the teachers when this happened?"</p>
<p>"Looking for you," Harry stated.</p>
<p>"Right." Black responded, sighing. "Of course, they'd take the advantage with a lack of a professor when none of them were there and blame it on something else. Typical; good thing to know that nothing's changed at all. Well," he tossed a look. "What do you plan on doing? Waiting for a professor?"</p>
<p>"I thought about heading to Hogsmeade then taking floo powder to the Leaky Cauldron then finding another school." Harry admitted, truthfully wondering why he bothered telling him. "Trying to return is asking for problems and brings risks that I'd rather not take. The best solution is going somewhere else. That way I know that my friends would be safe." Maybe he might have been a bit too idealistic in his thinking but what other course of action could he take? It seemed to be the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>Black stroked his chin thoughtfully. "That is a sound possibility," He agreed. "Have you thought of where to go?"</p>
<p>"That…." His voice trailed off shaking his head. "I haven't figured out yet. I don't know where to even begin looking. And why do you even care? Shouldn't you be on the run?" Actually, that had been another thing that bothered him. If Black had been entirely innocent of the incidents then why he had been sent to jail?</p>
<p>"You are more important, Harry." Black told him, softly. "I don't care what happens to me. I'd rather see you safe."</p>
<p>The teen's eyes focused on him. "Why do you care so much?"</p>
<p>"Because I'm your godfather," Black answered.</p>
<p>"My… what?"</p>
<p>"Your godfather. Your parents named me your guardian encase anything happened to them," Black repeated, before grinning bitterly. "And look what I've done. You were taken away from me before I got the chance to take you to safety and then I was imprisoned without a trial, left to rot for twelve long years. I'm failure as a guardian."</p>
<p>Damn it. Was Black starting to get sentimental? Harry was no good at things like that. The information dump received from Black had been far too much for his mind to process and attempting to provide comfort; and while wariness remained. Too many things were beginning to line up and make sense for him to dispute the man's words. With the way the man looked, caused him to sigh.</p>
<p>"Listen." Harry began, slowly. "There's nothing that we can do, right? Beating yourself up over something that had been beyond your control is stupid. If what you said is true then mum and dad wouldn't have wanted you to feel this way."</p>
<p>The abnormality of Scabber's life and Black's revelation of the rat's true identity did seem to line up. The rat had a missing finger, and lived with the Weasley's for over twelve. Even Ron mention at how strange that had been. With the testimony from the older man, things were finally beginning to connect. Scabber's strange behavior also started up around the time of Black's escape and Black had been on the hunt for Pettigrew whom took the form of Scabbers...</p>
<p>Harry could not deny the connection.</p>
<p>"I still lead them to their inevitable deaths," Black disagreed, shaking his head firmly.</p>
<p>He sent him a slight glare. "You didn't know. No one suspected Pettigrew right? Not even you did. So there's no reason for you to be blaming yourself for that. If there is anyone you should have been blaming it's Pettigrew and Voldemort for deceiving everyone and... the death of parents. Sitting here and wallowing in your own self-pity isn't going to solve anything."</p>
<p>Black blinked flabbergasted by his words staring openly until his expression calmed and curled into a quiet smile. "... You're right. Feeling sorry for myself isn't the way to do things, I've always prided myself as a man of action." He stated. "What would your parents think of me for wallowing when I have a godson to look after?"</p>
<p>"They'd probably return from the dead and kick your ass." Harry answered, bluntly.</p>
<p>"Probably." Black nodded, grimly. "You're mother always had a nasty right hook."</p>
<p>His brow arched slightly with interest and then pushed the thought to the side. "So. Where do we go from here?"</p>
<p>"Stopping by Gringotts would be the safest bet. From there you'd be able to transfer the money used for this year and the rest of your Hogwarts education to be placed back into your main vault while you look through different schools to attend. Since I'm your guardian, even if I am on the run, I should be able to provide some aid in your transfer. The goblin's don't particularly care for the internal works of us wizard folk. So going in and out wouldn't be too hard; considering it's neutral territory for all." Black mused stroking his chin. "You'd want to avoid Drumstrang. It's a school filled with Dark Arts and with Voldemort sympathizers."</p>
<p>"Right. No Drumstrang then." Avoiding any Voldemort followers was at the top of his <em>'to do list'</em>. "What did you mean by main vault?"</p>
<p>Black gave him a deadpanned stare. "You don't actually believe that the vault you have access is the main Potter Vault do you? Harry, you're thirteen. No adult is going to give you full access to the Potter Family Fortune. No one is that irresponsible. You won't even able to access it until you are at least sixteen or seventeen years. I couldn't access mine until then too. My parents couldn't touch it after they disowned me since I already had been considering an adult in the goblin's eyes."</p>
<p>"Right." Harry could not argue with that. "So… Gringotts then?"</p>
<p>"Wait hold on," Black paused for the moment concentrating on something as his body began to shift before him. Changing the appearance from an older man into a shaggy black dog sitting before him with an adorable expression.</p>
<p>It had been the exact same dog Harry had seen momentarily before the Knight Bus had arrived. His stare lingered and shook his head, smiling despite himself and the motioned him to follow.</p>
<p>"C'mon Snuffles," Harry began ignoring the whine from Black, smirked. "We've got a long day ahead of us."</p>
<p>Every plan need to start somewhere no matter how insane it might have been. With his godfather together they sent off straight to Hogsmeade not knowing what the night might hold for them. Heading deep into the dark of the night striding towards the town whimsically ignoring the massive groups of wizards and witches that they came across; each partying in their own fashion, the celebration of Voldemort's downfall, a time where the entire wizarding community partied in utter glee. Oblivious to Harry's presence, too busy indulging in their own laughter and fun to notice. The aroma of alcohol resided on their breaths and caused him to cringe, recalling Marge's visit prior to the beginning of the year. The smell brought about unpleasant memories.</p>
<p>Black seemed to sense his distress and whining before nuzzling affectionately. It made Harry felt self-cautious yet appreciated the thought. It had been comforting to know that someone else understood him. Halloween always had been hard. Upon discovering the truth of his parent's deaths, the way people celebrated without a care in the world, unaware of the sadness he felt.</p>
<p>His feelings did not matter. Not at the Dursleys, and not at Hogwarts. Usually Harry went with Hermione into the library hiding from the jeers from students and staff alike, using the time to find the location of his parents grave.</p>
<p>Apparently no one knew where it was. Or rather, the location had been hidden and sealed. Not even Madam Pince knew the location, McGonagall dismissed him entirely and sent him on his way. Filtwick and Sprout avoided answering him. When attempting to ask Hagrid one of the professors would end up revealing themselves from behind the corner and dragging him off somewhere. It seemed almost like a strange conspiracy of sorts.</p>
<p>But that sounded absurd. Why would anyone go out of their way to hide their graves? Was it a magic thing?</p>
<p>Three Broomsticks had been up ahead and pushed the thought away. Slipping inside had been easy, the place had been packed and no one seemed even remotely interested in anything other than drinking, partying and conversing. Drunken people from right to left all across that his eyes could see. Even the waitress, Rosemerta had been far too busy serving customer after customer sweating with the amount of patrons inside. Scanning the room landing upon the Floo Powder, Harry managed to charm one of the other workers into allowing him some for use, and a chimney upon the upper floor. None of them even realized his identity. His good luck managing to pull through.</p>
<p>Climbing up the stairs quietly with Black following behind him they slipped into the nearest empty room, and entered straight into the chimney. His previous experience had not left much of an impression on him.</p>
<p>"Here we go." Harry murmured, and gripped the powder. "Diagon Ally!"</p>
<p>Throwing the floo powder onto the ground. Threads of green flames begun to wrap around them as their bodies turned weightless, vanishing from area.</p>
<p>Harry felt his shoulders started to relax. His eyes stung painfully the flames which surrounded him died out as a giant flash of light formed before him a white silhouette appeared. A beautiful woman with blonde hair gazed in stern approval giving a curt nod. Any control he previously had were relinquished from his control and thrown somewhere against his will. Struggling to gain a hold of himself and thrashed around. It proved to be fruitless. Nothing Harry could do seemed to work and heard the whining from Black. They were trapped and unable to fight back watching as the golden woman vanished from their sights.</p>
<p>Then they submerged into a pool of green. His body <em>tensed</em> up at the moment he came in contact with the liquid and drowned. <strong>Pain</strong> instantly shot through him feeling his mind starting apart within. Memories, muscles and his magic screamed in unison. <strong>Pain</strong>. Just absolute <strong><em>PAIN</em></strong> stabbed into every fiber of his being tearing. Harry could feel his skin begin set on fire and his body crushed together where as his nerves were being stabbed by hundreds upon hundreds of white hot knives. The excruciating pain had been unlike anything he had experienced, unable to hear his own screams. His magic started to suffer from the effect of the green tightening up so much he felt restricted, unable to breath and as thought it would cause him to explode.</p>
<p>With his last ounce of strength Harry witnessed Black being forced back into his human form. The pain from the green finally consumed his vision falling straight into darkness.</p>
