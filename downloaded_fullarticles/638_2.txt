<p>It’s eleven o’clock on Sunday morning. Harry is puttering around Grimmauld Place, wearing his old Quidditch shirt and those <em>ridiculous</em> muggle tracksuit bottoms. </p>

<p>In one hand Harry holds a battered paperback; the other holds the <em>bilge</em> he calls coffee. Harry doesn’t say much. He calls these weekends his sanctuary: his safe space in a chaotic, busy life. </p>
<p>Draco presses a kiss against rough, musky skin. “I bloody love you,” he murmurs.</p></div>
