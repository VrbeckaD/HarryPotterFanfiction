<p>
  <span>Galas were never Damian’s idea of a relaxing Friday night. Doing patrol and taking down the lowly criminals of Gotham sounded like a much better use of his time; but Todd and Drake were taking care of that, and Grayson was in Bludhaven on official BHPD business. They’d all left him to suffer alone with old ladies pinching his cheeks and nosy reporters sniffing around where they didn’t belong.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, well! If it isn’t my favorite other billionaire?” Damian eyes locked on the approaching men, one with an impeccably groomed goatee and the other with an expression screaming “I-don’t-know-what-I’m-doing.” The man with the goatee met his gaze and asked, “New partner, Wayne?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“My son,” Bruce said, placing a hand on Damian’s shoulder. “Damian, this is Tony Stark. Tony, this is my son, Damian.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wow, who’d </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>get busy with?” Stark asked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bruce ignored the comment, turning to the anxious one. “I don’t believe we’ve met. Bruce Wayne.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh! I’m, uh, I’m Peter. Parker. Peter Parker. I mean, my first name’s Peter, my last name’s Parker. It’s not like a hyphenated name like Peter-Parker. Well, that </span>
  <em>
    <span>is </span>
  </em>
  <span>my name, it’s just not hyphenated…” His face turned pink as he took Bruce’s outstretched hand. “It’s an honor to meet you, sir.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Damian scoffed. “You don’t go to a lot of these, do you?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Peter’s face grew redder and Bruce hissed, “Damian.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What? He looks like he went for a swim in a pool.”</span>
</p>
<p><span>“You can’t just say that to people, Damian. It’s rude.”</span><span><br/></span> <span>Damian rolled his eyes and crossed his arms. Tony just snorted and said, “You’ve got a little sourpuss there, I see.” He patted Peter on the shoulder and said, “I’ll leave you with pipsqueak over here while Wayne and I chat, ‘kay, kid?”</span></p>
<p>
  <span>“Mr. Stark—!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Father—!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Both Damian and Peter were cut off their respective adult walking away, already in a deep conversation about the financial crisis and crime spikes in big cities. Damian glared back at Peter, who was shifting his weight from foot to foot and glancing at every possible exit point—the windows, the door that led to the hall, the door that led to the balcony, and the vent. “Are you always like this?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Peter jumped. “What?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you always like this?” Damian repeated.</span>
</p>
<p><span>“Like what?”</span><span><br/></span> <span>“</span><em><span>This</span></em><span>.” Damian clarified, “A mess.”</span><span><br/></span> <span>“Oh, I… well—”</span></p>
<p><span>Damian huffed. “Do you know how to form a proper sentence or even a phrase?”</span><span><br/></span> <span>“I do!” Peter frowned. “Dude, why are you so mean?”</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Damian found himself rolling his eyes again. “I’m just trying to make conversation. No need to be such a baby.” Peter opened his mouth to retort, but Damian held a hand up to silence him. “Look, you’re unfortunately the only entertainment I have at this. If I’m going to survive the night, you need to at least be able to say something without tripping over every word.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What about me?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Damian narrowed his eyes. “What about you?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I—nevermind.” Peter’s eyes darted around the room and Damian followed his gaze once more, trailing over the guests, the chandeliers, the musicians, before settling on the buffet tables lining three of the four walls. There were different categories on each table—appetizers on one, entrees on the second, and dessert and drinks on the last. Damian noticed Peter’s incredibly puppy dog-like gaze at the three-tiered chocolate cake on the third table and sighed. “Let’s go.”</span>
</p>
<p><span>“What?”</span><span><br/></span> <span>“Is everything I say going to be followed by a pointless question?”</span></p>
<p><span>“If you don’t give me any context, then yeah!” Peter ran a hand down his face, mumbling, “This is a nightmare.”</span> <span><br/></span> <span>“For you and me both,” said Damian. “Come on. Let’s get that cake you want so badly.”</span></p>
<p>
  <span>“How did you—?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just follow me.” Damian didn’t wait, weaving through the crowds of men in suits and women in tight gowns. A waiter narrowly missed Damian’s face with a tray of crab cakes, earning a heated glower from the boy. As the waiter scurried off, Damian peeked over his shoulder, Peter nowhere to be seen. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Damian suppressed a grunt and turned back, searching for a nervous, sweaty teen. Honestly, it wasn’t hard to find him. Peter, despite having one of </span>
  <em>
    <span>the most generic faces Damian ever saw</span>
  </em>
  <span> looked acutely out of place in the ballroom, unmoving among the flow of people. Damian stopped over, grabbing Peter by the arm. “You’re really dumb.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Peter didn’t reply, letting out a loud sigh. “Here.” Damian, rather brutally, cut a piece of cake and handed it to Peter. When Peter didn’t grab a fork, Damian glowered. “Are you just going to stare at it, Parker?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Peter looked from the fork to Damian and back to the cake before reluctantly taking the silverware. He shoved a piece in his mouth, and Damian rolled his eyes as Peter savored the taste. “Follow me. You’re the only form of entertainment here.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I just got my—”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Now.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright, alright. Jeez.”</span>
</p>
