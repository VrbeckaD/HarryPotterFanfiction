  <em> (Harry didn’t want to remember. But he didn’t have a choice—) </em>
</p><p>He sat on his four-poster bed, observing the thin black diary that Lucius had dumped into Ginny’s cauldron days ago.</p><p>
  <em> Curiosity. Distrust. </em>
</p><p>Harry couldn’t say which one had caused him to notice the little black book with golden calligraphy along its spine. Perhaps it had been a combination of both that had him reaching inside Ginny’s cauldron and taking what was neither his, nor hers, nor — apparently — Lucius Malfoy’s.</p><p>
  <em> Tom M. Riddle. </em>
</p><p>The words glittered up at him, shining as brilliantly as they had in Diagon Alley.</p><p>And just like last time, Harry didn’t resist the temptation to pick it up.</p><p><em> (“No!” Harry wanted to scream, powerless to stop the memory of himself reaching for the diary.) </em> </p><p>His fingers grazed the textured binding as he ran his hands across the leather cover, lifting it and flicking through the diary’s blank pages. He pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped a blot onto the first page.</p><p>The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second before vanishing, as though sucked into the page. After a moment of surprise, Harry excitedly loaded his quill a second time and wrote,</p><p>“My name is Harry Potter.”</p><p>The words gleamed momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without a trace. Then, at last, something happened.</p><p>
  <em> “Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did you come by my diary?” </em>
</p><p>Harry stared at the words appearing on the page in his very own ink, too stunned to write anything.</p><p>
  <em> (Don’t do it. Don’t respond, don’t—) </em>
</p><p>As the words began to fade away, Harry quickly scribbled back.</p><p>“Someone dropped it into my friend’s cauldron.”</p><p>He waited eagerly for Riddle’s reply.</p><p>
  <em> “I see. A friend of yours, perhaps?” </em>
</p><p>Harry’s eyebrows raised in surprise as he answered, “Definitely not.” He paused his quill before continuing to let on the thoughts that had been swirling in his mind, bothering him for a while. “And he definitely dropped it on purpose.”</p><p>Because there were so many ways to get rid of a book besides dropping it in an eleven-year-old’s cauldron. But the more Harry thought about it, the more <em> purposeful </em>Lucius Malfoy’s actions seemed. He remembered the malicious intent in those pale eyes, clear as day…</p><p>
  <em> “Luckily, I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink. But I already knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read.” </em>
</p><p>“What do you mean?” Harry scrawled rapidly, blotting the page in his anticipation.</p><p>Riddle’s reply came after a pause, his fine calligraphy a sharp contrast to Harry’s own increasingly messy handwriting.</p><p>
  <em> “I mean that this diary holds memories of great and terrible things. Secrets that were fated never to be discovered until you, Harry Potter, came across it.” </em>
</p><p>Harry’s eyes widened, his chest thumping the slightest bit faster.</p><p>There was something enthralling about the way Tom Riddle phrased his words. They were as pretty as his penmanship, and Harry found himself clinging to every letter.</p><p>
  <em> “But first… tell me about yourself.” </em>
</p><p>Harry paused abruptly, narrowing his eyes warily at the diary in his possession. But he was already intrigued, he’d already made up his mind. And with his quill in hand, he began to write back. <em>   </em></p><p>(<em> Don’t fall for it, Harry thought desperately. But his warning was a mere whisper against the call of his nightmares… of his darkest memories…) </em></p><p>The memory faded to black. And suddenly, a soft, cruel voice was corrupting the memory of those beguiling remarks from Harry’s past, overlapping one another and showering him with an attention Harry could have never dreamed he would <em> want so badly </em>—</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Tell me more about yourself.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “1992?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Youngest seeker in a century. Impressive…” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “You’ve been so brave, Harry.”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>All that admiration, all that affection… all for naught.</p><p>A tall, handsome, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar, watching him. He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though Harry were looking at him through a misted window. But there was no mistaking him.</p><p>“A memory,” said Riddle quietly. “Preserved in a diary for fifty years.” He straightened up from the pillar and began to pace, his half-solid heels beginning to click against stone.</p><p>Harry lay on the floor of the chamber, barely staying conscious. His weakened limbs refused to move. Tears streamed down his cheeks, equal parts hurt and frustration, and bile threatened to crawl up his throat as Riddle stalked closer to him.</p><p>This boy, whom he had trusted with his innermost insecurities and deepest desires.</p><p>Riddle was still watching him, idly twirling Harry’s wand between his long fingers. A smile curled at the corners of his mouth as he continued to stare at Harry, running his tongue along his upper teeth before continuing to speak.</p><p>“Haven’t I already told you,” Riddle murmured, “that killing Mudbloods doesn’t matter to me anymore? For many months now, my new target has been — you.”</p><p>He waved his wand, unscrambling letters that should never have been scrambled in the first place—</p><p>
  <em> Tom Marvolo Riddle. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I am Lord Voldemort. </em>
</p><p>Even in his weakened state, Harry couldn’t hold back a gasp of horror.</p><p>And then the older boy laughed, a high, cold sound that shouldn’t have suited him but somehow <em> did, </em> perfectly. It was high like the tinkling of bells, with a cool, metallic undertone. It made the hairs stand up on the back of Harry’s neck, but it also made his stomach flutter with an unnamable sensation, even after <em> everything </em>.</p><p>Riddle vanished the letters, turning those piercing eyes on him.</p><p>There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now as he stepped even closer, his half-solid feet threatening to step on Harry’s fingers. To break them, like they had already <em> broken </em>him.</p><p>“I’m going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter.” His lips curled softly once more, the prettiest thing in the chamber. “Take your time. I’m in no hurry.”</p><p>Harry’s body convulsed again, holding back a sob. Even now, he found Tom Riddle’s offhand, morbid sense of humor almost endearingly charming, and it hurt <em> so much. </em></p><p>
  <em> Hurt. Betrayal. </em>
</p><p>God, it <em> burned. </em>Every breath set his lungs on fire.</p><p>“I…” Harry’s voice was hoarse, his throat clenching excruciatingly around every syllable. When he spoke again, it was barely a whisper. “I loved you.”</p><p>
  <em> (Idiot. Shut up, shut up, shut up—) </em>
</p><p>Riddle raised his eyebrows at the boy beneath him, his smile twitching downwards in the ghost of a condescending sneer.</p><p>“Silly boy. You are not even old enough to know what love is.”</p><p>He began to finger his wand threateningly, as if pondering whether to simply end Harry’s existence right then.</p><p>But Harry wasn’t done.</p><p>“I… <em> cared </em>for you,” he insisted, before breaking into dry coughs that hurt every part of his body.</p><p>Riddle’s eyes flashed with impatience. “Mere infatuation. You fell for a <em> lie, </em> like every other <em> … </em>” He trailed off.</p><p>Every other… what?</p><p>But Riddle didn’t give him any more time to think, because then he was pointing Harry’s wand directly at him, his eyes darkening with the intent to <em> kill— </em></p><p>He lowered his wand, thinking better of it.</p><p>Riddle began to hiss.</p><p>
  <em> “Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four.” </em>
</p><p>And finally, as the great big Basilisk emerged from the hole in the statue, Harry was struck with the realization that no one was coming to save him… that he would have to save himself.</p><p>Somehow mustering the strength to lift himself, he raised the hand that held Gryffindor’s sword and charged.</p><p>
  <em> (Blood—hissing—teeth biting—he couldn’t tell his arm from Gryffindor’s sword… couldn’t tell Riddle from Slytherin’s Basilisk…) </em>
</p><p>And once he’d defeated the great snake, Harry was unable to prevent himself from looking at Riddle.</p><p>To see if he was <em> angry. </em></p><p>(To see if he was <em> awed. </em>)</p><p>Riddle looked at Harry, unfazed as ever. “It makes no difference. In fact, I prefer it this way. Just you and me, Harry Potter… you and me…”</p><p>
  <em> You… and… me… </em>
</p><p>Harry thrust the basilisk’s fang into the diary, and a look of horror and outrage washed over Riddle’s handsome features.</p><p><em> “What have you done?” </em>hissed a desperate voice… the words of a dying creature struggling to survive against the odds.</p><p>Time seemed to stop as Harry turned once again to face his captor, still gripping the bloody fang.</p><p>
  <em> (He was powerless to watch as nightmares infected his memories.) </em>
</p><p>Suddenly, those handsome features twisted inhumanly, growing vicious and ugly. Riddle’s skin grew paler by the second, his nose flattening against his skull. His eyes flashed a horrifying red, and his black, slitted pupils came closer and closer until the only sight visible was—</p><p>
  <em> Darkness. </em>
</p><p>All motion stopped. The Chamber disappeared as complete nothingness surrounded him.</p><p>And then Harry was <em> flying. </em></p><p>He was soaring through a starless night sky, past a broken window and into a dark room containing nothing but a decrepit chair.</p><p>
  <em> (When did this start to feel less like a… dream…?) </em>
</p><p>A hunching figure kneeled at its feet, sobbing and wheezing uncontrollably.</p><p>“Now, Wormtail,” came a chilling, high-pitched voice, far colder than any voice he’d ever heard, “perhaps one more little reminder why I will not tolerate another blunder from you…”</p><p>“My Lord…” implored a faraway voice, echoing pitifully down the gloomy passageways of the house. “No… I beg you…”</p><p>
  <em> “Crucio!” </em>
</p><p>Harry screamed, the scar on his forehead searing with pain—</p><p> </p><p align="center">. . . </p><p align="center"> </p><p>“Harry! <em> Harry! </em>”</p><p> </p><p>Harry opened his eyes. </p><p>He was lying on the floor of Professor Trelawney’s room, curled into a fetal position. His vision grew blurry when he blinked, his eyes watering from the intensity with which his scar continued to burn.</p><p>He shivered inwardly, tensing upon the cold floor. The pain of the <em> Cruciatus </em> had felt real. But the vivid memory of Riddle’s words had been far worse. Beguiling and beautiful, sharp and <em> cutting—  </em></p><p>“You all right?” Ron asked, kneeling next to him, his voice hushed and terrified.</p><p>It was then that Harry realized the whole class was standing around him.</p><p>“Of course, he isn’t!” Professor Trelawney declared, pushing her way towards Harry with great excitement. She gazed at him intently with wide eyes. “What was it, Potter? A premonition? An apparition? What did you see?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Harry lied, sitting up and wiping sweat from his brow. He could feel himself shaking at the diary’s words, which had been more memory than nightmare if he was perfectly honest…</p><p><em> No. Forget, </em>he ordered himself. He willed himself to once again suppress the events that had occurred nearly two years ago… events he still struggled to move past…</p><p>Harry found that remembering Dumbledore’s words from back then helped, sometimes.</p><p>
  <em> “You were the victim,” Dumbledore said firmly, his eyes not leaving Harry’s for a moment. “You are immensely brave, and strong-willed, to have escaped on your own as you did.” </em>
</p><p>Most of the time, they didn’t.</p><p>
  <em> Brave. </em>
</p><p>Harry couldn’t help but flinch at the memory of that word, reminded of how the diary Tom Riddle had once complimented him for that same quality.</p><p>
  <em> “Lord Voldemort is a mastermind manipulator; far older and wiser wizards have been hoodwinked by him…” </em>
</p><p>Amused, burgundy eyes and a charming smile flashed in his mind’s eye, forever unforgotten, making Harry feel weak, making him feel utterly <em> disgusted </em>with himself—</p><p>Then that high, bell-like laughter was ringing in his ears and—God, Harry was going to be <em> sick. </em></p><p>
  <em> Why couldn’t he just forget? </em>
</p><p>He sucked in his breath, clenching a hand against his crawling stomach. His throat throbbed familiarly as he swallowed, saliva oozing down his sandpaper lungs.</p><p>Emotions he’d so long ago resolved to never feel for that <em> object </em>continued to relentlessly attack him, slithering back into Harry’s subconscious—</p><p>“I need to go to the hospital wing, I think,” he said quietly to no one in particular, his eyes darting towards the door. “Bad headache, and my throat’s a bit—”</p><p>“My dear, you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary vibrations of my room!” Professor Trelawney clasped her hands together in excitement. “If you leave now, you may lose the opportunity to see further than you ever have before—”</p><p>“I don’t want to see anything except a headache cure,” Harry interrupted curtly, his tone leaving no room for argument.</p><p>As he stood up, the class backed away. They all looked unnerved.</p><p>“See you later,” Harry muttered to Ron, ignoring Professor Trelawney’s expression of great frustration as he picked up his bag and heading straight to Dumbledore’s office.</p><p>There were far more important matters at hand than a sore throat.</p><p> </p><p align="center">. . . </p><p align="center"> </p><p>Breakfast was a very noisy affair at the Gryffindor table on the morning of the Triwizard Tournament’s third task. Post owls appeared, bringing Harry a good-luck card from Sirius—a piece of parchment bearing a muddy paw print on its front.</p><p>None of the rush distracted the trio from discussing yesterday’s events in hushed voices.</p><p>“So you had a dream,” Ron started, his features tightening, “about You-Know-Who torturing… torturing Pettigrew.” He shook his head, his brows furrowing. “What does that mean?”</p><p>“What does Professor Dumbledore think?” Hermione asked as she leaned forward on the table, her eggs and books long-since abandoned. “Is <em> He </em> …” her voice dropped to a whisper, “getting <em> stronger? </em>”</p><p>Harry sighed, pushing his plate back and looking at them. “Not sure. All Dumbledore told me was that he thinks my scar hurts when Voldemort is near me, or when he’s feeling a particularly strong surge of hatred.”</p><p>Ron paled. “Near you?”</p><p>Harry looked down at the wooden desk. “I… I don’t know. It’s all just theory at this point.”</p><p>He didn’t tell them how Dumbledore had supported his theory with <em> proof… </em>that the years of Voldemort’s ascent to power had been marked with disappearances. Bertha Jorkins’ in Albania, Mr. Crouch, within Hogwarts grounds…</p><p>“Did you see anything else?” Ron asked, both of them continuing to look at him earnestly. </p><p>Harry’s mind blanked, his throat going dry. All of a sudden, their stares felt intrusive.</p><p>“No.” His response had been short, fast enough for Ron and Hermione to catch his lie and continue to stare at him intently.</p><p>Harry bit his lower lip, running a hand through his wild locks. “Just… same old.” He cleared his throat, his voice dropping to a lower pitch. “Chamber stuff.”</p><p>He tensed and braced himself, anticipating their looks of pity even before looking up.</p><p>Ron was looking back down at his plate, staring hard at its contents with an expression of helplessness. And Hermione was looking straight at him, her eyebrows furrowed with boundless concern.</p><p>“Oh, <em> Harry… </em> ” Hermione said softly, her expression gentle and cautious. <em>   </em></p><p>Harry gave a mirthless laugh, shaking his head self-deprecatingly. Merlin, he should have just stuck with the lie. There had been no need to remind his friends of the ordeal from their second year…</p><p>Even if he had spent years repressing, remembering, <em> pining </em> and <em> wanting </em> and <em> hating himself— </em></p><p>Harry’s hands clenched beneath the table as he stopped himself from clutching at his own head. His throat burned, as if he’d just finished screaming at the top of his lungs. Why of all days did he have to recall everything so vividly the day before the third task? Now, of all times, when he needed to stay focused and aware.</p><p>As they were wrapping up breakfast and wishing him good luck, Harry saw Fleur Delacour get up from the Ravenclaw table and join Cedric in a side chamber across from the Great Hall. Krum slouched off to join them shortly afterwards.</p><p>The tall, blond-haired seventh year stuck his head out of the chamber, peeking out both ways before catching Harry’s eye.</p><p>“Harry, come on! They’re waiting for you to start — we need to get down to the Quidditch field now.”</p><p>Harry stood up, grim dread filling his limbs at the thought of what the final task would require of him. </p><p>When they arrived at the Quidditch field, it was completely unrecognizable. A twenty-foot-high hedge ran all the way around the edge of it, unyielding save for a gap at the very front: the recognizable entrance to the vast maze.</p><p>Mr. Bagman cast a <em> Sonorous </em>and began to speak. “Ladies and gentlemen! At last, the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament is here. Champions — we are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze…”</p><p>Harry’s eyes widened as he took in the sheer amount of people that had begun to fill the stands, tightening his hand around his wand nervously.</p><p>“... and if you encounter any difficulties and wish to be rescued, send red sparks into the air…”</p><p>Adrenaline surged through his limbs, blood rushing to his ears as Bagman finished speaking and began to count down.</p><p>“So… on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!” said Bagman, calling out the names of the pair tied for first. “Three — two — one —”</p><p>He gave a short blast on his whistle, and it was a blur from there.</p><p>Harry ran fast, his lit wand held above him. Every few minutes, he would look behind himself, the back of his neck prickling with the sensation of being watched. But if anything was, Harry couldn’t see it—the maze grew darker with each passing minute as the sky overhead deepened to navy, obscuring his vision wherever the hedges didn’t.</p><p>“<em> Point Me, </em>” he whispered to his wand, holding it flat in his palm.</p><p>Empty paths lured him into a false sense of security. Winding routes were exactly as they seemed.</p><p>His heart pounded faster when he heard Fleur scream, a sense of foreboding deepening his lingering fear.</p><p>
  <em> One champion down. </em>
</p><p>Harry was in the middle of battling an enormous Blast-Ended Skrewt, its thick armor glinting in the light from his wand, when he heard Cedric’s voice.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Cedric’s voice yelled, uncharacteristically angry. “What the hell do you think you’re doing?”</p><p>And then Harry heard Krum’s voice.</p><p>
  <em> “Crucio!” </em>
</p><p>He froze, stunned, as echoes of a cold, chilling voice hissing that exact spell in his nightmares came to him—</p><p>Shrieks pierced the air, spinning him into action.</p><p>Harry began sprinting up his path, trying to find a way to Cedric. He threw a <em> Reducto </em>at the hedge and shoved his way to the other side through a blackened hole. Krum cut his spell short as soon as he saw Harry, realizing he was outnumbered and beginning to run the other way. But Harry caught him with a stunning spell to the back.</p><p>He dashed over to Cedric, who had stopped twitching and was lying panting, his hands over his face.</p><p>“Are you alright?” Harry asked roughly, grabbing Cedric’s arm and pulling him up.</p><p>“Yeah,” Cedric panted out, his hand grasping at the ground beneath him to find his fallen wand. “Yeah… I don’t believe it… he crept up behind me… and I heard him, I turned around, and he had this wand on me…”</p><p>Cedric stood up, his legs visibly shaking as they both looked down at Krum’s fallen form.</p><p>“I can’t believe this… I thought he was all right,” Harry whispered raggedly, even as a darker inner voice reminded him that someone<em> else </em> he’d thought was perfectly all right turned out to be a perfect <em> monster… </em></p><p>He shook his head, clearing perpetual thoughts of <em> Him </em>to the back of his mind. “I suppose we’d better go on.”</p><p>They split up, and it wasn’t long before Harry ran into a sphinx—a creature with the body of a lion, tailfeathers of a bird, and head of a woman.</p><p>“So… so will you move, please?” Harry asked futilely, knowing what the answer would be.</p><p>“No,” she said, continuing to pace. “Not unless you solve my riddle.”</p><p>
  <em> Riddle.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Fuck this. </em>
</p><p>Harry’s shoulders tensed, his eyes flickering darkly. God, why was he suddenly noticing <em> Him </em>everywhere?</p><p>He answered correctly — a “spider” — only to run into Cedric fighting the very creature, albeit Hagrid-sized. Harry shot a spell at the giant spider as well before taking off with the older Hufflepuff.</p><p>And they were still together when they reached the very center of the maze.</p><p>Cedric came to an abrupt pause, his longing expression clearly visible under the golden light given off by—Harry’s eyes trailed off towards the right—the Triwizard Cup. </p><p>“Take it,” the older boy said quietly.</p><p>“No, Cedric,” Harry protested, shaking his head. “You’re the one who—”</p><p>“Harry,” Cedric said, more firmly. “Without you I would have been done for.”</p><p>Harry recognized Cedric’s determined look. He considered arguing further, but his exhaustion won out. </p><p>“Fine. On three, we’ll grab the cup together, yeah?” Harry confirmed, watching as Cedric nodded hastily before before beginning to count down. “One — two — three —”</p><p>As he grasped the handle at the same time as Cedric, Harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his navel. His feet had left the ground, and he found he could not unclench the hand holding the Triwizard Cup.</p><p>His world dissolved into swirling color, the wind howling around them.</p>
