    <p dir="ltr">          Albus crouched low in the icy woods, pulling his fine black cloak around him in a feeble attempt to keep warm. His breath rattled in his chest, sending out puffs of steam illuminated by the clear, cold moonlight. His face stung and bled from being whipped by branches during his desperate escape, and he could feel his left ankle throbbing inside his new leather boots. It all seemed so silly now; just a few hours ago he’d been ecstatic, staring at his finely dressed reflection in the mirror of his dormitory. The dress boots, polished to a shine and secured by silver buckles shaped like serpents. Black wool trousers held up by leather suspenders, a silky white shirt with puffy sleeves, a perfectly fitted black vest with a real silver chain. He’d even been given a black silk ribbon to tie his unruly hair back, the same hair that was now matted and wild, stuck to his face with sweat and blood. Despite his best efforts, Al felt tears well up in his green eyes. <em>How had it all gone so wrong?</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">          “Potter,” a voice next to him wheezed, snapping him out of his misery. “Al. <em>Albus.” </em></p>
<p>
  <em>          Scorpius. </em>
</p>
<p><em>          </em>Al looked despairingly at the other boy, shuddering violently in the cold. Scorpius was similarly disheveled, his fine clothes in tatters, and his already pale complexion had turned a ghostly white color. <em>He’s been outside too long,</em> Al realized urgently. <em>He needs warmth. We both do.</em> Al gripped his wand tightly inside his robes, mind racing; a fire would make too much smoke, too much light, and they had to keep moving. If he wasn’t such a rubbish wizard, he could’ve used warming charms, like the ones his mother cast into the chilly corners of Grimmauld Place in the winter. The only other option was to try and make it to the castle; they could find a professor, or Filch, or <em>someone,</em> they had to know what was going on, yes they’d be punished but it was better than dying in the Forbidden Forest, he should’ve known better all along, his parents would be so disappointed, they might not find his body until spring, oh God it was too much, all too much…</p>
<p>          “Albus,” Scorpius rasped again, centering Al’s frantic mind. “You need…you should go,” he managed. “It’s me they want. I can buy you time to get back. Someone has to be told what’s happened,” he panted, breath hitching as he shivered. Compared to Albus, Scorpius seemed almost serene; his grey eyes were cool with determination.</p>
<p>          “N-no,” Al stuttered, horrified. “I won’t leave you here. We’re getting out together-”</p>
<p>          “Do you even know where we are?” the blonde interrupted. “Or how to get back?”</p>
<p>          Albus felt his heart sink; Scorpius was right. They’d been at the lake before, but had fled so quickly, hounded by the others, that Al hadn’t paid much attention to which direction they’d been going. Looking around, he could see nothing but the dense, endless forest. “We…we can fight them together,” Al said weakly, hating that his voice betrayed his lack of confidence as always. There was no chance, and Scorpius knew it too.</p>
<p>          “They’d kill you,” Scorpius said firmly, “and then me. That’s the price for defying them. You knew that.” Scorpius swallowed thickly, eyes downcast. “As did I.”</p>
<p>          Al’s bottom lip trembled, tears threatening to spill over again. “I <em>won’t</em> leave you,” he said through gritted teeth, reaching down to squeeze Scorpius’ frozen hands. “I couldn’t live with myself if I did…”</p>
<p>          “You’ll have to learn, I suppose,” Scorpius replied softly, running his thumbs over the back of Al’s hands. “I’m not worth it, Al. You’re <em>Harry Potter’s</em> son. You’re the future of all of us.” Scorpius smiled ruefully, eyes filled with an emotion like Al had never seen before. “I’m just the traitor’s son who got you into this mess.”</p>
<p>          Al shook his head frantically as Scorpius spoke, muttering denials. “I’m not, I’m <em>nobody,</em> I’m the Slytherin Squib, I can’t even save you, I’m-”</p>
<p><em>          “Stop,”</em> Scorpius snapped, making Al flinch. “Just stop,” Scorpius said again, more softly. “That’s your whole problem. You won’t look beyond your own fear, and see yourself the way other people see you. The way I’ve always seen you.” He leaned closer to Al, their puffs of breath mingling, still clutching each other’s hands. “There’s more to you than you know,” Scorpius whispered.</p>
<p>          A sob bubbled its way out of Al’s chest, wrenching his shoulders together. “I don’t want to leave you,” he whispered hoarsely, feeling his warm tears cooling as they streamed down his face.</p>
<p>          “I know,” Scorpius said, giving his hands a final squeeze, almost as in farewell. <em>He’s saying goodbye,</em> Al realized, horrified.  “But you have to,” he continued insistently. “Someone has to know what happened here.”</p>
<p>          “But-”</p>
<p>          Al’s protests died in his throat as Scorpius drew his own wand; its wicked curve and exposed wood where Scorpius had burned and carved bits out had always fascinated him. Many other students mocked and feared it in equal measure, with the symbols and Roman numerals carved into it, but to Al, it was like Scorpius had carved his life story, his entire being into it. Scorpius winced as he stood, pointing his wand into the air. <em>“Verdimillious tria,”</em> he murmured, sending a cascade of green sparks into the air.</p>
<p>          Al winced at the sudden burst of light, panic hammering in his chest. “What are you doing?!” he hissed. “They’ll <em>see,</em> they’ll find us-”</p>
<p>          A matching burst of green lit up the sky not far from them. Al could hear voices now, footsteps crashing through the brush. Then another, much further off, lit up the sky. “That way,” Scorpius growled, grabbing Al and thrusting him towards where the distant sparks had originated. “Hogwarts. Find someone. Tell them what happened. Tell them what we did.” The voices were closer now; Albus recognized some of them, belonging to people he’d thought were friends up until that night. “I wish…” Scorpius began, running a cold hand along Al’s cheek, brushing away the moisture there. “I’m sorry,” he breathed instead, shaking his head.</p>
<p>          “Scor-” Al started, but the other boy gave him a sharp push in the other direction.</p>
<p>          “Go,” Scorpius said firmly, as their pursuers drew perilously closer. He held his wand tightly in his shaking hands, gritting his teeth as he turned to head them off. <em>“Now!”</em></p>
<p>          Stumbling, Al moved away slowly, hoping against all hope that someone would come and save them. He wanted his father, he realized, more than he’d ever wanted him to be here, <em>to help,</em> to make everything alright again. But he wasn’t here, he wasn’t coming, and Al realized, brokenhearted, that he’d be so ashamed if was.</p>
<p dir="ltr">          Voices screamed out, spells lit up the night, and Albus turned away and ran.</p>
