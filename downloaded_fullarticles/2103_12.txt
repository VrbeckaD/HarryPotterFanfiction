    <p>Dean Winchester walked in the crowded station, flanked on either side by his brother and best friend. Sam, Dean and Cas were fish out of water in this situation, having grown up in the U.S and not having left the country since last week left them unsure of how to act when surrounded by the British.  </p><p>They navigated through no-majs, a difficult task when laboured with full trolleys. More than once, one of them bumped into a no-maj and received an angry torrent of abuse. After about ten minutes of wandering aimlessly though, Dean decided to check his ticket again. When he had read it he looked to his brother.</p><p>“Where in Merlin’s name are we supposed to find Platform nine and three quarters? Why have the English got to make everything so damn complicated!”, Dean said.</p><p>“We would just ask someone”, Sam Winchester said, not really paying attention as he was reading his charms book.</p><p>“Oh yeah Sammy”, Dean said, his voice dripping with sarcasm, “We would ask a no-maj and they would totally not point us in the direction of the nearest mental hospital”.</p><p>“I meant ask a wizard”, Sam mumbled, still embroiled in his charms book.</p><p>“Well, if you see a wizard Sammy, please feel free to share with the class”, Dean said, impatient now.</p><p>“That boy’s a wizard,” Castiel Novak said, speaking up for the first time. Pointing at a boy with light brown hair and scars on his face, pushing a similar trolley to theirs, “I’ve been watching him for some time and he seems to have an owl, and a wand”.</p><p>“Well, Cas”, Dean said, turning on his best friend, “That would have been pertinent information about five minutes ago”.</p><p>“I didn’t think it was of import”, Cas said, his large blue eyes looking up at Dean. </p><p>Dean just proceeded to roll his eyes and gestured for them to make their way towards the wizard. So the three pushed past no-majs until they were close enough to the boy. Now that they were close, they would see that the boy was about their own age with piercing grey eyes.</p><p>“Sammy”, whispered Dean, “Maybe you should do the talking, you know ‘cause you’re the best at all of that social crap”.</p><p>Sam nodded and stepped towards the boy, clearing his throat.</p><p>“Hi um, sorry, just are you a wizard?”, Sam asked, so much for being the best at all that social crap.</p><p>“Yes”, the boy mumbled looking up shyly, “M’name’s Remus Lupin, who’re you?”</p><p>“I’m Sam Winchester, this is my twin brother Dean and our friend Castiel, are you a Hogwarts first year too”, Sam asked.</p><p>“Yeah”, the Remus answered, then looked up inquisitively at the three boys, “Are you American?”</p><p>“Yup”, Dean said, “Born ‘n’ bred in Lawrence Kansas, we would’ve gone to Illvermony, but our uncle Bobby knows Dumbledore so here we are”.</p><p>Remus nodded, looking interested, “So is there anything you need help with, being new to the country and all?”, he asked.</p><p>“Yes please”, Cas said in his deep gravelly voice, “We were wondering how you would get onto the platform”.</p><p>“Oh that’s easy”, Remus said with a smile, obviously happy to help, “I was just going to head to the platform now if you want to join me”.</p><p>The three boys nodded and followed Remus down the station, they saw other Hogwarts students, with trolleys, laboured with rats, owls, cats and all manner of books. Finally, they came to a halt in between platforms nine and ten.</p><p>“So all you have to do is run straight at the wall between platforms nine and ten, then you’ll be on the other side”, Remus said to the horror of the other boys.</p><p>“Are you kidding me? I mean, are you sure that’s safe?”, Sam asked, his eyes wide.</p><p>“Yeah, sure”, Remus answered, “My dad told me to go a bit faster if you were nervous”.</p><p>Dean nodded, taking it upon himself to go first, the wheeled his trolley around towards the wall and ran towards the barrier. Just as he was about to hit the wall, Dean shut his eyes and braced himself, but was surprised when the didn’t feel the wall against his side. Instead, he heard a sharp train whistle, and when he opened his eyes, Dean saw a scarlet steam engine.</p><p>Soon after, Sam, Cas, and Remus emerged through the barrier, looking slightly frazzled (running through a solid wall for the first time tends to leave you a bit shell-shocked). And the four of them pushed their trolleys towards the train, the wheels rattling against the uneven stones.</p><p> </p><p>“We better, get going”, Sam said, glancing at his watch, “The train’s about to leave”.<br/>
They boarded the train, just as it was pulling out of the station, and made their way down the long hallway. All of the compartments were full and the hallway crowded with friends seeing each other for the first time all summer. They finally found a compartment near the end of the train, where a redheaded girl and a thin boy had just exited from. The compartment now contained only two boys, both with dark hair.</p><p>Sam cleared his throat, “Sorry, can we sit here, everywhere else it full”, he said, addressing the boys.</p><p>“Sure”, the boy with messy hair said, “I’m James Potter”.</p><p>“Sirius Black”, the other boy said through a mouthful of chocolate frog.</p><p>“Remus Lupin”, Remus said holding out his hand for James and Sirius to shake; they obliged.</p><p>“I’m Dean Winchester,  my twin Sam, and our friend Castiel Novak”, Dean said pointing each of them out in turn, then pausing to think. “Black… Aren’t they the English douchebags?”</p><p>Sirius turned pink, “Yeah, but while I’m at school, I kinda want to get away from my family’s reputation. And for the record, I think that they’re douchebags too”.  His family was obviously a part of himself that he hated with every fibre of his being. </p><p>“But you guys aren’t from here right?”, James asked, trying to change the subject, “Your accents are different”.</p><p>“Yes”, Cas said, “We are from Kansas’</p><p>“All three of you? , Sirius asked.</p><p>“Yeah”, Sam said.</p><p>“But why do your parents want you to come here”, Sirius asked curiously, “Isn’t Illvermony closer?”</p><p>“Yeah, but our Uncle Bobby knows Dumbledore and he thinks we’d be better here,” Sam said. “And none of us have parents, our mother died when we were six months old, and our dad when we were eight. And Cas’s parents were part of the resistance against Grindelwald and were killed just after he was born”, Sam said, the words weighing heavily on his heart. “But Uncle Bobby’s been a real help, taking us in and all”.</p><p>“Yeah”, James said, “That must’ve been really-”</p><p>He was interrupted by the clattering of trolley wheel and the shouts of “Anything from the trolley, anything from the trolley”.</p><p>“Ooh”, James said with excitement, “Anyone want to go with me to get anything?”</p><p>Remus stood up and pulled out a few coins, “I’ll come, wouldn’t mind a chocolate frog”.</p><p>Dean fished in his pocket and handed a handful of coins to James, “Would you get me something good, I haven’t heard of half of these things, anyway, and  I don’t have a clue how this English money works”.</p><p>James nodded then he and Remus slid open the door and left the compartment. Sam, Dean, Cas and Sirius spent a few moments in awkward silence, then Sam opened his charms book and the others started looking out of the window, watching the fields and villages zipping by. About five minutes later, James and Remus re-entered the carriage, James’ arms overflowing with sweets.</p><p>Dean let out a happy cry and started digging in, instructed by James, Sirius and Remus as to what things were. The next hour or so past in a blur of sugar and small talk, then Sam checked his watch and looked at the others.</p><p>“We’d better change into our robes, we should be getting in soon”.</p><p>They all rummaged around in their trunks and pulled out their robes. Once the had found his Remus headed towards the door.</p><p>“Where are you going, mate?”, asked James.</p><p>“Oh, I think I’ll change in the bathroom”, Remus replied, slightly pink, then left the carriage.</p><p>James shrugged and pulled the shutters and they all started pulling on shirts and ties. Within a few minutes Remus had returned in his robes and a few minutes later they heard the whistle blow as the Hogwarts Express pulled into Hogsmeade station.</p>
