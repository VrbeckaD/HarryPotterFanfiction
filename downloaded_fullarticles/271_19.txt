    <p>Sirius was drunk, and though he couldn't focus on one thing for more than five minutes, his grey eyes found something unusual almost looking like a carving in his favorite (and only) werewolf's bedpost. Remus was downstairs, in the common room studying for a transfiguration exam coming next Wednesday, his honey-brown curls illuminated by the fire, making them look ginger, and his green eyes intently focused on some dusty book McGonagall had loaned him, so Sirius, drunkenly, decided to take a quick look, as it was probably some etching left by past lovers. As he took stumbling stride's forward, he realized it was something different. There was a small ‘X’ lightly carved into the wood, Sirius placed his index finger over the etching and traced it, then came a faint click as the bedpost opened a small compartment.  </p>
<p>    The compartment was painted to look like the forbidden forest at sunset, even as drunk as he was, Sirius recognized that this was Remus‘s work done with the acrylic paint Lily had bought him as a Christmas gift fourth year. Inside was a small, leather-bound book, a larger black spiral book (some muggle thing Lily had bought him as well) and an old worn piece of yellowed paper. Only a small sliver of his brain reasoned that going through obviously person items of Remus's was a bad idea, so he grabbed all three treasures and got comfortable against the pillows that he knew too well. </p>
<p>  His hands were drawn to the paper, so he started there, as he unfolded worn paper he realized it was the letter James, Peter and he had written to him the first time he went through a full moon with them knowing. It was full of sorry for them meddling in his personal life, and them explaining how they still wanted him to be friends with them. </p>

  <em>‘Remus was alone in the library, researching for the assignment Slughorn had given them, when he heard the footsteps approaching, his green eyes left the page to find the three faces of his newly found pains in his ass. Peters chubby face was turned downwards, blonde locks falling into his face, Sirius was looking off to the side, refusing to look him in the eyes and James was nervously running his hands through his hair. “What did you guys do now? I'm not doing your homework again” Remus huffed, highly irritable with the full moon approaching. The boy felt bad, but he couldn't ever properly apologize without telling them about his secret. “uh, James, Peter, I'll tell him. Go get some chocolate from the kitchens for later” Sirius said as he pulled out one of the chairs and sat down, his voice filled with anxiety. The other two left, whispering to themselves. Remus gave Sirius a questioning look, “tell me what?” he asked, Sirius sighed, “well you see, we were worried about what happens to you each month and why you get all those scars” the black-haired boy began as Remus felt his heart begin the quicken, “and while at first, I thought something was happening at home, as you always say it's just ‘a family emergency’, James found this book and well, now we know” out of his bookbag Sirius pulled a book about dark creatures, and the page marked was all about werewolves. Anxiety rose in Remus, and tear flooded his eyes, he met grey eyes and left in a hurry, needing to find a place to be alone. He knew he shouldn't have come to Hogwarts, he would never be normal. Sirius calls faded as he ran faster than he's ever done before, straight to the forbidden forest where he could be left alone with himself.’</em></p>
<p>  He smiled and folded it back up, putting it back in the compartment. Next, he picked up the book Lily got him, he opened the first page to see one of Remus's drawings, a beautiful landscape of the lake. He flipped through a few more pages, finding profiles of different people, landscapes and sometimes doodles, Sirius tucked a lock of his hair behind his ear and flipped a page to find his own face drawn so beautifully. It was his face, smiling so hard his eyes crinkled at the edges, Sirius had forgotten how Remus could capture every detail of someone. He put this back alongside the letter. </p>
<p>  He then grabbed the leather book, it was small and worn and the pages were yellowed but it smelled of chocolate and herbs. Of Remus. Sirius carefully opened up the first page, Remus's name printed in loopy handwriting at the top. </p>
<p>        <em>‘<u>August 30th, 1971</u></em></p>
<p>
  <em>I begin attending Hogwarts tomorrow, mum gave me this, she told me to write what I felt when times got tough. I'm nervous, people are going to find out my secret and then I'll be sent home. I want to go, but I was fine being homeschooled, dad was the one who forced me to actually go. I'm scared to leave home, I stopped playing with the children of my town after the incident. We moved to the country, where mom taught me muggle maths and English and took care of me, I'll miss her and I'll miss dad too. Dumbledore is nice. I want to go to Hogwarts.’</em>
</p>
<p>  Sirius had just found Remus's diary, and he was about to continue to read until he heard footsteps coming up the staircase. He closed the secret compartment and hopped on to his own bed, tucking the book under his pillow, then pretended to sleep. He listened as Remus walked James and Peter to their beds before he returned to his own, whispering goodnight to each of them as he went. Bedsheets ruffled and with a quick “nox” the lights were out.</p>
<p>  Sirius drifted to sleep, not understanding the mess he had just gotten into.</p>
