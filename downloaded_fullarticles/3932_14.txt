    <p>Harry slowly opened his eyes then smiled to himself when he saw who was sitting beside his bed. Draco was asleep in the chair right next to his bed with his knees touching the clean, sterile mattress. He looked so peaceful. Lately, all he saw from Draco was pain and sorrow and utter devastation. He never said anything, though, he always put on his Ice Prince of Slytherin face. Harry could see it in is eyes, though. He saw how much him being sick hurt him. Harry really hated it. He wanted the blonde to be happy and to be carefree. He was so caught up in his thoughts that he didn't notice that Draco had woken up. </p>
<p>   "Love, what are you doing awake? You need to get your rest." Draco said softly and reached over, taking his love's small hand within his large one. </p>
<p>   Harry just grinned at him and shook his head before he laced their fingers. "I'm not so tired anymore. You know, I was thinking that maybe I would feel a lot better if I had you in bed with me. I haven't had your cuddles in a few days." He teased softly. </p>
<p>   Draco cracked a smile and stood up after he slid off his shoes and crawled into bed with his little mate. He laid down on his side and wrapped his arm around Harry, holding him close. </p>
<p>   "Much better, Dray." He whispered softly and buried his face into his mate's chest. "I could lay like this forever." He mumbled and tucked his head under Draco's chin. "I was thinking, that we could get married soon. I-I know that you wanted to wait, but I really don't want to. I want to be. Harry James Potter-Black-Malfoy. And you bet your butt that I'll be using the whole thing. If I didn't have to keep my names, I would be very happy just being Harry Malfoy." </p>
<p>   It took Draco a few moments to respond because he was a little choked up. He cleared his throat and nodded his head, letting Harry know that he was good with that idea. "When?" He asked quietly. </p>
<p>   Harry closed his eyes and shrugged. "Whenever Molly and Hermione can put something together. I don't want something big, I just want something small for our family. I-I want to do it as soon as possible, because I'm unsure of how long I'll be feeling okay to stand up for a while." </p>
<p>   "Anything that you want, love. You can have it however you want." Draco said and kissed the top of Harry's head. It had been a long 3 months for him and Harry. It was a good morning, they both had slept well the night before and Harry was feeling great until he wasn't. Draco was at the Slytherin table and Harry was at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall when it happened. He was enjoying his meal and was listening to his friends when he saw Harry stand up suddenly and started coughing. Moments later, he ended up passing out and had to be rushed to the infirmary then transported to St. Mungos. It turned out that someone had poisoned Harry and they had no idea with what and how to save him. Ever since then, Harry had gotten sicker and sicker and had to spend more time in bed. Some days, he was so weak that he could barely open his eyes. It tore Draco apart seeing his little mate so sick. </p>
<p>   Severus was doing everything that he could and they even looked in other countries for solutions. They didn't find anything but Draco would never stop trying. He was basically in denial about the fact that his mate was dying. Sirius and Remus were both a complete mess and Sirius had lost it a few times. The last time was the worst though. Harry had been coughing up blood and had a nose bleed at the same time and Sirius had really lost it. He had yelled, "Parents are not supposed to bury their children, children are supposed to bury their parents!" And he stormed out of the bedroom and out of the house. He tried hiding for a few days but Remus wouldn't allow that. The fact was that they were running out of time. He did not want to bury his mate, his soon to be husband. They were supposed to get married and grow old together. They were supposed to have lots of babies, so many babies that it rivaled the Weasley clan. Both of their friends and family had been allowed to leave Hogwarts in order to spend what time Harry had left with him. </p>
<p>   "Dray?" Harry asked softly. He loved laying like this with his mate. </p>
<p>   "What is it, baby?" Draco asked and slid his hand up the back of Harry's shirt. He needed to feel his mate, he needed to feel that he was still warm and alive.</p>
<p>   "I-I know that you don't want to hear it, but I need you to listen to me and not interrupt me until I'm done." Harry said and pressed closer to his mate. </p>
<p>   "I promise that I won't say anything until you're done talking." Draco promised. </p>
<p>   "A few weeks ago, when you were with Severus, I talked to dad and he took me to this place, where they made something happen. I started asking about if there was a way for two males to have a baby, even if one of the parents were dead. Like with women, they can freeze their eggs. I wanted to know if there was something that they could do for me and they did." He said in amazement. He still couldn't believe the things they could do these days. "They took some of my magic, the kind that allow men to have babies and they harvested it. You can either have the baby yourself or get a surrogate. A man or a woman can carry the baby but the baby will be all us. I know that I'm dying and I doubt that we'll be able to figure this out before I actually die. I want you to try and find someone after me. Someone to help you raise our baby's with you. You are an amazing person and you are so loving and so wonderful. I don't want you to be alone." He whispered and wiped his cheeks against Draco's chest. </p>
<p>   Draco closed his eyes tightly, tears were rolling down his cheeks. He didn't want to think about living his life without Harry and he certainly didn't want to think about raising a child without him being there. It was like having a knife shoved into his heart, having this conversation. "I'll think about it. I do not want to be with anyone else but you and I don't want to raise a child without you. But it gives me something to live for, the baby. Knowing that there will be a child that came from both of us, that's an amazing thing." He looked down at his little love and smiled slightly. "You're tired, love. Why don't you go to sleep." He said. </p>
<p>   "Love you." Harry whispered before falling back to sleep. </p>
<p>   "As I love you. So very much." Draco murmured and rested his cheek against the top of Harry's head. </p>

<p>*************************************</p>
<p> </p>
<p>    11 years earlier</p>
<p> </p>
<p>   Harry was in his cupboard and he was scared. There were a lot of noises going on outside of the little door and it was scaring him. He was only 4 but he was the size of a small 3 year old. He was so young but already had so much wrong done to him. He was very scared of his uncle Vernon and his cousin Dudley. Though, his aunt Petunia was the worst. She made him do everything and he didn't even get fed when he fixed meals for his family. </p>
<p>   He was huddled in the corner of the cupboard when he heard his name. He only knew it because he heard his aunt tell a neighbor his name. "Harry?" The masculine voice called out. "Come here, sweetheart. No one is going to hurt you, I promise." The voice said. </p>
<p>   After a lot of coaxing out, he finally went to the man. The man had long shaggy hair and he had blue/grey eyes. He really liked the mans eyes. They were very warm and welcoming. </p>
<p>   "That's it. Thank you for coming out. I don't think you'd like a guy my size trying to come in there with you." The man teased. </p>
<p>   Harry tilted his head and stared at the man before he smiled. He reached out slowly and took the man's hand. The next thing he knew, he was in the man's arms. He was nice and warm and he smelled good. </p>
<p>   "That's it, pup. I'm not going to hurt you, I promise." He said. "I'm Sirius. Sirius Black and I'm your godfather." Sirius said and bent down and picked the small boy up and held him close. "Remus is so happy that I finally get to bring you home." He said and buried his face into the small boys dirty hair. He wasn't sure how long ago that it was washed but he didn't care, he had their boy back. </p>
<p>   Harry tensed slightly, he wasn't used to someone touching him, let alone hugging him. "R-Remus?" He asked shyly. </p>
<p>   Sirius grinned proudly when Harry spoke. "Yes, Remus. He's my husband. He lives with me. Now you're going to be living with us. I hope that is okay."</p>
<p>   Harry chewed on his bottom lip slowly before he nodded. "That would be okay." He said slowly. He didn't want to upset the man who was taking him away from this place. </p>
<p>   Sirius could tell that the little boy was going to need a lot of work. He didn't want Harry to be afraid of him or Remus. Really, any adult. They had a lot of people going in and out of Black Manor and he didn't want Harry to feel like he had to stick to his room. He also knew the moment he got home that he would have to contact Severus Snape and get the potions that Harry was going to need. "Pup, is there anything that you want to take with you?" </p>
<p>   Harry frowned at that name. He wasn't a puppy. He was a big boy. He shook his head and grabbed the silver and gold blanket that he always had with him. </p>
<p>   Sirius frowned when he realized that his godson didn't have anything to take with him. "Come on, sweetheart, let's go." He said and carried Harry out of the front door and gave a quick look at the aurors that came with him. Once he was outside of the house, he apparated to Black Manor.</p>
