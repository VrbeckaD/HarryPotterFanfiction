    <p>“Tell me this is just another prank,” he groaned, rubbing his hands over his face.</p><p>“Draco, there’s a big difference between stealing your clothes while you’re showering and telling you I’m pregnant.”</p><p>“How could this even happen?”</p><p>“I seem to remember a few times in the empty Potions classroom when you assured me that contraceptive charms weren’t necessary <em>every </em>time,” she said sarcastically.</p><p>“It was only a few times though!”</p><p>“Well it only takes one time!”</p><p>“Hermione, this is very bad timing. I mean sure, some day, but right now…”</p><p>“Unless you have an illegal time turner, this is happening ‘right now.’”</p><p>“We haven’t even graduated! I’m a social pariah and you’ve got this amazing career ahead of you! How can we raise a child?”</p><p>Finally having enough of his whining, she placed her hands on her hips and stood directly in front of him. “Draco Malfoy, you need to get yourself together. This is happening whether you like it or not. We will figure it out. It is not the end of the world. This baby is going to need a father. Social outcast of not, you’re going to be a great parent. End of story. Okay?”</p><p>He sighed loudly. “Damn your stupid Gryffindor courage.” He paused and composed himself as best he could. “Of course I’m going to be this child’s father. I will stand by you and support you no matter what. As long as you’re okay with your baby having a father like me.”</p><p>Hermione knew very well the toll the war had taken on Draco, but it still broke her heart when he talked so lowly of himself. She closed the gap between them and put a hand on either side of his face. “Draco, when are you going to get it through that thick skull of yours that you are not what people define you as. You were a death eater, but in the end you saved Harry’s life. You have a good heart. No matter what they did to you, you never succumbed to their evil. You are a Slytherin, but that doesn’t make you a villain. You are not a coward, even if you lack my ‘Gryffindor courage.’ You are a good man, maybe even great. I am the smartest witch of our generation and I love you. If that isn’t proof enough of your character, I don’t know what is.”</p><p>He placed one hand over hers and looked up. “I will never understand the unfailing faith you have in me. Honestly, I don’t know where I would be without you.”</p><p>“You probably would have jumped off the Astronomy Tower where I found you all those months ago. Or worse, you could still be slumming it with your Slytherin groupies.”</p><p>“Oi, at least I had groupies. We couldn’t all be part of the Golden Trio.”</p><p>“You could have replaced Ron. We would have be exponentially more efficient if you had.”</p><p>He shrugged in mock modesty. “What can I say? Comic relief is nothing compared to superior intellectual capabilities.”</p><p>“Merlin, can you imagine if I’d ended up with him instead of you?”</p><p>“Let’s not talk about it. It’s a sore subject.” His semi happy demeanour returned to its earlier melancholy.</p><p>She smacked his arm lightly. “It is not. I chose you. I will always choose you. Do you really think I could settle for anyone less intelligent than me?”</p><p>“We’ll have time to graduate first, right? We won’t have to drop out again?”</p><p>“Draco, we graduate in three months. I think you’d be able to tell if I was that far along.”</p><p>“Should we…tell people?” he asked sheepishly.</p><p>“Maybe we should start by telling them we’re dating? It might be a bit of a shock to tell them everything right off the bat.”</p><p>“Can you heal most hex related injuries?”</p><p>“Draco, they are not going to hex you.” He eyes her dubiously. “They aren’t going to hex you <em>badly</em>,” she amended.</p>
