</center><p>Albus glared at the invitation in his hand before flinging it down onto the table and throwing himself into a chair. There it was: the absolute confirmation that James was getting married. It was evidence of the world's madness, he mused, that James was getting married before he was. James "I will never settle down" Potter was in a serious relationship while Albus lazed around in his one-bedroom flat alone, save for his cat Malcolm. And really, how had the prat managed it? How had he managed to convince America's star seeker to marry him? It didn't make sense that James, immature childish James, found love. It wasn't fair.</p><p>Realizing how petty he sounded, Albus scowled again and got up. He started to pace around the room and argue with himself about whether or not he was obligated to go.</p><p>"He is my brother, after all," he said out loud, making Malcolm look at him owlishly from his perch on the back of a chair. "And it's his special day or whatever. It's kind of an obligation, right? I have to toast him or something?" Malcolm just blinked. "You're no help," he grumbled at the cat. "Then again he probably won't miss me with all the people. Mum might be pissed though. At least he didn't ask me to be in the wedding party."</p><p>Walking to the table, he picked up the invitation again and looked at it. The plus one glared back at him tauntingly and he dropped it again, groaning.</p><p>It wasn't that he wanted to settle down--he was perfectly happy being single--but the reaction he knew he would get from his family alone about his extended single status made him want to skip the wedding completely. He hadn't had a boyfriend for at least five years, and over the past year, his family had taken it onto themselves to get him a date. This meant that every other week or so someone would call or write with an offer to set him up with a coworker or a friend's brother or something. At first, he appreciated their help, but after months of failed blind dates, the offers seemed less helpful and more annoying. Nothing he had said so far had stopped their constant meddling so he found himself avoiding large family meetings where they could all gang up on him and discuss his love life, or lack thereof.</p><p>“Do you think they would notice if I just didn’t go?” he asked Malcolm, who answered with a wheezing cough.</p><p>Albus looked at Malcolm hacking up a hairball onto his chair. Maybe he could pretend he was sick. A good case of wizard pox might do it... Mott had become a healer, maybe he would write him a fake write up for old time's sake. But would the retribution from James and everyone when they found out he had skipped out be worth it in the end? It might just be easier to go and get it over with.</p><p>"I'll call Rose, she's good at this sort of thing," he told the hacking Malcolm and picking up the mess of wires and metal that made up his homemade phone. It was one of Teddy's first models, an old one from back when Albus was in his first few years of Hogwarts, but he loved it enough to refuse a new slightly more usable one. The phone, which pulsed purple and let off a dull humming sound from the number of complex and unidentifiable spells placed on it by Teddy to make it work around magic, had been slightly disassembled in the process of making it work. It therefore resembled less of an ordinary Muggle flip phone and more of two pieces of plastic and metal attached by a mass of wires and what looked like glitter glue.</p><p>Albus waved his wand over it absent-mindedly to make a holographic keypad appear in the air above it. He punched in Rose's number and was pleased when she picked up immediately, panting slightly.</p><p>"Al, why don't you take Teddy's offer to make you a new phone? This one always makes mine hum and glow when you call, it's most inconvenient."</p><p>"Hello to you too, Rosie," Albus returned cheerfully, grinning despite himself. He did miss seeing Rose on a daily basis now that she was the head of Muggle relations. "Is this a bad time?"</p><p>"No, no, you're fine, she replied, sounding harried. "One of the new interns managed to set Carnage's desk on fire and well, you know how Carnage gets when his stuff is touched. And they set it on fire, of all the..." She sighed and trailed off. "My job is troublesome enough without having to deal with incompetent teenagers." Albus laughed. His cousin deciding to go into Muggle relations hadn't really been a surprise for him, even when she rose to the top in a few short years. If he remembered correctly, She’s the youngest head of a ministry department. "Speaking of incompetent teenagers, how are you?" She teased, bringing him back. "You haven't called me in ages."</p><p>"It's been a week Rose, don't exaggerate," he replied with an affectionate eye roll. Rose had an affinity for the hyperbole. "Besides you were busy with that orphan thing. Didn't want to distract you."</p><p>"You’re sitting and staring at that wedding invitation again, aren’t you. And you want to know whether or not I think you should go?" She asked, demonstrating her ability to simultaneously change topics abruptly and guess exactly what he was thinking.</p><p>"Well... Yeah, pretty much," he responded, feeling a bit foolish for being so transparent. "It's just Molly has been calling me almost every week now and I think I'll go mad. I'm surprised she hasn't called yet, come to think of it."</p><p>"Oh she will,” Rose promised, sounding as if she was running. "She has her hands full with the triplets right now but I bet she'll call you as soon as she has the time."</p><p>"So should I go?" Albus asked her, hoping she knew of a way she could get him out of this.</p><p>"I know this isn't what you want to hear Al but I think you should go," she replied over the sound of something breaking. "He is your brother, and you should really show him support. He's probably really nervous."</p><p>Albus frowned; he hadn't thought about that. James had a tendency to freak out right before big events. Before he played his first game of Quidditch at school, he had flooed home in a panic and it had taken Albus ten minutes to calm him down before James made him promise to come watch the game and never tell anyone about that moment. He had never found out how James had access to a floo as a second year, come to think of it.</p><p>"But the press will be there," he complained half-heartedly, knowing already that he was convinced. He would be a complete ass if he missed his brother’s wedding just because he didn't like being in the papers.</p><p>"All the more reason to go," Rose reasoned. "Do you really want another influx of articles about how you're breaking away from the family or something? Think of all the fan mail."</p><p>"Point taken. Alright, I'll go, but if anyone talks about my lack of a date I'm going to poison them."</p><p>"That's my little Slytherin," Rose snorted. "Glad we've sorted that out. Now I'm sorry but--OI! Exactly what do you think you’re doing, Beeks? Put that Niffler outside before I shove your wand so far up your--" The line shut off mid-yell, cutting off the end of Rose's threat that Albus had no doubt she would follow through with. How a ministry job was that exciting, he didn't know, but Rose was always full of stories about maniacal interns and judging by that call, he didn't doubt them.</p><p>"So it looks like I'm going," he told Malcolm in a resigned voice. "You could have talked me out of it, you know, but Rose beat you to it." He stared at the cat for a moment before shaking his head. "Merlin I need a hobby." Summoning his Muggle coat from somewhere behind the couch, he waved at Malcolm and headed for the door. "I suppose I'll go buy the happy couple a wedding present. Don't wait up, I'll probably stop by Flourish and Blotts. Do you think James might like a sixth-year Transfiguration textbook? There's a sale." Before he could make it out the door, however, his phone rang again.</p><p>He didn't worry about who it was, as only family and a select number of friends had his contact, but picked it up with a wave of his wand. To his displeasure, Molly's loud voice came through the speaker.</p><p>"Albus? Are you there?" Sighing in resignation, he sat down in the chair and answered her.</p><p>"Yeah, I'm here," he replied, hoping but not particularly caring if she picked up on the annoyance in his voice.</p><p>"Oh good! I was wondering, do you have a date to the wedding yet? Imagine, James, getting married! I don't quite believe it, do you? I never expected him to settle down before you."</p><p>"Uh huh," Albus retorted dryly. Molly didn't need him to talk, he just had to grunt occasionally. But right now he didn't have time to listen to her. "Listen, Molls, I was just on my way out the door. I really need to go shopping, can we do this another time?"</p><p>"Oh I'll only take a moment of your time then," she replied with a small laugh. "There is this dashing foreign wizard working with my department that I thought you'd be interested in. He doesn't speak much English but his nonverbal magic ability is frankly astounding and he always wears these strange looking cufflinks I think you'd be interested in. I could ask him if he wanted to go to the wedding with you if you like."</p><p>"No thanks Molly," Albus answered through clenched teeth.</p><p>"Oh, don't be like that Albus. You need to live a little! How old are you now? And when is the last time you went on a date? It doesn't have to mean anything, it could just be a little fun. Let me ask him for you," Molly continued, ignoring Albus' protests.</p><p>"I really don't need you to do that," he insisted darkly. Why did she have to bother him, of all people?</p><p>"Albus you're wasting your life away. I'm going to ask him for you, it will do you some good. I showed him your picture the other day and he was certainly interested, so--"</p><p>"Actually I already have a date," Albus interrupted loudly.</p><p>He could barely hear Molly's surprised "oh!" Over his own muffled swearing when he realized what he had just said. Of all the stupid, illogical... But Molly was talking again.</p><p>"...didn't realize you had already procured your own date, I don't know what I'll tell Bradley..." Bradley? Merlin, even his name sounds prat-like. Molly always picked the worst boys. But what had he gotten himself into now? How was he supposed to get out of this one?</p><p>"Listen, Molly, I've got to go. I'll see you at the wedding, yeah?" He interrupted her rambling, ignoring her protests and hanging up the phone. He looked at the phone as if it was its fault for his sudden moment of Gryffindor-like stupidity. He heard a meow and saw Malcolm giving him a skeptical look as he licked his tail meaningfully.</p><p>"Oh yeah? Why didn't you say anything to stop me then?" He retorted tetchily, ignoring out of habit the absurdity of talking as if Malcolm was actually insulting him.</p><p>With a groan, he got back out of his chair and made his way to the door for the second time. He might as well get his shopping out of the way.</p>
