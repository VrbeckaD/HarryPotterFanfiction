    <p>The big white tents were filled with laughter and people dancing all around. The whole Weasley family was reunited to celebrate the wedding of Ginevra and Harry. They have been waiting for this moment for so long they were thrilled to finally witness it. The two lovers too had waited for this moment for so long, and yet, Hermione couldn't bring herself to be happy for the new couple. Sitting alone at a table with an empty glass in her hand, her gaze lingers on the whiteness of the tablecloth. She was lost in the depth of her thoughts.</p>
<p>Turning around, the young witch looked at Harry, the young man she came to consider like a brother and couldn't help herself but envy him. After years of waiting for this moment to happen, he finally got to marry out of love, something that has been taken away from her. The war was over now, Voldemort has been defeated, they could go on with their lives and start to build a brighter future. Little did they knew that said future only brightened for Harry and Ron. And here she thought they were fine.</p>
<p>Out of nowhere, the Ministry announced it in the freaking Daily Prophet! Because of the previous war and the many losses the Wizarding world had suffered, Muggleborn witches are compelled to bow to the new Marriage Law. This law stipulates that the selected witches will be put under the care of their future husband, who will happen to be a Pureblood wizard, and are expected to produce an heir. If that wasn't hard enough, the selected witches will become housewives and no longer be an active member of the Wizarding World.</p>
<p>They are taking everything away from them: their future, their freedom, their happiness...</p>
<p>Silent tears glided down her cheeks as she watched Harry and Ginny waltzing around, a romantic song playing softly in the background. She quickly wiped the tears away and turned her back on them, refusing to let them see her in that state. She was mad beyond words at them for considering the Marriage Law as a good thing and for planning Hermione's wedding ahead, sincerely believing it will do her good, that she will be happy once she's married. Maybe they really were wishing the best for her, but it wasn't the Marriage Law. She begged them to get her out of here, and here is the only answer she got :</p>
<p>"You don't know if they will choose you, and if they do, who are you to disobey?"</p>
<p>Molly turned her back on her, certain that she knew better than Hermione what was good for her. The woman that was like a mother to her was now her worst enemy. Maybe she just wanted to keep the young witch close to her after losing one of her kids. Arthur didn't even budge, working for the Ministry itself, he was good at hiding what he was truly thinking. But apparently, it didn't bother him to push Hermione in the arms of an unknown wizard. So, she tried to talk to the only family she ever had, Harry. And here are what his last words for her were.</p>
<p>"You're just anxious your future husband may not like you, just like Ron. I'm sure you'll be fine!"</p>
<p>Just like the others, he didn't understand what was wrong with the whole situation. It was like they all deliberately refused to face the truth, because it was ugly and because they were not ready to open their eyes just yet. But she couldn't wait for them to realize it, she needed to find a way out. Fortunately for her, she was the wisest witch of her time, yet it didn't help her to come up with a plan to escape from the Aurors the Ministry probably had sent after her. She knew all to well that if she tries to escape they will catch her, and she wasn't strong enough to defeat Aurors all by herself. She only had two solutions left and she really wished they will work.</p>
<p>As she pushed her empty glass away from her, she felt it. It was brief and faint, but she knew what it meant. Fighting off Voldemort and his Death Eaters taught her to feel the danger before it came. This ability helped her many times.</p>
<p>The music stopped.</p>
<p>They were here.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, she closed her eyes and forged herself an unflappable mask.</p>
<p>"So, they chose you to kidnap me." She slowly stood up and turned to the big crowd in front of her. "Hello, Moony."</p>
<p>The wizard greeted her with a simple nod.</p>
<p>"It does not have to end like this if you come with me willingly."</p>
<p>She involuntarily stiffened under that statement.</p>
<p>"You really don't know me if you think I'm gonna bow to that kind of law."</p>
<p>Remus sighed, his eyes closed. " Hermione."</p>
<p>"I won't marry out of love. Having children won't be my decision. The only "job" I'll ever have is a housewife. What kind of life is that?"</p>
<p>"I'm not here to discuss the law."</p>
<p>"You're right." She slowly moved her hand to grab her purse, only to find it was no longer hanging on the chair. She took a quick glance at it to verify.</p>
<p>"Are you looking for this?"</p>
<p>She froze, knowing without looking what Remus was holding out in his hands. How did he... She stopped her train of thoughts and looked at the crowd behind him. With their face, contorted by guilt, she knew they had betrayed her.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry." Was all Moony said before breaking, in one swift movement, Hermione's wand.</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"Hermione Jane Granger, from now on, you are no longer an active member of the Wizarding World and are put under the care of your future husband."</p>
<p>"No, I'm not!" She replied through gritted teeth before digging into her pocket, searching for her last hope.</p>
<p>Remus just closed his eyes and shooked his head saddened by her attitude.</p>
<p>"The cyanide's not here anymore."</p>
<p>She stopped dead in her tracks. So they did took everything away from her. She started to panic, her whole body shivering.</p>
<p>"Take her."</p>
<p>As someone caught her from behind, her body trembled even more. An incredible pain coursed through her like a burning flame. Devastating and powerful. She tried to grab that force and control it. She opened her eyes, eyes that glowed from the power welling up from her. The air around her started to crackle and the light bulbs started flickering from a force so violent that everyone could feel it. Some glasses exploded under the pressure.</p>
<p>"Hermione, I'm begging you. Stop that!"</p>
<p>But it was clear in her eyes that the young witch was out of controlled. Driven by pure instinct, she was like a lioness in a cage. A true Gryffindor.</p>
<p>The crackling of the light bulbs was stronger, ready to explode. The earth started to tremble. Hermione was ready to drown them under an ocean of power and anger. When two Aurors took out their wand, Hermione used a wave of power to send the woman holding her, flying across the room before sucking the light of a few light bulbs and sending them flashes of lightning. The others counterattacked, but Hermione replied with an invisible shield. Then she gathers this newfound energy to suck up all the lights in the room in herself before sending it back in a powerful shockwave, disintegrating the tent and knocking everyone down.</p>
<p>She fell on her knees when this power left her, draining with it a lot of her energy. She started to regain control of her body and mind, wondering what happened just now. But seeing everyone down and injured, she knew it was time to move. With a little spark of power, she opened a portal, wishing for it to bring her to a safe place before jumping in.</p>
<p>She landed in a dark and freezing land covered by snow. She didn't waste time trying to pinpoint where she was, the Aurors were on her tracks. She threw her high heels away and started running bare feet in the snow. Entering what seemed to be a forest, she slalomed between the many trees, avoiding the explosive curses thrown at her. She wished she knew how to use wandless power, but she didn't even know how she knocked them all down. Maybe it was just luck.</p>
<p>The dark night kept her from seeing where exactly she was going. Her heart felt like it was burning, she needed air, and her feet were ice cold. She turned a corner and tumbled down a hill. When she hit the ground, she felt the coldness of the snow insinuate itself in her body, paralyzing her. Exhausted, out of breath and broken, she asked herself during the split of a second what was the point of fighting?</p>
<p>However, she got back up and leaned against a tree, her vision fogged, yet, she could see a woman a few feet from her, looking at her with concern in her eyes. She was saved!</p>
<p>"Help..."</p>
<p>She didn't have time to finish her sentence that a curse sends her flying in the air, fortunately, the woman was reactive enough. She took out her wand and used it to make her land softy next to her. Her heart skipped a beat when she saw the young witch was turning blue.</p>
<p>Four Aurors appeared in front of them, wands aimed in their direction.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I got this." She whispered to Hermione before standing up to face the intruders.</p>
<p>"What is going here? Why are you attacking her?"</p>
<p>"This young woman needs to come with us. She escaped when the Ministry asked her to bow to the new Marriage Law."</p>
<p>The woman turned her head to the young witch, impressed by the amount of courage needed to fight against her own Ministry. Turning back her attention to the Aurors, her eyes sparkled with rage.</p>
<p>"I've heard about that disgusting law, unfortunately for you, gentlemen, you are in Bulgaria here. So, unless you have the approval of my Ministry, I kindly suggest you leave this country because I'm not letting you touch her."</p>
<p>"But the girl..."</p>
<p>"Is under my protection! Now... Get OUT!"</p>
<p>The last word was pronounced with such force that it sends a little shock wave, making the four Aurors flinch.</p>
<p>"We'll be back! With or without the approval of your Government! This girl will bow to our laws!"</p>
<p>They didn't let her replies. They turned their back on her and left.</p>
<p>As soon as they left, the woman rushed to Hermione side and gave her her coat. Using a simple spell, she called back her family that rushed to her side. Three young men appeared before her.</p>
<p>"We need to go back to the house. Viktor, I need you to carry her for me.</p>
<p>Nodding briefly, the young man approach and flinched the second he saw her face. Even after all these years, he could never forget her.</p>
<p>"Mina?"</p>
