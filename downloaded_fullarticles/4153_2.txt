</p><p>Concentric circles.</p><p>One, two, three, four.</p><p>Until they become too many to count them.</p><p>I’ve always found the Great Lake of great comfort in these moments.</p><p>The surface of the water, at night, twists my reflection, showing the chaos reigning inside of me.</p><p>I stare at the flask in my hand and I drink.</p><p>I drink, drink, drink.</p><p>I drink so that I won’t think about Remus, laying in our dormitory, so that I won’t imagine that wrinkle that I’m sure is decorating his too young forehead.</p><p>I drink, because he hates me when I do.</p><p>And a little, in the end, I hate myself too.</p><p>Then all of a sudden the water of the lake stops, motionless. I lean in a little bit more, as if I wanted to fall, to let myself be surrounded by its cold and wet embrace.</p><p>And I see what I truly am, what I try to hide even to myself.</p><p>I’m a relict, and I know he thinks that as well.</p><p>Inside me and between us, confusion is in command, it has fun playing with our feelings, with this unease of mine that finds no answer.</p><p>Remus keeps looking for a way to make me feel better.</p><p>And I... I drink, hoping that the alcohol burning in my veins will finally destroy me.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>He smiles. It’s one of his bloody bitter smiles, but I try to let it be enough, because I know that these days I can’t get nothing more than this from him.</p><p>He looks around, barely restraining himself from disapproving my constant untidiness.</p><p>“I see you’ve settled in.” he comments, with an irony that doesn’t belong to him.</p><p>I smile back to him, trying to make him feel comfortable.</p><p>He’s antsy, I see it. I feel it.</p><p>Pretending nonchalance, I go toward the kitchen, getting back with a bottle of Ogden’s Old Firewhisky.</p><p>“We should celebrate.” I say, feigning a cheerfulness that I don’t truly have.</p><p>He keeps looking at me, in his eyes an infinite sadness.</p><p>“How long can we go on like this?” he asks, low, as if he didn’t truly want an answer.</p><p>I get gloomy, losing the will to pretend. I close my eyes slowly and I sigh.</p><p>“You’re the one who insists with hiding. You hide your bloody monster and you hide us, don’t you?” I accuse him, bitterly. He bit his lips, intolerant.</p><p>“I’d like to see the sunlight as well, Sirius.” he murmurs. I snort, sarcastic.</p><p>“I don’t know why, but it sounds a lot like rubbish.” he doesn’t answer, aware that I’m tired of his excuses. He collapse on the couch, while I open the bottle and start drinking.</p><p>I drink, and I feel just the mess, as if he was a part of it. All of a sudden, his words fade, along with his face.</p><p>We stay quiet. A silence that weighs, that hurts.</p><p>But it would never hurt like the knowledge that we want different things.</p><p>He wants to think and reason, I want to fog my mind.</p><p>And I drink, to crush the image of the precocious wrinkles on his face.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>It’s delirious. Pure and simple anarchy.</p><p>Tens of people laughing, dancing, having fun.</p><p>James and Lily are at the centre of the room, ignorant of what happens around them.</p><p>I’d love to join them. Remembering what a true smile is, learning what bliss means, the uncorrupted kind, the stainless one.</p><p>Then I see him.</p><p>Sitting in a corner, with an half smile giving away its own insincerity.</p><p>In one hand an old lighter, which he turns on and off, in a mechanical gesture I’ve seen him making too many times.</p><p>In the other, a chalice of elf-made wine, almost empty.</p><p>I get closer to him, without saying a word. When I’m right next to him, he’s the first to talk, his tone slurred, with the looks who doesn’t really know where he is.</p><p>“I’m happy for them.” he comments, as to justify his attitude. I sigh, bite my lip and close my eyes briefly.</p><p>“Then why?” I murmur, with that frustration that only he can give me.</p><p>“This is all we’ll never be.” he replies, harsh, with a sudden lucidity.</p><p>He stands up with little balance, empties his glass in a sip and goes to the closest table to refill.</p><p>I watch him, without trying to stop him.</p><p>I know that inside of him nothing’s at its right place, and that this is his way to react.</p><p>I just wonder if I wasn’t the one to do this to him.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>How many years have gone by, Remus?</p><p>Thirteen? Fourteen?</p><p>And you’re always there, a few more grey hair and the same expression.</p><p>Around us there’s an unnatural order, which doesn’t belong to me.</p><p>But I can’t see it, I can’t see anything of this.</p><p>Just your eyes, disappointed, with just one question in them.</p><p>Yes, I’m drunk. I’m drunk of this half-life, drunk of boredom, drunk of this feeling of suffocation.</p><p>Drunk of Firewhisky, of all the alcohol I managed to find in this bloody house, in this bloody order, which is not mine.</p><p>And which isn’t yours either, Remus.</p><p>I play distractedly with a lighter, like a moth attracted to that flame, insignificant and full of charm.</p><p>It’s that fire that has extinguished long ago inside me, extinguished by the cold of Azkaban, suffocated by the walls of this house, freezing like never before.</p><p>I’ve missed your warmth, you know that. As I know I don’t deserve it anymore, I’m not even worthy of looking you in the eyes for what I’m doing to myself.</p><p>There has been a time where you and I used to hide, and yet we were always together. Now we’re lightyears apart, and I hide even from myself, so that I don’t have to look in the mirror, that I don’t have to catch on my face the signs of a gradual but constant ruin.</p><p>And now that I mirror in your eyes, I see all I’ve escaped from.</p><p>You’re brutal, Remus, and you don’t even know it.</p><p>I consume myself, and you can do nothing but stay there and watch.</p><p>Because you’ll always be the one to pay for my mistakes.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>You’d be happy now.</p><p>Now that you’ve escaped the imprisonment of Grimmauld Place, now that you’d be watching me, with your devilish smile, laughing of my weakness, so horribly human.</p><p>You’ve found your freedom, Sirius. The one you’ve always wanted, and that I have never been able to give to you. I’ve always bounded you to my choices, to my shy behaviour, to all that love that I’ve never been able to express.</p><p>And now, when that very same love should lay underground, I feel it running in my veins, alive like never before.</p><p>Now that you’re not her, now that I can’t see your eyes, to read inside them like one of my loved and useless books.</p><p>I’ve got in my hands your flask. I look at it, mindful of all the issues it’s witness of, created mine, resolved yours.</p><p>I open it, slowly, and I drink.</p><p>I’d like to say I’m disgusted by what I’m doing, that it’s a childish gesture, that it won’t loose the knots that chain my soul tight to your memory but, I don’t know why, it sounds a lot like rubbish.</p><p>I drink, and I like what I feel.</p><p>I like the confusion, I like the weight of my eyelids, closing my eyes and seeing nothing but your face.</p><p>You were right, Sirius. And I’ve realized it only now.</p><p>Enjoy your freedom, for I’m still in chains.</p><p>Not for long.</p></div>
