    <p>Harry sat back on his stool, everyone else had already gone home hours ago, but he’d pulled the proverbial short straw and was now waiting for the last client of the day, or rather the night. Evening appointments weren’t especially rare, after all, their clients, typically, had busy lives, but still, seven was the latest appointment time, particularly for a full suit fitting – those tended to take a good couple of hours when done properly. </p><p>He sighed and glanced down at the name in the ledger again: <em>Riddle</em>, no first name, and no other identifier, not that that was uncommon amongst their more high-end clientele. The name in itself meant nothing to Harry, but the owners of this shop were keen on it, and by extension the man it belonged to, and they had told him to ‘be <em>accommodating</em> to his needs.’</p><p>So, he was probably a decently ranked politician with just enough power to have it go to his ego, which didn’t fill Harry with much hope of enjoying this appointment. In his experiences, politicians tended to either be pompous and dull, or witty and conceited; neither of which were pleasant to be around for long stretches of time. Both types always talked of their own achievements too much and never lifted their arms right, but they willingly paid the exorbitant prices that contributed to Harry’s generous salary, so he was professional and courteous, even if he wasn’t friendly. </p><p>Without really thinking, Harry glanced over at the clock, mounted on the wall, again. It was one minute to seven, and the second-hand clicked around the circular face rhythmically; Harry found himself tapping his fingers to the same beat and waiting patiently for the strike of the hour. When it came. The musical tune that accompanied it drowned out the tinkling of the bell above the door, and the first indication that Harry got that he was no longer alone, was a dark shadow spreading over the pale pages of the ledger. </p><p>He jerked his head up, “oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t – ” Harry stopped as soon as his eyes focussed in on the man that was now standing on the other side of the reception desk because no one had warned him that the man was going to be that <em>handsome</em>. The gold hues of the antique chandelier lights that lit the ground floor brought out all the warm undertones in his skin, and the rich, earthy, tones in his eyes. The man smiled and Harry felt his mouth dry up, as though he was suddenly lying under a desert sun. </p><p>“Riddle?” he managed to choke out. </p><p>The man smiled again and dipped his head. “Yes,” he replied, his tone soft, and almost sultry, though perhaps that was just Harry’s active imagination; there was undertone too to his voice, something rough and uncultivated as though that sharp accent had been meticulously learnt, and was not, in fact, a natural sound on his tongue. Harry wanted to hear it more, to listen to the way Riddle wrapped his tongue around each and every letter of the English language.</p><p>“And you are?” Riddle prompted after they’d stood there in silence for a good twenty seconds too long. Anyone else might have got flustered by the obvious attention and unabashed staring that Harry was doing, but Riddle just held his gaze; albeit with an eyebrow raised and a smile spreading from the corner of his mouth. Clearly, he was a man who knew how good he looked. </p><p>It took Harry several more seconds to process that he’d been asked a question. “Oh yes, I’m sorry – again – umm.” He swallowed and shook his head trying to find his brain somewhere inside. “Harry,” he managed eventually, “I’m Harry; it’s a pleasure to meet you,” as he said it, he stuck his hand out and Riddle took it in his own; his palm was warm and dry, and the skin was smooth because the people who came here never worked with their hands. When Riddle let go, Harry’s hand stayed, empty and cold, and suspended, hanging in the arm for a moment too long because, apparently, his brain had been disconnected from his motor functions.</p><p>Another stretching silence spilled out between them as Harry found himself distracted again, this time by the way that the shadows fell into Riddle’s hair, and showed every styled curl to absolute, sickening, perfection. And, for a moment, Harry was glad he hadn’t pursued his childhood dream of joining the Aurors, because if he had, he was sure he’d have had to arrest Riddle for a public indecency offence; after all, it <em>was</em> indecent of him to look like that without even trying. </p><p>Riddle just continued to coolly observe him, his head tilted back a fraction and his eyebrow still raised, though his mouth said he was more amused than annoyed by the entire affair, for it was curved upward into half a smile. The very picture of elegance and self-confidence, a poise that few men possessed but Harry had always found <em>essential</em> when wearing a truly striking suit. </p><p>“Well,” Riddle said, letting his eyes linger at Harry’s throat as he spoke, “are you going to invite me upstairs, Harry?” he continued, leaning in with what must have been his signature smile, “or do I have to strip for you right here?”</p><p>At that Harry nearly choked on his own saliva, already feeling an embarrassing flush creeping up from under his collar. It wasn’t, of course, the first time that a client had spoken to him in a tone that danced the line of provocativeness, but it was certainly the most audacious. The others were subtle and restrained, reticent even, and they certainly didn’t say anything before their clothes were off. But Riddle wasn’t being elusive in the slightest, and he just continued to smile, the tip of his tongue visible between his teeth.</p><p>The casualness of it all made Harry stumble with his words, “yes,” he said, “I mean no, I mean – ” He sighed, “just follow me – please” he said eventually, already half-defeated and he hadn’t even had a proper look at Riddle yet. Though he ticked that box as soon as he slid off his stool and walked around the reception desk. It was a subtle glance Harry would have liked to think, and one that made him swallowed again, hard this time. </p><p>The suit Riddle was currently wearing must have already been tailored, at least, Harry hoped it was because no one had any right to look that good in an off-the-rack suit, especially one in such a nondescript shade of grey. The exact titanium colour of which that he <em>could</em> wear because he could wear anything and look good, though Harry couldn’t help but think he’d look better in something earthier; something almost brutal in its colouring, something like carmine or maybe sangria. </p><p>Well, there was only one way of finding out, one that involved going upstairs to the private fitting rooms and becoming intimately acquainted with every inch of Riddle’s body, which, by the looks of it was going to be a far more agreeable task than Harry had ever thought it would be. He swallowed again and raised his gaze to meet with Riddle’s, before gesturing for him to follow him up the stairs.</p>
