  <span>“That tickles,” Luna murmured sleepily.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Morning,” Ginny said, kissing her knee. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She didn’t stop rubbing Luna’s legs. Luna always said it tickled but she never pulled away, and sometimes she pouted when Ginny stopped. Ginny was onto her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Luna hummed in response and kept her eyes closed, but she stuck more of her leg out of the blankets. Shameless.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ginny smiled and kept running her fingers through her leg hair, rubbing circles and delighting in the soft tickle of hair against her fingers.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was strange to remember she’d once thought it odd that Luna never shaved, now she loved it. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We should get up and have breakfast,” she said, tickling behind Luna’s knee.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Luna’s knee jerked and she made a grumbling sound. “Not yet.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright,” Ginny said, letting her fingers drift back to Luna’s calf. “Five more minutes.”</span>
