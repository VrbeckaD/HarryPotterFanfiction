          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story begins in Fred and Hermione Weasley's house, it's Rose Weasley's first Halloween trick or treating.</p><p>Fred told her, "You don't want the treats, Rosie. The tricks are much more fun."</p><p>Hermione sighed. "Freddie, you can't tell her that!"</p><p>Fred smirked. "Why not? She's my daughter too which means she's half trickster."</p><p>Hermione said, "And half not."</p><p>Rose smiled. "It's okay, mum. I can handle myself. Auntie Ginny taught me a spell or two that might come in handy."</p><p>Fred chuckled. "Gin is crazy teaching a six year old magic!"</p><p>Hermione beamed, "Well, she's clearly got my brains."</p><p>Fred retorted, "Hey! I heard that!"</p><p>Rose rolled her eyes and asked, "Can we go make some mischief?"</p><p>Hermione nodded and added, "And get some treats too."</p><p>Fred whispered in Rose's ear, "As long as you do more tricks when Mione isn't looking."</p><p>Rose grinned mischievously. "Ok, dad."</p></div>
