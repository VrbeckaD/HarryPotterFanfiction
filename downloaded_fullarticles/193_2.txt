    <p> </p><p>“Move your butt,” </p><p> </p><p>The whisper is harsh in the midnight quiet, nimble fingers prodding against Alec’s back, painful in their waking endeavour; still, he rolls over, tucking his feet beneath his knees, jolted by the dip of the mattress as Magnus sinks down beside him. </p><p> </p><p>Alec waits, until Magnus has stopped moving, until he seems relatively calm, before rolling over to face him. The edges of his face are sharpened by the moonlight drifting through the curtains, shadows backlighting his nose and ears, casting a shine on the creases below his eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“Couldn’t sleep.” Magnus mumbles, hand curled beneath his chin. </p><p> </p><p>“Bad dream?” Alec asks, swallowing past his dry throat. It’s not the first time that Magnus has snuck into his bed, hardly the first time it’s happened since they came to Lily’s farm almost a week ago, but it’s still something that worries him.</p><p> </p><p>“Something like that,” Magnus blinks, eyes wide under the night’s glow. “Just, something feels off, I couldn’t settle down enough to sleep. Is this okay? Because I can leave-“</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Alec scoots closer, reaching for Magnus’ shoulder. “No, you don’t have to leave. I’d never kick you out, you know that.”</p><p> </p><p>Magnus hums, pulling his knees up until he’s curled up into a tight ball. Alec frowns, pressing his thumb to the joint of Magnus’ shoulder. “Hey,” He whispers, voice as low as the night requires. “Do you want to talk about it?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Magnus pouts, tucking his chin against his chest. “Maybe.” He amends, a second later. </p><p> </p><p>Alec moves his hand, until it’s covering Magnus’ knuckles. “I’ll listen if you want to. Otherwise, I can pretend to snore really obnoxiously so that it feels like you’re back at Hogwarts?”</p><p> </p><p>Magnus laughs, a tiny sound that seems to burst forth without his awareness, but it’s a sound that Alec is grateful to hear. Being away from Magnus over the summer was hard, it always is, but seeing Magnus distressed with no way to help is quite possibly harder. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t even remember it,” Magnus whispers, keeping his gaze cast down. “The dream. The nightmare. There was just, a lot of darkness, everywhere, I couldn’t move or touch anything, it’s like I was floating but I couldn’t see anything and it was – it was suffocating.” </p><p> </p><p>“Magnus-“</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not new to having nightmares, but there was something different about this one.” Magnus lifts his head, at such an angle that the outside light reflects the tear stains on his cheeks. “I’m – I feel scared, Alec. It was just a figment of my imagination, I know this, I know that I can’t get hurt from a dream but … I can’t shake it off, either.”</p><p> </p><p>Alec lifts his hand, using his thumb to wipe off the tears on Magnus’ cheeks. “Hey, hey, listen, it’s okay,  everything’s okay. It’s okay that you feel like that, but I promise, <em> you’re </em> also okay. You’re safe, the nightmares can’t get you here.”</p><p> </p><p>Magnus tucks his head against the knob of Alec’s shoulder, hands lacing with Alec’s. “I always feel safe around you,” He murmurs, sniffling. “This was the first place I thought of when I woke up, you – you always know how to make me feel better.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s what best friends are for,” Alec replies, voice breaking off at the end, his own tears choking up; Magnus is always so strong, so put-together, so fearless. It’s not a surprise, that he trusts Alec, just that Alec is the first Magnus thinks of. </p><p> </p><p>He presses a kiss to Magnus’ forehead, the way he would when Isabelle had a nightmare – the only experience he really has with supporting people coming out of bad dreams, is the times when his sister was little, and determined that the monsters in the cupboard were trying to squeeze under her bed. </p><p> </p><p>“You’ll be okay, Magnus.” He doesn’t know if it’s a bad idea, to promise something he can’t really guarantee, but he wants to do what he can to make Magnus feel better, and reassurance is as good as anything else.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course I will,” Magnus mumbles, closing his eyes, his head resting against Alec’s. “I’ve got you to protect me from the monsters in the shadows.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>It’s not the sun that wakes them, nor the obnoxious rooster, Arthur, that Lily had warned them all to be wary of. </p><p> </p><p>No; it is, in fact, Lily herself, who storms into the room the way she’s known to, muck boots heavy against the hardwood floor, pulling them from sleep with a loud, and arguably affectionate <em> “ </em> <em> cows don’t feed themselves, Lightwood”.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Magnus pops his head up from beneath the covers, Alec’s knobby elbow digging into his stomach. Alec snores on, unaware of Lily’s intention to wake him and the situation she’s come to find him in. </p><p> </p><p>“You know, Magnus, we do have a room for you, too. Lightwood is a big boy, you don’t have to be attached at the hip all twenty four hours of the day.”</p><p> </p><p>Magnus pulls himself up, an amused smile tugging at the corner of his mouth when Alec grunts and flops onto his back. “I missed him,” Magnus states, not altogether dishonest. </p><p> </p><p>He doesn’t mention the nightmares, figures it’s easier to let Lily think they’re just annoyingly close, like Simon and Clary, like everyone else thinks.</p><p> </p><p>There’s something calculating to her gaze, though, which makes him wonder if Lily can see more than she lets on. </p><p> </p><p>“Breakfast is in twenty,” She states, letting her arms fall to her sides. “I’ll take care of the cows.”</p><p> </p><p>Lily looks between them both, and then departs the room; there’s something about her gaze, something unspoken. Perhaps Magnus is just reading too much into it, but for a moment, it’s almost as though she’s saying <em> ‘I’ll look after the cows - you look after him’. </em></p><p> </p><p>As though Alec is the one that needs to be coddled from nightmares.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Magnus heads to his room, feet darting quickly across the floor, the cold air nipping at his bare arms. He’d forgotten a jumper in his midnight move, hadn’t considered how cold the morning would be, before the sun had gotten a chance to even pretend it could do anything. </p><p> </p><p>The sun is barely poking above the horizon as it is, bright and lethargic in nature, but Magnus has never seen it as clear as he does from his bedroom window, and he thinks if nothing else, this can be a highlight of the trip. </p><p> </p><p>The countryside is beautiful, without the incessant smog of the city, even if Magnus thinks he’d find the small-town-quiet suffocating after a while. </p><p> </p><p>He tugs on old jeans, tattered at the knees, shoving the cuffs into mud-streaked boots that Lily had let him borrow for the trip. He throws on a shirt he can’t remember buying and a jumper with the sleeves stretched to fit over his hands. Summer should mean less layers, but he doesn’t like even a degree of cold and the tip of his nose is already itching with the threat of a sneeze. </p><p> </p><p>Alec is awake when he sneaks back into the room, or well, he’s trying to be; his fists fall from his eyes as Magnus shuts the door behind himself, nothing more than a second lasting before he’s grinning, equal parts bright and cautious. </p><p> </p><p>“G’morning,” Alec mumbles, raking a hand through his bird’s nest of hair. “How did you sleep?”</p><p> </p><p>Magnus is grateful that ‘did you sleep’ isn’t where Alec took the question. </p><p> </p><p>“Utterly dreamless.” Magnus states, crossing the distance between them before flopping backwards on the bed, his head falling somewhere near Alec’s knee. “It was perfect.”</p><p> </p><p>Alec reaches out, tangling his fingers in the ends of Magnus’ hair, longer now than it had been the last time they had seen each other, and soft too, fingers bumping against Magnus’ skull. It eases a pressure Magnus hadn’t even been aware was building. </p><p> </p><p>“And how are you feeling now?” Alec asks. It was a little naive of Magnus to think he could dodge the question, and it’s fine, Alec cares a lot, it’s just - a hard question to be faced with. </p><p> </p><p>He’d never lie to Alec, can’t bear the thought of it, but sometimes, he can’t even explain to himself how he’s feeling. </p><p> </p><p>“Better than I would have been if I had of stayed in my room.”</p><p> </p><p>Alec hums, fingers still running through Magnus’ hair. “Maybe you should just stay with me for the rest of the trip.” He pauses, once the words are out, hands stilling atop Magnus’ head.</p><p> </p><p>Magnus holds his breath, hoping that Alec won’t change his mind. Everything's better when Alec is around. It’s a fact of the universe. </p><p> </p><p>“If you want,” Alec whispers, after a moment. “I don’t want to pressure you, so long as you’re comfortable and happy, that - that is what matters.”</p><p> </p><p>Magnus rolls over, so that he can look at Alec; there’s a hesitation to Alec’s smile that speaks of nerves, but nothing in his eyes that says he doesn’t understand what he’s suggesting. </p><p> </p><p>“Guess you’re stuck with me, then.”</p><p> </p><p>Alec shakes his head, something settling in his smile. “You say that as though it is a bad thing.”</p><p> </p><p>Magnus doesn’t say anything, just lets his eyes slip closed, letting Alec’s surety wash over him. </p><p> </p><p>“I can’t think of anything better.” Alec adds, because he can, because he has to have the last say. </p><p> </p><p>This time, Magnus lets him.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Magnus doesn’t think he’ll ever get over the quantity of food available at meal times, not even into his second week here. </p><p> </p><p>There’s a big, polished wooden six-seater table laid out with an insane spread of breakfast foods, buttered toast and pancakes with syrup and all manners of fruit and jams, bacon that’s perfectly crispy and eggs both scrambled and fried. Lily’s family enlist the best of their own products, but the proportions will never cease to amaze Magnus. </p><p> </p><p>If the food is always this good, he could get used to this farm life business; perhaps, without all of the mud and guck, though. He could do without the mess, and the smell. </p><p> </p><p>God, the smell of animals is not something a city boy will ever get used to, he’s learnt that much from this experience. </p><p> </p><p>(He hasn’t given in to a side of the country vs city debate yet, preferring to skirt around the edges where it’s safe - the last thing he needs is for Lily to smash an egg on his head or something. Devil’s advocate is his playing field.)</p><p> </p><p>He’s only just started digging into the tower of food before him when Alec shuffles over, wrapped in one of Magnus’ house jumpers. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, hey Sleeping Beauty.” Lily waves, almost knocking her younger brother Elliot in the head. Magnus hides a grin behind a piece of toast, considering absently that it wouldn’t be surprising if Lily intended to hit her brother, and simply missed. “It’s nice to see you’ve made the decision to join us this fine morning.”</p><p> </p><p>Alec shrugs, dropping onto the seat next to Magnus. “It didn’t seem to fair to keep you waiting any longer. Plus the smell is amazing.”</p><p> </p><p>Magnus shuffles over to give Alec more room, glancing at him slyly before plucking at his sleeve. “I love this sweater,” He grins. “Looks good on you.” </p><p> </p><p>Alec raises a tired eyebrow. “Perhaps you should get one of your own.”</p><p> </p><p>Magnus inclines his head. “Oh is that it how it is?”</p><p> </p><p>Alec stares back defiantly. Across the table, Lily taps her fork sharply against the table. “We do have an entire farm to pitch in on, guys, in case you’ve forgotten.We don’t exactly have time to dawdle around - even if Alec seems to be considering joining the superior house.”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t choose Hufflepuff, Lily.” Alec pulls the sleeves of Magnus’ jumper down over his hands. “It - chose me.”</p><p> </p><p>Lily shakes her head. “A true shame.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Alec is grateful he changed - into an old <em> Weird Sisters </em> shirt and a tattered pair of overalls that Lily altered to fit his size - because after ten minutes in a pen he’s already splattered almost head to toe with mud. </p><p> </p><p>It’s entirely worth it. </p><p> </p><p>“What’s this one’s name?” He asks Elliot, kneeling in the mud with a hand carefully outstretched towards a spotted pink piglet. </p><p> </p><p>“Newt.” Elliot grins, the gap of his toothy smile reminding Alec that he’s only seven, barely older than Max. “I named him.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a great name,” Alec smiles over his shoulder. “Like Newt Scamander?” </p><p> </p><p>Elliot nods. “Lily let me borrow one of her books on his magical creatures.”</p><p> </p><p>“He’s one of my favourite wizards.” Alec admits, letting Newt the Piglet sniff his fingers, the touch tickling his skin. “Do you have a favourite magical creature?”</p><p> </p><p>Elliot nods enthusiastically. “I like dragons! They breathe fire and have wings and can fly.”</p><p> </p><p>“Did you know that Olivander, the wandmaker, uses dragon heartstrings in his wands sometimes?”</p><p> </p><p>Elliot’s eyes widen. “No! That’s so cool! I hope my wand has dragon heartstring in it.” </p><p> </p><p>Alec glances at Newt the Piglet, who’s still sniffing his hand. “I could be wrong, but I’m pretty sure that it will. Wands choose their owners, you know?”</p><p> </p><p>If Elliot’s eyes widen any further, they’d likely bug out of his face. “Wands are so cool!”</p><p> </p><p>Alec nods. “Even cooler once you know how to use them.”</p><p> </p><p>“So long as you don’t lose or break them,” Magnus announces, skirting the edge of the pig pen. “Making new friends, Alec?”</p><p> </p><p>“His name is Newt,” Elliot exclaims.”I named him!”</p><p> </p><p>Alec’s reply is cut off when Newt sniffs his wrists, shucking mud up to splatter his cheek; laughter bubbles up his throat like sparks of magic falling from a wand and he has no intention of stopping it. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think this is quite what they meant by ‘muggle mud facials’,” Magnus quips, folding his arms atop the edge of the pen. “But it’s nice to see you doing stuff without magic.”</p><p> </p><p>“I would sit in a pen of pud with Newt over taking a potions lesson <em> any day </em>.” Alec exclaims. Newt snorts in response. Alec takes it as support. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t let me stop your fun.” Magnus waves his fingers. “I’m off to collect eggs. Lily has put me on gathering duty.” He lifts his other hand, from which swings a small wicker basket. </p><p> </p><p>“Have fun.” Alec smiles, because he has to, because it’s Magnus and he looks more excited to collect eggs than he did every tutoring session. </p><p> </p><p>It seems there’s fun for them both here. Lily is practically going to break out into a dance when she finds out they’re both leaning towards the country side of the debate. </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>“How does it feel to know you’re going to be the youngest Hufflepuff to join the team since the last winning House Captain, <em> Julian Blackthorn </em>?” </p><p> </p><p>Alec wraps his arms around his torso. When Lily had suggested they practise some Quidditch drills, he’d been under the impression it was for fun. He didn’t think she’d start on him like this. “We don’t know that. Julian needed me for the last game because a Gryffindor hexed his chaser. Besides, he’s not even Captain anymore, I’m pretty sure Jem is. Who knows what’s going to happen this year?”</p><p> </p><p>“Alec.” Lily frowns. “Julian brought you onto the team for the last game of the season, and you <em> won </em> . You did that. Yes, it was a team effort but <em> you </em> were <em> on </em>that team.”</p><p> </p><p>“Look,” Magnus lifts his head from his copy of <em> ’A Standard Book of Spells’ </em>. “I have a very bare minimum understanding of this game. I still don’t understand how Will thinks that I’ll be able to match his commentary once he’s gone.”</p><p> </p><p>Magnus’ gaze softens, and he’s staring at Alec like he can see <em> through </em> him. </p><p> </p><p>“But I know you, Alec. I know how hard you work, at everything you do, and I know how important Quidditch is to you, how <em> passionate </em> you are. I am certain that Hufflepuff would not have won that match without your support. I am just as certain that Julian wouldn’t have helped you train, nor looked at you like you were a miracle when you accepted his offer to play, if you weren’t good enough.” </p><p> </p><p>Alec chews nervously at his bottom lip, curling his fingers around his elbow. “But Julian is gone. Yes, he taught me a lot, and I still can’t believe I got to play a winning game - but that isn’t any indication of what’s going to happen this year.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s okay to believe in yourself just a little, Alec.” Lily says, knocking her shoulder against Alec’s. “Even if you don’t get on the team this year-”</p><p> </p><p>“Which you will!” Magnus interrupts, as though it’s a given.</p><p> </p><p>Lily nods in his direction, and then turns back to Alec. “Even in the very unlikely situation that you won’t make it to the team, they can’t be that stupid as to not have you as a substitute. And there’s nothing saying you can’t keep practising for the fun of it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Isn’t that the point,” Magnus waves his hand vaguely. “Of all this sports nonsense?”</p><p> </p><p>“Having fun?” Alec smiles despite himself. “Generally yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Magnus shrugs. “Never been my thing.”</p><p> </p><p>Lily frowns. ”Never? Not even muggle sports?”</p><p> </p><p>Magnus shakes his head, something of a shadow falling across his eyes. “Never been a big fan of it. Probably doesn’t help that the older kids at the orphanage used to ‘accidentally’ hit me with the popular ball of that week. Never enough to cause real damage, of course, but definitely enough for a few bruises.”</p><p>“Magnus,” Alec’s hands fall to his sides. “I’m - I had no idea. I’m so sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>Magnus shrugs, folding the cover of the textbook. “It’s not something that I advertise. I got used to it, learnt how to get out of the road - I’m quite good at dodgeball, ironically, though I don’t particularly enjoy it.”</p><p> </p><p>He laughs, but it’s frail, and his smile doesn’t quite reach his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Magnus,” Alec can’t seem to form anything else. Magnus has been through so much - so much <em> bullshit </em>, but he just brushes it off, like it was all nothing, like it never happened. </p><p> </p><p>He’s so, so strong, but he acts as though none of it matters. He doesn’t see himself the way Alec does, but not because he doesn’t want to - because he genuinely can’t see what Alec does. </p><p> </p><p>It breaks Alec’s heart.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to check that Elliot hasn’t trapped himself in the chook pen.” Lily says, glancing between the two of them. “Don’t start the drills without me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Alec replies, his voice sounding thin to his own ears.</p><p> </p><p>He drops down next to Magnus, a little thrilled at the newfound ease - everything is so carefree here, so removed from fuss and pomposity. It’s a literal and metaphysical breath of fresh air. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry you went through that.” Alec bumps his shoulder against Magnus’. “I know your childhood was - far from the best, but I never thought-”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s fine.” Magnus shrugs. “Well, it’s not, but it’s in the past. The orphanage is - nothing like it used to be, and I spend most of the year at Hogwarts anyway.”</p><p> </p><p>Alec isn’t sure if Hogwarts is entirely all that better, with Sebastian and all of his personal vendettas, but Magnus has proven that he’s twice as bold and thrice as strong as Sebastian could ever hope to be, and if he thinks so highly of the school, Alec is certainly not going to bring up anything contradicting. </p><p> </p><p>Magnus tips his head, letting it fall to rest against Alec’s shoulder. “I always used to hear things, about how it could never possibly be that bad, because it’s always going to get better. I had trouble believing it, which has always seemed fair to me - my parents are dead, my family didn’t want me and few at the orphanage really cared enough to give me a second glance if I couldn’t be used as an object of their own sport.”</p><p> </p><p>He doesn’t sound sad, though tears are threatening to brim in Alec’s eyes, just - resigned. As though this is nothing more than facts that he’s long since accepted. </p><p> </p><p>Magnus sighs, his hair tickling the underside of Alec’s chin. “But then I went to Hogwarts, and I discovered that magic exists, that <em> I </em> have it. I learnt how to fly, even if I’m not the best at it, and made some amazing friends.” He glances up, his gaze soft but hopeful. “I met you.”</p><p> </p><p>Alec can hardly blink. “I love my siblings, and I love the other guys-” </p><p> </p><p>He’s reminded, suddenly and somewhat inopportunely, of all the times that Magnus has been there for him; when he snuck into the Hufflepuff common room and brought Alec hot chocolate, refusing to leave even though Alec was putting distance between them; when he came to Alec before the Quidditch game because Alec got cold feet, and Magnus knew he’d regret it - and every little moment in between. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re the best friend I never thought I’d have,” Alec whispers. </p><p> </p><p>Magnus smiles, so wide his cheeks flush pink, and then he tucks his head against Alec’s neck, and they just sit there, under a sky bluer than a pixie, with the sun soothingly warm over them. </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>“Won’t see the stars this bright in the city, huh?” </p><p> </p><p>Alec unfolds the plaid blanket that Lily had let them borrow, spreading it on the curve of a hill only a few metres from the main house. Lily had also stocked them with pumpkin juice and a fresh batch of apple pie which her mother had baked and insisted upon them including.</p><p> </p><p>It’s one of their last nights, before the little farm bubble they find themselves in pops and Hogwarts winds back around, and Magnus had asked Lily if they’d be able to spend a night outside, because the clear sky is not something either Alec nor Magnus are used to. </p><p> </p><p>“They’re beautiful,” Magnus has his neck craned above him, as though this is the first time he’s ever seen stars.</p><p> </p><p>Alec keeps his smile to himself, plopping down on the blanket, the bag of goods settled beside him - the apple pie smells like something straight out of Hogwarts’ kitchens, which is to say, it smells utterly <em> magical </em>. </p><p> </p><p>“They’re nothing like this in the city.” Magnus whispers, awestruck. He glances at Alec, eyes sparkling like stars themselves. “Even at Hogwarts, the sky is always shrouded in this mystery but here? Everything is so clear and beautiful.”</p><p> </p><p>Alec’s smile widens. “Yeah, it’s - beautiful.” </p><p> </p><p>Truthfully, Alec isn’t as enrapt with the stars as Magnus is - they are beautiful, that’s indisputable, but Alec is just glad to see Magnus so happy. He’d spend every night under the stars if it meant Magnus would smile like that. </p><p> </p><p>“You know, I used to spend hours looking at the stars - what I could of them.” Magnus admits, folding down next to Alec. “I wondered what it was like to be one of them - to be up there. Seems like the perfect view to watch the world spin away.”</p><p> </p><p>“Distant,” Alec admits. </p><p> </p><p>Magnus nods. “<em> Removed </em>. That’s what I liked about it so much. Whatever was going on here didn’t matter if I could be up there. If I could escape. The Muggles, they have a whole organisation dedicated to space travel - I thought I could do that. Be an astronaut. Make my way to the moon, and just - never come back down.” </p><p> </p><p>“Astronaut,” Alec repeats, mulling over the word. It doesn’t sound like a bad job. Travelling through space. </p><p> </p><p>“Then I discovered I had magic.” Magnus shrugs. “It’s a little cooler than being an astronaut. But only a little bit.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve found out that you can do anything with the right spell and practice,” Alec frowns. “That <em> unicorns </em> and other magical creatures actually exist, that most of the fairytales you were told about as a kid are real - and there’s a part of you that would still rather go to the moon?”</p><p> </p><p>Magnus mulls over Alec’s question, then shoots him an exaggerated wink. “I mean, it’s the moon, Alexander. And besides, who said that I can’t do both? Might be easier to go to space as a wizard, anyway.” </p><p> </p><p>“Never let anyone tell you that your dreams are not achievable.” Alec states. </p><p> </p><p>Magnus reaches for the bag, opening it to pull out a bottle each of pumpkin juice. “Of course not. If they did, I’d just strive to prove them wrong. Stubborness is a productive trait, you know.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not even going to attempt to argue that,” Alec says, taking one of the juices from Magnus, with an added, quieter “thanks”. </p><p> </p><p>Magnus watches, pensive, as Alec pulls the apple pie from the bag, setting it atop the blanket. “You’ve never wanted to see the stars? To escape?”</p><p> </p><p>“Those are two different things for me.” Alec points out. He turns his gaze upward, to the stars that don’t quite shine as bright as the other ones. “I never had the same attraction towards the stars as you do, but escaping?”</p><p> </p><p>Alec’s hands wring together in his lap before him, his pumpkin juice resting idly near the pie. “Knowing that I was going to Hogwarts once I hit the right age, that was my dream escape. Getting to craft my magic, hone it into a skill worth something, to be around other kids like me - I love my siblings, I do. I’d do anything for them. But being in that house was suffocating.” </p><p> </p><p>Magnus sighs, and wraps his hand around Alec’s arm - he knows what feeling suffocated is like. “Now you’ve got two-out-of-three siblings at Hogwarts with you, and of course, me.”</p><p> </p><p>Alec lets his head fall against Magnus’ shoulder. “Well, you’re clearly the best part.” He acknowledges, shifting closer to Magnus. “I’ll be sure to tell Isabelle and Jace that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Please do.” </p><p> </p><p>Alec laughs softly, the sound reverberating through them both. Magnus tucks a smile against the top of Alec’s head. “I suppose there are other good things, to Hogwarts.”</p><p> </p><p>“More than just you, my siblings and I’m presuming our friends?” Magnus can practically see Alec’s grin, even without catching true sight of it. “Do tell.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well,” Magnus thinks back to the last Quidditch game. “There was Julian - must have been nice to see him around all the time.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure,” Alec clears his throat. “I mean, he’s a really talented Quidditch player and he’s taught me a lot - it’s going to suck that he’s not there anymore.”</p><p> </p><p>“Did you-” Magnus inhales sharply. “Like him? <em> Like </em> him <em> , </em>I mean.”</p><p><br/>
</p><p>It’s a daring question to ask - if this was the orphanage, Magnus would be ducking to avoid a punch in the face right about now. Magnus is pretty certain Alec wouldn’t hurt him, but there’s a coil of tension running through his shoulders and he regrets even opening his mouth. </p><p> </p><p>Alec stills. “Are you asking if I had a crush on him?”</p><p> </p><p>Magnus doesn’t reply, but his silence speaks loud enough. </p><p> </p><p>Alec sighs, tucking his head closer against Magnus’ shoulder. “I think so. I think I did. I don’t know. I’ve never had a crush before, I don’t know what the signs are, but I mean - I like him. I think he’s a really cool person. He’s nice, and he’s caring, and he always saw the best in me, and supported me from the first day, he’s never been rude, not to anyone-“</p><p> </p><p>Alec’s head tips forward slightly. “I thought I just looked up to him. But maybe it was more than that. Maybe I did have a crush on him. Do? Does it count if he’s not around anymore?”</p><p> </p><p>Magnus squeezes Alec’s upper arm, taking a moment to swallow past his dry throat; there’s a tiny voice piping up from the back of his mind, about feelings he’d pushed aside and whether this means Alec might be the same - whatever that might be. </p><p> </p><p>He kindly tells that voice to shut up because it’s not the time.</p><p> </p><p>“A crush counts so long as it exists. It doesn’t matter if the person is around, it matters how you feel when you think of them, or when you see them, or - when they talk to you. A crush is how you see it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then,” Alec sighs. “Yeah. Yes. I guess I do, have a crush on Julian.”</p><p> </p><p>Magnus fights back a good-natured laugh at how annoyed with himself Alec sounds - not, he thinks, because he has a crush, but because he didn’t realise it before Magnus brought it up.</p><p> </p><p>It makes braving the question seem worth it.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t blame you,” Magnus admits. “He’s pretty cute. His hair is really nice.”</p><p> </p><p>Magnus doesn’t want to delve too deeply into what him thinking that might mean - it’s difficult enough to admit it aloud, and besides, this isn’t supposed to be about him. This is about helping his best friend, about <em> being there </em> for Alec when Alec needs him.</p><p> </p><p>Alec takes a second too long to reply. “Nice eyes, too.”</p><p> </p><p>Magnus replies around his smile, unable to help himself. “Yes, nice eyes too. I don’t have a crush on him, mind you, but I can see why you would. Not a bad guy to have a first crush on.”</p><p> </p><p>If Alec notices his voice croaking a little on the pronoun, he’s kind enough not to mention it.</p><p> </p><p>Alec tilts his head slightly, to make eye contact with Magnus. “Who was the first person you had a crush on?”</p><p> </p><p>“A muggle,” Magnus whispers exaggeratedly, like it’s a secret, a conspiracy. Like he and Alec are two super spies in an action film franchise, not two teenage wizards trying to figure themselves out. </p><p> </p><p>Alec elbows Magnus in the side, not enough to bruise but enough to make an impact. ”I’m serious, Magnus.”</p><p> </p><p>“Her name was Nadine.” Magnus admits. “It was only a few months before I found out I was, you know, <em> magical </em> and everything. She was a few years older, but she was one of the few who actually spoke to me. We weren’t friends at all, but she was nice, and much like Julian she had very nice hair, and - I felt happy, when I saw her around.”</p><p> </p><p>“She sounds nice.” </p><p> </p><p>Magnus would shrug, if Alec weren’t leaning on him. “She was. But, she’s not at the orphanage anymore, and most of the time neither am I.”</p><p> </p><p>“So you don’t have a crush at the moment?” Alec asks, curiously.</p><p> </p><p>Magnus shakes his head. “Not currently, no. But who knows what the future holds?”</p><p> </p><p>Alec hums. “For you? Something amazing I’m sure.”</p><p> </p><p>Magnus curls his hand around Alec’s elbow, pressing a kiss to the top of Alec’s head. “So long as it includes you, Alexander. <em> That </em>would make it amazing.” </p><p> </p>
