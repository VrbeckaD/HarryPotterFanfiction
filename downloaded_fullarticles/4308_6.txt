    <p>In a crowd full of pure white togas, the god of death with his dark leather kilt and his scarred bare chest stood out like a wolf among sheep. Where the other gods wore gold and silver and pearls, Percival had a skull of a python on a chain hanging from his neck, the slight touch of grey in his black mane of hair the only silver he always carried in his person.</p><p>Dark like night, his eyes raked over the people gathered in the great hall of Mount Olympus before the dais of the high gods. Many he recognized from the crowd, gods and goddesses who had fought with him and Seraphina against Grindelwald when the world had still been young, but new gods had come to exist since and most of them Percival did not know.</p><p>He did not like <i>not knowing</i> and his displeasure showed on his face.</p><p>“No need to look quite so murderous,” said Seraphina from where she was sitting on his left, a wine goblet in her slender hand. There was a slight frown between her eyes, but otherwise she had arranged herself elegantly on her chair, her white toga with its gold accents a contrast to her dark skin. “I don’t need you scaring any of my guests away with your glaring.”</p><p>Percival looked at her, bewildered by the accusations.</p><p>“If I was glaring at someone, their skin would burst into flames," he pointed out. "Yet, no-one is on fire – therefore, I’m not glaring. I’m merely keeping my eyes open and watching my surroundings.”</p><p>He tapped his fingers against the smooth armrest of his chair, studying the people before him, doing his best to block out the salty smell of sea that floated to his nostrils from where the sea gods were chatting by the columns.</p><p>They were in the great hall of Mount Olympus, Seraphina and Percival, surrounded by a large crowd of gods and goddesses who kept sending Percival glances, something between grudging respect and fear, he didn’t care to observe closer which. As the goddess of the sky and the ruler of Mount Olympus, Seraphina had had the hall decorated with lightning lanterns, but Percival - busy with the internal matters of his realm - didn’t visit often enough to know whether the lanterns were always there or whether they had been put up just for the night, for <i>The Godly Gathering</i> Seraphina hosted on Mount Olympus once every few century.</p><p>Even though he tried to appreciate the effort it had taken for someone to decorate the hall, the style of the decorations made Percival slightly uncomfortable – he didn’t much care for the unreachable, for the sky looming above the world like the roof of a poorly pitched tent about to collapse, and – looking at the paintings of the Sun, the Moon and the stars on the walls, looking at the high pillars painted to look like rainbows – he couldn’t understand why anyone would want to have their home to look like the sky.</p><p>He should have stayed in his realm, Percival decided, a bitter taste in his mouth, he should have stayed <i>at home</i> overseeing the procedures of the souls of mortals being sent to their rightful destinations by The Three Judges, he should have been there to ensure that Grindelwald would remain imprisoned in the deepest pits of Tartarus, and if Tina had forgotten to feed Cerberus again while he was away, he would have her thrown in the River of Oblivion, his favorite Arae though she might have been.</p><p>“Be that as it may,” said Seraphina, cutting off his line of thought, “you could at least <i>try</i> to look a little more approachable. I’m almost out of wine – yet, the servants are too fearful to approach us to pour me more.”</p><p>Suddenly overly conscious of the way his goblet remained untouched on the table beside him, Percival frowned down at his his boots crossed at the ankles. He had promised himself he would drink after dancing, but even though the goddess of music was filling the hall with cheerful melodies, he hadn't yet danced. No-one had dared to approach him and the seven times he had left the dais to step closer to someone, they had run off, terrified, before he had had a chance to even greet them.</p><p>“It is hardly my fault,” Percival said, haughty, clenching his fists around the armrests of the chair, “if your servants are such cowards that they cannot withstand my looking in their way, that my proximity scares them from fulfilling their duties.”</p><p>Turning her gaze away from him in order to study her dancing, chatting guests, Seraphina let out a loud pointed sigh before drinking the last drops of her wine, looking then at the bottom of the empty goblet mournfully. She motioned for a young servant boy, the god of whistling, to come and fill her goblet – which he also did, trembling the whole time as he stared at Percival, eyes wide, doing his very best to stay as far away from him as physically possible as he poured Seraphina wine.</p><p>So very pitiful.</p><p>Percival sighed to himself, missing Cerberus and his pomegranate garden, annoyed that he had to waste his time with gods and goddesses who trembled at the sight of him even though he had never done anything to them (apart from occasionally taking some of them down to the fiery pits of Tartarus for eternal torment).</p><p>Why had he even bothered to attend this gathering?</p><p><i>Because you are lonely</i>, a voice instantly whispered in his ear. He had come here because he was lonely and he had hoped – hoped, <i>wished</i> – for a companionable evening.</p><p>Such wishful thinking.</p><p>He should have known better, Percival knew, angry with himself for feeling disappointed – he <i>should</i> have known better, he should have been wiser. He was feared, he knew that, had known it before coming here. His peers, other gods and goddesses, didn’t like having him in their midst.</p><p>He should have stayed at home, he thought, very much aware of the terrified looks the god of whistling kept on giving him like the boy was afraid he might strike him down at any given moment.</p><p>“You might underestimate it yourself, Percival,” Seraphina said once the god of whistling had hastily withdrawn having filled her goblet to the prim, “but you have always been naturally imposing, even before we defeated Grindelwald and divided the cosmos between us, even before you became the god of death.”</p><p>“That’s hardly a flaw, so don’t make it sound like one.”</p><p>She gave him an unimpressed look.</p><p>“I’m merely trying to tell you,” she went on carefully, “<i>as your friend</i>, that you hardly ever leave your realm and I only see you a couple of times a century, if that. It might do you some good to socialize more."</p><p>With whom, exactly?</p><p>Percival levelled her with a disbelieving look.</p><p>As it was, <i>Percival</i> wouldn’t have much minded socializing, occasionally, but most beings minded socializing with <i>him</i> which made socializing in general admittedly rather challenging to him, and it wasn’t helping any that Seraphina thought he was being difficult on purpose. Outside of the Underworld, of his home, he was regarded with fear or terror or a combination of the two. While only a few gods – let alone mortals – dared to be outright hostile towards him, most of them loathed even the mention of his name, so fearful of it that they rarely called him “Percival”, choosing instead to refer to him as “the one who rules over death”, “Gravedigger” or “Graves”.</p><p>Where Percival knew death to be a mercy for the most, both mortals and immortals alike tended to think him cruel – that was, of course, until mortals inevitably came face to face with him in the Underworld and learnt that he treated them fairly, that his realm was a peaceful place to rest for the most of them, to those who weren’t evil enough to be sent down to Tartanus, to the pits of eternal torment where evil was contained.</p><p>Still, the last time Percival had walked among living mortals to order three new food bowls for Cerberus, the humans had hidden their children and had fallen to their knees before him until all the wailing and pleading and begging and the “please, god of death, do not take anyone with you, we beg of you, <i>we beg of you</i>, have mercy on us” had become so awkward that he had decided that he would ask the god of woodwork to make him a few bowls rather than to order them from a terrified mortal, no matter how skilled a bowl maker the mortal in question was rumored to be.</p><p>“If you left the Underworld more often,” Seraphina sighed when Percival pointed all this out to her, rubbing her temple with the fingers that weren’t holding on to the wine goblet, “people would become more familiar with you and then they might not fear you quite so much.”</p><p>He must have looked rather skeptical because glancing at him made her sigh, her shoulders slump.</p><p>“It’s not healthy for you to stay down in your realm with only souls of mortals, various kinds of ghastly beasts and a few people who work for you for company,” she said, uncharacteristically gently. “Wait a few millennia more, Percival, and it <i>will</i> start to have a negative impact on you, if it hasn’t already.”</p><p>“I’m content with my life as it is.”</p><p>“At least get yourself a wife,” Seraphina suggested. Then, seeing the dawning horror on his face, quickly added, “<i>I’m</i> not proposing to you, don’t worry, don’t worry – I certainly do not want to become your wife, you’re like a brother to me, and I’m busy enough with all the children I’ve made over the centuries as it is. I’m really not interested in having any with you.”</p><p>She had had so many children over thousands of years with various men, mortal and immortal alike, that Percival likely hadn’t even met them all. Three of her sons, Mino, Radus and Acus – whom Seraphina had had with two different mortal men – he had met in the Underworld after they had died, and he had made them his Three Judges due to her pleas and requests and tears, putting them in charge of judging the souls that came to the Underworld. He didn’t regret this decision: Mino, Radus and Acus were fair and they took their job just as seriously as Percival demanded. Had they not, he would have removed them from their positions regardless of the pain it would have caused Seraphina – against the common belief, it <i>was</i> important to him that the souls residing in his realm were treated fairly.</p><p>As The Three Judges, Mino, Radus and Acus could still occasionally meet their mother when she came to visit him in his palace by the River of Oblivion where they, too, now resided, but if Percival was to send them further in his realm among other souls, Seraphina would never again get to meet them unless she agreed to become a subject of his realm which she wasn’t likely to ever do. This was with no doubt affecting his relationship with Seraphina, Percival suspected, and sometimes he wondered if she was being particularly cautious when around him, if she was doing her very best to stay in his good books just so he wouldn’t use her sons against her, so he wouldn’t send them away and prevent her from seeing them again.</p><p>Percival could only hope that she knew him better than that, but he wouldn’t have put it past her.</p><p>Seraphina cleared her throat.</p><p>“I could introduce you to suitable goddesses,” she suggested. "To help you find a wife."</p><p>“I prefer gods."</p><p>“Gods, then. I’ll introduce you to some nice, available gods. We’ll find you a nice god for a wife, for a companion.”</p><p>“<i>We</i> will find nothing,” he told her firmly. “I’m not taking love advice from someone who has a history of turning herself into a bull to kidnap mortal men for fucking.”</p><p>They regarded each other in silence.</p><p>“Fair enough,” Seraphina eventually said, looking away with a cough.</p><p>When the food was served, Percival promptly forgot all Seraphina had been saying about wives – that was, until a few hours later when he met the god of spring with his golden curls and bright eyes for the very first time.</p>
