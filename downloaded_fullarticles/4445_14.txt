    <p>Eli trundled through the halls of Hogwarts castle, taking the longest route imaginable to Professor Palpatine’s office. It was the coldest day of winter yet and all the usual outdoor passages were covered in snow and swept by howling winds. So he decided to take a sizable detour through the much warmer hallways. Though warmer, in this case, did not mean entirely warm.<br/><br/>He reached an open window and quickly pulled out his wand to shut it but the icy wind had already covered the sill in snow. Eli shivered, hugging himself and rubbing his hands up and down for warmth. <br/><br/><em>Stupid cold,</em> he thought to himself bitterly. <br/><br/>Eli was born in much warmer climates and had been enjoying the ever changing scenery while his parents moved him from place to place. Along the way he’d picked up a myriad of languages, cultures and friends but then he turned eleven and his magical travelling childhood came to an end. Eli’s parents had been offered a full time position at one of the courier companies in London and upon settling down, a letter from Hogwarts had arrived without delay.</p><p>Eli wondered what it would have been like to go to school in a warmer place, like Beijing or Darwin where he’d spent time abroad. His friends, Jonas and Xui would no doubt have received letters or invitations similar to his own. But for some reason Eli hadn’t been bothered to write.<br/><br/>He knew the reason, of course. From the moment, the Sorting Hat had screamed out the word “Hufflepuff!”, that stigma of stupidity and naivety had followed him wherever he went. Even his parents were a little disappointed when they told their colleagues at work and heard their snide comments.<br/><br/>He tried to act like it didn’t bother him. He had plenty of good Hufflepuff friends and a lot of Gryffindor and Ravenclaws too. He’d argued with the Sorting Hat himself, given his talent for Arithmancy, he should surely be in Ravenclaw. But no. Here he was, rugged up inside the yellow and black robes, a big scarf wrapped around his face, trudging towards the headmaster’s office like a good little Hufflepuff.<br/><br/>Palpatine had given him a very specific task in his second year. Eli had talent, oh yes. A talent for numbers and lists and inventory. And after single handedly reorganizing the Godric Gryffindor wing of the library, the headmaster had asked Eli to inventorize the Room of Requirement.<br/><br/>Eli had enjoyed the work at first. He’d never seen or heard of so many magical objects as he found in the endless cupboards every day. Each one had to be researched before it could be categorized and stored in an appropriate container, labelled and marked in the proper order as he willed it. But as the days and weeks went on, Eli realized that Palpatine had potentially asked for the impossible.<br/><br/>There was no end to the magical items and his interest was waning, especially after the Half Yearly Exams which he’d studied so hard for. Eli had been neglecting the Room of Requirement for several weeks now and he didn’t doubt why Professor Palpatine had pulled him out of class to talk.<br/><br/>He came to the gargoyle statue that although seemed identical to the others lining the hall, had distinct scratch marks at the bottom. Several odd grooves lined the floor beneath it and Eli was sure it was the right one.<br/><br/>“Through passion I gain strength,” Eli said wearily. Palpatine had about seven different pass phrases that he cycled through week to week and if it wasn’t this one, Eli was ready to recite the rest of them. <br/><br/>But the gargoyle guardian acknowledged his words and slid off to the side with an unpleasant scraping sound that made Eli want to stuff yellow mittened fingers in his ears. He waited for the gargoyle to move, revealing the magically concealed staircase that led to Palpatine’s office and gave a great sigh before trudging up the steps. <br/><br/>The headmaster was an <em>old</em> warlock. Powerful and wise. The kind of man that already knew what your were going to say and watched with mild amusement as you said it. Eli felt it was incredibly condescending at times but he didn’t complain. Sheev Palpatine was said to be the last man alive who knew the Dark Arts of the Sith. It was all for educational and defensive purposes of course, but the knowledge had taken a toll on the man.<br/><br/>The headmaster sat comfortably behind his ornate desk, surrounded by a hundred portraits of his predecessors, all strangely present in their elaborate frames. But the latest headmaster was much less impressive. <br/><br/>Pale, white skin hung from his diminished frame like washing out to dry, not helped by the fact that he wore a long black robe that did very much the same. But for all his age, the eyes that were set deep under his brow glowed very brightly yellow in the dim interior of his office.<br/><br/>“Professor…” Eli mumbled as he entered the open door.<br/><br/>“Eli Vanto,” Palpatine’s words rasped through his ears. “Just the boy I wanted to see.”<br/><br/>Eli chewed his lip worriedly as his eyes darted away from the headmaster. He just couldn’t maintain eye contact with the old man and he found it much easier to watch the portraits around the room while they talked.<br/><br/>“How is your work in the Room of Requirement coming along?” the headmaster asked.<br/><br/>Eli breathed in, guilt eating away at him.<br/><br/>“F-fine,” he said.<br/><br/>“You worry you won’t be finished by the time you graduate?” Palpatine accused.<br/><br/>“Yes, sir…” Eli admitted. “There’s just so much… stuff.” He raised his hands. “I feel like I’m drowning in it.”<br/><br/>The headmaster smiled, that wicked knowing smile that Eli feared with all his heart.<br/><br/>“I appreciate your honesty,” the old man said, shifting to lean onto his desk. “A rarity these days. But I called you here to discuss a more important matter.”<br/><br/>Eli quickly turned to face the headmaster. The Room of Requirement was the only reason he ever spoke to Palpatine. He’d never gotten in trouble before. Did he do something wrong? <br/><br/>“What is it, sir?” Eli asked worriedly.<br/><br/>“I’m told you spent some time in East Asia before coming to Hogwarts, is that correct?”<br/><br/>“Yes,” Eli said slowly, wondering why it was relevant.<br/><br/>“You speak any Japanese? Russian?”<br/><br/>“Some,” Eli nodded. It was mostly colloquial and his knowledge of Japanese kanji was sketchy at best but he could talk his way through a conversation without too much trouble. “My parents were working for a shipping company in Sakhalin for a while. They had a second office in Shibetsu.”<br/><br/>“Good,” Palpatine’s mouth curled into a wicked grin. “And how much do you know about the Chiss?”<br/><br/>Eli froze. His eyes widened and his hands curled into tight mittened fists.<br/><br/>“Only what I read in the Quibbler, sir,” he lied, trying to smile.<br/><br/>The headmaster raised an accusing eyebrow.<br/><br/>“Come now, don’t be modest,” he said emphatically.<br/><br/>Eli swallowed and looked down at his shoes.<br/><br/>His friend, Shouta, had much to say about the myths surrounding Chiss. Magical people with blue skin and red eyes that lived in snow-capped volcanos and dragged victims inside to their doom. There was even a festival in his village where the townsfolk would burn incense and hit gongs to discourage the Chiss demons from coming near, even though there was a wide stretch of water seperating them from the nearest Kuril Island.<br/><br/>His friend, Dimitri, had called Shouta an idiot. Dima was pragmatic and pointed out that the Japanese couldn’t hold their liquor and probably saw demons every time they downed a bottle of sake. The Russian Magistrate for Magical Affairs had combed the Kuril Islands top to bottom during a survey conducted in the 19th century and found only a few magical creatures that were certainly not even comparable to human beings.<br/><br/>But apparently, something had been overlooked because the previous year had seen a spike in the appearance of blue humanoids all over the world. The Daily Prophet was quick to dismiss the claims as flightful fancy but publications such as the Quibbler quickly began printing blurry images of men and women with seemingly bluish skin quietly observing things in obscure places. <br/><br/>An American publication called the New York Clarion was the first to capture a clear image of such a man but he refused interview, and his portrait never spoke to readers as the usual front page stories did. The discovery of new magical species triggered the curiousity of the magical scientific community and many pilgrimmages were made to the Kuril Islands where the Chiss were said to originate but none had been found.<br/><br/>“They’re supposed to have blue skin,” Eli said carefully. “And red eyes?”<br/><br/>Palpatine remained silent, listening intently.<br/><br/>“And they don’t like outsiders,” Eli continued. <br/><br/>“That much is true,” said a cold voice. <br/><br/>Eli felt a shiver run down his spine. It wasn’t Palpatine who’d said those words.<br/><br/>The Headmaster was leaning against his desk, observing him passively through templed fingers and Eli realised the man who’d spoken was standing right behind him.<br/><br/>He contemplated turning but soon found no need as the tall stranger stepped forward. He was dressed in smart black robes, though of a cut Eli had never seen. A crisp white shirt and collar emerged from the vest and suit but there were no markings that would reveal his identity.<br/><br/>Eli gingerly looked up at his face and found two bright red eyes gazing back at him curiously. His neat black hair shimmered in contrast to his pale blue skin and suddenly the young man had very little to say.<br/><br/>The stranger regarded him for a moment and then turned to face Palpatine.<br/><br/>“He will be sufficient,” he said with the hint of an American accent. <br/><br/>“Very good." The headmaster nodded. “Though I fail to see why you would need an interpreter.”<br/><br/>The stranger considered this.<br/><br/>“Your English is strange here,” he said. “Almost as if there is a different dialect within every square kilometre. I would like an interpreter.”<br/><br/>“If it’s a British interpreter you need, then I can arrange for someone else,” Palpatine began.<br/><br/>“No,” the stranger said firmly. <br/><br/>“As you wish.” Palpatine smiled cunningly.<br/><br/>“Eli, I would like you to meet Mitth'raw'nuruodo. Our Chiss visitor.”<br/><br/>Eli had not taken his eyes off the man and quickly turned to look at Palpatine. But then realized he was being introduced to someone and turned back.<br/><br/>“I- I’m Eli Vanto,” he said, trying to keep his hand steady as he took off his glove. <br/><br/>The Chiss looked at him curiously for a moment but shook his hand firmly. Eli felt the cold skin against his own and regloved his freezing fingers as soon as was polite.<br/><br/>“It’s nice to meet you, Mith'raw'nurodo,” Eli said, stumbling over the name. It always took him a few tries to get pronunciation right.<br/><br/>“I’m sorry, Mitth'raw'nuruodo,” he tried again.<br/><br/>“A valiant attempt from young Eli, but perhaps your Core name would be more suitable to a classroom environment.”<br/><br/>The Chiss nodded.<br/><br/>“Call me Thrawn,” he told Eli. To which the boy nodded.<br/><br/>“Wait, classroom?”<br/><br/>“Mitth'raw'nuruodo has expressed interest in Hogwarts School as a place of learning for young Chiss,” Palpatine explained. “He’s asked to observe things here for a few months and I would like you to show him around.”<br/><br/>“Me?” Eli wondered out loud. He looked up at the tall Chiss fellow and then quickly back at Palpatine. And now he realized why all the portraits were inside their frames today. <br/><br/>“Well, if you’re sure…” he murmured.<br/><br/>“Excellent,” Palpatine said. “Then there’s only one matter of business left to attend to.”<br/><br/>He rose slowly from his seat and walked over to the tall book strewn shelf that also housed a number of magical artifacts, one of which was a tall, wide-brimmed hat that looked like it belonged in the garbage. The old wizard plucked it off the shelf with his bony white fingers and carried it over to Thrawn who watched him skepticly.<br/><br/>“It’s enchanted,” he said, his glowing red eyes studying the Sorting Hat.<br/><br/>“Yes,” Palpatine said. “Try it on.”<br/><br/>He passed the hat to Thrawn but he didn’t put it on his head. He stared at the Hat intensely and Eli remembered his own Sorting experience. When he’d spoken to the Hat and asked politely if it might consider putting him in Ravenclaw. The conversation had gone on for what seemed like an eternity but when it finally cried out its decision, only a few moments had actually passed in reality.<br/><br/>Thrawn spent a good few minutes glaring at the hat and then the corners of his mouth turned down.<br/><br/>“Slytherin…” the Hat said out loud and Eli’s heart sank.<br/><br/><em>Perfect,</em> he thought to himself. A weird looking magical creature, in Slytherin? They’d eat him alive. But then a thought came to him.<br/><br/>“But, why did he need to be sorted, Professor?” Eli asked curiously as Thrawn passed the Hat back to Palpatine.<br/><br/>“Thrawn will be observing the students as much as the teachers,” Palpatine explained. “He will be studying alongside you.”<br/><br/>“What?” Eli looked back at the tall man. “But he’s so old.”<br/><br/>The Chiss looked at him curiously for a moment.<br/><br/>“How old are you, Eli Vanto?” he asked passively.<br/><br/>“Fifteen,” Eli replied automatically.<br/><br/>The Chiss said nothing but Eli could have sworn he saw the corner of his mouth turn up.<br/><br/>“How old are you, then?” Eli asked sharply.<br/><br/>“Now, Eli,” Palpatine interrupted. “You are representing the best Hogwarts has to offer the Chiss. Remember that.”<br/><br/>Eli pouted and sighed.<br/><br/>“Yes, Professor Palpatine.”<br/><br/>“Oh and one more thing.” The old wizard opened a drawer and pulled out a small yellow pin which he placed on his desk. “This is for you, Eli.”<br/><br/>The disgruntled youth walked over to the desk and picked up the tiny badge. There was a big black 'P’ written on it.<br/><br/>“Prefect?” Eli raised an eyebrow. “But Yogar Lyste is Prefect.”<br/><br/>“I was going to give this to you next year but a few months in advance won’t hurt,” Palpatine told him. “You are to wear this only when Mitth'raw'nuruodo is present. Do you understand?”<br/><br/>“Yes, sir.” Eli nodded eagerly. An odd condition, but being made Prefect more than made up for any details.<br/><br/>“Very good. Now if you wouldn’t mind showing Mitth'raw'nuruodo to the dormitories…”<br/><br/>“You mean…” Eli gulped. “The dungeons?”<br/><br/>Thrawn raised an eyebrow.<br/><br/>“You keep your young locked up in dungeons?” he asked curiously.<br/><br/>“They used to be dungeons when the castle was built,” Eli explained quickly. “They’re fine now, quite livable, they’re just…”<br/><br/>“Where the Slytherin House students board,” Palpatine finished for him.<br/><br/>Thrawn lowered his inquisitive eyebrow. It was hard to tell if he was convinced or not, his passive expression was hard for Eli to read.<br/><br/>He tucked the badge into his pocket.<br/><br/>“Good day then, Professor,” he said and Palpatine waved them away.<br/><br/>“Umm, follow me,” he said to Thrawn and turned to leave.<br/><br/>The quiet footsteps of the Chiss followed him down the stairs as Eli left Palpatine’s office. </p><p>
