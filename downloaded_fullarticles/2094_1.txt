  <b>The doctors had never seen anything like it.  She was a perfectly healthy little girl who just happened to have two hearts.  The only explanation they could offer was </b>
  <span>that it was a fluke of nature; perhaps she had absorbed her twin in utero but with her being an orphan it wasn’t like there were any medical records to look up or fall back on.  The Smith family, both Jane and Mary, didn’t care though this little girl was healthy, happy, and theirs; that was all that mattered.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It didn’t matter that sometimes she would give them a look that made it seem that she understood everything and wasn’t impressed with all of this baby talk thank you very much.  Or that she had this little key on a necklace that she would never allow them to take off; she would scream bloody murder if you tried.  All that mattered was that she was happy and healthy.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Or that was all that mattered until one morning about a week after they brought their little girl home.  During breakfast there was a knock on the door and when Mary opened it there was man in a military style trench coat, white shirt, and messy hair standing on the top step.  Behind him was a general standing at attention and a woman.  Behind all of them on the street was what looked like a complete motorcade.</span>

  <span>“Sorry to bother you ma’am, my name is Captain Jack Harkness, head of Torchwood, that’s Doctor Martha Jones or UNIT and that's General…” here he paused and shrugged, “Whatever, also of UNIT, we’re looking for the Doctor.”</span>
