    <p>The first warning that something was wrong was the sudden cold. The sharp drop in temperature, the way the grass dried up and the daisy’s curled and blackened, like all of the color was being sucked out of them. The second warning was the way the world lost its luster, the colors draining to grey, the sound slowly dimming and fading away.</p><p>“Put it right!” His cousin shouted, shoving Harry in the chest.</p><p>“this isn’t me!” Harry protested, pulling his wand and whirling about, trying to see the all too familiar creatures. His seeker eyes spied their cloaks fluttering against the clouds, the gray on gray an almost perfect camouflage.</p><p>“Dudley, run! To the tunnel!” Harry shouted, shoving his wand back in his pants and booking it for the concrete pipe. The tunnel was an after sight added to the park as the neighborhood around it grew, and they redid the road. No longer was it a two-lane thoroughfare, but a sprawling four lane buzzing byway. The parents of the local children balked at the danger that crossing it would pose, (as well as the sharp difference it would do to housing prices from what had be comparable homes) and thus the pipe was put in place. It was a large concrete thing, ugly, but buried so no one saw it. In the winter some homeless tried to shelter in it, in the spring it flooded with the rains. Summers teens smoked or drank, and in the fall, it was used for moments of privacy. Harry ran down the length, empty fast food wrappers whipping about his feet as the dementors presence kicked up a wind. Dudley, in a surprising fit of athleticism, was close behind him. One of the creatures lunged down to block the end of the pipe Harry had been making for. He drew his wand and thought of his dad, of his mom’s smile, Hermione at the ball, Sirius asking if he wanted to live with him, Ron and Fred and George and Luna and Neville and he focused—</p><p>“EXPECTO PATRON-“ Dudley’s fist halted the spell and Harry’s magic fizzled out.</p><p>“I said put it right!” The rotund bully shouted, smashing a ham fist into Harry’s nose once more.</p><p>“Big D- it’s not me! Can’t you see-“ And then Harry remembered Hermione, during one of the marathon study sessions, primly reciting that muggles cannot see dementors, because they lack magic. Muggles only see the change in weather and mood and put it down to hormones. As Dudley is drawing back his fist once more, James’s voice starts creeping in.</p><p>
  <em>“..him and go! Lily!”</em>
</p><p>“Dudley, you have to trust me, I can make this go away, but I need my wand!” The weight atop Harry shifts away, and he starts to scrabble for his wand, but the feeling only gets worse as the other dementor blocks the entrance they came from.</p><p>
  <em>“Step aside, girl!”</em>
</p><p>A loud growl fills the tunnel, and Harry is forced to curse his luck. Of course, the rabid stray the neighbors had been reporting would find them right now as well. A loud bark echoes and Harry panics.</p><p>“Lumos!” His wand, much to his surprise lights up. The wand isn’t pointed toward any of the ends of the tunnel, more off center of the wall, but the edge of the light shows a familiar black dog standing guard, teeth bared. Before it hovers one Dementor, skeletal hands twitching toward its hood.</p><p>Dudley moans, his eyes rolling in his head. Sirius barks again, snapping at the dementor when it presses forward. For some reason, it seems reluctant to approach any further.</p><p>The other one is not as cautious, perhaps not facing down the Animagus it isn’t as threatened, as its surges forward, transfixed on Harry’s head. Sirius feels the change and spins on his tail, tackling the dementor and ripping at its throat. To Harry’s shock, the dementor shakes and shudders, as if being sundered. With a mighty jerk, something snaps in the dementor, and its cloak settles to the floor, the magic keeping it billowing fading.</p><p>The grim looks up, teeth bared once more past the fallen boys at the other foul spectre, black ribbon caught in its teeth from the torn cloak. The dementor settles and backs away, flying off.</p><p>Harry, who had been fighting the effects as long as he could, succumbs as the adrenaline fades and goes limp on the floor.</p><p> </p><p>It is a curious thing, the Animagus transformation process. You see, the exact creature one becomes cannot always be identified. It has always been of debate whether or not a witch or wizard can access their magic while in the animal shape, or in what form they can, if it is at all possible. For most, the topic never becomes relevant. Most animagi never face a circumstance where they have to survive an extreme duress, such as threat to life or happiness or livelihood while transformed. When the marauders became animagi, as any teenage boy learning to do so at such an age, they joked about being magical creatures. James bragged about being a frost stag, who had an affinity for the cold. Peter laughed about being a calling mouse, who could mimic voices. Sirius, however, Sirius brooded about being cursed by his name. He feared that by being a Black, by having touched the dark, having had it in his blood and grown up in it, that it would be forced to become part of him. When his form was that of a grim, as he was the last to nail down his form, he loudly and often remarked at being ‘just a big, shaggy, black mutt’. Perhaps he was right and he was just a big black shaggy mutt all the way up to his imprisonment. Maybe the effects he gained came from the prolonged dementor exposure. However, he may have always been cursed by his blood and name and had to be something darker. Perhaps it was none of those and ended up being the most powerful of magics, love, as Albus Dumbledore would tell you. Either which way, Sirius Black, wanted for murder and escaping prison, being the first person to do so solo, also that day became wanted for destruction of government property. It would take quite some digging to turn up what property he had destroyed, and even more to get the ministry to admit that he did so without a wand. The fact was, the heir Black became the first recorded wizard to slay a dementor.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Harry awoke to a familiar, smiling face.</p><p>“Wotcher, Harry!”</p><p>“Tonks?” he asked groggily, rubbing his scar as the cobwebs shook loose.</p><p>“Take it easy, you had quite a night.” She says, leaning back on the dresser.</p><p>“Dudley! The Dementors! I- I performed magic!” harry shouts, scrambling against the comforter tucked around him.</p><p>“Hey, I said take it easy!” Tonks scolds, pushing him back down. “yes, you and your portly cousin were attacked by two of those things. You’re both fine, thanks to Sirius.”</p><p>“Sirius! He-“</p><p>“Yes, he saved you. No one really knows how, but he did. He will also be getting a talking to, sneaking out yet again.” Tonks admits.</p><p>“Again?” Harry asks.</p><p>“He’s been slipperier than a greased grindylow. We’ve spotted him prowling around here ever since school let out.” She leans closer, “I don’t always report him. He misses you, and I can’t blame him. He is downstairs with Remus, clearing things up with your relatives.”</p><p>“Uncle Vernon is going to freak.” Harry moans, falling back on the bed. Tonks scoffs.</p><p>“He’ll have a while to work on it. You’re coming with us.” She waggles her eyebrows, shifting them through a spectrum of colors.</p><p>“I am?” Harry asks, “But what about Dumbledore?”</p><p>Tonks’ grin fades. “So, that’s due to me. You know how I’m an auror, right?” At Harry’s nod, she continues. “So, I’ve sworn oaths to the ministry. Some I have wriggle room, some I don’t. I don’t have to turn Sirius in, ‘cause he’s innocent, but I had to report the dementor. Dead Dementor and not where it is supposed to be means Captain Amy gets a call, pronto.”</p><p>“Captain Amy?”</p><p>“Director Amelia Bones. She was forced into the chair by Mad-Eye when he quit. She agreed to take it, didn’t really have a choice, but refused to give up her title. Says one day she’s going to climb back out of the chair and start running patrols again.” Tonks says.</p><p>Slow footsteps make their way up the stairs, and after a moment Remus pokes his head in.</p><p>“It’s all cleared up downstairs. Get him packed up and we’re out. Mad-Eye is getting antsy.” Remus drops Harry’s trunk on the floor and Tonks pops it open.</p><p>“Does he have anything fun in here?” she says, poking around through the top layer of hastily packed clothing and school supplies.</p><p>“Tonks!” Harry protests, climbing out of bed.</p><p>The metamorphmagus shoots up triumphantly with a pale blue scarf. “Ha! Knew it!” she winks at Harry. “Have something to admit?”</p><p>“It’s nothing!” he protests weakly.</p><p>“Sure.” Tonks goes to toss it aside but pauses as it slings by her nose. Her nose crinkles. “Why do you have Fleur’s scarf in your trunk?”</p><p>“She gave it to me when I signaled for her in the maze. I don’t know what she said, but she tied it to me. Wait, how do you know its hers? It doesn’t have her name on it.”</p><p>“No reason at all.” Tonks says, tossing it quickly back into the trunk.</p><p>“You smelled her perfume on it. How do you know what she smells like?” he teases.</p><p>“May have ran into her in Diagon. We had lunch a few times.”</p><p>“Is that what they’re calling it these days?” Harry asks.</p><p>“Prat!” She laughs, smacking his arm. “Fleur is a <em>lady</em>, she doesn’t do dalliances with commoners.”</p><p>“If you say so.”</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>“Mhmm, sure.” Harry says disbelievingly.</p><p>“So,” Tonks says, flicking her wand, “time to pack up all of this. Sirius said to take it all with you, to not risk leaving anything.” With one flick of her wand, Harry’s entire trunk unpacked, things flying out into piles. “This is a spell my mother taught me. She got it from one of her friends, a spell crafter name Selene.”</p><p>“Pack.” With a sharp flick of her wand, a miniature hurricane of clothing and papers and quills and parchment started swirling. Drawers shot open and the closet door fell off its hinge again. Clothes folded and stacked, while papers and books and other things tucked themselves into gaps. Caught up in the show, Harry narrowly caught his glasses when they tried to fly off his nose and into the trunk as it clapped closed. The room looked like it had been ransacked, drawers on the floor, one of the closet doors askew, hanging only by the top hinge. The mattress was stripped, the old stains showing. All of the furniture was bare, the only sound a slight thumping under their feet.</p><p>“Right.” Harry said, kneeling down and prying up the loose board. He pulled out an old schoolbag, which had been pushing on the plank. Harry slings it on his shoulder and looks around for one last time.</p><p>“Is that all?” Tonks asks, looking herself.</p><p>“That’s it.” They step out of the room and walk down the hall, starting down the stairs when something flashes in front of Harry’s face. He snags it out of the air, the chain spooling around his fist.</p><p>“It’s a locket.” He exclaims, fiddling with it as he descended the stairs. As he walks into the kitchen, where everyone is gathered, it pops open. Inside is a photo of his mother, a still photo, but he can tell it replaced the original image. Carved on the back is: L.E. from D.M. &amp; M.M.</p><p>“Now he takes your jewelry too.” Vernon snarls.</p><p>“It’s actually Lily’s. Her roommates gave that to her when they all graduated.” Remus says.</p><p>“Got it all, pup?” Sirius asks.</p><p>“Everything.” Harry replies.</p><p>“Then we’ll be off.” Sirius turns to Aunt Petunia and Vernon, “Hopefully we do not see each other for a long time. Not that I don’t like you, but I don’t like you.”</p><p>“The feeling is mutual.” Vernon gruffs, shooing them with his hands. “Go!”</p>
