    <p>Draco hadn't planned on running a plant shop. He hadn't planned on being the type of person with a favorite type of plant. (Echinacea for anyone wondering.) He certainly hadn't planned on being the type of person who got up early and talked to his plants. But life doesn't always work out according to plan. </p><p> </p><p>At twenty-four he couldn't say he was old, but he could confidently say he was older than he thought he'd ever be. He would like to believe he'd grown as a person. He hadn't planned on getting to eighteen, but he had. Since then it had been a long string of him winging it. </p><p> </p><p>Most of his days at the shop were spent sipping tea, selling, and cataloguing flowers. He enjoyed it. It was peaceful and certainly better than he expected his life to be. It was certainly more pleasant than what his father was no doubt experiencing in his prison cell. </p><p> </p><p>His shop supplied plants of all kinds, not specifically magical or muggle plants. As a result he got both magic utilizing customers and muggles in his shop. Luna Lovegood was a frequent visitor. Always looking to oggle the herbs. She often convinced him to sit down and have some of the multitudes of cookies she frequently brought. </p><p> </p><p>Hermione sometimes dropped in to look through the house plants. She left with a lovely fern Draco had privately been calling Ferdinand. Hermione's visits to the shop were cordial but distant. They'd both silently come to an agreement that it was only business between them. This was something Draco had accepted.</p><p> </p><p>She was the only one of the Golden Trio who stopped in. He honestly didn't blame the others. He was pretty sure Ron still hated him and Harry had no reason to forgive him for all of the things he'd done. He could understand that. He wasn't owed forgiveness. It was a courtesy he was grateful that some had granted him. </p><p> </p><p>He didn't have it in him to be embarrassed when the shop door swung opened as he was whispering to the succulents. He was also watering them. Still it wasn't exactly the most conclusive evidence of his sanity. </p><p> </p><p>"Mal- Oh- I mean Draco- sorry."</p><p> </p><p>Neville Longbottom had popped in for a visit. Draco glanced away from the little moondrop succulent he was watering and smiled in greeting. </p><p> </p><p>"I'll be with you in just a moment! Just gonna finish watering these little fellas."</p><p> </p><p>Neville waited patiently for him to finish. He straightened and walked to the counter. </p><p> </p><p>"Alright what can I help you with?"</p><p> </p><p>Neville blinked in surprise.</p><p> </p><p>"Luna said you have some seeds I could get for our unit on muggle plants?"</p><p> </p><p>"Oh! We have a lot of muggle plants! Were you thinking of flowers or something more edible?"</p><p> </p><p>"Edible. Tomatoes specifically."</p><p> </p><p>"Tomatoes are hard to grow, but if you can get them to live you'll never be rid of them. Grab as many as you need. I suggest the cherry tomatoes personally. You can pick out some flower packets too. On the house."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh- uh- thanks Draco. That's very kind."</p><p> </p><p>Draco smiled. </p><p> </p><p>"It's no problem!"</p>
