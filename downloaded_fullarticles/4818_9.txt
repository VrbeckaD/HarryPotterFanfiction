    <p>Appearances meant nothing.</p><p>	This was something that Azalea Dorea Potter – the only child of Lord James Potter and Lady Lily Potter nee Evans, and as such the sole Heiress of the Potter estate – had known from an early age.</p><p>	Azalea had only had limited interaction with the outside world since she arrived at 4 Privet Drive, her Aunt Petunia had said that this was so she could not infect 'good ordinary people' with her 'Taint'. Azalea did not know what this Taint was, maybe it was something that could not be seen, but by the time she could go to school she was convinced that she must be tainted in some way...and school only reinforced that idea.</p><p>	The other children did not want to play with her, called her mean names and avoided her at all other times. The teachers looked at her with distrust and suspicion, punished her for things she had not done, and excluded her from group activities. And people with the Taint must not be allowed to do well in school, because when she attempted to improve everyone's opinion of her by studying hard and getting good scores on her end of year tests, her teacher has scowled at her and muttered about 'bad ones' under her breath. Worse, her Uncle Vernon had beaten her black, blue and bloody for 'cheating', and had thrown her into her cupboard once she lost consciousness. That door had been locked and had not opened since that day. </p><p>	Azalea had used the limited time she was conscious to make a list of rules so this would never happen to her again. According to these Rules, created from the expectations of her relatives, one with the Taint must not be idle (which meant chores in all available free time), must not be heard (even when being beaten), must not be seen (unless requested for), must not do well in school (pretending to be a normal person was absolutely forbidden), and must not have the comforts of a normal person (this meant no good food, no good clothes, no nice bed, no hospital check-ups or dentist and optician appointments). </p><p>	Azalea had hoped for a swift return to her old routine: Being woken up by her Aunt Petunia at six o'clock in the morning, and thrown into the bathroom to use the toilet and have a quick shower with cold water. Then to quickly get dressed and make breakfast for her Aunt and Uncle... then put on the washer, fetch the mail, dust all surfaces in the house, wake and make breakfast for her cousin, tidy his room, wash the pots, and hopefully receive a glass of water and an apple for breakfast if she had done the housework to her Aunt's exacting standards. Before school she had returned to her cupboard at this point to allow her Aunt to look after Dudley without distraction. She would then be let out at half past three to hoover the entire house, mop the kitchen floor, clean the windows, hang up the dried washing, and make dinner ready for when Uncle Vernon returned from work. After washing the pots and returning the kitchen once more to a pristine condition she would be given a glass of water and an apple and told to return to her cupboard. If it had been a good day for her Uncle, she would fall asleep and wake up to begin the routine again. If it had been a bad day...she would be dragged from the cupboard by her hair, and her intoxicated Uncle would beat her until she threw up what little she had eaten that day, before allowing her to crawl back into her cupboard. Her starting school only filled that gap in the middle of the day, and gave her a sandwich in a second-hand lunch box to keep up appearances.</p><p>	Yet all Azalea's hazy recollections in the brief periods she was awake showed that the cupboard door remain locked, and her routine was broken...all because of a report card.</p><p>	It must be explained that it is impossible for someone to survive on such meagre resources as Azalea did, and for all their cruelty the adult Dursleys were not completely stupid. They were aware that rags for clothes, an emancipated frame, or bruises in obvious places would draw negative attention to their family, that rumours of bad genetics from a whore mother and a drunk father could not cover up. So Azalea was clothed in cheap clothes from a charity shop, given food with some nutritional value, and only bruised in places that her clothes could cover up. The Dursleys also relied on the strange power Azalea had – as much as they hated and feared her for it – to fix her when they went to far. Like the time Uncle Vernon broke her leg and blinded her in one eye and she was healed by the next day, or the time Aunt Petunia went on a spa week with some of Uncle Vernon's colleague's wives and he had forgotten to feed Azalea even once, Azalea was the same as when her Aunt left...though repeated testing had showed that this could not be done regularly. At all previous times the power had risen to the challenge, and the Dursleys had expected it to do so again, when they left Azalea injured and did not leave her any food or water for over three weeks.</p><p>	Unfortunately for them that power was not limitless, and though they didn't know it Azalea was dying.</p><p>	And it was that fact that resulted in the front door of 4 Privet Drive being kicked down by 4ft tall creatures with long hands, feet and noses, sallow rough skin, sharp teeth, and vicious expressions.</p><p>	Petunia Dursley was taken captive and disappeared in a flash of light. Vernon Dursley was killed when he attempted to fight the attackers. Dudley Dursley was at school, causing trouble, and at the moment unknowing that he would never see his family again. And Azalea Potter was gently gathered into strong arms and lifted out of her cupboard, she also disappeared in a flash of light and she also would never see the Dursleys again.</p>
