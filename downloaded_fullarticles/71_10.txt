  <em>The TEP Academy, London </em>
</p><p>
  <em>3<sup>rd</sup> September 2020</em>
</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>The North Wing of <em>The TEP Academy</em> foyer had been reserved for the students of Melpomene House since 1902. There was a small library on the ground floor which was circular and cold, and the fire hadn’t worked in years; flames of vanilla paper and broken leather sitting astride the paperbacks, collecting dust. It was beautiful and haunting and <em>heavy,</em> and where the Portland stone fell away from the wall, it was all dark wood and dim lighting and it smelt like scholarship and tradition; a pocket full of chambers stuffed tight with stars and tied tight with the scent of Black magic.</p><p>Tiny windows embellished with corbels had been left ajar by the caretaker over the summer and the common rooms’ sweet incense and pungent leather had since been replaced by the stale fragrance of London’s drunken debauchery; a cavity of misadventure gnawing at the Penelope Blue bones of it - teeth of mahogany and velvet and gold. There were bookcases galore - and trophies too - and where the ceiling fell away from the sky, the floorboards appeared to shimmer beneath the dusky-pink dome of the city; dust-eddies floating across the big, empty square in the middle of the room. </p><p>It was there that Hermione Granger stood - suspended between lives - and feeling strangely as though she had fallen into the parts of the night sky where there are no stars and even fewer dreams. She had friends in Melpomene House, but she knew that their friendships – tentative and fragile in their permanency- would be able to do little to protect her from the wrath of their Head of House should the Professor decide that she simply wasn’t up to scratch.</p><p>The pre-established circle of Melpomene students’ that Hermione had met over the summer all possessed a certain kind of prominence; a name that could be wielded as currency or a family tapestry that stretched around the world twice over, and they – unlike Hermione – knew which Professors’ needed to have their egos stroked or their pedestals polished in order to clinch a respectable grade. The fact that Hermione was a scholarship student automatically meant that she was going to have to work twice as hard to be considered half as good and her scholarship was a secret that had been stored tightly against the stars; distant and shiny and <em>true. </em></p><p>It wasn’t that Hermione wasn’t looking forward to the challenge that her status (or lack thereof) would enviably bring. <em>She was.</em> There was nothing she liked more than proving people wrong, but the Professors were bound to know the truth of her, and there was nothing she could do about that. Maybe they would turn a blind eye to her altogether, or maybe they'd flaunt their inside-knowledge around the classroom like a weapon; either way, she was going to need to maintain a strong grip on her self-worth if she was going to tread the boards here successfully. That frightened her more than the circumstances surrounding her transfer did. </p><p>The syllabus at The University of Dublin had been nothing short of excellent, which was perhaps why she was able to secure a transfer in the first place, but there were few schools could match The TEP Academies tenacity for success. Its illustrious reputation was glossy and bright and had brought many a rival to their knees over the years; so much so, that Hermione could feel a noose tightening around her neck; whispering <em>‘fraud’</em> over and over again. She didn't possess the name, the calibre or the self-righteousness the school seemed to demand from its students. The noose slipped lower and lower with every step that she took towards the fireplace until it became itchy and <em>tight</em>, and although she wasn’t ‘technically’ a fraud because she wasn’t ‘technically’ pretending to be a person she wasn’t, she wasn’t exactly being herself either.</p><p>Hermione strongly suspected that her birth mothers’ affiliation with the University had had a hand in her acceptance. Renee Freeman – the student who had had an affair with her father in the late nineties - had subscribed to the university in it’s prime, that much Hermione understood to be true. But she had likely been a scholarship student too, and her tenure had been short-lived, because as far as Hermione could surmise from the sketchy articles fed to her by her father, Freeman had neither graduated nor continued to pursue a career in the arts. She had, however, been talented. There was no way she would have been granted access to a University of such calibre if that hadn’t had been the case and there was no feasible explanation for Hermione’s swift acceptance other than the influential weight of someone else’s’ reputation.</p><p>It was likely, Hermione thought, as she stared at the portraits on the wall, that her mother had been schooled alongside some of the Professors. Perhaps they would know more about Hermione’s origins than she did. Or maybe they wouldn’t. Maybe, if Renee had in fact been a scholarship student like Hermione, she wouldn’t have been worth a second glance. It was entirely possible that Hermione was the reason she hadn’t graduated. Was it possible to perform a <em>pirouette</em> whilst heavily pregnant?</p><p>Hermione hoped she’d never find out, but then again, her roommate’s wise words of wisdom seemed to be rebounding around her skull quicker than Gemma Collin’s rebounded from the gym; unhelpful in the same way a blind person might be if you had to rely on them to tell you when the traffic light had switched to green.</p><p>
  <em>“If we indulge in anything remotely pleasurable Mione – sex, pizza, Barbra Streisand – then you better be prepared to cut off a butt cheek to put it right. Professor Black will hone in on a muffin top quicker than a heat-seeking missile in Iran.”  </em>
</p><p>That explained why the mere mention of ordering a fucking *<em>pizza*</em> sent Draco Malfoy into a tizzy, but now, as Hermione ran her hands across the barre in the corner of the room, her previously absent sympathy for her birthmother emerged ten-fold. Pregnancy wasn’t <em>exactly </em>an immediate concern for Hermione; in fact, if she fell pregnant, she’d have to call the baby 'Jesus', because it would be a bloody miracle, but still, the thought of confiding in Draco Malfoy (or any of the other TEP students) would be enough to trigger a string of spontaneous combustions across the campus strong enough to bring down a tyrannosaurus on heat.</p><p>That didn’t make her feel better, but at least it wasn’t a concern that belonged to her. Hermione had lived with Draco Malfoy ever since her arrival in the city, inheriting the rent from his former roommate, Blaise Zabini: a third-year who had crashed out of Musical Performance with a less-than-idyllic report card bruising his less-than-idyllic ego.</p><p>In the first instance, Draco and Hermione had been a combination doomed to fall at the first hurdle. They’d bickered incessantly over the furnishings inside the apartment (Hermione had just wanted <em>somewhere </em>to store her books, but <em>Draco…</em>well<em>, </em>he had wanted the living area to remain bare so that his whims of artistic inspiration would not be dampened by the smell of Hermione’s ‘dusty, old knowledge’). After one too many tantrums (from Draco) and one too many threats (from Hermione), they’d finally found their stride, tweaking the apartment until it looked something like the highest point in a Broadway enthusiasts’ heaven. </p><p>This was all quite needless to say because even though it had taken a while for Hermione’s preconceptions of Draco to be overtaken by the reality of his existence, she quite liked the artist now. Unlike her own humble relationship with her mother and father back home in Ireland, Draco was comfortably distant from the parents that had birthed him. They coughed up for his tuition with a grimace of disapproval and they showed up annually to check that he still had a pulse, but they were prudish, and he was anything but, creating a divide between them wider than the gap between Laura Hutton’s front teeth. He may have boasted an impressive surname with a weighty history sewn into the silvery seams of it, but his attitude was modest and the pair had clicked quite without preamble after their initial spats; similar in the way that they were two stray cats who, determined to kick on in life without endorsement or fuss.</p><p>Hermione quickly learned from the array of colourful characters that tramped out of their apartment in the mornings that Draco thrived on the brashness of life. He was a natural hustler, worldly beyond his twenty years, and he had survived familial estrangement thus far by working as a rent boy in the London borough of Camden. Hermione hadn’t the guts to follow suit – <em>thank god </em>- so she had instead landed enough hours under the romantic canopy of Leadenhall Street Market to make ends meet in a little bar called <em>The Jam Jar</em>. She split the rest of her time between the library and Camden market, browsing for books and busking for bunce.</p><p>The balance Hermione had been seeking on arrival in the city had been achieved and with Draco’s help, she slipped safely into the network of pre-established Melpomene students quietly, without commotion or fuss. Thus forth, the summer had commenced smoothly, filled with many a story about The TEP Academy’s wonderous alumni and the wide array of colourful professors that could be found there, including their vitriolic – if not partly alcoholic – Head of House: <em>Professor Black. </em></p><p>Draco had supplied his new roommate with many a story about his time as a student under the infallible Professor’s wing, favourably describing her as <em>‘unafraid of a little controversy,’ </em>and <em>‘more than capable of</em><em> through each new syllabus on a ruthless tirade of constant crudeness and cruelty.’</em></p><p>Hermione hadn’t been overly encouraged by that, but the admiration in Draco’s accounts of the Professor seemed to imply that she ought to have been. He had amended his narrative upon seeing the concern on Hermione’s face, adding that Black <em>did</em> possess a brilliant flair the dramatics – a huge source of entertainment for those seniors permitted to join Musical Performance, the crème de la crème of the curriculum, (as long as you weren’t on the receiving end of her provocative slurs) – and she <em>was</em> the consummate professional when it came to delivering a gut-curdling one-liner. <em>‘Comic prowess is part of the unexpected genius of her’ </em>he had said giddily as if that erased the wickedness of her. <em>Just don’t laugh,</em> he’d warned. <em>She won’t like that. </em></p><p>The Professor hadn’t <em>seemed</em> all that intimidating, Hermione thought, remembering the woman who had sat in on her entrance exam.</p><p>The Professor had worn her gentry well; like a blade embedded in a skull. It had been slick and excessive, and Hermione had wanted to roll her eyes at it; to yank it free and clean the blade (just to see what was left behind). But she couldn’t – not if wanted to secure herself a future in one the Professor’s classes - so she had turned away instead; continued with the task at hand; aware that she was being watched and that it felt nice (to be watched) (by her<em>)</em>. The impertinence of the Professor’s gaze and the contrast of her mature heart against the shiny newness of Hermione's had captured the student’s imagination in a big way. The Professor hadn't been generous in her interaction, but she had been <em>present. </em>Hermione knew there wasn't a hair on her head that the Professor had not zoned in on and to be <em>seen</em> like that - like she'd been waiting for Hermione all her life - had not been easy to forget. </p><p>The entry exam had gone smoothly enough and everything Draco had told her about the Professor appeared to be <em>distantly</em> true; but still, Hermione found that she didn’t particularly fear the onslaught of her inevitable rejection. In fact, Hermione had been elevated by it and she’d pushed herself even harder to <em>be</em> better; to gain the Professor’s respect; to draw her in and make her think. Hermione basked in the tiny tick of a smile she received in her last audition because as fleeting as it was, it was hard-earned, and she dined out on the pride it gave her for weeks afterward.</p><p>Hermione found that the nickname afforded to '<em>Cruella'</em> didn’t quite fit, though. Yes, the Professor rocked vintage Ralph Lauren tuxes and yes, they had been cut like glass - the colour of clouds around the moon – but when she was wasn’t wearing a lacy bralette or skin-tight leotard, she wore white silk slashed open to the ribs and the effect was quite breath-taking. She was efficient and polite, dropping into the auditions with a tight-lipped smile and a quiet deposition and although she’d been exuberant (at times) – and even unpredictable, perhaps – she had not been deranged or cruel. When the stressful period had <em>finally</em> ended, and the final round of auditions had been wrapped up, the Professor had surprised them all by gleefully upending her chair and storming out of the auditorium clapping her hands over her head in approval; her long, light-auburn bob-cut swinging around her neck as she went.</p><p>The two pictures – Draco’s description and Hermione’s experience of the Professor - didn’t quite seem to align.</p><p>It nagged on Hermione's conscious, because they didn’t form a whole.</p><p>Now that the adrenaline had worn off, Hermione realised that she couldn’t really have deciphered the Professor’s reaction to her audition; the light had been too dim to see the expressions of the panel, but she felt that the Professor was ultimately impressed; maybe even excited by the prospect of expanding her class. Of course, Hermione might have been wrong, but she <em>felt</em> it; the bubbling sense of potential pushing through her veins and the excitement that bloomed behind it. She knew deep down that feeling – that desperate, pathetic feeling of <em>‘are we going to be able to pull this off? </em>– that she had been chasing her whole life belonged to the Professor now.</p><p>And she knew that <em>she</em> knew it, too.</p><p>There was potential in Hermione – even if it did come wrapped in shamrock and Guinness – and it was The TEP Academy's for the taking.</p><p><em>So, what had Hermione missed that Draco so obviously had not</em>?</p><p>She'd liked the Professor immediately.</p><p>Hermione turned this strange anomaly over in her head as she waited to be collected by said Head of House; her fingers climbing nervously over the ladder of her ribcage as she remembered home and it’s distance; the scratchy edges of a lengthy scab reminding her of what she’d left behind. She searched for something and nothing to bridge the gap between knowing and unknowing, her gaze skirting across the plush Honour’s Board that hung above the open hearth:</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>{INSERT BOARD}</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>She was mid-way through memorising the different factions and their corresponding illustrations when a sinfully smooth <em>tut, tut, tut </em>broke her out of her reverie. She’d never been <em>tutted</em> at before in her life - save for one exception - and her mind, which had once whirred like an engine - all neat clockwork, and polished dials - now stuttered stop-start on all the pills jammed in its gears. There was a mute moment of nothingness that caught upon the turrets and then, like a bottle of black magic that had been unstoppered, the chamber seemed to shake with the force of it; human magic, thick like blood, bright like fire swirling in the space between them. Hermione wheeled around to face the intruder, her shamrock-green eyes aligning to collide slap-bang with the predatory twitch of The Angry Angel's smile. <em>Shit. </em></p><p>Hermione had seen this woman at The Jam Jar before; sitting in the parlour downstairs where only members were permitted to sit and only members were permitted to sit (in the dark) (with her). </p><p>Now, the women Hermione had referred had nicknamed The Angry Angel (behind her back) was leaning casually against a stone archway at the back of the chamber, sinfully delicious in leotards of Black lace and powder grey. The sheer skirt had been arranged around her calves like a storm and her face was unreadable; a mask of practiced indifference, almost as if she had expected this strange turn of events to play out long before Hermione had received the memo. This ‘<em>Professor Black’</em> was nothing at all like the woman Hermione had danced for in July. If anything, she seemed a little quirky, as if she had been plonked half-way between reality and the moon and she didn’t seem to give much of a hoot whether her feet touched solid ground again or not; perfectly aloof as she examined her black nails.She was relaxed and unabashed, wearing two pairs of glasses on her square face and god only knows how many pencils in her hair. And if Hermione hadn’t been struck by the rounded candidness of her before; the grounded sensibility that came from her youthful exuberance or the directness of her sapphire black gaze, then she was certainly bowled over by the way she dressed.</p><p>Hermione was sure that The Angry Angel had already entered her mid-thirties and it appeared to suit her, for she juggled demure and wacky single-handedly; a little like a witch who just wanted to be let loose. In fact, now that Hermione saw her in the blush of the morning light, she looked oddly as if someone had dipped her in glue and dragged her through Camden Market; layered Tulle skirts of mesh and sheer lace rounding out the presence of her, filling a rather petite frame with pearls of intrigue. Hermione found herself fascinated by the thicket of stormy, black curls that had been piled high above her head - presumably by a child - and pinned haphazardly with pins of emerald and silver, one persistent curl fluttering over the bridge of her nose. There was a curling flick of bemusement that caressed the sharpest edges of her haughty expression and in the half-light, she looked an awful lot like the Professor that Hermione had seen sitting in on her audition, but sadly, upon closer inspection, they weren't one and the same.</p><p>There were three facts that Hermione knew about The Angry Angel and none of them were helpful to her now:</p><p>1) She was older (by a decade)</p><p>2) Colder (by an ice-age)</p><p>3) And she liked her martini's to be vodka, not gin; French vermouth; stirred. Dry. One olive on a toothpick, tucked against <span class="il">the</span> rim. </p><p>"Well pet, I must say I'm flattered." The Professor purred, running a polished nail over the back of a well-worn armchair. "I've never had someone seek me out at work before."</p><p>“I'm sorry. I'm actually waiting for Professor Black." Hermione looked around at the furnishings. "Do you know if I am in the correct house?"</p><p>"I'd say so." The Professor said, tilting her head with a slow smile. "Since this is my house and all."</p><p>"You mean, you're Professor <em>Black?</em>"</p><p>"The one and only."</p><p>“But wait, that can't be right. You weren't there for my audition...were you?" Hermione asked numbly, decidedly floored. Her mind was scrambling to assemble the pieces she needed to put the invisible puzzle together, but it was decidedly lacking in the basics: namely, the corners. She was missing more than just the innards of this mystery. </p><p>“Don’t you think you’d remember if I was?” </p><p>There was a small flinch as Hermione stepped forward, sunlight tripping over her cheekbones in one solid block of amber and the momentary scrunch of the Professor’s brow - the way her lips immediately twitched as if desperate to ask her a question – and the slight flex of her finger’s as they curled around a bicep as if to ground herself - weren’t missed by her newest recruit. Hermione clamped her mouth shut and waited, thinking twice about voicing her confusion. The tension in the room was creeping up the walls and Hermione’s breath was urgent when it came, but she forced the confession to fit between the gap between her teeth, head shaking softly from side to side as she admitted: </p><p>“You wouldn’t be easy to forget."</p><p>Her voice was cool; the Irish flexion bending her syllables until they were flat and hard to decipher. </p><p>“You’ve tried.” The Professor said plainly. It wasn’t a question or even an observation; it was a confession tugged into the light and held there, waiting for Hermione to wrap her fingers around it and pull it back into the darkness. “True or false?”</p><p>“True.”</p><p>
  <em>False.</em>
</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>Hermione shuffled nervously on the tatty, thread-bare rug, feeling considerably inadequate beneath the steely eyes of her new Professor. <em>Could she see through her?</em> She heard the tap of her stilettos – shiny like beetles - and tensed, but then she felt the analysing touch of the new Angry Angel’s fingertips tracing over her jaw and relented, allowing the Professor’s fingers to clasp at her chin and tilt it upwards, the action deliberate and assertive. The accord of the Professor’s perfume hung in the air around them: voluptuous notes of Cashmeran wood and Sambac jasmine sinking into the very bones of her, permanent and right and Hermione couldn’t imagine ever smelling perfume like that again. It made her heartache.</p><p>She realised then, when her heavily mascaraed eyes rose slowly to meet the scrutinising hardness of her teachers stare, that the Professor was only a few inches taller than her, and that was only because her heels were far more daring than Hermione could ever bring herself to dance in.</p><p>“I didn’t realise you were a dancer.” Professor Black said, eyeing the heels in Hermione’s hand. She paused, considering the girl with a gentle stare. When she spoke, it was murmured against the shadows, pushed against the darkness; never to be found again. Then she jolted Hermione’s face away from hers, stepping backward with a look of disdain. “I think I liked you better when I thought you were a bartender."  </p><p>“Would you have called me”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Would you have called me? If you'd have known that I was a dancer?”</p><p>“How is that relevant?” The Professor asked, her mouth turning into a snarl. </p><p>Hermione knew she was balancing on the edge, but somewhere beneath the stubbornness, there were real, <em>hurt</em> feelings at stake that needed to be addressed.</p><p>She'd saved this Professor from jumping into the canal once; which was bloody typical really, because she'd almost kissed her too.</p><p>“Either way, student or bartender, you didn’t call me. So now that I’m here, what difference does it really make to you?”</p><p>“It doesn’t. I wouldn’t have called.” </p><p>
  <em>She would have.</em>
</p><p>Hermione could see it hanging there in the space between them: the twist of tides in her gold-flecked eyes betraying her thoughts, just for a moment. One moment to many. </p><p>“I see,” Hermione said, throwing the Professor's words back at her. She flicked her tongue over her teeth to wipe the frustration away. </p><p>“We very rarely accept transfers,” Professor Black declared; her eyes narrowed. She wiggled the clipboard in her hands, a glimmer of her resolve returning. Her swift departure from Hermione's line of conversation was a stark reminder of who was in control now. “Glasgow has a great programme.” </p><p>“It does.” Hermione agreed tersely.</p><p>“And a very good reputation...” The Professor mused, wriggling her brow. “In fact, their Musical Performance department is one of the few that we consider to be our true competition."</p><p>“I learned a lot from my time there.”</p><p>“And yet you still left-”</p><p>“I had no choice.”</p><p>“It doesn’t make any sense.”</p><p>“I wanted to learn from the best of the best.”</p><p>“Bullshit. No one transfers in their third year.”</p><p>“I admit it wasn’t planned, but…”</p><p>“You had to.” Professor Black interrupted, apparently unimpressed. “So, what did you do?<em> Kill someone?”</em></p><p>“What? <em>No!</em> Of course not.” Hermione balked, scowling. If the Professor’s intuition was this good, Hermione was going to be in for a hell of a ride. Hermione hadn’t killed <em>anyone, </em>but she had bailed, and some would argue that – given the circumstances behind her disappearance from the Isle of Talamh – that was far worse. She pressed her fingers against the sore patch over her ribs, praying hard that her poker face would not abandon her in her time of need and that this ‘Professor’ would never stumble across the real reason for her untimely transfer. “I…Um - I would never, ever hurt anyone. To suggest that I might even <em>kill</em>- well anyone- that really is preposterous-“</p><p>“Oh, stop the sputtering.” The teacher snapped, shoving the clipboard into Hermione’s stomach. The girl swallowed; the motion flexing the muscles in her throat. She folded her arms around the clipboard, as if it could shield her from view, and felt it’s sharp corners dig into the bruised purple of her ribs. “I don’t want to know how you wound up here or <em>why</em>...” The professor cocked a brow and Hermione could have sworn she heard imaginary shots being fired. “What I do want to know is, can you hold your own? This is my house,” Black said, gesturing to the Honours Board. “And Melpomene House is reserved for the best of the best. I will accept nothing less. Failure to adhere to my rules means failure to complete the course – no exceptions. Do I make myself clear?”  </p><p>“Yes, <em>Professor</em>. Quite.”</p><p>The Professor circled her once, zeroing in on all the little ways in which the girl shoved the life of the street into her palms. She had little gashes and scratches littering her jaw and they clawed down her throat to peek out from underneath her leotard, marring her youthful flesh with puckered lines of pink and mauve. Most of them, small and freshly earned, were healing slowly. One, however, just above her brow, was still an open wound, the torn skin bound by dried blood.</p><p>Bella wanted to touch it; to press her thumbprint against it and feel it smear across her temple. She wanted to reach out and ask: <em>What are you hiding, pet?</em> But she didn’t. She turned away instead; her lungs filled with Hermione’s perfume and her mind preoccupied with the abrasiveness of her skin. She smiled; briefly wondering if the girl already knew how to play with fire, but then the smile slipped and faded away indefinitely when she remembered that she herself was made of paper. Still, when 'Hermione' wasn't stuck behind a bar, she was quite a pretty little thing to behold. Bella almost felt guilty for not having memorised the girls' face before. She'd always pretended not to notice the way the Irish bartender obsessed over the glasses behind the bar – cleaning them clockwise, never anti - or the way she wore the sleeves of her white shirt scrunched uncomfortably to the elbows. She'd pretended (for weeks, now) not to like the way she tugged her auburn-blonde curls into a relaxed half-up, half-down fashion, the top half embellished in layered braids to prevent it from falling into her eyes and she resolutely avoided studying the delicate half-needle tattoos that spilled down her arms in blocks of little grey lines. It wasn't easy, but in the half-light of the floral chandelier, she could even turn a blind eye to the nose-ring that she wore upon her left nostril (hideous!) and the genuine way her sorbet-soft smile quirked upwards to ask shyly for a smile in return (pointless).</p><p>She could even pretend not to search for a nametag. </p><p>Hermione was the closest thing Bella had ever seen to <em>bohemian</em> and it should have been horrifying. <em>It’s wasn't. </em></p><p>“By being assigned here, you represent <strong>me.</strong>” She said, considering Hermione’s angular features. “You’re the first scholarship student in twenty years to do so; so make no mistake, we will crush you to get the role ourselves. But we are also family. We get through it together and we celebrate each other when there is big news, so don’t. Fuck. It. Up. You’ll never get a chance like this again.” Hermione squinted back at her and the Professor smiled. “The other houses are watching…and so <em>I am.”</em></p><p><em>“</em>I understand<em>,” </em>Hermione said, running her fingertip’s over the invisible welts around her neck.</p><p>Tiny dots of light fell from the window above Hermione and they shattered in tiny constellations around her; an anomaly in a room full of tradition. There was a splinter of wholeness about her; a sharp, unknown edge that the Professor wanted to press her tongue against – drag her teeth across - and <em>bite down</em>. Her eyes were like meteors as they flicked over Professor Black’s face, oddly captivating in the dim, pink light of the dawn and when the Professor stepped away, apparently appeased by what she found, her head titled comically and a small, satisfied grin sugared her full lips. </p><p>The Professor halted for a moment, seemingly thrown off stride and then said:</p><p>“Hermione?"</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"Start fucking walking."</p><p> </p>
