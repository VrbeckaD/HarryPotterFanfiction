The sounds of cheering floated from the Castle to the Forbidden Forest in a miasma of excitement and anticipation as Draco Malfoy picked his way among gnarly roots and bush undergrowth of the forest. The bright moon lit his way so that he did not need to cast a Lumos Charm or carry a lamp. The Choosing Ceremony the sixth time over had lost all its novelty. If Draco was being honest with himself – which he liked to think he often was – he didn't much care who got into what house. He had bigger things to worry about this year.</p><p><br/>
He had no delusions about what was expected of him. The finer details had been glossed over by The Dark Lord who had left them to his “young and ingenious” mind to overcome. The long and the sort of it: they were relying on him. If he failed... Draco cursed and clenched his fists, there was no room for failure. Not anymore, not from his family. </p><p><br/>
The silence had become too loud and the treacherous thoughts slunk back into his mind, he only hoped he would find the asphodel root before it was too late. </p><p><br/>
Draco's blood froze in his veins when he heard a loud howl. His face was upturned in an instant. His gaze combed the cloudy sky for the moon which up until then had been lighting his path but had gone – for the most part – unnoticed. </p><p><br/>
<em>Full</em>, he noted with a grimace. Just his luck. The howl had been far enough that if he turned back he could sprint to the castle and return barely scathed. But he had come this far and he would not turn back without getting what he came for. Besides, he wouldn't have a chance to do this later and the potion he was brewing was complex enough. Steeling himself against fear, he continued deeper into the forest trying his best to ignore the howling and the fact that it seemed to be getting closer each minute. </p><p><br/>
The dense forestage gave way to ancient towering trees ten minutes later and he let himself take a deep breath of the cool night air. He couldn’t hear any sounds from the Castle from where he stood and he knew he was far enough that it would take until morning before someone found him. He shook his head and picked his way among the gnarly roots of an oak tree.</p><p><br/>
 "Finally," he muttered when he spotted the long slender leaves of the asphodel plant peeking from underneath the shadow of an oak tree. </p><p><br/>
The moon chose that moment to emerge from behind a cloud. Draco shivered as his breath misted before him. It was cold for September. <br/>
A twig snapped behind him and Draco nearly jumped out of his skin. Upon examining his surroundings, he saw nothing. He cursed as he dropped to his knees and began to uproot the plant, carefully. This was the only one he had spotted for kilometres and he wasn't sure he wanted to pilfer Snape's cupboard.</p><p><br/>
He wasn't ready for that. </p><p><br/>
Once he had the plant in his possession, Draco stood. He dusted off his trousers and set about making his way back to the castle. His blood froze when he heard a twig snap once more, he wasn't as startled this time though whether that had to do with the heavy panting he could hear or his previous reassurances, he had no idea. </p><p><br/>
It was large – nearly half Draco's height on four legs – its yellow eyes watched him menacingly as it stalked closer baring its sharp canines which were dripping with spittle. Muscle rippled beneath grey fur with each step it took and for a moment Draco felt the familiar sensation of fear – the real kind which he would never confess to having felt so many times before – slither through his veins. </p><p><br/>
He got out his wand slower than he would have liked. His muscles didn’t seem to want to cooperate. And when he pointed it at the creature, there was a trembling in his arm that had the creature bare its teeth as though it could sense weakness.</p><p><br/>
Draco took a shaky breath.</p><p><br/>
Its lips pulled back further from its mouth. </p><p><br/>
<em>Fuck</em>, Draco thought. He wanted to move but his feet seemed to have a mind of their own. Somewhere at the back of his mind, a voice whispered ‘what’s the point if the beast will catch up to me, just like The Dark Lord will? </p><p><br/>
He bit the inside of his lip and willed himself to focus. On nights like these, his mind ran too fast on its tracks, it made him want to claw at his temples and grind his teeth. The feeling of hopelessness had never been one he was familiar with.</p><p> <br/>
The werewolf's mouth hung open. Jaws unhinged and ready to devour him, it let loose a growl just as Draco yelled, "<em>Impedimenta</em>" But he knew it was too late. The monster crashed into him knocking them both to the ground. Draco landed on a sharp root and grunted as pain flashed beneath his eyelids. His wand flew out of his hand and landed somewhere to his left. He gritted his teeth and began to flail his limbs in every direction.</p><p> <br/>
The wolf let loose a warning growl just as Draco managed to get his left arm from under him. He brought it against the monster’s face and it stumbled back with a yelp of surprise.</p><p><br/>
He wasted no time in scrambling for his wand. It had been a left-hand punch and he’d been unable to put much weight beneath it. He had bought himself only a few seconds. He clawed at the earth as he searched his mind for a spell that would be strong enough to halt a werewolf. There was something that his father had taught him during the summer holiday at the end of his fourth-year hovering just at the fringes of his memory...<br/>
Sharp claws raked through his skin and Draco screamed – a piercing feral cry that emanated from a place he’d never known existed in him. Pain seared white hot beneath his skin, his arms thrashed wildly of their own accord dropping the wand he’d fought to acquire. </p><p><br/>
He had to get away, he had to get away before... </p><p><br/>
 "No," he whimpered as the creature glared down at him. </p><p><br/>
Had he not been fighting for his life; Draco would have been repulsed that the sound left his lips. But all he could think was that this vile creature was about to bite him and he could not – would not – allow that to happen. It bowed his head and he kicked and squirmed pushing at it with all his strength.</p><p><br/>
It let out a sharp bark and trapped his good arm under its paw.</p><p><br/>
Draco saw it before it happened. He saw it in the monster’s eyes. In the pale figure that lay beneath it with a wretched look on his face.</p><p><br/>
Sharp canines lacerated his skin, sinking into his neck. He screamed before it happened but it mattered little a few seconds later. A searing flash of pain was the last thing he felt before the darkness took him. </p><p align="center"><br/>
{HPDM}</p><p align="left"><br/>
The Great Hall was a mass of shouts and yells as various students strove to hear and be heard above the noise of their companions. Everyone was struggling to catch up on who did what in the summer.</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "What d'you reckon's going to happen this year then, Harry?" asked Ron above the noise as the new members of Gryffindor were told tales of the house’s glory with barely contained excitement. “I mean with the Ministry confirming everything and all…”</p><p align="left"><br/>
Harry sat opposite Ron and Hermione with various aromatic dishes between them, unable to resist the smile that found its way onto his face. He was glad to be back at Hogwarts if only to escape the Dursleys for a few more months. The summer had seemed especially long and he would have contemplated finding his own way to the Burrow had Dumbledore not given him a proper reason for his continued stay there.</p><p align="left"><br/>
And then shown up on his doorstep months later and apparated him to Slughorn's residence on some sort of secret mission. </p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Yeah, Harry," Dean said leaning forward so that a few wayward strands of his gleaming dreadlocked hair dipped into his bowl of curry which appeared to be making his eyes water. "Didn't catch you on the train, don't tell me you used the flying car again."</p><p align="left"><br/>
Harry laughed slightly, catching Ron's eye. </p><p align="left"><br/>
 "He wouldn't," his best friend said. "Not without me at least."</p><p align="left"><br/>
That earned a few laughs.</p><p align="left"> <br/>
 "How did you get here?" asked Seamus now invested in the conversation as were a few others he could see. </p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Er..." said Harry trying to think fast. </p><p align="left"><br/>
He couldn't say Dumbledore had whisked him off on an adventure to try and convince Slughorn to come and teach at Hogwarts before dropping him off at the Weasleys who had accompanied him to King's Cross Station where he had boarded the train but spent nearly three-quarters of the ride spying on Malfoy and his friends. </p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Harry probably just needed some time away from all your badgering," Hermione said coming to his aid. </p><p align="left"><br/>
Dean and Seamus didn't look convinced and he even heard someone say, "You mean <em>your</em> badgering" which he thought wasn't fair but a fifth year at their end of the table had come up with an interesting way to make his mashed potatoes change shape and that was enough to take the attention off him. </p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Thanks," he muttered to Hermione under his breath. "Not sure how I’d have gotten off that one."</p><p align="left"><br/>
Hermione smiled. "No problem."</p><p align="left"><br/>
Ron cleared his throat. "As I was saying," he cast a reproachful glance in Hermione's direction to which he received an eye roll, "d'you think anything's going to happen this year?"</p><p align="left"><br/>
Harry knew exactly what Ron was asking. And though he couldn’t deny the summer had been mind-numbing, he wasn’t pining for any sort of action. Somehow it seemed weightier than it did in his first three years. The things he got into then and how he dealt with matters, he would do some things differently if he had a choice.</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "I don't know," he said spooning some chicken stew into his mouth. "I wasn't really expecting much..."</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Nonsense," said Ron at the same time as Hermione said, "Of course not." They both glanced at each other.</p><p align="left"> <br/>
 "There's no use denying it, something's definitely going to happen, Hermione," he said in between bites of roast chicken. “And we’ll have to-”</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Obviously," she cut him off with the air of one educating a simple-minded child, "but it doesn't mean Harry has to get all excited especially now that Voldemort-" she was cut short by Ron's choking- "is gathering his forces."</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "We need to keep an eye on Malfoy though," Ron said when he was done expelling bits of chicken that had snuck into his windpipe. Harry could not agree more. "Whatever he was doing at Borgin and Burkes-"</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Who was doing what at Borgin and Burkes?" asked Lavender Brown sidling up to Ron who did not seem to mind the attention, much to Hermione's chagrin. </p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Browsing for furniture," said Ron easily. </p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Ooh, I know that place," said Parvati Patil waving at her sister Padma Patil before turning to them. "They say the owners were one of You-Know-Who's supporters back in the day."</p><p align="left"><br/>
Ron regarded her disdainfully. "Really? They seemed rather pleasant when we stopped by..." and just like that Harry found himself falling into the rhythm of being back at Hogwarts, glad to be somewhere he could call home once more. </p><p align="center"><br/>
{HPDM}</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "I will not allow this to happen, something can be done, it is only a matter of having the right ingredients."</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Whether or not you will allow it, Severus, is of no consequence. What is done is done. The boy will need your support-"</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Surely you cannot be serious Albus, the boy is merely sixteen, he... he is not ready."</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "No one ever is.”</p><p align="left"><br/>
A sniffle.</p><p align="left"><br/>
 “Nothing can be done to reverse this Minerva, Severus. Lycanthropy is incurable as I am sure you’re both well aware."</p><p align="left"><br/>
A hiss. "I swore to protect the boy should-"</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Severus," warned Dumbledore</p><p align="left"><br/>
The room was silent and Draco suspected that they had realised he was no longer unconscious. He didn’t know how but he sensed that pretending to be asleep wouldn’t yield any more answers than he could get when conscious.</p><p align="left"><br/>
He cracked his eyes open. The shutters had been drawn back and it took a while to adjust to the bright light streaming in from the window opposite him. He inhaled sharply, there was a pain in his left leg where the creature had sunk its claws. In both of his arms – he’d landed badly on the left and the creature had subdued the other under its grasp. And in his neck where its…</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "I'll get your pain tonic," Madam Pomfrey said eager to exclude herself from the tension in the room. </p><p align="left"><br/>
Dumbledore stood to the left of Draco’s bed watching him warily. McGonagall stood beside the headmaster – the only one whose worry was plain on her face – and Snape stood to his right his expression unreadable as always. </p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Mr. Malfoy," this was the Headmaster," how do you feel?"</p><p align="left"><br/>
Draco looked into the blue eyes behind those half-moon spectacles choosing his answer with as much as care as he could.</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Like I've been trampled by a herd of hippogiffs, fallen off a fucking broom-"</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Language," reprimanded Snape. </p><p align="left"><br/>
 "-and been impaled by several needles in various places," he finished ignoring his godfather. </p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Well, the boy certainly has not lost the faculty of speech," the Transfigurations professor said fixing him with a glare that would cause most students to cower. Draco could barely bring himself to care. "I will leave this in your capable hands, Albus."</p><p align="left"><br/>
She swept out of the room just as Madam Pompfrey returned with a vial bearing a nasty green liquid. Draco's lips immediately curled in displeasure; couldn't they bother to at least make them look stomachable? She uncorked the vial and pressed it to his lips so that he had no choice but to ingest the tonic. With the solemn looks on Snape and Dumbledore's faces, he wasn't about to make a fuss because of a mouthful of a pain-relieving potion. Once the matron left the room, Dumbledore stepped forward. </p><p align="left"><br/>
 "I understand this must be trying time for you, Mr. Malfoy but I must insist on knowing everything. Do you remember what happened?" he asked.</p><p align="left"> <br/>
 "What day is it?" Draco asked ignoring the question.</p><p align="left"><br/>
He half hoped it had been some sort of dream. Maybe he had just woken up from a coma, though even as he thought it he knew the idea was desperate and far-fetched. </p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Tuesday, 3rd of September 1996," replied Dumbledore looking unperturbed by Draco’s detour.<br/>
So he had been unconscious for a whole day? </p><p align="left"><br/>
 "You were found unconscious in the Forbidden Forest, having sustained heavy blood loss and various other injuries. Now, do care to explain exactly what you were doing in the Forbidden Forest during the start of term feast?" asked Severus his tone sharp. </p><p align="left"><br/>
Draco wasn't sure a simple 'I was not hungry' would suffice.</p><p align="left"> <br/>
 "I-" he started then he remembered the asphodel plant.</p><p align="left"><br/>
Draco looked down at his clothes only to find he wasn't wearing his robes but a pair of blue linen pants and a similar shirt. He sincerely hoped Madam Pomfrey had not discovered it – or worse – taken it. He needed it and the potion... Merlin, it had been two days since...</p><p align="left"><br/>
His fingers were shaking so he clenched the heavy duvet and looked away. </p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Mr. Malfoy," he heard Dumbledore say but his voice was distorted. </p><p align="left"><br/>
Snape too was saying something but he looked fuzzy, like an image viewed through sheer clothing; visible but not quite. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and forced himself to calm down. He would be fine. As soon as he got out of the Hospital Wing, he would simply brew another potion maybe chase it down with some of Ogden's Old Firewhiskey for good measure. Everything would return to normal. </p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Perhaps you should get, Poppy," the headmaster was saying but Draco protested. </p><p align="left"><br/>
 "No, I'm alright it's probably just the change..." His skin felt too hot, the fabric of his clothes scratching against too soft skin. He needed to get out of here. </p><p align="left"><br/>
 "The full moon isn't for a few weeks."</p><p align="left"><br/>
The full moon. </p><p align="left"><br/>
He was a werewolf now. </p><p align="left"><br/>
The pureblood status that had created a barrier between him and the other students was no more. If word got out about it... his parents would certainly disown him. He would have to register as a magical creature. The mere thought of the shame it would bring made Draco want to scream,. He felt something well up within him, disgust tinged with something else he couldn't identify. He was worth less than filth now, was he still human? How was he expected to live with this?</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "I have instructed Professor Snape, as the head of your house and your godfather, to write to your parents about your unfortunate accident. In the meantime, your classes will proceed as normal save every full moon when you will receive wolfsbane from Severus and be excused from your regular nightly rituals. You will not be alone in this Draco-" he cringed "-remember that."</p><p align="left"><br/>
He turned to Snape. "You can fix this, can't you?" he demanded. As an adept Potions master, Draco knew that if anyone was to find a cure it would be him. </p><p align="left"><br/>
 "I intend to try," he said shooting Dumbledore a pointed look. </p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Do not lead the boy on, Severus. I advise you to make your peace with this Mr. Malfoy as unfortunate an accident as it is, you may find that some good-"</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Good?" he demanded fingers clutching the blanked even harder until his knuckles were white. </p><p align="left"><br/>
Had Dumbledore lost his marbles? Did he not know how werewolves were viewed in society? "Merlin, how the hell is this good? Do you know who my parents are? What they stand for? Do you think they will accept me when they see what I have become, this thing I have changed into?"</p><p align="left"><br/>
Draco blinked to keep back the tears that stung his eyes, begging for release. He had thought it would be enough, having the task The Dark Lord assigned to him hovering in his mind daily. He thought it would be enough to try and hate the headmaster so that it would be easier to do what he had to do. But the man had the nerve to try and console him, to be understanding after he had been turned into the very thing his parents reviled. <br/>
 "You need some rest. I will see you as soon as you leave the hospital wing. Good day, Mr. Malfoy." He left. </p><p align="left"><br/>
His godfather was not much better. His piercing gaze settled on Draco. "I expect a full account of what happened as soon as you leave this place. Be thankful that your father will be angry enough for the both of us."</p><p align="left"><br/>
Draco sunk back into the bed.</p><p align="left"><br/>
He had never wished so hard to stop living. </p><p align="center"><br/>
{HPDM}</p><p align="left"><br/>
It was two days later that Draco was finally allowed to leave the Hospital Wing, a windy Friday afternoon. Expectedly, news of his accident had spread fast and false, the rumours were as fictitious they went. </p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Got bit by a vampire, bloody git deserved it if you ask me."</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Snatched away by the centaurs, probably promised to set his father on them – it would annoy me."</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Trampled by a herd of hippogiffs, a good service to mankind in my opinion."</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Don't be stupid, James. He obviously ran off with Pansy, apparently he's shagging her."</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "What? I thought you said you heard from William who heard from Hannah who heard from Lavender who heard from Parvati who overheard Crabbe say he saw Malfoy and Zabini snogging."</p><p align="left"><br/>
 "Blaise? Ugh, I can't stand that prick."</p><p align="left"><br/>
These weren't the worst of them, Pansy and Blaise had visited him twice and at his insistence had not spared him of the horrible rumours being spread about him. He didn't care what the other students thought but preferred to know what he was walking into. Most of them were Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs who hated him the most, Draco could not bring himself to care even as they gossiped behind his back along the corridors, speaking a bit louder when he was near. They could never say anything he had not already thought of himself. </p><p align="left"><br/>
He locked himself in the boys' dormitory. In his spirit of kindness – Dumbledore, the insufferable man – had excused Draco from classes until next week. He sank to the floor and wished they would shut up. Wished he had run instead of staring at that werewolf like a fool. Wished he didn't have to hear what the voices in his head had to say. A growl of frustration left his lips as he got to his feet.</p><p align="left">He had a potion to brew. </p>
