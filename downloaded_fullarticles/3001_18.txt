  <strong>Chapter 1</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">The sun’s already setting by the time Newt step out of Dumbledore’s office alongside Theseus and the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement Office Torquil Travis. He let out a deep sighed, rubbing the kinks in his neck. It’s been a very long day.</p>
<p align="justify">Professor Dumbledore walks them back to the great hall where the others are waiting. Seeing the Hogwarts ground again brings back endless memories of his younger days and felt a pang of pity towards the man walking just beside him. Theseus walks as if his dragging his feet, lagging behind everyone and Newt had to grab him by the end of his suit to pull him around.</p>
<p align="justify">There are no student in sight, Head master Dippet ordered the others teachers to keep the students inside their respective house dormitories until their meeting was over. And Newt had the sudden urge to get to Hufflepuff and curled back to his old poster bed.</p>
<p align="justify">When they reach the great hall, his friend Jacob Kowalski sat on the Hufflepuff table, platters of food was laid out. He stared at everything with wonder, from the floating candles to the floating ghost that nearly give him a heart attack earlier. Nagini sat on one corner of the Hufflepuff table eating. The poor girl must have been starving because she’s been shovelling food in her mouth and blush when Yusuf Kama offered her a drink after she almost choke on a rather large bite of kidney pie.  There are two other Auror who stood on a corner both in deep conversation. Nicolas Flamel had already leaves earlier.</p>
<p align="justify">But someone’s missing.</p>
<p align="justify">‘Go.’ Newt heard Theseus said in a whisper. Professor Dumbledore and Travis are already heading towards the Gryffindor table where another set of food appeared. They are the only one remained standing on the entrance of the great hall. Newt stared at Theseus tired face. ‘It’s alright Newt.’ He assured. ‘Go make sure that your friends are okay too, it looks like the bloody baron is scaring the muggle.’</p>
<p align="justify">Newt look from his brother to Jacob and sure enough the Slytherine ghost is brandishing his sword and showing the stains of his silver blood. Jacob seems to be amaze rather than scared to be honest.</p>
<p align="justify">‘I’ll be alright Newt.’ Theseus said again, and despite the sadness in his blue eyes he manages to offer a reassuring smile.</p>
<p align="justify">Newt taps his brother’s shoulder. ‘I’ll get back to you in a minute.’ Theseus nodded and trudge his way towards Dumbledore and Travis.</p>
<p align="justify">He watches his brother leave, shoulders slump in defeat and complete exhaustion before going to where Jacob is.</p>
<p align="justify">The muggle smiled weakly at him. ‘This place is awesome Newt.’ Jacob said but his excitement of the place did not reach his eyes.</p>
<p align="justify">The bloody baron takes his leave when Newt sat right next to Jacob.  ‘How are you feeling Jacob?’ he asked.</p>
<p align="justify">The baker shrugged. ‘Fine I guess.’ He answered scratching his left cheek. ‘Can’t wrap my head on some – ’ he struggles.</p>
<p align="justify">Newt stared at the goblet that appears in front of him. He knows that Jacob is trying to understand the things that just transpired. The death and betrayal that occur on that tomb.</p>
<p align="justify">‘Tina went outside.’ Jacob said quietly. ‘She can’t look at me man.’ Jacob tried to contain the sob. ‘She’s probably out there beating herself up.’</p>
<p align="justify">Newt pat Jacob’s back and the muggle shudder, he will see Tina later. For now his friend needs him. ‘You know she’s the one who save me back then.’ Jacob continue, voice sad. ‘She pulled me out of that tomb.’  </p>
<p align="justify">‘I’m so sorry Jacob.’ Newt lowered his head and start fiddling with his fingers. ‘I’m the one who brought you there. And I just left you alone.’ He felt guilty; he dragged Jacob all the way to Paris for a very selfish reason of seeing Tina again, and left him to his own accord when he chases Tina around.</p>
<p align="justify">‘Nah.’ Jacob waves his hand. ‘I went there with the same reason as you buddy.’ He sighed.</p>
<p align="justify">They both became quite, Jacob focus his eyes on a kidney pie. ‘You should eat Jacob.’ Newt told him after a moment seeing that the plate in front of the baker is empty. ‘Hogwarts serves the best kidney pie.’</p>
<p align="justify">‘I never should have let her go Newt.’ Jacob said instead and Newt felt himself tearing up when Jacob’s shoulder tremble. ‘I should have hold on to her.’</p>
<p align="justify">Newt took a quick glance at his brother. ‘I guess a lot of people made decisions that night.’ He can only say.</p>
<p align="justify">‘She’s too kind to be on that side.’ Jacob choked. ‘Queeni she –’ he shudders. ‘she asked me to be with her.’ He said and started stuffing his mouth with food to muffle his cry. Newt felt his heart breaking at the sight of Jacob, his cheek puff from the amount of food while tears flow continuously on his eyes.</p>
<p align="justify">‘Jacob.’ Newt tries to pry away the piece of bread his friend tries to reach. Nagini might have been listening for she started sobbing on her hands and Kama awkwardly pats her back trying to comfort her.</p>
<p align="justify">Jacob continues mumbling words that Newt could not understand. And he watches helplessly at his friend. ‘You should go to Tina.’ Jacob said after taking a large gulp of pumpkin juice. The side of his mouth and fingers greasy with oil.</p>
<p align="justify">Newt flinch, he’s been thinking that already. He wanted to go and see Tina if she’s okay. But he can’t leave Jacob alone, he’s his friend. He sticks with him and helps him around, and it will be very selfish of him to leave Jacob alone so that he can just talk to Tina. But apart from being his love, Tina is his friend too. And both Jacob and Tina lost Queenie.</p>
<p align="justify">He guesses that’s the price of gaining friends.</p>
<p align="justify">‘I’ll be fine Newt.’ Jacob said. ‘Food comforts me, that’s why I’m eating you know.’ He added wiping his tear stained cheeks with his sleeves, but the tears keeps on falling. ‘I love her with all my heart and I know her for just a short time.’ Jacob sniffed and continues. ‘But Tina, she’s family to her.’ He cleared his throat. ‘I wanted to talk to her you know. She and her sister got angry with each other because of me. But I can’t right now, I think she do too.’</p>
<p align="justify">Would it be bad for Newt if he will to leave Jacob his first friend so that he can talk to Tina? He admits to himself that he’s been ignoring Jacob’s needs, barely listening to him when he was talking at the Parisian shop. To be honest he don’t know what Jacob’s been saying all that time, because he was very busy thinking about Tina.</p>
<p align="justify">Despite having problems of his own with Queenie, and even if he says that he went with Newt to Paris to look for Queenie, he never forgets to offer advice towards Newt. Now that the magizoologist think about it, he never remembers giving advice to Jacob at all.</p>
<p align="justify">Now despite his sadness of losing his love, he still is encouraging Newt to go and sought out Tina.</p>
<p align="justify">And for once, Newt tried not to be selfish for the sake of his friend. He reaches out and places a reassuring hand on Jacob’s shoulder. ‘I’ll talk to Tina tomorrow.’ He said and filled his plate with sandwiches. ‘I think its best that I leave her alone for awhile.’</p>
<p align="justify">‘But –.’ Jacob tried to argue.</p>
<p align="justify">‘You’re my friend too Jacob.’ Newt smiled. ‘One thing I’ve learned from taking care of different magical creatures. You can’t take care of them, all at the same time. You need to make time for everyone.’ He added.</p>
<p align="justify">Jacob grins and they shared a quite laughter before continued eating.</p>
