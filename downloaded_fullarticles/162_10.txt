    <p align="center">Draco has always been <strong><em>possessive</em></strong>.<br/>If he saw anything he liked, he will want it. No ifs, ands or buts! That’s the way it had been the first time he saw Harry. Actually, he just wanted to get his uniform made and leave, but then he noticed the slim little boy. His father and mother explained to him over and over again, that there was nothing wrong with liking a boy as long as he was fertile. The magical world is tolerant of sexuality, being homosexual was a very normal thing.<br/>He liked right away the little boy with the glasses that hide his beautiful green eyes. He liked his little nose, which captured the unfamiliar smell of the shop and he liked his beautiful curved lips, which were just inviting for kissing. He wanted to stretch out his hand and just keep on brushing the young man’s hair. He wanted to talk to him and stay close to him just to keep staring at him and challenge anyone who came too close or looked at him wrong or too long. He actually wanted to make friends with the boy, stand by him and make sure that he, whose name he doesn’t know, would be in his arms in the near future. That he is just 11 is the least of his problems. But he wanted to introduce himself, even more, so he decided to open his mouth and say his name after watching the small boy standing helpless and frightened in the area.<br/>“I am Draco. And you?” He stretched<br/>his hand out to clasp the kids.<br/>“H-Harry… My name is Harry.” The boy, Harry, reached out his hand as well and took the blond boy’s hand in his own.<br/>Overwhelmed by the softness of his opponent’s voice, he slowly began to talk to the dark-haired one. So he discovered that he had grown up with Muggles, but that he had wizards as parents or that he had never had anything to do with them and he just found out about the wizarding world that Hagrid brought him to.<br/>The blond swore to thank the half-giant. Because he brought him his future husband, or so he hoped, at least, it would be appropriate to say thank you. Even a Malfoy has to say thank you now and then!<br/>“Which house do you want to end up in?” He asked his interlocutor.<br/>“W-What? I- What do you mean, houses?” He said, scratching his chin in embarrassment.<br/>“Didn’t Hagrid explain that to you? I’ll take it from here. There are four houses at Hogwarts: Gryffindor: the particularly stupid ones because they do things without thinking,<br/>Ravenclaw: who are know it alls<br/>Hufflepuff: the cowards, can´t really do anything,<br/>And there best house, in my opinion, the house of Slytherin: the cunning ones, who were proud of their wizard lineage.” He declared excitedly, hoping that Harry would end up in his favourite house.<br/>“Well, I’m not really smart at all (he smiled shyly at the male across him) I don’t do anything I’m not convinced of, and I don’t want to be a Hufflepuff!”<br/>“I hope you end up at my house! I’m dying to go to Slytherin!”<br/>“Me too!” He smiled softly.<br/>“My clothes are ready, and my mother is waiting for me outside the door. I’m sorry, I must go. I hope to see you on the Hogwarts Express!”<br/>But before he left, he grabbed his clothes and turned back to Harry to hug him. He gave him a little kiss on the cheek and turned wide grinning to his giggling mother at the door. He looked at the little boy again and blushed himself as he saw Harry with deep red cheeks. It was worth it!</p>
