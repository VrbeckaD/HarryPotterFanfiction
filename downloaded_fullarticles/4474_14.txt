    <p>The graveyard was dark and ominous, shadows everywhere making it hard to see what else could be lurking amongst the headstones. Though there was a manor not far from the graveyard, it held no lights or other sign of life to show it was inhabited. It looked just as grim as the rest of the graveyard, and Harry couldn’t deny there was something terribly familiar about the place. When the vertigo of portkey travel had passed, Harry sat up with a frown, puzzled as to why they were here of all places when they’d just been at Hogwarts. But, more than anything, he couldn't fathom why he was filled with such a feeling of dread and foreboding. It wasn't a logical feeling, but, instead, an instinctual one that had his fingers shaking and the need to run burning in his mind and legs. Instead, he stayed sitting and turned as much as he could to his companion.</p><p>"Cedric?"</p><p>The answer was a soft groan as the young man sat up, wiping the dirt from his eyes and forehead. When he realized where the two had ended up, he frowned too. "Where... Where are we?"</p><p>Harry shook his head, pushing his glasses up his nose. They were a bit crooked from the portkey's rough landing and dirty from his tumble through the maze, but having them on and being able to see <em>somewhat </em>was calming. “I don't know, but I have a really bad feeling. We should go...”</p><p>Despite the unease of the situation, Harry was a bit relieved to have someone older with him for once. It was odd, though. He was used to being alone during his adventures or with people around his age, everyone older than him had always found a way to let him down. With Cedric, though, it was almost nice to let him take charge. He held out a hand to the other, smile small as he looked at him.</p><p>"Help me up?"</p><p>Cedric smiled in return and took the offered hand, pulling Harry up and quickly wrapping an arm around the unstable boy. Harry tried not to wince when he put pressure on his bad leg, but it was a close thing. It had been a dull throb until then, easily ignored until he was stood upright. Now the pain was back, deeper than he realized and harder to disregard. Cedric patted his hip where his arm was curled around his waist in what the older boy hoped was a comforting gesture. "Come on, let's go home."</p><p>The words – and the thought of Hogwarts – made his smile a bit bigger despite the situation. Of all the places he’d been to, the castle was the only one that always made him feel the most welcome. He wasn’t too sure, but he thought that’s what made a home, and he couldn’t wait to get back to his. They started making their way slowly toward the Cup, Harry gripping the hand on his shoulder as he hobbled along. They were mere yards from the cup when a sharp, white-hot spike of pain pierced his skull making him cry out. He lost his grip on Cedric's hand and suddenly he was falling, only the arm around his waist keeping him from hitting the ground.</p><p>Cedric's voice was loud and concerned in his ear. "H-harry? Harry, what's wrong!?"</p><p>Harry blinked the tears from his eyes, the pain a haze that made it hard for him to respond. He wiped the tears away with his hand only to realize it was blood, dripping from his scar and slipping into his eyes. The dread that filled him was like a lead weight in his stomach, taking his breath away as quickly as the pain. Slowly, he turned to look behind them and was horrified to see a squat – and easily recognizable – man holding a tiny bundle swathed in black. Harry's lips were suddenly dry, and he found himself with nothing to say.</p><p>The voice that spoke wasn't Cedric's or Wormtails but instead came from the bundle. It was high pitched and more of a hiss than a normal voice, but both Cedric and Harry understood the words well enough.</p><p>"Kill the spare."</p><p>Wormtail raised his wand, unfamiliar and dangerous, and Harry did the only thing he could think of. He took as deep a breath as he could, gathering his strength, and acted.</p><p>"Avada Kedavra!"</p><p>Green light, a poisonous color that briefly bathed the dark graveyard in sickly light, shot from the end of the wand. As soon as the wand began to glow Harry had his hands-on Cedric's side, pushing him hard away. The teenager stumbled, looking shocked, but before Harry could fall with him, the green light struck him. And he fell.</p><p>Silence followed, the only living people in the graveyard struck numb with shock or horror. It was a true quiet, not even the nature of the graveyard stirring to make a sound. Cedric, still laying with his arms braced on the ground, could only stare at Harry's body (the thought that this was now just a body made him choke) in white-faced horror. Wormtail whimpered as the weight of what he’d just done hit him, body trembling with his fear. Voldemort, the tiny and seemingly insignificant bundle in Wormtail's arms, was seething. That was his kill, and this blithering fool had stolen it from him. His magic reacted, rising like a wrathful tide to constrict and kill at his bidding. But, in this form, the magic could only rise. Using that magic was another matter entirely. He was opening his mouth, ready to enact vengeance on the pitiful creature who held him, when he noticed the spare's breathing change. Curious, Voldemort turned his head as best he could, and he let out a wheezy little breath in shock.</p><p>Tiny black specks floated from the boy, the most pouring out his mouth and from his wounded leg, coalescing above him. The black shape began to take form, becoming vaguely humanoid even as it hunched over Harry's body like a dog would. When the black specks solidified, the creature appeared nothing like any animal Cedric, or the Dark Lord for that matter, had ever seen. It appeared more like a human than an animal, but too tall and far too thin to be human or any kind of known magical creature. Its body was like a skeleton enveloped in black bandages, almost mummy-like, with a looser set of bandages, these ones like a cloak, wrapped around its frame and floated behind it in a nonexistent wind. It looked every bit how Cedric had pictured death and he found himself struck still by his fear. Killing curse green glowed from where eyes should be as the creature glanced at Cedric, turning its head completely to the left to stare at him. The face had no real definition, just a roughly oval shape that ended in more or a point where a human’s chin would be. No nose or visible lips, just two green glowing points that kept Cedric locked in place. It only stared for a second, but it felt like an eternity to the teenager. The glow seemed to peer into his very soul, leaving his body cold inside. Quite suddenly, the creature shrieked, the sound alien and edged with a hiss, and lunged itself at Wormtail and his bundle. Voldemort was screaming, voice shrill and dropping into parseltongue with every other word.</p><p>"Fool! Kill <em>it, stop</em> it!"</p><p>Wormtail, hands shaking and voice a quivering mess, shot out as many spells as he could. Not all connected, and those that did only made the creature grunt and shake its head. In the end, Wormtail only got a few spells out before the creature had struck with a hand that was mostly claws at Wormtail's arm, severing it completely. Wormtail screamed in pain, blood immediately flowing from the wound. Both arm and bundle fell to the ground and Voldemort shot out curses of his own, though they did little good.</p><p>“<em>Nagini! Nagini, come to your master!"</em></p><p>A seam appeared in the lower half of the black creature’s face as it bared its teeth at Wormtail. There was the unmistakable scent of defecation before the trembling man collapsed in a dead faint, blood flowing fast from the severed arm. Cedric, who hadn't known the creature had a mouth, would have been horrified to see the Glasgow grin the creature flashed at Wormtail. Instead of normal teeth, or just pointed teeth, the creature had needle-like teeth that were far too big and far too numerous for the mouth it filled.</p><p>Nagini appeared with a hiss, the snake massive compared to the body and bundle she shot between to curl protectively around her master. But, compared to the black being before them, the snake seemed so small.</p><p>She hissed loudly. <em>“Go. Leave my master or I will bite! My poison will hurt and kill, so leave!”</em> Even as her instincts told her to flee, the bond to her master kept her coiled around him ready to protect.</p><p>There wasn’t much Cedric could see from where he hovered protectively over Harry's body, but what he could see left him paralyzed, his mind frozen in shock. His only thought was that he had to live and return Harry's body. He couldn’t leave Harry here with a creature that could destroy him so easily, not when there were so many who would mourn him. Not when Harry had a family who would demand a body, and proof, that their loved one had perished.</p><p>The black creature warbled, and it took Cedric a moment to realize it was laughing. What followed was a hissing, odd sound, more like an echo than a true sound. Cedric didn't know what was going on, but the snake seemed to recoil slightly and the bundle she’d wrapped around had long gone silent. The sound was oddly familiar and it took Cedric a moment to realize why: the creature was speaking Parseltongue.</p><p>
  <em>“You dare hurt me and mine. Threaten to kill me and mine. Twice you have succeeded, many more times you have tried. I will take me and mine’s penance now.”</em>
</p><p>And with that, the creature struck, cutting the head off the snake as the snake lunged to bite. The snake barely had time to sink her fangs into the creature before head and body fell to the ground, writhing as the last bits of life and magic flowed out of her body. The creature said nothing as it next crushed the bundle beneath its foot and proceeded to stomp and pounce it into the ground, more cat-like now than the personification of death. One could almost imagine it's cloak-like bandages as a tail.</p><p>When the bundle was nothing more than a pancake, flattened into bloody, squishy cloth, the creature turned to Cedric and grinned. Cedric felt a little faint at the sight, but held his ground over Harry and watched as the creature's body slowly turned to black specks and disappeared. The graveyard was silent once more, though this time the silence was more natural. A light wind danced between the headstones, blowing leaves and debris over the gory scene not far away. Cedric felt sick, tears dotting his eyes as he covered his mouth, the reality of the situation finally catching up with him. Harry was dead and he had witnessed a murder. <strong>Harry was dead-.</strong></p><p>Harry's eyes opened wide, suddenly taking in a sharp breath before he was breathing normally as if he’d just been holding his breath instead of dead. His eyes seemed to glow killing curse green before fading back to their normal hue (though Cedric chalks it up to a trick of the light and shock, later he isn’t quite so sure about his reasoning). For a moment, Harry just stared up at Cedric without seeing him or anything else, until his eyes widened. The young teen sat up too fast in his haste and shock, almost knocking his head against the older teens. Cedric probably wouldn’t have felt the pain, his mouth open wide and tears still hanging in his eyes ready to fall.</p><p>"Cedric! A-are you okay? What happened? N-never mind, we have to go!" Harry was already tugging on his hand, trying to get Cedric to stand, not even noticing his leg was healed until both were standing, and Harry noticed that Cedric was no longer panicking. Instead, he just looked shocked, pale and grey, but unharmed. Harry frowned, confused as to why, until he turned to see the bloody scene behind him. Cedric’s eyes widened, momentarily forgetting what had just happened (Harry had died-) as he realized a fourteen-year-old was going to see this, and he quickly turned Harry around. "I... I-I’ll explain later. C-come on. We... We should go. Now."</p><p>"But... Cedric, what...?"</p><p>Cedric's expression was tired, almost pleading. "Please, Harry. Let's go home."</p><p>Harry peered into his eyes, staying silent, and nodded slowly. "Alright... Are you okay, though?"</p><p>Cedric wanted to laugh at that because no, he was not okay. He had just witnessed the most horrific thing he'd ever seen, which included Harry's death, and a part of him had almost thought that Harry had done it. But, no, Harry couldn't have when he stood before him so willing to protect and looking almost naive. He took a deep breath and forced a smile. "I'll be fine as soon as we get back. Now... Come on, we should get going." And he quickly led Harry to the portkey, still holding his hand as the two of them took hold of the cup at the same time. Cedric never once noticed how Harry seemed a bit different, his shadow just a bit darker, and his eyes just a bit brighter</p><p> </p>
