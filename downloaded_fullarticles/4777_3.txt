          <div class="userstuff"><p>To say Lucius Malfoy was not having a good day, would have been an understatement.</p><p>The raid that he'd been given to conduct, had not gone well, to say the least. As a result, the Dark Lord had been furious at him, and had even subjected him to a few moments of the Cruciatus Curse.</p><p>He was exhausted and disgruntled when he sat down on his mahogany chair in front of a warm fire that evening.</p><p>"Tired, are we?" his sister-in-law asked, a silhouette stepping out of the flickering shadows that the flames cast around the large room.</p><p>Lucius smirked wearily, staring back into the fire. That was all the reply she needed.</p><p>"We really must fix that. Can't have you looking so worn-out in front of the Dark Lord, tomorrow."</p><p>She unwrapped her midnight blue cloak and draped it on the arm of the chair opposite his, stepping closer to him, slowly.

They both knew, from the look in his eyes, what he wanted.</p><p>"What she doesn't know can't hurt her, can it, now?" Her crimson lips hovered dangerously close to his, while her other hand found its way downwards.</p><p>"This is hardly appropriate, Bellaâ€¦" Lucius tried one last time.</p><p>"Then you know you can count on me to misbehave," she purred, closing the distance between them.</p></div>
