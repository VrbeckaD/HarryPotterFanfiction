    <p><em>Harry Potter is a moron. </em>This was a simple and understandable assumption made by Draco Malfoy. He was proud, loud, obnoxious and just generally annoying. The only reason anyone liked him at all was because of that stupid scar on his head and something about his mother’s eyes, which meant a grand total of nothing to Draco. Sure he was also kind of cute and years of flying left him pretty well built, but he was still a short, ruffle haired moron who probably couldn’t tell the difference between a bowtruckle and a hippogriff.</p>
<p>
Despite all of this, Draco required Harry Potter’s assistance. Now Draco did not consider himself someone who needed things from others. Actually he would rather refer to himself as independent, regardless of what anyone else thought. Regardless, he had messed up, royally screwed himself even. He had convinced his parents not to set him up with a date on the grounds he had someone he was already intending on seeing. It wasn’t that he had anything against his parents’ taste, just that he had never found girls overly interesting. He, in fact had no one and when asked for their name, Draco had panicked. It was the most stupid thing he could do in that moment, but he said “Harry.” This, of course, led his parents to immediately assume he meant Harry Potter and before Draco could even think to deny it he was being chastised by his mother for never coming out to her sooner and his father was demanding that Potter come over for dinner as soon as possible. It was certainty not the response he expected, but it wasn’t a bad one. He didn’t have to go on an arranged date with a girl who was, frankly, about as entertaining as a piece of bread and equally as attractive, so it was technically a win. It did leave him with the small issue of Harry Potter being expected at his house for dinner. </p>
<p>
This is what left Draco Malfoy standing at Harry Potter’s desk. He was an Auror now and to say the uniform looked good on him was a bit of an understatement. Despite the shiny new uniform, he still had that messy ruffled hair and stupid scar on his head. Draco would be a liar if he said that the he thought that Potter should actually wear the jacket properly instead of leaving it open or that he should take his feet off the table. Somehow these things just seemed to add up to create a relaxed kind of sex appeal that Draco would never admit to feeling for a second. </p>
<p>
“Isn’t that jacket meant to be done up?” Draco asked when he entered the room. </p>
<p>
“What are you doing here, Malfoy? Need me to arrest you?” He was definitely joking, but for some reason the image of Harry putting him in handcuffs crossed his mind. It was an unexpected image, but not a bad one by any means. He wasn’t going to let that show through his façade of boredom and pure displeasure at being there, no matter how much the git grinned with, admittedly, sort of distracting lips. </p>
<p> 
“No,” Draco replied as deadpan as he could manage. “I’m afraid I-” His pride caught the words in his throat, he pulled at his cuffs before continuing, “-I need your help?” </p>
<p>
The smile was gone from Harry’s lips, and he seemed mildly concerned. He also looked mostly suspicious, but that was expected, the unmistakable concern was not. Potter’s eyes trailed up and down Draco’s body, making him suddenly and intensely self-conscious. “What do you need?” </p>
<p>
“I need you to come over for dinner tomorrow night,” Draco replied, choosing to look at the wall to his left instead of Potter. </p>
<p>
“Why?” Harry asked. </p>
<p>
Draco felt inexplicably angry about this. He pushed that down and instead attempted to explain, “I have, mistakenly and unknowingly, convinced my parents,” He took a deep breath and then finished the sentence as quickly as possible, “That we are dating.” He shot a glance to Harry to see his mouth hanging open in surprise. Draco quickly shot his eyes back away and heard Harry laughing. Clearly one of them was finding this hysterical. </p>
<p>
“You’re joking, right?” Harry asked. Draco shot him a pained look that confirmed that he was, in fact, not joking. Harry threw his head back, howling with laughter. “Why can’t you just tell them that we aren’t dating?” </p>
<p>
“They insist each time that they aren’t concerned by my dating you and that I needn’t hid it from them.” Harry didn’t seem able to make any noise for a second. He was just sitting there with his head back and his shoulders shaking. He leaned back in his chair, laughing so hard that he fell to the floor. Draco felt his lips twitch up in a small grin seeing that. </p>
<p>
Ron rushed in after hearing the loud thud of Harry hitting the floor. He looked a little dazed, but there was a hint of confusion on his features when he saw Harry on the floor practically squealing with laughter and Draco standing there with a small grin. </p>
<p>
“What the bloody hell did you do to him?” Ron snarled at Draco. Draco’s smile fell and he shook his head. </p>
<p>
“I didn’t <em> do </em> anything,” He replied defensively. Potter had finally calmed down a little and looked up to them, another long breath of laughter forcing its way up when he saw Draco. </p>
<p>
“Like <em> hell </em> you didn’t,” Ron growled. </p>
<p>
“He,” Harry started and then had to stop as another laughing fit started up again, “He told his parents that we’re dating.” </p>
<p>
Ron seemed to only find the idea repulsive and sneered at Draco, “What’d you do that for?” </p>
<p>
Draco’s eyes had never rolled so hard in his life. He thought they might roll into the back of his head, “That isn’t at all what happened.” Harry was now snorting. Draco hadn’t actually heard Harry laughing like this before and he found the sound surprisingly pleasant. Ron was looking at Harry as if he were mad, but there was a ghost of a smile on his face. “I unknowingly convinced them that I was dating Potter.” </p>
<p>
“How’d you manage that?” </p>
<p>
“Do you know what unknowingly means?” Draco asked in retort. A dark shadow fell over Ron’s face for a second, then he stepped out of Harry’s office. </p>
<p>
Draco felt a little relieved that he was gone only to hear his voice magically amplified so that, he guessed, everyone in the ministry could hear it, “Draco Malfoy has <em> unknowingly </em> convinced his parents that he and Harry Potter are dating!” Draco was ready to murder him; however, he was distracted by Harry. </p>
<p>
“I’m crying, oh my god,” Harry wheezed, wiping at his eyes while he stood up and set his chair back up. “Oh my god, I haven’t laughed like that in a long time.” He still had a stupid grin on his face and every time he’d look at Draco it got a little bigger and he seemed to hold back another laughing fit.
“Will you just come to dinner tomorrow night?” Draco finally asked. Harry snorted a little but nodded. “Come around at six. Don’t be late and try to wear something nice,” He looked Harry over, “Assuming you have anything nice to wear.” He didn’t wait to see if Harry took offense and left. 
That night, six o’clock rolled around and Harry Potter had not arrived the very second the hand struck. Draco was suddenly so very sure that Harry was not coming. Two seconds later there was a knock at the door and while a sudden anxiety tightened his stomach he tried to assure himself it wasn’t Potter, that he was not coming and that he would open the door to someone completely unexpected. He opened the door and there was Potter, dressed in his best, which was… decent. He certainly looked amazing in it, but jeans and suit jacket isn’t quite what Draco had in mind. Still he was, if nothing else, in character. </p>
<p>
“Harry,” Draco said with a lot more relief than he intended. </p>
<p>
“Draco,” Harry replied. He came in and glanced over to where Lucius was standing before putting his hand on Draco’s waist and pressing a small kiss to his cheek. His lips were lightly chapped but still soft and warm. Draco’s head was swimming in shock, pleasant surprise and the reality that he had just been kissed by Harry Potter. </p>
<p>
Dinner was filled with awkward, tense conversation. Harry had been on the opposite side of the war to the Malfoy family and the knowledge that they would have defiantly killed each other if given the chance definitely hung heavily over every conversation. During one of the may silent pauses, Draco became aware that Potter wasn’t a great actor. He kept fighting down a stupid grin or coughing to hide the occasional laugh and Draco knew exactly what it was about. He had to find this entire situation rather funny, he had found Draco’s confession of the evets leading up to this moment utterly, breath takingly hilarious, so why wouldn’t he be holding back a fit of giggles right now. </p>
<p>
“Something funny, Mr Potter?” Lucius asked, having noticed exactly what Draco had. </p>
<p>
Harry smirked a little more freely now, “Just a joke Draco told me. I can’t get it out of my head.” </p>
<p>
“Then please; share,” Lucius encouraged a little more enthusiastically than Draco thought he meant to. </p>
<p>
“Yes, Harry, tell them,” Draco said, letting his eyebrows raise briefly. Harry spotted it, he was sure. </p>
<p>  
“No, no, Draco,” Harry replied with his grin growing a little, “It’s your joke, you tell them.” </p>
<p>
“I would, but you’re the funny one,” Draco replied, trying not to grit his teeth. </p>
<p>
“I hate to disagree,” Harry replied seemingly having the same issue Draco did with not gritting his teeth, “But I insist you tell them.” </p>
<p>
Draco couldn’t help clicking his tongue in frustration. “I would, however I don’t remember how it goes.” Harry seemed to know where this was going and briefly let his eyes squint into a scowl, “But since you can’t seem to forget it, why don’t you tell them.” Draco could see on Harry’s face that he had won and a satisfied grin grew on his face. </p>
<p>
Harry cleared his throat and then started, “Well, a man and his girlfriend are talking. They both have something they want to tell each other. The man says, “We’ve been together for three years now. I think you’re perfect and I love you so much. You mean the world to me,”” Draco was suddenly aware that Harry was holding eye contact with him, but he wasn’t sure if it held any actual significance or if he was just trying to be intimidating. ““I think I would die if you left me. That’s why I bought you that car and that house and all those dresses. I love giving you gifts because of the way you smile when you get them. So today I bought something special for you, I bought you a ring. I want you to be my wife,” Then his girlfriend says,” He looked to Draco expectantly. </p>
<p>
Draco had to deliver a punch line he didn’t know. He really wanted to reach across the table and choke him. Instead he kept the eye contact and said, “I want to murder you.” Harry smiled at this although his smile faded a little when Lucius and Narcissa both started laughing. He glanced at them and Draco followed suit. It wasn’t even fake laughter, they seemed to think it was priceless comedy gold. </p>
<p>
When dinner was over they all started drinking wine. Draco was grateful for that, the wine made his parents a little more talkative and settled the awkward silences. Eventually Narcissa put on some music and she and Lucius danced around the room together. Harry and Draco were quite comfortable sitting back watching in silence, until Narcissa began insisting that they join in. Harry was quick to assure her that he was comfortable where he was, a little too quick. </p>
<p>
“Do you even know how to dance?” Draco asked. Harry went a little red and Draco thought back to the yule ball, or more importantly Harry’s abysmal dancing at the yule ball. </p>
<p>
“I mean, I technically know the steps,” Harry replied defensively and Draco couldn’t help from letting out a snorting laugh. Narcissa was pulling Harry up before he had any chance to refuse. From Draco’s experience, his mother wasn’t someone you argue with. He watched while Harry was taught how to dance, occasionally laughing when Harry fumbled, which was pretty much the whole time. </p>
<p>
Finally, Narcissa decided that he was good enough to dance with Draco. Lucius and Narcissa were dancing (and drinking) circles around Harry and Draco. Harry was meant to be leading, with his distractingly warm hand resting on Draco’s waist, but he stepped on Draco so many times that Draco took over. It made it a little easier to dance since Harry was shorter and just had to follow what Draco did. That didn’t mean that he stopped stepping on Draco or that he stopped just being straight up confused but it certainly helped. What didn’t help was that they were still drinking. They were both on a light buzz by now and Harry seemed to be a bit of a sleepy kind of tipsy, although they were steadily moving out of the realm of tipsy. Draco, admittedly was pretty much exactly the same. This caused the two of them to move ever so slightly closer every now and again in some attempt to hold each other up so they didn’t fall, until they were basically chest to chest. Narcissa noticed this and, probably because she was drunk, demanded that Harry spend the night. She insisted that he couldn’t get home in his current state and then ushered the two of them upstairs to Draco’s room, shutting the door firmly behind them. </p>
<p>
Now they were both alone in Draco’s room. Draco was still buzzing a little and couldn’t help a little laugh as he leaned against the door. Harry, however, was not laughing. Instead he just seemed to be standing there looking a little dazed. </p>
<p>
“This was a lot more fun than I expected,” Harry said with a small laugh. </p>
<p>
Draco wasn’t really listening but nodded. He was fumbling a little with his jacket button until he successfully got it off and let himself flop on the bed. Harry followed suit and flopped on the bed beside him. The two glanced at each other and started laughing softly. Harry was mostly on his side, but Draco was lying flat on his back. </p>
<p>
“I can’t believe you convinced them we were dating,” Harry muttered. </p>
<p>
“Well, I mean, I think we just kind of just reassured them,” Draco replied in the same muttered tone. He glanced up to Harry. His face looked warm, slightly flushed red and filled by a grin. His lips looked soft too, even if they were a little chapped. It took Draco a moment to realise that he was staring at Harry’s lips and quickly redirected his eyes to the ceiling. </p>
<p>
“Draco,” Harry’s voice sounded a little hoarse. Draco glanced back to see Harry’s green eyes trained on his own. His lips felt suddenly isolated and tingled with a desire that he couldn’t quite put a name to for a moment. He felt his face turn bright red and was hit with the realisation that he wanted Potter to kiss him. He really, really wanted Harry to lean over and kiss him, but they just stared at each other. Draco felt his breathing pick up a little and he watched long enough to see Harry’s breathing was similar. He felt so sure that Harry was going to kiss him, he could practically feel Harry’s lips on his, yet Harry wasn’t moving. The was about to pass, Harry wasn’t going to kiss him. Then why had he called for his attention? <em> He’s a git. </em></p>
<p>
“Harry?” Draco finally asked, a little confused. This must have been all Harry was waiting for and he moved forward and pressed his lips to Draco’s. They were just as soft as Draco thought they would be. Even if they were a little chapped. Draco’s head was a moment behind his reality and he realised that he wasn’t kissing back. Harry was pulling away just a little, but Draco caught him before he could go too far. </p>
<p>
Harry seemed to gain a confidence boost after that and eagerly kissed him. Draco was about shift to his side so it would be a little more comfortable when Harry practically climbed on top of him. Draco’s breath hitched in his throat, feeling Harry’s legs straddling him and the bend in the mattress where Harry was holding himself up with one arm. His other hand was on Draco’s waist; Draco could feel the heat through his shirt. He let his own hands raise, one curling up into Harry’s messy hair and the other on Harry’s back. His hair was soft and slipped through his fingers as they curled. He felt Harry’s tongue flick over his lips and couldn’t hold back a soft moan when he opened his mouth. He started tentatively letting his own tongue move a little to meet Harry’s. Without much warning, Harry stopped kissing him. </p>
<p>
The two stared at each other for a moment, Draco could feel his own lips were red and swollen and saw Harry’s were in a similar state. This caused his stomach to tighten a little and he was aware that his pants felt a little tight too. It didn’t help that Harry was sitting right over his crotch. A smirk appeared on Harry’s face, as if confirming that he was aware that Draco was hard. He leaned down to kiss him again, but it was fleeting. Instead he started to kiss Draco’s cheek and toward his jaw. He stopped again and undid a few of the buttons on Draco’s shirt before pressing his lips to Draco’s neck. </p>
<p>
Draco felt his mind go momentarily blank while Harry’s tongue massaged into his neck. The hand he had buried in Harry’s hand softly tugged and he could have sworn he heard Harry growl. If not, then it was a moan caught in his throat. Either way, it made Draco bite his lip. It also made Harry pull back. Draco felt a pout on the edges of his lips and quickly fought it back. His eyes were trained on Harry’s, which were positively smouldering. Harry shifted and his thigh rubbed against Draco’s crotch, causing him to jump up in surprise, but luckily he had been able to hold in the whimper. He looked to Harry to see what looked like a little pout on his face. Draco was thoroughly confused, but the hand that had been on his waist slipped down between his legs. </p>
<p>
Draco barely held back his moan, it came out as a breathy sigh. The feeling of Harry’s hand through his pants, directly on his dick was steadily causing him to lose control over his voice. Harry leaned in close to his ear and whispered, “I want to hear you,” with hot breath. Draco actually titled his head back and nearly moaned just at that. Harry noticed too. He palmed Draco through his pants and muttered in his ear, “Let me hear you moan.” A small noise escaped his throat, not quite a moan so much a heavy sigh. Harry hummed in his ear in a slightly disappointed tone. </p>
<p>
“What if my parents walk past or something?” Draco asked with quiet concern. “Plus, I mean,” His brain felt a little slow, but he forced it to work enough for him to say what was on his mind, “We’re both drunk we shouldn’t be…” He trailed off, gesturing between them. Harry rolled off him and laid on his back, staring up at the ceiling. </p>
<p>
“Right, yeah,” He muttered. Draco still felt tight in his pants, but he ignored it, instead opting to nod along with Harry. “Right,” he muttered again. </p>
<p>
“I mean, I don’t want you to wake up in the morning and realise what we did and regret it or anything,” Draco said, and Harry nodded. </p>
<p>
“Right, I wouldn’t want you to regret anything like that either.” </p>
<p>
“I mean, I probably wouldn’t,” Draco grumbled before he could stop himself. His brain was too slow from the alcohol to realise he had even said it out loud until Harry questioned him. </p>
<p>
“You wouldn’t?” He asked. Draco glanced over and felt a blush creep onto his face. He didn’t respond at first but Potter started prodding. “You said you wouldn’t, didn’t you?” </p>
<p>
 “So what if I did?” Draco finally replied. He tried to ignore how flushed his face felt. </p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t either,” Harry said. The words took a second for Draco to register. He wouldn’t regret it… Really? That didn’t seem right. He shifted to his side and stared at Harry, attempting to appear sceptical but he could feel how much it probably looked like a pout. </p>
<p>
“What makes you so sure?” Harry grinned at this and kissed him again. </p>
<p>
“I’ve wanted to do this for a while,” Harry replied when they broke away. Draco actually jumped a little at the words, he was so genuinely surprised. What could possibly lead Harry Potter to want to do <em> this </em> with <em> him</em>? The idea was too ridiculous for Draco’s drunk brain to really comprehend. Harry, however, didn’t seem concerned. In fact, he looked relieved. He kissed Draco again. </p>
<p>
It didn’t take long for them to end up back in their previous position, although this time Harry had lifted Draco’s legs up over his waist. The position was a little weird at first, but after a little shifting Draco felt Harry’s hard dick through their pants. Harry, obviously, also felt Draco shifting over him as he let out a small moan that made Draco’s heart beat a little faster and he even found a similar sound spilling past his lips. His dick was already painfully hard and straining under his pants which Potter happened to be rubbing with his hand. </p>
<p>
“Is that all it takes to make you moan?” Harry asked in that low, husky voice that Draco was enjoying way too much. Before he knew it, Harry was against his ear making soft moaning sounds against his ear. At first they were genuinely hot and Draco was practically panting, but they steadily got a little bit higher until Draco couldn’t stop himself from laughing. </p>
<p>
He gently smacked Harry’s shoulder, “Cut it out, you sound ridiculous.” Harry was laughing as well as he pulled back so they could look at each other, but still managed to see an opportunity and gave Draco’s dick a firm pump through his pants. Draco’s laugh momentarily mixed with a groan that he could only muffle by clapping a hand over his mouth. Harry was still laughing and he brought his mouth back down to Draco’s neck where his hot breath mixed with his warm lips. </p>
<p>
Draco started shifting his hips again, feeling Harry’s dick rubbing against the underside of his ass was honestly one of the best things he felt. Pretty soon he was steadily bucking his hips up and grinding on Harry’s dick which left Harry, surprisingly, a little speechless. It reduced him to a few soft moans and heavy breathing which Draco was definitely enjoying. As if to stop his own groaning he started kissing Draco again. Eventually he sat back so his weight was on his legs and not his arm and put his hands on Draco’s hips to stop them. </p>
<p>
“Is everything alright?” Draco asked, suddenly concerned. Had he done something wrong? Harry hadn’t shown any signs of wanting him to stop, in fact he thought that Harry seemed rather eager for him to keep going. </p>
<p>
“Everything’s fine, you just need to stop doing that,” Harry answered. Draco sat up so he was resting on his elbows and looked him over; his face was red, his breathing seemed fast and he was moving his crotch away from Draco. It took a second but his brain seemed to catch up to what he was seeing. </p>
<p>
“Merlin’s beard, Potter,” Draco teased. </p>
<p>
“What?” Harry panted. </p>
<p>
“Are you done already?” He lightly poked Harry’s stomach, “You haven’t even gotten your shirt off and your already finished.” </p>
<p>
“I didn’t,” Harry replied a little defensively. </p>
<p>
Draco poked him again, “Oh yeah <em> sure, </em>you need some help cleaning up old man?” Harry didn’t reply, instead he slipped his hand down Draco’s pants and grabbed his dick, making him stop to gasp. </p>
<p>
“I didn’t come in my pants,” Harry said, leaning back down and pressing a brief kiss to Draco’s lips, “But you will.” </p>
<p>
Draco scoffed, “I doubt-” He was cut off as Harry gave his dick a small squeeze which caused him to tilt his head back and moaned. </p>
<p>
“What were you saying, Draco?” Harry asked. Draco let out a whine in reply. He was absurdly close. He was ridiculously, fantastically and laughably close and Harry’s firm hand seemed merciless in his pants. The pressure was building so quickly and he tried his best to hold back, but his hips were already bucking up into Harry’s hand. “God, you look so amazing like this,” Harry muttered. Draco wouldn’t ever admit that Harry’s voice was what brought him over the edge. He also wouldn’t admit that he moaned so loudly that Harry had to kiss him to muffle the sound. </p>
<p>
Draco settled down from the high, steadying his breathing and fetching his wand from his bedside table to vanish the evidence of what had just happened. He was suddenly rather exhausted, although that exhaustion was also mixed with an intense and burning embarrassment. Harry was grinning like the git he was and he kept kissing Draco’s neck and lips. </p>
<p>
“You’re the worst,” Draco muttered. He was a little annoyed that harry had successfully made him come in his pants. Regardless, he thought that he should return the favour and slipped his own hand into Harry’s pants. His hard cock now throbbing in his hand, Draco sat up a little and started stroking. Harry was quick to remove his trousers and underwear so that Draco couldn’t get the same satisfaction he had, which left Draco with a little pout, but also with the full sight of Harry’s legs and dick. </p>
<p>
It was a marvellous sight in Draco’s opinion. His legs were firmly muscled and his hard dick sitting up felt somewhat tempting in ways Draco wasn’t sure he could explain. He wasn’t monstrously large or anything, in fact he was probably only average size, which was in a way comforting to Draco who was also average. They sat up making out while Draco stroked Harry’s dick, applying and taking away pressure at certain points. He made a mental note every time Harry’s breath hitched or he moaned and started to focus a little more on those places. Harry came a lot more quietly than Draco but it clearly took some effort for him to muffle the sound behind his lips. </p>
<p>
Once again, Draco vanished the evidence and the two laid down on the bed. Harry had elected to simply remove his shirt rather than put his pants back on and Draco was not about to start complaining. They stayed up and talked for a few minutes, but they were both so clearly tired that they let the conversation drop off and fell asleep.</p>
