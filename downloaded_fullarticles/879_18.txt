    <p>“Twenty galleons,” Tom said, eyes narrowing at the aged shopkeeper, “for a book this old?”</p><p>The old man bared yellowed teeth. “’S what I said, boy. A rare book, that one. Don’t find it just anyplace.”</p><p>Tom’s lips pursed. It was true, he wouldn’t find a better price anywhere else. The book he wanted was difficult to find - in part because there were so few copies, and in part because it was practically illegal. Still, he had hoped to weasel a lower price out of old Mr. Theed.</p><p>Normally he would not hesitate to spend the money - such knowledge was well worth his meagre savings. But his bosses were stingy, refusing to pay him more than once a month, and this was the last of the money he had to feed himself for the rest of the week.</p><p>Tom fingered his coin purse, eyes lingering longingly on the books, but he knew he couldn’t. Not if he wanted to survive the week. He’d already had to cut into his funds to replace his suit and shoes for work. If he used up the rest, he would most certainly starve.</p><p>He briefly debated attempting to persuade the shopkeeper, but Mr. Theed rarely, if ever, dropped his prices. Tom had shopped here more than enough times to know just how unyielding the man was.</p><p>Tom scowled inwardly. Merlin how he hated this. The humiliation, the loss of knowledge… He avoided looking at Mr. Theed. The man was watching him knowingly, a look that taunted his poverty. He clenched his fist. Then he schooled his expression and tilted his chin upwards, not willing to be seen as weak.</p><p>“I refuse to pay such an obscene price for a mere book,” he said instead, lip curling derisively. He saw Mr. Theed raise his eyebrows and open his mouth to reply when an arm reached around him and dropped twenty galleons onto the counter.</p><p>“Here,” a cheerful voice rang from behind him. “It’s - er, payback for the last time. Um, you remember, don’t you? When you helped me out?”</p><p>Tom turned, eyes narrowed. He did not recognize the man, nor did he remember helping him out. Tom was not the charitable sort, after all. And even if he was, he certainly did not have the funds to help others.</p><p>He felt further unsettled when he realized that he hadn’t even noticed anyone waiting behind him and he didn’t like the fact that a stranger had been able to sneak up on him so easily.</p><p>His eyes fell upon a young man who looked vaguely familiar. He was shorter than Tom, with messy hair and bright green eyes that were mostly hidden behind a round pair of spectacles. He might have looked a little more put together were it not for the fact that his sweater was about two sizes too large. A fine material, Tom noted, and it dwarfed the man in an oddly endearing way, hanging past his hips where it hadn’t been tucked into his trousers. One of the arms was bunched at his elbow, but the other hung down past his fingertips. </p><p>Tom eyed the man speculatively. He received an open smile in response. Tom decided to return the gesture, pleasant and friendly. “Of course, I simply hadn’t expected you to remember.” He turned to Mr. Theed And nodded at the book. More than once before he had been approached by a customer at Borgin &amp; Burkes who wanted to treat him in return for certain <em> favours </em>. Tom was no stranger to such carnal desires, not that he ever allowed his customers to lay their hands on him. He wondered where this particular interaction would lead him, but was well versed in enough dangerous spells to protect himself if need be. </p><p>The shopkeeper eyed them suspiciously but grunted and swept away the coins before wrapping the book in thick paper and handing it over to Tom.</p><p>“Thank you,” Tom gave him a stiff smile. He waited for the stranger to pay for his item - a curious black stone - before joining the man as he exited the shop. He was intrigued, of course, but also suspicious. The man looked so deceptively harmless, his expression open and clear, eyes bright and cheerful. An excellent actor, Tom admitted. But he would find out what this man wanted, and if it was not something Tom was willing to pay, then… well, Tom would simply have to deal with him.</p><p>“I hope you don’t mind,” the man said as they stepped back into Knockturn Alley. “I didn’t mean to presume that you needed - or wanted - my help, it’s just… well,” he gave an easy shrug - a gentle roll of his shoulders. “I thought you should have the book if you wanted it, even if it was a bit expensive.”</p><p>Tom raised his eyebrows. “That is… very kind of you. To do so much for a stranger.”</p><p>The man held out a hand “I’m Harry. Harry Potter.”</p><p>Tom took his hand a little slowly. “Tom Riddle.”</p><p>Potter shook his hand enthusiastically, then gave a bright laugh. “There, not strangers anymore.”</p><p>Tom couldn’t help but stare. <em> What an odd man </em>. “Do you do this for every stranger you meet?” He couldn’t help but ask. The man seemed kind, most certainly. But Tom knew better than to believe such masks. He had ruled Slytherin, after all. If anyone could spot deception, it would be him.</p><p>Harry Potter ran a hand through his messy hair, looking a little unsure. “I mean, not really? Just - well, if I see someone who could use a bit of help, I figure - why not?”</p><p><em> Why not </em>. Tom could think of a dozen reasons why not, but of course he wouldn’t say that out loud - in case Potter decided to rescind his magnanimity. </p><p>“It is very kind of you,” Tom hedged, “to give without expecting anything in return.” </p><p>Potter shrugged again, and Tom found the casual gesture oddly fitting for the young man. <b>“</b> I don’t do such things to put others in my debt <b>.</b>” He must have seen something in Tom’s expression because he then ran a hand through his hair. “Look, I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable about the whole situation. So how about this. If you really want to pay me back, then lend me your company for lunch and I’ll consider us even.”</p><p>Tom blinked at the request, then curved his lips into a smile. “Of course, I would be most delighted.” <em> Delighted to pick you apart. Delighted to see just what motives you could have, dear Harry Potter </em>. Tom smiled a little wider.</p><p>He received a blinding grin in return. “Great! I know a fantastic place. My treat, so don’t worry about anything.” </p><p>Tom pursed his lips at the taunt, but said nothing as he eyed Potter’s back. It was a little too warm out to be wearing a sweater, but he had to admit that the material looked soft and comfortable. The green-eyed man certainly didn’t seem bothered by the late summer heat. </p><p>“I think you’ll like it,” Potter was saying, as if he had known Tom for years instead of minutes. “It’s a cafe connected to my favourite bookstore. Fantastic food.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes narrowed. He had worked at Borgin &amp; Burkes’ all summer and knew both Diagon Alley and Knockturn Alley fairly well. And yet he had never before heard of a place like this. </p><p>They wound deeper down the alley and despite his reservations, Tom found himself sticking close to Harry to avoid the prying eyes and long-fingered reach of the hags that lurked in the corners and the questionable creatures that roamed the street. Still, he fingered his wand, eyes sharp upon his surroundings and his odd companion. The man was confident in his strides despite being in such a disreputable area and he even nodded at one of the filthy street vendors. Merlin, was he perhaps following a madman?</p><p>“Just up here,” Potter glanced back at Tom, his easy smile still in place. “I promise I’m not leading you here to kidnap you,” he continued, as if reading Tom’s thoughts.</p><p>Tom schooled his expression as he nodded. There were enough other people close by who would hear his screams. And if he truly needed, he could fight back or apparate away. Potter might have a few galleons in his pockets, but Tom had such power at his fingertips - he would have this man on his knees and begging before he could even cast his first spell.</p><p>He was led down a small alleyway covered in shimmering vines and then up a rounded staircase to the second story of a dark stone building. The further up they climbed, the more refined the stones seemed, gleaming with reflected light until they reached a large set of rounded double doors. They opened ahead of them and Potter strode in with a friendly nod to the two doormen who bowed as they passed by.</p><p>Tom fought to keep his eyes from wandering too obviously as they navigated past towering stacks of leather-bound books and gleaming gold tools. Still, he couldn’t help but turn his head as titles foiled in gold along the spines caught his eye. </p><p><em> Moste Rare and Potente Herbes </em> ; <em> Dark Spells for your Greatest Enemies </em> ; <em> The Forbidden </em></p><p>Tom’s eyes widened. Such books, both dark and highly illegal… just how exclusive was this place? Such opulence that ran undetected by ministry eye… Tom had to admire their cunning secrecy.</p><p>Potter caught his eye as he turned back and grinned. “I figured you’d appreciate it here. They have quite an impressive selection.”</p><p>Tom nodded slowly. Impressive, most certainly. But he did not want to imagine just how much they would cost.</p><p>One day, he promised himself. One day he would be able to afford all of them. And no one would look down on him or dismiss him or scoff at his name. </p><p>He kept quiet as they passed into the next room, even though he wanted nothing more than to peruse the shelves. To crack open the spines of each and every book and devour their contents. He hadn’t thought that he would care much for the building beyond the books, but he had to admit that the cafe was beautiful. Tall white columns were etched with delicate gold filigree, and stretched across the tall vaulted ceiling was a painted scene depicting the eighteenth century Goblin Rebellion in minute detail. Each table was surrounded by a privacy barrier and though Tom could hear murmured voices, he could not make out a single word.</p><p>They were immediately greeted by a waiter whose suit was of far finer quality than Tom’s, and led to a table next to one of the windows. It overlooked a lush courtyard that was not visible from the alley. Tom wondered how much else there was hidden from the average eye, available only to those with enough coin in their pockets.</p><p>He eyed Potter speculatively. He certainly didn’t seem excessively wealthy. Well-to-do, most certainly, but his finely made clothes were not ostentatious like the Malfoys, nor gaudy like the Parkinsons. He also held himself differently. Confident, but not… arrogant. Tom found himself reluctantly impressed. To convey such earnest humility was no easy feat.</p><p>“Order whatever you want,” Potter encouraged as Tom was given a menu.</p><p>He opened it a little warily and forced himself not to react as he noted more gold filigree decorating the edges of the pages. The dishes all sounded extravagant, with ingredients Tom had never even heard of before. And on top of that, there weren’t even any prices.</p><p>He forced away an embarrassed flush as he struggled to understand the menu. Tom’s eyes flicked above his menu to observe his companion, but the man was perusing the menu with a curious hum. Tom glanced down quickly before Potter could catch him staring.</p><p>“Anything in particular that you would like to try?” Potter asked. “All of their ingredients are fresh and exquisitely prepared. Really, I guarantee you will enjoy it.”</p><p>Tom forced a smile onto his lips despite his uncertainty. “I’m afraid there are so many I just can’t quite decide.” Merlin, how he hated this feeling of powerlessness. This lack of knowledge. This inability to comprehend what was in front of him, merely because he lacked the money.</p><p>“Oh,” Potter seemed to deflate a little. But it only took a moment for him to perk back up. “I’m happy to order for the both of us, if you would like. I am quite used to the menu.”</p><p>Tom dipped his head in acquiescence. It was far less likely that Potter would renege on his promise to treat Tom if he was the one ordering. Not that Tom could afford any of these, most likely. He doubted the coin he had left would cover any of the dishes.</p><p>Potter beamed as if Tom had done him a great favour. “One of each,” he said when the waiter came by. Then he glanced back at Tom, who had to force his face to remain placid. “This way you can try a little bit of everything.”</p><p>“Most kind of you,” Tom murmured, eyes lowering to avoid the way Potter’s green eyes sparkled in the sunlight. The way his face lit up when he smiled.</p><p>This man was <em> good </em>. He knew how to play the game. How to appear so very friendly and kind. How to hide his true intentions.</p><p>But Tom was no amateur. He had been nurtured in the shadow of cunning and deception, and he would uncover what this Harry Potter wanted with him. And if necessary, he would crush the man, pretty green eyes and all.</p><p>“So, Tom, tell me about yourself.” Potter was smiling that easy smile again, as if he wasn’t waiting for Tom to reveal any hint of weakness.</p><p>“I recently graduated from Hogwarts,” Tom replied as he sipped the tea that had been set in front of him. It tasted exquisite. “I am, at the moment, deciding which path I wish to pursue.”</p><p>Potter nodded. “Makes sense. It’s a big decision. Not that you can’t change your mind later on, but… well, it’s nice to know that you’re making the right choice.”</p><p>“Indeed,” Tom’s smile was a little thin as he resisted the urge to reveal more about himself. Harry was worryingly easy to talk to. So very good at gathering information. He forced the conversation away from himself. “And yourself?”</p><p>“Me?” Potter looked a little startled, as if he hadn’t expected the question. Did he not expect Tom to play the game as well? “Well, I graduated from Hogwarts - what, five? Six years ago now? And I am just completing my final project as a journeyman in Alchemy.”</p><p>“Alchemy?” Tom said, admittedly impressed. “That is no easy field.”</p><p>Potter laughed a little and ran a hand through his hair. “It’s not so bad if you don’t mind all the reading and experimenting.”</p><p>Tom quirked a brow. “Ravenclaw, then?” He deduced.</p><p>Potter grinned. “Got it in one." He narrowed his eyes at Tom thoughtfully. "Slytherin?”</p><p>Tom dipped his head. “Indeed.”</p><p>Potter laughed, obviously unbothered by Tom’s affiliation with the house of snakes. “I thought so. You snakes tend to be the most interested in the more questionable Arts.”</p><p>Tom raised a brow. “I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about.” His eyes darted to the other patrons, but it seemed that the muffling charms held true and none so much as glanced their way.</p><p>“There is nothing wrong with taking an interest in the more… obscure magics,” Potter gave another rolling shrug. “It’s not really my field, but you can’t practice alchemy without dipping your fingers into some of the darker arts.”</p><p>Tom waited as the server approached their table and placed down a long row of dishes. At Potter’s gesture he took a small serving of each one, mouth already watering at the sight and smell of the food. </p><p>Only when the waiter had left did he speak again. “And yet I had heard that Alchemy was a noble profession.”</p><p>“Oh?” Potter blinked. “I mean, in some ways, I suppose it is.” He tapped a finger on the table thoughtfully. “But it is a complex field that requires knowledge from various other fields to combine on top of the alchemy itself. The use of runes and arithmancy as well as rituals that have long been considered dark.”</p><p>Tom made a sound of encouragement as he took his first bite. The slice of fish that he had chosen melted in his mouth and he chewed slowly, savouring the rush of flavour. </p><p>“Potions ingredients are an especially important aspect,” Potter seemed to have no trouble talking animatedly between bites. “The physical presence of magical components is just as important as the rest. The ‘wand waving’, as one might call it. That’s actually why I was in Tools and Tomes. I was hoping that Mr. Theed carried siren scales and dried unicorn blood, but unfortunately he seemed to be out.”</p><p>Tom paused then and lowered his fork. He studied the man from beneath his lashes. Weighing. Judging. “If you are looking for such ingredients,” he said finally, “Borgin &amp; Burkes is expecting a shipment of rare potions ingredients at the end of the week.” Yes. He had decided. He would keep Harry, at least for now. The man was intriguing, playing a game that even Tom had a hard time deciphering. He wanted to pick Potter apart. Find out what lay behind those green eyes of his. And if the man proved to be as simple, as boring as his classmates, then, well, he could always use another blind follower. </p><p>Harry’s eyes lit up. “Really? I have not been there for a few years now. You are sure of this?”</p><p>Tom resisted the urge to sneer. “Indeed. I am their employee and keep track of their purchases and shipments.”</p><p>“Wonderful! Thank you, Tom. I appreciate it. I was having a hard time finding them, especially here in Britain.” Harry smiled then, bright and warm and really, he made it seem like it was the easiest expression to wear. “I was hoping to avoid any more international portkeys for a while.”</p><p>“You travel often, then?” Tom inquired, rather curious. Alchemy had never truly been something he’d been interested in. It had always seemed far too… fantastical. And he had dismissed it completely once he had read that Albus Dumbledore had dabbled in it. He wanted nothing to do with the man.</p><p>“Yes, mostly for research. Nick has an incredible research laboratory in Switzerland, so we spend most of our time there. It has been our home base for the past few years, so I haven’t been back to Britain much at all.” </p><p>“Well,” Tom said, seeing a slight nostalgic gleam in Harry’s eyes, “welcome home then, I suppose I should say. You must be happy to be back.”</p><p>Harry blinked in surprise before his smile returned. “Thank you, Tom. It’s nice to hear that. It’s good to be back - it really is. But I’ve been gone for a while, and returning has been… a little bit difficult, I have to admit.”</p><p>Tom tilted his head in an encouraging motion. He wondered what Harry gained from telling him all of this. Strangely open, Tom mused. Perhaps a bid to earn Tom’s trust. It was cute, in a way. Rather endearing, the way Harry appeared to be so earnest. But Tom would play along, at least for now.</p><p>Harry seemed to appreciate Tom’s quiet support, for he looked at Tom gratefully. “I was never really one to make a lot of friends.” For a moment something almost sad passed across his face. Then it was gone again. “I wasn’t very good at keeping in touch with them when I was gone either, so that now that I’m back, most of them have their own lives now.” His smile turned a little self-deprecating. “I really can’t blame anyone but myself, but it does get a little bit lonely. I think I had gotten pretty used to always having someone around. Not that I’m completely alone, of course, but, well, it’s just nice to have a bit more to one’s company, you know?”</p><p>Tom sent an appropriately understanding look, even as he wondered how many others had seen through Harry’s friendly guise. “Of course. It is… difficult when you find that your friends have drifted off.” Not that Tom ever bothered to make <em> friends </em>. He had acquaintances and followers and that was all he needed. And they would certainly never dare drift in loyalty. He would make them regret it if they ever did.</p><p>“So I really appreciate it, you spending time with me, I mean,” Harry said, reaching over and placing his hand on top of Tom’s. It was warm and lightly calloused, and Tom found himself surprised that the man was so forward. </p><p>“The pleasure is all mine,” he said with a smile that he hoped looked natural and warm. He was not used to people touching him. Most of the students at Hogwarts didn’t dare - either out of fear or awe. He supposed he didn’t mind, exactly. Harry’s touch was gentle and fleeting, retreating before it became indecent. His hand felt oddly cold as Harry moved away.</p><p>It was a strange thought, to enjoy the touch of another’s skin. Tom was far from an affectionate person, and beyond using it to manipulate others, he did not initiate physical contact with others. Still, he had to admit that Harry’s hand had felt… nice. </p><p>“Unfortunately,” Tom said as he checked his pocket watch, “I must return to work. My lunch break is almost up.”</p><p>“Ah,” Harry’s face fell a little. “Of course,” he said hurriedly. “I didn’t mean to keep you or anything.” He signalled the waiter and asked for the remaining food to be packed up. </p><p>The server returned moments later and directed the food into the small box with his wand. He placed it in the middle of the table before straightening. “Anything else for you gentlemen?”</p><p>Tom glanced at the small box, then at Harry, who looked ready to speak. A sudden curious thought came to mind and he reached forward and took the box in hand, giving Harry an innocent smile. He wanted to see how the man would react to his bold move. Would this be enough to reveal his true intentions? Tom ended up being a little disappointed, though, when the green-eyed man merely blinked at him in slight surprise, no irritation in his gaze. No impatience, no anger, no frustration. </p><p>Instead Harry grinned that crooked grin and turned to the waiter. “A little extra for Balthazar, if you please. Just the usual is fine.”</p><p>The waiter nodded and left with a quick bow.</p><p>Tom turned the name over in his head. Balthazar. A pureblood name, most certainly. He wondered what family. And what he was to Harry. A friend? A partner? A lover?</p><p>The usual, Harry had said. A common occurrence, then. Which meant likely a partner. His eyes narrowed imperceptibly. That could complicate things if Tom wanted to draw Harry in. But - <em> ‘it’s nice to have a bit more to one’s company’ </em>, Harry had said. If Balthazar was so lacking, then it would be easy for Tom to lure Harry away.</p><p>His eyes lidded as he watched Harry accept a box of food from the server. To press his ring to a piece of parchment, eyes barely glancing at the incredible amount this meal must have cost. </p><p>Harry Potter would be useful, even if only for his great wealth. Tom had plans, after all. Ones that would need funding. And once he unraveled the green-eyed man, he would twist him around his fingers until he bowed to Tom’s every whim. It wouldn’t be too difficult. His eagerness to befriend Tom would only make him fall harder into Tom’s web.</p><p>His lips twitched at the thought. He had always enjoyed mind games, and this one promised to be <em> very </em> fun.</p>
