    <p>The summer came and went, leaving Jay bored for a long time when Neville went on vacation.</p><p>After the whole situation with James and Sirius, she was never really left alone anymore. To battle the boredom, she charmed her books to look like the covers of books normal for a thirteen-year-old to read, instead of the way passed NEWT level literature she was actually reading.</p><p>Seeing Hogwarts again was a relief, despite all the misery the past two years had caused her. She could see the teachers’ almost smug looks. Jay knew what was to come, as did Neville. After all, one could not be around so many aurors during the summer without knowing.</p><p>She had to admit, though, she was impressed with how well it had remained a secret. Of course she told Neville. With all her luck, either she or Charlie would become the school’s champion in the deadly competition that was to come.</p><p>When she heard the news, Jay stepped up her training by a lot. She had to be extremely prepared for herself and Charlie alike. She studied the old competitions for many hours in the hopes of finding a pattern.</p><p>Which there seemed to be, at least some. One task would include a test of fighting, another knowledge and the third usually bravery and perseverance. That was however the only pattern there was, excluding the high mortality rate of the champions.</p><p>She shared her knowledge with Neville, and he agreed to help her or Charlie out should the need arise.</p><p>When the announcement was made, Jay and Neville played the part of surprised and excited students. And when the age requirement was made, they acted angry. Just like they had agreed. It would arise some suspicion if they knew beforehand what was happening.</p><p>Secretly she was happy for the restriction. It meant that it would be a lot harder for someone to enter her or Charlie’s name in the goblet. Even if it wouldn’t stop it from happening, the list of people capable of such a feat would be very short.</p><p> She was surprised to see Mad Eye in the position of DADA professor. Last she heard the man was unstable at best. There was some rumor going around about him attacking trash cans. Whatever it was, it didn’t really matter. She had seen him train junior aurors in the ministry, and if anyone was fit to teach them DADA, the man was made for it.</p><p>````````````````````````````````````</p><p>It was midnight when Neville and Jay met up in the RoR.</p><p>They sat around a table on the floor. Gently, while wearing two pairs of herblore gloves, she took the green locket out of it’s metal case.</p><p>“So that’s it?” Neville looks a bit sickened, “I was expecting it to be a bit more…”</p><p>Jay nods, “It looks kind of underwhelming, doesn’t it?”</p><p>“Yup.” Neville agrees. “When are we going to pick up the basilisk venom?”</p><p>Jay hums, “I think we should wait for a bit. Dumbledore is probably still watching the entrance. If we bide our time, we can strike while he’s unprepared.”</p><p>Neville doesn’t look convinced though. “But, do you really want to wait for that? I mean, it’s a good plan, but do we really want to keep the thing around for any longer then absolutely necessary? Especially now when the foreign students can arrive any day now.”</p><p>While Neville did have a point there, there was something Jay hadn’t told him yet. “Nev, I don’t think this is the only Horcrux he made. He had the diary, now the pendant, and I’ve been dreaming of two more.”</p><p>Neville balances, “That isn’t the only one? Merlin help us.”</p><p>“You said it.” Jay sighs. “I think he made at least five.” She runs a hand trough her hair. “There are the diary, the pendant, the two unknown ones, and Nagini might be one as well.”</p><p>The pendant begins to hiss again at the mention of the name. Jay carefully puts it back in the case and refastens the rune engraved chains around it.</p><p>“The problem is getting to Nagini. From what I’ve seen, he never leaves her alone. There is always someone with her.”</p><p>Neville lets himself fall backward on the pile of pillows they had collected.  “Do you have any idea how to get to her?”</p><p>Jay snorts, and a sad half smile appears on her face, “Only one. And I have no idea if it will  work. Or if I’ll survive it.”</p><p>Nev is quick to sit up with his hands up, “Okay let’s not do that then. We’ll figure something out. We’ve got time. Right?”</p><p>“That’s the problem, Nev. I don’t know if we do. I have no idea how he’s planning on coming back. Like I said, his body is destroyed for right now. But for how long it will be the case, is anyone’s guess.”</p><p>“What is the plan then? Just out of curiosity.”</p><p>“I convince him that I’m on his side.”</p>
