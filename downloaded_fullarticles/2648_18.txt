  <strong>Table of Contents</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Random universes, random lemons. Feel free to give me ideas. There'll be lots of lemons, some which might be a bit...much. Check out the table of contents (Chapter 1) for more info on the chapters before you read.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Please check the warnings, check the table of contents, and enjoy my story. For the first and final warning, please do not take anything in my stories seriously. They're just here for our dark desires, and that is all. Note that these works do not reflect my beliefs, and I do hope that they should never reflect yours. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>With that being said, feel free to give me any suggestions. No wrong ones, just ones that haven't been said. I'll either accept or reject them, depending on how I feel, and depending on how much I know about the topic (ex: Since I don't know much about Halo, obviously I can't do one about Halo.) </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Please enjoy.</span>
