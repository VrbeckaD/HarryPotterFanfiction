    <p>
  <em>In which a Butler is concerned, a young heir mourns, a runaway wizard is hunted down and Captain Jack Harkness watches a video.</em>
</p>
<p>This was a different kind of silence, Butler thought, staring at the ceiling. He was accustomed to silence, just not this type. Fowl Manor had never been a place for noise, not even when young Artemis was just a child. He had been a quiet boy, always looking at the world with calm, observant eyes. Eyes that now were dark, held a shadow that had never been there before. It scared Butler. He turned on the bed for the thousandth time. Yes, he thought, the Artemis he knew could be hard and cold, logical to the point of cruelty, but rationality always guided him. Purpose always guided his actions. That was the reason Butler knew he could trust him. And that was why this new darkness was so wrong, and this horrific silence was killing him slowly. The enormous house felt old, eerier than it ever had been; broken, like a shattered clock. He could not take it any longer. So Butler left his room, the room that had always belonged to him since he started serving the Fowl family, and went searching for Artemis.<br/>
</p>
<p>The worst part was that Butler didn´t know how to help, or even if he could do it. How do you make one's father death a not-so-bad experience? He wanted to laugh at himself. He wanted to crush something. Anything was better than this silence. Could he have prevented the tragedy? He felt like he should have. But it had all sounded so perfect, one more of the twisted and brilliant plans of Artemis Fowl. One clever trick more to be played. The boy was born for greatness. So when the time came, they all followed his scheme. Help the fairies in Paris, destroy the goblin rebellion, go to the Arctic, challenge the Russian Mafyia, beat them in their own game and take Artemis Fowl senior back home. It should have worked. They had been so close…<br/>
</p>
<p>With victory at hand, Butler had heard hope and grief in his young charge's voice when he saw his father on the ship´s deck; had seen the fierce determination in his face when giving orders at the critical stage of the plot he had orchestrated. And he had seen the tears, real tears of relief, that flowed down his face when he thought, for a precious moment, that his father was safe. Real emotions, so rare to witness in his young features. Then everything came crumbling down. Blood and madness, and someone screaming in the frozen night. Red and white Butler shuddered at the thought. Fear. He couldn’t remember when was the last time he had been so terrified of something. Maybe that time when Madame Ko left him in the mountains to fend on his own when he was just a teenager. Even the memory of that night threw him off-balance. He didn’t like it. He was a weapon. Weapons should not hesitate.<br/>
</p>
<p>Artemis was not in his bedroom, despite the early hour, but that was hardly a surprise. The door was open, and the grey light of dawn shone through the curtains that shivered on the ghostly breath of the morning. One window was slightly opened, and the bead, empty. Butler left the room. In all his days of service to the Fowls, he had never been troubled by their sometimes spooky manor. It wasn’t the cold; he had suffered worse. It wasn’t the darkness; the day was about to break. It wasn’t the old, old feeling that the manor exuded in moments like this; he knew every part of that house by heart. It was the combination of all, and the silence, that defeated silence, that was driving him crazy. How much longer was this going to last? Was it even possible, at this point?<br/>
</p>
<p>In the days following their return from Russia, the young master had been unable to sleep and had haunted the manor like a ghost. His eyes were empty, and all his answers to any questions that Butler could ask sounded hollow and distant. The only real thing in his world seemed to be a yellowish paper envelope, that was clutched forcefully in one of his hands. He did not cry. Butler had been expecting him to let go of his cold composure, half dreading it, half hoping for it. What could he say to a boy who had seen his father killed in front of him? But the wall of ice around Artemis never shattered. It wasn’t right. A son should cry for his old man, even the criminal masterminds. The only external sign of mourning that Artemis had allowed himself was wearing black, every day since they returned. A gesture that no one in the house besides Butler, could understand in all its magnitude. For them, Artemis Fowl senior had been dead for a long time.<br/>
</p>
<p>That winter had been especially hard, as if trying to match the mood of the boy, and in those days, of shadow and cold, the ice in Artemis’ eyes, in his voice, in his entire demeanour, only grew. By the middle of February, Artemis had gone back to a resemblance of order. He ate and slept regularly again, but never stayed in bed more than five hours. Around the same time, he started to tinker with the stolen fairy technology again. Until one day, he locked himself up in his study.  That same week, the books started to arrive. Old, dusty volumes, bound in leather and of ancient appearance; dozens of them, crossed the gates of Fowl manor. Treasures like those could not be found in online stores. Artemis had to have been pulling his strings, convincing, coaxing and blackmailing the owners of the private collections of all Europe. The spark that had been absent for so long, returned to his eyes. The sharpness of his gaze was there again, but it was not the same. Had he been any other, Butler would have thought that he had lost his mind. Things being as they were, he knew there was more to it.<br/>
</p>
<p>In front of the door of Artemis study, Butler stopped, a hand in the air, ready to knock. Lately, it had not made any difference whether he entered unannounced or knocked for half an hour, waiting outside for an answer that never came. Three seconds later, he entered. The place was in complete disarray, with books and sheets full of scribbled notes all over the desk and chairs. From a rainbow of coloured markers sticking out of most of the books, to the unstable towers of volumes that stood in the way, everything indicated a feverish research. Butler looked around for a moment. It was so unlike his master… And he wasn’t here either. Where was he? Butler needed to talk to him. Artemis hadn’t really talked to him since the Arctic. No words seemed to reach him. Mrs. Fowl and Juliet had both noticed it, and each of them had tried to get and explanation from Butler. He had told him nothing. That duty he would not fail. He had already failed enough. After thinking for a moment, Butler concluded that there were only two remaining places in the house in which Artemis could probably be. Almost dreading the first option, Butler reached the great staircase and went down. To his relief, the piano room was empty too. He couldn’t have bear it. The heart-wrenching music that Artemis would play since the Arctic. Not today. Last option then.<br/>
</p>
<p>Outside was cold. Spring was just around the corner, but there was still a chill in the air. Butler did not care. His training had prepared him for much worse. Instead, he headed for the northern walls. When he reached the top, Artemis was there, staring at the lands of his family, his face inscrutable as ever.<br/>
</p>
<p>-Artemis…<br/>
</p>
<p>Butler frowned at the sound of his own voice. Hoarse, sad, concerned.<br/>
</p>
<p>-I know, old friend- said the young master, turning towards him. -We need to talk.<br/>
</p>
<p>Butler felt a wave of relief. The darkness was still there, in his charge’s eyes, but today it was diminished, tamed. Maybe there was hope.<br/>
</p>
<p>-Your mother is worried -was the best he could manage. - She thinks you need to see a doctor. You have to talk to her again, help her believe you are not going mad.<br/>
</p>
<p>-Aren’t I?<br/>
</p>
<p>Butler supressed a shiver.<br/>
</p>
<p>-No. Of course you are not.<br/>
</p>
<p>-How can you tell? You have seen me. I can’t sleep, I barely eat. I haven´t gotten out of the manor in three weeks. And all I do is read… volumes of forgotten lore.<br/>
</p>
<p>His voice had been almost playful at the end, but still sounded frayed. Butler frowned again. That phrase was part of a poem, that much he could tell, but right now he was not interested in riddles.<br/>
</p>
<p>-You have a reason. Artemis Fowl doesn’t do anything without good reason. Much less spend his money on a whim. And I know it is somehow related to that letter your father gave you.<br/>
</p>
<p>Artemis flinched at the mention, but held Butler’s gaze. There was the shadow, but it had been momentarily vanquished at least. The mind that it had tried to cloud was too brilliant. Butler wished he could put his thoughts to words. Tell Artemis that he has sorry, that it was not his fault what had happened in Russia. That maybe there was no one to blame, except perhaps himself, for not being good enough. After a moment of silent regard, Artemis expression softened.<br/>
</p>
<p>-Your faith in me is greater than my own.<br/>
</p>
<p>With a sigh, the young heir tuned north, to the green fields, as if he was pondering what to say next. Butler did not know how to react. All this hesitance was uncharacteristic of Artemis Fowl. The youth pulled a very worn, very handled paper out of his black coat’s pocket.<br/>
</p>
<p>-This letter was in my father’s power, the day of his… rescue.<br/>
</p>
<p>Artemis spat the last word as if it burned him. It probably did.<br/>
</p>
<p>-He said things then and there, that I could not bring myself to believe. Things about our family… about me, that sounded too outlandish, even for myself.<br/>
</p>
<p>Butler wondered what kind of secrets had Artemis Fowl senior revealed to his son in his last moments, that were capable of shocking him. After all, Artemis had deduced and accepted the existence of fairies, magic and aliens when he was still a child.  Was it a conspiracy, a betrayal? The map of a hidden treasure, a shameful family secret? Had Artemis Fowl I had an illegitimate son? Butler asked. As if he was hesitant to answer, Artemis run his slender fingers over his hair. It had been a while since he had cut it, and the ink-black strands of the front were long enough to cover his eyes. His eyes were now fixed on the folded paper in his hand.<br/>
</p>
<p>‘He doesn’t know if he should tell me.’ Butler realized, more hurt than he would have expected. ‘Does he think I can´t handle it?’<br/>
</p>
<p>-He said I am a wizard.<br/>
</p>
<p>Butler blinked.<br/>
</p>
<p>-What?<br/>
</p>
<p>Artemis walked to the boarder of the wall and rested his weight over the stone parapet. Was this his new idea of a joke? His incredulity must have shown, so Artemis elaborated.<br/>
</p>
<p>-He said that all the family was magical once. Purebloods, they seem to have been called. And he gave me this letter, saying that it had arrived the day of my tenth birthday. I have read it over a thousand times, I know every sentence written on it.  You may read it if you want.<br/>
</p>
<p>He offered the letter to Butler.  The letters were written in emerald green ink, but that was the most mundane thing about them.<br/>
</p>

</p>
<p>
  <em>Dear Mr. Fowl<br/>
</em>
</p>
<p>

Deputy Headmistress<br/>
</em><br/>
</p>
<p>What to make of that? Butler wasn´t sure. He wasn’t sure of anything anymore. Most people thought fairies were… well, fairy tales. Butler knew they were very real, and very dangerous. But, wizards? It was a little too much. Artemis was still talking.<br/>
</p>
<p>-My father said he intended to tell me everything as soon as he returned from Russia. He regretted that the legacy of the family had been kept from me, and wanted me to learn. This was the only other option, apparently.<br/>
</p>
<p>-You have been trying to find them- it dawned on Butler. -The wizards. That is what the books are for.<br/>
</p>
<p>-Yes. The way my father referred to them, and the writing on the letter both imply the existence of a magical community around us. But where would they be? How would they hide? And why? There had to be traces of them, but not in our modern history. If they exist, modifying it must be one of their top priorities. So I had to get access to an unaltered record of the past, concerning the supernatural. Unfortunately, the best source, old volumes written by monks and scholars, are not available to the public, and the owners are not eager to lend the most valuable pieces of their collections.<br/>
</p>
<p>-Yet you managed to get yourself quite a large number- pointed Butler. Artemis looked pleased with himself.<br/>
</p>
<p>-I have contacts. The evidence is there, Butler, if you know where to look. Hints of this magical humans, that remain consistent over the centuries. Once you recognize the patterns, it becomes easy to tell which authors were lying and which were telling the truth. It seems some of them encountered or came across people with mystical powers, and the explanations they give for some gaps in historical events appears at least plausible, once you accept the hypothesis. This is basically, how I deduced the existence of the fairies in the first place. The critical step seems to be the suspension of disbelief, then all it takes is rationalizing the information and making the appropriate connections between the dots.<br/>
</p>
<p>Butler nodded, thoughtfully.  Despite the wind, he felt a warm sensation in his chest. This was more like the Artemis he knew. Explaining the unexplainable, dissecting the wildest reality into facts and reshaping it with logic.<br/>
</p>
<p>-But how could they hide, Artemis? -he asked. -The cover of the fairies I can understand. They live far away from humans, and avoid us all the time. This supposed magicians live between us. How come nobody has noticed? Not even the internet?<br/>
</p>
<p>Artemis looked at him with sharp eyes, as if he was expecting the question.<br/>
</p>
<p>-That puzzled me too, at first. I don’t have a complete answer, not yet. There is a lot of curiosities in the internet, about magical sightings and paranormal things, most of it a ruse, but some is real. Wizards should be a trend if they live so near to us, yet the web is strangely silent. For now, my theory is that these wizards do not interact much with non-wizards, and avoid our technology, like cell-phones and digital cameras. Interestingly enough, there is a fair share of old photographs of them.<br/>
</p>
<p>-Do they appear in your books?<br/>
</p>
<p>-If I didn’t know you, Butler, I could mistake that for humour. No. They are all over the internet, as curiosities. I must say wizards seem to have had a preference for old fashioned costumes.<br/>
</p>
<p>Butler shook his head. He was having a hard time believing this, reality had never been kind to him. Still, Artemis was the most convincing person he knew. If he thought that wizards were real, they probably were.<br/>
</p>
<p>-Very well. Let’s say these magical individuals exist. That doesn’t make you one, Artemis. Have you ever used it? Casted a spell on something? And I knew your father for half his life. He was as normal as you and me, maybe a little more.<br/>
</p>
<p>-You are right. The letter demonstrates that some of these… people thought that I had magic, not that I, in fact, possess it.  But even if I do not, I have to solve this, find the truth. If I ever want to… Just think about it, Butler. People with magic. Imagine the possibilities.<br/>
</p>
<p>The resolve in Artemis’ voice was evident. Butler knew better than to argue. And this time, he could feel, his young charge’s need run deeper than curiosity, even though curiosity could be a very strong incentive with Artemis Fowl. He was trying to make sense of the last words of his father.  Maybe this could bring him closure. Maybe this could bring him back. And so, the path to follow was clear.<br/>
</p>
<p>-What are we going to do?<br/>
</p>
<p>Artemis’ mood brightened. He had been afraid of him refusing, Butler realized.<br/>
</p>
<p>-While I was, ah… convincing some of the previous owners of the books, some of them mentioned that they had been forbidden to exhibit their properties in museums, share them with the public or lend them to private investigators. I would suspect a secret wizard government, but the descriptions of the agents sent indicate that they were British agents. We must assume that at least some of the British authorities know about this, and be careful. I would not want to disappoint any of the detectives at the Interpol by being caught for a national security matter. Furthermore, we need to find this magic people, without them or the government noticing anything until we have learned the true nature of the game.  We are in disadvantage as long as we remain ignorant. Let’s see. How to find a member of a closed community that doesn’t want to be bothered and make him tell us all their secrets?<br/>
</p>
<p>Butler knew the answer to that.<br/>
</p>
<p>-We send the dogs after an outcast, secure him and scare him until he is singing every song he knows.<br/>
</p>
<p>-I’m glad to see you haven’t forgotten anything.<br/>
</p>
<p>A recrimination. Of course Butler had not forgotten. He was a Butler, and they were the best at what they did. The Fowl penchant for crime, constant thought the generations, had ensured that they learned how to deal with the lowlifes from Hong Kong to Dublin.<br/>
</p>
<p>-This will be dangerous, Artemis. Are you conscious of the consequences that the return of the Fowl name to the underworld will have? Your father worked hard to get out.<br/>
</p>
<p>-I am fully aware of the potential repercussions.<br/>
</p>
<p>Butler stared at Artemis. His point got across.<br/>
</p>
<p>-Yes, I know -said the youth, after a few tense seconds. -My father wanted to go straight. It wouldn’t have lasted, we are Fowls. And anything that he intended to do, anyone he intended me to become, it doesn’t matter anymore.<br/>
</p>
<p>There it was again. The darkness. Artemis’ tone had become sharp as a knife. The cracks became noticeable.<br/>
</p>
<p>-Very well – said Butler. -But before you give the order, remember that your father was a good man, Artemis. Maybe he had a good reason to live that life behind.<br/>
The gaze of Artemis hardened, but he did not move.<br/>
</p>
<p>-Send word to our contacts at the Irish mob and the British firms. Fowl is looking for a gifted, probably spoken of as a wizard, and wants him delivered with maximum discretion. Two million pounds.<br/>
</p>
<p>- I will see it is done, but Artemis, I have one condition.<br/>
</p>
<p>Artemis looked almost impatient.<br/>
</p>
<p>-What is it?<br/>
</p>
<p>-You have to do something, besides reading those books. When your mother awakes, go to her. Talk to her again. She misses you. Remember that she mourned too, perhaps too much.<br/>
</p>
<p>Artemis turned away. Maybe he shouldn’t have said that. When the Fowl Star sunk, and Artemis’ father was declared dead, Angeline had fallen into depression and had been driven mad with grief. Magic had been necessary to restore her. But in all those years, Artemis had refused to lose faith, firmly believing that his father was still alive. He had been right.<br/>
</p>
<p>-How can I look her in the eye, Butler? -said Artemis, quietly.<br/>
</p>
<p>‘It was not your fault.’ Butler wanted to scream. Maybe he would have, if he didn’t know the futility of the action. Hell, he was still trying to wrap his mind around what had happened in Russia. Some days it seemed like a nightmare. Who could have expected the events unravelling that way? The creatures that had appeared in the frozen land, red eyes, iron teeth, inhuman… No, some of them had been human, he forced himself to remember, he had taken down two of them, seen them bleed. Red on white. And if such magic was real, if Artemis was right again… then the sudden attack in the Arctic could mean something completely different of what they had been led to believe. Something other than a fortuitous attack from wild creatures. That was it, he realized. Nothing was going to stop Artemis from going after this magical hidden world, not if he suspected it could lead him to his father’s murderers. And Butler knew what he had to say.<br/>
</p>
<p>-Look at her as someone who will find the truth about her husband’s death, and made them pay.<br/>
</p>
<p>At this, Artemis glanced at him, with surprise. For a brief moment he looked like the boy he was supposed to be.<br/>
</p>
<p>-I… I will. Maybe it is time to consider a new project. There is this idea I’ve been considering, about the possible applications of the fairy tech. If I combine…<br/>
</p>
<p>Butler, listened, trying to follow the exposition of his charge while they made their way down the walls. He gave up after a couple of minutes, but it sounded great, and dangerous. Then again, this was Artemis Fowl. It was good to hear his mind work. Butler felt good. The silence had been defeated, for now. There was a new mission, and he was a man of action. While Artemis had breakfast with his mother, he drove to Dublin to deliver the request of the Fowl family: a breathing wizard, preferably not too battered. He hummed inside the car.</p>
<p>	Artemis kept his word. He organized his study, had his meals with Mrs. Fowl and even spent some time with Juliet, learning to wrestle. This meaning that Artemis spent a lot of time being thrown to the ground, as the blonde girl demonstrated over a hundred ways to take down a guy. He still wore black, refusing to acknowledge any insinuation about changing, and still had trouble sleeping, but it was obvious that he was recovering from the traumatic end of the Arctic incident. Butler was pleased.
</p>
<p>Artemis continued working with the fairy tech, alternating between that and his research on wizards. And one day, that mischievous glint, so characteristic of him, returned to his eyes. He had a new plot. That probably meant danger. Butler would have liked to ask, but he knew the young genius would only reveal his ingenuity when he deemed it timely. As expected, some days later, Artemis summoned him to his study. When he showed him what he had been working on, and explained how it worked, Butler couldn’t help but being impressed. His charge had outdone himself again. This was beyond any piece of technology he had ever patented. Butler felt a shadow of something akin to pride. Then he remembered himself his place.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-… once I solved that problem, everything fell into place -said Artemis, finishing his lecture. -Some of the fairies are very crafty indeed, but nothing I can’t handle. And now, this little cube is the most advanced digital device that you will find above ground. Once it reaches the market, it will tear to pieces Phonetix, Fission Chips and any other tech company you can think of. It is worth fortunes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Butler grunted, preferring not to give any spoken answer. That sounded like a hell of trouble.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-I already made some calls- continued Artemis. -Some powerful people in the tech market are interested. However, I’ve singled out my man, the others are just smoke. We will be meeting by the end of March. This deal will contribute greatly to the family fortune.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Butler was confused. Was he missing something?<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Are you saying you are going to sell…<br/>
</p>
<p>
-The C-cube -provided Artemis.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-the C-cube? It doesn’t sound like you.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Absolutely. I am not selling anything, but our American millionaire is assuming that I will. Let’s keep him in the dark for now.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Butler nodded once. It was not the first time Artemis had made profit from the stupidity of businessmen. Nevertheless, millionaires were dangerous, especially when they felt they had been played.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-What will you ask for?<br/>
</p>
<p>
-You know the family motto.<em> Aurum potestas est</em>.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Of course. Artemis was very fond of gold. A family trait, apparently.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Do you have a meeting place?<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Not yet. I will inform you in advance. I would not like to keep you from doing your job.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Butler grunted again, grateful. Sometimes the cryptic side of Artemis, always hiding his plans, even for him, took its toll on his nerves. When he looked at the boy again, he noticed something. Artemis´ gaze was lost somewhere in the bookshelves. In his usually calm face, there was a hint of unrest. In all the years he had known him, literally his whole life, Butler had never seen that expression on Artemis, when he was plotting. In those moments he was in his element, always present and full of energy. But now, it just wasn’t enough. He would not be satisfied, Butler remembered, until he had solved the mystery of the magic humans.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Well then -said the bodyguard. -Any chance you are going to tell me what you intend to do with this cube?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Artemis came back, and looked at Butler.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Not for now. This requires more work. Don´t worry, in the next month it should become obvious.<br/>
</p>
<p>
It didn’t. If Artemis had considered the work ready to be seen by Butler, it meant that he had finished his invention. Thus, the majority of his attention focused on the books he had acquired once again.  By that time, he had already gone through half of his collection. He kept reading, determined to unravel the secrets they held. Slowly, the volumes he studied became fewer and fewer. The towers of old books that were no longer of interest for him where left to Butler to carry to the basement. Sometimes he thought the C-cube venture had left the mind of his charge, but then Artemis would suddenly go into his lab, to make small changes to his prototype. Then he would return to the books.
</p>
<p>Every day he asked Butler about his contacts in the underworld, and everyday Butler told him that they hadn’t found anything, subsequently trying to redirect his attention to other subjects. He only succeeded momentarily. Butler could tell Artemis was yet to find a gate into the world of the magicians. He feared that there was nothing to find, and that the youth was chasing a rainbow. Although, he forced himself to remember, Artemis had indeed found the proverbial pot of gold in his first discovery of a hidden civilization. They started traveling, to places as mundane as the old neighbourhoods of New York City, Berlin and Paris; and places as strange as the Valley of Kings in the Egyptian dessert, the Orkney Islands and the city of Charkhlik in China. During this expeditions, Artemis and Butler would explore locations that the Fowl heir had pointed in a map. Butler would make sure they were not interrupted, and Artemis would take notes. In the return flight he would often study them in silence. Butler was sure this trips served to confirm or discard Artemis’ theories on human magic. Nevertheless, he did not share his thoughts with him. Butler did not mind. He could hardly be of any help in this research, and he was busy maintaining his charge and himself alive. Let’s say some Arab chieftains held long grudges, and some New York art dealers didn’t like competition.</p>
<p>

Mrs. Fowl regarded the sudden urge of Artemis to travel as a result from the death of his father, so she didn’t try to stop him. She even encouraged him. Somehow, in between the investigation and the expeditions, Artemis found time to steal a historical diamond from an Italian rich, whose family had stolen it some centuries before; revive some of the old alliances of the Fowl family in the American underworld, and sell the Mona Lisa to an upstart dictator in the Middle East. For a couple of weeks, it almost felt as if everything had returned to normality. Butler dared to hope. It was useless of course.<br/>
</p>
<p>
One bright June morning, the telephone in the old office of Artemis Fowl I rang. That was the old business line. It had been silent for years. Dreading what may follow, Butler answered. Attending that line at all hours was part of his responsibilities. A raspy voice greeted him from the other side.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Hello, Butler. I see you are still kicking around. How come you now work for a kid?<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Cox. I didn’t know you were still in the islands. I heard the Garda made a deal to catch you- answered Butler, in a relaxed tone. He knew the man. Few men were as devious as him, and even less could inspire the same amount of respect he got from criminals and thieves. He did not play around either. He had called for a reason.<br/>
</p>
<p>
- I got a new arrangement now, working for Mr. Brown in London. Good man. He would like to speak with you some day.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-I already have a job.<br/>
</p>
<p>
- He could give you a better one. Come on, Butler. I know you; the Bear of Kiev does not belong in a palace.<br/>
</p>
<p>
- Does this conversation have a point? I never thought you were a talker.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Oh, I do have a point. Glad to see you are still there, friend. Don’t get mad at me. Turns out me and the boys have a new Acquisition. We found the wizard for your kid. I suppose now he can have his birthday party. Should we agree in a delivery point?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Butler was dumbstruck for a couple of seconds.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-You have him?<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Right here. A bit of a lunatic. We found him in a dirt hole in Glasgow, drinking himself to death, you know? But he is a gifted, no doubt. He fought when he was drunk, that’s how we found him. Scared a couple of the boys who were in Glasgow to collect.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Could it be true? A real wizard. Butler had seen strange things when travelling the world in his youth. Many of them he could not explain. He had run into a handful of people with strange capabilities. Gifted, they had been called. But wizards? Butler had listened to Artemis’ theories for months, but a part of him was not fully convinced yet.  On the other hand, Cox only called if he was thoroughly sure that he had the right man.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Do you still work with your old team?<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Same old bunch of bastards, but some are gone. The blasted guards got them.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Then come to the manor. You and Harding have been here before.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Don’t want anyone messing with your business, eh? – Cox sounded suspicious. – Is it true that the kid Fowl wants in again?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Butler frowned. What could he say? That his charge was indeed going to get involved in the criminal underworld against his better judgement? That he didn’t think that a thirteen-year-old should have anything to do with that kind of life? He grunted.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-I thought so -said Cox. -The boss will not like it.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Butler had supposed as much. When Mr. Fowl had announced his intention of cutting ties with the criminal world, many had celebrated. The departure of a crime lord always meant opportunities to escalate, climb the ladder of position within the firms. The return of the Fowls was definitely going to be perceived as a threat for the new leaders. Butler concentrated in that problem. That was one he could understand and solve, not like the wizard. He concerted a date with Cox and hung the phone. Then, he headed for the study.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Artemis was at his desk, absorbed in a voluminous tome in Latin, when Butler entered. He rose his hand, with his thin index finger pointing at the ceiling, and continued reading for a moment. After writing some notes in one of his investigation notebooks, he rose from his leather chair and looked at Butler.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-What is it, Butler? Has the CIA found something they can actually accuse us of? -he joked. His hair was still somewhat long and it gave him a juvenile air, in contrast to his pitch-black Armani suit. When Butler told him the news, his eyes widened and a feral smile, the one that could unsettle even a parliament member, appeared in his lips.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Alas -he said. -The real game has begun. We are lucky that mother is still in Belgium. Check all our security systems, we have to be ready for our guests.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When Cox and his companions arrived to Fowl Manor, they found it exactly as Artemis wanted, an imposing fortress ready for battle. Such effect was difficult to achieve with minimum personnel, but the omnipresent cameras and the high tech security did the trick. When they finally arrived to the hall where the young heir was waiting, more than one was already intimidated. Butler felt a little relief at that. Many of Cox’s new people were inexperienced, if things turned to worse, he had an advantage. Artemis was sitting on an old wooden chair, full of baroque carvings. His attire was impeccable and his whole demeanour reminded the one of a vampire. Time for business.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Cox’s gang stood close to each other on the other side of the hall. With the veterans in the centre, they advanced towards Artemis and Butler. Two of the more muscular men, were in charge of a tall, scrawny man with a bag covering his head. He didn’t speak, but he was twitching feebly, and the sounds that came from under the fabric told Butler that he was most likely gaged. When the bounty hunters were at an adequate distance, the bodyguard grunted and showed them the metal grip of the gun concealed in his suit. They stopped. Their prisoner was thrown in the floor in front of Artemis, and when he tried to crawl away he received a brutal kick in the stomach.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Here it is, master Fowl- said Cox. – Your gifted. Called himself a wizard. He wasn´t easy to capture.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Artemis regarded him, unimpressed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Do you have any proof of your words? I am not paying two million pounds for some hobo you found on a Glasgow gutter.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-He killed two of Brown’s boys that were drinking in the same bar as him. The others were there and still don’t know how he did it. Scared the hell out of them, poor boys. They say he shouted a word. We tried to recover the corpses but the bastard had burnt them. If your order hadn’t been sent, we would have killed this son of a bitch, to teach him a lesson. No one does that to the people of the boss.<br/>
</p>
<p>
- So you tell me I should give you the money, because a group of petty collectors say he killed a couple of them in an unknown way, while they were very drunk? That does not seem like a good argument to me. And no one can really say what happened, because this man disposed of the bodies. The only thing I know is that he is a pyromaniac.<br/>
Cox frowned. Butler remembered that he had never really met Artemis. He was not going to be that easy to convince.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-When we went to get him, he set the bar on fire, on an instant. That should not be possible. Besides, we have several witnesses of him declaring himself a magician, when he was very drunk. And we found this, in his possession. It was not easy to take it from him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Cox slid his hand under his coat. Butler took out his Sig Sauer on an instant and aimed. Two seconds later half a dozen guns were pointing at his chest. He knew he shouldn’t have trusted Cox. That new Mr. Brown must have send him to kill Artemis. Butler prepared to shoot and run, knowing that with the first sound of gunfire the security system would be triggered and start incapacitating the hostiles. But in that moment, Artemis raised his hand and time stopped.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Let us not lose our heads before time. What did you take from this man?<br/>
</p>
<p>
With slow movements, Cox pulled his hand out of his pocket. In his hand was a thin, crooked wand, made of wood. Butler didn’t low his weapon, but he glanced at Artemis. For an instant, he saw a flicker of triumph in his charge’s eyes. What did that mean? He looked down at the man on the floor. The supposed magician was very still, listening.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-You can lower your gun, Butler. Mr. Cox found what we asked for.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As he did as he was told, Butler felt the relief that invaded the men in front of him. Good. When it came down to a fight, reputation could make you win half the battle, or that is what Madame Ko, his old sensei, used to say.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Artemis stood up and approached the Acquisition. He extended a hand, and after a short moment of doubt, Cox gave him the wand.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Take off the hood.<br/>
</p>
<p>
After an instant of doubt, the nearest thug pulled the bag of fabric from the man’s head. He didn’t look like a magician, but then again, Butler was not sure how a magician should look. Robes and pointy hat? Probably not. The man was pale and gaunt, and there were dark circles under his bloodshot eyes. The cheap suit he was using was too big for him and his dark brown hair was a disaster difficult to believe. A black string of fabric, painfully tight, prevented him from talking. He was surely an outcast, desperate and dangerous. Butler wondered what he had done to be expelled of the magical society, besides setting things on fire, of course.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Now take of the gag.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Not sure if that’s a good idea, kid. He said those weird words when we got him too.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-I think you forgot who you are talking to, Cox -said Artemis, with a voice cold as ice. -My name is Artemis Fowl II, and your payment has been reduced to one and a half million pounds.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A wave of new unsettlement rushed through the room. Butler cursed inwardly. ‘Artemis, don’t pull any games on the subject of a hunter’s payment’. How many times had he told him that?<br/>
</p>
<p>
-He can´t do anything right now. Take. Off. The. Gag.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And once again, Artemis made a miracle. A dozen of muscular men, who had been told they would not get their money by a thirteen year old, remained silent, and did as he told them to. When the gag was removed, the man gasped and coughed. Artemis made a gesture, and Butler handed him a glass of water. But when he approached the magician, the man backed away suddenly. Butler tried to conceal his bewilderment. And then he saw the man’s expression. He saw madness, confusion, fear, and suspicion, all at once. That man was dangerous, but he was afraid of the young master. Why?<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Fowl? -he said, with a raspy voice. -Your name is Fowl?<br/>
</p>
<p>
He never lost sight of his wand. Looking back and forth between it and Artemis.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-That is right. Artemis Fowl II, and you are?<br/>
</p>
<p>
The man narrowed his eyes, but after a moment answered:<br/>
</p>
<p>
-I suppose it would be stupid to try to hide. I’m Selwyn. Roger Selwyn.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Artemis offered the glass of water again, and this time Selwyn took it. While he quenched his thirst, Artemis turned towards Cox.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-I suppose everything is in order. You can go now. Your payment awaits you at the door.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Two million pounds as promised, right young master?<br/>
</p>
<p>
-One and a half. You disrespected me. And be grateful that I didn’t call the Garda. They are still looking for you, you know. And Butler has friends everywhere.<br/>
Cox clenched his fists. Butler wondered how fast could he take him down. He used to be tough.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Shall I tell everyone that the Fowl’s heir does not hold his word? That he is not only a child but a liar as well?<br/>
</p>
<p>
- You can say whatever you want, but they -Artemis pointed at the other bounty hunters- saw what happened. You insulted me because I’m young. Two times by now. I say I’m being generous by giving you this much money.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Butler saw the others nodding and he found himself doing the same. Under the rules of the underworld, disrespect towards the crime lords did not go unpunished.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-So you are reclaiming the rights of your family -said Cox. – Blood will flow for this, Fowl.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Is that a threat?<br/>
</p>
<p>
-A warning.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-I am aware of these new bosses you lot have now. You will find soon enough that they are no rivals for me. Say hello to your Mr. Brown. Tell him that his Torchwood file was a very interesting read. As was yours.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And then, Butler saw something he thought he would never see. Cox paled, without words. Butler frowned. He and Artemis had agreed that they would not tell anyone that he had managed to get inside the files of country’s most secretive security organization as of yet. It had happened when Artemis was sure that the government dealt with the magicians through them. They didn’t. But the information they had accessed was worth a fortune.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-How do you…? How could you know that?<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Ah, you see, Mr. Cox, I happen to be brilliant. Good afternoon.<br/>
</p>
<p>
After that, there was nothing more to say. Cox and his people left the hall. They would get their money once they were out of the manor. Butler saw them leave. Just before he strode out, Cox looked back, at Artemis, who was looking out the window, seemingly not paying attention. And he saw a dark promise in his face. Cox would try to harm Artemis, not only for the sake of his business. It was personal now. Butler got a bad feeling. When things got personal they could turn out very bloody.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Once they were all out, Artemis turned to Butler.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Take Mr. Selwyn to the main hall. It is time we have a good talk.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Butler was surprised with how easy was to drag Selwyn through the house, considering the man had resisted Cox and his gang till the very end. However, this Selwyn appeared to be completely devoid of fight. He walked besides Butler in complete silence, while Artemis lead the way three steps forward. While they walked, he looked around the halls with a glint of hunger in his eyes. The interior of the manor was conservative, with the kind of elegant austerity that came with an old and wealthy bloodline. Butler noticed that the eyes of Selwyn were drawn to the antique portraits of the Fowls, and a frown appeared in his face. Did those pictures mean something for him? This man had said he recognized the name Fowl, but there was no way of telling if he spoke the truth. Butler did not drop his guard. If there was the slightest possibility that this man was a magician, he was not giving him any chance to harm Artemis. When they reached the green hall, the one that Artemis had deceptively named the main hall, Butler heard him whisper.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-That’s more like it…<br/>
</p>
<p>
-You may take a seat- said Artemis. Butler pushed Selwyn into one of the arm chairs with little care for his limbs.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-You know my name -continued the young heir as he toyed with the wand. – Therefore, you probably know about the family’s reputation. I’ll ask it just once, where do the magicians hide?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Artemis pointed the wand at him. Selwyn looked at him dumbfounded for a second. And he laughed. It was an almost hysterical sound.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-So you know nothing? They really tried to forget about everything? – He laughed again. Butler wondered what sound would come out of that mouth if he buried his fist in his abdomen.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Where do the wizards and witches hide? You can put down that. I bet my life, you don’t even know how to use it.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Artemis narrowed his eyes, but after a moment he lowered his hand.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Very well, Mr. Selwyn.  You got me there. My father raised me apart from the magical world or however you call it. I do not know how to use a wand, but my family is old. And some magic does not require such mundane instruments.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The gaze that Artemis fixed on the man was positively devious. Butler supressed a shiver. He sometimes forgot the way Artemis could conjure up emotions in his usually serene expression. Selwyn stared, incredulous.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-You mean…? It’s impossible! You are far too young!<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Careful, Selwyn. I am not in the mood to hear a single comment more about my age.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Selwyn looked down, somewhat shaken.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-No one would do that- he said, softly. -Not even the Malfoys or Lestranges would teach that to a child.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Are you saying that I’m a liar? Why couldn’t my parents teach me this magic?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Selwyn raised his head once again, and smiled. It was not a nice sight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Of course, you wouldn’t know, if you have lived all your life away from everything. You wouldn’t know how twisted it is to teach blood magic to a child. Your father did this? Who was your mother?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Blood magic. And whatever fame had gathered Artemis Fowl senior, it never reached Angeline. Butler felt the ghost of a smile tensing his lips. Artemis’ ruse was working.<br/>
-You are here to answer my questions, not the other way around. And I think I already made one.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Selwyn crossed his arms.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-I refuse. You cannot harm me. I’m a Selwyn. We have blood magic protections, and our line is purer than yours.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Butler looked carefully. His brow twitched. He was nervous. Selwyn was not sure of his statement. When Artemis looked in his direction, Butler signalled a single letter. False. Artemis nodded minutely, in agreement.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Are you sure of that, Roger? – asked Artemis. -I think not. You know very little about my family. In fact, you said earlier that you don’t even know who my mother is. Anyway it does not matter at all. I can use other methods. Your gun, Butler.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Artemis extended a hand. ‘It is ok’ Butler told himself. ‘He is acting. Artemis is just a good actor’. He hoped he was good enough. The Sig Sauer looked too big on his young charge’s hand. Artemis pointed at Selwyn the second weapon of the evening.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Answer the question.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Selwyn remained stubbornly silent. ‘He is not buying it’ Butler realized.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Why do you want to know? You Fowls said, you were not coming back. Looking to the future, not the past, you said.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And in that moment, Butler knew that at least some part of this was true. The man was talking of the real Mr. Fowl. In the last years, he had repeated that phrase often enough for it to be engraved in the brains of everyone close to him. Artemis fired the gun. The bullet grazed Selwyn’s messy hair. When the man tried to jump away, Butler held him by the shoulders. Inwardly, the bodyguard was fighting to contain his panic. Had Artemis really fired that gun? The trajectory of the bullet had been very close to hit Selwyn. Was that a lucky shot from an amateur, or had he tried to kill the man? When he saw Artemis’ face his blood run cold. Darkness. Maddening and desperate. It was barely the shadow of an emotion, but in Artemis’ usually inexpressive features, it was as notorious as a scream.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Answer me, Selwyn. I know more than you think. Before he died, my father told me everything I need to know if you lie. Tell me what happened.<br/>
</p>
<p>
His right hand, where he clutched the Sig Sauer, was trembling.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Where are the purebloods?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Butler was about to interfere; the interrogatory was getting too personal. But then looked back at Selwyn. That last phrase surely meant something to him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-So you were… loyal?<br/>
</p>
<p>
A sudden horror made his whole body shiver. He threw himself to the floor and kneeled.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-My sincerest apologies, my lord. As your family did, the other faithful are also hiding, though their reclusion is less… severe. When they know about you they will welcome you, oh yes. A young wizard, well versed in the Dark Arts. I can take you to them, gracious master, if you so desire.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Artemis recovered his composure. He lowered the gun.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-If they are hiding, why are you here? How could I trust you?<br/>
</p>
<p>
-The aurors were suspicious, even when I was declared innocent by the Wizengamot! I could not get a job, and the families that had survived the war refused to help me. They said I would cause them trouble and they cast me away! As if they are not looking for trouble themselves! I know everything about their secret plots. But they never work, Dumbledore and the Ministry are always watching.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The change operated in the wizard was sickening. Even his voice had become servile, as he crawled towards Artemis, who held both the wand and the gun.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-What are they trying to do, the other purebloods?<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Bring back the Dark Lord, of course, but they cannot succeed. It is impossible, but they refuse to give up.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Is he dead, then?<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Yes, master. He is gone and we are left alone. His loyal followers, hunted like rats by the dogs of the Ministry. What else could I do? I couldn’t stay in the wizarding world. I had to escape!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Butler felt an upcoming headache. What was all that supposed to mean? ‘No, that’s not your job. Concentrate. Artemis will put it all together. And Selwyn is too bloody close to him right now.’  He dragged the snivelling man away from his charge, finding no resistance, and shoved him in his previous seat.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-I’m not a traitor, my lord -he continued babbling. – But I had no choice. I will tell you everything, and I can show you. If you come with me…<br/>
</p>
<p>
-That won’t be necessary, Mr. Selwyn -said Artemis. -The only thing you need to do is point a few places in a map. Where is the nearest point where I could find both the wizarding world and the purebloods?<br/>
</p>
<p>
-That would be Diagon Alley, master. It’s in London.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Artemis made a gesture, and Butler approached the table with the maps. Artemis had been prepared for everything. There were maps of the whole United Kingdom, the middle East, France, the city of Jerusalem, a place called Alexandretta and an even older diagram of a city named Shangri-La. Or Butler thought it was a city. In the section of Europe’s most important cities, he found the one he needed. He put the detailed map of London on the table in front of Selwyn.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Mark the entrance.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From then on, Selwyn cooperated. In fact, he was more than happy to do anything Artemis required. They sat at the table, and he rambled endlessly about the supposed joy that the ‘faithful’ would feel when the Fowl name returned. Butler did not believe a word. These purebloods sounded dangerous. When Selwyn was explaining how to get to a place called Borgin and Burkes, he was interrupted by Artemis.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Do they know of me, the other faithful?<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Oh, they will recognize the name Fowl, master. Every respectable wizard and witch knows of your family.  You will need to be careful, though. Some of the faithful are bitter, that some of us did not joined their wild goose chase for bringing back the Dark Lord. If you go to Borgin and Burkes, watch out for Lucius. He was always talking about making the Lord return.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Artemis nodded and let the magician continue, but Butler could tell, he was barely paying attention. When they were done, Artemis stood up.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-You were worth your price, Mr. Selwyn. Do you think our families could meet again someday?<br/>
</p>
<p>
-All the faithful in my family are gone, young master. Those who remain do not deserve the name Selwyn. But I will always be at your service. I see that your family has fared well in the outside world. I don’t have any hope of doing as much. But if you would let me serve you, I could help you will be ahead of your enemies every time.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-I have yet to present myself in the wizarding world, Selwyn -said Artemis. – It is too soon to make enemies.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Of course, young master. But the time will come, when you will have them. You know the ways of our kin.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-When that happens, I promise I will consider you. Until then, farewell.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Selwyn seemed disappointed, but he was far too scared of Artemis to complain. So he straightened his suit as much as he could, which was, not nearly enough, and prepared himself to depart. Just before Butler escorted him outside, Artemis approached and offered his hand.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Good bye, Mr. Selwyn. When the time comes, I will find you.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Selwyn extended his hand. The needle sparkled and was buried in the magician’s hand on an instant. Selwyn gasped in surprise. Artemis pulled out the spike, covered in blood.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Of course I would prefer our meeting to remain a secret, for the time being. I trust there will be no unpleasant surprises there. Remember, Mr. Selwyn, that I will always find you.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The real meaning of his words was evident, as he waved the bloodied needle in front of the wizard. Butler groaned silently. Artemis was pushing his luck. But once again, his shot in the dark worked, and Selwyn paled even more than before, turning almost grey.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Yes, master Fowl. – he said, defeated.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-Farewell, Selwyn. Butler will give you your wand back when you are out of the manor. Try not to do anything stupid.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-*-*-*-
</p>
<p>
Capitan Jack Harkness took the cell-phone he was not supposed to have out of his pocket, and played the video. He had had a rough day. He needed to hear it again. He needed to remember why was he doing this. The face of his friend became alive in the screen, as decided and energetic as always.<br/>
</p>
<p>
-This working? Jack, before I change, here is a list of instructions for when I’m human. One, do not let me commit suicide if for some reason I want to. The memories I´m going to leave with me could be a little too much at some point. Two, don’t let me hurt anyone. We can’t have that, but you know what humans are like. Three, don’t worry about the Tardis. I’ll put it in emergency power so they can’t detect it. Besides, being underground beneath the ruins we are just about to make should shield it pretty well from everything. Just let it hide away. Five. No, wait a minute, four. No getting involved in big historical events. Five, Rose. Don´t let me abandon Rose. I have calculated our chances of meeting each other in ninety percent. But still, you never know. Six, you, captain. Don’t let me leave you. John Dorian Smith is a character I made up, but I won’t know that. And since this regeneration is almost an exact copy of my original self, he will be… difficult, even as a human. And he might want to do something stupid or impossible, so… Anyway. Where was I? Oh, yes, seven. Do not let me develop an addiction.<br/></p>
<p>
Jack listened to everything. All twenty-seven instructions, even the creepy ones. He laughed at the one about pears, as he did every time. Same old Doctor.<br/></p>
<p>
-Twenty-six. Don´t let the wizards know that we are time travellers. Things could get bad. They have already discovered time travel by the twenty-first century, but they have rules for it. Nice rules, if a bit unnecessary. My people may have been involved in their creation. We don’t want them reconsidering how much they can mess around. And twenty-seven. Never, under any circumstance, allow me to open the watch before the day we talked about. Everything I am is kept safe in there. Now, I’ve put an energy lock on it so the human me won’t be able to open it. I have selected memories so he will care for it, but he may get curious. Never underestimate my curiosity, Jack. I can get very crafty. Do. Not. Let. Me. Open. It. Because once it’s open, the Blood Hounds will be able to find me. It all depends on you, Jack. If everything fails, take Rose and leave me. They will probably let you go if they have me. Oh, and thank you. Thank you for everything.<br/></p>
<p>
The video ended. Jack stared at the screen. He felt a little bit stronger. He could do that. He had just had a hard day.</p>
<p>
It had been worse at the beginning. In the days after the Ministry had ‘rescued’ the boy, Jack had almost opened the bloody thing. John Dorian Smith had been found unconscious and with burns all over his body in the ruins of the castle of Avalon, clutching a silver watch. He had stayed in a comma for almost a week before waking up in St. Mungo. All had been orchestrated, of course, but when Jack met the eyes of that boy for the first time, he wished he could back down. This was just too cruel. In order to enter the wizarding world, the Doctor had designed characters for him and his companions. Jack was going to be the auror and their guardian, since his psychic signature was unknown to the creatures that were after them. For Rose and him, it was going to be more complicated. They had to hide their previous selves so well that not even an ancient race of space vampires could find them. So they changed, not only their minds but also their bodies.<br/></p>
<p>
Rose was safe, or as safe as she could be while in the hands of nuns, which wasn’t much, as Jack had gotten tired of saying while designing the plan. She was hiding as an orphan girl in St. Anselm Home for Infants. The sisters were aware of the wizarding world as they had found many gifted children in the long history of the institution they served. With time, the Mother Superior and all the others that knew the secret decided to protect the children they had taken into custody instead of leaving them to the mercy of the witch-hunters. When the time came, they sent them to Hogwarts, and were more than happy with the results.
</p>
<p>
Doing this had become a tradition between the sisters, one that only stopped once, during the time of Sister Barbara, as Mother Superior or, as everyone else now called her, Bloody Barbara. Her reign had been violent and short-lived, and once it was over the sisters of St. Anselm swore to never again let any woman of narrow convictions become the highest authority.  And so, even though they were aware of Rose’s recently awakened magic, they didn’t cast her away. In their minds, they had cared for the blonde girl all her life. Why would they abandon her only because she could make cups float?
</p>
<p>
Sometimes Jack was a little afraid of the Doctor. He had altered the memories of the entire sisterhood just to give Rose a good cover. Jack visited her twice a month, under the excuse of being the contact with the Ministry of Magic. She was a healthy girl; younger than the boy the Doctor had become. Surely, her Hogwarts acceptance letter had already arrived. Next time he saw her, he would introduce himself as an auror, not only a benefactor of the orphanage. Jack was sure she was going to smile as only his Rose could, bright as the sun. The absence of her parents hadn’t taken her light away. But the Doctor… Jack sighed.<br/></p>
<p>
His friend had crafted a story for himself that closely resembled the real one, as far as Jack could tell. He had given his human and younger version many of the memories of his early life in his lost planet. Some of the destruction of it too. And so, the person that had woken up in that hospital bed had been a terribly scarred boy who had lost everyone he had loved, still in shock by the annihilation of his whole world. Only then had Jack started to comprehend the profound sadness that seemed to constantly linger around his friend. The Time Lord had been able to carry on, but the human boy… Let’s say Jack had understood the priority of the first instruction.

As one of the aurors sent by the Ministry to help the isolated community of wizards that inhabited the island of Avalon, Jack had been there when the kid was found in the ruins of the stone castle. He took care of the unconscious boy, and when he was sent to the hospital, he visited constantly. When John Dorian Smith woke up, he wouldn’t talk to anyone. Jack was one of the few capable of getting a response from him, and so he was eventually named his official guardian. Nobody was sure of what to do about the thin and silent boy. Avalon had been an isolated community since its foundation in the XV century. The only information the Ministry had about them came from travellers who had navigated those seas and set foot themselves on the Island of Sunset. So the plan worked perfectly.

Jack took Dorian Smith with him to his flat right over Diagon Alley, and waited for his recovery. For weeks, the boy didn’t speak. The Doctor had warned him about that. Without the TARDIS translating, he would need to learn English from zero. But there was more to his silence than that. Jack had seen what he was doing in soldiers, traumatized by the war. The absent look as he tried to cope with what had happened. But then, just before Jack’s resolve shattered, a miracle happened. Dorian, who treaded on life as if everything was made of glass, awoke for the second time. He laughed at one of Jack’s jokes, and life returned to his eyes. That had happened almost a year ago.<br/></p>
<p>
A sudden noise in the other side of the darkened room brought Jack back to the present, and he shoved the cell-phone in his pocket.<br/></p>
<p>
-Is that you Jack?<br/></p>
<p>
Dorian came through the door of his room.<br/></p>
<p>
-That’s right, pal. It’s a little bit late to be up.<br/></p>
<p>
-I’m thirteen!<br/></p>
<p>
-You are still shorter than me, so you go to sleep when I say so.<br/></p>
<p>
The boy approached. Jack took out his wand and illuminated the room. Magic. It still amazed him. Dorian was in front of him with a spark in his eyes and his brown hair dishevelled as always.<br/></p>
<p>
-Did you brought it?<br/></p>
<p>
Jack smiled his best, biggest smile. He took the book out of his other pocket and gave it to him. Dorian took it almost with reverence.<br/></p>
<p>
-Stephen Hawking, Roger Penrose, yes! Two of the best scientists in history, clashing against each other. Brilliant! They’re brilliant!<br/></p>
<p>
His excitement was contagious. Same old Doctor.<br/></p>
<p>
-Whatever you say but be careful. I don’t want the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office on my back. Never leave it where a visit could see.<br/></p>
<p>
-Promise.<br/></p>
<p>
The boy was already reading the first pages. He had a special fascination for the stars that Jack understood better than he himself did. He had devoured every book on magical astronomy that Jack could find. When there was nothing else to read, he had seemed devastated.<br/></p>
<p>
-I have this feeling, Jack- he had said. -That there is much more to the stars than what this books say.<br/></p>
<p>
So Jack had been an idiot, and bought him a book on muggle astronomy. Some days he still regretted it. The non-magical study of the sky had enraptured Dorian, to the point when he forgot to eat or sleep.<br/></p>
<p>
-You are not staying up to read it. -ordered Jack. -Tomorrow is a busy day.<br/></p>
<p>
-Is it?<br/></p>
<p>
-Hey! Eyes on me, smart boy.<br/></p>
<p>
-Sorry, what?<br/></p>
<p>
-I went to Gringotts today. Withdraw some of your family’s money. You are going to buy everything you need for Hogwarts.<br/></p>
<p>
As a matter of fact, the money had been put in the bank by the Doctor himself almost four hundred years ago, to help them with the expenses. Under the name of Smith, he had made several deposits on different dates. To the goblins, the Smiths were an old lineage who resided in Avalon, wealthy and isolated.<br/></p>
<p>
-You are not coming?<br/></p>
<p>
-I have been called to the headquarters. Probably going on a mission.<br/></p>
<p>
Dorian nodded, distracted.<br/></p>
<p>
-However, I will come back so you better do what you should. Do not get distracted by every new thing you see.<br/></p>
<p>
-Have you been in this street? Not getting distracted is impossible!<br/></p>
<p>
-Then make an effort!<br/></p>
<p>
The boy looked at him for a moment. That was a good sign.<br/></p>
<p>
-I will.<br/></p>
<p>
- Go to sleep then. And stop worrying about Hogwarts. You will do fine.<br/></p>
<p>
Dorian left. Jack would check in a moment if he was really going to bed. He was brilliant, just like the Doctor; and when he was interested in something he put aside everything else. That was why Jack was not worried about the boarding school. Dorian had been invited to attend, as he now was in condition to do so, but he would have to take levelling courses. He had missed the first two years of school. After a little talking, Jack had convinced him to accept. It was part of the plan, or so he believed. After all, Rose was going to start her first year on September. They were supposed to be near each other. It would be fine. He could do that.<br/></p>
<p>
‘But for how long?’ he wondered. He hadn’t seen any of the signs the Doctor had told him to expect. ‘How many years are we going to be stuck here, in this hidden and extravagant world?’ Jack had no idea. The only thing he could do was trust the Doctor’s plan. Trust his friend. He could do that. Right?</p>
