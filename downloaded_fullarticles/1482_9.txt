Harry's hands shook in either rage or amusement, he wasn't too sure which. He had been forcibly woken this morning by his Aunt Petunia's screeching. Even so, he hadn't quite believed it. He had died... But he was back. Harry absently tossed the letter down on the table and dug through the side table to find appropriate paper to reply with. Vernon made a sort of aborted whimper as Harry picked out the man's best pen to reply. Harry purposely pressed too hard, damaging the nib. Other than the scratching of the fountain pen, the kitchen remained silent. With a flourish Harry signed his name and walked over to the back door opening it and looking expectantly at the sky. A moment later one of the Hogwarts owls dislodged itself from the tree it had been waiting in and flew down to collect the reply.<br/>
"Come, Vernon. I wish you to drive me to London."<br/>
Harry's uncle went from dark red to a violent shade of purple. Harry smirked, and wiggled his fingers, causing Dudley to start spinning on the spot, where he was hanging upside down from invisible strings in the air. He looked like he wanted to scream. Silencing charms were so <em>handy</em>.<br/>
"If you're good, I'll let them down when we return." Harry added. On the ceiling next to him, Petunia whimpered. Harry hadn't silenced the elder Dursleys, just told them if they made too much noise then Dudley would never make any noise ever again.<br/>
Diagon alley… Harry hadn't been there in decades. Harry didn't have his Gringotts key yet, but <em>that</em> wasn't going to stop him. He was feeling vindictive, and this time around <em>Vernon</em> would pay for his first year gear. Harry had already summoned the man's wallet and emptied it. After all, Vernon wouldn't need any money while waiting all day in the car. Besides, it may <em>seem</em> like decades ago to Harry that Dudley had spent the day before prodding him with his smelting stick, but Harry's eleven year old body still had the bruises from 'yesterday'.<br/>
The smirk on Harry's lips widened. <em>This time</em> things would be <em>very</em> different.<br/>

Oh this was <em>precious</em>. Tom had been mildly horrified to wake up in his eleven year old body, but seeing as he had been <em>dead</em> just moments earlier, he had soon got over any squeamishness. The only problem being that he clearly didn't have any horcruxes (he <em>still</em> couldn't believe the Potter brat had managed to find them all!) and when he had accosted his roommate to exterminate it for just such a ritual, Tom's very being (Tom <em>supposed</em> you could call it his soul) had struggled with everything it had and the boy survived (though even after a memory charm he had immediately begged to sleep on the floor in the next room over, rather than stay with Tom).<br/>
The majority of Tom had been locked in cold lonely objects for decades and apparently had no interest in being separated from his body again. It was utterly frustrating. In the mean time Tom had tied his life to seven of his fellow orphans so he had some protection, though it was minimal as it was slowly draining them and would probably only last a year or two before they perished. But really, Tom wasn't some weak eleven year old, even if his body looked it. He didn't remember much of the previous eleven years this body had lived, but he was familiar with malnutrition, and with the scars dotting his arms from cigarette burns. When the teenage blonde muggle and his six followers stinking of smokes had turned up to torment Tom that morning while the matron was distracted, they had not been prepared for a fully fuming Dark Lord. even without his wand he was still more than capable enough to incapacitate them.<br/>
But Tom was being distracted.<br/>
His eyes fell back on the parchment, then flicked to a calendar with insipid puppies hanging above his (ex-)roommates bed. It was summer of '91 and for a moment Tom contemplated whether or not it was worth the risk of going to Hogwarts. He had protection from any of the more deadly of the old man's plots for at least this year, and both Potter and the Philosophers stone would be conveniently in one place. Practically tied up with a bow ready and waiting for Tom to steal/annihilate them.<br/>
Yes.<br/>
With a decisive nod Tom stalked over to the tiny window and opened it. While he waited for the Hogwarts owl he penned a carefully worded response. The letter's ink was in purple not green, so Ravenclaw's Quill had included him on the list of those that didn't need a staff introduction, which was something at least. Mcgonagall couldn't have read the names when she was signing the pile (otherwise no doubt half of the Light-side would have stormed the orphanage) and when she received Tom's reply Hogwarts' magic would accept him and there would be nothing that they could (legally) do. Perhaps he would amuse himself and toy with them for a little while. There would be no proof, after all, that Tom Riddle was anything more than an unfortunately named eleven year old. Perhaps his past didn't even exist here? Hell, Tom was still tossing up between time travel and an alternate universe. Though the second seemed more likely as he had <em>died</em> first.<br/>
Merlin but he wanted to throttle the Potter brat!<br/>

Gellert was fully fluent in English, but it had been such a long time since he'd had anything to read, in any language, that it took him far longer than he would like to admit, to register even the address. Then he had got stuck on the second line of the letter. <em>Albus bloody Dumbledore!</em> Gellert glared at the letter, then at the owl that was now perched on a low branch of the bush Gellert was concealed behind.<br/>
<br/>
In his time as a Dark Lord Gellert had experienced some odd things. He had always <em>terrible</em> luck with rituals. They never <em>hurt</em> him, however they often didn't do exactly what he expected. He had once spent a full two weeks as some sort of fish-centuar hybrid when trying to gain <em>mage-sight</em>.<br/>
But this took the cake.<br/>
He was eleven. And he was <em>free</em>! Gods but he was never building a inescapable prison <em>ever</em> again! It was rather sad when an upstart Dark Lord coming to raid your mind and kill you was a <em>welcome</em> distraction.<br/>
<br/>
Much to the orphanage staff's dismay Gellert had spent the majority of the morning flitting around the small adjacent park like some crazy animal. But Gellert didn't care. He had spent a good ten minutes rubbing his face against the freshly cut grass.<br/>
Fortunately he had come enough to his senses to do some quick wandless compulsions. The staff had been taking turns warily following him around while the rest of them held a panicked meeting about one of their charges going stark raving mad overnight. It wasn't like Gellert <em>cared</em>, they were just muggle filth, but he had put his foot down the moment they mentioned sending him to some asylum. He would <em>not</em> be being locked up.<br/>
Eventually, some time in the late afternoon (and safe from insipid staff breakdowns, now they were under permanent compulsions to prioritise other things) Gellert finally realised he had also been stalked all day by a large barn owl. Then any remaining sanity he could lay claim to left him as he realised that he had received an invitation to Albus <em>bloody</em> Dumbledore's school!<br/>
After Gellert calmed down from a slightly hysterical laughing fit he had re-read the letter with some more rational thought.<br/>
Clearly something odd was going on here. Albus was dead. Hell, come to think of it, <em>Gellert</em> was dead. So after calming down a little Gellert had delved into his ritual-enhanced mindscape (which he had achieved when he had been trying to gain the ability to fly) and searched out the memory of death. He <em>had</em> died, but the death-magic he had felt then was still tingling lightly on his skin when he woke up that morning too. Clearly Death (the entity) had something to do with this, and frankly, Gellert was <em>delighted</em>. unlike the majority of Dark Lords throughout history Gellert had little interest in avoiding death beyond a reasonable lifetime. No he wanted to work <em>with</em> Death… preferably for an eternity. He had actually begun studying as a Necromancer but one of the first rituals botched itself and made the option impossible, so he had resigned himself to planning muggle domination and genocide instead.<br/>
But <em>this</em> appeared to be a gift from Death.<br/>
What is more, so long as the rest of this universe was in line with the original one, Albus <em>bloody</em> Dumbledore had <em>his</em> wand. And the old fool had invited him to his school. Or at least, Gellert had received an invitation which (if Hogwarts was anything like Durmstrang) once initiated couldn't be withdrawn. Hogwarts always <em>had</em> been rather liberal. Gellert supposed that they must just have an automatic duplication charm on the school letters meaning their was <em>no</em> discrimination against letting the mudbloods into the school. Urgh! There was a reason Gellert hadn't attended Hogwarts after being expelled from Durmstrang. But <em>still</em>, this was just too much of an opportunity to pass over.<br/>
The Elder Wand was at Hogwarts, so to Hogwarts Gellert would go. And if that just so happened to open up the perfect opportunity for taunting his ex-lover, <em>well</em>.<br/>
Jauntily Gellert signed the acceptance reply and handed it to the owl that had been hovering around him. The owl flew off and Gellert toasted the sky with an invisible glass.<br/>
"To Albus <em>bloody</em> Dumbledore… may he enjoy <em>my</em> wand while he still has it."</p>
