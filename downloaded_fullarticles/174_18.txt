    <p>"The girl is about to be eleven years old Severus..." Albus started, looking down at the dark-haired man who stood tall. "But it is still not the time."</p><p>Severus' eyes filled with horror at the headmasters' comment. "What do you mean it is still not the time?" He replied, his voice remaining monotone.</p><p>"The boy is still not old enough; we need to keep them together." </p><p>"Forget the boy, he-"</p><p>"We cannot Severus." Albus interrupted. "He is just as important as her."</p><p>Severus took a deep breath before speaking again, keeping his frustration low. "She will not be able to control her magic for another four years, Albus. I have been watching her. She is powerful, just like her mother. But if she doesn't get any training or help it will take over her. She doesn't know what she is doing."</p><p>Albus smiled slightly. "So you have been keeping an eye on her?" Severus scoffed.</p><p>"Of course I have."</p><p>There was a silence before Albus spoke again.</p><p>"She looks a lot like Lily..." </p><p>The potions teacher sighed softly as he gave a slight nod. "She does..." and with that, he walked away to exit the headmasters' office, but paused as Albus spoke for the last time.</p><p>"I know you care for the girl Severus, but promise me when I say, it will be much better for her to stay with her brother, even if you don't like the boy. She's strong, and I'm sure she understands a lot more than we realise. She will be safe."</p>
