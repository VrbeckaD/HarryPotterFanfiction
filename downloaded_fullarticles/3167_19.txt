    <p>John was lying on his bed on that Saturday afternoon, wondering who to ask to the Valentine ball that was on Friday evening. He had crushes on both Luna Lovegood and Ginny Weasley but didn’t know which one to ask or if he’d have the courage to do it.</p>
<p>In the end, he decided to ask Ginny. He may have had more feelings for Luna, but everyone around the school knew her as a weirdo. John knew that he was probably weirder, but in a way that wasn’t as easily shown. He didn’t want it shown or even guessed at by him going with Luna.</p>
<p>He walked to the Great Hall but couldn’t see Ginny at the Gryffindor table. The problem with him being in Hufflepuff was that it was harder for him to see Ginny or Luna. He went down to the lake to see if she was there.</p>
<p>John arrived at the lake, and Ginny was there with Fred and George. ‘This could get embarrassing,’ he thought, ‘I don’t want Fred and George to know I’m asking Ginny to the ball.’</p>
<p>“Thanks for the skiving snack boxes. That got me out of double History of Magic,” John told them.<br/>	“No problem,’ John said, looking at him. Ginny said hi, John returned it, and then said he used to like History at his primary school.</p>
<p>John soon realised that Fred and George weren’t going to go away. They were soon splashing each other with water, so he took his chance and asked,<br/>	“Ginny, can I have a word?”<br/>	“Sure.” Ginny replied, and John lead her out of earshot of the twins.<br/>	“Ginny,” he said nervously, “I was wondering if … if you would like to go to the ball with me?”<br/>	“I would love to go to the ball with you, John.” she said, smiling.<br/>	“Really?” John gasped, “but I thought you fancied Harry?”<br/>	“No, that’s just what people think.”<br/>	“I haven’t actually been to a wizard ball before,” John admitted to Ginny, “are they much different to muggle balls?”<br/>	“Not really, they’re mostly the same.”</p>
<p>John was overjoyed that Ginny had agreed to go with him, and after saying bye, walked happily back to his common room. Then he looked at his phone (Dumbledore had somehow made it work despite all the magic in the air). He saw that none of his muggle friends had replied to his messages. His emotions were mixed: happy that Ginny had agreed to go to the ball; guilty that he hadn’t asked Luna; worried that some of his Hogwarts friends were starting to think he was weird; and sad that his muggle friends were ignoring him.</p>
<p>The next day, John tried to phone his best friend (Ivy) but it went straight to voicemail. That meant she was in a lecture at uni, as her phone was on at all other times. That made his stress out, as he really needed to talk to someone. He tried to find Alivia, as she seemed the most sympathetic and understanding person at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Raven Weasley was at the lake. She sighed, ‘if only I wasn’t a blood traitor, she thought, putting air quotes around the ‘blood traitor’.</p>
<p>Alivia was in the Great Hall, having breakfast. John saw her. He didn’t feel like breakfast. To be honest, he never felt like breakfast, but especially today. He waited outside for Alivia to come.</p>
<p>Raven decided to head back inside. She transformed into a fox, and walked in. She looked for a quiet spot to turn back to her normal self. She thought she found one, and changed back, but didn’t notice John.<br/>	“What did you just do?” John asked<br/>	“I, uh,” she sighed, “well, to put it bluntly, I’m an Animagus…”<br/>	“What’s an Animagus?” John asked, “Sorry if that sound like a stupid question, but I’m muggle born.”<br/>	“Oh, it’s where you can turn into an animal…” she sighed, “What house are you in?”<br/>	“Hufflepuff,” he replied, “and you?”<br/>	“Gryffindor,” then she paused, “with my 4 brothers and 1 sister.”<br/>	“5 siblings!” John exclaimed<br/>	“Oh, no. They’re just the ones who haven’t left yet.”<br/>	“Wait, so hoe many do you have?”<br/>	“Hm…” she said, starting to count on her fingers, “seven. 6 boys and 1 girl, 2 including me.”<br/>	“Is one of them Ginny Weasley?” John asked, recognising her red hair.<br/>	“Yes! You know her?”<br/>	“Know her? She’s going to the Valentine’s ball with me.”<br/>	“Well at least she’s got a date.” Raven sighed.<br/>	“How are you doing on that front?”<br/>	“Nobody likes me…” she sighed and looked away, “because of my eyes, basically.”<br/>	“I like you,” John replied.<br/>	“No…I mean no one likes me enough to ask me out or something…”<br/>	“My advice is asking someone who likes you as a friend. You can choose whether or not to take that advice, though, my advice is usually rubbish.”<br/>	“And…I have no friends…”<br/>	“That’s a lie.”<br/>	“No, it’s the truth, well, except my brothers…they’re horrible at advice.”<br/>	“I’m your friend. I would ask you to the ball, but I’m already going with Ginny.”<br/>	“Yeah…”</p>
<p>John had just noticed that Alivia had come out of the hall. He needed to speak to her.<br/>	“I’ll talk to you later,” John told Raven, “but I really do need to talk to Alivia now.”<br/>	“Yeah…ok…I’ll see you around, just look for a fox!” She then transformed and scampered off to the lake.<br/>	“Alivia, can I talk to you?” John asked.<br/>	“Course.” Alivia replied.<br/>	“It will probably bore you to death, but I need to speak to someone.”<br/>	“Ok, go on.”<br/>	“Ok. Basically, my who life is a big mess at the moment. Ginny is going to the ball with me, but I feel guilty about not asking Luna or Raven, sad that all of my muggle friends are ignoring me and worried that people here start to think I’m weird. I am weird, but I don’t want people thinking I am.”<br/>	“It doesn’t matter if people think you’re strange! People think I’m strange and I don’t care, just be you and don’t worry about not asking the other girls out, Ginny seems good for you.”<br/>	“I don’t know…” John replied, “Ginny would have easily got another date, but I’m not sure about Luna and Raven. And you know how people treat Luna, just because she’s odd, and I really don’t want people to treat me like that.”<br/>	“Ok, you’re annoying me now. So you’re saying you won’t go out with Luna because the way people treat you, she 100% wouldn’t date you then. Anyway people aren’t gonna treat you like that. And who cares if they do? Cause Luna doesn’t care.” And she stormed off.</p>
<p>John was left alone. That wasn’t what he meant. He didn’t mean that that was the reason why he wasn’t dating Luna, he meant he didn’t want people to treat him like they currently do Luna, and they would probably do that whether he dated Luna or not. He tried ringing Ivy again, but she was still in the lecture. He didn’t blame Alivia for walking away. Ivy wouldn’t have, but she is one of the only people in the world who wouldn’t have stormed off at a comment like that. He sat down and buried his head in his hands. He seemed to be upsetting everyone today. He didn’t usually cry, but a single tear rolled down his check.</p>
<p>Raven had gone to the lake and transformed back but didn’t notice Sage. Sage looked and Raven and said,<br/>	“Hello!”<br/>	“Hi,” began Raven, “Did you see that?”<br/>	“Yeah, but it’s fine.”<br/>	“It’s just that I’m not a registered Animagus yet so, you know how it is. What are you doing?”<br/>	Sage then turned into a black wolf. Raven then turned back into her fox. They both howled and then turned back into humans.<br/>	“Sage?” Raven asked.<br/>	“Yes Raven?”<br/>	“Do you…have a date to the dance thing?” she asked quietly.<br/>	“Erm, no,” Sage blushed, “do you?”<br/>	“No…”<br/>	“Then do you want to be my date to the ball?”<br/>	“Er, yeah, ok then...” she said, “you’re…you’re the only one not to call me a blood traitor…”<br/>	“I – I am?”<br/>	“Well, apart from one boy earlier, but he was muggle born.”</p>
<p>Sage blushed and kissed Raven. Raven blushed a darker red and kissed back.</p>
<p>John thought about what to do next. He couldn’t sit there crying all day. Part of him wanted to explain to Alivia what he meant, part of him wanted to look for Ginny and part of him wanted to look for Raven.</p>
<p>The ball came. John escorted Ginny in, and then Raven found Sage waiting for her. <br/>“Wow, you look…gorgeous” Raven said to Sage.<br/>“Thanks,” said Sage, blushing, “you look gorgeous to.”<br/>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>“Ginny, would you like to dance,” John asked.<br/>“Yes.” said Ginny.</p>
<p>“Sage, do you know how to dance?” Raven asked, “Because I don’t.”<br/>“Nor do I.”</p>
<p>John spun Ginny round the room. He found that he could barely look at Ginny in the eye without going red. He fancied her so much but couldn’t bring himself to tell her.</p>
<p>	“I mean, we could just sit down and talk or something, or we could ditch this and do something else.” Raven said.<br/>	“Whatever you want to do.”<br/>	“Hmmm,” Raven pondered, and transformed into her Animagus form, quickly followed by Sage.</p>
<p>John then noticed that Raven wasn’t there anymore. He had wanted to get a dance with her…</p>
<p>Raven signalled Sage to follow her and walked towards John. Sage followed, and they retransformed behind John.<br/>	“What the…” John started.<br/>	“Raven?” Ginny said.</p>
<p>Then John remembered: Raven was an Animagus.<br/>	“John, I told you to look for a fo, oh never mind. Ginny don’t tell anyone, ok. I’m not registered.”<br/>	“Would you like to dance, Raven?” John asked.<br/>	“Well…actually, this is my date, Sage.”<br/>	“Hi, Sage.”<br/>	“Hello John.”<br/>	“Why does having a date stop you dancing with me?”<br/>	“We were gonna go to the lake, do you guys wanna come?”<br/>	“Ok.” Ginny and John said together.<br/>John felt another mix of emotions as they left the ball. Happy because he was with friends, but sad because the ball was the thing that would be most like his favourite hobby that he was going to get at Hogwarts, so he didn’t want to leave.</p>
<p>The four of them sat at the lake and Raven watched the reflection of the moon in the water. John looked across at Raven. He now felt silly and confused. He longed for Raven to kiss him, but knew she couldn’t, as they each had their own dates and, whilst he admired Raven, he still fancied her sister.</p>
<p>Sage sat next to Raven and took her hand. Raven blushed and shot floating balls of light out of her wand. Raven leant over and kissed Sage.</p>
<p>John couldn’t believe how much his loyalty wandered. He fancied Ginny so much, and, when dancing with her just half an hour ago, could barely look at her without blushing, but now he was wishing he could kiss Raven, Ginny’s sister.</p>
<p>Then, when Raven kissed Sage, he let out a sigh. If only he hadn’t asked Ginny to the ball, then he would have asked Raven when he first met her, she wouldn’t have started fancying Sage and he would be the one she was kissing now.</p>
<p>Raven yawned and put her head on Sage’s shoulder. It was all too much for John. He started to cry. He didn’t usually cry, but this was the second time this week.<br/>	“After tonight, I’m sleeping for – John?”<br/>	“Yeah?”<br/>	“What’s wrong?” Raven said, taking here head off Sage’s shoulder.<br/>	“Nothing…” John said, not very convincingly.<br/>	“Well, there is…”<br/>	“No, there isn’t,” he began, but soon gave in, “all right, but please don’t hate me when I’m done. My life has been stupid recently, my muggle friends seem to be ignoring me, I offended Alivia and haven’t had a chance to make up yet, asking Ginny to the ball meant I couldn’t ask you when you first met me, when you said you had no friends, you’ve just kissed Sage, and I fancy both you and Ginny.”</p>
