    <p>The first time he had heard of that boy was during one of the Hyuga dinners where all members had to attend. Many of them called him a filthy monster, unworthy of even being in Konoha. Neji was shocked that they would say such detestable things about a boy. It seems that he was the same age as him. But what can a four year old boy do when they were just born? Was his parents maybe murderers or criminals?</p>
<p>The scornful words from the clan members were terrible, he wondered, who exactly was this boy? He became curious, so he asked his father who exactly that boy was. His father told him to not worry about that boy. Feeling put out by his response, Neji decided to listen to whatever they were saying about that boy.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, he finally saw the boy. It was extremely coincidental that the first time he left the compound would be the first time that he would see him. The only reason he was able to see him was because of the scornful words of the villagers. They said, “Look, it’s the demon!” And thing like “That filth should not even be here, such a pity that he can’t be killed.”</p>
<p>Looking at the direction that they were pointing at, he only saw an extremely scrawny blonde boy with cerulean orbs, dejected by those hurtful words. He felt a sharp pain in his chest when he looked at him. He also felt a strange attraction towards the boy, he wanted to go to him. </p>
<p>It felt like something was pulling them together. As if feeling the pull, the blonde looked into his eyes. Neji felt a stronger pang in his chest. He clutched tightly onto the layer of clothes around his chest. Af if mirroring him, the other boy did the same.</p>
<p>‘Why does it hurt when I look at him? Why do I want to go to him? Why is he so sad? Is he not what people say about him? Why does it seem like he feels the pain that I do? I want to know, I want to know everything.’</p>
<p>Returning back to the compound a few hours later, Neji decided that he wanted to get to know the other boy. He decided that he would give the boy something to eat, since he was so thin. ‘Maybe snacks would do it, since mother said that a starving person is unable to eat a lot of food.’ He was determined, he would befriend the blonde whether he liked it or not.</p>
<p>Neji was extremely eager to see the boy again. He was extremely impatient, waiting for weeks dragging by extremely slowly, he nearly wanted to escape the compound to find him until he finally hears the words of hope that came from his father. “We are going out tomorrow. I need to get more groceries and you can pick some of them.” Neji cheered in excitement. Finally! </p>
<p>He ran off to his room, packing various snacks he collected from the house into his bag, haphazardly shoving them in, earning a strange look from his father as Neji was never this excited to leave. There is a chance that Neji was becoming bored at home. Hizashi decided that in his free time, he would start teaching Neji more about Shinobi and let him slowly learn taijutsu.</p>
<p>When the next day came, Neji was bouncing on his heels with his backpack on. It looked like he was about to run off somewhere. Hizashi grabbed his shoulder. “Wait a little longer.” Hizashi went back inside to take his keys. Neji pouted at those words. Waiting impatiently for about five minutes, his father reappeared and locked the door.</p>
<p>Hizashi held Neji’s hand while they were in the compound, worried that he would get lost. The moment he let go of Neji’s hands, he was about to run off to find the boy again. But he didn’t, as he instinctively knew he was further away from here.</p>
<p>While he was walking with his father, he felt that he was getting closer towards the other boy. He waited, and waited until they were extremely close to his location. Now, Neji just had to wait for his Father to be distracted so that he could find the blonde. When Hizashi was busy piling various food into the basket, Neji saw his chance and shot off.</p>
<p>Seeing a glimpse of the other boy for a second time, he went after him. But what Neji didn’t expect was that the boy could run so fast. It seemed like he was running away from something? Trying to catch up with him, he tripped over a rock and saw the blonde turn to a corner and speeding off. Neji sighed, dejected, rubbing off the dirt from his knee. Luckily, it didn’t bruise. He had to slowly look for him again.</p>
<p>After turning countless corners and walking through various alleys, he saw that boy again. Seeing how lonely he was, curled up in a corner looking blankly at the floor, he decided to talk to him, so that he would feel less lonely. He nervously approached him, opening his backpack and taking out a few snacks. “Are you hungry?” Neji asked, as he didn’t know how to start a conversation.</p>
<p> The blonde looked up. Seeing the snacks, his stomach involuntarily growled. Hearing a growl from the other boy’s stomach, he giggled. Giving him the snacks, Neji said, “You can have them, I have more at home. So you should eat them!” Giggling at the blonde’s stupefied face, he said his farewells before leaving. </p>
<p>Neji smiled to himself as he was walking back. ‘He doesn’t seem like a bad person. Even if he is, it doesn’t matter. Even bad people need friends!’ Seeming excited at the prospect of having a new friend, he couldn’t stop smiling, even when he saw his father with a worried face.</p>
<p>When he returned to his father, he was scolded for running off without saying anything. When asked where he went, he kept his mouth shut. He didn’t want the other blonde to get hurt because of him. But, remembering their first interaction, he smiled widely extremely happy that he was finally able to talk to him, even though it was a one sided conversation.</p>
