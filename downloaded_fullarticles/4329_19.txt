    <p>This was ridiculous. He was being totally, utterly ridiculous. Harry stuffed his feet into his trainers angrily. His alarm had failed to go off and if he didn’t get there in time. Of all the dumb ideas Harry had ever had, this was the dumbest. It was also the most inconvenient and time-consuming ideas he’d ever had. Harry paused by the mirror in the hallway, trying to calm his racing heartbeat. The world wasn’t going to stop turning if he missed getting to the bench on time. Of course not, but – but not getting to the bench by 7:03AM would mean he wouldn’t see him. Seeing him was the highlight of Harry’s day.</p><p>Harry straightened his outfit, tried and failed to tame to his hair, grabbed the first book his hand landed out and dashed out of the door.</p><p>Harry made it time, much to his relief. He pulled his grey jacket around him tighter as he stared blankly at the open book in his lap. It was 7:01AM. Soon, his crush was going to walk straight past him and Harry would eventually get up and head to work.</p><p>Harry’s heart skipped as finally, his crush walked past. Harry risked a glance over the top of book. He was walking away; a back pack slung over one shoulder, a phone pressed to his ear. Harry could hear the man making little noises of agreement with whoever was on the other end of the line and Harry’s heart melted. He loved it when he got to hear the man’s voice! Sooner than he’d like, the man was gone, swept up the crowd of people. Harry placed the book back into his satchel and slumped down into the bench. Eight months. He had been doing this for eight months and for what? A two second glimpse of handsome man? He didn’t even know the man’s name for crying out loud. Harry sighed and got up, as much as he told himself this was stupid and pointless, he knew he wouldn’t stop doing it. He shouldered his bag and began the short trek to the animal shelter he worked for.</p><p align="center">~</p><p>‘Hey brat!’ Harry looked up to see his boss standing in the door way. Red faced and grossly overweight. Vernon Dursley was not some shy wall flower. He was brute of a man with a temper to match. ‘What are you doing?’ Vernon stomped flat footed into the kitchen.</p><p>The Dursley’s owned a small café that served hot food all day. Which wouldn’t have been a problem if they had hired the right number of cooks to run the kitchen. The Dursley’s were tight with money, however and forced Harry to work flat out in the kitchen by himself.</p><p>‘I’m about finished.’ Harry grabbed a towel from the rack behind him and started drying the just washed plates. Today had been reasonably quiet, so Harry had been able to catch up on some basic cleaning, like washing up. Harry hated the Dursley’s. If they hadn’t been family, he’d have left a long time ago.</p><p>‘About time,’ Vernon snapped grumpily. ‘There’s a customer wanting to speak to you.’ Vernon smiled nastily, clearly hoping that the customer was going to shout at Harry.</p><p>‘Alright, I’ll be out in a minute.’ Vernon stomped back out, managing to break a plate that was sitting on the counter innocently. Harry closed his eyes and counted slowly to ten. <em>Patience</em>.</p><p>Harry folded the towel neatly and placed on the counter, and placed the broom next to the broken plate pieces. He’d go see the customer and then come back and clean up his uncle’s mess.</p><p align="center">~</p><p>Harry stopped mid stride, looking directly at him, was the man Harry had been waiting to see every morning. He was sitting in a corner table, sipping a latte. Harry straightened up and hurried over to the man.</p><p>‘H-Hello.’ Harry gulped. What was he doing here? How did he know where Harry worked? Was it pure coincide? The look in the man’s eyes suggested not.</p><p>‘If they can spare you for a moment, I’d like a private word with you.’ The man looked confident, as if he was used to getting exactly what he wanted.</p><p>‘Er,’ Harry bit his bottom lip. Spare him? The Dursley’s would say no just to spite him. ‘I’ll just go check with the boss.’</p><p>Vernon was not happy. Harry was his only cook and without him, they’d have to shut down the kitchens. However, he knew who was making the request and even Vernon wasn’t stupid enough to get in the way.</p><p>‘Fine,’ Vernon spat ‘You need to go on your break anyway.’ He turned to Harry ‘You have fifteen minutes, or else. Understand?’ Harry nodded quickly, trying to not look as shocked as he felt. It was already passed midday. So, they didn’t have to worry about the lunch time rush. Vernon had never let him go on break early before. Not even for Doctor appointments!</p><p>‘Erm, I’m just going to go and get my jacket.’ Harry hurried into the back and tried to breathe normally. Oh God. He’d been caught, hadn’t he? Did sitting on a bench just to look at someone count as stalking? Was he going to get told to back off? He wasn’t hurting anyone.</p><p>Harry ran into the kitchen, wanting to grab his jacket before his uncle could change his mind. He slipped on his jacket and sighed. He couldn’t leave the kitchen in the mess that it currently was. He quickly swept up the broken plate and made sure everything was turned off before he left. He may not like working for the Dursley’s, but he took pride in his work.</p><p align="center">~</p><p>‘You don’t have to look so nervous.’ Harry’s mystery man looked down at him and smiled, Harry tried to smile back, but found it felt false. They were sitting on his bench. The same bench Harry sat on everyday to watch him.</p><p>‘Look, I’m sorry, I never meant to bother you.’ Harry looked down at his fingers. Heart pounding in his chest. So, this was it. He wouldn’t be able to sit here anymore. Part of him wanted to cry, he didn’t think what he was doing was <em>that</em> bad.</p><p>‘There are only two things that bother me about this. One is that I don’t know your name, the other is that we’ve never been on a date. I’d like very much to change that.’</p><p>‘Oh.’ Harry blinked a few times. A slow smile crept across his face. ‘I’m Harry.’</p><p>‘Tom,’ Tom ran a thumb gently over Harry’s bottom lip. ‘So, about that date…’</p>
