    <p>Albus Potter was sitting on the sofa holding a book in one hand. The other was lazily stroking the fluffy blonde hair of his boyfriend, Scorpius, who was laid with his head on his lap. They were sat peacefully, existing in a bubble of calm. Something they sorely needed after a hectic year at school. It was the second week of Summer and the air was pleasantly warm, a cool breeze blowing in through an open window. Albus gazed down at Scorpius and the blonde’s eyes fluttered open behind stylish rectangular frames. Forest green met silver and Scorpius smiled in a curious manner.</p><p>“Like what you see, Potter?” he teased, smirking playfully.</p><p>“You wish, Malfoy” Albus smirked back and leant down to plant a gentle kiss against Scorpius’ pale velvet lips. Scorpius kissed back, pushing himself up with his arms and cupping Albus’ cheek with his ivory hand. Albus’ rich olive complexion contrasted the young Malfoy’s. He had snuck his hand under Scorpius’ dark grey jumper and mint green t-shirt and was resting it against the pale boy’s torso, Scorpius shivered slightly at Albus’ surprisingly cold hand. The kiss drew on, growing more passionate as the two boys slowly forgot their surroundings. That is, until an amused cough tore them hurtling back to reality.</p><p>“I’m all for PDA,” Teddy Lupin spoke from his plush armchair, eyes away from the book he was holding. “But could you try keep it PG please?” his amber eyes were alighted with amusement; his teasing grin spoke loudly of his good mood.</p><p>Scorpius rolled his eyes and lay his head back down onto Albus’ lap. The dark-haired boy sighed and returned to simply stroking Scorpius’ hair. “If we must.”</p><p>Scorpius yawned a small yawn and blinked up at Albus sweetly. “Read to me?” he asked and Albus nodded with a soft laugh. They bubble of serenity returned with ease and Albus picked back up where he left off, reading this time aloud softly to the boy resting on him. Unfortunately, the peace did not last very long.</p><p>Barrelling in through the door came a blur of a six-foot three wizard, followed closely by a streak of red almost half the size.</p><p>“James! You put that back!” Lilly yelled, startling the inhabitants of the room. She attempted to tackle her oldest brother, James, but he was able to stay upright, holding what looked like a gold necklace up high away from her. She scrambled to snatch it from him but was failing miserably.</p><p>“Get… Off… You… Brat!” James grunted as he tried to push Lily off him. The necklace swung with the movement and Albus and Scorpius saw what it was.</p><p>“James, put that down.” Albus exclaimed wildly, standing abruptly and knocking Scorpius to the floor accidentally. He eyed the familiar time turner in the older boy’s hand.</p><p>Scorpius sat up quickly from where he had landed and rubbed his head. He too stared at the time turner in James’ hand, wide eyes. He had paled, he looked almost grey.</p><p>“What on earth?” Teddy furrowed his brow before he too saw what exactly James was holding. “James!”</p><p>Teddy rushed towards the teen in an attempt to grab the time turner, but he tripped over Scorpius and stumbled directly into James and Lily. The three came crashing down and there was a sickening crunch. The five were immediately thrown back with a flash of light and a fine white sand coated each of them.</p><p>The world went black, and then, with another bright flash they found themselves falling.</p><p>Their landing was not pleasant, hitting the grimy carpeted floor with a thud.</p><p>Albus groaned as he sat up. He looked around, spotting Scorpius next to him. Ignoring his new surroundings, he instinctively rushed to his boyfriend’s side to wake him.</p><p>“Wh-who are you?” a timid voice spoke and Albus looked up to see six wands aimed at him. His eyes widened at the sight of Hermione Granger, Ron, Ginny, George, and Fred Weasley, and Harry Potter staring at him with wands drawn. He gaped. It was like he had been thrown into one of his dad’s old photos of when he was a kid.</p><p>“Please, don’t hurt me” he held his hands up in surrender. He supposed he looked pretty pathetic there on the floor, hands raised and confused and bewildered expression. Most of the teens lowered their wands but a couple stayed up. Namely Harry’s and Hermione’s.</p><p>“Who are you.” Hermione repeated, her voice stronger than before. “And who are they?” she nodded to Albus’ unconscious siblings who were strewn about the room.</p><p>“How did you get here?” Harry demanded, his voice stern and angry. Albus cowered a little, used to that tone from his father.</p><p>Al swallowed nervously.</p><p>“My name is Al.” he said slowly, cautiously. “These are my family. Please, I don’t mean any harm. My brother messed with a magical object and we ended up here. I need to see if they’re okay.”</p><p>Harry didn’t look any way appeased. Neither did Hermione.</p><p>“Like we believe that. This house is under fidelious. How did you get past the wards?” Hermione spoke through pursed lips.</p><p>“Lay off a little, guys.” Fred or George said from their spot by the fireplace.</p><p>“Can’t you see he’s just as confused as we are?” the other twin finished.</p><p>Harry simply glared at the twins and then Albus but lowered his wand slightly. “Ron, go get Sirius or someone.”</p><p>“S-sure Harry.” Ron sputtered and swiftly left the room.</p><p>“Look,” Albus started but he was cut off by a groan that escaped Scorpius’ lips. Albus looked down, startled but sighed in relief as the pale boy’s eyes opened.</p><p>“Al? what-“</p><p>Albus scooped Scorpius into a hug in a swift and sudden movement, startling the other teens in the room -who raised their wands once again before realising Albus was just hugging Scorpius- “Scorp” Albus breathed. “I was worried.”</p><p>“I… I’m fine Al. what’s going on? What happened? Last I remember James was-“ Scorpius gasped and pulled away from Albus, searching around the room wildly and noticing the teens with them. He shook his head. “No. No! not again!” he hissed, his breathing shallowed.</p><p>The teens of the past stared in confusion and worry as Albus attempted to sooth his boyfriend when the living room door burst open and in entered Ron with Sirius and what appeared to be the majority of the Order of the Phoenix.</p><p>The adults had their wands out, just like the teens had, but most faltered at the sight of Scorpius in the middle of a panic attack with Albus wrapped around him.</p><p>“Whats… going on?” Sirius broke the tense silence.</p><p>Albus stood, determination on his face. “Look, we can explain later, but first I need to calm Scorpius.”</p><p>Sirius was taken aback, partly by the concerned determination in the boy’s voice but also by his appearance. The animagus’ eyes flicked between Albus and Harry. The two looked startlingly alike, with the same straight nose, the same strong eyebrows, even the aura of power and leadership around them were the same. However Albus wasn’t as skinny as Harry, with more muscle – though he was still lean – shown off by his well-fitting clothing. He wore an olive-green cable knit jumper with its sleeves rolled up to the elbow, dark fitted jeans that were ripped at the knees, and dark – almost black – red doc martens that were tied with olive laces that matched his jumper. He looked very well put together, unlike Harry, who wore an oversized, faded blue t-shirt and baggy jeans that were held up by an old, brown leather belt.</p><p>Albus had wavy, chin length hair that, while messy, was rather stylish. Light freckles stained his dark cheeks – though they weren’t obvious – and where Harry’s eyes were crisp emerald behind the round, wire frame glasses he wore; Al’s eyes were almond instead of doe, with rich forest green irises and long, dark lashes. Harry’s skin was darker, a warm chestnut. The other boy’s skin was a colder, more olive tone. Albus also had a few inches of height on Harry and looked to be at least a couple years older.</p><p>“Very well, my boy.” Albus Dumbledore spoke gently. “Severus,” he turned his gaze onto the dark-haired bat of a professor by his side.</p><p>“Yes, headmaster?” Snape sounded surprisingly calm.</p><p>“Could you please fetch a calming draught for… Scorpius, was it?” Al nodded and Dumbledore smiled serenely. “For young Scorpius.”</p><p>Snape pursed his lips but nodded and strode out of the room.</p><p>Al smiled in thanks and knelt back down next to Scorpius, who was breathing quick, sharp breaths and clutching at his pale hair. He, Albus, gently rubbed Scorpius’ back and muttered soothingly, trying to ignore the many pairs of eyes that were on him.</p><p>“Young man,” Remus Lupin spoke up with concern. “Might you explain what is going on?”</p><p>Al looked up at the werewolf, briefly flicking his gaze to the unconscious Teddy by one end of the sofa, and back again. He sighed. “All I know is my brother,” he nodded to where James lay sprawled, “somehow got his hands on a powerful magical object. My siblings tried to retrieve it from him, but they ended up falling and breaking the device. There was a flash and now here we are.” He frowned.</p><p>The adults in the room looked sympathetic, except for the aurors.</p><p>“Professor, what if he’s lying.” Harry spoke up, voicing the universal concern.</p><p>“Have no fear, Harry.” Dumbledore directed. “We will proceed with caution and we will need to verify these claims, but for now patience is required. This young man has shown no signs of violence and is clearly worried for his friend.”</p><p>“Albus, surely-“ a gruff voice cut through the air.</p><p>“Alastor,” Dumbledore interrupted in a gentle warning tone.</p><p>“If it makes you feel any more at ease,” Al piped up, reaching into his pocket. “Here’s my wand.” He held it out, offering for it to be taken. Moody eyed it and gestured for Nymphadora Tonks, who stood off to the side, to take it. The bubble-gum-pink-haired witch pocketed the wand with a sceptical but curious look to Al.</p><p>Beside Al, Scorpius whimpered. Albus stroked his hair gently and spoke softly in his ear.</p><p>“What’s wrong with <em>him</em> anyway?” Ron blurted out.</p><p>“Ronald!” Molly gasped, scandalised. “That was rude.”</p><p>“What? It’s a valid question, mum.” Ron huffed.</p><p>“It’s called a panic attack, Ron.” Hermione said softly. She had lowered her guard when Scorpius’ attack started. “They can be triggered by any number of reasons. They can be really scary to endure.” She observed the scene before her curiously, and her voice was gentle.</p><p>“Boy, give this to him.” A no-nonsense voice spoke, startling everyone who hadn’t noticed Snape enter the room.</p><p>Al took the vial Snape handed him with a polite “Thank you” before attempting to coerce Scorpius into drinking it.</p><p>It took a little while, but Scorpius finally took the potion. It worked almost instantly, and the young Malfoy’s hands dropped from his head and he was able to take in deep, slow breaths.</p><p>“Are you okay now Scorp?” Albus asked gently.</p><p>Scorpius nodded. “I-I think so. Um… thank you… sir.” He looked up at Severus.</p><p>Snape just gave the barest hint of a sneer before turning and walking over to stand by Dumbledore.</p><p>“N-now that Scorp is feeling better, I suppose you want answers.” Al rubbed his neck anxiously.</p><p>Dumbledore nodded.</p><p>“Okay. Um, could I wake my siblings up first?” The young Potter asked somewhat meekly.</p><p>“Of course.” Dumbledore nodded and waved his wand, muttering something under his breath.</p><p> </p><p>Teddy was the first to wake up and Al rushed to him to quickly explain the situation. Teddy’s turquoise hair turned white in shock and he stared around the room before groaning when his eyes landed on Remus and Tonks. Albus helped him stand and then turned to Lily and James. The former was being helped by Scorpius, leaving James to him and Teddy.</p><p>Al looked to Teddy with a glower that was matched. James had yet to wake and Teddy nodded at Al before aiming his wand at the still unconscious boy.</p><p>“Glascio” Teddy hissed, a stream of ice-cold water shooting directly at James’ face. He shot up sputtering.</p><p>“What the hell was that for!” the nineteen-year-old yelled, wiping his eyes.</p><p>“Try messing with dangerous magic and getting us stuck here.” Albus growled.</p><p>“Really, James. What were you <em>thinking</em>?” Teddy snarled. His hair was a deep, angry red and his eyes were like flames. “Don’t you <em>remember</em> what happened in Al’s fourth year?”</p><p>“I <em>tried</em> to tell him, but he didn’t listen.” Lily huffed, glaring at James and pushing her glasses up her nose and crossing her arms.</p><p>“Hey! It wasn’t <em>my</em> fault. I was only looking at it. <em>You’re</em> the one who chased me through the house Lils.” James defended himself.</p><p>“That shouldn’t matter James. You had the time turner out in the first place. Dad had that locked in his office for a<em> reason</em>.” Teddy scolded, hair returning to its usual turquoise. “A reason you already knew of, and <em>clearly</em> decided to <em>forget</em>.”</p><p>Al was sure Scorpius would have yelled at James too were it not for the calming draught. He sighed and ran a hand through his wavy locks. Looking to the Order and the other teenagers he spoke, cutting off any retort his brother might have attempted to make. “My name is Albus Severus Potter. These are Teddy, Scorpius, James, and Lily.”</p>
