    <p>“Harry…Harry….” A window cracked open, the words floating in through the gap and straight into Harry’s ears. “…Haarrrry…” A whoosh of air burst into the room, making the curtains fly up and the windows swing open.</p><p>Harry groaned as the noise woke him up, reaching and trying to grab for his wand. “Lumos,” he quietly croaked, letting a small spark of light spill into the darkened room.</p><p>“Harry,” the voice whispered again, and it seemed to be coming from outside his house. Harry rubbed at his eyes, putting his glasses on and padding across the room to look outside. There was no one there. All that stood in the garden was a lone apple tree, which surprisingly never grew any apples. It had something to do with the soil and mud around the tree, which hadn’t been taken care of or tended to properly for a long time, according to Neville.</p><p>Harry sighed, closing the windows and locking them up before pulling the curtains shut.</p><p>“Harry,” the voice called out to him again and Harry froze momentarily. “I know you are here…I can see you….” Harry whirled around, trying to figure out and see who was there in his home, but he saw nothing. He swallowed heavily.</p><p>“Who’s there?” Harry’s voice shook as he cast a quick tempus charm. It was almost nearing an hour past midnight, and his bed seemed to be inviting him back in with the promise of a deep, satisfying sleep. Harry refused the offer as he walked away from it, opening the door to his room and stepping out of it. He was the only inhabitant of Grimmauld Place, but he still took comfort in closing the door to his room before going to sleep.</p><p>The door swung shut behind Harry, startling him and making him almost jump out of his skin. He shuddered each time his bare feet came in contact with the cold wooden floor, wishing he had put on his slippers before leaving his room.</p><p>Cold winds blew from behind him and Harry looked back, wondering where they were coming from; there were no windows in the room at the very back and even if there had been, the room was locked. One of the floorboards creaked when Harry stepped on it and suddenly, complete silence spread across the entire floor. Goosebumps erupted across Harry’s skin as he held up his wand and tightened his grip on it. He was ready to fight whoever was out there.</p><p>The house stayed silent for a few more seconds, letting Harry relax and continue his walk along the corridor, but as soon as he reached the top of the stairs, he felt someone breathing down his neck. Fingers touched the skin on his neck and trailed down his back. Harry must have turned around a bit too quickly, his foot must have slipped on the floor, that was the only logical explanation for why he went hurtling down the stairs. There were no hands that pushed him or haunting hollow eyes that glared with accusations at him, he hadn’t seen a freckled face or long ginger hair.</p><p>Harry stood up at the bottom of the stairs, limping slightly and rubbing at the bruise on his head. “You can’t hide from me, Harry, and you can’t run. I’ll always know where you are and I will always find you.”</p><p>The light from Harry’s wand suddenly went out and darkness poured back into his vision. He stumbled backwards as he tried to find a way to let his wand shine bright again. “Lumos…lumos…lu-lumos!”</p><p>Harry’s breath caught in his throat as his wand automatically lit up. “Lumos,” a familiar female voice lightly whispered in his ear and then giggled, making Harry shut his eyes tightly. It was a dream, it was just a dream. It wasn’t real, it couldn’t be. He was just having a nightmare, just imagining things that were happening inside his own head. “Of course it’s happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean it’s not real?”</p><p>A cackling laughter filled his head, forcing him to open his eyes. A sharp scream ripped from his throat as big brown eyes filled his vision, along with hair that was now blood-red instead of ginger and razor sharp teeth. The eyes had a cruel glint to them that made Harry scream even louder.</p><p>He woke up in his bed a second later, covered in sweat, his voice hoarse from screaming. Harry sighed in relief; it had just been a nightmare, it hadn’t been real. It was all inside his head.</p><p>Harry had been so relieved that he hadn’t noticed the pain in his leg and the way he flinched because of the bruise on his head when he let it hit the pillow. He had just fallen asleep because what was inside his head couldn’t be real, could it?</p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Harry…Harry….” Hands shaking him, sun directly shining into his eyes and a weird buzzing noise that he recognised as his alarm. “Haarrrry!” A shrill, high-pitched voice had Harry sitting up with his wand in hand and eyelids half opened.</p><p>“Hermione,” Harry murmured sleepily and let the wand slip from his grasp, tense shoulders relaxing slowly. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “What do you think? You’ve been late to all of your Auror shifts ever since you started working for the Ministry of Magic. I honestly don’t even know how you managed to reach them on time during your training.” Hermione’s face softened along with her gaze as Harry covered up a great, big yawn right in front of her. “I keep telling you that you shouldn’t live here all alone, Harry. It isn’t healthy for you, especially after the war and everything that we’ve been through. You know that our doors are always open for you.”</p><p>“I know that, and I appreciate your help and concern, but I’m fine. I swear it. It isn’t like I’m the only one suffering after the war, we all are, and I think I can handle it. If there is ever a time when I can’t, I’ll let you know.” Harry said, his sincerity showing through his tone.</p><p>Hermione sighed at that. “You promise you’ll let me know?” she asked.</p><p>“I will,” Harry nodded his head. He slid off of his bed, wincing a little as his legs hit the floor. As he walked towards his closet with a limp, Hermione almost began to question him, but then she remembered that Harry was an Auror, and one of the most capable ones at that. She was pretty sure he got bruises on the daily, so a slight limp was nothing to worry about.</p><p>With that thought, she got up. “Alright then, I’ll tell Ron that you’re up and about, and I’ll see you at work.”</p><p>Harry turned to acknowledge her statement. “Yeah, I’ll see you there,” he replied distractedly. Hermione didn’t ask him about that or about the way he was rubbing the back of his head with his face pinched in pain. She just wordlessly walked away.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Harry…Harry….” He was drooling over his case files, eyes almost fully shut whilst his mouth lay fully open, and he was snoring. “Haarrrry, mate!” Ron exclaimed, pushing at him and making Harry snort.</p><p>Harry wiped the drool off of the side of his mouth and chin as he straightened up. His eyes widened just a second later, breath caught in his throat. “R-Ron,” he managed to choke out.</p><p>Ron blinked at Harry, his demeanor changing as he turned from being annoyed and slightly pissed off to being concerned about his best friend’s wellbeing. “What is it, Harry?”</p><p>“Behind you,” Harry stage-whispered shakily. Ron felt goosebumps erupting all over his skin as he slowly turned around, but there was nothing there.</p><p>“Mate—” Ron started to say but Harry didn’t hear him, he couldn’t hear him. All he could hear was a static sound ringing in his ears as his attention stayed fixed on Voldemort, who was standing right behind Ron. How could Ron not see him?</p><p>Harry’s lips parted, letting out a breath as black goo started sliding down Voldemort’s ears and nose, his lips opening up in a predatory smirk to reveal rotting golden-brown teeth. Harry pointed his wand straight at him.</p><p>“Avada Ke—”</p><p>“Harry!” Ron pulled the wand from his grasp, gaping at his best friend of years. “Mate,” he breathed, putting the wand down on his desk.</p><p>Harry’s eyes were wild, his hands all over the place as he tried to explain what he had seen, tried to convince Ron that it had been real. But it hadn’t been, Ron tried to tell him, it had all been inside his head.</p><p>Harry swallowed heavily as a small voice came alive in the back of his mind, the same voice that had accompanied that long, ginger hair, that freckled face, and those beautiful brown eyes. ‘Of course it’s happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean it’s not real?’</p>
