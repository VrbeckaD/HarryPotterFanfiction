    <p>Raven has always been a special girl. She has known since the age of five, when she made the dead flower in her room in the orphanage she grew up in live again. She didn't dare to tell the supervisors, since they had already beaten her just for learning how to write on her own. At the age of four.</p>
<p>Raven never knew her parents, for nobody told her anything. But she always was afraid to ask, since the supervisors at the orphanage had never spoken a friendly word to 'their' children, for as long as Raven could remember, which is about ten years of her thirteen year old ife.</p>
<p>Thirteen is always a difficult age, as we all know. The time when your emotions can go completely crazy, and make you change. Raven, for example, discovered a sudden liking for the colour black around tht age, and started like to hide her emotions deep inside, since she has experienced that they only cause trouble with that wierd gift of hers.</p>
<p>But also she begins to wonder about her parents again, which she had given up on long ago.</p>
<p>But then, where Raven starts to bear emotions and thoughts way bigger and stronger than she has known, it has become way more difficult for her to keep them ocked up deep inside.</p>
<p>~*~</p>
<p>"I want to know about my parents."</p>
<p>It was a simple request that Raven formulated, which shouldn't have angered anyone. But the answer did not fit it.</p>
<p>"You, my child,", Ms. Umney started, still with a friendly smile on her face, "will be on kitchen duty. You shall not bother us with unneccesary things like that again!" By the time Ms. Umney hat finished, her face was so red of anger, Raven feared she might explode.</p>
<p>Trying to keep her fury in, Raven answered, as she has gotten used to: "Of course, Miss Umney."</p>
<p>~*~</p>
<p>As time passed, the spark of fury and longing curiousness had created a fire inside Raven that could barely be held under control. She knew she wasn't allowed to ask, but her parents were her only hope of finding out more about her gift. She didn't expect love from them, for they had dropped her off at this horrible place, but she wanted answers.</p>
<p>At the day one month after her thirteenth birthday, which was the day she first sked about her parentage, Raven couldn't bare the pressure anymore.</p>
<p>A thirteen year old girl with shoulder-long, rather thin jet-black hair, of the size of about 5.7 feet stomped into a meeting of the supervisors to talk to the headmistress.</p>
<p>"I demand to get information about my parents!!"</p>
<p>A statement way unfrendlier than the first one, with a greater impact.</p>
<p>"Information that we cannot provide!!!" If Raven had yelled before, a new word needs to be found to express the way Mrs. Abrams voiced that sentence. But that is only something to stoke the fire inside Raven more.</p>
<p>With a sudden calmness seeming extremly like the peace before the storm, the girl named Raven countered.</p>
<p>"I know you're lying, now TELL ME!!!!!!"</p>
<p>With those words an unseen force errupted throughout the room, throwing everyone and everything away from the blackhaired.</p>
<p>She just stood there, one the on hand in shock, on the other in astonishment of what she just had done. But before she could react further, the broken, but still cold voice of Mrs. Abrams yelled:<br/>
"Out. Now! Leave this house, freak, and don't you dare coming back!"</p>
<p>~*~</p>
<p>So Raven packed her things, tears steaming down her face in shock and fear, of what she had done and what lied head on the streets she had to go now. While Raven heard the sirens of the police, firefighters and ambulances approaching, she walked away from the only building she had ever known as home.</p>
<p>~*~</p>
<p>After the endangered and hurt people had been rescued out of the Abrams Orphanage London, a grey cat made its way through the ruins. As soon as it was obviously out of sight for the muggles, it changed its appearance to an old woman in strange looking green robes, examining the debris.</p>
<p>"Well well, this does quite appear like a young wizard out of control... but obviously they won't be here anymore. But at least we now know another one is somewhere in London..."</p>
<p>The old lady sighed and took one last look around, before disappearing in a vortex of the colours she was wearing.</p>
