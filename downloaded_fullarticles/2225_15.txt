    <p>Hello, everyone! This has been one of my favorite stories to write, and I really hope you all like it! Here are some things to make note of before starting;</p>
<p>1. All rights go to JK Rowling. I only own the storyline and some characters.</p>
<p>2. The story takes place around 2004, when Ginny was pregnant with James.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you for reading my story! I don't know how you found it, but I'm glad you did!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you all again.</p>
<p>Love, Grace</p>
