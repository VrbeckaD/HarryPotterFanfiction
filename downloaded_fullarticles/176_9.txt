  <span class="s1">Finally, Hogwarts! Draco breathed in the cold air of the night as the boats drifted towards Hogwarts. 1 September 1991, Draco’s first day at Hogwarts, school of Witchcraft and Wizardry!</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>His father had told him all about it, prepared him for everything. So, it didn’t surprise him at all as the ghosts came floating in, nor as the Sorting Hat began to sing. He thought it quite nice most didn’t; he felt superior to them.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>That evening, Draco was about to fall asleep after a long day as a strange silvery bird appeared next to his bed. He sat up in shock, not having seen it coming in. It seemed to be a Phoenix.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“Come to my office tonight,” the Phoenix said in a voice Draco recognized as Albus Dumbledore’s, his Headmaster. The Phoenix vanished.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Draco sleepily got dressed and made his way out of his dormitory into the common room. He was glad to see it deserted. Quietly, not to wake anyone, he crossed the room and left. He walked for a good five minutes until he remembered he had no idea where his Headmaster’s office was. Just as he wanted to turn around and go back to the Slytherin common room, he heard a voice coming from his right.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“Ah, a student out of bed. I see...” Filch, the caretaker, said, “A new face... A first year Slytherin? Let’s see what Professor Snape says of this...”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Thinking this was his only change, Draco asked, desperately trying to avoid his Head of House knowing about this: “Can’t you bring me to the Headmaster instead?”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Filch laughed. “Not afraid of a good punishment. I see! Good then, follow me, boy!”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Filch seemed quite happy the whole way towards his Headmaster’s office. Draco guessed he must think he would get badly punished, Draco hoped not. While walking, he tried his best to recognize the way they were going.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>They stopped at a stone statue of a gargoyle at the dead-end of a corridor. Filch gave the gargoyle the password and Draco followed him up a staircase, to come to a halt in front of a door. The caretaker knocked and an old voice sounded from behind it, the same in which the Phoenix had spoken.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“Enter.”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>They entered and Filch said enthusiastically, “There was a student out of bed, sir! This boy here.” He pushed Draco forward.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“Thank you, Argus, but I asked him to come here. I’m glad you brought him, you can leave now,” Dumbledore said calmly, smiling.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Draco sighed internally, he was not getting punished. Filch had kind of the opposite reaction, though, he left the room angry, muttering under his breath something about students being out of bed.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Dumbledore smiled down at Draco, who shifted awkwardly.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“You wanted to see me, sir?” he started nervously.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“Yes, indeed, Draco. Please sit down.” He gestured to the chair before his desk, as he himself sat down behind it. “So, Draco, do you have any idea why I asked you here tonight?”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Draco shook his head.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“I see... Either way, you’ll find out soon. Do you see this book here, Draco?” He pointed to a book with a very dark cover. He couldn’t read the title, but there was something written on it in golden ink. He nodded. “What colour is it?”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>At first, Draco thought he was joking. But looking up into those blue eyes, he knew he wasn’t.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“Black and dark red, sir, with a golden title.”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Dumbledore looked very pleased with the answer.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“Is that so? That’s nice! Now, Draco, I didn’t ask you here to test if you were colorblind, if that’s what you were thinking,” he said, “I actually want to ask you for a favour.”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>He took the book and laid it in front of Draco. Draco looked down at it and sneered. The title read: <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</em>. “What is this favour, sir?” Draco wondered irritably after reading the title, looking back up at his Headmaster.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Dumbledore smiled. “I want you to study this book,” he said calmly, as if it wasn’t a big deal, “and note every important bit of information. Do you think you can do that, Draco?”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Draco frowned. “Can’t you do that, sir? I mean, I might not be the right person to write things down about <em>Potter</em>.” He sneered again at the mention of the name.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“Already got a past, I see. That makes it even better! And believe me Draco when I say I’ve already got a lot of things to do as a Headmaster.”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“But... Why me? I don’t understand, sir...” He looked down at the book again, thinking, trying his best to understand.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“You won’t,” Dumbledore said calmly, Draco looked back up. “Not yet, at least. But you’re the best person for this job. Trust me.”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>He gave Draco a reassuring smile. Draco sighed. “Okay then, I’ll try...”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“Great!” Dumbledore beamed. “Here, take these for your notes.”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Draco looked down at the four items Dumbledore had just handed him. One of them seemed to be a book; except without words, and only blank lines. The second thing was long and pointy, he took it and rolled it between his thumb and index; it seemed to be made of wood. The third was a strange rectangular object, it felt rubbery under his touch. The last was again rectangular, only with a round hole in one side, the size of the long, quill -like thing, in which was put a small, sharp blade. “What are these, sir?” he asked his Headmaster.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“Those are a notebook, a pencil, an eraser and a sharpener,” he explained, pointing from one thing to another. “Muggles use the pencil to take erasable notes in a notebook.”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“Do I have to write with this, in that?” Draco wondered grudgingly, pointing from the pencil in his hand to the notebook.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“If you don’t mind.”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“All right, then. Can I go now?”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“One more thing, Draco, can you open the book and see where it stops?” Dumbledore asked.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Draco nodded and opened the book. He skipped through it until the sentences suddenly stopped and the pages turned out white and empty. “Page 141, sir, Chapter 8.”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“Do you think that is the end of the chapter?”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Draco shook his head. “Only the start, the second page of it.”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Dumbledore nodded. “Then I would like it if you’d manage to get to the end of chapter 7 before your first Potions lesson. When is that?”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“I don’t know, sir, I don’t have my timetable yet.”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“That’s right, my apologies. Then, can you come back here tomorrow, at 10 o’clock?” Dumbledore asked. Draco nodded. “All right, then! You may leave. And don’t forget to study the book. Goodnight Draco.”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“‘Night, sir.” Draco stood up and walked to the door.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>“Oh, and the password is ‘Chocolate Frog’!” Dumbledore called after him before he closed the door.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Draco walked soundlessly through the corridors of the castle, tracking back the way he went. His mind was racing wildly, and thoughts like ‘Why am I the best for <em>this</em>?’ and ‘Is he just playing with me?’ kept returning, over and over again. Finally, he stood in front of the wall that held the secret entrance to the Slytherin dormitory. He whispered the password, and the hidden door in the wall opened, allowing him to enter.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>He walked to his dormitory and laid down on his bed; the book held close to his chest while the other things laid dumped on his bedside table. He took the book off his chest and looked at it; it was too dark to read it so he put it away. He sighed and rolled over, and, too tired to get changed, fell asleep in his robes.</span>
