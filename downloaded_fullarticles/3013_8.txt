          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Hey, Heir Malfoy!”</p><p>“What, … <em>Lord</em> Potter?”</p><p>“Could I have a word with you? In private?”</p><p>It was late evening, crowds of people were leaving The Great Hall
after the dinner, and Draco Malfoy was leaving with his goons,
Crabbe and Goyle. He turned with a sneer to Harry Potter who run
towards him.</p><p>“What do you need, Mr. Potter? I have something more interesting
to do than chatting with small kittens.”</p><p>Harry hold his anger at bay for the moment. He was actually glad
Draco was antagonistic towards him at the moment, nobody will
suspect anything.</p><p>“I won’t bother you for long, Mr. Malfoy.”</p><p>Draco turned around, looked thoughtfully at longing Pansy
Parkinson and then resolutely turned towards Harry. In the end it
was possible Harry wanted to have political talk, and that could
be important.</p><p>“OK, Mr. Potter, but just a minute.”</p><p>Then he stepped out of the group and turned with Harry towards an
empty corner of the Entrance Hall.</p><p>“Mr. Malfoy I wanted to ask you about one thing I really do not
understand.”</p><p>“Oh, so you finally admit that you are stupid and need my help,
Mr. Potter?”</p><p>“Well, not exactly. It is just that. … OK, I don’t ask you to
confirm or deny anything what I saw in that graveyard in the
Little Hangleton … no, don’t say anything … just humour me for
the sake of argument … let’s say theoretically, in case Voldemort
actually returned, and in case just theoretically your father was
helping him to get back, why the hell he would do that?”</p><p>Draco looked at him in confusion. Harry just continued.</p><p>“Mr. Malfoy, I understand we are not exactly eye to eye on
politics, on your opinion about wizards and witches who are like
my sister, on werewolves and many other things, but I am not
talking about our opinions. As much it pains me to admit it,
I know that you are not stupid, and I am talking about Armand
Malfoy, and about your family staying somewhere close to the top
of the wizarding Britain for more than nine centuries. I thought
you are in the game for a long run and that you are smarter than
to fall for the person like Voldemort.”</p><p>Draco was confused, he wanted to blow up some obscenity to Harry,
to tell him that their family politics is none of his business,
but he was also curious what he has to say, because he felt with
deep pain somewhere around his stomach, that this idiot could
have actually something to say. So, he just encouraged him
instead.</p><p>“Go on, Mr. Potter.”</p><p>“Have you ever heard about Muggle leaders like Napoleon or Hitler?”</p><p>“Of course, I did, I am not stupid, you know!”</p><p>“I am sorry, I really didn’t want to imply anything like that,
Mr. Malfoy, but I am really not certain what a good pureblood guy
knows about Muggle history.”</p><p>Draco frowned.</p><p>“Well, I don’t know that much to be honest. Just that they were
alive and that Hitler was one of the nastiest persons walking on
the Earth.”</p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>“So, if you know at least about them, I would encourage you to go
and read something more. It may give you some insights how these
people like Voldemort work?”</p><p>“You compare The Dark Lord with some ordinary muggles?!”</p><p>“Well, muggles or not muggles, they were really not exactly
ordinary. Yes, they were absolutely awful and disdainful, and
they fully deserved all they got in the end, but they were in
some aspects shockingly similar to each other, and in my opinion
to Voldemort as well.</p><p>For example, all of them had no sense when to stop, and so they
went on and on so long until they hit somebody who finally
destroyed them. Which leads us back to the long game of the
Malfoy family. Imagine Voldemort succeeds, kills me, destroys any
of his opponents and completely dominates magical Britain. How
long do you think his reign will go on?”</p><p>Draco looked at him confused. What the hell he means by question
like this? And how can he talk about his own death so calmly and
matter-of-factly? He tried some feeble answer, but he was
immediately certain that his uncertainty was obvious.</p><p>“I don’t know, for a long time, until he dies in his old age? And
even that seems somehow complicated, because apparently even the
Killing Curse hitting him by a rebound was not enough to get him
out.”</p><p>Harry rather ignored the second sentence, but he thought the
first one could actually lead him to what he wanted to say.</p><p>“I think you should really study a bit more history of those two
dictators. Napoleon was actually a really very capable general
and strategist, and yet he remained in power for only sixteen
years (or perhaps just eleven), and Hitler only twelve. If both
of them just stay put after they conquered large chunk of Europe,
they could probably stay around for much longer time. However,
both of them tried to conquer more they could chew, particularly
both of them tried to attack Russia, and both of them failed and
they were destroyed. I would expect Voldemort following the same
path, that is, he will overextend himself, and I wouldn’t expect
him to stay even for five years.</p><p>I don’t know what Voldemort will try which will destroy him, but
I am sure he has no common sense to stop and limit himself.
Perhaps, he will just attack some other nations and he will be
defeated by united forces of ICW. And even if he defeats them,
I have heard he is now re-targeting himself from pureblood to
general magical supremacy. If he tries to attack Muggle Great
Britain, he has no idea what will hit him.</p><p>We were taught that Killing Curse cannot be stopped by any
magical defence. What about armour equivalent of 30 inches of the
best quality steel? I don’t think he has any chance to send
a curse through something like that. That’s muggle fighting
machine called tank. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" rel="nofollow">1</a> With this crazy thick armour, it can
drive almost as fast as the Hogwarts Express.</p><p>Do you remember how the late Quirrellmort showed us a muggle gun?
This tank has one secondary gun which can throw five hundred
rounds in a minute, each of them flying faster than you can even
hear them coming. Which Shielding Charm will sustain such attack,
what do you think? I would say none, do you agree?</p><p>Before you could even think about defence curse, a whole army
would be cut like grass. And that’s the smaller gun, the main one
is designed to fight monsters like itself. One shrapnel from that
can kill a whole crowd of men.</p><p>Even if Voldemort tries weather charms or something like that,
this monster weights sixty tons, so it can happily go through the
middle of hurricane and people inside of it won’t even notice.
And only the Muggle British army has hundreds of monsters similar
to that. And that’s just conventional tank, we are not talking
about nuclear arms, missiles, or fighter planes, against which
there is no magical defence whatsoever.</p><p>Voldemort has some knowledge of the Muggle technology, he was
living in London during the Battle of Britain, but I am not sure
how much he actually knows. He saw Luftwaffe bombing London, but
for example I wonder whether he ever saw tank, I don’t think he
ever saw attack aircraft in close air support of the land armies
or whether he ever heard about missiles. Moreover, I am really
not sure he can really appreciate how far the current Muggle
technology advanced and whether he can stop himself not to
overexert himself and try anyway.</p><p>Draco, whether you believe me or not, I saw Voldemort; the guy is
completely insane, he has absolutely no chance to keep his power
for longer time, and if the Malfoy family wants to live in the
time range of where it has been living so far, you should be very
careful what you do, and most likely I would keep as much
distance as possible from him.”</p><p>Draco Malfoy was listening very carefully. He was obviously a bit
shaken by what Harry told him.</p><p>“Why? Why do tell this to me? … Do you want to seed doubts and
fear? Do you want to scare me?”</p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>“Well, of course, I would prefer if Voldemort had no access to
the huge financial resources of your family, so it is for my
benefit as well, but I think you should listen to me even
considering just your own most egoistical self-interest. Whatever
differences in opinion we have about muggle-borns, werewolves,
and other issues, I am persuaded that in this case our interests
are actually a way closer than you think they are.</p><p>Despite what many think about me, I am not actually after the
destruction of the Magical Britain, and although I am a liberal
and I see need for many changes, I don’t think destruction of
major wizarding families like Malfoys would help anything. Nobody
knows what future holds for us, and I surely can be wrong, but
I truly believe what I say, after all I bet my life on it. And if
I am right, fate of your father is probably not salvageable and
thus you may be one of the most important men in the history of
the Malfoy family, one on which lies whole future of your family
and perhaps even the one of the Magical Britain. I thought you
should have time to think about it and prepare.</p><p>Have a nice day, Mr. Malfoy.”</p><p>With that Harry turned around and left Draco Malfoy to his
unhappy thoughts.</p><dl class="footnote brackets">

<p>Numbers here are for Challenger 2, the main battle tank
for the British army. The first tanks entered the service
between 1994 and 1998, so it may be slightly anachronistic,
but the exact numbers are not that important here.</p>
