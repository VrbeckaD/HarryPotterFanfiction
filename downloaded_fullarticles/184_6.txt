    <p>Prologue</p>
<p>'We can't do this Severus. I'm your student. We are supposed to be spying on the Dark Lord. It's too dangerous for us to be together.' She said looking out the window to the grounds below. She didn’t dare sniffle or show him her face. She didn’t dare look at him for she knew if she did, she would have done anything he asked including ignoring her duties both as head girl and as the Dark Lord’s mistress.</p>
<p>He caressed her cheek and she lifted her eyes to his. She felt tears well as she did her very best to memorize every line, plane and feature of his face.</p>
<p>She gasped aloud when he kissed her passionately. Her fingers carded his soft black hair and she moaned as he pulled her closer, his hands resting at her waist. 'For the smartest witch of your age, you can't see what's staring you right in the bloody face. I love you, Hermione. I always have. I always will.' He said softly as he kissed her forehead and caressed his thumb over her cheek..</p>
<p>She let out a sob and buried her head into his chest as she had done so many times since he'd found out that she'd become one of Voldemort's mistresses. He moved his arms to wrap them around her shoulders and held her with a tenderness that she, months prior, would have thought the man incapable.</p>
<p>'I couldn’t bear it if he kills you Severus. I love you too much. Please don't ask me to watch him kill you and pretend to be indifferent when it’ll gut me inside. Please, for me.' She sobbed aloud now. She tried to keep the images of him dead from flying across her mind’s eye, with great difficulty.  </p>
<p>She bit back a groan as a sharp pain shot down her spine. 'He's calling for me. Bella must not have satisfied him.' She whispered quietly, almost cursing the woman who was not just her rival. She was a confidante, possibly even a friend. 'Don't.' He said as he reached for her hand. ‘I must. He won’t give second chances and he won’t hesitate to kill Draco or myself if I don’t answer the call.’ She said as she slid her hand from his.</p>
<p>She kissed him once more before lifiting the black velvet cape with the green silk lining that he'd had given her, what felt like a lifetime ago, from the peg by the door and threw it over her shoulders. She forced a tiny smile as she looked upon his face one last time. This man, whom many had dubbed the overgrown bat of Slytherin house, had just admitted he loved her and now she was going to sleep with another man. Oh, what a fickle witch fate was.</p>
<p>'Please. Be careful,' he said as she left the room. She turned back, tears streaming from her eyes. 'I always am,' she said as she closed the door behind her and headed for the gates of Hogwarts, her brain screaming at her to go back with every step she took towards the Dark Lord.</p>
