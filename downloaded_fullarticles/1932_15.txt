    <p>The first time I saw him, he was hopping out of a car on our front drive, striding out with self-assurance, attuned to his own body in that athlete’s way of his, confidence in the precision of every footfall.</p>
<p>He was so unlike me.</p>
<p>In those days, the sun-soaked languor of teenage summer, my gait was foreign to me. My lanky, awkward limbs were strangers over whom I seemed to possess no dominion. They betrayed me at every turn. I fumbled and jittered my way through movement, something more akin to adolescent seizure than his balletic grace. While I could only mimic composure, he embodied it. While I could only conjecture about who I was, he seemed to point at his own identity with no hesitance.</p>
<p>We don’t know where we belong when we’re young. Mental anguish is made manifest in our unfinished hips, our pock-marked skin, and our borrowed, muddled opinions we utter like questions, gauging our own sincerity from the reactions of others, always looking for someone to save us from our floundering and tell us who we are.</p>
<p>I was knobby-kneed and diminutive, my skin stretched too tight across my bones. It didn’t fit. I wanted to scratch it away to find something else underneath. Something strong and fully formed and masculine. Something that didn’t need anyone’s help to define it. Something like Harry Potter.</p>

<p>
  <em>Somewhere in Northern Italy, Summer 2003</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>It was a warm, luscious day. Our family had been summering on the Italian villa ever since my father inherited it. It was the one bright spot my grandfather had brought to his life. The property was luxurious, a sprawling paradise that contained acres of apricot and peach orchards. The house was a 16th century beauty, a sturdy stone portico leading into a spacious entryway with a mosaic floor, the black double doors frequently left open to usher in the breeze.</p>
<p>My parents discouraged the use of magic to correct life’s marginal inconveniences, citing it as a weakness for our kind. They contended that I would be better off learning to solve these little problems without resorting to spellwork. I, of course, rejected these character building exercises with theatrical sighs as I dabbed my forehead with a washcloth full of ice cubes, my teenage insolence rearing its head in the adversity of the damp heat.</p>
<p>“Fine, no temperature controlling spells. What about air conditioning?! Muggles use air conditioning!” I shouted as my father waltzed through the living room, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, seemingly unbothered by the humidity. He was always the picture of grace and refinement, not a wrinkle to be found in his linen shirt and not a single hair out of place.</p>
<p>“Installing air conditioning is a superfluous and inappropriate endeavor. This is a 16th century Italian villa, Draco. Not a penthouse in Manhattan,” he replied coolly, a hint of a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth nonetheless. My bare feet dangled over the edge of the couch, the back of my hand pressed to my forehead like a Southern belle about to faint before a full audience. “Perhaps you should get out of the house. Go for a swim. Cool off in the water.”</p>
<p>“The ancient Egyptians invented air conditioning. I’m fairly certain it can be applied to 16th century buildings, Father,” I groaned, sitting up and rubbing the washcloth on the back of my neck.</p>
<p>“The trouble with you is that you know far too much about everything, my clever boy.” He kissed my perspiring forehead and headed off to his study.</p>
<p>I gazed forlornly at the frescoed ceiling, the fat cherubs flying above the heads of a Renaissance-era couple in celebration of the birth of their child. My eyes traced every crack in the plaster, every chip in the pastel blues and pinks as I had so many times before. If I got up too soon, I would be conceding defeat. Parental suggestions were not things to accept immediately. Holding out for a few agonizing minutes before acquiescing was the only way to keep your dignity intact.</p>
<p>With a grunt, I meandered outside, inhaling the thick scent of lavender, sumptuous fruit and the earthy aroma of Anchise, the elderly Silician groundskeeper, tilling the soil. I had some time to kill before the dreaded hour of summer disruption would be upon us. I set off in search of Pansy.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pansy and I were in my room when he arrived, both of us still indolent from the heat, the curative effects of our swim long since faded. It’s funny how the pace of summer marches on, this charmingly infectious leisure that seems to never end until suddenly it does. I sometimes miss the way it felt at that age, rife with possibilities.</p>
<p>The crunch of gravel under tires perked our ears, and we exchanged lazy smiles. Pansy jumped up, her black bob swinging behind her as she rushed to the windowsill, legs long and girlish in her black shorts. I didn’t know how she withstood the season in that perpetually dark wardrobe of hers. It was a sponge for sunlight. I tended to spend the summer in the lightest colors I could find, shirtless whenever possible, my pale skin constantly under sunblock protection. I didn’t tan; I burned, my pallor turning to boiled-lobster red if I wasn’t vigilant.</p>
<p>We looked down, and there he was, a wind-swept mop of dark hair, sunglasses shielding his eyes, that billowy blue Oxford button-down covering his broad shoulders, the one that would come to mean the world to me, its brushed cotton slipping through my ardent fingers like the most precious item I’d ever held.</p>
<p>“L’usurpateur,*” I said, cocking an eyebrow at Pansy.</p>
<p>Father greeted him jovially, as he did all his summer students, clapping him on the back and drawing him in for a hug. However, he wasn’t just any student. I knew that Father had known his parents back in England. They were legendary, their feats of bravery in the wizarding war reaching the ears of all our kind, but that world felt abstract to me. It wasn’t a place I’d grown up in. For us, it was a place to visit, not a place to live.</p>
<p>“Welcome, Harry! Forgive me for being an old man, but you were small enough to fit on my arm the last I saw you. Look at you now!” My father took a step back to survey him properly, holding him by the shoulders. “Taller than me!”</p>
<p>“I’m very useful for getting the sugar from the top shelf. Not useful for much else though, I’m afraid.” He laughed and pulled his bag from the back seat.</p>
<p>“Il semble confiant,**” I said to Pansy, sarcasm edging into the comment. She nodded with an impish smile.</p>
<p>Thus began the annual obligation, making space for a stranger in our little corner of paradise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Enchanté.” Pansy kissed Harry’s cheeks on the landing of the marble staircase, grinning wickedly over his shoulder. I rolled my eyes at her, sullen and already feeling the tedium of this unwelcome invasion. I silently led him up the stairs.</p>
<p>“My room is now your room. I’ll be next door.” I shot him a pointed glance as I gathered a pile of my things from the bed and tossed them into the adjoining room. He paid me no mind, flopping onto the bed in an undignified heap as soon as I cleared it off.</p>
<p>
  <em>Oaf.</em>
</p>
<p>“We have to share the bathroom. It’s my only way out.” I tried to imbue it with sharpness, establish dominance and all that. A chihuahua barking at a Great Dane.</p>
<p>
  <em>This is my home. You should be grateful I’m allowing this.</em>
</p>
<p>I shut the bathroom door and turned around to find him inelegantly snoring. I huffed, arms crossed as though waiting for him to apologize. He did nothing of the sort, sunglasses falling down the bridge of his nose, one end-piece trapped between the bed and his cheek.</p>
<p>He was going to wake up with a long, red imprint across his face.</p>
<p>I sighed heavily (dramatic exhalations were my specialty in those days… some would argue that hasn’t altogether changed) and shut the door behind me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I heard Mafalda, our housekeeper, ringing the big brass bell downstairs, the sound echoing through the acoustics of the old house, bouncing against the rungs of the staircase and up into my room. I abandoned my sheet music, the dim light of my desk lamp no match for the darkening night. My mother and Mafalda were always scolding me for it, ranting about eyesight as they turned on an excessive number of overhead lights in whatever room I was hunched over, composing, writing, or reading, intent on my goals without a care for such things.</p>
<p>Strange to be so singularly obsessive at that age, isn’t it? In some ways, the world is never as open to you as it is then, the parties never-ending, the new companions rotating around you like a pageant parade of choices, just point and take. Yet I never wanted any of it. I spent much of my time locked in rooms, the balmy wind blowing in hints of apricot and freshly shorn grass as I poured my endless thoughts into journals and piano concertos.</p>
<p>I begrudgingly stood, my chair scraping across the hardwood, and knocked on his (my) door.</p>
<p>“We’re being called for dinner.”</p>
<p>Nothing. The faint squeak of bed springs groaning under shifting weight, but no response. I opened the creaking mahogany door and tiptoed into the dark room, muttering curses under my breath. This was absurd. This was a violation of my comfort. This was <em>my</em> room, and here I was entering like a common criminal, crouched and hesitant, as though I were the one with anything to apologize for.</p>
<p>He continued to sleep undisturbed. I picked up a book from the shelf, and, fixing him with a withering stare I hoped to channel into his dreams, dropped it on the floor with a clatter.</p>
<p>“Oh…” he murmured, turning over at last, his disheveled hair having grown even worse from the lengthy nap, pieces sticking in all directions as he clutched the pillow and yawned, his eyes shuttering open and closed.</p>
<p>“We’re being called for dinner,” I repeated. Clipped. Unnegotiable.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m probably gonna pass,” he responded, breezing past my tone with maddening nonchalance, as though I were no more threatening than a newborn kitten. “Will you make an excuse for me to your mum, though? Thanks.”</p>
<p>I glared in the dusky tint of the room as he settled comfortably against my pillow, his arms tucking underneath him as a serene half smile formed on his face. I turned to walk away, fighting the urge to insist he drag his lazy arse out of bed and greet my mother’s table with a genial expression and a full appetite. One did not refuse to join Narcissa Malfoy for dinner. She took great care and great pride in planning spreads for guests. She might have left the pretentious world she was raised in behind, but that didn’t mean her etiquette and exquisite taste had left too. Did he really think it was good manners to outright — </p>
<p>“So, this used to be your room, yeah?”</p>
<p>Was he really and truly serious?</p>
<p>I nodded with a noncommittal huff.</p>
<p>“Thanks. Later.” He rolled over, and resumed sleeping, soft snores filling the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You <em>really</em> don’t care? It’s unforgivably rude. We’re hosting him for six weeks!”</p>
<p>“I’m certain he’s quite tired from the journey. Let him sleep. It’s no matter.” My mother shrugged and poured herself a glass of wine. I was certain I’d never before seen her casually shrug.</p>
<p>“But — he’s — ” I helplessly started, unable to pinpoint just <em>what</em> he was. Infuriatingly lackadaisical. Too bloody <em>cool</em> for his own good. Breezy and effortless while I was sitting here, posture coiled, voice faintly hysterical.</p>
<p>“Why are you so fussy this evening, darling?” My mother frowned as she took a bite of grilled branzino.</p>
<p>“I’m not fussy! Children are fussy. I’m eighteen years old,” I protested, glumly picking at my plate.</p>
<p>My parents exchanged patronizing smiles over my head, and I scowled in a manner I hoped was fierce.</p>
<p>“Stop that!”</p>
<p>“Stop what, Draco? What is all this about?” my father asked, resting a reassuring hand on my arm. “I’m sure he’ll join us tomorrow. Eat your dinner.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Good morning, Professor!” Harry stepped outside, joining us at the breakfast table. He tilted his head skyward, beaming into the sun like it was the greatest vision he’d ever seen. He looked rejuvenated and in awe, carefree and elated, and I hated it. He patted my father on the back as though they were the oldest of friends. His sunglasses were gone, and in their place were round spectacles with dainty silver wire rims.</p>
<p>“Ah, back from the dead, I see!” my father said with a chuckle, his silver eyes gleaming in the sun. He crinkled his newspaper, folding it into a tidy pile on his lap. “How are you feeling?”</p>
<p>“Rested!” Harry exclaimed, tapping a spoon against a soft boiled egg with all the care of a Hippogriff ramming its beak into a melon. I cringed as the egg cracked messily, splattering yolk over the sides of the glass egg cup, bits of shell mixing in with the buttercup yellow. Did this man possess any manners whatsoever? Who had raised him?</p>
<p>“I can show you around… if you like,” I drawled as I swept a hand through my white-blond hair, eager to do my obligatory duty and be done with it. I had very important sulking and napping to do.</p>
<p>“That’d be great. Thank you.” A perfunctory glance my way, and then he was descending upon his glass of apricot juice, glugging it with all the sophistication of a caveman thumping a club on the ground.</p>
<p>Mafalda kindly opened another soft boiled egg for him, lopping off the top of the shell with finesse. It was absurd. A grown man, and he couldn’t do it properly on his own. The last time my mother had done that for me, I was eight years old.</p>
<p>“Have another egg!” my mother said, eyeing his egg-related gusto with curiosity. He’d tucked into it so quickly, he’d nearly inhaled the damn thing, sucked the contents out like it were a shot of vodka.</p>
<p>“No no no!” he said with a laugh. “I know myself too well. If I have a second, I’m just gonna have a third, and then a fourth, and then you’re just gonna have to roll me out of here.”</p>
<p>I eyed the exposed sliver of his chest, the top two buttons of his shirt undone to reveal a thatch of dark hair, a small silver locket dangling in the open space. I absently trailed a hand down my own neck, resting it at the base of my throat, my pale, virtually hairless body lying underneath the collar of my striped t-shirt, untouched and secret.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Like much of Northern Italy, the Crema town square was all brick streets and ancient architecture, high arches and thick Romanesque masonry, winsomely peeled stucco walls laced with creeping ivy.</p>
<p>I was surprised to see him handling a bicycle so well. I didn’t know what to expect from this wizarding royalty, this man whose family my own parents spoke about in a reverent tone. It was the kind of tone usually reserved for the most sacred of dusty magical texts as my father cradled them with careful gloved hands, turning the pages with a sparkle in his eye as he tilted a magnifying glass above the yellowed parchment, beckoning me closer with a childlike whisper of excitement. </p>
<p>When it came to the Potters, I didn’t ask for details beyond that which I was given. There was a somber lilt to my parents’ voices when they talked about their early years. Their reasons for leaving the magical world behind for our more bohemian, mostly Muggle existence seemed to be a wound that had never properly closed up. I didn’t want to dig inside the sore, even though I knew I could if I wanted to.</p>
<p>My father always made it clear I could ask anything, his eager attempts to thwart his own father’s legacy of distance and cruelty resulting in an abundance of open dialogue that was almost embarrassing to my adolescent self. I suddenly required more privacy with every passing year, a need to huddle in the dark and muse over the aching desperation of youth growing like a cancer within me. I could see that it hurt him, that he wanted me as near as I’d always been, clinging to his leg and tugging at his sleeve as he worked until he would haul me in his lap and wrap my grubby fingers around the handle of that magnifying glass, helping me support the weight of it as he showed me the latest riveting kernel of knowledge he’d unearthed. We were European nomads immersed in rich cultural and intellectual pursuits, straining our eyes over book after book, a trio of makeshift librarians who shared a hunger for the written word.</p>
<p>Harry and I parked our bikes on the wall of a cafe and sat outside, perched in wrought iron chairs, me nursing an iced coffee and him nursing a beer.</p>
<p>“So, what do you do around here?” he asked, eyes flitting about the area, taking a gulp of his beer, foam lingering on his upper lip.</p>
<p>“Nothing. Wait for summer to end.” I leaned back and followed his cues of boredom, eyes aimlessly roaming the square.</p>
<p>“And how do you spend the winter? Let me guess, waiting for summer to come?”</p>
<p>“We don’t spend the winter here. We’re European mutts. ‘The globe is our home,’ or something like that. English by way of France by way of Italy. We’re in England most of the year since Father teaches at Oxford. We’re here for Christmas usually, but — ”</p>
<p>With one deft motion, he leaned forward and flicked his wand from his back pocket, unzipped his rucksack, and slipped it inside.</p>
<p>“Bold of you.” I narrowed my eyes, remembering too late that my sunglasses hid my derision.</p>
<p>“It’s not like someone is really going to stop me and ask what is it. It’s amazing what people will convince themselves they didn’t see, all for the sake of politeness. People don’t like confrontation, if they can avoid it.” He turned back to me, and I wished I could see what his green eyes were broadcasting underneath the shade of his glasses. At the same time, I was grateful for the separation. Every time I’d seen those glittering irises in unmitigated glory, something had stirred within me that was… unsettling. Any shield was welcome. “Don’t you carry yours?”</p>
<p>“Mother says we’re wizards of discretion.”</p>
<p>He laughed, a short, curious sound. I couldn’t tell what he was thinking.</p>
<p>“Well, that might work for your mother, but I’m afraid I’m a bit reliant on mine. Never know when you’re going to need it.”</p>
<p>“Besides my family and the last two PhD candidates, you’re probably the only wizard to step foot in this town. There really aren’t any wizarding villages in this part of Europe. Makes sense to be careful.” A touch of defense had found its way into my tone, but he didn’t bristle, only shrugged in that frustratingly casual manner of his.</p>
<p>“You might be surprised. We can be a covert lot. I’ve certainly found that out working on this infuriating manuscript,” he grumbled, gesturing vaguely to his rucksack. “You never answered me. What do you around here?”</p>
<p>“Read books. Transcribe music. Swim at the river. Go out at night.” I slumped in my seat, suddenly painfully aware of how pathetically dull my life sounded. I wondered what his life was like outside of the world of historical texts and etymology.</p>
<p>At twenty-two, he was a tad younger than the candidates I was used to seeing. He didn’t look like a scholar. He didn’t have that pinched-face, tunnel vision appearance of all the other doctoral students, their posture cramped like the elderly from hours bent over desks, their eyes straining from the endless perusal of books under library-lamp light. He was agile and tanned, toned muscles peeking through the thin fabric of his short-sleeved button-down. His glasses were about the only thing intellectual about his appearance. Everything else called to mind someone who felt more at home kicking a soccer ball across a field than sequestering himself among the stuffy academics.</p>
<p>“Sounds fun,” he said, curt and uninterested as he abruptly stood, slinging his bag over his shoulder and swinging a long leg over the bicycle I’d leant him. “Later.”</p>
<p>I straddled the seat of my own bike, brow furrowed as I watched him retreat, feeling decidedly dismissed and insignificant.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I found myself inexplicably lingering in Father’s study when he and Harry would scrutinize his materials. The agreement for housing these candidates involved a bit of cerebral labor in exchange for room and board. They would help with Father’s current projects, and they had the rest of the time to work on their dissertation.</p>
<p>Father didn’t question my presence. He simply seemed glad to see me back in that room with him, even if only as a silent observer. I crouched in a chair in the corner, concealing my covert glances at Harry’s body behind the cover of a novel, peering at them as they sorted archaeological slides into piles. </p>
<p>“More apricot juice?” My mother entered with a silver tray in tow, her steps as light as air. She set it down and handed an eager Harry a glass.</p>
<p>“Here, tesoro.” She smiled at me, her blue eyes crinkling as she handed me a glass too. I took a measured sip and watched Harry down his in one swift gulp. He seemed to consume everything that way, one gluttonous swallow as though it would disappear if he didn’t devour it immediately. He smacked his lips, and I wrinkled my nose. Without preamble, he plucked his wand from his back pocket and conjured water into the empty glass.</p>
<p>“<em>Aguamenti</em> comes from the Spanish and Portuguese, <em>aqua </em>meaning water and <em>mente </em>meaning mind,” Father declared proudly, raking a hand through his pale hair.</p>
<p>“I may have to disagree with you there, Professor.” Harry flashed a broad grin, all teeth, and shot my mother an apologetic look. “I’m gonna talk etymology, so just bear with me a second. Er — normally you would be right, but in the case of <em>Aguamenti, </em>it’s a little bit more of a complicated journey. Although it does have roots in Spanish and Portuguese, both <em>agua </em>and <em>mente </em>are derived from Latin originally: the Latin terms, <em>aqua </em>meaning water and <em>mens </em>meaning mind, which of course becomes <em>mente </em>when adapted into Spanish. There’s also a suggestion among some linguistics scholars in the wizarding community that it may be a hybrid of <em>‘água’ </em>and ‘augment’, in the sense of ‘to increase’, hence the filling of the receptacle with water, increasing in volume, etcetera. But that leads us to rather dry quibbling about minutiae between experts which — ”</p>
<p>Harry paused as he noticed our sly smiles.</p>
<p>“Why am I getting the sense there’s a joke in the Malfoy family that I’m not in on?”</p>
<p>“Passed with flying colors,” Father pronounced with a definitive wave in the air, beaming at Harry.</p>
<p>“He does this every year. A sort of nerd-off to prove yourself,” I explained with a roll of my eyes.</p>
<p>He smiled at me for the briefest of moments, and my heart jumped into my throat. Looking back now, I think it remained there, lodged and throbbing, for the entirety of his stay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the next few days, I made excuses to trail behind him like a silent devotee, a panting puppy trotting along, struggling to keep up with his confident stride, his mile-long legs covering effortless distance. I was sickened by myself, but I couldn’t seem to stop it.</p>
<p>We would amble down the streets of Crema, Harry always deciding that the high noon sun was an indicator for the day’s drinking to begin. It wasn’t unusual for that part of the world, particularly in summer. Many people drank at midday meals, and the academics even more so. Parties at the house with Father’s university friends were always filled with wine glasses clinking in drunken toasts, brandy with dessert, and drinks in the parlor after dinner.</p>
<p>Still, he did it with the self-assurance with which he did everything, walking into a neighborhood bar as though he owned it, rendering my skills as tour guide completely useless. He greeted the old Italian men who took up residence there during the day, the ones whose lives consisted of chain-smoking, drinking, and playing endless card games, like they were well-established friends. He’d only been here a week and somehow had assumed the role of charming local, able to hold an amiable conversation with anyone he came across.</p>
<p>“How do you know about this place?” I asked, unable to keep the juvenile excitement from my voice.</p>
<p>He merely smiled and turned his attention back to the men seated around the table, pulling up a chair and joining the card game as though picking up where he’d left off only minutes ago.</p>
<p>“Ciao, Romano.”</p>
<p>“Ciao, Harry!” A man dealt him in, and I pulled up a chair behind him, no room left at the table.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The atmosphere of summer did nothing to dissuade my lust. As the heat mounted, layers came off to expose more flesh. Tantalizing slopes of bare shoulders and curves of muscular thighs were on display everywhere I turned.</p>
<p>Pansy sat beside me on the verdant lawn, her tank top clad body leaning into mine.</p>
<p>“Sicuramente è meglio di quello dell’anno scorso, ti ricordi?***” she said with a twinkle in her eye, nudging me with a sweaty shoulder. I inched further away and said nothing.</p>
<p>“Oui. Much better. He’s so handsome,” Maria chimed in, flipping her chestnut hair over her shoulder with a sigh.</p>
<p>This wasn’t a line of questioning I wanted to be caught between. I stood up and walked over to the table at the edge of the grass, circling the perimeter from a safe distance, my eyes continually drawn to his naked chest as he volleyed the ball over the net. He made a point for their team, triumphantly picking Chiara up by her lithe waist. She squealed in delight, and I stared at his large hands nestled in the small of her back, the patch of hair between his pectorals, trailing down the center of his stomach where it disappeared beneath his shorts.</p>
<p>I grabbed a bottle of water and an apricot from the table, walking back to where Pansy sat, my eyes glued to the ground.</p>
<p>“Draco! Acqua!” Maria’s hand reached out, and I offered the bottle.</p>
<p>“Perfect timing!” Harry jogged up and intercepted the bottle, chugging it like he had an interminable thirst that couldn’t be quenched. I glared at him as he braced his hand on my shoulder. Did his rudeness know no bounds? Did he think everyone owed him, walking around like he expected all of us to part the sea at his will?</p>
<p>None of our summer guests had been this gregarious. Mostly they’d been coiled into themselves, absorbed in their work like the outside world mattered very little. Harry seemed to be treating this stay as a vacation rather than an academic retreat.</p>
<p>His grip on my shoulder turned into a caress, the callused tips of his fingers digging into the muscle below my shoulder blade, and I felt my body yield to the press of his hand, a ripple running down my arm like a soothing balm. I wrenched free and hurriedly began to walk away, but he followed, letting out that light, airy laugh of his.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Draco? Did I pinch a nerve?”</p>
<p>I scowled at the question. It seemed to say so much, and I detested it. What did he know? How incisive could he possibly be, this carefree, brawny man who spent his days drinking old men under the table and chatting everyone up like he could sense what would seduce them, could be the exact person they wanted at the precise moment he needed to be? I stood on the sidelines, foul-tempered and envious, ever the spectator who wished they would all vanish and leave only the two of us.</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” I gritted out, watching the volleyball game with feigned intensity, ignoring the burgeoning smile I could see in my periphery.</p>
<p>“Here. Hold this.” He thrust the water bottle into my hand and set to work on my shoulder again. I tried to wrestle out of his grasp, but he pulled me back, warm palms, slightly damp from exercise, stroking my arm and shoulder. “Trust me. I’m going to be a doctor, remember?”</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes at the trite joke, my gaze darting around. I felt certain everyone around us could sense the arousal radiating off me, a thick cloud of pheromones penetrating the air and signaling to all that I wanted him.</p>
<p>“You’re too tense, Draco. You should try to relax more,” he murmured, leaning in so close I could feel his heat, could count his breaths as they puffed against my skin. “Pansy, come here! Help me out.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt Pansy’s hand replace his, and I stiffened.</p>
<p>“Feel that knot? He’s too tense, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you have no idea, Harry. Draco Malfoy has always been one tight ball of nerves. He’s our broody little darling though. We love him.” Pansy rubbed my shoulder, and disappointment flooded me as someone called Harry back to the game. He muttered a quick “later,” always that brusque word of leave I despised so much, like I was nothing more than a common maid to be waved away. “He’s right, you know. You really should — ”</p>
<p>I shook Pansy off and stalked away, the imprint of his hand lingering on me like a bruise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry didn’t show for dinner that night. I watched his empty place setting, boring my eyes into it as though it would fill up with his long limbs if I looked hard enough. I glanced at my mother and gestured to the empty chair.</p>
<p>“Lui è in ritardo****,” she said with a small smile.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think it’s rude when he says ‘Later’? Arrogant? Like he’s brushing us off? Like we’re the valet who just parked his car?” I spat out, leaning back in my chair. It was an idyllic July night, the air cooled down from midday, the night dusky and temperate, a balmy breeze rustling the branches of the peach trees, birds calling out into the darkness. The table was candlelit. We often dined outdoors during the summer, a curtain of stars blanketing above us as the sun faded into a ruddy vermilion behind the rolling acres of land.</p>
<p>My parents exchanged an inscrutable look. They had been doing that above my head more and more those days, and I found it intolerable.</p>
<p>“I think he’s just shy,” my father offered, pouring us all a glass of wine.</p>
<p>I made a guttural noise of disbelief.</p>
<p>“You can’t be serious. He’s a social butterfly. He’s… the most <em>American</em> Englishman I’ve ever met. It’s appalling.” I scraped a spoon through my risotto and narrowed my eyes. My parents laughed, my father giving my mother’s hand an affectionate squeeze.</p>
<p>“Now now, Draco, don’t be a snob. We have to put up with him for six long weeks. Do stop that peevish teenage attitude of yours. It’s most unbecoming. Be a good host, darling,” my mother admonished, drizzling oil and vinegar on top of the grilled peach slices lining her salad.</p>
<p>“I think he’s shy,” my father repeated with a tilt of his head, his eyes examining me across the table, “and I think you’ll grow to like him.”</p>
<p>“And what if I grow to hate him?”</p>
<p>“Mio piccino!” my mother scolded. “Mafalda, you can clear Harry’s place. I don’t think he’ll be joining us tonight.”</p>
<p>I turned my eyes heavenward, a beleaguered sigh escaping my lips, and slid my chair into the space Harry should have been occupying.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>“Play something for us, Draco.”</p>
<p>My father squeezed my shoulder as he walked past me, a glass of brandy in his hand.</p>
<p>“Non mi va.*****” I slung my skinny legs over the arm of my chair, restless and petulant, watching some insipid Italian TV show that was doing nothing for my mood.</p>
<p>“Perchè non ti va?” my mother asked, reaching from her position on the couch, running a hand through my hair.</p>
<p>“I just don’t! Can’t you leave me be for once?”</p>
<p>In the fall, I would be attending the Conservatoire de Paris, playing piano until my fingers went numb. All I wanted was to while away the summer hours one last time, even if my skin was itching with an incurable disquiet I couldn’t quite name.</p>
<p>“Go see your friends. What’s Pansy up to tonight? Don’t waste away in the living room, dear.”</p>
<p>I rose with a dramatic stomp onto the wooden floor.</p>
<p>“Fine. I’ll waste away in my room, where there isn’t an audience to remark on my every move.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I couldn’t sleep. I stripped off all my clothes, the breeze from the open window wafting over my neglected cock. I stroked it with languid interest, trying in vain not to conjure images of dark, loosely curled hair and olive skin.</p>
<p>I gazed toward the open bathroom door. I’d left it ajar in some voyeuristic hope that he’d wander in, tired and perhaps a little drunk from his evening’s revelry, carelessly untucking his cock from his shorts to take a piss. He’d assume I was asleep or maybe he wouldn’t care either way, calling on the longstanding locker room camaraderie of men, the tradition of comfortable nudity that I could never quite fathom, always too afraid of my secret being unearthed by the probing eyes around me. I couldn’t relax in those situations. Everyone dismissed it as modesty or my usual fussiness, the tendency to stand by my own rather than among the crowd that people had come to know as simply my way.</p>
<p>I looked at the blue tile on the bathroom walls, the moonbeams leaking in to bounce off the shiny floor, and imagined Harry standing there, shedding his shorts instead of merely unzipping them, the fabric falling off the irresistible curve of his arse. My hand sped up on my cock, my fingers reaching up to stroke across my chest, flicking a sensitive nipple, a bitten back moan dying on my tongue.</p>
<p>It hurt. It hurt because it felt wonderful, and it hurt because it wasn’t his hand on my swollen erection, coaxing my feverish flesh into glorious relief. I stopped touching myself, unable to handle the pain and equally unable to suffer the joy. I atrophied in lustful purgatory, but I also loved that addictive yearning. It felt like the truest, rawest state one could reside in.</p>
<p>I cursed him for being somewhere else, no doubt frolicking with local girls, the ones who hung on his every word, their flirty eyelashes blinking toward him as they threw their arms around his neck. I thought of Chiara draped all over him on the lawn, the way Maria and Pansy spoke of him like he was a supreme being, an archetype of masculine perfection, the likes of which they’d never seen before. They were right, but I wanted him all for my own.  </p>
<p>I wanted him, but I hated that desire. It drilled into me like an animal burrowing into the pit of my stomach, consuming me until I was a hollow shell of ache. All traces of the previous Draco were being slowly eradicated. I belonged to him and him alone, and he didn’t even know I existed.</p>
<p>Was it better to want him than to have him? The prospect of relief was too awful to contemplate. Was there anything more terrifying than spinning fantasy into reality? Disappointment always lurked around the corner when you finally got what you wanted.</p>
<p>I was curious which desire would win out in the end and whether or not it would destroy us both. Was my neediness like a disease that could infect him with every brush of his skin on mine? What was desire and why was it such a foreign horror, tantalizing yet sharp, the apple of Eden laden with shards of glass? I felt certain I would die solving this riddle, writhing in my own painful bed of yearning, growing over top of my corpse like tenacious, thorny vines, thick and binding.</p>
<p>With a pained whimper, I ignored the throb between my legs, rolling onto my stomach as though to stifle it, trapping my cock between my torso and the sheets, out of sight and out of reach.</p>
