    <p>Minerva McGonagall, headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, former professor of Transfiguration, Former Head of Gryffindor house made her way up the winding staircase to her office, shaking her head. How had this happened? There would be Howlers in the morning and not just from the parents of the two boys. What had happened? The entire Wizarding world would blame her. They’d demand her job, or the Sorting Hat at the very least. They’d call the whole exercise a travesty, an outdated ritual, any number of things. She slumped in the chair behind her desk. It had all started out just fine. The students’ arrival, Sprout leading the first years in... She’d noticed the young Malfoy easily; looking so like his father had that first day, if a little less arrogant. And then she’d seen Harry’s son. Even if she hadn’t met the boy several times over the years at Ministry functions and Remembrance reunions, his green eyes and black hair would have pegged him immediately. Just as his older brother had been easily pegged as the grandson of one James Potter two years before. Then the hat had sung its song, the words now completely forgotten after the evening’s events.</p>
<p>And then the sorting. Oh Merlin, the sorting. If she could only go back a thousand years and stomp that hat into the ground. At first, she’d been a little relieved when the hat had placed the Malfoy boy in Gryffindor. His father might throw a fit, but it would do the boy good to not be associated with that other house. A new house for the family name to start over in. But, then... Then! The youngest Potter boy had taken his place on the stool and the hat had taken only a few seconds and the entire hall had gone deathly silent. Her world had crashed around her as the hat’s word echoed in the Great Hall.</p>
