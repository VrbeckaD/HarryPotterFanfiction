    <p>When Dennis went to Hogsmeade without his brother to buy some sweets to owl his parents, he never thought that this would happen. When he wanted some moment alone and just take in the scene of Diagon Alley filled with so many magical folks, he never thought some of them had sinister ideas. When he was petrified, and a sack was pulled over his head, he was hoping it was just his classmates playing horrible prank on him.</p>
<p>He never expected to be kidnapped by Death Eaters. He never knew he could feel so much fear. He was thrown to another Death Eater and nearly fell on his nose.</p>
<p>He saw a face and his heartbeat quickened. It was professor Snape! Dennis was sure he’d be rescued by then. But then the professor cursed him, the professor chained him to the wall, took his wand and smirked as he did during potions class. Dennis shivered as the potions master of Hogwarts put on a glinting mask, he hadn’t noticed the robes earlier, Death Eater robes reminiscent of the robes he has seen in the Prophet.</p>
<p>It was true then, Snape really was a Death Eater. Dennis has stumbled on a few articles about the first war and how Snape escaped Azkaban when he was claimed as a spy for Dumbledore. Dennis wondered if this was just a ruse. That maybe Snape needed to maintain his cover, and that Dennis would be rescued later when the professor’s position as a spy wasn’t at risk.</p>
<p>But then Death Eaters came and taunted him, mocking his muggle blood. Then they hit him, kicked him. Cursed him. Dennis was in tears as the cruciatus licked his battered body. How could anyone cast that curse? They were all wearing masks and he wondered if Snape was part of the group who beat him. Was he wrong? Did Snape fool Dumbledore, was he really a dark wizard? Dennis had his fair share of awful muggle teachers and none of them compared to Snape, but Snape no matter how horrible as a professor surely isn’t capable of all this pain?</p>
<p>Dennis continued to believe in the professor because what else could he believe in? He doesn’t know how much time has passed. He hears whispers about some ritual, he hears arguments about the possibility of something, but he was too hungry, and his body hurt so much. He broke his arm once, after falling from a tree. He wondered if both his arms are broken and if his ribs are cracked or just bruised. Madam Pomfrey would have to feed him so much skelegrow once he’s back in Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Back in Hogwarts with his brother, back to his friends, back somewhere safe, where it doesn’t hurt. His tears cloud his vision.</p>
<p>Someone quickly rolled him over and he winced.</p>
<p>“Come now, Mr. Creevey. Here I thought you were a brave Gryffindor.” He knew that voice. He opened his eyes.</p>
<p>“Stay awake, boy. And keep your mouth shut.” Snape pushed something hard into his robes and Dennis was relieved to see it was his wand. It was kept in place by his trousers. He must make sure he doesn’t fall on it and snap it. “Drink this.” He drank the potion despite how horrible it tasted, and he sighed as the pain went away for a while.</p>
<p>His binds were removed, and he was picked up by his professor. He never thought he’d be so happy to be in Snape’s presence, much less in Snape’s arms.</p>
<p>But he felt safe. It would do for now.</p>
<p>But then they stopped, and Dennis was nearly thrown from Snape’s grasp.</p>
<p>He had his answers then. The Death Eaters called Snape a traitor and Dennis felt guilt for every time he thought his professor a dark wizard. Dennis felt shame as he recalled the rumors he heard and spread against Snape as his professor writhed on the floor as he was cursed over and over with the cruciatus. Dennis felt tears in his eyes when his professor was thrown in the cell with him and recalled the horrible moments, he wished Snape to be ill, so Potions would be cancelled.</p>
<p>It continued for what seemed were years but could have been mere days. The Death Eaters barely paid him attention when the traitor to their cause was in the same cell as boring Creevey.</p>
<p>He still heard whispers though.</p>
<p>He heard excited whispering, plans that would supposedly bring Dumbledore to his knees. Plans to recruit more followers for their Dark Lord.</p>
<p>He heard arguments that maybe they should remove some limbs from the hostages to make things more dramatic. Dennis thanked every deity he knew when a voice would deny it and say they had more class than common thugs, Dennis cursed them and yet rejoiced, and he felt sick because of it.</p>
<p>There was one thing that changed though. The professor rarely spoke, often because he was not conscious, but when he did, Dennis listened.</p>
<p>The professor told him about how the Light would likely have noticed their absence and would most likely be planning on rescuing Dennis.</p>
<p>“You mean us, sir.”</p>
<p>“What was that?”</p>
<p>“They’re planning to rescue us. Not just me.” He corrected.</p>
<p>Dennis saw his professor bow his head and his dark hair hid his expression. Surely the Light would work to save their spy, won’t they? They wouldn’t leave a comrade behind.</p>
<p>But the professor stayed silent, so Dennis did what he always did when they were sure Death Eaters won’t be barging in on their cells. He moved just a tad closer to his professor, enough so the man knew that Dennis was with him, that his student was there with him and not being tortured Merlin knows where the professor was dragged to. And Dennis made a vow that he would make sure the professor survives this and they’d escape together.</p>
<p>Dennis was no fool. The only reason Snape hasn’t been trying to escape was because Dennis could very well get killed if they were caught. Waiting for rescue seems relatively safer than trying to escape the Dark Lord’s stronghold. He wanted to plot for ways out but when he proposed doing such a thing the professor hushed him and reminded him that the Dark Lord has more spies than him and that the walls have ears.</p>
<p>There were times when they made Dennis watch though, as they tortured Snape just outside the cell. They said it must be a great show for a Gryffindor like him. Dennis wanted to protest, to bang their cell and demand them to stop. But Snape demanded his word that he won’t do something that would endanger both of them. Revealing his emotions could get them killed, after all.</p>
<p>Dennis once again became a punching bag to the Death eaters, but he heard they were warned to not damage him to severely. Dennis wondered where the rescue was. Where was the Light? His whole body hurt, and he wanted nothing more than to go home, he almost can’t recall what home felt like anymore.</p>
<p>His professor returned in worse shape every time and Dennis feared he’d be left alone with the Death Eaters if Snape doesn’t hold on. What would he be holding on to anyway?</p>
<p>The Day finally came. A Death Eater splashed water to wake both and Dennis put himself between the Death Eater and his professor. Snape was sluggish, he can’t have much strength left.</p>
<p>The Death Eater bound him, and the professor and Dennis early screamed when the Death Eater stomped on his professor. A bag was pulled down on his head before he was dragged away. His heart quickened in fear and he wondered where they’d be going. Were they going to be killed by He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named himself? Were they going to be cruciod to death? Dennis was nearly shaking with fear when he felt a tugging in his navel, they apparated and Dennis felt his stomach drop.</p>
<p>He heard a chilling voice, laughter harsh to the ears, where were they?</p>
<p>Then he heard Albus Dumbledore and his heart soared. But why did they apparate near Dumbledore? Death Eaters even You-Know-Who are afraid of Dumbledore, Dennis bit his lip.</p>
<p>The bag was removed from his head and he stared in horror as Hogwarts loomed before him, the faculty and many students stood behind the wards. He looked around and saw himself surrounded by masked Death Eaters, in the forefront was the Dark Lord himself.</p>
<p>What was going on?</p>
