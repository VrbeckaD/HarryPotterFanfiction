    <p>Albus hadn't liked teenagers even when he was one. In fact, the only person he'd liked when he was his eldest child's age was Scorpius – he hadn't even liked himself much, and certainly hadn't cared much for his peers at all. So, when he watched his children enter the Three Broomsticks laughing and grinning, he was immensely relieved to see they weren't having a similar experience.</p><p>"She's not going to go to the Christmas dance with you," Avery argued with Orion. "She's just not."</p><p>"You don't know that," Orion countered.</p><p>Lexi chimed in quickly, unwinding her Slytherin scarf from her neck and shaking a few bits of snow from her wild dark curls. "She's the most popular girl in school," Lexi said. "She's not going to date you."</p><p>"She might if I'm charming enough and bring gifts," Orion said. Beside him, Avery and Adam looked around until they spotted Albus watching patiently from the corner booth he'd claimed a half hour ago. He would have jumped to his feet to hug them all, but his leg was aching from a scuffle with a Norwegian Ridgeback a few days ago. He waved, and an infectious grin spread across Avery's face as she broke away from the group and rushed towards him.</p><p>"Papa!"</p><p>She slid into the booth with such velocity that she nearly settled on Albus' lap and threw her arms around his neck. Albus hugged her tight. He hadn't seen his Hogwarts-aged children for nearly two and a half months since he and Scorpius had said goodbye to them on Platform 9¾ and had missed them dearly – especially now when he'd just returned from a week-long assignment at a dragon reservation in Germany and Scorpius was away on ministry business in Canada. It had been a stressful year leading into a harrowing few months for both of them – they'd barely seen one another outside of brief meals and the few minutes before bed and after waking, but Albus knew things were set to improve now that he was back to normal work at his private magical creatures rehabilitation clinic and Scorpius was finishing a major acquisition phase for the Department of International Academic Collaboration. Scorpius was due home in two days' time, and Albus had missed his family so much that he'd decided to come visit the older kids during a Hogsmeade weekend (he'd even had to send special one-time permission slips for Lexi and Adam, who were in their second year). Charlie, Samuel and Will had decided they'd rather spend the day with their Grandpa Draco and Grandma Dania in London, and Albus really couldn't blame them – they always came home from Malfoy shopping trips with the most outrageous gifts.</p><p>"It's good to see you," Albus said, letting go of Avery in favor of embracing Lexi and Adam. He kissed the top of Lexi's head and ruffled Adam's hair before reaching across the table and grasping Orion's hand briefly in greeting.</p><p>"It's good to see you too, Papa," Adam said.</p><p>"Really?" Albus asked. "Aren't you supposed to be embarrassed to be seen with your parents by now?"</p><p>"You're not embarrassing," Lexi said.</p><p>"Well…" Avery hedged, biting her lip. "He is a little bit."</p><p>"When?" Albus asked.</p><p>"The time you and Dad sent me flowers for Valentine's Day?"</p><p>"Or the time you sent us those custom singing Howlers just before Christmas," Adam added.</p><p>"I suppose showing up and demanding to see me after that flying accident was pretty embarrassing," Lexi admitted.</p><p>"That was mostly your Dad," Albus defended. "And you know why he's touchy about it."</p><p>"It doesn't matter," Lexi said. "You walked into the Great Hall during dinner."</p><p>Albus didn't want to tell her that the letter they'd received from the school nurse had been horribly vague and had sent Scorpius into a bit of a panic, or that he'd tried and failed to get his husband to calm down before walking into the Great Hall to find their daughter, who was only nursing a few cuts and bruises hours after the incident.</p><p>"Albus," Orion began, leaning across the table. "I'm trying to get Harriet to go to the Christmas dance with me. She's your cousin – how can I convince her?"</p><p>Albus laughed, wrapping his hands around his warm Butterbeer. He'd caught quite a chill on the walk up to the Three Broomsticks and the small mid-November snow flurry hadn't helped him. The warmth of the glass seeped into his palms.</p><p>"I'm not the best person to ask," Albus said.</p><p>"Oh, come on," Orion groaned. "You do cute stuff with my brother <em> all the time </em> and he loves it."</p><p>All three of the Malfoy-Potter children gagged in unison at the thought. Albus gave Avery a gentle shove in response.</p><p>"You really shouldn't be asking your brother's husband for dating advice," Albus said. "Besides, you know the story. We just kind of… fell into a relationship."</p><p>"Yeah, that sounds good," Orion said eagerly. "Teach me how to do that."</p><p>"She'd have to actually like you first," Lexi pointed out. She was sandwiched between Orion and Adam, and Adam had sunk back into his seat with his arms wrapped around his middle. While Orion argued with the girls, Albus leaned over to talk to Adam.</p><p>"You doing okay?' Albus asked. Though it was some relief that Adam and Lexi were in the same year, Albus still worried about Adam the most – especially when he sent home letters with shaky handwriting. That was the first sign that he was struggling with anxiety again.</p><p>"I'm alright," Adam said with a shrug. "I'm having trouble with Charms and Transfiguration this year."</p><p>"Is there anything I can do?"</p><p>Adam shook his head, pulling off his Ravenclaw scarf and setting it atop Avery's. Albus noticed that Orion hadn't yet removed his, and it was fastened more like a tie than a scarf. He shook his head, forcibly reminded of Scorpius doing the same when he was young.</p><p>"I think I'll be okay," Adam said. "It helps that Lexi is in some of my classes."</p><p>"Okay, but if you need help just let me know," Albus said. "We can arrange for a private tutor and if you don't want anyone to know, that's okay."</p><p>At that, Adam smiled appreciatively. It didn't quite reach his eyes, and Albus noticed he looked terribly tired and drawn. "Thanks, Papa."</p><p>Albus wanted to hug him. Adam had been a very cuddly child – even more than his older sisters – but Albus didn't want to embarrass him in a room full of his fellow students. A tight hug and some extra spending money for sweets at Honeydukes would have to suffice when they parted company.</p><p>The barmaid, who Albus knew to be Madam Rosmerta's niece and an avid lover of Kneazles, appeared and Albus ordered enough food and drinks to keep the kids happy. It was selfish, he knew, to bribe them into spending time with him with the promise of greasy pub food, but it was the only ploy he had and he'd missed them so much.</p><p>"How is Dad?" Lexi asked after their food and drinks arrived. After switching places with Adam, she ripped a piece off one of the pretzels and took a big bite of it, eyeing Avery and Orion's Butterbeer with envy. She was nearly thirteen and would soon be able to order her own, but Albus supposed that wasn't much consolation for a child who loved everything Butterbeer-flavored when she was stuck with hot chocolate.</p><p>"He's good," Albus said. "We've both been busy with work –"</p><p>"You're <em> always </em> busy with work," Lexi interrupted. "Do you know how many times we had dinner with both of you from start to finish last summer? Fifteen. I counted."</p><p>Albus cringed. "I know," he said with remorse. "It's been an odd few months, but I think it's getting better."</p><p>"I hope so," Lexi said. "Dad wasn't very happy when we left for school."</p><p>Albus sighed. The last week of August had been rough for Scorpius at work and he'd been exhausted when they'd taken the kids to King's Cross. He'd gone straight back to the office after the train was gone.</p><p>"I'll be home for all of Christmas break, just working with the rehab creatures," Albus assured her. "And your dad is going to take some time off so he's home more too."</p><p><em> He’d better </em>, Albus thought, making a mental note to talk to Scorpius about it when he came home. He missed Scorpius so much that he was even looking forward to a potentially uncomfortable conversation.</p><p>"Yeah, okay," Lexi said. It was clear she didn't believe him as she looked down into her mug of hot chocolate, despondent. Lexi was normally happy and energetic, so whenever she became sad it hit Albus hard.</p><p>"We will," Albus assured her. "I promise. It'll be the best Christmas we've ever had. And it's only a little more than a month away. It's what? The sixteenth?"</p><p>"Seventeenth," Adam corrected. Albus hadn't realized Adam had been listening, but he saw the same sadness in Adam's eyes too. His heart sank.</p><p>"I didn't realize we'd been that… disjointed," Albus confessed.</p><p>"Are we talking about the summer?" Avery asked, leaning back over towards Albus. She'd been talking to Orion, and whatever she'd said had clearly put Orion in a bad mood. He slumped down in his seat, and Albus suspected she'd shut down another one of his ridiculous ideas for wooing Harriet Lupin.</p><p>"Yes," Lexi said.</p><p>"Oh, yeah. Summer was awful," Avery said. "I <em> hated </em> it. We were barely all together. You and Dad were hardly in the same room. I started to wonder if something was wrong."</p><p>Adam's eyes widened at the suggestion and his gaze snapped back to Albus.</p><p>"No, no. Everything is fine," Albus assured him quickly. "Nothing's wrong with your dad and I. I promise."</p><p>Lexi raised her eyebrows, not convinced as she took another huge bite from the pretzel.</p><p>Clearly, the kids had discussed this after departing for Hogwarts and for the first time in years Albus felt out of touch with his children. He and Scorpius tried so hard to be aware of what they were doing and how the kids were affected by everything, and now Albus began to wonder if he was a good father at all if he'd barely taken notice of how little time he and Scorpius had spent with their kids together during summer break. Albus looked between the three of them, feeling more than a little lost.</p><p>"I'm sorry," was all Albus could say. "Scorpius and I didn't mean…"</p><p>He trailed off, brought down by Avery, Adam and Lexi's inability to meet his eyes. They were both so smart and so mature that sometimes he forgot they were only twelve, and by virtue of being the oldest Avery often seemed like a particularly small adult, and they'd spent so much of the year previous helping Charlie with the emotional turmoil left in her mother's wake and the fiasco of her adoption that maybe he'd forgotten to spend extra time with the other kids.</p><p>Albus took a sip of his Butterbeer, not knowing what else to do. Fortunately, Avery spoke up and, as always, seemed to save the day.</p><p>"Well, just don't let it happen again," she said in a mock-scolding tone that sounded far too much like Albus' mother for his liking. He smiled at her and set his mug down with shaking hands when he saw that her smirk didn't meet her eyes. No amount of Butterbeer seemed to be able to warm him, and he felt a strange weight starting to settle in his chest, making him deeply uncomfortable. He supposed that was the price he paid for letting his children down.</p><p>"We'll make it up to you," Albus said. "I promise."</p><p>That seemed to be enough for Adam and Avery, but Lexi didn't perk up. Albus wracked his brain for what to do, and decided the best course of action was the most basic one available. He slid his mug of Butterbeer over to her.</p><p>"I'm not supposed to," Lexi said, though Albus knew she had Butterbeer all the time in small amounts at her grandparents' homes.</p><p>"I won't tell if you don’t," Albus said with a conspiratorial wink. Lexi grinned and drank deeply from the mug. Albus hoped the warm sensation from the Butterbeer would help her feel better, at least for a moment, and when she slid over after finishing the drink and lay her head against his shoulder, listening to Avery, Adam and Orion argue about the virtues of their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Albus hoped he was forgiven.</p>
<hr/><p>Exhaustion had settled into Scorpius' bones a week ago, and as he trudged up the path to the house on a dreary Monday afternoon in November, he could think of little more than a few hugs from his children, his husband's cooking, a long, hot shower and some sleep. His feet felt heavy and his hands were cold, but he didn't have the energy to fish his gloves out from the depths of his coat. Another two minutes, and he'd be inside with Charlie clinging to his waist, Samuel chattering on about whatever he was into this week, and Will begging for another dog while Albus forced a cup of tea on him. Another two minutes and life would be back to normal, or as close to normal as it had been this hectic year.</p><p>Usually, Scorpius loved his job. He had a mission – one that really mattered – and he was in a position to make the wizarding world a better place for his children and for the future. Most of the time, he was happy with his work, but lately it had been trying with several wizarding governments worldwide making attempts to protect academic information as proprietary. It was making his life very difficult and had kept him away from home three times as much as normal, but he was hoping things would calm down now – hoping he could go back to his quieter life. Maybe he could take a few days off next week and spend them at home with the kids – surely they would like that...</p><p>Scorpius trudged up the steps, shivering as he passed through the last of the considerable wards he and Albus had set up around the house. It was a brief buzzing that never failed to bother him, and normally Albus took them down when he knew Scorpius was coming in. Scorpius checked his watch – he was right on time, so Albus should have been expecting him.</p><p><em> Don't be selfish </em> , Scorpius thought as he unlocked the door. <em> Just because he works on our property half the time doesn't mean he's not terribly busy too. </em></p><p>He entered the front hall and lay briefcase on the ground and hung his robes on the rack. The house was silent and Scorpius listened closely for signs of life.  Silence. Maybe they'd gone to visit Albus' parents and had lost track of time?</p><p>"Albus?" Scorpius called into the house, unbuttoning his waistcoat. The air was terribly warm and still and it gave Scorpius an uneasy feeling. Clearly, someone had cast a heating charm, which was unusual. Even when he was alone, Albus preferred to sit by the fire than use heating charms on the house (he called them "stuffy" and "unnecessary").</p><p>"Charlie! Samuel! Will!"</p><p>A few seconds of silence followed before a tapping and the clanging of small metal tags rang down the hall. Ridgebit, their English Shepherd, appeared a moment later, barreling down the corridor at full speed, her paws sliding on the smooth wooden floor.</p><p>"Oh, no," Scorpius muttered, fully expecting to be flattened by the dog. He braced himself for an impact that never came as Ridgebit stopped short and barked up at him.</p><p>"Oh, shush," he said, finally admitting to himself that he was truly alone. He gave Ridgebit a quick scratch behind her ears and walked past her toward the kitchen. He'd nearly made it through the cavernous living room where the fireplace was lit with dying flames to the rarely-used dining room when Ridgebit barked again and followed at his side, nudging his legs with every step. Scorpius staggered into the wall and glared at her.</p><p>"Give me a minute," he said, his tone sharper than normal. "Just let me get my tea."</p><p>Scorpius pushed past her into the kitchen where a discarded mug of tea sat cold on the counter. Beside it, a half-eaten bowl of soup was overturned, its contents covering a good portion of the island Albus usually reserved for food prep.</p><p>Scorpius frowned. Albus never left the kitchen like this and the kids would have never left such a mess in Albus' sacred cooking space.</p><p>He drew his wand and cleared his throat, preparing to tidy up before venturing out to the barn (where he would surely find Albus distracted with some critical case like a dog with curse damage or a diseased niffler). Ridgebit wasn't having it however, and began barking at him, bouncing up and down on her front paws, her eyes wild and alert.</p><p>"What is it?" Scorpius asked, lowering his wand. He considered the dog's brown eyes as if she would answer him with clear, concise words, and received only more barking and bouncing. Scorpius sighed, dropping his hands to his sides in frustration. He couldn't think to start with and now something was clearly off and the dog wouldn't shut up. He looked up to the ceiling in exasperation. This wasn't what he needed right now.</p><p>He was only allowed to wallow in self-pity for a moment, however. Ridgebit bit his hand – hard enough to hurt, but not hard enough to break the skin, and he yelped in surprise. Ridgebit wasn't a biter.</p><p>"Hey!" he yelled, jumping back. He couldn't remember the last time he'd had to discipline the dog – it had probably been at least a year, as she was remarkably well behaved, especially with the children – so instead of reacting, he just stared in shock. Ridgebit, to her credit, simply stared back.</p><p>"What the hell…" Scorpius muttered, holding his offended hand. It dawned on Scorpius that something was severely wrong – the house was still and too-warm and Ridgebit, the most emotionally-intelligent animal he'd ever seen, was clearly reacting to something.</p><p>"Show me," Scorpius said, and began to walk from the kitchen.</p><p>Just as he expected, Ridgebit ran ahead of him, barking madly and looking back every few seconds to ensure he was following. Scorpius stayed close behind her, mindful of each weary step. He followed her down the hall and to the ajar basement door. The lower level of the house had been converted into a library to save space after they'd adopted Samuel and Will. Scorpius and Albus kept saying they'd build an addition to house all the books Scorpius had collected over the years but they never seemed to find the time between work, the kids, and their families.</p><p>Ridgebit nudged the door open and bounded down the steep stairs. Scorpius followed, his pace slowed in an effort to avoid tripping and falling and his heart picking up pace as Ridgebit's barking intensified.</p><p>The room below was lined with books and was lit by enchanted, unbreakable lanterns that Hermione had charmed to only need relighting annually. It was a warm room with a massive mahogany desk that Scorpius had left covered in papers and a closed, lead-lined laptop that he used sparingly. The desk sat atop a large Persian rug that covered most of the unfinished wood floor, and atop the Persian rug lay Albus, unmoving and pale.</p><p>Scorpius' eyes widened and he jumped over the bottom stair, his weariness suddenly overtaken by worry.  He nearly tripped over himself as he scrambled to Albus' side and knelt down, tossing his wand down onto the floor beside him.</p><p>"Albus?" he hissed, patting his husband's cheek, gentle at first and then with more force as Albus didn't stir.</p><p>Albus' face was both splotchy and drained of color, and there were deep, dark circles under his eyes. His hair was more of a mess than normal and looked like it hadn't been washed for several days. Scorpius looked him over and once Ridgebit stopped barking he heard Albus' breathing. It was strained and shallow. There was a rattle coming from Albus' lungs that clearly said he was congested.</p><p><em> Illness, not injury </em>, Scorpius thought and seized Albus' shoulders, shaking them roughly.</p><p>"Albus? Come on," Scorpius said, his voice firm and loud. "Wake up."</p><p>Albus groaned, but barely twitched under Scorpius' hands.</p><p>"Al, please."</p><p>Albus' eyes opened to show a sliver of green surrounded by red. His eyes were entirely bloodshot and discolored, and Scorpius gathered Albus up to rest across his legs.</p><p>"You have to tell me what's wrong," Scorpius said, his voice shaking. "I can't help if I don't know what's wrong."</p><p>Albus opened his mouth but only a strangled sound came out. He took another shallow breath – Scorpius suspected it was the best he could do – and croaked out a single word.</p><p>"Lexi."</p><p>"Lexi? What about her?”</p><p>Albus' unfocused gaze shifted up to the desk where several pieces of parchment sat precariously on the edge. Scorpius snatched one and unfolded the note, pushed his glasses back up the bridge of his nose, and was immediately alarmed to see the school nurse's signature scrawled on the bottom.</p><p>
  <em> Malfoy-Potters, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I'm writing to inform you that Lexi has taken ill and has been transported to St. Mungo's Hospital as of this morning. Her illness is severe and her condition has deteriorated beyond what the school facilities can accommodate. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Please let me know if you have any questions, or if I can be of any assistance. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Sincerely, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Savannah Finnigan-Thomas </em>
</p><p>Scorpius stared at the note for a moment longer, and then dropped it to wrap his arms back around Albus, whose eyes were beginning to slip shut again.</p><p>"Don't you dare," Scorpius said, his voice wavering even more. He'd only heard of students being sent to the hospital from Hogwarts on two or three occasions, and they were all terribly severe. Lexi was ill and alone, and Albus was nearly unconscious in his arms.</p><p>"Sorry," Albus breathed, and dropped his head against Scorpius' shoulder with a painfully ragged breath. Scorpius shook him again, but Albus didn't stir. He was unconscious, and his head lolled back against Scorpius' arm, exposing his neck.</p><p>Along the left side was a patch of discolored, rough skin. It was a deep, dark purple that would have looked like a bruise where it not for the rough ring of skin dotted with small greenish bumps surrounding it.</p><p>"Merlin," Scorpius muttered. He knew Albus had visited the kids at Hogsmeade, so Lexi being sick couldn’t be unrelated. Were the rest of the kids sick too? Was this fatal? Was he going to lose his husband and his children all at once?</p><p>Scorpius looked down at Albus' unconscious face, trying to sort through his fear and figure out what to do. His hands were shaking and he wasn't confident in his ability to levitate him without hurting him – besides, he had no idea what Albus was ill with and if it would interact with simple spells.</p><p>"St. Mungo's," Scorpius said to himself. He felt around blindly for his wand and grappled for the handle when he found it, his eyes flickering from Albus' unconscious face to the gruesome mark on his neck.</p><p>Scorpius took a deep, calming breath and searched for a happy memory. He dug deep, and thought of one of the few nights over the summer when his family was all together – all the kids, Albus, Orion, Harry, Ginny, Draco and Dania were all in their living room, laughing and playing games, crammed onto couches and sitting on cushions on the floor. The kids were happy and together, and Albus seemed most content when they were all in one place, well-fed and safe in their care. Albus had wrapped a thin blanket around Scorpius' shoulders when he'd started to nod off and had wrapped his arms around Scorpius' shoulders in the process, kissing his cheek as everyone had laughed at one of Orion's jokes.</p><p>"<em> Expecto Patronum </em>," Scorpius said, and a great silvery dragon formed in front of him, beating its wings without disrupting the air, and looked to him, awaiting orders. Scorpius consulted his watch.</p><p>"Go to Dania," Scorpius said. "Tell her Albus is ill and to meet us at the Floo connection in St. Mungo's. We'll be there momentarily. She should be at the hospital now."</p><p>The dragon inclined its massive, shimmering head and flew away, disappearing through a bookcase and through the wall to deliver the message.</p><p>Scorpius looked down to Albus and swallowed hard. His heavy breathing seemed so labored, and though he was unconscious he looked pained, his eyelids twitching every few seconds.</p><p>Time was limited, Scorpius knew, so he slid one arm under Albus' back and the other around his knees. He could feel more rough patches of skin through the thin fabric of Albus' t-shirt. Albus was the stronger of them – it wasn't a secret – and he was more dense and heavy by virtue of that strength, but Scorpius wasn't weak. With great effort, he lifted Albus off the ground, struggling against his dead weight as he stood. He nearly dropped Albus as he got to his feet, but scrambled to adjust his weight, holding him tight as he could. Albus' head fell against Scorpius' shoulder and he let out a small, pained groan.</p><p>"It's going to be okay," Scorpius said as he started up the stairs, though he knew Albus couldn't hear him. Albus' weight made each step a struggle, and by the time Scorpius made it to the top of the stairs and to the fireplace, he was completely winded.</p><p>Scorpius stumbled over to the fireplace, his arms nearly shaking from nerves and holding Albus up, and looked down at the pot of Floo powder sitting by the fireplace. He shifted his weight and kicked it over, nudging some of the powder into the fireplace with the toe of his shoe. He kicked the powder forward until enough of it fell into the small flames.</p><p>The fireplace roared to life with bright emerald flames and Scorpius shifted Albus in his arms, making sure he was secure before stepping in, letting the flames lick up his ankles and legs. It was normally an odd sensation, but Scorpius couldn't pay much attention to it. He was too focused on his husband's unconscious form and trembling eyelids.</p><p>"St. Mungo's," Scorpius directed toward the flames, and he held tight to Albus as they spun through the network and stepped out at the St. Mungo's main intake connection.</p><p>A few witches and wizards were milling about in the lobby, some appearing to be in various degrees of discomfort, but Scorpius ignored all of them. Dania stood in the center of the atrium in her lime green robes, her dark hair twisted back into a knot at the nape of her neck.</p><p>"Good Lord," she said as she spotted them, her eyes wide as she spotted Albus. Her fear was telling - not much frightened Dania when it came to medical issues. She was a natural healer – something Scorpius had appreciated many times when she'd healed his kids' cuts and scrapes with a smile and impeccable bedside manner.</p><p>But something about the sight of Albus had rattled her. She rushed over and reached out to touch him, but thought better of it and reached deep inside her robes as she called to a group of nurses.</p><p>"I need a stretcher," Dania called to them. "Quickly."</p><p>Dania withdrew a pair of sturdy dragon hide gloves and pulled them on, securing them around her wrists before taking Albus by the jaw and turning his head to get a better look at the discolored skin of his neck.</p><p>"Damn," Dania muttered.</p><p>"What?" Scorpius asked, truly panicking. His arms began to shake under Albus' weight as three nurses came over, a floating stretcher suspended between them. One of them – an older man with a bald head and long, black beard – saw Albus' neck and gasped.</p><p>"What is it?" Scorpius demanded. Another of the nurses brought the stretcher in front of Scorpius and the other, very gently, levitated Albus from Scorpius' arms. Scorpius watched Albus' limp arms fall to his sides and his head roll back, exposing his neck. He looked so vulnerable and Scorpius felt so helpless that his hands, now empty, dropped to his sides.</p><p>"I wasn't there," he muttered to no one in particular. Dania, who had bent over Albus to inspect him while the others backed away warily, looked up at him.</p><p>"Did you touch his skin?" Dania asked.</p><p>"Why does that matter?" Scorpius asked. "Where is Lexi?"</p><p>"Did you touch his skin?" Dania demanded, straightening at Albus' side. Her brown eyes were wide and fearful, and Scorpius looked down at Albus. It didn't occur to him that if Albus <em> and </em> Lexi were ill that whatever they had would be contagious.</p><p>"I might have," Scorpius said. "I'm not sure. I didn't touch the… whatever that was."</p><p>"But you did carry him from your house," Dania said, drawing her wand. She looked to the nurses. "Take him to the Intensive Care Unit and put him in a containment room," she said. "Do not touch him."</p><p>Scorpius moved to follow them, but Dania blocked his path, careful not to lay her hands on him.</p><p>"Scorpius, you need to come with me," she said.</p><p>"What?" Scorpius asked. It was unfathomable that she would stop him from going with his husband. Dania had known them since long before their wedding, and had been a constant in Scorpius' life since he was seventeen. He'd been elated when she'd married Draco and loved that she'd become a part of his family and had given him his younger brother, Orion, who Scorpius thought was the seventh most wonderful kid in the world.</p><p>But now, Scorpius looked down at his step mother, and her drawn wand, and in that moment he hated her more than he'd ever hated anyone because she stood between him and Albus and Lexi, and that was unacceptable.</p><p>"Get out of my way," Scorpius said, his voice low and threatening.</p><p>"Scorpius, you need to listen –"</p><p>"I need to go with Albus and I need to see Lexi."</p><p>"Lexi is in the children's Intensive Care Unit. I'd just found out she was here less than an hour before you contacted me. I've already seen her."</p><p>"And?"</p><p>"I'll tell you if you'll walk with me to the quarantine room."</p><p>"<em> Quarantine </em>?"</p><p>"It's a new strain of dragon pox," Dania explained. "There's been a few cases reported at the preserve in Germany and it's been isolated there, but Albus and Lexi are the first cases reported here and we're trying to stop it from spreading and we don't know how this particular strain spreads yet."</p><p>"Dragon pox?" Scorpius asked. He could feel the color drain from his face as memories of his Grandmother Narcissa and Grandfather Lucius' funeral came forward. They'd been killed by a freak strain of dragon pox when he was young after traveling abroad. The pox had worked quickly and efficiently, shutting down their respiratory systems, infecting their kidneys before causing a grotesque rash. Since that new strain hadn't presented immediately with a rash, the healers hadn't known how to treat it until it was too late.</p><p>Scorpius thought inexplicably of his father leaning over Narcissa's casket. Astoria had held Scorpius' hand tight and kept him back, giving Draco a private moment to say goodbye to his mother.</p><p>'<em> At least it spared her lovely face </em>,' Draco had said, looking down at his mother tenderly. It was the first time Scorpius had seen his father cry.</p><p>"Lexi is being kept unconscious," Dania said. "She was in a lot of pain, so we're keeping her comfortable while we treat her. She's starting to respond to the potions. We gave her a pain potion and as soon as I'm sure Albus can handle it I'll administer -"</p><p>"No," Scorpius said quickly. "As much as I hate it, don't give Albus anything for the pain. Not until he can decide for himself."</p><p>"Scorpius, I don't think you understand," Dania said. "The amount of pain he's in will slow his healing."</p><p>Scorpius remembered Albus at eighteen, struggling to function and irritable when he'd struggled with pain potions. The addiction had been brief but intense, followed by a rough detoxing and Albus refusing to touch anything beyond muggle Tylenol for years. It was a secret they'd kept even then, and Scorpius had no intention of discussing it now without Albus' consent.</p><p>"The minimum," Scorpius decided. "There are… reasons."</p><p>Dania gave him a wary look, but she must have known that Scorpius wouldn't be moved. He could see the concern on her face — the worry and fear — and the gravity of the situation settled on Scorpius all at once. Scorpius stumbled back, grappling for the row of chairs that lined the Floo connections, but Dania reached out and grabbed a fistful of Scorpius' shirt, pulling him upright roughly. She held him at arm's length – a presumably safe distance.</p><p>"Keep it together," Dania said through gritted teeth. "You're no help to Albus or Lexi if you have a breakdown."</p><p>"I'm no help to them out here either," Scorpius retorted. "Let me see them."</p><p>"I can't do that," she said. "You know I can't. You need to be quarantined for at least twelve hours."</p><p>"Twelve hours?" Scorpius hissed. "You want me to stay away from my ill daughter whom I haven't seen and my ill husband for <em> twelve hours </em>? You must be mad."</p><p>"Most strains are passed via skin-to-skin contact," Dania explained. "If you touched him then you could pass a changed strain back to him and then he <em> will </em> die, Scorpius. That's a certainty."</p><p>"Is it a possibility that he'll die now?" Scorpius asked, alarmed. "He saw all the children. All of them –"</p><p>"Come with me, Scorpius," Dania said, her eyes pleading. It was then that he realized several members of the hospital staff and several others had formed a wary gallery of spectators. They were standing at a distance, watching him with fear in their eyes. He could see several healers he recognized as close colleagues of Dania's, and two of them were slowly reaching towards their pockets. Scorpius realized they were reaching for their wands. He made eye contact with one of them – an even-keeled man whose name he knew to be Travis – and his hand froze an inch from the exposed handle of his wand.</p><p>"<em> Please </em>. For everyone's safety."</p><p>Scorpius looked back to Dania, aware of the silence that now surrounded him.</p><p>"Okay," he consented, going against every instinct he possessed. The last thing he wanted to do was be quarantined away from Lexi and Albus. It was difficult to internalize that Lexi was ill since he hadn't seen her – difficult to think of her being somewhere in this vast hospital, unconscious and alone.</p><p><em> At least she won't remember being alone </em>, Scorpius thought. It was of little comfort as he allowed Dania to lead him away.</p>
