    <p>Albus had hated snow for as long as he could remember. This was a fact well known to anyone who’d had to spend more than a day with him over winter. He didn’t hate winter itself, though; there were few things he loved more than curling up beside a roaring fire with a good book and a mug of hot chocolate, while the wind hurled sleet and snow against the windows. But when it settled on the ground and started impacting his ability to go about his day as normal—that he could do without. <em> That’s </em> the snow he hated.</p><p>Unfortunately, no one else seemed to understand this hatred for the white fluffy stuff. No matter how many times he plainly stated his dislike, people always tried to get him to go outside to ‘play’ in it. This was why he’d groaned internally when he noticed that the snow which had been threatening to fall over Hogwarts for the past week had gone and done just that overnight. He could tell from the excited chatter in the corridors and the Great Hall that it was only a matter of time before someone tried to rope him into a snowball fight or something equally as pointless.</p><p>At least, he was safe with Scorpius. <em> He </em> would never make Albus go outside in this awful weather.</p><p>Snowy days like this made him really regret his choice of school. They made him wish he’d campaigned harder to get sent to Castelobruxo; he’d never have to suffer snow in the rainforest. He glanced up at the ceiling to torture himself because yes, of course, it was still shitting snow. He exhaled heavily and stabbed a sausage on the platter before him, sending several of its brother sausages skidding onto the table.</p><p>“Who piddled in your pumpkin juice?” Scorpius asked, sparing a disapproving look for the mess Albus had created. He pursed his lips, then pointedly vanished the ‘soiled’ food with a wave of his wand and a muttered spell.</p><p>“What?” Albus said, frowning at his friend in confusion.</p><p>“You’ve been in a grump since you woke up,” Scorpius said, “and I’ve finally decided to be a good friend and ask you what’s wrong, in the vain hope that I can shake you out of it.”</p><p>Albus rolled his eyes. “It’s snowing. You know I hate snow,” he said sullenly. Why did people never remember this?</p><p>“Still? I rather thought you might have grown out of that by now. Seriously, what has snow ever done to you?”</p><p>“It’s cold. It’s wet. It makes people act weird. It’s basically the weather version of New Year’s Eve; everyone feels like they have to have fun so they force it. I hate being forced to have fun.”</p><p>“Of course. Merlin forbid you ever allow yourself to have fun. Why are we even friends?” Scorpius said, shaking his head fondly. His lips curled into a smirk and his eyes lit up. “Come on you, up! I have an idea.”</p><p>Albus shrunk back into his seat. He didn’t like it when Scorpius got that look on his face; it almost always meant he was about to suggest something he knew Albus wouldn’t like. “Why? Where are we going?” he asked hesitantly.</p><p>“It’s high time you learnt some appreciation for the best weather Mother Nature has to offer. We’re going to build a snowman!” Scorpius exclaimed. He stood up, abandoning his half-eaten bacon sandwich, and tugged on Albus’ sleeve to get him moving. </p><p>Albus groaned, causing several other Slytherins to turn and look at him. “Fuck off, are we,” he groused. “You can do what you like, but I’m staying here.” To emphasise his point, he folded his arms across his chest and scowled.</p><p>“Albuuuus,” Scorpius whined, now tugging lightly on a straggly lock of Albus’ hair since his sleeves were tucked away. “Come oooon. It’ll be fun!”</p><p>“It’s not fun. Reading is fun. Gobstones is fun. Blowing things up is fun. Even homework can be fun sometimes. Getting cold and wet for absolutely no good reason is <em> not </em>fun.”</p><p>“Fine, suit yourself, Mr Grumpyboots, but mark my words, I <em> will </em> get you to enjoy the snow before this winter is over.”</p><p>“Then I look forward to proving you wrong.”</p><p>Scorpius paused, a calculating look crossing his face. “Are you issuing a challenge?” he asked, his voice suddenly softer—more dangerous.</p><p>Albus cursed inwardly. “What? No! I was—”</p><p>“Nope, sorry, no excuses, there was definitely a challenge issued,” Scorpius said, cutting off Albus’ feeble protest. They both knew Scorpius had won this battle already, so everything else was just for show. Albus needed Scorpius to know he wasn’t a complete pushover, and Scorpius, good friend that he was, let him have it.</p><p>“Scorp! You can’t—” Albus tried.</p><p>“Nope, not listening.” Scorpius stuck his fingers in his ears before dropping his hands down to his hips. “Well? Are you coming?”</p><p>“I’ve already told you, I’ve absolutely no intention of freezing my bollocks off in pursuit of this so-called ‘fun’,” Albus stated, in what was his last-ditch attempt to escape Scorpius’ scheme.</p><p>“So, let me get this right—what you’re saying is that you concede defeat?” Scorpius asked carefully, as if speaking to a child.</p><p>“No! I—”</p><p>“Well, what are you waiting for then? If you’re going to prove me wrong, you’re actually going to have to come outside, so step lively!”</p><p>Albus narrowed his eyes and pouted. “I hate you,” he muttered, pushing himself up from the table and stomping after his friend.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The snow was still falling heavily when Albus gingerly stepped out from under the protection of the entrance hall. He grimaced as he surveyed the grounds, now completely white apart from the dark shapes of students foolish enough to be outside. He couldn’t understand why everyone went so silly for snow; it just made it ten times harder to go anywhere or get anything done—and on top of that, it was so cold!</p><p>A group of excitable first or second years barrelled out of the entrance hall and darted into the grounds. Albus glowered as he watched them, mentally preparing himself for the coming activity. He tugged his woollen hat further down his forehead and pulled his scarf more tightly around his face so only his eyes were visible. Scorpius bustled past him on the steps, chattering brightly about the snow family he’d made with his father when they were holidaying in the Alps a few years past. It was hard to stay grumpy in the presence of someone so consistently cheerful, but Albus was going to give it his best shot.</p><p>Scorpius stopped when he realised Albus wasn’t following him. “Come on, you miserable old sod. Don’t try to fight it; embrace the joy of snow!” He twirled around in a circle, his hands and face raised to the sky. Albus curled up his lip in disgust, tempted to turn around and head back inside. He’d never been very good at resisting his friend’s plans, however—no matter how ridiculous and far-fetched they were. With a final, longing glance over his shoulder at the castle, Albus stomped after his friend, regretting every decision that had brought him to this point.</p><p>“This looks as good a place as any,” Scorpius announced after about ten minutes of struggling through snow that was already halfway to his knees. He’d stopped at a seemingly random point in the middle of the grounds, which looked no different from anywhere else. Albus spun around to get his bearings since the snow cover had obscured all obvious landmarks—another reason to hate snow, he thought bitterly—and worked out that they were about halfway between the castle and the Forbidden Forest.</p><p>“I thought we’d start small—ease you into things gently,” Scorpius said, bringing Albus’ attention back to him.</p><p>“Couldn’t we have stayed closer to the school for this?” Albus asked, eyeing the dark, threatening shadow of the forest that loomed over them, the blanket of snow failing to lessen its oppressiveness.</p><p>“Of course not. The snow here is better, less trampled. We want nothing but the best for our snowmen.”</p><p>“Snowmen? Plural?”</p><p>“Yes! I thought we could make one each. They don’t have to be big, maybe about yea high,” he said, holding his palm out flat at chest height. “That way, you can hone your snowman-building skills before we try out more complex projects.”</p><p>Albus groaned. “Isn’t there a spell we could use for this? I’m sure Uncle George showed me something once—”</p><p>“Sacrilege!” Scorpius cried, clutching his chest dramatically. “Where’s the fun in that? This has to be done the proper, Muggle way or not at all!”</p><p>Albus muttered under his breath and stuffed his gloved hands into the pockets of his robe—the thickest winter robe he’d been able to find. He watched as Scorpius threw himself at the task, scraping snow together and shaping a large lump that he proceeded to roll through the snow. Albus watched it steadily increased in size. A smile tugged at the corners of his mouth despite his best efforts to remain miserable. Scorpius looked so serious, frowning in concentration, the tip of his tongue poking out from between his lips. It was ridiculously cute how earnestly he was taking the task.</p><p>“You know, you’ll enjoy yourself much more if you actually try building something,” Scorpius called from beside his now waist-high snowball.</p><p>Albus blinked and shook himself, suddenly conscious that he’d been staring at Scorpius for at least five minutes. His face wasn’t cold anymore, though, what with the ferocity of his sudden blush.</p><p>“I wouldn’t be so sure about that,” he grumbled, but he started moving anyway. Scorpius looked like he was beginning to get exasperated with him, and the last thing Albus wanted to do was upset him. Having fun in the snow obviously meant a lot to him—for whatever reason—so Albus knew the least he could do was try and not be too much of a dick about it.</p><p>He bent down and started gathering the snow into a heap. He decided to try out a different tactic to the one Scorpius was using, which looked like it involved significantly more effort than he was willing to put in. He scraped, scooped, and kicked the snow into a rough mound, then patted it into more of a ‘body’ shape. It was a bit like building a sandcastle—another activity he wasn’t overly fond of—only with cold, numb, fingers.</p><p>After fifteen minutes of gathering and compacting snow into something vaguely snowman-shaped, Albus checked on Scorpius’ progress. He knew his meagre attempt would be no match for the beast Scorpius was creating, but he was curious to see just how pitiful his snow-blob was by comparison. He hadn’t been expecting Scorpius to be looking right back at him though, a peculiar expression on his face. At some point, Scorpius had unwound his scarf from his face, letting it hang loosely around his neck. His white-blond hair stuck out in tufts from under his hat, where he’d pushed it back off his forehead. His face was flushed from the cold—or possibly from the exertion of pushing around a huge snowball—but he looked happy. A soft, fond smile played at his lips that Albus couldn’t help but mirror.</p><p><em> Maybe Scorpius was right </em> , Albus thought as he added a bit more snow to the top of his blob. This playing-with-snow thing wasn’t <em> so </em> bad—though he would never admit that out loud. Okay, so his fingers were numb, and his cheeks felt raw, but Scorpius looked so happy—</p><p>“Heads up!” someone yelled, the sound coming from somewhere on the left, and startling Albus enough that he almost fell face-first into his snowman.</p><p>He whipped his head around, searching for the source of the sound, and was just in time to witness a large snowball—more like a snow-beachball, he thought abstractedly—whizz past his face. It was close enough that he felt a gust of extra-chilled air on his exposed skin. The air crackled with magic, which must have been used to propel the monstrosity towards them. He let out the breath he’d been holding, relieved at narrowly avoiding a face full of snow, but then heard a muffled ‘<em> Ooof </em>’ from the direction of where Scorpius had been.</p><p>“What the—!?” Scorpius spluttered, brushing the snow off his face. He was completely covered in snow but, other than wiping his face, made no attempt to shake it off; he stood stock-still, wide-eyed in disbelief at the now-headless snowman in front of him. “My snowman! Who...? What…? No!” He fell to his knees, and Albus watched helplessly as he tried to reshape the head from the lumps of compacted snow that littered the ground.</p><p>“Oh my god, I’m so sorry, Scorp!” cried a familiar voice. As the figure approached, Albus immediately recognised the culprit.</p><p>“Rose! What the fuck!?” he snapped, angry, protective feelings surging through him at his best friend’s forlorn expression. His face stung from the cold and wet; despite this, he threw her his harshest, most outraged glare.</p><p>“It was an accident! I was aiming for Jasper, but he ducked—and, well—then it was too late to stop it, so…” She trailed off as Albus continued to glare. Scorpius’ whimpers in the background only fuelled his rage. Rose stiffened and folded her arms across her chest, sticking her nose in the air. She looked so much like her mum in that moment that Albus almost quailed. “In my defence,” she said, “I had no idea you guys were here. Why couldn’t you go play in the snow by the Quidditch pitch like the rest of the school?”</p><p>Icy snow-melt dribbled from Albus’ sodden hat and down his neck He tugged it off his head and scrunched the useless thing in his fist. “Why couldn’t you just watch where you throw shit,” he retorted.</p><p>“Oh, for crying out loud, it’s only snow! Get over it, Albus,” said Rose.</p><p>“Rose! How lovely to see you,” Scorpius said weakly, having given up on repairing his snowman while Albus and Rose were facing off against each other.</p><p>Albus turned his glare on his best friend. Scorpius’ fascination-slash-crush-slash-creepy obsession with Rose had tailed off since their early years at Hogwarts, but he still had a weird soft spot when it came to her. Most of the time, it was funny to watch—if slightly uncomfortable—but at times like these, when Scorpius had a legitimate reason to be pissed off, it was just plain annoying.</p><p>“So sorry, Scorpius,” Rose apologized, reaching out to place a sympathetic hand on his arm. Albus bristled. “I know a spell that should fix it right up—I can show you, if you like?”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it. It’s fine. We were doing it the muggle way, so it would be cheating to use a spell.” With a frown, Scorpius glanced back at his decapitated snowman.</p><p>Albus’ heart clenched at the sight of Scorpius’ dejected face. “I don’t mind,” he said. “Let Rose fix it—it’s not your fault she fucked it up.” He hissed when Rose punched him, hard, in the shoulder.</p><p>“Twat. I’d offer to fix yours, too, but it looks beyond help,” she snapped.</p><p>“No, no, it’s okay. I’m getting a bit cold now anyway, and I expect Al is eager to get indoors,” Scorpius said, smiling faintly. He turned away from them and wandered towards the school without a backward glance.</p><p>“Nice one, Rose,” Albus spat once Scorpius was out of earshot.</p><p>“Oh, piss off. It’s not like I did it on purpose.”</p><p>“Yeah? Where is Jasper, exactly? Funny how he’s nowhere to be seen.”</p><p>“He ran off when he saw your face,” she retorted, poking out her tongue in the childish way she always did when they argued, although something in her tone suggested she wasn’t being completely honest. “What are you even doing out here? You hate this stuff.”</p><p>“Mind your own business,” he growled, well and truly fed up now. His face hurt, his fingers and toes were numb, and his feet were wet. Why had he ever let Scorpius convince him to come outside when he could have been<em> inside </em>, dry and warm, with a good book or his sketch pad?</p><p>He turned and followed Scorpius’ tracks, leaving Rose to fume behind him.</p><p>Albus expected he would be receiving an owl from his mum or dad—maybe even Auntie Hermione, if he was really lucky—in the not too distant future suggesting he and Rose ‘talk things out’ or some rubbish like that. They hadn’t always been so at odds—in fact, they’d been quite close growing up—but recently their differences seemed to be magnified, and it was harder and harder to find common ground. Of course, the blame for this, every time Rose wrote home and told on him (or gossipped to Lily or Hugo or any of their other cousins, who then wrote home and told on him instead) always seemed to land squarely on his shoulders. Apparently, he was supposed to ‘<em> cheer up </em> ’ and ‘ <em> try harder to be friendly. </em>’ That Scorpius was often on her side, too, was an added kick in the gut.</p><p>“Scorp! Scorpius! Wait up!” Albus called as he drew nearer to his friend, walking as fast as he could through the snow drifts. “Hi,” he said breathlessly once he’d caught up. Scorpius’ bright green woolly hat was almost completely white from the snow, which still hadn’t let up.</p><p>Scorpius glanced at him out of the corner of his eye and sighed, slowing down his pace. “I’m sorry, Al. I suppose this wasn’t a great example of snow-fun.”</p><p>“Hey, it wasn’t your fault. Rose is the one who ruined everything.”</p><p>“Yes, but it was an accident, and she apologised. Is she cross at me?”</p><p>“What? Why?”</p><p>“I thought I might have been a bit short with her, and I stormed off in a huff.”</p><p>“This was you storming off in a huff?” Albus couldn’t help the laughter that bubbled up in his throat.</p><p>“Oh, hush. <em> Yes, </em> that was me storming off. What are you saying?”</p><p>“Aww, Scorp. You couldn’t storm off if your life depended on it. You’re literally, like, the nicest person on the planet. And don’t worry about Rose. If she’s mad at anyone, it’s me. I’m who the snowball was meant for.”</p><p>“No! Really? Are you sure? Did she say that?”</p><p>“Of course not, but I’ve known her my whole life. I know when she’s pretending she didn’t intentionally throw something at my head.”</p><p>“I’m sure she didn’t mean anything by it,” Scorpius replied diplomatically, and Albus had to stop himself rolling his eyes at Scorpius’ unending ability to give everyone the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>“Well, I guess at least we’ve proved that snow is shit,” Albus said, eager to steer the conversation away from Rose before Scorpius could talk about how perfectly wonderful she was.</p><p>“Not in the slightest! I’m nowhere near giving up yet. Now, come on,” he said, looping an arm through Albus’, “let’s get you warm and dry and huddled in front of the fire with a hot chocolate and a classic <em> Martin Miggs </em> comic.”</p><p>Albus shook his head and laughed—it was hard not to when faced with such boundless enthusiasm and unconditional friendship. He truly would be lost without Scorpius, even if he did get weirdly fixated on the strangest things and always ended up dragging Albus along with his madness.</p>
