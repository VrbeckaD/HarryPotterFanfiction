</p><p align="left">Before Hogwarts, Jongdae was my best friend and for a while he was my first love. We grew up together. Our parents were best friends… Until we were accepted into Hogwarts and I was sorted into Ravenclaw. Both of our families were pure bloods and the idea of being anything other than Slytherin was unacceptable. However, when I was sorted, my parents weren’t disappointed, but Jongdae and his family… They were disgusted. </p><p align="left">“You must not be pure-blooded enough” his mom would scoff. After that, my parents cut off contact with his family as did I after constant teasing from him and his house members. </p><p align="left">I looked forward to the summers and breaks I could take without Hogwarts and Jongdae around. I typically spent my time at my muggle library. Not really to study, but like clockwork, every time I was there, I would receive a little post it note. One that made my heart skip a beat and let a smile grace my face. I didn’t know who it was and everytime I tried to find out, I was too late. The notes would appear on my books or laptop whenever I took a break and walked off or when I went to search for a new break or when I took a not so willing nap and I’d normally wake up to a little post it on fresh coffee. </p><p align="left">This little note message has been going on for the last four years and I wanted to find out who my secret admirer was. So, I headed to a set of bookshelves. I peeked around the corner, biting my lip, and waited for my secret messenger to show themselves.  </p><p align="left">“What are you doing, idiot?”</p><p align="left">Groaning, I slowly turned to see Jongdae, “Why are you here?”</p><p align="left">He waved a book in front of my face, “It’s a library. Obviously I’m here to read.” </p><p align="left">I rolled my eyes and straightened myself up. Clearing my throat, I walked past him going further down the aisle silently cursing that he had to be in the library the same day as me. </p><p align="left">I waited, counting to 120 as I glanced at the bookcases, before making my way back to my spot in the library. Eyes widened as I noticed a coffee mug with a cute message attached on top. I smiled as I took the post it in my hand. I looked around hoping to see who it was, but only an elderly man and Jongdae were in my area, much to my dismay.</p><hr/><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">It was the last day of the break and I was bound and determined to find out who my post it note messenger was. I was preparing to leave, took a quick trip to the bathroom, and returned to another post it. I packed away my things letting out an annoyed sighed. I missed my post it messenger AGAIN! I pulled out a paper and pen and jotted a quick ‘Thank you’. I placed the paper on the table and walked away.</p><p align="left">Something made me stop and check as I made my way to the exit. I would be away for a few more months and knowing I’d have to wait longer made me on edge. I went back towards the table when I noticed an all too familiar figure standing at the table I was at holding the note I wrote. I watched as Jongdae’s lips grew into a large smile as he studied the words then tucked the paper in his wallet. He turned my way and I darted back behind the bookshelf. I rushed out of the library and turned the corner before I let out a breath. My heart pounded against my chest and my hand raked through my hair. </p><p align="left">How was I supposed to act now that I knew my post it messenger was Jongdae. Jongdae, the boy who broke my heart. None of it made any sense…</p>
