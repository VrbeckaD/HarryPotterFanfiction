    <p>
  <span>Once upon a time a splintered man tried to kill a child, a babe of 15 months. This babe was named Hadrian “Harry” James Potter. He was a powerful child, bearing an ability which his family had not shown for generations.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The splintered man, appeared outside a small cozy home in Godric’s Hollow. His magic danced around him in amusement, reveling in the euphoric moments just before a kill. A voice interrupted him before he could act however.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Peter is that you?” Movement could be heard as scrambling behind the door. The voice was a charismatic smooth British accent, slightly deep but still peppy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Peter you shouldn’t…” the door slammed open and the voice fell. The man with messy brown hair gaped for a fraction of a second, refusing to process who it was. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Crucio”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Horrifying screams could be heard echoing throughout the house, ones that would keep anyone with even half a soul up a night. The man with messy hair convulsed on the floor, turning into a soft shake as the spell ended. Tear streaks and puffy eyes turned the face pitiful, the face characteristic of a weakling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lily! Get Harry and get out of here!” He screamed with his last ounce of strength, face weak and voice rough. A whisper of words, a blinding green light, a soft click heard in the distance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The stair creaked as he ascended as the man headed towards a room bursting with magic, a song that sung in harmony with the wind the sea and the stars, a warm feeling that soothed and calmed. Quiet but strong underneath, misleading in it’s actions but true to it’s heart. The magic run a delicate gold, the song whispering messages of love, forgiveness, and motherhood. He knew it was meant to calm him, temper his anger, make him blissfully ignorant and receptive to its goals. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His soul sang out to it, desiring to be content and cared for, a song of guilt and tears. Weeping for anyone to save him, to love him like his mother was too weak to do. The mind overwhelmed the soul, bringing up memories of betrayal, hurt, and Tom Riddle. The insidious green of magic of the splintered man overwhelmed that of the pretty song, suffocating it. It was even graceful in death wasn’t it, fading away like a pleasant dream.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please spare him! Anyone, anything but Harry. Please!” The red woman pleaded as he stepped into doorway</span>
</p><p><span>He asked her to step away three times before he snapped. Magic poured from his eyes and hands, ripping, mauling, killing, tearing apart the red woman until she was naught but a pile of twitchy meat on the floor. Not once did she scream, the only sound is magic dancing around her shaking form. A hummed sad tone jumped and mourned, playing at nonexistent heartstrings. The organs still move and breathe, she’s still alive. The splintered man is feared for a reason after all, the soul can never escape her meat prison under his watch.</span> <b>Serves Her Right.</b></p><p>
  <span>The babe awakens at the sound of a cold heartless laugh, tilting his head to see the newcomer. His soft green eyes inquisitive as only a small child can be. A vivid green light fills his eyes, but before it reaches him he is gone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His mother’s song burns left in the room to death as fearful anger. The soul and her magic furious at the loss of a special child. The tension builds quickly, coiling tightly  as a spring, but all at once it explodes. The pure burst of magic rips the souls from their mortal shells, banishing them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The song ends on a sad note as the babe reappears in the room as he’d never left. The room is dark, soothing the infant to sleep. The only evidence anything happened is the vivid green of the child’s eyes, luminescent in the dark, enchanting, so so very pretty.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Two men enter the room while the babe is asleep. The first passed quickly, sobbing at the mess of blood on the floor, ignoring the sleeping child with the baby face of his most hated. The second man comes to retrieve the young one, bringing him out of the house as he plans in a haze of anger. Giving him to another man who cared for all who took him away. The child is left outside the door of the rotten flower alone.</span>

  <span>--Petunia POV--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s time to get the milk today, as it is every Sunday morning at 10am on Privet Drive. Later I will go to the store as I do every Sunday morning at 11am on Privet Drive, I will then prepare lunch for my lovely boys as I do every Sunday afternoon at 1pm on Privet Drive. I will plant my flowers as I do every Sunday afternoon at 3pm on Privet Drive. I will then clean the house as I do every Sunday night at 6pm on Privet Drive. I will sing my baby to sleep as I do every night at 8pm on Privet Drive. A perfect day, as always.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>My plans are ruined though as I stumble over a basket on my doorstep, really though who is so rude as to leave a package on the walkway. I should really get this mailman fired, I didn’t order a package.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But it’s a baby there, I pick him up, reading the note left on his small chest.</span>
</p><p><em><span>Dear Mr. and Mrs. Dursley</span></em> <em><span>Number 4 Privet Drive</span></em></p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I am sad to inform you that your lovely sister Lily and her husband have tragically died last night being murdered by Voldemort. As the boy’s closest relatives you are entrusted with his care until he attends Hogwarts school of magic at age 11.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>

  <em>
    <span>Albus Percival Wulfric Brian </span>
  </em>

    <em>Dumbledore</em>
  </b>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course, my freak sister got herself murdered and left her freak son behind. This won’t be that bad though, If I just raise him along my Dudders he’ll be normal there’s no way they’d expect me to raise a monster. I take the boy in my arms and bring him inside, at the sudden movement his eyes open.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Those eyes are such a vivid green, swirling as I look at them. </span>
  <b>Inhuman </b>
  <span>The dark of the edge of his iris mixing with the inner </span>
  <b>demon</b>
  <span>. It’s eyes look like a sea of poison </span>
  <b>baby Lucifer</b>
  <span>. If I look any longer I’ll be enveloped in their aura, I know it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In a move of fear I stuff him in the cupboard under the stairs near the entrance of the house. I can’t let him infect anyone else to freakishness with those, at least not my family. Oh god we have to take care of him what do I do? He’ll kill me I can see it in his eyes. Please god, devil, anyone savemesavemesavemesaveme.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Petunia stop fussing over there and make me breakfast woman!” I sigh and push myself up even though I continue to tremble wildly and make my way over to the kitchen. “Woman calm your emotions. I can’t have some crying slut as a wife you know that right Petunia?” I flinch at that. I'm not the slut my sister is, she isn’t fooling anyone fucking her husband’s friends.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“V-v-v-vernon” I take another breath as I push my hand on the table to steady myself, “My bitch sister died and left us with a little freak” I sputter out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where is he”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Under the stairs, in the cupboard”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Keep him there”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wh-why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t have my son becoming a freak can I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No vernon”</span>
