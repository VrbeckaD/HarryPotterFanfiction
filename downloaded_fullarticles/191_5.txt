          <div class="userstuff"><p>Rose wants to throw up.</p><p>
  <em>Little Lily Luna and Scorpius Malfoy. </em>
</p><p>The thought would be laughable if it wasn't for the thousands of daggers that pierce her heart every time the image of her little cousin snogging her longtime crush in a cozy cafe flashes through her mind.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene I'm begging of you please don't take my man </strong>
</p><p>She could beg. Plead for mercy on her hands and knees.</p><p>Lily would drop Scorpius on the spot and help Rose to her feet like the shining poster girl for all things good she is. And that's the worst part.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene Please don't take him just because you can </strong>
</p><p>Lily has the entire world wrapped around her little finger. Guys are lining up to sneak a look at her.</p><p>So why's she need Rose's boy?</p><p align="center">
  <strong>Your beauty is beyond compare With flaming locks of auburn hair With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green Your smile is like a breath of spring Your voice is soft like summer rain And I cannot compete with you Jolene </strong>
</p><p>Lily; bright, fun loving Lily, with a head of shining crimson curls, glowing porcelain skin and striking sapphire eyes.</p><p>Rose can't compete. She'll never be enchantingly gorgeous like Victoire and Dominique, or classically beautiful like Molly and Lucy, or plain lovely like Roxanne.</p><p>Merlin knows she can't compete with Lily Luna Potter.</p><p>It's a fact of her life.</p><p>She doesn't have wit or charm or beauty. She has brains.</p><p>It's never bothered her so much.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>He talks about you in his sleep And there's nothing I can do to keep From crying when he calls your name Jolene </strong>
</p><p>Scorpius Malfoy has never been Rose's to have, and it's never hit her so hard.</p><p>She's had so, so many opportunities.</p><p>So many times she'd rolled her eyes at Albus's urging looks as Malfoy walked right past her, so many times she'd chosen to sit with a vaguely familiar Hufflepuff over an awkward conversation with the boy she likes.</p><p>And now there was nothing she could do as the perfect girl stole her prefect man.</p><p>Fate was knocking on her door with an eviction notice for a heart she'd never had a place in.</p><p>It felt like a punch in the gut.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>And I can easily understand How you could easily take my man But you don't know what he means to me Jolene </strong>
</p><p>What's Scorpius to Lily?</p><p>A rebound for a year of broom closet make outs with Frankie Longbottom? A chance to prove she's just as Gryffindorishly prefect as her last name and the gleaming badges she wears on her school uniform would imply?</p><p>Of all the boys in the world, she had to choose Scorpius Malfoy. Arrogant, rude Scorpius; Rose's man.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>I had to have this talk with you, My happiness depends on you And whatever you decide to do Jolene </strong>
</p><p>She can’t tell Lily. She could never look the girl she's viewed as a little sister in the eye ask her to break up with the first boy who doesn’t treat her like pretty face paired with a lucky name for the sake of a crush Rose never even bothered to act on.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene I'm begging of you please don't take my man Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene Please don't take him even though you can Jolene, Jolene </strong>
</p><p>In the end, Lily would win. Because Lily Luna Potter was beautiful and bold and Rose Granger-Weasley was neither.</p></div>
