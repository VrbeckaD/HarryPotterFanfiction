  <b>Monday 14th December, 1981 </b>
</p>
<p>Agatha Fawley stood outside of the Ministry of Magic finishing the last bits of her lunch. She was a tall middle aged witch with short buzzed hair and ebony skin, wrapped in a large yellow tartan scarf. Agatha closed her eyes to the sunshine and rested her head against the stone behind her. Though her coat was charmed for warmth it didn’t do much to fight off London’s unseasonably cold winter. Even in the bitter weather, she’d rather take a few more minutes to absorb the calm Muggle world of London than step back into the chaos of the Ministry. </p>
<p>The city was bustling in front of her, muggles tightly bundled in scarves and hats walking quickly to get out of slush left over that morning’s snow. Agatha envied them, she longed for a break from this war. Just to forget for a moment. Guilt hit her in the stomach, she was one of the lucky ones. How many witches and wizards had they lost to You-Know-Who? She’d already placed dozens of orphaned children for the Ministry, with more waiting. Resolute, Agatha opened her eyes and pulled an ornate silver pocket watch from inside of her coat. </p>
<p>The watch had a number of funny and complicated looking dials on its side. At the center of its face were hands indicating the time and on the outer rings listed her corresponding daily agenda. She rolled the first dial and read through what she had scheduled the rest of her day. Her next appointment would be one of the most important in her career. Agatha had twenty minutes to get to Madam Amelia Bones’ office. She snapped the watch shut with a sigh, her breath fogging in front of her, and headed back into the remains of London’s once great wizarding government. </p>
<p>Since the death of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named on Halloween The Ministry had been running on high alert. All entrances and exits shut down except for the main gateway at Whitehall. No Floo or Apparition, everyone had to enter by foot. Several Aurors stationed at the security desk to observe all wand registrations and verifications. </p>
<p>Agatha entered to find an exhausted looking Dawlish behind the desk. He was a young Auror, though he didn’t look it, with circles under his eyes and a familiar haunted expression. Agatha knew that look well, she’d seen it reflected back in her bathroom mirror many mornings, it was a hard one to shake. </p>
<p>“Back already Fawley?” He smiled up at Agatha. </p>
<p>“Oh, you know it.” </p>
<p>She set her briefcase on the desk, Dawlish tapped it with his wand causing blue smoke to emitted from the case. He seemed satisfied with the color. </p>
<p>“What are you doing here alone?” Agatha asked looking at the empty chairs next to him. </p>
<p>“They needed extra Aurors for the Lestrange trial and Macmillan ran to the loo.” The Auror rolled his eyes, clearly unimpressed with his companion. </p>
<p>Agatha couldn’t blame him, working this position without backup was dangerous, “Don’t let Moody find out.” </p>
<p>Dawlish raised his hands, “You don’t have to tell me. I warned him!” Clearly put out, he carried on, “I wish I was working the courtrooms today. I wanna watch them send that bitch to Azkaban.” </p>
<p>“At least you got to work the Black proceedings.”</p>
<p>His eyes lit up, “Oh I’ll never forget them!”</p>
<p>Agatha couldn’t help but be jealous, the trials of Sirius Black had been groundbreaking at the Ministry. The day after You-Know-Who was vanquished Sirius had been dragged into custody for blowing up a city block to hunt down Peter Pettigrew, killing 12 muggles in the process. </p>
<p>Once on trial, it was clear that his crimes were even more sinister. Dumbledore himself revealed that Sirius had turned traitor to the Order of the Phoenix, spying for You-Know-Who. He confirmed that it was Sirius who betrayed James and Lily Potter as their secret keeper. The once beloved member of the Order of the Phoenix was on trial as a top ranking Death Eater. Every living member of the Wizengamot had been in attendance. The trials went on for hours and right at the end, when it looked like Black would be sentenced to life in Azkaban, Remus Lupin burst into the courtroom with a rat which was revealed to be Pettigrew. </p>
<p>After that truths came pouring out: Sirius, James, and Peter’s unregistered Animagus forms. Remus Lupin’s status as an unregistered werewolf. The mistrust within the Order of the Phoenix resulting in Peter becoming secret keeper instead of Sirius. Peter’s ultimate betrayal. The fall of You-Know-Who. The list was quite impressive, needless to say, Rita Skeeter had a field day reporting the whole affair. Agatha devoured every article, it was so rare to get any kind of silver lining from the Daily Prophet. Sirius Black was pronounced innocent and Peter Pettigrew sent to Azkaban. </p>
<p>“Yeah, none of us will be forgetting that anytime soon.” Agatha replied, shaking the memory away and looking back at Dawlish. </p>
<p>“Speaking of, aren’t you meeting with Sirius Black today?” He held up a sheet of parchment, “I’ve got him on the list, due any minute.” </p>
<p>“Like I said, <em> I’m late </em>.” She spoke pointedly, not answering his question.  </p>
<p>Dawlish raised his eyebrows but stayed silent. He was waiting for her to produce her wand for inspection. Embarrassed, Agatha realized her wand was in her briefcase. She’d been reading over paperwork during lunch and tossed it in absentmindedly. Ministry protocol was to keep it within arms reach at all times. Bristling, she opened the case. </p>
<p>“Agatha, really? You <em> know </em> you should keep it on your person in times like these.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m aware.” Agatha exhaled shifting through her notes. </p>
<p>Dawlish noted the file on top labeled HARRY JAMES POTTER, he gave her a knowing look. Agatha snapped the case shut and handed her wand over to be weighed. Then with Dawlish’s approval she cast a Patronus to confirm it was indeed her wand. </p>
<p>Agatha’s ghostly hummingbird zoomed around the room. It was a small comfort; she let its warmth wash over her for just a moment before turning to the Auror and pocketing her wand exaggeratedly. He nodded approval, she tried not to roll her eyes. As little as she fancied being told off by a 20 year old Auror, he was right. In times like these... </p>
<p>“Good luck with the Potter case!” Dawlish called as Agatha rounded the corner and entered the first elevator. </p>
<p>Annoyed, she pressed the knob a bit harder than necessary. Agatha was hoping to keep Harry’s custody case as low profile as possible. But now she’d be surprised if it wasn’t all over the Ministry by dinner. The Auror Department were such gossips. </p>
<p>The elevator halted announcing, “Level 1: Minister for Magic and Support Staff.” The doors slid open and several owls swooped in, perching themselves importantly on their designated railings. Witches and wizards zipped past the elevator with stacks of parchment, but no one boarded. The owls hooted impatiently as the doors closed, Agatha noticed that one had already shit on the elevator floor. </p>
<p>“Bloody interdepartmental memos.” Agatha complained, vanishing the droppings, as the elevator resumed its descent. “There has to be a better way, even the muggles have those telephones.” </p>
<p>“Level 2: Department of Magical Law Enforcement” The elevator announced as the doors opened again. Agatha exited with two owls flying past her into the Auror Headquarters. One clipped her head with its wing, she stared daggers after it. </p>
<p>The Auror Department was abnormally vacant, rows and rows of empty Auror office cubicles. She realized everyone must be watching the Lestrange case. After what Beletrix had done to the Longbottoms, the entire Department was personally invested in her punishment. </p>
<p>Agatha understood, the state of Frank and Alice was devastating. She'd seen them yesterday at St. Mungo’s while granting Ministry approval for their son to be placed with Frank’s mother. Alice had always felt so strong to Agatha, good natured and unflappable, the kind of Auror who put you fully at ease. Agatha felt her heart ache, at least she was able to place Neville with family. </p>
<p>Looking over the vacant desks she wondered how many would remain empty once all the Aurors returned from court. Had they cleared out the Longbottoms desks yet? Would a young new Auror be filling it soon? Agatha turned away from the thought and headed south down the hallway to the Wizengamot Administration Services. </p>
<p>The department was eerily just as empty. Amelia Bones must be the only council member not in attendance. They’d agreed on the time of this meeting last week and it showed the utmost respect for Madam Bones to honor it. Agatha was relieved to have such a stable Wizengamot member prosiding on this case, she knew it would be tricky. It didn’t hurt that Amelia was also a dear friend. </p>
<p>Agatha walked down the row of offices. Most of the secretaries were scarfing down lunches at their desks surrounded by stacks of paperwork, a few nodded at her as she passed. She waved back politely. </p>
<p>Before the war Agatha had rarely visited the Wizengamot Administration. As head of the Ministry’s Social Services she spent most of her time monitoring the health and welfare of underaged muggle-born children. </p>
<p>The Ministry’s codes surrounding wizarding household privacy were considerably more strict. It was nearly impossible to know if a wizarding family was abusive. She’d spent her early career advocating to change such laws, but to no avail. The wealthy pure blood families were famously secretive and well connected in the Ministry. </p>
<p>In the post-war chaos privacy laws had become more flexible, Agatha found herself with the ability to investigate wizarding households before placement. She knew it wouldn’t last long. So she was working night and day to make sure <em> all </em> her cases were placed in healthy and stable households. In doing so, she’d recently become very familiar with this department and the Wizengamot Council Members. </p>
<p>Madam Amelia Bones being high ranking, was located towards the end of the row. Agatha approached, surprised to find her secretary’s desk empty. She hesitantly knocked on Amelia’s tall oak door. </p>
<p>“Come in!” Amelia boomed from inside. Agatha swung the door open to see the severe looking witch sitting behind her large desk covered in parchment and magical instruments. She had several wide leafed plants on the wall behind her, Agatha noticed a floating orb bathing the greenery in delicate sunlight. Rich red walls and oak trim, the office was as lovely as its owner. </p>
<p>“Agatha!” Amelia smiled, taking the monocle out of her right eye while setting down what she’d been reading. “Glad you beat the boys here.”</p>
<p>“Boys? Is Sirius Black bringing representation?”</p>
<p>“No. Albus Dumbledore will be joining the proceedings.” </p>
<p>“Oh joy.” Agatha dead panned, then she cracked up. “I can <em> not </em> believe you just called Albus Dumbledore a <em> boy </em>.”</p>
<p>Amelia laughed with her, but the light did not last in her eyes. “It’s good to see you Agatha. I wish it was under better circumstances.”</p>
<p>Agatha’s heart fell, “Me too.” </p>
<p>“I’ve been reading over your report on the Dursley’s.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got Harry’s full case file here.” Agatha cracked open her briefcase to retrieve it. </p>
<p>“What a monstrous pair of muggles,” Amelia indicated the report on her desk. “I can’t believe Albus left him there. Blood protection or not.” </p>
<p>“Don’t get me started.” Agatha handed over Harry’s file. “I’ll do my best to be civil with him once proceedings begin.” </p>
<p>Amelia tucked her monocle back into her eye and opened the thick case file. </p>
<p>“What do you have on your plate after this?” She asked Agatha while scanning the pages in front of her. Without looking up, Amelia summoned a comfortable looking chair for her to sit in. </p>
<p>Agatha felt the warmth from their previous conversation disappear. “The Bletchley household.” She stated as simply as possible sitting down. </p>
<p>That got Amelia’s attention, “The Greyback case?” The two witches locked eyes. </p>
<p>“Yes, poor child slaughtered his own parents.” To Agatha’s surprise she felt she might cry. “What do you say to a child who’s been dealt a hand like that?” </p>
<p>Amelia nodded sympathetically as Agatha continued, “Every time I think it can’t get worse..” </p>
<p>The room fell into silence. </p>
<p>“I’m in awe of you Agatha. I don’t think I tell you enough.” Amelia pulled a handkerchief out of her robes and handed it across the desk to Agatha. </p>
<p>Amelia continued, “I have it easy down here. Catching Death Eaters and sending them away. <em> You </em> are caring for our most vulnerable, our future. Don’t you dare think your work has gone unmissed. I know how many muggle-born children you saved during the Dark Lord’s height.”</p>
<p>Agatha winced at his name. “It will never feel like enough Amelia. Not while Tavin Bletchley is waiting for me and Harry Potter is stuck with those wretched muggles.” </p>
<p>“Well, luckily, <em> that’s </em> something we can fix.”</p>
<p>Agatha caught Amelia’s eyes, they held the look for a moment. Then a voice filled the room. “Madam Bones?” Amelia’s secretary must have returned from lunch. </p>
<p>“Yes?” </p>
<p>“HeadMaster Dumbledore and Sirius Black are here for your 1pm.” </p>
<p>Amelia smiled and whispered conspiratorially at Agatha, “Can you tell my secretary is fresh from Hogwarts?” </p>
<p>Agatha snorted, rolling her eyes at Amelia, even though she could feel butterflies building in her stomach. All these years later and she still got nervous before case proceedings. She wanted the best for Harry Potter and she was going to get it. </p>
<p>“Send them in!” Amelia boomed, suddenly her presence felt huge and authoritative. Agatha saw her step into the persona of Madam Amelia Susan Bones, high member of the Wizengamot and rumored to soon be Head of Magical Law Enforcement.  </p>
<p>“We better summon more chairs.” Agatha stated, pulling out her wand. </p>
<p>~*~*~</p>

<p>
  <b>Later that afternoon in Wimbledon… </b>
</p>
<p>Sirius Black stared at the door of Remus Lupin’s flat. The lease was in his name, but the two of them had lived in it together since Hogwarts. It should feel like their flat. It used to. But things had been different since Halloween...since Lily and James… they weren’t really seeing or hearing each other. It wasn’t home anymore. The meeting with Madam Bones had gone well, Sirius was hopeful that he could meet the Department’s guidelines and get Harry back. That felt possible. He was much more afraid of opening the door in front of him. He and Moony had been avoiding this conversation (or any <em> real </em> conversation) since they’d been released from Ministry custody. Sirius pressed his forehead against the cold wooden door and fished around in his coat pocket for the keys. </p>
<p>Remus was in the living room, balled up in a large armchair reading. Sirius sighed at Moony’s soft curls and somber face. A ribbon of scars ran across his nose and mouth, making him all the more handsome. For someone so tall it was remarkable how small he could make himself in a chair. At Sirius’ entrance Remus slowly closed his book and looked up. </p>
<p>“Well?” He raised his eyebrows, clearly nervous. </p>
<p>“Fair witch that Amelia Bones, she sided against Dumbledore and Petunia.” </p>
<p>“What does that mean? Did she side with you?”</p>
<p>Sirius stripped off his coat and scarf, hanging them on their wooden rack. “Department of Social Services gave me a list of guidelines. I’ll have to pass an inspection with them first.” Sirius started untying his laces “If I pass, Bones said I’ll get him.”</p>
<p>“Are the guidelines written down?” </p>
<p>Sirius nodded, “Here.” He pulled the folded paper from his pocket and handed it to Remus. The room fell into silence as he looked over the list. It wasn’t a comfortable silence. Sirius used to love silences between him and Moony. They could spend whole afternoons content with each other's presence, no need for words. These days every quiet moment between them was painful, full of regret and hurt, and the silences felt never ending. Sirius raked his hands through his hair, it could use a wash. He was suddenly agitated. </p>
<p>Remus looked up, “So are you going to buy property for you two?” </p>
<p>Sirius noted the absence of Remus in the statement, it stung. “No. I inherited Grimmauld Place. I’d like to renovate it, we’ll need the existing protection charms to pass.” Sirius nodded at the list in Moony’s hand. </p>
<p>Remus looked taken aback. “Your parent’s home?” </p>
<p>“You and I used to talk about moving back into London proper?” </p>
<p>“Is this you asking me to go with you?” </p>
<p>“Why wouldn’t you go with me?”</p>
<p>“Why would I? So we can continue to ignore each other in London proper?” </p>
<p>“Are you saying you want to abandon Harry?”</p>
<p>Remus inhaled sharply, his eyes furious. But when he spoke his voice was quiet, “I will obviously help you with Harry Potter in any way that you need. I will be there for him until I die.” The word “die” hit Sirius somewhere painful. </p>
<p>“Then why are you acting like you won’t be living with us?” Sirius replied, fighting the urge to shout. </p>
<p>“Because we haven’t felt like a couple in months, Sirius! We’ve just been living <em> around </em> each other.” Remus barked back, finally raising his voice. </p>
<p>“Well we’re both grieving, aren’t we?” It felt so good to finally voice his feelings, Sirius didn’t want to stop. “We’ve been together four years and you want to throw that away over a couple of months of not talking?”</p>
<p>Remus stood up, looking down at Sirius, “How could you?”</p>
<p>Confused, Sirius threw his hands in the air, “How could I what??” </p>
<p>“Think <em> I </em>was the spy!” Remus roared, finally losing his cool. </p>
<p>Sirius didn’t know how to respond, they hadn’t spoken about that night yet. Suddenly it hurt too much to think straight. Remus charged on. “I loved you. I forgave you a million times over in our relationship! You were my life Sirius, my future. How could you trust Peter over ME??” </p>
<p>Sirius covered his face with his hands backing away from Remus. His heart started pounding loudly in his ears. He felt the back of his legs touch the couch and sank into the cushions, tucking himself into a ball, “Why do you keep using past tense?” </p>
<p>Remus carried on not listening. “How could I have lost you like that?-"</p>
<p>Sirius knew he needed to focus on what Remus was saying, that it was important. But he couldn’t get his heart to slow down. </p>
<p>"-How could you possibly think I would betray Lily? Or James??” </p>
<p>At the mention of James, Sirius dragged his face up through his hands to look at Remus. “We didn’t think you were the spy.”</p>
<p>Remus froze, “What?” </p>
<p>Sirius closed his eyes to take a few slow breaths. When his pulse calmed he opened them and repeated, “We didn’t think you were the spy.” </p>
<p>“Then why didn’t you tell me about Peter becoming secret keeper?” Remus was completely guarded. Sirius hadn’t received a look like that from Moony in years. “You would only do that if you thought I was the spy.”</p>
<p>“J-James-“ Sirius paused, choking on his best friend’s name. “James wanted it to be a secret from Dumbledore. He knew how important Dumbledore is to you, we didn’t want you to have to lie to him.”  </p>
<p>“Really?” Remus asked in a tiny voice. Sirius nodded and just like that Moony’s guard dropped, he looked down at Sirius utterly wrecked. </p>
<p>“Moony? Have you been thinking that since Halloween? That we-“ But Sirius didn’t need to finish the sentence it was clear from Remus’ face that was exactly what he’d thought. </p>
<p>Sirius’ heart broke, he reached up to take Moony’s hand, “I would have eventually told you about Peter. You know how rubbish I am with secrets. But he didn’t give me much time, did he?” Remus knelt in front of Sirius on the floor. He was so lanky, they could meet eye to eye. Sirius continued, “Before he betrayed us...not even a week.”</p>
<p>“James and Lily didn’t think I was the spy?” </p>
<p>“Of course not love. I promise.” At that Remus’ face crumpled. Sirius let go of his hand to reach out and hold him. Threading his fingers in Remus’ hair and rubbing little circles into his scalp. Sirius carried on explaining, “James was nervous about Dumbledore knowing <em> everything </em> in the Order since there was a spy. I thought it was such a good idea. We thought we were keeping everyone safe.” Tears spilled out onto Sirius’s cheeks, after weeks of avoiding this, he was suddenly crushed with guilt and heartbreak. “You should have been— anyone else should have been— I can’t believe Peter—“ Sirius broke down sobbing before he could complete his thought. Remus wrapped his arms around Sirius, tucking his head into his shoulder and cried with him. For the first time since losing their best friends, Moony and Padfoot finally made space for each other.</p>
