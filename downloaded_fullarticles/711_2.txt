    <p>
  <span>Hermione feels an invisible hand on the back of her neck, forcing her angry glare to redirect to the muddy ground at her feet. The same hand presses down between her shoulder blades at a hissed command to kneel. She gratefully obeys, her weary legs giving way with little conscious thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look at me, girl.”  The hand tilts her chin up, and her murderous rage is transformed - transfigured - into a paralysing fear. Red eyes that are almost luminous in the darkness fix onto hers. “You were the Potter brat’s Mudblood whore,” It’s not quite a question, but she answers anyway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was his </span>
  <em>
    <span>friend!</span>
  </em>
  <span>” What is meant to be a defiant shout comes out a desperate whimper, her voice cracking painfully on the second word. And, in place of the crippling rage she had imagined inciting he - it - has the temerity to laugh. A laugh that sounds surprisingly rich, and deep, and </span>
  <em>
    <span>sane. </span>
  </em>
  <span>It is nothing like the high-pitched cackle that has haunted her nightmares for months, for years.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She is the reason Potter survived as long as he did.” Her mind reels at the familiar voice that speaks from behind her, but the invisible hand holds her chin still, and she cannot move to glimpse the face of yet another who haunts her night-terrors.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then by all means, kill her and be done with it,” an impatient drawl - is there no one here whose mere name does </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>inspire fear? “She is a brainless Mudblood; there is no place for her here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So brainless that I beat your son in every exam we ever took,” Hermione spits, eliciting a muttered curse, and another laugh from </span>
  <em>
    <span>him</span>
  </em>
  <span> - it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what spirit there is there too. I am almost tempted to keep her for myself.” The hint of amusement in his - it’s - tone doesn’t prevent Hermione from shuddering. “More the pity she’s already promised.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My lord, if you would rather-” offers that memorable voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no, I could not take her from you. How could I deny this gift to my most faithful?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, my lord.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You will keep her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will service her to your will, with your blessing, my lord.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She may prove difficult to turn,”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But not impossible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As you wish.” The hand holding her chin disappears, and she spins wildly, only to freeze, inches from the familiar face that matches the familiar voice. “Any words to say to your new paramour, my faithful?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I believe I told you, Miss Granger, that you need not fear losing your life in this war.” And then what has been said sinks into her mind, and she collapses, caught in the arms of a man she despises, a man who she is sure will keep his word. She will break.</span>
