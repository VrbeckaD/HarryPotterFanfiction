    <p>Gellert just needs the obscurus so he can get out of there. Although he has to take down two trained aurors: the older Scamander and Goldstein, a maledictus and control Credence, in case he’s uncooperative.</p>
<p>It’ll be easy, even without Rosier’s help or the circle of blue fire around him.</p>
<p>“Hi, Gellert.”</p>
<p>Frowning, the dark lord turns his head around to find the owner of that sweet voice; he’s sure he has heard it before, although not like that, not in such intimate tone… He’s almost sure the person has just purred his name.</p>
<p>His eyes find a pair of green ones. And Gellert finally realizes the younger Scamander has decided to join them.</p>
<p>Newton.</p>
<p>But his first impression of Newton had him thinking about the wizard like a very shy, lovely and sweet creature.</p>
<p>“You were going to have some fun without me?” Newton pouts, staring into Gellert’s eyes while biting his bottom lip.</p>
<p>That’s… quite something, very distracting if he’s being honest. He didn’t know that boy could turn his voice into honey; a warm and sweet sound that makes Gellert feel suddenly very much hungry.</p>
<p>“Newt, what do you think you’re doing?” That’s the magizoologist’s brother, obviously worried, although Gellert can’t actually tell what he’s doing at the moment because he can’t take his eyes off Newton.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the magizoologist ignores the auror completely. He takes a step closer and Gellert is so delighted he can have a better look; the blue fire that’s keeping them apart makes that pale, freckled skin look absolutely delicious.</p>
<p>“So… I was thinking, maybe we can have a private conversation, just the two of us,” as he speaks, eyes glued to Gellert’s, Newton Scamander takes off his coat, scarf and starts undoing his bow tie… It’s almost mesmerizing. A private conversation sounds really like something Gellert would want right now.</p>
<p>“Sir, you shouldn’t trust him,” Vinda Rosier whispers behind him, which is absolutely ridiculous because of course Gellert doesn’t trust him, he’s just looking at him…</p>
<p>“To talk about what?” The dark lord smirks, mind thinking about all the possibilities.</p>
<p>Newt grins back, rolling up his sleeves while doing so; Gellert can see all those beautiful scars over his arms.</p>
<p>“I would actually like to make a deal,” Newton gets closer and Gellert has the impulse to take down the protection spell he has put around him and Rosier. “To talk about Credence.”</p>
<p>A part of him recognizes the trap, but the rest of him just wants to keep hearing that wizard talking.</p>
<p>“We need the obscurus,” Rosier reminds him.</p>
<p>Newton moves around the circle and Gellert’s eyes follow him.</p>
<p>“Do you really? Do you need him?” He tilts his head in a gesture Gellert shouldn’t find adorable, but he does anyway. “You’re a very powerful and clever wizard, Gellert. I bet you can get whatever you want, without any help. So why don’t you leave Credence alone?”</p>
<p>He knows what’s going on, he can see beyond Newton’s sweet words, because he’s a seducer too and yet he doesn’t want to listen to that voice in his head, the one that’s warning him against the magizoologist.</p>
<p>“I bet you could just take me if you wanted, right now, in front of everyone,” Newton bats his eyelashes at him. He has such a mischievous smirk on his face that’s doing things to Gellert. “I’d love for you to do that.”</p>
<p>“Fuck!” He gasps, heat spreading through his entire body. The older Scamander looks horrified and shocked and yet Gellert doesn’t care, he doesn’t care about anyone besides Newton.</p>
<p>“It’s a trap, my lord–”</p>
<p>“Not now, Rosier!” He knows Newton just wants him to let go of Credence, to stop following him and yet that doesn’t make his desire vanish. It doesn’t stop him from wanting Newton for himself. “What kind of deal?”</p>
<p>Gellert has to stop himself from groaning when he watches Newton’s tongue, licking his lips, before smiling playfully. There are so many promises behind those be eyes, Gellert starts getting desperate.</p>
<p>He’s starving.</p>
<p>“What about an exchange?” He says and Gellert knows already where this is all going and he just loves it. “If you forget about Credence you can have me.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he blurts out, voice deep, eyes dark with desire. Vinda Rosier looks almost horrified.</p>
<p>But just then, the aurors of the Ministry arrive and Gellert is being forced to apparate away with Rosier. Before he vanishes completely though, he watches Newton winking at him.</p>
<p>And he wants him even more.</p>
<p>It was a trap, but he already knew that.</p>
<p>“He’s going to be mine,” he declares. He accepted Newton Scamander’s deal and now he has to keep his end of the bargain. Gellert will make sure he does.</p>
