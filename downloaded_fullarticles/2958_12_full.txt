    <p>A huge thanks to my wonderful wife, Bicky Monster, for beta reading this for me. ^_^ I am not making any promises about keeping up with this one, but I needed a Harry/Blaise story to focus on when I wasn’t in the mood for Unbreakable, or one of my several other fics that I have in the works. <br/>That being said, I do know where I’m going with this fic, so hopefully it won’t take me three years to finish this. But we shall see. </p>
<p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>Harry still couldn't believe it. Umbridge was gone, carried off into the woods by the centaurs. Even as the news spread through the school, Harry was alone in Snape’s office, still waiting to find out what was going to happen now. </p>
<p>The other members of the DA, who had been caught as well, had been sent back to their common rooms, leaving Harry at the mercy of Snape. The potions master had not been impressed with Harry’s escape from Umbridge, or the fate that the toad-faced woman had been subjected to. As a result, Harry had been magically stuck to a chair, his wand removed from his person, to keep him from running off to the ministry to find his Godfather. </p>
<p>Harry jerked himself bodily again, a futile attempt to free himself, after having been stuck for nearly an hour now. He was unable to move his arms or legs either, and Harry had no choice but to sit and wait for Snape to return, with no idea of when that might be. </p>
<p>Harry felt helpless, sitting there, just waiting for something to happen. He had been set to storm off to the ministry and free his Godfather from Voldemort. However, Snape had come after them, stopped them, before Harry had even had the chance to argue about who could or could not come with him to the ministry. </p>
<p>A sound from behind him had Harry turning his head in an attempt to glare at Snape, assuming the potions master would be the only one coming in there. </p>
<p>“Let me out of here!” Harry yelled, jerking his body again. “You can’t keep me here! Thanks to you, Sirius is probably dead by now!”</p>
<p>“Now that hurts,” came the reply, and Harry stopped struggling, turning his head once more to try and look at the owner of that familiar voice.</p>
<p>“Blaise?” Harry asked. </p>
<p>“Well, I’m definitely not Professor Snape, though if you’d rather, I can leave and you can continue waiting here for him,” Blaise said, and Harry heard the door close once again. </p>
<p>“No! Blaise wait!” Harry jerked so violently that the chair tipped over backwards, with him still stuck to it. He blinked up at his boyfriend, who standing over him. </p>
<p>“Did you really think I would just leave you here?” Blaise questioned. </p>
<p>Harry continued to stare at Blaise, and was annoyed when he felt the stringing in his eyes as tears started forming there, though he held them back, refusing to cry in front of Blaise. “He left me here,” Harry said, his throat feeling tight. “He left, and Sirius…”</p>
<p>Blaise’s smirk faded and he knelt down next to Harry, gently lifting the chair back up. “I’m sure your Godfather is fine.”</p>
<p>“He’s not, you don’t understand, Voldemort had him, he was at the ministry, and Snape HATES him,” Harry said. “Please, Blaise, let me out of here.”</p>
<p>“I can’t do that,” Blaise said sadly. “Not until you listen to me.”</p>
<p>“I’m DONE listening, Blaise! I’ve waited all year for people to tell me something about what’s been going on, and, because I’ve taken things into my own hands, now is when people want me to sit and listen to them!” Harry snapped. “I need to make sure my Godfather is safe! You know how important he is to me.”</p>
<p>“I know, but you have to listen to me, Harry,” Blaise said firmly. “I’m still not convinced that this ‘vision’ you had was truly real, that’s why I came to get Snape to stop you from leaving.”</p>
<p>“You did what?” Harry demanded, his voice taking on an icy tone. </p>
<p>Blaise sighed and shifted some things on the desk. “I did this for your own good, Harry.”</p>
<p>“Fuck you!” Harry yelled. </p>
<p>“I don’t care if you hate me, Harry, but I am not letting you go. And I am not apologising for possibly saving your life!” Blaise snapped back. </p>
<p>Harry continued glaring at Blaise, anger boiling inside him as he tried to think of something, anything to say. Images of Sirius being tortured kept coming to mind, his Godfather screaming in pain, and Voldemort’s high pitched laugh echoing through is his head. Angry tears started falling and Harry turned away from Blaise as best he could. </p>
<p>The two of them continued sitting in silence for some time, Harry refused to talk, or even look at Blaise right now. He was convinced that because of the other boy’s interference, Sirius was now dead, and Harry hadn’t been allowed a chance to stop it. Though try as he might, Harry couldn’t muster up enough anger toward Blaise to truly hate him. </p>
<p>“Why?” Harry finally asked, only sparing a glance toward Blaise. The tan boy was still sitting on Snape’s desk, poking at some of the papers waiting to be graded. </p>
<p>“Why what, Harry? Why did I tell Snape? Why am I leaving you in here?” Blaise asked, looking at Harry. </p>
<p>“Why did you tell Snape,” Harry clarified. </p>
<p>“Because if I had tried to stop you, you or one of the others would have hexed me and gone to the Ministry anyway,” Blaise answered. </p>
<p>“Sirius is in trouble,” Harry said, still convinced that his Godfather was at the ministry with Voldemort. </p>
<p>Blaise sighed, setting the paper he had been looking at aside, turning his full attention toward Harry. “What makes you so convinced that he was really there?”</p>
<p>“I saw it! My scar hurt, and I saw him there!” Harry said. </p>
<p>“How did he get there?” Blaise asked. </p>
<p>“I don’t know! Voldemort probably took him there,” Harry replied, feeling his anger rising again. “I didn’t imagine this, Blaise, I know what I saw, and I know what it meant.”</p>
<p>“I’m still not sure what to think about this whole connection to You-Know-Who, but I do know one thing, the Dark Lord isn’t just about to go walking into the Ministry with Sirius Black,” Blaise pointed out. “And I’ve been thinking, if you can see things through this connection, what is stopping him from seeing things as well?” </p>
<p>Harry bit his lip and looked away again. “I know it was real,” Harry insisted. </p>
<p>“Would it be so bad if you were actually wrong for once?” Blaise asked in exasperation. </p>
<p>“Why are you so insistent that I am?” Harry demanded. </p>
<p>“Because it doesn’t make sense! There is no way that You-Know-Who would just wander into the ministry with a convicted killer! No matter how far Fudge has his head up his own arse; even he can’t overlook something like that!” Blaise snapped, his own temper rising. “Merlin, Harry, how stupid can you be about this?”</p>
<p>Harry fell silent, it felt as if something was squeezing painfully in his chest. Lowering his head, he hid the fresh tears that were forming. It wasn’t the first time that he and Blaise had argued; they had been friends since the beginning of the Tri-Wizard tournament in fourth year, and sometimes disagreed, but Harry had never thought Blaise would think him stupid. </p>
<p>The silence stretched on too long, however Harry refused to look at Blaise. He was hurt, and angry, and though he refused to really acknowledge it, he was scared. Blaise let out a small sigh and Harry heard him move closer. </p>
<p>“If I let you off the chair, are you going to make a run for it?” Blaise asked wearily.</p>
<p>“Go away,” Harry replied. </p>
<p>“Harry…”</p>
<p>“GO AWAY!” Harry shouted, glaring up at Blaise. </p>
<p>“Fine,” Blaise snapped, taking out his wand and waving it at the chair that Harry was sitting in, releasing him. “Go running off and get killed for all I care, though before you do, I should thank you for reminding me why I never liked Gryffindors. Selfish lot you are, never thinking about who you might hurt when you rush off into danger. If that’s something that ever changes, you know where to find me,” Blaise said.</p>
<p>Harry watched as the other teen left the room, slamming the door behind him. </p>
<p>“I’m not selfish,” Harry said to the empty room, ignoring the cough that came from a nearby portrait. </p>
<p>His scar had long since stopped hurting, there wasn’t even a slight burning anymore, and the only thing Harry could deduce from that was that Voldemort must have succeeded; Sirius was dead. The pain in his chest grew the more he thought about the possibility of not having Sirius anymore. Wiping at his eyes, clearing away the angry tears that were still forming there, Harry left Snape’s office, and made the long trek back up to Gryffindor tower. </p>
<p>--------------x</p>
<p>Harry wasn’t sure when he had fallen asleep, though he was sure he couldn’t have been sleeping long, the headache, and heavy eyelids were testament to that. However, Ron was making it very difficult for him to continue sleeping, shaking his shoulder instantly. </p>
<p>“Harry, mate, get up, you’ve gotta see this!” Ron said.</p>
<p>“Can’t it wait?” Harry grumbled, rolling over and turning his back toward Ron. </p>
<p>“Harry.” Hermione’s voice reached his ears and Harry groaned. </p>
<p>“I’m not going to classes today, Hermione,” Harry said. </p>
<p>“Classes were cancelled, but this isn’t about that. Harry, you’ve got to read this! It’s about Sirius!” Hermione exclaimed, letting out a shout when Harry suddenly sat up in bed and stared at his two friends. </p>
<p>“What?” Harry asked, suddenly wide awake. </p>
<p>“Here, in this morning’s prophet,” Hermione said, handing it over quickly, while Ron handed Harry his glasses.</p>
<p>Harry took both things offered, shoving his glasses on his face and staring down at the front page of the prophet, his Godfather’s familiar face grinning back at him. </p>
<p>“You-Know-Who returns! Sirius Black innocent!” were the big bold letters that Harry stared at. He let that news slowly sink into his tired brain before he continued reading. </p>
<p>“It has long been believed that Sirius Black, former Auror, had finally shown his true colors and lived up to his family’s name, following You-Know-Who and becoming his most loyal follower. However, after a break in at the Ministry late last night (details on page five), it has been discovered that Sirius Black is not the murderer we believed him to be. After being cleared of all charges, the former convict was sent to Saint Mungo's for unknown treatment.”</p>
<p>Harry stopped reading, looking up at Ron and Hermione, waiting for one of them to tell him it was a mistake, that he was dreaming, that this paper couldn't possibly be real. However, the only thing he saw was a wide grin from Ron, and a tearful smile from Hermione. </p>
<p>“He’s alive…” Harry tried not to sound hopeful, knowing the prophet had printed false stories before, but the pressure that had been sitting in his chest since the previous night seemed to lessen. </p>
<p>“Course he’s alive, mate,” Ron said. “Why wouldn’t he-oof.” Ron was cut off by a sharp elbow from Hermione. </p>
<p>“It’s because of your vision last night, isn’t it?” Hermione questioned. </p>
<p>Harry nodded slowly. “It was so real… I was sure he was at the Ministry,” Harry said, looking back down at the newspaper. </p>
<p>“He might have been,” Hermione said, pointing to the article again. “It says here that there was a break in at the Ministry last night. But that’s all we know, there aren’t any details about what people were doing there, just names.” </p>
<p>“I have to talk to Dumbledore,” Harry said, handing the paper back to Hermione and hurrying to get out of bed. </p>
<p>“Harry, Dumbledore isn’t back yet,” Hermione said, watching as Harry scurried around the room gathering up his clothes so he could get dressed. </p>
<p>“Then McGonagall,” Harry insisted. </p>
<p>“She’s still at Saint Mungo's,” Ron added. </p>
<p>“Then who’s in charge of the school? It can’t be Umbridge, she was carried off last night,” Harry snapped.</p>
<p>“We don’t know,” Hermione admitted. “The only teachers we saw at the head table were Snape-”</p>
<p>“Snape’s back?” Harry sounded angry, and had to remind himself that Ron and Hermione didn’t know that the potions master had left Harry locked in his office. </p>
<p>“Yeah,” Ron said. ”We didn't stick around long after the morning paper showed up though.”</p>
<p> Harry sighed, sitting down on Ron’s bed. “I suppose asking either of you what happens now would be pointless,”</p>
<p>“Uh, thanks?” Ron frowned, and Harry only then realise how horrible what he said really sounded.</p>
<p>“I didn't mean it like that!” Harry said quickly, “I only meant that with Sirius being innocent, and people now knowing Voldemort is back...” Harry trailed off, ignoring the flinch from Ron at hearing Voldemort’s name. “I want to know what this means, like where I might be going this summer.”</p>
<p>“We know, Harry,” Hermione reassured him. “And you’re right, neither Ron or I can answer that for you, we just have to wait an see. I’m sure that someone will tell you something sooner or later.”</p>
<p>Harry sighed. “It’s the later part I’m worried about, or have you not noticed that people don’t really like telling me anything this year.” </p>
<p>“I’m sure there’s a good reason…” Hermione tried to say, but fell silent when Harry shot a glare at her. </p>
<p>“Sorry,” Harry mumbled, standing again. “Look, I’ll meet you two downstairs in a minute.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, okay mate,” Ron said, putting a hand on Hermione’s arm, gently pulling her from the room, leaving Harry alone with his thoughts. </p>
<p>Harry sighed and rubbed at his tired eyes before he started stripping off his pajamas; he was far too tired to be up for the day, but with the news in that mornings prophet, Harry knew there was no way he would be getting back to sleep. He wanted answers to the questions that had been piling up in his mind since he’d been woken up, and for Harry, that was more important than a few more hours of sleep. </p>
<p>Fully dressed, Harry made his way down to the common room, where Ron and Hermione were waiting for him, and together the three of them headed down to the Great Hall. </p>
<p>Harry wasn’t sure what to expect but he felt as if his whole world was balanced high off the ground, and that movement in any direction would send him toppling over. So it seemed a little surreal when they entered the Great Hall and everything was so normal. </p>
<p>Most people were just eating their breakfast, and the only people who made eye contact with him were other members of the DA. Harry got the suspicious feeling that they were looking toward him for some kind of advice, or perhaps they wanted answers of their own about what exactly had happened last night. </p>
<p>Harry, however, ignored them, his eyes trailing around the Great Hall, seeking out the only person he really wanted to see and talk to, Blaise Zabini. Though the tan boy was nowhere to be seen. Harry frowned, turning toward Ron and Hermione. </p>
<p>“You haven’t seen Blaise this morning, have you?” he questioned. </p>
<p>Ron looked up from his own breakfast and looked around the hall. “He’s not here,” he said, obviously just noticing this fact. </p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s why I asked if either of you had seen him,” Harry said. </p>
<p>“I don’t remember seeing him earlier, but we didn’t stay down here long enough to really notice who was and wasn’t here, Harry,” Hermione said apologetically. </p>
<p>“It’s fine,” Harry said, turning his attention back toward his breakfast and nibbling on some toast. </p>
<p>“You okay, mate?” Ron asked. </p>
<p>“Yeah…” Harry sighed and put his toast down. “No, actually I don’t think I am,” he admitted. “I don’t like this.”</p>
<p>“Well… there’s more stuff to eat than just toast,” Ron said. “Ow! What was that for?” Ron glared over at Hermione, who had just smacked his arm. </p>
<p>“He wasn’t talking about his breakfast, Ron,” she said with an exasperated huff. </p>
<p>“Right, I knew that,” Ron said, turning his attention back toward Harry. “So, what is it you don’t like?”</p>
<p>“Waiting!” Harry said. “I don’t like this waiting! I feel like I should be doing something, talking to someone, finding out what happened last night with Sirius at the ministry.”</p>
<p>“So, what does Blaise missing from breakfast have to do with waiting?” Ron questioned in confusion. </p>
<p>“Nothing,” Harry sighed, pushing his breakfast plate away.</p>
<p>“Sorry mate, you lost me again,” Ron admitted. </p>
<p>Harry shook his head and stood up. “Never mind, just forget it.” He didn’t feel like going into detail about the argument he had had with Blaise the night before. “I need some fresh air, I’ll catch up to you guys later.”</p>
<p>“Harry,” Hermione said worriedly.</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” Harry said, turning abruptly and hurrying from the Great Hall, not even bothering to stop when he heard someone calling his name. </p>
<p>--------------x</p>
<p>Harry sat in a seat across from Dumbledore, staring intently. He was waiting to hear what the elderly wizard might have to say, or if the man was going to explain anything about what had been going on the whole past year. Harry wanted nothing more than to bombard the Headmaster with the questions he had spent all day thinking about, while he had sat in the owlery waiting for news. He wanted to demand answers that he felt were deserved. However, as upset and irritated as Harry was, he still had enough respect for Dumbledore to wait and hear what the man had to say. </p>
<p>Dumbledore let out a long weary sigh, before he finally looked up and locked eyes with Harry. </p>
<p>“My boy, I think I owe you an apology,” Dumbledore said, and Harry blinked at him. </p>
<p>“Sir?” </p>
<p>“I suspect many things could have been avoided this year, had I given you even a moment of my time,” Dumbledore told him remorsefully. “Perhaps if I had explained what I knew to you, things might have turned out differently this year, and for that, I am sorry.” </p>
<p>Harry continued staring at him, unsure what he should say. He wanted the old man tell him exactly what he had done wrong, why he deserved the treatment he had received all year. However, now that he was sat here facing Dumbledore, could see how tired the man looked, and yet the Headmaster was still making the time to sit and talk with Harry, when Voldemort was still on the run. </p>
<p>“Whatever happened this year, sir, I don’t think it was really your fault,” Harry said. “You’ve been busy, and I’ve been told multiple times this year that I’m impatient…” </p>
<p>Dumbledore smiled. “Yes, but rightfully so. You were cut off from all information, without any explanation. So I hope you will give me the time now to explain my reasoning.”</p>
<p>Harry nodded, perhaps a little to eagerly, at the prospect of finally getting the answers he wanted. “Can I ask something first, sir?” Harry requested. </p>
<p>“Of course, my boy,” Dumbledore smiled. </p>
<p>“Um, about Sirius…” Harry trailed off, wondering if the Headmaster would even know what was happening with that. </p>
<p>Dumbledore’s smile widened slightly. “Yes, of course, I had expected that he would owl you and tell you the news himself, however I believe he must still be at Saint Mungo’s.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir, I saw that in the paper this morning,” Harry said, feeling his heart pounding in his chest from anticipation about what Dumbledore might say. “But, I was wondering,since he’s a free man now, would I really have to go back to the Dursley’s this summer?” Harry questioned, mentally bracing himself for an answer he might not like. </p>
<p>“I understand that you have been quite unhappy with your relatives,” Dumbledore said sympathetically. “I do hope you understand why I was so insistent you return to them each summer.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir,” Harry assured him. “I know it was because of the blood charm.” </p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded. “Knowing that the charm would continue keeping you safe for the next couple years, I would like to insist once again that you return to your aunt and uncle’s house.” Dumbledore said. </p>
<p>Harry nodded slowly, trying not to show his disappointment. </p>
<p>“However,”Dumbledore continued, “as Sirius is your Godfather, and your rightful guardian, it is not up to me where you spend the summer, Harry. And I believe that Sirius will be able to provide you with protection you would not have had at the Dursley’s.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Harry asked in disbelief. </p>
<p>“While I have at times kept things from you, my boy, I have never intentionally lied to you.” Dumbledore smiled. </p>
<p>Harry’s cheeks turned slightly red. “I’m sorry, sir, I didn’t meant to imply that…”</p>
<p>Dumbledore chuckled, holding up a hand. “It is quite alright. However, now that that topic has been covered, there are still a few more things I wish to discuss with you.”</p>
<p>“What other things?” Harry questioned. </p>
<p>“Professor Umbridge.”</p>
<p>-------------x</p>
<p>Harry wasn’t sure what he should be feeling as he left the Headmaster's office. It was a confusing mix of happy, hurt, anger and guilt. </p>
<p>Dumbledore had made sure to explain at great length how things could have turned out differently. That thought alone had been enough to nearly kill the buzz of happiness that had sprung up inside of Harry upon hearing that Sirius was a free man. The guilt had only mounted from there when Harry soon realised that Blaise had been right the night before. But while he now believed he did owe the Slytherin an apology, Blaise had made it very clear he would want more than a simple ‘I’m sorry’. </p>
<p>Harry let out a long sigh. Shoving his hands in his pockets, he decided to take the long way back to Gryffindor tower, hoping it would give him the time he needed to sort though his own thoughts. </p>
<p>Dumbledore had given Harry the answers he had been looking for, and more information than he had anticipated. But Harry felt dirty, like he had somehow been tainted for nearly falling into Voldemort’s trap. That the man had so easily fed into Harry’s greatest fear, caused his stomach to turn unpleasantly. </p>
<p>And everything had been for some stupid prophecy, one that he hadn’t gotten his hands on; though Dumbledore had counted as a good thing. Harry of course felt differently. After hearing the prophecy, he felt a lot of things could have been avoided if they had just given the blasted thing to Voldemort. However, at this point, it probably wouldn’t be enough; Voldemort was determined to kill him regardless of what the prophecy said. </p>
<p>Harry turned a corner. He didn’t want to spend his evening walking in circles around the castle, worrying about when Voldemort would try and kill him next. He also wanted to find Ron and Hermione, and at least give them an explanation as to why they hadn’t seen him all day. </p>
<p>Nearing the end of the corridor, and about to take the next turn through a secret passage that would lead him up to Gryffindor tower, Harry paused when he heard footsteps coming up the stairs. A moment later Blaise Zabini came into view and Harry stared at him. </p>
<p>Blaise didn’t even slow down, and only spared a glance in Harry’s direction as he passed him. Being so obviously ignored was enough to show Harry that his boyfriend was still very upset with him. Deciding he didn’t want to let things continue like this, not with the summer holidays starting soon, he hurried after the other teen. </p>
<p>“Blaise!” Harry called out. He half expected for Blaise to continue ignoring him, however was pleasantly surprised when the tan boy turned to look at him. </p>
<p>“Potter,” Blaise said as Harry came to a stop in front of him. </p>
<p>Harry tried not to flinch at the use of his surname, and instead rushed on with his apology. “I’m sorry, about last night. I should have listened to you, and Hermione, I should have at least thought about the possibility that it could have been a trap… and I’m sorry,” Harry said, searching Blaise’s features for any sign that the other teen might forgive him. </p>
<p>Blaise let out a long sigh, running a hand through his own hair as he closed his eyes for a moment. “I’m angry at you for more than just you not listening to me,” Blaise pointed out. </p>
<p>“I can’t apologise for wanting to help my Godfather,” Harry said. “I can admit that you were right though, and I can promise to try and listen to you better in the future.”</p>
<p>“Do you even understand why I’m upset with you? I don’t want you to do everything I say. Listening to what I have to say is a big step in the right direction, but it’s more than that, Harry,” Blaise said. </p>
<p>“I don’t understand, I don’t know what it was that I did, that you think is so wrong,” Harry admitted. </p>
<p>“It’s the lack of respect you have for yourself,” Blaise said. “The fact that you will willingly go rushing off to where the danger is, because you think one person is in trouble.” </p>
<p>“So you’re saying I should just stand by while other people are getting hurt? I should be like everyone else and turn away, pretend something horrible isn’t happening?” Harry snapped. </p>
<p>“That is not what I’m saying!” Blaise said in frustration. </p>
<p>“Then what ARE you saying?” Harry crossed his arms over his chest. </p>
<p>“You know what, forget it, even if I explained it to you, you obviously wouldn’t understand,” Blaise said. “Good evening, Potter,” he said, turning on his heel and beginning to walk away. However, Harry couldn’t leave it at that, not tonight. </p>
<p>“I’m not some ignorant child! You say I won’t understand, so then explain it to me! Make me understand!” Harry insisted. </p>
<p>Blaise stopped once more and turned to face Harry. “No, you’re not a ignorant child, you’re a rash idiotic Gryffindor.” </p>
<p>There were so many things that Harry wanted to say in reply to that, but he just stood there and watched as Blaise turned again and walked away. Because Harry knew that there wasn’t anything else that could be said, and if the two of them continued arguing like this, he was afraid that nothing would ever be the same between them again. </p>
<p>--------------x</p>
<p>Harry wasn’t the least bit surprised when he entered the Gryffindor common room to find a party in full swing. Standing by the entrance, Harry frowned as he tried to see if he could find a fast path through the crowd; he was in no mood to party at the moment, his brief encounter with Blaise having put him in a foul mood. </p>
<p>“Harry! There you are!” Seamus had spotted him, and before Harry could voice a protest of any kind, he was grabbed by the arm and pulled into the crowd of people. </p>
<p>“What’s the party for?” Harry questioned, frowning when someone passed him a cup of something. </p>
<p>“Celebrating the demise of Umbridge!” Dean told him. </p>
<p>“Demise?” Harry frowned. </p>
<p>“Yeah, according to someone in Ravenclaw, they saw Dumbledore go into the forest today, he came back with Umbridge and she was a mess! They must have taken her to Saint Mungo's,” Seamus said. </p>
<p>“Good riddance, if you ask me,” someone nearby said, earning a round of applause from the room. </p>
<p>Harry shook his head, sipping at his own drink and making a face at the taste. “What is this?”</p>
<p>“Firewhiskey, just for us older kids,” Seamus said. </p>
<p>“I think I’ll pass, I just want to go upstairs and go to bed right now…” Harry said, offering the cup to Seamus, and hoping to make a quick getaway. </p>
<p>“No way!” Seamus protested, pushing the cup back toward him and throwing an arm over Harry’s shoulder. “You’ve gotta learn to have some fun! Come on, I’ll introduce you to some of the older kids.”</p>
<p>“I KNOW the older kids, Seamus,” Harry said as he was pulled through the cluster of people. Harry looked around, attempting to locate Ron or Hermione, hoping that one of them would be able to save him. </p>
<p>“You can’t possibly know everyone,” Seamus rolled his eyes. </p>
<p>“I know enough of them. Come on Seamus, I just want to go upstairs, maybe find Ron and Hermione…” Harry said. </p>
<p>Seamus snorted. “I see how it is, fine, go on,” he said, letting Harry go. “Think you’re too good for us, admit it. You’ve always thought you were better than us, that’s why you made the DA; it wasn’t to help us, it was to show off.”</p>
<p>Harry frowned at Seamus, confused about where all this was coming from. “Are you okay, Seamus?” </p>
<p>“Oh, I’m just fucking perfect, though maybe that’s the reason you want to bail on us, I’m not pathetic enough for you? Won’t follow you around like some-” Seamus was cut off when Dean came up behind him and put a hand over his mouth.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Harry, I think Seamus has had a little too much to drink,” Dean said. </p>
<p>“...okay…” Harry said slowly then looked at Seamus again, wondering if it really had been the alcohol talking, or if Seamus really felt that way. Deciding he didn’t want to know, Harry excused himself, in an attempt to make it up to the dorm rooms again. </p>
<p>“Harry!” Ron’s voice called out over the group of people and Harry turned to locate his friend. The redhead squeezed passed two girls and hurried over to Harry. </p>
<p>“Hey, Ron,” Harry greeted. </p>
<p>“Where have you been all day? Hermione and I looked for you everywhere, mate.” Ron said. “Did you ever find Zabini? I saw him earlier today, mentioned that you were looking for him, he didn’t seem to happy.”</p>
<p>“We had an argument,” Harry admitted.</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare say I told you so, I’m not in the mood to hear it tonight, Ron.” Harry gave Ron a pointed glare.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t,” Ron defended himself quickly. “I was just gonna say that he IS a Slytherin, and while he is different than the lot of them, Gryffindors and Slytherins don’t get along.” </p>
<p>“Maybe you’re right,” Harry said, sipping at the drink he was still holding. “But I… I really like him, Ron. I just wish I knew what I did to make him so upset.”</p>
<p>“I dunno mate, what I do know, is you need this party, probably more than the rest of us! So at least stick around for a little while before you vanish upstairs?” Ron suggested. </p>
<p>Harry sighed. “I’m not really in the mood for a party.”</p>
<p>“All the more reason you SHOULD be down here partying,” Ron pointed out. “Now, I need to go pull Hermione away from the beverage table before she vanishes all the good stuff,” Ron said and took off again. </p>
<p>Harry wasn’t sure if it was what Ron said, or the warming in his belly from the Firewhiskey that made him stay, but either way he had to agree with Ron, he did deserve this party. Finding a mostly secluded corner, Harry sat down and watched the other people. </p>
<p>He watched as Hermione tried to fight the losing battle, trying to get rid of the alcohol that had been smuggled into the party. Or at the very least keep it away from the younger students who were trying to sneak a sip. </p>
<p>He spotted Ron on the opposite side of the room, laughing loudly at a very drunk Seamus, who apparently was finding Dean to be very attractive as he attempted to kiss his best friend. </p>
<p>Harry’s attention was taken away from the amusing scene when someone sat down next to him, holding out a full cup for him to take.  </p>
<p>“Uh… hi,” Harry said, looking at the other teen he was sure he had never spoken to before. </p>
<p>“Hi, you looked a bit bored in this corner,” he said. </p>
<p>“Sorry but, who are you?” Harry questioned. </p>
<p>“Name’s Cormac McLaggen,” the teen introduced, grinning widely. </p>
<p>“Okay, am I supposed to know you?” Harry asked. </p>
<p>Cormac laughed and shook his head. “No, probably not, I don’t usually talk to other kids outside my own year.”</p>
<p>“And what makes me the exception?” Harry still wasn’t sure why this boy had decided this was the best place in the whole room to sit, as there were plenty other empty spaces available. </p>
<p>“Like I said, you looked bored,” Cormac said, holding the cup out to Harry again. “Did you want a refill to your drink? Or am I just going to awkwardly hold this for the rest of the evening?” </p>
<p>“Thanks, but I’m not drinking any more alcohol,” Harry said. </p>
<p>“Good thing I just brought you over some punch then,” Cormac grinned, handing the cup over to Harry who took it, looking at the colored liquid inside. </p>
<p>“Oh, uh… okay, thank you then,” Harry said and sipped at the sweet tasting drink. </p>
<p>“So what do you think of the party?” Cormac questioned, seeming determined to keep some kind of conversation going between the two of them. </p>
<p>“If you’ve been to one Gryffindor party, you’ve been to them all,” Harry said. “Though this one seems to have something missing, now that Fred and George aren’t here anymore.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that is true,” Cormac agreed with a laugh. “Those two were a crazy pair.” </p>
<p>“They were brilliant,” Harry said. “I have no doubt that their joke shop will be a huge success.”</p>
<p>“A joke shop? That does seem about right for them. Some people are just born to do certain things. Like myself, I’m going to be a professional quidditch player,” Cormac said. </p>
<p>With the topic now on quidditch, conversation seemed to flow a lot easier between the two of them, and Harry found that he was truly enjoying himself, despite the fact that he originally hadn’t wanted to stay for the party. </p>
<p>Cormac left him in the corner a few times to go refill drinks, and Harry was starting to feel tired. There was even once he found himself with his head resting on Cormac’s shoulder, though he had no memory of leaning against the other teen. </p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” Harry said, jerking upright into a sitting position again. </p>
<p>“No need to be sorry, Harry.” Cormac leaned closer, brushing a few strands of hair away from Harry’s face, leaning in closer as he did. Harry saw what was coming a moment before Cormac’s lips touched his. In his shock, Harry sat there for longer than he should have before pulling away, pushing his hands against Cormac’s chest. </p>
<p>“Sorry, I uh… I can’t,” Harry said, his face red from embarrassment. </p>
<p>“Why not? Am I not your type?” Cormac frowned, looking hurt and confused. </p>
<p>“No, I mean… maybe, I don’t know you, so I can’t honestly say if you’re my type or not. But I have a boyfriend,” Harry said. </p>
<p>“That Slytherin kid?” Cormac frowned. “He’s not good enough for you, Harry, and rumor has it you two have broken up.”</p>
<p>“No, we haven’t,” Harry said firmly, and was happy when Cormac backed away. </p>
<p>“Sorry, my mistake. I thought you had been flirting with me, maybe the alcohol has been messing with my head and I was reading you wrong, it won’t happen again,” Cormac said sounding truly sincere. </p>
<p>Harry let out a long sigh and relaxed, closing his eyes to try and hold off the fuzzy feeling that had started settling into his brain. Harry blinked slowly shaking his head to try and clear away the strange feeling that seemed to be spreading. </p>
<p>“Are you okay?” Cormac asked in concern and Harry nodded, though stopped immediately as that sent another unpleasant feeling through his whole head and down his spine. </p>
<p>“I’m sorry, what?” </p>
<p>“You’re really not looking to good, maybe let’s get you up to bed,” Cormac said. </p>
<p>“Yeah, good idea.” Harry said, allowing Cormac to pull him to his feet and lead him around the edge of the room. They seemed to go unnoticed by most of the other students and made it to the stairs without being stopped. </p>
<p>“I can make it from here, thanks,” Harry said, sliding his arm away from Cormac’s and attempted to make it up the stairs on his own. </p>
<p>“Let me help you a bit more, last thing we need is for you to fall and break your skull open,” Cormac said, taking Harry’s arm again and leading him up to the fifth year dorm. </p>
<p>Harry pointed out which bed was his and Cormac helped him over, and even offered to get Harry’s pyjamas for him. </p>
<p>“No, really, you’ve done enough, thank you. I’m just going to sleep this off I think,” Harry said, and it wasn’t until he tried to scoot himself back further onto his own bed that he realised something was seriously wrong. His arms felt like they had led weights on them, making them very difficult to move, even turning his head to look back at Cormac was more effort than it should have been. </p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Harry, I’m going to take care of you,” Cormac said, pulling at Harry’s shirt and peeling it off the helpless teen. </p>
<p>Harry felt the cold air hit his skin and he shivered, his breath picking up pace as he felt Cormac’s hands roaming over his chest, down toward his trousers. </p>
<p>“Stop.” Harry said, weakly pushing at Cormac, however he had no strength left in his arms, and the only thing he managed to do was tumble into Cormac’s arms. </p>
<p>The older teen chuckled, gently lifting Harry up and laying him down on the bed. Harry lay there helpless as the remainder of his clothes were removed. The fuzzy feeling in his head had taken over his whole body, and he was unable to move, unable to fight back, or demand that Cormac stop. And even if he could scream for help, the party still in full swing downstairs would be enough to drown him out. </p>
<p>TBC</p>
<p>And here is yet another fanfic that I will need to keep up with. But, to be fair, this one, and another new one that I plan on finishing and posting soon, will give me something fun to work on while I try and figure out what I’m doing with all my other stories.</p>
