"He witnessed the death of a fellow competitor, Al."</p><p>Albus said, "I am aware of that fact and he witnessed Voldemort's return."</p><p>Minerva asked, "Do you believe him?"</p><p>Albus replied, "Of course I do, Minnie. But, I am afraid that nobody else will. The Minister will definitely say that he's lying."</p><p>Minerva scowled. "Stuff The Minister! We need to spread the word."</p><p>Albus told her, "In time, my dear. The world is not ready to accept it yet, but they will be one day."</p></div>
