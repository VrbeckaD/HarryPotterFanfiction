    <p>Chapter 1: You Can't Hide Forever      </p><p>Â </p><p>       Harry was sitting in the Three Broomsticks feeling downright miserable. He wouldn't normally go to the local Wizarding bar-- he gets too much attention for that-- but today all Harry really wanted was to be fawned over and coddled. Even though he had mastered the technique of warding off the unwanted attentions of girls ages ago-- three months age actually,-- since his nasty break-up with Ginny-- today Harry decided to let his guard down. In his opinion, his behavior was perfectly justified given he had NEVER had as bad a day as this one. Even killing Voldemort and dying doesn't do this day justice. Heck, DYING is preferrable at this point.</p><p>     Well, actually, if Harry remained perfectly honest with himself, the day didn't start off so bad. In reality, today was shaping up to be a pretty great day. But never judge a book by its cover, and never judge a day by its morning. </p><p>     Harry woke up to Ron snoring loudly and basically causing a personal earthquake in their shared flat, as per usual. They had only bought the flat about a year ago as they left Hogwarts, but already Ron had managed to decimate it daily with his nasally tones. Harry turned over in his bed and hit Ron with a pillow murmuring,</p><p>         "Wake up, you're causing natural disasters, you bugger."
                                    Ron snored on.</p><p>         "Ugh," Harry growled as he got out of bed, "Seriously, Ron?"</p><p>     He pushed his dead-to-the-world friend off of the bed and jumped back quickly as Ron took a swing and started cursing.</p><p>         "Merlin's Beard, Harry nice way to wake a fellow up now isn't it? Couldn't you have just whacked me a brick instead? Would have been more civil.."</p><p>     Ron continued to grumble as he got dressed for the day, but for Harry, his mission was accomplished. He managed to avoid all the haphazard insults thrown his way and go down to the kitchen for breakfast without dying or being hexed. Quite an accomplishment when you think about how much Ron despises being woken. To Harry's utter delight, when he got down there Hermione was sitting at the table and reading the Daily Prophet. She may only come over often because of her relationship with Ron, but every time still made Harry very happy. Here was somebody he could talk to, and she would help him out. He can't count the amount of times that Ron and he wound up staying up all night and laughing over mishaps that occurred in Auror training. (Imagine, casting a tracking spell and it rebounds. The poor guy just ends up running in circles as he frantically tries to find the "enemy" that is supposedly right next to him!) </p><p>     That particular morning, however, they were still cracking up about a cauldron that boiled over and bore a hole right into the floor below, causing acid to drip on the new recruits, which scared them near to death. despite the easy nature of their relationship, they knew the drill. Nobody ever mentioned the recurring nightmares that struck them all. They all knew that harry suffered the worst of them, and that Ron and Hermione were all but over the war. (At least as much as you can when your brother dies in it that is.) The companions avoided talking about how Harry woke up in cold sweats, or how he screamed bloody murder every night and cried about how this person or that died. His nightmares are almost always visions of how he couldn't save them. Harry sometimes even dreams of visions where Ron or Hermione or Ginny or any of close friends that survived die. Harry wouldn't be able to be consoled very well after those nightmares until he saw the person alive. At least they were rare.</p><p>    Harry knew that his luck wouldn't hold however, as he looked up from his breakfast to comment on something that Ron has just said. Hermione caught his eye instead, and in the depths of her eyes, Harry saw a sympathy and a determination that could only mean one thing. Hermione was about to bring up an uncomfortable topic. The topic. he was able to enjoy a reprieve for but two minutes until Hermione did what they all knew she would do. She waited until all was calm and peaceful, then brought up the elephant in the room-- Harry's nightmares.</p><p>         "Harry..." she tentatively inquired.</p><p>         "Yes 'Mione?" came the tense yet loving reply.</p><p>         " Do you... you don't have... I mean..." how flabbergasted she was at the moment just proved Harry was right about what she was going to say. "You are... Sleeping well, aren't you?"</p><p>     Harry closes his eyes and exhales as images of a flaming room and a terrified blonde flit through his mind. That was the nightmare that has been occurring the most often now. Other images joined this recent horror. Evil laughter intermingles with the sight of mangled bodies and the faces of friends that will breathe no more. The cries of the mourning, the wails of those survived, they echo in Harry's ears in these few seconds of thought nearly bringing him to tears. As always, he is transported into the past just by the simple mention of "sleeping well" a concept that Harry has long forgotten. At last the whirlwind of paralyzing fear slows just as the vision of Voldemort steps to the forefront of his mind...</p><p>     Harry's eyes snap open, abruptly halting the images. He stared into Hermione's troubled eyes, and saw the compassion there. He cannot burden her with this knowledge. If he couldn't protect thse that died... lying to protect Hermione seems just as good.</p><p>            "Yeah," Harry forced out of his fear constricted throat, "I have." He was feigning nonchalance, and Hermione was not fooled. She had seen her friend's antics for too long to bemisled by such a weak assertion.</p><p>            "It's just," Hermione began again, with every intention to finagle the truth from her raven-haired companion of eight years, "the war was only a year ago, Harry. I just thought with all that went on with you and Ginny..." </p><p>Images of the red-head flit through the man's mind. Ginny laughing. Ginny smiling. Ginny looking bemused. Ginny snogging him. Ginny snogging someone else...

</p><p>          "I figured that you might just still be having nightmares. Ron and I still do, and all we really did was destroy that last Horcrux! Not you of course though, Harry!" Hermione continued on hastily. " The war was hard on everybody, Harry. We all suffered loses, we don't want to lose you again. Not to this world of disturbing images and of death. We don't want you to have to go through this horror alone. Without somebody, you can be lost, unmoored, and Harry, if that happened, then the world wouldn't have just been ridded of a great evil, we would have lost a great blessing as well. Please, Harry, tell us. You don't have to be so noble as to suffer alone again. You have us. You always have. When I believed you to be dead, I nearly died myself. When you turned out to be alive I swear the world rejoiced. Please, Harry don't lie to us. If you are suffering nightmares and you do need support, we are here. Don't forget that."</p><p>     Harry was silent for a long time after that. After such an impassioned plea, it was hard for Harry to do what he knew was right. It was so easy to turn to his long standing friends for support, but sometimes, you are too broken to be healed so easily. No, this is something that he has to do on his own. He has to prove that he can still be strong, Even if being strong is exactly what hurt them the last time.</p><p>         " I appreciate that, Hermione, I really do," Harry finally asserted, "and I know that you are there. I was serious though. I'm fine."</p><p>Harry had to go out soon to see the results of his latest test. He can only hope the results will soothe him. If he passed. If he could stay. Keep this one pre-war dream alive. maybe, just maybe, he wouldn't have to hide anymore.</p><p>     As Harry turned to go, he couldn't help but notice Ron, shaking his head "no" and revealing the truth.</p>
