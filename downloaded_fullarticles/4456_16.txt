</center>Percival didn’t feel well when he opened his eyes. He found not, as he had been expecting, the familiar softness of his own pillow and blankets, nor the familiar room of his own flat. Instead, he found the pillow hard and the blankets scratchy. Everything had an off-white, sterile colour to it.<p>That wasn’t what caused him such discomfort, however. It was a sense of grogginess and of nausea roiling somewhere between his stomach and his diaphragm. Opening his eyes was difficult. They felt heavy and he found that focusing on any particular thing farther away than the bed he laid in was equally troublesome. He knew this should have worried him, but it didn’t. At least not immediately. He could feel the undercurrent of worry, the knowledge that this felt like the weight of a potion, but the feeling didn’t touch him.</p><p>Everything was too bright. He shifted, tried to turn his head and found that he could. When he did, more of the room came into focus. The white walls and metal bed frame, the same off-white curtains as the colour of his sheets, and a wheeled cart with charts and a clipboard told him all he needed to know. </p><p>He was in a hospital. </p><p>He was out of his flat. Out of Grindelwald’s hold. Very likely out of the man’s reach, or so he could only assume. A sensation of relief tinged the undercurrent of his senses beneath the numbness that permeated his mind. </p><p>He couldn’t remember how he’d gotten there. He didn’t know what happened to the man who’d kept him. All he remembered was being told to sleep, just like every time that man had done before leaving Percival alone.</p>
<hr/><p>In Europe, they had always underestimated wandless magic. In the bowels of MACUSA, they did not. Whether that had anything to do with American wizards in the city of New York growing very used to living among muggles and concealing their wands, even going without them when possible, or whether that was just standard caution against those powerful enough to use it, Gellert did not know. It was curious, but in the end, it still didn’t matter. </p><p>Gellert stood against the bars of his cell, fists wrapped around the cold metal and forehead pressed as far as it would go between two bars. He needed to feel every inch of the magic woven into the cubic space around him. The physicality of the iron in his grip helped. It would not yield to his palms, but it would to his mind. His internal dialog switched from English to Latin and it became easier to feel the bonds of the magic that kept him there. It was woven so tight, trying to lock him not just inside the space of the cell, but to suppress his abilities completely. Gellert closed his eyes and let himself feel it. It was a sensation he could only think of as being buried under a pit of mud, suffocating and heavier than it could ever seem from the surface, trying to free his magic from beneath the interwoven wards. </p><p>At first it seemed impossible. The spells were so dense that nothing could move them. There was simply no room. Until he gripped harder and grit his teeth, collecting as much raw magic as he could and forcing a bit of it to spring up and out of himself, barely anything at all and not even touching the real boundaries of the prison yet. It left him breathing hard, but it was something. </p><p>No alarm sounded, and that was one of his real tests. The wards were not sensitive enough to detect such small amounts of magic, but he’d done it and he would do it again. And again, until he’d freed himself enough to tear down the bars under his hands and leave for good. </p><p>It wouldn’t be long.</p>
<hr/><p>The day Gellert Grindelwald disappeared from MACUSA’s impenetrable underbelly, he did not leave New York. A mass of aurors combed the streets for him, handing out search warrants to every semi-relevant establishment they knew of. Magical engineers inspected the cell where he’d been kept for only three days and they could not determine how he’d overpowered the wards. The whole of the magical community was on high alert for him and yet he had no desire to leave straight away. They were scouring every ocean liner that left port along a hundred mile line down the east coast, and still they wouldn’t find him. </p><p>He had not crossed the Atlantic through muggle means, nor would he use them to return to Europe, but he was not averse to doing business with them either, and keeping muggle quarters in the Bronx was not beneath him. He simply found the better muggle quarters than the area usually offered. He wouldn’t be staying long. </p><p>“Only a day or two,” he informed the doorman with his muggle disguise firmly in place—an elder fellow with a cheery face and a national origin that was hard to pinpoint—”and then it was back off to traveling the wide world. Perhaps Australia this time,” he added with a chuckle and a wave, comfortable with the face he wore until he was safely behind the closed doors of his rented flat on the fifth floor. </p><p>In truth, he needed to establish communication with his remaining followers in New York City before they scattered, anxious of the aurors after news of Grindelwad’s escape had hit the papers that afternoon. He needed this division of the movement to take root in New York and grow, and it would be easier to see that taken care of here than from afar. </p><p>It was not difficult. All he needed to do was send the order and, with the right disguise, watch each cog in the order he had carefully built during his time in America come together. </p><p>He only needed a few days to do it. Order after order he sent and watched as his followers were reassured that they were unknown to MACUSA. He spent those days entertained with the papers rehashing his disappearance and the wild speculations abounding as to his current whereabouts. He laid awake at night thinking his plans for America hadn’t been totally lost, even if the obscurial boy lingered on his thoughts most frequently in those hours. </p><p>Gellert was not prone to speaking to himself aloud, but as soon as he laid down to bed those nights, he found himself with a constant stream of dialog he should have used with the boy. He went over every conversation they’d ever had and tried to work it out differently. Mostly, it was what he’d said in the end that had done it, but he’d been too coarse all the way through, and he knew it in hindsight even if the boy hadn’t noticed. Credence barely knew anything of kindness. If Mr. Graves had a note of impatience with him at times, Gellert thought it might have only felt right to the boy. He should have been more careful. He should have paid attention. Now he’d paid for his mistake, or Credence had, but the difference seemed negligible compared to the loss of such potential. </p><p>After an hour or so of such thoughts, Gellert would force himself to turn over and shut them out of his mind. It was over. The boy with sad eyes and a mouth so sinfully red and artfully shaped it was a wonder no one had ever stopped him on the street and tried to take him away before, that boy was gone. There was no getting him back, and all the raw power hidden beneath his skin went with him. </p><p>Gellert had to accept it. </p><p>With his mind forced blank in hopes of sleep and eyes shut tight in determination, he did not see the few, tiny tendrils of oily smoke curling around his fifth story window.</p>
<hr/><p>Gellert awoke to a chill in the air. It was the first thing he became aware of, before his eyes had even opened, and he could not comprehend why that was. He pulled the thick blankets up to his chin and wrinkled his nose. He’d charmed the damn place when the heat had gone out before. Gellert didn’t use this muggle identity often, but he’d been forced to for a handful of days during his time in New York and it had gone out on more than one occasion. The spell should have kept even if he’d been away, but apparently, it had not. </p><p>He lifted his head in frustration and reached for his wand, the most powerful wand known to wizardkind, intent on fixing the damn heating. His fingers paused as they closed around the handle, something across the room having caught his eye as he’d turned over. Something that was not the way it had been when he’d fallen asleep the night prior. The window was cracked open. </p><p>Gellert gripped the wand and jolted upright, scanning the room with every sense he had, yet finding nothing more out of place. With a spell under his breath, he checked to see whether he remained alone inside the flat and found that, oddly enough, he was. </p><p>With care in his movements not to make a sound, he rose from the bed and crossed to the window, performing another charm to detect any residual magic left behind upon its opening. He found none. Which should not have been the case. He’d equipped the flat with just enough protections not to allow anyone but himself entry, magically or otherwise. He’d intentionally refrained from putting too much power into the wards, lest he run the risk of them being noticed by MACUSA, but they should have held up to anything but the most powerful of breaching spells. And there certainly should have been traces left behind if they had been breached by magic. </p><p>He reached out and lifted the window up, noting it did not open easily, until he could glance outside. Nothing in particular stood out. The same street stretched out below and there were no noticeable signs of the neighbours doing anything strange in the adjacent apartments. Gellert ground his teeth and slammed the window shut, noting with no small amount of affront, that it was not particularly easy to close. </p><p>That was it. He stalked into the adjacent room and began readying to leave. There were not many things he missed when he put his mind to investigate, and he did not relish the uncertainty this morning left hanging about the flat. He trusted his instincts, and he decided that it was time to move on. Even if this occurrence was somehow explained away as a fluke later, he did not enjoy sticking around in quarters he was not certain were not one hundred percent under his control. </p><p>Thirty minutes later saw him showered and packed and wearing his muggle face again, waving goodbye to the doorman, bidding farewell in a light and airy tone and a smile on his face. The man probably thought him something of an eccentric, or one of those businessmen who can’t stop themselves from starting up something new and had to be out of town every few months or so. Gellert found that if he wore a persona well enough, he did not need to spend much time building it up. He would not be remembered suspiciously here, and he fully intended the apartment to remain available to him if he ever needed to return. </p><p>But it was time he left regardless. Although he had planned to stay another day or two, his message to his followers had been well received and he did not feel the need to linger. With a single suitcase in hand, Gellert hailed a muggle cab and made his way across the city towards Manhattan, or more specifically, the river. </p><p>It would be a shame to say goodbye to New York, he thought as he watched cars and pedestrians alike pass. Its constant chaos and noise and thriving, filthy energy were enlivening, even to a man who’d grown up in a European countryside. Perhaps, especially to a man who’d grown up in a European countryside, and who’d dreamed of more. He imagined he could see the witches and wizards employed by MACUSA on the street corners as the cab rushed past, those searching for him, and still more of their kind among the faces of the pedestrians around him, blending into the crowds, taking the long way home every day. Just like muggles did. </p><p>Gellert sighed and glanced ahead, past his driver and through the car’s narrow windshield. “You can stop at Blackwell’s Island.” </p><p>The driver nodded and attempted to strike up conversation, but Gellert was distracted and only paid half an ear to the man’s commentary on their destination and casual questions until they lapsed back into silence. He paid the driver once they crossed the bridge and stopped across the street from the City Hospital. Finally, he was left alone once again, steeling himself against the wind and the strange sensation of a tingle down his spine, likely due to stepping into the chill. </p><p>It was a minor relief, being alone. This island, made up of New York’s less distinguished institutions, was not heavily watched by the wizarding community unless one of their own happened to be separated from their wand and later found in the nearby asylum, as had happened on at least one known occasion. It was also not heavy in muggle foot traffic apart from the main streets. For both of those reasons Gellert had chosen it.</p><p>He made his way across the street and down the walk, keeping an eye out for nearby muggles, but fortunately the cold kept most of them inside and the few he did pass hurried along without a second glance. He cast a notice a notice-me-not charm once he was headed down towards the river, feeling unusually as though he wasn’t alone in spite of all evidence to the contrary. </p><p>There were only a couple small, concrete docks on the island, and they were usually tended to by the muggles as a precaution due to the nearby penitentiary and to oversee the coming and going of goods, but Gellert slipped easily down the stairwell to one without notice. The enclave next to the dock was empty, as it had been when he’d arrived in New York and would most often remain. Not many people travelled down there, except for the groundskeepers when they wanted to take breaks away from prying eyes. Gellert caught site of an ashtray and a half-hidden bottle of what might be whiskey tucked behind a shelf in the corner. The muggles had not disturbed what he had come there for, however. </p><p>There, tucked against a corner across from the dock, was a pile of old junk. Gellert strode towards a bucket propped up against the wall, rusty and with a small hole clearly visible in its side, slightly separated from the pile. He was already making plans for his return to Europe—Berlin, to be precise—where he would be back in his own company, but something stopped him mid-stride. The same prickle down his back he’d felt when he’d gotten out of the cab happened again, almost warm this time, and Gellert recognised it. It was the sensation of <i>magic</i>. And it was very close. </p><p>On instinct, he whirled and drew his wand, but found himself pointing at nothing but the dock and the open expanse of the river beyond. He listened hard for any sound above him or to the sides of the enclave, but heard nothing. He had no doubts of what he felt though. It was still there. Somewhere very close, someone was using magic. Wild magic, too. It was not usually this easy to sense such a thing, even for a powerful wizard trained to be attuned to it, but most wizards performing simple spells did so with minimal force and did so “cleanly”. This was…anything but. </p><p>Carefully, he stepped back the way he came, away from the wall and the bucket but not too far. Just far enough to make a dive for it if he needed to get out of there quickly. The faint tingle sparked again, this time at the back of his neck and then down his left arm. It felt like electricity, heated little pinpricks of harmless magic that seemed to want to be something more, but fell hopelessly short. It was completely invisible. </p><p>Gellert did not like the feeling of not knowing what it was, the suspicion that it might be an attack and he might be indulging a foolish sense of curiosity, but he also had a feeling he was about to find out. As a precaution, however, he brought his wand before him and focused on a spell he’d learned long ago, barely older than a boy, and disappeared. </p><p>It was an extremely powerful disillusionment charm, rendering him invisible to any living being or muggle technology, and it had served him well in uncertain situations before. Yet Gellert was still careful as he moved about the room, realising that the little bursts of magic did not extend outside that space. Whatever it was, it was contained within the enclave and it had followed him there, he was sure of it. </p><p>He gave it another minute and still nothing happened. The sparks did not die out, but they did occur less frequently. In spite of the disillusionment charm, he still felt them around his fingers although he had no way to determine if that was the magic’s intention or if it simply filled enough space in the room for him to feel it. If he wasn’t mistaken, however, these sparks of raw magic were losing power. With consideration, he raised his wand again and funnelled a little of his own magic into the force. Whatever this was, he now suspected it was not a trap laid out to harm him. It both felt and was behaving more like a wounded magical creature, and there were times Gellert could not contain his curiosity. </p><p>Upon meeting the invisible force, Gellert’s magic began to draw something out of the air that wasn’t there before. Something…like smoke. Little wisps of black smoke took shape where the tip of his wand had been and they curled around and around again in an oily path through the air, lengthening little by little, until Gellert realised that it was not smoke at all. </p><p>His eyes widened and he dropped both the disillusionment charm and the unremarkable muggle visage. This force was not smoke and neither was it residual, raw magic. Or rather, it was, but it was not the sort left behind by another wizard. It was magic and wizard combined, a parasite that had become so thoroughly one with its host that they were inseparable, nearly one being. </p><p>
  <i>It was the obscurus.</i>
</p><p>As soon as the realisation hit, Gellert checked himself. But he wasn’t mistaken. It wasn’t wishful thinking. He reached forward with his free hand and let it glide through the wisps of darkness, finding them warm and indeed somewhat oily to the touch before the electric sparks prickled over his skin again. This time not only heat, but pain came with it, as though the obscurus were driving itself into the flesh of his hand in an effort to attack him. </p><p>Gellert grinned and laughed. “You followed me here.” There was no question in it, no doubt in his mind. The pins and needles in his palm drew up his wrist and the inky black wisps lengthened until they were drawn thin and translucent, stretched to their fullest, and Gellert could not help laughing again. “Look at you. I wasn’t wrong was I? You’re a miracle. To have survived….” </p><p>The pricks did not relent, but it was a pitiful attack. “You want to hurt me, don’t you?” Gellert drew his wand over his forearm where the wisps that remained of the obscurus held onto him. He drew on his magic again, building it up little by little in the core of the Elder wand, but he did not offer it to the insubstantial force, merely let it feel the power it did not have. “Is that what you tried to do to me last night? Sneak into my flat and annoy me with a chill?” Gellert felt the spark snap harsher for a moment before it died out again and then resumed its previous efforts at torturing his palm. He lowered his voice and crooned, “Poor thing. What you must want to do to me. And to be left in such a state as this, barely a shadow of what you were.” </p><p>His smile began to fade, listening to his own words. It was true. This once mighty obscurus was nothing now. It had been even less without the little bit of magic Gellert had fed it. It was practically dead. But it stung him sharply again, this time swirling in menacing circles around his forearm, desperate to harm him even though he could tell it was tiring quickly. </p><p>Gellert cocked his head, watching it twist in on itself and explode outward again, a tiny little tornado in the palm of his hand. He had half a mind to be disgusted with the feeling of admiration it drew forth within him. This little being, with its last vestiges of life was bent on satisfying its spite. For him, specifically, but he did not find that off-putting. And it had once been so powerful. Powerful enough that he’d spent months in search of it. Crossed an ocean to do so. Powerful enough that he’d wanted it for himself, had known how great of a weapon it could be in his army. There were few things Gellert could not do when he put his mind to it and few people he could not sway to his side of things given enough time, and the boy, if he’d only known, would not have stood a chance at resisting him. </p><p>“Credence,” Gellert said, softly this time, holding the small well of magic in his wand steady. “Would you like a fair shot at your revenge?”</p><p>The twisting, turning mass of ink drew back and the pinpricks lightened. Gellert had caught it off guard, but he knew it could understand him now. He didn’t have to repeat himself. The mass left his forearm and drew around the wand, circling it, dimming the glow of magic with its darkness, but unable to steal any of it until Gellert allowed it to be taken. </p><p>“I assume that counts as a ‘yes’.” Gellert cocked his head again, feeling a smile form at his mouth. “Not too proud to accept help from me, are you? But I doubt you’d hesitate to kill me either. If you could.” His tone turned almost affectionate, thinking of Credence’s wrath in the station. How the boy must hate him now, after dying. Or nearly dying. Gellert supposed it was his fault it had happened the way it had, even though he’d not intended it. Credence would surely see it the same, blaming Gellert for his death as much as for abandoning him. </p><p>Slowly, Gellert fed the magic he’d been holding into the obscurus. It seemed to breathe around the wand, expanding in a swell, overtaken by the energy, and then contracting again. The wisps of black grew darker, more solid, and they began to multiply. The whole entity doubled in size and Gellert could feel a pulse thrumming within it now, not just the pulse of magic, but the very life within it. </p><p>“That’s it,” he whispered before the store of magic drained completely. The obscurus hovered over his wand, now encompassing his forearm, seemingly unsure of what to do with itself. He doubted it would be long before it attacked him again, but for the moment it seemed to be relishing its own form, perhaps hoping for more of his magic. “Feels better, doesn’t it?” he asked. </p><p>The obscurus did not react to his words, but it did draw farther out, expanding as it had tried to do before. This time it didn’t cling to Gellert. It was moving on its own and did so faster, little by little. It grew until it began to thin again, and with a jolt of violence it contracted in itself once more, still unable to form the shape it once had. </p><p>Gellert thought he knew what it was trying to do now. “You’re so used to being a boy that you miss it, don’t you? And you can’t change back.” It would take some investigating to see whether Credence had in fact died in the battle with the aurors and this little bit that was left was the remnants of the parasite, but Gellert didn’t think so. The parasite was a magical force alone, and though it had spent more time inside of Credence and as a part of him than any obscurus ever had in a human before, it still behaved more like a human, and it understood him. </p><p>It began to drift. Seemingly no longer interested in attacking Gellert, the tendrils of black oil oozed down to the concrete floor. Gellert crouched beside it. “Credence.” He took care with his tone, but still the mass roiled at him. “Come with me. Let me help you. I promise you’ll get your shot at me. At your revenge.” He held a hand out, palm up, but the tendrils nearest it shot away from his touch. He couldn’t help chuckling. Mere moments ago it had been desperate to hold onto him in both its desire to attack and sap the magic he offered it. “Don’t <i>wallow</i>.” He drew out the word, chiding the creature. </p><p>It shuddered and rippled and the sparking magic inside it started up again. Gellert was sure it would be screeching at him if it could. The very air crackled around it this time, but it still couldn’t grow any stronger or cause him any real damage. </p><p>“Now, once more,” Gellert pocketed his wand and stood, looking down at the black, pooling mass, “come with me, or stay here and fade into the ether for what may very well be the rest of eternity. I won’t be back for you.” </p><p>The tendrils rippled and the mass drew away from him, but the moment he stepped towards the bucket, the creature flung itself forward, leeching around his legs. It stabbed sharp thorns of magic into him wherever it touched and he scowled, reaching down and letting it coil about his arm again. “None of that now. You can be upset with me later.” The stabbing pain turned to pinpricks along his arm and he couldn’t help his smile again, nor the swell of satisfaction rising in his chest at the obscurus’ acquiescence. This was barely the force he’d sought after, but it was something still. It was <i>potential</i>. And he’d thought he’d lost it all. </p><p>“Come, Credence. Let me show you the world outside of this little bubble of yours.” Gellert grinned at the roiling mass and wondered if it could see him like it—like the boy—used to. It showed no fear now, however, and that was a good sign. He strode to the bucket and gave the creature one last look. “Now, hold on tight.” With that, Gellert reached down and laid his hand over the frigid tin and was pulled by a sharp hook into nothingness.</p>
<hr/><p>The portkey dropped them in a wooded grove with the sun hanging low in the sky above the trees. Gellert straightened as the hook in his chest dissipated and made sure the obscurus had made the journey along with him. It had. Its tendrils had nearly flattened against his forearm. Half of it had seeped underneath not only his coat, but also his shirtsleeves, clinging to his very skin. It was so like the boy it had once been that it brought out a strange sense of amusement within Gellert and he was chuckling again before he could help it. </p><p>“I have a feeling you’re going to like Berlin,” he said more to himself than to the creature as he looked out the edge of the grove to an open stretch of snow covering the field beyond, dotted with patches of brown brush and little craggy hills. “All the sin you could imagine concentrated into one dazzling little city.” Gellert grinned and set off.</p><p>They weren’t far outside the city. He would make the hike in under an hour in order to avoid the anti-apparition zones that had sprung up around many nearby cities in the wake of his attacks. He was just far enough out not to be noticed. </p><p>Gellert hummed as he walked, his spirits picking up with every step. Although he’d communicated regularly with his contacts entrusted with access to the alternate fireplace he’d kept, which were very few, and had never truly left them to their own devices, he had been gone for some time. Now he was returning to his own domain with what he’d set out for—creating a coordinated foothold in America and the obscurus. If not the obscurial as well, but he would have to see about that. If the host was in fact gone or disabled beyond repair and the obscurus was this withered, it might not be strong enough on its own to manage being of much use at all. It would be a terribly disappointing outcome, after performing such a magnificent feat of surviving MACUSA’s attack, but Gellert would have to accept it and probably destroy the thing. It would only be a nuisance otherwise, with it still being bent on its revenge against him. </p><p>That was another problem, even if he found that the obscurus could recover its power. He had to know that he could control it like he could have controlled the boy when he’d been alive and human. There had never been an instance of an obscurus finding a new host either, especially not one who hadn’t been as downtrodden, for lack of a better word, as the original host. But Gellert was never one to pass up a challenge if it came to that and having personal control over such a force would be even better than having control of its host. If it was a possibility, it would still be a long shot. If there was anyone least likely to become an obscurial, it was Gellert Grindelwald. </p><p>By the time he entered the city with the full disillusionment charm in place, Gellert had the beginnings of a plan. The obscurus had not moved from his arm and did not seem to be tempted to follow anyone but him as they passed people on the street. He had avoided apparating near the grove, but inside the city was fair game. </p><p>Gellert took the obscurus to the flat he kept there, unused for the many months he’d been away, but tidy and looked after by a house elf. He arrived with a loud crack echoing off the empty walls and found the place just as he had left it—spacious, elegantly furnished, and empty. The street below was muted with a charm. They might as well have been alone on the countryside again for how well the apartment was locked to the outside world. </p><p>Step after step echoed through the hall as Gellert entered the living room. “Gwendoline,” he called. There was no need to raise his voice, the elf could hear him perfectly well wherever he was when he wanted her. </p><p>A small pop echoed in the hall he’d just vacated and Gellert looked down to find the little elf staring up at him with unusually wide eyes. “Master is home! Gwendoline is very happy to see you, sir. It’s been so long.” She rocked forward on her dainty toes, wisps of dark, ringlet curls bouncing around her high forehead, but her hands trembled where they were clasped in front of her pillowcase dress. </p><p>“Thank you, Gwendoline. I’d like dinner. And stock the pantry if you haven’t recently.” Gellert paused. “A stew, I think. And set out two bowls.” </p><p>She gave a quick nod and a “Yessir,” and disapparated immediately, even if it was just to the kitchen. </p><p>Gellert sighed and glanced down at his arm, noting that the obscurus hadn’t showed itself from beneath his sleeve. It hadn’t even moved. He walked over to the window and raised his arm to let the light fall on it as he unrolled his sleeve. The creature underneath, when revealed, didn’t shrink back. It undulated softly against his skin and Gellert smiled, marvelling at the way it sucked in the light around it. The antithesis of a lumos charm. He brushed his fingers over the dark coils and the thing bristled, but didn’t attempt to shock him again. His smile grew wider and he moved to the couch, settling upon it with his arm still raised. </p><p>“Come now. We’re home and safe. Let’s see what you can do,” Gellert implored of the obscurus with another gentle stroke of his fingers and received another bristling reaction. He took his hand away and looked at the creature. It may not be able to recognize the expression on his face, but he knew it understood him. </p><p>After a minute or so of patiently waiting with the mass of tendrils and darkness growing increasingly restless, it slipped from his forearm and floated listlessly into the air. Gellert rested his elbows on his knees and waited, patient and watchful. The creature began to unfurl itself, stretching the way it had on the island, but it quivered and shook before it got very far. Gellert cocked his head, watching it become agitated and coil back in on itself before spooling out again. This time he recognized the faint shape of a figure as it stretched itself, its inky hue darkening in pulses as though it were trying to draw more magic, or a part of itself it had been lacking. </p><p>Gellert watched this process begin and fail several times before the obscurus’ quivering mass grew too unstable to continue. Its magic was sparking again, although this time Gellert did not seem to be the focus of its rage. If he’d stepped outside and plucked a storm cloud from the sky to hover in his living room, there would have been little difference. </p><p>“<i>Enough</i>,” he said when the cloud had only managed to form the hazy outline of a young man whose face and limbs just couldn’t seem to take shape. The mass of smoke and tendrils collapsed again and shrank from him when he stood, bristling and sparking in its agitation. He drew nearer regardless, ignoring the creature’s spite. “Clearly, your human half is still in there,” Gellert began, taking out his wand and moving it through the air above the obscurus. “Obvious, really. The parasite likely has very little higher brain-like function. Had it been separated completely, it would have either attacked me until it wore itself down to nothing or it would have travelled listlessly through the world forever. But you didn’t, did you.” Gellert took a step closer and the creature retreated back, its coils raising like a shield. He didn’t stop until he was crouching before it. “You hate me. But you want to live more, don’t you? So let me help you.” </p><p>Gellert raised his wand again. The obscurus did not move. It took another minute for it to lower its coils and allow Gellert to cast a spell. He did so quietly, moving his wand over the black form and raining drops of blue light down onto it. The magic passed right through, but the scanning spell told Gellert enough. </p><p>“You’ve lost a great deal of yourself,” he told the creature, folding his hands in his lap. “Some of which, I believe can be regained, but it’s difficult to say how much. You’re wounded, magically speaking, and no one to my knowledge has ever tried and succeeded to heal an obscurial before.” He did not offer the creature a smile this time. His smiles were for himself now. Even if the creature could see him with human eyes, Credence had seen through them. “I’m afraid it looks as though your physical form will be too difficult to manage, if your attempts just now were any indication,” Gellert added. “I can feed you more of my magic, which will help a little, but it isn’t a true fix. I can apply patches where needed to sustain your body to a point, but…a wizard’s magic is his own, and ultimately, you’ll have to heal on your own.” </p><p>The mass of darkness lowered itself to the floor, its trembling diminished, slightly. It did not look particularly hopeful, but it did not retreat from him again, either. </p><p>“Alright then.” Gellert straightened and raised his wand once more. “Let’s see what I can do.” </p><p>With that, he closed his eyes and muttered another, quiet spell, focusing on the mass pooled before him. When the white light of his magic hit the creature, it emitted an unholy sound for the first time he’d ever heard, even back in New York. It was nothing a human throat could produce, but somewhere between a gale wind and a spirit’s howl, both wild and intelligent and all the more unsettling for it. </p><p>The creature’s form rose from the ground once more, twisting and turning on itself like a figure caught in the midst of apparition. It was surely in pain, but that only spurred Gellert to focus harder into feeding his magic into the creature. Pain meant life. Pain meant not only consciousness, not only spirit, but <i>physicality</i>, nerves and bone and tissue, and that’s what he wanted for the obscurial. If the boy lost inside of the obscurus could not reshape himself, then Gellert would have to do it for him. </p><p>Gellert was very quickly finding the limitations the obscurial had already encountered, however. Even with the energy fed into it, there was simply too much of itself missing. </p><p>When Gellert opened his eyes, he caught a glimpse of the boy he’d known for a short time. Credence’s upper torso hung in suspended animation amid a whirling mass of black tendrils pierced with the light of Gellert’s magic all over. It lit up Credence’s skin from the inside, but he could see that the boy was not conscious and most of him was immaterial. Credence wasn’t still, either. His face contorted in pain, fading in and out of black oil and white light until Gellert gave up on that track and let the boy’s form fall away into the mass he’d been before. </p><p>If Gellert could not save Credence as he was, then there was perhaps another option. The boy’s magic had been diminished. His physical form had been ripped from him, but Gellert could give him another. One that fit the state of his magic. One that might allow him to grow into it as he should have, naturally, and one that would not stretch the amount of matter that remained to him. </p><p>Gellert drew on his energy again, focusing it into a narrow band and searching for the remaining power of the obscurial. Without stopping, he cast legilimens to locate the mind of the boy inside. Once he found it, Gellert gathered that magic and dove inside, back and back and further back still, until Credence’s memories changed, until counter tops were taller and unusual things sometimes happened around him, but only when he was at his most lonely, or frightened…or angry. Gellert’s magic pooled there, engulfing that space in Credence’s mind, taking hold of it and drawing it forth until he pulled it into existence. </p><p>He’d closed his eyes at some point because when he opened them again, the swirling darkness and the swell of his own bright magic had faded. In their place laid a small body, shoulders shaking and breath wheezing, curled in on itself so tightly that all Gellert could see was pale skin and a mess of black hair. </p><p>He sank down to his knees and reached out for the trembling figure, drawing the boy—now truly a boy—into his arms. It became immediately apparent that Credence’s trembling wasn’t just shock. The boy’s face was red, his cheeks and eyes puffy, and tears streamed down his face. Gellert grabbed a throw blanket from the edge of the couch and wrapped it around the boy, holding him tight and attempting to quiet the whimpering that came with his every breath. </p><p>Credence quieted after a time in Gellert’s arms, after soft strokes of his hair and soft shushing. The boy fit in his lap easily now. Only his legs spilled out onto the floor, and Gellert made sure to wrap them in the blanket as well. If he had to guess the boy’s age, he would have thought it around nine or ten, and he had no idea how cognizant Credence would be once the pain and the shock faded. Credence curled into him, tucking his head between the crook of Gellert’s arm and his shoulder. The boy was seeking warmth. Gellert stroked his back and massaged the back of his head, making his touch as gentle as he could, even more gentle than he’d been in those dark alleys where they’d spent the majority of their time together. </p><p>And then Gellert felt eyes on him. It was a familiar prickle at the back of his neck, the senses of a finely tuned legilimens spell. He glanced to the doorway and found Gwendoline staring at him, her diminutive figure hunched and uncertain. “Master’s dinner is ready, if he pleases.” She did not comment on the boy. </p><p>“You can go,” Gellert said, not kindly, and Gwendoline’s shoulders rose to her ears before she disappeared with a pop. </p><p>When Gellert turned back to Credence, he found the boy’s eyes open, watching him. Credence held no expression. It didn’t even look like he comprehended who Gellert was. </p><p>Gellert smiled and with a blink of his eyes, a more familiar face fell over his features, sweeping his untamed blond hair into jets of black, reshaping his nose and mouth, and growing the faintest hint of stubble. He blinked down at the boy, whose eyes widened in dawning recognition. The transformation back into obscurial form must have sent Credence into a daze. Or maybe it was simply the intensity of the pain and the strangeness of a face he didn’t recognise. </p><p>“There you are.” Gellert couldn’t resist drawing a finger down the boy’s nose, so delicate now. All of him was, really. Credence had been young already, his skin mostly unmarred with the first signs of age if not his mother’s punishments, but this was something else. Gellert had forgotten just how unblemished, how soft, how <i>untouched</i> children could be. He realised he hadn’t stopped smiling when Credence’s newly small features turned into a scowl. Gellert was not prepared for the strength of the boy’s voice when he shouted, either. </p><p>“Let go of me!” Credence pushed at his chest and thrashed when Gellert didn’t let him go. They wound up in a tousle on the floor of the living room, bumping into the coffee table and sending a glass bowl crashing to the floor. Lemon drops scattered beneath them as Credence flailed and Gellert flattened one of the boy’s arms down to his chest with his own, locking the boy against him, but unable to stop the fervour of his writhing. Credence’s protests descended into screeching cries, and Gellert feared he would dissolve again into the obscurus at any moment. </p><p>“<i>Stop it!</i>” Gellert shouted, interrupting the boy’s screaming only in volume. Credence wouldn’t listen. Gellert had half a mind to slap the boy again, but didn’t. It was a near thing. He managed to catch the boy’s other wrist and force it down to be trapped against his chest like the first. Credence struggled, thrashing as much as he could with his shoulders, but Gellert’s hold didn’t break and Credence was soon trapped again in his lap, back pressed to Gellert’s chest and the blanket fallen mostly away. It was too much to expect the boy’s clothes to have survived all of that, but Gellert ignored his nudity for the moment. He softened his voice and pressed his mouth to Credence’s ear, hoping to derail his single-minded desire to break free. “I am not going to hurt you, Credence.” </p><p>Credence made a defiant, high pitched noise from the back of his throat. It sounded like the growl of a small animal. He twisted his body, trying to writhe out of Gellert’s grip, but it was useless. “I hate you,” Credence hissed. </p><p>“Come now,” Gellert chided, but his tone was calming and lacked amusement. “I said you would get your chance at revenge. Just not so soon.” </p><p>Credence sniffled and his small body remained rigid, but his thrashing stopped. His lip was trembling, but Gellert could tell it was as much from fury as it was from all the uncertainty the boy was surely facing. </p><p>“How much do you remember?” Gellert asked. He was content to wait like that for as long as it took. Credence was no stranger to punishment. Nor was he stranger to his will being quietly overtaken by another’s, crushed down until it was hidden inside him, unseen and unheard, but still very much alive. This was familiar, at least. </p><p>At first, the boy didn’t answer. Gellert sensed a petty rebelliousness in his mind, as though Credence really were a child. His chest was still heaving from their tousle and his pent up emotion, and anger roiled under his skin like the inky wisps of the obscurus, but Credence remained tight lipped and defiant. He refused to even look at Gellert when the man leaned over his shoulder and sought eye contact. </p><p>“I won’t ask you again, Credence,” Gellert said, quiet but not gentle any longer. He removed one of his arms from around the boy’s torso, but made sure to keep Credence pinned still, and curled his fingers in Credence’s hair. He didn’t pull. He didn’t do anything but let the threat of further restraint rest there, but still the boy refused to speak. “Credence.”</p><p>“<i>Everything</i>.” Credence spat the word. He’d wanted to say it though, Gellert could feel it in his mind as much as he could hear it in his tone. Credence wanted to rail at him, not hold it in any longer. “You said you’d help me. You said you were my <i>friend</i>.” His voice broke. He sounded just like he had back in New York, except this time the voice crying at Gellert came out of a child’s body. </p><p>Gellert pressed his head to Credence’s and rocked gently, shushing him again. “I know. I know I did,” he kept his tone soft and even. “I was wrong to lie to you, and I was wrong to cast you away. Credence, I was wrong about everything about you.” He turned his head to stare, imploring the boy to meet his gaze, but Credence’s face broke into a mask of pain. </p><p>The boy tried to jerk himself free again and fresh tears fell from his eyes. He didn’t try to hold back his sobbing and Gellert sighed, restraining him again and then petting Credence’s hair as the boy gave up. He waited and held Credence, no longer rocking him, just sitting there in the emptiness of the living room, their dinner growing cold somewhere in the kitchen, and not knowing when the boy would stop. </p><p>Eventually, when Credence had gotten through the worst of it, Gellert loosened his hold enough to wrap him up in the blanket again. Then he lifted Credence into his arms and took him to the couch, laying him down to rest. The fight had gone out of the boy for the moment, and he stayed where he was put, still hiccupping quiet sobs whenever a swell of hurt caught him off guard. </p><p>Gellert sat there with him until he deemed Credence calm enough not to do anything foolish, and then he stood to fetch the stew. </p><p>When he returned, Credence was right where he’d left him, curled up on the couch, on his side, with the blanket tight around his shoulders, not even a toe peeking out. Gellert laid the reheated bowls down on the coffee table for both of them and settled in a leather armchair across from the boy before taking his. </p><p>Credence seemed to take no interest. </p><p>“You should eat if you can,” Gellert said to no response. “Do you know how tired you’re feeling now? You’ve depleted your energy, and you didn’t have much to begin with. You’ll need it to get your strength back, and that includes your magic.”</p><p>“I’m not here for <i>you</i>,” Credence hissed, nearly too quiet to be heard, and once again Gellert marvelled at how much like a real child he sounded. </p><p>The boy sniffled and Gellert shrugged, focusing back on his own stew. It was a thick and creamy steak and potato, and it permeated the air with a pleasant aroma, one Credence surely noticed. Gellert knew he was hungry. His body was whole again, if smaller. There had been no residual injuries left after his magic helped the obscurial reform himself, just the raw pain of the process. Even the boy’s face scrunched up in a scowl. His mind was a whirl of activity, trying to hold back all the things that wanted to burst from him—questions, anger, anything—but Credence’s mind was also heavy with tiredness. </p><p>“What did you do to me?” Credence finally whispered when Gellert was spooning the last of the stew from his bowl. </p><p>“I saved your life. Or your human life, anyway.” Gellert licked his lips and set the empty bowl back down on the table. He watched Credence. The boy was looking at his own hands. Credence hadn’t seen a mirror yet, but it was pretty clear what had happened. Gellert sighed. “You won’t be able to regain your usual form until you’re healed and whole again. Magically.” Credence’s eyes turned to him, and Gellert could feel the way the boy was scared, the way he instinctively sought guidance, even if it was from the man who’d betrayed him. Gellert was his only source of knowledge in this. </p><p>“You’re not like most wizards, Credence.” Gellert rose from his chair and went to the couch. Credence shifted away from him, but didn’t protest any further before he sat down. “Most wizards have magic innate to themselves, their body and their consciousness. It can be suppressed through various means, but that is usually separate from actions against their physical form. One kind of pain can have consequences for the other, and so on, but you…. Your body, and your magic, are so entwined with the obscurus living inside you, that it seems they have become almost one. You are closer to pure magic than any of us are.” </p><p>Gellert reached out and stroked a hand over Credence’s hair. The boy’s eyes glazed over, clearly trying to envision himself as Gellert described, but he cringed at the touch. Gellert ignored it. “Come. Eat something. Just a little,” he said. “And then you can rest. We’ll draw you a bath and get you some clothes. What do you say?” </p><p>Credence sniffed again. It was clear he wasn’t about to be taken in by such simple niceties, but he did raise himself up enough to sit properly and he took the bowl of stew when Gellert handed it to him. Gellert massaged his shoulder in a silent thank you, and found the boy’s skin to be even softer than it looked. He draped his arm over the back of the couch and let Credence eat, slowly and quietly. </p><p>He’d been right, Credence was hungry. The boy didn’t put down his bowl, but after a while, Gellert felt the prickle of Credence’s thoughts turning to him. Legilimency without direct focus usually provided him impressions of the minds around him, and Credence was no different. The boy gave no outward indication of it, but he was trying to measure up the man at his side. </p><p>“You’re not really Mr. Graves, are you?” Credence finally spoke. </p><p>A smile twitched at Gellert’s mouth. “No.” He thought about removing the illusion again, but he could feel the echo of a clench inside Credence’s chest at the confirmation and decided against it. “But you can call me that if you like.” </p><p>“Where’s the real—” </p><p>“Not here,” Gellert interrupted him. Credence flinched, but it was reactionary, not out of real fear. Frustration roiled off the boy at his own reaction, but Gellert still wasn’t about to let this train of thought take hold in Credence. “You never knew him. He isn’t even aware of your existence. It was always me.” </p><p>The boy scowled, but Gellert was not going to let Credence latch onto another man for hope. Credence had always, <i>always</i> been alone in the world, and that was the best leverage Gellert had. Credence set down his bowl, only a little of the stew remaining, and curled his arms around himself. He looked lost, and so far he hadn’t turned back into his obscurus form. The boy had to be unsure why, especially considering how much he’d fought against Gellert upon waking in his living room. Gellert suspected it was a combination of instinct and the boy being too weak. He’d only just regained human form and on a very deep level he was probably terrified of losing it again. </p><p>Gellert rose from the couch. “Let’s get you cleaned up, and then you can rest. Tomorrow, we’ll assess how you’re doing.” He ignored Credence’s defiant silence and went to fill the bathtub. </p><p>When he returned, Credence hadn’t moved, but he caught the boy looking around the room. Curiosity threaded through Credence’s mind. He had no idea where they were, Gellert realised. Credence must not have picked up on everything he’d said in obscurus form after all, although whether that was due to the obscurus not caring about the details in its highly emotional state of mind, or his overall weakened state, Gellert could not guess. It would be fascinating to find the limits of such a creature, someday. </p><p>Gellert crossed the room, clapping his hands together. “Up now. Trust me, you’ll feel better.” </p><p>Credence’s scowl returned, but he did rise to his feet with the blanket wrapped around his shoulders. He looked at Gellert’s outstretched hands, waiting for the boy to come to him, and conflicting emotions filled his head. Gellert waited, and it paid off. Credence went to him and let him lead the boy to the bathroom, already filled with a warm humidity in the air and the pleasant smell of pine soap. </p><p>Credence shivered as Gellert lifted the blanket from him and tossed it aside. It had been trailing on the floor behind him, more than double the size he was now. He glanced up Credence’s short frame, but the boy looked away before their eyes could meet and Gellert wasn’t sure if Credence saw the smile he wore. </p><p>Nevertheless, he took Credence’s hand and helped him into the tub. It was big, fit for a man with plenty of room besides, and Credence needed to use a step Gellert had conjured. Credence winced as he climbed in. Apparently he’d only just noticed how sore his limbs were from the transformation. Carefully, he sat down in the tub, the water coming to his midsection, and Gellert saw him slowly, visibly relax. Goosebumps raised across the boy’s flesh before Gellert let go of his hand. Credence sunk down farther, letting the water come up to his chin and his eyes fluttered, nearly closing. </p><p>He wanted to let them, Gellert could tell, but Credence wouldn’t. Not while he was still there. Gellert didn’t mention how rare it must have been for the boy to have a hot bath. Mary Lou had kept her children clean, but it was never a luxury. Icy buckets and a washcloth was all Credence had likely known. </p><p>Gellert reached for a sponge from a rack of soaps and bottles and dipped it into the water. He then took Credence’s hand again and ran the sponge up his arm. Credence watched without expression as he did the same to the other, then had the boy sit up so Gellert could reach his back. When he finished, he handed Credence the sponge. “You get the rest. There’s shampoo and conditioner for your hair and a towel on the rack. I’ll see if I can find you some clothes.” </p><p>Credence didn’t express much reaction, but he nodded. That would have to do. Gellert climbed to his feet and took one last look at the boy turning the sponge over in his hands before dipping it in the water again and running it over his chest, and then turned for the door. He closed it behind himself, although there was really no reason except for assurance that Credence would be alone for a little while. Gellert intended to let the boy come out when he was ready. Just so long as that wasn’t too long. </p><p>He went to his room and pulled out some extra linens. With a bit of transfiguration, he had a simple set of clothes that would fit Credence, along with a nightshirt. When he finished, he moved to the writing desk and began to prepare the letters he’d need to send off now that he’d returned. His own face caught his eye in the dresser mirror before he sat down and it gave him pause. The strange thing was that he was not unused to it. He had been more unused to his own face over the last few days or so. Not so unusual, having spent months as Percival Graves and only returning to himself when he was alone at the end of the day. He shrugged out of it, dropping the charade like water from his skin, glanced at himself and found a paler reflection staring back at him, and then sat down to his letters. </p><p>By the time he’d finished and returned to the living room with the boy’s newly made clothes under his arm, the door to the toilet was still shut and there was nothing to suggest Credence had set foot outside it. Gellert sighed and lifted his hand to the door and paused. He sighed again and with a shrug of his shoulders and a twist of his neck, once more wore the face of Percival Graves. He knocked, but no answer came, so he turned the handle and opened the door. </p><p>The splash of water met his ears before he saw Credence pull his legs to his chest, still sitting in the tub, and lock eyes with Gellert. Gellert shook his head. “You should get out when the water turns cold. You’re probably a prune by now, aren’t you?” Credence looked away, but that didn’t stop Gellert from stepping inside and taking the towel from its rack to hold out to Credence. He raised his brows, and finally Credence took the pointed gesture and stood up to take it. Water dripped from his body, and just as Gellert thought, the boy’s posture suggested he was cold as he dried himself. </p><p>Gellert handed him the nightgown next and Credence took it without question. The boy seemed numb, but Gellert supposed that was preferable to outright hostility. He hadn’t been lying when he told Credence he would need to rest. The boy tugged the long shirt over his head and glanced up at Gellert, not knowing what to make of the silence in such a strange situation. </p><p>“I keep a second bedroom here that you can use,” Gellert said, relieving Credence of the awkwardness and leading him back into the hall. </p><p>The second bedroom was not a bedroom at all. Not yet. Credence looked around at the rows of books piled into shelves covering the walls with a wary curve in his brow. Gellert patted his shoulder and moved around the boy, his wand out, and soon the expansive desk with its piles of papers and maps as well as the magical artefacts littered around the room lifted themselves up and rushed together all at once, shrinking and folding together as though they’d been caught in the gravity of a star until nothing more than a tiny glass marble sat at the centre of the polished wooden floor. Gellert snatched it up and glanced back at the boy, who this time could not hide his fascination. Gellert smiled and then turned to the room again, transfiguring a bed from a few of the chairs he’d left behind. Credence had to move out of the way as new linens and blankets from the other room came floating in to cover it. When it was finished, the only thing Gellert left behind were the bookshelves and he placed Credence’s new clothes there for the morning. If Credence had any interest in looking through the books, the boy was more than welcome. The thought of it even delighted Gellert a little. </p><p>Warily, Credence glanced around the room and then looked from the bed to Gellert. </p><p>“Go on. I’ll leave you to sleep as long as you need to.” Gellert nodded to the bed. </p><p>Credence gave him another cautious look, but moved to its side. Gellert offered a hand and helped him climb up—the bed was adult-sized and bigger even than the one Credence had at the church—but Credence didn’t look at him when they touched. Gellert didn’t let that stop him from tucking the boy in, however. He sat down at the edge of the bed and pulled the covers up to Credence’s chest, but Credence turned away from him and stared at the wall. </p><p>Gellert didn’t let anything but a gentle calm colour his tone when he spoke. “Goodnight, Credence. Don’t be shy to find me when you wake.” He reached out and rubbed the boy’s arm and that time Credence didn’t pull away before he rose to his feet again and went to the door. Credence didn’t move when Gellert paused, knowing that he was watching. All he could see of the boy was a lump under the covers and a tuft of black hair staring at the wall. </p><p>Gellert smiled to himself and closed the door.</p>
