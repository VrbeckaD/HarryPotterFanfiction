    <p>Sirius had his hands deep in his pockets, thumbs hooked over the frayed edges. He doesn’t watch the ground while he walks. He doesn’t have to. Despite the spring rains, the wet earth, strips of mud and clay interspersed with errant stones and roots of trees, he doesn’t expect to slip. To fall.</p><p>He trusts each footfall. Effortlessly. In a way that some people never learn how to trust, yet he executes it with a practiced fielty.</p><p>The rains help to muffle each step, and his progress down the steep path, beyond the Quidditch pitch and through the long grass, still sodden from the earlier shower, goes entirely unnoticed.</p><p>Well. It was the early hours of a Sunday morning, after all, who would be awake to notice him? And the moon was but a half forgotten sliver on the eastern horizon, only now gaining her vantage above the trees. He may as well have been invisible, black hair pulled back into a bun, his jeans wet below the knee, artfully cuffed above black boots.</p><p>Sirius stops at the hillock beyond the pitch. It’s his last vantage before he descends into the forest, before he slips between the gnarled elms and towering oaks, before finding his way along the mountain springs that feed the copse of birch. He watches the moon, hanging there, suspended, a cradle, similarly open to the sky above. Corners sharp. Like his.</p><p>They regard one another. A nightjar calls.</p><p>There’s an unseasonable warmth to the breeze that rustles the tops of trees and lifts the errant strands of hair that Sirius has tucked behind his ear. He closes his eyes and turns ever so slightly into the wind, breathing deeply. His skin is soft in the light reflected from the moon, but his angles, all of his sharp moments, cast shadows, long and deep.</p><p>In a moment, he’s disappeared between the trees. The nightjar calls again.</p><p>In the shadow of the forest, Sirius slows his pace. He reaches out along the rough stretches of a dogwood that’s grown sprawling and carefree in the understory, and the way he runs his hand along the bark is familiar. Like a greeting. He pauses and leans against the old tree, and his head is slightly cocked to one side, as if he’s listening. As if he can hear something beyond the rippling calls of frogs and buzzing insects, the soft hoots and trilling calls of the forest’s nightly chorus.</p><p>He moves away to the west, finding his way down a buck trail that’s half overgrown in the flush of spring. Here, his hands trail along the edges of sprawling forest grape leaves, streaks of dew leaving long, wet traces along his forearms. There’s a little thistle in his hair.</p><p>The moon is higher now, more distant, and Sirius has since found his way to a small glade in the west. The grass is high too, peppered with cornflowers and queen anne’s lace and other small blossoms that have since found a small home in the open field.</p><p>He lays back in the centre of the clearing, flattening the grass around him, his view now only of the distant stars above and the tips of the crescent moon. Foxgloves, heavy with drops of the earlier rain, hang like bells above him, and Sirius lays, not minding the water that has slowly been seeping into his t-shirt. It’s cool, the water, and it grounds him.</p><p>The breeze has remained warm, and the chorus of frogs has only grown louder in the clearing. There must be more water nearby. A stream. A pond. He lays with his hands behind his head, knees bent and wide.</p><p>Time passes, and nightjars sing to each other. Sirius lays and looks at the stars. Occasionally he lifts his chin slightly to the wind and breathes deeply, and when he does his eyes flutter closed for a second.</p><p>Eventually, he speaks.</p><p>“It’s rubbish not being able to hide from you, you know.” He twirls the stem of a forget-me-not between two fingers.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Sirius.” The voice is like sand running over stones in the peaceful softness of the evening. Rough and chaotic. Like it’s been made of a million different things that were never meant to exist together and have since fallen apart.</p><p>Like a real apology. Like a wound.</p><p>Sirius scoffs and flicks the forget-me-not away, sitting up, t-shirt clinging to the lines of his shoulders, his spine, wet from the earth. His back is to the visitor.</p><p>Sirius can hear him move into the clearing from the edge of the trees. He can smell the fern he’s brushed aside, the moss beneath his shoes. Oxfords. Light brown, but so faded. Size eleven. Sirius can imagine all their creases and cracks, the silly design along the toe. He knows the right is worn more than the left, but only slightly.</p><p>“There’s no need to apologise, Remus.” Sirius can feel his hackles rising beneath the t-shirt, and he nearly lets his deep sigh turn into a low, throaty growl when he can hear those stupid shoes moving closer, not soft on the earth like Sirius, but overlarge and ungainly. He hears him nearly trip as his toe catches a fallen branch.</p><p>Sirius rolls his eyes, finally turning to look over his shoulder. He watches the other man with a shrewd expression, eyes narrowed.</p><p>The interloper is tall and poorly proportioned, sandy hair and skin that’s streaked and marred with puckered flesh. His eyes are beautifully green, flecked with brown, and he’s got freckles across his rounder cheeks. He walks with his eyes down, and his hands are splayed, anticipating another miscalculation. A fall. It rounds his shoulders. And thus, his spine. Everything about him seems bent and burdened, like it’s been sanded down, grated. He doesn’t have the sharpness of Sirius. He has the look of a fuller moon.</p><p>“If there wasn’t, I don’t think you’d be out here sulking. Getting all wet and sullen.” Even the way he speaks, he curves around the words. Sirius doesn’t want to hear the smile in his voice. As if tonight was a night for teasing. For softness.</p><p>The other man is meters away. Sirius can smell his aftershave and his regret in equal measure. He doesn’t find it endearing. Not tonight.</p><p>“Maybe it’s not about you, Remus. There are other reasons to be sullen, you know. The moon doesn’t just revolve around you.” Sirius had turned back to the west as he spoke, facing the endless stretch of forest and distant mountains, the sharper moon and the sky.</p><p>There’s silence for a moment. Sirius breaks it with a resigned sigh.</p><p>“That was cruel of me. I’m sorry.” His apology doesn’t sound nearly as broken, but the anger and the sharpness has edged away from his voice. He’s suddenly less cutting. More human.  </p><p>“Sirius, I– “</p><p>“Don’t, Remus. We don’t have to do this. We are friends. It was a mistake to think you wanted more. That we… I didn’t mean anything by it. We don’t need to pretend there’s something here. For fuck’s sake, you’re not even gay.”</p><p>Sirius watches the sky. He sits cross legged and picks another forget-me-not to roll between his fingers. All of the trust he had in his steps has fallen away with the warm wind from the east. He looks suddenly so vulnerable, and all of his posturing and his anger is so clearly just barely covering all of the hurt. All of the fear.</p><p>All of the times he’s been abandoned.</p><p>He watches the sky and tells himself to wash it away. To let it soak into the earth with the spring rains. He does his best not to let anything show, and his face remains placid as he looks at all of the stars. Namesakes. Legacies.</p><p>Sirius hears the Oxfords make their way to just beside him, and Remus folds down onto the ground, long legs crossed, palms flat to the earth as he lowers himself to the wet grass.</p><p>“Don’t be like this, Sirius.” His voice is so quiet and soft and pleading, and it makes Sirius feel as though he’s being unfair. As if all of his feelings are too big. As if all of him is too big. Too much. And then he feels guilty. And ashamed.</p><p>“This is the only way I know how to be, Remus.”</p><p>The placidness in Sirius’s face gives way to a deep and cruel sadness, and his eyes shine with the weight of it. Of being Sirius. Of being gay. Of being too much, with too many feelings. Of being the one who always ends up here. With apologies. Regrets.</p><p>Sirius feels a warm hand around his, fingers threading between. Palms together. Remus’s heart is pounding. He can feel it.</p><p>He can feel all of it. The fear. Just like his. Big and flighty. He looks up and sees that Remus isn’t even looking at him. He’s staring to the south, wetting his lips. His other hand is trembling.</p><p>“Remus.” Sirius can feel himself melt away. He forgets sometimes, how hard it was. How hard it was to admit, even to yourself, that you want someone. Someone this close. A man, even.</p><p>“Fuck, Sirius. You don’t know what it’s like.” He’s still looking away and the tremor is in his throat and around every consonant, but it spares the vowels and they sound like breathy exhales. They remind him of the scattered moments when Remus has let Sirius touch him.</p><p>Sirius is squeezing his hand without meaning to, gaze locked on the outline of Remus’s jaw in the feeble moonlight.</p><p>“I’m not safe. Not for you. Not for anyone. No one should be this close to me. And yet. You won’t give up. You don’t ever give up.” He feels how it breaks him to say those words. How it must have been breaking him for years. Wearing on his very bones. But he doesn’t let go of Sirius’s hand.</p><p>“I’m not scared of you.” He’s said it before, but it feels more real here and now, in the wet grass and the warm wind. With the frogs still calling their mates and the nightjars singing away the loneliness.</p><p>“I’m not scared of you.” He says it again. Because Remus still isn’t looking at him. Because it’s the truth.</p><p>“I’m scared. Of this.” Remus finally turns, and his green eyes with brown flecks are big and wide and he doesn’t say he’s scared of Sirius, with all of his big feelings and intensity, but it’s written all across his face, inked along the scars.</p><p>They look at each other. Sirius, with his haughty face and angles, hair pulled up in a bun, is the first to speak again. </p><p>“I’ll be careful with you.”</p><p>“Sirius –“ But before Remus can rebuild his walls, Sirius is leaning toward him, watching him all the while, eyes flickering between his gaze and his mouth.</p><p>“I’ll be careful.” It’s whispered just between them, just before their lips brush together, soft and tentative. The moment feels delicate.</p><p>It’s Remus who finally closes the gap between them, and he’s finally let go of Sirius’s hand because suddenly he needs more than just their palms flush together. Remus kisses him, and it starts so soft, but quickly builds into something so hungry, something Sirius knows he can’t control.</p><p>And Remus is leaning toward Sirius, laying him back. And Sirius has his hands wrapped up in the cable knit sweater, pulling him closer, wanting the weight of his awkward, lanky frame. Wanting the feel of him. And all the while Remus can’t stop kissing Sirius. </p><p>It’s their first real kiss.</p><p>They have touched before. Behind the faded tapestry with a herd of unicorns that hangs on the second floor corridor, the one that leads to McGonagall’s office. They had ducked behind it to hide from unknown footsteps one night in their sixth year, and in the dark, pressed together, Sirius had slipped his hands around Remus. Around the softness of his stomach, and the scars that flitted across his abdomen. They had pretended it was because the little niche was so small for their nearly adult selves, that’s why Sirius had let his fingers press along and then below the hem of Remus’s trousers, why he’d been flushed and panting. Why they’d stayed there long after the footsteps had died away, Sirius’s breath hot on Remus’s shoulder.</p><p>That had been the first time it had felt different. To Sirius, anyway, but he could feel the change in Remus too. They had found other excuses to be close after that. There were several late nights where they’d fallen asleep sprawled across Sirius’s bed, only to awaken in the small hours of the morning with legs intertwined, bodies close and breath mixing.</p><p>And then there was the detention they’d had together in October of seventh year. In the dungeon, cleaning cauldrons late in the night. Unsupervised. Sirius had taken off his shirt, sweating with the effort of scrubbing the pewter clean. He’d caught Remus staring, told him to come touch him if he’d like. And Remus had. Carefully at first, but then more boldly, tracing the band of Sirius’s pants.</p><p>He’d asked if he could see him naked. If he could touch him. Just to see how it felt. And Sirius had let him. He had leaned back against the potions bench and let Remus undress him, slide his hands over his thighs and then his cock. He’d been still and patient and kept his hands gripping the bench behind him. And Remus had made him come, just like that. They didn’t talk about it afterward.</p><p>Then the cold night they’d snuck out to the Quidditch pitch on the new moon, an empty sky, laying together beneath the goal hoops. They’d held hands, and Remus had asked Sirius if he was gay. How he had known. What he felt when he looked at men. They had parted ways over the Christmas holidays after that. Quiet and unsure.</p><p>Just before the next full moon they were together, the hunger moon, Remus had come to find Sirius in bed. He had been rough and insistent in the way he touched him. Had him naked in his hands. In the way he’d fumbled in the dark and the quiet. The way he’d made Sirius come with his fingers in his ass and his mouth around his cock.</p><p>Again, they didn’t speak after. Sirius didn’t know if it was the just the moon, playing tricks and pulling the tides, and if he was just caught in the undertow, swept out to sea. Or, if it was something else. Something more.</p><p>He had avoided Remus since. Avoided him, until tonight. Until the first sliver after the new moon. And Remus had avoided him, too. They couldn’t seem to look at each other without being overwhelmed. Without hunger. As if the moon had lingered.</p><p>Until now. Until he was kissing him.</p><p>Until he had his knees pressing Sirius’s legs apart so their stomachs were flush together. Until Sirius could feel what’s building between them. More than just the hardness between their legs, more than something primal and consuming.</p><p>Remus’ softness is coming apart, and he pants against Sirius’s neck, his palms splayed wide on the wet earth beneath him, against all of the weight pulling him down. Anchoring him. Tying him to the wet grass and the man beneath him.</p><p>Sirius is rolling his hips up to meet the hardness pressed against him. He can feel whimpers and pleas collecting in his throat, but he’s too busy dragging his tongue across the sunken valley above Remus’ collar bone. Tasting him. Drowning in him. Begging him to fall. To fall apart. To be broken and unthinking. Like Sirius.</p><p>Remus is the one to break the tension. He pushes himself up, sitting back between Sirius’s still splayed knees.</p><p>Sirius does whine, this time, and his hands come up, flat and insistent on his stomach, sliding down to the outline of his cock. He misses the pressure. The weight. It’s as if he thinks his hands can replicate it. Can keep him held back. Held down.</p><p>Remus is watching him. There’s no smile or regret or shame left. He looks hungry. There’s a calmness that has taken him. A dangerous, methodical calm. He reaches up, pulls the sweater from his shoulders and starts undoing the buttons of his shirt. One by one. Eventually, he pulls it from his skin and lays it aside. There’s no more thoughts of the stupid Oxfords and the awkwardness of his frame. There’s no more room for thoughts like that.</p><p>Sirius is watching him, hands still pressed against his cock, whimpers still spilling over his lips. He watches every little movement, watches the fabric peel away. He drinks in all of the scars across the man between his knees, reads them. A history.</p><p>A survival.</p><p>“I’ll be careful.” Sirius finds himself saying. Remus looks up at him from the watch he was slowly removing from his wrist, green eyes flecked with brown.</p><p>Remus is leaning forward again, a hand sliding along Sirius’s stomach, lifting his shirt from his skin, pulling it up and bunching it beneath his arms. Sirius is watching him, mouth parted on panting breaths. It’s mesmerising, seeing Remus like this. Sirius hasn’t noticed that he hasn’t moved his own hands. His right is gripping his cock through his jeans.</p><p>Remus reaches down and his warm hands close around Sirius’s wrists, slowly guiding one, then the other, up above his head. “Don’t move.” Remus whispers in his ear, pulling his wet t-shirt the rest of the way up over his head.</p><p>Sirius can feel his eyes go wide a moment, and he wants to complain. To ask why. To laugh off the idea that he shouldn’t move. That he should be given free access to Remus and his newly naked skin in the starlight. To demand it.</p><p>But he doesn’t. He lets Remus drag his fingernails down his bare stomach and to the line of his pants, while Sirius grips his own hands together above his head. He thinks about being still and leaning against the potions bench. He thinks about the sureness of it. The way Remus had felt emboldened by his stillness. By his offering. By his feeble attempts at control.</p><p>So he grips his own wrists, and he lets his own fingernails leave marks for how tightly he’s focusing on not moving. On not letting go. On not following Remus’s gentle touches against the sharpness of the wings of his pelvis.</p><p>Instead, he lets his hips rock. He lets himself groan. He closes his eyes and arches himself against the soft, wet grass. It’s only when Remus has undone his belt buckle and unzipped his jeans that Sirius falters, that he curls back toward the sky, his right hand coming down to cover Remus’s, which is so torturously just above his cock.</p><p>Remus stills and stares back up at Sirius, who’s whines are low and guttural and breathy. His bun has come loose, and more errant strands of hair have found their way down to edge his sharp features, which are so much softer than before. Softer in the way his cheeks are flushed and his mouth is halfway parted. The way his eyes are big and pleading.</p><p>“Sirius.” And Sirius feels nearly pathetic for how quickly he faltered. How little control he has. How Remus can undo him, just so.</p><p>“Fuck.” He lays back, hands back up behind his head, body stretched beneath the moon, skin soft in it’s light. An offering.</p><p>Remus moves away from him a moment, sitting back. Regarding him. Sirius feels ridiculous. Like he’s being punished. It’s making him feel embarrassed and ashamed. He misses the sureness of his own footfalls.</p><p>Remus rests his hands on Sirius’s ankles. Against the lacing of his boots, his knees still bent. He’s still watching Sirius. Watching the way he struggles, the way he’s now purposely looking away. The way his cheeks are flushed more now, even. And how the redness is creeping along his neck.</p><p>Sirius can feel his gaze and his quiet consideration. It’s maddening. Even more maddening when he feels Remus start unlacing one of his boots. Slowly. Carefully. With decided consideration. He unlaces both. Then pulls them from his feet. Removes his socks.</p><p>The wet grass on the soles of his feet is distracting. It seems to cool him. Ground him. Far more than the warm wind from the east had. He doesn’t feel as desperate and unsure. He lets Remus take his time moving back up to his jeans, which he pulls down his hips. His pants come with them. Sirius is lifting his hips with his bare feet on the cold, wet earth, and seconds later he rests his bare ass down, too. And there he is, naked, hands still held above his head.</p><p>Remus stands. He only takes a moment to drink in the scene before him; Sirius, laid out, hands above his head, cock still hard and ruddied, a smear of mud along his left side, before moving to undo his own belt. Slip his own trousers and pants down from his own hips. To remove those infuriating Oxfords.</p><p>Sirius watches him intently. He can’t feel the cold, wet earth beneath him as much as he can feel the saliva pooling in his mouth. The way seeing Remus like this, hard, naked, exposed. The way it’s burning his skin. The way it’s eating him alive.</p><p>“I want to fuck you.” Remus isn’t looking in Sirius’s face when he says it. He’s looking down at Sirius’s body. At Sirius’s cock. At the way his knees are still drawn up and splayed to the sides. He’s looking down at him and he’s palming his own hardness.</p><p>“I want to fuck you and I don’t want you to move from there. Do you think you can do that?”</p><p>Sirius doesn’t think he can do that. He won’t be able to. Won’t be able to resist grabbing those shoulders while he pushes inside. Won’t be able to stop himself from running his fingers into his hair and grabbing and pulling and using Remus as an anchor. As leverage. He won’t be able to stay grounded and wrapped up in everything they still haven’t spoken about between them.</p><p>“Yes.” He says. Because he can’t say no. Not now. Not with his cock this hard, flush against his stomach. Not with his bare ass on the earth and his legs wide and waiting. Not with this kind of need piled up within him. Not with the chance he will fail. He will fail and Remus can punish him.</p><p>Punish him and fuck him into the wet earth.</p><p>The last thought makes his cock twitch and seep pre-cum into the fold of his hip. He nearly moves. Nearly reaches down to wet his fingers in it and run them across his frenulum. He doesn’t. He grips his own wrists.</p><p>Remus kneels between Sirius’s bare legs. He lets both of his palms slide across the expanse of Sirius’s ribs, the dip down to the flare of his hips. His skin is so bright in the dark. Remus leans down and licks the wetness that has seeped from the head of Sirius’s cock, and the sound Remus makes isn’t human.</p><p>Sirius keens and lifts his hips. “Fuck me already, Remus.” And then a moment’s pause before, “Please.”</p><p>The begging is new. It feels strange. Not like himself. Like he’s someone else, now. Someone apart from his daytime self. This person who wanders out into the forest in the dark of a sliver moon – who trusts his footfalls and trusts this man. Who lays naked on the cold earth before him. Who can’t think for want. For need. For servitude of pleasure. Who begs.</p><p>This is not the same Sirius who walks in daylight. Confident, arrogant Sirius. Sirius who is snide and conniving. Who is sharp and witty and excellent in his charm work, magic and otherwise.</p><p>Sirius can feel how Remus smiles into the soft skin of his belly, and his breath is warm like the wind from the east.</p><p>“It’s going to hurt.” Remus has slipped his hands around behind Sirius’s hips and is gently kneading his ass. Grabbing handfuls of flesh and spreading them apart. There’s a slow rhythm to it. It’s gentle and insistent.</p><p>It’s maddening. It’s nowhere near what Sirius needs.</p><p>“Please, Remus.” Sirius wants the pain, too. He wants to feel every second of the stretch of Remus. He wants it to ruin him. To be as painful as the waiting for it. All these months. Years. All the fantasies. He wants to feel them all in the first time they fuck. Every moment should match the agony of waiting. Of waiting for this man. For this moment.</p><p>He wants to feel it for days. He wants to feel broken by it. He wants it to haunt him.</p><p>Remus is kissing along the inside of his thigh. Too soft, Sirius thinks. He knows why Remus won’t bite him, won’t lend his teeth to the flesh of his inner thigh. Won’t mark him. Sirius wonders for a moment what he can convince Remus to do to him closer to the moon. Closer to the wolf. But, not tonight. Tonight he said he’d be careful. He’ll keep his word. He’ll try, anyway. He grips his wrists. Hard.</p><p>Remus is lifting Sirius’s hips up, pushing his thighs back, staring down at Sirius’s ass before him. Spread. Waiting. Eager.</p><p>Sirius can feel the cold of the dew that’s mixing with sweat along his back. He winds his fingers into a clump of long, wicker grass, thick and strong. He doesn’t want to disappoint Remus. He doesn’t want to move.</p><p>He can feel Remus running the head of his cock along his ass, can hear the whispered charm for lubrication, one they’d all learned together, giggling and red-faced, in the library in fourth year. He wants to laugh, but maybe that’s just the nerves. They both pause. It breaks the tension for a moment. Suddenly, it’s just the frogs and the nightjars and their small, shallow breaths in the clearing. In the wet grass. In the warm east wind.</p><p>“Ready?” Remus speaks first. His eyes are bright and clear and the head of his cock is pressed up against Sirius’s hole. He’s pushed Sirius’s thighs back toward his chest. The muddy sole of one of Sirius’s bare feet rests over Remus’s shoulder. His other leg has fallen to the side, knee splayed out, but he doesn’t feel uneven. He feels pliant and malleable in Remus’s sure hands. He isn’t tremulous at all. The thought calms Sirius.</p><p>Sirius breathes out, nodding. He tightens his grip in the grass, the long, sinewy strands wrapped around his fingers. It’s damp against his palms.</p><p>Remus presses forward, leaning his weight into Sirius. He feels the slide of his cock into the tight ring of his ass and it <strong>hurts</strong>. Stings. For a moment, they lay still. Sirius has his eyes squeezed tightly shut and he has to concentrate on relaxing. On not curling up, pulling away. Not letting go of the wet grass.</p><p>It’s Remus’s voice that finally cuts through the pain. “Fuck, you feel good.” The tremor isn’t in Remus’s hands, but it is in his voice. He sounds as pained as Sirius feels. He sounds as broken. Sirius opens his eyes to look up at him, to memorise that sound. The words. The tremor. The pain. His cock is throbbing with interest. With the rush of blood. With the praise falling from Remus’s uncoordinated lips.   </p><p>Remus has his eyes closed and he’s turned his head to kiss along Sirius’s calf. To mouth at it. Wet and unthinking. “You feel so good.” He says it again, mumbled and half incoherent. He looks inhuman. Sirius is hard. Through the pain and the fullness and the inexorable press of Remus inside of him, he has to focus on not reaching down and stroking his cock. Remus presses further, eyes closed and his brow creased in desperate concentration.</p><p>Sirius has done this to him. The pain is ebbing away into the night, just like the cold, just like the winds of winter. The soreness gives way to fullness. Gives way to the hungry insistence of Remus and his cock. The pain is replaced with something secretive and tantalizing. Something full of heat. Something that’s smouldering. Burning. And Sirius is letting it consume him.</p><p>“Sirius.” It’s a growl. Frustrated and pained and oh, so broken. It’s like music.</p><p>Sirius stares up at Remus and his wavering, snarling voice and his sloppy kisses and the way he can’t stop grabbing for his skin, touching and kneading and pulling it aside. The way he can’t help but groan as he leans a bit more against Sirius and his cock slides a bit deeper. Until his skin is flush against Sirius’s ass. Until there is no more depth. Until his cock is fully inside.</p><p>Remus lets his teeth drag across the skin of his leg, now, and Sirius can feel the ridges of his canines.</p><p>“Remus.” Sirius sounds soft and careful and quiet. Not like Sirius at all. Like someone new. Like someone no one would ever expect Sirius to be. Suddenly, there’s so much room for Sirius. For him to be everything he is, wide and resplendent beneath the wolf and the moon in equal measure.  </p><p>Remus’s eyes open at his voice. He’s still panting but he’s staring down at the man below him, the man he’s fucked into as deeply as he can. The man who has let him. He’s still and desperate and just so overwhelmed. It’s beautiful.</p><p>“Touch me.” Sirius says it less as a plea and more as an invitation. He wants them to come together. So they can be messy and untangled. So he can ruin all that control. So they both can fall to pieces together.</p><p>His words have the vulnerability of Remus’s earlier apology. The rawness. The qualities of a wound. Deep and painful and gaping open. That’s how Sirius feels when he asks for Remus to touch him. To allow him a glimpse of the pleasure. To let them both revel in it. In Sirius’s vulnerability and Remus’s fear. And Sirius’s big feelings and how much they rule him, even while he pretends to be king. While he trusts himself to never fall. Only to drown.</p><p>Remus brings his hand down and slides his rough palms over the length of Sirius’s cock. Circles it, like he would his own. The motion is unhurried, familiar. He lets it mesmerise him for long moments, and Sirius lets his head fall back, lets himself feel everything. All of it.</p><p>The pressure and the pleasure and the vastness of the sky above him with the cradle moon and the wolf kneeling between his legs and the nightjars and the frogs and the wet grass and the warm wind, all of it so desperate and beautiful and serene. And Sirius is panting and moaning and all of his pleasure seems to drift off into the night. And there’s no reason for him to be quiet. To not let every little feeling draw something from him, to make every exhale gorgeous and full. No need for him to silence himself. To reel himself in.</p><p>No, this moment is about expanding into the void. Into the space. The openness.</p><p>It isn’t long before Remus is rolling his hips in time with his palm and mocking the slide of his thumb with the slow press of his cock, fucking Sirius open. Sirius still has his hands wrapped in the grass, with his numbing fingers, relaxed a bit now, relaxed as his hips and his thighs, one still splayed to the side, one draped across Remus, nearly lazy now in the slowness of the sex.  </p><p>“I won’t break, Remus.” Sirius is bereft as Remus pulls back, slowly, carefully, with so much gentleness. He misses the pain. “You don’t have to be so careful. I’m the one who promised.”</p><p>Remus is looking down at him, tense and beautiful and trembling. His teeth have grazed rivers into the soft flesh of Sirius’s calf, and the hand not preoccupied with his cock, the one wrapped around his thigh, steadying his hips, those nails have left long marks across his flesh.</p><p>“Sirius, I-.”</p><p>“Fuck me like you mean it, Remus. Like you want this. With me. Like I’m not a mistake.”  Their eyes lock on Sirius’s words. Remus is growling, his face darkening. Anger blossoms between them and suddenly the fragility of what they have, their friendship, something more, it’s bright and fearful between them.</p><p>Remus is folding Sirius beneath him on his next exhale, his hips pressing into him, hard and fast, fucking him properly. Fucking him into the earth. Fucking him like it’s punishment for making it real. For tainting their fantasy. For reminding each other there’s a world outside the forest. A world where they’re friends. Where Remus is straight. And so is Sirius.</p><p>He’s fucking him fast and hard and relentlessly and Sirius is breathless with it. Like he can’t breathe. Like he can’t think. Like he can’t feel anything but everything and nothing all at once. Mindless and broken and endless, here beneath the universe of the night sky.</p><p>Eventually his eyes are closed and the pleasure rolls over him in such relentless and all consuming waves, he can’t help but let go.
