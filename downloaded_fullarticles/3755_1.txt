    <p>"Yes, yes. I understand…. Certainly…. Rosecross Academy?... That's fine… Yes, yes… Is three boys and one girl acceptable?... Good. I'll inform them of their mission… You want my deputy to come as well? Yes, that can be arranged… More staff?... A Care of Magical Creatures Professor? Certainly. I have just the people… No, that won't leave us understaffed… I can cover for my deputy… Yes… Is that all, Professor Dumbledore? Good. So in a week's time? Yes, that will give us ample time to arrive. Thank you. Yes, you can count on us… Goodbye, Professor."</p><p>Lenalee entered the room as Komui put down the phone.</p><p>"I have your coffee, brother," she said.</p><p>"My darling Lenaleeeee! Your coffee is always welcome!" the sister complex shrieked, lunging for his younger sibling, who dodged and put the coffee on the table. He pouted.</p><p>"Who were you talking to?" she asked as her brother sat back down.</p><p>"Hmm? Oh! That was Professor Dumbledore, Headmaster at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He requires our services. Can you fetch Allen, Kanda, Lavi, Klaud and Reever?"</p><p>"Of course," Lenalee said, and ran out of the room to find her comrades. She found Allen where she expected to. In the cafeteria, chatting to Lavi.</p><p>"Ah! Lenalee!" Lavi shouted, catching sight of her as she made her way towards them. Allen waved as he stopped shovelling food into his mouth and attempted to swallow.</p><p>"Lavi, Allen," she acknowledged. "After you've finished eating, Brother needs to see you in his office – both of you. We have a mission."</p><p>"The three of us?" Allen asked having swallowed his mouthful of food.</p><p>"And Kanda, General Klaud and Reever," Lenalee replied.</p><p>"Reever?" Lavi asked. "Why him?"</p><p>"I don't know. Now hurry up! I'm off to look for the others." And with that she left, heading towards the dojo where she expected to find Kanda. Again, she was correct and found him sitting on the floor, meditating.</p><p>"What is it?" he asked when she made no move to either join him or go away.</p><p>"We have a mission and Nii-san wants you to go to his office now," she replied.</p><p>"What about you?" he asked as he stood, retrieving Mugen from where it lay next to him.</p><p>"I've got to get everyone else," she said.</p><p>"Who? And don't say Moyashi," Kanda inquired.</p><p>"I've already fetched him and Lavi-" Kanda groaned "- I need to get Klaud and Reever."</p><p>"Reever?" Kanda asked. "And how many of us are going?" he added as he walked towards the door.</p><p>"Six of us. And I have no idea why Reever is coming as well," Lenalee said as she too left, this time in search of the only female general.</p><p>Once again, her women's intuition was proved correct as she found General Klaud and Lau Jimin bathing in the women's communal baths.</p><p>"General Klaud?" Lenalee said, making her presence known to the older female.</p><p>"Yes, Lenalee?" the blonde asked. "Keep washing, Lau," she added to her Parasite Beast.</p><p>"We have a mission so Brother would like to see you in his office as soon as possible," Lenalee replied.</p><p>"I'll be there shortly. Will you wait for me or are there others you need to round up?" the general asked.</p><p>"I have one more person to collect," Lenalee said and exited the baths as the blonde waited for Lau Jimin to finish cleaning itself.</p><p>This time, Lenalee didn't need women's intuition to know where she would find Reever. She headed straight for the lab where she knew she would find an exhausted, sleep-deprived Reever Wenhamm working on some experiment or other.</p><p>"Reever!" she called. The Australian looked up at Lenalee and sighed in disappointment when he saw that she didn't come bearing the life-saving liquid known as coffee. "Brother wants to see you in his office," she informed him.</p><p>"Why?" he asked as he followed her towards Komui's office.</p><p>"I'm not sure, but I think you'll be coming with me and a few others on a mission," she said. He looked just as confused as she was.</p><p>"Reever's here, Brother," Lenalee announced as she entered the office with the science chief in tow. Everyone else, including General Klaud who, miraculously, did <em>not</em> look like she had just emerged from the bath, was there already. Klaud had claimed the sofa, while Allen and Lavi were hovering nearby. Kanda was standing in the corner nearest the door, trying to keep his distance. Reever went to stand by Allen and Lavi, while Klaud offered Lenalee a seat next to her on the sofa, which the girl accepted.</p><p>"So what is this mission and why are there so many of us?" Klaud asked Komui while Lau Jimin chattered quietly on her shoulder. "Hush, Lau."</p><p>Komui cleared his throat, just to make sure he had everyone's attention as Kanda was leaning against the wall with his eyes closed. Irritated, the Japanese opened his eyes to glare at him.</p><p>I received a phone call from a man called Professor Albus Dumbledore concerning a major upcoming event in the wizarding world," he started.</p><p>"What?" Allen interrupted.</p><p>"Wizarding world?" Kanda demanded. "There's no such thing as wizards."</p><p>"Innocence is not that different to magic," Lavi informed him.</p><p>"A-<em>hem</em>," Klaud said, effectively preventing an argument from being born. "Komui, continue."</p><p>"There have been various sightings of machine-type things, which we and Dumbledore know to be akuma, for nigh on half a century in their 'world' but their numbers have recently drastically increased and so it is getting unsafe for anyone to travel without risk of being attacked. In light of this, Dumbledore has called for the reinstating of a major event, the Triwizard Tournament, in order to gather the students from the three most prestigious wizarding schools under one roof. He has asked me if I would send some exorcists and Black Order personnel, under the guise of a fourth school, to act as bodyguards for the students, in particular the 'champion' from each school."</p><p>"'Champion'?" Lavi asked.</p><p>"This is a Tournament, and as such, one student from each school is chosen to compete in three highly dangerous tasks to gain honour for their school," Komui explained. "Professor Dumbledore has asked me if I would supply four exorcists of school age, and exorcist to pose as a teacher, and another Black Order personnel to pose as headmaster. The subject our 'teacher' is obliged to teach is 'Care of Magical Creatures', which is why I thought of you, General Klaud. Reever will pose as the headmaster, and your 'Potions teacher' while Allen, Kanda, Lavi and Lenalee will be the students and bodyguards."</p><p>"Why will we have to act as bodyguards?" Kanda asked. "Can't we just go in, destroy the akuma, and then go again?"</p><p>"That's effectively what we are doing," Komui replied. "But the fewer people that know about exorcists the better. This is an effective disguise for us to adopt."</p><p>"So how long does this tournament last?" Lenalee asked.</p><p>"The three tasks are spread over an academic year," Komui replied. "And you will be there for the entire school year."</p><p>"<em>What</em>!" Kanda exploded. "A year-long mission as a bodyguard! What sort of nonsense is that?"</p><p>Komui sighed.</p><p>"In order for you to appear as inconspicuous as possible, you will have to stay there the year. Besides, Klaud will be teaching for an entire year so it's only right that the rest of you are as well."</p><p>"So when do we leave?" Allen asked.</p><p>"Today. As soon as you're packed. It will take you a week to arrive there. Professor Dumbledore will have your cover story sorted and will have covered your tracks as best he can to prevent some of his more inquisitive and intelligent students finding out about you. All I know is that you will be called Rosecross Academy of Combat Magic and use a special type of 'magic' – which is how you will have to refer to your innocence – to explain your lack of magical skills and wands."</p><p>Kanda scowled.</p><p>"Now – go and pack and gather by the boat in one hour." One by one, they all left the room.</p><p>"Lenaleeeeeeeeee!" Komui cried suddenly. "You don't have to goooooooo! I can send someone else instead-"</p><p>The emerald-haired girl sighed.</p><p>"I'm going, Brother. See you in a year," she said. "Aren't you glad to be rid of Allen and Kanda's arguments for a year?" she added as she walked out the door.</p><p>An hour later, Komui made his way to the boat with six reasonably parcels, arriving just in time to catch them before they left.</p><p>"Here is something you will need at Christmas," he said, handing them each a parcel with their name on it. "No, don't open them yet – wait until you arrive," he said as Lavi started to pick at the paper. Crestfallen, yet intrigued, Lavi left the mysterious thing wrapped.</p><p>"Now, off you go!" Komui said, and watched as they boarded the boat and left.</p><p>"I wonder what these are," Allen said, prodding his parcel. "It's soft."</p><p>"Either a Christmas present or some other useless thing," Kanda replied, scowling at his parcel, which he had put on top of his suitcase.</p><p>"Now, now," Klaud said. "Behave. I don't tolerate disobedience, and I would like to make sure that you remember that you answer to first Reever, then me, on this mission."</p><p>"Sure, Genera Klaud!" Lavi said. Kanda <em>tch</em>ed but didn't say anything.</p><p>"And as much as I distrust Komui's inventions, I'm more inclined to believe that these are some form of clothing required at Christmas," Klaud continued as though they hadn't responded. Lau Jimin chattered in agreement on her shoulder.</p><p>"What am I going to do for food?" Allen wondered suddenly. "If they have to feed three schools as well as us, will there be enough food for me?"</p><p>"It's a school of <em>magic</em>, Moyashi," Kanda scoffed. "I'm sure they can conjure up enough food even for your gluttonous appetite."</p><p>"It's <em>Allen</em>, BaKanda!" Allen retorted. "And it's not my fault I need to eat so much!"</p><p>"<em>Guys</em>," Lenalee said, noticing Reever's pale face as he realised that he would have to put up with the bickering for a year.</p><p>"Tch."</p><p>The journey took a week, Reever in particular bemoaning Allen's inability to form an arc gate somewhere he had never been before. Eventually, tired and fed up of the weird looks they were getting from their uniform from wizards, and having fended off the occasional low level akuma, the six travellers finally arrived at Hogwarts.</p><p>"Whoa!" was Lavi's first thought, a sentiment shared by the entire group, although some (see: Kanda) were less obvious about it.</p><p>"I'm pleased that you are impressed, master...?" a man with long, white hair and crescent-moon glasses said, amused.</p><p>"Lavi, Bookman junior," Lavi replied. "Would I be correct in assuming that I am talking with Professor Albus Dumbledore?"</p><p>"You would be indeed," Dumbledore said with a twinkle in his eye. "Now, I doubt that you are in charge of this group, so wouldn't it be a good idea to get into the habit of deferring to your superiors for this mission?"</p><p>Abashed, Lavi looked down.</p><p>"Serves you right, baka usagi," Kanda muttered.</p><p>"I am Reever Wenhamm, Science Chief at the Black Order," Reever said. "With me are Exorcist General Klaud Nine, who will fill the role of Care of Magical Creatures Professor for the year, and Exorcists Allen Walker, Lenalee Lee, Yu Kanda and Lavi."</p><p>"It is a pleasure to meet you," Dumbledore said. "I am Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts. With me are some of our teaching and support staff: Professor Minerva McGonagall," a stern woman who despite her clear age had a steel not easily denied, "Deputy Headmistress, Head of Gryffindor and Transfiguration Professor, Professor Severus Snape," a man with greasy black hair and a hooked nose who regarded them all with unimpressed black eyes, "Head of Slytherin and Potions Master, Professor Filius Flitwick," a diminutive teacher who had to raise a hand to be noticed and was clearly not human, "Head of Ravenclaw and Charms Professor, Professor Pomona Sprout," a rotund and motherly looking figure, "Head of Hufflepuff and Herbology Professor, Argus Filch," an aged man who seemed as if a scowl was the closest he could get to a smile, "Caretaker, Madame Poppy Pomfrey," a pleasant looking woman who clearly had no tolerance for mischief, "Head nurse and Rubeus Hagrid," a literal giant of a man, but unintimidating past that, "Keeper of keys and grounds of Hogwarts and our Care of Magical Creatures Professor." Each member of staff inclined their head when their name was mentioned, except Hagrid, who waved enthusiastically. "We will be the only Hogwarts staff to know of your true purpose here. Professor Igor Karkaroff, High Master of Durmstrang, and Madame Olympe Maxime, Headmistress of Beauxbatons, have also been informed."</p><p>Reever and Klaud acknowledged each member of staff before the general spoke.</p><p>"What types of creatures will I be dealing with?" she inquired. "And what will happen to my comrades until their presence is required?"</p><p>"You would be best off talking to Hagrid about the creatures. He has a schedule already drawn up, but with the tournament his duties as groundskeeper will be more time consuming than normal. As for your comrades, I have had some quarters prepared for you, which involves individual rooms, a dojo and a common room which contains a lot of books. We feel that it would be best for you to remain out of sight until the other schools arrive, although I assume that you will want to familiarise yourselves with the area?" Dumbledore replied. The exorcists nodded. "We have a week until school starts, and you can spend that time cleaning the area of any akuma and familiarising yourselves with the terrain. Hagrid will inform you about what is usual in the Forbidden Forest – so named because we try to discourage our students from entering it as it is full of dangers. Once school has started I would ask that you keep your rounds until after the students' curfew – but please still be cautious as a few of the students like to go out for midnight wanderings…" Snape muttered something under his breath that sounded like <em>Potter and his friends</em>. "We will also spend some time briefing you about the wizarding world as it is imperative that you understand how this society works, and famous figures you should be aware of." Again, Snape muttered <em>Potter</em>.</p><p>Reever thanked him and they were about to head into the castle when Madame Pomfrey coughed.</p><p>"Ah! Thank you, Poppy," Dumbledore exclaimed. "As we thought that you are highly unlikely to escape any form of injury or ailment during your year here, Madame Pomfrey will need to know about your medical history and how your bodies heal as we are not sure that our usual treatments will be as effective as we would wish."</p><p>The exorcists all agreed – Kanda albeit reluctantly and after a lot of consideration. Despite not wanting to let the witches and wizards know about his curse, he knew the sensibility of the suggestion.</p><p>"If you'll all follow me then, sirs and ma'ams," Filch said, "I'll show you to your living quarters now."</p><p>None of the Black Order Personnel had any objections so they followed the squib into the majestic castle. The first shock they had was of the moving, talking pictures.</p><p>"Hello there, new are you?" a young lady said kindly, making Allen jump.</p><p>"Ta-talking pictures?" he gasped?</p><p>"This is the wizarding world, young sir," Filch said.</p><p>Just as they went round the corner it was Kanda's turn to get a fright as he walked right through a ghost and experienced a rather unpleasant chill. Lavi burst out laughing at his expression until the Japanese recovered and drew Mugen, swearing to kill him. He was quickly pacified by Lenalee.</p><p>"I do beg your pardon," the ghost said. Kanda glared at him. "I do believe that you are the exorcists, am I correct?" Klaud nodded. "Well then, if I may be so bold as to give you a warning – keep an eye out for Peeves, the resident poltergeist. He loves playing pranks on newcomers such as yourselves."</p><p>"Thank you, err…" Lenalee said.</p><p>"Oh! I am being rude and neglecting to introduce myself. I am Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, ghost of Gryffindor."</p><p>"Nearly-headless Nick to everyone else," Filch explained.</p><p>"Nearly-headless?" Lavi inquired. "Oof!" he said as Lenalee elbowed him harshly.</p><p>"Sorry, that was very rude of him," she apologised.</p><p>"I am used to it," Nick said. He yanked on his hair and Kanda narrowed his eyes as he saw the neck was almost completely severed. "Executioner made a hash of beheading me properly. It took him forty-five tries to kill me," he explained. Lenalee covered her mouth with her hands.</p><p>"That's horrible!" she gasped.</p><p>"Now if you're done chatting to ghosts," Filch said "I can continue showing you to your quarters." Lenalee bid farewell to the ghost as they followed Filch down a maze of corridors.</p><p>"I'm going to get so lost," Allen moaned. Lavi laughed at him. "It's not funny!" he snapped.</p><p>"Yes it is, Moyashi," Kanda said, looking back from where he walked besides Filch.</p><p>"It's <em>Allen</em>, BaKanda!" Allen retorted.</p><p>"Whatever."</p><p>Eventually, they arrived at a portrait of a young woman who introduced herself as April Rose.</p><p>"Cherry Drops," Filch said. She smiled and swung forwards to reveal a large room with a fireplace, comfy chairs, tables and <em>lots</em> of books. Lavi's visible eye lit up at the sight. "You can each choose your own password," Filch said. "Cherry Drops is the Headmaster's temporary one." The exorcists and Reever nodded in understanding. Lavi headed straight for the books and made to open one – <em>Hogwarts: A History</em>.</p><p>"Lavi," Lenalee said. "Perhaps it would be a good idea to choose your room first and unpack." Lavi looked up to see that they others had grabbed their luggage and were heading towards doors embedded in the wall. Kanda opened a door that looked slightly different to the others and Lavi laughed at the irony. He'd found the dojo. Glowering at the junior Bookman, Kanda closed that door and opened the one next to it. They soon discovered that all the rooms were identical. Each contained a four-poster bed, a wardrobe, a desk and a chair. There was a large window with a sill wide enough to sit on in the wall opposite the door. Another door opened into a small bathroom.</p><p>Upon entering his room, Kanda propped Mugen up against the bed as he opened his suitcase. First, he picked up his lotus flower, that Komui had insisted he take to keep an eye on it, which he placed on the desk. Next, a stand for Mugen so that it would be less likely to fall over in the night. Sword polish and other products with the clear purpose of caring for Mugen were placed on the desk. A hair brush and spare hairties entered the bathroom along with toothbrush and other necessities. Finally, he unpacked his clothes, placing them neatly on hangers in the wardrobe. He then remembered the parcel that Komui had given him, still out in the common room, and left to, grudgingly, retrieve it.</p><p>Allen bounced on his bed a few times before doing anything else. Once that urge was sated, he unpacked his luggage – clothes into the wardrobe, food onto the desk along with some books for if he had nothing to do and his necessities into the bathroom. He then also remembered the package from Komui and went back out to get it.</p><p>Lavi opened his suitcase to reveal book after book after book. These were piled on the desk, then onto the windowsill and the floor when he ran out of space on the desk. He managed to squeeze his necessities onto the desk as well – <em>somehow</em>. The crumpled clothes at the bottom of the suitcase were thrown messily into the wardrobe before he too headed back out to collect the mysterious package.</p><p>Lenalee took great care with unpacking her clothes, carefully putting them on individual hangers in the wardrobe. She also retrieved a few items of make-up and other necessities, placing them neatly in her bathroom. A diary and a collection of pens sat on the desk as she did her best to make it look like home – which it would be for a year. She too re-entered the common room to fetch her package.</p><p>Klaud prioritised Lau Jimin's belongings before her own, retrieving the grooming kit and arranging it neatly on her desk, putting her own necessities in the bathroom. Her whip sat on the desk, coiled neatly. Like the others, she put her clothes in the wardrobe before exiting to claim her parcel from Komui.</p><p>Reever put his clothes away and put his necessities in the bathroom, relishing in a clean room without paper strewn everywhere. He placed some books on the desk as well, fiction mainly, as well as a notepad and various pens. Like everyone else, he also went back out to retrieve the parcel.</p><p>They all emerged from their respective rooms at the same time, determined to find out what their 'present' from Komui was. Each of them ripped the paper off and stared at what fell out.</p><p>Kanda had a traditional, black, Japanese kimono with sparkly black thread creating patterns of lotus flowers.</p><p>Allen had a traditional black, English, suit complete with top hat, to his amusement. It wasn't too similar to his normal attire, just slightly smarter and pristine.</p><p>Lavi also had a black, English, suit, but without the hat. A note attached informed him that he was not to wear a bandana with the outfit.</p><p>Lenalee had a Chinese dress, emerald in colour with golden dragonflies embroidered all over it.</p><p>Klaud had a long, silver dress with a slit from her hip. It was obviously skin tight and had a generous neck line.</p><p>Reever had the same outfit as Lavi, only in navy blue.</p><p>"What are these for?" Allen wondered.</p><p>"I'm sure we'll find out later," Klaud said. "In the meantime, I suggest that we put these in our wardrobes to keep them clean – Komui must have had a good reason for giving these to us."</p><p>They all did so, Kanda glowering at the kimono that looked so out of place next to his spare uniform, white shirts and black trousers. They then gathered to inspect the dojo which, Kanda was pleased to see, had a smaller room attached. Obviously Dumbledore had been informed of his meditation habits. The room was well built, and they got the feeling that not even the Innocence would break the walls. There was a knock on the door, and Dumbledore entered.</p><p>"Would you like a tour of the school?" he inquired. "General Klaud, you will be taking your classes outside, near the forest, and I thought you might like to know where the Great Hall and my office are." The Black Order personnel agreed and followed him.</p><p>Another shock was in store for them – in the form of moving staircases. Just as they stepped on a flight to travel downstairs, the steps moved, causing Lavi to yelp in surprise. Kanda scowled at the steps as though they were committing a grave sin.</p><p>"Hee hee hee!" a snide voice called from above them, the only warning before small objects such as chalk were hurled at them. "Newbies! What fun! And they're earrrrrrrrlllly!" A diminutive ghost appeared and blew a raspberry at them. Kanda drew Mugen and Peeves – for that was who it was – laughed. "Muggle weapons won't hurt meeeeeee, not Peevesy!"</p><p>"Peeves!" another voice thundered, and there was a rattle of chains as another ghost appeared, covered in blood. Reever gasped quietly.</p><p>"Sorry, your Bloodiness, sir," the poltergeist said, bowing low before speeding off. The bloody ghost huffed in annoyance.</p><p>"I apologise, Headmaster," he said. "He should not treat guests that way." He turned to the exorcists and Reever. "I am known as the Bloody Baron, ghost of Slytherin." And with that he left.</p><p>"Not much of a talker," Lavi murmured to Allen, who grinned and glanced at Kanda.</p><p>"Who does he remind you of?" he commented. Lavi laughed.</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>They entered the Great Hall and Lavi whistled in admiration.</p><p>"Nice ceiling – that <em>is</em> a ceiling right, not the open sky?" he said. Dumbledore smiled. You are correct, it is an illusion made by magic. This is where we eat our meals. Now I will take you to the kitchen to meet our cooks." Allen brightened considerably.</p><p>"Food?" he said hopefully. Dumbledore chuckled.</p><p>"I was informed of your appetite, Mr. Walker," he said. "We have decided that it would be best for everyone if you would eat your main breakfast before the school eats and dinner afterwards, and enjoy an average-sized mean with the rest of us."</p><p>"<em>Two</em> breakfasts and dinners!" Allen exclaimed. "Brilliant!" Lenalee smiled at her friend while Kanda <em>tch</em>ed in irritation.</p><p>They walked to the kitchens – Lavi was quite intrigued by the tickling of a pear to gain access – and were astounded at the sight of hundred of house elves.</p><p>"Whoa!" Lavi said. "So these little guys prepare all the food for the castle? That's impressive."</p><p>"House elves enjoy work above everything else," Dumbledore explained. "They are happy to do it."</p><p>The house elves were delighted with Allen, having learnt that he was the one with the amazing appetite, and refused to let them leave without food. Kanda had ensured that there would be soba for him at every meal, much to the amusement of the others. The house elves were delighted with the challenge of a new dish to make.</p><p>After an exhausting tour of the castle, and a long conversation between Klaud and Hagrid, it was time to retire, Kanda slightly miffed that there hadn't been time to train. They all lay in bed that night, wondering just how strange the following year would be. They had no idea.</p>
