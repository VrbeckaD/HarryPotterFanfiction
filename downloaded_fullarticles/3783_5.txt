    <p>Disclaimer: I don't own Harry potter or the hobbit</p><p>Looking around at their table in the Greenwood, Aurora Black, formerly Potter, smiled feeling content. She looked up as her brother Harry told another tale of their adventures on their former world. Harry made sure to make the twins older brother James sound as much of an idiot as he was. Her honorary uncle Remus Lupin was talking to Lady Galadriel and Lord Elrond about healing magic.</p><p>The werewolf was very interested in that subject, since it had helped him very much with his "hairy little problem". He would still turn into a wolf, but his transformations were now painless and he would never again be able to turn on the people he cared about Aurora took a bite from the food that Dobby had prepared for her. While the king's servants had found it strange to see Dobby in the beginning, they had quickly realised that he made their jobs a little bit easier. </p><p>Their guests were all very important people, from Lady Galadriel to Gandalf the Grey. The kind wizard had come instead of Saruman the White, but Aurora didn't mind. To be honest, the white wizard always gave her bad chills down her spine. But he was very powerful and if anything, she could respect that. All of their guests knew the story of the siblings and to say they were displeased with their former family would be an understatement.</p><p>They could not believe how two parents would abandon their children like that. That they would favour another over them. Aurora's husband had Legolas from his former marriage, but he would treat any of his children equally. Looking at her husband, Aurora smiled at him and slowly stroked his blonde hair. He caught her hand and kissed her fingertips, looking at her with love in his eyes.</p><p>It had taken her quite a while to thaw his heart, but it was worth it. Leaning in to give him a kiss, she smiled at hearing her brother pause his tale just to complain about them kissing. It was a shame that she couldn't throw something to him as she used to, but she didn't complain. Resting her head on her husband's shoulder, Aurora couldn't help, but think of how they got here. They had been the younger children of James and Lily Potter. Their brother James Jr was a year older than they were.</p><p>When they were born, a prophecy had been made, that someone would defeat the dark lord Voldemort. Their family had gone into hiding, but Voldemort had found them. He had stunned their parents and tried to kill the twins, who were destined to stop him. However through some powerful magic, the curse had rebounded and hit Voldemort.</p><p>But through absolute idiocy of the so called "leader of the light" Albus Dumbledore, everyone thought that James had defeated the dark wizard. James was treated as a hero and the twins were carted off to the Dursleys, so that they wouldn't "distract their saviour". Aurora rolled her eyes at that. They had lived at the Dursleys for five years, being abused and treated like slaves, before getting saved by their brother's godfather Sirius Black. He had found them and had taken them in.</p><p>Going from an abusive family to a loving family, had been quite the adjustment. The twins had clung to each other at first, but with lots of patience, they had become a close family. When Sirius had found out about the abuse, he was furious and made sure that the Potters would never find the twins again. He had been looking for them ever since he found out what the Potters had done.He had raised them, together with the twins' godfather Remus Lupin. The two men had made sure the twins were safe and happy.</p><p>After a while, Remus and Sirius had gotten married in a private ceremony.At 11 years old, the two siblings had gone to Hogwarts. Harry had been sorted into Slytherin, while Aurora had gone to Ravenclaw. The next few years had gone by, dodging their former family, who had let the fame go to their heads and had pretty much become, as Aurora's friend Luna put it: "rich bullies".</p><p>They also had to put up with Dumbledore, who was clearly convinced that the Potters could do no wrong and everyone from Slytherin was evil. Unfortunately, a lot of people thought so, giving James his bullying free way. Being in Ravenclaw, Aurora only noticed the bullying of her brothers' house. Harry however, had felt the full brunt of it.  </p><p>At the end of almost every year, Dumbledore put up a test for their so called "saviour". Aurora and Harry always tried to stop them, but ended up solving the test, while James Jr got all credit. Only the two siblings, Sirius and Remus knew the truth. At the end of fourth year, Voldemort had returned and Dumbedore and his cronies found out who the twins really were.</p><p>They immediately started to try and force them to return to the Potters. They had refused and stayed with Sirius and Remus. At the end of sixth year, their cousin Draco had heard of a plan to take the magic from the twins and force it into James Jr. After hearing that, Sirius and Remus knew that it wasn't safe there anymore for the two children. After a tearful farewell to their family and their true friends they left. Using an ancient spell, Aurora and Harry were transported to another world, together with Remus.</p><p>Sirius and the Malfoys stayed behind to keep an eye on the idiots. The Malfoys had given them Dobby to help.  There they met a lot of people and found a new home close to The Greenwood. There Aurora had met her husband: Thranduil, king of The Greenwood. They had bonded over several things they had in common They both favoured peace over fighting and had a shared love for books, reading and wine. </p><p>They had married a few years later, Harry and Remus giving her away.The Valar had granted Aurora and Harry the rare gift of immortality. Aurora looked down and put her hand on her stomach. It seemed like The Valar had granted her another gift. One to be cherished forever. Aurora caught the eye of Galadriel and the Lady gave her a knowing smile.'<em>Of course she knows</em>.' Aurora thought smiling back at the wise female elf.</p><p>They had become good friends over the years. The peace was disturbed, when a loyal servant came to their table. "My king, there is a group of people who are demanding to see the lord Black and Queen Aurora." The servant told them. "They are here, aren't they?" Harry asked, looking at Remus. The werewolf sniffed the air and nodded. The two siblings shared a look with each other. They had known this day would eventually come, but had hoped that there was a small chance of it never happening. </p><p>Looking at her husband, she gave him a panicked look. He understood immediately and his expression grew serious. Grabbing her hand and squeezing it, he looked at their guests, who had all understood the message too. Gandalf was frowning Lady Galadriel had her mouth in a thin, disapproving line and even Lord Elrond was making his displeasure shown, something that he rarely did.</p><p>Thranduil kept his anger in, nodding to the servant to go and get their "guests". The servant bowed and left. In the time that he was gone, both Aurora and Thranduil stood up, some of the guests and Legolas moved closer to Aurora and her brother. The guards also moved closer. They all cared for the siblings and would protect them from anything, even their former family.</p><p>Before the "guests" arrived, Thranduil moved to stand in front of his wife, hiding her from view. Legolas doing the same to Harry. Remus hid himself in a small doorway. The "guests" were the minister of magic, Cornelius Fudge, "the pink toad" Delores Umbridge, Dumbledore, the three Weasleys and the three potters. Aurora took a peak from behind her husband and almost screamed in fury. The idiots had a bound Sirius with them. Her brother felt her anger and tried to calm her down from behind Legolas.</p><p>He hoped Moony wouldn't do something stupid. The idiots looked at the Elves in barely disguised awe. The elves however were looking at the idiots in displeasure or anger. Sirius looked around with a bit of fear. He hoped his husband and pups were somewhere safe. "May I ask what a strange group of travelers, such as yourselves are doing in my kingdom? And also why one of you is bound?" Thranduil spoke up, the coldness of his face reflected in his voice.</p><p>After a few seconds, Dumbledore himself spoke up. "Your majesty, we came from another world to get some of our children back. Their parents are very worried, you see." He explained. He gestured towards the Potters, who tried to look worried and failed completely. Thranduil raised a brow, unconvinced. He looked at the group coldly</p><p>"If they are so worried, then how did the children get here in the first place? And you haven't answered my second question." He asked, making sure his disbelief and irritation was heard. The old man thought for a minute, clearly making up a lie. "It was all a slight misunderstanding. We wanted to do a small ritual with them, ensuring that their brother could meet his destiny and defeat a terrible dark lord. It was all for the greater good.But escaping my watchful eye, the children had turned dark." Dumbledore started</p><p>"They have escaped with the help of this man here. They were accompanied by a werewolf. I'm afraid that they could cause havoc in your kingdom." The old goat continued, trying to manipulate the king. Remus trembled from where he was hidden. They kidnap his husband and now they try to lie to Aurora's husband. He was so glad that the king already knew the truth.</p><p>Thranduil could feel his wife shaking behind him with anger. Subtly, he reached back to squeeze her arm, reassuring that he was there to protect her and that she was not going anywhere. He saw the man who had adopted his wife look around in actual worry. "Mithrandir, get Mr. Black and keep him with you. I'll talk to him later" He ordered, looking at the idiots to see if they noticed the purposefully made mistake. After all, how did he know Sirius his name?</p><p>The idiots did not notice. Sirius did. He gave the king a funny look as he was led to safety. Gandalf took Sirius over from the rest and pulled him to where he and the elves were standing. Now that Sirius was safe, Thranduil decided to show that he knew everything. "That ritual you were talking about. Did it involve the children getting stripped of their magic, rendering them powerless?" The king asked, a hint of a growl in his voice. He barely hid a smirk at seeing the idiots startle, clearly not expecting him to know that.</p><p>"Now, what are you doing here? And this time, you better tell the truth." He growled, one hand on the hilt of his sword and the other still behind him. Dumbledore sighed, knowing he had to tell the truth. "There is a prophecy. It said someone was destined to save our world. We thought it was young James over here, but we were wrong." He started </p><p>"The twins were the ones who defeated the dark lord and we need their help in saving our world, but Sirius hid them away, together with Remus" He tried to sound sorry, but didn't manage it. Suddenly, the old man's eyes started to twinkle."But maybe there is another way you could help us. You could bond yourself to miss Weasley over here. I'm sure a marriage to a powerful king like yourself would enlighten the people and give them hope." He offered</p><p>"It is not like you are already married, of course." He continued, gesturing towards the female Weasley. Her eyes, as well as her mother's and brother's eyes filled with greed at the idea of marrying Thranduil. The Elves and Gandalf all looked at them like they had grown a second head.Lord Elrond stood up. "First, you allow two children to be abused and when they are finally free and happy, you do your best to ruin it, just because they refuse to listen to you. You are all revolting." The wise elf said.</p><p>He was usually very kind, but after hearing what the siblings had gone through, he refused to show them that kindness. He had been willing to give them a chance, but seeing that they didn't regret their actions, he gave up. Umbridge spoke up in her annoying voice. "Well it was their own fault. They should have listened to their superiors." She huffed</p><p>Molly Weasley nodded in agreement. "Indeed, they should have listened to Dumbledore. He knows what's best for the world. But that filthy man has corrupted them against the light and their family." She spat, pointing towards Sirius. Dumbledore held up his hand. "Now calm down. Just tell us where the children are and we'll take them back and be gone." Dumbledore said</p><p>Legolas raised a brow. "What if they do not want to come with you and want to stay here?" He asked, knowing that the siblings would rather die, than go with the idiots." Dumbledore smiled. "I'm afraid that they have no choice, my boy." Legolas raised an eyebrow at that informal way of address. While not as regal as his father, he was still a prince. Dumbledore continued, ignoring the raised eyebrow. "Cornelius and I have a magical order for them to come back and help us fight the war." He said</p><p>"Once the war is over, they'll be rewarded and given a place in our world, together with their adoptive fathers. It's all for the greater good." The crazy old man continued. As soon As he said "place", Aurora looked at her brother. They knew exactly the place he meant: the prison Azkaban. So that was his plan. Letting them defeat Voldemort and then throw them away again. This time forever.</p><p>Looking into the mind of James Sr, she saw that weren't going to throw Sirius there, but kill him. This was the last straw. Aurora growled and stepped into the light. "In. Your. Dreams. You old goat." She bit out. Harry and Remus came out too, Remus standing in front of the siblings and growling at his former friends. Aurora saw the shock on all the faces, but mixed with different emotions.</p><p>Shock and anger on the faces of the idiots and shock and relief on the face of Sirius. She felt her husband put a protective arm around her waist. She immediately leaned into his touch. She saw the female Weasley following the action with jealous eyes. She smiled and bowed mockingly, before turning serious. The idiots tried to come closer, but Legolas aimed an arrow at them, the guards partly pulling out their swords, warning them to not come any closer. Looking at Dumbledore, Aurora glared at him.</p><p>"Give us ONE good reason to go with you" She growled. Before Dumbledore could answer, her former mother stepped forward instead. "Aurora sweetie. We're really sorry for how we treated you. We just want you to come home. Once you defeat Voldemort, we can be the family you always wanted. Just come home." She pleaded, holding out her hand. The twins just looked at her coldly.</p><p>Did they think that they were as stupid as the idiots in front of them? They had a life here. A happy one and they weren't about to give it up. "Why should we help the people who threw us away like thrash? Why should we stick our necks out for the people who never did the same for us? Even now you are telling me to do something for you and once we have done that, you'll go back to James and put us in prison for being dark." She hissed</p><p>"Don't think I don't know <em>exactly</em> which place you were talking about." She continued. Seeing them flinch, she smiled dryly. "You do not care about us. You never did. You just want to keep being famous for being the parents of the saviours. Well, guess what? You never were and you never will be. Dad and pops are the only parents we need." She growled. "And don't think I don't know about your plan to kill them. In case it is not clear enough for you, read my lips: I. Hate. You." She finished angrily.</p><p>She felt her husband rub soothing circles on her back, whispering comforting words into her ear. She turned around and walked into his embrace. Seeing his sister was preoccupied, Harry stepped forward. He saw them shoot hopeful looks to him, but he was quick to crush their hopes. "Don't look at me, I'm not going to do your dirty work for you." He told them</p><p>"There's only one old wizard in weird clothing that we listen to and that's Gandalf. No offense, sir." He added. Gandalf smiled at him, before turning back to glare at the intruders.<em> 'It really says a lot if even Gandalf doesn't like them.'</em> Harry thought, before sighing. "Do you have any idea how hard it was for us to live at the Dursleys?" He asked</p><p>"We slept in a cupboard. We got barely enough food. We were being treated worse than a house elf. Even when dad and Remus adopted us, it took us a while for us to learn that we didn't need to sneak food." He sneered. "We are happy here. We belong here. So do not look at me or her for your little pest problem. You had your chance and you blew it." He finished, glaring at the idiots.  Fudge had to give one last try. "But if you do not help us, then who will save our world and our people?" He tried to get on their guilt</p><p>They wouldn't have it. Aurora turned around and glared. "Oh I don't know. <em>You're </em>the so called leader of the wizarding world. That's <em>your</em> job. So <em>you</em> figure it out." She stated coldly. Legolas stepped forward. "You did not get what you came for, now leave or I'll have guards escort you out." He said. Legolas liked his stepmother and he hated to see her upset.</p><p>As Legolas turned around, they heard the youngest Potter mutter something. "Why do we need a bunch of freaks, anyway?" Aurora stiffened, bad memories of the Dursleys resurfacing. Thranduil held her even tighter to his chest, while shooting his deadliest glare at them. But before he could say something, the human wizards and Gandalf all used their magic to throw the idiots back. Everyone had their weapons out and ready.</p><p>"Guards! Make sure these people are put into a cell and that I do not see their faces for the next century!" Thranduil ordered. The guards listened and they took the idiots outside. Suddenly bracelets appeared on the now prisoner's arms. Dobby popped in. "Dobby put on magic blocks on the idiots master." The little creature squeaked, his big eyes looking at the prisoners angry for hurting his mistress. He snapped his fingers and Sirius was freed. Harry and Thranduil nodded and looked as the idiots were dragged away.</p><p>Harry couldn't help, but wave mockingly as some of the idiots tried to beg for their help. A few minutes after as they were gone, Aurora stepped out of her husband's arms and ran to Sirius, hugging him. He hugged her back, holding her as tightly as he could. She stepped away after a few minutes and let Harry hug their adoptive father. After a few minutes, both she and Remus finally joined them, making it one big hug.</p><p>Once everyone had calmed down, Legolas asked the most important question. "What do we do now with them?" Looking at everyone, it was Aurora who answered. "I don't care, but I don't want them here. I want to live in peace and them being here just gives me stress." She told them. Galadriel nodded. "I agree. Those people being here will not do anyone good." She replied.</p><p>"So, what do we do then?" Harry asked, standing close to Sirius, both he and Aurora unwilling to let him go.Turning around and seeing her brother and stepson, Aurora suddenly got an idea. "I have an idea, but I need some time to plan it. But now, I just want to retire for the evening." She said, standing up. Everyone else stood up too and bowed to her. She bowed back and told Remus that Sirius was allowed to stay in his room and not to be too loud, as the room was close to theirs and Harry's. Both men became as red as a tomato.</p><p>With that settled, she and Thranduil went to their own rooms. Arriving at their rooms, Thranduil helped his wife get ready for bed, before doing the same to himself. Sitting on the bed, Aurora couldn't help, but admire him. Sometimes, she still wondered when she would be pulled away from this beautiful dream and wake up, back in her cupboard at the Dursleys. Feeling a hand on her cheek, Aurora realised that she had been lost in thought.</p><p>Looking up at her husband's loving gaze, she leaned into his hand. Only she could see this side of him. He smiled. "You had that look again." He told her. Seeing her confused gaze, he explained. "The look that you have, when you have trouble believing that this is not a dream." She smiled and kissed him. They pulled apart, their foreheads resting against each other, just enjoying a moment of peace. </p><p>After several seconds, Thranduil raised an eyebrow. "Are you going to tell me what that idea was?" Aurora smiled a smile full of cunning and mischief. "No, but don't worry, my love. If everything goes right, we will never have to see those idiots again." Her smile became softer and he nodded, accepting her answer. After that, they both climbed into bed and went to sleep. Aurora was resting her head on her husband's chest, his arms around her and a smile still on her lips.</p>
