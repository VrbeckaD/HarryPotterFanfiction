  <strong>***One year and a half after the Second Wizarding War***</strong>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>"Where is Ana?" Minerva, the Hogwarts actual headmistress, asked in a hushed tone, leaning closer to Severus' ears.</p><p>Severus' dark irises were focused on the Great Hall's doors, impatiently idling for the woman who has stolen his heart the moment she collided against him at King's Cross station. A moment that seemed to have occurred a distant eternity ago, in another lifetime, where Severus never deemed he was going to feel such sentiments ever again. They fell in love with each other at a time where relationships and trust had an unpredictable outcome and such love as theirs prevailed throughout the commotion of the Ministry of Magic's investigations and all the press meddling and rudeness.</p><p>When Voldemort was killed, Severus had a hard time getting his life back together. It wasn't just the fact that he needed to show people he was never under Voldemort's orders and he never shared their beliefs. The hardest parts were the endless nights awake, the awful memories playing in his head over and over again, day and night. And the nightmares... The nightmares completely raided the remainder of the will and humor he possessed.</p><p>Ana endured those moments, transcending Severus' expectations.</p><p>She held him in her arms, she rocked him back and forth, hugging him tightly as if he was the most precious thing in the world. A woman who had lost all kinds of a family she had, discovered her horrifying heritage but, in the end, remained pure and strong and managed to take care of him in such atrocious moments.</p><p>"You know her. She neglects the world when she's working on something major," Severus replied, his eyes never forsaking the wooden doors.</p><p>Ana had a gift. Sometimes, Severus honestly believes she was bestowed by God himself. Otherwise, how would she be able to handle everything so well, and lift him up whenever he felt down? The nightmares had started to diminish gradually, the long restless nights were replaced by long relaxing nights tangled in each other sated bodies, and the images of the deaths of his dearest ones were no longer in his mind, as Ana filled his mind with many other matters. Like being late all the time.</p><p>"Oh, there she is!" Minerva said excitedly.</p><p>With a contagious smile on her lips and a dark red wine jumpsuit with a small cape on her back, no one was indifferent to that lovely creature.</p><p>Several heads turned around to admire her charming persona, walking happily through the Great Hall, greeting several known students.</p><p>A year and a half had passed since the Second Wizarding Word. A lot of work was done in that school. Lots of sweat and tears fell to the floor while rebuilding it to its former glory. And that year, the staff had finally regained the parent's trust in them and the school was filled with students once more.</p><p>The first years' were awaiting the corridor, the anxiety hovering the air and being received by Ana's senses. She had succeeded to get her powers under control again, after Severus' "amazing" healing tea during the war. She still wondered what the hell was his infatuation with rare flowers' properties and healing teas. They were beneficial, that was correct, but nonetheless, she urged him not to use them on her ever again.</p><p>For half a year Ana had some problems with her powers. Several glasses and windows were shattered on Ana's house, the one Dumbledore had given her. At least that had Severus occupied considering he was the one constantly fixing them, as Ana settled at the corner, nibbling her nails, anticipating Severus' scolding. But it never came. All she received were his narrowed dark eyes gawking at her mixed with a delightful embrace.</p><p>"Good evening, my friends," Ana said, winking at Hagrid who discreetly endeavored to cover his crimson cheeks.</p><p>"Late as always," Severus' stern voice merited her attention.</p><p>"You know me," she said. "For sure I'd be late for my own funeral."</p><p>Severus rolled his eyes, striving to hide the gleam behind them as he contemplated Ana's perfect silhouette. Even after all these years, watching her seemed like the first time. There was something unconventional about her that he couldn't quite point out - something that tempted him every instant she's around. Anything would do, even the fragrance of her fruity perfume.</p><p>"Besides," she continued. "This is the earliest I've ever been late!"</p><p>Minerva choked on her drink as she tried to conceal her laugh. And that's how it usually went. Ana would show up, spread her happiness everywhere, corrupting even the grumpiest person in the world.</p><p>Ana took her seat by Severus's side and her and his glass were immediately filled up with wine.</p><p>Severus discerned the beverage in front of him and lifted his brow.</p><p>"We're celebrating," Ana clarified, grabbing her cup and handing Severus his.</p><p>"Care to tell me why?"</p><p>"I have discovered something. Do you know what an Angel's Trumpet Drought is?"</p><p>"Obviously."</p><p>Ana smirked at his annoyed tone.</p><p>"But you do not know what is the source of its herbs nor its location, am I right?"</p><p>"It is of common knowledge that such potion might be a myth," Severus said, his eyes roaming for a second to the entrance of the Great Hall as the first years' made their way to the sorting hat. One by one they were called and one by one they were sorted into the adequate house considering their traits and aspirations. Severus remembered when the hat yelled Slytherin on his first year.</p><p>"Well, it's not," Ana said and Severus snapped his head at her. She had his full attention.</p><p>"Elaborate, please."</p><p>"I have been studying the history of healing potions and herbs, diseases, poisons, among other things, and I have been noticing something interesting through all the books and documentation I have encountered. I started digging deep and I found something. The probable location of the herb," she spoke in a low tone.</p><p>"Probable?"</p><p>"Ok - it's the exact location. I have contacted a friend from South America," Ana continued explaining Severus how she has been exchanging letters and herbs with that mysterious friend he had no knowledge of until that moment, and she noticed how his eyes became darker.</p><p>Severus had another hard step ahead of him that he has been finding quite impossible to overcome: his jealousy over anything that moves around Ana. His dear Ana. "It's a Brugmansia. It is used by the tribes as a narcotic and there are rumors it has been in use by several witches through all England territory."</p><p>"Are you sure you have found it?" Severus asked, clearing his throat and clearing his mind of his thoughts. Thoughts of rage and fear that Ana might find someone younger and more exciting in the middle of the science investigation team. She is Hogwarts' healer, but she was also offered a position as a member of a new task force that works towards innovation and the creation of several kinds of treatments and methods of healing. That puts her in contact with all sorts of people and that worried Severus at a major level.</p><p>Ana lifted a brow and Severus curled his lips up. She's always sure of the things she shares with him and he simply loves the fact that she runs to his arms to share her findings with him. Every single time.</p><p>"I have it in my office," she wiggled her brows and Severus smirk vanished in an instant. "And I have made a few tests and I have great conclusions."</p><p>"Bloody hell, Ana, that is outstanding!" Severus said, clearing his throat when several members of the staff team turned their heads at him.</p><p>"I -- I still need to study a few things, but... yeah, I think it might help in many fields," Ana said, feeling her cheeks reddening.</p><p>Severus raised his glass and leaned it against hers. Ana smiled shyly at him, making him feel a twist on his stomach, a twist he feels every time she looks at him with her big shiny eyes.<br/>That moment, he wanted so badly to feel her lips, but they were not in the proper place to display such affections, especially on the first day of school.</p><p>"To you and your brilliant mind," Severus said before drinking his wine.</p><p>Ana chuckled and mimicked him, setting her glass down after emptying it.</p><p>"I must establish that we will resume this celebration later," Severus said, his eyes on the houses' sorting, but his attention solely on his beloved.</p><p>She caught the intention behind his words and gulped, feeling her cheeks reddening once again. That happens a lot. Severus holds such power over her and he was never even aware of it.</p><p>"I still want to show you my progress after this is over," Ana said. "In my office."</p><p>"So?"</p><p>Ana snapped her head at Severus and widened her eyes at the meaning of that conversation. Was he proposing what she thought he was proposing?</p><p>With an absence of response, Severus looked at Ana who was staring up at him too close for his own good.</p><p>"I beg you, do not look at me that way," he muttered.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"You know why," he replied, his eyes traveling down to her lips and back to her eyes.</p><p>"Then, I will continue because I simply love to see you like this," Ana said in a playful tone.</p><p>"Teasing amuses you?"</p><p>"Teasing you? Absolutely," she replied.</p><p>Severus didn't reply. He turned his head as Minerva raised from her chair. The house's sorting had finished and it was time for her speech as headmistress, to welcome the new students and the old ones. She started by thanking their faith in that school and their will to study and evolve as wizards and useful members of the society. Then, as usual, she advised them of the dangers hidden behind Hogwarts' walls and explained everything that they can or cannot do inside the castle grounds.</p><p>Ana's eyes gawked at the ceiling lights. Minerva truly exceeded herself this time. There were a full moon and stars and several candles floating gracefully in the air. The students were so engrossed in her speech that they disregarded the beauty above their young heads.</p><p>Her attention was stolen by Minerva again when she caught Dumbledore's name.</p><p>It still hurt inside. Whenever someone speaks his name, she remembers the moment of his death. How Severus pronounced the worst words she ever had heard...</p><p>Apparently, the same thoughts occurred through Severus' mind, as if it was all happening again at the moment. Ana felt it. Their soul connection was stronger than it ever was and that was why she managed to help him heal his deep wounds and get himself back together.</p><p>Severus' expression was resolute, staring at Minerva as she remembered Dumbledore's cheeky aphorisms and his most honorable actions for that school. His body became rigid and tense and his lungs seemed to stop working.</p><p>When Ana's soft hand squeezed his under the table, he was snapped out of that trance. And suddenly all the sad thoughts in his head have vanished. That was how they managed to achieve such positions: supporting each other, understanding each other pains and wiping every tear. They knew there was still a long way to go, but at least they were at peace, they had a home and they had friends. Loyal friends. There was no need to look over their shoulder anymore and there was no need to hide their romantic relationship. It all seemed to perfect to be true, at least those were recurrent thoughts in Severus' mind.</p><p>When the night was over and the students were guided to their headquarters, the staff started recoiling to their chambers to gather energy, for the next day would be the first day of a long year.</p><p>Ana got up and grabbed Severus's hand who obediently followed her. The smell of her shampoo filled his nostrils as her waves bounced beautifully at each step she took. He never grew tired of admiring her, either she's awake or asleep. When he suffered insomnia, instead of having a sleeping potion or reading a book, he'd look at her peaceful face and wondered what she was dreaming. He wondered if he was on her mind as she was on his. He wondered how on Earth was he so lucky to have her by his side. On his bed. Under his sheets.</p><p>"As you see, the plant has a strong green base," Ana snapped him out of thoughts as she started showing the Angel's Trumpet's herb guarded inside of a small glass chamber. "But the flowers are white, yellow, green, pink, orange, and, the most lethal one, red."</p><p>She then opened her notebook.</p><p>"Well, most of the flowers can kill you if ingested in high quantities, but -- " she showed him some sketches and calculations and he contemplated her handwriting and her proud expression as she explained her achievements. The small dimples she forms when she tries to hide her proud smirk were simply too seductive and sometimes he found himself imagining what would be like if he simply ignored the world and spent the rest of his time making that woman happy. No school, no classes, just him and her in their humble house. But he knew such a dream was not possible. Not yet, at least. She had proved how smart and powerful she can be, she had performed several discoveries throughout her trainee period and she continued surprising everyone with small breakthroughs, contributing to the wizarding world at a level that most old wizards never were capable of reaching. She was born for that.</p><p>"If you extract the right amount of essence from the flowers what could be the applications?"</p><p>"Uh, most of them can produce powerful healing potions for anti-venoms, infections, I mean, you name it. And... I can also make a Tonic for Trace Detection... A very powerful tonic."</p><p>"The Ministry would pay hundreds of Galleons for such possession," Severus thought out loud, his mouth slightly dropped open.</p><p>Ana closed her book and locked it in the safety vault.</p><p>"That is why I am pondering on keeping this in secret for now. Imagine if this falls in the wrong hands."</p><p>"Disaster."</p><p>"Exactly," she said, turning around to look at him.</p><p>The change of gleam in her eyes exposed how her mind was traveling too quickly to other thoughts. Severus stood against the balcony of her laboratory, his eyes following Ana as she walked to him. Her hands gently massaged his arms up and down, her eyes glued to his.</p><p>"You said something about celebrating after the diner," Ana said. "In here."</p><p>"I did."</p><p>Severus arms embraced her delicate body and drew her closer, his warmth involving her and provoking shivers down her spine. He leaned in, approaching her lips slowly, making her suffer in anticipation.</p><p>"What did you have in mind?" She whispered, her voice weakening as he barely brushed his lips against hers. His mere touch was enough to send her to heaven. The pulsing sensation he produces on her runs through her body, fills her veins, and makes her heart pump inside her chest. When she's that overwhelmed, he can do whatever he wants to her and she would easily comply.</p><p>Without giving her time to protest, Severus assaulted her lips fervently, kissing her passionately but not gently as he uses to. This time, he was hungry and he wanted her, right there, right at that moment. The door was locked, her office was private, and he had her all to himself.</p><p>In a swift movement, he had her pinned down against her own desk and his hands worked to unzip her jumpsuit.</p><p>"May I show you?"</p>
