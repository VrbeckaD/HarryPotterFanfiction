    <p>The sun warmed Petunia’s back so thoroughly that her blouse was beginning to stick. Nervously she shifted the stack of papers she carried in the crook of her arms, safely contained in a file folder, and after a brief moment to steel herself rang the doorbell of the house she had left months before.</p>
<p>After a longish wait, Vernon opened the door. He was still in his striped pyjamas although it was well past noon on this beautiful Sunday. When he saw her he straightened forbiddingly and scowled.</p>
<p>“So,” he growled. “You’re back, are you?”</p>
<p>Petunia's lips tightened. She had expected him to be angry, of course, so his closed expression of hurt pride was no surprise. Besides, it was better than him abjectly apologising and begging her to return—at least now she had less qualms about saying what needed to be said.</p>
<p>“I’m not back,” she said. “I want a divorce.”</p>
<p>Vernon’s eyes widened. He spluttered indignantly, looked around outside the house and grabbed her wrist.</p>
<p>“Sshhh!” he hissed and pulled her inside before the neighbours could hear. Strange how the thought, once so mortifying as to be debilitating, now had no power over Petunia whatsoever. But she didn't resist, just followed Vernon inside and let the door close behind her.</p>
<p>The hall was filthy. The floor was marked by muddy footsteps, three binliners full of trash were waiting to be taken out, the windows were dingy and the house stank of dirt and sweat. Petunia wrinkled her nose in distaste.</p>
<p>“You must be out of your mind. You can’t divorce me,” Vernon said, as though stating a self-evident truth. “Just think what that would do to my career!”</p>
<p>“I’m quite certain your career would recover,” Petunia sighed and tried not to let the reflexive twinge of guilt prick her too deep.</p>
<p>“And when you come to your senses, you’ll see you’d be no better off, either. What would you live on, all by yourself? Someone needs to earn all that money you throw away every month!”</p>
<p>“I have a job,” Petunia replied frostily, “and I can live frugally if I choose.”</p>
<p>Vernon chewed on his cheek as his scowl deepened. He ran a hand over his combed-over hair. “But you wouldn’t have to! I don’t understand why you even left. We had a good life, and then you were just… gone!” His voice rose into a plaintive squawk.</p>
<p>Petunia cringed as her heart went out to him a little bit. Was it his fault, after all, that she was a different person from who he thought he was marrying? She cast about for something comforting to say when his next words wiped away all sympathy.</p>
<p>“What about Dudley, eh?” Vernon waved his hands for dramatic effect, missing the vase set on the end pillar of the banister by half an inch. ”You even left your own son! You’re an unfit mother.”</p>
<p>“Dudley’s not a child anymore,” Petunia snarled, but in point of fact Vernon had hit her square in the most painful spot of her heart.</p>
<p>“And you have no grounds for divorce,” Vernon continued unpleasantly. “I haven’t deserted you, I haven’t been <em>unreasonable</em>—whatever that means—and I’ve never messed around. So there.”</p>
<p>So there. Petunia stared at him in shock as his words sunk in. She had foreseen that this would be difficult, but all her imagined and rehearsed conversations had ended with Vernon acknowledging the impossibility of them ever living together again, and agreeing to file jointly for divorce, or at least not to contest it.</p>
<p>“Then you divorce me,” she said. “You have grounds.”</p>
<p>Vernon snorted. “Your gallivanting around London isn’t desertion, it’s just… larks. You’ll come back when your money runs out, and it will.”</p>
<p>“I make a living on my own. I have a flat of my own,” she pointed out furiously. “I’m not <em>gallivanting</em>, don’t you realise I haven’t been back here since…”</p>
<p>“You’re back here now,” Vernon said as if she had just proved his point. Petunia scoffed.</p>
<p>Vernon growled and stalked off into the living-room, and flopped down into his favourite chair.</p>
<p>How could she explain, without telling him about her newfound abilities? Ironically, finding out that she could do magic was the one thing that certainly would make him divorce her, but it was also the one thing she could not bring herself to reveal—not when it was all so new and unsettled. She drew breath for a frustrated sigh, when it hit her that she could tell him something else and it would actually have the desired effect. She breathed out carefully and sat down on the edge of the sofa. Could she say it out loud? Would she dare? She hardly even knew, until the words came out of her mouth.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t faithful.”</p>
<p>Vernon failed to explode, merely snorted again and picked up his paper.</p>
<p>“Did you hear me? I said I’ve been with someone else,” she said, enunciating clearly, determined to get some sort of reaction from him now that the words were really out between them.</p>
<p>“That’s just pathetic, making up lies like that,” Vernon declared from behind the front page of <em>The</em> <em>Daily Mirror</em>. “You’re not as young as you used to be. For all I know you dreamed it.”</p>
<p>All of Petunia’s sympathy for him evaporated. “I am not making anything up!” she hissed, livid.</p>
<p>He peered around the edge of the paper with a superior expression and just looked at her for two or three long seconds. “Who’s it supposed to be, then?” he asked.</p>
<p>“That’s my business,” she bit out.</p>
<p>Vernon snorted yet again. It made him sound like a pig. “You <em>are</em> making this up.”</p>
<p>“An old friend,” she said, face burning. She fought to meet his gaze evenly. “I met him through Lily and James.”</p>
<p>Vernon gasped. Suddenly furious, he shot from his chair, eyes almost popping from his head and his face fire-engine red, as though the very idea was boiling his brain.</p>
<p>“One of THEM???” he roared. He shoved his face right into hers, smelling of stale beer and sweat. Petunia flinched back in shock. “I thought you were different from that sister of yours! After all I’ve done for you, this is how you repay me?”</p>
<p>She felt fury rise from inside her and fought to keep calm. Gulping for air she took a few steps back and rummaged in her handbag. Her trembling fingers brushed her wand but she snatched them away—exploding husbands remained a bad idea for all concerned. Instead she took several deep breaths and wordlessly handed Vernon the deceptively light sheaf of divorce application papers.</p>
<p>“All you have to do is sign these. I can fill them in and take them to the post office for you.”</p>
<p>Vernon was immediately suspicious. “You’re trying to skin me, aren’t you?” he said. “Trying to take whatever you can get. It won’t work…”</p>
<p>“You can have the house,” she interrupted him. “You can have whatever of mine is still here after I leave—I just want some clothes and pictures from upstairs, nothing of value. I don’t care. You get everything.”</p>
<p>He refused to let her fill in the papers, of course. While he was going through them and ticking check marks and answering questions with his clumsy fingers, Petunia went upstairs to pack some more clothes, this time making sure to include enough shoes, and searched every single pocket and drawer for the loose change and the occasional banknote she was in the habit of sowing around her habitations. She had taken most of the picture albums when she first left, but she picked up a few more from Dudley’s—and Harry’s—early years.</p>
<p>On the upstairs landing she glanced at the entrance to the attic and her hand twitched towards the doorknob, but she drew back at the last second. Nothing was there, she had made sure to empty out anything and everything that indicated magic had ever been used there.</p>
<p>When she returned downstairs she found Vernon signing the bottom of the last page.</p>
<p>“And good riddance,” he growled as he shoved them at her. “I should never have got involved with a family like yours. Should have known better. And another thing. You’re a bad influence on Dudley, so don’t even think you’ll ever see him again!”</p>
<p>Petunia gasped in shock. “You can’t forbid us from meeting,” she said. “He’s of age.”</p>
<p>Vernon leaned closer. “When I tell him what you just told me, <em>do you really think he’ll want to see you?</em>” Vernon straightened his back, clearly satisfied. “That’s got you!”</p>
<p>It was all she could do not to break down, claim it was all a lie and beg Vernon to take back his words. She thought about the wand in her purse and wished she could use it to fling some ornaments at Vernon’s stupid head. A mental image of Gramma’s exploding husband flitted past her eyes again and now held a certain charm.</p>
<p>She held in the tears, not wanting to give Vernon the satisfaction of seeing her cry, and kept them back even after the door had closed behind her. On her way to the railway station she spotted a post box and stopped to stuff the divorce papers in the envelope she had brought, written and stamped, and dropped it in the box. And then she sat down on the kerb beside the post box and let the anger and frustration and fright, the failure and bad judgments and time wasted wash over her and cried.</p>
<p>And when she was done, she dried her tears, washed her face at the ladies’ room in a nearby pub, reapplied her makeup and went to see Dudley. She would simply explain everything to him before Vernon got a word in. She had always been able to handle Dudley, ultimately.</p>
