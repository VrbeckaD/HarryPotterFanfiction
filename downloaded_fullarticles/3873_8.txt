    <p>Maryellyanne Silverton looked around the Ravenclaws and Slytherins, all staring at her like she’d grown two heads.  She hadn’t.  She knew she hadn’t.  If she had there’d be double the ocular stimulus and her field of vision, much like a chameleon’s, would have expanded and varied greatly.  She would also have a headache by now.  Sarah Perkins had had an accident in Potions once and grown Maryellyanne that second head, so she knew all this from personal, painful, experience.  “One set of eyes at a time, dear,” Madame Pomfrey had told her then.  “And whichever head’s got her eyes open is the one that can do the talking for both of you.”</p>
<p>So she hadn’t in fact grown another head, despite the inauspicious looks her house- and classmates were giving her.  </p>
<p>“I take it, then, that you didn’t all know about Professor Snape and Professor Vector?”  She turned her head, slowly meeting the eyes staring at her in wild disbelief before their wild whispered speculation broke like a thunderstorm.</p>
<p>Turning from her classmates, she looked up at the staff table, eyes skipping over Professor Vector directly to her Head of House.  She reached for her cup of pumpkin juice, raising it slightly before bringing it to her lips.  A house not worthy of him, were they?</p>
<p>Maryellyanne turned from the staff table to her breakfast, and let the heavy curtain of her corkscrew hair hide her small smile.</p>
