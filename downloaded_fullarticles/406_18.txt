    <p align="justify">This isn’t what I’ve been dreaming of.</p><p align="justify">“GET GOING POTTER!”</p><p align="justify">Not even close.</p><p align="justify">“POTTER, GET THE GOODS ON THE WAGON!”</p><p align="justify">Harry Potter huffed and panted even as he carried the flours to Berties’. He leaned over the wagon. Hedwig, his white stallion looked at him. It freaks him out how soulless everything is. His friends, wandering around. Their eyes lack ambition. It lacks hope. Even Hedwig the fucking horse looks like he’s ready to quit life.</p><p align="justify">He had always been poor, especially since his parents died in a plague and he was left alone, a sole survivor of the Potter family. He'd worked his ass off to save money from when he was a child. Harry sighed and brushed his hair aback, alleviating some of his distress. Sometimes he wished he'd died when his parents did. All this heartache are not exactly what he dreams of.</p><p align="justify">He dreams of a lot of things. He dreams of spotlights and warmth. The sound of music. He dreams of having a family that will share it with him.</p><p align="justify">Somebody tapped him on the shoulder. “Come on, Harry,” Neville said tiredly. “Just a little bit more and we can go home.”</p><p align="justify">Home is what they call their shabby, run-down flat. They live there with a couple more people that Harry dreaded. The Dursleys aren’t exactly someone that anyone wants to be close with. And they charged an exorbitant price for a small space that Harry and Neville had to share with some dogs, a couple of crazy cats and a herd of angry geese. Their landlord, Vernon Dursley is an angry, fat toad that hollers at them every week for rent and had no ounce of sympathy.</p><p align="justify">And he’s Harry’s uncle.</p><p align="justify">The Dursleys are such a contrast to the Potter that hushed whispers spread across the city, wondering if the Evans, Lily and and Petunia's parents, had adopted one of the children. Lily Potter was a sweet, fair creature that everyone loved. When she married James Potter out of love, despite having a lot of other suitors waiting for her, it causes quite the scandal. Petunia is an angry young woman who eventually married Vernon Dursley, the most normal of men, claiming that she has a sensible mind and would not be an eccentric like her younger sister.</p><p align="justify">Lily had tried to bridge the relationship, but Petunia was adamant that they remained separate. And she was as equally adamant that her young nephew was not vested under her care after his parent's demise. However, Mayor Dumbledore had came to her door with the child, threatening to seize the family's land if she dare refused Lily's child. The city is awfully poor, and they have no money to feed their orphans.</p><p align="justify">When Harry turned 13, he was made to pay rent. While his cousin Dudley Dursley was playing with friends, Harry was scouring at Hogsmeade, looking for shops that would offer him odd jobs. He washed the dishes, clean the stables, exercise the horses if he got lucky. Anything that helped him survive.</p><p align="justify">He met Neville Longbottom when he was 21. Neville lived with his awful grandmother who disinherit him because he’s apparently a disgrace to the family. Neville is the second son to a superior older brother. And no noble likes a second son. The idea of dividing the property to two sons are appalling, especially when said second son is a weakling. Much to Augusta Longbottom’s despair, she couldn’t even contract a good marriage for her second born grandchild. Neville was given a sack of Galleons and an old horse and was kicked out from House Longbottom before he even fully understand what is going on.</p><p align="justify">Harry found him starving, and offered the other boy a place to stay. Petunia was delighted with the sack of Galleons that Neville carried with him and offered little resistance.</p><p align="justify">He and Neville became best friends afterwards. He’s 27 now, and still with no prospect of his life getting better.</p><p align="justify">“Neville, what are we doing with our life?”</p><p align="justify">The lean guy besides him looked at him thoughtfully. “There are worse places to be.” He shrugged. “We have a place to stay. A job. A home. We are luckier than most.”</p><p align="justify">“Don’t you…. you know,” he asked awkwardly. “Miss being rich?”</p><p align="justify">Neville’s lips curved upwards and he chuckled. “Trust me, Harry. I don’t. there are other things that are better than money.” The other man didn’t elaborate. Neville only told him that he’s going to go back early and Harry should do the same.</p><p align="justify">Despite Harry’s intention to go back early, it was a lot later in the evening that he actually went home. Even Hedwig was exhausted, and he walked like a farmer’s horse, head hung, as if abiding to the unwritten rule of class and hierarchies. Harry mused even as he walked, dragging Hedwig behind him. if only he’s rich…he could buy a proper house. Get a gentleman worthy horse or even a car. Be a proper gentleman. Leave the Dursleys, oh yes.</p><p align="justify">He stopped at a tailor shop, where a tuxedo was showcased. Yeah, he could see himself in one of those. He smiled at his reflection. Surely, he’s made for grandeur things than mucking horse’s manure and chucking flours into bandwagons?</p><p align="justify">Hedwig neighed tiredly. Sighing, Harry tugged on the leash and made his way home.</p>
