    <p>“You can’t do this!” Narcissa screamed, “He’s just a boy! Please!”<br/>“Order!” one of the judges yelled, “Draco Malfoy, due to the death of your father, Lucius Malfoy, you stand accused for his heinous acts. All in favor of sentencing Draco Malfoy to Lucius’ remaining sentence in Azkaban?”<br/>Majority vote. <br/>“Draco Malfoy, you are sentenced to twenty-five years in Azkaban prison.”<br/>It was wrong, so wrong. Draco took one last look at his mother.<br/>“I love you, Draco!” Narcissa shouted.<br/>“Get her out of here!” another judge shouted.<br/>“Goodbye, Mum,” Draco spoke.<br/> Draco just let the tears fall. There was nothing he could do, nothing anyone could do. By this time tomorrow, he would be in prison.<br/>…<br/>“I promise you, Mrs. Malfoy,” Percy spoke to Draco’s mother, “Harry and I are going to find a way to get him out as soon as possible.”<br/>“I’ll use everything in my power,” Harry said.<br/>Narcissa slowed her crying after that statement. She knew Harry had a lot of power. Killing the Dark Lord will do that for you.<br/>“They’ve used an ancient defense of the ‘sins of the father,’” Percy continued, “While not an illegal defense, it hasn’t been used in centuries.”<br/>“Why are they doing this?” Narcissa pleaded.<br/>“The ministry has a grudge against death eaters, even defected ones,” Harry said.<br/>…<br/>5 years later…<br/>Harry had finally managed to get that defense overwritten. The Ministry acted like they cared that Draco was wrongly imprisoned, but Harry and Percy knew better. A death eater was put away, that would be the headline, innocence be damned. <br/>Percy was assigned to remove Draco from the prison, and as he walked through the halls, he knew the only thing keeping him from getting jumped was his possession of a wand. Draco was housed at the upper floors, in with the twenty-five to life crowd. Cell block E, number 3081.<br/>“Draco?” Percy looked in on the cell, “Draco Malfoy?”<br/>The figure that looked back at him was not Draco. He had the right cell block, the right number, but that was not Draco. Hollow eyes, nearly covered by unkempt white hair, looked trained upon Percy’s wand.<br/>“Can you hear me, Draco?” Percy asked.<br/>Bony hands clung to the grungy prison mattress in the corner. Slowly, the figure stood as Percy waved the door open with the wand. <br/>“Draco,” He called again, and got no response, “You don’t know your name, do you?”<br/>The figure was silent as Percy led him down the corridors. Where was he being taken?<br/>“Tell me your name,” Percy said.<br/>“Serpent,” He mumbled, eyes on the wand.<br/>“They call you that?”<br/>The figure nodded.<br/>“Right, then,” Percy said, “You’re being released from Azkaban. I had to come to escort you.”<br/>The figure remained silent.<br/>…<br/>“What the hell is this?” Harry wondered when he saw Draco sitting quietly inside an empty ministry office, “This…This isn’t HIM!”<br/>“I thought so, too,” Percy said, “It’s like he’s feral or something.”<br/>“He’s a HUMAN, Perce.”<br/>“He kept looking at my wand,” Percy added, “All the guards have wands. He’s learned to fear anyone with a wand. I get that right, Draco?”<br/>The Weasley slammed his hand on the table, “Answer me, Serpent!”<br/>Draco’s eyes shot up, “Y…yes,” He cracked.<br/>“Percy, what the hell!” Harry scolded.<br/>“He only responds to commands.”<br/>“Doesn’t mean you need to verbally abuse him.”<br/>“Sorry,” Percy said, then looked at Draco, “I’m sorry.”<br/>Draco went back to focusing on the wands the two other wizards were holding.<br/>“He’s been traumatized,” Percy said, “In some way or another.”<br/>“Must’ve been hell for him,” Harry said.<br/>“It’s like he’s shut down,” Percy said, “Like all he knows is fear, and survival.”</p>
