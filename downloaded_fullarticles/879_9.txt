  <strong>Fall 2009</strong>
</p>
<p>Killian tapped his wand to the shabby looking door and softly muttered the right spell. Despite living in the damn house for several years now, he was still not quite accustomed to all of its quirks. Why did Emma’s ancestors have to be so bloody secretive? <em>Because they were the most rabid pure blood maniacs in the world</em>, he thought bitterly. He wondered how they’d react to the current occupants of the ancient house. If their first encounters with old Mrs. Black’s portrait were any indication, not well.</p>
<p>“Love? You home?”</p>
<p>He could get away with yelling now, since the home’s previous owner (or more accurately, the owner’s very intelligent friend) found a way to defeat the Permanent Sticking Charm that kept the dreadful portrait in place. Said portrait now resided in the uppermost floor of the house, locked away. Not that it stopped the indominable Mrs. Black from making herself known when they got up to some rather…loud activities. It wasn’t Killian’s fault that they forgot to cast the Muffliato charm occasionally.</p>
<p>Honestly, Killian secretly thought Emma got off on riling up the old bag. Her own private way of sticking it to the ancestors who ruthlessly cut her line out of the family more than two hundred years ago. Her sense of poetic justice was one of the things he loved most about his girl.</p>
<p>A brief check of the first floor told him that she wasn’t there. That didn’t mean much, since none of them spent much time in this part of the house. They were still working on making it uniquely theirs. Too many reminders of the house’s tragic history resided on the main floor. It was clean, presentable, but some of the paint was still chipped and wallpaper peeled at the corners. The troll umbrella stand was gone (ugly thing in Killian’s opinion). It bore little resemblance to the great entry hall depicted in one of the old paintings they found in the attic. Of course the scorch marks from the removal of the painting stuck out from under the shabby green velvet. Killian wanted to restore some of the house’s old glamour but Emma was—understandably—reluctant. There was some dark history here. Still, it was home.</p>
<p>Perhaps she was in the kitchen? She was supposed to have the day off; she only worked at Weasleys’ a couple days a week now. She was trying to get her own business off the ground, with a little boost from her boss. It was a generous arrangement; Emma received the pay and benefits of a full time Weasleys’ employee but only worked in the shop sparingly. Truthfully, it was in George’s best interests, since he had a fifteen percent stake in Emma’s little venture. Once the business took off (and Killian had no doubt it would, it was Emma after all), she could quit entirely and be her own boss.</p>
<p>He grinned to himself, knowing exactly how much that kind of thing appealed to his Swan.</p>
<p>“Swan?”</p>
<p>“I’m here!”</p>
<p>He stepped down the creaky stairs, the smell of something delicious wafting up to him. “You didn’t have to cook, love.”</p>
<p>She smiled that brilliant smile he loved so much, her green eyes sparkling. “I thought we could have a bit of a celebration.”</p>
<p>He arched a brow at her, leaning casually in the doorway. He didn’t miss the way she looked him up and down. “Just what are we celebrating?” Was it mere coincidence, that they would both have news at the same time?</p>
<p>Emma set the wooden spoon to stirring itself and wiped her hands on a nearby dishtowel. “You remember that space I was looking at? In Diagon Alley?”</p>
<p>“Aye, tucked in the corner near Knockturn Alley. Very discreet.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, George got me in with the owner this morning after you left for work. It’s mine, if I want it!”</p>
<p>Killian’s grin threatened to split his face. “Sweetheart, that’s wonderful!” He closed the gap between them and picked her up, spinning her around until she was a giggling mess. As he set her back on unsteady feet, he fervently pressed his lips to hers. Emma clung to him, arms tightening around his neck, allowing herself to get caught up in his kiss. No one kissed like her Killian. Well, almost no one. She could think of someone else’s kisses that she craved just as much.</p>
<p>Kissing her was better than any magic, her lips soft and urgent under his, tongue teasing the seam of his lips. He backed her into the enormous table, built for fifteen at least, old but sturdy. They’d tested it. A lot. Emma hopped up automatically, parting her thighs for him. Killian didn’t hesitate to step between them, tilting her head back to deepen the kiss.</p>
<p>Emma mewled, fingers threading through his hair, so soft against her skin.  They’d kissed hundreds, if not thousands of times, in the brief years they’d been together, truly together, but it never lost its power. She always craved more. Anchoring her legs at the base of his spine, she dragged him closer so he could feel how much he affected her.</p>
<p>“Hmm, my naughty girl,” he murmured, nipping at her throat.</p>
<p>“You kissed me, buddy.”</p>
<p>“You’re very kissable, Swan.” He’d always thought so, once he was old enough to truly see her. Emma was his best friend, his soulmate, his lover. She was all he needed.</p>
<p>“Hmm, so are you.” She kissed him again, slower, unlatching his robes, letting them whoosh to the floor.</p>
<p>He could see what she was after instantly. “Should we wait?”</p>
<p>“Liam’s on his way,” she whispered between kisses. “I sent him an owl to be home early.”</p>
<p>Killian couldn’t resist her, his hands sliding up under her blouse. Almost a dozen years in their world and she still dressed like a Muggle. Not that he minded in the least. He (and his brother) enjoyed undressing her, slowly baring her pale perfect skin. “Devious minx.”</p>
<p>She palmed his growing erection, drawing a growl from his throat. “Hmm, you know how he likes to watch.”</p>
<p>“Aye.” It was a kink he and his brother shared, both dedicated to Emma’s pleasure above all else. “So he won’t mind if I do this?” He fished his wand out of his pocket (he could just hear his old Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher screaming about wand safety!) and waved it at her blouse, the buttons unraveling and falling to the floor.</p>
<p>“You’re fixing that, Jones,” Emma complained, even as her back arched. She dragged his head to her chest, moaning as he kissed and teased the swells of her breasts.</p>
<p>“Happy to, love.” She wore his favorite green and silver bra and panty set, the ones that accentuated her lush curves. “Fuck, I love these.” He yanked down one strap, wrapping his lips around a pert nipple.</p>
<p>“Oh god,” Emma moaned, her core flooding with heat. She knew exactly how to drive her boys insane with lust, her old school house an intense aphrodisiac. Not that they needed one. Their mutual lust was pretty potent all on its own.</p>
<p>Killian ground against her crotch, the panties quickly becoming soaked. “Were you not fucked well enough this morning, lass?”</p>
<p>She wet her lips, grinding back. “That was…fuck, a quickie in the tub, Jones.” The master bath was huge, ancient clawfoot tub that she adored, perfect for them to share. But the boys needed get off to work; they couldn’t take their usual care with her, fucking her until she was sated. She’d been jonesing (pun certainly intended) for round two all day.</p>
<p>“Something we shall rectify immediately.” He peeled the blouse from her body, followed by her bra.</p>
<p>The door opened, the familiar scent of the old house assaulting Liam’s nostrils. One day, he swore, they’d find a way to make it go away. Fortunately, it was most prevalent on the first floor. The parts of the house in use were much better. Emma’s owl had not sounded urgent, but he hurried home all the same. He was a sucker for her, always had been. He was just thankful she chose to love him, despite his flaws.</p>
<p>He heard faint sounds coming from the end of the entrance hall; she must be in the kitchen. As he approached however, he realized his love was not alone. “Bloody hell,” he cursed under his breath. Whatever was going on, it seemed his lover couldn’t wait. The sounds of her sighs and moans went straight to his cock; it was nearly obscene how quickly she could get to him. But then again, she’d always been special.</p>
<p>Liam hurried down the stairs, greeted with the sight of his lover and his brother locked in an intimate embrace, Emma’s top gone and Killian’s face buried in her cleavage. “Merlin’s beard, you two. Couldn’t wait for me?”</p>
<p>Emma opened her eyes, her Liam upside down from her point of view. He was absurdly handsome, his features a mixture of love, lust and exasperation. “Hey. Come join us. Please.”</p>
<p>Liam bit his lip; fuck, she was sexy. He marched to the table, kissing her upside down. “Bloody insatiable vixen.”</p>
<p>Emma reached for him, bringing his lips back to hers as Killian suckled her nipples. “We’re celebrating.”</p>
<p>“We are?”</p>
<p>She nodded, a lazy smile on her lips. “I got my space.”</p>
<p>“About damn time.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and all I wanted was share it with my boys.”</p>
<p>Liam shucked his robes and climbed up on the heavy table, giving Emma a good look at the bulge in his trousers. “We’re here now, my love.” He bent over her chest, taking her left nipple between his lips. Emma keened, arching against them, a fresh wave of lust gripping her.</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>It felt like she was drowning, mouths and hands working her into a frenzy. She got a brief respite as they finished stripping her, Liam lovingly peeling the Slytherin inspired panties down her legs. “Beautiful.”</p>
<p>Emma canted her hips, desperate for friction. Liam obliged her, his mouth pressing kisses to her inner thighs, his tongue lightly teasing her slit. She whined, frustrated, but Killian came to the rescue. He kissed her deeply, guiding her hands to his waist. “There’s a girl,” he murmured. “Let’s get these off.” Both were talented at nonverbal magic, but his wand lay forgotten. Besides, he got off on his lover frantic to remove his clothes.</p>
<p>Emma yanked hard at the pants, licking her lips as Killian kicked them away. As usual he was naked beneath them, cock bobbling proudly against his belly. Her mouth watered, excited to taste him. “Gimme.”</p>
<p>“Such a greedy lass.” He smirked at her, large hand curling around his shaft. He pumped slowly, just enough to take the edge off his need. “I love it.”</p>
<p>Emma gasped, Liam’s tongue painting erotic images into her skin. “Don’t stop.” She squirmed so much, Liam’s rough hand held her down, his strength increasing her pleasure. The blatant masculinity of her boys was a huge turn on. “Fuck.”</p>
<p>“Soon, sweetheart.” Killian palmed on breast, plucking at the nipple until she was whimpering with need. “Still want it?”</p>
<p>“God yes.” She licked her lips, opening automatically as he leaned forward to offer her his thick cock. Their years together taught her exactly what he liked, a deft lick there, hard suction here, gentle scrape of her teeth over the sensitive head. Her Killian was gorgeous, well built and strong, so far from the gangly teen she first fell in love with. Every inch of him was stunning, but when she was really, really horny (which, to be fair, was fairly often), she couldn’t help but admire his cock. Long and thick, uncut, with a nice fat vein she liked to tease with her tongue. The things he could do her to her with it…was it any wonder she craved this?</p>
<p>Liam felt the heat rolling off her, arousal coating his tongue. Sucking cock made Emma burn with need, her arousal sky rocket. They were so incredibly lucky that she was enjoyed it as much as they did. He pressed two fingers into her tight channel, pumping slowly, watching her eyes roll back as she continued to suck. Her hips rolled into his touch, thighs shaking, her body starting to tense. Liam recognized the signs of her impending release, redoubling his efforts to make her fall.</p>
<p>She was burning, the tension almost too much. She loved when they did this to her, overwhelmed her with sensation, made her feel so fucking amazing. Killian moved before she fell, flopping onto the hard table with a small oof, his desire nowhere near sated. But he needed to see her come.</p>
<p>Emma arched off the table, spots popping behind her eyes like fireworks, Liam fingering her through it, giving her exactly what she needed. Every inch of her was suffused in bliss.</p>
<p>Gently, Liam extracted his hand, lips touching her hip. “Love you,” he whispered in her skin. Even after all this time, he never wanted to take her for granted, or the unselfish love she had for him and his brother.</p>
<p>Emma hummed, still not quite there. But she could feel the words that didn’t quite register. They loved her with their whole hearts, finally giving her the home she’d always craved. The table was hard but that didn’t stop her boys from crawling up beside her, one on either side, gloriously naked and ready for her. She didn’t open her eyes, merely turned her head to kiss one. She knew who it was the moment their lips touched. Liam’s kiss was gentle, loving, his rough hands sliding up her body. She smiled against his lips, stealing one last peck before turning back to Killian. He was more demanding, mouth hot on hers, his hands joining Liam’s in their sensual assault on her body. She shivered, their desire for her more intoxicating than Firewhiskey.</p>
<p>“Emma,” Liam murmured, his straining erection nudging her hip. “Tell us we can have you, love.”</p>
<p>She nodded, rolling on her side, facing Killian. Looking back, she angled her hips toward Liam. “Please.”</p>
<p>Liam moaned, pulling her closer, leg sliding between hers. Killian helped, getting her to the perfect height for his brother to take her. A keening moan left her lips as her lover pressed inside, filling her, stretching her deliciously. Each of her boys were generously endowed and she reveled in it, taking every inch, memorizing the feel of his cock gliding in and out of her. “Fuck, she’s so wet.”</p>
<p>Killian groaned, cock twitching. It was almost painful, how badly he wanted her. Emma was stunning, hair a mess, lips kiss bitten and parted, nipples tight with arousal. He ducked down to suckle, knowing precisely how sensitive she was there. Emma swore, a colorful Muggle curse, grabbing a fistful of dark hair. “Yes! Oh fuck yes!”</p>
<p>Liam grunted, her obvious need fueling his. He took her harder, hips snapping into hers, the sound of slapping skin filling the kitchen. His orgasm tingled at the base of his spine, but he fought it, not ready to let her go.</p>
<p>“Liam…fuck, so good,” she panted, another high building low in her belly. But she needed more. “Give me to Killian. Need…”</p>
<p>Liam was all too aware of his lover’s needs and bowed to them happily. He pulled out of her, holding her steady as kissed his brother deeply, pushing him on his back. With more energy than Killian expected, she clambered on top, straddling his hips and impaling herself on his length. They both moaned, Emma’s already swollen flesh alight with fresh arousal. She loved when they shared her like this, taking turns with her until she was nearly crazed with lust.</p>
<p>Liam couldn’t stop staring, Emma’s face a mask of pleasure as she enjoyed her ride. She smiled at him, then down at Killian, her hands braced on his chest. Killian was in heaven, her willing body swallowing him whole, walls tight around his cock. “Fuck, that’s it,” he hissed, hands sliding up her thighs. “You always ride me so good.”</p>
<p>Emma bit her lip, her boys’ working class accents thicker during sex. She loved it. Ducking down she kissed him, mewling as strong hands squeezed her ass. “Killian, fuck!”</p>
<p>“Not through with you, love.” He rolled them over, giving her a few rough thrusts before pulling out reluctantly. Fortunately, he’d earned to share.</p>
<p>Before Emma could fully register the change in position, the taller burlier Liam settled between her thighs. She arched as he filled her once more, rigid velvet encased in silky heat. Liam bit back a curse, her lithe body perfect. “More,” she breathed, locking ankles behind his back. “Wanna come with you in me.”</p>
<p>Liam needed that too; she felt amazing when she climaxed. Long deep strokes, grinding on her clit, he wrenched her arms above her head, fucking her with abandon. Emma cried out in approval, the wave about to reach its crest. This climax was even more intense than the first, walls fluttering along the shaft buried inside her. Her lover jerked, the pleasure too much. He quickly followed her in bliss, cock pumping her full of his seed.</p>
<p>She vaguely felt Liam roll off her, gentle hands scooping her up. Emma grabbed Killian around the neck, inhaling his distinct scent. They settled in one of the chairs, Emma perched in his lap, legs on either side of his. Still drunk on her second climax, she shivered when she felt deft fingers probe between her legs. “Can you take more, my darling? Need you so much.”</p>
<p>Emma opened her eyes, deliberately sliding her slick flesh over his erection. “Hurry.”</p>
<p>Killian wasted no time, guiding her hips, helping her slide down on him. His passage was eased by the mixed essences of his lover and his brother, something he knew Emma reveled in. They started slow, trading kisses and soft touches until Emma got her breath back. Gradually, she picked up the pace, bracing her hands on his shoulders as she rode him, rough and needy, his hips chasing hers. “Come for me, Swan,” he growled, hand smacking her ass. “Let me feel it.”</p>
<p>She bit her lip hard, his roughness exactly what she needed. Another handful of strokes and she was there again, walls contracting viciously around his cock, milking him for all he was worth. Killian cursed as his orgasm overwhelmed him, his little minx perfect in every way. Lungs burning for air, he held her close, groaning as she shivered with aftershocks, her walls rippling along his softening shaft.</p>
<p>Emma laid her head on his shoulder, peace settling in her bones even as she gasped for breath. She would never take this for granted, how amazing they were together. Killian rubbed her lower back lazily; she felt gentle hands in her hair. She practically purred in content, the little ways they took care of her unbearably sweet.</p>
<p>“Rest, love,” Liam whispered. He pulled on his pants and turned his attention to the dinner she had been making. Now that he could focus, it smelled amazing. He had to fetch his wand from his robes, letting Killian clean their lady up while he finished her earlier task. By the time dinner was ready, his family was settled at the table, Emma adorably sexy in his soft button down shirt.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Liam.”</p>
<p>“You know I don’t mind.” He laid a plate piled high with pasta and sauce in front of her. “You should eat up.”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes. “I swear, you guys are gonna make me fat.”</p>
<p>Killian laughed. “You’ve been in Britain how long now, lass? You’re still as skinny as they day we met.”</p>
<p>She swatted at him. “Hey!”</p>
<p>Liam sat on Emma’s right side. “Afraid I have to agree with the lass, brother. She’s definitely not the same.”</p>
<p>“I meant it as a compliment!”</p>
<p>“Sure you did,” Emma countered, voice dripping with sarcasm.</p>
<p>Killian growled in frustration. “You’re deliberately misunderstanding me.”</p>
<p>Emma took pity on him and slipped her hand into his. “I know. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>He squeezed her hand. “Truthfully, I always thought you were a pretty lass. Far too much to spend time with the likes of us.”</p>
<p>Emma flushed. “You guys were my first friends. My best friends. There’s nowhere else I ever wanted to be.” She reached for Liam’s hand too, giving them both a squeeze. “I love you. So much.”</p>
<p>“We love you too. And we’re so proud of you, love,” Liam assured her, squeezing back.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, I could still fail spectacularly.” It was a risky undertaking, one that some of their old schoolmates would love to see fail, she was sure. But she had confidence in her idea. She’d done everything right, starting with learning from the best. It helped that she had so much support at home.</p>
<p>“Where’s that Slytherin ambition?” Killian teased gently.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s still there.” She grinned. “I’m excited.”</p>
<p>“We couldn’t tell,” Liam deadpanned.</p>
<p>Emma laughed merrily; he had a point. Sex was a regular occurrence in their home; that wasn’t the first time either Liam or Killian had walked in on her in flagrante. She welcomed it, the freedom they found in this unconventional relationship. She couldn’t imagine her life without them.</p>
<p>“To be fair, Emma isn’t the only one with news.”</p>
<p>Both Liam and Emma stared at him. “Oh, tell us!” Emma cried. Now that she got a good look at him, she could see he was holding something back, something he was simply bursting to tell them.</p>
<p>Killian had to find his robes on the floor; it would be better to show them, he was certain. He grabbed the scroll and handed it to Liam. Liam tilted his head curiously, waiting for a better explanation. When it didn’t come, he yanked open the ribbon. Emma scooted closer, sharing Liam’s curiosity.</p>
<p>
  <em>Dear Killian Jones,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>You are hereby invited to the ninety seventh Triwizard Tournament, to be held at Hogwarts School Witchcraft and Wizardry. This invitation gives you access to all events and allows you to bring up to two guests. We look forward to seeing you there!</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Sincerely,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Marigold Williams</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Department of Magical Games and Sports</em>
</p>
<p>Emma jumped up and threw her arms around Killian. “You got it! You got the assignment!”</p>
<p>Killian smiled into her hair, squeezing her waist. “Aye, that I did.”</p>
<p>Liam stood too, wrapping up his family in a bear hug. “We’re so proud of you, brother.”</p>
<p>“Ginny brought it to me this afternoon,” he confessed, so happy he could share this with his family. “I think I read it about ten times before it sank in.”</p>
<p>“You earned it,” Emma said firmly. “You’ve been working so hard.” Killian wrote for the <em>Daily Prophet</em>, mostly covering Quidditch. He traveled all over the southern part of the country, watching and reporting on matches, interviewing players. He had ambitions for more and this was a crucial first step.</p>
<p>“There’s more,” he replied, unable to wipe the smile from his face. “I’m going to be commentating.”</p>
<p>“Seriously?”</p>
<p>Killian glared at his brother. “You don’t think I can?”</p>
<p>“I know you can, Killian. There’s no one who’d be better than you. You did every match when we were in school. I’ve just never heard of them giving it to someone so young. This is an ancient tournament.”</p>
<p>“It’s a huge deal,” Emma agreed. “I’m so happy for you, Killian.”</p>
<p>He kissed her brow. “Thank you, love. You’ll come? Both of you?”</p>
<p>“You even have to ask?” Liam asked, hurt.</p>
<p>“Emma’s just getting started and you’re busy at the Ministry,” Killian argued.</p>
<p>“It’s just a few weekends,” Liam chided. “We’ll make a lark of it, yeah?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, it will be kinda nice to see Hogwarts again. I miss it.”</p>
<p>Liam took her hand and spun her around; she landed against his broad chest with a whoosh. “You miss sneaking around, dodging Filch and the teachers?”</p>
<p>“Don’t forget Mrs. Norris,” Killian chuckled. “I swear that ruddy cat isn’t normal!”</p>
<p>Emma giggled. “You’re just upset you got stuck in detention.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe out of all times we were out of bed, I was the only one who got caught.” It still smarted; Filch made him scrub out all the toilets on the third floor, without magic! There were times he swore his elbow still hurt.</p>
<p>Emma stepped into his arms, kissing him soundly. “Didn’t I make it up to you?”</p>
<p>The memory of her stretched on the bed before him stayed with him for weeks afterward. “Was that for me or for you, my love?”</p>
<p>She kissed the corner of his lips, lovingly. “Hmm, both of us, I think?”</p>
<p>Liam touched her waist, lips caressing her ear. “All of us, sweet.”</p>
<p>She smiled, slipping into that familiar place between them. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>“So it’s settled, we’re going to back to Hogwarts.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>Five Years Ago</strong>
</p>
<p>Emma glanced left and right before turning the corner, relying the shadows to disguise her. She left her robes back in her dormitory; she was already late. It took Ashley forever to fall asleep and Emma couldn’t afford to raise the other girl’s suspicions. As far as her dormmates were concerned, everything was as it ever was, Emma Swan and the Jones boys, best of friends, inseparable, in so far as House loyalties would allow. Emma didn’t care about any of that bullshit; so what if she was a Slytherin? Liam was a Ravenclaw and Killian, a Hufflepuff. Those distinctions were meaningless to her. The Jones brothers were the very first people in her new life to make her feel welcome. They quickly became fast friends, sharing all sort of adventures.</p>
<p>The change in their relationship was new, still so new, but it felt right. Sometimes she still couldn’t quite believe it; for months, Emma agonized over her feelings, deeply afraid of ruining everything. Then one fateful day, it all changed.</p>
<p>She hurried up the stairs, careful to jump the trick step that flummoxed even the most veteran Hogwarts student. It was a long way from the Slytherin common room to the seventh floor. She only hoped they’d wait for her.</p>
<p>“Give me the bloody thing,” Liam snapped, grabbing for the magazine.</p>
<p>“Get your own,” Killian groused, dancing out of his brother’s reach. As the younger and shorter brother, he could move just a touch faster. There was a reason his big brother was a bloody Beater. Liam was tall, broad; he’d added nearly six inches to his already tall frame. Killian was catching up, his trousers were starting to get too short. Fortunately, Emma didn’t seem to care.</p>
<p>“Don’t fight, boys!” a tinny voice cried. “There’s enough for both of you!”</p>
<p>Killian examined the photograph more closely, the positions of the people. “Bloody hell.”</p>
<p>“What?” Liam glanced over his brother’s shoulder, eyes big as saucers. “Damn.”</p>
<p>Killian turned the picture this way and that, trying to figure it all out. “Is that even possible?”</p>
<p>Liam was already picturing their beautiful Slytherin moaning in ecstasy between them. “I bloody well hope so.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?” came the voice.</p>
<p>“Leave them alone!”</p>
<p>Killian was more than used to the people in photographs talking, but he’d never seen anything quite like this. Although, he was still shocked the Come and Go Room even gave them such treats. He laid the magazine on the nearby table, smoothing it out. “No, you don’t have to,” he assured the woman in the photo. “What were you going to say?”</p>
<p>She looked up from her prone position, a brilliant smile on her face. “Oh! No one <em>ever</em> asks my advice!”</p>
<p>Liam bent over the magazine too, his curiosity peaked. “We’ll take whatever you can give us,” he said fervently.</p>
<p>The men in the photo scowled, but the lady ignored them. “Oh! Two of you! Who’s the lucky lady?”</p>
<p>Both Killian and Liam blushed. “Emma. Her name is Emma.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s a pretty name.”</p>
<p>“Would you stop bleating? You’re ruining the mood!”</p>
<p>The woman in the picture huffed and pushed her lovers away. She didn’t bother to cover her modesty, apparently unashamed of her nudity. Given what she had been doing, it was to be expected, Liam supposed. He still couldn’t quite believe his eyes; would Emma enjoy such a thing? Did they dare ask her? Hell, he still woke up convinced the last few blissful months were all a dream, that he was still pining for the woman who captured his heart. Granted, he never imagined <em>this</em> but it was better than not having her at all. He’d do anything to have her smile.</p>
<p>“Now, what do you boys want to know?”</p>
<p>Killian snatched up a parchment and a quill. “Everything,” he answered, hungry for knowledge. He supposed other boys would be titillated by the magazines he and his brother discovered in the room, but he only had eyes for one lady. It was such a relief to have her at last, but he desperately wanted to keep her. He wanted his Swan to be happy.</p>
<p>Their would-be teacher looked delighted. “Oh, you are a pretty one!” She glanced at Liam. “And you! Your lady <em>is</em> lucky! Brothers?”</p>
<p>Liam nodded, feeling more embarrassed by the moment. “Aye.”</p>
<p>“I love it!” She rubbed her hands together and got down to business. Both boys blushed furiously as they asked their questions, scribbling down every word. Liam’s ears burned as he questioned her particularly about the position they found her, locked in a passionate embrace, impaled between two very…<em>virile</em> lovers. She teased them gently but was very forthcoming, spinning out all sorts of ways for them to satisfy their lady’s desires.</p>
<p>Emma breathed a sigh of relief when she reached the seventh floor, hurrying to pace in front of where she knew the door to be. <em>A room where we can be alone,</em> she thought. <em>A room where we can do as we please.</em> She thought that over and over, and on the seventh pass the door appeared. She rushed for it, slipping inside.</p>
<p>“Now you want to take your time,” an unfamiliar female voice was saying. “Patience is key. She’ll adore you for it, I promise you!”</p>
<p>Jealousy burned in her belly. Just who the <em>hell </em>were they talking to?! Was she so easily forgotten? “What the hell is going on here?” Her voice was shrill, dread settling in her belly. It hit her like a tidal wave; she couldn’t lose them, they were her only family.</p>
<p>Liam and Killian turned instantly, guilt written all over their faces. “Emma.” “Swan.” They spoke together and it made her heart hurt.</p>
<p>“What…what’s going on?” She spoke softly, almost a whisper, suddenly very afraid.</p>
<p>“Oh love.” It broke Liam’s heart that she even considered they might be faithless to her. Faithless like everyone else in her life. He stepped forward, reaching for her. “It’s nothing, I promise.”</p>
<p>She wanted to believe him. But she couldn’t silence the voices in her head. “What were you doing?”</p>
<p>Killian snatched up the magazine and handed it to her. “We were…ah…becoming…enlightened?”</p>
<p>Hope surging in her heart, she took it from him, flipping through it. Tears stung her eyes, even as she burst out laughing. Merlin’s beard, she’d been so silly! Honestly, she didn’t know which was funnier, her unfounded fear or her boys finding wizarding porn! She paused on a few choice pages, biting her lip as she drank in the images, the moving pictures leaving little to the imagination. “Oh my god.”</p>
<p>Liam blushed harder, a bit hurt that she was laughing. “I’m glad you find it so funny.”</p>
<p>She tossed it aside, hurrying to his side. “Come on, it’s a little funny?” When his frown didn’t disappear, she squeezed his hand. “Hey, I didn’t mean anything by it. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>His pique melted under her earnest emerald gaze. He was helpless when it came to her. “Did you ever think we could betray you, love?”</p>
<p>Her heart clenched, the endearment so much more now. They hadn’t quite said the words yet, but she could see it in their eyes. They felt the same way she did. She felt guilty at first, not wishing to hurt either of them. But things were working out so far. She prayed they always would. “No. Not really. I just…I heard…her and I…” She glanced away, unable to look either of them in the eye. “I think I was jealous.”</p>
<p>“Nothing to be jealous of, Swan,” Killian assured her. “I promise.”</p>
<p>“Tell that to Jenny. She asked me to put in a good word for her after Herbology!”</p>
<p>Killian sighed; Jenny had had designs on him since their third year. He never encouraged her feelings, but two years on, she was still trying. “I hate you were in that position, lass.” He closed the gap between them, tenderly cupping her cheek. “I’ll talk to her.”</p>
<p>“And tell her what? We agreed that no one could know about us! Not as long as we’re in school!”</p>
<p>Killian hated all this sneaking around, even though it had its perks. It certainly made these stolen moments more intense. “I’ll simply tell her that she’s a friend, nothing more. I lo…I only want you, Swan.” He cursed silently; he’d nearly said it. He wanted to, but he didn’t want to take things too fast. He loved her so long now; it was a part of him.</p>
<p>Emma nodded, covering his hand with hers, holding him there so she could kiss his palm. “I know.” She held Liam’s hand as she stood on her toes to brush her lips to Killian’s. In the short time they’d been together, they were addicted to kissing. She pressed closer, chasing his lips. Killian groaned, hands fumbling for purchase, clumsily finding her waist.</p>
<p>“Emma.”</p>
<p>She broke the kiss, blushing as she turned to the elder Jones. Still, when his lips touched hers, she moaned, his kiss still clumsy but so sweet. He held her gently, like she was precious, and it made her heart sing. “Hmm, perhaps we should put some of your new knowledge to use?”</p>
<p>Liam groaned; leave it to his Emma to make everything better. “I do love the way your mind works, love.” He kissed her again, tongue touching the seam of her lips. She opened eagerly, always so eager, it made him giddy. It was so different now from the first time he kissed her; he was hesitant, unsure, even though her lips tasted better than he imagined. She still tasted of berries and sunshine, but there was something more to it now, a fire, a passion that left him in awe.</p>
<p>Killian pressed up behind her, deftly plucking the pins from her golden tresses. They were still learning how to be in this relationship, how to make her happy. His patience was rewarded when she turned again, smiling as she pulled him in for a needy kiss. “What is it with you and my hair, Jones?”</p>
<p>He grinned, lips touching her mouth, her cheek, her racing pulse. He ran his fingers through it. “Do you wish me to desist?”</p>
<p>“Never.” She moaned as those fingers tugged gently on her long tresses, sending sparks of need down her spine. “Oh.”</p>
<p>“Bloody hell.” Liam wet his lips, his blood rushing south. Emma rarely hesitated to take what she wanted and what she wanted was them. Clumsily, Killian tried to maneuver her toward the huge fluffy bed the room conjured for them, suddenly ravenous for her. How long had it been since they lay together? How long since he felt her soft skin against his?</p>
<p>“Merlin’s beard,” Liam swore, his patience fraying. He scooped Emma up bodily, her merry giggles music to his ears. Once he deposited her on the bed, she yanked him forward for a sloppy kiss.</p>
<p>“Impatient, Liam?” she teased. “Isn’t it supposed to be a virtue?”</p>
<p>He growled, his big hand sliding up her clothed belly. “You heard that, huh?”</p>
<p>She nodded. “Would you show me?”</p>
<p>“Gladly.” Killian joined them and together, he and his brother slowly stripped her bare, shirt, skirt and wool socks peeled from her body. Emma’s heart raced, her skin crackling with need, the heated looks in their eyes scorching. She didn’t have time to feel embarrassed about her plain cotton underthings, Killian’s mouth on hers, distracting her as Liam yanked the panties down her legs. Every time they were together like this it was better, less fumbling, more demanding. In a few short months, they’d become addicted to each other.</p>
<p>Emma keened softly, Liam lightly stroking her sex. “Oh god.”</p>
<p>“Hold her, brother,” Liam said, nodding at Killian.</p>
<p>Killian hummed, quickly shucking his t-shirt, then his trousers. Emma sat up, allowing him to settle in behind her, legs on either side of her hips, her back against his chest. She turned her head and kissed him awkwardly, guiding his hand to her breast. “Don’t stop.”</p>
<p>Liam flopped down between her legs, spreading her thighs even further. “Already wet, love?” He gave her a long lick, forever marveling at her hairless mound. He’d never asked how she did it, which potion or spell, but he loved it. And she smelled delicious.</p>
<p>“Liam…god, more.” It was a new kind of torture, his mouth where she needed it, but only giving her the lightest of touches.</p>
<p>“Now who’s impatient?”</p>
<p>She scowled, choosing to place herself in their hands. Together, she and Killian removed her final stitch of clothing, leaving her completely nude.  Once, she’d been shy, secretly hesitant about taking this step with them, but they were so sweet and tender; it melted her heart. They were the first boys she’d ever been naked with and if she had her way, they would be the only ones.</p>
<p>As if reading her mind, Killian palmed her full breasts. In the past two years, he’d lost count of the number of times he’d touched himself to thoughts of his Swan naked, her breasts especially. Full, they fit perfectly in his hands, skin flushed, nipples hard and aching, begging for his touch. Now she was his, pleading for him.</p>
<p>Emma fisted the sheet, her mind racing in a thousand different directions. Liam’s mouth got bolder, tongue rimming her hole, occasionally pressing inside her heat. Killian rubbed her nipples, gently rolled them between his fingers, making her cry out, each pinch sending a jolt to her swollen clit. “Fuck,” she panted, desperately trying to move, to find friction, anything to ease the ache in her belly.</p>
<p>Liam couldn’t tear his eyes away from her, the look of almost pained ecstasy on her face, the rosy tinge to her lovely skin. He marveled at all the ways she let them touch her. Slowly, he slid one thick finger inside her, cock twitching in his pants as she moaned. “Bloody hell, love.”</p>
<p>Emma bit her lip, staring down at him his heavy lidded eyes. <em>“More.”</em></p>
<p>He was quickly learning to heed her demands, simply wanting her to feel good. He added a second finger, stretching her tight hole, and pumped them slowly. “Like this?”</p>
<p>She hummed, hands urging Killian to increase his attention to her breasts. “Just like that. Feels good.”</p>
<p>“You are so beautiful,” Killian murmured into her hair. Emma was always pretty, but now she was stunning. He couldn’t get enough of her lithe toned body, soft in all the right places. It was taxing his own patience, her arse nestled right against his cock, her gentle writhing making him crazy. Still, he knew it would be worth it when he got to have her.</p>
<p>Emma could feel Killian, hard and thick against her and it made her ache all over again. The shyness they’d first encountered was gone; she loved the sight of her boys naked. Killian had grown so much in the last year, still a little gangly, but filling out. Liam was even taller, broad, still learning how to use his body to bring her the most pleasure. She would gladly spend the rest of her life teaching him.</p>
<p>“Liam…your mouth,” she panted, trying to rock against his large hand. “Put your mouth on me.” He started to extract his fingers but she shook her head frantically. “No! Both! Please!”</p>
<p>Liam looked a little unsure, but did she asked. He kept the steady rhythm with his fingers, ducking down the lick at her clit. The effect was almost instantaneous. Emma moaned loudly, arching against Killian’s chest. A few more strokes and licks and she was shaking, hovering right on the edge of orgasm. Liam went with his instincts and sucked hard, nearly coming in his pants as she climaxed, walls clamping hard around his fingers.</p>
<p>“Fucking hell,” Killian swore, holding her steady against him. Perhaps the witch had been right. He’d never seen Emma climax like that.</p>
<p>It took her several moments to come back to herself, her skin still tingled. But it only made her want more. “Wow.”</p>
<p>“Good?”</p>
<p>Her eyes fluttered open, a sated green that made Liam’s chest swell with pride. “Very.” She crooked her finger, beckoning him. Liam leaned in, kissing her sweetly, growling as she deepened it, tongue tangling with his. “But now I want more.”</p>
<p>Killian shivered. “Swan…”</p>
<p>She wriggled against him. “Hmm, I know you want me, Jones.”</p>
<p>“So much, love.”</p>
<p>She smiled at Liam. “Stretch out on the bed? Killian’s been so patient.”</p>
<p>Liam nodded, yanking off his pants as he heeded her. Emma turned and kissed his brother, deep toe curling kisses that used to make Liam jealous, but not so much anymore. He was discovering he enjoyed watching them together, or more precisely <em>Emma</em>, as she took her pleasure. It surprised him, but he didn’t want to question it. Now when being with both of them made Emma so happy.</p>
<p>She slipped her hand between them, lightly stroking his thick shaft. She could feel Killian practically vibrating with need, a need she felt as well. It was why they took such risks to be together like this; it was overwhelming, this desire. “Touch me,” she whispered, hand still gripping him firmly. “God.”</p>
<p>Killian obeyed, breathing deeply in a vain attempt to keep his fraying composure. If she wasn’t careful, he’d spill in her hand. How embarrassing would that be? “Emma…” He groaned as he touched her wet slit, her arousal coating his fingers. “Fuck, I need you. Need to be inside you.”</p>
<p>She nodded hard, all too eager to be filled. “Yes, yes!” She kissed him one last time then turned, getting on her hands and knees, right between Liam’s spread legs. She was spread so wide her knees rested right against his. She locked gazes with Liam, who knew exactly what was about to happen.</p>
<p>Killian snarled as he struggled to disentangle himself from the bunched sheet. Once free of the material, he moved up behind Emma, grabbing her hips. She squealed in delight, leaning down on her elbows, forcing her hips higher. It was one of the poses she’d seen briefly in the magazine; she was sure it would feel incredible. “Now, Killian!”</p>
<p>He’d learned very quickly to heed a begging Emma. She was emphatic about what she wanted, he and his brother were merely the lucky blokes she chose. Killian was in awe every time she offered her body so freely; all he wanted was to please her. Still, he couldn’t resist teasing her, just a little. He took himself in hand, stroking her swollen flesh with the tip of his cock, smearing precum. Emma whimpered and whined, unconsciously forcing her hips back, desperate to feel him within her. “Please!”</p>
<p>“Bloody hell.” Using one hand to hold her, he surged forward, cock sinking inside her scorching heat. She was so <em>hot</em> and <em>tight</em>; he swore he would never tire of this, of her. “Fuck, <em>fuck.”</em></p>
<p>Emma moaned loudly, biting her lip. It felt so good, the stretch, the penetration deep, making her feel full. “Yes, yes, yes,” she chanted softly, back arching as her lover slowly pulled out and sank back in. “Don’t stop.”</p>
<p>Liam groaned, the look on his Emma’s face stunningly beautiful. His cock twitched, hungry for her, to be the one to make her feel good. “Emma…”</p>
<p>She wet her lips, her eyes locking with Liam’s stormy blues. He stared at her with something akin to awe, lust burning there and something more. Something she felt too. Something she felt for both brothers. She wanted to say the words, but she was scared. Everything she’d ever tried to love left her, except for them. She nodded, letting him scoot closer, until her mouth hovered over his crotch. Propping herself on one elbow, Emma swept her hair over her shoulder, needing it out of the way. She smiled wickedly, tongue darting out to lick his long thick shaft. The first time she saw them naked was an…eye opening experience, to say the least. She wondered fleetingly if their size was normal, but now she reveled in it. She licked in time with Killian’s thrusts, moving from root to tip, stroking the rigid flesh.</p>
<p>Liam’s eyes rolled back, her tongue warm on his sensitive skin. “Fuck, Emma.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please.” She curled her fingers around him, watching avidly as his foreskin rose up and down his shaft. She pressed her tongue to the underside of his tip, his deep moan of pleasure going right to her clit. “You like this?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he hissed, hips jerking into her hand. “More.”</p>
<p>Emma nodded, sighing as Killian took her just a little harder. “Oh my god, yes!” Killian grunted, feeling her getting wetter with every thrust. As he watched, she took his brother’s cock into her mouth, bobbing slowly, sloppy wet sounds making his cock throb. She was a goddess between them, allowing them to fill her. The way she moved, rocking back and forth, taking them deeper with every rock.</p>
<p>“Emma, Emma, Emma,” he chanted, fingers digging into her hips. He could feel his orgasm tingling at the base of his spine; he needed to come. But he needed to feel her more. He slid one hand under her, fumbling until he found her swollen nub. He <em>felt</em> her shiver, her inner walls began to quiver. He groaned, loving the way she felt around him. “That’s it, love. Let go.”</p>
<p>She wanted to hang on, she wanted this feeling to never end, but her lover’s touch was too much. She exploded, releasing Liam’s cock with a pop, a scream in her throat. It never seemed to matter how loud they were; the room made sure they were never discovered. In this place, they were safe. She could feel Killian holding back, his grip on her so tight, but she <em>loved</em> it. “Killian…god, I need to feel you. Fuck!”</p>
<p>He grunted, finally allowing himself to give into the intense pleasure. Skin smacked against skin, his whole body shaking as he spilled himself inside her, her name a prayer on his lips.</p>
<p>Emma panted hard, her forehead resting on Liam’s hip, her skin crackling and sparking. Killian slumped over her back, breathing labored, lips brushing her skin. He loved this girl so much; she made him insanely happy. He never thought he could feel happiness like this.</p>
<p>They stayed that way until he softened and slipped out, Emma whimpering. She could feel the need rolling off Liam in waves, need she shared. She still didn’t quite understand the feelings she had, why she needed them both so much, but she was helpless against it. She felt Killian kiss her back tenderly, silently giving her his blessing. He rolled off, and watched with heavy lidded eyes as his Swan crawled up Liam’s body, kissing every inch of skin she could reach.</p>
<p>His skin was rough on hers, hot to the touch, chest hair rubbing her sensitive nipples. “Do you want me, Liam?”</p>
<p>He stroked the length of her spine, struggling to keep still. Every instinct was screaming at him to take her, hard and fast, but he let her play. Her wet flesh briefly touched his rigid cock, drawing a groan from his throat. “Fuck yes,” he breathed, rocking against her. She captured his lips in a hungry kiss, grinding right back, teasing him. “Please, love. Let me have you.”</p>
<p>She nipped sharply at his lips, fingers digging into his shoulders. “Come ‘ere,” she whispered, coaxing him up. Once they were sitting up, Emma wrapped her legs around his waist. “Wanna help me out here?”</p>
<p>Liam smirked, lifting her hips and guiding her to his cock. He slid in easily, his lover already wet and ready for him. “Love the way you feel, darling,” he murmured, lips hot on her neck. “Wet and tight.”</p>
<p>She hummed, head falling back as she rode him slowly. His pelvis ground against her clit perfectly, his cock filled her up. “So good.”</p>
<p>Killian moved, his hands itching to touch all that flushed skin. Emma inhaled sharply as he settled behind her, hands sliding up her sides. “Gorgeous,” he whispered in her ear, thumbs brushing the edge of her breasts.</p>
<p>She felt like she was on fire, two sets of Quidditch roughened hands on her body. “More.”</p>
<p>Liam growled, sucking harder on her pulse. “You like this, lass? Both of us touching you?”</p>
<p>She nodded, tightening her legs around his hips. “God yes. Love your hands on me.”</p>
<p>“Like this?” Killian kissed her shoulder, his hands sliding up to cup her bouncing breasts. He played with her nipples, rubbing and pinching.</p>
<p>“Yes!” She jerked, changing the angle of Liam’s shallow thrusts. “Oh <em>fuck</em>, <em>fuck!</em>” He was striking a spot she didn’t know was there, white hot pleasure boiling in her veins. “Harder! Harder!”</p>
<p>Together, Liam and Killian grasped her hips, handling her roughly, impaling her on Liam’s thick shaft. She screamed, long and loud, shaking in their arms as she climaxed harder than she ever had before. It felt incredible, every cell on fire, bone deep bliss searing her. It didn’t stop, rippling out from her very core, until she couldn’t breathe. Her boys held her securely, keeping her pinned between them. Liam held on as long as he could, but she felt too good. He grunted deeply as he came, cock pulsing within her tight rippling sheath.</p>
<p>She felt like she was floating, gentle lips on her skin. She kissed back, her movements sluggish but her passion shining through. She was learning their kisses by touch alone, her eyes closed, mouth fused to warm soft lips. Liam was thorough, exploring her mouth, tongue tangling with hers. Faintly, she could taste a remnant of herself on his lips and it made her shiver in pleasure. Still unwilling to break the spell, she turned her head, sighing as a second pair of lips found hers. She twisted, cupping his cheek, the beginnings of scruff rubbing her palm. If Liam was methodical, Killian was wicked, making her toes curl.</p>
<p>“Hmmm,” she hummed, her hands sliding over their skin.</p>
<p>“Emma,” Liam murmured, his hand covering hers. He brought it to his lips, unwilling to stop kissing her.</p>
<p>She uncurled herself reluctantly, stretching out over the soft sheets, her lovers laying on either side. A tender kiss to Liam’s lips, another to Killian’s, smiling to herself as they snuggled close to her. Each rested a hand on her belly, Killian tugging the covers up over them. “Cold, darling?”</p>
<p>“No, but thanks.”</p>
<p>Lips touched her temple. “Anything for you, Swan.”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes good naturedly. “Still dramatic, Jones.”</p>
<p>“One of my many qualities, love.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes I wonder if you got Sorted into the right House,” she teased.</p>
<p>“Me? Where else would I be, if not in Hufflepuff?”</p>
<p>She grinned. “True. It suits you.” He was loyal and true, hard working. He accepted her for exactly who she was, never asking for more she was willing to give. He and his brother were closer to her than any people on earth in more ways than one.</p>
<p>“What about me?”</p>
<p>Emma laughed. “What about you, Mr. Know It All?”</p>
<p>“Oi!”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t the one looking for sex advice from a porn magazine!”</p>
<p>He blushed. “Did it work?”</p>
<p>She felt a pleasant ache in her core. “Hmm, yeah. Very much.”</p>
<p>“Minx.”</p>
<p>“You love it.” She said it so casually, only blushing when she saw his eyes widen. “Um…”</p>
<p>Liam took her hand and squeezed. “I do, lass.” He took a deep breath, deciding to take a chance. He rarely did, thinking things through before acting, always cerebral. But if anyone was worth taking a chance on, it was his Emma. “I love you.”</p>
<p>Tears stung her eyes, her lips trembled. She never expected the words to hit her so hard. Liam <em>loved</em> her. The lonely lost little girl finally had someone who loved her.</p>
<p>“I love you too, Emma,” Killian said fervently, squeezing her other hand. “I’ve wanted to say it for so long.” It felt like a weight rising off his shoulders, telling the one he loved at last.</p>
<p>Wetness splashed on her cheeks, her heart raced in her chest. The words were on the tip of her tongue, her feelings threatening to burst out of her.</p>
<p>“Don’t cry, sweetheart,” Liam said, thumb brushing her cheek.</p>
<p>She sucked in a shaky breath, mentally cursing herself for crying. But they were happy tears. She wanted to say it back, <em>needed</em> to say it back. Because they were loved. They were <em>so loved</em>, it made her chest hurt. If it were anyone else, she might never find the courage, but these were her boys. Her dearest friends, the two people who truly <em>knew</em> her. “I…” She hated that her voice shook. “I love you. I love both of you <em>so</em> much.”</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, no longer trusting herself.</p>
<p>“Oh love.” Killian hugged her close. “It’s okay, lass. It’s okay.”</p>
<p>“is it?” This was her fear, a fear never spoken. A fear that they would reject her if she couldn’t choose. But she couldn’t. She loved them equally, they were a part of her.</p>
<p>Killian smiled at her. “Why wouldn’t it be?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know?” But she felt better the moment she felt Liam’s hands on her shoulders. “Liam?”</p>
<p>“Shh, my love.” He brushed her skin with soft lips. If he learned anything in the last few months, it was that life was too precious to be squandered. He’d spent many a night lying awake, wondering just how this arrangement they were embarking on would work. The longer he thought, he realized nothing mattered but his love for her. If being with them both made her happy, then he could give her that.</p>
<p>Emma turned so she could see his face. “Please say something?”</p>
<p>“What’s there to say? Knowing you love me…that’s all I could ever ask for, lass.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>The latent fear in her eyes broke his heart. His Emma was strong and fearless, tackling any challenge placed before her with grace and wicked sense of humor. His life was richer the moment she stepped into it, a scared little girl from another country. Scared but brave. She was always so brave. He could never reject her. His mother’s words echoed in his head. <em>Follow your heart, Liam. It won’t lead you astray.</em> His heart belonged to Emma Swan, of that he was certain. “We can make this work, Emma. If that’s what you want.”</p>
<p>“Liam…”</p>
<p>“It’s what I want too,” he said, pressing a finger to her lips.</p>
<p>“And me,” Killian added, smiling. “It might not always be easy…but what we have now…it’s worth it. You’re worth everything, Swan.”</p>
<p>Happiness threatened to make her heart beat out of her chest. The last few months had been hard on all of them, but now she could see a real future for them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>Fall 2009</strong>
</p>
<p>“Killian, have you seen my sweater?” Emma called.</p>
<p>“Which one?”</p>
<p>“My school one!”</p>
<p>He poked his head out of the bathroom. “Why’d you want old thing?”</p>
<p>She shot him a saucy grin. “Do you really want me to answer that, Jones?”</p>
<p>He groaned inwardly; she was such a naughty girl, his Swan. He loved it. “Planning on getting into mischief, darling?”</p>
<p>“Always, Jones.”</p>
<p>She found her sweater in the back of the closet, carefully adding it to her trunk. She was <em>pretty</em> sure her old uniform would fit. They hadn’t been out of school <em>that</em> long, but then again, she and Killian left Hogwarts a little sooner than most. It was the best decision she’d ever made. Well, the second best decision. She never truly had choice in the first. Falling in love with the Jones brothers was easier than breathing, happening right under her nose.</p>
<p>“Emma, Killian! Knight Bus will be here any minute!”</p>
<p>“Why are we taking that contraption again?” Killian complained, pulling his shirt over his head. “Can’t we just Apparate?”</p>
<p>“You want to Apparate with luggage?” Emma asked, snapping the lid on the trunk.</p>
<p>“It’s only for the weekend?”</p>
<p>She wrapped her arms around his neck, smirking as she leaned in to bite his earlobe. “Do you really think clothes are the only things in that trunk, Jones?”</p>
<p>He shivered, her breath warm on his skin. “My Slytherin goddess.” He kissed her hard, yanking her hips flush to his. “Bloody hell, I love you.”</p>
<p>She fisted his hair, pressing herself firmly against his hard body. “Love you too.”</p>
<p>Teasing him when she knew full well he couldn’t make love to her. Typical. Still, he loved it. “Liam’s waiting.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I’m counting on it.”</p>
<p>Killian reluctantly let her go, reaching for his wand. He tapped her trunk with his wand, bewitching it to hover. He led it down the stairs, Emma following in his wake. Liam was waiting, looking very handsome in Muggle jeans and her favorite blue sweater. “Hey.”</p>
<p>“Get everything packed, love?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” She stood up on her toes to kiss him sweetly. “Ready to see the old stomping grounds?”</p>
<p>He wrapped his arm around her, tucking her into his side. “I think so.”</p>
<p>“Bittersweet?”</p>
<p>She knew him too well. “A little. Those last couple of months weren’t exactly pleasant.” For more than a year, they’d managed to keep their true relationship a secret, but somehow, someone found out. Within a week, it was the talk of school, Emma Swan and the Jones boys. They got called into the Head’s Office, enduring a very embarrassing interview with McGonagall. But since they were all of age, there wasn’t anything she could technically do to stop them. Liam could take people looking down at him, judging him, but unfortunately, Emma endured the most abuse. The teachers tried to stop it, but they couldn’t be everywhere. She put on her usual brave face, giving as good as she got, but they could see the toll it took on her the few times they managed to find some time alone. Once, Liam found her crying in the Room of Requirement, her walls shattered.</p>
<p>Sending his brother and his love <em>back</em> to that place for their seventh year was the hardest thing Liam had ever done.</p>
<p>“You okay?”</p>
<p>Her gentle voice coaxed him back to the present. “Shouldn’t I be asking you that?”</p>
<p>“You always did worry too much.” She kissed his cheek. “I’m excited actually. I know things got a bit nasty there at the end, but Hogwarts was really the first place I ever felt at home. I miss that.”</p>
<p>Killian threaded his fingers with hers. “Things are better now, brother. We can’t change the world overnight.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re probably right.”</p>
<p>“Let’s just stick together, okay? This isn’t just about us, Liam. This could be Killian’s big break.”</p>
<p>He nodded. “You’re absolutely right. We’re here for you, brother.”</p>
<p>Killian smiled hesitantly. “That means a lot to me, Liam.”</p>
<p>Liam was about to say something else when they heard the all too familiar bang of the Knight Bus. Emma got the door while the boys lifted her trunk. They didn’t want to draw the attention of their Muggle neighbors. Once safely outside, she muttered the incantation to lock the door. The moment she stepped on to the side walk, she could almost feel Number Twelve Grimmauld Place shrink back into nothing, hidden by the enchantments placed on it by her secretive ancestors. It was a hell of a way to live. Still, it was theirs.</p>
<p>“Three for Hogsmeade?” asked the conductor, his violent purple uniform garish to her eyes.</p>
<p>“Yep.”</p>
<p>“That’ll be fifteen Galleons, seven Knuts and two Sickles, please.”</p>
