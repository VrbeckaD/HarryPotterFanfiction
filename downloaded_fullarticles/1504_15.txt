    <p>How long had he been there?</p><p>Days? Weeks? Months? Years? Mercy Lewis, he prayed it wasn’t years. How could he have survived years in this prison of darkness?</p><p>At least he felt numb. That everything felt numb. The lack of feeling had taken place of the pain he had been in before and now he welcomed it. It was better than sitting there, twitching from the curses, hearing that man's laugh among his screams. Better than listening to ghosts of his siblings voices begging him to wake up for another round of torture, better than his parents saying that they had raised him to be stronger. Numbness was a welcomed interruption to that. But then he heard footsteps and those weary muscles numbed to anything tensed in panic.</p><p>He was back…He was…</p><p>Voices washed over him, disorienting and chaotic and he tried to adjust as he caught snippets of the conversation.</p><p>“Director Graves!!!”</p><p>“Mercy Lewis…</p><p>“His leg...his arm...look at-!”</p><p>“We...him!!”</p><p>“Is he alive?!”</p><p>
  <i>Goldstein?</i>
</p><p>Wearily, Percival opened his eyes and the blurry images danced around him. More than one. Did that mean...</p><p>"Mr. Graves! You're safe, please calm down." A voice begged, resting a hand on his shoulder, and he remembered that voice. Linda...Howard. A new auror, starting out only weeks before he had been captured.</p><p>“He’s alive, but he’s bad off. We need to get him to the healers!” Another voice called out over Howard's voice, and he couldn't help but feel overwhelming relief. A raspy sound that most certainly wasn’t a whimper escaped his throat as hands, gingerly as possible, lifted him and then placed him onto what he realized slowly was a stretcher. Then the dark world was suddenly bright and he bit back the cry, closing his eyes.</p><p>When he did manage to open his eyes again, in his blurry vision and in the distance he saw a rich blue shade and a person standing a little ways away. Even from here, he couldn't help but relax at the new face. Still, he vaguely wondered who would be wearing such a coat, before unconsciousness took over again, and he welcomed sweet numbing darkness.</p>
<hr/><p>“Are we sure that that thing is well...safe?”</p><p>Newt glanced back at the American aurors with a frown, glancing back at the large cat-like creature roaming around the room, the long tail flicking side to side as it sniffed. He watched as she paused, the frill around her neck quivering for a moment before moving to another spot in the room, a rumbling coming from her chest.</p><p>“Sally is perfectly safe.”</p><p>“It’s a Sawaa. Named Sally?”</p><p>“Sally is a lovely name.” Newt replied evenly and the auror seemed to be about to argue, but a look from Tina quieted him. Sally continued forward, sniffing around the crevices of Percival Graves house.</p><p>“...why would Grindelwald keep Director Graves here? In his own house?”</p><p>“Why wouldn’t he? It’d be a controlled habitat only he could enter.” Newt replied watching Sally.</p><p>“This is ridiculous.” One of them muttered and though the others glared, Newt ignored them watching as Sally continued snuffling around. Suddenly the frilled neck unfolded, vibrating violently as she pawed at a closed door.</p><p>“Your creature’s broken Mr. Scamander. That’s just a closet.”</p><p>Tina ignored her colleague, fully trusting Newt’s creature. With all that they had done in the past few days, she couldn’t not trust them. She walked forward, hesitating only for a moment as she moved past Sally, who rumbled deeply in her throat, pawing at the door again as though to say <i>“I found him. He’s here.”</i> She glided her hand over the door, and felt a familiar magical surge.</p><p>“Maybe Grindelwald used an extension charm?” She questioned, glancing back at the other aurors who still looked unconvinced, but nodded regardless.</p><p>“Newt, maybe you should stay back.” She said softly and he nodded quickly, moving back along with Sally as the aurors advanced. They opened the closet, and uttered a few spells. Even from where Newt stood, he could see the visage of the inner closet melted away to reveal a dark tunnel and could feel the nauseating magic surrounding the hall.</p><p>“Well I’ll be damned.”</p><p>The aurors slowly moved into the hall as Tina stood with Newt.</p><p>“So...a Sawaa?”</p><p>“Oh yes, they’re located in Africa!” Newt exclaimed, almost excitedly. “I suppose they’re like lions, they certainly behave like them and are probably related to nundu's in some fashion, though from what I can tell she doesn't have the illness factor of a nundu but I’ve discovered that they have rather extraordinary tracking abilities. Found her around the same time I saved Frank. She was bad off, and must have gotten separated or was thrown out of her pride...couldn’t just leave her.”</p><p>“The fact that you’ve managed to get a wild creature to trust you…” Tina remarked as she watched Sally nuzzle Newt’s thigh, purring with pride as he scratched around her frills.</p><p>“Oh it wasn’t so difficult with her, she’s a rather sweet-”</p><p>“We found him!!”</p><p>“Is he alive?!” Tina called out, leaving Newt standing there with Sally, the former of the two opening his case, patting Sally lightly on her side as she climbed back in and gingerly he closed it.</p><p>“He’s alive, but he’s bad off. We need to get him to the healers!”</p><p>Newt looked up to watch as the group of aurors hurried past him, carrying a form on a stretcher, looking smaller than the figure that Grindelwald had impersonated. Crusted blood from lacerations and bruises that Newt could see covered his form, an unkempt beard growing on his jawline, and his right arm and leg seemed to be strangely absent, but he couldn’t be sure...as they lay under the sheet placed on him. It was a far cry from the man that Grindelwald had portrayed, and even a farther one that the aurors and Tina had told him about.</p><p>Tina was a sickly pale color as she walked towards him, and they looked like they were all holding back tears.</p><p>They had found the real Percival Graves...but…had they been too late?</p><p>Newt looked away, feeling as though he was intruding in something private, and stared out a window looking at New York’s ever changing landscape. He only glanced back when he felt as though he was being watched and noticed Percival Graves eyes opened just a bit and staring at him.</p><p>He didn’t understand why his throat seemed to close up or his heart skipped a beat. Or why he felt so alone when Percival Graves was carted away to St. Agatha’s Medical Center for Magical Maladies and Injuries. </p><p>The next day, he booked a ticket back to England and that weekend he left New York, promising to visit after his book was published.</p><p>It was just a matter of time, he concluded. </p><p>Just a matter of time</p>
