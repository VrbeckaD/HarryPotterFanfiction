    <p>
  <span>The rain poured down onto the streets of London, pooling up in the dirty crevasses of the pavement, mixing with the dust and muck, then forming tiny rivers that ran down the lanes until meeting one of the barred entrances to the sewers. The city never seemed to be much cleaner after a rain shower than before, but it was definitely at its worst during. As Hermione made her way back to the Marshalsea, the hem of her skirt got soaked in the combination of unspeakable dirt and water. Her worn brown leather shoes were  soaked through as well, but her woollen socks still kept her feet warm. She knocked on the door and Fred, the young lock-keeper at the debtor’s prison opened a narrow door in the wooden gate to check who was outside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh dear. Hermione! You’re soakin’ wet. Come in and get yourself up into the kitchen. I’m gonna have somebody fetch you some wood for the fire in your room. Why’d you not wait until this weather stopped before returnin’ here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He opened the door and she followed him up the stairs. His red hair was a little too long and his coat and breeches had seen both better days and owners better suited to their cut. Frederic – or Fred as most people called him - was poor by any man’s standards but in the Marshalsea he was the only free man and thus somewhat aloof from the other inhabitants. He had inherited the job as lock-keeper from his father and had grown up alongside Hermione, who had been raised in the Marshalsea from the age of ten. She was the daughter of a nobleman who had lost all his money in some unfortunate event and had had no relatives to release him from the prison. Mr Granger and his wife had both lived in the confinement of the Marshalsea for a bit more than a decade until both had caught the typhoid fever a year ago and no power on earth, not even the care of their poor daughter who had not once left their side for a minute, had been able to restore their health. Their sorry souls were now with God, their bodies resting in one of the mass graves at the cemetery which were dug out for those who could not afford a cross or a tombstone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione sat down at the tiny kitchen table and accepted the tea her friend offered to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I also have some biscuits left, I think,” Fred noted and dug out a tin box from one of the cupboards. “They’re proper biscuits with sugar and butter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione took one of the cookies. They tasted amazing. Like a ray of sunshine breaking through the clouds. She looked up at the lock-keeper and smiled through the tears welling up in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” she said wholeheartedly meaning not only the biscuit and the tea, but also the fact that he was one of very few friends she had in this life.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fred could have thrown her out of the Marshalsea after her parents had died. After all, she was no debtor. But he had decided that if she wanted to stay, she could live in her own little room in the front house and come and go just as she had done before. She had been working ever since she was twelve years old as a seamstress and as a kitchen maid. These days she worked as a helping hand at the local orphanage. Mending what needed to be mended for the young children and teaching the older ones how to patch up their own stockings. She had never aspired to be anything more than a working woman and Fred liked her for her modesty. He knew she could have been much more. After all, she had been born a wealthy girl.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Grangers had owned an estate in the countryside and lived a prosperous life in the better part of London. They had been well-known and well-off, wealthy enough to own three horses and a coach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>From a very early age on, Fred had noticed that Hermione loved to read. As books weren’t that easy to come by for a debtor, he had asked his father to lend her some from time to time. She had sheltered them like a treasure. When she had found out that Fred couldn’t read, she had decided there was no use in it, sat him down and taught him his letters one by one until he had felt quite like a scholar when walking the streets suddenly able to read all the signs and the headlines of the evening paper.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sometimes he caught himself wondering whether she’d make him a good wife, but then he always caught himself, remembering that even though fallen upon black days, she was after all a gentleman’s daughter. And he was just the lock-keeper of the Marshalsea.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tea’s good,” he said, sitting down next to his friend with his own cup full of steaming brown liquid. “Takes away the damp and makes you all warm inside on a day like this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tea’s good,” she agreed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then she rummaged in her coat and pulled out a small package.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you haven’t had dinner yet; I got some chicken from the butcher. He said it’s too small to sell it to the fine gents so he kept it for me. We could make soup from it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fred’s face lit up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That sounds like an excellent idea. Let me just tell one of the men to get the fire goin’ in your room so you won’t freeze to death tonight and you can start on the chicken.”</span>
