  <span class="s1"><em></em>Perhaps later....</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Mione..." Andromeda said in surprise and opened the door for her friend. ,,I thought you`re in france..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Oh, I was in france. I came back a few days ago, and was nearby, so I thought, I just come over, to say "Hi"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Yes of course.. come in... but..." she let Hermione in, closed the door, and hesitated at first, before she said: ,,Please don`t kill her..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,What do you mean...?" Hermione asked, but Andromeda led her into the living room.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Please don`t kill each other..." Andromeda muttered, and Hermione stared in dark brown eyes...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Mione, look... I know it happened far too much, but maybe you can talk with her, or something like that... I mean... it`s years ago..."</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Ms Granger..." Narcissa finally said, in a short break, and Andromeda kept talking, while Hermione`s mind was far away. She thought only about naked skin... wine... and more naked skin...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">~•~Flashback~•~</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione was sitting in her office in the Ministry of Magic, and it was one of those days, where her mind drifted away.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was one of those days, when she doesn`t wanted to be there.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She was reading some documentes, when her door opened, and her co-worker Charlotte Belaqua stepped in.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Godric, she hated it, when that woman couldn`t knock on her damn door, before entering, she thought and looked up at Charlotte.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,What is it this time?!" Hermione asked, and behind Charlotte she spotted the sign on the always closed door of their second Co-Worker: Narcissa Black.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She was glad, that she never had seen the woman since the two years, she had been here now.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Perhaps it was a mutual thing, that the two of them never saw each other. Perhaps Narcissa Black was as intend as Hermione, to not to see her...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione had caught herself once in a while, staring at Narcissa`s door, thinking to just knock.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But then she had asked herself: why? why should I knock? What could we talk about...</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">so she let it how it was...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Charlotte on the other hand, was like the female form of Ron: she always came to Hermione, when she needed something. And it was nearly always something to write...</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was annoying...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Well, there`s this article, and..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione wasn`t really listen to her anymore, when the door on the opposite of her office opened. And for the first time in two years, they saw each other.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Of course, Hermione`s mind was immediately filled with everything that had happened in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the past, but her heart almost beated through her chest, and she smiled a bit.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She saw the suprise in Narcissa`s gaze, but the older woman returned the smile, and vanished...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Do it by yourself. I can not always do it for you..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,But... it is five feet long..." Charlotte said, and Hermione said: ,,I don`t care right know, because I have work to do..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Without another word Charlotte left her office, and Hermione sighed, and went back to her work.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In a strange way, it was good to see Narcissa...</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She didn`t know why, but it was that shared smile, that had said very much, even though she didn`t know what...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She couldn`t stop thinking about that smile for days, although she was sure, that she did interpretate too much in it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A loud scream ripped her out of her thoughts, she stood up, and ran into Charlotte`s office, to see what had happpened.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And she wasn`t alone with this thought, because only shortly after her, Narcissa stood next to her, and spoke out, what Hermione had thought: ,,That`s a joke, right?! You were screaming like... I don`t know what..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Like Voldemort had rise up again?" Hermione suggested, and Narcissa nodded: ,,Yes... because of a... spider?! Are you fucking kidding?!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione almost bit back a laughter if it wouldn`t have been funny. Well, it was funny, to hear a woman like her, cursing like that, but it was just a damn stupid spider, and Charlotte was screaming.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Like I said... female form of Ron..." Hermione thought, and she looked at Narcissa who smirked a bit, and Hermione really liked that smirk...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She pulled out her wand, and picked up the spider with a non-verbal "wingardium leviosa" and Narcissa closed the door, as soon as the spider was outside the room.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Narcissa also pulled out her wand, and hexed the spider in the middle of the door, and Hermione let appear a cobweb around the spider.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If Charlotte would open the door now, she would almost kiss the spider...</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,And you are sure, that you are a Gryffindor?" Narcissa asked in amusement. Hermione nodded: ,,Yes... but at people like her... I forget that sometimes..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Narcissa smirked, and Hermione felt it... she felt that both were about to say something, but neither of them knew exactly what they could say.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So they only gave the other woman a polite nodd, and went back into their offices...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The scream came two hours later, followed by a shutting door, and Hermione couldn`t stop herself from laughing.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She gathered her stuff, left her office, and Narcissa stood infront of her, wand in her hand, and she let the spider disappear.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,What would you say, to a nice dinner?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Perhaps another day... it was a long day, and Ron is probably waiting..." Hermione said, but Narcissa looked at her, and said: ,,Ms Granger, we are working here for two years now. Almost next to each other, and like you said... it was a long day. Come on... besides, this is an rare offer. I would never offer Charlotte something like that."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Nobody would offer Charlotte anything..." Hermione said, and Narcissa offered her hand.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione sighed, nodded and took the hand...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Ms Black..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Narcissa..." the older witch said, while they were waiting for their meals.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Alright, Narcissa... like you said before, we are working almost next to each other since two years, and it is alomst a shame, that we never spoke to each other before, and I think I know why..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,I think we both know that..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione nodded, and continued: ,,I would like to start new. We are Co-Workers... we should be able to speak to each other, from time to time... we can not change the past... well... not without changing everything..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Narcissa laughed, and said: ,,I think you are right, and perhaps we were both a bit stubborn."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She raised her glass and said: ,,It`s a pleassure to meet you, Hermione..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione laughed, and also raised her glass: ,,The pleassure is mine, Narcissa..."</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It wouldn`t help to stay in the past. To judge her for anything... the past is over, and only the future was important. The future and the present time....</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,You are late today..." Ron said, when she came home. She told him, that her day was a bit longer than expected, and that she forgot to send him an owl.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He doesn`t needed to know, that she had had a wonderful dinner. Neither that she will now look at Narcissa with different eyes...</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In this night she overthought everything from the last hours, and she closed her eyes. Smiling...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Three days later Narcissa invited her to lunch, and a week later she invited Narcissa to lunch, and so on...</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They met once at a week for lunch, greeted each other every day at work, and Charlotte never found out that it were the two of them, who played her the joke with that spider...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,When will we talk about the spider?" Narcissa asked Hermione on a saturday after they had lunch together and were now sitting in a park.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,You knew that it was a fake?!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Oh Darling, of course I knew... I recognize a fake spider if it is right infront of me... and I guess it was a revenge?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Might be..." Hermione said grinning, and looked at Narcissa. ,,Don`t give me that look. I`m sure you`ve done similair things, when you were younger..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Me?! No... absolutely not. And I never hexed the ceiling of my sister`s room so that it was snowing for three weeks."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Three weeks?! What have she done?!" Hermione asked, and Narcissa thought for a moment, and then she said: ,,She didn`t told me, that the brightes witch of her age is my co-worker, and that she is a really nice person...and I`m sure, she knew that you are working there..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione laughed and nodded: ,,I told her that, yes..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Narcissa smirked, and said: ,,Well, I told her, that she could`ve mentioned it... besides... it was funny..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,But thanks for the compliment..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,What, that you are nice?! That`s not just a compliment, Hermione. It`s the truth..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione blushed a bit, and gave it back: ,,I always thought that you are an arrogant, cold bitch, but over the last weeks I really regret those thoughts."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Narcissa placed a hand on Hermione`s Knee, and squeezed it a bit.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,And I always thought that you are just the brightest witch of your age, and never pulled your face out of a thick book... I think we both had had wrong thoughts about the other..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione nodded, and finally asked: ,,Never?! Are you kidding??" And Narcissa laughed out loud, and then Hermione realized something: ,,Oh my gosh... tell me, it wasn`t you, who glueded my book on my hands last year."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,I couldn`t resist. You stood right infront of me in the elevator, reading a book. There could have had been a dementor right infront of you, and you wouldn`t have noticed..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Narcissa Black... I really hate you right now."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,That`s right, Darling. Come to the dark side, and change your house from red to green."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Perhaps later..."</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Darling..." Hermione thought about how Narcissa had called her, and smirked in the darkness of her bedroom. She couldn`t sleep, because her thoughts were at the older witch, and she asked herself, why she couldn`t just forget her. Or at least, why she couldn`t stop thinking about Narcissa`s slim fingers... her hands... her eyes... her lips...</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Why am I thinking about her lips...?" She thought, and a soft moan escaped her throat, and before she could react, she realized, that Ron was touching her...</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She let it happen... she felt his errection at her entrance, and she let her mind drifted away...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">How wrong or pathetic was it, to think of something else, while your boyfriend was fucking you?! She thought and let him fucking her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Perhaps I should invite Narcissa to breakfast... but how? And when?? No... lunch`s good..." she thought, while he was almost hammering in her cunt...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Where are you with your thoughts today?" Narcissa asked three days later, and Hermione decided, to asked her: ,,Did you ever faked an orgasm?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Always..." Narcissa said like it was the most normal thing in the world. ,,Well... not always. But always with Lucius. The only times I didn`t had to fake my orgasms, was when I did it by myself."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione looked with an open mouth at her, and Narcissa gave her a confused look: ,,Shocked?!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,A bit... I didn`t expect that answer..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,We are adults Hermione. I think we can talk about such things..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She had a point with that. And after Narcissa asked, whether she wanted to talk about the reason of her question, she said: ,,Well... I don`t give Ron my whole attention when he..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,When he is hammering in you like there`s no tomorrow, and you were thinking of your work, or a nice dress you saw?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,I`m an open book for you, am I?" Hermione asked, Narcissa smirked, and said: ,,I had asked Dromeda the same questions after I had started to see her again, and after I had my divorce..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,May I ask you another question?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Darling you can ask me everything..." Narcissa said, and for a while now, Hermione saw something in Narcissa`s eyes she doesn`t quite understood. And everytime she called her "Darling" she felt a shiver down her spine, and she liked it...</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,You don`t have to answer, if it is too personal... but... did you ever loved him?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Narcissa fell in silence for a while, and Hermione was afraid, that she had crossed a line. She was about to apologize, when Narcissa stood up, paid their shared lunch, and offered Hermione her hand.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione took the hand and they left the restaurant...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,I accepted him..." Narcissa finally said, while they were walking through a nearby park. ,,I accepted him as a man I had to marry. And as a father for Draco. There was a time, when I thought, he loved me, or even our son, but he wanted to have a nurse for Draco. You know what that mean?" Hermione nodded, and Narcissa countinued: ,,I told him, that I does not wanted to let another woman feed my baby. That was our first fight. The second came at the choice for a school. Lucius wanted to send Draco to Durmstrang, but I told him, Hogwarts was closer to our home. It was to 80% the truth... almost 95%... he hated me for that, I know that, but I didn`t care. So... to answer your Question: No. Not really... what about you?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,What`s with me...?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,What`s with you and the same Question. Do you love him?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,I..." before she could continue, Narcissa stopped, and took both of Hermione`s hands. ,,Before you answer... think about the four last months... I can see it in your eyes, Hermione..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Already four? They were meeting after work, and even at the weekends for four months now?!</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Wow..." Hermione thought, and closed her eyes. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,I`m confused..." she confessed whispering and felt her hands squeezed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,I know... I only ask you to think... and you have all the time you need..." Narcissa whispered, and Hermione felt soft lips on her cheek.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,I... I can`t..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,I know, Darling... perhaps later..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione nodded, and whispered back: ,,Perhaps later..."</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Four months... she had had meaningless sex, and fake orgasms with Ron... she had had acceptable orgasms at her own fingers, and she had fun with Narcissa.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They were never eating at the same restaurant, they were talking about everything,... and they were laughing so much...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,I swear to Merlin himself, touch me, and I will break your cock!" Hermione almost yelled at Ron one night, and he stared at her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,What`s your problem? You were moaning, and I thought, I could..." he began, and realized, that she had done it by herself.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,You are touching yourself?! While I`m sleeping right next to you...?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Oh don`t give me that look, Ronald! You are masturbating underneath the shower, and you think, I don`t hear your pathetic tries to come at your own..." and then she saw his urge to slap her. She saw it in his eyes, so she hexed him with a sleeping charm, and left the flat...</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She needed space.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She had to go...</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She send three Owl`s to Andromeda and Narcissa, that she had to go to france for a few days, and to Kingsley, that she needed a break for a few days...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was her fourth day in france, and she was in her hotel room, when someone knocked at her door.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She hadn`t ordered anything, so she was a bit curious, but opened the door, when it knocked again.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,You know... if you wanted to hide yourself from me, you couldn`t have done it better..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,I wasn`t hiding from you..." Hermione said, and let her in, and closed the door. ,,I just needed-"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Space and a break, I got that... but are you fucking kidding me?! After all our conversations, after all our time we had spent together, you just ran away."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,I did not ran away, Narcissa..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Yes you did! You could have come to me, instead going to fucking france! You could have come to me, Hermione! You could have come to me... you could have talk to me, instead of running away!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,I needed a break, Narcissa. This has nothing to do with you..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Oh, this has to do something with me, and you know that! You are just too stubborn... or too blind, or-"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Or what?! Should I have come to you, to say, that I think I fell in love with you?! Do you think, it is that easy?!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,I never said, that anything of this is easy, Hermione..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Than shut up! You have no idea, how it is for me to think of you, while he is touching me! You have no fucking idea, how hard it is for me to try to forget you for just one shitty second, because I don`t want to forget you! You have-"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Narcissa placed her hands on Hermione`s cheeks, pushed her against the wall and kissed her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Without hesitating Hermione kissed her back, and Narcissa deepened the kiss immediately...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Narcissa..." Hermione moaned while Narcissa was kissing her neck and touching her breasts.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,If you... dare... to think about... telling me right now... that we propably should wait... then..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,No... No, no, no...." Hermione breathed out, and she had forgottem if she really wanted to say something anyway, so she just let her fingers slipping in Narcissa`s hairs, pulled a bit and earned a moan from the witch.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She leaned in and kissed her neck...</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,There are... too many clothes on your body..." Hermione whispered, and she knew, that she sounded a bit needy, but she wanted her so bad. She hadn't realized it before, but...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Stop thinking, Darling..." Narcissa whispered, and freed them both from their clothes with a bit of magic, and stroke over Hermione`s wetness.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Tell me, my Love... how often did you thought about me?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Once... or twice... or..." a loud moan out of her own throat interrupted her, when two long fingers entered her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,I also thought about you... I was thinking how you would might taste..." Narcissa purred in Hermione`s ear, and it was almost too much for her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">While she moved her hip on Narcissa`s fingers, she touched her breasts, bit down in a hard nipple, and let her other hand traveling down Narcissa`s belly and shoved three fingers in the other witch.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Narcissa moaned loud and bit down in Hermione`s shoulder....</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">~•~ End of Flashback ~•~</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So... so much naked skin. Moanings... Screamings... and fingers in her front... in her back... scratchings on her back... nails in her thighs... nails in her shoulders... nails in her buttcheeks...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Hermione?!" Andromeda said, and ripped her out of her thoughts.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,What....?" Hermione asked and she saw the pure amusement in Narcissa`s eyes. She cleared her throat and said: ,,Ms Black..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
