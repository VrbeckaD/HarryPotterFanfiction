    <p>Pacing back in forth in the small space, Harry dragged his hand through his hair. The closet was probably 6x6 feet, and that was if he was being generous. Shelves filled the walls and on them ranged everything from potions to cleaning supplies to what looked to be extra medical supplies. He had entered the tiny closet to try to put space between him and the world. </p><p>"This can't be happening," he muttered to himself. He ran his hands through his pockets searching for his wand for the second time in the last minute. He had left it in the Eighth years' dorm and he hadn't bothered to go and get it once he realized he'd left it in his rush for food. </p><p>When he first went into the closet he hadn't realized how small the space was. It was even smaller than the cupboard under the stairs at the Dursley's. While it felt safer than the Dursley's it was no doubt less comfortable. Harry's chest felt tighter by the second. The closet smelled faintly of mildew and he was starting to feel dizzy. </p><p>Harry had already tried banging on the door multiple times along with shouting at the top of his lungs for help. But like everything else in the castle it was probably warded from noise. </p><p>All he had wanted was five minutes alone. After the war had ended he never seemed to have moment to himself. People were always questioning him on how he did it or were asking for autographs or something else. The only people who seemed to leave him alone were Hermione and Ron. They had been engulfed in each other since the war had ended. Unintentionally that had left them ignoring Harry, not that he minded. </p><p>The door swung open and slammed shut just as quickly. Harry was about to shout for help when another body collided into him. The sudden weight knocked him to the ground and his glasses fell crooked across his face. </p><p>"Why did you shut the door!" Harry fixed his glasses and looked up to see the one and only Draco Malfoy. Draco Malfoy, the once proud git now stood near the door and looked shocked to see him. </p><p>"Bloody hell Potter, why are you in here?"</p><p>"Trying to escape people like you Malfoy. That door locks so until somebody opens it we are stuck. Unless you have your wand." Hope filled Harry's voice at the end. Even if it meant depending on Draco Malfoy Harry would do anything to escape the tiny space that only seemed to be getting smaller by the second. Everything was so close. His hope quickly diminished at the dark look that crossed Malfoy's face. </p><p>"They shoved me in here," Draco muttered quietly, "they took my wand. Where is yours?"</p><p>Harry angrily swept his hand through his hair again.</p><p> "I forgot it. And I have to get out of this closet. It's to small and it's just tiny and I need to get out!" Hysteria was starting to fill his voice. The walls seemed to be slowing inching closer and closer to him. His heart was racing and he was starting to shake. </p><p>"Don't be such a baby Potter, a closet never killed anybody. Somebody will let us out eventually." Draco sat down across from Harry, his back leaning against the door. He crossed his legs and looked quite content to be stuck in the closet. "Just relax."</p><p>Harry ignored his warning to relax and felt his magic spike inside out him. </p><p>"Don't tell me what to do or how to feel. I'm claustrophobic okay!"</p><p>"Oh poor heroic Golden Boy. Can't stand to sit in a closet. He might just miss out on being worshiped for a minute. How will he survive?" Draco mocked him. "You are so pathetic Potter. You do know that you don't have to create false problems just to get attention right?"</p><p>Harry moved his hand down to his pocket to grab his wand so he could hex the git but his hand came up empty for the third time. He growled in frustration and glared at the other boy. </p><p>"Don't pretend that you know me. You know nothing about me."</p><p>Draco let out a soft, mocking laugh. </p><p>"Unlike your horde of followers, I don't want to know anything about you."</p><p>Harry didn't bother wasting his breath by responding. He stared down at his hands so he had something to focus on. Slowly his breathing was starting to speed up and with his heart beat. He could practically hear it. </p><p>Draco glanced around the closet. It was pretty cramped with both of them in it but he would live. Potter on the other hand didn't look to good. He looked like he was about to faint or throw up. Or both. </p><p>"Breathe Potter. You're working yourself into a panic attack. I don't want you to pass out or your golden trio will accuse me of doing something to you."</p><p>Harry let out a ragged, shaky breath that sounded a lot like a gasp. His chest was so tight and everything was so small. </p><p>Draco inched closer to get a better look at Potter. Maybe he wasn't faking, he really did look sick. </p><p>"Close your eyes and pretend you're somewhere else. Imagine you're on the quidditch pitch and the space around you is wide open. Pretend you are looking for the snitch. Try to imagine the fresh air." Draco advised before admitting quietly, "that works for me at least when I need to escape my life."</p><p>"I can't shut my eyes! If I do then I'm back in that horrible cupboard. I can't go back there," Harry mumbled before looking up and into Draco's eyes. They were the color of mercury and for some reason that eased some of the tension building up in his chest. </p><p>Harry breathed in and out, attempting to calm himself down. His magic surged within him, begging to be released. Harry knew if he let the magic out it would get them out of the closet, but it also might destroy them both. He didn't have enough control over it. </p><p>"Please distract me," Harry muttered. </p><p>"Um. How's the Weaselette?"</p><p>"Seriously? Don't act like you don't know we separated after the war. Every body knows that."</p><p>"Believe it or not Potter, I have a life. And it doesn't involve knowing every aspect of your life. Some of us have much better things to do than listen for every detail of our Savior's life. Don't be so conceited Potter. No wonder this closet seems so small, your ego is huge."</p><p>Anger surged up inside Harry. How dare he imply that he was conceited. He had given up every bit of his childhood to save the wizarding world. For a second Harry forgot where he was and all he could think about was how much he hated Draco Malfoy. </p><p>"I am not conceited, nor do I have a huge ego. This whole year all I've heard was rumors about Ginny and I, so excuse me if I assumed you had too."</p><p>Draco sat there and didn't reply. He had had enough of sitting in this tiny space with Potter. Draco stood up and turned to face the door. Even without his wand he could feel his magic. </p><p>"Alohomora!" </p><p>Nothing happened. The door didn't even creek. </p><p>"Why haven't you tried this Potter? I've seen you do wandless magic."</p><p>"I can't," Harry muttered quietly. "I have to be calm or else I have a tendency to blow things up."</p><p>Draco just stood there looking down at the wizarding world's Golden boy. How could he defeat Voldemort fearlessly but he couldn't sit in a closet without hyperventilating. </p><p>"I used to be scared of the dark when I was a child," Draco didn't know why he was telling him this, it just felt right. "Father would lock me in this small room whenever I did something wrong. It never had much light and at the time I couldn't do magic. Sometimes I would be stuck in there for hours until Mother would find me and let me out. Nothing bad ever happened to me but being stuck in the dark all alone left me terrified of the dark."</p><p>Harry paused from focusing on his breathing. Why was Draco telling him this. </p><p>"How'd you get over your fear," Harry asked quietly. </p><p>"I grew up and learned that there were far more scarier things than the dark. Because it should never have been the dark I was terrified of. It should've been the monsters hiding in the dark. </p><p>For some reason listening to Draco's voice seemed to calm Harry. Maybe it was the darkness but for some reason he felt safer with Draco there, even if he didn't like the git. </p><p>"I grew up with my aunt and uncle. They weren't kind people. I know you believe I grew up spoiled and worshiped, but it really was the opposite of that. I lived in this tiny cupboard under the stairs. Eventually they moved me into my cousins spare room. They put bars on the window, I was practically a prisoner there. I was never part of their family. Ever since then I've always hated small spaces. They make me feel trapped."</p><p>Draco wasn't sure how to respond to such a revelation. In his mind he had always pictured Potter being pampered at home. Loved.</p><p>"I'm sorry Potter."</p><p>"Who shoved you in here anyway," Harry questioned. </p><p>Draco paused a second before answering. </p><p>"Slytherins. Blaise and some Six years grabbed me and silenced me and threw me in here."</p><p>"But that was your house. And Blaise was your friend."</p><p>"Lesson one, when it comes to them, there is no such thing as friends. No such thing as loyalty." Draco's voice was bitter. </p><p>"I can't even imagine what that woul-" Harry's voice was immediately cut off at the door opened, light pooling into the tiny space. </p><p>"There you are Harry! We've looked for you everywhere!" Hermione looked ready to chastise him for not being in his classes when she saw Malfoy. "What are you doing here Malfoy? What have you done to him?"</p><p>The look of vulnerability quickly vanished from Draco's face and he replaced the look with a classic Malfoy smirk. </p><p>"Don't worry mudblood. I didn't touch your Golden Boy. Bye Potter." Draco shoved past Hermione who's mouth was hanging slightly open. </p><p>Harry stood up and didn't know what to say. For those last few minutes he had forgotten he was in the tiny closet at all. Draco had made him forget his fear.</p>
