<p>Being Cool</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Right,” said Harry, rousing himself. “We should get up. We’ve things to do.” </p>
<p>Draco yawned and stretched. “Like?” </p>
<p>“Prepare for work.” Harry sighed. “I should pop home, check on things there, too, since I haven’t been there in a week.” </p>
<p>“Don’t you have a house-elf?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Harry coughed. “You remember how Hermione feels about them, don’t you? She doesn’t think it cool to use slave labour, so I tend to not call on him for anything.” </p>
<p>Draco rolled his eyes. “He lives there, right?” At Harry’s nod, he said, “Then just summon him and ask how things are. Easy peasy!”</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Harry shook his head. “I doubt he’d answer. He doesn’t like me much. He considers me an upstart, half-blood intruder.” </p>
<p>“He’s said that to your face?” </p>
<p>“Pretty much.” </p>
<p>Draco raised an eyebrow. “And you let him get away with it without punishing him?” </p>
<p>Harry shrugged. “I can’t punish Kreacher! That would definitely not be cool.” </p>
<p>Draco stared at him. “Your elf’s Kreacher?” He shuddered. “All right, I take it back. I wouldn’t summon him either. If you like, I can have Tippy check on your house.”  </p>
<p>“That could hurt Kreacher’s feelings.” </p>
<p>Draco snorted. “You need to make up your mind.”</p>
