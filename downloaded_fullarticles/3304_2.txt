    <p>Brendon frowned, “I know mum, jeez.” His mother frowned at him, “I mean it, Brendon Boyd. You be good.” Brendon ducked his head slightly, “I will be, mum.” “I love you.” The words were a soft coo, muffled into the thick hair on her son’s head. “I love you too, ma.” “Be careful! Matt, Mason, you two be good to your brother!” Grace had a scolding voice full of so much love that it made Brendon’s heart hurt, not wanting to leave his mother so suddenly- even if all of his siblings were going with him. </p><p>“Oh come on, we’re not gonna do anything to him, mum.” Matt said, though he wasn’t very convincing. “Go on, now. You’re gonna be late.” Grace said, shooing her children. Brendon watched as Matt and Mason went first. Kara and Kyla looked at him, waiting for their younger brother, smiling at him. Brendon had full expectations to slam into the wall as he ran towards it, his trolly filled to the brim with bags, the cage for his feline companion on top while she was settled in the bit just before the handles, her long and wispy tail behind her while she watched lazily. </p><p>However, he didn’t. He instead almost ran into the back of Matt, barely keeping himself from doing so as he made a sharp turn. Nigiri let out an annoyed meow at the partial adventure, her white paws shifting to beneath her body in preparation to jump if needed. “Awe, I’m sorry, Giri.” He put a hand down to pet her head before moving out of the way so that no one else would run into him. What pulled his attention was not when his sisters came in behind him, but instead when a boy about five inches shorter than him almost ran into him.</p><p>“Feckin’ shite, sorry.” The boy picked up a fedora and put it back on his head before glancing at Brendon for just a second, instantly turning back to looking at the shorthaired feline around his legs. “Sammy, c’mon.” the boy scolded softly, leaning down to pick up the cat before kissing its forehead gently. “You’re alright.” Brendon said. A meow from his trolly made him turn back, followed by the loud whistle of a train. He was nearly bouncing with anticipation, grinning towards the scarlet train as the whistle flooded his thoughts. </p><p>What felt like forever yet seconds later, he was on the train, grinning and looking out of the train. He saw his mom waving towards her children, his father beside her. He waved enthusiastically back at them, grinning widely. When all was settled, Brendon sighed, smiling a bit wider as the train lurched away from the station. He moved to get more comfortable in his seat, putting a hand on the feline beside him. She was calm, purring gently and resting her head on Brendon’s leg when he touched her. </p><p>He smiled down at her before looking up at the other across from him. He had his legs crossed while the shorthaired feline was sitting beside him, chittering and chirping. Brendon watched as the boy pet his companions head, “I know, Sammy.” Brendon raised a brow. The other boy looked up, not really seeming surprised at the face. “Not a fan of the noise that comes with trains.” Brendon opened his mouth slightly, nodding, “Ah. Nigiri doesn’t mind so much, she’s pretty relaxed.” He scratched the cat’s chin, cooing down at her. </p><p>The other didn’t say anything in response, speaking softly to his companion instead. Nigiri rose to her paws, stretching out and jumping up to rest on Brendon’s shoulder, sniffing the boy’s face. “It’s so weird when you do that, pretty girl.” After the boy spoke, she licked his face gently, raspy tongue going over soft skin. “Nigiri.” Brendon whined gently with a laugh. “Cat equivalent of 'love ye’.” The boy across him was the one that said it, making Brendon look over at him. “Oh.”</p><p>Nigiri finally put herself down beside Brendon, her small paws resting on his thigh while she waited for attention from Brendon. Brendon had had the feline long enough to know what she was doing. “Yeah, you can.” Brendon said with a roll of his brown eyes. Nigiri meowed in response before kneading the boy’s skin, finally managing to make the boy be comfortable before laying down on him. He rested a gentle hand on her back and sighed, leaning back his head as he watched the other across from him. “What’s your name?” The other picked his head up from where he had been focused on his pet. “Patrick.” </p><p>“Brendon.” Brendon supplied helpfully towards Patrick. The boy nodded slightly, though turned back to looking at his cat. Brendon watched Patrick, watched how he fiddled with the feline’s ears and occasionally would pet his body. He also, however, watched as Nigiri raised from her spot on Brendon and jumped down and over towards the other cat. “Sam.” Patrick warned softly. “He won’t mind, will he?” Brendon asked. Patrick shook his head no, ever so slightly. Nigiri hopped up to be on the padded bench, sniffing Sam with a distinct peculiarness as their noses met. </p><p>Nigiri was the one to rub her cheek against the other’s nose first, doing the movement a few times before they both simply.. Settled down and began grooming each other. Brendon smiled, though he noticed Patrick’s eyebrows were high. “Surprisin’.” Patrick mumbled. “Hm?” Brendon questioned. “Sam’s not very.. Friendly.” Patrick explained gently. “Ah. Nigiri can find a way to be friends with every cat I’ve ever met.” “Sammy is a very good judge of character. I guess if he likes her, he must approve of you.” Patrick looked up at the other with a barely-there hint of a smile. </p><p>“I am pretty great.” Brendon bragged, grinning. Patrick rolled his eyes, the smile didn’t raise much. At that moment, a woman came by, sliding the door open. “Anything off the trolley, dears?” Her voice was soft and kind, reminding Brendon of his grandmother. Before Patrick could speak, he answered for the both of them. “A little of everything? Extra licorice wands, too, please.” He pulled 13 sickles- his siblings had told him of the ordeal multiple times -from his pocket with a smile, offering them towards the woman. The witch smiled, “Of course, darling.” After being given the sweets, Brendon smiled. “Thank you, ma’am.” The witch gave him a second smile before continuing on.</p><p>“Want anything, Trick?” Brendon put a hand over the sweets that were on the bench beside him, offering them out. Patrick looked at him before looking at the pile. Brendon watched as he licked his lips, opening his mouth like he was about to say yes before shaking his head. “Are you sure? I don’t mind sharing. I won’t say I doubt I could eat them all, but I would feel a bit bad if I did.” Brendon mused. </p><p>Before Patrick could actually answer this time, another person came along. Brendon noticed it as Kara. “Hey, B, can I have a liquorice wand? I know you bought one. Matt and Mason kind of..” Brendon smiled at his sister, “Of course, Kara. Have at it.” Kara smiled at him and swiped one from the bench before moving over to pet Nigiri quickly, “Thanks, B. Bye, Nigiri. Good girl.” The door of the little room closed, and Brendon moved to take one of the remaining licorice wands from the bench.</p><p>Needless to say, Patrick eventually did shift to sitting on the other bench, on the other side of the sweets, and plucked from the remaining liquorice wand from the cushions. They rather quickly killed off the pile, Patrick groaning softly when it was done. Brendon moved his hoodie from the space between them and noticed two chocolate frogs beneath it. “Want one?” Brendon offered Patrick, grinning. Patrick shook his head before it dropped to the back of the seat. “I have a ton of these, but I never could find Grunnion. Or Agrippa. I don’t think I have a Potter one either.” He opened up the top of one with a grin, grabbing up the frog after it had made it’s one good jump- right onto Patrick’s leg. </p><p>Brendon laughed gently, “Sorry about that, dude.” Patrick shrugged, shifting a bit farther from Brendon as the taller bit into the frog. He looked down and groaned, “Another Circe. I have too many of these.” Patrick shifted on the bench. He put the other one on Patrick’s lap, regardless of if the boy said no or not. “If you don’t want the frog, I can eat it. But you can open it, so you can see what you get.” Patrick sighed after a quick brow raise, but opened it anyways. Brendon caught the frog in midair, offering it to Patrick- who refused -before eating it. “Who’d you get?” </p><p>“Merlin.” Patrick said with a slight shrug. Nigiri jumped from across the benches to land on Brendon’s lap, making her way up onto the taller wizard’s shoulders, relaxing across them. “Pretty girl.” Brendon cooed up at her, petting her head gently. The rest of the train ride was simple, and he managed to fall asleep, Nigiri curled in his lap and his head against the train window. </p><p>He was awakened by a simple poke to his shoulder. “I'm up.” Brendon said, stretching and groaning. Nigiri moved on his body. When he opened his eyes, he noticed it had been Patrick that woke him up. Patrick held out a hand for the taller, silent as a mute as Brendon took it rather hesitantly and got up, thanking the shorter. He had just gotten up when Matt stuck his head in, telling the pair that they were unloading. Brendon jumped to his feet, petting Nigiri and apologizing softly as he picked her up. </p><p>She meowed her annoyance but allowed her owner to hold her close, curling up in his arms with her front paws on his shoulder. Brendon left the cart first, hearing Patrick follow behind him. “Firs' years, this way. Come on, now.” The booming voice that greeted him was surprising and peculiar. “Follow me. This way to the boats.” Brendon was giddy, following the large beast of a man. “Boats?” Patrick's voice was soft near Brendon. </p><p>“Yeah, the boats. All first years have to ride the boat to Hogwarts.” Brendon glanced over to see a boy just shorter than him with brown bangs pushed to the side, a large pair of glasses on his nose. He looked a bit cute, though very dorky. “I wasn't told of boats.” Patrick sounded nervous. “Don't worry about it. It's fun. No one falls in the lake. Usually.” The boy snickered. Brendon held back a growl, though put a hand comfortingly on Patrick's shoulder. </p><p>Patrick didn't calm much in the boat. Sam was on the short boy's lap, sniffing at the boat. Nigiri was settled in Brendon's lap, sleeping soundlessly. The boy with the glasses sat next to him, grinning. “Mikey.” Glasses boy stated, looking at Brendon. “Brendon.” Mikey turned and looked at the other behind them. “Patrick.” Brendon answered for him. At the sound of his name, the boy picked his head up from where it was focused on Sam, “Huh?” Mikey laughed, “Nothing, Patrick. Hope you don't fall in.” Mikey shifted just slightly so the boat rocked gently. Brendon didn't stop himself from grabbing Mikey's arm and just shy of twisting his wrist. </p><p>When Mikey was released, he laughed. “You've got spunk. I like you.” Brendon raised a brow and blew a piece of hair from in front of his eyes. The rest of the boat ride was rather peaceful, though Patrick was obviously glad when they were on dry land and headed into Hogwarts itself. They were sort surprised as a woman greeted them all to Hogwarts as they followed along the other first years to the Great Hall. Patrick followed close behind Brendon, who had Mikey on his right. As they came in, Brendon noticed the amount of people. He recognized his siblings, settled at Gryffindor's table. </p><p>He was only listening to know what was not allowed, and who was forbidden to go where. The sorting hat suddenly became the topic of discussion. “Brendon Urie.” Brendon nearly died at the sound of his name, his anxiety welling up in his chest. He walked up and sat in the chair, listening to the hat. He heard it talk about how difficult the choice was. It boosted his ego, hearing how brave he seemed to be, and how smart. “Where do you wish to be, then, young wizard? Perhaps in Gryffindor, with your siblings?” The hat questioned Brendon. He looked out towards the Gryffindor table, saw his brothers and sisters. They were grinning, anticipating. “No. Slytherin!” The hat said before Brendon had time to think of an answer. Brendon, thoroughly surprised, walked to the Slytherin table. He took a spot at the end, across from a black-haired boy. “You just caused a hatstall. Interesting.” the boy commented, though turned hazel eyes on the other first years without another sound. </p><p>“Michael Way.” Professor McGonagall said, and Brendon watched as the shorter boy went up the steps. He was made to sit down, and the sorting hat was barely even on his head before suddenly rearing up with “Slytherin!” There was applause, and the boy grinned, getting up and heading off to where he was meant to sit, settling next to Brendon, greeting him and the black-haired boy across from them. This continued for a while, though it took longer for most others- Patrick was a Hufflepuff, a girl named Sarah was a Ravenclaw, and a boy named Zack was a Gryffindor.  </p><p>When it was called for the banquet to begin, Brendon grinned. He was introduced to Mikey's older brother, Gerard, and Frank, the boy across from Brendon. After they were finished with the meal and Professor McGonagall had finished her words, they were sent out with their prefects. Brendon bumped Patrick's shoulder, grinning at the Hufflepuff. “Hufflepuff, follow me, please.” A short girl said the words, her voice calm and soft. “This way, Slytherin.” A boy commanded, to which Brendon broke from his Hufflepuff friend and followed Mikey. “Mark.” Mikey whined softly behind the prefect. </p><p>“What is it, Way?” Mark asked without looking over his shoulder. “Hey.” Mikey mused. “Hello, Mikey. This is the Slytherin commons. Easiest way to the dormitories, I solemnly swear.” Mark said, his voice louder for the others to hear him. “How'd you know his name?” Brendon questioned. “Gerard. Duh.” Mikey said in response. “Pureblood.” Mark said to a blank wall, and Brendon thought he was crazy before the wall shifted and they all made the way in. “Girls, dorms are that way. On your left. Boys, this way, on your right.” Mark informed before walking off. </p><p>The girls split from the boys, with the latter of the genders following Mark while the former followed who Mikey informed was Skye Everly. “Mark’s girlfriend.” Mikey said lazily. “Of four years.” Mark informed smugly. </p><p>Mikey ended up being put with Brendon. As Brendon sat on his bed, petting Nigiri, Mikey settled on the floor with his large snowy owl, Berry, on his arm. “Pretty girl.” Mikey cooed to his feathered friend. Nigiri leaped from Brendon’s lap and went over to the pair. Berry looked at the feline, letting out a simple hoot as Nigiri sniffed her beak.</p><p>Brendon was not surprised as Nigiri pressed up against the bird, loud enough that he could hear her purring from his spot. “So I guess they're going to make good enough friends.” Brendon mused. He relaxed, listening to the lapping of the lake as he settled fully on his bed, sighing softly. He was asleep without even meaning to be.</p>
