    <p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">  A thin line of lightning flashed across the gray sky. Followed by a soft rumble of thunder just five seconds later. The heavy wind caused droplets of rain kept landing harshly against the flat's window.</p><p dir="ltr">  London had never been gloomier for her.</p><p dir="ltr">  Tina was sitting on her bed. Her knees hugged and her head tilted against the headboard. Doing nothing but watching the rain for the past three hours. The strong scent of petrichor from the slightly opened window filled her nostrils. She sniffed. Hoping the rain would comfort her, as it always does whenever she feels blue. But this time, it only brought her more pain.</p><p dir="ltr">  "Love, you could catch a cold if you let this opened." A tall, ginger-haired man walked in hurried steps to close the window. Tina didn't move an inch. Her swollen eyes remained empty at the window although her husband was blocking her view. Newt heaved a sigh. Of course he was worried. He'd been trying to make her get out of their room. By cooking her favorite dinner, making her tea, but none of them worked. He realized how bad last night's incident had struck her.</p><p dir="ltr">  Newt took the folded blanket on the bed and spread it out. Carefully wrapping it around his wife's shoulders. "Tina." he called softly while sitting next to her.</p><p dir="ltr">  Tina never felt such weight just for turning her head, but she managed to do it eventually. His gaze was so warm and comforting that Tina could no longer contain her emotions. There is no way she would hide anything from her husband. Her lips trembled as she took a shaky breath, "I was too late, Newt. I could've saved her-"</p><p dir="ltr">  Her voice broke at the word <em>saved</em>. She clenched her jaws, unable to finish her sentence. It was only a moment before she could feel Newt's arms around her. "Don't be so hard on yourself, Tina." He hushed, gently stroking her back to comfort her as she cried on his shoulder. "If there's anyone to blame, then it should be the murderer. You've done everything you can."</p><p dir="ltr">  Tina desperately held onto him. Her hands gripped the back of his shirt tightly. "T-they didn't even let us see her corpse.. " she whimpered between sobs.</p><p dir="ltr">  Newt took a deep breath, then let it out slowly. Trying to blink his tears away. Not only because they both lost their dearest friend, it was his first time to see Tina being so vulnerable. The sight shattered Newt's heart. He couldn't imagine how terrible the incident was that it broke someone as strong as his wife down.</p><p dir="ltr">  The man pressed his lips on her temple. A long, loving kiss in a hope it would make her feel better. Even if it's just a little. "It hurts me to see you crying, Love. Please tell me what i can do for you."</p><p dir="ltr">  No respond was heard from his wife, but he couldn't blame her. He knew she needs time to be able to talk properly. Eventually, Tina was calming down, as he could hear her breath became steadier. Tina quietly asked if he could just hold her like this for a little longer, in which Newt gladly complied. Accompanied with the gentle, muffled sound of rain, the couple did nothing but sharing warmth in each other's embrace.</p><p dir="ltr">  Tina wiped her eyes. She didn't cry just because she was mourning for Leta. She's a detective. Death is not something she's unfamiliar with. She has seen countless of them, with bodies that were probably in worse conditions. Tina knew even her life was risked considering the situation they're currently having, and Leta nor the rest of her team were any different. But Tina felt part of it was her fault. She was overwhelmed with guilt. Realizing how things could've been different if she was <em>there. </em></p><p dir="ltr">  The scene from last night hasn't stop haunting her mind.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p dir="ltr">oOo<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"><em>  </em> <b> <em>October 8th, 2016</em> </b><br/><b> <em>  6.45 pm</em> </b></p><p dir="ltr">  <em>Water splashed at Tina's ankles as she ran through puddles. The umbrella she was holding could no longer protect her from the heavy rain for she was running at such speed. But neither did she care. </em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>  </em>'Where are you?'</p><p dir="ltr">  'Convenient store, Ordnance Road. Why?'</p><p dir="ltr">  <em>Her heart raced madly. Cold sweat running down her temple even though she was burning her energy. Deep down Tina hoped what her teammate told her wasn't true, which was impossible. The words she'd heard were crystal clear;</em></p><p dir="ltr">   'Come to Warwick Road. We've found her-- well, they've found her <em>body</em>.'</p><p dir="ltr">   <em>Vague sound of ambulance's serene grew louder and louder when Tina reached the end of the road. She instantly stopped her steps. Five foot away from her there were people crowding. Yellow police line could be seen between them. The spinning red and blue light on top of the ambulance were blinding in the middle of the rain. Tina felt her heart just dropped. </em></p><p dir="ltr">  No. Not this again.</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>  Her umbrella fell from her hand. Tina ran and desperately pushed herself through the crowd to get a clearer sight on the crime scene. Behind the police line, two forensics had zipped up a long, white bag and brought it into the ambulance. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>  Tina gritted her teeth. Her eyes started to fill with tears. She wanted to run through the line. Forcing the forensics to stop and open the bag so she can prove her teammate wrong. But her intention was held when she felt a hand placed on her shoulder. Tina turned her head, finding Luke Zhang shifting his umbrella towards her so they can share the shade. Eyes shone empty as he stared at the crime scene. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>  "We got here when they finished collecting their evidence." He said quietly. "I'm sorry, Tina."</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>  Tina felt her throat dry when she tried to speak. "I-is it confirmed?"</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>  Luke slowly nodded. "The body has been identified as Leta's. Picquery confirmed it herself. They said she already took care of it."</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>  "Why didn't she tell us first?" </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>  "Because she said it's better for her to identify the body alone, so none of us would cause--"</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>  "Tina!!" Before Luke could finish his sentence, a younger girl ran up to them. Another member of their unit, Rahayu was catching her breath. "Inspector Scamander," She gulped hard. Trying not to sound so terrified, "He's here. P-Picquery told me to hold him off but--" </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>  Just then, they heard people in the crowd murmuring complaints. A big, tall man harshly pushed himself through. His nose flared and eyes awfully red. He was terrifying enough that no one dares to confront him, and instead step aside to make the way. Tina immediately grabbed his shoulders, stopping him from walking through the police line. "Theseus--" </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>  The man didn't accept her action. "Let me through." he tried to tug her off, but Tina was persistent. Theseus shot her a glare. "I need to see her."</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>  "They already put her into the bag--" </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>  "I don’t care!! Tell them to open it!" </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>  "We can't, Theseus, please--" </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>  "I'm her fiancee for fuck's sake, Tina, Let me through!!!" His cry was desperate. He tried to tug her off again, and Tina had no choice but to hug him tight. Doing anything in her power to hold him from stepping forward. But to her surprise, Theseus didn't fight this time. Instead he stood still. "I just... I just want to see her." he spoke quietly. His voice breaking.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>  Tina could feel her shoulder getting warmer, and she knew for sure it wasn't because of the rain. "I'm sorry." she whispered. She couldn't say anything else. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>  Theseus surrendered and slumped against her. His wail made the atmosphere more dreadful than it already was. Tina sobbed silently. She kept him in her embrace even though they were heavily drenched. It only took a few moments until Luke and Rahayu came to share their umbrellas. They stood behind Tina and Theseus, gently patting their backs while making sure the rain won't wet them anymore. Neither of them dared to say a word. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>  On the other hand, whispers and murmurs can be heard from the crowd, wondering how the victim's death had put these four people in such grief. </em>
