    <p>It was a cold February at Hogwarts. The castle grounds were covered in snow and the lake had frozen over. The four Marauders were sitting comfortably on their beds in their warm dormitories. James, Sirius and Peter were each holding a mandrake leaf.</p>
<p>“Alright boys, this is our last chance before the holidays”, James said to Sirius and Peter. “Whatever happens, we must never remove the leaf!”</p>
<p>“And I just want to say, for the last time, this was not my fault” Sirius proclaimed.</p>
<p>“You were the one who pranked the Slytherins!” James argued.</p>
<p>“Yeah this is your fault!” Peter exclaimed pointing a finger at him. “If you hadn’t planted the Swelling Solution, I wouldn’t have laughed and spat it out and James wouldn’t have choked on it!”</p>
<p>“Come on, you have to admit it was hilarious! Who knew Snivellus’ nose could get any bigger!” Sirius laughed.</p>
<p>“It was pretty funny. Especially when we had to explain that James was choking on bubotuber pus!” Remus said, snickering.</p>
<p>Sirius snorted. “Did you see Evans’ face? I think that’s the first time in weeks that she’s payed any attention to you! And good thinking on the bubotuber pus, Remus”.</p>
<p>“Anyway…” James interjected, glaring at Sirius. “This time we can’t let anything distract us. Even if it means”, he took a deep breath, “Withholding pranks” He finished, looking devastated.</p>
<p>“Fine!” Sirius groaned. “We’re doing this for you Remus” He snapped, not looking to happy at the idea of temporarily putting a stop to pranks.</p>
<p>                                                          ****                         <br/>Meanwhile, you were lying on your bed in the girls’ dormitory, chatting to Lily and Marlene about the upcoming Valentine’s Day Hogsmeade trip.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard that Dina Connelly is going with Bertram Aubrey, you know the guy from Ravenclaw.” Lily told you and Marlene.</p>
<p>“Really? Well good luck to her” You mused. “Whenever he talks to me he looks a little too far south, if you know what I mean”.</p>
<p>“Ugh tell me about it! I click my fingers in front of him and he still doesn’t get the hint.” Lily responded, exasperatedly. “Maybe next time I should just poke him in the eye, maybe that’ll get the point across”.</p>
<p>“Well at least she actually has a date” Marlene huffed. “It’s been 2 weeks since the notice went up and no one has asked me yet!”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry; I haven’t got a date either.” You reassured her. “We can just hang out together”</p>
<p>“Yeah about that” Marlene began, sitting up on her bed and looking at you suspiciously. “You had 3 guys ask you out this week. I get why you turned down Roger and Jason, but why Derek? Girls would kill to go on a date with him”.</p>
<p>“Well…” You started, choosing your words carefully. “I just didn’t really want to go with him because he, uh, was not really, uh, my type” You finished lamely.</p>
<p>“You mean he’s not Sirius?” Lily smirked, leaning up on her elbow and waggling her eyebrows at you.</p>
<p>“No! Of course not!“ You said indignantly. Marlene and Lily both stared at you, eyebrows raised.</p>
<p>“Well…maybe” You began, hesitantly. “It’s just, me and Sirius have gotten a lot closer the past couple of months. Ever since we had that detention together we really hit it off. I kind of thought he felt the same”.</p>
<p>You had both served a detention together in August. He had “accidentally” set off a few dung bombs in the corridor and since only you and Sirius were at the scene of the crime, Filch had given both of you detentions. You were annoyed at first as preparing and sorting through potion ingredients, such as rat’s brains, was not exactly pleasant. But as Sirius began chatting with you, you were surprised to find how easy he was to talk to and how very different he was when not surrounded by other students. <br/>You began seeing more of Sirius after that night. At first it started with a smile and wave when passing you in the corridors, then he’d began to stop you for a quick chat, and soon enough you were both sitting closely in front of the warm fire in the Gryffindor common room chatting and laughing comfortably until the early mornings.</p>
<p>“Maybe he’s just too shy to ask you?” Lily suggested. You raised an eyebrow sceptically. “No really!” She continued earnestly. “He’s never really had a girlfriend before. I don’t think he’s even been on a date now that I think of it. This is probably all new to him”.</p>
<p>“Yeah Y/N! You should ask him”, Marlene said, excitedly.</p>
<p>“What! Are you kidding me?” You exclaimed incredulously. “Me ask Sirius Black on a date to Homemade? I don’t think so”.</p>
<p>“Oh come on Y/N. Girls can ask guys out on dates too you know” Lily insisted. She was now sitting up on her knees and almost bouncing up and down in excitement.</p>
<p>“I dunno…” You began, unsure. “What if he says no?”</p>
<p>“Y/N, I’ve seen the way he looks at you. He is completely smitten by you. There is no way in hell he is saying no to you.” Lily assured you, smiling knowingly. “Trust me”.</p>
<p>You sighed, thinking it over. You could just ask him out, you thought. He did always seem eager to talk to you whenever you were near, and he’d always touch you; whether it was a hand on your arm or to brush your hair behind your ear. He also seemed different when he was with you; almost like he was showing his real self, without his usual arrogant demeanour.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll do it”.</p>
<p>                                                     ****      <br/>You knocked on the 5th year boys’ dormitory door, your heart racing and palms sweaty. You thought over Lily and Marlene’s advice. ‘Just breathe’ they said.</p>
<p>‘Don’t talk too fast like you usually do when nervous.’</p>
<p>‘Be confident, but don’t look too cocky.’</p>
<p>And ‘Make sure he understands that this is a date. You don’t want a repeat of what happened to me’.</p>
<p>You heard laughter and shuffling in the dormitory. Remus opened the door. “Hey Y/N, what’s up?” He asked, smiling.</p>
<p>“Hi Remus, I was just wondering if I could talk to Sirius?” You asked, trying to sound confident.</p>
<p>“Umm…” Remus suddenly looked uncomfortable and anxiously looked over his shoulder. “I’m not sure if now is a good time Y/N”.</p>
<p>“Oh, ok” You said, feeling your heart sink. “Sure, maybe another time then”. You tried to smile and turned to leave.</p>
<p>“Wait!” Remus started suddenly, still looking over his shoulder. You stared at him confused. He appeared to be mouthing something and making small gestures with his hand. He turned to you again, “Actually, why don’t you come in?” He asked, smiling nervously.</p>
<p>“Ok…” You responded, confused. You stepped into the room and looked around. To say the room was ‘messy’ was an understatement. The floor was littered with crumbled parchments, empty sweet wrappers, books and clothes. All the beds were unmade, and one of them actually had all the sheets completely on the floor. The walls were covered in posters of quidditch teams and many photos of the boys laughing together.</p>
<p>James and Peter were sitting on their beds, smiling at you with their mouths firmly closed. Sirius was standing awkwardly in the middle of the room, with a tight-lipped smile and his hands in his pockets.</p>
<p>“Hey Sirius, umm, is this a bad time?” You asked unsure.</p>
<p>He shook his head, still smiling at you, bouncing on the balls of his feet.</p>
<p>“Well I wanted to ask you something” You began, your confidence suddenly disappearing. “Tomorrow is the Hogsmeade trip and it also happens to be Valentine’s Day. So I was wondering if, uh, maybe you might, uh, want to go…with…me?” You finished awkwardly, picking on a loose thread on your sleeve.</p>
<p>Sirius’ eyes suddenly grew wide and he looked at the calendar on the wall. James and Peter were also wide eyed and staring at Sirius, looking almost fearful.</p>
<p>Sirius looked back at you worriedly. He made a deep gurgling noise and looked over your shoulder at Remus. You turned around to see Remus smirking and looking as if he was trying to hold back laughter.</p>
<p>You turned back to Sirius and asked “Do you…not want to go with me?” You stammered. You felt your face burning up and your heart sink.</p>
<p>He quickly shook his head, his lips still tightly shut.</p>
<p>“You do want to go with me to Hosgmeade?” He quickly nodded, smiling as wide as possible without opening his mouth.</p>
<p>“Ok, great!” You said, relieved. You were happy he said yes, but confused by his odd behaviour. “What time did you want to meet tomorrow?” You asked smiling at him and feeling your confidence come back.</p>
<p>He made a high pitched noise in the back of his throat whilst shrugging his shoulders awkwardly. James and Peter both started snorting with laughter and you heard a chuckling behind you.</p>
<p>Sirius waved his hand at you whilst shrugging again, his face becoming slightly pink.</p>
<p>“You don’t mind what time?” He nodded, seeming relieved you understood. “How about we meet in the common room at 11? That gives us time to get ready after breakfast.” He nodded once again smiling happily and his eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll see you tomorrow” You said happily.</p>
<p>“Mhm!” he responded nodding his head enthusiastically. James and Peter were still smirking and were glancing at each other mischievously.</p>
<p>You turned around and headed towards the door which Remus opened for you. “Bye Y/N” He said smiling brightly.</p>
<p>“Bye Remus” You replied.</p>
<p>You looked over your shoulder once again at Sirius who still stood smiling at you. “Bye Sirius” You called. He waved at you and made another high pitched noise which earned another snort of laughter.</p>
<p>You walked out the door and down the boys’ staircase. You were still confused by his odd behaviour, but figured it was just another joke the boys came up with. After spending 4 years with them, nothing really surprised you. Besides, you thought as you happily jumped off the last step to the boys’ dormitories, you finally had a date with Sirius Black. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>                                                      ****<br/>Back in the boy’s dormitories Sirius was dancing around and thrusting his fist in the air triumphantly whilst making even more high-pitched squeals of happiness. James and Peter were giggling madly while Remus was roaring with laughter.</p>
<p>“Well Sirius” Remus began once he’d collected himself. “You’ve finally got a date with Y/N”. Sirius threw his fist in the air once again. “Although…you do realize that you won’t be able to speak right?” He added, smirking.</p>
<p>Sirius’ fist pumping began to falter as it finally sunk in. He turned to look at James wide-eyed whilst James fell off the bed from fits of laughter.</p>
