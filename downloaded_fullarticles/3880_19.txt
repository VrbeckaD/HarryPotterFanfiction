    <p>Spencer Reid had a conundrum on his hands. He had never seen someone as enthralled with books as he was. Yet the woman seated across the table might be his match. This was not the conundrum. The conundrum was that the library was supposed to close in the next ten minutes or so, and his table-mate had fallen asleep fifteen minutes ago. Her light brown curls fell across her cheek and draped across the open pages of the tome she had last been reading. She had one hand in her lap and one pinned under her cheek where she had been holding the pages open. </p><p>Spencer was pretty sure it would be the polite thing to do to wake her up. However, whenever he tried to talk to someone new, if he actually wanted to be friendly, it came out stilted and awkward. He and the brunette had fallen into a quiet camaraderie. They had both been sitting and reading at the table for the last 5 hours. Every once in a while, one would get up to replenish their stack of reading material. The other would make eye contact and smile absently when they returned, not long distracted from the book in front of them. She had been quiet and she had excellent library manners. Her phone had never rung jarringly. She wasn't snacking and getting food detritus on the pages or popping gum. She was just quietly, peacefully reading. </p><p>Spencer's ruminations had left him with only five minutes to decide what to do. Fortunately, at this moment, a buzzing started from the woman's side of the table. She blearily opened her eyes and fished a mobile out of her pocket. She sighed and sat up straighter in her chair. Warm brown eyes met his across the table. </p><p>"I'm here most Friday evenings if you'd like to do this again," she whispered across the table to him. Her voice was slightly husky from her quick nap or perhaps from the quiet of the past few hours. </p><p>Spencer smiled and nodded at her. She didn't seem to require more of a reply as she was already gathering her books and leaving the table. </p><p>Spencer could sense they were on the cusp of something, like a sprouted plant just ready to break through the soil to soak up some sun. </p><p>At that moment, the exit door beside their table burst open.</p>
