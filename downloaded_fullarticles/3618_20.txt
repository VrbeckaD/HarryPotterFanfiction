          <div class="userstuff"><p>Master Severus Snape,</p>
<p>I provide to you with the utmost care the recipe for my new healing potion. You are the first in receiving this. Should you like to utilize this in your enterprise, please sign the attached contract and send back in the post. I will only be releasing this to the top 5 Potioneers in the world, and as you are one of them, it only makes sense that you would be one. </p>
<p>In this, you will have your name released to the public as one of the sources of this potion. I have already worked out with Hogwarts a contract that would utilize solely you and I for the potion – so as to protect students, but additionally, we are the only Potioneers with the capability to brew this near the school. So it would simply be efficient. However, you can distribute the potion as you would see fit. </p>
<p>I ask that you allow for about 3 months of brew time to build up your stores and the stores of the other potions masters, so that when it is released to market you are not bombarded or overwhelmed. This isn’t pretense. I want you to understand, my marketer and I have already assumed a 300% increase to sales for this potion simply because my name would be attached to it. This will die down eventually, but I would never want to do your other business harm by having you overwhelmed. </p>
<p>Finally, after thorough research my team and I have decided that (your contract with Hogwarts not-withstanding), that should you wish to sell this on the open market, the cost per 1 ounce vial should be in range of 5-7 galleons. This is to assure that there is no mark up because of my name, but also so that there is fair pricing for the product. </p>
<p>Please let me know if you are open to this. I would be honored if you were to brew this potion. And worry not, I wait eagerly for your break down of the potion and any remarks you may have regarding it. I respect your knowledge in this field and would love any feedback that you have.</p>
<p>As always, </p>
<p>Mstr Harry Potter (DADA, Pot., HL)</p></div>
