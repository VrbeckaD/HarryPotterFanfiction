    <p>Chase the Morning</p><p>By Ammie Hawk</p><p> </p><p>Disclaimer: Now class repeat after me: I do not own Gundam Wing or Harry Potter. They are not mine, and I am not making any money off this project.</p><p> </p><p>Prologue</p><p> </p><p>Fifteen year old Harry Potter stared blankly out the window of the shuttle that would take him away from the only life he’d ever known. The events leading up to his departure from the normal, which had been hazy up to this point, were now coming back to him in flashes as they broke atmosphere.</p><p>He had gone to the Ministry of Magic to rescue his godfather, Sirius Black, but that had been a trap set up by Voldemort. Then the Death Eaters had shown up and started chasing him and his friends. When all had seemed hopeless, the Order of the Phoenix arrived and took over the battle with the Death Eaters. He had stood there and watched as Sirius battled his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange, and her spell hitting him and sending him back through that strange veil. He had chased that bitch down, hoping to avenge his godfather. Then… <em>he</em> had shown up: Lord Voldemort. The two of them had fought for a little while, but it was obvious who would’ve won that time. His life was spared, this time, by the timely arrival of many Ministry officials.</p><p>After that point, he wasn’t sure what had happened, as a pair of strong arms had encircled him and he felt like he’d been sucked through a tiny straw. When the sensation stopped, he found himself in a small apartment located somewhere in the heart of London. He turned to his rescuer/captor and found himself staring into the drawn face of his former Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, Remus Lupin.</p><p>There was no time for words between them as a loud CRACK rent the air behind them. As one, the pair of them turned, wands drawn, to confront the new arrivals. Remus, however, quickly lowered his as he recognized the slightly disheveled form of Lucius Malfoy, who was supporting a barely conscious Hermione Granger.</p><p>“What happened?” Remus gasped, going over to help assist with placing the girl on the ratty old couch.</p><p>“To her,” the blond shook his head, “I’m not sure. However, Voldemort has gained control of the Ministry. It was sickening how easily those fools gave up and let him take over.”</p><p>“I daresay I’m not surprised,” the werewolf rubbed his forehead tiredly.</p><p>“We need to get them out of here,” the silver gaze shot sidelong in Harry’s direction, who was still standing, apparently frozen, with his wand still pointed at the blond.</p><p>“If what you say is true,” the werewolf sighed, “then Severus should be here soon and we’ll figure out what to do.”</p><p>“I suppose that would be best,” Lucius lowered himself heavily into the armchair that matched the couch, even in it’s state of disrepair, looking very much out of place in the humble surroundings.</p><p>“Re…Remus?” Harry finally found his voice. “What’s going on? What’s he doing here?”</p><p>“Harry,” the former professor gave him a weary smile, “don’t worry about it for now. I promise you, no harm will come to you within this house.”</p><p>“But, but he’s…” the raven haired teen shook his head, trying desperately to clear it.</p><p>“He’s on our side, Harry,” Remus reassured him with a hand on his shoulder as he motioned to the prone form of Hermione on the couch, as if that explained everything. “Please try and relax until Severus arrives.”</p><p>With a sigh, Harry sat down at the rickety old table, but couldn’t bring himself to relax, not by a long stretch. His mind seemed to be caught in a maelstrom and couldn’t focus on one thing for more than a fleeting second. His arms felt leaden and shook every single time he tried to move them. His legs weren’t much better, thus why he had actually agreed to sit.</p><p>It was almost half an hour later before anything big happened within the apartment. Remus had managed to bring Hermione out of her half conscious state and into a natural sleep, and he was hopeful of her complete recovery. He had just sat down to a hot cup of tea, courtesy of Lucius, when another CRACK sounded and two more individuals appeared.</p><p>“Severus!” Remus said at the same time Lucius cried, “Draco!”</p><p>The two blonds met in the middle of the room, in a hug that startled Harry from his current staring match with the far wall. His detached gaze studied them for a moment before emerald orbs drifted over to the final person in the room. Severus Snape, the most feared professor to walk the halls of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, was watching the scene with a calm that didn’t seem to fit with the present circumstances.</p><p>“What’s going on, Severus?” the werewolf went over and began checking the dour man over for injuries.</p><p>“Voldemort has claimed control of Wizarding Britain,” the Potions Master sighed, swatting Remus’ hands away and taking a seat in the vacant armchair. “Hogwarts is now closed, as Dumbledore fled the castle as soon as word reached him of the Ministry’s collapse. All the students have been sent home to their parents. Potter and Granger,” his eyes darted between the two Gryffindors, “were reported missing or killed, no one is sure of their state. The rest of the Order of the Phoenix has also gone to ground, and are awaiting further orders from Dumbledore, if he ever dares to show himself again.”</p><p>“What do we do now?” Lucius asked, still holding his son to him protectively.</p><p>“We need to act quickly and get him,” he nodded in Harry’s direction, “out of the country. Everyone from Voldemort to Dumbledore is searching for him.”</p><p>“Why are they looking for me?” the Boy-Who-Lived asked in confusion, he still didn’t know why he would be singled out.</p><p>“He truly doesn’t know, does he?” the blond man scowled.</p><p>“Know what?” Harry demanded with a glare.</p><p>“Harry,” Remus sighed, going over and once again placing a reassuring hand on the teen’s shoulder, “there was a reason you were lured to the Ministry tonight.”</p><p>“He said it was for a prophecy about me and Voldemort,” the raven haired wizard frowned in Lucius’ direction.</p><p>“It was,” Severus spoke up again. “The whole prophecy is unknown but by a single individual, however, I do know part of it. <em>The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches…. Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies… and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not… and either much die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives….</em>”</p><p>“But how does that mean me?” the teen shook his head, there was nothing in those words that said Harry Potter was the one who would defeat Voldemort. “It could mean anyone born at the end of the seventh month… July.”</p><p>“It could,” the Potions Master ran his hand through his hair. “And as much as I would enjoy debating prophecies made by batty old Seers with you Potter, we have more pressing issues at present. Namely, what to do with you three children.”</p><p>“Where should we send them?” Lucius pulled his son closer to his chest as if afraid that letting him go would make him disappear. “America?”</p><p>“That would put a sizable distance between them,” the werewolf conceded with a nod. “Or we could send them to Sanq, or even Japan. No one would think to look for them there.”</p><p>“Space,” Snape heaved a sigh. “It is the safest place for them to go.”</p><p>“Are you insane?” the blond hissed, glaring at his old friend, and Draco whimpered slightly in his arms. “Space is a magical dead zone! You would send the children to their deaths!”</p><p>“Have you ever been to space, Lucius?” dark eyes steadily held his gaze. “No? I thought not. I have. And I assure you, space is not a magical dead zone. It is just a common misconception among wizards. That is precisely the reason they will be safest there. No one from out world will look for them there.”</p><p>“If you’re sure, Severus,” Remus took a deep, calming breath, and looked to Lucius for consent. The blond nodded in return. “Then we will trust your judgment.”</p><p>After that it didn’t take long before all three teens, Hermione had woken up after a short potion regimen given to her by Severus, were handed their, now shrunken, school trunks, once again courtesy of Snape; a passport and new identity cards; and enough money to get by for several years within the Muggle world, as well as the assurance of more to come over the next few years.</p><p>And so Harry sat, staring out the window, watching Earth grow smaller as they made their way deeper into the starry abyss known as Outer Space.</p><p>“Harry?” Hermione’s tentative voice quivered from the seat right beside him, drawing his gaze away from the blackness. “We’re going to be alright, aren’t we?”</p><p>The raven haired wizard didn’t know what to tell her. He didn’t know what would happen to them. He just had to trust that Remus and the others knew what they were doing, which wasn’t a very reassuring thought at the moment.</p><p>“We’ll be fine, Granger,” Draco Malfoy leaned across the aisle to look directly at both Gryffindors. “If Uncle Severus says we’ll be fine, we’ll be fine. Besides,” a blond brow quirked inquiringly, “where’s your sense of adventure? Did it finally desert the two of you after your heroics at the Ministry?”</p><p>An ironic smile spread itself across the Boy-Who-Lived’s face, “You know what, Malfoy, you’re right. It’s just another new adventure.” Green eyes turned back to his best friend, the light that had seemed to be missing since his godfather had fallen was returning. “We’ll be just fine, Hermione. We always manage to scrape by, we’ll do it this time, too. I’m sure of it.”</p>
