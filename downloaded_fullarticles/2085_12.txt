  <strong>Prologue:</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>  As you walk forward in a desolate land, you notice someone coming towards you. From a distance you can tell this being is short... barely over three feet. As he steps out of the shadows, you first see his large green tennis ball sized eyes. Then you notice the socks... socks on his hands, his feet and even his ears. In a soft voice he whispers;</p><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>"Don't bother to adjust you telly set."</li>
<li>"Wheezys control the Horizontie..."</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>  Here he makes a sweeping motion to his right and you see George Weasely holding a wheel that as he twists it back and forth makes a line skew across your vision.</p><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>"Wheezys control the verticie..."</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>He points up and Fred Weasely turns a dial that makes a line skew from the top of your vision to the bottom.</p><p> </p><p>Then in a slightly louder voice the little being says, "Welcome to the Potter Zone"</p>
