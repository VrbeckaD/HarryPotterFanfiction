    <p>Pushing Minerva up against the wall Hermione claimed her lips with her own. Minerva gasped and realized what was going on and began to fight back only to give in and accept the kiss. Hermione beamed with happiness and ran her hand over Minerva’s hip and took grasp of her right leg placing it over her own hip grinding into Minerva. </p><p>Minerva broke the kiss panting as she dropped her head back to the castle wall and moaned. Hermione smirked and lent forwards nipping at the crook of Minerva’s neck and huskily said, “that’s it, let those pretty little moans out”</p><p>Minerva could feel herself become wet with the friction of the young woman grinding into her. “Her...mione.... oh gods.... don’t, don’t stop”</p><p>Slightly embarrassed on how fast she was going to reach her orgasm.... she began to blush, feeling the telltale signs of her orgasm, she wanted nothing more than to come and come hard.</p><p>Excepting the fact that one of her students were about to give her one of the best orgasms of her life, she felt her body tense and shake as she climaxed, a long and loud moan left her as her body released. Her eyes squeezed shut and the after waved ran through her body, she tried to calm down. Once her breath finally evened out she opened her eyes to find herself in her office alone. She was not in one of the many halls. She did not just sleep with one of her students. She did not just have the best orgasm of her life with Hermione Granger. </p><p>With a sigh, Minerva closed her eyes trying to ignore the slight pang of sadness that she was alone, and that everything that had happened was nothing but a dream. A figment of her desires, something that she knew she couldn’t have.</p><p>Reopening her eyes, she glanced down at the paperwork that still covered her desk, that still needed to be completed but she had no desire to finish them at the moment. Getting up from behind her desk she gasped at the slight tingling sensation between her legs, taking a deep breath she gathered the paper work and left her office, and made her way to her chambers.</p>
