    <p>"Now, Dad?"</p>
<p>"No, not yet......just a little while more," he said, holding his finger up for him to wait as he scanned the field ahead of him.</p>
<p>"Now?"</p>
<p>"Just be patient a little longer, son." Draco squinted his eyes until he finally saw her peek her head out and he gave his son a side glance. "NOW!"</p>
<p>Scorpius quickly threw his hand out and shot two balls of ice towards the two fireballs his sister Ember shot at him. He watched them both collide and turn into nothing more than a small cloud of steam. He then placed his hand on the ground and made it start to ice over as Ember went to run at him, causing her to lose her balance and slip.</p>
<p>"YES!" Scorpius shouted, giving his dad a high five.</p>
<p>Ember came stomping up to them both, her expression livid. "What the hell, Dad? You're helping him again, how is that fair?"</p>
<p>"Relax, Ember, I'm just showing him-"</p>
<p>"All my giveaways? Yeah, I noticed." She stormed off, whipping her hair around so fast that a fiery flame flew off the end of her strands.</p>
<p>"She's pretty mad Dad."</p>
<p>"Scorpius, she's always mad," he said, watching her slam the back door to the Manor. "Come on, dinner should be just about ready."</p>
<p>Dinner at the Manor was one of Draco's favorite parts of the day. He loved the chaotic scene that always unfolded with the kids around them. A lot of it was amusing the way they all constantly argued with each other, but sometimes he would just sit there and think about how lucky he was.</p>
<p>"Draco, can you please take her for a moment?" Ginny asked, passing the baby to him. "I swear if I have to call her one more time.....HARPER!" she yelled out.</p>
<p>Ginny saw Scorpius walking past the kitchen and she quickly stopped him. "Take this on your way to the dining room," she said, handing him a giant plate full of chicken.</p>
<p>"I thought your parents were coming?" Draco asked, wiping Ava's runny nose with his sleeve.</p>
<p>"They were, but Dad's not having one of his good days, so they are going to stay home tonight," she explained with a sigh, leading the way to the dining room.</p>
<p>Draco placed Ava in her high chair before he took a seat beside her.</p>
<p>"Where is Harper? HARPER! GET YOUR ARSE DOWN HERE FOR DINNER!" Ginny screamed again.</p>
<p>"She's coming, she's was outside flying again," Aurora said, taking a seat across from Ember.</p>
<p>"And Ellie?" Ginny asked as she started serving everyone.</p>
<p>Aurora just shrugged.</p>
<p>Ginny was ready to call their names out again as they both walked into the dining room.</p>
<p>"Harper why are you out on the Quidditch pitch again? You still have one day left of your punishment."</p>
<p>"I thought it was shortened because of good behavior?" she said with an innocent shrug.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I bet," Ginny said through clenched teeth. "Draco, that's too hot for Ava," she nodded towards the food the baby was grabbing for that Draco cooled off with his powers just as she took a bite.</p>
<p>Draco couldn't help the smirk that crossed his face at Harper's sarcasm, she constantly tried to get one over on them and most times she did. He looked around the table at all his kids and then at Ginny....she was an amazing mother to all seven of their children. Draco knew when he married Ginny he wanted a house full of kids and here he had it. Ginny always made it sound like she would have been fine with only four, but he could tell how much she enjoyed being a mother. He found that to be one of the most amazing things about her.</p>
<p>Ember and Scorpius were seventeen and only had a few months left before their eighteenth birthdays. Ember looked exactly like Ginny but had her father's eyes and Scorpius looked exactly like Draco, only his hair a few shades darker and he had his mother's eyes, but they were a few shades lighter. Aurora was sixteen and looked a lot like Draco's mother, Narcissa, but had Ginny's personality. She had this platinum blonde hair that almost looked white just like her father and these piercing blue eyes. Ellie was fifteen and she had ended up with a strawberry blonde mane and amber eyes like Ginny. She kept to herself a lot and was always trying to learn anything she could. Her grades were quite impressive; her Aunt Hermione was very proud. Riley was thirteen, she was another mini Ginny but she didn't seem to have either one of her parent's personalities whatsoever, she was more of a loner. Then there was Harper, she was ten and the tomboy of the clan. Her dirty blonde hair and hazel eyes constantly made it hard for Draco or Ginny to stay angry at her after all the mischief she got into. Lastly, baby Ava...she was two and once again the ginger genes had won, while Draco won the battle of the eyes.</p>
<p>"Riley, stop putting your carrots on Ellie's plate and eat them," Ginny said, her head not even facing her.</p>
<p>Riley rolled her eyes at her mother's ability to tell what all of them were doing without her even seeing it.</p>
<p>"Roll your eyes again and you'll be eating carrots for breakfast, lunch, and dinner," Ginny said, shooting her a threatening glare. "Yes, she will," she said in a silly voice as she tickled Ava's little tummy before she gave her some food.</p>
<p>The doorbell rang out and Aurora quickly jumped up. "I'll get it-"</p>
<p>"SIT....down," Draco said, looking at her with a smirk. "I can tell by your sudden urge to answer the door who must be out there.....allow me to get it," he said, an amused smile covering his face.</p>
<p>"Ugh, Dad, please don't," Aurora pleaded.</p>
<p>"THEY WERE INVITED!" Ginny yelled out to him as he walked out of the dining room.</p>
<p>Draco ripped the front door open and a sneer covered his face. "Evening, Potter, what do you want?" he asked, folding his arms.</p>
<p>"Good evening, Mr. Malfoy, my you're looking rather magnificent this evening, is that a new shirt?" James asked, his sarcasm evident in every word as he walked past him and into the dining room.</p>
<p>Draco pinched the bridge of his nose as Harry and Luna came walking up to the door. "My patience is wearing thin with that son of yours," he said.</p>
<p>"He's a sixteen-year-old boy, Draco, it's not like I can turn off his hormones," Harry laughed, as he held the hand of his six-year-old daughter Bella.</p>
<p>"I'm sure there's a spell for that," he mumbled as they walked back into the dining room.</p>
<p>James went to take a seat beside Aurora when Draco grabbed him by the shirt and dragged him to a seat further down the table before he took his own seat again. Draco felt Aurora's glare on him and he smiled brightly at her before he turned his attention to Ginny and the others.</p>
<p>The doorbell rang again and Draco looked at Aurora. "You sure you don't want to go get that?" he asked her.</p>
<p>She just rolled her eyes before she got up and went to answer it. She came back shortly with Ron, Hermione and their two kids Rose, who was sixteen and Hugo who was thirteen.</p>
<p>"Hey, hey everyone," Ron said cheerfully. "I thought Mum and Dad were coming?"</p>
<p>Ginny just made eye contact with him and shook her head, she didn't like discussing her father's health in front of the kids. Ron just nodded with a small frown before he turned to Harper with a smile.</p>
<p>"Is that punishment over yet? George and I really need some of your input on some new product."</p>
<p>Harper went to open her mouth to answer when Ginny cut her off.</p>
<p>"No, she just added another day to it because she can't listen, besides, we are heading to Diagon Alley tomorrow to get her school supplies," she said, giving Harper a stern stare.</p>
<p>"Oh bummer, well what about you Scorpius? Now that you and Ember are out of school you have any jobs lined up?" Ron asked.</p>
<p>"Why do I need a job? We're rich," he said, his face genuinely confused.</p>
<p>"No son, I'm rich, you're broke, so I suggest you go with us tomorrow to Diagon Alley and start looking," Draco said; giving him the same stern look Ginny gave Harper.</p>
<p>"What about at the Ministry? Dad? Harry? Aunt Hermione...you all work there, can't you guys get me a job there?"</p>
<p>"Uh-"</p>
<p>Draco cut Harry off. "No, I don't want you working at the Ministry so you can forget that idea."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Scorpius, what I think your dad means is.... the Ministry isn't the right place to start off in. Over the years, there's been a lot of foul play and unethical things going on." Harry chimed in.</p>
<p>"And I don't want you getting swept up into any of it, so look elsewhere," Draco said, his tone dismissive.</p>
<p>Scorpius nodded.</p>
<p>"I'm guessing this is a bad time to tell you that Mr. Adwell offered me a job in the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes," Ember said.</p>
<p>"WHAT?" Ginny and Draco both said in unison.</p>
<p>"And who the hell is Mr. Adwell?" Draco demanded.</p>
<p>"It's Noah's Uncle," Ember said.</p>
<p>Draco looked at Ginny, "Who the hell is Noah?" he quietly asked her.</p>
<p>"He's a boy from school....a friend," she whispered back.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I bet," he mumbled. He turned back to Ember, "Well, you'll have to tell Mr. Adwell you can't take it."</p>
<p>"But Dad, it's just desk work, that's all, Harry, tell him it's fine." she pleaded.</p>
<p>Harry looked everywhere else but at her and didn't dare get in the middle of it.</p>
<p>"Gee, thanks for that...Aunt Hermione? Please?" Ember continued to plead.</p>
<p>"Draco, if it's ok, I know Mr. Adwell, we've worked together in the past and I'm always in the department lately it seems. Perhaps a desk job would be ok for now?" She suggested, causing Ember's face to light up. "While she's looking for a job elsewhere?" Hermione finished.</p>
<p>Ember's face dropped and she folded her arms in annoyance.</p>
<p>Draco turned to Ginny and she gave him a small smile. "Fine."</p>
<p>"What? How's that fair?" Scorpius asks angrily.</p>
<p>"It's not, now change the subject," Ginny said firmly.</p>
<p>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</p>
<p>Later that night, Draco made his way around to each child's room, something he and Ginny did every night. He popped his head into Harper's room and saw her jump into bed at his arrival.</p>
<p>"Hey kid, what are you up to?" he asked, looking around at the mess of clothes she had scattered about.</p>
<p>"Just trying to decide what to pack for school. Dad, do you think I'll make the Quidditch team?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Well, you practice day and night and you're quite good so I think you have a great shot," he said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Do you think you could help your favorite daughter out and get Mum to take that extra day off of my punishment?" she asked, wiggling her eyebrows at him.</p>
<p>He just laughed at her, "I'll see what I can do." he said as he tucked her in and placed a kiss on her head. "And stay in bed...I better not catch you on that Quidditch pitch again."</p>
<p>He closed her door and walked down the hall and knocked on Ember's door. She ripped it open and rolled her eyes before she walked back over to her bed and plopped down on it.</p>
<p>"Tell me about Noah?" he asked, folding his arms and leaning against her bedpost.</p>
<p>"Seriously, Dad? He's just a friend and yes, he happens to be a boy, is that alright? Am I not allowed to have male friends?" she snapped.</p>
<p>"Of course you can have male friends, but male friends sometimes turn into boyfriends and then-"</p>
<p>"UGH, EWW, Dad, please do not have that conversation with me. Noah and I are not doing anything like that.....not yet anyway," she mumbled the last part.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"So you and Noah are more than friends?" he asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head. "Dad, Mum already talked to me about this, she told me all about how she was very young when she had us and blah, blah, blah so save your breath."</p>
<p>He just looked at her. "What's really going on? You seem quite angry, with me specifically."</p>
<p>She didn't say anything.</p>
<p>"Ember?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I don't mean to be so...-"</p>
<p>"Bitchy?" he finished for her.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Dad," she said with a smirk. "You're always helping Scorpius out there when we practice using our powers and every time I end up on my arse. It's not fair, why aren't my powers as strong as his?"</p>
<p>"Your powers are strong; you just aren't focusing enough to use them properly. You are constantly rushing your strategy and forcing them rather than trusting your instincts. You are always repetitive, so tracking your next movement is quite easy, but Ember you know we just let you and your brother practice just to have a handle on them. I don't want you ever using your powers in a careless or malicious way."</p>
<p>"I know Dad," she said. "Why won't you or Mum ever use your powers?"</p>
<p>"We do-"</p>
<p>"No, I mean....like... really use them, you could help Scorpius and I practice."</p>
<p>Draco and Ginny rarely ever used their powers, especially in front of their children. When they found out Scorpius and Ember had the same abilities it scared them at first. They had only started developing their powers a little over a year ago and neither of their powers were as strong as his or Ginny's.....not yet anyway. He and Ginny were forced into a situation at the time to use such abilities to defend themselves when his father was alive. He and Ginny never spoke of what happened with Lucius to their children, they didn't want them to know all the heartache and pain that was their lives before they were born. Some things they shared with them, but a lot of it they left out, even Harry hadn't spoken of those events or his powers to James or Bella at all.</p>
<p>One of Draco and Ginny's biggest fears was word getting out about Ember and Scorpius' powers. It wasn't that uncommon to see witches and wizards with special abilities, but it was well known about his and Ginny's powers already around the Wizarding world. They both had been approached by a person or two in the past asking to study their abilities and that was something they did not want. They didn't want to end up someone's science experiment, especially their kids.</p>
<p>"Ember, there really isn't a need for them, but I'm sure if you talk to your mother, she will happily show you a few things," he said with a smile.</p>
<p>She nodded before he gave her a quick hug and placed a kiss on her head.</p>
<p>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</p>
<p>Ginny was brushing her teeth in the bathroom and then started brushing her hair when there was a knock on her bedroom door. She knew it to be one of the kids and quickly rinsed her mouth out before she walked over and opened it up.</p>
<p>She smiled in amusement. "Draco, what are you doing? Why are you knocking- Are you wearing a suit?"</p>
<p>"I came to pick you up," he said, holding his hand out for her to take.</p>
<p>"Pick me up?"</p>
<p>"For a late-night dance," he said, giving her a light pull into the hall.</p>
<p>"I'm in pajamas and you're all dressed up though," she said, giving some resistance as he dragged her along.</p>
<p>"You look perfect," he said as he led her to the ballroom and opened the door for her.</p>
<p>She walked in and smiled at how gorgeous it was. They didn't use the room a lot but when they did it always amazed her.</p>
<p>"The kids-"</p>
<p>"Are all asleep," he said, pulling her onto the dance floor and waved his wand for some music to start playing.</p>
<p>He pulled her close to him and took her hand in his and placed the other one on the small of her back. Every chance he had to be with Ginny, he always made sure he took advantage of. He was overwhelmed with how his life turned out, how amazing every single one of his children was, how incredibly in love with Ginny he was after all these years. He still looked at her and wanted her the same way he did when he first kissed her.</p>
<p>Ginny just looked at him, he was the most wonderful man in every way possible. He was a fantastic father to each of their children and he was the same way as a husband. She never once felt put on the back burner or felt any less love from him after all this time. They could hardly keep their hands off each other which is how they ended up with seven children. Every time she found out she was pregnant again Draco's reaction was better than the last. He was so happy to be a dad; it melted Ginny's heart to see how excited he always was. Seven kids though, was unexpected, for her anyway, sometimes she wondered if she was doing a good job. Every time she wondered that, it was like Draco could read her mind because he would always say how great of a mother she was to their children.</p>
<p>She wrapped her arms around his neck and pressed her lips to his. She felt him pull her closer to him as he ran one of his hands through her hair. The feeling of his hands on her face always sent a shiver down her spine, making her kisses turn fiercer. He could feel her body turn hot beneath his touch which only made him more turned on. Ginny could feel the spots where he touched her turn cold, she could feel the ice run through her until she couldn't take it anymore and would counter it with an equal amount of heat. It was always a fight of fire and ice when they were intimate and it was always more pleasurable than the last. One time Ginny set their bedroom on fire, but thankfully Draco extinguished it before it did any major damage.</p>
<p>She pulled away suddenly and looked at the ceiling. "You're making it snow," she laughed against his lips.</p>
<p>"Help a guy out, then," he said.</p>
<p>She waved her hand at the ceiling and it suddenly started raining, soaking them both."Oops, didn't think that through."</p>
<p>They both laughed and then their lips were on each others again.</p>
<p>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</p>
<p>"No, Harper put it back, what else is on the list?" Ginny asked, grabbing the paper from her.</p>
<p>"Riley, have you- Where's Riley?" Ginny asked, looking around the bookstore. "Scorpius, please go find Riley...Harper put it back," she said once more as Harper put down a stack of books on Quidditch.</p>
<p>Ember watched her mother for a moment as she somehow kept each one of her siblings in check. She couldn't help but smile at her mum's ability to keep calm and not stress, especially when it came to all of the chaos that came with having seven children. She assumed she got it from their grandmother, Molly.</p>
<p>"Um, Mum?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Ember? Ellie, go grab these books, they are the last two on the list," she said, giving her the paper. "What's up, sweetie?"</p>
<p>"I was wondering....um, do you think you would be willing to show me-"</p>
<p>Ava started to cry suddenly and then Scorpius finally came over with Riley in hand. "She was next door looking at owls," he said.</p>
<p>"Do not go wandering off; go help Ellie find the rest of the books. Scorpius please be a dear and take Ava for an ice cream across the way so I can finish up." She said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Of course, Mum," he said, strolling his baby sister out of the crowded bookstore.</p>
<p>"What were you saying Ember?"</p>
<p>"Um, so I was wondering if you could show me how to better use my.....powers?" she asked, she didn't make eye contact with her mother.</p>
<p>Ginny stopped what she was doing and looked at her. "What?"</p>
<p>Ember looked back up, fidgeting with her hands. "Could you show me-"</p>
<p>"No, I heard that, but why?" she asked. "Your father has been practicing with you and your brother," she stated.</p>
<p>"Yes, but.....Dad isn't like me....you are," she said, locking eyes with Ginny.</p>
<p>Ginny was quiet for a few moments. "I'll think about it, but this isn't the place to discuss that, ok?"</p>
<p>Ember nodded before she saw Noah across the store, who came walking over. "Mum, you remember Noah from school?"</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, hello Noah, how was your summer?"</p>
<p>"Quite well, thank you, this is my father," he said, gesturing to the man behind him.</p>
<p>"Miss Weasley, nice-"</p>
<p>"Malfoy....Mrs. Malfoy actually," Ginny corrected him as she took his hand to shake.</p>
<p>"Of course, my apologies, Mrs. Malfoy, it's a pleasure to finally meet you, I'm Jack Adwell. My son talks a lot about Ember here."</p>
<p>"Does he now?" Ginny said, giving a side glance at Ember. "Ember tells me your brother works at the Ministry and has offered her a job?"</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed I hope that was alright?" he asked.</p>
<p>"It's much appreciated, however, Ember will work at the Ministry until she finds work elsewhere," she stated, her tone dismissive.</p>
<p>"I understand," he said.</p>
<p>Ginny went to walk away when he spoke again.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Malfoy, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, could I have a word with you?" he asked.</p>
<p>She was surprised by the question and then looked at Ember. "Give me a moment, sweetheart." she said as she watched her and Noah take a few steps aside. "What can I help you with Mr. Adwell?"</p>
<p>"I really don't mean to overstep here, however, Noah tells me that Ember is very gifted-"</p>
<p>"We're done here," Ginny cut him off and went to walk away when he spoke again causing her to stop.</p>
<p>"Please, I don't mean to upset you, I just want to help."</p>
<p>"Help? With what exactly?" she asked, her defenses were in full swing, her eyes deadly.</p>
<p>Ginny had never lost control of her powers since Lucius was at large; her mind was always her own whenever she had used any form of her powers in all the years since. The fact that this man knew of Ember's powers was frightening in itself, she didn't trust anyone when it came to her children, anyone outside of her family of course. Having him bring up the subject, in general, had her on edge.</p>
<p>"Again, I don't mean to upset you, it's just Noah and Ember talk and he came to me about an issue she's having with developing them properly. I think I can help her-"</p>
<p>"No, we are done...let's go Ember," she called to her daughter and went to leave when Mr. Adwell reached forward to stop her. "Mrs. Malfoy, if you could just-</p>
<p>Ginny turned around so fast and grabbed his wrist. "I SAID WE'RE DONE HERE!" she yelled.</p>
<p>He quickly grabbed his arm away from her as her grip started to burn him. Her hair started to lightly float and sway like a flame and her eyes turned a shade darker.</p>
<p>"Come near my family again.....and I'll k-"</p>
<p>"Mum?" Ember called, she was a bit taken aback by her mother's actions.</p>
<p>Ginny quickly composed herself before she shot Mr. Adwell another deadly glare. "Stay away from my family," she said before she gathered the rest of the kids and made her way out of the bookstore.</p>
<p>"Mum? Are you ok? What was that?" Ember asked, walking fast to keep up with her mother's quickened pace.</p>
<p>"Aurora, there you are, please take the kids to the ice cream shop with Scorpius over there....I'll be right over," Ginny said before she turned to Ember and pulled her into a side alley.</p>
<p>"YOU TOLD NOAH ABOUT YOUR POWERS?" she suddenly yelled at her. "WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Mum, I wanted to talk to you about them, but you and Dad are always so busy."</p>
<p>Ginny felt guilty at Embers words.</p>
<p>"You can't go around telling people about your abilities Ember, because of people like Jack Adwell. People like him want to study things like that and I won't have it," she said, her body started shaking; her nerves were all over the place suddenly.</p>
<p>"But I thought he might be able to help me, that's the only reason I said anything."</p>
<p>"I will try to help you as much as I can, but promise me that you will NEVER agree to anything Jack Adwell may suggest."</p>
<p>"But-"</p>
<p>"PROMISE ME!" she screamed.</p>
<p>Ember jumped at her mother's anger before she nodded.</p>
<p>Ginny pulled her into a tight hug, her heart was racing....she scared herself for a moment back there in the bookstore.</p>
<p>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</p>
<p>Later that night, Ember made her way to Scorpius' bedroom. She attempted to talk to her mother again earlier when they got home, but Ginny avoided the conversation. Ember had only heard stories about her parents and their powers from other students at school that had heard stories from their parents. Even when it came to her grandfather Lucius, they didn't say much, just that he wasn't a very nice man.</p>
<p>"Hey, can we talk for a minute?" she asked Scorpius as she gave a knock on his already opened door.</p>
<p>"Sure," he said as he finished hanging up some clothes.</p>
<p>"Ugh, you're just as tidy as Dad.... it's sad really, how much you two are alike." she teased him.</p>
<p>He just smirked before he saw her face. "What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Ember, we're twins, I know when something is wrong...now spill," he said, taking a seat on his bed.</p>
<p>"Have you ever spoken to anyone about your powers?"</p>
<p>"You mean like Mum and Dad?"</p>
<p>"No, like another student?"</p>
<p>"No, Dad said we shouldn't make it a habit to let people know. Why?"</p>
<p>"Because I told Noah and-"</p>
<p>"WHAT? Ember, you shouldn't have."</p>
<p>"I know, and today in the bookstore when Mr. Adwell mentioned it to Mum....she was angry."</p>
<p>"Well, I can see why-"</p>
<p>"No, Scorpius, she was different, kind of scary honestly....a bit of her powers slipped."</p>
<p>"What? Mum's powers? That never happens, are you sure?"</p>
<p>"I think the burn mark on Mr. Adwell's wrist is pretty sure." she sighed. "All I want is to be as powerful as you."</p>
<p>"But you are and why does it matter? You know magic and you're really good at spells."</p>
<p>"I don't know, I just want to prove to myself that I can beat your arse finally," she smirked at him.</p>
<p>"Pft, that will never happen, I'll always come out on top," he said smugly.</p>
<p>"We'll see," she laughed, punching him hard in the arm.</p>
<p>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</p>
<p>Ember walked past her parent's bedroom to see if her mum was up and saw her father in there instead. She went to walk away and come later when he called out her.</p>
<p>"Hey, how was your day? I had to work late, so sorry I couldn't be home for dinner." Draco said, giving her a quick hug.</p>
<p>"Um, it was good," she said.</p>
<p>"Did you talk to your mother?"</p>
<p>"About what?"</p>
<p>"About practicing?"</p>
<p>"Oh, uh, yeah, I don't know, I think I'm just going to keep trying and see how it goes," she said, turning to leave.</p>
<p>"Whoa, wait...what's going on?" he asked, stopping her in the hall. "Why the sudden change of mind?"</p>
<p>Ember looked over her father's shoulder and into the bedroom to see if her mum was around. "Today in Diagon Alley.....Mum's powers slipped," she said.</p>
<p>"What do you mean exactly?" Draco asked, his tone serious.</p>
<p>"She was angry at Mr. Adwell for something.....and she was different.....Her eyes were different, I've never seen her like that before."</p>
<p>Draco's stomach dropped at Ember's words.</p>
<p>"Dad?"</p>
<p>He snapped his eyes up to hers again.</p>
<p>"Are you ok?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, listen don't think too much on it. You know your mother has a bad temper and sometimes she can get carried away. I wouldn't be concerned about it ok?" he reassured her with a smile.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>"And I would still ask her to help you out, I think she would enjoy it more than she thinks."</p>
<p>Ember smiled at this and gave a happier nod before she headed to her room.</p>
<p>Draco turned his attention back to his bedroom where Ginny emerged from the shower and slipped on her nightgown. He looked at her and she met his gaze and gave him a quick smile.</p>
<p>"So, how did everything go today? Did the kids get everything they needed?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yep, everything was fine, how was work?"</p>
<p>"It was good....everything.....was good," he said, walking over to her and looking at her face.</p>
<p>Her eyes were their normal honey brown as they have been for the past seventeen years. He remembered the horror that came along with those black eyes, how her mind would turn over to something she couldn't control.</p>
<p>"Is something wrong?" Ginny asked.</p>
<p>"Are you ok?"</p>
<p>"Yes, why?" she asked with some amusement. "You're acting quite odd," she said, walking over to the vanity.</p>
<p>"What happened with Mr. Adwell today?"</p>
<p>She turned to look at him and let out an annoyed sigh. "I'm guessing Ember told you?"</p>
<p>"Well, you sort of, as she described it, lost control?"</p>
<p>"I didn't lose control and by the way, Jack Adwell knows about Ember because she told Noah."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's what prompted the whole thing because he asked me questions about her and wanted to help." she snapped angrily, emphasizing the "help" part. "I'm sorry Draco, but I got very protective, you know I won't let anything happen to these kids."</p>
