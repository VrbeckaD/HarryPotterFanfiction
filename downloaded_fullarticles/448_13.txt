    <p>Prologue: The Yule Ball. </p><p>The Yule Ball wasn't something Draco Malfoy was too interested in. And honestly, he would have stayed in his room if he had known what would happen by night's end. The blonde male in Slytherin house sighed as his bluish gray eyes flitted around the room, scanning all Hogwarts students, as well as other students from various schools, brought here by the Triwizard tournament. </p><p>Draco could care less about any of this. He lifted his glass to his lips and looked up for a split second in time to catch a glimpse of the lady descending the staircase. Her hair wasn't its usual mess of wavy curls, and she wasn't dressed in school robes so it was hard to digest that this young woman was Hermione Granger. The same young woman Draco had teased and bullied since first year.</p><p>He slowly lowered his glass and stared at the young muggle-born. </p><p>"She's beautiful" Pavarti Patil of the Patil sisters gasped, causing Harry Potter to turn his head, his eyes widening at the beautiful sight of his best friend dressed in a petal pink satin and silk dress. Her hair was pulled to the side, revealing most of her neck and collarbone. She was met with Victor Krumb. A Triwizard champion competing for the Triwizard cup. He lead her away from the growing crowd of students.</p><p>Draco watched as Victor placed a kiss upon her hand then left her. He stared a bit longer, witnessing her strike up a conversation with the dreaded Potter and Weasley. </p><p>"Krum's going to get drinks.. Would you care to join us?" Hermione asked her friends Harry and Ron. To which the ginger-haired male responded in a snide manner, "No… we would not care to join you and Victor" he said the last word with such malice it made Hermione uncomfortable as she asked, "What's got your wand in a knot?" "You're fraternizing with the enemy.." "The enemy?!" the young woman hissed in shock now.</p><p>Hermione stared at Ron with disgust now. "Who was it wanting his autograph?! Besides.. The whole point of the tournament is.. International, magical, cooperation." She glared at him now, "to make friends!" "I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind" Ron said never missing a beat. To which Hermione calmly stood up and left the boys to sit on the bench. She only stopped for a moment to face Ron once more, about to say something, but it seemed dumb to do. Harry watched as she left the room.</p><p>Draco smirked at Ron and Hermione as they started heading his way to leave the dance. "He's using you.." Ron stated to which Hermione recoiled with, "how dare you! Besides I can take care of myself!" "Doubt it.." Ron muttered as the pair continued walking, "he's way too old.." "What?! Well if that's what you think- "Yeah, that's what I think!" "You know the solution then, don't you?!" Hermione retorted as they reached the entrance. Draco stepped to the side, watching them.</p><p>"Go on.." </p><p>Hermione stopped in front of Ron, tears in her deep brown eyes. "Next time there's a ball, puck up the courage to ask me before someone else does!!" She sniffled, "and not as a last resort!!" </p><p>Ron stammered now, "Well tha.. That's just… completely off the point…- He cut off looking at Harry as he approached the two. "Harry…?" Hermione turned now and got in Harry's face. </p><p>"Where have you been?!... Never mind off to bed, both of you!" she growled, shocking the raven-haired young man. Harry gave her a look, then glared at Ron for a good moment as he walked with the ginger-haired. "They get scary as they get older…" Ron quipped, causing Hermione to lash out with, "Ron you spoiled… everything!!" </p><p>Draco watched as Ron and Harry headed upstairs, and waited till the few people surrounding Hermione had left before he stepped out and carefully approached her. "I'm sure Weasley didn't mean it.. But if you want my opinion.." Hermione looked up at the blonde and glared, "I don't want your opinion Malfoy, and I don't need anymore attention than I've had, thanks!" she hissed. </p><p>Draco stopped and sighed. "I get it, you hate me.. What I don't get is how you're not having a good time. So what if that stupid git said some hurtful things. I've said a lot to you over the years, and you seemed to bounce back quickly from it." Hermione huffed through her nose "what are you getting at Malfoy?" Draco slowly took a spot beside her on the stairs and cautiously laid his hand over hers. "My point is.. Why are you letting him ruin your time? You got dressed up. You look.. Stunning for lack of a better word. And you were happy until Weasley ruined your bliss. Why are you letting him get to you?" </p><p>She removed her hand from under Draco's and stared into his eyes. "I don't know what you expected from this talk Malfoy, but I'm not interested in anything you have to say.. Goodnight.." She stood up and was about to leave when he grasped her wrist at the hand. "Granger… wait…" Draco stood up now. "I know I've been an arse for a long time. And I know you hate my guts.. But.. Would you care to dance?" </p><p>Hermione stared at him in shock.</p><p>"What do you want Draco?"</p><p>"I already told you… to dance.." </p><p>She glanced at his open palm, then into his bluish gray eyes. "Fine… one dance…" she whispered, placing her hand into his before he lead her out to the dance floor and they began to dance with one another. Draco placed his hands on her hips and Hermione cautiously slid her arms around his neck. </p><p>The pair ignored all eyes on them as they only stared at one another. </p><p>"I meant it when I said you look stunning" Draco stated, keeping his eyes fixed on her.</p><p>Hermione wasn't taking the bait. "What do you want Malfoy? Why did you ask me to dance? You know bloody well that we hate each other. Now speak up or I'm leaving.."</p><p>He gripped her dress slightly and sighed. "Alright, fine. You caught me okay.. I wanted to dance with you because I felt bad that you were crying over that Weasel!.. You shouldn't waste tears on such an imbecile like him, and you look too beautiful to just sit on the stairs crying.." </p><p>She sighed and shoved Draco suddenly. "Nice try.. You're a horrible liar..!" She stepped away and headed off to her dormitory. </p><p>The rest of the room stared at Draco. This would be the talk of the school.. </p><p>"What are you all looking at?! Mind your own business!!" Draco hissed before storming out of the room.</p>
