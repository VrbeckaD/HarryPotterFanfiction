    <p>
  <span>That night at Godric Hollows it was not just Harry that was left an orphan with a scar, but also his twin sister Oliva. Not a lot of people knew about the little Potter girl. So when Hagrid came and collected them it was quite a shock. Because of health reason Lily and James had kept it quiet about their little baby girl, she was so tiny the doctors didn’t believe that she was going to survive at first, but she came through. </span>
  <span>It was also because of how nobody knew of Olivia that Albus Dumbledore chose to give her to the next door neighbours of the Dursleys, to Doris and Thomas Green. </span>
  <span>He believed that as long as nobody knew of her, nobody would come and do her any harm, he also trusted that Petunia, Lily's sister would do the right thing and look out for the little girl next door as well.</span>
  <span>Thomas and Doris green lived in the most rundown house at Privet Drive that most people considered an eye sore. The inside was about as shabby as the outside, old wallpaper curling down the walls in heaps, creaky floorboards with nails sticking out, the kitchen always overthrone with dirty moldy dishes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Olivia grew up at 3 Privet Drive in Little Whining, being best friend with Harry Potter. Joking around at how they were twining over having the same lightning bolt scars, his on his forehead whilst hers was placed on the top of her right hand. She didn’t have many friends, because of her poor clothes, unruly and unbrushed hair as well as how dirty she often was nobody wanted to be friends with her. Harry didn't mind though and Dudley didn’t scare Olivia so they were pretty much the perfect match. Just like Harry, Olivia’s childhood wasn’t that great. Everybody who lived at Privet Drive knew that Doris and Thomas were unfit to be parents. When she was 8 Thomas left and she hasn’t seen him since, sometimes she misses him. Wonders why he didn’t take her with him, sometimes especially around christmas she would often, more so when she was younger, dream away and think that he was coming to save her. She did not blame him for leaving, if she could she would as well. </span>
  <span>Her dad leaving hit hard. He drank alot and would scream foul things to her but he would never hit her, that was all on Edna. Her dad would defend her whenever he wasn’t falling over drunk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thomas was a well built man, he was tall and strong. You could easily tell that he worked with manual labor, which he did, he was a mechanic. He had dark brown hair that was most of the time unruly like Olivias. In her opinion she looked most like her dad, with dark unruly hair of her own. Although her dad had dark, almost black eyes whilst she had a pair of dark green eyes. She wasn’t sure where she got those from for her mom had also dark eyes. Her mom was a woman of average height, although she was very thin almost sickly so, her hair was brown with blonde highlights and you would seldom catch her without a cigarette in her mouth.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Olivia did not think she resembled her parents very much, only a little. In the summer her hair would become lighter and it would look slightly red. Her face would be speckled with freckles, although in the rest of the year they would go away and in the winter time she would be awfully pale. Height wise she was very short, she didn’t get why though, her parents are both pretty average, she’s pretty sure Thomas is even over average. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Doris was the most horrible person she has ever met, she felt almost disgusted at the thought of sharing the same blood as this women. At times Doris could be sweet, she was never caring, but she could be sweet. Doris spent her days mostly drinking and playing poker with her very many male friends that would often spend the night. When Doris was drinking she would either become very happy and leave Olivia be or get very angry and blame Olivia for everything. More often than not her body would be covered in bruises and little small cuts, from both her mother and her moms friends. </span>
  <span>The worst thing that ever happened was when Olivia was 9 and her teacher had complained to her mom that Olivia’s hair was to unkept. So her mom sat her down in a chair, grabbed a pair of kitchen scissors and cut all her hair of, leaving a uneven mess. At the end of the session Olivia was bawling madly and her ear was bleeding from where her mom had accidentally cut it in her haste.  </span>
  <span>She was teased madly for it at school, even the teacher giggled at her, the only one who was still kind to her was Harry. She refused to tell him what had happened when he asked and would avoid his eyes as much as possible in shame. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She could never bare to tell Harry where she got all the cuts and bruises from and would quickly change the subject whenever he asked. </span>
  <span>After her dad left christmas was as good as forgotten and soon became a day that Olivia loathed. They never really celebrated it to begin with but usually her dad did stay sober that day and they’d do out and make snow angels and build snowmen. </span>
  <span>Once he was gone christmas just became like any other night in the Green household, with loud booming laughter from the kitchen table and Olivia looked in her room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>However in her pitiful rundown house she was not alone, for the first few years of her life she was sure that he was just an imaginary friend that would come and help her. A small elf like creature by the name of Kreacher would appear at her side at times. Only when she was alone of course. When she had been looked in her room for an inconveniently long time he would appear with food and drinks. After she had taken a particularly hard beating he would appear and mend her wounds. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At first she thought him rude and scary, but after time she began to really like him and she seems to have grown on him too. For now they are so close she has even heard Kreacher joke and laugh on a few occasions. When they first met he would call her “mudblood” with a sneer, she wasn’t sure what it meant so she just let it pass, but after some time he would call her miss Olivia and sometimes in a more affectionate manner Ollie or Missy. He was the only one to ever call her that and she felt strangely safe with him. A feeling that she could not recognise and felt foreign, that feels scary yet at the sametime one that she would hate to go without. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When Olivia turned 11, she did not get a Hogwarts letter but a letter to Ilvermony School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. At first she thought that it was some kind of joke, her being a witch and going to be an exchange student to Ilvermony. </span>
  <span>She was going to ask Kreacher about it that evening for he was alway muttering about odd things such as “stupid wizards”. However her mom found the letter first. Olivia has never been so scared. </span>
  <span>Her mom was walking around through the house muttering madly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>No-no…. It’s untrue- a LIE! They lied!..... Where is it?.... the magic…. where is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Olivia sat still at the  kitchen table still clutching the letter, reading it over and over again. Her mom still muttering nonsense came staggering into the kitchen and began to look wildly into the different drawers for cutlery. The sound of metal clashing and hitting the floor sounding like boat horns in the quiet house. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Where is it?.... where is it placed?” </span>
  <span>Her mom was still muttering madly, voice cracking ever so slightly. Finally she quieted down. Olivia turned to her mom and laid the letter down onto the table. </span>
  <span>Her mom was staring wide eyed at her, red beady eyes and tears running down her hollow cheeks. </span>
  <span>Olivia’s eyes traveled down her mom and stopped at her right hand, where she was holding a small sharp knife. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mom?” Olivia whispers, eyeing her carefully. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without answering her mom lunged forward at Olivia, making her hit her head hard into the wall. Her vision blurred and it takes a moment for her to come back to her senses, when she does she feels the most burning and fiery pain, throbbing in her stomach. She looked down and saw the knife her mom had been holding was now deep in her stomach. Like in slow motion she watches as her mother drew the knife out only to thrust it in again. All the while wailing,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where is it!? Take it out!? Take out the magic! Out!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Olivia was slumping against the wall, her shouth’s getting stuck in her throat. All she can think about is the pain and her want to get it to stop. She wants it to stops. In her mind she is begging, pleading to whoever or whatever would listen. A strong burning in her chest, a throbbing. Taking her mind of the pain and making her shout. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“STOP!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A flashing light, quickly and strongly flushes over them. Her mom is thrown back and slopes down to the floor and the clinking of metall ecos through the room as everything goes stark quiet. Olivia puts her hands over her stomach, trying to stop the bleeding as she falls forwards to her knees. Tears falling freely down her cheeks and through blurry eyes she lifts her head and sees her mom unconscious a few feet before her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No… mom… I’m sorry… please, I didn’t mean to…” she sobs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“KREACHER!” she howls at the top of her lungs as she feels herself getting more and more light headed. As she feels the blood dripping fast out of her hands she hears a sudden “pop” and knows that Kreacher has arrived, she let herself fall unconscious. </span>
