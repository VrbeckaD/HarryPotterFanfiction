    <p>It's a disaster. As a joke shop owner, George knows all about disasters, but usually he's the one creating them, and usually they don't involve him getting thrown out of classy restaurants; George makes sure that whatever establishments he gets thrown out of are never in any way reputable.</p><p>He considers apologizing again, but Angelina will probably just say (again) that it's really her fault, and then they'll be stuck in an endless loop of manners. George despises manners, but at this point he's left with little else. He tried, of course, to make jokes and laugh, but he finds he's not too funny nowadays, and Angelina didn't seem to be in the mood for laughing.</p><p>"Look," he says, and Angelina looks at him. The bags under her eyes were somehow less visible inside, but under the harsh streetlights she looks as though someone took an earlier version of Angelina Johnson and simply wrung most of the life out of her.</p><p>"Yes?" she asks. George decides that, since he's not likely to be getting a second date anyhow (doesn't want one, either), he may as well come out and ask.</p><p>"Fred took you to the Yule Ball," he says, and she nods. "Why are you here with me, then?"</p><p>She shrugs. "I thought you'd understand," she says, "and it would've sounded odd if I'd said I just wanted to spend a little time around someone who's doing worse than I am, yeah? Easier to call it a date and leave it at that."</p><p>George stares at her. "Doing worse than you are?"</p><p>"My dad died," she says. "Not... not because of the war, I'm Muggleborn. But he'd been sick for a while, and I've yet to meet a Healer that'll treat a Muggle, and my Healing Charms seemed to make him worse."</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>"He was... it's not the same. Fred was- you two were... but he was my dad, and he's gone now."</p><p>George nods. He doesn't know what else he can do; or, rather, he knows that there's nothing he can do. His family doesn't realize that, mostly, and that's part of the reason he was so happy to escape, even if for only an evening. He didn't know what he was expecting, but somehow, standing in the cold outside a building he never wanted to enter in the first place doesn't miss the mark as badly as it should have. He's not even disappointed, really.</p><p>"I've been meaning to ask you, will you reopen the joke shop?" Angelina asks.</p><p>"I haven't decided."</p><p>They walk through Muggle London, and George hates it, hates the people and the taxis and the way the world is going on even though Fred is dead, hates himself for walking and talking and breathing even though Fred is dead.</p><p>"I'd help you," she says.</p><p>"Would you?"</p><p>"If I could."</p><p><em>No one can help me</em> sounds far too dramatic, but George is feeling dramatic right now, and anyhow the sentiment is correct.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"People need to see that life goes on. That You-Know-Who didn't really win."</p><p>"Can't someone else show them?"</p><p>Angelina turns to him, and her voice is quieter but no less certain than when she was arguing with Oliver Wood about tactics or shooting hex after hex at the Death Eaters during the Battle of Hogwarts. "They are showing them. Quidditch will be restarting soon, the League said half a year after the last battle and that's almost up. Hogwarts is running as usual, the Ministry is being incompetent, people are moving back into Diagon."</p><p>"Let them."</p><p>"You could help a lot of people. And if that doesn't matter to you, you could help yourself, because we both know that at some point you'll have to keep living and it might as well be sooner rather than later."</p><p>"What if I don't? Want to keep living, that is."</p><p>"Then be sure to sell the shop to someone who does."</p><p>George recoils, just the slightest bit. "This is an odd lecture," he says. "First I've got to keep the shop running, and now I should off myself?"</p><p>"It's not a lecture, it's a proposal. I'll sink as much money as I have into the shop, if you keep running it. My parents are- my mum is rather well off, and if I make the Appleby Arrows money won't be a problem."</p><p>"I don't need money."</p><p>"No, but I believe you do need a new business partner."</p><p>She sighs. "You don't- you don't have to do anything. Go home and pretend this never happened, I promise not to mention this ever again if you don't contact me. I just want to do something. If I help other people, I might end up accidentally helping myself. Who knows?"</p><p>"Goodnight, Angelina."</p><p>"Goodnight."</p><p>She Disapparates with a sharp <em>pop</em>, and George stares at the spot where she'd been. He thinks about many things, and one of those things is the entirely unsurprising strength of Angelina Johnson.</p><p>Later that night, he will flip open a notebook that had been gathering dust for the past five months and read the notes he'd made for himself during the war.</p><p>Juice that can hide vegs if dropped in - somehow hide from parents, special additive rather than drink</p><p>Multi-use whoopee cushions - notice-me-not charm, works multiple times</p><p>Sentient coconuts - practically mammals anyway</p><p>Children's wands that can only do a few spells - lumos, protego, etc, pre-programmed somehow?</p><p>George will glance down the list, his eyes catching on a few words in particular. Some are good ideas, but seem too difficult to begin with. He will decide that the whoopee cushions will be good as a start, just to let people know that Weasley's Wizard Wheezes is still going, still running. And because at any given moment he's working on at least two ideas, George will pick the sentient coconuts as his side project.</p><p>George will Summon a piece of parchment and a quill and begin make a list of ingredients that he'll need to buy in Diagon Alley tomorrow.</p>
