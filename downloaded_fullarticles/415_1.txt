    <p>Full Summary:<br/>
All Remus Lupin wanted was to go to Hogwarts for as long as he could remember. Now that he's there he wonders if he made a mistake attending school. Between struggling with his relationships, fighting himself, and accidentally discovering something that makes him a target, he has his hands full. And this isn't even taking into account the full moon once a month. With many things happening year one is sure to be as eventful as it is stressful for the awkward boy and the three roommates he gets stuck with.</p><p>Eventual pairings but that will come in the later years. Definite eventual Lilly and James. Possible Wolfstar but depends on how the story naturally progresses.</p><p>Full Excerpt:</p><p>How had it come to this? To Sirius being bent over the still body of his friend clutching his cold hand. When had things gone so wrong? Sirius squeezed Remus Lupin’s hand. He looked more peaceful now than he had ever seen him before with his eyes closed. He would give anything to have his quirky secretive friend back. </p><p>To be driven mad by Remus’ secrets, by his skill at avoiding topics. He’d never ask another question again if it just meant he could have him back. But he couldn’t turn back time so now he had to say goodbye. They’d be coming for him in a few hours, to take him away and he’d never see his precious friend again. Thick tears slid down the twelve-year old’s cheeks. He hated crying in front of others but that hardly seemed to matter now. </p><p>How could he not cry when all this was his fault. He’d attempted to deny it but no matter how he looked at it he had to face the fact he had driven Remus to this. He choked on a sob the weight of guilt unbearable. He knew the others blamed him as much as he blamed himself, they’d never say it but he knew it was true.</p><p>Even if all the house points were taken away because of him, it would do nothing to ease his guilt. He doubted very much nothing ever would. He wished he was back home, wished he was facing a dementor for it was surely what he deserved. Never before in his entire life had Sirius Black hated himself so much.</p><p>“I’ll find out who did it.” He whispered into Remus’ ear as if this would somehow bring him back. Remus had often looked like he carried the weight of the world on his too slender shoulders and now Sirius knew what that felt like, now it was his turn. He’d get to the bottom of this or die trying. </p><p> </p>
