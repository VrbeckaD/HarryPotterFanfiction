  <span class="s1">“Vamo’ ya, guapo!”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <em>12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</em> </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The count of the compás cycles through Sirius’ head like thundering hooves, rattling his pounding pulse as his heels hammer the floor. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <em>12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,</em> </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <em>12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</em> </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">James’ expert strumming on the guitar behind him doubles, compounding the tempo into a fevered unfolding, as Sirius comes out of a half-turn and slams immediately into a series of triple beats that makes his thighs burn with such a burst of effort amid the final fumes of his stamina. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <em>“Alé!”</em> </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius can feel his hands sweating under the glare of the high-noon sun where he grips the hem of his jacket with his right hand as he extends the other, open in this final presentation of his building footwork. Every inch of him feels like it’s sweating, not only his palms. Outdoor performances always surprise him with sweat glands in places he had never thought <em>could</em> sweat.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <em>12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,</em> </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <em>12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11!</em> </span>
</p>
<p class="p3">The stage rattles ominously under Sirius’ feet as he pushes the tempo ever faster, another symptom of performing in squares instead of theatres or cafés when the city leaps at the chance to draw crowds in any and all corners of their edifice—<em>Fucking makeshift garbage,</em> he thinks mildly to himself through a whip-quick series of dizzying quebrada turns. The crowd clustered at the front of the postage-stamp stage swells with encouragement, clapping sharply along with the compás that rises to meet Sirius’ shoes in their rhythmic red blur against the boards.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">12,<em> 1, 2, </em>3,<em> 4, 5, </em>6,<em> 7, </em>8,<em> 9, </em>10,<em> 11!</em></span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius closes his buildup with a tight series of stomps and serves his llamada with slicing accuracy—his ponytail, carrying flecks of perspiration wicked from his neck, misses his eye by inches as it snaps around like a black viper. <em>Fucking weather.</em></span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The last phrase erupts from his feet in tight counter-tempo, and applause bursts in a chain through the square. As sweaty as Sirius feels, as exhausted as the bulerías has made him, he can’t help but grin as he pants for air in his final pose. He holds the position for a few more seconds, absorbing the praise like the water he’s fairly desperate for at this point, before dropping into a grateful and fairly boneless bow. <em>Fucking summer.</em></span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">August in Madrid is, by Sirius’ personal estimation, probably as close to hell’s climate as one could get if one deigned to imagine Satan with a Mediterranean inclination.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius rights himself and steps back with an arm extended to indicate James, who hoists his well-worn guitar by the neck and takes his own bow beside the half-broken chair on which he had propped his foot to play. The duo take a few more bows together before the crowd finishes applauding and breaks apart with the hum of summertime intent, ready to discover more of the city or continue on about their routine as if Sirius hadn’t just dragged himself halfway to death and back with a, if he’s being honest with himself, utterly fantastic performance. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius Black has always found it strange to grapple with the ephemeral nature of dancing; his body needs it, craves it, even on the days he can hardly drag himself into the studio to practice. It’s the only constant he’s ever kept.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Well done, brujo,” James says, clapping Sirius on the shoulder with the hand not wrapped around his guitar. He immediately recoils at the seep of sweat through the fabric and wipes his palm off on Sirius’ forearm, only to make a disgusted noise when he feels more fusty dampness there. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Cheers, reyna, you as well,” Sirius replies with a smirk. He bundles James into a headlock and digs his knuckles harmlessly into the other man’s equally sweaty tangle of hair, only releasing him when James slaps him twice on the shoulder to demand freedom as he’s always done since they were boys. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You smell awful, wash that fucking costume,” James chokes out with a dramatic show of gagging. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Luckier if I don’t,” Sirius sallies back as he shucks off the embroidered white jacket. He winces mutely at the feeling of the fabric peeling away from his limbs like a second, sodden skin.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You have admirers, suertoso,” James says, waving beatifically at a trio of tourist-y looking women by the edge of their makeshift stage. He leaves Sirius alone to flounder with the weight of attention, suddenly taking great interest in folding his chair up and re-casing his guitar with painful meticulousness. Sirius holds in the urge to kick the man over on the flagstones and smiles his most rehearsed smile at the waiting women, draping his damp jacket over his forearm with as much suavity as the smoldering sun will allow him at this point.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Good afternoon, how lovely!” one of them pipes up in poorly-pronounced Spanish. Sirius catches the emblem of an American flag on one of their bags and bows his head again with accepting thanks.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Thank you for watching, how lovely indeed,” he replies in English. Two of the women just barely hold in an outburst of cooing over his accented speech, an incongruous point of self-consciousness of Sirius’ but one he’s able to swallow every now and then, and Sirius has just enough energy left after his dance to not roll his eyes.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You’re <em>very</em> talented,” the one nearest to Sirius says with a thick tone of brittle innuendo, and he wonders vaguely how much cheap sangria these women have managed to find all afternoon. “Do all the men in Spain know to dance as well as you?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p3">She reaches out to brush Sirius’ arm, and he bristles at the brashness. <em>Fucking rude.</em> He hates generalizations about men who dance almost as much as he hates half-drunk tourists thinking they have the right to touch him after watching him dance.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Only the ones who also kiss men,” he deadpans. All three women slide into various states of offended or humored by his boorishness, but he doesn’t linger to see the outcome. He turns back to the small dip behind their stage, where James is counting a small bundle of busk tips from the inside of his hat and Sirius plops down on the ground to switch out his boots with his street shoes.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Did you get some new girlfriends?” James hums knowingly, fanning out the small-change bills and dividing them in an eyeballed “half” that he splits unevenly between himself and Sirius with a wink. Sirius snatches the thinner fold of bills and scoffs.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Funny. You should quit making hay on your guitar and tell jokes instead, eh?” He jerks his chin at the payphone booth on the opposite corner of the square as he yanks off one of his dancing shoes. “Call Lily, let’s get a drink.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">James hefts his guitar and, glancing to and fro to check for any stray cars in the busy square, crosses to the booth and leaves Sirius to finish changing out his shoes. Sirius laces his street shoes, stands, and wads up the jacket and stuff it into his duffel bag, quickly unbuttoning and peeling off the dress shirt beneath to shove it away just the same. He’s glad to have worn a black undershirt beneath it all, so even stained with sweat he at least looks like he’s just been out and about for a long time instead of venting a passion that gnaws at him like a parasite most days. The trousers are muted enough to stay.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He takes a moment to swig from his half-emptied and warmed water bottle from the corner of his bag, and he watches the square bustle about around him for a moment. It’s nice to just watch sometimes instead of <em>be</em> watched, as much as his insides clamor to be seen on the regular.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If Sirius could sate his spirit with anything besides flamenco, he would take it up in a heartbeat and throw dancing to the curb without a second thought. But the rhythms and the feeling of the dance have rooted themselves in his core, twined around his heart to hold fast until he likely draws his last fucking breath.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It’s exhausting. Nobody else understands the feeling like Sirius can describe it, not even James and his good-as-a-fifth-limb guitar.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius re-ties his hair just as James reemerges from the phone booth and waves him over with a nod, gesturing to the northeast end of the square toward the street that leads to their favorite café. Sirius hefts his bag, throws on his sunglasses, and clamps down on the restlessness still humming in his veins.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <em>Shut up, carajo, I just fed you for fifteen fucking minutes. Give me some peace!</em> </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius wishes, not for even close to the first time, that he could find any other outlet in existence.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He wishes he could find a way to give his rioting spirit some rest.</span>
