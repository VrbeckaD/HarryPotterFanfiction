    <p>It was September, it was meltingly hot, it was a world inching closer to an inevitable war. Ginny Weasley, age fifteen, stood in her bedroom, left foot gingerly placed to avoid stepping on the detritus scattered about her floor. She rifled through her drawer before finding a half-congealed lip gloss container. Good enough, she supposed. Ginny squinted at her mirror and swiped her lips with sticky gloss before bending over to levitate her trunk out the door and down the Burrow’s twisting staircase. She ignored the dripping heat, she ignored the ache in her arms from wounds half-healed. </p><p>“Ginny! Quit preening and get your arse down here already, would you? Mum’s going mental!” shouted a brother from some indiscernible floor. Ginny sighed and stepped back to give herself a quick once over in the mirror.</p><p>The overall effect, she decided, wasn’t half bad. Her hair was vivaciously red, even more so after a summer of midday quidditch practices and late night swims. Her freckles were, as Luna had once said, “like paint splatters”. Ginny smiled at the thought. </p><p>“Ginny!!” the voice called again.</p><p>“Coming!” Ginny pressed her tacky lips together, breathing in a manufactured strawberry scent. Was she trying too hard? No! Besides, it wasn’t like she was dressing up for anyone. She just wanted to look nice, for crying out loud. That was normal. She shoved her unwelcome thoughts back inside her mind and hurried down the stairs.</p><p>* * *</p><p>	The Hogwarts Expressed glimmered in a mid-morning haze, and the smell of its smoke filled the air. Ginny breathed deeply. She knew that the scent of smoke would always mean goodbye to her. There was nothing left she could do about it.</p><p>	Ginny turned and kissed her parents goodbye. When her mother held her longer than etiquette required, when her father couldn’t quite make out his “goodbye”, Ginny didn’t let it bother her. She was a girl in a world of war. She was coming of age with scars on her shoulders that wouldn’t heal, no matter how much Healing Balm her mother applied. She was learning to be impervious, aloof, the girl who didn’t care. The girl who wouldn’t care. She knew it wasn’t lasting.</p><p>	“Ginny!” a voice called from a smoke-obscured window. “There you are! Come on, Seamus and I have gone and gotten us all a compartment, you lucky bastard!” Dean stuck a hand out for her trunk, and she hoisted it up. Before long, she was making excuses to a desperate looking Harry Potter and ducking in to join Dean and Seamus. The two were unashamedly joined at the mouth, kissing fervently with legs wrapped around one another in impressive gymnastic feats.</p><p>	“Oh, I’m sorry, am I interrupting something?” she asked, trying to keep the laughter from her voice. Dean lazily pulled back, running a careless hand through Seamus’s hair before turning to answer her.</p><p>	“Ginny, my beautiful girlfriend. You look absolutely delectable. Come, let me ravish you as you tell me all about your summer hols.”</p><p>	“Sounds nice, really, but I’ll have to pass on that one. Too much work. You’re welcome to ravish me though - sounds fun.”</p><p>	“Oh, I’ll say,” said Seamus, snickering.</p><p>	“Grow up!”</p><p>Ginny settled in across from the two lovebirds, swapping stories with them of summers. It was decided, after very little debate, that Ginny had had the most harrowing one out of the three. Seamus took a close second, in regards to the time his mum had tried to set him up with a girl she met at a grocery shop by asking her to assist Seamus in the condoms aisle.</p><p>	“Oh, that’s nasty. When are you going to tell her you’re gay anyways, Seamus?” Ginny asked. Seamus bristled.</p><p>	“I’ll get around to it! There just wasn’t any time that seemed really appropriate, what with the war and all. My mam is a piece of work sometimes, you know.” Sensing Ginny’s disbelief, he tried another approach. “Speaking of coming out, I don’t see you hurrying to out yourself to anyone.” </p><p>	“I’m not dating anyone! What’s the point of forcing the issue if it’s not even relevant?” Ginny said. Dean gave a loud laugh.</p><p>	“Not dating anyone my arse! I swear, after reading your letters this summer I learned more about Loony Lovegood than I know about my own sister!” Imitating a high pitched voice, he continued. “Dean, Luna has such beautiful eyes. I don’t think I’ve ever noticed someone’s eyes the same way I notice hers. Dean, today I took a night swim with Luna to get rid of wrackspurts. We took off our clothes and would have had steamy lesbian sex if I wasn’t such a chicken. Dean, today I-”</p><p>	“Shut up!” Ginny cried, dismayed to feel her cheeks blush. “And don’t call her Loony, it’s cruel.”</p><p>	“So you’ll admit you like her?”</p><p>	“No! And I never wrote any of that, I swear! Seamus, go back to undressing Dean with your eyes or whatever it was you were doing before this. I don’t have feelings for Luna, and she definitely doesn’t have feelings for me!” Ginny finished, still feeling rather flushed. Dean raised an eyebrow. </p><p>	“Okay, so I paraphrased, but what does it matter? You practically said all that in your letters, I was just reading between the lines. It’s not my fault I’m analytical!”</p><p>	“You’re impossible,” Ginny said. “I’m going to hunt down some sweets. Try not to do anything obscene while I’m gone.”</p><p>	Ginny swept out of the carriages, pausing for a moment to collect herself. Of course, she had just lied to Dean and Seamus. She was completely and totally infatuated with Luna Lovegood. Luna, with her deep gray eyes and somber face and complete Luna-ness whose beauty escaped all definition. Yes, Ginny was lovesick - but really, it was more like a lovecold, and she planned to get over it quickly.</p><p>	Just then, Ginny glanced into the compartment she was passing by. There, Quibbler in hand, sat Luna Lovegood. Her hair seemed to glow as she slowly looked up and met Ginny’s eyes. They stared at each other wordlessly, and Ginny felt a quiver in her abdomen. Then Harry pointed at something and Luna’s gaze drifted away.</p><p>	“Hey, Ginny!” It was Zacharias Smith. “You know, I’ve been trying to find you - I’ve checked nearly all the compartments. I was wondering what really happened there. You know? At the department of mysteries? I heard - well, all sorts of hogwash. People claiming you dragged Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood with you. Ha! Can you imagine -”</p><p>	Ginny’s bat-bogey hex was right on target.</p>
