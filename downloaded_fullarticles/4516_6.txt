    <p>Harry stared across the dining hall. He is utterly confused. So confused that it's driving him insane. It's sixth year all over again.</p>
<p>"Harry."</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"What the fuck is wrong with you?"</p>
<p>Harry's mouth dropped open in shock as Ron choked on his Pumpkin Juice, causing him to go into a coughing fit. Since when did Hermione curse?</p>
<p>"Hermione? What? What do you mean 'what's wrong with me?'"</p>
<p>She gave him an unimpressed look. "You've been staring at Draco for the past month. If I didn't know any better I'd say its sixth year all over again."</p>
<p>He sighed, picking at his food with his fork. "It's just... He's not being a prat. I'm used to him yelling, I'm used to him teasing, taunting, trying to get a rise out of me. I'm used to him being a cruel snake. I'm not used to this subdued person that's taken his place." He left out the part about him missing the fights they'd get in, because at least he had his attention, where as now, the blond boy doesn't say a damn thing to anyone but Pansy and Blaise.</p>
<p>She sighed, then looked as if she was trying to find the right words to say. "Harry," she began softly, "wars change people. Besides, he apologized to all of us the day eighth year started. He hasn't done anything but stay under the radar and keep to himself, Pansy, and Blaise."</p>
<p>Ron nodded from his place beside him. "She's right mate, they have changed. Albeit it's a bit disorienting to not see him sneer and taunt us anymore, but I'm more than happy to welcome the change."</p>
<p>He sighed, and then watched as the blond Slytherin boy got up -without even touching his food- and walked out of the great hall. It didn't pass his attention that some Ravenclaws were snickering to themselves about how "Malfoy deserve to be thrown in Azkaban with his father" and it made Harry's blood boil.</p>
<p>Malfoy was forced to play a role that his father had chosen for him. He wanted to keep his family alive. He didn't give a shit what happened to himself, but he wanted his family safe. So yeah, he spoke up for Malfoy at the boy's trial.</p>
<p>Then, a thought occurred to Harry.</p>
<p>"Hey guys, remember how Sirius taught me how to be an animagus?"</p>
<p>His friends looked skeptical, and nodded uneasily. "Well, I think that Malfoy needs a friend. Maybe a cute, tiny creature that couldn't possibly do him any harm."</p>
<p>Hermione and Ron shared glances between each other. Surprisingly, it was Ron who spoke up. "If you think it's the right thing to do, mate. But when he finds out, he's not going to be very happy with you."</p>
<p>Harry sighed, but his mind was made up.</p>
<p>"He needs a friend. That's what I'm going to give him."</p>
