    <p>It was a crisp spring day in 1982 that the Doctors Granger decided to move, along with their precocious daughter Hermione, to rural Wiltshire.</p><p>A freak fire had burnt down their old practice – though thankfully, they hadn’t had to pay much in damages, and an old friend had told them about an opening. Wiltshire was in need of good dentists, and they fit the bill. Apparently, the pay would be better as well – and Jean and Dan Granger wanted the best for their little girl.</p><p>“The country would be good for a little growing girl, you think?” Jean had asked her husband.</p><p>“I do believe so.” Despite both of them growing up, and living, in London, Dan’s parents had always extolled the values of living in simple rural counties as opposed to the busy, smog-filled cities.</p><p>“It would do us good, I think, to raise our daughter in the calm, uncluttered countryside,” Dan had agreed.</p><p>And so, one April day, they packed all their belongings in their minivan, little three-year-old Hermione bouncing in the back, sold their London apartment to a bright young couple, and set out for Colerne, Wiltshire.</p><p>The Grangers were immediately charmed by their little two-storey house, which boasted a very generous yard. The house had been abandoned for a couple of years, and as such was in disrepair. Thankfully, the dental practice – next street down – was not in as dire straits. Though there were some renovations to do, on the house and on the practice (which needed to be brought up to code), the Grangers tackled them with glee. Both loved a challenge, and Hermione was perfectly angelic, already reading baby books while her parents shaped up their new home and practice.</p><p>Within a month, their practice – Drs. Granger – and their quaint little house, named the Vines, were both livable and open. The neighbors were perfectly nice, if a little close-minded, the Anglican church was right next to the practice, and there were no oppressive city noises. Colerne even had their legends – on the outskirts of the village stood an imposing Manor house, which was subject to all sorts of gossip and speculation.</p><p>Impressive, black and imposing, the place – known simply as the Manor house – it wasn’t in ruins, but it didn’t look lived in. Word around the village was that a family lived there, and that they might even have a little child, but no one ever saw the mysterious Lord and Lady of the Manor. In fact, though many gossiped about the place, no-one seemed inclined to go up there and get to know the reclusive family. It was all a bit exciting, this little village mystery, though privately Jean Granger worried about a child growing up in such an environment.</p><p>In conclusion, the Grangers had no regrets leaving London and moving to Wiltshire – until Hermione started growing up, and it was made clear that as a bright, precocious child, she wouldn’t have many friends. Until their daughter met the mysterious blond-haired boy. Then, all was well.  </p>
