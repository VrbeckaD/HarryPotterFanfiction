    <p>"Fred put me down!" A blonde girl screams as the red-head in question throws her over his shoulder.</p>
<p>They both have wide smiles that reach their sparkling eyes as the setting sun shines on their faces. Fred suddenly falls and they stumble into the fresh layer of snow, laughter like music to their ears as they try to untangle themselves. When he finally frees his long and gangly limbs from her shorter ones, Fred simply stares into her eyes.</p>
<p>"Sorry Love, I didn't see the log." A mischievous smile pulls at his lips as he speaks.</p>
<p>The girl rolls her eyes as she stares back up into his light brown eyes. "Sure, you didn't, Darling."</p>
<p>He lowers his head and softly presses his lips against her, arms holding him up as she slowly wraps her own around his neck. When they pull away for air, he smiles adoringly at her before pulling her to her feet and turning to look at the sunset. A happy sigh pushes past his lips as he holds her close and rests his chin on the top of her mess of blonde curls.</p>
<p>"I can't wait to spend Christmas <em>and </em>New Years together." The words are soft but cause Fred to stiffen.</p>
<p>"Noelle ..." Fred lets his arms drop as he takes a step back.</p>
<p>Noelle scowls as she turns, anger evident in her crystal blue eyes. "No Fred, you've been promising to stay for Christmas all year! And before that, you promised to visit on my birthday and Halloween and-"</p>
<p>"I know Love, but-" His soft plea is cut off by Noelle's shaky voice.</p>
<p>"It's like you have this whole other life and I'm not even worth sharing it with."</p>
<p>Fred immediately pulls her closer as presses his lips firmly against hers in a chaste kiss. "Don't ever think that, Love. You are worth everything, my whole world."</p>
<p>"Then why do you never show up? Why do you never invite me over? And why have I never met your family? If I'm so important then why do I feel like you're trying to keep me hidden?" Eyes full of tears, Noelle continues pressing, desperate for answers.</p>
<p>Fred runs a hand through his hair as he mulls over her questions. "Love, I promise it's not what you think. My family is ... strange. And I have people that wouldn't exactly be approving of this relationship, I'm trying to protect you. I just need you to trust me."</p>
<p>"I really want to trust you, Freddie," Noelle sighs as she pulls at her oversized t-shirt, "But it's hard when you don't tell me anything and keep breaking promises. You promise a life together, but I can't live a life of always wondering when I'm going to see you next or whether my in-laws even know about me."</p>
<p>Fred only stares at her, not moving for a moment before he envelopes her into a tight hug. Tears of his falls as he speaks into her hair. "In six months, on your birthday. I'm going to take you to meet my parents, we're going to have dinner and I'm going to show you my world."</p>
<p>Noelle closes her eyes and lets out a reluctant sigh. "Fine, but if you don't ... I don't think I can do this for any longer Freddie."</p>
<p>Fred smiles sadly and nods, "I understand, Love, and I thank you for putting up with me for the last three years."</p>
<p>Noelle playfully shoves him as she cheekily winks at him, "What can I say, I'm pretty amazing."</p>
<p>"That you are, my Love." Fred smiles adoringly as he places a soft kiss to her forehead and takes her hands in his own. "I have to leave on Thursday morning, but I promise I'll be back by your birthday."</p>
<p>"You know .... my mum's not gonna be home for another two days ..." Noelle leaves her words to hang in the air with their foggy breaths, smiling innocently up at Fred as he smirks.</p>
<p>"Is that right, my Love? Well, I can't very well leave without making sure you are going to be completely safe." He suddenly sweeps her into his arms and carries her back to her house.</p>
<p>*******************************************************************</p>
<p>"Are you sure he'll be here Sweetie?" Noelle's mother calls out, eyeing the clock on the wall.</p>
<p>It is past noon, but Noelle is still waiting anxiously by the kitchen. "Yes mum, he promised he'd be here on my birthday." The blonde rubs her stomach carefully, beaming as she thinks of the little one growing in there.</p>
<p>Smiling softly her mother walks around the corner, "I know Sweetie, but I just want you to be open to-"</p>
<p>"Fred's not like dad, Mum." Noelle briskly cuts off her mother, almost offended at her implication. "He's not gonna leave me alone with a child."</p>
<p>"Of course not, Noelle," her mother quickly back peddles and caresses her daughter's face. "Fred is a lovely boy, and I know he loves you very much, but you're both young and it's okay if it doesn't-"</p>
<p>"It will work out." Noelle reaffirms, partially for herself and partially for her mother. She shakes away the doubts when she feels the corners of her mouth droop, "I'm gonna go double check I've got everything."</p>
<p>Taking two stairs at a time she pulls down her cardigan to protect her skin from the fresh spring breeze. She swings open her door and almost shrieks at the sight of a giant barn owl resting on her dresser. It twitters at her before dropping a letter from its beak and closing its eyes. Noelle shakily lifts the letter, recognizing the rushed handwriting. She musters up her courage and tears open the envelope to unfold the yellow parchment.</p>
<p>
  <em>My dear Noelle,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I am so sorry my Love, but I cannot make your birthday. Some things have come up and I won't be able to return for a little while longer. I promise that the second I can I will bring you to meet my family and show you my world. I know I promised, but I swear I can't leave right now, I'd be putting you and my family in danger. I love you more than you could ever know,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Yours,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Fred</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>P.S. The owl's name is Hercules, give him your response and he'll find me.</em>
</p>
<p>Tears fall from her eyes as she scrunches up the paper. Taking a pen of her own, Noelle sloppily writes her response and all but throws it at the owl before storming from her room and out of the house. Ignoring her mother's calls, she continues until she can't see through her tears.</p>
<p>Noelle cradles her arms around her unborn daughter as she leans against a tree trunk. At 6 months the little girl was moving and kicking like no tomorrow. Noelle laughs bitterly as she thinks of the life she imagined with her baby and her love.</p>
<p>"Fuck him, I'm gonna do this on my own," Noelle grumbles before stumbling to her feet and making her way back to her house.</p>
<p>*********************************************************************</p>
<p>George steps onto the porch of the country cottage with the letter clutched in his hands. He always knew that Fred had a girlfriend, he was his twin for Godric's sake! But when he promised to keep her a secret, he never imagined he would be in this position. Summoning all his courage, the red-head raps twice on the wooden door and anxiously waits for an answer.</p>
<p>When the door is opened by a heavily pregnant girl, he immediately realises why his brother loved her. He studies her face as her ice-blue eyes narrow and her pink lips morph into a scowl as she tries to slam the door.</p>
<p>George quickly intercepts and holds it open, "Noelle, let me explain."</p>
<p>Noelle furrows her brow in confusion as she opens the door to study the boy in front of her. "You're not..."</p>
<p>"Fred? No, I'm not." George's eyes moisten into a pool of tears at the mention of his twin. After sucking in a shaky breath George continues gently. "I'm his twin, George. Noelle, you need to know that Fred loved you... more than you will ever know."</p>
<p>Noelle's eyebrows knot together whilst her eyes flickered in confusion, panic rising in her chest as she intakes George's weak and exhausted composure. "Why are you here, George?" Noelle demands, "I already told Fred he needs to give me some space."</p>
<p>George only asks to come in, and the simplicity yet desperation in the request moves Noelle to hesitantly step back. They settle into the lounge, the atmosphere heavy with anticipation.</p>
<p>Upon sitting George subtly fiddles with his hands as the courage to turn his complete attention to her arises. "Noelle..." he breathes, "Fred's dead." His eyes flutter to hers which swirl a fiery icy blue as he chokes on the words. His Adam's apple bobbing sharply as if he's attempting to swallow his words back. The truth clogging his throat.</p>
<p>Eyes frozen wide the shock immobilises her body into a rigid stature until finally, her face morphs to one of unfiltered horror. "No... No, he's not... He can't be!" Her breaths turn ragged and laboured as she tries to process the information. Scrutinising George's face, she endeavours to find a hint of deception, but the raw pain in the twin's eyes is as genuine as anything.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry Noelle, it's been hard on all of us." George murmurs in an attempt at comfort but it only triggers Noelle to release all her pent up frustration.</p>
<p>"No, you don't get it!" she screams as she shoots from her cushion, "He's dead! And the last thing I told him is that he couldn't be a part of our daughter's life anymore! I told him I never wanted to see him again!" Anger, pain, grief and regret flash through Noelle's eyes. Stuck in place her body cannot decide how to react except her eyes are overflowing to adorn her cheeks with a glistening sorrow.  Too dazed Noelle barely notices her knees shakily lowering her back onto her seat.</p>
<p>"Noelle, he passed away before he could read your letter." George softly whispers, the words echoing around the room. Noelle's composure is demolished as George continues, "He didn't know you were pregnant." </p>
<p>With these words, Noelle's composure and heart shattered and splintered like glass. George wraps her frame into his arms to tame the violent shakes and shudders that wrack through her body alongside her sobs, and his soothing touch burned only reminders into the skin of her dead love. Georges own tears trickled down to splash upon her blonde hair, and they remained clutching onto each other for a period that felt like an eternity.</p>
<p>"I didn't get to say goodbye ..." Noelle murmurs. Swallowing his sorrow George pulls away to collect the parcel he came to deliver and gently places it in Noelle's shaking hands, anxious of her reaction.</p>
<p>Her eyes squint as she reads through her tears, scanning the pages at a furious pace, trying to make complete sense of the document in front of her. "I-I don't understand."</p>
<p>"It's Fred's will; he left all his belongings to you. I'll also be setting up an account of half the company's profits for her when she's older." George's eyes wander to Noelle's stomach at the end of his sentence. He smiles softly before standing and frowning again. "I need to go, mum expected me home half an hour ago. She'll be panicking."</p>
<p>"Can I come?" Noelle looks up, hope shining through her glistening eyes. She is gripping the papers tightly as she looks to George, "Please George, let me come."</p>
<p>George's eyes soften as he almost nods, but he shakes his head and hesitates for a moment. before answering. "I'm sorry Noelle, we can't dump this on the family right now. Not this soon after Fred ..." His unfinished sentence hangs in the air, but Noelle only clenches her jaw and stands to leave the room, "Wait-"</p>
<p>"No, George, I can see that both you and Fred want to hide me so I'll make it easier for you." Her eyes are lit with fury as she glares at George. "Don't come anywhere near me or my daughter again. I don't want your money and I don't want your pity."</p>
<p>George frantically scrambles toward her. "Noelle, it's not-"</p>
<p>"What I think?" She lets out a humourless laugh and her next words are accompanied by a pained smile. "Let me ask you, George, how long will it be before I get to meet the family of the man I loved?" When silence follows her question, she nods and scoffs. "That's what I thought, so if you don't mind, leave and don't come back."</p>
<p>Without waiting for a response, the blonde turns and steps over to open the door. George reluctantly follows, unsure of what to do or say. After he exits, he looks back and sighs. "I really am sorry Noelle ... if you ever need anything, just go to the willow tree by Cullaman Creek."</p>
<p>With those words, the red-head slowly walked away, trying his hardest to keep his composure until he was out of sight of the house. Little did he know that as soon as he was out of her view, Noelle had broken down and cried until she fell asleep.</p>
<p>Noelle never really got over Fred's death, no matter how much she tried to convince herself that she did. When Minerva-Kennedy was born, Noelle swore to herself that she was going to do the best she could, no matter what.</p>
