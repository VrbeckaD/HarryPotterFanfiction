    <p>Newton Artemis Fido Scamander slammed his door and laid on his bed. He buried his face in his pillow as he wished that he was back with James, Sirius, and Remus. Angry tears fell down his face and onto his pillow. Newt did not know how long he has been crying for, but he stopped when a knock came on his door. The young wizard did not bother to say anything. The door opened, in the doorway stood Theseus. Newt did not look up from his pillow or say anything, nothing at all.  “Newt? Hey Newt?” Newt did not look at him. “I know you're upset, but we need to go,” Newt sighed and threw the pillow at him and got off the bed and ran out of the room. He took his wand from the end table by the door without saying anything or looking at or in the direction of his older brother. Theseus sighed and followed Newt out. “Mother, we are going now,” Theseus called in his booming voice. Newt was at the door behind him. Theseus grasped Newt’s arm when he tried to run. “Come Newt don’t try to fight this,” Newt sighed and rolled his eyes a little, but Theseus did not see it as the two brothers were gone with a pop.</p><p>              Theseus dragged Newt by his arm all the way through the lobby of the ministry of magic and to his office. “Come on Newt don’t be difficult,” Newt sighed and allowed his brother to pull him into his office.</p><p>“Why, do I have to be here?” Newt finally spoke. His voice was sharp but there was a hint of sadness behind it.</p><p>“I know Newton, you hate this, but think about it, you might get a job at sixteen and mother wanted you out of the house,” Newt sighed and nodded.</p><p>“Your right Theseus sorry, but, but,” Newt trailed off as they go into Theseus’s office. Fear formed inside as they entered. <em> ‘This is it, my job, Oh, Merlin I can't do this.’</em>  Newt thought with fear.  <em> ‘I can't do this, I can't do this.’ </em>Newt panicked as he looked around his brother’s office.  “Brother, I,” Newt cut off voice shaking with fear. Theseus, however, got to work and did not notice this. Newt sighed and sat down on a near-by chair.  He closed his eyes for he was a little tired. He, however, opened them quickly when he heard someone yell.</p><p>“Help! Help,” Newt jumped to his feet and ran out of the room without his brother noticing.</p><p>              Newt ran to the call for help. He did not care if Theseus would be mad at him, all he cared about was helping this person that needs help. Newt stopped when he saw someone on the ground shaking with fear. “Are you ok sir?” Newt asked unsure what to do or say. The man looked at him and sighed.</p><p>“There's a,” he cut himself off. Newt looked into the room that the man ran out of. The room was destroyed as if an animal ran through it. <em> ‘Niffler.’ </em> Newt thought as he walked slowly into the room.</p><p>“Come here you little bugger,” Newt said as he looked around the room.  Then the Platypus-like beast jumped on him. Newt quickly grabbed the beast by his feet and carried it out with a big smile on his face. However, it was wiped clean off when he saw his brother standing right in front of him.</p><p>“What do you think you're doing Newton? Come here right now,” Newt cursed himself and stayed where he was looking at the Niffer with a smile forming on his face. “Newton get over here now!” Newt however stayed were he was.</p><p>“No,” Newt spoke in a quiet but stern voice. Theseus raised his eyebrow at his brother.</p><p>“What? What did you say?”  Newt swallowed. <em> </em></p><p><em>‘I’m going to get it now, but still,’ </em> “I said no. I saved this man here,” Newt said voice breaking with fear but it was still strong. Theseus walked over to him. Newt knew that his temper was rising, but he did not care.</p><p>“Newton Artemis Fido….” Newt cut him off with his hand on his arm.</p><p>“No. I saved him,” Theseus was clecking his jaw now as he walked even closer to his younger brother now. Newt opened his mouth to say something but the man that Newt saved stood up and spoke for Newt.</p><p>“Can I say something?” Newt and Theseus both nodded. The man took a deep breath and said: “Your brother is amazing with, um what is that?” he pointed to the Niffer. Newt’s frown turned into a huge smile.</p><p>“This is a Niffler. They are not dangerous, but slightly annoying for they love anything shiny,” Newt said with pride in his voice.  Theseus rolled his eyes a little and backed away from his little brother.</p><p>A Niffler” Newt nodded showing it to him. “And you say they are not dangerous?” Again Newt nodded. Theseus watched as the man laughed and smiled at his little brother. “You are amazing young one,” Newt blushed but did not say anything.</p><p>“Thank you, sir,” Newt said voice getting quieter.</p><p>“I’m sorry I did not ask your name?’</p><p>“Newt Scamander. That’s my brother Theseus,” Newt said not meeting the man’s eyes. Theseus then grasped his brother's arm.  “No wait, brother,” Newt cried as his brother pulled him away from the man.</p><p>“Wait, Theseus. Your brother has talent. When he becomes of age. I would love for him to work here at the ministry,” Theseus let go of his brother’s arm shocked. In fact, Newt has never seen him so shocked before.</p><p>“What? I would, I don’t know,”</p><p>“You will be working with beasts,” Newt smiled.</p><p>“Then yes. I would love to,”  Theseus took his arm again and literally pulled him back to his office.</p>
