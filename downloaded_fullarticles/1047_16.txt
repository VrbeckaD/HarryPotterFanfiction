  <em> From the Notes of Professor Sherlock Holmes: </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Salix belligeratus (Eng. Troll’s Willow), colloquially “Whomping Willow”  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Family: Salicaceae </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Semi-sentient (enchantment; see p. 83) </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Deciduous; knotted; particular. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Consistently aggressive behavior toward perceived threats; 2 exceptions. Possibly reaction to theorized recessive allele m or lack thereof. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Note: Mycroft = perceived threat. Visit willow often. </em>
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Predictably, it is Mycroft who interrupts a perfectly pleasant morning. </p>
<p>“Sherlock.”</p>
<p>“Headmaster,” Sherlock greets, turning a page, enjoying the particular silence of his brother bristling.</p>
<p>“Isn’t there somewhere you ought to be?”</p>
<p>“Here, researching,” Sherlock says, making a note in the margin. “I’m a professor. I’m meant to research.”</p>
<p>There is the creak and groan of a branch lifting high, then crashing heavily down. Sherlock glances up to check whether Mycroft has been hammered into the ground like a nail, but alas, his umbrella is open, its protective enchantments flashing briefly visible with the impact like a burst of fog. Mycroft’s magic has always looked like that, when it shows itself: subtle, like him. Powerful. Insufferable. </p>
<p>Mycroft stares flatly back at him, unflinching, as the branch sulks away into its place. “A rather perilous location for research.”</p>
<p>Sherlock glances up at the willow, resting a placating hand on its root. <em> Yes, he bores me, too. </em> “We’ve an understanding.”</p>
<p>“How lovely.” Another burst of silver smoke blocks the root swiping at his ankles. “I don’t suppose you’ve considered the time.”</p>
<p>“What a dull thing to consider.”</p>
<p>“You’re meant to be in the Great Hall—“</p>
<p>“Not hungry.”</p>
<p>“—assisting preparations for the Welcome Feast—“</p>
<p>“Got bored. Left.”</p>
<p>“Ah.” Mycroft tilts his chin down in that way Sherlock hates, as though humoring a pouting child. “You’re hiding.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“What was it?”</p>
<p>“<em>It </em> was unimportant. Haven’t <em> you </em>anything better to do?” Sherlock asks, eyeing the folds of Mycroft’s robes, the shape of them at the chest, the hidden rectangle of a letter. “Surely the Ministry is waiting on your report.”</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine what you could be talking about,” Mycroft says dryly, not that he’d be at liberty to say anything else. </p>
<p>Sherlock rolls his eyes and returns to his book on the transformative properties of fluxweed, but the book snaps shut in his hands before he can read another word. He whips a dark glare at Mycroft, who at the very least has the decency to look a bit conflicted, but the book holds firmly shut when he tries to open it again. The familiar anger flashes through his veins, sandpaper-raw, and he hisses, “<em>Mycroft. </em>”</p>
<p>“To the Great Hall,” his brother says, seeming to have pushed through his conflict and decided to grant himself grace. “Now.”</p>
<p>Above them, the willow shudders, and a branch slams into the invisible shield before it can slap Mycroft across the face, and Sherlock touches the root again, grateful. “And with which tasks shall I assist?” he asks coldly. “Levitating the banners, or enchanting the candle wicks?”</p>
<p>“You chose this, Sherlock,” his brother quietly replies. “If you still cannot work out how to function at this school, then pursue something else. Anything else, for goodness’ sake. Until you make that choice, it is as you said.” His voice lowers with his brow. “You are a <em> professor</em>. That title is not given lightly. Not here.”</p>
<p>“I’m aware of the implications of my <em> title</em>--”</p>
<p>“Then you understand the responsibility you assumed when you accepted this position,” Mycroft clips, straightening again. All at once, the book gives where Sherlock is tugging on it and comes open again, the enchantment released. “The students will be arriving soon, and you will be present when they do.” Lifting his chin, glaring through the tree, he adds, “Both of you.”</p>
<p>“Of course, Headmaster,” the other side of the tree replies innocently, and Sherlock fights a smirk.</p>
<p>Mycroft, as is ever the case when it is the both of them, looks unimpressed and deeply weary. “I’ll be back shortly to ensure you haven’t lost your way.”</p>
<p>“All you ever seem to do,” Sherlock says with an unkind smile, and his brother unkindly returns it and turns on his heel, continuing toward the Owlery. He lowers and closes his umbrella once he is no longer in range of the willow, and Sherlock eyes it as he goes. Mycroft keeps his wand in the handle. Cherry wood, the heartstring of a dragon at its core. He can still recall the day Mycroft was chosen, small as he had been at the time. He remembers every detail.</p>
<p>On the other side of the tree, a newspaper closes. “He’s in a mood, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>“He’s always in a mood.” Sherlock closes his book again, decisively, if only because it was Mycroft who opened it. “Particularly on Sorting day. There are few things he finds more appalling than children in large groups.”</p>
<p>“Lucky thing he’s not a proper headmaster.” Whisper of grass, crunch of a leaf underfoot, and Jim leaning against the trunk beside him, dramatically silhouetted by the sun. Deliberate, probably. He holds out a hand, and Sherlock passes him the book, standing and brushing grass and leaves from his robes while Jim flips through the pages. They move as though they were never frozen shut. “Rude little trick.”</p>
<p>“Very.” Sherlock takes the book back when it is offered, lowering his eyes. “He’s done it since we were children.”</p>
<p>“Aww.” Jim misses Sherlock’s glare, busy looking up into the willow’s branches, his head tilted a bit to the side. The tree is still, seeming to breathe in the wind, but otherwise appearing as any other willow might. No assault of branches for Professors Holmes and Moriarty. “Have you worked it out yet?” he asks. “Why she likes us?”</p>
<p>“Beyond the obvious hypothesis, no.” Sherlock follows his gaze, studying the tree as he has a thousand times since his first day at the school. “As satisfying as it would be to suggest it merely dislikes Mycroft, the likelier explanation is that it simply doesn’t perceive us as threats.”</p>
<p>“Nah,” Jim drawls, bringing his fingers to a hanging branch, idly lifting it and letting it go. “It’s something else.”</p>
<p>The tower bell chimes out the hour, and from across the grounds there is the particular boom of Mycroft’s voice undergoing magical amplification. “<em>Now</em>, Professors.”</p>
<p>Sherlock, who had in fact been preparing to do as he was told, now slouches defiantly back against the willow’s trunk while its branches swing toward the sound, poised to strike. He sends a dirty look in that direction for good measure.</p>
<p>Casually, Jim asks, “Shall I have him taken care of?” </p>
<p>The side of Sherlock’s mouth tugs up unbidden, because this is their joke, and his sour moods rarely stand a chance. “Not today.”</p>
<p>They go, wading through the browning grass, the entrance to the castle rising before them, and Sherlock quietly takes a breath. He can never walk through these doors without thinking back to his arrival at this place, and to the roiling dread he’d felt that those doors would not admit him, that they would simply slam shut. As many times as he’s passed through them by now, he still cannot help but brace himself, just a bit, should this be the day they perceive that he does not belong.</p>
<p>As they approach, Jim’s hand catches his. Nothing else, because Jim does not like to talk about true things, but he does like to remind Sherlock that he understands. They pass through the doors as one.</p>
<p>Once through, Sherlock lets out his breath. Already he can hear the buzz of preparation from the Great Hall, when they’ve barely set foot in the entryway. He knows what he will find when they go in: Plates and bowls, glasses and silverware, napkins and ladles will be floating dutifully from the kitchens to the tables, setting themselves uniformly in place, directed by Professor Hudson’s wand; Professor Adler will be at the front, her charmwork in deep conversation with the Great Hall’s enchanted ceiling, negotiating; off to the side, Professor Hooper will be speaking quietly to the gathered ghosts, wearing a bright smile that only emerges for them (and, according to a smirking Jim, for Sherlock himself - he is dubious). Professor Anderson will likely be brushing past someone in a huff, swearing under his breath about the school poltergeist, nearly tripping over the many house elves scurrying about underfoot. In the middle of it all, Professor Watson - Mary, she insists - will be delegating and conducting the work with the ease of a seasoned composer, and John - Doctor Watson, to the students - will be somewhere off to the side, watching her proudly, before her lifted eyebrow will order him back to work.</p>
<p>John will spot him and beckon, and Jim will slip away to charm the professors who like him or unnerve those who don’t, because they have never quite belonged in the same space, Jim and John. They are incompatible magnets, resisting each other’s polarity, even as Sherlock stubbornly continues to need them. And John will find a way for Sherlock to assist without the embarrassment of having to brandish his useless wand.</p>
<p>His chin is taken, and his head is turned, and he’s pulled back from knowing - <em> knowing </em> - what will happen, back to what is happening. What is happening is that Jim is turning his hand, holding his jaw, tugging him forward to rest against his forehead, because he has followed him right into his knowing, step for step.</p>
<p>“Do you suppose we’ll ever be found out?” Sherlock whispers.</p>
<p>“Probably,” Jim says. “Matter of time.”</p>
<p>“Unprecedented situation,” Sherlock mutters. “Our case would go to the Ministry.”</p>
<p>“Or the courthouse,” Jim agrees. “It won’t be a problem.”</p>
<p>“For you.”</p>
<p>“For us.” Jim’s fingers are stroking the nape of his neck, and Sherlock blissfully closes his eyes, even as tension still grips in his chest. “Suppose they ask us to prove we’re what we say we are. Can’t you just see it? The looks on their faces.” A conspiratorial curve to his voice, the sound of his smile, a cool thumb brushing his jaw. “They can’t imagine what we are.”</p>
<p>Sherlock’s breath releases in a slow stream. “No,” he agrees.</p>
<p>They - <em> they</em>, all of them, with their broomsticks and their bloodlines and their small, searching minds - could never, because at times Sherlock still cannot imagine it, even as he lives it. That the two of them could both exist, in the same place, at the same time, being all that they are and are not. Mycroft froze away any belief in coincidence long ago. This is - they are - something else.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you two sweet,” one of the portraits coos - Helga, always Helga - from her place on the far wall, “but oughtn’t you join the others? I’m sure they could use some good hands in there.”</p>
<p>“Oh, let them be,” says the portrait on the wall adjacent. Rowena remains fond of them. “Their position is unique.”</p>
<p>No privacy at this school, none at all. Huffing a sigh, Sherlock mutters, “Nothing for it, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Mm-hm.” Jim smiles, stepping back and letting him go. He blows a kiss to the portrait of Salazar; as ever, he only watches them and seethes, his mouth a thin line. “Shall we?”</p>
<p>As they pass through the doors to the Great Hall, they become the people they are to the rest of this school, tucking away the people they are to one another. Professor James Moriarty, Arithmancy, takes a steadying breath as his brain begins to shout numbers at him - because that part is real, that magnificent mind of his greedily devouring data in every moment, and utterly gorging itself at large events like this one, with so many things to be calculated - and his mask clicks into place, and he is one of them.</p>
<p>And Professor Sherlock Holmes, Herbology, takes a sweeping glance about the room - Professor Hudson with the dinnerware, Adler at the front, Hooper with the ghosts, Mary at the center, and there goes Anderson, who should not be Potions Master but is, stumbling to avoid a house elf in his path, boring boring <em> boring </em> - and for a moment, he is struck by the unfairness of it. An old anger, the same familiar anger of Mycroft snapping his book shut. This should have been his world long ago. Strictly speaking, it never should have been Jim’s world at all. But here they are.</p>
<p>Here they are, and so Professor Sherlock Holmes, son of wizards, brother of the Headmaster, will go on pretending he has always belonged here. That on his eleventh birthday, an owl came to his window with an envelope in its beak. That he was passed over for the position of Potions Master due to lack of experience, and only that. That there is magic in his blood, even one drop. One drop at all.</p>
<p>Jim’s fingers brush his and then he’s gone, just in time for John to spot Sherlock across the Great Hall and wave him over. Round and round they go. Nothing is new, not really. But Sherlock will go, and he and John will pretend he is helping with whatever task has been set, and at nightfall this hall will be swarming with children who will not spend the end of their eleventh August as he did. None of them will spend tonight sitting hunched under the sheets with a torch and their father’s wand (pear wood, twelve and a half inches, unicorn hair), whispering desperate spells between sniffles, throwing the wand across the room when it simply doesn’t listen. They will not doubt once that they are special, powerful, chosen. And later, Sherlock will meet Jim at the top of the Astronomy Tower to drain a bottle of outrageously expensive wine and remember what they are.</p>
<p>They, too, are special. They are powerful. </p>
<p>They were not chosen.</p>
<p>“Joining us, then?” John says when Sherlock reaches him, his smile lopsided, not unkind. “Come on. Mary’s got me righting all of the portraits after that business with the pixies the other day. Could use your eye.”</p>
<p>He does not need Sherlock’s eye, but John is one of the few who know about him, just as Sherlock is one of the few who know John’s secret, and he is giving Sherlock a gift. He accepts. Goes along, and pretends to be something the other professors understand. </p>
<p>Wizards can perform magic; he cannot. Muggles cannot take one glance at a person and <em> know </em>them - how they live, where they’ve been, what they’ve done - but he can.</p>
<p>
  <em> They can’t imagine what we are. </em>
</p>
<p>“Sherlock,” John repeats, and he brings himself back. John lifts his eyebrows at him when he looks over, concern and a question etched just above them, and Sherlock dismisses it with a shake of his head. John is looking a bit ragged, bags under his eyes, and he recalls that tonight is a full moon. He’ll be leaving the festivities early, then.</p>
<p>They begin to make their way around the perimeter of the hall, John adjusting each portrait with his wand (hawthorn, thirteen inches, phoenix feather), Sherlock advising. “I imagine you could also use someone to accompany you this evening. Ensure you get to your saferoom, that the willow doesn't smite you. Six degrees to the left.”</p>
<p>“No, no. You’re not getting out of--”</p>
<p>“Six, not sixteen.”</p>
<p>“--not getting out of the Feast this year. You remember the stink your brother made about it last year, you and Moriarty skipping the Sorting, going off and doing...whatever it is you do, and no, I don’t want to know what that is--”</p>
<p>Distractedly, “Stargazing.”</p>
<p>“Is that what you’re calling it now?” A pause, John’s eyebrows lifting, and Sherlock studies the portrait’s angle and nods. They move on. “No, I'm on thin enough ice having to get a substitute once a month as it is, never mind missing a Sorting. I won't be an accomplice. So,” he says casually, pointedly, "I'll only have you come with if I'm in a <em>bad</em> way, understand, and only as far as the willow. The headaches do get awful. Do you know, I think I may feel one coming on."</p>
<p>Fighting a grin, Sherlock says, “Four degrees to the right. Of course only to the willow. I've an engagement later on.”</p>
<p>"Stargazing, is it?"</p>
<p>"Twelve degrees to the left."</p>
<p>"Uh-huh."</p>
<p>They did stargaze last year. Eventually.</p>
<p>High above, the ceiling ripples with gold, and a canopy of trees in brilliant fall colors shimmers into existence. Golden and silver leaves drift idly downward, neatly vanishing a few inches above each head, and Sherlock pauses mid-step and stands for a long moment, watching them fall. <em> I belong here, </em> he firmly reminds himself. <em> I belong here. </em></p>
<p>Across the hall, Jim is watching, too. His face is empty, but his eyes say <em> wonder</em>, and his hands say <em> loss</em>, and the set of his jaw says <em> anger</em>, and Sherlock aches because sometimes he half expects Jim to look back at him in the mirror.</p>
<p>As if called, Jim lowers his eyes from the enchanted ceiling to meet his. Sherlock makes no attempt at masking his own face, as it is a skill he never quite learned nor saw the point in pursuing, and Jim quietly observes on display all that he so carefully conceals. He does not drop his own mask, but he does not look away.</p>
<p>"I'll just finish by myself, then, shall I?" John calls, and as one, they turn away.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes,” Sherlock murmurs, catching up with John and focusing, fully assuming his role.</p>
<p>He is Sherlock Holmes, Wizard, and he belongs here.</p>
