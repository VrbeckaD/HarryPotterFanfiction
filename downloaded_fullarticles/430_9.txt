    <p>Let me start with this, if you enjoy Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita and are fond of Professor Severus Snape you will very much be entertained by this story. On the other hand if you are not interested in either of those two things, chances are you will not enjoy this tale. Keep this in mind before venturing any further.</p><p>This is not your average fanfic. It's not a lemon though it behaves like an outstretched one, or an erotic soap opera. This story deals with severe subjects that are not for the faint of heart. In this story you will be reading about perverse age differences including but not limited to types of pedophilia, detailed murder and gore, rape, self harm, suicide, drugs, and sexually themed violence and crime, as well as detailed adult themes like sex (both consensual and non-consensual) and even adult/minor sex among other horrible themes and situations. Basically if it's something that would warrant a trigger warning, just assume it's going to be in this story.</p><p><br/>This story does not in any way condone, glorify, or romanticize any of these themes in real life situations in any way, shape, or form. This is a work of fiction and does not reflect the view points of the author and hopefully it doesn't reflect the views of the readers. This was made out of good clean fun and as a guilty pleasure and is meant to be taken as such. The romantic relationships the main character encounters in this story are by no means meant as any form of ideal relationship or healthy relationship - actually the opposite. It's to show how unhealthy and incorrect those types of relationships are.</p><p><br/>This is an AU fanfic (as technically every fanfic is) and is expected to be treated as such. As the author I will try to do my best to stay within the known and well loved canon universe however artistic liberties will be taken and canonical characters will have their "AU personalities" shine through every now and again for the sake of the story. Regarding Snape, a beloved fan favorite, he will be as close to the original character depicted in the books and films as I can make him however as I said before, he will have a compatible though different "AU personality" that will be present through much of this story again for the sake of the fanfiction. Someone somewhere in this whole wide world is bound to be unhappy with these facts in this story but I do promise that I will do my best by the original character as this story's theme allows.</p><p><br/>On the topic of Harry Potter and the other characters of his grade and time at Hogwarts, they will not be present in this story. This tale begins before Harry Potter was even born and continues through during the time before he ever got his first Hogwarts letter. The possible sequel may include Harry and characters that come along with his era at Hogwarts but none will be present during this story including but not limited to Harry, Draco, Ron, Hermione, Luna, Cho, Neville, ext. This story is set during the 1980s and will have well known and loved characters from the books and movies that were present during that time as well as new original characters unique and custom to this story.</p><p><br/>This story is set sort of during the same time frame as the mobile app game "Harry Potter; Hogwarts Mystery" and may show resembles and clear inspiration from the stories or characters within that game. However this story was originally created back in 2010 and has been residing in my head for years now, which my friends attest that I came up with this story in some form or another even years before 2010 but I digress. Just know that sometimes there is some inspiration from the game and other times it's completely coincidental and unintentional like for one example, the time setting. It was actually while playing this game that enticed me to finally write out this story and post it online once and for all.</p><p><br/>One final warning regarding JK Rowling's established and beloved characters. This will be a controversial matter for some however for the sake of this tale some of the incarnations of original characters (including Lily and James Potter) will be altered and very different interpretations from the original works. If you take issue with these characters' personalities or story lines being changed even just slightly, you most likely will not have a pleasurable experience reading this story. If you understand that this is AU and can indeed look past established canon (even if altering established characters and story lines/subplots) and enjoy a fan created version of these characters and story lines than you will indeed have a pleasurable experience reading this story.</p><p><br/>Once more, this story is a dark and intense one. Please feel no guilt in not wishing to go further into this tale, and please by no means feel any guilt for pursuing on with a devilish smirk on your face as you click 'next chapter'.</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this and hear me out on these important topics and please enjoy this story if you wish to continue reading it.</p><p>I remain, as always, your humble author.</p><p>Â </p>
