    <p align="left">Harry steps down off the curb outside Holburn’s shiny Travelodge and growls, flipping the finger at the black cab that nearly takes him straight off of his feet. Turning the collar of his single-breasted Givenchy against the gust of wind that blows up from Shaftsbury Avenue, he tugs in a sharp breath to calm his irritation and tightens his grip on the duffel on his left shoulder.</p><p>On any other cold London morning, he would have turned in through the glittering door of the Aveda Institute and sprinted upstairs, been greeted by a disapproving glance from his boss for being thirty seconds late always and without fail, no matter how early he leaves in the morning. He’d set up at his station and make a cup of cheap coffee in the break room, because the expensive shit they sell tastes mildly like battery acid. Carly would come rushing in like a whirlwind of chaos and bash stuff over with the mass of shopping bags she accumulates before 8am. And he’d spend the day listening to the dramatic retellings of C list celebrity life as recounted straight from the horse’s sparkly white mouth. Muggle and wizarding alike.</p><p>But today, his feet take him straight past the Institute, to where a silver Range Rover is parked on the corner waiting for him.</p><p>“Ready?”</p><p>“No,” Harry huffs as he throws his duffel into the back seat and climbs in front passenger, slumping against the leather.</p><p>“You’re such a drama queen,” Hermione snorts, rolling her eyes. “Today is a big opportunity for you. You could look a little happier.”</p><p>He flashes her a maniacal grin, to which she rolls her eyes and starts the engine, a small smirk twitching at the corners of her mouth.</p><p>“Its not like I couldn’t have gotten in touch with him myself and offered to work the shoot.”</p><p>“But would your <em>pride</em> have allowed it?” Hermione remarks, and Harry refrains from answering so as not to give her the satisfaction of agreement.</p><p>She turns right onto the A400 on Tottenham Court Road, and he curls his hands in the pockets of his coat to keep from fiddling and picking at his nails.</p><p>“Do we have the sketches?”</p><p>“Hmm? Oh, yeah, they’re in the duffel. I had the rack sent over to the studio already. No doubt he’ll have shit to talk about the outfits, but he’ll have to fucking deal with it. He’s the one that pulled us in on three day’s notice wanting a full book of looks when I haven’t even seen him in over a year.”</p><p>“Okay,” Hermione sighs, turning the radio down a touch and dulling out the sarcastic drawl of Nick Grimshaw. “If you’re going to work with him on this, you have to ditch the hostility right now. Leave it at the door. I’m serious, H; he’s one of my best friends, but he’s still not the easiest personality to handle if you can’t keep your cool.”</p><p>“It’s weird that you’re friends with him,” Harry pouts, sinking further in his chair, aware he’s acting like a dejected two-year-old but not quite able to check himself.</p><p>“To you it is,” Hermione smiles warmly at him out of the corner of her eye, stopping for traffic as they hit Harrington Square Gardens. “But I’ve been his manager for eighteen months now. I had to learn to love him, otherwise I’d be miserable and so would he. And there’s no point in that.”</p><p>The rain beats on the windscreen, and Harry follows the monotonous swipe of the wipers with his eyes, wetting his chapped lips and swallowing before sitting up a bit and tugging the hairband from his hair. He gathers the top of his curls into a small bun and lets the rest fall to tendril around the curve of his neck, sniffing.</p><p>“How do I do it?”</p><p>Hermione grins and reaches over to squeeze his thigh, turning right at the High Street and pulling onto the A503 to Camden Road.</p><p>“You don’t have to be perfect right away. Just do your job. You’re damn good at it, and don’t take his shit. But… don’t lose your temper. He’ll respect you for that at least. He doesn’t like loose cannons on his ship.”</p><p>Harry bristles, nervous energy causing the radio to static and shut out. But he clamps down on the stray magic he can feel sparking around his fingertips and singeing the wool material of his pockets, gritting his teeth and breathing in through his nose.</p><p>“Its fine,” he shrugs finally, “I’m fine. It’ll be fine.”</p><p>“That’s the spirit,” she laughs softly, squeezing his thigh once more before returning her hand to the steering wheel. They hit traffic again at Finsbury Park, but once it fades, is a smoother drive along Seven Sisters Road, and before he’s had a chance to register it, they’re turning onto Markfield Road and past Rainbow Works, to The Cove Studios.</p><p>The slam of the car doors gets him up and moving properly, and they’re led to a brownstone room with wooden beams across the skylight, bathing the space in a pure pallet of brightness.</p><p>Against the back, there’s a white shooting block set up, fresh and clean and lit in a familiar way that makes Harry calm, even if it’s just for a second. It looks like the places he used to frequent for Hermione, back when she was a freelance photographer starting her career. She’d worked one job for Malfoy, the day before her twenty first birthday, and he’d hired her to his team immediately.</p><p>After just six months, Malfoy asked her to become his manager, and she’d accepted, although she still shoots for him on days like this, when it’s important and he needs someone he trusts implicitly to do the job.</p><p>Spotting Dean where he’s assembling the clothes to the left, beside a table laden with paperwork and three laptops, Harry approaches, dropping his bag to the floor to get his attention. Dean’s face floods with relief upon seeing him, and Harry winks, feeling his anxiety loosen further. This really is fine. It’s what he knows. It’s what he is good at.</p><p>“A’ight?” Harry shrugs out of his coat and hangs it on the end of the rack, pressing a comforting hand to the small of Dean’s back. He’s deliberately ignoring the bustling corner of the room where Hermione has gravitated to, not quite wanting to look at or address Malfoy before he absolutely has to.</p><p>“Okay, mate?”</p><p>“I’ve been better, but let’s get on with it, yeah?”</p><p>“Coffee on the table for you,” Dean says, and Harry presses a kiss to his temple before reaching for the steaming mug, wrapping his fingers around it to warm them and leaning back against the table, gesturing for Dean to show him their designs in the flesh.</p><p>“The suit is for this set,” Dean tells him what he already knows, sliding the bag off the hanger and unzipping it, eyes sparkling with joy.</p><p>This is their art.</p><p>They pick the colours and shapes, then they work out how they can do it, who they can buy from, or if they need to make it themselves. Because they’re on a very short schedule, they’ve spent the whole weekend in Dean and Seamus’ Soho apartment bent over sketches and looking through designers on the internet. Hermione had gotten fed up with them ringing her every ten minutes, and flooed through to tell them she was transferring a shit tonne of cash from the Malfoy account so they could just do whatever they needed to make the shoot happen.</p><p>Seamus had provided them with an endless supply of caffeine, fast food, and snapchatted them arguing over fabrics whilst shoving pringles in his gob and laughing at them.</p><p>“Okay,” Harry says, letting go of his coffee where it remains hovering in the air and stepping forward, taking the suit from Dean.</p><p>It’s beautiful.</p><p>Tailoured to fit Malfoy like a glove, it’s a heritage jacket embroidered at the breast with Dragons, with a notched collar, wide and sharp pointed lapels, and made with a black wool-mohair blend. Matched to black, straight leg trousers, and leather loafers branded with signature GG web buckle. Dynamic, different, but sleek and acute.</p><p>“Okay, this is fucking amazing.”</p><p>“We did good, didn’t we?”</p><p>“We did,” Harry feels quite cocky as he nods to himself, tugging in a long, deep breath through his nose and patting Dean on the shoulder. “Alright, into the snake pit.”</p><p>“Good luck. I’ll hold the fort.”</p><p>Harry swallows and waves for his coffee to float beside him as he grabs his bag again and takes the suit with him, feeling his stomach do an antsy somersault when he claps eyes on the back of a very blonde head of longer hair than he was expecting.</p><p>“Lads,” Harry greets the ensemble around Malfoy, all people he’s worked with before, people who are regulars at the institute and sit in his chair once or twice a month. He’s received warmly, with bright smiles and hugs and pats to the shoulder. Hermione is still stood near the mirror, talking on the phone, although she’s dressed down today, in high waisted jeans, shiny YSL Chelsea’s, and an oversized jumper. Harry feels like the seconds leading up to coming face to face with Malfoy are ticking away sluggishly, but too fast at the same time.</p><p>“Harry, do you have a – ah, thank you,” Hermione says as he hands her a hairband from his wrist before she’s even finished her request, and he finally enters the bubble surrounding the centre pull of the room.</p><p>“Potter.”</p><p>“Malfoy,” Harry says, attempting to keep his tone neutral. He drops his bag on the floor again, beside the stool Malfoy is settled in, and levitates his coffee to sit on the desk in front of them. “How goes?”</p><p>“Not too shoddy,” Malfoy replies, an almost bored expression on his face. He hasn’t really changed in the past year and a half since Harry last saw him.</p><p>His eyes are still that focused, eerily calm crystal blue; both striking and alarming. A steel clad, calculating gaze that flicks about, taking far more information in than the length of the look suggests. As ever, it says ‘you’re not important enough for me to dwell on’, but also ‘I have noted you; please don’t make the mistake of thinking I don’t know you’re there and will tear your head from your shoulders if you so much as think about hurting me.’</p><p>His lips are still that pale pink colour, soft and rounded but not plump, his nose still long and ruler straight, but fits his face better than it did as a teenager, his cheekbones still narrow and sharp, prominent but fuller than they were; Hermione has mentioned assigning a dietician to get him to eat more. He’d been extraordinarily thin when she had basically started running his life. Forcing him to give up unhealthy starving habits had apparently been a long and rocky road, particularly keeping the issue out of the wizarding press.</p><p>But his hair, which Harry has the delightfully awkward job of styling alongside his wardrobe for this photoshoot, has clearly not been cut in at least a few months. Highly uncharacteristic of Malfoy’s extensive cosmetic routine, and slightly disorienting as Harry retrieves his kit and unfurls it.</p><p>“This is the cover shot,” Hermione tells him as she takes a clipboard from a random crew member and signs on a few dotted lines. “With the suit. So, let’s go professional and smart.”</p><p>“Quiffed,” Harry nods to her, absently sipping from his drink and attempting to cover his surprise. “Not too much product though. I have a spell to keep it in place.”</p><p>“Is this spell exclusive to everyone but yourself?” Malfoy drawls, and Harry goes to snap out a reply, but bites his tongue when he catches the amused, teasing glint in his expression, peaking through the determined stillness. It’s not malicious; it’s meant to break the ice. Which is so fucking ironic Harry struggles to believe it’s actually happening.</p><p>“Hermione likes my curls,” Harry announces, allowing room for the nudging of banter. “Don’t you, Hermione?”</p><p>“They’re adorable,” she smiles, clearly very happy that they haven’t burnt the building down in a duel yet, pinching at his dimple and causing him to blush slightly. He narrows his eyebrows and clears his throat, batting her away. He gets to work, trying to deal with the absurdity of the situation without making it weird; thinking he might have stepped into an alternate universe where it’s perfectly normal and commonplace for him to have his <em>fingers</em> in <em>Draco Malfoy’s hair</em>.</p><p>Its silky and soft and Harry tries very, very hard not to make eye contact with him in the mirror as he swallows down on the strange feeling in his gut. The fitters hang the suit up and it makes it easier that whilst he works, Malfoy is also working; confirming appointments, talking in a low, assured tone with Hermione. She’s arranging different consultations, meetings, and interviews for him.</p><p>Slowly, Harry starts sculpting it into place, brushing it up and slightly to the left on top of his head, making the decision to keep it a bit loose, allowing a stray strand to fall over his forehead. As he works, the studio starts to warm up as the large lighting equipment gets assembled and moved around, Hermione finally leaving to get behind the cameras.</p><p>She returns just before Harry is almost done, and takes a quick picture of the two of them when Harry is bent over his shoulder, observing a final check in the mirror.</p><p>“What-”</p><p>“For social media,” Hermione says. “BTS insights are important. It’ll go on the magazine’s website and most likely be printed in the issue.”</p><p>“You don’t think that’ll be a PR nightmare?” Malfoy raises his eyebrows, although he still looks frustratingly calm. Its maddening, and Harry almost wants to cause an argument.</p><p>“I think it will be a PR orgasm,” she says, when Harry is in mid swallow of his drink, and he coughs, spluttering and struggling to catch his breath. Malfoy and Hermione are fucking smirking at each other, the little shites, and Harry has never been so uncomfortable. His palms are sweating, so he simply glares, and packs his stuff up, holding both of his middle fingers up to them as he leaves.</p><p>They’re not too busy whilst Hermione is doing her work. Occasionally, Harry or Dean step in to adjust the way the fabric falls on Malfoy’s body, which is just as surreal as styling his hair, but after the first hour, it becomes almost like any other job. Mechanical, instinctive.</p><p>And Malfoy is a natural.</p><p>Standing in all the right positions, hands in pockets, long legs bent at the knee now and again. Sometimes he curls his fingers around the lapels of his jacket and tugs it forward, and Hermione makes a sound of approval, a smile curving her mouth. They’re eerily fantastic together, Harry notes, the most unlikely duo, but they seem to just <em>know</em> each other. And more and more, Harry realises the look in Malfoy’s eyes when he addresses her, is respect. Unwavering, quiet, unconditional respect.</p><p>Its disjointing.</p><p>Harry has successfully managed to somehow avoid having to spend any social time around Malfoy since Hermione aligned herself with him; he’s become expert at faking headaches when he’s invited to parties Malfoy is attending and has been blessed in the fact that Malfoy never comes to the institute.</p><p>Before he knows it, they’re done with the first part of the shoot, and in seconds, they get Malfoy out of the suit and back in a plane white t-shirt ready for hair and make-up again. Harry doesn’t need direction this time, as they move everything downstairs to an elegantly lit, minimalist kitchen, the dark of the brick walls contrasting warmly with the golden glow of the tiny lights dotted around and shining out of them, glinting of the white surface of the island in the middle.</p><p>Brushing the spray out of Malfoy’s hair and dropping the spells, he takes all of two seconds to decide to leave it limp and natural, styling a side parting and running his hand through it a couple of times to make it look mildly mussed.</p><p>Dean brings over the Gucci jumper they’ve picked out for this one; yellow with blue and red piping on the sleeves, and ‘Blind for love’ knitted in red across the front. They’ve paired it with GG jacquard jogging bottoms in dark blue and red, with white piping and red and white ribbed ankle trim. They get him to take his socks off, which he isn’t happy about, and Harry only just resists the urge to tease him about his long, bony toes.</p><p>Hermione takes some photos of him making coffee, eating cereal, sat up on the countertops with his legs dangling over them. Harry doesn’t have a favourite shot because he’s indifferent to every aspect of Malfoy’s appearance, of course.</p><p>But if he did, it would be one from the next costume change.</p><p>They put him in a Rainbow Gucci Hollywood jumper, oversized so the sleeves fall over his hands, and match it with a pair of black, relaxed fit, flared polyester joggers, piped with the famous green and red Gucci stripes. Hermione gets him to lay across the red leather sofa, and there’s a still where the soft golden light casts a certain shadow across his cheekbones and makes his skin look an almost healthy shade for the first time ever. He looks simultaneously sharp and soft, the casual nature of his clothes humanising the ever-present aristocracy that gives him a constant air of power.</p><p>Its excellent work on Hermione’s part, and Harry tells her so, whilst Malfoy looks mildly offended at the implication that it has nothing to do with his own natural beauty.</p><p>The rest of the day goes fairly smoothly. So smoothly, in fact, Harry is very nearly lulled into a false sense of security. That is, until it’s time to pack up and leave. Malfoy makes his way over to where Harry and Dean are placing the clothes safely into a large suitcase.</p><p>“Thomas,” Malfoy says, looking strung out and sleepy, although no less stoic. “Apologies for our lack of interaction today. It has been busy.”</p><p>“Oh,” Dean says, looking like a dear caught in the headlights as he stands up from his crouched position and coughs awkwardly. “Uh… right, no worries. Understandable. Did we um – did we do okay?”</p><p>“Satisfactory.”</p><p>“More than satisfactory,” Harry can’t stop himself from cutting in, a little frustrated. They have done a fantastic job, on short notice, with barely anything to work with.</p><p>“I meant no disrespect.”</p><p>“Of course,” Harry says blandly, wetting his lips and shrugging, forcing his jaw not to tense up as he tugs the hairband out and scratches at his own scalp to try and loosen the ache starting up behind his eye sockets. “You never do.”</p><p>“Potter,” Malfoy replies, lifting his chin a touch, shifting his posture more rigidly and making direct eye contact. Harry bristles, despising the way he says his name even now, after so long. “Is there a problem?”</p><p>“No, none.”</p><p>“I assure you, you will be paid for your troubles.”</p><p>“Right,” Harry grits his teeth, nostrils flaring. “That’s all that matters.”</p><p>Malfoy blinks, swallows tightly, sharp jawline moving with the motion. He tucks his other hand into the pocket of his trousers and nods once, phlegmatically, pursing his lips.</p><p>“I can see it’s been a long day for everyone. There’s a driver outside waiting to take you both home. I’ll… thank you, for your work today. If there’s any issues regarding your cheques, please talk to Hermione and she’ll get it sorted. Gents.”</p><p>Malfoy nods again, and bows himself out of the conversation, rattling Harry further. It’s too much. The atmosphere feels too taut and abstemious; like there’s a storm whirling beneath a pristine, bulletproof glass flooring and no matter how much Harry stomps his feet, it won’t smash and let him breathe.</p><p>“Merlin, H, snap out of it. What’s got your thongs in a twist?”</p><p>Harry rubs at itchy, dry eyes and shakes his head, shrugging into his trench and bending to lift their bagged equipment.</p><p>“Nothing,” Harry says in an awful attempt at lying. “Best not keep those chaps waiting in the car, yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Dean snorts, a knowing look on his face. “Let’s not.”</p>
