Snape wondered if his life could get any worse, he truly did wonder. First, he ends up pregnant. Now, the Dark Lord himself has forced Severus to attend a stupid bloody meeting. What would happen next? Would his father appear as will? Mentally destroy him more than Lucius could? Tobias was capable of leaving Severus a sobbing wreck, and he wouldn't put it past his father to degrade him publicly anyway. It's not like anyone would stop him. Certainly not Lucius. Oh, <em>definitely</em> not Lucius.</p><p><br/>
<em>Lucius</em>. The word was like rotten flesh within Severus' mouth, the idea of Lucius at the moment made him want to shiver in fear and anger and every emotion that filled his being but he couldn't hideaway, no. He had to face the Dark Lord.</p><p><br/>
Severus arrived at the Riddle Manor five minutes early and began to pace within the garden. He thumbed into his pocket and drew out a packet of cigarettes. The sour smoke would calm his nerves and help him distress, or at least it would have if a nosey little Rabastan hadn't found him. The bloke was around twenty-one, two years older than Severus, and quite attractive, much like his older sibling. They both had amazing red-hair. Not like Lilys', their hair was blood red, a deep crimson colour. Rabastan was growing his hair out, currently. His ever-growing scarlet hair was braided over his shoulder, just like the elder Lestrange had done. His eyes were a contrast to the locks that flowed from Rabastabs head, they were a piercing midnight black. The eyes of a true killer. Severus could <em>never</em> look the Lestrange's in the eyes, they scared him too much. He put a sneer on and scoffed at the pureblood. "And what do I owe the pleasure of this meeting too?" his voice throbbed with sarcasm, masking his fear.</p><p><br/>
"You shouldn't be smoking, it could harm the little Malfoy within you." He purred, each silky word leaving his pale lips as cool as ice. His mouth curled into a sickeningly sweet smile. That mouth had probably done some vile things, and probably to Rodolphus. Severus wouldn't be surprised if they did, or had, fucked, and he didn't care either. But it was hard to deny, they had always been touching, holding, hugging, kissing each other... He shuddered at the thought of brother on brother action, especially between those two horrid brutes... Severus wondered how a little fucker like Rab knew. Panic began to grow in him yet quickly died as Severus drew another large breath of smoke into himself. The trickling cloud left his mouth and flew into the pale face of Rabastan. The older wizard coughed, sneered, and began to stalk away. Severus tossed him off once his back was turned and focused more on how to wiggle out of this situation.</p><p><br/>
Severus finished his fag and headed inside with a grumble. He pushed the towering oak doors open and slipped inside the dimly lit room. Voldemort was standing at the window, back to the small group of people behind him. Severus' eyes darted around each person, heart-shattering. Lucius was here. His face was calm but Severus could practically feel the storm brewing under that pale poker face and grey eyes. By his side was Narcissa, her cheek a plum shade of purple, light eyes glued to the floor, not daring one inch to look at anyone within the room. Only for a second did they flicker to Severus, but the weak gaze was gone the moment it had happened. Opposite the happy couple was Bellatrix. Severus could see the start of a similar bruise to Narcissa's just under Bellatrix's robes' collar, but her head was held high and crazy eyes forward, lips curled into a grin. What the fuck does she have to grin about?</p><p><br/>
"Greetings, young one," Voldemort said, turning to face Severus. He grinned darkly, eyes a piercing red. Severus had only met him twice; once when he was sixteen, getting that horrid blog of ink burnt within his arm, the second time being when he 'awarded' Lucius with him. Severus felt the familiar anger at the memory; He wasn't a thing to be traded off! He was a fucking person, smarter and cunning than Lucius or Bellatrix or anyone else here! He bit his tongue and slowly bowed, raven hair fallen beside his face and hiding his expression from the others. "M'lord."</p><p><br/>
"It seems you are carrying the child of Lucius Malfoy, yes?" He said quietly, voice a murmur of its power, yet it still made all the mortals around the Dark Lord shudder.</p><p><br/>
Severus gulped, swallowing hard. He nodded and looked up at his new lord and master. "I am, My Lord. I was going to get rid of it on Lucius' orders. But then I was summoned. May I ask how you found out, My Lord?"</p><p><br/>
"Narcissa seems to have the tongue of a gossiper, and so does her sister." Voldemort let a gentle sigh escape his melting, ivory lips. He turned and strolled over towards the young boy in front of him, the clicking of his shoes on the ground echoed throughout the meeting room. Severus couldn't help but tense as Voldemort approached. His claw-like fingers gently landed upon Severus' cheek, the thumb gently ghosting over Severus' wobbling bottom lip. Voldemort lifted the teens head and looked into his eyes. Severus swore he heard Voldemort say something, but for the life of him, he didn't know what!</p><p><br/>
But the moment the words were spoken, Severus felt naked. Exposed. Someone, something, was prodding at his mind, eating at his thoughts, swirling through his maze of a brain. His breath got caught in his throat, and his eyes slowly fluttered shut. For a moment, he was still. He was quiet. He was nothing, nothing but a shell. A hard, yet strong, yet chilling, voice dragged him back into his body, back into the horrid world around him. He didn't dare open his eyes.</p><p><br/>
"He wants the child." The silence that followed was tense, the anger radiating from the blonde pureblooded man was so strong that you could practically feel its horrid, spiteful energy. Voldemort spoke again, removing his hand from the pale cheek."He'll keep it, it can be raised as another Malfoy seen as Narcissa is barren." He turned, cloak fluttering behind him, and strolled back over towards his lonely spot beside the window. The Dark Lord waved his hand dismissively. "You may leave, take the boy home. Make sure the baby and boy live through to the birth."</p><p><br/>
Bellatrix was the first to leave, that sinister smirk never weakening on her rosy red lips. Following behind her was the merry couple! Narcissa murmured quietly, something Severus couldn't hear. He didn't even know if it was directed to him or Lucius, but he paid it no attention. He joined the trail of death eaters and followed out the door.</p><p> </p><p align="center">-----</p><p> </p><p>The door shut, and the storm was set free. Bellatrix left as if she didn't even notice when Lucius' cane meet with the side of Severus' head. The wood stung like Merlin's arse over a hot, coal fire and made Severus yelp, sounding like a punished puppy. He stumbled back, almost falling, if it wasn't for Narcissa who soon had her thin arms wrapped around his body and holding him close. It took Severus a minute to realise blood trickled down from the side of his head, the skin split open into a long, wiggly line that the crimson liquid began to ooze out of. His ears rung, and for a moment, just to his terror, he saw double of everything. Two Cissys, two elves, and even two of Lucius. He was hunched there, frozen, hands gripping into Narcissa's robes as if his life depended on him clinging to her. Their mouths moved, Lucius' in an angry fashion as he waved his hands about in a distraught manner, hair flicking one way or another as he turned. His pale face was turning redder and redder with each word that left his lips. Narcissa was the opposite, she was cowering but still holding onto Severus, her body in between his and Lucius, defending the sour teen. All the while, the world was silent to Snape. Their words didn't make any noise but a slight murmur, the only thing his ears were picking up was the sound of a bell, ringing high-pitched, blocking out any other sound until suddenly, like a wave crashing into a tiny lighthouse, sound returned.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa's voice was the first to reach his ears. "-Your fault we are even in this idiotic situation, he's a boy! A child!"<br/>
<br/>
"He's <em>worthless</em>, he's <em>pathetic</em> and the reason some little maggot will be living in this world within <em>Merlin knows</em> how many months! Our names will be shamed-!"<br/>
<br/>
"-who cares about our names? We will have a son, and you an heir-!"<br/>
<br/>
"-an heir of a half-blood fuck toy!" Lucius spat and was gone with a horrid crack.</p><p> </p><p>Snape didn't realise he was trembling until a soothing hand was placed on his cheek. His dark, midnight eyes looked up into Narcissas' pretty little orbs, and he calmed. A soft sigh left her lips as she touched gently at his blood-soaked hair. "Oh, Severus, what have you done? Let's get you cleaned up."</p>
