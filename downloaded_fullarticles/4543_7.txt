    <p>The bushy head of hair dove behind a bookshelf, but it was too late. Theo growled, beyond frustrated with the Gryffindor.</p><p>"<em>Granger</em>," He hissed, snatching her arm. He ignored her protests, dragging her determinedly towards the back corner that they usually occupied.</p><p>"Let me go Nott," She mumbled. "If I wanted company, I obviously wouldn't have been hiding."</p><p>Theodore let out an angry snort. He pulled on her arm until she was looking at him, her amber eyes glaring half-heartedly at him. He shook his head, tossing her into her chair without bothering to respond.</p><p>"I'm serious!" Granger whispered.</p><p>Theo began pulling his notes from his bag, spreading them across the table as he usually did.</p><p>The witch seemed to grow upset as he continued to ignore her. "Fine. Don't answer me. I don't know why I thought you would care what I wanted."</p><p>Theodore leapt out of his chair as she pushed away from the table and turned to leave. He grabbed her wrist yet again.</p><p>"Granger. Come on. If I didn't care, I wouldn't have spent my Saturday combing the library looking for a <em>Gryffindor</em>."</p><p>She didn't turn around, but he could see how her shoulders were shaking. He sighed.</p><p>"Weasley is an idiot. And Brown's about as dull as her name," He told Granger honestly. He was relieved to hear her let out a watery chuckle, and quickly continued speaking. "I'm being honest. She's got the personality of a wet towel."</p><p>The brunette finally turned to look at him, wiping the tears from face as she spoke. "Lavender's a nice girl. And Ronald obviously likes her. I'm quite happy for them."</p><p>Theo rolled his eyes. "Yes, and I'm a Hufflepuff. Bugger off with that nonsense."</p><p>She frowned at him, her lips pouting slightly. "I'm telling the truth."</p><p>He didn't think that warranted a response. His unimpressed look must have said as much, for the girl soon resumed talking.</p><p>"Fine. I'm bitter and angry, and I want to light Lavender's bedposts on fire. Happy now?"</p><p>He smirked. "Very much so. The Gryffindor Princess has a dark side after all. Who would have thought?"</p><p>"Wha-no..." She stuttered.</p><p>He waited until she had turned properly red before he continued speaking. "Don't worry Granger, I won't tell anyone your secret. Now come on, I need your genius to bounce ideas off of. Problem three is impossible, and everyone else in our class are idiots."</p><p>She sat back down, but he could see something was still bothering her. He sighed, knowing she wouldn't be of any use while she was still upset.</p><p>"Granger," He whinged, drawing out the last 'r'. She looked down. "He'll come around, though I don't see why you're so upset. He's a complete dud."</p><p>Her lips twitched slightly, and he took that as the okay to continue.</p><p>"He eats with his mouth open."</p><p>A slight smile.</p><p>"He's about as intelligent as a troll."</p><p>He earned a muffled giggle.</p><p>"He's too lanky."</p><p>She outright laughed at that, and he knew that one was a bit hypocritical.</p><p>"Plus, he's a ginger!" He cried with mock outrage. Her shoulders were shaking with laughter. "Honestly Granger, he's not worth your time or tears."</p><p>When she looked up, her eyes were glittering with mischief. "Don't you mean...<em>nott</em> worth my time?"</p><p>"Granger <em>no</em>," He groaned, letting his head drop into his hands as she howled with laughter. "What a horrible, unoriginal pun. Honestly, I'm ashamed."</p><p>He peeked up at the girl. Her mouth was open, but no sound came out; she was laughing so hard.</p><p>Theo smiled slightly.</p><p>He had his Arithmancy partner back.</p>
