    <p>What came back first was Harry’s consciousness. For a split second, he thought that maybe he was dead. What proved him wrong, however, was the tingling sensation throughout his body. Death didn’t feel like that the first time. On the other hand, time also felt just as odd then as it did now.</p><p>What came back next was the pain. Excruciating pain. He felt like there were ants trapped in the middles of his bones, his skin felt like each crevice contained a pool of molten lava, and the hair on his skin felt like wasp stings. </p><p>But the worst of it was his head. He felt pressure building up so quickly in his head he was surprised it hadn’t exploded yet. He could feel every heartbeat pound against his skull.</p><p>Finally, what came next was his hearing, or at least the voices. It was hushed but urgent whispers. His head was pounding too loud to focus on them, but at least he wasn’t alone. </p><p>Someone grabbed his hand, held it tightly, like a lifeline. He tried to grip it back, but nothing was responding. His eyes wouldn’t even open. The pain was taking over, he could feel it. Everything started to get a bit lighter.</p><p>Then he was out, again.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p>The next time he woke up, the pain was just a low thrum under his skin. He willed his eyes to open, and they did, but slowly. The bright walls of St Mungo’s greeted him with a smile. The ceiling was as dull and as disinterested as ever.</p><p>He tried to move his head to look down. It took a few attempts, but finally he moved. His eyes slowly moved onto the person clutching his right hand, holding it like it meant everything to him. Harry moved his hand slowly and carefully out from his grip, but alas, the man woke up.</p><p>In Harry’s blurry vision, he watched as the man’s head shot up. The slightly fuzzy light blond hair and slim figure seemed very familiar to him. Harry tried not to scream when he realised it was Draco Malfoy. Out of everyone to be by his bedside, he didn’t quite expect him.</p><p>Harry’s arm slowly patted the table next to him until he felt the frames of his glasses underneath. He carefully and slowly put them on his head. Everything cleared up. He looked at Malfoy again, watching him as he blinked himself awake.</p><p>Harry’s eyes searched Malfoy as he was waking up. His light blonde hair was ruffled on the side he slept on, poking all sorts of directions. His face was sunken in, and there dark eyebags. But what caught his attention was his clothes. </p><p>Draco Malfoy was wearing a Molly Weasley made Christmas sweater.</p><p>Malfoy’s head turned so fast, Harry thought it might end up on the floor. Before he could even laugh at the thought, he was engulfed in a tight embrace. Harry, mind racing and still very confused by all the information he was given, patted Malfoy’s back three times and pulled away. </p><p>“Harry, you’re okay. Thank, Merlin, you’re okay.” Malfoy smiled so brightly, and it took off years from his face. Then it turned icey and accusing. “Potter, you idiot. You scared the shit out of me! I’d have half a mind to slap you to oblivion.” </p><p>Harry’s eyebrows raised into his hairline. He opened his mouth to respond, but found his throat was incredibly dry. </p><p>Malfoy noticed, and conjured a glass and cast a simple augementi. He offered the glass to Harry, who took it gratefully. He nodded his thanks.</p><p>“I’ll go find your healer. Stay here, don’t move.” Malfoy walked to the door, giving a glare that felt the same, but very very different.</p><p>Harry sipped the water slowly, trying out his voice in between. The silence from his mouth turned into a whisper, and that turned into a croak, which turned into his voice with a considerably large amount of cracks. He wondered how long he was out for if his throat was that bad. </p><p><em> It was probably just for a few days, </em> he thought.</p><p>Malfoy came back, a healer right on his heels. “I just contacted Ron and Hermione too, they’ll be here soon.” </p><p>Malfoy sat down in the seat beside Harry’s bed as the healer ran diagnostics first. This part was his least favourite. The spells would constantly wash over Harry, making him feel like he was in a bubble that kept bursting, yet never went away. Worst of all, he couldn’t speak during the cast.</p><p>A few minutes into the diagnostics, Ron and Hermione came rushing in. Concern and worry on their faces. For the first time since he woke, Harry realised they all looked slightly different. Older. More mature. It was probably nothing, but Harry felt that discomfort in the bottom of his stomach.</p><p>There was already so much information thrown in his face that when Hermione ran and <em> hugged </em> Malfoy and Ron put a comforting hand on Malfoy’s shoulder, he couldn’t help but squeak. </p><p>The bubble of magic around him disappeared, but he kept staring at his friend and school rival in shock. He didn’t even hear the questions his healer asked as he just kept staring at the three in confusion.</p><p>“Harry Potter?” The healer's voice finally came through. </p><p>“Sorry,” His voice was hoarse. Clearing his throat, he tried again. “Sorry, I was distracted.” Slightly better. “What were you asking?” He turned to face the healer.</p><p>She must’ve been new because he has never seen her before in St Mungo’s. Merlin knows how many times he’s been here since the auror job. </p><p>Speaking of, he sneaks a glance to Ron in his auror robes. It was filled with tatters and patches, like it was repaired too often to hold with magic anymore. Which was weird because they only bought the new auror robes a year ago.</p><p>“How are you feeling?” The healer asked. </p><p>“I’m alright, I guess. At least, much better than before. Thank you…” He trailed off, raising the final note in a question for her name.</p><p>The healer’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion. “Tina. I’m healer Tina.” She scribbled some notes onto her papers as Harry tried not to look at Hermione who gasped softly.</p><p>“How long was I out?” Harry asked, feeling the pit in his stomach slowly grow.</p><p>“About three weeks. 20 days to be exact.” </p><p>Harry’s eyes widened at the news. <em> Three weeks? That can’t be right.  </em></p><p>Healer Tina looked to the trio beside Harry. She put on a smile, and gently asked them to leave the room. After a moment’s hesitation, they left. None of this eased Harry’s dread.</p><p>“Harry, I’m going to ask you a few questions okay? Answer as honestly as you can, and if you’re not sure about anything just tell me. Will that be okay?” </p><p>Harry nodded, trying to swallow down the fear he could feel bubbling up.</p><p>“How old are you?” She started.</p><p>“20.” </p><p>“When’s your birthday?”</p><p>“July 31st, 1980.”</p><p>“What was the last thing you remember?”</p><p>Harry closed his eyes to think. It was just blurry colours and noise, layers of shouts and then blackness. Before that was lunch with Ron and Hermione to celebrate Hermione being Minister for Magic so quickly. He told healer Tina about it.</p><p>Tina was a good healer, Harry decided. She didn’t give anything away from her face and didn’t treat him differently. </p><p>“Can I just cast one more diagnostic charm on your head? It’ll be quick, I’ll just check for any residual magic that isn’t your own.”</p><p>Harry sighed, then nodded.</p><p>The spell didn’t last more than a minute which Harry was eternally grateful for. He watched as Tina wrote studiously on the papers in her clipboard. When she finished, she looked back to Harry and sat down on the spare seat. </p><p>She kept eye-level with him, and the pit that was forming in Harry’s gut became bigger. And as Tina told Harry what had happened to him, the pit grew so big he found himself falling into it.</p><p>Tina conjured a bag before even Harry knew he was going to vomit. Nothing but the water came up, and he was dry heaving for much too long.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p><em> 5 years </em>. </p><p>5 years gone, disappeared, obliviated. </p><p>After comforting Harry and making sure his dry heaving didn’t cause any additional pain, Tina went outside to give him time. Just outside the door, he heard gasps, sobs, and then a very quiet, barely audible “no.” Harry understood. That’s exactly what he wanted to do too.</p><p>Ron and Hermione rushed in almost immediately after Harry heard Tina’s heels echo down the hallway. Ron with red-rimmed eyes, and Hermione a face that changed emotions every second. </p><p>“Oh, Harry.” She said, moving to hug him tightly. </p><p>“Is it true?” Ron asked, voice dripping with fear and a hint of hope.</p><p>“Apparently I’m not 20 years old, and the lunch we had to celebrate Hermione’s rise to Minister of Magic wasn’t yesterday.”</p><p>The silence grew, but it was bearable with his friends here. Soon, Ron asked, “How old do you feel?”</p><p>“Right now? About 90 years, give or take a good few thousand.”</p><p>That made the room a little lighter, and they all started to talk about whatever they could without revealing too much.</p><p>Throughout their visit, Harry wondered if Malfoy was going to come in at some point, but as time went on, he never reappeared. Harry wondered aloud why Malfoy was in the room, a few hours later. He noted the grim faces on Ron and Hermione’s faces as they tried to change the subject.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p>After a long talk with Ron and Tina, Harry decided to try getting the memories himself. Apparently, the clash of spells that hit him during his apparent last auror raid was Obliviate, Confundus, and Stupefy. The shield that he threw up wasn’t strong enough. So, added onto the onslaught of spells, he flew back and hit his head hard against the brick wall.</p><p>The memories stayed hidden. Even with confused healers performing the spell that counter Obliviate, nothing came. The Obliviate took his memories, but the hit on the head ensured they stayed gone. He’d have to try and get them back another way. </p><p>Harry had to stay in St Mungo’s for a few weeks longer. His days were filled with spells and diagnostic charms that it all started to meld together. All Tina could do was watch over him and wait for any memories to come through while he was hospitalised.</p><p>He was growing increasingly impatient.</p><p>Feeling better, heaps better than 3 weeks ago when he woke up, he just wanted to go home. But where was home? Where did he live? Was it still at Grimmauld place or did he move out? He’d been thinking of moving out for a while, but that was 5 years ago. So much could have happened since.</p><p>Thinking took too much energy. The hammering in his skull only grew louder whenever he had enough time to think about everything that could’ve changed, everything that he had missed. Were the glasses beside him the same ones? Is his favourite mug still there at home, waiting to be used? Hell, is it even his favourite mug anymore? These thoughts, once entered, never left until he slept, too exhausted by it all.</p><p>One day, Tina told him he was lucky to be alive. Harry thought for one scary moment that maybe that would’ve been for the better. But when Ron and Hermione came in, holding 4 cups of hot coffee, and determined smiles on their faces, the thought crushed itself.</p><p>Hermione, bless her, had started reading into muggle biology textbooks about memory loss and bringing it back. She suggested visiting places he’s been too before with other people, or simply just talking to the people he cared about. Ron smiled at her, and rolled his eyes as he did when Hermione started her neverending information talk. </p><p>Harry’s heart ached at the sight. </p><p>Did he have a lover? How many did he have in that time? Is he in a relationship now? And the question started swirling in his mind, his body sinking into his chest like his heart had stronger gravity. Hermione’s words went through one ear and out the other as he started to descend into disaster.</p><p>Malfoy never came back after the day Harry first woke up. He started to think maybe he hallucinated him ever being there. But asking about Malfoy made Ron, Hermione, and Tina change the subject almost immediately. It wasn’t like he <em> hated </em>Malfoy these days, Harry was just wondering. Still, he never asked again.</p><p>But sometimes, when he’s tossing and turning in his sleep, trying to calm the pain that kept him sleeping too lightly, he feels someone hold his hand. And while his mind screams in confusion, his body fights a little harder against the pain. As always, when he’s fully awake, they’re gone.</p><p>There were 3 days left until Harry would be able to leave. The bed has become suffocating, the white walls seemed to chip away at his sanity, and the people coming in and out of that door were all the same. The only ones he was able to distinguish were the 3 he ever talked to properly.</p><p>He put down today’s Daily Prophet newspaper with ferociousness. Frustration tingling in his fingertips, but held back with taught control. It wasn’t as bad as it could have been. </p><p>The knowledge that Harry Potter had lost his memory was still kept under wraps, known only by Tina, Ron, Hermione, and presumably Malfoy. ‘The Boy Who Lived Once Again: Immortal?’ was one of the worst articles he’d ever read. </p><p>You’d think for someone who’s died before wouldn’t be thought as immortal, yet here were the conspiracy theories.</p><p>Grabbing his wand, given back to him at some point by a faceless person, he cast an Incendio, and watched as each printed sentence burned. There were still a million copies, but at least it wasn’t in the same room as him anymore.</p><p>Right on time, Hermione and Ron walked through the door. Harry smiled at them, thankful for a distraction, but worry was written all over their faces.</p><p>He felt his smile slowly leave.</p><p>“Is everything okay?” </p><p>Hermione sat on the seat beside his bed as Ron threw up a Muffliato. Harry’s eyebrow raised, but he didn’t ask any questions. The couple gave each other an encouraging nod before turning back to Harry.</p><p>“You’re going to be released in 3 days, Harry.” Hermione started.</p><p>“I know, isn’t it great? I’ll finally be out of here.” He smiled a little too much to be considered genuine.</p><p>“It is! Don’t get us wrong, we’re so happy for you and the rate of your recovery since but…” Hermione trailed off, and glanced at Ron for support.</p><p>Ron sighed before he continued. “Harry, for the past 5 or so years, you haven’t lived in Grimmauld Place anymore.” He paused to let Harry process.</p><p>Harry blinked and tilted his head, then a half smile pulled at his lips. “Okay… I’ve wanted to move out for a while.” Then a thought popped into his head. “But… That’s not all, is it?”</p><p>They both shook their heads. “Harry… You don’t live alone.” </p><p>Before Ron could continue, Harry’s questions flew out of his mouth. “Do I have a partner? Why haven’t they seen me yet? Are they okay? Who is it? Are they okay?” His chest ached and he rubbed his fist against it, trying to relieve some of the pain.</p><p>“Yes, you do have a partner. And… They have seen you, though most of the time you were asleep.” Hermione started slowly. </p><p>“They’re okay. Well, as okay as they can be.” Ron sat at the foot of Harry’s bed. “You have to understand that we’ve told them about your memory loss. And it’s been really hard.” </p><p>Harry couldn’t believe it. He could not believe it. Not only had he forgotten his partner, but his memory loss had taken a toll on someone he cared so deeply for. His mind was racing, and his heart was hurting, yearning for something he didn’t even remember.</p><p>“Who is it? Who am I living with?” Harry asked as the silence grew too long and his thoughts grew too loud. His friends flinched slightly at the intensity in his voice.</p><p>Hermione reached out and held his hand, squeezing it reassuringly. It was nice, but something was off about it. It didn’t feel right. It didn’t feel like it does in his dreams.</p><p>“Harry, it’s Draco Malfoy.” She whispered.</p><p>Harry expected time to stop when those words bounced upon his eardrums. If not that, then at least for something to stop, whether it be his racing mind or his pounding heart, but nothing did. Nothing stopped.</p><p>Gathering that maybe, this time, he was okay, he opened his mouth to speak. It was only when his breath formed a bubble in his throat that he realised what it all meant. Just the depth to how much he’s lost, and how much he has to regain.</p><p>“Draco…” He cleared his throat. And again. Three times for good measure. “Draco Malfoy.” </p><p>He retreated his hand from Hermione and moved his legs away from Ron. It was so snake-like, coiling into himself. Hugging himself like the scared kid he was in the cupboard all those years ago. </p><p>“How long?” It was barely a whisper. </p><p>“About 3 years, give or take.” Ron stood up, moving away from Harry, giving him space. </p><p>“That's why he was here when I first woke up…” He said more to himself.</p><p>Harry clenched his eyes shut, trying so hard to remember something. Anything. Please. But nothing came but the history the two shared in Hogwarts. Nothing but the cold communication during his trials. Nothing but snide remarks and petty fighting in 8th year. Nothing. Nothing that could somehow twist into affection for Malfoy.</p><p>“Why don’t I remember?” His voice was sharp and accusing. It was all directed to himself. “Damn it, Harry. Remember <em> something. </em>” </p><p>He remembered things even further back, before the calm of 8th year. Malfoy on the floor dotted in crimson, Harry on the ground of the Hogwarts express with a broken nose, he even remembers the rejected handshake that just might have started it all. There was nothing there. He couldn’t see anything there but indifference towards each other.</p><p>How on earth did he develop feelings for Draco Malfoy?</p><p>“Harry, we-” Hermione started, but she was cut off.</p><p>“I need a moment to think.” And he pressed the palms of his hands to his eyes.</p><p>Feeling them both slowly get up, release the Muffliato charm, and walk out the door was hard. But nothing hurt more than when he stopped his breathing to hear whisper-shouts out the door and realising with a cold, empty feeling that Malfoy was outside, crying in the arms of his -no, <em> their </em> friends.</p><p>***</p><p>The 3 days passed like everything else. Only difference was the way his mind wandered to Malfoy a lot more than usual, and how his sleep no longer consisted of hands to hold. But it wasn’t like he needed it anymore. The pain has gotten a lot better.</p><p>Hermione and Ron told him the night before that they couldn’t be there when Harry was released. They were truthful and honest when they told Harry that they didn’t want to be in the middle of whatever happens when he gets to his house. To be fair, Harry didn’t really put up a fight.</p><p>“Besides,” Hermione had said just before the two left. “If we were there, you might hide behind us. How can people have a serious talk when one hides?” </p><p>Commending Hermione and her logic, he changed into the new clothes that Ron gave him. He endured through one last diagnostic charm by Tina with gritted teeth. When she smiled and nodded in satisfaction, Harry moved to hug her, thanking her for everything she’d done. </p><p>“No need to thank me. I have been your main healer for the past 4 years.” She smiled, a hint of sadness in there. </p><p>“I’m sorry, I don’t remember.” He pulled back, and signed the last paper on Tina’s clipboard.</p><p>“It’s okay.” </p><p>
  <em> Was it though? </em>
</p><p>“Either way, I’m still your main healer.” Tina started to talk, gesturing for Harry to follow. “Unless you wish to have a different healer?” </p><p>“No! No, thank you. You’re a great healer, and you don’t treat me differently like the ones I had before.” </p><p>Tina laughed and it echoed down the empty hall. “That’s what you said before. Even without your memories, you’re still you.” </p><p>Tina led him to her office to where the floo was. No one thought he was ready to apparate just yet. With one hand grabbing a handful of floo powder, and the other taking the piece of paper with his address on it, he sighed. Tina waved goodbye as Harry spoke. </p><p>“7 Autumn Avenue!” </p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p>Stumbling through the floo on the other side was not how he wanted to enter, but the rush of floo travel was so painful he doubled over almost immediately. He was covered in soot, but too tired to dust it off. The first thing he noticed was that he might’ve already stained what seemed to be a spotless carpet.</p><p>“<em>Fuck.</em>” He said to himself. </p><p>He tried to get up, but his knees gave out. Just when he needed it, a pair of pale delicate hands helped him up and get to the couch a few steps away. He wiped clean his glasses, and put them back on only to stare at the carpet, and the soot stain, in high definition.</p><p>“You’re early. I wasn’t expecting you for at least another hour.” It was Malfoy’s voice. Slightly deeper than in his memory. A lot more calm than from when he woke up. “Couldn’t wait to get out of there, could you, you impatient git.” </p><p>Harry finally looked up, amazed at the obvious friendly teasing in Malfoy’s tone. Harry commanded his eyes to focus on the man in front of him. His friend. His apparent partner. </p><p>In auror training, one of the most important lessons is getting information from a glance. One glance at Malfoy was all Harry needed, but he continued to stare on. </p><p>Malfoy’s face showed way too much. For one, Harry knew he hadn’t had a proper night’s sleep. Heavy bags under his sunken eyes, and his usually flawless skin had spots. Along with that, Malfoy’s cheekbones had sharpened immensely, his jawline jutting out. He looked sick, thin, and much too tired. </p><p>The faint noise of something sizzling from what Harry assumed was the kitchen, started to grow a little louder. He realised that a hint of raw ginger and garlic surrounded Malfoy thinly. His eyes widened as his thoughts continued on. Draco Malfoy was cooking food, and it smelled, so far, amazing.</p><p>“Are you cooking? What time is it?” Harry didn’t think he could’ve held in his questions even if he wanted to.</p><p>“Yes, I am.” Then Malfoy’s eyebrow raised. “Aren’t you a wizard, Harry? Cast a tempus.” </p><p>You’d think after so much of his life, even excluding the part he couldn’t remember, he would be used to magic now. But no. Instead his childhood-enemy-from-years-ago-turned-good-who-somehow-became-his-lover-that-he-couldn’t-remember had to remind him of its existence. Feeling the tips of his ears grow red, he pulled out his wand and cast a tempus.</p><p>“Almost lunch time.” He said to Malfoy.</p><p>“Precisely. Almost time to eat.” With that Malfoy left, disappearing to the kitchen.</p><p>Harry continued resting on the chair, waiting for the pain in his stomach to subside. Whilst he waited, he took note of the room. There were shelves on the corner overflowing with books, he noticed some were muggle stories, the others were magical textbooks. The books were all over the place, but for some reason, he knew there was an order to this mess. Organised chaos.</p><p>His eyes continued to browse the room, taking note of muggle lamps. For a house that has been lived in for years by two people, it seemed like it was missing something. Bits and pieces of things were here and there, a stack of wooden dragons on one table, a discarded coat, but it stillfelt bare. </p><p>When Harry realised there were no picture frames of anything, he frowned to himself. He always thought that he’d have memories everywhere in his house. But there was not a trace of any of it. Sinking further into the chair, trying not to go too deeply into thought, his eyes went over the soot stain on the carpet again. He cast a simple cleaning spell, and the carpet was brand new.</p><p>“Harry?” Malfoy called from the kitchen next room over.</p><p>“Yeah?” Harry wasn’t sure he was comfortable with Malfoy calling him by his first name just yet. Even though they’ve been dating for a while, it still shocked him a bit.</p><p>“Do you want to eat there or on the table?” Malfoy’s head poked from the doorway comically.</p><p>It was so strikingly domestic, his heart felt a strong pull. But even so, he needed to remember it all first. He wasn’t going to do anything like this. Not while he wasn’t really himself.</p><p>“The table’s fine. I’ll come over.”</p><p>Malfoy nodded once and disappeared again. </p><p>As Harry got up, walking towards the kitchen, he kept note of the lack of picture frames. He wanted to ask Malfoy about them. </p><p>The kitchen was exactly how he’d imagined it would be. A big bench countertop to accommodate his culinary experiments, a sink that was deep enough for large pots, and cooking utensils hanging next to the window, all jagged and messy. It was the complete opposite of the kitchen he’d grown up with at the Dursleys. This was exactly the way he’d imagined it to be all those years ago. He applauded the Harry he couldn’t remember, he wished he could tell him how proud he was.</p><p>Malfoy was scraping the last of the food from the pan onto a plate. The smell of the dish hit him so hard he started salivating. His stomach roared loudly.</p><p>Through snickers, Malfoy asked, “Merlin, Harry. Do you have an angry erumpent trapped in your stomach?”</p><p>Harry chuckled in response, and began to move through the other archway leading to the dining table. It was a modest table, it wasn’t grand or overbearing like he feared it would be. There were scratch marks on it. His fingers traced over them, and he smiled. This table was well loved, it made Harry almost tear up. </p><p>“I didn’t realise I was so afraid to see this house.” He whispered softly to himself.</p><p>His fear of walking through that floo into a place he couldn’t call home. The dread that the kitchen would look like the one etched into his childhood. Scared of walking through the house and seeing things that just weren't Harry James Potter. All of that, he didn’t realise it. </p><p>All too suddenly, a tear rolled down his cheek. It stopped and kissed at the scars he didn’t remember getting. He gently wiped it away.</p><p>A soft hoot and a rattle of a cage almost made him jump. </p><p>He looked back at the archway to the kitchen, and there it was. A beautiful brown owl, staring up at him with the widest eyes he’s ever seen. It hooted again softly, and tilted its head as Harry walked closer.</p><p>Tentatively, he opened the cage. The owl must’ve been wonderfully trained as it flew out only to rest at Harry’s arm. He pet it and scratched its neck. His heart soared and sobbed at the same time. </p><p>Out of all the things, he didn’t think he’d get another owl. Not after Hedwig.</p><p>“Her name is Isolt.”</p><p>Harry turned as Malfoy finished placing lunch on the table. The food looked absolutely delicious. His stomach rumbled once again, startling Isolt. </p><p>Malfoy laughed once more, and then walked to the window. “It’s Isolt’s flying time.” </p><p>Once the window opened, Harry expected Isolt to go flying. Yet, she didn’t. She kept staring at Harry, head tilted, as if she knew this Harry was different. Owls were incredibly smart. As the staring continued, he felt like he was being tested. Finally, Isolt hooted softly, and moved to rub her head against Harry’s jaw. </p><p>One second she was there, the next she was gone.</p><p>Harry, finally sitting at the table, instantly dug into his food. Malfoy, he noted, ate slowly. There were no words shared between them.</p><p>Soon enough, Harry’s spoon was scraping against the plate, trying to get as much as he could from the amazing meal. When he finally put his spoon and fork down, Malfoy smirked at him. </p><p>“I take the food was good then?” </p><p>The way he said it, the way friend’s tease each other, joke around, playing fun. It was weird for Harry. There was no bridge between the last time Harry saw Malfoy in 8th year to now. It was too sudden. He swallowed the uncomfortable lump in his throat.</p><p>“It was great, thank you. When did you learn to cook?” </p><p>Malfoy’s smirk faltered, then slowly descended to a thin line. “A few years ago.” </p><p>Harry, noting the way he didn’t seem to want to talk more about it, nodded. </p><p>Silence took over the room again. Malfoy didn’t seem to have eaten even half of his plate yet. Despite that, he looked much for sure of himself than Harry could muster right now. </p><p>“Malfoy,” Harry said slowly. “I don’t remember the past 5 years. Last I checked, Hermione just became Minister for Magic… It’s all really sudden for me, this entire situation. Even this place.” </p><p>Harry looked at Malfoy as he crumbled. Malfoy couldn’t seem to look at Harry anymore. His shoulders dropped, leaving the tension that was so tightly together. He took a deep breath, and closed his eyes tightly. </p><p>Harry gathered Malfoy was trying to keep himself together. But when tears started falling onto the table, just behind the unfinished plate of food, Harry stopped breathing all together. </p><p>It was too much. There was too much here. Why did Harry think it was a good idea to come here knowing how much there was? How many memories did he forget? How could they possibly talk things over when it held so much emotion? </p><p>Malfoy put his hands over his face. After a few seconds, he exhaled, schooled his features, and shoved his messy hair away from his face. Harry stared at Malfoy, wondering how he was able to hide it all, even after just crying. </p><p>“You have an office upstairs.” Malfoy started. Harry didn’t comment on how tired his voice suddenly was. “It has your stuff in it. A desk, books, journals. Hermione told me you had to regain your memory a different way. Maybe spending some time in there would help?” </p><p>The hope in Harry started to grow. Memories! He might be able to remember something. He could take anything. Hell, he’d take a bad pun from Ron if that’s all his mind would give him. At least it would be something.</p><p>His hope must’ve been all over his face because Malfoy smiled. He <em> smiled. </em> It was different from before, it was hopeful. Malfoy got up, leaving their dishes on the table, and started walking up the stairs. </p><p>Harry moved to get the dishes and put them in the kitchen when he heard Malfoy. “Just leave them, I’m not done. I’ll finish after I show you your office.” </p><p>Harry looked at the mess with uncertainty, but left it. Subtly, he cast a stasis charm on the remaining food on Malfoy’s plate. He wasn’t sure just how long they’d be up there for, but he didn’t want to take the risk and let it get cold.</p><p>The wooden stairs were beautiful. The third step had a creak that sounded like a cry from the Whomping Willow, and it scared Harry half to death. The handrails were simple yet elegant. The best thing was there was no cupboard underneath the stairs. It seemed to be taken off and destroyed. </p><p>The house was better than he thought it would be.</p><p>With one startling moment, Harry realised that Malfoy must know at least a little bit of his traumatic childhood. He wasn’t sure how to handle that information. Thankful that he didn’t need to tell Malfoy, but also uncomfortable he knew something he kept deep down.</p><p>“That’s the bedroom.” Malfoy pointed to the room at the end of the hallway. “That’s the spare room.” Pointing to another door next to it. </p><p>They continued walking down. When they passed another door and Malfoy didn’t note it, Harry stopped. “What about this one?” </p><p>“Oh, that’s my office. Didn’t think it was important.” Malfoy shrugged and continued walking.</p><p>“Then why’d you point out the spare room?” Harry asked, confused at the logic.</p><p>Malfoy stopped short of the last room which Harry concluded was his own office. “Harry, you don’t remember anything from the past 5 years. You don’t remember… us. So, until you get your memories back, we’ll be sleeping in different rooms.” </p><p>Harry felt like a right idiot. Of course they’d been sleeping in the same room since they moved in together. Harry felt so stupid. Feeling slightly embarrassed he slapped a palm to his face. </p><p>Malfoy laughed softly at Harry, shaking his head. He continued walking. “You can be so daft sometimes.” </p><p>The insult was laced with layers of affection. Harry wanted to run. It was all too fast, too weird, too uncomfortable, too… much. </p><p>They finally reached the last door. “Welcome to your office, Harry James Potter.” </p><p>Malfoy stepped back, letting Harry be the one to open it. It was a small gesture, but it meant everything. </p><p>The office was incredible. This is the one place, the first place, that really felt like him. Even if it wasn’t the same Harry that left this room, the Harry now that entered it felt right at home. </p><p>On the desk were an array of ink bottles and pens that looked like they were from a 2 dollar muggle shop. He had shelves with stacks of folders shoved hastily on top of each other. There were a few books, a mix of muggle and magical. On the window sill was a potted plant, not dead yet, but seemed to be in need of a lot of care. </p><p>Harry looked at Malfoy still outside the door. “Are you going to come in?” Harry asked.</p><p>“No, this is your space.” Malfoy looked around hesitantly, then continued. “I know you don’t remember, but we agreed that our offices would be spaces for ourselves.” </p><p>Harry waited for him to continue, but he never did. “That seems very mature of us.” </p><p>Malfoy smiled at the remark. “Yeah, I guess so. Younger us would never have imagined we’d be as civil as we are now.” </p><p>It was a joke in poor taste. But when Harry went to comment on it, Malfoy’s face had contorted in a cringe, regret all over his face. Harry suppressed a laugh at the image in front of him, and continued to move around the room.</p><p>“I’ll leave you to it. Shout if you need me.” And with that, Malfoy was gone, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>He stepped to the middle of the room and took one full turn. “Okay, Harry James Potter, time to find out who you were.” </p><p>He decided to tackle the desk first. Moving around to sit down, he took note of just how messy it was. Broken quills and dried out ink pots littered one of the corners. He moved to grab one of the pens, and tested it on a random piece of paper. Out of the 3 pens on the table, only one of them could actually be used.</p><p>Then, he looked properly at the desk. There were books, what seemed to be diaries and journals, stacked up. Going to pick one of them up for reading, movement caught the corner of his eye. </p><p>It was a picture frame. A moving picture frame. A group of people laughing and smiling, arms over shoulders and a flash of the camera. A moment of camaraderie held within a simple frame.</p><p>His hands started to shake as he picked it up. It felt like he was holding the world in his hands. The picture restarted, but the feeling of pure happiness never left each of their faces.</p><p>Harry was in the middle, Malfoy beside him. They were holding hands, yet looking away from each other. Beside Harry were Ron and Hermione. Their mouths moving and a cheering fist from the both of them shooting through the sky. Luna and Ginny were there too, smiling and talking, they belatedly joined in the first pump a few moments later.</p><p>Next to Malfoy were a much older Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini than he remembered. There was softness in their faces as they leaned forward to look at the cheering squad. They laughed as they raised their arms. Neville Longbottom, Theodore Nott, and Greogoy Goyle were there too, looking at each other smiling, until they all leaned back, laughing.</p><p>The scene replayed over and over again. Harry picked out new things here and there through the graininess of the photos. Like the snitch that flew behind them all just before the flash, or how Luna’s drink sloshed out of her cup, the way Nott and Neville were holding hands, and how Goyle had his arm around Neville. Harry didn’t know how long he stared at it, watching this memory over and over again. </p><p>He cried after finally putting that picture frame down. It wasn’t a calm teary eyed cry, no. It was heart wrenching sobs and the biting of his clenched fist as he tried to be quiet even though he wanted to scream. It was his free hand rubbing circles over his aching chest in a vain attempt to soothe the pain. </p><p>It was carelessly thrown glasses on the desk as he looked up at the ceiling, wondering why he had to go through this too, <em> I saved the world, didn’t I? Give me a break. </em> It was begging for his memory to return. It was pleading and praying, and no answers. It was denial at the situation because how could he <em> ever </em> forget something like this? </p><p>Anger started flowing through his veins. The frustration weaved through every nerve ending like a pinball machine. Every single thought was painted red. His fists clenched so tightly he didn’t realise the nails digging into his palm. The unfairness of it all hit him square in the chest.</p><p>He didn’t even know what they were celebrating in that photo. He didn’t know anything. He couldn’t remember, and no matter how many times he watched it, nothing came. No flashes of a smile or a lingering taste on his tongue, no smell of fresh backyard air or tingling touches, and absolutely no recall of how their laughter sounded. No memories.</p><p>It was all too much. </p><p>He started to laugh maniacally, feeling himself edge towards insanity. The first picture frame he came across in his own house had reduced him into a right mess. He just keeps underestimating just how much he’s lost.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p>When he finally stopped crying, his breathing now normal and glasses put on, he reached over for the stack of journals and began reading. </p><p>His eyes travelled over each page. Remnants of his anger made him have to reread sentences. He finally got halfway through a journal, which he found was just filled with dates for interviews, meetings, and speeches, and decided it was time for a break. </p><p>Feeling his eyes were still puffy and his hands still had a slight shake, he stayed in the room, not going downstairs just yet. He’d forgotten to ask Malfoy about the missing pictures in the house, but with how intensely he reacted to the one on his desk, he was thankful he did. </p><p>His hands started to fidget, begging for something to do, but his mind was exhausted. He looked around at the mess of his office. Thankful to have something mindless to do, he got up and started cleaning.</p><p>Opening the window was the first step. A gust of wind pushed through, and the smell of dust that Harry didn’t even notice was there, slowly began to disappear. The view from his window was beautiful. He could see the side of the neighbour’s house, the street below and the way it curved. He saw the front yard, eyes landing on the mix of flowers from lilies to daffodils. If he looked hard even, he could make out the shine of the wards. With wide eyes, he realised that this house was in a muggle neighbourhood.</p><p>He slowly stepped back from the window, allowing himself to indulge in the sight and breathe in the fresh air before turning around to face the task at hand. The wind must’ve been a lot stronger than he thought because it looked like a tornado had came through. The papers on his desk now scattered across the floor, several folders and books on the shelves had opened up. He rubbed his face and groaned.</p><p>“Fine.” He said to himself, and started picking up the mess.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p>Harry’s office now looked a lot better. Folders all stacked neatly on top of each other, books sitting tightly together. Amidst all the mess going on in Harry’s life, at least this one place, this one single place that was purely his, was organised.</p><p>A flutter of wings and a soft hoot brought him back to the real world. Isolt perched on the window sill, a letter tied to her foot. Harry walked over, and pet her gently. In time he knew he’d get used to having an owl again, and that somewhere deeply hidden in his mind was a reason he bought another. </p><p>“Hello, Isolt. Have a letter for me?” Isolt hooted softly and shook her leg.</p><p>Harry smiled, and took the letter off. Before he could start reading it, Isolt flew over to his desk and pecked at the corner of it. Harry realised he hadn’t checked the drawers yet. In one swift movement, he went to his desk and opened up the top drawer that Isolt seemed to be pecking at. </p><p>Under a shimmering stasis charm, a box of owl treats sat untouched. He took one and gave it to Isolt who ate it happily from his hand. His heart hurt as memories of Hedwig came through. But when Isolt rubbed her head against Harry’s hand, and looked up at him with big eyes, he felt that it would be okay.</p><p><em> None of your memories have come back yet. You don’t know who you are. </em>His mind began to dig a hole to fall into. It stopped almost as soon as it had start when Isolt bit the hand that held the letter. He glared at Isolt as he opened it. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> ‘Harry, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Dinner will be ready soon. Come down whenever you want, I can put the food under stasis. Isolt hasn’t had any jobs lately, so I thought she’d enjoy sending one to you. Let me know when you’ll be down. Send it through Isolt! </em>
</p><p>
  <em> From, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> DM  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> P.S: Thanks for putting my lunch under stasis.’ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Mixed emotions flooded through Harry, just as it always did when it came to the new Malfoy. Well maybe not new, just unknown. The unknown Malfoy of the past 5 years. This letter wasn’t anything like he thought Malfoy would write. It was informal and domestic and not at all what he’d expect.</p><p>Grabbing a pen, avoiding the quills covered in dry ink, he wrote his reply. He let Malfoy know he’d be down in half an hour. Isolt’s feet tippy-tapped along his desk as he wrote, her excitement could be felt from miles away. He’d only just got the letter tired around her ankle when she shot off through the window.</p><p>He watched from the desk. The soft warm brown of Isolt’s wings next to the slowly darkening sky. The sky now filled with a mix of a red orange slowly being overrun by dark blues, and the cotton candy clouds. It was beautiful. </p><p>The view outside, and a window almost as big as the wall. The office really was his place. It was open and freeing, he didn’t feel cramped even with piles of paper everywhere. Harry applauded the unknown Harry, thanking him for such care and thought into the place he wanted to call home. </p><p>He watched as all remnants of the sun disappeared from the sky. Deciding it was time to go, he shut the window, but not before taking one more deep refreshing breath in. He closed the office door behind him gently, and walked back to the dining room table.</p><p>Malfoy was humming in the kitchen in the melody of… Was that the Hogwarts school song? Harry poked his head through and watched Malfoy move around the kitchen, oblivious to Harry’s shocked staring. </p><p>“I thought you hated the school song?” Harry asked, finally making his presence known.</p><p>Malfoy continued moving, adding final touches to the dinner. “You thought a lot of things, Harry.” He smiled gently at Harry, then gestured to the plates. “Can you bring those to the table? I won’t be a moment longer.”</p><p>Amazed at how low Malfoy’s walls were around Harry, he grabbed the plates, cutlery, and glasses, and brought them to the table. He laid them all neatly, well as neat as they could be, and sat down to wait.</p><p>In the corner was Isolt, a few dead mice in her cage. In the other corner was a table that held a few candles. Harry looked up and almost passed out at what he saw. He’d been sure he’d remember a floating chandelier with lit candles instead of lightbulbs, but no, no it was there and Harry just seemed to completely miss it. Blimey, how oblivious was he?</p><p>“We limit the amount of electricity in the house,” Malfoy said, catching Harry staring at the candle chandelier. “Our magic messes with it too much. That’s why we just use it in the living room where all the books are.” </p><p>Harry just nodded. Malfoy set down the big bowl of pasta in the middle of the table. It looked amazing, and his wonder for how Malfoy cooked just increased.</p><p>After Malfoy took a plateful, Harry got his food as well. When he ate one bite, he hummed happily. It was nice, and let Malfoy know it.</p><p>“You could probably cook better.” Malfoy replied offhandedly.</p><p>“Yeah, I probably could.” Harry teased, surprised the animosity he usually had was almost gone. “How’d you start cooking? You don’t need to tell me, you were uncomfortable before but I thought maybe I coul star-”</p><p>Malfoy held up a hand to stop the beginning of Harry’s word vomit. “A few years ago, you wanted to teach me. So you did.” </p><p>Harry could feel Malfoy begin to close up. He saw it in the twitch in Malfoy eyebrow and the clenching of his jaw. But Harry wanted to keep asking questions. He needed to know, he was dying to know, to remember. </p><p>That familiar thrum of anger resonated in his chest.</p><p>“I just decided to teach you because I wanted to?” He scoffed.</p><p>Malfoy’s eyes narrowed slightly. “Yes. That is what happened.”</p><p>“I don’t believe it, that doesn’t make sense. I just decided to?” </p><p>“You’re Harry bleeding Potter, have you ever made sense?” Malfoy threw back. His voice was calm, annoyingly so, and it irked Harry to no end.</p><p>“How are you so calm about this entire situation, <em> Malfoy? </em> How is it that I, somehow your boyfriend, lost memories of our entire relationship and you can just carry on like normal? I fall through the floo, and you’re treating me like nothing’s happened.” Harry’s voice was trembling, a mix of anger hiding the sadness.</p><p>“Am I?” Malfoy put down the spoon, the food long forgotten. “I’ve had weeks of knowing your memory is gone. Since the first day, I knew you’d forgotten,” His voice cracked. “Us.... Every day we’ve spent together as friends and more just gone because one single raid had gone wrong. I spent days crying. Hermione and Ron had to come over and make sure I ate every day, did you know?” </p><p>Harry was silent. His anger was bubbling. He didn’t know if he was angry at Malfoy for making sense, or himself for wanting to ignore it. “No, I didn’t know.” He finally said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Of course you didn’t. I begged them not to tell you.” </p><p>“Why on earth would you do that?”</p><p>“So that you wouldn’t worry. Didn’t matter. They didn’t tell you about me ‘til a few days ago, remember?” Malfoy’s hands were fidgeting, rolling his wand back and forth across the table. He was still incredibly calm despite the sharpness in his words.</p><p>Harry nodded in response, and felt the anger turn into a slow simmer. He sighed, and tried to control himself. Nothing made sense. None of it made sense. This unknown Malfoy, the unknown Harry of before, this unknown Hermione, Ron, Isolt. It was all unknown. </p><p>Harry poked and prodded at his food. He didn’t have much of an appetite anymore.</p><p>“There’s a picture frame on my desk,” He said slowly, avoiding Malfoy’s eyes. “It’s got everyone in it, you, Ron, Hermione, Neville and Luna, Ginny, even some of the other Slytherins from school.”</p><p>Malfoy just hummed in response. Harry continued to look down at the table.</p><p>“I don’t remember any of it. I stared at that picture for what felt like years, trying to bring a memory into existence. Nothing came back.” Harry sighed and finally looked up.</p><p>Malfoy looked tired and broken all over again. Harry’s heart pulled towards him, but he stayed where he was. Whoever this Malfoy is, he didn’t love him. Not like unknown Harry did, and not the way unknown Malfoy wanted him to. </p><p>“Have you tried reading th-” </p><p>“Malfoy, I need to know,” Harry cut him off before he could forget to ask. “Where are the rest of the picture frames? There’s no way I would only have one in the house.” </p><p>Malfoy stared at Harry, scanning him. For the first time since, Harry felt a hint of the Draco Malfoy he remembered from school. Cool and calculating, observing and ready to strike. Then Malfoy’s face dropped as he sighed.</p><p>Harry watched as Malfoy picked up his wand and pointed to the corner where the table of candles were. </p><p>“<em>Revelio</em>.”</p><p>Three neatly stacked boxes shimmered into view. Harry gasped and stood up, walking to them quickly. Malfoy followed. Before Harry could open the box to look inside, Malfoy’s hand landed on the top. </p><p>“Look, Harry…”</p><p>But Harry's had enough. There’s been too much today. In fact, it’s been pretty loaded this past month since he woke up. No memories have resurfaced, nothing is making any sort of sense, the two people who he does know a little are not here, and Draco bloody Malfoy’s hand is blocking his access to physical reminders of anything that’s happened the past 5 years. </p><p>He’s had enough. He physically felt the thread holding in his pent up anger break.</p><p>“You hid these from me? When were you gonna tell me? There’s three whole boxes filled with photos and you didn’t bother telling me? What the FUCK is wrong with you?” Harry’s voice boomed, and even seconds after he finished the house still shook.</p><p>Malfoy brought his hand close to his chest and took a step back. His face fell and his bottom lip quivered. He looked like he was going to cry, and Harry almost reached out to him. Almost. But his anger was still too strong.</p><p>Then it changed. Malfoy’s face completely changed. He was now angry, and incredibly so. The air around him seemed to spark, and Malfoy’s eyes held a raging fire in them. </p><p>“I do a good thing for you, and you think I’m being selfish? I had a feeling you’d react badly to them if you were surrounded by them, so I packed them. Now here you are, throwing it all back to me.” Malfoy’s voice was like a snake’s hiss, and seemed to weave itself into the walls of the house. “You’re the selfish one.”</p><p>Harry wanted to grab his wand, to hold it out and against Malfoy but something stopped him. Some sort of muscle memory that kept a level of logic when Harry’s mind couldn’t. But Harry was seeing more and more red.</p><p>“<em>I</em><em>’m </em> the selfish one?” Harry laughed. He actually laughed at the thought. “You’re the one without a damn heart. Acting like nothing’s changed. Typical of a Malfoy. In case you haven’t noticed, <em> Malfoy, </em>” He spat. “Everything has changed.” </p><p>“You think I don’t know that? Merlin, for once in my life I try to do the right thing, and you come and fuck it all up. How else should I have acted, <em> Potter? </em> With the same hatred from school? Would you really have stayed here this long if I did? You’d run right back to St Mungo’s at the sight of me.” </p><p>Harry ground his teeth together. Everything that Malfoy was saying was right, and he knew it, but it was so aggravating. Each and every world felt like a slap across Harry’s face, and every look was a punch to the gut. </p><p>“You haven’t changed at all, Malfoy.” Harry’s voice sounded so wrong, even to him. </p><p>He didn’t even realise how much his chest was hurting. It wasn’t from anger this time, no, it was the same low thrum of emotional pain he felt just before he sobbed his heart out only a few hours ago. Something was wrong.</p><p>“Did you really think I did?” Malfoy sneered. </p><p>All the walls were up. </p><p>This Malfoy in front of him was a near perfect image of what he remembered in Hogwarts years. It wasn’t an unknown Malfoy anymore, it was the same Draco Malfoy who stalked the halls like a king, who bullied his friends relentlessly, a coward. Harry almost cried at the familiarity. </p><p>It made his next action a lot easier.</p><p>“<em>Stupefy</em>!” Harry’s wand was up, pointing at Malfoy square in the chest.</p><p>“<em>Protego</em>!” Malfoy was quick, he dodged away and found shelter behind the kitchen wall. “<em>Expelliarmus</em>.”</p><p>Harry put up his shield, and hid behind the chair. “<em>Flipendo</em>.” But his aim was off and hit the wall instead.</p><p>"<em>I</em><em>mpedimenta</em>!” Malfoy’s wand shot out.</p><p>Harry felt his body slow down. He willed the jinx to end faster. “<em>Flipendo</em>!” The incantation reached normal speed halfway through.</p><p>Malfoy dodged just in time. “<em>Steleus</em>!”</p><p>Harry dodged, just barely. The quick movement brought a sharp pain just above his stomach. He was still healing, and this duel was a stupid idea. Yet, he continued on. </p><p>“<em>Alarte</em> <em>ascendare</em>!”</p><p>Malfoy, distracted by Harry’s flinch in pain, was hit with the spell. He shot up in the air, barely missing the ceiling, and fell. He landed on his knees, then fell forward, holding himself up with his hands. He gasped, then pointed his wand right at Harry.</p><p>“<em>Locomotor</em> <em>wibbly</em>.”</p><p>Malfoy barely got through the incantation, but Harry’s legs collapsed right underneath him. For seconds, it was just the two of them breathing, gasping for air. The tension in the house was still so high, and the air still sparked with anger.</p><p>Harry slowly got up. He sat on the floor next to the table and faced Malfoy heaving on the kitchen floor. </p><p>“Something grand must’ve happened for me to ever date you.” Harry said, venom laced into his words. “With our history, different sides of the war. The things you family did against mine. I didn’t think I’d ever forgive that, even if I did speak at your trial.”</p><p>Malfoy stayed on the kitchen floor on all fours. He was shaking now, trembling. Harry coughed up a bit of blood. Wiping his hands on his trousers, he tried to calm down his breathing.</p><p>“Damn it.” </p><p>Suddenly, Malfoy was at his side, checking him. Either Harry was losing his sense of perception or the pain was becoming too distracting to notice. Yet there Malfoy was, casting simple diagnostic spells on Harry even though they had just fought.</p><p>Harry moved his head slightly, and saw unknown Malfoy again. This new Draco Malfoy, boyfriend to unknown Harry, friends to unknown people. Harry watched as Malfoy moved above him, carefully checking him. </p><p>Harry wanted to hold his breath and stop time so he could think. So that he could have a proper reply to the way Malfoy was looking at him. Despite the sunken eyes, messy hair, and exhausted body, he looked at Harry like he was everything. There was too much love in it. Too much affection. It was too much.</p><p>He couldn’t handle it. </p><p>“I don’t.” Harry whispered, moving his eyes away from Malfoy’s face and onto the ceiling. </p><p>Malfoy stopped and looked at Harry in confusion. He tilted his head and asked, “You don’t what?”</p><p>Harry closed his eyes and begged his heart to stop aching. His heart was crying, he could feel it, and his mind had stopped moving completely. Something was wrong, the words he was saying felt like cotton stuffed into his mouth. It felt like soap bubbles filling up his throat. </p><p>“I don’t love you.”</p><p>It had to be true. Because how could he love the person in front of him? The man from his childhood? The man who took so many good memories from his grasp? It just had to be true. So why did his body scream out ‘LIAR!’ His heart yearned to be closer, to take the words back from the air before they reached Malfoy’s ears.</p><p>Harry gulped and finally looked at Malfoy and was surprised by his reaction. It was a soft sad smile, and tears were brimming at his eyes. </p><p>And Malfoy just nodded, and whispered, “I know.” </p><p>“I’m sorry.” </p><p>Harry didn’t know what he was apologising for, but he felt the need to. Even as Malfoy got up, and moved towards the living room, Harry reached for him. </p><p>What Harry realised just then was that the only thing that forgot anything from the past 5 years was his mind. His body still remembered it all.</p><p>Harry heard voices from the living room, and then the swooshes of the floo. Suddenly remembering the food, he cast a wandless stasis charm on it. </p><p>Whoever the guests were, hopefully they didn’t mind Harry just casually on the floor with bloody trousers and blood dripping from his mouth. </p><p>More talking occured, and finally footsteps found their way to Harry. </p><p>“Harry! What happened?” Hermione was instantly next to him. </p><p>Ron cast a patronus, and told it to find healer Tina and to come to Autumn Avenue quickly. The russell-terrier bounded through the air and through the window, startling a very quiet and watchful Isolt.</p><p>“There was a duel. Forgot I came out of the hospital today. Y’know, the usual.” Harry joked.</p><p>It fell flat on everyone’s ears. Malfoy sighed in defeat, and raised his arms up in amazement. </p><p>“A mad man!” Malfoy exclaimed, and walked back into the kitchen.</p><p>The sound of a kettle boiling, and clinks of mugs hit their ears as they waited for healer Tina to come back. Harry wanted to talk to Ron and Hermione, but he didn’t know where to begin. Honestly, he just wanted to sleep. </p><p>Hermione and Ron stayed in silence. Even when Malfoy came through, giving everyone their respective teas, no words of thanks were given. </p><p>Harry wanted to drink his, but he didn’t fancy the taste of blood mixed in. It smelt divine though. It helped distract him from the growing pain right above his stomach. It wasn’t a sharp pain anymore, it was a distant ache. He no longer wanted to cough, but once Harry opened his mouth to say anything, Hermione, Ron and even Malfoy shot him a look that said, “Nope. Shut up.”</p><p>Finally, the floo roared and the familiar high heel footsteps of healer Tina bounced off the walls.</p><p>She stopped in front of the 4 of them. 3 sipping tea, and a man with blood on him on the floor. Tina rubbed her temple and sighed. </p><p>“Let’s fix you up.” </p><p>Harry shot her a grateful smile.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p>Harry woke up the next day feeling a million times better than he had when he fell asleep. Eyes blinking awake, he patted at the table next to him for his glasses. Finding them, he yawned, and put them on.</p><p>Somehow, Harry had woken up in a bed when he distinctly remembered he fell asleep on the floor. He sat up, and looked around. This must’ve been the bedroom unknown Malfoy and unknown Harry had shared. Laundry basket in the corner, drawers and closets pushed against the wall. </p><p>He got up, and walked into the bathroom. Begrudgingly, he began to get ready for the day. Finding clothes somewhere amongst the wardrobes, guessing his toothbrush was the strikingly deep Gryffindor red that bordered on obnoxious, he finally got there. </p><p>While walking down the stairs, he could smell the pasta from last night. His stomach rumbled and he remembered that he’d barely gotten more than 3 bites before the argument broke out. He groaned at the memory. What was he thinking? But he felt he was well within his right to have been angry. He just knew starting the duel might’ve been a tad, just a tiny little tad, too far.</p><p>Under a stasis charm, the food awaited patiently for Harry. He looked around for Isolt, but she was nowhere to be found. However, the window was open, and he knew how smart owls were. He tried to quell the tiny bit of worry for Isolt, and started eating breakfast.</p><p>Malfoy was not in the house, by what he could hear. There was no humming or cooking or noises from anywhere but the scrape of his spoon against the plate. Not that he cared though. </p><p>Despite not caring, he walked through the kitchen and the living room just to be sure. He almost decided to check the rooms upstairs until a note on the kitchen counter caught his attention. Harry picked it up and read it.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Harry Potter, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> If you happen to wonder where I am, I’ve gone to work. Contact Ron or Hermione if you need, or send a patronus my way. Healer Tina informed me last night that she would be busy, so if you’re in dire need, use the emergency floo line.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> There’s lunch ready for you in the fridge. It’s nice served cold. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> DM.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>A small hint of regret made its presence known as he reread the letter. Unknown Malfoy was still nice, albeit a bit more cold than yesterday. It was fair though, Harry had been a little bit of a git. </p><p>His thoughts started a war between himself. One side supportive of Harry’s judgement and actions of last night, the other, not so much. Pros and cons shot arrows at each other. It was giving him a migraine.</p><p>He decided tea would be the solution, as it always is.</p><p>A few minutes, one steaming cup of earl grey tea, and a soothed mind later, he walked over to the boxes of picture frames. Fear and anticipation filled his entire body. There would be a lot to go through in there, a lot to handle, and Harry knew it would be too much.</p><p>But if he had to choose between too much or nothing at all, he’d go with too much.</p><p>There were thousands of them. Tiny small frames the size of his palm to grand frames that were the size of his torso. The clench of his heart never went away as he quickly skimmed over each one, unpacking them with the utmost care, and laying them on the floor.</p><p>The third box and final box to be opened contained ones that seemed to make Harry want to cry, vomit and scream at the same time. Each and every single one were just him and one other person. Most of them were Malfoy and Harry, but there were others. Harry and Ron, Harry and Hermione, even ones with an unknown Parkinson and Zabini. </p><p>There were three left to unpack, face down. Harry blinked the tears away from his eyes. He flexed and unflexed his hands, trying to calm the shake that seemed to grow. </p><p>The first of the last, was of Harry and a toddler. He couldn’t tell what colour the toddler’s hair was or what words he was saying, but Harry held him. The toddler sat high on his hip despite seeming to be too big for that. The way Harry looked at the toddler… There was something about it, something that he knew he would only save for that one.</p><p>The second was of Malfoy and the toddler. There was no Harry in this one. The toddler was giggling, sitting high on Malfoy’s shoulders. Malfoy was looking up at him, not caring about how tightly the kid’s hold was on his hair. It was so sweet. This moment captured seemed to calm him down a bit from the overwhelming situation.</p><p>The last was of all three of them. The kid in the middle, swinging as unknown Harry and Malfoy lifted him up. He watched it three times before realising the change in the sepia tones of the kid’s hair. </p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>It was Teddy.</p><p>His grip tightened in the picture frame. How could he not realise? But by god, 5 years feel like an eternity when it comes to the growth of a kid. He was just a baby last time he remembered, but here he was, smiling and jumping and walking like a kid. </p><p>He wanted to see him this intant. To hug him and hold him and hear him tell him stories of just about anything and everything. Harry was up and walking to the floo before he stopped. Did Teddy know he’d forgotten the past 5 years with him? What if he didn’t like Harry anymore because he’d changed?</p><p>Cold fear ran down his spine.</p><p>No. He’ll try and get some sort of memory first before visiting him. He wanted to know, to be, the person Teddy was laughing and smiling with in those photos. </p><p>Determined, he walked right back to the dining room, floor covered in framed moments of time. He held each one with care, analysing each face. Some of them he knew, some of them he didn’t. Yet he looked at each one with a close eye, waiting for a hint of some sort of memory to come through. But none did.</p><p>Hours were spent in silence. Even the frames didn’t dare knock into one another. Everything was so fragile, from Harry’s heart to the quiet of the house. </p><p>He discovered a lot of things though. Ginny and Luna were married from their matching rings in several photos. Theodore Nott, Neville, and surprisingly Gregory Goyle were in a relationship. Some photos just two would be holding hands, other times kisses on cheeks and winks were captured in the moving photos. He was amazed, but they all looked happy, so he was too.</p><p>Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini were not dating, but seemed to be very close. They got along with so many people, easy smiles and cheering of glasses shone through every photo they were in. It was incredible. </p><p>Andromeda hadn’t aged a day. Her face was still shone with youth just as it had done all those years ago. Her smiles were bright, and her eyes had a sense of peace in them. He held back all the tears that threatened to take over. He told himself he wouldn’t break down again, not like yesterday.</p><p>Everyone was the same, yet different. A sense of familiarity was the only thing he gained from going through the pictures. His mind couldn’t place it, the reasons or the logic as to why everyone was moving so well together, but he just knew they would. </p><p>It was extremely confusing, but also comforting.</p><p>Isolt still wasn’t back, Harry realised as he looked over to her corner. The window was still open wide, gusts of air pushed through encouraging Harry to breathe in slowly. </p><p>He looked back at the photos. It was him, but at the same time, it wasn’t. There was still so much to rediscover about himself and who he hung out with.</p><p>There were still the journals and diaries in his office to read through, folders too, but he assumed most of them were work related. Then there would also be newspaper articles. He groaned at the thought, both annoyed and elated with the fact his life would continue to be documented for the public to see. </p><p>Thankfully, he had all the time in the world. Kingsley was very understanding, giving Harry time off to heal from his ‘extensive injuries,’ as Tina had told him. Harry wondered if Kingsley knew of his absent memories, knowing Ron’s files would recount it all, but if Kingsley knew, he didn’t let on. </p><p>Too riled up to pack the pictures back in their boxes, he near-sprinted upstairs to the table. He needed to get his memories back, no matter what. For Teddy, for Ron, Hermione, Luna, Ginny, Malfoy… But most of all for himself. There was too much tightness, too much tension in every movement, every word he’s said since he woke up. </p><p>Once seated in his office, the window opened to let the air in, he started reading. The diaries were marked with dates of interviews, meetings, and speeches like he expected. But as he flipped through, those started to occur less and less. In their place were things like ‘Meet up with Neville about plant,’ and ‘Grab Draco’s suit.’ </p><p>He spent hours reading through them, There weren’t that many, even for 5 years. It seemed he’d fall off and forget about the books for weeks, even months, until he started writing in them again. He understood, life seemed to be busy all the time. </p><p>Aside from the diaries, there were journals that held a bit more than one sentence. It wasn’t much, but they held some newspaper clippings of things that Harry seemed to actually be happy about. From Ginny and Luna’s wedding article to the ‘The Coming Out of Ronald Weasley (and what it could mean for Hermione Granger)’ Harry laughed at that one both then, and now. Regardless of Ron’s sexuality, his love for Hermione is too strong. </p><p>He kept laughing as he went through the Daily Prophet articles, and smiled brightly when he read the Quibbler ones. Luna’s editing was fantastic, taking out the sensationalism out of the articles, and then adding comments on the creatures present. It was glorious to read.</p><p>Harry thought maybe there was a silver lining in losing his memory. </p><p>He could, for the first time again, read the things that made him happy.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p>A knock on the door took Harry away from his reading trance. The candle on his desk was lit, and the sky was darker than when he last saw it. He was biting his nails as he was reading, and didn’t notice how jagged they had become.</p><p>Another knock on the door. “Harry? Just checking up on you, are you okay?” </p><p>Malfoy’s voice was muffled slightly through the door, but he could still hear that hint of concern.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m okay!” Harry replied.</p><p>“Dinner will be here soon. Call Isolt home when you come down.” </p><p>Before Harry could reply, Malfoy’s shadow and footsteps moved away from the door. <em> Call Isolt </em>? How do you do that? Wait, had she not yet returned from this morning? The small bit of concern he crushed this morning came back full blast. </p><p>He put down the journal he was reading, doggy tagging where he was up to, and walked to the open window. The sky was dark and the twinkling of stars greeted him. Harry looked around, trying to find Isolt somewhere in the air, but it was too dark.</p><p><em> Do I just call her name? Or do I hoot? </em>He thought to himself.</p><p>Deciding he’d rather be embarrassed with himself than lose another loved pet, he leaned out the window, almost halfway out. Then he cupped his hands around his mouth and called. </p><p>“Isoooolt!”</p><p>His shout echoed and slightly shifted through the wards. Harry waited, halfway out a window on the second floor. There were no flaps of wings or hoots he could hear yet. He tried again. </p><p>And nothing.</p><p>Harry bent down and leant on the window pane, face in his arms. He kept thinking of something else he could do. How do you call an owl? Hedwig just came when Harry needed or when she wanted. Harry knew Isolt would be different, there’s no replacing a loved one, but Isolt was beginning to grow on him. </p><p>He groaned into his arms as he tried even harder to think. He could go downstairs and ask Malfoy, but then he’d definitely make fun of him for calling Isolt like that. Harry decided he wasn’t ready for that again, remembering the duel from last night.</p><p>Then he heard a soft hoot from on top of him. Then he started to notice the feel of talons on his head. Isolt was on his head. Huh. </p><p><em> Okay, if I move she’ll just go on my shoulder right?  </em>Wrong.</p><p>Harry stood up and while Isolt flew for a second, she only landed on top of his head once more. He put his arm in front of him for Isolt to land on, but she stayed perched on his head. He tried to look up at Isolt, and Isolt was only looking back down at him and tilted her head.</p><p>He couldn’t have stopped the sudden onslaught of laughter even if he wanted to. He felt it shoot up from the bottom of his feet to the top of his chest. It lasted about 5 straight minutes, and through it all, Isolt stayed perched proudly on his head.</p><p>“You’re not going to get off my head, are you?” Harry asked as he caught his breath.</p><p>A single hoot in reply, and Harry knew. </p><p>Even so, he’d much prefer to know Isolt was safe and on his head, than anywhere else and not. </p><p>He closed his eyes and took a moment to think of Hedwig, and if she was okay where pets go after they die. He thought of an owlery, or an open forest filled with all the mice and owl treats they’d want. He imagined Hedwig making friends and flying so far into the sky she could almost touch it. </p><p>Harry breathed in deeply at the vision, and held his breath. He put all his feelings into a tight ball in his chest. His love, regret, sadness, pain, admiration, all of it. Then he breathed back out slowly turning all of it into forgiveness for himself. It was okay. It was okay to have another pet. It was okay to have Isolt. </p><p>It wasn’t completely over, but it was a start. Harry felt his soul breathe just a little bit better.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p>After about half an hour, give or take, Harry and Isolt walked down the stairs into the dining room only to find the picture frames still all over the floor. He looked at Isolt’s corner, but she didn’t move off his head. Before he could tell her to go, Malfoy’s voice rang out.</p><p>“In here!” </p><p>It was coming from the living room. Intrigued, he moved to the living room, trying to flatten his shirt in case some guests had arrived. But when he got there, Malfoy was just putting takeout on the table and sitting on one of the chairs surrounding it.</p><p>Malfoy looked up, and smiled at Harry. It wasn’t a genuine smile per say, but it wasn’t malicious either. The closest thing he could say was that it was polite. He began to open up the array of takeout containers, and the smell of a mix of spices filled the room.</p><p>“Oh Merlin, is that tikka masala?” Harry asked as he moved to sit down on the chair opposite Malfoy.</p><p>Malfoy nodded a response, still smiling. It wasn’t just tikka masala though, it seemed to be different cuisine takeouts, from the tikka masala to honey chicken to pork in a lovely sweet sauce. </p><p>Harry didn’t realise just how hungry he was. He was so busy with his office and the picture frames that hunger didn’t seem important. Now it was the only thing on his mind.</p><p>Malfoy gestured for Harry to eat. Harry picked up one of the disposable bowls and a plastic spork and started grabbing a bit of each food. The smell of each dish was amazing alone, but together it was intoxicating. </p><p>After Harry got his food, Malfoy got his. It was just as silent as the dinner was last night, but it wasn’t tense or uncomfortable. Harry recognised that Malfoy seemed worn out. The kind of worn out that comes after a hard day at work. Harry himself was starting to feel it. </p><p>He took a risk. “Hard day at work, Malfoy?” </p><p>Malfoy looked startled for a brief millisecond. He swallowed his food and nodded. “It was one of the worst, there’s this customer who keeps telling me I give him the wrong potions. Says I give him a calming draught instead of a sleeping draught.” Malfoy scoffed. “Those two are as different as your hands and feet.” </p><p>Harry watched as Malfoy took out a bit of his anger on the food, chewing with a glare. Harry felt the side of his lips twitch into a smile. </p><p>“You work in potions?”</p><p>Malfoy scanned him for a moment, then answered. “Yes, but I believe you already knew that. You were busy in your office, I assume you saw some of the articles about it…” </p><p>In a way, Malfoy was right. Harry did know he worked in potions, set up his own apothecary and is quite well known for it these days. He did not, however, know how it opened up or that it was in the Daily Prophet more than once.</p><p>Harry decided not to push with the questions though. He’d learnt a decent amount today, there was no need to push Malfoy and end up with another duel. </p><p>“Can I see it? Maybe I’ll get some memories while I’m there.” </p><p>Harry continued eating a lot slower than when he started. He watched Malfoy, still trying to get a gauge on who unknown Malfoy was. </p><p>“Uh, sure. Wait, Harry, does that mean no memories have come?” </p><p>Malfoy put his food down on the table. It wasn’t completely finished, but he ate more than yesterday. Harry, on the other hand, gripped his bowl tighter. </p><p>“No… Nothing came today.” </p><p>“Nothing at all?” </p><p>Harry looked down at the floor and shook his head. To be honest, he didn’t know how to feel. One on hand, reading bits and pieces, and watching seconds of sepia tones replay over and over again was actually a grand experience after he got over the sadness of forgetting it all. </p><p>On the other hand, nothing came back when he went through it all. The goal he wanted to achieve was not completed, and despite thoroughly enjoying the journey, the destination was nowhere in sight.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Harry could hear the frown in Malfoy’s voice.</p><p>“I’m so-” </p><p>“Why are you apologising?” </p><p>Harry looked up at Malfoy. Malfoy’s tone of voice was so questioning it was almost authoritative. It threw Harry off. </p><p>“Not… remembering?” Even Harry knew it was a weak excuse.</p><p>“It’s not your fault. It’s no one’s fault.” Malfoy’s voice was back to the calmness it was before. “Bad situations seem to have a thing for us, don’t they?”</p><p>Harry chortled. “Yeah, they really do.” </p><p>Harry smiled at Malfoy. A proper smile this time, because he definitely deserved it. A small thought appeared in his mind, one that said that maybe, just maybe, having Malfoy as a boyfriend was a good call. Malfoy gave Harry a proper smile back. Harry didn’t know he missed it until he saw it.</p><p>“Harry, is it a good time to ask why Isolt is still on your head?” </p><p>Harry felt heat rushing to his neck. Oh Merlin, how’d he forget Isolt was up there. Truthfully, she hadn’t moved at all, and then he was distracted by the food, and then Malfoy was being actually pretty okay. It’s been a busy hour, okay?</p><p>“Well, I called her like you asked.” Harry started.</p><p>Malfoy smirked and mumbled, “Oh, I think Hogwarts heard you.”</p><p>“And she landed on my head, and she hasn’t gotten off since. She won’t go on my shoulders or my arm, or her cage.” Harry looked up as Isolt, and Isolt looked back just like before.</p><p>“Harry Potter, saviour of the wizarding world, can’t get his pet owl off his head.” Malfoy deadpanned.</p><p>Despite the words, Harry had a feeling the status title drop was a joke, so he let it slide. “Malfoy, she hasn’t moved has she?”</p><p>“Nope. She’s been sitting on your head proudly since you came in. To be honest, I thought she’d get bored and fly off…” Malfoy grabbed his bowl again and started eating, watching Isolt like a movie.</p><p>“Can you help me?” Harry asked politely. </p><p>Malfoy looked at him and continued chewing then swallowed. </p><p>“Please?”</p><p>That made Malfoy sigh, and put down his food. “Fine.” </p><p>Malfoy moved over to Harry’s side. Harry stayed still as Malfoy leaned over, gently petting Isolt into moving onto his arm instead of Harry’s head. Malfoy’s leg bumped into Harry’s, and his breath stopped for a moment. With a sharp nose, he realised that Malfoy still smelt like potions brewing. It reminded him of potions class, but with a lighter, softer tone to it all. </p><p>Finally, Malfoy moved away, Isolt perched happily on his arm. The way Malfoy looked at Isolt was heartwarming. He was so careful and gentle with her. Harry didn’t realise he hadn’t seen them interact before, but the way they were right now showed there wasn’t a single doubt that Malfoy deeply cared for and loved Isolt.</p><p>“Let’s get you back, shall we?” Malfoy said to Isolt and he pet her gently.</p><p>Isolt hooted softly, and flew out the room. Harry assumed that the rattle sound was Isolt in her cage.</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Malfoy nodded, and sat back on the other side of the table.</p><p>“Harry, Molly came today. They’ve heard you’re back from St Mungo’s. She planned a celebration in two weeks.” Malfoy sighed and rubbed his face tiredly. “Actually, she wanted to make it Friday but I told her you’re still recovering.”</p><p>Harry was thankful Malfoy did that. He wasn’t sure if he’d be able to handle a party at the Burrow so soon, but two weeks was manageable. He could do something, maybe get a few memories by then. </p><p>Two weeks would mark 2 months since he woke up and forgot everything from the past 5 years. He didn’t realise he spent so long in St Mungo’s. Time there didn’t feel real. But it was expected. Tina said sometimes he slept for days in between counter-obliviate sessions. </p><p>Harry realised the hands that held his while he slept was Malfoy’s. Harry quickly put that thought away for later. There was another pressing matter at hand.</p><p>“Who will be there?” </p><p>“The entire Weasley family minus Bill and Charlie, Luna, Hermione…”</p><p>“Is Neville coming?”</p><p>“Um, yes. Molly told me she invited him.” </p><p>“That means Nott and Goyle are coming too, right? And Parkinson and Zabini?” </p><p>Malfoy faltered slightly. “Harry, I know you don’t remember them, so if I told them they couldn’t go they would understand. If you don’t want them there then-”</p><p>“No! No,” Harry pleaded. “Bring them there. It’ll be better to get it over with, and it’s a controlled environment anyway, right? I can just floo home if I’m overwhelmed.”</p><p>Malfoy looked at Harry, scanning for anything that would hint of a lie. But nothing did. “Okay. Okay, fine. But Harry, you have to promise me that the moment it becomes overwhelming for you, you find me, okay?”</p><p>Harry didn’t know how to feel about that. Usually, he’d just leave the place himself. But Malfoy looked at him like this promise was the most important thing in the world to him. Harry nodded. </p><p>“Okay. I promise I’ll find you if it becomes overwhelming.” </p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p>The two weeks passed by much of the same. Malfoy either cooked or bought takeout. Harry offered to cook once, but Malfoy stared at him blankly until he stepped out of the kitchen. Harry wasn’t sure why, Harry was a fantastic cook and honestly he missed cooking a lot, and the kitchen slowly started calling to him.</p><p>They also visited Malfoy’s apothecary once during the two weeks. It wasn’t for very long as once it was opened, customers kept coming in and gawking at Harry Potter. Harry apologised profusely to Malfoy before leaving. Malfoy just shook his head and whispered, “Great for business.” </p><p>Harry laughed at that. A long time ago, he would’ve hated it, but Malfoy’s been lighter on the jokes. In fact, he was genuinely funny and had a good sense of humour once you figured it out. </p><p>After the apothecary visit, the Daily Prophet had a field day. Throwing out conspiracy theories as to why ‘The Boy Who Lived to Hide.’ Harry didn’t even get through half of the article before he <em> incendio’ </em>d it, startling Isolt. </p><p>But tonight was the grand celebration at the Burrow. No one has contacted him yet except for Ron and Hermione. Molly hasn’t sent an owl, nor has Neville. He wondered if everyone was gonna be there or if some had other plans.</p><p>Harry stood there, looking at the mess of clothes on his bed. He had absolutely no clue what to wear for a celebration. Usually, celebrations called for semi-formal like that in the Ministry, but it was with the Weasley’s so surely it would be casual, right? So he tried for smart casual, a mix of the two, but nothing coordinated well together. </p><p>“Malfoy!” He called out, hoping this wasn’t a bad idea.</p><p>“Yeah?” A shout from downstairs.</p><p>“I need your help!”</p><p>Quick footsteps, border on running, resounded out the door until Malfoy appeared. Harry looked at him and then rubbed his face in exasperation. Malfoy looked normal, casual with a touch of not trying too hard. It was slightly infuriating. </p><p>“Clothes, right?” </p><p>Harry, face still in his hands, just nodded. He could just imagine the smirk on Malfoy’s face as he walked to stand next to Harry and looked upon the mess of clothes on the bed.</p><p>“Christ, Harry, you’re definitely overthinking this.” </p><p>Harry looked up as Malfoy moved and grabbed a simple red shirt with a golden snitch on it, and black jeans. Malfoy held it out and Harry hesitantly grabbed it. </p><p>“You should just be comfortable,” Malfoy said, with a smile.</p><p>Then he walked out the room, and Harry just watched him. That was weird. For some reason, Harry’s heart was beating out of his chest. The way Malfoy looked, the clothes he chose, the smile and his words, it really made his heart race. </p><p>Once out of the weird trance, Harry cast a tempus. Fuck, they had to leave soon. Harry quickled got changed and ready.</p><p>He quickly ran downstairs to the floo where Malfoy was patiently waiting. Before Harry could grab some powder, Malfoy stopped him. </p><p>“Remember the promise?” </p><p>Harry nodded. “If it’s overwhelming, I’ll find you.” </p><p>Malfoy took a deep breath and sighed. “Okay, ready?”</p><p>“Yep!” </p><p>Harry was filled with anticipation and nervousness. There was every single way this could go wrong, but also every opportunity for this to go so right. He was ready.</p><p>He grabbed a handful of powder and stepped in. “The Burrow!” Malfoy watched as Harry was engulfed by the green flames. </p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p>As Harry walked through the floo and into the Burrow, Harry realised he fucked up. Did they know his memory was gone? Would they still be expecting the Harry they’d gotten used to, and not the one with memory loss?</p><p>Harry stood still, thankful that everyone was still really busy with each other and not noticing Harry yet. Malfoy appeared next to him, and put his hand on his shoulder. Harry immediately narrowed in on the touch. They haven’t really touched, unless you count accidental bumps. They kept their distance from each other, but this touch was definitely with purpose. </p><p>“Are you okay?” Malfoy’s voice broke through him. </p><p>Harry turned and looked at Malfoy. His eyes were filled with worry. </p><p>“Yeah, I’m okay. It’s just… Do they know about my memory?” </p><p>Malfoy visibly relaxed and took his hand off Harry's shoulder. Harry felt the difference. He decided to put that thought in for later. Thoughts for later seemed to pile up. </p><p>“Yeah, they know. Ron, Hermione and I decided it would be easier if they had time to come to terms with it themselves before the celebration. I’m surprised it took you this long to ask.” </p><p>Harry was thankful, though a little annoyed at the slight jab. But Malfoy just smiled back at him, and started walking towards the group of people. </p><p>Harry followed.</p><p>He expected a grand welcoming one way or another, but it didn’t happen. The group just nodded, some saying hi, others nodding hello. They were all surrounding the table filled to the brim with food. Malfoy wasn’t kidding when he told Harry not to eat too much leading up to the dinner. </p><p>Looking around, he realised a lot of the people he was most anxious to meet weren’t there. Theodore Nott and Gregory Goyle were nowhere to be found. Pansy Parkinson was talking to a very intrigued Hermione. Harry heard from Arthur that Blaise Zabini would be coming late due to some happenings at work. Neville Longbottom was there, talking to Ron about Hogwarts.</p><p>A person zoomed by in his peripherals, and with a pounding heart, he realised it was Teddy. Blue haired tiny kid with a snitch plushie in his hand. Andromeda was there too, and she smiled softly at Harry and waved. Harry kinda maybe wanted to cry. </p><p>Teddy was running around, snitch plushie in hand, like nothing meant more than that toy and his speed. Harry wanted to hug him tightly, let him know he missed him and that things would be okay as soon as he remembered. But Harry didn’t want to bring that smile away from his face, so with a will stronger than he thought he had, he continued to look around.</p><p>Everyone was chatting amongst each other, everyone at peace. It seemed, for a moment, that everything was normal. That this was familiar, but it was just a feeling, not a memory. He couldn’t recall a single time something like this would have happened, but it was okay. It was okay. It <em> was </em>okay, right? </p><p>He turned his head and looked at Malfoy who was eyeing all of the guests. For a heartbreaking second, Harry thought Malfoy was on bad terms with everyone. Then he realised that he was reminding them of something. Harry looked back around at how nonchalant everyone was acting. </p><p>Harry realised with a swell in his heart that Malfoy told them all not to overwhelm him.</p><p>Luna popped up beside him, with Malfoy disappearing into a hushed conversation with Ginny. </p><p>“Hello, Harry. My, you’ve changed, haven’t you?” Her voice was as wispy as he remembered.</p><p>“Hi, Luna. Uh, yeah. Malfoy chose these clothes, I was a mess trying to figure it out.” Harry scratched the back of his head.</p><p>“Oh, I don’t mean like that. With your memory gone, you feel much younger.” </p><p>Harry decided not to question it, though in a way, Luna was right. “Thank you. So, how have you been? What are you doing these days?” </p><p>Luna told him all about her life in the past 5 years. They moved around a bit until they sat on the couch, Luna still recalling important parts of her life to things that were more of a flavour text of sorts. </p><p>Harry learnt that Luna wasn’t working with creatures anymore, she was looking into wandmaking after a dream she had about Mr Ollivander. She was working under him, learning about the different cores to the woods, from lengths to designs. She found she loved it a lot more than the creatures, though a part of that would always be in her heart. She still edited for the Quibbler one the side, but more people had come to them for a job, so she wasn’t needed as intensely as before. Her father’s quite ecstatic about it. </p><p>Harry noticed that Molly, Arthur, Andromeda and Teddy were going to the backyard. Teddy was jumping up, as if he was practicing catching a real snitch. It made his heart bloom.</p><p>Ginny arrived towards the end of Luna’s 5 year catchup, sitting next to her. She slipped her hands into Luna’s and held on. The wedding ring glinting on Ginny’s hand. </p><p>“Congratulations on your wedding, by the way! I am so sorry I don’t remember anything about it.” Harry cringed internally at himself with that fact.</p><p>But Luna and Ginny just started laughing softly. </p><p>“Oh, it’s fine, Harry. We could tell you all about that day if you want?” </p><p>Ginny looked excited to recount that day, and Luna just rolled her eyes affectionately while looking at her wife. Harry swallowed the lump that formed at his throat at the pure adoration they had for each other, and nodded.</p><p>It started out normally. Ginny recalling the moments of the actual wedding. Ginny’s best man was Neville, apparently. While Luna’s best man was Malfoy. They recalled how asking them had been a mix of horror and awe. Both of them were excited to be it, while intensely stressing about what it meant. On the day, both Neville and Malfoy did their jobs wonderfully.</p><p>But when it came to the reception, that’s when it got hectic. Ginny would recall someone setting off fireworks early, only for Luna to say they actually went off late. It was getting a little confusing. </p><p>“And when the waiters gave out the food, <em> someone </em> tried to hit on each and every one of them.”</p><p>“No, I didn’t! I was very picky that night,” George chimed in, then went back to his conversation with Arthur.</p><p>“Oh, but that’s not all,” Ginny continued, completely ignoring George. “Ron was really stressed that day, so he was eating more than usual. He kept asking for more food.”</p><p>“Ginny, I wanted more firewhiskey, not food!” Ron chimed in.</p><p>“No, Ron, I distinctly remember it was both.” Blaise Zabini’s deep voice rang through as he brushed the soot off his clothes and walked towards Neville.</p><p>“And so he got more food,” Ginny plowed through. “And then the dessert table was open!”</p><p>“Yeah, and Harry went straight for the treacle tart, didn’t he?” Neville added from the dinner table.</p><p>Harry laughed, a slight blush on his face.</p><p>“I thought he went for the apple pie with treacle ice cream?” Parkinson spoke up from next to Hermione. </p><p>“Don’t forget he got 3 chocolate frogs!” George chimed.</p><p>“And once that dessert table was open, Ron practically sprinted to it.” Ginny kept talking, not responding to anyone, but she did give them time to respond.</p><p>“You’re so lucky the wedding cake wasn’t on that table.” Hermione piped in, smirking at Ron’s astonished face.</p><p>“I wouldn’t have touched the cake, you know me!” Ron said, appalled.</p><p>“Yes, but I don’t think you would’ve noticed the cake at all with how quickly you put things into your mouth.” Malfoy added with a shake of his head,</p><p>“It was a great night, either way. Oh, by the way, when mum and dad danced, it was one hell of a sight.” Ginny said.</p><p>Pretty much everyone groaned at that. Harry was pretty sure he heard Ron say, “And that’s why I wanted whiskey.”</p><p>“Wait, what was the dancing?” Harry asked, amazed at how pretty much everyone looked like they wanted to forget.</p><p>“It was one hell of an experience. Think of it this way,” Ginny looked like she was trying to find the right words. “The both of them were heavily intoxicated, and Celestina Warbeck’s hit single Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love started playing.” </p><p>Ron's face was still in his hands, but he was shaking his head now, mumbling words like, “Oh Merlin,” and “My eyes.” </p><p>Parkinson and Hermione were just watching Ron with a sense of amusement, and Neville and Zabini were just eating, watching everyone with an amused smile.</p><p>Ginny, living in the suspense she was building up, continued. “And then they-”</p><p>“AND THEN THEY MADE ME SING WITH THEM!” Ron yelled, then immediately covered his mouth, shocked at his outburst.</p><p>"YOU RUINED MY MOMENT!" Ginny shouted.</p><p>Everyone burst out laughing as Ginny motioned cutting Ron's neck while Ron’s face slowly matched his hair. </p><p>Harry didn’t know the dance, but he definitely knew the song. He couldn’t imagine Ron singing it at all, let alone at a wedding reception with his parents beside him. </p><p>Once Ginny finished laughing, she went straight back to it. “Oh man, but you’d think that was it, right? Ron got the easy part, he just had to lip sing.” </p><p>“Easy part?!” Ron whispered, looking at Hermione and Parkinson who were still laughing.</p><p>“Mum and dad were the <em> dancers </em>. And-”</p><p>But she was cut off with a smack to her head. </p><p>“Not another word out of your mouth about that,” Molly adamanted. “Out of all the things to talk about, it had to be that moment.” She shook her head and starting walking back to the kitchen.</p><p>Arthur was at the entryway of the room, his face in a cringe. </p><p>Ginny apologised, but once Arthur and Molly were out of the room she quickly finished. “And they completed the dance perfectly. I wish I could forget it.” </p><p>Everyone began laughing again. Even Harry laughed too, maybe his memory being gone wasn’t <em> too </em> bad if everything could be recalled like that. </p><p>The conversation ended quickly after that. Ginny and Luna were talking to each other now, and everyone else had started going back to their respective conversations. Then he watched as Zabini fist-bumped Neville and walked over to Malfoy talking to George. </p><p>With haste, Harry walked over to Neville. Neville was one of the many who had changed a lot throughout the past 5 years. He wanted to know his development too.</p><p>“Hey, Neville. How’ve you been?”</p><p>“Hey, Harry. I’ve been doing great. Hogwarts has been great, oh and guess what,” Neville said with a bright smile.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I’m head of Gryffindor!”</p><p>Pride swelled in his chest. He could recall the Neville from 1st year, high in doubt, low in self esteem, now he’s head of Gryffindor. “Neville, that’s great! I’m so happy for you.”</p><p>Neville’s smile never left his face. “Thank you. It’s old news, about 2 years, but I’ll never get sick of telling people. I’m glad I got to tell you again.”</p><p>Harry was touched by that. “Can’t imagine any other professor getting that role. Look at you, Herbology professor AND head of Gryffindor.” He was immensely proud of Neville. “So, how’s Nott and Goyle? I heard you’re dating them?” </p><p>Neville’s smile got even brighter if that was possible. He nodded. “Yeah, for about 3 and a half years? They’re amazing, I could talk about them all day.” </p><p>“They better be treating you well, or I’ll fight them.” Harry said, dead serious.</p><p>But Neville didn’t take it, he just laughed. “No need, they treat me like a king.” Neville kept smiling. “And I, them.”</p><p>“Good,” Harry said as he started getting some food from the table and into his plate.</p><p>“Y’know Harry, I was so worried about it at first. How could I have such intense feelings for both of them? How could it work? But it did, and it is, and I love it.”</p><p>“What’re they doing these days?”</p><p>“Oh, Nott’s an author, he’s written a lot of books. All that romance stuff. ‘Easy for him to do,’ he says. ‘I’ve got two boyfriends.’ Goyle works in a repair shop in Hogsmeade. He repairs enchanted stuff like charmed mirrors and picture frames that got all weird, but he’s also really good at making things.” </p><p>Harry listened in awe and Neville continued on about his relationship. How they’d meet up at least once a week. They’re schedules weren’t usually synced, but with Hogsmeade trips and Nott’s organisation skills, they made it work. It was lovely to hear, and he was happy for Neville. Really. Everything was going great for him. </p><p>But Harry couldn’t help but feel an ache in his chest grow a little bit more. </p><p>He looked around and saw Ron and Hermione sitting together, looking over the room. It didn’t seem like they were speaking. Then Ron’s eyes landed on Harry, and he beckoned him over. </p><p>Harry walked over, grabbing a spare seat and sat next to Ron.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Nothing, just watch, and relax. We thought you’d need a little break.” Ron smiled at him, then looked back.</p><p>It was peaceful, watching the movement of the room from a wall’s perspective. Everyone moved around, catching up and sharing stories they wanted to tell. There were a lot of people, and a lot of stories, but it just worked. It worked so well.</p><p>Harry didn’t need to catch up on Hermione and Ron’s past 5 years. That was one of the things they talked about in the weeks he was in hospital.</p><p>Ron was head auror, and rightfully so. Through training, Ron developed his strategic mind, one Harry knew he had from the beginning with Wizard’s Chess. Ron was careful, and logical, and moved without recklessness compared to Harry’s instincts of ‘now or never.’ Harry couldn’t imagine anyone else being head auror. He knew Ron doubted his qualifications for the role, but Ron was brave, noble and respectful. He was perfect for the position.</p><p>Hermione was Minister of Magic, he knew, and at least he could remember. She was great. She passed law after law that brought the people together. She had a ban on sleeping draughts after the war as people started getting addicted, and the healthcare was more welcoming. Healers got more patients, people got better. She lifted the ban, and nothing went terribly wrong. </p><p>She passed the law for same sex wizard marriages, and created gateways for squibs to be introduced into the magical world, and for wizards to learn about the muggle. Harry was amazed at how much she’d completed in the 5 years. But at the same time, it was Hermione, filled with determination and courage. </p><p>A thought came into his head, and he asked the question before he realised it. “How do you two handle a relationship with your high role jobs?”</p><p>Ron and Hermione turned to him in surprise. Hermione started off first. </p><p>“Well, sometimes I postpone meetings to spend time with him.” Hermione smiled. “It was hard at first. I have a lot of things to do, from meetings to interviews, from speeches to discussions with other wizarding ministries. But we make time, and it’s always worth it.” </p><p>Ron nodded. “Yeah, and sometimes lookouts take days until we get the information we need. There’s no consistency and it’s hard to plan, but I send my patronus to her, telling her I love her and all. Other times, when I get home we plan an instant date.” </p><p>Harry’s heart ached even more, and this time he knew it was on his face.</p><p>“Is everything okay?” Hermione asked, worry all over her face.</p><p>“What? Yeah, everything is okay.” Harry smiled half heartedly. “It’s just everyone has their life figured out, and I must’ve had mine like that too. Now it feels like I’m back at step one.”</p><p>It wasn’t the answer Hermione was looking for, and Harry wasn’t ready to give that answer yet, but he wasn’t lying either.</p><p>“Mate, you got there before, you can do it again. Besides, does it look like you’re gonna do this alone?” Ron gestured to the room.</p><p>Harry looked around at the room. He noticed Malfoy looked up, and smiled at Harry before going back to his conversation with Zabini.</p><p>“Not everyone is here, but we’re all here with you every step of the way. We’re here to help. It’s a shitty situation but, y’know, we can handle it.” Ron smiled and jokingly punched Harry’s arm.</p><p>“We’re always just a call away, you know that, right?” Hermione added.</p><p>“Yeah. I know.” Harry smiled. </p><p>It wasn’t what was really on his mind, but it did make him feel better. Who cares if everyone’s love life was secure and Harry felt insecure and jealous? It’s fine because they’re all still together, still friends.</p><p>But when Ron and Hermione held each other’s hands, and saw Ron squeeze just the tiniest bit, Harry wanted to run.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p>A few hours later, everyone was still chatting amongst each other happily. Molly, Arthur, Andromeda and Teddy were back in the room since it was too dark to play outside anymore, despite the <em> lumos maxima. </em> </p><p>He talked to Andromeda for a bit. Harry found out that Andromeda wasn’t working anymore, her vaults being generous enough anyway. He hugged her tightly, and didn’t quite want to let go just yet. But he did, and he just smiled and thanked her for taking care of Teddy.</p><p>Harry finally built up the courage to talk to Teddy, but he was never free. Teddy was bouncing from wall to wall, person to person. One moment, he was with Neville talking about plants and the next he was with Zabini talking about how to pose for a photo. </p><p>It never seemed like the right time to go to Teddy, so he hung around the dinner table. He ate the treacle tart that was put out a few moments ago, savouring the taste. Then Luna popped up next to him.</p><p>“Hey, Harry. Have you seen Ron? Ginny’s looking for him. She’s gonna play Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love, but he needs to be in the room when she plays it.” She picked up one of the chocolate brownies from the table.</p><p>“No, I haven’t seen him. Do you-”</p><p>“Luna, my love, come here! We need a gameplan.” Ginny’s voice travelled from across the room.</p><p>“I’ll look for him, you go.”</p><p>Luna smiled gratefully at him, and moved over to Ginny. Harry started walking around the house. He checked the kitchens, the bathrooms, all the rooms inside but Ron wasn’t there. </p><p>Harry then looked at the backyard door, and went to it. He was about to open it when he heard Malfoy’s voice.</p><p>“-don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m drowning. I’m worried sick. I’m trying to hide it so he doesn’t worry. There’s already enough on his plate, but I’m so worn out. I don’t know what to do. What if he doesn’t like me anymore? What if he remembers but realises he doesn’t love me anymore?” </p><p>Harry’s hand left the handle, and dropped to his side. </p><p>“He loved you once, he can do it again.” It was Ron’s voice.</p><p>“Yeah, but… It’s <em> me.</em>”</p><p>“That’s why he’ll love you again.”</p><p>Malfoy sighed sadly.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Ron’s voice was dripping with regret.</p><p>“Why are you apologising?” Malfoy asked, similarly to the way he asked Harry before.</p><p>“Because,” Ron’s voice cracked. “Because it was my fault. If I had just gotten there quicker, if I had just told him to wait, then…” </p><p>There was a sudden noise, and with a heavy heart, Harry realised it was Ron breaking down. Then another noise layered on top. There were whispers, but Harry couldn’t make out the words. Either way, he didn’t need to hear more. </p><p>Ron and Malfoy were crying outside, comforting each other. There were many moments when Harry realised that this entire situation was real, that everything he’d missed out on was real and not some sick joke. This might’ve been the most intense one yet.</p><p>He felt himself sway as he stepped away from the door. He wants to run, or cry, or both. The gift from the heavens she is, Hermione appeared beside him on his way to the kitchen. She held his hand as she led the way. </p><p>Hermione sat down on an empty chair, and motions for Harry to as well. He almost declines, but Hermione says, “You look like you’re able to fall down.” </p><p>So he sits.</p><p>“What happened?” Hermione's voice was gentle, not pushing too much.</p><p>“I still don’t know who I am, that’s what’s happening. No memories have come back yet. I’ve been told stories the entire day about things I should remember, dates that were important, events that meant the world to them. I’m losing my mind, Hermione, and it’s already been chipped away.” </p><p>“Harry, it’s only been 2 months. You need to give yourself time.”</p><p>“Time? I just lost 5 years of it, does it look like I need to lose some more of it? I should be doing something more. But I’m here, at a party with some people I don’t even remember befriending…” Harry trailed off, feeling the back of his eyes sting, and the slow closing off of his throat.</p><p>Hermione grabs a glass of water and gives it to him as he tries to hold back his tears. He holds it, but doesn’t drink. He just looks into it. His shaking hands distort his reflection, making him look slightly different, warped, but still recognisable in a weird way. He blinks away his tears and looks up at Hermione.</p><p>“Who am I?”</p><p>He’s wanted to ask her this before. It’s Hermione. She’s always had an answer for everything, and if she didn’t, she’d spend all her efforts looking for one. Ever since he met her, she seemed to hold all knowledge. </p><p>Instead, she just smiled sadly at Harry. “Well, you’re Harry James Potter. Son of James and Lily Potter. Partner to Draco Malfoy. Godfather to Teddy Remus Lupin. You’ve got a large array from friends who would proudly stand by your side through anything.” </p><p>Hermione moved to hug him as Harry’s tears started falling. </p><p>“You’re a good friend that is loyal and trustworthy. You’ve stared death in the eye and walked back. You’re brave and kind. You love with all your heart. You’re great at Quidditch, played seeker on the Gryffindor team in Hogwarts. You were there at Ginny and Luna’s wedding. You were there at every birthday party held for your friends.” </p><p>Hermione pulled away, and gestured for Harry to drink the water. He did, and felt a million times better.</p><p>“You’re Harry, and that’s all you need to be. No matter what, memories or not.” </p><p>Harry wiped away the tears on his cheek and nodded. He felt better, the pep talk really helped. He was so glad to vent it all out too, all his worries and fears this far into the recovery. His physical body was fine now, it was just his mind left. </p><p>Before he could even turn his body to get out of the kitchen, Teddy leaped in, snitch plushie still in hand. Teddy took one look at Harry, and tilted his head.</p><p>Harry’s fear spiked, but when Teddy quickly moved to hug his legs, it went down just as quickly. Harry carded his fingers through the blue hair. Teddy let go and put both of his hands up. Harry took this to mean he wanted to be carried.</p><p>Harry lifted him up with ease. Teddy was still a toddler, but he knew that there was only a limited time left until Teddy couldn’t be carried like this anymore. Teddy’s arms wrapped around Harry’s neck, and he looked at him with big wide eyes.</p><p> “Are you okay?” Teddy asked.</p><p>Harry kissed Teddy’s cheek and held him tighter. “Yeah, I’m okay.”</p><p>And for the first time in a long time, he meant it. </p><p> </p>
