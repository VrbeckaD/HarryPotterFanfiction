    <p>Credence was running for his life, as fast as his feet could carry him and his lungs were about to explode after sprinting down the streets in the middle of the night.</p><p>Behind him, he could hear the sound of claws against pavement and the snarling of a hungry beast.</p><p>He was turning a corner when his shoe slipped on something and Credence went crashing down. He hit the pavement hard, grunted with pain at the impact, and had just enough time to roll over on his back and see the black shape come flying towards him.</p><p>“No!” Credence held out his hands in a defensive move, managing to hold back the massive creature and its deadly fangs with his palms against its hairy chest. “Nonono, please, no! Don’t do this!” He jerked his head away from the teeth trying to tear his face off. “You don’t want to do this! Please!”</p><p>The beast was incredibly heavy and one of its claws was digging into his side as it tried to get closer.</p><p>Credence realized with a stab of fear that his arms were giving in, the beast was just too heavy and too strong. “Joe, please, you have to listen to me! Don’t do this!”</p><p>There was a flash of bright light and suddenly the beast collapsed on top of him, nearly squeezing the air out of Credence. With no small amount of strain, Credence pushed it off and he sat up to glare at the man who came walking towards him like he was sauntering down a fashion catwalk. “Why did you do that?”</p><p>“Because,” Percival Graves said as he came to halt next to them and he pocketed his wand with an elegant move, “he was about to eat you. I told you; werewolves cannot be reasoned with!”</p><p>Looking over at the unconscious shape, Credence frowned while still catching his breath. “I don’t believe that! They’re human, most of the time. They’re not monsters, Percival. No more than I am!”</p><p>Graves held out his hand and pulled him to his feet, studying him briefly for bruises or worse; dirt from the street. “You don’t want to rip people’s throats out every full moon.”</p><p>“No, I just destroyed half of New York because I was angry with you,” Credence shot back with a dry look. His heart was still pounding.</p><p>“You just didn’t know how to control your powers.”</p><p>“And maybe no one has taught them how to either!” Credence looked down at the hairy shape on the ground. “If people treat you like a monster, it’s dangerously easy to become one.”</p><p>“You can add it in your report,” Percival drawled with a slight grin. He kneeled down next to the werewolf and placed a hand on it; disapparating them both back to headquarters.</p><p>Credence smiled a little, still high on adrenaline from the chase and warm with satisfaction that they had yet another successful mission on their file.<br/>
No more people would get hurt, he would try to talk to their prisoner once he turned human again and London was little safer thanks to the combined effort of Credence Barebone and Percival Graves! He pulled out his wand and disapparated back to the office.</p><p>-</p><p>Graves handed over the prisoner and headed back to his office at a quick pace. He knew Credence would be waiting there and he was still uneasy at the memory of that werewolf chasing down his partner. He should never have agreed to let Credence try his diplomatic shit first.<br/>
No more Creature Rights magazines for that Auror!</p><p>Ignoring the usual gang of slack-jawed idiots milling around in the main area, Percival entered his office and closed the door behind him. As expected, Credence was there and had his back towards him while leafing through some files.</p><p>Graves stepped up behind him, sliding his arms around his waist and sighing against his neck. </p><p>Credence leaned back against him with a satisfied sound, continuing to look through the pages. “Whoever you are, we’d better hurry. My boss will be here at any moment.”</p><p>When Credence bent to put the files down, Percival followed and leaned heavily on him, forcing him to drop the files and plant his palms on the desk. Even knowing it was a joke, he resented the very idea of Credence being touched by anyone but him, and judging by the breathy laugh from the younger man; that was exactly the reaction he was aiming for.</p><p>Graves nuzzled his neck for a moment, suddenly hating the expensive suit that kept him from the skin, but he quickly turned Credence’s laugh to a heady moan when teeth replaced lips. He kept one arm around his waist, holding Credence close, the other hand moved to all sorts of vulnerable areas; throat, nipples, abdomen and finally cupping the half-hard prize between the younger man’s legs.</p><p>By then, Credence was close to panting again, squirming restlessly in his grasp. “If you insist on doing the report before me, I swear, Percival, I will murder you! I’m warning you, I will go full Obscurus!”</p><p>Now it was Graves’ turn to laugh and he gave a teasing squeeze before there was a flash of magic and they apparated in their apartment. “The report can wait. Just this once.”</p><p>The triumphant smile on Credence’s face as he was manhandled back on the bed would have annoying on anyone else, but now Percival was just amazed at the confidence and trust in that smile. How far Credence had come from the cowering thing he’d met on the streets in New York! Then, Percival made both the smile and the clothes disappear with his clever hands and wicked mouth.</p><p>After a short while, Credence eagerly moved over to settle himself on his hands and knees and Graves was just too happy to oblige. He would usually expose the younger man to a slow, torturous round for his audacity, but Credence had wound him up too much this time. That, combined the chase, had left him with energy to burn.</p><p>Percival pushed into him and gave him the hard pace that would always make Credence’s arms give in and leave him moaning into the mattress. This time was no exception.</p><p>“Show me,” Graves ordered in a strained voice. “Show me how much you love this.”</p><p>Keening into the sheets, Credence obeyed. Black smoke was soon seeping from his skin, loose objects in the room began to rattle and Percival couldn’t stop to save his life.<br/>
By the time they both collapsed on the bed, running with sweat and thoroughly sated, Graves suspected this would eventually be the death of him and he couldn’t think of a better way to go!</p><p>-</p><p>Early next morning, Credence had the fortune of waking up first. He squirmed over on his other side to watch the sleeping man next to him.</p><p>It was rare for him to wake first, but it was even rarer for Percival Graves to be deep in a peaceful sleep. Usually the man would be restless or in the claws of nightmares, which he would brush off as nothing, but Credence wished he could do something so Percival would always be this calm.</p><p>He looked like a completely different man without his tense and stern expression. Credence smiled a little and ached to reach out to touch him, but knew he was a very light sleeper and would wake up.</p><p>Predictably, the luxury didn’t last long and soon after, Percival opened his eyes.</p><p>Finding himself ogled, he frowned a little with confusion then grunted and rolled over on his back to sleepily rub his face. “Stop that.”</p><p>Credence grinned. “I can’t help it. You’re so gorgeous.”</p><p>Graves made a sound that voiced his agreement with that statement. He sat up with a sigh, pulling his hands through his hair to sleek it back how he wanted it. “Coffee.”</p><p>“I’ll get it,” Credence declared, jumping out of bed and headed for the kitchen. As silly as it sounded, he loved these moments they had in the mornings. Usually their days were filled and kept them awfully busy; the mornings were the only time where Credence got to see Percival as relaxed as he could be, while conscious, and they were allowed to be themselves.</p><p>Making breakfast with a couple of waves with his wand, Credence focused on the only thing he always made sure to make with his own two hands; Percival’s coffee. When he returned to the bedroom, he found the other man sitting up in bed, leaning against a small mountain of pillows and going through a work report.</p><p>“No work,” Credence chided, crawling back into bed with the coffee cup and a breakfast trey hovering after him.</p><p>Nodding, Percival closed the file and put it on the nightstand. It was the one rule Credence had been set on; no work after work hours. It had puzzled Graves at first, then he’d struggled to follow it, but now he could see the advantage of it. He’d reluctantly admitted it was nice to have something other than work to focus on.</p><p>“Thank you,” Percival said, accepting his cup of coffee and held on to it with both hands for his first sip, much like a man lost in a desert handed water. It made Credence smile again. </p><p>They had their breakfast in peace and quiet, had small moments of gentle teasing and dwelling affection, but soon enough they were headed for the office.</p><p>Credence exchanged a final glance with Graves in the main area before they were going to split up and head to their separate offices, dreaming about how they had next weekend off and how he planned to keep the man captured in their apartment for the duration of it, when a sudden ruckus caught their attention.</p><p>As always, Graves took one protective step in front of Credence and the two saw and heard a person argue their way past the other Aurors. It ended with an elderly lady in a fancy hat and a huge dark dress coming to a halt in the center of the main area, eyeing them all with distaste. “Where is he? Where is my grandson?”</p><p>-</p><p>For a moment, everyone looked at each other and the woman with equal amounts of confusion, forcing Graves to take charge, once again.</p><p>“Can I help you, Ma’am?” Percival eyed her warily, taking in what seemed to be expensive clothes and a very confident stance. “Are you lost?”</p><p>The woman turned her sharp eyes on him, frowning a little. Eventually she took a step closer, making him move fully in front of Credence, and she measured Graves from his shoes to his precious hair. “You’re a Graves,” she stated in a clearly American accent. “I can tell by your taste in fine clothing and your eyebrows.”</p><p>Blinking, Percival allowed himself a moment to process her words before he cleared his throat. “Ma’am, what is it that you want?”</p><p>At that moment, Credence popped up to steal a peek over Graves’ shoulder and she pointed an almost accusing finger at the young man. “Him.”</p><p>“Me?” Credence squeaked, ducking down behind Percival again.</p><p>“Him?” Graves asked, tensing up and channeling magic into his hands. “Why?”</p><p>“I was told a former Auror had gotten a hold of my grandchild and had run off to London with him,” the woman said. “I’ve come to fetch him.”</p><p>“You will have to go through me first,” Graves declared with a deceptively soft voice, now humming with latent magic he was aching to unleash. “Now, get out and don’t let me see your face again. You only get one warning!”</p><p>Strangely enough, that made the woman give a sharp but amused smile. “Well… You certainly have a protective streak in you, don’t you?” </p><p>Credence inched forward to stand next to Percival, placing a gentle hand on his arm to calm him down. “Easy, Percival. I don’t think she means any harm…”</p><p>Scoffing, Graves didn’t take his eyes off the older woman. “Are you saying you trust some random lamia who rattled in from the street?”</p><p>“Of course not,” Credence replied, daring to glance over at the woman. “But let’s hear what she has to say first.”</p><p>There was a tense stand-off, until Percival finally gave a faint nod. He waved a hand at one of the Aurors. “Take her to the interrogation room.” As reluctant he was to have anything to do with strangers who came spouting nonsense, Graves also saw the fragile curiosity in Credence’s eyes. Curiosity and even some hope.</p><p>Credence’s past was a mystery to the both of them but Percival knew the odds of it being solved by a woman appearing out of nowhere, was close to zero. Mary Lou had left nothing to indicate the identity of Credence’s mother, making it impossible for them to track down his family, so who was this stranger claiming to be his grandmother?</p><p>-</p><p>Following the Aurors leading the old woman down the hall towards the interrogation room, Graves halted outside the door. “Let me…” “Do the talking,” Credence finished for him, “I know.”</p><p>Percival nodded and headed inside. Credence followed. He chose to stand behind Graves while he sat down in the chair opposite of where the woman was seated by a table.</p><p>“Okay,” Percival said. “Talk. And you’d better not be wasting my time, Ma’am.”</p><p>The woman gave another one of her tight, sharp smiles. “My name is Regina Broadchurch. You know my family, Mr. Graves, surely.” She glanced briefly at Credence before focusing on Graves again. “I had three sons, Mr. Graves, and I lost them all in the war. All I had left was my daughter Violetta. She took the loss of her brothers hard and sought to find some meaning in what had happened. Unfortunately, this placed her in the path of a cruel man who claimed that being a wizard was a curse. He created quite a following and enticed my daughter to come with him. I only learned of her having a child and her death a year after he had put her in the ground.” </p><p>Credence realized he was holding his breath as the woman talked. This could be his family story! He noted how Mrs. Broadchurch tried to speak calmly and efficiently, but there was nothing fake about the pain in her eyes.</p><p>“What makes you think Mr. Barebone is your daughter’s child?” Percival asked in a dry tone.</p><p>“One of the man’s most devoted followers was Ms. Mary Lou Barebone. I heard she kept preaching the man’s hatred after he perished as well and took in children to carry on his legacy. I was told the child was male and the age fits. As does his appearance.”</p><p>This time, when she looked up at him, Credence couldn’t prevent a faint smile from appearing at the mere idea that this could finally be the answer to questions he’d been asking himself his entire life; why had his parents abandoned him? Why had they handed him over to a monster like Mary Lou?</p><p>Percival got up, snapping both Mrs. Broadchurch and Credence out of their reverie and he gestured towards the door. “I will investigate your claim, Mrs. Broadchurch. I’m going to ask you to leave now and stay away. I will contact you. Do not make any effort to contact Mr. Barebone or I will assume you are lying and make sure you never see him again.”</p><p>Tutting, Mrs. Broadchurch got up from her chair. “Very protective indeed.” She sent Credence a knowing look and with what could only be called a smirk. “I will wait, now that I know my grandson is being well looked after by his… friend. You will find me at the closest hotel.”</p><p>Flushing, Credence ducked his head a little as she left the room in a soft rustle of skirts and only then did he glance over at Percival. “Do you think…?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Percival mumbled thoughtfully, still looking at the doorway. “The Broadchurch family is one of the older ones and I have heard her name before, but still…” He sent him an apologetic look. “Don’t get your hopes up, okay?”</p><p>Credence nodded, but he feared it was probably too late.</p><p>They were both lost in thought as they headed back to the main area and was surprised to find Theseus Scamander there.<br/>
“Hello boys,” he greeted them. “I need to have a word. With both of you. In your office, Percy.”</p>
