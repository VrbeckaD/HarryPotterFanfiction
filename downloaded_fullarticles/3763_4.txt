Why is there a paw where my hand should be?</p><p>Harry: Because you were cursed –</p><p>Draco: And why was I cursed?</p><p>Harry sighed: Because I was standing next to you.</p><p>Draco: Ruddy Potter and his fame!</p><p>Harry spluttered: Fame?!</p><p>(Draco calls being chased by dark wizards all the time fame?!</p><p>But as always, Draco pretended to hear nothing.)</p><p>Draco: Tell me Potter, how many famous pawed potioneers have you heard of?</p><p>Harry: None?</p><p>(Harry hasn't been keeping check after any famous potioneers, but it seemed like the answer Draco was fishing for.)</p><p>Draco: None!</p><p>Harry: Hermione said it'll go away after three days –</p><p>Draco: I heard what Granger said! First of all – why are we taking her word for it? She's not even a healer –</p><p>Harry: She's Hermione! (Harry disagreed heatedly, as though that was explanation enough – and it was.
