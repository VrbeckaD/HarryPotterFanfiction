    <p>Harry wake up in Grimmauld Place. When Ron and Hermione coming in his room to wake him up. To tell him about what was going on down stairs.<br/>"Harry you will never guess what has happened." said Hermione<br/>"No Mione I don't I just wake up. So why don't you just tell me." Harry said a little iterated with being waken up.<br/>"Well Dumbledore found a woman in the middle of the Great Hall. She was passed out, but she wasn't breathing and really pail. She also looks like she's in the early 20's." Hermione said.<br/>"Dose anyone know how she got there?" Harry asked leaning up with his legs and arms crossed on his bed.<br/>"No, but I overheard my mum say that she just showed up in the Great Hall during dinner. They said she arrived in the blinding red light. Then they brought her here. She is with Poppy now." Ron told both of them.<br/>Meanwhile in the sitting room with Dumbledore, Sirius, and Ramus. Sirius is passing back and forth.<br/>"Sirius my boy, would you tell me what is troubling you." Asked the Headmaster.<br/>Sirius plopped on the couch next to Mooney, and sighed.<br/>"Well I'm just a little nerve about what Poppy will say." Sirius said.<br/>"I know my boy I know. I am nerves as well." Told the Headmaster.<br/>Just them Poppy comes into the sitting room. She looked tired. As soon as they see her they jump to their feet to ask her question.<br/>"Poppy what can you tell us about are new guest?" Asked the Headmaster.<br/>"Well to be honest she's dieing. She is a vampire. You see it looks like she hasn't feed in a while. There could be two explanations to it. One would be she was drained, or two would be the most extraordinary point" Poppy paused a few minutes. "Either she has been asleep for a very long while."<br/>"What would be your best guess Poppy?" Asked Mooney.<br/>"Well Ramus I would say she has been asleep. The only way for sure is to wake her up." Said Poppy.<br/>"What do you think we should do Poppy?" Asked the Headmaster with idea of the next move.<br/>"We need to find a willing vampire to give her there blood. That would be enough to wake her up. Then she can feed on anything afterwards. Would you happen to know one Albus?" Poppy asked.<br/>The headmaster looked at Poppy and started to think. The only vampire that he knew was Snape. He had to somehow get him to do this. He had to start to think of a way to get him here, and get him to do it willing.<br/>"I do know of one. I don't know if he will do it." Stated the Headmaster.<br/>"Well get him here at once." Said Poppy.<br/>"Yes Poppy whatever you say." The Headmaster said while getting up to fire call Snape.<br/>The Potion Master is having a cup of blood tea in front of the fireplace when the Headmaster's head comes in the fire.<br/>"What can I do for you Headmaster?" Snape said.<br/>"Well my boy. I need you to come to headquarters and be willing to give some of your blood to a very sick vampire. We have here. She was found in the Great Hall. Poppy says that she has been asleep for a very long time, and she is dieing if we don't do something soon. So will you come and help?" The Headmaster explained to Snape.<br/>Snape thought for a few minutes. The only vampire that slept like that was the first. But that could never be her. She is dead everyone knows that. But what if everyone was wrong and she is alive (so to speak).<br/>"I'll be right there." Told Snape.<br/>They ended to fire call. Snape got what he needed from his rooms. In the fireplace he went to get to Grimmauld Place. He comes out of the fireplace. He comes face to face with the Headmaster, Black, Poppy, and the Werewolf. Wondering what he was doing there, because the Headmaster didn't tell them they he was coming.<br/>Snape walks over to the Headmaster.<br/>"Albus what is he doing here?" Asked Sirius.<br/>'Let the games begin. This is going to be fun.' Snape thought to himself.<br/>"Albus why don't you take me to why I am here." Snape asks.<br/>"Okay follow me Severus. Albus said while getting up and walking out the door with Severus.<br/>Severus walks into the room, and stops to place. He just can't stop himself from staring at a beautiful woman on the bed. She had long black hair, pale skin. She was just breath taking to look at.<br/>Snape walked over to her to get a better look at her. He didn't know for sure if this was the first. But he was willing to find out. He leaned next to the bed. He brought his wrist up to his mouth, and cut his wrist. He then opened her mouth to put his wrist to it so she could feed. As soon as the blood get in her mouth. She garbed his wrist for more control. As soon as she got her fill. (Also so not to kill him). She let go of his arm.<br/>A few minutes later she opened her eyes. She turned her head to see Severus looking at her.<br/>"Young one. Thank you for awaking me. What year is it?" The elder vampire asked.<br/>"Well my lady it is the year 2008." Snape told her.<br/>"WOW." Was all she could say.<br/>She than looked at the other people in the room than back at Severus.<br/>The Headmaster steps closer to the bad that she was laying in.<br/>"Now my dear girl. I have some questions for you. If you don't mind." The Headmaster asked smoothly.<br/>"What would you like to know young one."<br/>"Well for one. Who are you? How did you get in the Great Hall?" The Headmaster asked.<br/>"Well my name is Alexandria. I was sleeping for about 1000 years or so. I only wake when the world needs me, or when my children need me. Which one do you think it could be?" She asked<br/>"You still didn't answer why you were in the Great Hall."<br/>"There is a simple asker there. My sleeping chamber is in the school. My children put me there, because that place would be the safest place for me while I sleted. Dose that answer your question because I'm hungry."<br/>The headmaster just looked at her like she was crazy. He had never heard anything like this before. He had to find a way to use this. Just like the way he is using young Harry Potter.<br/>The Headmaster was making plans to get Alexandria on his side. He just couldn't pass up this golden opportunity. He had to find a way to control her. He just didn't know how. If he was able to control her than she would be a better weapon then Harry Potter.<br/>What the Headmaster didn't know was that Alexandria knew why she was awakened, but she had no intention on telling anyone. Not until it was with the one that needed her. She would only talk to her donor as well as the one that called her.<br/>She was very weary of the Headmaster. She wasn't able to see into his mind. That made her very worried. Not for her own life, but the life of her children. You see no matter what you do to her she cannot be killed. That is why she is the first. She was just waiting until the right time. Then she would call her children to her side.<br/>Alexandria walked back into Grimmauld Place after her first feeding. Feeling better than she did ever before her feeding. She just kept a smile o her face. No one could figure out why she had a smile on her face. They all thought that it was from just feeding, but Snape know better. She has been talking to him telepathically. Since she was awaken by him. It happened to the one that awoke from her sleep.<br/>Flashback<br/>Snape was sitting in the sitting room of Grimmauld Place. <br/>"My child I know you can hear me. You probably know who I am if not. I am the awaken. My child I know that you know what is going on. Please tell me the truth. About the state that my world is in. If you ever want to talk to me. Just speak with your mind I will hear you." Alexandria said to him. <br/>"Empress is that really you. Please tell me that it is you?" Snape asked a little scared for the first time in a long while.<br/>"Yes my child it is I."<br/>"What would like to know?" Snape asked nerveless.<br/>"I want to know what the state of the world is in. I want to know your thoughts in this whole situation. I need to know everything." The Empress stated to Snape. <br/>"All right first thing is that we are fighting a war with the Dark Lord Voldamort, but he isn't who you should be worried about him maybe evil. He has good ideas. I think you may want to talk to him, and see for yourself. The one you must be worried about is the Headmaster. He is a very manipulative bastard. He is using a young boy as him pawn, and is planning on letting him die. His name is Harry Potter. I may not like him but no child should be used as a weapon. Harry has been very independent and the Headmaster has put a lot of spells on him. So that doesn't happen. Please save him Empress? I have a feeling that when he comes into his inheritance he will be my mate. I don't know how, but I just can feel it. Is that what you needed to know Empress?" Snape told her.<br/>"Yes that is exactly what I am looking for. I will save this Harry Potter. I also know he is your mate. He is one of us. He has my blood in him. He is one of the children from my own blood line. He will have two mates. One will be you, and the other will be someone with the name of Tom Riddle. We most find him so you all can mate at the same time. Or all will be lost. Do you know how to find this man?"<br/>"Yes I do Empress. It is the Dark Lord. I just don't know how he will take it."<br/>"I doesn't matter he will want it to happen just as you will be. Now go and tell him and prepare for are arrive. Be quick my child we don't have much time."<br/>"Yes Empress right away." Snape said while he was getting up from his chair and walking to the fire place and floos to Riddle Manor. <br/>End Flashback<br/>Alexandria walks into the library to find Harry. She sees him sitting at a table in the corner of the room. He has his head down on his arms asleep. He was also mumbling in his sleep.<br/>It looked to her that he was having a bad dream. She walked over to him putting her arm around him to confront him. Like a mother would a small child. He starts to wake up. He looks up at her. She has a smile on her face which he returns. He tries to get up but can't. She keeps a firm hold on him.<br/>She leans down to his ear" Harry there is something I must tell you on midnight on your birthday you will come into your inheritance. You will become a vampire or more known as a day walker. You have my blood in you so in other words I am your grandmother." She pauses for a minute "You will also have two mates one is Severus Snape, and the other is Tom Riddle. I was told he is the Dark Lord. Let me tell you the reason the killing curse didn't kill you was because he is your mate. He can't kill or hurt you because he is your mate. So don't worry about that. Do you understand my child?"<br/>Harry can only nodded his head. He was starting to understand.<br/>"Severus is telling the Dark Lord. We have to get you out of here ether before your inheritance or right after. It will be very painful, but if you have your mates with you it won't to be so bad. Your birthday is tomorrow am I correct?"<br/>"Yes it is. How will I know if he will accept me as his mate? He has been trying to kill be for the past 3 years. I do accept this. I will be there mate if they want me."<br/>She just looks down at him. 'So he accepts his fate. Now all I have to do is get him there.'<br/>"Harry do you want your mates to help you throw your inheritance tonight?"<br/>"Yes. Only if they want to help me that is."<br/>"Good as soon as Severus gets back to me will tell you. I will also speak to him about them helping you throw your inheritance."<br/>"How will you do that?"<br/>"Well since I am the first I can speak to anyone of my children throw my mind. No matter where they are. You are just not like the rest of my children. They might have my blood line, but you have it from me and my offspring. You are my grandson they are just my children. Do you understand? You are part of the rowel family. As will your mates will be as soon as you mate with them. A mating is like a marriage in the human world. Okay so far?"<br/>"Yes please talk to them I don't want to do this alone." He says this with tires rolling down his face. 'I'm finally going to be loved and cared for. I will do anything to keep it. ANYTHING.' he thinks.<br/>"All right I will talk to Severus, but you can't tell anyone not even you friends. No one. Go get packed, and be quick about it." She tells him in a hurry.<br/>Harry nodded his head and runs out of the room as fast as he can go.<br/>Alexandria gets a link to Severus to tell him what is going on.<br/>"Severus my child I have spoken to Harry. He is willing it become your mate as well as the Dark Lord. The poor child just wants someone to love him. He wants to be with his mates as he goes thought his inheritance. He is packing as we speak. What did Tom have to say?"<br/>"It went like this...<br/>Flashback<br/>Snape walks into the throne room of the Dark Lord. Gives him a small bow before he speaks.<br/>"My Lord I have some surprising news."<br/>"Well what is it Severus?" The Dark Lord is not having a good day he has been having a bad filling all day.<br/>"Well the Empress has risen." <br/>"How is the Empress?"<br/>"She is the first and most powerful of the Vampires. I was the one asked to awaken her. She was found in the Great Hall. Apparently she has been at the school waiting to be called to be awakened. She also told me that Harry Potter is one of her children. On midnight on his birthday he will come into his inheritance and become one of us."<br/>"What do you mean one of us?" He asked because he didn't know Severus was a Vampire. <br/>"Well my family has Vampire blood in them, but it lade dormant until me. She also told me that Tom Riddle and I are Harry Potter's mates. That is why you were unable to kill him." <br/>"Really know." He says with more intrastate.<br/>"Yes my Lord. I'm not sure if is willing to become are mate, but I have a filling he will. The inheritance is very painful. It won't be if he is with us. I only hope he will alright without us. I know how painful it was."<br/>"Well Severus if he is willing bring him here. I don't want are mate to be in pain. Now do we."<br/>"Oh no My Lord."<br/>"Know Severus if we are to be mates you may call me Tom. Since we will be in the same bed."<br/>"Yes Tom I will go and ask the Empress as soon as I leave here. If he is willing he will be here in a few hours. I hope to have him soon. We only have a few more hours left."<br/>"All right go and do what you can. I will have a room ready for you when you arrive. Be quick time is something we do not have."<br/>Severus bowed to leave.<br/>"Oh by the way Severus never bow to me again. That is only if he is willing to be are mate. You and Harry will be my equals, and will never bow to me again. Is that clear Severus?"<br/>"Yes Tom and thank you. I will be off then."<br/>End Flashback.</p><p>To be continued...</p>
