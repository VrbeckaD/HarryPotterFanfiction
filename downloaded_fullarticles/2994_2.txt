    <p>“Shhh. Shh shh! He’s going to hear you!” Jacob pretends not to hear the giggling and rustling of clothing of the two mischevious kids from Newt and Tina’s house that they’d adopted a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>He grins lightly, turning to whistle his own tune merrily as his hands kneaded the dough on the table, eyes sliding to the two–a young boy and girl, badly concealed behind the nearest table where he’d just placed freshly baked bread and sweets.</p>
<p>“Go go go!” Jacob tries not to snort at how obvious Nagini and Credence are both being, though seeing them much more carefree as compared to before was something of a great relief to his own soul.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>They’d found Credence first entirely by chance, in an abusive home, whipped, psychologically abused by his adopted mother. Queenie had been horrified of the treatment she’d seen in the adopted mother’s thoughts towards the boy, while he and Newt–had been more terrified of how Tina swelled like a bullfrog, her eyes narrowing to dangerous slits, before she marched up to grab Credence from the Barebone woman’s hands.</p>
<p>“You won’t be seeing him again. Ever!” The shriek had been loud enough to send all of their ears ringing, and so, within the next few days, they’d ended up with a ten year old, horribly frightened, nervous and insecure, right in the mix of Newt’s already busy and bustling unique home.</p>
<p>Nagini on the other hand, had been somewhat of an unintentional, unique case. It had been Credence that had found her while they were on an outing to the nearest magical circus–a celebration for the young boy having been finally integrated into their tight-knit family. Credence had voluntarily taken Tina’s hand and pointed in the direction of a dingy, soiled tent, far from the rest of the vibrant circus, amongst the endless empty cages of animals about to perform. Perhaps it had been his magic that instantly sought to find those that had his same plight, or just that the two children had a magical connection all on their own. </p>
<p>Really, Jacob didn’t want to know.</p>
<p>What they’d found had made Jacob’s stomach turn, and Newt react with his rare moments of blatant displeasure.</p>
<p>They’d found a tiny Asian girl, chained round her neck and ankles, curled up behind bars, dressed in a skin tight dress far too revealing for her own age, dark makeup smeared on her pale face to make her seem more like a vicious monster. The tiny girl’s back had rolled, and infected slits of old whip wounds had gleamed bloodily in the moonlight. </p>
<p>Nagini hadn’t been able to speak them, her eyes sharp and wary of them as they approached the cage that was clearly far too cramped for her. Her bangs were dirty and messy, hair matted with sweat and grime, and Credence had reached out, eyes wide and earnest, splaying his fingers and palm open in a gentle indication of acceptance. She’d instinctively snapped, her eyes turning to serpentine slits, a forked tongue slithering from between her lips, lashing out as her body shuddered to repress the beast back into her own body.</p>
<p>Newt had immediately started hacking at the lock on the cage, before Tina reminded him that they could use their wands, and they released Nagini from her bonds, leaving behind a hefty sum of money for the circus master’s silence.</p>
<p>By the end of the night, they had a tiny, scared little girl at home, bathed and clothed, filled and warm, before they begun their arduous task of teaching her painstakingly again how to speak.</p>
<p>Queenie was more than happy to look after the little girl, because she had been the only other person Nagini had attached herself to, considering her Legilimency allowed for Nagini to speak without using her mouth. Having Nagini by her side instigated much of her maternal instincts, and had made her a tad more content with their current life.</p>
<p>Their tendency to stay together, however, did have a certain amount of impact of the already busy Scamander household.</p>
<p>Tina and Newt had been thrown into absolute chaos once, because Nagini had gone missing, and Credence was inconsolable at her disappearance. Jacob had returned home to find the little girl curled up on Queenie’s chest back at their own home, with his wife’s arms tightly surrounding her as they both slumbered. He’d returned her, still slumbering in his arms, to a frazzled Tina and a relieved Credence, the younger boy refusing to leave Nagini’s side even as he placed her back where she belonged in Newt’s home.</p>
<p>“Come on, Nagini.” Jacob grins as he hears Credence hiss lowly, the telltale clatter of the pots and pans telling him of the naughty antics behind the counter.</p>
<p>He wondered if he should tell Tina about their thieving of his baked goods, though nothing pleased him more than to know that they enjoyed his treats.</p>
<p>Hell, he’d even started taking to leaving a huge platter of sweets and baked bread behind on the same counter after he’d found out they’d sneaked some of it secretly into their mouths. It was kind of their secret thing, with him pretending not to know, and them attempting to sneak the food out without him noticing.</p>
<p>It gave them some form of a joyful childhood, one that he personally felt the world had owed them, severely.</p>
<p>He shivers at the telltale rattling hiss of the snake as Nagini let her inner beast take over her body, and watches through the corners of his eyes as she wraps her teeny snake body around the bag of sweets and baked good he’d wrapped up, before dropping it into Credence’s lap along with the rest of her body.</p>
<p>A rustle of clothes told him that she’d changed back, and Jacob cackled.</p>
<p>“Well, well. Who’s there?”</p>
<p>He could feel them freeze midway in their actions as he peers over the counter, their silence too damning for him not to notice. His lips twitch at the sight of both of them, hands clasped over their bulging mouths, icing spread obscenely round their small fingertips, cookies nearly spilling everywhere–having stuffed their mouths completely upon being found. </p>
<p>Jacob tries not to soften too much at the sight of both Credence and Nagini staring up at him with wide, innocent eyes.</p>
<p>“Nobbink.” Credence is the one that speaks through his mouth full of sweets as Nagini frantically nods, the waves in her hair bouncing rapidly.</p>
<p>“But I see pink icing from my recently made cookies around your mouths.” Jacob lets the observation hang in the air, enjoying the two children’s squirming and discomfort.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell Tina.” Credence deflates as he realises that they’ve failed at fooling him. “And it isn’t Nagini’s fault!” Blotches of red spot his cheeks as he blushes, pulling the younger girl behind his body protectively as he swelled importantly. “It was <em>my </em>idea. I made her do it.” </p>
<p>Jacob tries not to let it get to him that the two children flinch visibly as he reaches down, as though expecting a blow to their heads. </p>
<p>“Oh you two.” He rather enjoys the surprise on both their faces as he simply ruffles the top of their heads, messing with their hair. “In the future just ask.” He sends them off with a playful smack to their bottoms and another packet of cookies for their way home. </p>
<p>“But where’s the fun in that?!” He swats at Credence as the boy twists back and shouts in his direction, his hand never leaving Nagini’s as they make their way home.</p>
