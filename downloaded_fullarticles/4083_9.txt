    <p>Disclaimer: blah blah blah, I don't own anything except my insane ideas and the strength to write this version of a recycled story we've all written and read way too many times. Cheers. </p><p> </p><p>Prologue:</p><p>The pleasant background chatter in the staff room was interrupted by the sound of porcelain shattering on the stone floor as a mug and two delicate teacups were dropped at precisely the same time.</p><p>"What's going on?" Poppy asked warily as in the same instant Rolanda began cackling at the expression on Albus's face. The rest of the non-involved staff tried to pretend they weren't paying any attention, all the while edging closer to the corner of the room where the four involved people sat.</p><p>Minerva sounded alarmingly Scottish (that is to say: very angry) when she replied, "That is a bloody good question!"</p><p>Albus looked apprehensive. "Now, Minerva," he began, only to be interrupted by the Charms professor.</p><p>"She is right, Albus! Quite right!" Filius's voice was barely more than an indignant squeak as he pulled out his wand and repaired the damaged cups, vanishing the spilled tea as well before filling the cups with fresh tea and handing them to their respective owners. "I don't see why you think placing the school - a school full of children! In danger like this is acceptable. And not only that, but you expect us to be fine with relocating classes, all because you've decided to hide the Philosopher's Stone on the third floor corridor? What's to stop the children from finding it?"</p><p>The headmaster smiled genially. "There are some plans I have yet to-"</p><p>"Excuse me? Did you say Philosopher's Stone?" Pomona, her eyes wide, turned to Irma who was seated in the chair beside her. "He did say Philosopher's Stone, correct? I'm not going crazy?"</p><p>Irma frowned and turned her (rather formidable) glare on Albus. "No, you're not, but I can hardly say the same for him."</p><p>Severus snorted, though there was very little humour to be found in his blank expression and Albus turned his pleading gaze to him. "My boy, you understand why this has to be done, don't you?"</p><p>With a speed and accuracy aided by his youth and duelling experience, Severus threw his full mug as hard as he could. It flew passed the headmaster, a hairsbreadth from his long crooked nose, before it crashed and shattered against the wall. In the sudden silence, the sound of tea dripping down the wall was broken only by Severus's harsh breathing. His blank expression had not changed, but his cheeks were flushed red with anger. "There is very little I will not forgive you for, Albus," he said, his voice low and dangerous. "But this is crossing a line. You would tempt the Dark Lord, give violence and destruction a hold over this school, and still claim to have any concern for the safety of the students?"</p><p>"We do not know for certain that it is Voldemort whom desires the stone," Albus reminded him, although his previous genial and calm demeanour was somewhat shaken by Severus's actions and words. "As you have pointed out already, many wizards and witches wish for eternal wealth and immortality."</p><p>Severus sneered as he clutched his left forearm. "Do you take me for a fool? We both know that the Dark Lord did not die eleven years ago, Albus."</p><p>"And even if he had," Minerva interrupted, "any witch or wizard who wishes to steal the stone, Dark Lord or not, is a risk that this school can not afford to take. You will just have to tell Nicolas and Perenelle to find another option."</p><p>With a sigh, Albus shook his head. "I'm afraid I cannot do as you ask. The stone is being removed from Gringotts tomorrow and will be brought to the school by someone I trust, where it will stay in my office until the appropriate time. That is all I have to say on the subject." He ended his statement firmly, but much to his irritation his colleagues paid him no heed as they continued their questioning.</p><p>"You're not even going to be transporting it yourself?"</p><p>"Appropriate time? There is nothing about this situation which is appropriate!"</p><p>"I still can't believe you would put it in the third floor corridor! Preposterous!"</p><p>"That is enough!" Albus stood abruptly and faced them all. The questions stopped but the room was filled with anger and tension thick enough to cut. "That is enough," he said, somewhat more calmly than before. He placed his cold tea down and moved toward the door. "I have taken your protests into consideration, but there are circumstances you have not been made aware of, and as such my decision stands. The Philosopher's Stone will be moved to Hogwarts."</p><p>The crowd of teachers (plus Argus) erupted in grumbles and anger filled whispers. Just as the headmaster was leaving, Filius spoke up once more. "You didn't answer my question, Albus. What's to stop the more curious students from wandering into the third floor corridor and stealing it?"</p><p>Albus turned as he reached the door and once again smiled genially. "Why, didn't I mention? Each of you will be placing a protection of your own making in front of it." And with that, he left, leaving behind a room full of angry and shocked teachers (plus Argus).</p><p>+ </p><p> </p><p>Chapter 1: A Little Gold Never Hurt Anyone </p><p>Quirinus Quirrell watched the retreating backs of Harry Potter and Rubeus Hagrid, and wondered what on earth Dumbledore thought he was doing, allowing the half-giant of all people to escort the Boy-Who-Lived to Diagon Alley. He sipped from his cup of tea and tried not to roll his eyes at the crowd around him as they all whispered excitedly to one another about meeting the wretched child. Placing his cup down, he walked swiftly up the stairs to the room he'd been renting for the past week, and he scowled at his reflection in the bathroom mirror.</p><p>"Dumbledore is a fool if he thinks that great buffoon can keep Potter safe," he muttered to himself as he began unwrapping his purple turban.</p><p>A softer voice, more of a hiss, really, came from behind him. "Dumbledore has become complacent, these past ten years. That can only benefit us in our goal."</p><p>Quirinus smirked and pulled on a black cloak, the hood throwing his face into shadow. "Yes, my lord."</p><p>+</p><p>Harry Potter was having the most amazing day and it had hardly even begun. So far he'd met a half-giant, been told he was a wizard, watched the Dursley's be put in their place (awesome), been on a boat moved by magic - magic! And then, even though he didn't think it could get any better (or stranger) he found himself in an entirely new world, surrounded by witches and wizards in robes buying things he'd never heard of from shops he'd never seen.</p><p>Truth be told, if Harry had been a normal Muggle-born or Muggle raised child, the Wizarding World (and consequently magic) wouldn't have been half so strange, for he would have seen films or read books and comics where magic is real and strange things happen. Had he been a normal Muggle raised child, with a normal Muggle education in basic literary devices, he might have recognized his own archetype long before Fate (and an ancient wizard who like to put his crooked nose in places it didn't belong) pushed him onto his tragic and ridiculous path. He might have said, "This is my story and no it's not narcissistic to say I'm the main character." Unfortunately, Harry grew up deprived of television and films, and never got to read a decent fantasy book (although he did once read a young adult vampire romance novel, which thankfully he recognized for the trash it was and promptly forgot all about it). Instead of an education he got bullied, and on top of that was forced to get terrible grades in order not to show up his cousin who's intelligence rivalled only that of a poorly trained dog (his Aunt Marge's dog Ripper comes to mind).</p><p>So, because this isn't one of those stories where the characters are self-aware (because let's face it: the original Harry Potter is pretty oblivious and the tags say In Character, so...) and it certainly isn't one of those stories where the fourth wall is acknowledged and therefore broken... well, because it isn't one of those stories, our Harry is quite like the original Harry. In fact, he is exactly like the original Harry, and therefore the beginning of our story is also exactly like the original story, right up until it isn't (I did say small divergences, after all).</p><p>And that is where our story begins. </p><p>+</p><p>After leaving Gringotts, Harry and Hagrid (who looked a bit green from the carts) made their way over to a shop called Madam Malkin's Robes For All Occasions. Harry peered in through the window before pushing the door open to get a better look inside. “Cool!” he mumbled to himself, looking around at all the different types of robes and cloth samples he could see. He turned to hold the door open for Hagrid, only for Hagrid to stop him with a pat on the shoulder.</p><p>“Ya alright t' go without me, 'arry? Jus' that, I'm still not feelin' so good cause o' those carts.”</p><p>Harry studied Hagrid's face for a moment, noting the nauseous look, and nodded. “Sure, I'll be alright. I'm used to doing stuff on my own, don't worry.” He smiled and Hagrid smiled back as he turned and made his way back down the cobbled street toward the brick wall they had entered from. Turning back around and letting the door fall closed behind him, Harry took a couple steps forward and glanced at the counter to see if there was anyone there who could help him.</p><p>Just then, a short older woman came bustling out of the rows of robes with a smile on her face and a measuring tape in her hand. “Needing robes for Hogwarts, then, my dear?” She didn't bother waiting for an answer before herding him on toward an area he hadn't yet seen. There was another boy standing there, about his age, with light blonde hair and the type of pale skin most native Englishmen and women have. Harry shot a smile in his direction as the woman (presumably Madam Malkin, although she hadn't introduced herself so Harry couldn't be sure) pushed him up onto a sort of stand.</p><p>The boy didn't seem to notice Harry smile at him, though he did notice Harry's gobsmacked expression when a couple of measuring tapes floated toward him and began taking his measurements without anyone holding them in place. The blond scoffed and rolled his eyes. “First year at Hogwarts, are you?” His tone was dismissive and his face entirely uninterested, but since it was the first time anyone had spoken to Harry without asking to shake his hand, he decided that now was as good a time as any to have a conversation and ask some questions.</p><p>“Yeah, I'm really excited actually. I never knew magic even existed until last night, so this is all pretty strange.” He beamed at the boy and couldn't help the giggle that escaped when one of the measuring tapes tickled his side.</p><p>“You're a Muggle-born, then.”</p><p>Somehow the other boy's voice was even colder and more uninterested than before, and Harry frowned. “Um, I don't know. What's a Muggle-born?”</p><p>The boy sneered. “Someone who's parents are Muggles, obviously.”</p><p>Harry shook his head. “That's alright then. My parents were both wizards – er, well, I suppose my mum was a witch, not a wizard, but yeah,” Harry shrugged.</p><p>“Were? What do you mean?” The sneer was gone and for the first time since he walked in here, Harry thought he could hear a bit of curiosity in the boys voice.</p><p>Feeling a bit pleased at that, but a bit uncomfortable with the topic, he looked down and swallowed. “Uh, well, my parents are both dead. I was raised by my aunt and uncle, who are Muggles.” He looked back up.</p><p>The other boy had an expression on his face that Harry had never seen before, and so couldn't place. “Ah.”</p><p>Before Harry had the chance to reply to that, although he wasn't sure exactly how, Madam Malkin snapped the measuring tapes out of the air and smiled at him. “Well dear, you're all done here. Come back in an hour to pick up your robes, they'll be ready then.” She moved away to talk to an assistant, and Harry hopped down from the stand he'd been on.</p><p>“Well, see you, I guess,” he said, looking up at the blond who was still standing on his stand with that strange look on his face.</p><p>“Wait, what's your name? Mines Draco.”</p><p>Harry grinned. “Harry.”</p><p>For the first time, Harry saw Draco smile. “Bye, Harry.”</p><p>Harry's grin grew wider and he waved as he walked to the door of the shop. “Bye, Draco.”</p><p>The door of the shop clunked closed behind him.</p><p>+</p><p>“Hagrid, look! Is that real gold?” Harry pointed up at the gold coloured cauldron which was seated high above him on a shelf near the ceiling of the dimly lit apothecary. Despite the terrible lighting, the moment Harry stepped inside his eyes caught sight of the shiny metal, and he just knew he had to have it.</p><p>“Of course it's real gold!” The store clerk spoke up from his place at the front of the shop. He sounded rather offended, although to be fair it was a rather rude question.</p><p>Harry jumped up and down. “Wow! That's the one I want, Hagrid, definitely that one!”</p><p>Hagrid's brows drew down as he grunted. “Yer list says pewter, 'arry. Don't know wha' ol' Snape will do if yer got the wrong one.”</p><p>Harry stopped jumping. “Who's Snape?”</p><p>“Professor Snape teaches Potions, best Potions Master 'n Britain.”</p><p>Sighing, Harry looked down. “Oh. Well, I guess you're right, Hagrid. I wouldn't want to make Professor Snape mad.” He looked up with a grin. “I'll just have to buy both!”</p><p>And so he did, despite Hagrid's protests. After placing the two cauldrons onto the counter, Harry then wandered around the shop looking for all the rest of his Potions supplies. He came across tons of gross and weird things in various jars and bins, each one more disgusting than the last; beetles and eyeballs, scales and spider legs. By the time he was nearly finished, Harry was almost positive there wasn't a single disgusting thing he hadn't seen.</p><p>“All done, Hagrid!” He dumped his potion's ingredients onto the counter next to his cauldrons and waited for the clerk to tally the price up. “Whew! I'm sure glad I grabbed so many Galleons from the bank.”</p><p>“Jus' how many Galleons did ya grab, 'arry?”</p><p>Harry laughed and rattled the coins in his pockets. “Definitely way more than you told me too.”</p><p>+ </p><p>Lucius Malfoy sighed in annoyance and resisted the urge to box his son's ears, something he'd never done before but which was looking more and more like the right course of action the longer this insipid argument went on. "Draco, I told you before we left the Manor, I told you once we arrived here and I am telling you again; you have a perfectly serviceable broom at home, and since you aren't allowed a personal broom at school, you will have to wait until next year for a new one."</p><p>"But, Dad, can't you just-,"</p><p>"Draco, enough! I am tired of this argument. I am not going to change my mind." Why oh why had he decided his child would never be spanked? Maybe then he wouldn't be in this ridiculous situation.</p><p>"But, but...Mum!" Draco turned to appeal to his mother.</p><p>Narcissa quickly wiped the amused expression from her face and glanced down with a small smile. "I'm sorry, Dragon, but I agree with your father. Perhaps if you are good and work hard at school you can ask again at your birthday." She waited until Draco turned around to sulk before smirking up at her husband. "I won't say I told you so."</p><p>Lucius shook his head and smiled ruefully. "Yes, yes, you're always right and I should remember that." He smirked and turned to look at his son, who was sulking behind them, a pout on his face. "Come along, Draco, we still have your books and wand left."</p><p>Draco scowled and crossed his arms. "I don't care."</p><p>Raising a single, perfectly arched eyebrow, Lucius held his arm out to his wife. "Now, Draco. And maybe if you remember your manners I will let you choose an owl of your own."</p><p>Grey eyes lit up in excitement. "Really? I mean, alright, that's acceptable I suppose." Nose to the air, Draco stepped in front of his parents and began walking toward Ollivander's wand shop.</p><p>Lucius grumbled and muttered, "I thought I said manners, not airs."</p><p>Narcissa snorted and took his arm so they could follow along behind their son at a leisurely pace. "Hmm. Remind you of anyone?"</p><p>"You didn't even know me at eleven!" Lucius said, his cheeks the tiniest bit flushed. He blamed the heat, of course.</p><p>"You're right," she said, nodding in agreement. "But then what does it say about you, that you were like that at 16?" She gave him a triumphant smirk before pulling her arm gently from his, ushering her son forward into Ollivander's shop.</p><p>His flushed cheeks turned even redder. "Cissa!" He followed them inside, trying not to sulk and failing spectacularly.</p><p> </p>
