</p><p>Hermione stood on the top of the ridge overlooking the small gathering below. Everyone looked somber in their subtly classy black outfits, except for Luna who was clad in a myriad of orange and red. Hermione was glad she wasn’t close enough to see everyone’s faces. She didn’t think she could bear to see their grief up close.</p><p>She gazed down at the crowd as they lowered the coffin covered with dozens of lilacs into the ground. A single tear fell down her cheek as she began to shake with barely contained sobs. With a deep breath she steadied herself. She knew she was already risking too much by being here this long.</p><p>As she took one last look at all her friends down below, she whispered, “It was a hell of a way to die.”</p><p> </p><p>**********</p><p> </p><p>One year. That’s how long the peace lasted.</p><p>That’s when an unnatural storm caused a large-scale jailbreak from Azkaban. No magic. At least, no obvious magical source. Lightning hit the top corner of the prison, causing what was once a small crack to grow, allowing almost all those in the top security floors to escape.</p><p>It didn’t take long before Lucius Malfoy led the former Death Eaters to overpowering the newly reformed Ministry. After the takeover, new decrees were issued in quick succession. Muggle-borns were not allowed to attend schools. Muggle-borns were not allowed to hold public office. Muggle-borns were not allowed to run businesses. They were dragged from their homes and their families. Locked up in the Ministry’s holding cells, hundreds of witches and wizards feared torture and death.</p><p>But that was not the worst thing the Death Eaters had planned. The Malfoy-controlled Ministry established the Department of Mudblood Indentured Servitude- DoMIS for short. This allowed Muggle-borns a way out of imprisonment or death sentences. Instead, they would be sold as slaves to pureblood families, forced to serve out the remainder of their lives as maids and cooks, demeaning them to a status lower than that of a house elf.</p><p>At first, many empathetic purebloods were shocked at this proposal. Surely, nobody would ever <em>volunteer</em> for such a position. Under the carefully planned cruelty of Lucius and his faithful followers, however, it was not long before the prisoners started lining up for a chance at slavery…….</p><p> </p><p>**********</p><p> </p><p>Draco stood against the wall drinking his firewhisky, trying his best to keep his facial expression impassive. He hated these gatherings, hated how easy it was to slip back into his old habits, his old attitudes. He particularly hated this party, if it could even be called that.</p><p>“Hey man,” Blaise got Draco’s attention as he walked up to him. “You going to take home a prize tonight?”</p><p>Draco raised one eyebrow at his friend. “Why would I want another servant to feed? I doubt any of them even know how to clean. Filthy Mudbloods.”</p><p>Blaise seemed unaffected by Draco’s mood, his smile fading into a kind of stern determination. “They’ll learn to serve if they know what’s good for them. They know this is the best option they have,” he said dismissively.</p><p>Draco nodded absentmindedly, scanning to observe the crowd around him. His father wasn’t attending the first auction, too busy running the wizarding world, but Draco was sure he would have multiple reports on the events of tonight. Draco knew that he would be expected to at least bid on a few of the “items” for sale tonight. He couldn’t help a small scowl of disgust at the idea of actually winning one of the prisoners.</p><p>The bell rang announcing the five-minute warning before the auction started, and people slowly made their way to their seats. Draco sat down a few rows from the front, where he was sure to get a good view of the “merchandise.” He would have preferred the back, but he knew his father would hear about it.</p><p>“Good evening everybody,” the speaker, a witch Draco didn’t recognize, addressed the crowd. The lady’s clean cut business suit and sharp features contrasted the smile on her face. “Before we begin, I would just like to thank you all for your participation in a momentous event. With your attendance, and your bids,” she said pointedly, “you are helping make history and form a new wizarding world free from conflict.”</p><p>The audience began clapping enthusiastically. Draco tried to hide the scowl on his face. The witch finished her speech, which Draco mostly tuned out. Then the auctioneer came to the block to begin the proceedings.</p><p>The auction seemed to move in a blur. The bidders, most of them families of Death Eaters, almost all of them Slytherin, looked forward gleefully as one slave after another was brought forward. Draco made sure to bid a few times, always making sure there was enough other interest to ensure he would be outbid. He got into a small bidding war with old Araminta Parkinson. She was a cruel old hag, and he knew that the poor young wizard up for sale would be punished mercilessly in her care. It was only fair that he increase the price a bit for her.</p><p>“Sold,” the auctioneer said. Draco looked up to see a small boy, no more than fifteen, tears freefalling from his face as he was escorted off the stage. Draco’s gaze followed the boy, but his face betrayed no emotion.</p><p>“Lot 67. Female. 20 years old. Born in London. Educated at Hogwarts. Previously associated with Harry Potter.”</p><p>Draco wrenched his eyes back to the stage. He’d recognize that bushy hair anywhere. Hermione Granger- the Gryffindor princess. He quietly cursed to himself. How had she gotten mixed up in this?</p><p>The crowd was bustling with energy. Many were eager to get their hands on one of Potter’s friends, no doubt already thinking of many torture ideas for her. Others were simply content to shout insults, hurling every name they could at her. If it affected her at all, nobody could tell. She stood tall, though how she could stay standing was a mystery. She looked as though she’d lost two stone during her imprisonment. Yet she stood, staring straight forward with a determined look on her face. Draco found himself smirking.</p><p>Suddenly the auction opened, and immediately the bids started rolling in. Soon though, bidders started dropping out as the bids became too high for their price range. It looked like the final bid would go to the Carrow family, as the auctioneer called once, twice-</p><p>“75,000 galleons,” a voice said clearly. Hermione’s head jerked to stare at where the voice came from. It was only when he saw her eyes on him that Draco realized the bid had come from him.</p><p>“76,000,” Amycus said coolly.</p><p>Draco stood swiftly from his chair. “100,000. And don’t even think about bidding higher, we all know you haven’t the funds to back up the claim.” He waiting for the auctioneer’s “Sold!” before sitting down.</p><p>**********</p><p>Hermione tripped over herself as she began to climb the steps out of the holding cell area. She knew it was one of her craziest ideas, volunteering to be one of the first Muggleborns to register with DoMIS. However, she knew that once they ran out of volunteers, DoMIS would starting forcing prisoners into becoming slaves. She also knew she had no chance of helping a rebellion from inside a cell. Logically, she knew being a slave to none other than Draco Malfoy (she shuddered at the mere thought) put her in a great position to spy. Logic could not calm her panicked, shallow breaths, or quiet the rapid beating of her heart. Swallowing around the lump in her throat, she climbed those last two steps and walked out into the night, into whatever terrors awaited her new fate.</p>
