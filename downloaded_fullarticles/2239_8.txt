    <p>The train was rolling through the streets of England, picking up speed as it went. Lily pressed her forehead against the window, trying to not sniffle to loudly or the other two boys in her compartment would hear her crying. Luckily, they were both chatting, talking about some candy one of them was eating. She pressed her green eyes shut, squeezing out some tears she'd been holding in.</p><p>She remembered Tuney's face on the platform, when Lily had tried to convince her to write to Dumbledore. Petunia hated Lily and it was all Sev's fault. Lily couldn't believe Tuney had called Lily a freak just because she could do magic. Lily's mum said Tuney was jealous, but Lily had tried sharing the magical world with her sister. Tuney was the one who had to be so bull-headed.</p><p>"Lily."</p><p>She winced when she recognized Sev's voice interrupting her replay of Petunia's scorn on the platform.</p><p>"I don't want to talk to you," Lily said in a constricted voice, turning her cheek.</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"Tuney hates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore." Lily sniffed, looking up from the window to glare at Severus Snape.</p><p>"So, what?" Sev clearly failed to see the problem.</p><p>"So, she's my sister!" She threw him a look of deep dislike.</p><p>"She's only a —"</p><p>He caught himself quickly; Lily, too busy trying to wipe her eyes without being noticed, did not hear him. Lily was aware of her sleeves being covered in wet tear residue. She tried to run her sleeves on her legs furiously. She was such a baby, after all, who cried their first day of magic school? If Sev noticed her embarrassment, he was smart not to make note of it.</p><p>"We're going!" he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice. "This is it! We're off to Hogwarts!"</p><p>Lily nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half smiled.</p><p>"You'd better be in Slytherin," said Snape, encouraged that she had brightened a little.</p><p>"Slytherin?"</p><p>One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at all in Lily or Snape until that point, looked around at the word. He was slight, black-haired like Sev, but with that indefinable air of having been well-cared-for. His school robes were pressed, and Lily thought she saw a faint line of lipstick on his cheek. He wore spectacles that were too big for his face and he was sitting beside a small pile of candy that could have made all of them sugar high.</p><p>"Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?" Specs asked the other boy that was lounging on the seats opposite.</p><p>"My whole family have been in Slytherin," the other boy said with a shrug.</p><p>"Blimey," said Specs, "and I thought you seemed all right!"</p><p>"Maybe I'll break the tradition." Lily watched Sev give the lounging boy a deliberate once over, "Where are you heading, if you've got the choice?"</p><p>Specs lifted an invisible sword, "'<em>Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!</em>' Like my dad."</p><p>Sev made a small, disparaging noise. The boy in the glasses turned on him and Lily saw a challenge arise on his face. She didn't like the cocky look the boy painted, or the jeer pulled by his lips.</p><p>"Got a problem with that?"</p><p>"No," said Snape, though his slight scorn said otherwise. "If you'd rather be brawny than brainy —"</p><p>"Where're you hoping to go, seeing as you're neither?" interjected the lounging boy cleverly.</p><p>Specs roared with laughter and offered the lounger a high five. Severus was positively seething. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from one boy to the other with dislike. They reminded her of the bullies at school that always made fun of her for her hand-me-down dresses from Tuney. Lily took Sev's arm.</p><p>"Come on, Severus, let's find another compartment."</p><p>"Oooooo..."</p><p>Both troublemakers imitated her lofty voice and Lily sent them a glare over her shoulder. Spectacles tried to trip Snape with a well-placed foot as he passed. Lily was certain that no matter what, she didn't want to be in the same house as those morons.</p><p>"See ya, Snivellus!" a voice called, as the compartment door slammed.</p><p>"Don't listen to them." Lily told Sev gently when she saw his face, "They're just bullies."</p><p>Sev sniveled and knocked Lily's hand off his shoulder as he adjusted himself to stand taller. Lily pursed her lips and followed him as they made their way to a new compartment. When she cleared her throat, Sev finally looked at her.</p><p>Severus eyed Lily curiously, "what house do you want to be in?"</p><p>"Does it matter?" Lily murmured back.</p><p>"You've got to be in Slytherin." Severus insisted.</p><p>Lily played with her hair, "that one boy didn't seem too eager about Slytherin. Why?"</p><p>Sev wrinkled his nose, "Slytherin has a bad reputation." he said "but no one will bully you if you're in that house."</p><p>"Why would anyone <em>try</em> and bully me?" Lily asked crossly as they slipped into an empty compartment, "If I knew any spells those boys back there would've shut up."</p><p>Sev fell onto a soft cushion, following Lily's lead. He had a slight flush on his sallow face as he dug dirt from his fingernails. He was trying to not look at her, but Lily couldn't imagine why.</p><p>"Sev," Lily asked again, "Why would anyone want bully me?"</p><p>"Well," Sev's black eyes lifted to her face, "Because of who your parents are."</p><p>Lily furrowed her brow, "but you said it doesn't make any difference, being muggle born."</p><p>"I lied." Sev confessed and she whitened, "I'm sorry! I just—it doesn't matter. Especially not for you! I've seen you do loads of things. You're going to be a powerful witch! You've got so much magic—purebloods just wouldn't understand."</p><p>"So, purebloods," Lily felt a twinge in her heart, "purebloods will bully me."</p><p>"Not if you come into Slytherin," Sev urged as she bit her lip contemplatively, "not if you stay with me."</p><p>"What makes a difference between me being in Slytherin versus any other house?" she asked.</p><p>Severus leaned forward, trying to be persuasive, "Slytherin is where the most powerful witches and wizards come from! Everyone respects Slytherins and assumes they're half blood or higher."</p><p>"I'm not ashamed of my blood." Lily said, rather defensively.</p><p>Sev scowled, "I'm just saying that. It's just, Slytherin would be the best choice for you."</p><p>Lily nodded to show she'd listened to his side of the argument, but she didn't say anything for the rest of the trip. Not even when they were boated across the giant lake and she caught her first glimpse of Hogwarts. Instead, she struggled with her inner turmoil. One part of her was interested to see what the Sorting Hat would say but another part of her was terrified the hat would not know what to do with her.</p><p>Lily faced the candlelit House tables, lined with rapt faces. She was shaking from head to toe with anticipation. Everyone was staring at the line of first years getting ready to have their entire school lives chosen by an old hat. McGonagall read out the first name.</p><p>"Sirius Black."</p><p>Lily's head shot up and next to her Sev shifted in his shoes. It was one of the boys from the train, the one who'd been lounging. The one who said his entire family was in Slytherin. If he went to Slytherin, Lily wasn't sure she wanted to be in that house. There were a few whispers. Sev leaned in close to her ear.</p><p>"If he's a Black, he's destined for Slytherin."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"He's pureblood."</p><p>Pureblood rang through Lily's mind like a broken record, over and over again. The boy certainly looked royal, with sharp cheekbones and a handsome white smile. A few of the girls were giggling into their hands. Lily watched as the hat was slowly placed on Black's head. The boy sat there for a minute and then finally the hat called out Gryffindor and the table dressed with red cheered.</p><p>"Good riddance." Sev hissed as Black whipped the hat from his head and went to sit at the Gryffindor table with a surprised but proud smile, "He's not good enough for Slytherin."</p><p>"More like Slytherin's not good enough for him."</p><p>Specs had heard Sev and clearly didn't approve of Severus' comment. In fact, Specs and Sev were glaring at each other with so much hatred Lily was certain one was about to combust in flames.</p><p>Lily glanced back as Black was welcomed to the Gryffindor table happily. She supposed that since Black was a bully and a pureblood, she'd rather not go into Gryffindor. Lily glanced sideways at Sev to see he was watching other students sorted with eager eyes. He'd been waiting for this moment longer than Lily. He'd been waiting for the chance to prove himself. Lily knew Sev wanted nothing more than to break out of their little town called Cokeworths.</p><p>Hogwarts was going to give both Severus and Lily a chance to shine. Lily reached out to squeeze Sev's elbow encouragingly. That made Sev stop staring daggers at Specs.</p><p>Lily wanted to be where Sev was, after all he was her best friend.</p><p>Professor McGonagall called, "Evans, Lily!" and suddenly Lily felt like she'd been set on fire.</p><p>Lily walked forward on trembling legs and sat down upon the rickety stool. Professor McGonagall dropped the Sorting Hat onto Lily's head. Lily felt the hat move and, barely a second after the fabric had touched her red hair, Lily began whispering furiously to herself.</p><p>"Slytherin, please. <em>Slytherin</em>."</p><p>The hat paused, it's old voice slithering through her head, "well, you've got courage. A strong thirst to prove yourself...but your heart is so kind...you are strong."</p><p>"Please put me with my friend. <em>Please</em>. Slytherin."</p><p>"If you're sure…" the hat paused once more before shouting for everyone to hear, "Slytherin!"</p><p>Lily swiped off the hat, feeling her shoulders relax. Lily handed the old cloth back to Professor McGonagall who smiled uneasily at her. Lily hurried towards the cheering Slytherins wrapped in green cloaks. As she went, she glanced back at Sev to see him looking a little more than euphoric. She also caught the eye of the boy in the specs, the one from the train, he was giving her a disgusted look. She sent him a simper of a smile back.</p><p>The Slytherins all patted Lily on the back as she went to sit down. For the first time in her life she felt welcomed, instead of shunned. A boy in a tall hat with silver blond hair moved over for her. Everyone kept telling her hello, the ones wearing green at least. Someone waved her over to his side.</p><p>"Lucius Malfoy," he said in a silky voice, "If you need anything, I'm happy to help."</p><p>A prefect badge was gleaming upon his chest and Lily sent Malfoy a small smile before returning her attention to the Sorting Hat.</p><p>The roll call continued. Lily watched boy called Lupin, another called Pettigrew, and the boy with the specs join each other at the Gryffindor table. Lily made a mental note to avoid all four of them, if she wanted her first year to go smoothly.</p><p>Professor McGonagall called Severus second to last. Lily watched with a thumping heart as Sev walked to the stool slowly. She watched McGonagall place the hat upon his head and there was a slight pause. She thought she saw a bit of worry flicker across Sev's face and her heart began pounding again.</p><p>"Slytherin!" cried the Sorting Hat.</p><p>Lucius Malfoy patted Sev on the back as he sat down beside him, separating Malfoy from Lily. Lily reached out with both arms to envelope her best mate in a hug. Sev laughed against her hold and they both grinned at each other as the feast started.</p><p>Lily ate so much food she was certain that she'd never walk again. She'd never had such good tasting food and Sev looked like he had a stomach ache from eating too much. Lily almost felt like she was dreaming, everything was so magical.</p><p>That night they were shown the Slytherin common rooms where they would stay the remainder of their time at Hogwarts. The entrance to the common room was located behind a stone wall in the dungeons of Hogwarts Castle. It was located beneath the Black Lake, so the light in the common room was green and the air was thicker. A flickering stone fireplace in the corner of the common room was the only thing that gave off substantial heat. The head of the Slytherin house, Professor Slughorn, stopped by before everyone went to bed. Lily liked him immediately, he had a bit of a grandfatherly air about him.</p><p>"I'm Lily Evans," Lily told Professor Slughorn, shaking his hand.</p><p>"Evans, eh?" Slughorn said as he shook Lily's hand, "what class are you most looking forward too?"</p><p>"Charms and Potions," Lily speculated keenly and that made Slughorn erupt into laughter and pull her into a unexpected hug.</p><p>"You're buttering me up!" he announced as he let her go, "You knew I taught potions, didn't you?"</p><p>"Not at all," Lily said truthfully, "My mate Sev and I read this potions book back home called <em>Brewing for the Better</em> that made brewing sound like a lot of fun."</p><p>Lily motioned behind her to Sev who waved at the Professor uncomfortably. Slughorn smiled widely at Sev and stuck out a hand. Sev shook it loosely. Lily bit her lip, Sev wasn't very good at making friends so she instantly spoke to make up for his hesitance.</p><p>"We both love potions." she gushed to Slughorn, "I'm sure Sev is going to be your best student. He really has a knack for potions."</p><p>"And what about you?" Slughorn asked, fondly, as if he'd known Lily for years, "What do you have a knack for, dear girl?"</p><p>Lily felt her eyes light up as she said, "I guess we'll see."</p><p>"I think we shall," Slughorn agreed, clapping her on the back ceremoniously before moving on to the next group of students awaiting his attention.</p><p>Lily spun to look at Sev with excited eyes, "He seems lovely."</p><p>"Yeah," she noticed Sev's eyes were watching some older boys trade something by the fireplace as he agreed with her.</p><p>Lily put her hands on her hips and surveyed Sev, "Do you think we'll have classes together?"</p><p>Sev's eyes fluttered back to hers, "We're first year, all first years have classes together."</p><p>"Good." Lily tilted her head at him, "I can't wait."</p><p>A voice interrupted Lily and Sev, "and what are your names?"</p><p>Lily and Sev turned to find a tall boy with dark brown hair and narrowed brown eyes staring at them. He was only a little taller than Sev, but he was flanked by two others who towered over them all. Lily held out her hand to him and he stared at it, unimpressed.</p><p>"I'm Lily Evans." she said kindly, "This is my mate Severus."</p><p>The boy shook Lily's hand daintily, "Mates call me Mason, Mason Mulciber."</p><p>Lily didn't quite like the look in Mulciber's eyes as she drew her hand away. She purposely took a step back, so she was shoulder to shoulder with Sev. Mulciber turned his stoney eyes on Sev when Lily backed away.</p><p>"Snape," Sev spoke up, "I prefer Snape."</p><p>"Evans and Snape." the boy glanced between them, "Not pureblood names."</p><p>"Half blood." Snape spoke up before Lily could speak, pushing himself forward so that he half blocked Lily, "We're half-bloods."</p><p>Lily sent Sev a disparaged look but Sev disregarded her clear displeasure. Something flickered in the eyes of the tallest boy that Lily didn't like one bit. She licked her lips and placed her hand on Sev's elbow.</p><p>"I'm going to bed," she told him softly, "See you in the morning for school?"</p><p>"Yeah." Sev said, but he didn't meet her eyes, he was too busy staring at the boy who'd interrupted them, "Night."</p><p>"Goodnight." Lily whispered, pushing past Sev and making sure to send the boy, the one with the dark eyes, an intimidating stare.</p><p>Time passed like it always did, fast and without notice.</p><p>Lily's first year is a blur of magical wands and tense quills scratching at parchment. Sev was right, most people didn't bother with Lily and she was free to walk the halls learning all sorts of things. She had a happy routine at school, especially since she was always at Sev's side.</p><p>Lily's second and third year found her excelling in all her classes and astounding everyone with her charm work. She also happened to have a dab for potions, something that Professor Slughorn was so impressed by, that he even invited her to join his elite club. After Lily made Slughorn promise that she could bring Sev, they met the Slug Club once a month for fancy dinners. Sometimes Lily was called a teacher's pet, but most people directed their nasty thoughts onto Severus. He wasn't as outgoing as Lily and most people found him to be a bit odd. Sev got detention a lot in third year, mostly because he couldn't stop fighting James Potter and his troublesome mates.</p><p>Lily swore she blinked and suddenly she was fourteen, walking through the Hogwarts' halls with a smile and a friend at each hip. When she wasn't with Severus, Lily spent most of her time hanging out with Amelia Greengrass, a pureblood witch who was in Lily's year. Well put together with ocean blue eyes, Amelia could get a boy to do something for her with just one flutter of her eyelashes. Amelia was powerful because of her family name, magical blood that flowed so deep in her veins it seemed that everyone knew who she was.</p><p>Nonetheless, Lily and Amelia were friends, seeing as they were the only two girls who were fourth year Slytherins. They shared a small dorm in the back of Slytherin house and had a very good relationship. Amelia never commented on Lily's slim knowledge of the wizarding world and she hardly ever made snide comments about muggles. Lily often wondered if Amelia knew that her anti-muggle comments got under Lily's skin.</p><p>Amelia was still a pureblood, and purebloods despised muggleborns. The only person at Hogwarts who knew Lily's true heritage was Severus Snape, but he was determined to take Lily's secret to the grave. Lily also knew that Professor McGonagall (who had been the one to deliver Lily's Hogwarts letter) probably had heard rumors of Lily's lie. Luckily, the Professor seemed to either not care or notice Lily's little ruse.</p><p>With a natural knack for charms and potions, no one questioned Lily's upbringing anyways. Lily was almost top of the class in everything. Had it not been for the competition coming from Gryffindor, she might've been the top fourth year at school. Sadly, Potter and Black were determined to make Lily fight even harder to be the best at magic in their year. At fourteen years old, she'd grown to know James Potter and Sirius Black much better.</p><p>Black and Potter were like brothers and they matched each other in all matters of wit and cleverness. Lily was a few points behind both of them in Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts and Divination. Care of Magical Creatures was being ruled by their other mate and Gryffindor, Remus Lupin. Sev, a brilliant potioneer, was fighting Potter for the top spot in Potions, though Lily was close behind them and determined to take the lead. Lily only held her title as top student in Charms.</p><p>Lily had never been competitive, until she'd been introduced to James Potter. He was her aggressive competition in everything, including Quidditch. Potter played chaser to Lily's seeker on the Quidditch field. They might have only played against each other once, but ever since Lily caught the snitch before Potter could score another goal for a Gryffindor win, he hated her.</p><p>Part of the reason for Lily's rooted hatred for Potter was the fact that he always had to one-up her in everything she did. Another reason was because he picked on Sev a lot just because Sev was in Slytherin and best friends with Lily. Potter loved making both their lives miserable, but he especially loved to tease Lily.</p><p>He called to her as she made her way up the stairs of the castle after quidditch practice, always ready for a verbal sparring match when he spotted her. Lily had her broomstick on one shoulder, so she used her free hand to send Potter a rude hand gesture. Toni Spellers, a seventh year Slytherin, snorted next to Lily when she spotted whom Lily was eloquently flipping off. Potter blew Lily a kiss from his spot beside Sirius Black. Lily rolled her eyes.</p><p>"Go kiss a troll, Potter." She said.</p><p>"Let me know the time and place, Evans."</p><p>Lily didn't dare turn.</p><p>She'd long since learned that ignoring Potter was the best way to win against his banter.</p><p>"Potter likes you." Toni commented with a grin.</p><p>"Potter is the worst combination of boy," Lily said, "Gryffindor and a git."</p><p>"He's still a pureblood." Toni hummed. "I'd snog him."</p><p>"Have at it."</p><p>Lily had learned a lot in the four years she'd been at Hogwarts.</p><p>Even as she waved goodbye to Toni Spellers, Lily was thinking about the most important thing she'd learned: muggleborns were synonymous with dirt in the Slytherin dormitories. Severus had been right when he'd told Lily that she'd be safe in Slytherin but what he'd failed to mention was that she'd have to play another role to be safe.</p><p>Muggleborn prejudice was spreading beyond the whispers in the shadows.</p><p>Turning into the first-floor loo, Lily was dealt with a stark reminder of pureblood supremacy. Lily almost dropped her broomstick onto the loo floor when she spotted the curly blond hair covering the face leaning over the sink. Lily's stomach churned with disgust and despair.</p><p>Mary MacDonald, frontside soaked in her own bile, was holding herself up against a sink in the first-floor loo. It was clear that MacDonald was having some sort of panic attack, as her breaths were uneven and pained. Lily's black shoes were frozen on the stone ground as her head whipped around and she looked for someone else to take care of the sick girl. No one was in the loo besides Mary and the sick witch was staring into the mirror like she saw death itself staring back.</p><p>Lily took one large step, then another, as guilt rushed through her brain. Lily should've been in Mary's place. Lily should've been the one that was targeted. Lily was the one who should've been pointed at in the hallways and scorned at dinner.</p><p>But she wasn't.</p><p>Lily placed her hand on Mary's shoulder awkwardly.</p><p>"MacDonald?"</p><p>A moan accompanied MacDonald's flutter of her eyes, "Go away."</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>"Mulci-" Mary stopped herself short when she opened one eye and caught the Slytherin crest on Lily's breast pocket, "Ugh."</p><p>Lily knew enough to put the pieces together.</p><p>Lily's blood ran cold and her cheeks blazed as she recognized the name of the idiot fifth year in her house who loved to pick on muggleborns like Mary MacDonald. Lily had heard him brag one too many times about his conquests in the common room. Lily had heard what Mulciber liked to do with the muggleborns first hand and it wasn't pleasurable in the slightest.</p><p>Finding Mary MacDonald crying until she was sick in girls' loo reminded Lily exactly why she was hiding herself in the shadows of the green robes.</p><p>Lily helped the pale girl to the Hospital Wing and Madame Pomfrey rewarded Lily's house fifteen points. MacDonald couldn't even look Lily in the eyes to say thank you. Lily knew why and she bit her lip as she turned away from the Gryffindor muggleborn. Lily had tried to help the muggleborns when she first came to Hogwarts but Sev had stopped her after a particular fight almost broke out in the Slytherin common room.</p><p>They'd fought about that too.</p><p>Severus was adamant that Lily needed to stay in the shadows, safe, where she wouldn't be seen as anything special. Lily wasn't very good at taking bullies sitting down like a good girl. Especially when most of the bullies were somehow coming from her own house. Slytherin was developing into a house that everyone feared...respect wasn't even a proper word to describe what people saw when they watched Lily's housemates pass.</p><p>Lily saw the fear in first year's eyes when she passed by in her green robes etched with a snake emblem.</p><p>Lily hated when she passed the giant stone columns with bejeweled counters in the main hall. Slytherin was trailing behind Gryffindor thanks to James Potter, who'd been awarded fifty points for rescuing Severus two weeks before. Lily didn't want to think about Severus or James Potter. She was mad at the both of them. Potter for being an insufferable pig and Severus for being overly protective and utterly dismissive of the problems rooted in their house.</p><p>As if he knew Lily was thinking about him, Severus appeared, surrounded by other Slytherin's at the entrance to the courtyard. They all waved, Sev the most, as she made her way out into the courtyard for a breath of fresh air. Lily heard Sev follow her. Lily didn't even glance his way, she was seething inside, and she didn't want to say anything she might regret later. Sev immediately noticed Lily's cold persona.</p><p>"Are you okay?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"You walked past me in the hallway five minutes ago."</p><p>"I saw you, I just didn't want to stop and chat."</p><p>Severus frowned, "I thought we were supposed to be friends?" Snape said. "Best friends?"</p><p>"We are, Sev, but I don't like some of the people you're hanging round with!" Lily brushed her fingers through her hair, "I'm sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he's creepy! D'you know what he tried to do to Mary MacDonald the other day?"</p><p>Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face. Mary's face had been paler than Sev's in the loo when Lily found her. Guilt flashed through Lily's brain again.</p><p>"That was nothing," said Sev. "It was a laugh, that's all —"</p><p>"It was Dark Magic, and if you think that's funny —"</p><p>"What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?" demanded Sev. His color rose again as he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resentment.</p><p>"What's Potter got to do with anything?" said Lily, feeling exasperation rise again.</p><p>"They sneak out at night. There's something weird about that Lupin. Where does he keep going?"</p><p>"He's ill," said Lily. "They say he's ill —"</p><p>"Every month at the full moon?" said Sev.</p><p>"I know your theory," said Lily.</p><p>She shuddered as the word werewolf floated around in her brain. There were always rumors of course, and Potter was almost always at the center of each rumor. People either loved to hate Potter or hated that they loved him. Severus definitely loved to hate Potter and anything to do with Potter, including Potter's mates.</p><p>"Why are you so obsessed with them anyway?" Lily asked pointedly, "Why do you care what they're doing at night?"</p><p>"I'm just trying to show you they're not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are."</p><p>The intensity of his gaze made Lily blush. She remember Toni Speller's words earlier. It was the first time someone had taken Lily and James' sparring as a precursor to flirting. Lily didn't like James Potter, he was a bully after all. She'd seen some of the nasty things he'd done...still...it was nothing compared to Mulciber trying to use imperious curses on Mary MacDonald.</p><p>Sev had been there when Mulciber tried to force Mary MacDonald to kiss him out by the broom shed. Sev hadn't stopped Mulciber from putting his hands down Mary MacDonald's robes. This time, for the first time, James Potter was the one who came out the hero.</p><p>"They don't use Dark Magic, though." Lily dropped her voice. "And you're being really ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You went sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow and James Potter saved you from whatever's down there —"</p><p>Sev's whole face contorted and he spluttered, "Saved? <em>Saved</em>? You think he was playing the Gryffindor hero? He was saving his neck and his friends' too! You're not going to — I won't let you —"</p><p>"Let me? <em>Let me</em>?"</p><p>Lily's bright green eyes were slits. He could be so demanding, it was infuriating. Sev backtracked at once.</p><p>"I didn't mean — I just don't want to see you made a fool of — He fancies you, James Potter <em>fancies</em> you!" The words seemed wrenched from him against his will. "And he's not . . . everyone thinks. . . big Quidditch hero —" Sev's bitterness and dislike were rendering him incoherent, and Lily's eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead.</p><p>Lily knew Sev and Potter weren't the best of friends. They had some weird boy competition that had been happening since the day James tried to trip Sev on the train in first year.</p><p>"I know James Potter's an arrogant toerag," she said, cutting across Sev. "I don't need you to tell me that. But Mulciber's and Avery's idea of humor is just evil. Evil, Sev. I don't understand how you can be friends with them."</p><p>The moment she had insulted James Potter, his whole body had relaxed, and as they walked away there was a new spring in Snape's step.</p><p>"They're the most popular kids in school, Lily." Sev said, "I keep up appearances for the both of us."</p><p>"Popular." Lily scoffed, "Sev, kids are scared of them. That's not the kind of thing I'd want <em>you</em> to be known for. They go for muggleborns like they've already joined the Death Eaters."</p><p>Lily wasn't certain he'd heard any of her lectures about Mulciber or cared that she found MacDonald crying in the loo. Instead he suggested that Lily not worry.</p><p>"No one here knows you're a muggleborn except for me." Sev reminded her, "and Mulciber wouldn't dream of touching you."</p><p>"Sometimes I want to just tell the world." Lily hissed as they searched for bowtruckles among the trees near Hagrid's hut, "I hate him so much, he thinks he's better than me."</p><p>"Just play nice." Sev got a worried look, as if he believed she'd have the gall to fight Mulciber, "you don't want to go picking fights with people like Mulciber."</p><p>"Someone needs to stand up to him." Lily said, "Sev, I picked Slytherin to escape the bullies, not be surrounded by them."</p><p>"But Gryffindor is full of bullies too." Sev pointed out. "Potter and his mates jinxed that one muggleborn's head twice its size last week. Aubrey? I think that's his name."</p><p>"That's because Aubry was picking on Peter Pettigrew." Lily said, "I saw the whole thing."</p><p>"Well it was still bullying a muggleborn." Sev muttered grumpily, "You can't pick and choose bullying examples."</p><p>"Sev." Lily threw up her hands, "The only reason that I'm not picked on for being muggleborn is because you told everyone in first year that I'm a half blood."</p><p>"Aren't you happy you aren't being picked on?" Sev asked as if she were being inconsiderate, "Isn't that the whole point?"</p><p>Lily broke a twig from a branch thoughtfully, "sometimes I feel like I don't belong in Slytherin."</p><p>"Sure, you do." Severus said, "after all, our Quidditch team would be nothing without their seeker!"</p><p>"I know," Lily smiled, thinking of quidditch, "but—"</p><p>"But?" Severus probed, "Lily everyone in the school knows who you are. Our head of house personally invites you over for drinks and treats every other week. You beat everyone in charms exam scores last year and you just got placed on the quidditch team! You <em>belong</em> in Slytherin."</p><p>Lily tossed Severus a look over her shoulder sadly, "No one in this school knows me like you do Sev, because no one in this school knows the real me."</p><p>"And no one will ever know you as well as I do." Sev said, "you're worrying over nothing, Lily."</p><p>"I just feel like I'm a coward for not being who I am."</p><p>"You aren't being a coward." Sev rolled his eyes, "You're being smart. You've <em>seen</em> what happens to muggleborns."</p><p>"I feel bad for Mary MacDonald." Lily said.</p><p>"You're just scared." Sev placed his hand on her shoulder, "But you shouldn't be. I won't let anyone hurt you."</p><p>Lily should've known the possessive smile on Sev's face was a foreshadow, a warning like the red flashing lights in muggle streets. Unfortunately, she wouldn't decipher the meaning and motives behind his smiles until much later. She would assume his slight touches and hugs were platonic; a brotherly type of love that stemmed from them growing up together.</p><p>At fourteen the word love seems very simple, when in fact, there is nothing simple about it at all.</p>
