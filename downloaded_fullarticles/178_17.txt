    <p>Ron stared at Hermione, who was frantically writing on her essay. She was biting her lower lip in concentration, her beautiful eyes fixed on the parchment and her hair — that hair he loved to run his hands through — somewhat tamed in a loose ponytail. Merlin, she was so pretty! And, most important, after so long, she was his and he was hers.<br/>
They had been going out together for over a month, since his birthday, when he had almost died poisoned. It had been the first day they had talked — really talked, insults didn’t count — after he had started to go out with Lavender Brown in the middle of November. Ron had enjoyed his time with Lavender, he couldn’t deny that. She seemed to be almost as horny as him — which was something to say — and had quickly moved from snogging to touching to shagging, but despite their long fucking sessions, Ron had never forgotten about Hermione, or stopped thinking about her. Despite his anger at her after discovering she had kissed Krum, despite his jealousy, he couldn’t help loving her.<br/>
Going out with Lavender and discovering that he really was very good at sex and the almost unnatural stamina he possessed — Lavender hadn’t been a virgin, she had had sex with two boys before, and she had been absolutely impressed by him, to the point of asking him if he was using some sort of sex magic — had done loads for his usually weak and fragile ego; and so he had understood that being mad at Hermione for a snog with Viktor Krum was childish and absolutely ridiculous. He had spent Christmas thinking about his situation with both girls, and that time away from both of them had helped him clear his mind and understand what he really wanted in a relationship. So, after Christmas, the frequency of his encounters with Lavender had decreased quickly, while he made some attempts to talk to Hermione again. Those had been an absolutely failure, however, and though at some point he got a bit mad at her for being so stubborn and jealous (yeah, he found a bit hypocritic of her to get annoyed at him when he showed jealousy about Krum while she was as jealous as he was), ultimately he understood that, if he wanted to have a chance with her, or at least be friends once more, he would have to break up with Lavender … and that was a prospect that made him feel completely uneasy and scared.<br/>
After chickening many times and even failed at avoid her so she would ditch him, at the middle of February he had finally plucked up the courage to end things with her. She hadn’t been happy, not happy at all, but despite her tears and how angry she looked, he knew that she deserved the truth, because he had been using her — to get back and Hermione and for sex — and though he hadn’t told her this — that would have been too much — he had confessed he was in love with Hermione and wouldn’t be fair to keep stringing her along.<br/>
In hindsight, he shouldn’t have been so sincere, because that confession earned him a Stinging Hex on his groin, which had hurt like hell. Fortunately for him, a distressed Lavender was not very good with spells and so the hex hadn’t last for long. At the moment, he had cursed rather loudly, but, once the pain had subsided, Ron decided not to hold it against her, and just said he was sorry once more. Lavender had cried, and Ron had stood there, stoically enduring her sobs, until she finally had told him to leave her alone and go after Hermione, if she was what he wanted, but that she was too prim and proper and never would allow him to do to her the things she, Lavender, allowed.<br/>
Apologising one last time, he had left her. He had had the intention of telling Hermione what he had done, but at the last minute his courage had failed him. He had confessed to Harry, though, knowing he would end up telling their friend.<br/>
However, Hermione didn’t seem to think that dumping Lavender was a good reason to talk to him again. In fact, the next day she had glared at him, instead of just ignoring him like before. He didn’t know why, but he suspected she had had to hear about the breakup in her dorm and now she believed he was an arsehole to girls in general and not just to her.<br/>
Simply wonderful.<br/>
However, less than two weeks after that, he had been poisoned the day of his birthday, and that night he had waken up to find Hermione by his side, looked very distraught and deeply worried. She had cried, and he had cried, and both had apologised, and finally, they had embraced and talked for hours … and then he had boldly kissed her. She had retreated at first, caught by surprise, but then had responded, and the both of them had shared a rather fierce snog. They had been going out together ever since.<br/>
So things were going great. Lavender had stopped glaring at him or crying every time she saw him, and he enjoyed his time with Hermione a lot.<br/>
The only problem?<br/>
He was too horny. After fucking Lavender so much before Christmas, they had only done it four or five times afterwards, both because he had decided he didn’t want to be with her anymore and, despite how good it felt physically, he ended up feeling terribly guilty afterwards. And so it had been nearly three months since the last time he had had sex, and his hand no longer was enough. He wanked two or three times a day, imagining how Hermione would look like naked, the things he would love to do to her, or have her do to him. When they kissed, he could feel her breasts pressing against him which drove him mad with desire.<br/>
The week before he had finally got to touch them as they snogged (over the clothes) and fuck did they feel good! They weren’t as big as Lavenders’, but they were certainly large and firm. Hermione seemed to have really liked him touching her, by the way she had snogged him more passionately, arching her back as if wanting him to feel more or her. He had also touched her ass, with was, if possible, more amazing than her tits, and though he had also felt her thighs under the skirt, while they snogged with her sitting on a desk with him between her legs, they hadn’t gone further than that.<br/>
He was getting desperate, but he didn’t want to scare her, as she was a virgin and they had been going out together for only four weeks. She knew he wasn’t a virgin, of course; he had told her, but he didn’t want to pressure her and — well, okay, he did want to pressure her, but wasn’t going to. But he knew that he wanted to spend his life with Hermione, even if he was just a seventeen-year-old boy, and so they had time.<br/>
But he couldn’t help but think about it all the time. He wanted to enjoy sex with her the way he liked: passionate, intense, kinky … he just needed time to release the passionate woman he knew she had inside and that showed up when they were alone.<br/>
He was pulled out of his reverie when Hermione arched her back, looking a bit stiff, and Ron’s eyes drifted from her face to her tits, straining against her school robes. Merlin’s pants, he would love nothing more than to put his hands under her uniform and feel them without clothes between them. Just imagining it had his cock roaring in approval of the idea.<br/>
Fuck!<br/>
Hermione noticed his stare and smiled at him. He smiled back.<br/>
“What?” she asked.<br/>
“Nothing,” he answered quickly, hoping to conceal his thoughts from her. Not that she didn’t know some of the things that went through his head. They talked a lot, after all.<br/>
“Have you finished your essay?”<br/>
“Hermione, you know the answer to that question,” he replied, and Harry snorted.<br/>
“You know we’ve got rounds in ten minutes, do you?” she asked sternly. “So if you don’t finish it now, you’ll have to finish it later.”<br/>
“But you’ll help me,” he said, his tone more hopeful than sure.<br/>
Hermione raised an eyebrow.<br/>
“Please?” he begged, putting on his best puppy face.<br/>
Hermione shook her head as if annoyed, but Ron was almost sure that she was, at least for the most part, just pretending.<br/>
But, just in case she wasn’t, Ron tried to concentrate on his homework. However, he didn’t manage to write more than a few lines before Hermione told him it was time.<br/>
“OK,” he said, getting up. “Bye, Harry.”<br/>
“Have fun,” he said mockingly.<br/>
“Git,” Ron replied, following Hermione through the portrait hole<br/>
They began to walk in silence. After just a minute, Ron’s hand sought hers and clutched it, giving her a squeeze.<br/>
“Ron,” she admonished, taking her hand from his, albeit — he noticed — with a certain reluctance. “We’re on rounds.”<br/>
“We snog on rounds, Hermione.”<br/>
“After rounds,” she corrected him.<br/>
“Are we going to snog for a bit later, then?” he asked, hopeful.<br/>
“I don’t know,” she responded, trying to maintain a serious face. She looked at him, “Did you finish your essay?”<br/>
“Umm — no.”<br/>
“Well, there was a reason I told you to finish it,” she said pointedly.<br/>
“Oh, come on!” he moaned. “We’ve barely kissed today, I need you!”<br/>
“Ron …”<br/>
“Hermione.”<br/>
“I want to,” she confessed, getting a bit flushed. “You know I enjoy our … sessions. Very much. But if you don’t finish that essay —”<br/>
“I’ll finish it, if you help me. You know I understand you much better than McGonagall.”<br/>
“Professor McGonagall,” she corrected him.<br/>
“Please, I need you.”<br/>
She looked at him, as if pondering what to do, and then sighed. “All right,” she conceded. “But next time —”<br/>
“— I’ll finish it in time, I promise!” he finished for her, happy.<br/>
She shook her head in exasperation. “Idiot.”<br/>
“Your idiot.”<br/>
“That’s right,” she nodded, and smiled despite herself.<br/>
They spent the rest of their rounds in silence, only speaking to greet a professor when they crossed them in the halls. Finally, their hour was over, and so, nervous and excited, they went to an unused room close to the Gryffindor tower. Hermione magically closed the door and then leant against an old desk.<br/>
“At last,” he said, getting closer to her and rubbing his hands up and down her sides. “I’ve been wanting to be with you, alone, the whole day.”<br/>
“Me too,” she confessed, shuddering a little. Ron smiled inwardly, pleased with the effect he had on her.<br/>
“So you wanted me alone?” he asked in a low, husky tone, getting even closer to her, so their chests and legs were touching. He was already half-hard, but he wanted her to feel his cock, it seemed to excite her, while he felt her breasts pressed against him.<br/>
She nodded, gulping.<br/>
“And what do you wanted me alone for?” he questioned her, breathing against her ear and making her shudder again.<br/>
“Please, Ron …” she said, almost shyly, which sent shivers of desire down his body. Sometimes, when they were alone, she acted like this, so opposite to her usually confident and bossy manner, and it drove him mad. Though other times she was sure of herself and demanding, and that drove him mad as well, so maybe it wasn’t how she acted, just that it was her.<br/>
“What, Hermione?” he asked huskily, wanting her to ask for it.<br/>
“Kiss me.”<br/>
With a groan, Ron lowered his head and took her mouth in a hard, bruising kiss. Hermione moaned against his mouth, responding with equal ferocity, and put her arms around his neck to press him more against her. He felt her tongue against his lips and opened his mouth, letting her entrance and sucking on it before entwining it with his own. His hands began to move up and down her back until they rested on her round, firm bum. He squeezed it hard, eliciting a new moan from her. His cock was now completely hard, pressing against her belly, and, as he fondled her ass, he felt her rub a bit against him, almost unconsciously.<br/>
“Mmmh, Hermione,” he moaned when their mouths parted to get some needed air. “Fuck, you feel so good …”<br/>
“Kiss me more, Ron,” she moaned dreamily, her eyes half-closed, her face flushed. “I love the way you kiss me.”<br/>
“I’ll kiss you as much as you want,” he said. “But I want you to take your robes off,” he added. “I’ll take mine, too.”<br/>
She opened her eyes and stared at his, and then nodded in agreement.<br/>
“OK.”<br/>
They discarded the robes and then kissed again, the snog getting even more heated. This time it was Ron who plunged his tongue into her mouth. She sucked on it, and Ron’s cock jerked, imagining how her lips would feel around his it. Fuelled on by the image, he put his hands back on her ass. Without the robes, he could feel her better, though there were still too many clothes for his liking. He cupped her bum, pressed her hard against him and lifted her to sit her on the desk. Moaning, she parted her legs a bit, and he took to opportunity to get between them. His hands slid down her thighs, above her skirt, until he reached the hem and could touch her bare skin. He caressed her there a bit while they kissed hungrily, and then moved them up, but under her clothes.<br/>
Hermione moaned and put her own hands on his ass, kneading them and pressing him more against her. Ron got even more excited and, feeling bold, moved his hands further up her legs. “Ron …?” she said, a bit unsure. He could tell, looking at her, that she was nervous, despite also being turned on.<br/>
“Let me touch you, Hermione,” he asked softly, his voice dripping with want. “I need to touch you. I need you to touch me. Fuck, you make me so hard … I can’t stop wanking, imagining it is you who touches my cock.”<br/>
“Gods, Ron …”<br/>
“You felt it, didn’t you?” he inquired, getting his head closer to hers and giving her small kisses on the cheek. “You felt my cock, didn’t you, Hermione?” he asked, biting lightly on her earlobe. He of course knew she did, but loved to hear her admitting it.<br/>
“Yes, I — I feel it,” she stuttered. “How could I not?” she added, her voice a tad firmer.<br/>
“Do you feel how hard it is?” he said, pressing himself against her, so he could feel him again, all the time caressing her thighs, moving higher.<br/>
“I — I do,” she said, her face flushed.<br/>
Ron watched her, battling with himself. Could he go further?<br/>
And then he felt her kneading his bum with need, pushing him even more against her, and Randy Ron won. “Do you want to touch it?” he blurted out. “Because I’d love it if you did.”<br/>
“I — I don’t know, Ron,” she said, sounding equally excited and scared. Ron smiled inwardly. This was going well, he just had to press the right buttons …<br/>
“I could touch you too,” he said. “I know how to make you feel good, Hermione … and I’d love to, you know. To make you cum.”<br/>
“Oh, God, Ron …” she moaned.<br/>
“Don’t you want to?” he asked.<br/>
“Yes — No — I don’t know!” she groaned, clearly turned on.<br/>
“Fuck, Hermione, you make me so horny … I want to touch your sweet, wet pussy until you cum, and then I want you to make me cum.”<br/>
Hermione let out a moan. “You have such a dirty mouth,” she said, though not precisely in a reprimanding way. She seemed equally turned on and shocked by his vulgar language, which was amazing. “That — that word …”<br/>
“Which one? Pussy?” he asked, feigning ignorance.<br/>
“It’s very vulgar,” she said.<br/>
“It’s sexy,” he replied, reaching higher on her thighs with each caress. “Is your pussy wet, Hermione? Tell me.”<br/>
Hermione looked down, completely red.<br/>
“Answer me, Hermione,” he added, a bit more softly. “It’s me, Ron, whom you’re talking to. And you’ve got nothing to be ashamed of.”<br/>
“Yes,” she said in a very low voice.<br/>
“What?” he asked, even though he had heard her perfectly.<br/>
“Yes, it — it is wet.”<br/>
“Do you want me to pleasure you, Hermione?” he asked. “Just tell me, and I’ll do it.”<br/>
Hermione half-moaned and then nodded. “Yes, Ron. Please.”<br/>
Barely supressing his desire to let out an animalistic growl, Ron left a trail of kisses on her neck before kissing her again. At the same time, he moved his hands up her thighs until his fingers touched the fabric of her panties. She moaned against his mouth and opened her legs wider. Ron smiled and moved his right hand so it was cupping her over the soaked fabric.<br/>
“You’re so fucking wet,” he whispered in a husky tone. “Fuck, Hermione.”<br/>
“Please, Ron,” she begged, rotating her hips to get more pressure from his hand.<br/>
Ron began to rub her, pushing against her slit, while with his other hand he cupped her sweet ass. He kept caressing her while they snogged frantically, panting into each other’s mouths, and then slid his hand up and then down again, under her knickers, touching her hot, wet pussy for the first time. The feeling of her damp curls and her folds in his hand got his head spinning.<br/>
“Fuck, your pussy is so warm and soft, you feel so bloody good.”<br/>
“Oh, Ron …”<br/>
Ron began to move his fingers against her, caressing her clit, and she began to move her hips faster instinctively, all the while moaning. She looked so hot Ron felt he could cum just touching and watching her.<br/>
“Oh, oh, oh, Ron, Merlin, that’s so good … don’t stop, please, don’t stop!”<br/>
“I won’t, love,” he said, relishing that she was a talker, and rewarding her by moving his fingers more quickly. After a bit, he pushed his hand lower, and, carefully, thrust his middle finger into her hole, using his thumb to keep rubbing her clit.<br/>
“Oooh, God!” she moaned, throwing her head backwards in pleasure. “God, Ron, yes, yes!”<br/>
“Cum for me, Hermione,” he demanded, moving his thumb and middle finger in sync. He could feel her juices running down his hand, and the feeling of her tight hole, hot as a furnace, wrapping his finger had his cock as hard as steel.<br/>
“Oh… oh… oooh, Ron! Don’t stop, don’t stop! I’m — I’m coming!!!” she moaned loudly, her hips trashing frantically. Ron could feel her pussy clenching, wishing it was his cock inside it instead his fingers.<br/>
“Fuck, yes, Hermione! Cum for me, cum hard!”<br/>
“Oh, oh, oh, Ron …” she whimpered as her climax subsided, her body still convulsing with the aftershocks. “So good … oh, it was so good …” she muttered, finally opening her eyes and looking at him, flustered. She smiled, a bit sheepishly, maybe realising the wantonly way in which she had acted. “Thank you.”<br/>
“My pleasure,” he said, grinning at her. “You look so hot when you cum. I want to see you like that every day.”<br/>
“Well, you won’t hear me complain,” she replied, grinning widely. “I’m still trembling.”<br/>
Ron took his hand from under her panties and stared at it, completely covered in her juices.<br/>
“Merlin …” she said, blushing with embarrassment. “I practically drenched you.”<br/>
“I don’t mind,” he said, and put his middle finger in his mouth to taste her.<br/>
“Ron!”<br/>
“You taste so good, Hermione,” he said simply. “I can’t wait to taste it directly from the source,” he added with a smirk, and Hermione blushed even more.<br/>
“Really?” she muttered.<br/>
“Really. I’m dying to eat you out. But now …” he got even closer to her, putting his left hand in her bare thigh. With the other, he took her left one and put it against the bulge in his trousers. She let out a loud gasp.<br/>
“See what you do to me?” he asked huskily. “Please, Hermione, I’m tired of wanking alone. Make me cum. I need it.”<br/>
“I — I’m not sure if I know how.”<br/>
“Believe me, you won’t have to be very skilled to make me explode right now,” he said. Then he moved his hands and unbuckled his trousers. He let them fall to the floor and then dropped his pants. His hard, aching cock bounced free. Hermione’s eyes became the size of saucers.<br/>
“Merlin!” she exclaimed, impressed. “Ron you’re so — so big …”<br/>
“I’m glad you approve,” he said, smiling rather proudly. “Now touch it, Hermione. Give me a good handjob.”<br/>
Tentatively, Hermione put her hand on Ron’s cock, and he hissed at the contact. Her fingers felt so different from his.<br/>
“It’s so hot,” she commented, her eyes fixed on it with that curious look she got every time she got to learn of anything interesting. “And the skin is so soft,” she added, moving her hand up and down a little, tentatively.<br/>
“Grip it hard,” he told her. “It won’t break.”<br/>
“O-okay,” she nodded, and did as told. She kept studying it for a bit, her eyes fixed on it and how it reacted to her touch.<br/>
Hermione tightened her grip on his cock, eliciting a soft moan of pleasure from Ron. Fuck, her tiny hand felt so good around his pole he could lost it right then. But that wouldn’t do, he really wanted to enjoy and savour it.<br/>
“Like that?” she asked, looking at him with a shy smile. She looked so cute and sexy that Ron’s cock throbbed, making her gasp at the feeling.<br/>
“That meant I like it,” he explained, and moved his hips just a bit, trying to get more friction from her hand. “Now move your hand up and down, Hermione. Wank me.”<br/>
Tentatively, she began to slide her hand up and down his dick. It was obvious she didn’t know what to do, but the fact that it was her, Hermione, who was touching his cock, looking so alluring and yet so innocent, just after having cum thank to his hand, was more than enough to get him going.<br/>
“Faster, Hermione, please,” he begged, putting both his hands on her bare thighs. Hermione began to move her hand faster, gaining confidence, and Ron’s breathing intensified, signalling his pleasure. She moved her eyes from his cock to his face, pleased with the reaction, and sped up a bit more.<br/>
“Fuck, yes, Hermione, yes! Like that … Fuck, just like that.”<br/>
“Do you like it, Ron?” she asked, her voice seductive. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes, full of lust, and Ron’s cock twitched again knowing that doing this to him was exciting her. “Do you — do you like me wanking you? Wanking your cock?”<br/>
“Fuck, Hermione!” he yelled, pleasantly surprised at her dirty talk. “Yeah, I do! Keep going, please!” he practically begged. His hands were rubbing her smooth thighs, pushing her skirt, which had fallen a bit, higher, so he could see again her wet panties.<br/>
“Are you close?” she asked, her voice deep and husky.<br/>
“Oh, yeah!” he said, and moved a bit closer to her. “Use your other hand too … touch my balls.”<br/>
She complied immediately; her eyes fixed on his swelling cock. Her hand on his balls felt good, but she seemed a bit hesitant, as if afraid of hurting him.<br/>
“You can be a bit rougher,” he said in a strangled voice.<br/>
“Won’t – won’t I hurt you?”<br/>
“Fuck, no, it feels so good, so good, Hermione. Just don’t stop, I’m right there.”<br/>
Hermione sped up the movement of her hands, and Ron felt his balls contract, ready to burst.<br/>
“Almost there, Hermione!”<br/>
“Do it, Ron. Come. I — I want to see you coming.”<br/>
Ron looked down, realising Hermione hadn’t thought about how close they were. The idea of cumming on her …<br/>
“It’s going to be big, Hermione!” he warned her. “I’m going to cum all over your panties! Oh, fuck — can I?”<br/>
“Eh …” she started, shocked.<br/>
“Please, love, I’m about to!”<br/>
“Okay,” she said, relenting. “Come — come on my panties, Ron,” she added, flushed.<br/>
“Shit! Shit!” he yelled, overwhelmed by the idea and the pleasure she was giving him. Taking his right hand from her leg, he put it around hers and helped her move it at a frantic pace. With a loud “FUCK YES!” his cock exploded. He pointed it a bit downwards, so the streams of hot cum bursting from his cock splashed directly against the front of her knickers. He heard her moan, but in that moment was unable to determine if from excitation or mortification, exhilarated by the pleasure coursing his body and the unbelievable sight of his cock spurting all over Hermione underwear.<br/>
One, two, three … until five big streams came out of his cock an onto her, coating her panties and even falling on her inner thighs, the view alone enough to prevent his cock from going completely soft.<br/>
“Fuck, Hermione, oh, fuck …” he moaned, panting heavily.<br/>
He looked at her, and saw her eyes fixed on his weeping cock and the mess on her.<br/>
“It’s so warm,” she commented, almost dreamily, moving her fingers, which were also partially coated in his semen. Then she touched her own knickers, eliciting a new groan from Rom. She looked up at him. “Did you enjoy it?” she asked, a bit unsure. “Was I good?”<br/>
“Merlin’s balls, Hermione, you were fantastic! I think the mess I made proves it!”<br/>
“I didn’t expect there would be so much,” she commented, blushing, and touched her panties again.<br/>
Unable to resist it, Ron put his left hand on the back of her head and kissed her hand on the mouth. She stood still for a moment, shocked, and then responded with equal ferocity, confirming Ron that she was turned on.<br/>
Hermione was turned on from wanking his cock and making him cum.<br/>
Moaning against her mouth, he moved his right hand to her pussy and began to rub it above her panties, pressing his drying cum against her, making her feel its wetness.<br/>
“Mmmh!” she moaned, surprised, but, to his delight, didn’t stop him and just kissed him with more passion, opening her legs wider so he could get closer to her.<br/>
“Fuck, Hermione,” he panted between fervent kisses.<br/>
“Oh, God, Ron!”<br/>
“Do you like it?” he asked huskily, and kissed her hard before she could answer, his hand rubbing her more forcefully. “Do you want to cum again?”<br/>
“Oh, oh, Ron, yes, yes, please…!”<br/>
Ron kissed her again and kept rubbing her, feeling how wet and hot her panties were, how smooth her pussy felt. He ached to be inside her, and his cock was hard as steel once more.<br/>
Ron moved his mouth to her neck, his hand never stopping. She was grinding against it, desperate for more friction. He knew that if he got his hand under her panties it would be easier for her to come, but he relished in the knowledge that he was pressing his cum onto her, mixing it with her juices.<br/>
“Cum, love,” he whispered against her ear, biting her earlobe. “Cum for me.”<br/>
“Oh, Ron, Ron…” she moaned as her hips bucked against his hand, her body already in the verge of release. Ron began to move his hand quickly in a circular fashion over her clit, and Hermione came undone. “Oh, gods, gods, gods, YEEESSS!” she cried, convulsing under him. Ron moved his head away from her neck to watch her face. She had her eyes closed, her cheeks were flushed, and her mouth was open, emitting those sounds that were making his cock twitch.<br/>
The moment her orgasm subsided, he moved his hand from her crotch to his cock and began stroking it frantically, desperate to cum again, spurred by the way she breathed, by the enticing movements of her deliciously-looking tits, and above all, the way she was looking at him.<br/>
Noticing what he was doing, she looked down and, immediately, moved her right hand to cup his balls, kneading them non-too-gently, the way he liked. She surely was a fast learner.<br/>
“Yes, Ron,” she said, her voice deep and husky. “Come again. Come again, please.”<br/>
Her pleading was just the icing on the cake, and, with a very deep moan, he exploded once more. And just like last time, he directed it towards her drenched panties, coating them with another layer of fresh cum.<br/>
“Merlin’s fucking balls, Hermione,” he said at last, panting. “That was — fuck, it was incredible.”<br/>
“Yes, it was,” she said, smiling sweetly at him before lowering her gaze once more. “I know you’re a teenager, but, for Merlin’s sake, isn’t this so much? I mean, you’re male, and you came twice in what? Four minutes?”<br/>
“Yeah.”<br/>
“I — I’m not experienced, I know,” she commented, and blushed a bit. “But, for what I’ve read —” she blushed even more at his raised eyebrow “well, you shouldn’t — you know, come so much the second time.”<br/>
Ron shrugged. “Well, I was really turned on,” he said, smiling saucily at her. “I don’t know it it’s normal or no. I’ve never seen another bloke cum.”<br/>
“Oh. Yes, of course.”<br/>
“The only thing I know it’s that it feels incredible.” He fixed his eyes on hers. “Was it good for you?”<br/>
“Good?” she asked in a disbelieving tone. “It was, as you’d say, bloody fantastic.”<br/>
Ron laughed. “I’d say fucking fantastic, but I suppose it’ll do.”<br/>
“Was it good for you too?” she asked shyly.<br/>
“More than good.”<br/>
“I’ve never done any of this before. I know you — you —” she looked down, embarrassed.<br/>
“But I love you,” he said bluntly, without thinking. “You could have the worst technique in the world — which you don’t! — and still, it would feel better.”<br/>
She beamed at him, and Ron knew he would do anything to see that smile on her face, that aura of satisfaction.<br/>
“Really?” she asked him, with that look of adoration in her face.<br/>
“Of course it is,” he assured. “Hermione, you don’t know how long I’ve wanted to feel your hands on —”<br/>
“Not that,” she interrupted him. “The — the other thing you said.”<br/>
“Which thing?”<br/>
“That —” she gulped, “that you love me.”<br/>
Ron felt his ears get hot and looked down. Fuck, he had his cock out of his trousers, and three simple words made him blush like an idiot?<br/>
“Ron …?”<br/>
He took a deep breath and looked up at her. “Yeah,” he said at last. “I do. I — I love you, Hermione,” he admitted. Then, realising the situation they were in, he added quickly, “and not just because of what we’ve just done. I mean, it was incredible, but — what I’m trying to say —”<br/>
“I love you, too,” she said, interrupting him. Ron stared at her, not having expecting her to say it back. And the truth was that he wouldn’t have needed to hear the actual words: it was written in her eyes, on her face, in the way she looked at him.<br/>
Dominated by a sudden impulse, he enveloped her in tight hug and she rested her head on his chest.<br/>
“I’m sorry,” he said suddenly. She looked up at him questioningly, and he added, “for the whole Lavender thing.”<br/>
“Ron, we’ve already talked about this.”<br/>
“I know, but — I already loved you when I started going with her. I mean, I got so jealous about Krum kissing you, and then I — I had sex with her, knowing I was hurting you. I’m an idiot.”<br/>
“Yes, you are,” she nodded, moving a bit away from him. “But as you yourself said, you’re my idiot.” She made a pause, as if weighing what to say, and then spoke again, “yes, I would have loved that you were my first kiss, or that our first time was together, but that won’t happen, so there’s no point in dwelling on that. Besides,” she added, and blushed a bit. “I cannot complain about all the things you’ve learned.”<br/>
He laughed. “At least there’s something I can teach you,” he said jokingly.<br/>
She laughed, too, and then looked down at herself. “We should go back,” she said. “I need a shower and to change these panties.”<br/>
“I think you look hot in them,” he said huskily.<br/>
She blushed. “I don’t know what made me let you ejaculate on me,” she admitted.<br/>
“Well, it was a surprise to me, but I’m so glad you did. I mean, that was hot as fuck, cumming all over your underwear …” he commented, a dreamy look on his face. Then he shook his head, as if to clear it, and looked at her, a smug smile on his face. “And you were turned on. Don’t you remember how quickly you came the second time?”<br/>
“Yes,” she said in a very low voice, her cheeks red in embarrassment. Fuck, she looked adorable!<br/>
“There is nothing to be embarrassed about, Hermione,” he told her in a soft voice.<br/>
“It’s dirty,” she replied.<br/>
“Yeah, it is,” he nodded. “In a good way.” She still looked unsure, so Ron caught her hands in his and lifted them to his mouth, so he could put a kiss on them. “I want you to be dirty with me. I want to be dirty with you. As long as it’s something we both want and enjoy, there’s nothing wrong with it.”<br/>
She pondered his words for a moment.<br/>
“I suppose not,” she said after a bit.<br/>
He grinned at her. “Exactly. Not let’s go back, before I pounce onto you again,” he said, tucking his cock back in and fastening his trousers. Hermione got up, too, and straightened her clothes before putting her robe back on, squirming a bit.<br/>
“Are you OK?” he asked her.<br/>
“A bit uncomfortable,” she admitted.<br/>
“Take them off.”<br/>
“Ron!” she admonished, scandalised. “I won’t walk through Hogwarts without my knickers!”<br/>
“Shame,” he said playfully. She swatted him on the arm, and he laughed. Then he clutched her hand in his and they left the classroom, happy and content that they were together.</p>
