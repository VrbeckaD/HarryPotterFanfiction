</p><p>Sirius sat there for hours trying to think of how to tell Remus that he was staying with James for the rest of the summer. Without telling him what had happened. They were meant to meet up in Diagon Alley later this afternoon but Sirius didn't want Remus seeing him like this.</p><p>He knew that his boyfriend would have a major conniption and probably go and do something stupid. Sirius thought back to the other night when he had barely escaped with his life. If it wasn't for James and the emergency portkey he would have been dead.</p><p>
  <em>Flashback</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sirius was in his room writing to Remus and had just rolled the piece of parchment up and given it to the owl when his mother Walburga blasted the door open. “Boy, get down stairs now, they are here to collect you to take you to him, you will do what they say.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sirius knew who she meant straight away and became frightened. He didn't want to become a death eater. What would they make him do? What would his friends think? What would Remus think? He quickly grabbed his wand and hid it up his sleeve. He checked that James’ chain was still around his neck and went downstairs to face his fate.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>When he got down stairs it was Bellatrix and Lucius waiting for him. That was his first clue that something wasn't right. “Come here baby cousin, we are just going to take a little trip, we won't be long.” said his cousin with a smirk and an evil glint in her eyes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>That was when Sirius definitely knew that he had made the right decision bringing his emergency portkey. He hesitated so Lucius his cousin Narcissa’s husband grabbed his arm dragged Sirius to him and apparated.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sirius felt the tight feeling in his chest and couldn't breathe for a minute then just as sudden it disappeared. He looked around as he was looking around he heard another loud pop and realised Bellatrix had arrived. They were in some clearing of some dark and dank forest.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lucius pushed Sirius away and he landed hard on his back. Bellatrix told him to stand up and when he wouldn't, when he refused to she pointed her wand at him and he knew exactly where this was going before she said the words and Sirius braced for the excruciating pain that was to come. “Crucio” she said in a clear and controlled manner and the red light shot towards him and when it hit him, he bit his tongue so he wouldn't scream.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The pain was indescribable, it was the worst pain he had ever felt, like a thousand swords being punctured through his body at once. She let up after some time and leant over Sirius and said “now dear cousin, are you going to get up and face us or are you going to lie on the ground like the cowardly, despicable lion, now your mother thinks we are taking you to him, but we aren't we are under orders to have some fun.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>At this point she stood up and Lucius said a spell Sirius had never heard of “Dolor Intrinsecus” a purple light shot at him and this time he couldn't help but scream at the pain that felt like it was ripping him apart from the inside out, this was worse than the cruciatus curse.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“That hit the spot dear, would you teach me?” Bellatrix preened at Lucius he chuckled and came up behind her and grabbed her wand arm.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You move your wand in a downward slash like so” at this moment he leant down and nibbled on her ear and said “then my dear, just say the incantation Dolor Intrinsecus”. Sirius was shocked that he would be like this with her when he was married to her sister but why should he be surprised Sirius thought he is a vile death eater.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The torture went on for hours by the end of it Sirius didn't even have the energy to move his arm to use the portkey. Lucius walked over to him and said “what a weak little lion you are, you weren't even brave enough to stand up”. Then he kicked Sirius in the ribs and for what was probably the fiftieth time in the last few hours he lost his breath.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>They grabbed him up and apparated into the drawing room of his horrid mothers house. When Sirius looked up she was standing there looking as happy as could be. Lucius and Bellatrix said their goodbyes and left.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He tried to stand up when she pulled her wand on him and used a cutting curse and said “you should be ashamed of yourself boy, that was a test and you failed, now you must pay.” As she went to raise her wand again Sirius got a sudden burst of energy just enough to reach up and tap the portkey with his wand that was still up his sleeve.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Just as he felt the lurch and saw the bright light coming at him from his mother's wand he disappeared and when he landed in the Entrance Way of the Potter Manor all he had time to do was say “help” in a slight voice and then the blackness surrounded him.</em>
</p><p>That was four days ago and Sirius had only just woken up and he had 3 letters from Remus, the first one was saying how excited he was to meet up in Diagon Alley, the second asking if Sirius still wanted to meet up and the third asking what the hell was going on to keep Sirius from writing to him.</p><p>Sirius could tell from the quick and messy scrawl that was the letter that he was worried. Just as Sirius pulled out a piece of parchment to write back to Remus, an owl started irately scratching at the window. He opened the window let it in and untied the letter that was attached as soon as He saw the handwriting he knew that it was Remus again.</p><p>He opened the letter and read it to himself:</p><p align="center">
  <b> <em>Dear Sirius,</em> </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b> <em>I am assuming the worst has happened and that you are in some kind of trouble, I hope that this letter finds you well but if it doesn't and I don't get a response to this letter I am coming to your house.</em> </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b> <em>I don't care what happens I am worried about you and need to see that you are safe. So I am giving you 4 hours and then I am coming to get you no matter what I have to do to get you out.</em> </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b> <em>I hope that this letter has found you,</em> </b>
</p><p align="center">
  <b> <em>Love always your Remus.</em> </b>
</p><p><em>Shit! Shit! Shit!</em> He was going to go ape when Sirius told him… if he told him. No he had to. He was having a war within himself but knew he would have to tell him otherwise Sirius would be doing something he absolutely detested, lying.</p><p>He quickly summoned his parchment, quill and ink and got to writing to him.</p><p align="center">
  <b> <em>My dear Moony,</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>I'm sorry that I haven't been in contact with you over the past few days I have been incapacitated, I know that sounds suspicious. I want to say first that I am now safe and that I am staying with Prongs. Please, please don't get angry and do something stupid when you read this I don't want that on my conscious.</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Okay here I go</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>The other night just after I wrote to you to say yes to meeting in Diagon Alley my mother came to get me under the guise of death eaters taking me to him I was so scared and all I could think of was never seeing you again.</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>I had to go with her because otherwise it would have been worse. When I got down stairs none other than my dear cousin Bellatrix and Lucius were waiting for me.</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>They took me between them and apparated to a forest, I knew instantly that something was wrong and soon found out just how wrong I was. I was tortured by them for hours. All I could think of was never getting out of there and seeing you and the marauders.</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>I thought I was going to die there but after a few hours they stopped and took me home. Mother was waiting for me and started the torture again because I had shamed the family. I only got out of there because of the emergency portkey that James gave me.</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>I'm still pretty beat up and I am in a lot of pain. If you still want to see me Mrs P said that you could come here as she won't let me leave the house until she can go with me.</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Please promise me you won't do anything I just want you to come see me and not have to deal with my family.</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Love always and forever,</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Your Padfoot</em> </b>
</p><p>Sirius read over the letter to make sure he had everything he wanted to include rolled it up and gave it to the owl and said <em>“please hurry.”</em></p><p>It was 2 hours before he heard anything back and it wasn't in the way he thought it would be, there was a knock on the door and then it opened he thought it was going to be Mrs P or James coming to check on him again but it was even better.</p><p> </p>
