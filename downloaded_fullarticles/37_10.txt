    <p>
  <span>This was the sixth time that Voldemort had woken up that day, and the fourth time that Harry had had this very same argument.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry had </span>
  <em>
    <span>warned</span>
  </em>
  <span> Voldemort that he needed to cast regular heating charms, lest his body give him a fever to ratchet up his internal temperature. He’d </span>
  <em>
    <span>told</span>
  </em>
  <span> him to cast impervious charms to keep himself from catching a chill. Did he listen?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course not. And now Harry had a grumpy, combative Dark Lord in bed, determined to prove that he was healthy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m perfectly fine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve had cold sweats and a fever for the past two days. Now it sounds like you’re about to cough out a lung. Admit it, Tom, you’re sick.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t call me Tom.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Either you’re Voldemort or you’re sick. Pick one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sick,” Voldemort objected, turning his head away to glare at the wall. “36°C is a perfectly acceptable temperature.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For a normal human,” Harry sighed, exasperated. He reached out and laid his hand across Voldemort’s forehead, ignoring the Dark Lord’s irritated hiss. “You’re practically a reptile. You aren’t supposed to go over 29°C, you heard what the mediwitch said.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If that were the case, I’d already be dead,” Voldemort grumbled. “My internal temperature is </span>
  <em>
    <span>fine.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your magic is the only thing keeping you alive,” Harry said. “A lesser wizard </span>
  <em>
    <span>would</span>
  </em>
  <span> be dead.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Voldemort turned his head back. He drew his lips back, revealing his sharp fangs as he practically leered at Harry. “That almost sounded like a compliment, my dear.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry flushed. “Shut up. That’s not what I meant, and you know it,” he said. “You’re depleting your magic at a rate even you can’t sustain. You’re feeling tired already, I can tell.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>”You can't tell anything, because I’m fine—” Voldemort’s protests were cut off by a fit of racking coughs. The Dark Lord leaned forward and clutched at his throat with thin, scrambling fingers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shit, Tom. Here—” Harry grabbed a towel from a nearby cart and held it out. “Cough into this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t need—” Voldemort’s expression twisted. He snatched the towel from Harry’s hands and held it up to his mouth, his face contorting as he coughed violently into the towel. When he drew away, there were splatters of blood on the fabric.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry wordlessly handed Voldemort a glass of water.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Voldemort muttered, not meeting Harry’s eyes. He sipped the water slowly, his grip tight around the glass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You need to see a proper Healer,” Harry said quietly, picking up the towel and Vanishing away the bloodstains.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t trust the Healers,” Voldemort said darkly. “They have no idea how my body works. Nobody does. I can do everything they can do, and I can do it </span>
  <em>
    <span>better—”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can do it when you’re healthy,” Harry snapped, his patience wearing thin. “Get over yourself, Tom, you need help or </span>
  <em>
    <span>you are going to die.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Voldemort blanched. “I won’t die,” he hissed, lunging forward and grabbing Harry’s wrists, pulling Harry in close. “I can’t die. Imply otherwise, and I will </span>
  <em>
    <span>end you.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry ignored Voldemort’s threats. “I can’t let you die either,” Harry snarled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, you can’t,” Voldemort snarled back. “Because if I die, you die. So stop pestering me, and let me heal myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry let out a strangled sound of frustration and attempted to wrench his arms away. When that failed, Voldemort’s grip too strong despite his illness, Harry gave up and leaned into the Dark Lord’s grip, pressing his forehead against Voldemort’s sternly. “I don’t want you to die, you stupid, stubborn man, because I lo— I care about you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Voldemort shook his head, his eyes shutting tightly. “No, you don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do.” His wrists still held in Voldemort’s tight grip, Harry took Voldemort’s face in his hands, brushing his fingertips across the Dark Lord’s sharp cheekbones.  “Let me take care of you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t need you to take care of me,” Voldemort repeated, even as he slumped back down into his hospital bed, dropping his hold on Harry in favour of wrapping his arms around himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop it. I want to,” Harry said firmly. He finally sat down on the edge of Voldemort’s bed, ignoring the way Voldemort cringed away, and Conjured a cool cloth, which he laid across Voldemort’s warm forehead. “You don’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>have</span>
  </em>
  <span> to push away everyone who cares about you, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Were Voldemort healthy, he probably would’ve jinxed Harry for that comment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I die, I’m going to haunt you for eternity,” Voldemort mumbled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought you said you couldn’t die,” Harry replied, grinning to himself at Voldemort’s surrender. “When did you last take a Pepperup Potion?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Two hours…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You get another in half an hour. And you have to drink it— I don’t care if it wasn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>artisanally crafted </span>
  </em>
  <span>by the </span>
  <em>
    <span>finest of brewers</span>
  </em>
  <span>, it’ll help.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’ll </span>
  <em>
    <span>barely</span>
  </em>
  <span> help.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, you gave in, you aren’t allowed to argue with me anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Voldemort hissed indignantly. “That’s not how it works.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry, did you hear something? I thought I heard someone who should be resting </span>
  <em>
    <span>arguing</span>
  </em>
  <span> with his sole caretaker…”</span>
