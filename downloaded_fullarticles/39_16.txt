  <em>1<sup>st</sup> June, 2003 – Cokeworth, The Midlands, England </em>
</p><p>                The little park on the hill that divided the proper side of Cokeworth from the grubby neighborhoods closer to the dirt-choked water had been untouched by time to Petunia’s eyes, the weeds still pushing their way through the unshorn grasses as they had in her youth, the chain links on the swing set still rusting and creaking and looking as though one good breeze could pull them down.</p><p>                It seemed like the only thing that had changed here in the many years since she left it for good was her. Or perhaps she hadn’t changed at all, and the world had changed around her.</p><p>                And that, perhaps, was the problem to begin with.</p><p>                A warm breeze caught her ash-blonde hair and blew it into her long, thin face. She’d let it go a bit longer these days, thinking it made her look more youthful. Vernon had made an offhand comment that it was pleasant to look at it that way, and so she had dutifully continued to let it grow till it reached her shoulders again. She had done a great many things to please him over their twenty-five years of marriage, for all the good it had done her in the end.</p><p>                With a little sigh she seated herself on one of the rusting swings, ignoring the ear-splitting groan of the weathered rubber and rickety chains from her weight being added. When she closed her eyes, she could still hear the soft giggles of that tramp from Vernon’s firm, and the creaking of their mattress springs. He hadn’t even had the decency to sleep with another woman in some other place, sneaking the twenty-something into their home while Petunia was supposed to be on a day trip out to visit Dudley. Instead, she’d forgotten her handbag and turned around. It had only been half an hour – thirty bloody minutes, he couldn’t even wait a full hour’s time for her to be gone – when she returned in time to overhear THAT from the stairs.</p><p>                Wincing at her memories from earlier that day, Petunia reached a hand up to touch the reddened welt on her face, the sting and the sharp thwack of flesh on flesh etched into her mind. She’d been near hysterics, all but frothing with rage when she slammed open their bedroom door. The moments after went in a blur; a flash of pink lace from the secretary’s risqué nightie, a glimpse of pert breasts swaying as the younger woman leapt from the bed, and the sight of Vernon’s eyes bulging out in alarm at being caught as he struggled to pull his pants from where they hung precariously on the bedpost.</p><p>                Petunia couldn’t recall what words she had even been saying when Vernon’s hand flew at her face. But she could recall the gasp from the secretary who cowered in the corner with the quilt held to her front. And she could recall Vernon’s insistence that he had done nothing wrong in striking her, his growling voice as he claimed “You gave me no choice, Petunia! I didn’t want to strike you but you must get a hold of yourself!”. And she could recall her own little noise of pain, a small discordant half-squeak, half-groan that marked the moment her perfect, normal life became one of those perfect household dramas that she had so loved to make snide remarks about when gossiping to her other neighbors.</p><p>                What would they in turn say about her now, she wondered? Would Emma and Jean whisper about her over their garden fences as they looked over at Number Four? How could she even show her face at the market, or the shopping district?</p><p>                She couldn’t show her face, she realized. And what was she even supposed to do in response to something like this? In her mother’s time, it would have been expected that a woman turn herself away and ignore her husband’s infidelity, chalking it to her wifely duty to simply indulge the breadwinner. Up till about an hour ago, midway through her silent drive to her hometown, Petunia thought of herself as the sort of woman who would do just such a thing, keeping her perfect façade up at all times, and keeping the neighbors out of her private affairs. Divorce was unthinkable, unspoken of even now.</p><p>                Petunia chanced a gentle sway on the aging swing set, pushing off with her sensible navy-blue flats and noting without truly caring that she had just gotten a few spots of mud on their fronts. It was remarkable how little she cared, or felt at all. The anger had gone out of her at the same time as Vernon’s hand had fallen upon her, along with the other emotions she might have felt. In the last few years since her Dudley had moved out and settled into his own little life with a nice girl from a good, normal family, she had attempted to fill the unsettling emptiness with her old comforts of gossip and entertaining guests. And it worked for a short time.</p><p>                Or at least, she had told herself it had. Sitting here now with the breeze still flowing around her, the hollowness returned and she swore she could hear it in the whisper of the foliage, <em>you were never as clever, never as pretty, never as wanted, never as loved…</em></p><p>                No. She wasn’t. She knew that already. But for over twenty years, she had convinced herself that she was just as good – better, even – than her precious little sister just by virtue of her normality and the fact that she hadn’t gotten herself killed like Lily had. But in her short life, Lily had been part of something great, hadn’t she? That’s how her nephew and the people like him said it. Lily was some sort of heroic figure, some freak legend with a statue of herself and her arrogant husband near her grave. Petunia had come to realize in the past hour that she hadn’t left her own mark on anything like that.</p><p>                She shook her handbag free of her shoulder, and swept her hand into its folds till it came up with the small pill bottle, full of the anxiety medication her doctor had prescribed her for her nerves when they returned from their life in hiding during that last year of nastiness with that group of Wizard supremacists. It was a fresh refill, at least a month’s worth. She figured that after the first little handful she would be too blissful to feel much else, they were quite fast acting after all. Another few swallows to empty the bottle, and then perhaps she would kick off her flats and let the tall grass tickle her feet. She could enjoy the sunset like she used to do with Lily when they were still silly little girls talking about what actors they fancied, playing princesses and explorers in this same place.</p><p>                And then perhaps she would finally see Lily again and give her a stern talking to for daring to die before her and leaving her with a second infant to raise. Yes, she would see Lily again and she would give her the lecture she ought to have given before she married that Potter boy. She would see her Lil again, wouldn’t she? Petunia didn’t actually know if wizards went to the same afterlife, or if the virtue of their abnormal powers damned them from the onset. There were so many things she didn’t know about Lily and her kind. She had been too concerned with appearing unconcerned to ask.</p><p>                Petunia unscrewed the thick white plastic cap from the bottle and poured a measure of the tiny yellow oblong pills into the palm of her hand, cupping them carefully and tipping them into her mouth as one might do to a handful of crisps or miniature sweets. It was difficult to swallow them all at once, but swallow them she did.</p><p>                Her thoughts again went to the neighbors. How long would it take someone to find her and figure who she was? She swallowed another small handful, pausing to look at the light fading from the sky as the sun set over the poor side of town which sat mostly abandoned now. Was this really worth leaving everything behind for? Well what was the alternative for her, go back and let Vernon explain away his affair and make it her fault? Refuse his non-apology and separate? Then what? She had no skill outside of her homemaking and nothing else to fall back on. The emptiness she fought so hard to fill had never been filled with anything, the fullness was a phantom masquerading as a life with purpose. The pain had always been there, but she had found ways to lie to herself about it.</p><p>                Petunia felt a pang of guilt as her son came to mind, her sweet Diddykins who needed her still – surely, he must’ve. What boy didn’t need his mother? Again, Lily came into her mind unbidden as did her waif of a nephew – the nephew she mistreated in her twisted jealousy. The boy had nothing to do with his mother’s perfection, or the Evans sisters’ falling out. The regrets swirled round her in a sequence, like the flower petals that her little Lil used to move with just a thought.</p><p>                She lay her head against one of the rusting chains, and her eyes fluttered shut.</p>
<hr/><p>                The sound of a tea kettle’s shrill whistle broke the stillness and roused Petunia from her stupor. Startled, she sat up and found herself settled into a large plush armchair of burgundy leather. She had no recollection of anything beyond closing her eyes what felt like hours before.</p><p>                “Ah, Miss Petunia. You’ve finally woken. Please, do not be alarmed.”</p><p>                Petunia turned towards the source of the voice, and found a familiar looking old man in loudly patterned purple robes patterned with blue stripes and golden stars. The twinkle in his sharp blue eyes matched the stars, which in turn matched his gold-rimmed half moon spectacles.</p><p>                “You’re dead. My nephew said as much years ago.” She eyed him cautiously, sliding further back into the butter-soft leather of the chair. Wherever she was, she had no idea why this man was here right now. Had she not taken enough of the pills? Was she in a deep sleep, or a coma even? She was certain that there was no way that she would have ended up in a place with Lily’s kind.</p><p>                Albus Dumbledore smiled down as kindly as he could at her, pouring a cup of piping hot tea for Petunia with the kettle he pulled from the heating plate. The fragrant scent of rosehip and hibiscus wafted from the delicate white and pink floral printed china cup.</p><p>                “Yes, Miss Petunia. I most certainly am. But you, dear girl – you are not quite yet. And that is precisely why we are here to have a conversation. Please do take a drink, I believe you will find this blend particularly pleasant. Perhaps paired with an iced lemon cake?” The old man gestured with a knobby hand to the tray of stacked pastries just beside the tea service.</p><p>                Still believing herself to be in a dream, Petunia nonetheless reached forward and took the cup and saucer into her hands. The porcelain felt warm to her touch. She settled uneasily back against the chair and looked around the room. It was a charming little tea shop from the look of it, cozy and inviting and decorated in more burgundy with golden trim, dark wood grain for the furniture. It looked so strangely familiar, down to the armchairs and the little circular tables, with flowers as a running motif.</p><p>                Petunia turned her eyes back to the strange old wizard who had seated himself across the table. “Where am I? And why is this tea shop so familiar? I’m certain I’ve never been any place like it.”</p><p>                “Do you not recall the dream you once shared with your younger sister? My dear, I am so sorry that you seem to have lost that spark you once held. Wherever has that little girl gone who so dearly wanted to attend school with her best friend?”</p><p>                “Don’t mock me you old loon! That was your fault that I couldn’t be with-” she cut herself off as the first part of the headmaster’s statement sank in. The dream she once shared with Lily…how could she have ever forgotten such a thing? It had been all they talked about once, a thing they chattered on about into the late hours of the night when they were supposed to be sleeping.</p><p>                <em>“We’ll make a teashop, Tuney!” Lily had whispered with a giggle. “Petunia and Lily’s Petal Parlor!”</em></p><p>
  <em>                “Yes, we will,” Petunia would reply, stifling her own laughter of joy at their little dream, “and we’ll serve the finest tea in all of Britain, and Prince Charles himself will come to visit!” </em>
</p><p>                Dumbledore was still looking at her with that frustrating twinkle in his eyes, like he was holding a private joke and waiting for her to catch on to it as well.</p><p>                “…what’s happening? Have I died and now I’m stuck between? Or is this some sick magic joke that your kind likes to play on normal people like me?” she hissed at him.</p><p>                He shook his head and sipped his own cup of tea. “No, Miss Petunia. You have not died – yet. Nor do “my kind” as you so call us do this sort of thing. Not without severe repercussion. You are however in a place between. Neither dead nor fully alive. But that is why I am here as well.”</p><p>                Though still not trusting that this wasn’t a trick, she took a sip of the tea in her hand. Begrudgingly she admitted to herself that it tasted as good as it smelled. She waved a hand to prompt Dumbledore to continue speaking. He nodded and obliged.</p><p>                “You have several strong regrets, it would seem. The strongest of which is tied to your sister. I quite understand, you see. I too made mistakes where my younger siblings are concerned. My little sister in particular is the source of perhaps my first and most painful mistake. I know intimately well the pain of losing a sister that you tried to forget.”</p><p>                The pain in the old wizard’s voice sounded sincere enough that Petunia found herself feeling bad for him, to a degree. His words cut her to the core regardless, as she thought of her falling out with Lily, and all the times she pushed her away and insisted that she couldn’t stand her any longer.</p><p>                “So, you can empathize with my mistake. What of it?”</p><p>                “Though you may not think yourself particularly talented Miss Petunia, I can assure you that you are most certainly special. And not mending the rift between you was a particular regret of your sister’s, right to the day she died. You felt enough about her to have sent a vase for Christmas once-”</p><p>                “I hated that vase, it was hideous.” She interjected.</p><p>                Once again that amused and knowing smile was fixed on her, but Dumbledore shook his head gently and moved past this statement with a chuckle. “Nonetheless, you loved your sister to the last. And love is the most powerful force in life or death. That love between the pair of you is stronger than either of you realized. And because of it, I am here to offer you a choice.”</p><p>                Petunia took another sip of her tea, looking at him over the rim of the cup. “Is this where you tell me I can go back to life and start over as a new woman? Leave Vernon and move to London and start again like this is some awful made-for-telly movie? That is hardly a choice.”</p><p>                “You were partially correct. You can go back to the living world, but not in the way you think. Either way, this current timeline has run its course for you. Should you decide to cross forward, away from this place between, then you shall leave the living world behind for the place beyond. Should you decide that you would like to return to the living world, then you have the unique opportunity that many a person wishes they could have: the chance to return to the past, and rewrite your history.”</p><p>                Cup hit saucer with a clatter as she set it down far harder than intended. “A chance to <em>what </em>?”</p><p>                The twinkle was finally out of his eyes, and the former headmaster looked deadly serious. “It is rather much to take in, I am sure. But we are fast running out of time for you to decide. There are a number of lives that you can even save this time – including Lily’s.”</p><p>                It didn’t sound real. It could not have possibly been real, she told herself. But a small voice in the back of her mind reminded her that in another lifetime, she never would have believed that her sister floating onto the ground from a swing set was real either. Or her brother in law turning into a giant stag was possible. Or that any number of magical things that she knew WERE real could happen at all.</p><p>                As Petunia let a small sliver of hope and possibility plant itself in her heart, she felt a cold and sour rush fill her to the core as if she had drunk ice-cold lemonade much too fast on a warm day.</p><p>                “You must feel it by now, the separation of your soul from your physical form. I do hate to rush you, Petunia. But there is only so much even a wizard can do when a higher power is involved.” He reached into his robes and produced what appeared to be a small hourglass, with shining silver sands almost like a morning mist within. The glass itself was slowly freezing over, the gold chain from which it dangled laced with tendrils of frost.</p><p>                As if drawn of its own accord, her left hand reached forward for the strange device. The cold in her torso was spreading up to her chest.</p><p>He pulled the hourglass pendant back towards himself a bit. “It will not be easy I must caution you. There are still great risks. And you will be placed back in a time of rising chaos. You must be brave, Petunia. And you must not be who you are, but who you need to be.”</p><p>                “I’ve had forty-five years to be who am I and I am quite tired of it, thank you kindly!” she spat as the cold rose into her throat. Whatever it was, she knew it was not a good feeling and it frightened her.</p><p>                The wizard nodded sagely, smiling at her as he turned the hourglass over, and pressed it against her palm. An unnatural warmth suddenly ran down her arm into the rest of her body, spreading from fingertips to toes and banishing the cold. The silver mist burst forth from within, and enveloped her body, pulling her from the chair and cocooning her in light and warmth in mid-air.</p><p>                “I look forward to seeing you again in a new life, Miss Petunia. I wonder who you will be.”</p><p>                The last thing that Petunia saw was the soft smile and twin trails of tears running down the cheeks of the old man and into his beard before the light became blinding, and she once more gave herself over to nothingness.</p>
