    <p>He'd ended up spending around a year and a half with his sister, training to control his newfound powers. She'd given him a single challenge to prove that he'd become competent enough in his skills to stand on his own as a king. This challenge she'd set him had been simply to destroy a single one of her golden kings.</p>
<p>And it had taken him 19 months of constant training to achieve it. He'd learned how to harness his powers, how to defend himself from direct attacks. But most important, at least as far as Harry was concerned, was that he'd gained a sister in the process. She'd still be stern and proud, but after a while a degree of sisterly affection had entered her voice when she'd chided him. No longer were their interactions that of a teacher anxious to see if her student would grasp the wisdom which she'd imparted, instead it became more like a an older sibling looking proudly as their baby brother made their first steps, said their first word, learned their first spell and accidently killed their first league of cultists.</p>
<p>But after 19 months of continuous and driven effort Harry finally achieved a point where his sister felt him ready to face the world. So he did, They'd still regularly speak through Apollo's avian messenger, but for the remaining time Harry had wandered the world on his own. Or at least as "on-his-own" as a child accompanied by a legion of cows, bulls, wolves, sheep, boars, stags, cicada, locust, swans, ravens, guinea fowl, bears, snake-dragons, mice, hawks, griffins and dolphins could ever really be.</p>
<p>He'd had plenty of adventures over the years, fighting divine beasts. Meeting his older brother, fighting his older brother, fleeing from his older brother, killing all his older brother's wolves and ghost-slaves in a cloud of divine poison running away, meeting his younger-older sister, visiting the library of Alexandria, accidentally bumping into an oil-lamp while playing hide-and-go-seek with his dogs. Before returning to the future.</p>
<p>Truly Harry had a lot of adventures, some more chaotic then others and not all of which he'd gotten out of unscathed, but after all that time he'd returned to the land of his birth for a single mundane reason.</p>
<p>He wanted to go to school, At some point over the last 5 years he'd been told about his parents. And the origin of the scar he'd had before meeting Serqet. And he'd been told about the fate of the witches and the wizards of Britain.</p>
<p>He wanted to help them, to find a cure for the blindness they'd been struck with. Not much was known about the nature of the curse. But scholars suspected it to be caused by either the divine power of Poseidon or Discordia, though the strange sensory-depriving nature of the curse had proven to affect anyone who'd attempted to glean deeper. Speculation was abound though, just no concrete proof.</p>
<p>But as much as Harry would tell the world that he'd only gone to see if he could help them, really there was another reason. Harry wanted to know his legacy, to see the world his parent's new and figure out what had become of them.</p>
<p>And maybe just maybe he would get a break from this whole "being a king"-business. Getting recognised by everyone grew tiring after a while, and the expectations that he start ordering people around just didn't sit well with him. He'd met his brother and seen where that kind of power could lead him one day.</p>
<p>So he went, he knew when the letters would be sent out and had arrived in advance, but first he'd needed a place to stay. Luckily for Harry his pets were versatile. His cow's milk was highly sought after amongst the richer mages, something about "increasing fertility and stamina". The same went his wool, fabric warmer more comfortable then any mortal fabric that seemed to resist magical attacks and even stopped small calibre bullets, and don't ask how he'd found that out.</p>
<p>So after 5 years of milking the herd of Admetus and shearing the flock of Apollo Harry had managed to save up enough money to purchase a small but luxurious apartment in Downtown London. Manifesting an avatar to turn into a white raven Harry had flown over walls outside of the Leaky Cauldron and converted a not-insignificant amount of wizarding currency.</p>
<p>Harry had arrived in Britain ahead of time for only a single reason; Wands. Harry didn't know whether a regular wand would work for him, and even if it did he was fairly sure it would be practically useless to him in a fight. So he'd decided to order a custom job for himself, and seeing as Ollivanders would no doubt be busy during the summer with the influx of young wizards and wizards he'd decided it would only be polite to order it in advance.</p>
<p>And so Harry spent an uneventful spring in England, having given Garrick Ollivander some horn's and tusks his familiars had lost in various fights over the years.</p>
<p>His wand was crafted from his boar's tusk, with a handle made from the antlers of Artemis' stags, with a core made out of wolf-fur, divine wool and swan's feathers, amongst others.</p>
<p>Intricate carvings of the sun and moon graced its ivory length, it was light and swishy, but brimming with divine might.</p>
<p>At some point During the summer, the doorbell rang. Harry leapt up, running down the hall in anticipation, almost tripping over his own legs in his haste. Harry opened the door and revealed a bearded old man wearing a rainbow-coloured coat, carrying a parchment envelope embedded with a purple seal.</p>
<p>"Hello Mister Potter, My name's Albus Dumbledoreâ€¦" the man said, a smile on his face and tears in his eyes "You've had us all worried for quite a while."</p><hr/>

  <strong>So, update speed is probably going to slow down from here on out, this for the simple reason that this is the point where we start seeing actual interactions with characters in their canon-state, and i want to take extra time to get that stuff right.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>This particular chapter took a long while because i wanted to check a few vital facts, pre-script the entire book and all it's plotpoints and even create a rough outline as to the fight against it's final-boss (Hint: It's not Quirrelmort). And compare the canons to see if there's any gaping plotholes I've forgotten. Interesting trivia: Voban is in his 300's, making him possibly half as young as Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel.</strong>
