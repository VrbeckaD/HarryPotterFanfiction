    <p>Theseus stormed about the room, red in the face and snarling at anyone who came near him.</p>
<p>"Alright, where is he?!"</p>
<p>In perhaps one of the best displays of foolish bravery, an aide made a brave attempt at settling him down. "Mr. Scamander, please! Someone will bring your brother in shortly, just-"</p>
<p>But that was as far as he got before Theseus lashed at him.</p>
<p>"I need to see him, NOW!"</p>
<p>The aide retreated back just as the door swung open and Percival strode into the room.</p>
<p>"Sit down, Theseus," Percival demanded curtly. "I can't have you scaring off all of the young recruits. Again."</p>
<p>Theseus flopped down in a chair immediately, but he hadn't calmed an ounce. "Look, I just want to see Newt," he grounded out through his teeth.</p>
<p>Percival leaned against his desk and sighed. "I know. But at the moment, it would seem everyone does. He's utterly exhausted by the whole ordeal, and I'm afraid you're a bit late to the party."</p>
<p>Theseus looked a bit admonished. "The very second the post arrived, I dropped everything! It's not as though boats are particularly quick!"</p>
<p>Percival put his hands up in defense. "I didn't mean to suggest that you're an uncaring brother, Theseus. But it's all been a bit much and you know what happens when he's had enough, don't you?"</p>
<p>Theseus appeared to deflate a little. "Of course I do, it's just... How bad off is he?"</p>
<p>Percival looked away for a moment, deciding how much he should tell. "Well, he-"</p>
<p>"Hello?"</p>
<p>Every eye in the room was drawn suddenly to the doorway, where a reserved redhead was shifting about.</p>
<p>"Newt!" Percival exclaimed. "You shouldn't be milling around by yourself! Where's Mr. Kowalski?"</p>
<p>Newt smiled sheepishly, his eyes darting about the room. "I, um..."</p>
<p>Not a moment later, Jacob came running- completely out of breath. "No one... should be able... to go... that fast... on crutches!"</p>
<p>"You're not even supposed to be using crutches yet, Newt," Percival chastised.</p>
<p>Jacob pointed at Newt, appearing gently irritated. "Wizard who... cried freedom."</p>
<p>"As if by an unseen force, Newt is compelled to directly disobey every rule meant only to help him," Theseus asserted.</p>
<p>And without saying word, Newt began hobbling across the room toward Theseus. Jacob made to help him, but Newt never hesitated once as he ambled along on one leg; the other leg appeared immobile, strapped up in a black, stiff-looking brace. He seemed completely unperturbed by dragging his unusable limb behind him as he pulled himself forward with his wooden crutches.</p>
<p>But Theseus knew better. He stood up as Newt reached him and gave him a quick but soft embrace.</p>
<p>"We've got to talk about this, you know," Theseus said quietly.</p>
<p>Newt nodded, his gaze roaming about in an obvious sign of discomfort. "I know..."</p>
<p>"But for now... I read your book."</p>
<p>Newt smiled, grateful that he wasn't being interrogated just yet. For once, he didn't have recount in excruciating detail what had be done to prevent catastrophe.</p>
