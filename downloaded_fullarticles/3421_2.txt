  <em> Hogossip! Fresh from the cauldron! </em>
</p><p>
  <em> This week, we received an anonymous tip off about the REAL reason the Quidditch shed has been placed under a timed-entry charm. We’re not going into any of the gory details, so if you want to know exactly what went down, we suggest you ask Jacob Finch-Fletchley and Kelly Gates what took them so long to find their brooms ;);) </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The Quidditch shed is practically a no-go zone now. The new charm means students can enter for no longer than two minutes. Although from what we’ve heard, that won’t be a problem for Mr Finch-Fletchley! </em>
</p><p>
  <em> If you have a story to share, send an owl (or pass a note) to Melissa Lockhart @ Hogossip </em>
</p><p>“Didn’t I tell you they were going at it?” Polly lowered the copy of <em> Hogossip </em>dramatically and looked around at everyone with raised eyebrows.</p><p>“Um, did you?” Albus questioned her uncertainly, trying to remember any time Polly had talked about the subject.</p><p>“Yes! You remember, Thea?”</p><p>Thea frowned. “Which one’s Kelly Gates again?”</p><p>“Hufflepuff, blonde, always looks like she’s been hit with a cheering charm,” Rose put in helpfully.</p><p>“She doesn’t look too cheerful today,” Albus commented, pointing Kelly Gates out. She was surrounded by friends who all appeared to be consoling her, but as Albus watched, her tearful expression switched to a murderous one.</p><p>“Oh, here we go,” Polly muttered, sounding almost excited as Kelly spotted Jacob Finch-Fletchley entering the Great Hall and started to stalk over to him.</p><p>As Kelly started to loudly accuse Jacob of sending in the tip off himself, Albus tuned out of the situation and gazed around. He often felt like this, sort of just on the outside of everything that was going on, not excluded, but separated from the rest of the world. He was <em> different </em>and nobody would ever understand. Not even his closest friends.</p><p>Rose was laughing lightly and buttering a slice of toast. She was Albus’ cousin, their parents had been best friends at school, and it had always been assumed that Albus and Rose would continue that trend where they were so close in age. Rose was dependable, ruthless and Albus found her completely hilarious.</p><p>After they were both sorted into Gryffindor in their first year, they’d met Polly Chapman, who’d quickly become one of Albus’ best friends. She had dreams to become a journalist, and she was always one of the first people with a copy of <em> Hogossip </em> , which - like today - she often read to them over breakfast like it was the <em> Daily Prophet. </em></p><p>Thea Jordan moved from Ilvermorny to Hogwarts for her seventh year and had slotted into the group quite nicely. Albus liked her a lot, because she never looked at him as anything other than who he really was.</p><p>They were Albus’ best friends amongst a sea of acquaintances. Having a famous father and an older brother who played professional Quidditch meant Albus was far from unpopular, but he much preferred the company of those who just saw Al, and not Harry’s son or James’ brother. Not that anyone could ever see the <em> real </em>Al, not when he was hiding such a big part of himself from the world.</p><p>“Do you think it really was Jacob who sent in the anonymous tip-off?” Rose wondered.</p><p>“He’s always been a bit of an attention-seeker,” Polly commented. “I wouldn’t be surprised if he had, he probably thought it would put a stop to the other rumours.”</p><p>Because Albus had a secret, a secret not even his best friends or his family knew. Not even his older brother, James.</p><p>“What other rumours?” Thea asked, sounding quite uninterested.</p><p>And it wasn’t that he necessarily <em> wanted </em>to keep it a secret.</p><p>Polly grinned. “Well, anyone with half a brain can see he’s clearly gay.”</p><p>Albus squeaked involuntarily but luckily it was drowned out by Rose’s loud scoff.</p><p>“No way. He isn’t gay.” She shook her head emphatically. “You’ve been reading too much <em> Hogossip.” </em></p><p>Albus felt his cheeks grow warm and he sipped his coffee as nonchalantly as he could.</p><p>
  <img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/50b15244e0b573589f0bd48b3f1625d1/tumblr_pdyz1iWgET1skyoq2o1_1280.png" alt="" width="340" height="259" align="“center”/" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1792732706" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1792732706" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/>
</p><p>“Of course I have, but come on! Don’t you get a bit of a… vibe?” She looked at Thea.</p><p>“A vibe? It’s not some kind of secret club, Polly,” Thea sounded disbelieving. “Just because his hair is always perfectly blow-dried into place…”</p><p>The three girls dissolved into giggles. Albus clattered his coffee mug down loudly and stood up far more abruptly than he’d meant to, attracting everybody’s attention.</p><p>“I’ll meet you in Potions, I left my homework in the common room.”</p><p>He left the Great Hall as fast as he could without full-on running and, without even thinking, headed across the Entrance Hall and straight outside. A gaggle of fourth-years going to a first period Care of Magical Creatures lesson barely spared Albus a second glance; he was just another stress-addled seventh year acting weirdly.</p><p>Albus approached the lake and sat in front of it, curling himself up into a small ball as if that might make him temporarily invisible. He stared at the surface of the lake as his friends’ words reverberated around his brain.</p><p>
  <em> He’s clearly gay. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Don’t get you a bit of a… vibe? </em>
</p><p>Albus swallowed hard and tried to sort through the jumble of emotions he was feeling. He’d known for sure he was gay for three years now, and at no point in that time had he felt compelled to tell anyone. Instead, he was happy for his friends to continue thinking he was just very picky with girls or not interested in relationships.</p><p>His sexuality wasn’t his only secret, but it was the one thing he’d never told another soul, not even Polly or Rose.</p><p>Polly and Rose both thought they knew all of Albus’ secrets. Like the fact that he’d been writing songs for over two years now and held a secret dream to record them and make a name for himself one day. Everyone else thought Albus would end up going into potioneering, as it was his best subject and in his family history. Albus knew he probably <em> should </em>make a sensible decision and apply for his potioneer’s licence and get a job at a brewery like everyone expected; he was good enough to.</p><p>But music was where his passion lay, just like his brother James’ passion was Quidditch. And James had followed his dream and made it as the youngest starting Chaser Puddlemere United had ever recruited. So why couldn’t Albus make it too?</p><p>
  <em> Don’t you get a bit of a… vibe? </em>
</p><p>Did <em> he </em> give off some sort of gay vibe? Was that even a thing? Were there clusters of friends sitting at breakfast and discussing the vibes <em> Albus </em>gave off, just like his friends had talked about Jacob?</p><p>
  <em> His hair’s always perfect blow-dried. </em>
</p><p>Albus chuckled to himself and ran a hand through his disaster of a hairstyle. It was dark, almost black, and never did anything Albus wanted it to, instead choosing to stick up all over the place despite his best efforts to tame it. He’d tried cutting it very short, he’d tried growing it out longer, he’d tried various potions, and then around fifth year he’d given up and had just started embracing the messiness.</p><p>Confident his hair wasn’t giving anyone any <em> vibes, </em>Albus took a deep breath and felt a lot calmer. Calm enough to go back inside and make it just in time for the start of Potions class.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>That night in the common room, Albus and his friends had managed to secure one of the big, round tables with the comfy chairs. Its surface was covered in mainly homework, but Rose was engrossed in her plans for that year’s Quidditch team; it was her second year as captain.</p><p>“Albus, I hope you’ve been practicing. I’m only taking you as Keeper again if you’re the best one, no special treatment.”</p><p>Albus rolled his eyes at his blunt cousin. “I know, I played with James a bit over summer.”</p><p>In truth, Albus wouldn’t mind too much if he was made a reserve for the Gryffindor Quidditch team this year. He enjoyed playing, and most of his friends played Quidditch, but he wasn’t emotionally invested in the sport like some of his classmates were.</p><p>“Oh, is that your plans for our team?” a smarmy voice called over Albus’ shoulder, peering uncomfortably close to Rose’s diagrams. She pulled them towards her and covered them with both arms.</p><p>“These are <em> my </em>plans, yes.” Rose didn’t look at the speaker.</p><p>Karl Jenkins invited himself into the only empty space at the table; Polly rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Of course, the competition will be completely different this year, especially Slytherin.” Karl spoke like they were all dying to hear his opinions. “That Cole Flint is rather tiresome if you ask me.”</p><p>“Nobody did,” Polly hissed under her breath.</p><p>Albus said nothing but gave Karl a disgusted look. Cole Flint was one of his friends, he was in Slytherin and he was one of the nicest people Albus knew.</p><p>“So, Thea,” Karl scooted close to her and she smiled in a nervous sort of way. “Trying out for the team?”</p><p>Thea looked away from him. “Yeah, I think so.”</p><p>Karl threw Albus a triumphant look and wiggled his eyebrows. “If you ever want to, you know, get together to practise some time, I’m an excellent coach. I’m thinking of doing a flying demonstration in this year’s talent show actually.” He paused as if expecting gasps of excitement at the prospect.</p><p>“Thanks, I’ll bear that in mind.” Thea smiled politely but made a point of going back to her homework.</p><p>“And it’ll help you, having a team insider’s advice.” He nudged Thea and winked.</p><p>“You’re not necessarily on the team, Karl,” Rose put in bitterly. “Tryouts are at the weekend.”</p><p>Karl waved his hand nonchalantly and didn’t even take his eyes off Thea. “Oh, those. A formality.” He stood up to leave, deliberately brushing past Thea’s shoulder in the process. “Can’t wait to be teammates.”</p><p>Thea shuddered the second he was out of sight. “He’s… friendly.”</p><p>“He’s a creep,” Rose scoffed, looking thoroughly disgruntled.</p><p>“Are you going to let him back on the team?” Polly asked, looking unimpressed.</p><p>Rose shook her head. “Not if I can help it. Even if he was the best beater at tryouts, his attitude’s awful.”</p><p>“Everyone knows <em> you’ll </em>be the best beater at tryouts, Rosie Posie,” Albus teased in a simpering voice.</p><p>“What do you want?” Rose eyed him suspiciously.</p><p>“Nothing! I can’t just be nice to you?”</p><p>“There’s some sort of sarcastic undertone to this that I’m not getting.” Rose gathered her Quidditch diagrams together. “I’m going to bed. Anyone else?”</p><p>Thea nodded, putting her homework away. “I’m done too.”</p><p>Polly gestured to the essay she was working on. “I should finish this.” She looked at Albus. “And I was hoping you might help me with the conclusion, Al?”</p><p>Albus nodded and smiled, accepting the potions essay Polly slid in his direction and running his eyes over it. Rose and Thea left together and Polly discreetly placed her hand over the writing Albus was reading. He looked up at her in surprise.</p><p>“What do you think of Thea?” she asked quietly.</p><p>“Um, I really like her. She’s cool, I’m glad we made friends.” He looked at Polly strangely. “Why, do you not like her?”</p><p>Polly shook her head. “No, I do! I really do like her too.”</p><p>“Okay, good.” Albus smiled and went back to reading her conclusion.</p><p>“Do you have a crush on her?” Polly blurted out.</p><p>Albus actually snorted out loud before he could stop himself. “What the hell, Polly? No I don’t have a crush on her.”</p><p>Suddenly, Albus went into an internal panic. Was it too telling that he didn’t have a crush on Thea? She was pretty and funny and clever and new to the school, maybe he was meant to have a crush on her.</p><p>“What makes you ask?” Albus asked as casually as he could.</p><p>“Just,” Polly hesitated and looked away, “I saw you looking at her a few times.”</p><p>Albus felt himself blush, which was stupid as he hadn’t ever been looking at Thea in any way. “No, definitely wasn’t like that. She’s, er, not my type.”</p><p>An awkward pause followed and Albus panicked that he was implying the wrong thing.</p><p>“Not because she’s black! I love black women.” He cringed at his own words. “Not like I have a <em> thing </em>for black women, I just, I just love all women and-“</p><p>“Albus,” Polly chuckled, cutting him off. He suddenly found he was breathing very fast.</p><p>“Sorry,” he muttered, although he couldn’t pinpoint what he was apologising for. “I think I’m going to go to bed too. Your conclusion looks great, goodnight, Pol.”</p><hr/><p>Albus took a late breakfast the next day, taking advantage of his early free period. He sleepily sat down at the steadily emptying Gryffindor table and pulled a mug towards him, filling it with coffee automatically. Polly was bouncing around on the balls of her feet as if she’d been waiting for him.</p><p>“I have to go to Care of Magical Creatures, but <em> look </em> at this, Al! I want to know who you think it is later!”</p><p>She threw a copy of <em> Hogossip </em>at him and left in a flurry of blonde hair and laughter. Albus rolled his eyes and pushed the paper aside, reaching for a piece of toast. Polly’s enthusiasm around the tiniest nuggets of gossip never failed to bewilder him.</p><p>People all around him were reading their own copies of <em> Hogossip </em>and whatever it said today was causing quite the stir. Albus wondered what Jacob Finch-Fletchley had done now as the loud conversation from the people beside him carried over.</p><p>“That Blakely boy in sixth year for sure!”</p><p>“What if it isn’t a boy?”</p><p>There was certainly an excited buzz of chatter, now Albus thought about it. Whatever <em> Hogossip </em>had reported on this week, it was hitting its mark. He spread jam on his toast and glanced down at the article, reading it upside down.</p><p>
  <em> Hogossip! Fresh from the cauldron! </em>
</p><p>
  <em> This is a post on behalf of a student, submitted to us anonymously. Listen up Hogwarts, someone has something to say. </em>
</p><p>Albus was intrigued, and he span the paper around to face him and read on.</p><p>
  <em> “Sometimes, I like to stand at the top of the Astronomy Tower in the middle of the night, and just look out at the stars. The universe is huge, and for a single second, I feel comforted by the fact that I am so small and insignificant in this big, wide world. I feel almost as if my worries don’t matter, because stars don’t have worries, they exist and shamelessly so. So this is my first step, into my own shameless existence too. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I’m gay, Hogwarts. Maybe one day I’ll be brave enough to say that out loud. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Stargazer” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Well, there we have it, kids! Poetic, isn’t it? </em>
</p><p>Albus couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t speak. The slice of toast which he’d been about to eat now seemed destined to remain untouched forever. He read the message through again, and then a third time.</p><p>There was somebody like him. Just like him.</p><p>
  <em> Stargazer. </em>
</p><p>In an instant, Albus abandoned his breakfast and, taking the article with him, headed straight for the owlery. As he walked, he thought about the words Stargazer had written.</p><p>
  <em> This is my first step into my own shameless existence. </em>
</p><p>He couldn’t imagine being brave enough to come out publicly like that, even anonymously, and he was supposed to be a Gryffindor. But despite being braver than him, Stargazer’s words resonated with Albus.</p><p>
  <em> Stars don’t have worries, they exist and shamelessly so. </em>
</p><p>When he reached the owlery, he unfolded the article and read it again. There was nobody else around, most students were in class and those who weren’t didn’t tend to choose the owlery as a place to spend their free periods. He grabbed a piece of parchment and a quill, waving his wand over it with a quick concealment charm so his handwriting wouldn’t be recognisable.</p><p>
  <em> Dear Stargazer, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I’m just like you. I feel like I’m on the outside of the world looking in sometimes, like holding this secret in my heart is putting up walls between me and my friends and family. I’m not sure if they’ve noticed it, but I feel it. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I admire your courage, that first step into a shameless existence. I wouldn’t have been able to do that, I’m not even sure I’ll be able to send this letter to you. I suppose it’s just comforting to know I’m not the only one who has a secret. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Thank you </em>
</p><p>Albus read it through and cast around for a name to sign the letter off with. His mind went to the guitar in the corner of his dorm, the other secret he was keeping.</p><p>
  <em> Thank you </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Strings </em>
</p><p>He coaxed down the most anonymous-looking school owl he could spot, tied the letter (addressed to <em> Stargazer) </em>to its leg and gave it strict instructions to return any replies to his dormitory, nowhere else. The owl hooted in understanding and took off, making several swooping circles before disappearing into the distance.</p><p>All morning Albus couldn’t concentrate in class, his mind ticking away and suddenly seeing everyone around him in a new light. Who was this mysterious Stargazer? Did he share any classes with them? Could they be on the Quidditch team with him?</p><p>“Albus! We’ve started,” Professor Jacobs caught Albus by surprise and he jumped and grinned sheepishly, feverishly lighting a fire beneath his cauldron.</p><p>“Sorry, Professor.”</p><p>“It’s not like you to be so distracted in Potions. Is something wrong?”</p><p>Albus swallowed. “Nothing, Professor.”</p><p>“Off you go then, I’m looking forward to seeing what you produce.” Professor Jacobs smiled and moved on. “This could become part of your potions licence portfolio, you know.”</p><p>Rose caught Albus’ eye with a pointed stare and Albus knew what she was getting at. “You haven’t told her?” she hissed.</p><p>“Not yet,” Albus replied uncomfortably.</p><p>“She thinks you’re going to apply for a potioneer’s licence, you need to tell her you don’t want to.”</p><p>“I’ll get to it.” He nervously played with the back of his hair. “I don’t want to let her down.”</p><p>“That’s not a reason to give up on your dream!”</p><p>“Drop it, Rosie.”</p><p>“Albus, music is your passion and-“</p><p>“I said drop it.”</p><p>Rose sighed and focused on her own potion, but Albus saw her glance over at him as if she wanted to bring the subject up again several times throughout the lesson.</p><p>Lunch was a blur of confusion, not helped by his friends from other Houses coming to join the Gryffindors. It happened frequently, and usually Albus liked the break spending time with all his friends provided, but today it was just overwhelming when all he could think about was whether Stargazer had read his letter.</p><p>“I just don’t understand why you’re wearing it <em> now,” </em>Scorpius Malfoy, from Slytherin and that year’s Head Boy, said in an exasperated tone.</p><p>“It looks good,” Cole Flint, also Slytherin, shrugged and took a mouthful of sandwich.</p><p>“That’s a matter of opinion,” Scorpius muttered and then grinned widely and smacked Cole lightly on the shoulder. “Al, what do you think?”</p><p>Albus jumped and it took him a second to process what he was being asked his opinion on. Scorpius was gesturing to Cole’s head and looking at Albus expectantly.</p><p>He laughed like he had completely understood the question and surveyed Cole’s light brown hair, which was pushed back with a thin, black hair band. “Scorpius has a point. If it’s to make you more aerodynamic on the Quidditch pitch, why are you wearing it at lunch?”</p><p>“You don’t think aerodynamic is a good look on me?” Cole pretended to be offended.</p><p>Albus shrugged and exchanged a smirk with Scorpius.</p><p>Cole laughed and ruffled Albus’ eternally messy, black hair. “At least I haven’t had the same hairstyle since first year.”</p><p>Albus pointed to his hair. “Would we call this a style? I prefer to think of it more as making the best of whatever I wake up with.”</p><p>“I dunno, ask the expert.” Cole nudged Scorpius in the ribs. “Fifteen minutes he spent brushing his hair this morning.”</p><p>“I like to take my time,” Scorpius protested, lightly brushing a lock of perfect blonde hair from his eye. “Why are you keeping count of how long I take anyway?”</p><p>As they descended into one of their usual lighthearted bickers, Albus looked at his watch and realised that, if he wanted to check for a reply before class, he was going to have to leave for Gryffindor Tower now if he wanted to make it back in time for Herbology.</p><p>“Shit, is that the time? I need to, er, put my textbook away.”</p><p>Albus didn’t particularly think anyone was paying too much attention to his reason for leaving lunch early, as his quiet sentence was drowned out by Cole’s loud voice. So as he stood up to leave, he was surprised to see Polly doing the same thing and making eye contact with him.</p><p>“I’ll come with you, Al. I have a free period now.”</p><p>“Oh, yeah, sure.” Albus shrugged as if this was no big deal.</p><p>“Are you feeling okay? You seem a bit tense today,” Polly asked him gently as soon as they were alone and leaving the Great Hall.</p><p>Albus knew Polly wouldn’t drop it until he told her why he was tense; he’d have to tell Polly something else.</p><p>“Professor Jacobs asked me about my potioneering licence again,” he said, realising in that moment that he was telling the truth and the topic <em> was </em>making him tense.</p><p>Polly sighed. “You really should tell her you don’t want to do it. I know you’re great at potions, but she shouldn’t have just assumed you were going to do it.”</p><p>“Er, she didn’t exactly just assume. I <em> did </em>say I wanted to go for the licence, last year, before the summer.”</p><p>“Well then, you should tell her you just changed your mind.”</p><p>“And then she’ll ask what I’m planning to do instead and I don’t have an answer to that question, Polly.” Albus sighed as they climbed a staircase.</p><p>“Sorry, Al. I didn’t mean to make you angry.”</p><p>He made an effort to soften his expression, but anxiety was building inside him the closer they got to the dormitory and a possible reply from Stargazer. “I’m not angry, it’s just getting to me.”</p><p>Polly looked like she wanted to change the subject. “Hey, did you read that <em> Hogossip </em>article from this morning? About the closeted gay kid?”</p><p>“I did,” Albus said casually in an attempt to not sound like the phrase <em> closeted gay kid </em>had just given him heart palpitations.</p><p>“Who do you think it is? My first thought was Jacob Finch-Fletchley but there’s no way he would have written in to Melissa’s paper like that, he’s furious with her. Could it be someone in your dorm, maybe? Liam Abercrombie has always been weirdly into Celestina Warbeck…” Polly mused to herself.</p><p>Albus snorted. “If it’s Liam Abercrombie then he’s in major denial, the number of girls he brings back.”</p><p>Albus couldn’t explain how he just knew it wasn’t Liam Abercrombie.</p><p>“But that would make so much sense!”</p><p>“Trust me, Polly. Liam’s not gay, I just get a <em> vibe.” </em>Albus grinned.</p><p>Polly eyed him suspiciously as they reached the entrance to Gryffindor tower. “Are you teasing me?”</p><p>“Yes, yes I am.” He turned to the Fat Lady. “Pumpkin.”</p><p>The common room was basically deserted as lunch was coming to an end, and Polly headed towards a cluster of chairs.</p><p>“I’m going to work here I think, start that Defence essay. It’s not as painfully quiet as the library.” Polly took a seat near the fireplace and Albus nodded, glad she seemed to have sensed he wanted to be alone. Polly was good at picking up on that.</p><p>Albus smiled and left her to it, trying not to run up the staircase to the seventh year boys’ dormitory. He closed the door behind him as casually as he could and then sprinted over to his bed, looking for any signs the owl had brought a reply from Stargazer. But the top of his bed was empty, and so was his bedside table, and the lid of his trunk.</p><p>Albus sighed, lowered himself down on top of his bed and dragged his hands down his face with a groan.</p><p>Why did he suddenly care so much? He didn’t know this person, they were a total stranger. But it was the idea that there was someone else out there like him. Someone who felt the way he did, and could validate the way he was feeling.</p><p>He should leave the dormitory now, or he was going to be late for Herbology, but the quiet calm was what his mind needed in that moment. Making the decision in that moment to skip Herbology, he opened the case at the end of his bed and retrieved his guitar. It fitted perfectly where he propped it across his knee, and the strings felt familiar and calming beneath his calloused fingers.</p><p>
  <img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/c44de9c8e9fb6960603815953f3690a2/tumblr_pdt7lnARk71skyoq2o1_1280.png" alt="" width="340" height="300" align="center" data-pagespeed-url-hash="704649895" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);" data-pagespeed-url-hash="704649895" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/>
</p><p>He began to pick out a tune, using the very tips of his fingers to gently pluck at the strings. It was one of his own compositions but it didn’t have any words yet, he just liked the melody. His eyes drifted closed for just a second as he lost himself in the music he was playing.</p><p>The door creaked open and Albus jumped, stopping his strumming abruptly and placing his palm flat against the strings. He looked up to see who was poking their head around the door and he relaxed; it was only Polly.</p><p>“You didn’t come back down, I thought you might have fallen asleep.” She shrugged and came to sit beside him on the bed. “What about Herbology?”</p><p>“I’m taking a mental health day,” Albus smiled and started strumming again.</p><p>“Are you sure everything’s okay?”</p><p>He stopped playing and looked at her for a long, hard second. Polly, his best friend since he was eleven, the first friend he’d made who wasn’t a member of his family. One of the only people who knew about his secret dream to play music.</p><p>And nothing felt more wrong than telling her he was gay. He just <em> couldn’t. </em></p><p>“Everything’s okay,” Albus reassured her. “Do you want to hear what I’ve been working on?”</p><p>It was a bit of a cheap trick to distract Polly like that when he knew she would never say no to hearing him play, it was one of those things about having been best friends for so long. Polly might have known Albus was trying to distract her, but she went along with it anyway.</p><p>She watched him play for a bit and, as Albus came to the end of a song, she was giving him a meaningful look.</p><p>“What?” Albus asked, even though he knew what she was going to say.</p><p>“You know.” Polly raised one eyebrow. “The talent show. You should enter.”</p><p>“No,” Albus muttered, going to start strumming again.</p><p>Polly gently held his wrist to stop him playing again. “Just think about it, Al. It’s the last year you’ll ever be able to.”</p><p>Albus smiled. “I’ll think about it.”</p><p>He stayed there with Polly for the rest of the time he was supposed to be in Herbology before they both had to leave for Charms. The whole time he was playing, Albus glanced frequently at the window just in case the owl returned with a reply. He wasn’t sure how he’d explain what the letter was to Polly, but he needn’t have worried because no owls arrived for him anyway.</p><p>Charms seemed to drag on forever. Professor Flitwick lectured on levitation theory and set them some difficult tasks to complete. All Albus could think about was Stargazer, and if he’d replied, and what he might say. The lesson eventually came to an end and Albus shook all his friends off to run back to the dorm as quickly as possible. He’d just say he was tired later or something.</p><p>He was nearly at the entrance to Gryffindor tower when-</p><p>“Albus!” Cursing everything, Albus gritted his teeth and turned around, wanting nothing more than to just sprint back to his dormitory and check for a reply from Stargazer.</p><p>Professor Longbottom strode towards Albus with a stern expression on his face, looking more like he was in <em> Professor </em> mode than <em> Uncle Neville. </em></p><p>“Hello, sir,” Albus addressed his godfather.</p><p>Uncle Neville pulled a face. “Don’t call me <em> sir, </em>Al.”</p><p>Albus grinned.</p><p>“Why were you not in my class today?”</p><p>He stopped grinning. “Er, I’m really sorry. I needed some space, it’s hard to explain.”</p><p>Neville’s expression softened immediately. “Come to my office, Albus. It’s been a while since we’ve caught up. I’ll make you hot chocolate.”</p><p>“Oh! It’s okay, I’ll just-“</p><p>Drinking hot chocolate with his godfather would be a pleasant prospect on any other day, but right now Albus wanted nothing more than to get to his dormitory.</p><p>“Your mum would have my head if she thought I wasn’t looking out for you.” Neville sighed. “Please?”</p><p>“Alright,” Albus resignedly followed him to his office.</p><p>When inside, Uncle Neville made two steaming mugs of delicious-smelling hot chocolate and handed one to Albus. It had a picture of a mimbulus mimbletonia and said <em> Free Hugs </em>on the side.</p><p>“How are you finding seventh year?” Neville sipped his drink and surveyed Albus over the top of the mug.</p><p>“Busy, hard, fun,” Albus threw out words as they came to him. “Going by scarily quickly.”</p><p>Neville nodded. “Before you know it, you’ll be out in the big wide world. This isn’t career advice, but are you still interested in potioneering?”</p><p>In his fifth year career advice session, Albus had talked to Neville about how he liked potions and was pretty good at them and Neville had given him some pamphlets for breweries which would sponsor him to study for his own potioneer’s licence. Albus had read them and thought he might maybe like that, but he hadn’t really told too many people about it.</p><p>Neville went on. “Because your dad was saying you wanted to go for your licence. Is that true?” Something in Neville’s expression made Albus think he knew that was no longer true.</p><p>“Can I tell you something, Uncle Neville?”</p><p>“Please do, Albus.” Neville smiled.</p><p>Albus hoped what he was about to say wouldn’t start Neville off on a big speech; he wanted to see if Stargazer had replied.</p><p>“I don’t want to get my potioneer’s licence anymore,” he admitted.</p><p>“Nothing wrong with that, you don’t have to be a potioneer.”</p><p>Albus liked that Neville didn’t ask him what he wanted to be instead, but he felt like sharing. “Don’t tell my dad this, okay. I want to tell him myself.” Neville nodded in agreement. “But I want to go into… music.” He whispered the last word as if it was charmed to cause an explosion.</p><p>“What a great idea! Are you going to join a band? You could even start a band!”</p><p>“Not a band. Just me, by myself, and my guitar. I know I’m probably not good enough to get anywhere, but I want to try.”</p><p>Neville smiled and took a sip of hot chocolate. “If you didn’t think you were good enough to get anywhere, you wouldn’t be trying. Self-belief is a powerful thing.”</p><p>“I know it’s silly, and I should pick a stable career path like potioneering-“</p><p>“Like James did when he trialled for several professional Quidditch teams?” Neville put in dryly.</p><p>“That’s different, James is really good. Everyone knew he’d get on a team,” Albus protested.</p><p>“How is it different? You’re really good, I’ve heard you. There’s no <em> everyone </em>involved. James went for what he wanted and it paid off.” Neville paused in thought. “Why don’t you enter the talent show in January?”</p><p>Albus rolled his eyes. “I’m not entering the bloody talent show.”</p><p>“Why? Think you’re too good for the little Hogwarts talent show?”</p><p>Albus felt himself blush. “No, not at all,” he muttered. “More like the opposite.”</p><p>Neville scoffed. “Albus, you’ve sat through one of those shows haven’t you? You’ve seen half the acts?”</p><p>“Yes, and everyone laughs at those people and I don’t want to be one of them,” Albus said bluntly.</p><p>Neville seemed to be regretting his choice of words. “No, no, that’s not what I meant. I just meant you’re plenty talented enough.”</p><p>“Thanks, Uncle Neville, but I’m okay.”</p><p>The sun was starting to set by the time he finally left Neville’s office, walking as fast as he could without running all the way to Gryffindor Tower. He waved to his friends in the common room and ignored their confused looks as he sprinted up the staircase and straight into the thankfully empty dormitory.</p><p>There, on his pillow, was an envelope, addressed to <em> Strings </em>.</p><p>Albus let out a huge exhale and he clutched the letter to his chest, looking up at the ceiling and feeling a swoop in his stomach. Whoever Stargazer was, they’d written back to him. They were <em> real. </em></p><p>He pulled the hangings around his bed and reverently opened the envelope, withdrawing the note inside and breathing heavily.</p><p>
  <em> Strings, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> You have a secret too? Is it, by any chance, the same as my secret? If so, how did you know? And have you told anyone? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Yours </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Stargazer </em>
</p><p>Albus feverishly grabbed parchment and a quill and settled in to write a reply.</p><p>
  <em> Stargazer, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The very same secret. I suppose I’ve always known. When I was little, I had this huge crush on Gonçalo Flores from the Brazilian National Quidditch team. At the time, I thought he was my favourite player because he was a good Chaser. But that didn’t explain the recurring dreams I used to have about him. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> My parents met here at Hogwarts, but in my first few years here, I couldn’t imagine getting married to any of the girls in my class, or really to any girls at all. I thought perhaps I was just too young, and those feelings would come later. My older brother got his first girlfriend in second year, but I told myself it didn’t matter that I hadn’t had a crush on any girls. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> It was my first Yule Ball in fourth year, and I got so stressed about asking anyone that I ended up just asking one of my best friends and going with her. I told myself I’d ‘be more organised’ for the next one in sixth year, which I think meant ‘be a bit more honest with myself’ and admit that there were several boys I would have liked to have taken. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> But I didn’t. Sixth year came and I panic-asked a girl in one of my classes. I meant as friends but she got the wrong idea and thought I wanted to be her boyfriend. I’m ashamed to say I wasn’t brave enough to tell her otherwise, and we were in a relationship for two months. She told me she was falling in love with me and I ended things. Not my proudest moment. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> What’s your story, Stargazer? Any gay-panic-induced girlfriends for you? (If you’re a boy too, I just realised I don’t actually know that) </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Strings </em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em> Strings, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Gonçalo Flores, eh? Interesting, I wondered if you were a Quidditch person too. A fine first crush. I’m sure he’d be thrilled if he knew. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> To answer your question, I am a boy too. But no girlfriends here, panic-induced or otherwise. That would involve me having to pluck up the courage to ask someone out, and if you knew me, you’d realise why that’s so unlikely. </em>
</p><p><em> For me, the knut dropped when I was in my fifth year. My parents got me tickets to see </em> Firewhiskeys <em> live. Their lead singer is pretty enough to give anyone a sexual awakening. </em></p><p>
  <em> You had a Yule Ball in fourth and sixth year, so that makes you a seventh year like me. I went stag both times, you might have seen me lamenting my gay existence at the dessert table on both occasions. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Halloween is coming up. I hope there’s another party after the feast like last year. Fancy dress parties are the best! Do you like parties? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Stargazer </em>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em> Dear Stargazer, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Quidditch practically runs in my veins, but my feelings for Gonçalo were nothing to do with his quaffle technique. </em>
</p><p>Firewhiskeys <em> are one of my favourite bands! Sloan Collins is pretty much exclusively why, so I get you. </em></p><p>
  <em> I wonder if I do know you, seeing as we’re both in seventh year. I don’t recall seeing any particularly homosexual lament at the dessert table. Maybe you bumped into me hiding my heteronormative awkwardness behind a pile of profiteroles and later not having a clue how to dance with a girl. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I never miss a party, Stargazer. Especially a fancy dress one. Dressing up and pretending to be something I’m not? I’m an expert at that. Maybe I’ll go as Sloan this year. What about you? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Strings </em>
</p><p>It was the weekend before Albus knew it, and he couldn’t stop thinking about Stargazer. He found he was less intrigued about who was writing the letters and more involved in enjoying talking to whoever he was.</p><p>The very rare times Albus had ever tried to genuinely flirt in his life had made him feel so awkward and uncomfortable, but writing to Stargazer alleviated all of those feelings. He had time to plan what he was going to say, and Stargazer couldn’t see how much he blushed every time he read his words. Stargazer’s letters were becoming the highlight of his day, and he found himself noticing things all around him which somehow linked back to something Stargazer had said.</p><p>After Stargazer revealed his first crush had been on the lead singer of <em> Firewhiskeys, </em> Albus felt as if he were seeing the band everywhere. A boy at the breakfast table had a sticker on his school bag, someone in the common room was playing <em> I Bet You Look Good On A Broomstick, </em>someone in the corridor was wearing a t-shirt with Sloan Collins’ face on it. Any one of them could be Stargazer!</p><p>Between homework and hanging out with his friends, Stargazer sent him three letters over the weekend.</p><p>
  <em> Strings, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> A braver man than I would make a hilarious and inappropriate innuendo about Gonçalo and his ‘quaffle technique’ but alas, I can’t even pull that off in writing. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Sloan Collins has a lot to answer for. I can’t be the only boy who realised a lot of things about himself after he wore that body paint. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Maybe we do know each other, maybe we don’t. I quite like not knowing, the mystery of this all is both exciting and comforting. I like talking to you, Strings. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I’m not dressing up this year, just don’t feel like it. Anyway, everyone knows the best thing about Halloween is the pumpkin spiced pepper imps. They’re my favourite. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Stargazer </em>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em> Dear Stargazer, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I’m very glad you didn’t make that innuendo, I’m not sure I could handle it at this fragile new stage of accepting my sexuality. Save it for another day! </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I wanted to ask, and you don’t have to tell me, but what made you confess anonymously to the school newspaper before you told your friends or family? I’m terrified to tell anyone, an anonymous confession wouldn’t have even crossed my mind. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> That’s fair, the dressing up thing isn’t for everyone. I’m just trying to source the right shade of green body paint at the moment of course ;) agreed! Those little imps holding pumpkins are the best thing about this time of year. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Strings </em>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em> Dear Strings, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Honestly, I don’t have a clear answer to that question. I suppose I just wanted to tell someone, but I’m not ready for that someone to be anyone I know in real life. I’ve accepted myself as I am, but there’s always that fear that the people I love won’t be as accepting. My parents are good people, but they’ve always made those little asides about ‘when I get my first girlfriend’ and I know they don’t mean any harm, but they’re setting an expectation by doing that. I just don’t know how they’ll react. I’m not ready to find out; I just want to be me a little longer. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I didn’t for a second think that Hogossip post would lead to ‘meeting’ you, not that we’ve ever met in person. It’s great talking to you, Strings. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Please tell me you’re joking about the Sloan Collins body paint! I’m not sure my poor heart can handle that, plus I’d know who you were! Unless that’s what you want? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Stargazer </em>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em> Starry G, (only because I keep starting my letters the same way) </em>
</p><p>
  <em> That’s understandable, and I’m in a very similar situation! I can’t even explain why I don’t want to come out to my family yet, I know deep down they won’t have a problem and will accept and love me for who I am. Maybe it’s that, on some level, I don’t feel like I should have to come out? Why is straight just considered the default unless told otherwise? Nobody’s ever asked me if I’m straight so why should they just assume? I need to process it all a bit more before I tell anyone. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I really like talking to you too, Stargazer. Seriously, sometimes it’s the highlight of my day. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Joking about the body paint, nobody wants to see that! </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Strings </em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Albus felt like he had a secret, glowing talisman with him at the breakfast table on Monday. Every time he thought about Stargazer, he felt a thrill of excitement course through him and he worked hard to keep a huge grin off his face all the time so as not to arouse suspicion. Albus hid behind his coffee cup for just a second and let himself smile into its depths as he thought about some of the things Stargazer had said in his letters.</p><p>“Are you still on for flying tonight, Al?” Rose jolted him from his thoughts.</p><p>“Yeah, sure, still on.” He grinned as normally as he could, as if Rose had just become a legilimens and could see inside his mind at the thoughts about Stargazer.</p><p>“Great, I was thinking of inviting-“</p><p>“We’re having a Halloween party.” Cole Flint sat down at the same time as making this announcement, Scorpius Malfoy bouncing at his heels excitedly waving a clipboard.</p><p>“Hosted by Slytherins.” Scorpius sat down beside Cole.</p><p>“Head Boy approved and everything.” Cole patted Scorpius on the top of his head.</p><p>Rose cleared her throat. “Oi, why wasn’t the Head Girl consulted before this <em> approval? </em>”</p><p>“Sorry, Rose.” Scorpius smiled. “What do you think about the Slytherins hosting a Halloween party?”</p><p>“Where?” Rose locked eyes with him.</p><p>“Room of Requirement.” Scorpius didn’t hesitate.</p><p>“When?”</p><p>“After the feast.”</p><p>“Who’s invited?”</p><p>“Everyone in fifth year and up.”</p><p>Rose’s expression softened. “Will there be snacks?”</p><p>Scorpius smiled and waved his clipboard of what were apparently party plans. “Just a few, everyone will be stuffed from the feast.”</p><p>“Just sweets and crisps mainly,” Cole put in. “Any suggestions?”</p><p>“Oh you have to get some of those pumpkin spiced pepper imps!” Polly cried enthusiastically.</p><p>“Those are my <em> favourite!” </em>Scorpius replied, equally as happily and jotting them down on his clipboard.</p><p>Albus felt a little flicker in his stomach at the mention of the pumpkin spiced pepper imps and he appraised Scorpius as he continued to plan emphatically with Rose and the others.</p><p>His white blonde hair was tousled today and fell effortlessly into his grey eyes, until he brushed it back with a slender-fingered hand. He had a nice smile, Albus had always thought that, and an infectious laugh. And there was something a bit sexy about the way he was making decisions and scribbling things down on his clipboard.</p><p>The truth was <em> everyone </em>liked those pumpkin flavoured pepper imps, and Scorpius was probably exaggerating when he said they were his favourite, but Albus couldn’t help it. Later that night, when he opened Stargazer’s next letter, he imagined it was Scorpius Malfoy writing to him.</p><p>
  <em> Starry G??? New, Strings, new. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Those are some excellent points, you’re very wise and astute. I’ll tell my parents eventually, when I’m feeling a bit braver. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Talking to you is a highlight in my day too. Is it strange that I don’t even know what you look like but I can’t stop thinking about kissing you? I hope that isn’t too forward. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Starry G ;) </em>
</p><hr/><p>O<em>kay, Stargazer, happy?</em></p><p>
  <em> I don’t think I’ve ever been described as ‘wise and astute’ before but I’ll take it. Star, you’re one of the bravest people I know, and I don’t even know who you are. I could never have told the whole school I was gay. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> It would only be too forward if I wasn’t feeling exactly the same way. I can’t stop thinking about kissing you either. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Strings </em>
</p><p>Albus doodled a tiny picture of a guitar next to his name, changed his mind and scribbled out, then smiled stupidly to himself at Stargazer’s words. It was true that he’d thought about kissing him before, but now he had a face to picture, the vision in his head was even clearer.</p><p>He closed his eyes for a second and imagined pressing his lips to Scorpius’, each of them tilting their heads in opposite directions, their hands wandering up into each other’s hair. Scorpius’ hair must be silky and soft, it always looked so perfect. His long, slender fingers would caress his cheek and bring them closer together.</p><p>Yes, kissing this version of Stargazer would be wonderful.</p><p>Albus coaxed down an owl and tied the letter to its leg. He held it carefully in both hands and started to cross the owlery floor to the window to release the owl.</p><p>“Alright, Potter.”</p><p>Albus dropped the owl in fright and it squawked loudly in his face and flew far away from him up to the corner of the rafters. He tried to keep it in sight, wondering how to coax it back down.</p><p>“Ouch, touchy little things, aren’t they.”</p><p>It was Karl Jenkins, a snowy white owl perched on his arm and a smug smirk on his face.</p><p>“Hi, Karl,” Albus replied sulkily; he really was not in the mood for talking to Karl right now.</p><p>“Ordering myself a new broom, the Storm Surge.” He paused as if waiting for Albus to gasp in amazement. When Albus said nothing, he cleared his throat awkwardly then carried on. “Yeah, it’s meant to be unstoppable. Maybe I’ll even try out for Keeper this year, keep you on your toes.”</p><p>He patted Albus on the shoulder and all he could do was stare at Karl in disgust, hoping he would leave.</p><p>“Only joking, I can’t deprive the world of my beating ability.” Karl brushed his hair from his face arrogantly.</p><p>Albus tried to spot the owl with his letter but it appeared to have been so scared it had completely hidden itself away. He didn’t want to draw attention to the letter he was sending in front of Karl, so he made a decision on the spot to come back after flying and find the owl to send the letter. With a jolt, Albus realised that meant he’d have to wait longer for Stargazer to reply and the thought made him feel disappointed.</p><p>“Bye, Karl,” Albus said, leaving the owlery as quickly as possible and crossing his fingers the scared owl stayed hidden with his letter until he came back.</p><p>It didn’t take long to reach the Quidditch pitch and Rose was already there with Albus’ broom in her hand, chatting and laughing with Thea.</p><p>“Al! I never got a chance to tell you, but I invited Thea. That’s okay, isn’t it?”</p><p>Albus didn’t have a problem at all with Thea joining them, he was just surprised Rose had included somebody else in their tradition.</p><p>“Of course that’s okay! Hi, Thea.” They smiled at each other. “Won’t Polly feel left out, though?”</p><p>Rose frowned. “She hates flying.”</p><p>Thea chuckled. “I asked her to come too, she said <em> I hate flying </em>.”</p><p>“She does,” Albus laughed in response.</p><p>“Well, shall we go?” Rose handed Albus his broom and mounted her own.</p><p>It was both exhilarating and relaxing zooming around the grounds with Rose and Thea. They started off sticking to the border of the Quidditch pitch but they soon got bored of that and branched out, skimming the tops of the trees at the edge of the forest.</p><p>Albus thought about Scorpius and Stargazer’s words. He imagined Scorpius was watching him as he flew and the thought gave him a pleasant squirm in his stomach. He would be lying if he said he hadn’t ever noticed how attractive Scorpius Malfoy was, but Albus thought a lot of boys were attractive; this was something different.</p><p>Laughing cheerfully together, the three of them landed in a heap and threw their brooms down, laying flat on their backs and staring up at the stars.</p><p>“We’re definitely out past curfew,” Thea commented, making no effort to move.</p><p>“That’s because we’re on urgent Head Girl business that I couldn’t possibly have done by myself,” Rose explained.</p><p>“Isn’t that why you have a Head Boy?”</p><p>“Scorpius would not approve of this rule-breaking.” Rose smirked.</p><p>“Ah, but it’s not rule-breaking, it’s <em> urgent Head Girl business,” </em> Albus teased.</p><p>“Fine, next time I’ll go flying with Scorpius and I won’t invite you two.”</p><p>All this talk of Scorpius was making Albus blush as he stared up at the stars.</p><p>
  <em> I feel so small and insignificant in this big wide world. My worries don’t matter. </em>
</p><p>By the time he got back, the owlery was completely empty, but it was also pitch-black.</p><p>“<em> Lumos!” </em>Albus ordered his wand to cast a beam of light and several owls squawked in protest and flew away. “Come here, owl with my letter! Er, please?”</p><p>Eventually he spotted the speckled owl with the oversized wings from earlier and it reluctantly answered his call. But the closer it got, the more Albus’ heart rate increased. The letter was gone, the owl's leg was empty.</p><p>“Where’s my letter?” He unceremoniously turned the owl over, searching for his letter, and the owl hooted in disgust at being turned upside down and nipped Albus hard on the finger. “No, no, no, no!”</p><p>He scanned the floor, crawling amongst mouse skulls and owl droppings, to see if the letter had fallen from the owl’s leg, but none of the fastenings were in place so it was unlikely.</p><p>“Shit!” Albus stamped his foot like a child having a tantrum as the worst possibility crossed his mind.</p><p>There was no way <em> Karl </em>could have taken his letter, was there?</p><p>“<em> Accio </em>my letter!”</p><p>Nothing happened, which meant it wasn’t in the owlery. And the owl, although more than a bit disgruntled with Albus after his treatment of the bird, was hovering around his shoulder. He knew what that meant; he’d picked this owl to deliver his letter which meant it wouldn’t leave until it delivered a letter for him.</p><p>His letter hadn’t been delivered and it wasn’t in the owlery. Albus felt physically sick.</p><hr/><p>He slept badly, tossing and turning through half conscious dreams that he’d found the letter. Somewhere along the way he fell asleep and woke up to an envelope being dropped on his face. He groaned and rubbed his eyes, the realisation that this was another letter from Stargazer hitting him, because he hadn’t replied yet. Had something happened?</p><p>
  <em> Strings, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I’m sorry. I misjudged that. Please just forget I said anything, I’m really enjoying talking to you. I want to keep being friends. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Hope you can forgive me, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Stargazer </em>
</p><p>Albus sighed deeply as he read the letter, cursing himself for not thinking this through. Stargazer admitted to thinking about kissing him and he just hadn’t sent a reply because he’d been stressing about losing it. What message was that sending?</p><p>He quickly grabbed parchment and scribbled out a reply while the owl hopped around and waited.</p><p>
  <em> Stargazer, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>You didn’t misjudge! I’m sorry, I fell asleep before I could write back to you. I don’t know why I was so exhausted.</em>
</p><p><em> I hope it isn’t too forward of </em> me <em> to say I’ve thought about kissing you too. Quite a few times. I know I don’t know what you look like, but I’ve still thought about it. </em></p><p>
  <em> Have a good day of classes, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Strings</em>
</p><p>Albus strategically sat at breakfast so the Slytherin table was in his line of sight. He looked for any kind of visual signs that Scorpius Malfoy might be the boy he was writing to, but he wasn’t entirely sure what he was looking for. Really, the only reason he even thought it might be Scorpius was his comment about pepper imps and that could really apply to anyone.</p><p>He walked alone to Alchemy, which none of his friends took, and wondered if Stargazer had read his letter yet. The thought made him grin to himself but was rudely interrupted by Karl Jenkins emerging almost from nowhere and falling in step with him.</p><p>“Hey, Albus.” Karl put on a simpering expression. “So, it was nice to bump into you in the owlery yesterday.”</p><p>Albus felt his blood run cold.</p><p>“Yeah, your owl was keen to deliver your letter once it got over its fright. It flew right at me, hopping around, wanting me to launch it.”</p><p>Albus stopped walking and turned to Karl incredulously. “Did you?”</p><p>“Oh no, everyone knows that’s against owlery etiquette.” He was smiling in a thin-lipped mockery of politeness. “Unfortunately, you didn’t tie your letter on all that securely. You see, it fell off.”</p><p>Albus narrowed his eyes at Karl. “You have my letter? </p><p>Karl reached into his pocket and pulled something out. Something made of parchment and with the name <em> Stargazer </em> on the front. Albus reached out to snatch it.</p><p>
  <img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/a9c9003e074f470b440fbe1eeeb19d7c/tumblr_pduvi9449b1skyoq2o1_1280.png" alt="" width="330" height="300" data-pagespeed-url-hash="3567333936" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);" data-pagespeed-url-hash="3567333936" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/>
</p><p>“Of course I didn’t <em> read it </em> ,” Karl said meaningfully, hiding the letter away again. “That would be morally wrong. But curiosity <em> did </em>get the better of me, what with who it was addressed to and everything.”</p><p>“Give it back,” Albus spat bitterly.</p><p>“You know, it might interest you to know my cousin is gay.”</p><p>Albus grabbed Karl by the elbow and marched him away to a nearby tapestry, which he pulled back to reveal a small alcove. He shoved Karl into it.</p><p>“What the hell is wrong with you? You intercepted my owl, you weirdo! Why are you going around reading people’s post? You sick freak!”</p><p>Karl just smiled silently at Albus. Albus took a deep breath and with it summoned every ounce of self control he had so as to not punch Karl right in his smarmy face.</p><p>“I happened to notice you made fast, firm friends with Thea Jordan.”</p><p>“And?” Albus said in a low voice.</p><p>“I wouldn’t mind some help getting to know her better.” Karl winked and licked his lips in a most unappealing gesture.</p><p>“Are you <em> blackmailing </em>me?” Albus stared at him. “What is this, you want my help to get with Thea or you’re going to tell everyone I’m-“</p><p>Karl pulled a face. “I wouldn’t call it <em> blackmail. </em>I just think we can help each other out.”</p><p>Albus scowled.</p><p>Karl looked triumphant. “So will you help me? Because I think <em> Hogossip </em> would be <em> very </em>interested in a copy of this letter.”</p><p>“You’re a fucking loser.”</p><p>“A loser who knows your secret, even though you’re meant to be <em> wise and astute </em>.” He grinned evilly and Albus balled his fist up at his side. Karl folded his arms and tapped his foot impatiently. “Will you help me?  </p><p>“How the fuck am I supposed to help you? You are beyond help.” Albus went to stalk away and Karl faltered for the first time.</p><p>“Wait, Potter, you have to put in a good word for me with her. You know, talk me up a bit, tell her how every girl in Hogwarts would love to be with me.”</p><p>“Lie, you mean?” Albus said coolly, turning back.</p><p>“Feel free to invent a few cool stories that have happened to me in the past. She’s new to the school, she’ll never know.” He clicked his fingers. “Oh, tell her it was me who broke the chasing record in the Gryffindor Ravenclaw final two years ago!”</p><p>Albus stared at Karl. “That was my brother.”</p><p>Karl shrugged. “She wasn’t here, she can think it was me.” His expression darkened. “And make sure she’s not talking to any other guys, okay?”</p><p>Albus raised his eyebrows. “I can’t control what Thea does.”</p><p>“Yes you can, it’s easy to control what other people do.”</p><p>“You have a serious problem, Karl. Goodbye.” Albus pushed past him and down the corridor as quickly as he could. He needed to be on his own and to think, not sit in a stupid Alchemy class. But Neville was keeping tabs on him and there were only four of them in the class, he couldn’t get away with skiving.</p><p>He sat fuming, pretending to be poring over his textbook and making notes on the magical properties of garnet, but really he was ignoring the steadily rising panic in his chest and the strong urge to find Karl Jenkins and hex him hard. His thoughts swung back and forth like a pendulum.</p><p>What if Karl told everyone his secret?</p><p>Surely nobody would believe him.</p><p>He had Albus’ letter though, in which he used the words ‘I’m gay’ and told Stargazer he wanted to kiss him.</p><p>But he’d disguised his handwriting, it was only Karl’s word that confirmed Albus had written it.</p><p>But then he’d be denying it. He didn’t want to actively deny who he was. Anyway, all it would take would be for any of his friends to think about the idea of him being gay and the game was up. They’d think about how he’d never had a serious girlfriend, how he never talked about having crushes on girls, maybe Polly would say she’d ‘always gotten a vibe’ from him </p><p>Did it matter if his friends knew though?</p><p>No, he wasn’t ready to come out. Not yet.</p><p>Albus couldn’t have told anyone what it was he’d just supposedly learnt in double Alchemy, just that he wanted to spend his next free period alone in his dorm with his guitar. The urge to hex Karl remained and was only cast aside when he saw a reply from Stargazer waiting atop his pillow.</p><p>
  <em> Strings, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> That’s a relief, I was so sure I’d messed everything up there. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> When you think about us kissing, what do I look like? In my mind, you have dark hair and the most amazing eyes. You don’t have to confirm or deny that though, I’m just curious. I want us to still be anonymous. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> On that note, I feel like I should tell you something. When I said I wasn’t dressing up for Halloween, that wasn’t strictly true. I just don’t want you to know who I am, not yet. These letters feel like such a safe place, I’m just not ready for the world to know. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Stargazer </em>
</p><p>Albus read the letter through again, sighed, and went to find Karl in the common room. He was thankfully alone.</p><p>“This helping thing,” Albus said reluctantly.</p><p>“Told you it’s easy to control people.” Karl smiled in a sadistic sort of way.</p><p>“Don’t make me change my mind, Jenkins.”</p><p>“Okay then, I sit next to Melissa Lockhart in Transfiguration which I just <em> happen </em>to have next. Maybe I’ll… leave her a note.” He smiled evilly.</p><p>“Fine. I’ll try.” Albus wanted to punch Karl more than ever in that moment.</p><p>“What sort of guys does Thea like? Is she into muscle? Maybe I should get back into lifting.” He started flexing his muscles and glanced up at Albus. "You're into guys, is this good?"</p><p>Albus gave him a look of pure disgust then wracked his brains for anything Thea had ever said about the kind of boys she liked, but he couldn’t recall her talking about the subject much.</p><p>“Maybe just… don’t try so hard. Thea’s quite lowkey, she’s chill. No big gestures.”</p><p>“Lowkey… chill…” Karl muttered as if these were words he’d never heard before. “Really, no big gesture?”</p><p>Albus shook his head. “No big gesture. Just hang out with her, get to know her a bit.”</p><p>“I thought that’s maybe what you were doing, Potter. Waiting to pounce, you know? Of course now I realise I was wrong.” He laughed cruelly.</p><p>“No.” Albus spoke in a flat tone.</p><p>“How do I hang out with her? Shall I ask her to study with me?”</p><p>Albus hesitated, and internally cringed, but at the same time panicked at the idea of Hogossip publishing his letter to Stargazer. Merlin, it was bad enough that <em> Karl </em>had read it. </p><p>“Do you want to come to the Slytherins’ Halloween party with my friends and me?”</p><hr/><p>
  <em>Stargazer,</em>
</p><p>
  <em> Nothing’s messed up, everything’s perfect. Everything. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I like us being anonymous too, but I suppose I can tell you you’re right about me having dark hair. Not that that narrows it down all that much. For some reason, I’m picturing you as a blonde. And tall. You write like you’re tall.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> See you at the Halloween party tonight. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Strings</em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Perfect.” Polly adjusted Albus’ hair and stood back to admire the effect. “You look just like him.”</p><p>Albus looked into the mirror and snorted with laughter. His dark, messy hair was mostly tucked into a red bobble hat, he was wearing a green and white striped long-sleeve top and red trousers and round his neck hung a small cuckoo clock. He was the spitting image of Martin Miggs from the <em> Mad Muggle </em>comics. </p><p>“Crackers, is that the time, Penelope?” Albus said in a stupid voice, just like Martin did in the comic.</p><p>Polly giggled. “Late again, Martin.”</p><p>She was dressed as Penelope Pencil-Sharpener, Martin’s sidekick come love interest throughout the comic series. There had been a long running debate over whether Martin and Penelope were romantically involved in the story or not, with the writers often putting small things in the comics to tease the readers and make them think Martin and Penelope were going to kiss, but it always ended with Martin’s actions preventing that from happening. </p><p>“For real though, they’re going to leave without us.” Albus held the door open for Polly and they left the dormitories for the common room to meet their friends. </p><p>“You didn’t!” Rose greeted with a maniacal laugh. She appeared to be wearing her Gryffindor Quidditch robes in place of a Halloween costume.</p><p>“You literally didn’t.” Albus folded his arms. “Where’s your costume?”</p><p>“I’m wearing it, clearly.” Rose turned around and pointed at her back, where she’d stuck a red handkerchief over part of her name so instead of <em> Granger-Weasley, </em> it just read <em> Weasley. </em></p><p>“You dressed up as… er,” Polly looked at Albus in confusion and he shrugged.</p><p>“I’m your mum, Al!” She looked triumphant and seemed disappointed by the blank look Albus was giving her. “Or my dad, or my Uncle George, maybe my Uncle Charlie.”</p><p>“Wow, Rose, it’s only one night, no need to go to so much trouble,” Albus said in a deadpan voice.</p><p>“Happy Halloween everyone!” Thea was coming down the stairs. She was wearing a shiny blue dragon costume and it was undeniable that she looked very good in it.</p><p>“Nice dragon!” Albus spoke first after a pause in which neither Rose nor Polly said anything.</p><p>“Thanks, Al. You two look perfect.” She smiled at Polly who twirled her polka dotted skirt about. “And Rose, you’re…”</p><p>Rose turned around and pointed at her back.</p><p>“You’re Ginny Weasley!” Thea cried in triumph and Rose looked smug that she’d worked it out. “You’re Al’s mum!”</p><p>Albus laughed. “You know, Thea, I went as a dragon for three Halloweens in a row when I was little.”</p><p>“Cute!”</p><p>“I remember that!” Rose put in. “You threw a tantrum when we were five because our cousins kept stepping on your tail.”</p><p>“Was it like the time in first year when James borrowed his jumper and stretched it out of shape?” Polly giggled at the memory. “I’ve never seen you more determined to hex someone. </p><p>“It was my favourite jumper,” Albus protested but Polly’s words reminded him of someone he very much <em> would </em>like to hex right now and, as his friends went to leave, Albus didn’t follow. </p><p>“Oh, hold on, I said we’d wait for Karl.”</p><p>Everyone stared at Albus like he’d just announced he was taking up tap dancing.</p><p>“You invited <em> Karl?” </em>Rose looked disgusted at the idea.</p><p>“To come with <em> us?” </em> Polly added.</p><p>“He didn’t have anyone to go with,” Albus muttered vaguely.</p><p>“I’m sure it’ll be fine,” Thea said confidently. “Here he is now.” </p><p>Clenching his teeth in preparation for a shock, Albus turned to the staircase to see Karl emerging with an annoyingly smug expression on his face. He was wearing the most peculiar outfit imaginable; it included enlarged gold galleons spellotaped to his shirt, a hat in the shape of a sandwich and some Arithmancy equations scribbled up and down his arms.</p><p>“What are you supposed to be?” Albus asked after an awkward silence.</p><p>Karl grinned and gestured down at himself like it was obvious. “I’m the five principal exceptions to Gamp’s law of Elemental Transfiguration. Evening, Thea,” he added with a wink in her direction.</p><p>“Very clever,” Thea said in a forced voice.</p><p>“Allow me to accompany you.” He held his arm out to her and Rose stared at him like he was mad as she started to lead the way to the portrait hole. </p><p>“That’s okay thanks, Karl.” Thea looked at him strangely and followed Rose. Polly caught up with them leaving Karl trailing behind with Albus. </p><p>“I thought you were going to put in a good word for me,” Karl hissed.</p><p>“You’re wearing a <em> sandwich </em>on your head. Nothing I could have said would have helped.” Albus stalked away from him to catch up with the girls.</p><p>When they reached the Room of Requirement where the party was being held, Cole Flint was outside the door, checking people off on a guest list and opening the room up for them to go inside.</p><p>“Evening, friends,” he called in greeting as they approached. “Let’s see, we have a dragon, and don’t tell me, oh! You two are Martin Miggs and Penelope. Rose, you came as Rose-“</p><p>“No!” Rose span around to show him her back. “I’m Ginny Weasley, pre-Harpies.”</p><p>“And I’ve got no idea what you’re meant to be, Karl. The person who brings around sandwiches to the goblins at Gringotts?”</p><p>Polly snorted with laughter at his words.</p><p>“I’m the five principal exceptions to-“</p><p>“See you in there soon!” Cole interrupted and stepped back to let them enter. “Don’t have too much fun without me. </p><p>It was loud inside, music blaring from seemingly every corner, and packed with people in fancy dress costumes of varying degrees of effort.</p><p>“I’ll get us all drinks,” Rose said quickly.</p><p>“I’ll help you carry them,” Thea said, eyeing Karl warily but he didn’t seem to have noticed.</p><p>“Drinks, great!” Karl stuck close by to Thea who tugged her dragon costume further over her shoulders.</p><p>As the three rushed off, Polly looked around the room and crossed her arms uncomfortably.</p><p>“Alright?” Albus asked her in concern. </p><p>“Yeah, I always feel so awkward at places like this. I never know what to do with myself.”</p><p>Albus gently pulled her arms free and jiggled them around a bit. “Do this, it looks very cool.”</p><p>Polly laughed and pulled her arms out of Albus’ grip. “Your cuckoo is about to pop out.”</p><p>Sure enough, as nine o’clock struck, the cuckoo clock around Albus’ neck sprung into action and the small bird poked its head out.</p><p>“How long before that gets annoying enough that you ditch it somewhere?” Polly stroked the bird.</p><p>As Albus considered her question, he was distracted from answering by the figure coming up behind Polly and towards them both with a smile on his face.</p><p>“Love the costumes!” Scorpius Malfoy looked very different in his costume, and Albus felt his stomach twist up in knots when he thought about the image he’d pictured of Scorpius being Stargazer and writing him the letters.</p><p>Albus groaned and laughed as he properly took in Scorpius’ unusually dark hair, fake, round glasses and red inked lightning bolt scar on his forehead. “No way!”</p><p>“You recognise me then?” Scorpius pushed his glasses up his nose. “Go to your room, Albus.” He spoke in an exaggerated, deep voice.</p><p>Albus laughed. “You should find Rose, she’s supposedly dressed as my mum.” He pretended to search around the party. “Maybe there’ll be someone here dressed as my brother too, or my little sister.”</p><p>Scorpius grinned as he turned back from the table behind him with his hands full. “Anyone want a shot?”</p><p>After a disastrous experience at James’ nineteenth birthday, Albus had vowed never to do a shot of anything again. But that was ages ago, he was older and wiser now, in fact he was <em> wise and astute </em>and Scorpius’ eyes were bright and intriguing. Stargazer or not, he was fit.</p><p>“Yeah, alright,” Albus reached for one as Polly declined. She looked at Albus incredulously, clearly surprised at his decision to accept.</p><p>“Cheers.” Scorpius clinked the tiny glass he was holding with the one in Albus’ hand and threw his head back to take it. Albus did the same, remembering how James had taught him. The alcohol burned his throat and made him shudder as it went down, but Scorpius had his empty glass raised in triumph so Albus did the same.</p><p>“Whatever that was, it was pretty good,” Albus said in a way which he hoped made him sound cool and aloof, like he was used to taking shots.</p><p>“Want another one?” Scorpius offered as the girls returned with Karl in tow.</p><p>“Is that Ogden’s?” Karl asked loudly.</p><p>“Not a clue, mate.” Scorpius chuckled to himself and handed Albus another shot. “Wait, do it with me again,” he added quietly before handing out more until everyone had one.</p><p>“We should sing that song. Thea, do you know it? It goes-“</p><p>“Shut up, Karl,” Rose interrupted, knocking her shot back and encouraging everyone else to do the same.  </p><p>“Happy Halloween,” Scorpius whispered, quietly enough that only Albus could hear him. He realised Scorpius was already looking at him, sort of intensely, and he clinked his glass against Albus’ again.</p><p>“Happy Halloween,” Albus murmured back, feeling a bit lost for words.</p><p>He wasn’t sure if it was the second shot, but he wanted to stay here and talk to Scorpius more. He wasn’t even thinking about Stargazer anymore, this wasn’t about that. He’d just never really noticed how pretty Scorpius’ eyes were before, or how he was just on the right side of slender, or how his cheekbones could cut glass.</p><p>“Ever played Quiddrink before?” Scorpius said, not breaking their eye contact. “I need a partner.”</p><p>Albus had played Quiddrink, again an experience he’d gained from James’ nineteenth birthday party. He wasn’t very good at it, in fact wouldn’t have chosen to play at all tonight, but he didn’t think he could say no to Scorpius. </p><p>“I’ll be your partner,” Albus replied.</p><p>“Okay, great, who else wants to play?” Scorpius spoke to the rest of the group but not everyone was paying attention.</p><p>“How about,” Albus pretended to consider everyone, “Thea and Karl?”</p><p>“What’s that?” Thea smiled.</p><p>“Quiddrink! Are you in?” Scorpius beckoned her to follow him.</p><p>“Let’s do this!” Karl yelled obnoxiously and Scorpius laughed as he ran ahead.</p><p>“Are you any good at this game?” Scorpius fell in step with Albus. “Because I have to admit I’m terrible.”</p><p>He shrugged and laughed. “Is it too late to pick a different partner?”</p><p>“Nope, you’re stuck with me now!” Scorpius reached over and stole the bobble hat from Albus’ head, placing it on top of his own hair, charmed to be dark like Albus’.</p><p>“It’s weird that you’re dressed as my dad,” Albus commented as they reached the Quiddrink table.</p><p>Scorpius leaned forward and Albus felt his breath catch. “It’s weird that you’re wearing a cuckoo clock.”</p><p>“Touché.” He laughed and turned to the table to see Thea stood with her arms folded, angled away from Karl and her expression set.</p><p>“Ilvy rules: no spinning, the middle ring is worth double and if you hit the keeper you have to down your drink.”</p><p>“You’re on.” Scorpius summoned a stack of small, red balls and handed one to Albus.</p><p>Quiddrink was pretty ridiculous as games go. A set of miniature Quidditch hoops stood at each end of a table decorated to look like a pitch. Cups of alcohol were set out to look like a Quidditch team in starting formation, traditionally made to increasing strength, with the seeker cup being a double shot. The players throw a ball into the opposite team’s hoops and if they make it, the other team have to drink one of the cups. There were small bludgers charmed to knock the ball off course as well as a ‘keeper’ which circled the hoops.</p><p>As it turned out, Thea was far better than any of the rest of them at the game. Karl had missed every shot he’d attempted, and Albus and Scorpius had each got one in, but were also down to only a beater cup and the seeker cup left thanks to Thea’s impressive aim.</p><p>“I’ve got a good feeling about this one,” Scorpius grinned over his shoulder at Albus and flicked his hair out of his eyes; it was starting to turn back to blonde in places where the charm was wearing off.</p><p>“Me too!” Albus replied enthusiastically. He suddenly realised it really <em> really </em>mattered to him whether Scorpius made this shot. His adorably optimistic expression was so sweet it just made Albus want Scorpius to be happy. </p><p>He also realised in that moment that he was really very drunk.</p><p>Scorpius flicked his wrist and the ball went soaring across the table, narrowly missed a bludger and landed in the centre hoop.</p><p>“Yes!” Scorpius cried enthusiastically, turning to Albus and pulling him into a hug. Albus hugged him back and for some reason didn’t let go, keeping his arm wrapped around Scorpius, who did the same thing. Their warm bodies were pressed together comfortably, Scorpius was just a bit taller than Albus and his head fit neatly into the crook of Scorpius’ neck.</p><p>“Well done,” Albus tried to whisper in what he thought was a seductive way but it might have just sounded like he had a sore throat.</p><p>“Nice shot.” Thea smiled and expertly finished two of their cups.</p><p>“We should hug too,” Karl sidled up to her and tried to wrap an arm around her waist.</p><p>“Maybe if you get one in, Karl.” Thea wriggled away.</p><p>It was in that moment that Albus realised he and Scorpius were still intertwined and maybe it had been too long and maybe he was telling everyone in the room that he and Scorpius were both secretly gay by standing here together and maybe that look Karl was giving him was saying exactly that and maybe he should stop.</p><p>He pulled away from Scorpius and pretended it was because he was taking his next shot seriously. Scorpius smiled and ran his now-free hand through his hair.</p><p>Thea made her next two shots and won the game for Karl, forcing Albus and Scorpius to drink the lethal seeker cup. They ended up splitting it, Scorpius swallowing half, shuddering then wiping his mouth and handing it to Albus.</p><p>“Shall we play again?” Karl asked expectantly, unsteady on his feet.</p><p>“No,” Thea shut the idea down at once. “I’m going to find Rose.”</p><p>Albus couldn’t even be bothered to step in and try to help Karl. Why did it matter if he told anyone about Albus’ letters? Maybe he should just kiss Scorpius here in front of everyone and save him the trouble. He <em> had </em>to be Stargazer. </p><p>Scorpius made his way to some nearby seating and Albus followed, falling down beside Scorpius and barely taking his eyes off him.</p><p>“I would say we should get another drink, but I don’t think I need one,” Scorpius’ eyes were glassy behind his pretend glasses and his hair was almost back to blonde.</p><p>“Do you want to-“</p><p>Before Albus could finish his question (not that he was completely sure what he was going to ask), his cuckoo clock obnoxiously burst into life and the little yellow bird sprung forwards, hitting Scorpius in the chest.</p><p>“Sorry!”</p><p>Scorpius found the whole thing hilarious. He laughed solidly for several minutes, and Albus looped the clock over his head and put it around Scorpius’ neck instead, which seemed like something smooth and flirty he could do.</p><p>“Where’s your hat gone?” Scorpius asked, watching the little bird pop back inside the clock.</p><p>Albus reached up and felt his hair, messy as ever and completely uncovered. “You took it!” he accused.</p><p>“I gave it back,” Scorpius protested. “I put it back on your head.”</p><p>Albus struggled to remember this event, vaguely recalling Scorpius reaching up and stroking his hair in the process.</p><p>“I lost it then,” he shrugged then he felt a sudden lurch in his stomach. “One second, wait here, I’ll be back.”</p><p>He dashed through partygoers, almost immediately coming across a doorway leading to an empty bathroom. <em> Room of Requirement perks </em>Albus thought to himself as he locked himself inside and waited for the room to stop spinning, sat on the floor and staring at the ceiling. Confident he wasn’t going to throw up, Albus hauled himself back up and stared at his reflection, thinking about Scorpius waiting for him outside.</p><p>“Hey, I’m Strings,” he said to his reflection in what he knew was his smoothest voice. “It’s me, <em> I’m </em>Strings.”</p><p>Why did he pick such a stupid name? Scorpius was going to think he was an idiot.</p><p>“Been to the astronomy tower recently?” he asked his reflection.</p><p>Yes, that was far cooler.</p><p>Albus ran a hand through his hair and tried to give it that effortlessly messy look, but the hat he’d been wearing most of the night meant it just looked messy. He shrugged and left the bathroom, heart beating fast at the prospect of telling Scorpius who he was.</p><p>The seat they’d been sharing was empty so Albus scanned the room for Scorpius, but when he finally locked eyes on him, he looked a bit busy to discuss secret, anonymous letters with Albus. </p><p>Scorpius was pressed up against the wall with his tongue down some girl’s throat, seeming to be enjoying himself thoroughly. The girl was dressed as a unicorn and she’d placed her sparkly horn on top of Scorpius’ angelically blonde hair, as if claiming him as her own. Albus’ cuckoo clock lay abandoned on its side a distance away from Scorpius’ feet and he picked it up sadly.</p><p>He felt his stomach drop. Stargazer wouldn’t do that, he’d got it wrong. Albus fell morosely back into the same seat as before, glaringly alone this time.</p><p>“Al! There you are!” Polly looked relieved as she sat down beside him. “This creepy boy from Ravenclaw won’t leave me alone,” she whispered.</p><p>Albus chuckled and pulled at the ends of Polly’s blonde hair. “Creepy Ravenclaw,” he repeated, happy to let the alcohol blur out his disappointment about Scorpius.</p><p>“Oh Merlin, Albus, how much have you had to drink?” Polly removed his hand from her hair.</p><p>“Hmm, too much,” he replied, ignoring the faint feeling of disappointment in his stomach.</p><p>“Come on, let’s get you to bed.” Polly stood up and took his hand, leading him towards the door and shushing him the moment they stepped outside.</p><p>The corridor was spinning and wavering before his very eyes and Albus laughed once more as he thought about how he’d once been an innocent first year roaming these same halls. This was such an interesting thought he had to tell Polly at once.</p><p>“Pol, isn’t it funny, how once we were little first years walking down this corridor to Charms, and now here we are years later, pissed out of our faces.” He leant his head atop hers and sighed. </p><p>“Speak for yourself, Al. I’m very much <em> in </em>my face.” Polly squeezed his shoulder. “And keep your voice down, I don’t want a detention.” </p><p>“You <em> never </em> get detention, Pol. You’re always so <em> good.” </em></p><p>Polly shook her head and said nothing.</p><p>“Did you have fun tonight?” he asked her as they reached the quiet Gryffindor common room.</p><p>She shrugged and didn’t answer. “You need to drink some water.”</p><p>“I’m fine!” Albus insisted, but he was swaying on the spot and he could have sworn the pattern on the carpet was moving of its own accord.</p><p>“I’ll take you to bed, come on.” She led him to the stairs and Albus was suddenly very grateful for his best friend; he probably would have just curled up at the bottom of the stairs if he’d been on his own.</p><p>“You’re the best, Pol,” he tried to say sincerely as she pushed open the door to the seventh year boys’ dormitory.</p><p>She muttered something and gently pushed him down on top of his bed, crossing the room to his chest of drawers. Albus watched her from his position on the bed; she moved in a forced kind of way, as if she were exhausted.</p><p>“You don’t have to do that,” Albus protested as she found him pyjamas. “Come here, sit down.”</p><p>“Alright.” Polly returned with the pyjamas and sat beside him on the bed, summoning the glass on Albus’ bedside table, filling it with water from her wand and pressing it into Albus’ hands.</p><p>“Are you okay, Polly? Was that Ravenclaw boy really creepy?” Albus sipped the water and focused very hard on a point over Polly’s shoulder, willing the room to stop spinning. </p><p>“It’s not that,” she muttered.</p><p>Albus crashed down on the bed, splashing a bit of water around and pulling Polly down with him. “What’s up?” he said as they lay side by side holding hands.</p><p>There was a long pause; Polly squeezed Albus’ hand and sighed. “Do you ever feel weird?”</p><p>“All the time,” Albus replied, turning to look at her; she was staring up at the ceiling.</p><p>“I always feel weird at parties and stuff like that. I felt a bit like I was watching everything from a distance, like there’s an invisible line and I have to cross it but I just can’t.”</p><p>Albus nodded. “I know that feeling.”</p><p>Polly turned to face him. “Didn’t seem like it tonight. You were playing drinking games and dancing and talking to everyone.” She looked back at the ceiling. “I just wish I could be one of those people who can take a few shots and snog the nearest person.”</p><p>“For the record, I didn’t snog anyone tonight,” Albus chuckled.</p><p>“I know,” Polly replied. “But I just can’t do that.”</p><p>“Why can’t you?" </p><p>“I’m just,” she hesitated and adjusted her position on the bed, “not a casual person.”</p><p>Albus didn’t really have anything to say in response to that.</p><p>“Albus?” She turned to look at him again.</p><p>“Hmm?” He locked eyes with her.</p><p>“Have you ever been so into one person you can’t even think about anyone else?”</p><p><em> Yes, Stargazer, </em>Albus responded in his head. “Not yet,” he said aloud.</p><p>“Oh.” Polly sat back up and hugged her knees. </p><p>“Why, have you?” Albus pressed. Polly hadn’t dated anyone seriously before, in fact she barely talked about liking people.</p><p>She gave a very small nod. It was clear she didn’t want to tell Albus who it was she liked, and that was okay.</p><p>He sat up and placed his arm around her shoulders. “Anyone would be lucky to have you, Polly.”</p><p>“Drink your water, Albus.” She pointed to his half-empty glass, clearly not wanting to talk about it at all. He was doing a terrible job at best-friending, what else could he do?</p><p>“Do you want to sleep over, like in first year?” he offered, hoping she might just need a friend.</p><p>Polly shook her head and stood up. “No, I want to sleep in my own bed.”</p><p>“Okay. Goodnight, then. Thanks for looking after me.” He reached out to hug her and she fell into his arms for a second before pulling away.</p><p>“Goodnight, Albus.” She was gone from the room in a second.</p><p>Albus bit his lip. When Polly got like this, she liked to be by herself, but it didn’t stop him from feeling like he was being a bad friend by not staying with her. He thought about what she'd said while he changed into the pyjamas Polly had given him.</p><p>
  <em>Have you ever been so into one person you can’t even think about anyone else?</em>
</p><p>Albus’ every waking thought was about Stargazer, and he didn’t even know what he looked like. For a while, he’d looked like Scorpius. But now the Stargazer in Albus’ mind went back to being a faceless entity, although he kept Scorpius’ gorgeous cheekbones.</p><p>Albus obediently sipped his water, but when he went to place it down on his bedside table, he noticed a letter addressed to Strings. He grinned and unfolded it.</p><p>
  <em> Strings, </em>
</p><p><em> I write like I’m tall? I’m wondering what you mean by that. I couldn’t tell you if you’re right even if I wanted to, because how tall is tall? But you told me one thing about yourself so I’ll give you something too. I have a name people like to shorten a lot, to the point where it’s rarer for anyone to use my full name. It’s a shame really, I quite like my name.</em> </p><p>
  <em> I’ll be looking out for anyone with dark hair and Sloan Collins body paint at the party tonight. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Stargazer </em>
</p><p>Albus couldn’t help feeling a slight sense of loss. Stargazer had been at the party and he’d spent almost his whole night with Scorpius. It had been fun, but Stargazer had been there somewhere and he’d barely even kept an eye out!</p><p>
  <em> Stargazer, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> You write like you’re tall means you sound like one of those effortlessly cool people who have their shit together. Those people are always taller than me. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Now I just feel even worse for calling you Starry G that time. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I don’t know what to do, Star. (Is that okay?) One of my best friends likes someone and is coming to me for advice, but I’m so messed up here in my little gay mind that I don’t know how to help. I’m worried it’s making me a crap friend. Am I just being self-centred there? </em>

  <em> The party was good, I thought. I had a great time, but it feels weird to me to know you were there too. I could have stood beside you tonight and neither of us would know. I hope, someday, we can reveal our identities to each other. </em>

  <em>Love, Strings</em>
</p><p>The owl had taken to waiting on his window sill each night until he sent it off. Albus thought he might have to start tipping the owl for its trouble, as he tied the letter and sent the owl off. He always watched to see if it went in any particular direction but it never did. </p><p>He curled up in bed and closed his eyes, thinking about how he was quite pleased with how he was coming across in these letters. He definitely couldn’t be this smooth or funny in person, Stargazer was getting the best of him. That had been a great letter, it wasn’t obvious he was drunk either. He’d started and ended it how he always did, <em> dear Stargazer, love, Strings. </em></p><p>Albus’ eyes snapped open and he sat bolt upright in bed, his eyes flickering to the window where the owl had just left.</p><p><em>Love. </em> He’d signed the letter off with <em> love.</em></p>
