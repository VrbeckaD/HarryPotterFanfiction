    <p>Marvolo's POV</p><p>It had been 14 years since he had last seen his manor. He had finally regained his body after so long. A ritual that should have only lasted a few days ended up costing seeing his son's grow into wizards that they were. Yet, something was wrong. They had set up a formal breakfast that should have housed all three of his son's but the youngest by mere minutes was missing.</p><p>His oldest Damian said rubbing his eyes tiredly," I'm sure he's still in training."</p><p>Bellatrix shot the boy a withering glare but he just shrugged. Apparently something more was going on than he believed. He was about to reply when he felt the outlying wards signal someone coming up upon the manor. The magical signature was recognized to be that of Harrison his youngest.</p><p>He waited feeling the boy come closer to the manor. He could feel the sense of foreboding in the magic. It was as if magic itself was trying to warn him of something. When the door to the formal dining room opened it revealed a young man with midnight black hair and vibrant green eyes. The boy was about five foot five in height and was quite slim in his build. The air he gave off was one of exhaustion.</p><p>Harrison gave a nod to his brothers and a sneer to his mother before taking his seat. As he sat down he noticed Marvolo and his eyes widened. He said softly," Father... I did not realize you had returned."</p><p>Marvolo said in an even tone," You are late Harrison. Breakfast was supposed to start half an hour ago."</p><p>Harrison rubbed his eyes as he said," I'm sorry father but I do have other things to do. I had not realized the reason I was called home was for your return."</p><p>Marvolo noticed the subtle look Bellatrix shot their son. She was hiding something. He asked watching his son much more carefully now," And where were you, Harrrison?"</p><p>His son looked nervous as he said," Out with an old friend."</p><p>Marvolo could tell his son was lying. He would not force the issue for the moment. He noticed as the boy winced when he overreached for some of the food. So his son was hurt. His eyes narrowed as he saw the faint magic lines of glamors on the boy. What was he hiding?</p><p>Harrison's POV</p><p>He had just returned from running in the hills outside his school when he received a letter from his mother. It asked him to return to England and have breakfast with them. He quickly calculated the time difference and realized he was already late. He changed from his running clothes and wrote out a letter to his adopted mother. He apparated to Riddle manor and felt the wards acknowledge him.</p><p>He made his way inside nodding to his brothers. He sneered at his mother ignoring Gabriel's own sneer. Gabriel was the one they thought would be the heir. Damien was smarter but not quite as magically powerful. Gabriel was an idiot in his opinion.</p><p>Harrison though had very little control over his magic was more powerful than both of his brother combined. He had health issues though. According to Shiho he had three blockages making it hard for him to exercise. This also had a hand in his lack of magical control. At least that's what he suspected.</p><p>He took his usual seat but something felt off. He felt an extra pair of eyes on him. Looking up he saw a face that he had not seen since he was a year old. His father sat right across from him. For a moment they just sat there analyzing each other. He had no doubt the man was taking stock of his bruises that were glamoured. The perks of being the head house.</p><p>He said softly," Father... I did not realize you had returned."</p><p>His father said in an even tone," You are late Harrison. Breakfast was supposed to start half an hour ago."</p><p>Harrison rubbed his eyes as he said," I'm sorry father but I do have other things to do. I had not realized the reason I was called home was for your return."</p><p>Technically he wasn't lying to the man but neither was he giving the full truth. If his father knew the full truth of everything that had happened in the last week he would never be allowed to leave the manor again. As if reading his thoughts his father smirked. It was days like this he wished his teacher had just let him drown. He shivered at the thought. Mr. Han Chun Woo. Was the strangest person he had ever met. Wizard or otherwise.</p><p>Flashback</p><p>Harrison stood looking over the side of the bridge. What were they doing up here? The man said acting cold and serious," If you want to be my student you will jump off the bridge. To be my student you have to risk your life and soul."</p><p>Say what now?! He wanted Harry to jump off a bridge to prove his seriousness? But he couldn't swim... Then again if things continued the way they were going he would end up dead before the man left. Whether by his own suicidal thoughts or the bully in school.</p><p>He gulped and asked not hearing the man's last statement," If I... If i really do this will you take me as your student?"</p><p>He didn't even see the shocked look on Chun's face before he jumped. He landed with a loud splash in the freezing cold water. He struggled to keep his head above the water calling out for the man. Soon though he could no longer keep his head above the water and he sank into the dark depths of the river. Was he really going to die here?</p><p>The next thing he knew he was in a white room. For a moment he thought he had died. When he turned his head to the side to find Chun sitting in a chair next to him.</p><p>Noticing he was awake Chun asked angrily," Are you insane?! That could have killed you!"</p><p>Harrison said leaning back on his pillow and said," You said you would teach me. If it's by your order i will do it. Even at the cost of my own life."</p><p>He heard what sounded like a growl from the man. He had to bite back a smile. Ever since that first day when he saw the man take on that gang he had wanted him to teach him. What he said was true. He would do as he was told by this man. Even at the cost of his own life.</p><p>He could see the frustration in the man's face. He said with a small smile," Sir, If i can not believe in you i would rather die. Simple as that."</p><p>The man's face went from frustrated to shocked. It was obvious no one had ever said anything like that to him. He would get this man to honor their agreement. This man would teach him to be better.</p><p>End of flashback</p><p>He asked carefully," When did you return, father?"</p><p>He could feel his mother's glare trying to burn a hole into his head. His father though seemed amused as he replied," Two days ago, Harrison."</p><p>Now it was his turn to glare at his mother. He asked angrily," You couldn't have given me more of a warning?! You know i spend most of my time out of country!"</p><p>It was true. Most of his days were spent in Korea. Especially after... no he refused to think of that. He rubbed his stomach where the worst of his injuries lay.</p><p>His father's angry voice drew him from his thoughts," What does he mean he's spent most of his time out of country, Bellatrix?"</p><p>Bellatrix said," My Lord, this boy is a squib. I had him sent to a muggle school in Korea where he couldn't do any damage to our families image."</p><p>That was an absolute lie but even she didn't know the full truth. Yes he spent most of his days in Korea. Yes, to her he was practically a squib. Though not from lack of magic but from lack of control.</p><p>His father seemed to consider him for a moment. He could feel his magic testing his own. Tentatively he reached out and their magics touched. His father's magic was warm and comforting in a way he never felt before. He minutely relaxed as he withdrew his magic.</p><p>His father said staring at him intently now," That is where you are wrong Bella. Harrison is no squib. If i had to guess I would have to say he has trouble controlling his magic."</p><p>Harrison said shocked that his father figured it out so quickly," Yes, sir."</p><p>His father nodded and he slowly began to pile food onto his plate. He ate slowly so not to overwhelm his stomach. The food was rich just like he thought it would be. He would have to be careful how much he ate. He still had training to do if he wanted to run fifty laps around the track.</p><p>When his father was finished he dismissed them. But when Harrison got to his feet his father stopped him. Damn he couldn't catch a break. He sat back down but was ready to run if needed. He watched as his father closed and locked the door with a wordless wandless spell. Damn.</p><p>His father asked considering him," Where have you been going to school? Do you have a wand? Why are you considered a squib?"</p><p>He wanted to bang his head into the table but instead he said," No wand. I have no idea. And Nine Dragon's High."</p><p>His father asked," What is Nine Dragon's High?"</p><p>Well he couldn't very tell him it was a muggle school. His father would raise hell if he found out. His father though knew would not accept silence as an answer. He knew the man wasn't above using mind arts on him either. Or vetirserum for that matter.</p><p>His father said," I won't ask again Harrison. What is Nine Dragon's High?"</p><p>He avoided his father's gaze as he replied," It's a high school sir."</p><p>The man's eyes widened in anger. He knew he should have just kept his damn mouth shut. His father knew the muggle world as well as he did.</p>
