    <p>The scent of crisp parchment papers and the feel of the unyielding wood beneath my hands was what I latched to when cool grey eyes swept up and down the length of my body. I had immediately stiffened and then chastised myself and let myself go slack.</p><p>Let him stare. I have to make sure I act like a normal student at Hogwarts. Slughorn’s lesson drone on and on, and I unregretfully let it pass one ear and out the other. As a seventh year from where I was initially from, I, of course, already knew all this information.  The goal now was to act nonchalant while my brain furiously planned for any interactions regarding the tall boy still staring at me from the corner of the room where he was sitting with his crowd of sycophants.</p><p>Was he still staring at me? I still felt a laser honed gaze from my left side.</p><p>Gah. What’s his problem? I haven’t done anything to warrant him focusing on me like this.</p><p>I left my hands go to the back my head and rearrange my hair to block his gaze with my thick curls. At least they could be useful this once.</p><p>There was a large silver mirror hanging on the right side of the classroom.  Used for enchantment purposes and mostly for the vanity of most of the girls in potions class from what I seen so far. I sneaked a look at that, and quickly found the dark haired boy in the corner looking straight at me. Through the mirror. I widened my eyes and quickly looked away, acting as if I was giving a cursory glance to the room. But not before, I saw the upward tilt of his lips.</p><p>Bastard. He knows. And he’s smirking at me now.</p><p>I did not let myself squirm in the seat. And for the rest of potions class stated at Slughorn so intently, that when he gazed around the room and gestured with his hands emphatically at whatever he was teaching, he blinked. Before smiling away and using more gestures as if empowered by his students attention. </p><p>
  <em>All right class! Homework is pages 100- 150 from Incantation of Wooden Warts and a page of parchment on its uses!  </em>
</p><p>I let out a breath at Slughorn’s statement before slinking one more look through the mirror. The dark haired boy was still sitting and standing in a circle with his friends.</p><p>Good. Time to make my escap- I quickly berate myself. It was time to make a strategic move to on- “<em>New Girl”</em></p><p>His voice was like cold timber, unyielding and hard. He tried to hide it by softening his face into a smile.</p><p>He addressed me. Frozen and left with no respectable options, I turn around and give him my attention.  Now his crowd was staring at me too. Great.</p><p>“Yes? How can I help you?” I respond primly.</p><p>He slowly walked his way over to me, stopping when he was about a foot apart. I could smell him from here. Pine and soap with a musky scent wafted it ways to my nose. I tried not to breathe.</p><p>He again smiled that <em>disarming </em>smile before replying, “Hello, I am the Head Boy and its my duty to guide any new students this year, especially if they are in my own house.”</p><p> I glance down in my green uniform and try not to frown.  Blasted sorting hat. When the unfortunate events happened with the time turner exploding when it was set near the flames of Dumbledore’s phoenix, a force had grabbed and forcefully hurled me down in the past. I had viscous purples bruises on my right side due to the fall and had given quite the shock to a now younger Dumbledore. To make matters worse, when I was healed enough to enroll in class, the sorting hat gave an ill boding chuckle before proclaiming Slytherin.</p><p>I turned my attention back to the Head Boy in front of me. “Yes well thank you, but I have things under control from my end. I will be sure to ask for your guidance if I am in need of any.” I give him a cheery smile before quickly turning away.</p><p>He stops me before I can even take a step. “Just a moment. I was not done.” His eyes flashed. Not at all pleased with my dismissal or refusal of his help. ”I had not even introduced myself, I am Tom Riddle, you can call me Tom”</p><p>I gaze at him, the name still sending unwanted shivers through me. I steel myself. “I am Hermione. Hermione G-Gardner” I lightly cough before clearing my throat and plowing on. “It was a pleasure to meet you Tom, I will see you around”</p><p>His piercing eyes look right at me, analyzing.  Blasted, he probably caught my slip when I stuttered. He should not have any reason to doubt me however. He lightens his eyes and responds lowly, “Yes, I am sure you will”</p><p>His words leaves me a sudden chill that travels through my whole body. Foreboding. I glance warily at him, trying to give him an unarmed glance. Before nodding my head and walking off.</p><p>But, the tilt of his lips told me I was unsuccessful. I could feel his knowing eyes on my back as I head to my next class. </p><p> </p>
