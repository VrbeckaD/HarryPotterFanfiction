    <p>August, 2006</p><p>The broken marbles filling the window sill made for an oddly beautiful scene. The paling light coming through grey skies and falling rain danced through the glass fragments and the dust. Who’d have thought dust and broken toys could be so lovely. I didn’t remember the last time I’d been up here in the attic, but I remembered playing up here as a child.  </p><p>The sound of the rain on the window sent chills through me, and I became acutely aware of how thin my silk slip was. I’d been so hot all night in the heavy satin gown, but now my skin was exposed to the cooling air. </p><p>My skin wasn’t the only part of me exposed after tonight, though. My heart and soul had been ripped open too. It wasn’t a traumatic tear; it was a surgical incision, made to prevent the swelling from damaging me any more. And the relief overwhelmed the pain. The pressure that had been building for so long had been released, and I could breathe again. </p><p>Who’d have thought that one night could do that? </p><p>I looked around the dim attic for the box. The box I’d hidden away so many years ago. The box that held that start of our story. The most painful part. The most important part. </p><p>I spied it tucked away in the corner behind the Christmas tree and boxes of delicate glass ornaments. I picked my way across the floor, my bare feet sensitive against the raw, rough wood, and pulled on the box. It didn’t budge, and I yanked again. After several tugs, a few choice swear words, and a very close call with an unstable stack of boxes next to me, it came free. </p><p>I clutched the box to my body and retreated back downstairs into the relative warmth of my room. The rain was falling more heavily against the window, the sky quickly darkening to black. The candles lit around my room filled the space with warm, wavering light and I shivered again before reaching for my dressing gown. </p><p>I wrapped it around myself but didn’t bother with the buttons, too anxious to reach the box waiting on my desk. The lid came off easily, as if it had just been waiting to be opened, not sitting there in the dark for 12 years now. </p><p>I flashed back to my 11 year old self as I reached in, shuffling through countless letters addressed in a bold scrawl sealed with royal blue wax, and found the heavy parchment envelope, addressed in emerald green ink with a red wax seal.  I opened the letter with the same shaking fingers and read, </p><p>“Dear Ms. Vivienne Beaulieu,</p><p>It is my duty to inform you that you have been accepted into Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.”</p><p>My heart stopped after reading those words again. I was 23 now and it still felt like yesterday that Professor McGonagall knocked on our door. My muggle parents had thought it a joke at first. But once the professor had started asking about odd things happening around me, my parents had quickly realized that it wasn’t a joke, and actually made more sense than any other logical explanation. </p><p>I had been taken to Diagon Alley, and my wand had chosen me almost immediately. The dear old wand-maker had told me I had great potential and to treat my wand well, and it would never fail me. I was fitted for black robes, and gathered all the supplies needed for my first term. I was elated. </p><p>On the first of September, my parents accompanied me to King’s Cross Station and there I kissed them goodbye before confidently skipping through the barrier between platforms 9 and 10. I stared in awe at the great scarlet steam engine for some time before climbing aboard and finding a seat. It wasn’t long before I was joined by other first year students, and we all chatted away about what awaited us. I had butterflies in my stomach the entire way, but a shy girl next to me linked her arm through mine and we set off to the boats together. </p><p>As fate would have it, we were both sorted into Ravenclaw; the house of wit and learning. Her name was Hazel, and we became inseparable. Both of her parents were magical, so she helped me navigate the wizarding world, and I taught her about the muggle world. We attended every class together, and giggled when the famous Harry Potter shuffled too close to our table at dinner time. He was 2 years ahead of us, and like every other girl in the castle, we had minor crushes on him. </p><p>The first years of our time at Hogwarts had seemed so... magical. I was ecstatic our second year when Beauxbatons joined us, and my French name didn’t sound quite so foreign anymore. And then Cedric Diggory had been killed. The next year, the awful old hag had almost ruined the school. The year after that, Professor Dumbledore had been murdered. I didn’t return the following year. As a muggleborn, it was too dangerous. Hazel hadn’t either. Her family fled to Germany, and our letters had been few and far between. We missed our OWLs, and we didn’t know if there would be a wizarding world for it to matter in. We didn’t know if there would be a world at all. </p><p>But then the impossible happened; Harry Potter defeated the Dark Lord once again. I was so relieved to return to school, but I never imagined how different it would be. Hazel and I were the same as ever. Professor McGonagall was now headmistress, and we were allowed to study for and complete our OWLs. The castle looked much the same, with the moving staircases and the Great Hall and towers and dungeons. Ravenclaw tower stood tall and proud, the brass eagle knocker coming up with even crazier riddles and rhymes. </p><p>But everyone was different. I knew about the battle that had raged here. I knew students and professors alike had fought. But I didn’t realize how broken we were. </p><p>Hazel and I had taken a trek down to the monument that first day, looking for the names we knew. It had shattered us to know that there were few we hadn’t known, or at least known of. Colin Creevy had taken our photo several times. Professor Lupin had been our first (and favorite) Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor. People from our house, from Hufflepuff and from Gryffindor. </p><p>We hadn’t been there for the battle, but it crushed us all the same. All of the red rimmed eyes at breakfast became ours too. The empty seats in class felt like black holes sucking us in. The eighth years that had returned, Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom and Draco Malfoy among them seemed so much older. The halls seemed quieter, and even Peeves didn’t seem as uninhibited. </p><p>The next year it improved, slightly. By our own 8th year, the castle had mostly healed. There were still scars, a darkness that hadn’t quite lifted completely, but it was better. Now, 5 years after graduating myself, I still got to go back to the castle, as a healer. Madame Pomfrey had retired my 6th year, and they still hadn’t found a permanent replacement. It seemed that the predicaments that the students found themselves in were... overwhelming to many of the St Mungo’s healers. </p><p>I was actually considering the position myself, as I was one of the regular healers there. That’s why Professor McGonagall had invited me to the staff’s start of term party. </p>
