    <p>Albus Severus Potter was always the oddball out in his family, that included his extended family too.</p><p>He had always preferred to sit out of a Quidditch match, or a game of Exploding Snap. He wasn't shy, just not very outgoing like his siblings and cousins.</p><p>At first his parents brushed his un-Weasley/Potter-like behavior off, he was one of the youngest in the family, he was just shy and would eventually grow up and be more social.</p><p>It wasn't until Ginny watched Albus and Lily through the open kitchen window one fall day, that she started to worry. 10 year old Albus had a magnifying glass and was burning any bug he could find. He'd smirk evilly down at the burning bug while Lily screamed at him to stop.</p><p>"Albus, stop!" She cried, shoving his shoulder, "It didn't do anything to you!"</p><p>"It's just an ant, calm down," he'd reply in his quiet monotone voice.</p><p>It wasn't even a minute later a butterfly unknowingly landed at his tortuous death.</p><p>Lily spotted it first, it's pretty bright colors catching her eye, "Albus, don't hurt the pretty butterfly, please," she begged. She put her hands around it, blocking it from Al's view.</p><p>He ignored her and continued to burn another ant. Even from her vantage point, she could see Albus' evil smirk as the poor bug caught fire. Eventually Lily backed away from the butterfly, realizing Albus was humane enough to not to hurt the beautiful bug.</p><p>Ginny brought their lunch outside, three sandwiches on a little tray with some sparkling water. She set it down on the table and announced that they could come eat.</p><p>Lily jumped up and sat down next to her mum, grabbing a sandwich and stuffing her face.</p><p>Albus took advantage of her absence and kneeled down next to the butterfly who's wings were fluttering slightly. Ginny assumed the butterfly was injured, otherwise it would have flown away by now.</p><p>Albus adjusted his magnifying glass over the butterfly until a spot on it's wing started smoking. Ginny had to look away as the butterfly started squirming and tried to fly away but couldn't.</p><p>Lily was chattering away to Ginny and hadn't noticed Albus.</p><p>"-and Melanie wanted me to come over and play tomorrow," Lily said that through her sandwich.</p><p>"Albus come eat please," Ginny said, then turned back to her conversation with Lily, "Do you want to go over there?"</p><p>Lily nodded and opened her mouth to respond but then she spotted Albus and screamed.</p><p>"ALBUS!" she launched herself out of her chair, "NO!" she cried, shoving Albus away from the butterfly. She was full on sobbing as she tried to punch Albus, "I told you not to hurt the butterfly!"</p><p>The butterfly was laying lamely on the ground, half of one of its wings singed off. Ginny got up and pulled Lily off of Albus, and pulled Al to his feet by his shirt. Lily cried into her mums shoulder.</p><p>"Albus why'd you do that? She asked you not to hurt the pretty butterfly, and yet you still did. Say you're sorry," She glared down at her youngest son.</p><p>He stared blankly back up at her, "Beauty doesn't stop a killer, and I'm not sorry," he said emotionlessly, and walked inside.</p><p>Ginny gaped at her son then sat down and comforted her daughter. Ginny found the only way to make Lily stop crying was to suggest having a funeral for the butterfly.</p><p>That year at Lucy Weasley's 14th birthday, Albus sat alone on the couch reading a book about famous dark wizards around the world while everyone else laughed and talked around him.</p><p>His cousin Louis approached him with a broom in hand. Albus knew he was coming and didn't even bother to look up.</p><p>"Louis," Albus greeted. Louis was the only one of Bill's kids to inherit the famous Weasley red hair, but that was no surprise as the Veela genes where only passed through females.</p><p>"Hey, Al, want to join us in a Quidditch game? You can be Seeker," Louis offered.</p><p>"No thanks," he replied, still not even looking up from his book.</p><p>"Oh come on, we need just one more player for it to be even teams," Louis tried.</p><p>"I don't care," Albus shrugged.</p><p>"Please-" Ginny, who was on the floor playing a game with Lily, gave him a look that said 'I wouldn't push him,', "just this once? The weather is nice."</p><p>"I said that I don't want to," Albus glared up at him.</p><p>"But Lucy wants you to, and it's her birthday," Louis said.</p><p>"I said no!" Albus said sternly, "I hate Quidditch!" Suddenly Louis' hair went up in flames and he started shouting and jumping around trying to get it out.</p><p>Ginny jumped up quickly and put it out with her wand, "Albus! Apologize!" Ginny scolded once she knew her nephew was alright.</p><p>"Sorry," he rolled his eyes.</p><p>"Say it like you mean it," Ginny demanded, placing her hands on her hips.</p><p>"But I don't mean it," Albus replied.</p><p>Ginny went to scold him more but Louis cut her off, "It's alright Aunt Ginny, it was my fault, I pushed him and he can't control his magic yet. It's fine, I'm not hurt," Louis insisted.</p><p>"No, Louis, he needs to learn-"</p><p>"It's really fine, I'm gonna go join the guys out there. We'll just have uneven teams," he waved her off and jogged outside.</p><p>"That was completely unnecessary, Albus. Frankly, I'm disappointed in you," Ginny spoke.</p><p>"He was asking for it," Albus shrugged, going back to his book.</p><p>"He was not. He just wanted you to play Quidditch with them, you could have said no in a nicer way," Ginny explained.</p><p>"Mum, it's your move," Lily said from the floor.</p><p>"You can go for me, Love," Ginny sighed, sitting down next to Albus. She slipped his book out of his hands and Albus snarled at her. She slapped his check, then tucked the book under her leg.</p><p>He glared at her and turned his back, "Do not make that face at me, young man, I am your mother."</p><p>Albus rolled his eyes, and Ginny could tell even though he wasn't facing her, "Turn around please, I want to talk to you."</p><p>"You can talk to me like this," he snapped.</p><p>"It is polite to face someone when they are speaking to you," she responded calmly, deciding not to use force against force.</p><p>Albus huffed, crossed his arms over his chest and turned back around so he was facing his mother, "Why are you so angry and violent to everyone?" she asked.</p><p>Albus stared at her for a moment, "I can't help it. It's how I am."</p><p>••••</p><p>Everyone pretended to be shocked when Albus was sorted into Slytherin. Everyone in the family so far had been in Gryffindor besides Teddy, but he wasn't blood, (he was as good as though.)</p><p>The second day of school, Albus had sent a letter home saying he had been sorted into Slytherin, and that he and Scorpius Malfoy had got on well.</p><p>Harry and Ginny we're glad that he had made a friend, he had never got on with any of the neighbor kids unlike James and Lily who had made several friends, but they were worried that he had befriended a Malfoy.</p><p>They had replied that they were happy for him, and proud of him for making a friend.</p><p>Albus didn't write home much, but James did so they got frequent updates on both their sons through him.</p><p>Albus liked Scorpius' company and that was a first. They both had similar interests: setting things on fire and causing pain. They were practically two peas in a pod.</p><p>Scorpius introduced Albus to things the blonde only had access to due to his father. Things about dark magic and illegal spells, that an eleven year old should not know about.</p><p>They would read about a dangerous potion, create it in an abandoned classroom and test it out on an unsuspecting student.</p><p>Or they would find a risky hex and lurk in the shadowy corridor until a classmate passed, and catch them off guard.</p><p>They never got caught, due to their Slytherin slyness, but the news always spread rapidly about dark magic being used on a student.</p><p>Of course James reported this to his parents, and Harry, being an Aruor and all, got increasingly worried as the year went on and the anonymous attacks got harsher.</p><p>No one suspected the tiny first years handing in the library reading god-knows-what. That was all part of their scheme.</p><p>••••</p><p>'Dear mum and dad,</p><p>I know I just wrote to you two days ago for the monthly check up, but I figured you ought to know that something really creepy happened today...</p><p>Someone wrote "Voldemort will rise again," in blood on the wall and no one knows who did it. No one has been cursed or anything, but everyone's really scared.</p><p>You sure you killed old Voldy, right dad?</p><p>Love as always from your favorite son,<br/>
James Sirius'</p><p>"Who's that letter to?" Albus asked in his eerie monotone voice, sitting down next to his brother.</p><p>James jumped at Albus' surprise visit. Albus rarely talked to him during school.</p><p>"Merlin, Al, don't scare me like that," James turned to face his brother, pushing his reddish-brown hair out of his eyes, and noticed Malfoy sitting next to Al, peering at him from behind Albus.</p><p>Albus gave him a blank look, not apologizing for scaring him, just waiting for James to answer his question.</p><p>"It's to mum and dad, figured I update them on the creepy stuff that's been going on," James shrugged, folding the letter and tying it to the family owls foot.</p><p>"Why?" Albus asked, keeping his tone the same. James felt nervous all of a sudden at the lack of emotion in his younger brothers voice.</p><p>"'Cause... Dad's head Aruor and I thought he'd like to know... Did you not think about telling him?" James asked.</p><p>"There's no need to tell dad anything. He can't really do anything about it. The Aruors are not that powerful. They're weaker now that there hasn't been much action since the war," Albus replied.</p><p>James gave him a skeptical look, "You don't have faith in dad?"</p><p>Albus shrugged, "Let's just say someone who has been training in the dark arts since the fall of Voldemort, has a higher chance of taking control than some lousy Aruors who haven't got up off their asses in 20 years."</p><p>James' eyes widened in shock at his brothers words, "Who are you?"</p><p>Albus rolled his eyes, he was good at that, "Come on Scorpius, we'll be late for Charms." Albus grabbed Scorpius' wrist and they walked off, James gaping at them.</p><p>"Want to skip out and hang out by the Great Lake?" James heard Scorpius ask.</p><p>"No," Albus replied stiffly. James couldn't hear anything after that, they were out of ear shot. He watched in disbelief as they exited the Great Hall.</p><p>"Shut your mouth, you'll catch a fly," Rose joked, sliding into the empty spot across from James.</p><p>Rose, like the rest of the family, had been sorted into Gryffindor. She had her mothers frizzy brown hair and tanner skin, and her love for books and knowledge. She had her fathers eyes and freckles, and his love for Quidditch.</p><p>"What did Albus want?" she asked, having noticed her Slytherin cousin sitting with James.</p><p>"He was asking who I was sending this letter to," he gestured to the owl that was waiting for some food, "Speaking of..." he untied the letter from its foot and quickly added to the bottom of the letter.</p><p>'P.S. Albus just came up to me right as I was about to send this off. He told me that he thought you and the Aruors were 'lousy' and 'someone who had been training in the dark arts was more likely to defeat the Ministry's Aurors who hadn't gotten off their asses in twenty years.' His words not mine, and for the record I completely disagree. I was utterly shocked, figured you'd like to know...'</p><p>"Now don't go tattling on him," Rose warned, reading what he was writing.</p><p>"I've got to, dad's got to know. Albus is scary, mate," James shook his head in fear.</p><p>"Yeah, that's why you shouldn't tell. If he found out and was upset, he could turn you to ash or something," she gave him a warning glance.</p><p>"But the thing about Albus is that he doesn't care if people know that he thinks poorly of them. He'll even tell it to their face. He's messed up, mate," James refolded the letter and gave the owl a bit of his biscuit before it flew off.</p><p>Rose was silent for a moment as she thought, "Do you think it's him that's doing all the attacks? If he thinks the Dark Arts are so powerful?"</p><p>James shook his head confidently, "He may be a bit wrong in the head, but I don't think he's capable of that. Some of them were bad, like seventh years can't even do that kind of magic," James explained.</p><p>"Then who do you think it is?" Rose asked, "Do you think they're the ones who wrote... you know..." she trailed off.</p><p>James shook his head again, "I really don't know. Who ever it is though, has to have some guts."</p><p>"No kidding," Rose sighed, resting her chin in her hand.</p><p>••••</p><p>It was a weird day, Professor Beccle, the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher was taking over Potions class for the day while Professor McEwen ran some errands for Headmistress McGonagall.</p><p>"Now, remember, if you put too much salt in, when you add the silverweed, your potion will explode," Professor Beccles reminded them as he stepped away from his desk, away from his own cauldron.</p><p>"Now I am going to brew this along with you from here on out, so you can follow along with me, and you can help me if I need," he chuckled and walked down the isles of the first years to check to make sure everyone had it correct so far. He passed Albus' and Scorpius' cauldron and peered inside</p><p>"Hmm, needs more fluxweed, the book said it should be more of a green color, and the fluxweed does that," he informed the boys. Albus knew this, as well as Scorpius, they were both brilliant at potions.</p><p>Albus nodded at his professor and headed towards his desk where the extra ingredients were. He picked up some more fluxweed, then subtly placed five pinches of salt into Beccles cauldron. That was five pinches too many, the potion was sure to explode when Beccle placed the silverweed in.</p><p>Albus walked innocently back to his table, fluxweed in hand. His and Scorpius' plan had succeeded thus far.</p><p>Professor Beccle waddled back to his desk after approving everyone else's potions.</p><p>"Alright class, now measure the proper amount of silverweed and drop it in your cauldron," Beccle informed and waited while everyone did so. The only persons to show any signs of exploding was Sean Finnigan-Thomas' who's had barely let out a puff of smoke. That was a first, usually he exploded everything if there was a chance.</p><p>Albus glanced over to Rose and Dena Anderson's potion and it looked better than poor old Beccle's, and not just because Albus added extra salt.</p><p>Albus and Scorpius watched as Professor Beccle measured his sliverweed and dropped it in. It didn't even take twenty seconds before the contents exploded in his face. The cauldron burst, sending bits flying in every direction. The sticky potion clung to the walls and Beccle's robes.</p><p>Beccle stood there in shock, his eyes wide open, obviously not expecting that. It took .5 seconds before he was falling backwards, probably fainting.</p><p>Half the class laughed, half the class gasped and wondered if he was alright.</p><p>It wasn't until Willa Shastri, a first year Slytherin, cautiously made her way up and around his desk and kneeled down next to him and checked his pulse that people started freaking out.</p><p>"Get Madam Pomfrey!" She yelled, jumping to her feet, a horrified look on her face.</p><p>Some girl screamed and fainted. Albus bit his cheek to keep from laughing at the sight. Some Gryffindor boy ran out of the room to get Pomfrey.</p><p>Professor Beccle was taken to St. Mungos, apparently he had been so old that he had had a heart attack due to shock when his potion exploded. He didn't return to Hogwarts for the rest of the year, which wasn't horrible considering there was only about two months left.</p><p>Albus and Scorpius never revealed themselves, even when confronted about it by students who weren't there. Obviously the whole school knew about it within a day. People didn't know wether it was an accident or an attack.</p><p>Albus was never sympathetic about the situation, if he had tried to be, it would have been too out of character anyways, then someone would really know something was up.</p><p>"To be honest I miss Professor Beccle, he was a good teacher," Rose admitted.</p><p>Albus sighed, "He was a uncoordinated Hufflepuff with zero understanding of the Dark Arts or how to defend against them. Plus he's lousy at Potions, he couldn't even keep his from exploding after he explicitly told us not to add more than a pinch of salt."</p><p>"Potions isn't his area," Rose pointed out.</p><p>Albus sighed again, "Still. Lousy."</p><p>Rose rolled her eyes and turned away from her cousin to talk to her friend Dena.</p><p>Albus huffed and stood up, walking away to find Scorpius, at least he'd listen to Albus' opinions and agree with them.</p>
