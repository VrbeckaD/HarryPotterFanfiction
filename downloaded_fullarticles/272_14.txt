    <p>A haze settled in the air, swirling around Harry, choking him. He coughed. He got up, swaying. And that's when he heard it. The crying. He stumbled over to it and a horrible sight met his eyes. Fred was on the ground, George knelt beside him, staring in numbness and hugging his brother, who blinked, blood gurgling from his mouth, as he looked down at the large piece of shrapnel embedded deep into his stomach.</p>

<p> "Oh, Freddie, oh no, please. ."<br/>"Don't fret, Georgie. I'm right here.."<br/> "You're an idiot, Freddie." George teased, his voice breaking.<br/> " I know. "<br/> "We should've done so much more together."<br/> " I'm perfectly fine with the things we did. "<br/> "You're right. I love you."<br/> a fit of coughing<br/> "George, I don't wanna die.."<br/> " I know... " his voice breaks again<br/> "I'm sorry.."<br/> " it's okay, Freddie. You can leave now. "<br/> "I love you, George."<br/> " I love you too. "<br/> "Tell Mum I'm sorry, and I love her." <br/> "I will."<br/> "See ya, Georgie."<br/> "Till next time, Freddie."<br/> .<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.</p>
