    <p>Harry stood outside King's Cross Station, his heart pounding and his hands trembling uncontrollably. He was excited to go back to Hogwarts, of course he was! Hogwarts was his home! Besides, Harry had missed his friends and the familiarity of the grand halls, but he was also incredibly nervous to go back. So much had changed since the war ended. Everyone had grown up so much in such a short space of time, they'd all matured beyond their years. Harry was just worried the change might be a little bit too much for everyone. Harry began to wonder if he should have just stayed at Grimmauld Place, but deep down he knew a change of scenery would be good for him. At least, that's what his therapist had told him. Hermione hadn't neglected to remind him of that, multiple times in the past few months and she wasn't likely to stop anytime soon. Harry wanted to turn around and go back home, but he knew he'd never hear the end of it from Hermione if he did. He took a deep breath, pulled down the sleeves of his oversized sweater, and headed towards Platform 9 3/4.</p><p>Unfortunately, all of Harry's stalling had meant that he was one of the last students to arrive on the platform. He glanced around nervously, desperately searching for Ron and Hermione. Luckily for Harry, he spotted them fairly quickly and gave them a friendly smile that was only half fake. Hermione waved back at him, but Ron collided with him at full force.<br/>
"Ronald!" Hermione cautioned. She didn't need to say anything else; Ron muttered a brief apology and loosened his grip, allowing Harry to breathe.<br/>
"It's good to see you, mate," Ron said with a cheerful grin.<br/>
"Yeah, you too," Harry replied, with a distinct lack of emotion in his voice. "How've you been, Harry?" Hermione asked him."Alright," Harry answered wearily. It was a blatant lie, and he knew Hermione didn't believe him, but she chose not to push him. She gave him a small smile, meaning he could talk to her if he ever felt like it, and Harry was grateful. He gave her a slight nod in response, to show he understood. As if the exchange never happened, Hermione ushered both boys towards the train, as a wave of nostalgia hit Harry with almost as much force as his best friend.</p><p>The trio were some of the last students to board the train, so finding an empty compartment wouldn't be easy. Harry knew that any compartment with a space would be offered up to him, but he desperately wanted to be alone. At least, as alone as one can possibly be on a train full of hundreds of students. Harry simply couldn't handle being swamped by adoring fans. They were sweet, but they were also incredibly draining. Unfortunately, it seemed that every single compartment was completely full. Only one compartment was even close to being empty, and it was occupied by none other than Malfoy. Ron immediately grabbed Harry's arm and began to drag him away, but Hermione stopped them both.<br/>
"Come on, you both need to grow up. We all know there isn't anywhere else," Hermione said. "Besides, he could probably use some friends right now." Ron grumbled a little, but he knew Hermione was right. Harry simply shrugged. He was too tired to listen to what they were saying, and he was also too tired to care. He just wanted to sit down and possibly have a nap. </p><p>Hermione cautiously opened the door to Malfoy's compartment and stood awkwardly in the doorway for a while, before clearing her throat.<br/>
"Is it alright if we join you?" she asked. "There isn't anywhere else."<br/>
Malfoy said nothing. He merely rolled his eyes, before glaring fiercely at the trio and motioning for them to enter. The Golden Trio stood in disbelief for a moment, but they quickly sat down and shut the door when they noticed Malfoy's slightly hostile expression. Hermione and Ron slid into the seats opposite Malfoy, leaving Harry to sit beside him. Before the war, Harry would've complained bitterly and possibly even argued, forcing Ron to switch seats with him. But the war had changed everybody, Harry most of all, and he simply didn't have the energy to care.</p><p>During the train ride, neither Harry nor Malfoy spoke a word. Ron and Hermione discussed their holidays in hushed whispers, but there was an uncomfortable silence for the majority of the journey. Hermione had made an effort to include Harry in any conversation, but he made it clear that he wanted to be left alone.<br/>
"Are you sure you're alright?" Hermione asked Harry.<br/>
"Yeah, I'm fine," Harry replied, as if he was on autopilot.<br/>
"Really, mate?" Ron asked.<br/>
"Yeah, really," Harry said, not really caring if his friends believed him or not.<br/>
"You look exhausted. Have you been sleeping?" Hermione asked.<br/>
Harry shook his head. He hadn't been sleeping or eating properly since the war, but he could never tell them that because they'd worry too much. Ron and Hermione knew he'd been struggling, but they didn't know just how bad everything really was. Harry had nightmares every single night, even if he took dreamless sleep. He dreamt of the people who died for him at the hands of Voldemort. He was haunted by overwhelming guilt knowing that, in a way, Harry had killed all of those people. He was responsible for their premature deaths. Eating was virtually impossible too, and even the smell of food made Harry feel nauseous. Besides, why should he deserve to eat when he brutally murdered all those people? Why should he get to have a life when he robbed so many children of their future? He shouldn't, and Harry knew that. He knew that he deserved to suffer tremendously for what he did, so he made sure he did suffer.<br/>
Despite his guilt, Harry knew that Hermione was right. He was completely exhausted. They were still hours away from Hogwarts, so Harry leaned back and closed his eyes, and he ended up drifting off into a dreamless sleep.</p>
