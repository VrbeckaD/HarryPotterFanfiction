    <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
It was a quiet evening at number 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.The only thing that could be heard in the neighborhood was the sound of crickets chirping and the faint mewling of the cats next door. Inside of number 4 Privet Drive was a normal looking family in a normal looking house having supper with nothing at all abnormal to be found…well except for one thing.</p><p>In the hallway between the front door and the living room just under the stairs was a cupboard. It didn’t look overly peculiar except for the fact that it had three locks on the outside and they were all engaged. Inside the cupboard, was a boy. The boy could not have been over ten yet definitely looked closer to six. Small and thin, the boy had dark wild locks and the most vibrant shade of green eyes. The eyes were the color of freshly cut grass and felt as if they could see into your soul. If one looked carefully, there was a slight dullness to them, but no one ever looked carefully. The boys’ name is Hadrian James Potter currently better known as ‘freak’ by his aunt, uncle and cousin with whom he lived.</p><p>Harry sat down on the cot in his little cupboard eating a single slice of stale bread. He knew that was all he’d be getting tonight so it was best to try and make it last as long as possible. A hard bang sounded on the door of the cupboard...not all unexpected. </p><p>“BOY! Come out and do the dishes. This isn’t your luxury time! Make sure you have it done before I get back from the store you freak” Uncle Vernon yelled.</p><p>Harry didn’t even bother to reply. He simply stood up and went out to clean up dinner. While cleaning, Harry let his mind wander to other things. Harry had been old enough to start primary last year, but Dudley had to be held back so he was prevented from starting. While he was busy ‘letting his mind wander’ something or rather someone crashed into him, making the plate he was holding fall to the floor with a crash. Harry looked over at the person. Dudley, no surprise there really.</p><p>“Nice one Potter.” his cousin sneered.</p><p>“What was that? Dudders are you okay??” his horse faced aunt Petunia tittered.</p><p>The green-eyed boy looked to the ceiling as if for guidance from a higher power, he knew he would need it.</p><p>“Oh my god boy! You broke my best serving plate!!!”  Petunia screeched. </p><p>“S-sorry sorry! It was an accident!” Harry stuttered.</p><p>“Do you think I care if it was an accident?? Just wait until Vernon hears about this rubbish.” she muttered.</p><p>Harry didn’t even bother to clean up, he just ran to his cupboard and hid. </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>It wasn’t long before Vernon came home and he could hear Petunia spouting off some rubbish about him throwing the plate and almost hitting Dudley. Blimey he wished he hit Dudley, the little git deserved it. Not so little really, Dudley was the size of a small whale compared to Harry.<br/>
The cupboard door was yanked open and Harry was yanked out.</p><p>“How dare you, you little freak! I brought you into my home, clothed you, fed you and for what? So you could break all my dishes you little blighter??” Vernon yelled. </p><p>Spit flew. All Harry could think was how unsanitary his mouth must be. He was thrown to the floor harshly with his head making a loud thud on the wood floor.</p><p>“I’m tired of your freakish ways and your ridiculous behavior! Well no more, I’ll teach you a lesson you won’t soon forget.” he continued.</p><p>Taking off his belt, Vernon began to whip Harry. He whimpered in pain as the leather struck down on his face, side, back and legs. A minute or two later Vernon stopped. Curled into a fetal position harry uncovered his eyes when he thought Vernon was done. He was wrong. Immediately he felt a sharp pain on his cheek where Vernon had flipped the belt so that the buckle was hitting flesh instead. Harry screamed in agony as the buckle came down on his soft skin again and again. He begged and pleaded and sobbed, hoping that Vernon would stop. Eventually, he did stop. Grabbing the small boy’s upper arm Vernon threw Harry into the cupboard and slammed the door, not even bothering to lock it. </p><p>For a long time Harry laid on the floor of the cupboard and weeped. He had been hit a couple times, but never anything so serious as the beating he just got. Blood was seeping slightly from several places on his body.</p><p>“I have to leave, I have to get out of here” Harry whispered to himself.</p><p>After laying on the floor another hour Harry slowly got to his feet. For all his pain and injuries, thankfully no bones were broken. Quietly he snuck out of the cupboard and went into the kitchen. Grabbing Dudley’s ridiculously large lunch pack, he stuffed it with two apples, a loaf of bread, a jar of peanut butter, and two water bottles. He also went into the laundry room and grabbed a couple linen towels to wrap some of his worst wounds. Grabbing his stuff, Harry walked out the door of number 4 Privet Drive and never even looked back.<br/>
