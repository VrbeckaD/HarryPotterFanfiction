    <p>“Excuse me?” Harry looked up towards the door of the compartment where two young boys stood. The boys were similar in appearance; both had pale skin and light blond, nearly white hair but one of them had slightly longer hair and dark brown eyes and the other had slicked back, shorter hair and grey eyes. Harry recognised the grey-eyed boy as the one he had met at Madam Malkin’s and he could only assume that the other was his relative.<br/>
“May we sit with you?” the brown-eyed boy continued, flashing a friendly smile which exposed his perfectly white teeth. Harry smiled back and nodded, missing the small scowl on Ron’s face. The boys thanked him and stepped inside, placing their fancy looking trunks on the shelf above before they sat down, the brown-eyed sitting beside Harry and the grey-eyed sitting next to Ron.<br/>
“Hi,” the brown-eyed boy greeted and held out his hand towards Harry who took it. “My name is Darius Malfoy and this is my cousin.” The grey-eyed one reached out his hand as well and Harry took his hand as well.<br/>
“My name is Draco Malfoy.” Harry smiled at them both as he introduced himself.<br/>
Darius and Draco exchanged a brief look before they gazed back at Harry with smiles on their faces.<br/>
“Nice to meet you,” Draco said and then he and Darius turned towards Ron who had a displeased look on his face.<br/>
“So, you’re Malfoys?” Ron asked and Darius nodded. “Aren’t they all Death Eaters?” Darius’ smile fell but otherwise he showed no reaction to the comment and turned to Harry again but Draco’s eyes grew cold as he glared at Ron but he did not respond.</p><p>“Are you also first years?” Darius asked Harry who nodded albeit a little warily due to the sudden tense atmosphere.<br/>
“Yes, I only just learned that Hogwarts existed,” he answered.<br/>
“I take it that means you were raised in a muggle home, am I right?” Darius asked and Draco turned towards them again while Harry nodded.<br/>
“Apparently my parents were wizards but I was raised at my aunt’s and uncle’s.” Darius smiled.<br/>
“I was also raised by my uncle and aunt, Draco’s parents. Although they were wizards as well so I have known about Hogwarts practically my whole life. I have always looked forward to attending.”<br/>
“Looking forward to be a Slytherin?” Ron asked, his arms crossed over his chest as he sat slouched in his seat. Darius glanced at him, his face blank. Draco glared at Ron and proudly raised his chin, looking noble.<br/>
“I am, as a matter of fact. Our parents were sorted there.” Ron scoffed at him.<br/>
“Figures. All Death Eaters are snakes.”<br/>
“And let me guess,” Draco said as he glared at Ron. “You hope to join Gryffindor like the rest of your weasel family? The house of Dumbledore’s brainless pussycats.”<br/>
“At least we never licked the boots of some crazy killer snake,” Ron spat back. He and Draco both looked ready to start throwing punches when Darius stood up.<br/>
“Draco, calm down,” he said coolly, getting his cousin’s attention. “Let us just leave. We can find another compartment.” He reached overhead to grab their bags, handing Draco his and then moved towards the door.<br/>
“It was nice meeting you Potter,” Darius said over his shoulder, although his voice had taken a slightly bitter tone. “I guess I will see you at Hogwarts. Hopefully in better company.” He and Draco cast a quick glare at Ron before they left. Harry felt stunned; he barely even understood what had just happened and he looked at Ron who was now smiling at him.<br/>
“What was that all about?” Harry asked carefully. “What did you mean with sorting?” Ron sat up a bit straighter.<br/>
“See, Hogwarts has four houses where all the first years are sorted into upon arrival. You are sorted based on your personality and traits. The houses are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin,” he explained, his voice taking a bitter tone when he said Slytherin. “Gryffindor is the best house; it’s the house of the brave but Slytherin is the evil house. You-know-who went to Slytherin and so did all his followers, the Death Eaters. Everyone knows that all Slytherins are evil.” Harry bit his lower lip as he gazed towards the door where the two Malfoys had left.<br/>
“They didn’t seem evil,” he mumbled, half to himself but Ron heard him.<br/>
“Well, they were obviously just pretending to be friendly to get close to the Boy-who-lived. You probably don’t know this, growing up with muggles, but a lot of Death Eaters probably want to harm you because you killed their lord. They’re sneaky, slimy snakes, the lot of them.” Harry swallowed, his throat feeling dry; he did not know how this sorting was done but he hoped that he would not end up in Slytherin if it meant being surrounded by people who would wish him harm.</p><p>Darius smiled as the Hogwarts castle appeared before them; it looked just like his uncles Lucius and Severus had described it. He could not wait to enter the place which had been like a home to his father. He glanced at Draco who sat beside him in the boat and saw an equally excited look on his face. Across from them sat a small girl with blond pigtails who was gaping at the sight of the castle and next to her sat a nervous looking boy who had been gripping the edge of the boat ever since he sat down.<br/>
“Are you alright?” Darius asked the boy, holding back a smile when the boy jumped at the sound of his voice.<br/>
“I’m not a very good swimmer,” he replied with a small voice.<br/>
“I doubt you will fall in,” Draco commented, slightly amused.<br/>
“It would be just my luck if I did,” the boy sighed. The girl giggled softly beside him.<br/>
“If you do fall in we will help you out, alright?” Darius assured and then held out his hand towards the boy. “I am Darius, by the way, Darius Malfoy.” The boy held out a trembling hand, the other hand still gripping the edge, his knuckles turning white.<br/>
“Neville Longbottom,” he introduced. Darius smiled at the boy and then turned to the girl and held out his hand to her as well. She smiled back, a small blush on her cheeks.<br/>
“I’m Hannah Abbott. Nice to meet you.”<br/>
“Likewise.”<br/>
“I’m Draco Malfoy,” Draco said with a proud voice as he exchanged handshakes with the other children as well. Hannah gazed between the two blonds.<br/>
“Are you brothers?” Draco and Darius exchanged a quick glance before they both smiled at her.<br/>
“In all but name, yes,” Darius answered. “We are actually cousins but I was raised by his parents.”<br/>
“What about your own parents?” Hannah asked softly and Darius’ smile faded.<br/>
“They died…in the war,” he spoke softly. Hannah gasped and nervously fiddled with one of her braids.<br/>
“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have asked,” she said with a small voice, the blush on her cheeks darkening so her whole face appeared red. Darius gave her a small smile.<br/>
“It is fine. It was a long time ago,” he assured. He noticed that Neville had gone quiet, his head lowered to his feet. Darius had heard what had happened to the Longbottoms so he understood that the boy must be upset about it. </p><p>They did not speak any more about the subject as the boats finally reached their destination and everyone stepped out and approached the castle.</p><p>Darius recognised professor McGonagall from the descriptions he had gotten from Severus; the woman looked just as strict as he had imagined even as she greeted the students and welcomed them to the school. He held back a smile when he remembered how his uncle Severus had described her once: “The living proof that not all Gryffindors are complete fools.” </p><p>“The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily,” professor McGonagall said right before she left through a set of doors. The students all began speaking in hushed voices to each other, all speaking about the school and the sorting, some stating which house they wished to be sorted into. Darius looked around, spotting some familiar faces from children whom he and Draco used to play with when they were younger. He saw Pansy standing next to a bushy-haired girl, her arms crossed and looking slightly annoyed while the other girl seemed to be speaking to her in an enthusiastic manner. Crabbe and Goyle stood closer to the back but waved when they saw him looking at them. Darius waved back and so did Draco. Darius also spotted Harry Potter who was still accompanied with the Weasley boy as they spoke to each other. Draco noticed him looking at them and gave him a small nudge at the side to get his cousin’s attention.<br/>
“They will pay for speaking bad about our family later, you’ll see,” Draco commented, smiling at him.<br/>
“Just do not go overboard, Draco,” Darius answered, knowing the nature of his cousin. “Do not go looking for fights.”<br/>
“I’m a Malfoy, I am better than that,” Draco stated, his head held high in a noble fashion, looking, and sounding, like a smaller version of his father which made Darius laugh.</p><p>Professor McGonagall returned shortly after that, holding a rolled-up parchment in her hand, her sharp eyes scanning everyone as they all grew silent again.<br/>
“We’re ready for you now,” she stated and lead the way through the large doors and into the Great Hall which was already filled with the older students all sitting by their respective house tables while the teachers sat in front of them all. Darius and Draco both smiled when they spotted Severus and discreetly waved at him. The stern-looking man gave a small nod back as the only indication that he had seen them.</p><p>Darius gazed up at the high ceiling which resembled the night sky and hundreds of floating candles seemed to burn above them.<br/>
“It’s not real, the ceiling,” Darius heard a voice say matter-of-factly and gazed back to see the bushy-haired girl as she spoke to Pansy once more. “It’s just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts; A History.” Darius snorted and saw Pansy roll her eyes at the girl; they were in a magical school after all and he reckoned that the majority of the students had read Hogwarts: A History as well since it was a recommendation for all students before entering. He sent Pansy a sympathetic look before he once more took in his surroundings, only half paying attention to the headmaster as he spoke although he had to admit to being surprised at hearing him mentioning dying a painful death to a bunch of eleven-year-olds, some of them completely new to the wizarding world. Darius had never liked Dumbledore; the man struck him as arrogant and careless, especially in his way of running the school if the stories he had heard were any indication. He had also heard that the man did not like Slytherins which only added to Darius’ dislike towards the man.</p><p>Professor McGonagall stepped up towards the small stool on which the sorting hat rested and began to unroll the parchment in her hand, instructing the first-years to step forth when they heard their name. She put on a pair of square glasses and began to read the first name:<br/>
“First up, Abbott, Hannah.” Darius smiled and whispered a soft good luck to Hannah as she passed him on her way up to the stool. She gave him a smile over her shoulder, her cheeks once more covered in a small blush. Once she was seated on the stool professor McGonagall gently placed the hat over her head and it did not take long before it shouted out Hufflepuff in a loud, gruff voice, making some of the students jump and others gaped at the hat. Hannah was practically beaming when the students at Hufflepuff started cheering while she went to join them. McGonagall continued down the list, calling name after name who were all sorted into different houses.<br/>
“Granger, Hermione.” The bushy-haired girl raised her chin as she went up to the stool and sat down.<br/>
“What do you think? Ravenclaw?” Draco whispered to Darius when the hat was placed on her head. Darius merely shrugged his shoulders right before the hat called out Gryffindor.</p><p>More names were called; Neville Longbottom having just been sorted into Gryffindor, much to Draco’s surprise.<br/>
“He did not strike me as very brave,” he commented as Neville nervously approached his table.<br/>
“Never judge too quickly,” Darius answered back.<br/>
“Malfoy, Draco.” Darius smiled at his cousin.<br/>
“Make your father proud,” he told him and Draco smiled back.<br/>
“I always do,” he answered back and proudly went up to the stool, sitting with his back straight and a confident look on his face. Darius laughed as the hat barely even touched Draco’s head before calling out Slytherin. Draco flashed a small smirk and winked at Darius as he stepped off the stool and went to join the cheering Slytherins.<br/>
“Malfoy, Darius.” Darius smiled when his name was called out and walked just as proudly as his cousin towards the stool and sat down before he felt the weight of the old hat on his head.<br/>
“Another Malfoy, eh?” the hat spoke in his head. “Or is it Riddle-Malfoy?” Darius closed his eyes, hoping that no one was able to overhear the conversation.<br/>
“Hush, hat! Nobody must know that name. Not yet,” he spoke back and the hat hummed.<br/>
“I see, I see. Well, even though you possess traits suitable for the other houses, I suppose we both know where you belong, don’t we, boy?” Darius smiled at the hat’s words.<br/>
“Slytherin,” Darius whispered at the same time as the hat called it out. Draco and some of the other Slytherins stood up and cheered when Darius joined them. Darius could even swear that he saw a tiny smile on Severus Snape’s face as he gazed towards the dark clad man but it was very subtle, just the slightest upturn of his lips which was gone as soon as it had appeared. Draco hugged his cousin as soon as Darius sat down.<br/>
“Both our fathers will be proud,” he whispered in Darius’ ear and Darius nodded, smiling brightly.</p><p>The sorting continued and Draco and Darius smiled when Pansy came to join them at Slytherin; Crabbe and Goyle having already been sorted there earlier.<br/>
“Potter, Harry.” If Darius had not known better he would have thought that someone had cast a stupefy on every person in the Great Hall based on how quiet and still everyone got upon hearing the name. Everyone watched as Harry cautiously went up to the stool and sat down and the hat was placed on his head. The hat was silent for a long while as it seemed to ponder on where to put the famous boy. The students by the tables began to whisper amongst each other, some betting amongst themselves where he would go.<br/>
“Gryffindor!” The roar from the Gryffindor table was almost deafening while the other houses sighed and groaned in disappointment.<br/>
“That is a pity,” Darius commented to Draco and the other Slytherins. “I guess one can only hope that he does not become another Dumbledore worshipper.”<br/>
“Most likely he will,” one of the third years stated. “Have you seen the way Dumbledore has been eying him from the moment he stepped into the room? He’s practically grooming the poor boy already.” Darius glanced at the headmaster and true enough, the old man was watching Harry even though he tried to be discreet about it.<br/>
“Poor boy indeed,” Darius mumbled, half to himself.</p><p>The Weasley boy was amongst the last ones to be called for sorting. Draco was glaring as the red headed boy went up to the stool and sat down.<br/>
“I would laugh and cry if he was sorted into Slytherin,” Draco said and the others around him snickered. None of them were surprised when the hat called out Gryffindor after only a few seconds. The last one to be sorted was Blaise Zabini; Darius had met the boy a few times but did not know him too well but he smiled when he was sorted into Slytherin.</p><p>With everyone sorted and seated the headmaster announced the beginning of the feast just as the tables were filled with food. Darius had not realised how hungry he was until he smelled the food before him and he happily filled the plate before him and started eating, mindful of his etiquette just like his uncle had taught him; as a Malfoy you never wolfed down your food, no matter how hungry you are.</p><p>The feast had been a great event; Darius got to speak to a lot of his fellow house members as well as some of the ghosts which resided in the school. It had been an eventful day and some first years were stifling their yawns as the prefects led the ways to the dormitories.<br/>
“Right,” the prefect for Slytherin, Gemma Farley, said as they had reached the dungeons and stopped in front of a stone wall. “Behind this wall is the Slytherin Common Room. You will need a password to enter.” She turned towards the wall and uttered the password: “Aspidelaps scutatus” which allowed them to enter. The room had rustic stone walls that seemed to shimmer in different green shades thanks to the coloured lanterns which hung from the ceiling as well as the painted windows which showed the greenish water of the lake. Everything seemed to be in various shades of green and there was an open fire hearth by the far wall with a portrait of a serpent above the mantlepiece. Many chairs and sofas were spread out in the room, some with small tables next to them and there was also a chess table. Darius also noticed the tapestries which adorned the walls and recognised the motifs to show the adventures of the Slytherins from the medieval time.</p><p>Darius and Draco both smiled when they saw Snape walk into the Common Room and stood before the first years. His face held his usual blank expression as he gazed at the students.<br/>
“Welcome to Slytherin. As you may know our house is not the most popular at Hogwarts so it is important that you all look after one another and keep a united front. I do not expect all of you to be the closest of friends but at least respect each other and ensure that nobody is left out. If anyone is having problems, academically or privately please inform a prefect or myself. Also, just because we have a bad reputation that does not mean we should condone it. I expect all of you to be on your best behaviour at all times. I expect you to focus on your studies, mind your manners and obey your teachers. If I notice anyone’s grades slipping I will assign a tutor from one of the older students but I also recommend starting studying groups. I will not accept any of my snakes to preform badly in class or act foolishly or rudely. Any bad behaviour will be punished accordingly. Understand?” Some of the students seemed intimidated by the tall, stern looking teacher but others smiled at him as they all nodded their understanding.<br/>
“Good. I also expect all of you to keep the Common Room as well as your dorms tidy. There may be house elves here at Hogwarts but they are not here to look after any personal belongings. They will do your laundry but you will have to put away your own clothes as well as make your beds. My office will be open an hour before dinner and in the evenings until eight o’clock if any of you have any questions. Curfew is at nine o’clock sharp and you are expected to at least be in the Common Room before then. I will not tolerate anyone breaking curfew. If I, or anyone else, catch you outside of the Common Room after curfew you will be punished by point loss and detention.” The first years nodded once more and Snape gave a small nod of approval before he bid them goodnight and left again. Gemma then once again addressed the first years.<br/>
“Now, the password for entering here must not be shared with anyone outside of the Slytherin house, you are also not allowed to bring anyone else from a different house in here,” she instructed. “The password is changed every fortnight and you can see it on the notice board should you forget it. Avoid writing it down anywhere else as that may risk anyone else reading it. Any questions so far?” All the first years remained silent, some shaking their heads and Gemma smiled.<br/>
“Good. Then you may head to the dorms. Boys that way and girls this way. Your belongings should already be there.” Some of the students raced each other to the dormitories, laughing all the way, but Draco and Darius lingered at the back. Darius soaked in the atmosphere while he walked; as much as he loved living at the Malfoy estate he could not help feeling at home at Hogwarts and he planned to enjoy his time there.</p><p>Darius and Draco spent most of the rest of the evening doing some last-minute studying for their first day of lessons. Beside their required books which had been stated in their acceptance letters Snape and Lucius had also given them additional books on each of their subjects so that they could further their studies. Both Darius and Draco had also gladly shared these books or recommended titles to their fellow Slytherin first years.</p>
