    <p>Headmaster Albus Wulfric Percival Brian Dumbledore of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was siting at his desk drinking his tea and patiently waiting. The knock at the door signalled the end of his waiting "Enter." Stated Dumbledore after returning his teacup to its saucer. "Minerva, please take a seat. I have a matter of great importance to which I feel the need to discus."</p><p>Once Professor McGonagall had taken a seat<strong>-</strong>and tuned down the headmasters offer of a sherbert lemon<strong>-</strong>She had to ask what the important matter was that Albus had called her away from preparing for the start of the next school year coming up.<br/>
<br/>
"Well." Dumbledore started "Minerva, as you know once the letters have been sent out, the names of the Student's that were in the letters are also added to a list for all that years, first years. Unlike the Student registry when the names are added the use the Student's name as they know themselves. This is so that adopted Students for example, are not called by their birth name which is on our registry and not the name they may go by now."<br/>
<br/>
"Albus, has something happened with one of the new Students?" Professor McGonagall asked with concern.<br/>
<br/>
Sighing the Headmaster handed over the list of names to McGonagall. Reading down the list she suddenly stopped once she reached the name. "This... Cant be right." She whispered out.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm Afraid not. I checked it myself and the list worked as it always has." <br/>
<br/>
"It cant be. There cant possibly be a reason a child would believe this to be their name."<br/>
<br/>
"It Gets worse Minerva. Once I looked at the name I went to check where the owl was sent."<br/>
<br/>
"Who Is he?" <br/>
<br/>
"Harry James Potter."</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
Later that night Professor McGonagall approached number 4 Privet Drive after the long heated argument with the Headmaster she wanted to go and check on the boy in the hopes that things where not as bad first thought and maybe there was a chance that something was wrong with the list.<br/>
<br/>
However The headmaster refused her permission past the wards. She did however convince him to let her in to deliver his letter and get his supplies. Seeing as the wave of letters from wizarding family where all back by the next day and all the muggle-borns had had their letters delivered, but harry's was still not among those replied.<br/>
<br/>
The door opened after being knocked and McGonagall was great by a small boy who with overly baggy clothes whom looked to be around 8 years old.<br/>
<br/>
"Hello, I'm Professor m-"<br/>
<br/>
"BOY!" a man bellowed from the living room "Who is it?"<br/>
<br/>
The man who had just shouted walked into the hall "She says she is a proffff... profehsowr unc'l Vernon" the boy stated.<br/>
<br/>
McGonagall was shocked for a moment. Was this small boy Harry? she wondered looking at the small boy who could not even pronounce his words all too well.<br/>
<br/>
"A Professor eh?" the man asked "I know my Dudley has started in Smeltings, are you with them?"<br/>
<br/>
"Yes I'm Professor McGonagall, though I'm here about a Mr.Potter that live's here."<br/>
<br/>
The boy was confused wondering Mr.Potter was. "You'r on of em aren't ya." the man Vernon rudely said "We dot like you freaks coming in here and tainting my home with your freakishness." <br/>
<br/>
"I'll ignore that insult and ask again where is harry potter, is this him?" asked McGonagall "Are you?"<br/>
<br/>
"No" the boy said looking down and shaking his head rapidly "Me Not harry potur"<br/>
<br/>
"Who are you?" She had to ask even though she suspected the answer.<br/>
<br/>
"Ff-"<br/>
<br/>
"Don't boy!" the man interrupted.<br/>
<br/>
The boy looked scared so McGonagall thought it best to leave and take the young harry with her and tell him everything about who he was. The man Vernon seemed pretty happy once she told him she was taking him away.<br/>
<br/>
"Good take wretched child." was what Vernon said before slamming the door as they left.<br/>
<br/>
<strong></strong></p>
<hr/><p><br/>
With how scrawny young harry was McGonagall that it best to get something for the boy to eat while they went over the letter and who he was. however harry did not touch his food despite McGonagall telling him it was for him but he didn't seem to understand, actually he didn't say a word while she was explaining or ask any questions.<br/>
<br/>
When she was done explaining she handed him his letter. Though he still did not say anything just held it, crunching the side of the paper with his left hand while rubbing the back of his shoulder with his other hand, after he shed a few tears he handed it back to McGonagall <br/>
<br/>
Harry did not even say a thing while they where doing his school shopping.<br/>
<br/>
McGonagall rented out a room in the Leaky Cauldron and asked if Tom would keep an eye on him and make sure he gets to the train on time. She could not let the boy go back to that man. She told Dumbledore that they wouldn't treat him right but she let herself get talked into it being a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
I mean what kind of Aunt and Uncle raise a child to think Is name was Freak?</p>
