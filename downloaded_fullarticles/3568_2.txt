    <p>The building at 175 Bleecker Street had been empty for well over six months, a fact that Doctor Stephen Strange was more than willing to accept. This meant that his own residence at 177 Bleecker Street had no neighbors to one side. All four apartments at 175 were empty as was the business storefront space on the first floor. Rumor had it that the owner of the building had died a year ago and the heir of the estate hadn’t renewed any of the leases so one by one the residents next door had moved out when their lease expired and Doctor Strange had been left with peaceful silence. Until one morning when he stepped out to check his mail and he knew everything was about to change. </p><p>A cab pulled out to the curb and out of the yellow car a woman stepped out. She was easily the most strangely dressed woman he had ever seen. She was blonde haired, in her mid thirties, wore a green and white striped shirt with a purple floral skirt and yellow converse sneakers. If that wasn’t odd enough, there was also the oversized goggles she wore over her eyes and flamingo umbrella she carried under her arm which almost seemed to be alive. He couldn’t be sure. She set her plaid suitcase down on the curb as the cab drove away, took a key from a string around her neck, and gazed at the main door to 175, as if she weren’t quite ready to go inside just yet. Whoever she was, Stephen had no interest in meeting this new neighbor of his. Anyone dressed like that probably wasn’t quite right in the head. He moved to go back inside with his mail and she caught sight of him. </p><p>“Oh!” She said with a little surprise in her tone. “I didn’t know there were any wizards on this street.” Her accent was not American, probably British, he guessed.  </p><p>What the hell? How could she possibly know anything about him? Maybe she was just speaking nonsense. She looked like the sort of person who would speak nonsense. “You’re moving into 175?” he asked. It couldn’t hurt to at least attempt to be polite. Having neighbors who hated him was never a good thing. </p><p>She lifted her goggles and placed them on top of her head, then glanced back at the locked door. “Well that really depends on if the building welcomes me or not. No one should move into a place where they aren’t welcome. It causes all sorts of magical disturbances, but you know that, being a wizard.” </p><p>He raised an eyebrow. “What makes you think I’m a wizard?” From a medical perspective, he was pretty sure this woman was schizophrenic. He needed to eventually find out if she had any family nearby to make sure she took her meds. The last thing he wanted was for the job to fall to him. </p><p>“Your house is full of magic and that magic followed you out here. I can see the glow,” she pulled the goggles from off her head and held them out to him. “Want to see?” </p><p>No, he didn’t want to see. He didn’t want to encourage her illness. Though, maybe he could just take a look, tell her he saw nothing, and put an end to this before it went too far. “Fine,” he went down his steps to where she stood on the sidewalk and took the unusual thick goggles. To his surprise, there was a green glow around his door and coming off his hands. The green glow surrounded his new neighbor as well. Nothing else on the entire street shared this glow. He had no explanation for this. He passed the goggles back to her. </p><p>“Did you see it?” she asked him curiously. </p><p>He decided not to answer that. “I didn’t get your name?” </p><p>“It’s Luna. Luna Scamander.” </p><p>“Doctor Stephen Strange,” he told her then stepped back towards his steps. “I’ll let you get settled in.” he went back inside before she could say anything to stop him. </p><p>****************************************</p><p>Doctor Strange saw Luna a few times in passing over the next week. Well, he saw her from his window when she went out and checked the mail or returned from the store with a bag of groceries. He never actually spoke with her. She was always dressed in mismatched clothing and completely oblivious to how out of place she looked. At the end of the week after she moved in, Stephen checked his mail and found a large manila envelope addressed to Luna.The sender was listed as a Medical Office in London. He went down his steps to the sidewalk with a plan to just drop the letter in her mailbox without the need to actually see her but it didn’t work out that way. Just as he reached the box by her door, she stepped out. </p><p>“Hi. I got this in my mail,” he passed her the thick envelope, hoping to make a quick getaway before she starting speaking more nonsense. </p><p>“I was just going to the park to look for water sprites but…” </p><p>Luna took one look at the envelope and paled. He was pretty sure she might start crying which only reinforced his desire to go back home as quickly as possible. She thrust the envelope back into his hands. </p><p>“You read it. I can’t.” She said, visibly shaken. </p><p>“Are you sure?” he asked. Whatever this was, it was personal. Maybe it was even some sort of formal diagnosis for her condition. </p><p>She crossed her arms across herself and nodded. “Please just read it and summarize it. I don’t want to know all the details. Just the summary.” </p><p>Stephen opened the envelope and found what seemed to be three autopsy reports for Rolf, Lorcan, and Lysandor Scamander. That was the same last name as Luna. These were autopsy reports for her family. Luckily, being a doctor himself, it was easy to summarize the reports. </p><p>“It says that all three died of blunt force trauma,” Stephen told her. </p><p>She uncrossed their arms. “But were there signs of a struggle?” </p><p>He nodded. “Yeah, defensive wounds on Rolf.” He could see from the report that Rolf was listed as age 38, and the other two were twins age 13. The deaths had happened six weeks earlier. “These people were your husband and sons?” </p><p>“Yes,” she whispered. </p><p>“What happened?” He asked, finding he did have a little compassion for her somewhere. Not much, but a little. </p><p>Luna sighed before answering. “I know you practice mystic arts and that’s not the same as the sort of magic I practice. So maybe you haven’t studied magi zoology but that’s what my husband was, a magi zoologist. Someone was draining unicorn blood and he got involved to try to stop them. Everyone says what happened was just a hiking accident but it wasn’t. It was revenge by those poachers he stopped.”</p><p>Stephen was half inclined to believe her. “Show me what sort of magic you practice,” he said. The scientist in him still needed proof. </p><p>She took her purse from off her shoulder and opened it up. Then she began pulling out all manner of items from inside, items far too large to fit in such a small purse. First a few books, then a bottle a water, a butterfly net, a lunchbox, a change of clothes, two pairs of mismatched shoes, a hairbrush, a tent, a blanket….</p><p>“You can stop now,” Stephen said as he watched the items pile up at her feet. “I believe you.” </p><p>She took a wand from the back pocket of her red jeans and with a quick flick moved all the items back into her purse. She reached over and took the envelope from him and placed it in her mailbox. “I don’t want to look at it yet.” she said as explanation. “There are too many things I don’t want to look at lately. Especially not the fourth floor window at 5AM. That’s when old Mr Brewster across the street takes a bath and he doesn’t close his curtains.” </p><p>“I wasn’t aware of that,” Stephen said, trying to hide his amusement. </p><p>Luna went past him down the steps, then turned back. “Have you ever seen a water sprite?” </p><p>“I can’t say that I have,” Stephen replied, wary that she might invite him to look for them with her. </p><p>“If I find one I’ll bring it back so you can see it,” Luna offered. </p><p>“There’s no need for that. Maybe the water sprites would rather not be captured,” he said, thinking quickly of an excuse that would keep her from visiting him. </p><p>“It’s okay,” she shrugged. “You don’t have to make up reasons to keep me away. I know you like your solitude. There’s nothing wrong with that. If you tell me that you’d rather be left alone, I won’t be upset.” she said kindly. </p><p>“Most people would,” Stephen was a little surprised at how perceptive she was. “But you’re right, I’m not one for visitors very often.” </p><p>“I understand,” Luna moved to head off towards the park. </p><p>“Luna?” he called after her. “If you find a water sprite go ahead and stop by for ten minutes or so.” </p><p>“Only ten minutes,” she agreed with a smile.</p>
