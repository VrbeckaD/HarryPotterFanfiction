    <p>Draco filed off the Hogwarts Express behind Crabbe and Goyle, his eyes on the back of Harry's retreating head. He'd never met the boy before, although he'd seen him in his compartment on the express, and had immediately noticed Harry's soft green eyes and messy hair. </p><p>Draco knew all about Harry Potter. His father, Lucius, had brought him up hating everything to do with Harry; Lucius had made sure of that. </p><p>The evening hummed with anticipation and excitement. Children and teenagers, bodies pressed close, struggled through the station, juggling their cages full of owls and various trunks. The first years were being hailed by a large, bearded man, who stood head and shoulders above the tallest boy in the school.</p><p>"Firs' years! Firs' years! Over here!"</p><p>Draco, Crabbe and Goyle changed direction and approached the large man. Harry was now speaking to him like an old friend. Beside Harry was a freckled, red-head Weasley, a plump boy with a worried expression on his face and a bushy-haired girl with large front teeth. Draco tried not to follow Harry with his eyes.</p><p>"Everyone here? Righ', you lot! Follow me!" roared the man, and the group moved off down a rocky path. Crabbe and Goyle stumbled clumsily down the slippery path, silent. Draco watched Harry talk with the Weasley, slight jealousy inside him. He pushed it down.</p><p>"Two to a boat, everyone in!" roared the man, getting into his own boat. Draco looked at Crabbe and Goyle and rolled his eyes. "Goyle, come with me. Crabbe, go with Pansy," he ordered, choosing the lighter of the two. The two boys shuffled into the boats as Draco had ordered and the whole fleet took off across the lake, gliding along the silken water of the lake. Harry trailed his fingers in the water for a moment and Draco did the same, subconsciously. As the boats gently came to a halt underneath a rocky overhang, Draco scrambled out with a yelp; a toad had surfaced from beneath his seat.</p><p>"Allrigh', that everyone?" asked the man, who was counting as the children disembarked. "You there, this your toad?"</p><p>"Trevor!" cried the plump boy blissfully, holding out his hands. Draco followed Crabbe and Goyle up the grassy slope to two enormous doors. Hagrid flung open the doors and up the stairs they went, then were directed to wait in a chamber. There was muffled whispering and talking. Draco leaned against the stair rail and spoke up.</p><p>"It's true then, what they're all saying," he said loudly so that everyone heard. Harry turned toward him. "Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts."</p><p>Whispers broke out as all eyes turned to Harry and his scar. Draco smiled a little.</p><p>"This is Crabbe and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy." Draco moved toward Harry a little, giving off an aura of confidence. "Draco Malfoy."</p><p>The Weasley sniggered and Draco's head snapped to him. "Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a Weasley." Draco spat, his bias rising up inside him. He turned back to Harry. "You'll soon find out that some Weasley families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there."</p><p>Draco held out a hand. Harry looked at him and shook his head. "I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks," Harry said. There were 'oohs' from the children. A hand clamped onto Draco's shoulder and he moved out of the way of a teacher, scowling at Harry. Inwardly he felt hurt and rebuffed. He hadn't done anything to Harry to deserve that sort of attitude! How dare he?</p><p>"That will be all, Mr Malfoy," said the professor, smiling a little. "I am Professor McGonagall. Welcome to Hogwarts."</p><p>"In a moment you shall be entering the hall, and undertaking the sorting. This determines which core strengths you possess and place you in your houses, which shall be your families for the remainder of your school life. Intelligence for Ravenclaw, bravery for Gryffindor, ambition for Slytherin and the rest go to Hufflepuff. Please enter now and line up on the stage. Into a line, quickly now!"</p><p>The trembling students lined up, Draco finding himself behind Harry, and they entered the hall. </p><p>The roof was an exact replica of the sky outside, stars glowing behind clouds. The hall was lit wth thousands of floating candles. Four great tables stood side by side, filled with students who watched the first-years enter, whispering to each other now and then.</p><p>The first-years lined up on the stage and one by one were directed to put on an old hat, which called out their houses. Draco was called last.</p><p>The hat slipped down over his face and he waited. A little voice spoke in his ear.</p><p>"What do we have here, hmm? A Malfoy! Never seen one with so much confusion! There is courage, I see, plenty of it; and cleverness, there's ambition too. Now, where shall I put you?"</p><p>Draco thought as hard as he could. 'Slytherin! Please!'</p><p>"Slytherin, ey?" the hat asked. "You have ambition, but I think I will put you in... Gryffindor!"</p><p>This last part was shouted to the hall at large, and Draco froze. Professor McGonagall jerked the hat off.</p><p>"Down to your house, please, Mr Malfoy," she said sternly. Draco stood up; his legs weren't working properly. There were shocked whispers across the hall, and Pansy, Crabbe and Goyle were staring at him, open-mouthed. Draco stumbled to the Gryffindor house table and sank down, horrified. He had only one thought going through his mind.</p><p>His father was going to <em>kill<em> him.</em></em></p>
