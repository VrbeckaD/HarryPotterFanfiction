    <p>The first time Hadrian met Tony Stark they were both twenty-two and attending a conference on applied advanced mechanical physics in Amsterdam. Harry wasn’t there to learn, rather it was a favour to Hermione.</p><p>Harry had been standing next to Hermione, acting mostly as body guard rather than actually learning. The talking part of the conference had ended and now everyone was mingling, so Harry refused to move more than two feet from his best friend despite that fact that intellectually, he knew she was more than a match for anyone else in the room.</p><p>Because of that, he was standing right next to her when Tony Stark started flirting. Hermione handled it well to begin with, but Stark was forward. Harry had stepped in.</p><p>“Mr Stark, is it?” Harry cut in, Hermione smiling at him thankfully.</p><p>The rich, admittedly genius man’s gaze immediately went to Harry, the intelligent brown eyes running up and down as though sizing him up. Harry saw the change in him, saw his thoughts turn from flirting to keep his image to genuine interest. Harry could admit that the man was good looking, just a touch taller than Harry was with dark brown hair and a carefully trimmed van dyke.</p><p>“That’s right. I don’t believe I know who you are though.” The man asked with a smile. The smile was an odd thing, the curve genuine but the teeth simply there for effect. Harry knew that Stark was world famous and had been raised in front of the camera, but seeing the tabloid grin just saddened him.</p><p>Harry knew what it was like to be both simultaneously adored and loathed.</p><p>“Hadrian Potter-Black.” Harry answered formally, trying to show that he wasn’t interested. It was a lie, but Harry wouldn’t leave Hermione that night. “Unfortunately, while Mrs Weasley-Granger is looking absolutely stunning, I feel I have to inform you that she is also happily married.”</p><p>Stark’s eyes had darted towards both Hermione and Harry’s ring fingers, lingering on Harry’s bare hand before rising to Hermione’s face once more.</p><p>“Your husband is an exceedingly lucky man.” Stark said, kissing Hermione carefully on the knuckles before stepping back, smirking at the blush painting her cheeks.</p><p>Then, with a level of subtlety that he had doubted the man possessed, Stark had simply raised a questioning eyebrow at Harry, double checking he wasn’t interested. For a second Harry was actually disappointed that he was escorting Hermione, disappointed that he couldn’t risk a fling with someone so famous, couldn’t risk his problems coming back to bite him in the ass. He allowed a half second to mourn what could have been before regretfully shaking his head.</p><p>Stark had watched him closely, his eyes razor sharp. It seemed he had seen the regret because the smirk he sported had softened. It was commiserating. And then Stark had left, moving on to the next person. Half an hour later Hermione and Harry had left too, returning to England.</p><p>The sharp brown eyes had haunted him for a single night before Harry had banished them. He had other problems to worry about.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Times were changing in the magical world. As the Muggles progressed with their technology, it had become increasingly obvious that the Magical Community’s ability to hide themselves was waning.</p><p>With Harry’s generation taking charge in the Ministry, change had come. The Magicals were separating from the Mundane world.</p><p>It was a monumental effort, involving countless hours of effort and preparation, but they’d already had the method. The idea of an alternate reality had already been implemented previously by the elves of old; it was simply a matter of the details.</p><p>Everyone was leaving, bar a stubborn handful. It made sense to move, especially when it would take little to no effort on the part of the individual.</p><p>There was even a plan for muggleborns. Portals could be opened on occasion to transfer families. In time, when wizards stopped leaving squibs in orphanages and stopped marrying muggles, muggleborns would stop appearing altogether and the magicals would separate completely.</p><p>The process was almost complete. Almost all magicals currently resided in the separate reality.</p><p>Hermione had wanted to learn all she could before the magical world finally separated entirely, hence Harry being there to keep her company at various conferences as their time together was short.</p><p>Harry was part of the handful that would not be leaving with the rest.</p><p>In the four years since the end of the war Ron and Hermione had married. They suited each other perfectly and Harry had no doubt that they would get by just fine without him.</p><p>Ginny and Harry had broken up within a year. They’d tried so hard to be right for each other but their personalities had just been too strong. With the war over, Harry had become fiercely independent, never wanting to be controlled again. Ginny had fallen in love with little lost Harry who had needed her to take charge. They were just too different in the end.</p><p>Everyone else had moved on, but Harry hadn’t been able to.</p><p>The instincts ingrained into him through a life filled with neglect and danger were too hard to shed. He’d tried to work on it, taking muggle self-defense lessons to use up some of his restless energy. While his skills had improved exponentially, his reactions to loud noises and sudden movement hadn’t really lessened. That added to his fame made for a volatile mix. He would have recovered over time, he knew, but there were other factors in his decision. He was still so famous that he couldn’t walk down a street unmolested unless glamoured. His home was under constant bombardment and he was still on occasion targeted by those who saw him as the leader of the changes happening in the community. Finally, the Hallows refused to leave him and he was just too much of a target with them to risk his friends and family.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The second time Harry ran into Tony Stark was a year later, once more with Hermione at the final conference she would attend before leaving for the magical world. The conference was in Bern, Switzerland on New Year’s Eve. This one was a mix of subjects but Harry barely listened. Mentally he was going over everything he would need when the portal closed three days from now. His finances had been finalized, the wealth of the Potter’s and Black’s safely dispersed throughout several muggle banks over the course of several years. His house, a refurbished 12 Grimmauld Place, was mostly magic free beyond his library and the house’s magical protections. He had caught up over the years on muggle advancements, fully able to use a laptop and cellphone as long as he kept ahold of his magic. He wasn’t brilliant, be he could at least turn them on and off now.</p><p>He had said his goodbyes.</p><p>He was still lost in his thoughts later while he watched Hermione mingle when Tony Stark had suddenly appeared next to him.</p><p>“Well hello there, Hadrian Potter-Black.” The man had murmured, startling Harry into reaching for the elder wand hidden magically in his pocket. By the time his mind had caught up to his hand Stark had been looking at him appraisingly, sharp brown eyes glittering over the top of sunglasses.</p><p>“Mr Stark.” Harry had replied, a half frown quirking his lips.</p><p>“Tony, please.”</p><p>Harry turned to look at the man, a year older but hardly changed. He looked tired but hid it well, explaining the sunglasses. For a moment Harry cursed himself. It would be so easy to just say yes, to let Tony take him up to his room for the night and make Harry forget about his three day deadline. But Harry wouldn’t do it. He knew that his mind was far, far to messed up to not form some kind of attachment to the billionaire genius.</p><p>He let loose a sigh. “Unfortunately, it will have to stay Mr Stark.” He murmured, shoulder hunching with his unhappiness.</p><p>The brown eyes wouldn’t let him go. They seemed to see right through him, seeing every nuance in his body language, every through running through his head.</p><p>Tony’s lips had quirked into a smile, small but entirely genuine. “Maybe next time then.” He simply offered.</p><p>Harry had barely paused to consider. “Maybe.” He agreed. <em>Hopefully</em>, his mind added.</p><p>He and Hermione left ten minutes later.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The third time Harry met Tony Stark was completely accidental and two years later.</p><p>Harry had been walking home from the library in London, his head still in the book he had been reading. He had briefly looked for cars before crossing the road but had obviously not looked well enough to notice the black Maybach rounding the corner. He had heard the screech of tires and looked up only to find the car filling his vision.</p><p>In the end the car barely hit him, just misbalancing him enough to send him to his ass. Unluckily, the phone that had been in his hand was reduced to so much plastic and glass rubble on the road.</p><p>“Merlin dammit.” He muttered, getting to his feet to apologize to the driver whom he had almost made a murderer out of. He never got the chance.</p><p>“Are you alright!?” The driver had hurried out of the car, patting Harry down and talking fast with worry. “I’m so sorry! I didn’t even see you till you were right there, and I always forget that Poms drive on the wrong side of the road. Oh, damn, your phone!”</p><p>It was then that Harry noticed three things. One, the driver was American. Two, the Maybach was indeed on the wrong side of the road, although the lack of cars in the area meant that the mistake was at least understandable. If you ignored the parked cars and the street signs.</p><p>The third thing he noticed was Tony Stark leaning on the back door of the Maybach that he had just been hit by.</p><p>“Hadrian Potter-Black.” The man exclaimed, sounding honestly surprised.</p><p>Harry felt his mouth fall slightly open in shock. “Tony?” He asked incredulously, automatically referring to the man by his first name as he had been in his head for two years.</p><p>Despite his best attempts, his last meeting with Tony was never really far from his mind. It was as though their second meeting had stuck the what-if’s firmly in Harry’s head, making for good fantasies but restless sleep. Harry had convinced himself it was just loneliness. The way his magic was taking notice right now suggested that might not be the case.</p><p>Tony smiled at his name, that genuine smile making a reappearance. “Well, it seems like this is my lucky day.” He said walking over. The driver was still fussing but Harry didn’t really notice, even if Tony did.</p><p>“Happy, why don’t you get back in the car? Mr Potter-Black will be accompanying us so I can repay hitting him with a car by buying dinner.” Tony said, raising an eyebrow at Harry. The same questioning eyebrow as he had used the first time.</p><p>This time however, Harry had absolutely nothing to lose and nothing to hold him back.</p><p>“Call me Harry, Tony.” He murmured, nodding his head slightly in agreement.</p><p>Tony’s smile was megawatt bright, making his dark eyes light up and Harry couldn’t help but smile in return.</p><p>They talked on the way to Tony’s hotel. Easy stuff like where they lived and what they were currently working on. Harry had blushed slightly when admitting he was jobless and living off inheritance money but Tony just laughed. The first true laugh Harry had ever heard from the man. Tony seemed to be particularly enjoying himself with Harry’s lack of knowledge on the engineer. While Harry didn’t live under a rock, he didn’t pay much attention to gossip.</p><p>The conversation was easy, smooth. When he wasn’t acting up for the media Tony was charming and witty and so, <em>so </em>clever.</p><p>They arrived at the hotel quickly. It took Harry ten minutes solid to assure Happy, as the driver was called, that it wasn’t all his fault, that <em>Harry</em> had been the one not paying attention.</p><p>Tony offered to take him to the hotel restaurant but Harry saw the slight tightening of Tony’s shoulders at the idea of dining in public. Harry instead suggested room service and couldn’t help but laugh at the genius’ relief. Despite everything, Tony was still only twenty-five. So was Harry technically, but he had been forced to grow up quickly.  </p><p>Dinner was nice. The champagne was nice. The conversation was nicer. They stayed on light topics until finally Tony leaned over to draw Harry into a heart stopping kiss.</p><p>Harry was the one to pull back, trying to catch his breath. He met Tony’s eyes, the brown almost hidden by blown pupils. Despite that the gaze was still sharp and insistent.</p><p>Harry hated to do it, but it seemed now or never. “Only tonight.” He murmured, lips still tantalizing close to Tony’s. He wasn’t ready to be thrust back into the spotlight and Tony was so popular with the media that it was inevitable he would be seen. Harry could also admit he didn’t want his heart broken.</p><p>Tony searched his gaze. Harry wondered if he could see his sadness, his regret at the limitation despite his reasons.</p><p>“Well, we better make it a good one.” Tony murmured before pressing their lips together firmly.</p><p>It <em>was</em> a good night. So much so that when Harry woke it was after ten and the bed was empty. Harry wasn’t surprised in the slightest. What did surprise him was the phone sitting on the bedside table with a handwritten note.</p><p>
  <em>For the one I broke. StarkTech, so it’ll always have signal if you can see the sky. Also, free as it uses my satellites. Till next time, T.</em>
</p><p>Harry could never have predicted just what the phone would bring.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It was three days later when the phone went off. Harry had picked it up curiously as he very rarely received messages.</p><p>It was Tony, who had obviously programmed his number into the device. The message was short, but it made Harry smile to know that the man had thought of him.</p><p>
  <em>Red or blue?</em>
</p><p>Harry didn’t know why the man was asking, hadn’t even know that he’d had Tony’s number until right then. But the contact from the genius billionaire soothed something in Harry that he hadn’t noticed until it loosened, his magic sighing in contentment. Despite his magic’s happiness, Harry wondered how long this would last, wondered how long it would take Tony to grow bored with something he had experienced once but wouldn’t again.</p><p>Despite his misgivings, Harry replied.</p><p>
  <em>Red. You? Apples or Oranges?</em>
</p><p>Replying turned out to be the best decision of his life.</p><p>They traded questions back and forth for the rest of the week. Sometimes meaningless like Harry’s first question but other times more personal like, <em>Did you get on well with your parents?</em> While it still gave Harry a pang of sadness he had asked the question and supplied his own answer. Tony’s answer hadn’t been too promising but Harry understood what the few words were trying to convey.</p><p>
  <em>No, not really.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>That sucks. Dogs or Cats?</em>
</p><p>And they simply moved on.</p><p>At one point Harry asked the time where Tony was and was not overly surprised to find out Tony should have been sleeping at such an early hour. Tony had elaborated with <em>inventing</em> and Harry had laughed out loud at the mad scientist vibe.</p><p>The replies ranged from instantaneous to drawn out depending on what they both were doing. Harry had looked up the time difference between London and the East Coast of America, determining that London was eight hours ahead, so later in the day for Harry was Tony’s business hours.</p><p>Again, some questions were playful, such as <em>What animal would you be?</em> Harry had laughed to himself at the question, replying with an honest <em>Snow Leopard</em> due to his animagus form before laughing again at Tony’s reply.</p><p>
  <em>A giant kitty cat? Not surprising given how much you like cuddling. I would of course be a dolphin or a crow or something else super smart.</em>
</p><p>Harry couldn’t resist the reply,<em> Not a peacock then?</em></p><p>The little interaction had opened the way for teasing to such a degree that Harry would burst into laughter in the library or in the little cafés he frequented due to Tony’s witticisms.</p><p>As the days progressed into weeks the questions became more personal. Kids, relationships, other problems in their lives. Harry found himself much less lonely now that he knew Tony was just a text away.</p><p>Harry finally got a job as a barista in a tiny little café in central London, frequented by all kinds of people from the rich and famous to little old ladies who wanted a nice cup of tea. The best part was that the owner, a woman called Winona in her late fifties, didn’t mind if Harry answered texts during quiet times. It was nice to take a break between practicing his magic and attending martial arts lessons, which he had kept up.</p><p>He also finally googled Tony, opening up a whole new range of questions.</p><p>
  <em>You’ve got a Doctorate? And four times over!</em>
</p><p>Tony had predictably returned the favour with a super in depth background check. Harry had been curious as to what the man would find and was not disappointed.</p><p>
  <em>Where were you after you turned eleven?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Why were there so many child neglect inquires when you were a kid?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Why does your house not exist on StarkMaps?</em>
</p><p>Some of them Harry could answer, <em>a technologically backwards boarding school in Scotland, The Dursleys were good at pretending to be normal when child services visited. </em>It became much more difficult trying to explain why his house was invisible. He couldn’t really say, <em>Oh it’s just protected by a Fidelius Charm and also happens to be Unplottable</em>, now could he?</p><p>Harry agonized over his answer for close to three hours. There was no longer a Statute of Secrecy but he had spent so long protecting himself that letting go was difficult. What if Tony thought he was a freak like his uncle had? What if he told someone else and Harry ended up a prisoner somewhere?</p><p>Harry didn’t really believe Tony would do that, but they had only been texting for a matter of months. In the end Harry couldn’t answer.</p><p>
  <em>Can I ask for a temporary reprieve for that one?</em>
</p><p>Harry had waited with bated breath, hoping Tony would hold off.</p><p>
  <em>You owe me one.</em>
</p><p>And they simply continued on.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Months turned quickly into two and a half years. Five and a half years since they had first met in Amsterdam. They had actual phone conversations where they talked about nothing for hours. Harry was introduced to JARVIS who apparently also controlled his mobile phone. Tony complained about Stark Industries and Pepper and Rhodey and his Godfather Obie. Harry talked about his lessons and the people he met in the café where he worked to fill the days. He’d grown quite attached to Winona and several of his regulars.</p><p>He had also finally given in two months ago and told Tony why he had an invisible house. It had been an actual voice conversation and because of that, Harry had turned into a rambling mess.</p><p>“I know you’ve been curious about my house for a while now.” Harry had started well enough.</p><p>“<em>Damn right I have. You finally gonna spill?</em>” Tony sounded curious and eager.</p><p>Harry had sighed gustily and that was what started the verbal diarrhea. “I’m not sure you’re gonna like the reason, because really you are the most science-y guy I have <em>ever </em>met and I can’t give you a real answer that makes sense in physics and math terms because I don’t know if it <em>has</em> a real reason—”</p><p>“<em>Hey, Hey! Easy there, Kitty cat! Why don’t you try like three words instead of fifty?</em>” Tony interrupted, sounding worried.</p><p>Harry stopped, took a deep breath and managed to get out a reasonable sentence. “It’s protected by Magic.” He whispered, slightly miserable, convinced the man would think him insane. Merlin, he hoped Tony didn’t laugh.</p><p>“<em>You’re serious?</em>” Tony asked, sounding honestly stunned. It was strange for Harry, who had never heard the genius genuinely speechless.</p><p>“Yeah, pretty much.”</p><p>Tony was silent for all of four seconds before, “<em>How does that work?</em>”</p><p>That had opened the floodgates.</p><p>And Tony hadn’t cared. Not about Tom Riddle or Hogwarts. He hadn’t cared about any of it, not even the fact he could turn into a giant man eating cat. In fact, his nick name of Kitty cat just got far more use.</p><p>Everything was going so well. That probably should have given it away.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It was the sixth of May. He and Tony were both twenty-eight.</p><p>Tony had gone to Afghanistan to do a weapons demonstration. He’d been texting Harry, explaining that he was in the Fun-Vee whilst Rhodey had been demoted to a different convoy.</p><p>Harry had been nervous the whole time Tony had been overseas but was unable to explain why to the cocky man. It had gotten so bad that Harry felt sick, hands holding the phone to his chest just waiting for Tony to reply every time.</p><p>Then Harry got a single text. It was only seven letters but it was enough.</p><p>
  <em>Love you.</em>
</p><p>Harry had stared at the little screen in horror, knowing there was only one reason that Tony would say that to him. They’d agreed years ago that they would never proclaim such affection if it came about unless they were once again face to face.</p><p>Harry had immediately called Tony’s phone only to hear a disconnected tone.</p><p>“JARVIS?” Harry had asked, breath caught in his throat as panic began to creep up. The AI was usually good for conversation and he and Harry had become surprisingly close for human and computer. Tony had always complained that JARVIS had a soft spot for Harry and would actually refer to him as Hadrian rather than Mr Potter-Black.</p><p>“<em>Yes Hadrian?</em>” Was it just his imagination, or did JARVIS sound worried?</p><p>“Where is he? What happened?”</p><p>There was a pause and Harry thought he might throw up. “<em>Sir’s convoy has been attacked. I am currently unable to identify his location.</em>”</p><p>His next breath sounded a little closer to a sob. Unknown. Tony was <em>gone</em>. His convoy had been driving through enemy territory and had probably <em>been blown up</em>.</p><p>Harry took three proper breaths. He had three options. One, stay where he was and wait for news. Harry snorted semi hysterically at the very idea. Two, he could go to Afghanistan and find Tony himself. Three, he could fly to America and wait for Tony to come home. Because Tony wasn’t dead. Harry would know if he was dead.</p><p>Harry knew what he wanted to do. He wanted to get on the next plane to Afghanistan and scour the desert until Tony was safe. But his magic acted up at the very though, sending a deep wrong, wrong, <em>wrong </em>message rushing through him. As much as it hurt, as much as it made Harry want to rage and rant and <em>destroy</em>, Harry couldn’t ignore his magic.</p><p>“JARVIS, can you get me to Malibu?”</p><p> </p><p> </p>
