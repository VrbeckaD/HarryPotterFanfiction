  <strong>Prologue: June 1998</strong>
</p><p>Hermione, still struggling to wake up, was clinging to the remnants of the vivid dream she had been having. As the details slipped from her waking mind, she fought a feeling of panic that her whole life would fade to oblivion if she couldn’t remember something important. It had something to do with Ron. They were celebrating their wedding anniversary; only it wasn’t much of a celebration. Hermione was surprised by the strength of the feelings in her dream—resentment, anger, discontentment, and finally sadness.</p><p>She heard the soft bleat of a sheep somewhere in the distance. Surely that hadn’t been part of the dream. A cool breeze made her shiver, blowing away snatches of the conversation she’d been having with Ron. Hermione caught one sentence before it was gone.</p><p>“You can’t still be angry at me for being too sloshed on our wedding night to remember it!” shouted Ron. Had he been drunk on their wedding day? What an awful thing to imagine. There was light behind her eyelids now, and the last fragments of her dream evaporated in the warmth of the rising sun. How very strange.</p><p>As she struggled to open her eyes, Hermione noted a stiffness in her body that reminded her of the many times she’d fallen asleep pouring over her textbooks at Hogwarts. Had she fallen asleep at her desk again? Hermione could feel a breeze caressing her with icy fingertips and chided herself for leaving the window open. Her eyes fluttered open, and she was surprised to discover herself lying on a bed of lush grass at the foot of what looked to be an overgrown headstone. Hermione popped up to a sitting position, regretting it instantly as her head spun. Had she fallen asleep in a graveyard? What in Godric’s name was she doing there? Hermione’s rational mind took over, forcing her to look around and take in the details of her surroundings. She sighed with relief. She was not in a graveyard. She was, however, somewhere equally strange. Somehow, Hermione had fallen asleep in the ring of a vast stone circle.</p><p>She stood up to get a better view. Birds were chirping too merrily in some nearby trees, and Hermione shivered again. She opened her beaded bag and summoned a soft tartan blanket to wrap around her bare shoulders. Without the distraction of the cold, she could focus on a more pressing matter: where exactly was she? The stones, though tall, were shorter and further away from each other than Stonehenge. Cross that off the list. She could be in Cumbria—large circle, low stones. But then she spotted a smaller inner circle and beyond that a small village—built, it appeared, in the midst of the circle. Not Cumbria, after all. She’d have to walk into town to confirm, but she suspected she was in Avebury. She set off toward the village, hoping she could find a place to purchase a newspaper and maybe a bottle of water.</p><p> </p><p>She reached the village edge and stopped momentarily to stow the wool blanket in her bag—she certainly didn’t need anyone knowing she had slept in the open field. Hermione crossed a deserted car park and found herself on the main road of what appeared to be a quaint old village. To her left was a brick building with darkened windows. Beyond that, a copse of trees behind a low stone wall obscured her view of whatever structure lay sleeping in the chilly morning. To her right, a towering wall of trees revealed the edge of a red brick and stone building wearing a small wooden name tag—a farm of some sort by the looks of it. That wouldn’t do. She found what she was looking for across the street. A tall brick building bore a sign that simply read, “The Shop.” Surely they would have what she needed. She hurried across the street and ducked into the warm interior of the shop.</p><p>“Good morning, dear,” said an older muggle woman. The shopkeeper’s short gray hair and stylish accessories deterred Hermione from telling any half-truths, convinced they would be as transparent as the lenses on the shopkeeper’s smart emerald glasses. The less Hermione said, the better.</p><p>“Good morning,” Hermione replied politely. A cursory glance around the store revealed a local newspaper and a small cooler that did indeed have bottled water.</p><p>“You must be here for Avebury’s Midsummer’s Eve celebration,” said the shopkeeper. It wasn’t a question. “We have the largest stone circle in Britain, as I’m sure you know,” the shopkeeper continued. Hermione had a vision of herself wearing a floral wreath. How very unlike her, but she supposed she had been there— no point in denying it. In a small village like this, the locals were bound to know the comings and goings of every resident, reserving plenty of curiosity for the activities of outsiders.</p><p>“Yes. Lovely weather for it, too,” said Hermione remembering the warm summer sun on her skin as it sank slowly, slowly toward the horizon. The shopkeeper beamed with pride as though she were Mother Nature herself. Funny, these villagers. But kind all the same. Hermione smiled and paid for her items.</p><p>“Thank you, dear. Come back now.” the shopkeeper said.</p><p>"Goodbye," replied Hermione as she left the shop. She walked to the edge of the building and stopped to lean against an empty red telephone box. She shook the paper open and noted the date: June 22, 1998. It was the day after summer solstice. That’s right. She had wanted to visit on that day after reading something intriguing in a book about muggle folklore. What was it? It flitted through her mind like a feather in the wind. The headline on the front page read, “Local Woman Remembers Her Future and Other Midsummer’s Eve Faerie Stories.” Even Hermione, a witch who had used a time-turner in her third year at Hogwarts, laughed at the absurdity of this. It sounded much like divination, her least favorite subject—too fluffy and inaccurate. She folded the paper and swallowed a mouthful of water. She really must get home.</p><p>She walked past a lovely stone building—“The Henge Shop” the sign read—toward an opening to the field where the stones were scattered. In any other circumstance, she would have stopped to browse. It was the type of place that was bound to sell obscure books along with unique trinkets and, she’d wager, collections of gemstones polished to a high shine. Finally reaching a break to the open field, she sighed and made her way to a faraway stone behind which she could safely apparate home.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Hermione sighed in relief once in the warm confines of her house. Though if she was honest with herself, she frequently wished she'd had anywhere else to go than back to her empty family home. When familiar grief threatened to cripple her, a simple reminder that her parents were safer where they were until the last of the Death Eaters were locked away in Azkaban, forced her back to the practical reality of the present. Wards on the house would be enough to protect her—after all, they had kept her and Harry hidden even in the middle of the open woods during the Horcrux hunt. Hermione tried not to think about the others that could never be brought back. What she needed right now was a hot shower followed by a cup of tea and some ginger biscuits, and then, perhaps, a good cry.</p><p>She trudged upstairs, tossed the beaded bag on her bed, then made her way to the bathroom. While the water heated up, she undressed. She stood before the mirror over the sink to assess her appearance. Bits of grass and dandelion fuzz clung to the thicket of curls on her head—so much for no one knowing she had slept outdoors. She plucked the flora from her hair and smoothed down a rogue curl, rolling her eyes in reluctant permission of this small vanity.</p><p>Steam billowed around her and something in her hazy reflection caught the light. A quick wave of her wand cleared the fog from the mirror revealing a delicate gold chain around her neck. It was long enough that she could lift the ring on the end of the chain to examine it without unclasping the necklace. It was a lovely thing, this ring. Vintage. A single, and rather large, cushion cut emerald was tilted on its axis so that two of the rounded corners aligned with the band. The emerald was framed by a delicate diamond halo that looked like—there was no other way to describe them—leaves. It was set on a thin gold band she suspected would fit her finger perfectly. Wherever did this come from? She thought to remove it for her shower, but it felt too dear. Instead, she dropped the necklace, letting the ring settle over her heart, then stepped into the water.</p><p>There was nothing more relaxing than a hot shower. For a minute, Hermione just stood beneath the stream of water and let it wash away the memory of the ancient stones and the dream of her unhappy marriage to Ron. She began to lather herself with lavender soap, not bothering to use the loofah that hung nearby. She closed her eyes and ran her hands from her neck to her torso passing over her breasts, across her midsection, and continuing to her hips. Hands washed lazily down one thigh to the delicate bones of her ankle.</p><p>Eyes closed, she let her mind drift unanchoring from the pain and stiffness that was slowly dissipating. Wouldn't it be luxurious to have someone else wash her? Hands moved from one ankle to the other. She could imagine someone else’s hands brushing over her calf, circling her thigh, then roaming teasingly over the soft thatch of hair between her legs before continuing upward. A tingling sensation began to spread from her core. Hands grazed her breasts, nipples rising in their wake. And before she knew what was happening, she was pulled into an embrace.</p><p>Lips crushed against hers, teeth grazing her lower lip, tongue forcing her mouth open. She leaned into the hard planes of a man in obvious want of her, losing herself to his touch.</p><p>When she finally pulled away, she looked up at a pair of steely grey eyes boring into her with a look of desire so intense it almost knocked her off her feet. She gasped and the vision dispersed in a puff of steam. Her heart hammered in her chest. What just happened? Was it a hallucination? A dream? She didn’t care, she wanted more. But it was gone.</p><p>She choked down the surge of disappointment filling the empty shower. Shock and acute loneliness fell in warm rivulets down her face. Her sex still throbbed. Without deciding to do it, her hand felt its way toward release, pleasure ripping through her almost the moment fingers parted her swollen lips. As she broke apart, a long-suppressed truth escaped its rationalized prison and settled in her blissfully quiet mind: she had long wondered what could have been if she had met Draco Malfoy under different circumstances.</p>
