    <p>A loud crack split the silent evening.</p><p> </p><p>Anna Ravenshire gazed around the dark woods. In the near distance, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry perched on the forested hillside; its many windows glowing in the dusk, reflections glittering on the surface of the Black Lake.</p><p> </p><p>She began her trek up to the castle. She could have Apparated into Hogsmeade Village and taken a carriage – it certainly would have been smoother sailing, especially with the books she was carrying – but she was pressed for time and did not wish to draw attention to herself.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>An Auror, at Hogwarts?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Fudge would not approve.</p><p> </p><p>The walk up through the woods, past the gamekeeper’s house and across the Wooden Bridge took longer than she remembered it. Then again, Anna had never worn heeled boots as a student. By the time she crossed the courtyard and entered the castle gates, dinner was underway in the Great Hall and the smell of roast lamb wafted through the open doors, knotting her empty stomach.</p><p> </p><p>After glancing into the noisy, brightly-lit room to see if she might spot him at the staff table, Anna turned and headed towards Albus Dumbledore's office. Thankfully, those who weren’t at dinner payed her no attention as she strode up the shifting stairs and down the familiar corridors. Maybe they thought she was another student in her dark robes, with a stack of old books shoved beneath her arm.</p><p> </p><p>In fact, Anna had graduated from Hogwarts over seven years ago.</p><p> </p><p>Ravenclaw Tower called to her as she passed its arched entrance, and she desperately wanted to answer. Was it still the same? Light and airy and…blue.  There was no time to linger and find out, nor seek after her young cousin currently attending the school.</p><p> </p><p>Anna turned down Gargoyle Corridor on the third floor and made for the looming statue at the end. "Liquorice Snaps," she muttered to the gargoyle, and the stone stairs carried her up to the landing outside Dumbledore's office. She knocked thrice on the door.</p><p> </p><p>"Come in," Dumbledore’s sage voice replied promptly, louder than it ought to be travelling through the heavy wood. Voice amplification, most likely.</p><p> </p><p>Anna pressed in and closed the door behind her. She looked around. The office was the same as she remembered. Circular, the walls lined with old portraits of past headmasters. The main foyer – filled with its cabinets and mysterious, shiny trinkets – was currently dark, but a lamp was glowing in the smaller room behind it. Dumbledore was sitting at his desk, pouring a cup of tea. Fawkes was perched on the high back of his seat.</p><p> </p><p>"Ah, Miss Ravenshire, what a surprise," Dumbledore smiled, though it lacked its usual cheeriness.</p><p> </p><p>Anna knew that current times at Hogwarts were tense.  </p><p> </p><p>"I was just having a spot of supper," Dumbledore continued, waving to a silver tea tray. "Would you care to join me?"   </p><p> </p><p>Anna approached the desk, her boots clicking sharply on the stone floor. "I'm sorry for intruding, professor. I need to speak with you urgently." </p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore gestured for her to sit. She did, and the seat was more comfortable than its leather exterior would suggest. A few of the portraits on the walls were snoozing, others were empty altogether. </p><p> </p><p>"I see you've brought me a gift," Dumbledore said, putting down his tea cup and peering over his spectacles at the books Anna was placing on the desk. </p><p> </p><p>"Only if you want to read Constellier's Five Volumes on the Subtle Art of Divination," Anna patted the stack of tomes. "I'm returning them to Professor Trelawny. It was the only way I could get permission from the Ministry to visit Hogwarts." </p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore fixed Anna with a keen stare. "Cornelius wouldn't be worried about insubordination, now would he?" </p><p> </p><p>Anna sighed. "Fudge is worried about everything, these days. The Aurors' loyalty ranks just below his own credibility."</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore chuckled to himself. "You didn't let charming Professor Umbridge see you?" </p><p> </p><p>“No. But I thought I smelt her perfume lingering around the Greenhouses on the way up. Is she meddling where she shouldn't be?" </p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore leaned back in his seat. "If it keeps Dolores happy, Hogwarts can tolerate a bit of meddling." </p><p> </p><p>A few musical notes came from Fawkes, as though the phoenix was agreeing.</p><p> </p><p>"What is this urgent matter you speak of?" Dumbledore asked, reaching up to stroke the bird’s golden feathers.</p><p> </p><p>Anna took a breath. "It's about Julius Oliverston. He's going to reveal the location of the Order to Fudge." </p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore lowered his hand, a stern frown hardening his wizened brow. "And how do you know this?"</p><p> </p><p>Anna reached into her robes and retrieved a creased piece of plum-coloured parchment. She handed it across the desk to Dumbledore. "When we met to exchange information this week, I could tell he was worried, nervous. And I could sense an impending betrayal in his aura." </p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore frowned. Anna knew that he had never considered divination to be a particularly credible form of magic, but she had always had a penchant for it.</p><p> </p><p>"So, yesterday at the Ministry I intercepted Oliverston's memo to Fudge, and as you can see..."</p><p> </p><p>Anna let Dumbledore read the message.</p><p> </p><p>"I do see," he said solemnly when he finished. He placed the letter before him.</p><p> </p><p>Anna watched a sadness bloom in Dumbledore's blue eyes. Oliverston had been a member of the Order of the Phoenix since its origins, and she would have bet any number of galleons on the current political climate being the cause for his change of heart.</p><p> </p><p>Anna continued carefully. "He's meeting Fudge tomorrow, and I had to tell you before I did something to try and stop it."</p><p> </p><p>"And I thank you," Dumbledore replied. "Because I know for a fact that Oliverston is currently at a meeting at headquarters."</p><p> </p><p>"What should be done?" Anna asked carefully.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore thought quietly for a minute. Fawkes sung another few notes, but they seemed melancholy now.</p><p> </p><p>"Have you yet been to headquarters?" Dumbledore asked eventually.</p><p> </p><p>"Not since it’s moved to Grimmauld Place."</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore raised his brows at her. “That’s been almost a year.”</p><p> </p><p>Anna raised a brow of her own. “And you’re implying…”</p><p> </p><p>He chuckled. "Nothing at all, but I'm going to send you there now via Floo, and I would be grateful if you would send back Oliverston. Tell him I wish to speak with him."</p><p> </p><p>"Wont that seem suspicious?" Anna asked.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore considered. "Perhaps send one of the others with him...Shacklebolt, or Diggle."</p><p> </p><p>Anna nodded. "I can do that, but is Floo the way to go? The Ministry is keeping them under tabs. They'll know I was in your office."</p><p> </p><p>"Alas," Dumbledore replied, "mine is not traceable."</p><p> </p><p><em>Yet</em>, Anna thought.</p><p> </p><p>"In the meantime, continue your Auror duties for the Ministry," Dumbledore said.</p><p> </p><p>Anna would be. She was working on a particularly tough case at the moment, keeping her so busy she'd barely had the spare time to come to Hogwarts in person. But meeting face-to-face was safer than sending messages, these days.</p><p> </p><p>"And feel free to visit for a cup of tea whenever you like," Dumbledore continued. "Perhaps via headquarters' Floo. I'm sure Sirius will oblige. Simpler than having to keep borrowing books."</p><p> </p><p>Anna smiled. "Of course, though I wouldn't stop by without information. I imagine you're too busy for social calls."</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore stood from his seat. "Miss Ravenshire, no matter how busy a person is, if they are a true friend then they will always have the time for you. And I happen to dearly enjoy social calls. A good excuse to break out the shortbread."</p><p> </p><p>Anna would have smiled, but the way Dumbledore said it made it sound like he didn't fully believe his own words. She followed him to his fireplace across the room. Floo was not her favourite way to travel – her stomach didn’t care for it, and the ash always blemished her fair skin – but desperate times called for desperate measures.</p><p> </p><p>"Give my best to the Order," Dumbledore farewelled. "And tell Molly not to worry too much."</p><p> </p><p>Anna nodded and stepped into the fireplace, <em>12 Grimmauld Place</em> on her lips. She vanished in a whirl of green flame.</p><p> </p><p align="center">~~O~~</p><p align="center"> </p><p>"Goodness!" cried a startled Molly Weasley.</p><p> </p><p>Anna gained her balance by gripping the edges of the fireplace. She had emerged from the Floo network at the end of a long, narrow kitchen, stuffed to its stone walls with a wooden table and various mismatched seats.</p><p> </p><p>Occupying those seats were some twenty members of the Order, all surprised to see her breathing heavily in the fireplace. Anna immediately spotted Oliverston sitting halfway down the table between a grim Alastor Moody and a pink-haired Nymphadora Tonks.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, Anna, it's you," Molly recognised her, catching her breath. She had been sitting nearest the fireplace and had leapt out of her chair. She now stood with a hand pressed to her heart.</p><p> </p><p>"Sorry, Molly," Anna greeted her, stepping out of the fireplace a bit wobblily.</p><p> </p><p>"Not to worry, dear," Molly chuckled heartily, coming forward to brush soot off Anna's robes. </p><p> </p><p>The unfamiliar kitchen was warm, and smelt like butterbeer and burnt toast. Anna suspected Tonks must have gotten to the blackened loaf of bread sitting on the sideboard before Molly could. Bottles and plates were scattered along the table, and a steaming cauldron sat on a burner at the end.</p><p> </p><p>"Dumbledore sent you, did he?" Arthur Weasley asked cheerily from his place next to a good-looking young man with red hair – most likely one of his older sons.</p><p> </p><p>"He did," Anna sought out Shacklebolt, whose long robes were an outlandish shade of royal purple. "Dumbledore wishes to see you, Kingsley. Julius, you too."</p><p> </p><p>Oliverston straightened in his seat, looking very unkempt, circles beneath his eyes. "Dumbledore wants to see me?"</p><p> </p><p>Molly finished brushing Anna down and ushered her to sit, but Anna remained standing.</p><p> </p><p>"It's quite urgent," she continued to Shacklebolt. "He's waiting."</p><p> </p><p>"Of course," Shacklebolt replied in his deep voice. "Did he say what was wrong?"</p><p> </p><p>Oliverston was looking nervous, fiddling with a butterbeer cork.</p><p> </p><p>"No, he did not," Anna said, but she gave a subtle glance towards Oliverston. <em>It concerns him.</em></p><p> </p><p>If Shacklebolt caught on, he didn't show it. Everyone else at the table waited silently.</p><p> </p><p>"We'll go now," Shacklebolt stood up from the table and pulled on his matching purple hat. "Come, Julius."</p><p> </p><p>Oliverston followed, looking rather reluctant, squeezing past Alastor and Lupin to get to the fireplace. They disappeared together in the green flame.</p><p> </p><p>Anna let out a breath, the lingering taste of smoke in her mouth. She sat down in the chair Molly had offered, reaching up to pat down a stray strand of her ebony-tinted hair.</p><p> </p><p>"Everything okay, Anna?" Tonks asked into the following quiet.</p><p> </p><p>Anna could see they were all waiting for a proper explanation. She looked around, meeting several of the curious gazes upon her.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Here it goes.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>"Oliverston was ready to expose the Order to the Ministry,” she announced. “Tomorrow, in fact."</p><p> </p><p>Everyone went rigid and opened their mouths, but Anna continued.</p><p> </p><p>"I intercepted a message of his to Fudge. It said he had information on Dumbledore's secret society he wanted to divulge – for a reward."</p><p> </p><p>Molly gasped.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you certain?" Alastor growled immediately. </p><p> </p><p>Anna nodded. "Yes. I’ve just informed Dumbledore."</p><p> </p><p>Molly sank into a chair, and there were more displays of disbelief – the shaking of heads, a muttered <em>"impossible".</em></p><p> </p><p>"I can't believe it," Lupin spoke up, his voice hoarse from the many nights he spent howling as a werewolf. "Oliverston's been a loyal member of the Order for over twenty years."</p><p> </p><p>The dark-haired man that was lounging across from Lupin scoffed loudly, silencing everyone else at the table, and Anna got the sense he had a certain scepticism when it came to loyalty.</p><p> </p><p>"Come now, Remus,” he said. “Oliverston was cowering all evening. I would have confronted him myself if Miss..."</p><p> </p><p>"Ravenshire," Molly muttered absently.</p><p> </p><p>"If Miss Ravenshire hadn't arrived," he finished.</p><p> </p><p>Anna knew who he was. Two years ago, his face had been in every newspaper, on every bulletin board in the Ministry of Magic and Diagon Alley, snarling at the reader.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius Black.</p><p> </p><p>Innocent of the crimes of betraying James and Lily Potter to Voldemort, and killing twelve Muggles. Now in hiding from the magical world, confined to this safe house, waiting for his name to be cleared. Anna had her doubts it ever would be, especially after being used as a scapegoat by the Ministry for the numerous disappearances in recent months.</p><p> </p><p>"Oliverston <em>was</em> acting strangely," Tonks agreed with Black, looking around at Lupin. Her hair had darkened to a magenta.</p><p> </p><p>Alastor didn't look convinced. He continued to stare at Anna with his magical eye. "And you just thought to go through his messages, did you?"</p><p> </p><p>"Alastor," Molly scowled.</p><p> </p><p>Anna barely restrained an eyeroll. Typical Mad-Eye. "I got a feel of his aura, and it wasn't particularly honourable, so I did some investigating. You know...<em>my job</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Alastor growled something to himself.</p><p> </p><p>"What was that?" Tonks asked pointedly, leaning an arm on the table and raising a sharp eyebrow at him. </p><p> </p><p>Anna smirked.</p><p> </p><p>"Reading auras and...<em> vibes</em>...I wouldn't trust Ravenshire and her divination," Alastor said.</p><p> </p><p>Anna's smile disappeared. "Go and see Dumbledore if you must, Moody. I left Oliverston's letter with him. But I thought you would trust me after all these years."</p><p> </p><p>Alastor didn't reply, just growled some more. Everyone seemed a bit uncomfortable now, many still shocked into silence.</p><p> </p><p>"I should be going," Anna stated shortly, standing from her seat.</p><p> </p><p>Molly rose too. "Now, now, Anna. It's late. Wont you stay the night?"</p><p> </p><p>Anna shook her head. "I've a job to do."</p><p> </p><p>Several members of the Order mumbled brief goodbyes. Arthur Weasley leaned in to talk with Lupin and Black.</p><p> </p><p>Molly led Anna out into a dark hallway even narrower than the kitchen, and Tonks followed behind them, tripping through the doorway.</p><p> </p><p>"This is headquarters now?" Anna muttered to Tonks, looking around. A black wood staircase loomed beside her, rising up indeterminable storeys. Faded portraits lined the walls, several of them covered with dusty sheets.</p><p> </p><p>Tonks smirked. "Lavish, isn't it?”</p><p> </p><p>Anna let out a dark laugh.</p><p> </p><p>"It just needs a good renovation, I keep telling Sirius," Molly said, patting a bit of decaying wallpaper.</p><p> </p><p>At the front door, Anna was given the password that would let her enter 12 Grimmauld Place if she ever needed a safe house.</p><p> </p><p>"But it changes often," Tonks told her. "So don't be a stranger. We're all here a lot of the evenings."</p><p> </p><p>"Sure. Are you working the Helvar case?"</p><p> </p><p>Tonks shook her head, her hair randomly turning violet. "No. I'm technically on Gregarious', though I think Scrimgeour is getting suspicious of where I get to most days."</p><p> </p><p>Tonks had always spent more time on direct missions for the Order, whereas Anna tried to assist them while working from within the Ministry. She had known Tonks at Hogwarts, a Hufflepuff one year her junior. They hadn’t been best friends, but were always civil, and since then they had both become Aurors.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, I might see you around the Ministry," Anna said.</p><p> </p><p>"Or here," Tonks reiterated.</p><p> </p><p>Molly gave Anna a firm hug, even though they weren’t that well acquainted. That was just who Mrs Weasley was.</p><p> </p><p>Anna felt the familiar swell of sadness, but pushed away the memory of another person like Molly Weasley that she had known.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Not now.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry you had to find out about Oliverston," Molly said sadly, squeezing Anna's arms.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, it's a good thing I did or otherwise this place would have been stormed tomorrow."</p><p> </p><p>"And Sirius would be back in Azkaban," Tonks added. She fiddled with the cuff of her fingerless glove. “I wonder what Dumbledore will do?”</p><p> </p><p>“Convince the poor man to change his mind,” Molly said with somewhat forced assuredness. “Nothing else he can do.”</p><p> </p><p>Anna turned to leave. Outside, late-night London was drizzly, and she pulled up the hood on her robes as she made her way down the steps. She was headed for the Ministry.</p><p> </p><p>"Anna," Molly called after her.</p><p> </p><p>Anna looked back to see them standing in the doorway. "Yes?"</p><p> </p><p>"Did you happen to see Ginny or Ron, or the twins at Hogwarts...by any chance?"</p><p> </p><p>There was a distinct note of concern in Molly's voice, and Anna remembered what Dumbledore had said about her worrying.</p><p> </p><p>She nodded. "I did, in fact. They were at the Gryffindor table."</p><p> </p><p>Anna didn't feel bad for lying, especially when she saw the relief in Molly's smile.</p><p> </p><p>"If we don't see you before, please stop by for Christmas," Molly said. "We'll all be here."</p><p> </p><p>It was early October now. Christmas still felt a long way away.</p><p> </p><p>Anna nodded briefly, then Disapparated.</p>
