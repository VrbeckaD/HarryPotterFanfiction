    <p>“Surely you’re joking,” King Lucius said through clenched teeth, gripping his throne furiously.  <br/>King James of Gryffindoria merely smiled, he had been visiting the Kingdom of Sly for the past fortnight in the hopes of bringing him on board to aid Sly in its war against Tom Riddle, the Dark Prince of an adjacent kingdom. Sly’s armies had been depleted by the Dark Prince and King Lucius was losing ground fast.  <br/>“Your kingdom is in dire need of soldiers is it not your grace?” King James asked with a deliciously wicked smirk.  <br/>The King glared, “It is,” he replied.  <br/>“Then I see no reason to refuse my offer. It is more than generous I should think,” King James replied.  <br/>King Lucius bared his teeth, tightening his hold on his throne, “Very well,” he said. He could ill-afford to refuse the King’s offer. “I shall present your offer to the Prince, though I cannot promise he will be pleased.”  <br/>King James smirked, he knew well the young prince’s tantrums. They were notorious across the five kingdoms, and he had seen them first hand in his time in Sly. It had been thrilling to witness up close and personal, and the King knew he was more than happy to tame the bratty prince if necessary.  </p><p align="center">* </p><p><br/>The Prince of Sly, Draco, was laying in a bath of milk and oils, enjoying his leisure afternoon when there was a knock on his bedroom door. Draco glared, ignoring it. Everyone in the kingdom knew better than to interrupt him during his bath.  <br/>“Draco?” his father’s voice rang out. Draco growled, standing up from the tub, warm milky water cascading down his pale flesh. Furious, he pulled on his robe of finest silk and crossed from the tub into the bedroom and answered the door.  <br/>“Father,” he replied, glaring at the King. For his part, the King looked sorry to have bothered his son, and frowned, as he stepped into his room. “I trust you have an important reason for disturbing my bath,” he said.  <br/>“Yes, I’m afraid I do,” his father replied. “Our guest has offered to aid us in our fight against the Dark Prince.”  <br/>“Excellent,” Draco replied. “Though I do not see what this has to do with…”  <br/>“For a price,” the King explained. Draco folded his arms across his chest, waiting. “He wishes to take your hand in marriage.”  <br/>At this, Draco laughed, “What?”  <br/>The King sighed, “I’m afraid so,” he said. “He was quite adamant.”  <br/>“Surely you don’t expect me to actually do such a thing!” Draco snapped. The King frowned, not meeting his son’s eye. “Father? You can’t expect me to…”  <br/>“We’re out of options,” the King said, firmly. “King James is our last hope.”  <br/>“But…”  <br/>“He will make a fine husband,” his father said.  <br/>Draco glared, “I won’t go through with this!”  <br/>“You will!” the King yelled. “You are no child, boy! I have suffered enough of your insolence. The moment you presented as an Omega you lost all rights to make your own decisions!” Draco stared at his father, aghast. The moment the words left his lips, he regretted them. King Lucius sighed, “If there were any other way,” he said.  <br/>Draco glared at his father. “Get out,” he hissed.  <br/>“Draco please…”  <br/>“Get. OUT!” he yelled.  <br/>The King turned on his heel, and left the room without another word, leaving his son alone. <br/>Draco had always known it would come to this. Loathe though he was to admit it, he had always known it would only be a matter of time before his Omega status was used against him. Pursing his lips, Draco looked around his room, in search of an escape route. Perhaps if he vanished, the King would forget about him, and he could find his way somewhere else. Somewhere where he wouldn't be made to be a whore for some ruthless alpha. </p><p>King James was an alpha, Draco had smelled it on him the moment he had stepped foot onto Sly soil. But he would not be <em>his</em> alpha, he determined, making his way over to his window, staring down at the land below. His father had long since dismantled the tree which Draco had used to escape during his youth, making it significantly more difficult. Of course, his father had neglected to remove Draco's bedclothes which he could easily tie together to form a rope with which he could plot his escape. <br/>"Going somewhere?" said a voice from behind him. Draco nearly leaped out of his skin as he turned to find King James standing behind him. It shouldn't have been possible for him to sneak into Draco's room unnoticed, he thought, eying the King, distrusting. King James merely smirked. <br/>"How did you get in here?" <br/>King James merely smiled, "Draco," he tried, stepping closer to him. Draco glared, and the King held up his hands in defense. "Your highness," he tried. "I believe we got off on the wrong foot earlier." <br/>At this Draco snorted, "You dare demand me in exchange for aiding my land?" he growled. <br/>"Not a demand," King James replied. "A request." <br/>"Why?" <br/>"Because you are the most beautiful Prince in…" <br/>"Spare me!" Draco spat, his arms folded across his chest in a defiant stance. "I know what you are." <br/>King James nodded, "I see." <br/>"I will not be some sex slave for you," he growled. <br/>The King's smile fell at that, "I would never ask that of you," he replied. "I merely wish for you to rule alongside me." Draco snorted, he didn't believe it for a moment. "I mean it," he said. "You may be an Omega, but I confess, your fiery attitude is quite alluring." <br/>"You will never bring me to heel," Draco growled. <br/>King James smiled, "Nor would I wish to try," he replied simply. "Why do you think I have withheld my scent from you? Because I wish you to come to me willingly. Not because your Omega instincts command it." Draco sighed. "I give you my solemn vow Prince Draco, I will not ask anything of you after we are wed. You are free to come and go in my Kingdom as you please." <br/>"Why would you allow such a thing?" Draco asked. <br/>The King smiled, "I do not wish to have a lover who is unwilling," he commented simply. <br/>"And if I am never willing?" Draco asked. <br/>The King merely shrugged, "Then so be it." <br/>Draco considered this, he supposed he had nothing to lose then. "Very well," he said. "But I promise you this King James," he said approaching. "If you go back on your word, I will not hesitate in beheading you." <br/>King James grinned, holding out his hand for the Prince, "I wouldn't have it any other way," he said. Draco took his hand and shook it, and just like that the arrangement was set.</p><hr/><p>If you like this and would like to read more work by me, consider my original novel The Secret Life of Damien Carmichael <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wattpad.com%2Fuser%2FNarcissaDeville&amp;t=YjdlMzBiNGRmODc5MzFjMTIyZTM3NzdlODFiODkxNjk5ZjZkN2NjNSxmMTVmMGQ1MTY2M2IwMjFkN2NlYTczNmZlMWNmN2JhNWE1Y2ZmZjQz" rel="nofollow">New scenes/chapters posted Tuesdays/Fridays only at Wattpad.</a></p><p>Follow me elsewhere on the web: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fnarcissadeville&amp;t=M2IyYTk0OTFlNWM2OTlhNTgwYjYzMDhlN2Q5Y2EzOTk1N2JhZDFiNiwwN2QzMjhiMDIzMmU4MzBlZjdkNTQyYmVmYmE2ZTc2ZTg3MTA1ZGE5" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fnarcissadeville&amp;t=YjZkMjgyY2U2ZGRmNDNkZmYwYzgxOWIxMDkxYjZlZWIxMmNlZGZlZixjODZlYjY3ZWM3NTlkM2M4ZjZhODU2YTljYTUxNDNjNDFkMzgxNTY2" rel="nofollow">Instagram</a> | <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fchannel%2FUCBlpPJBf7OHzsHZBGG7A7zQ%2Fvideos%3Fview_as%3Dsubscriber&amp;t=MTU5ODg3ZTZlYTE3Mjg0Yzc3ODViNjY5YjliYjRhOTcwZDNkYTZjMSxhNmI0MDZjNDdmMWY5ZGY5ZjRhMDcyNWMxZDA5ZWM4Zjk3NWI1YTU5" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a></p>
