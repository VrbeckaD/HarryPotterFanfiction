    <p>Draco was once again, lost in Harry Potter. </p>
<p>He’d stay lost every day of his life if he could, admiring him from distance, without ever touching him, trying to not acknowledge the fuzzy feeling he had on the pit of his stomach when he looked at him. Deep green eyes, messy hair, stupid dimples, white teeth, those are real things about Harry Potter, those are facts. And Draco Malfoy is known for ignoring facts.</p>
<p>The fact that Potter is powerful, greater than he is.</p>
<p>The fact that Potter is alive.</p>
<p>And the fact that Draco Malfoy is hopelessly in love with him.</p>
<p>There’s the operative word, “hopeless” because Draco Malfoy is a mess, he is a menace, he is the bad guy of the story, has been since he was three and his mother died and he lost almost all of the only affection he ever knew, since the expectations on him grew heavier and heavier together with the guilt for becoming the monster that he is now. And because Harry Potter is everything he isn’t, he’s good, he’s kind, he’s like the sun.</p>
<p>And Draco’s crashing into him, it’s inevitable. It will probably end in flames.</p>
<p>Potter’s laughter becomes louder, even from where Draco is sitting, at the border of the forest, close enough to hear the nymphs’ laughter and the dryads’ singing. Potter’s laughter becomes louder and louder until it echoes in his ears and seems to infiltrate into his heart, suddenly Draco itches for a cigarette, feels the deep, crawling need for the smoking filling his lungs. He fishes the pack out of his pockets and it’s instantly snatched out of his hands.</p>
<p>“Are you fucking kidding me?” Is the only thing that leaves his lips, he’s sick, he’s tired and he just wants to smoke a little, to feel the smoke and forget about the boy with chocolate hair and stupid scar that is now having fun with Weasley and Granger. But Cass, the fucking fucker, is holding his cigs against herself and neither Pansy nor Blaise do make any moves to help him, either. He hates them. He hates all of them with a passion.</p>
<p>Except he doesn’t.</p>
<p>“You’re fucking flammable, you idiot.” Cassandra hiss, tucking his cigarettes safely in her own jacket. He hates her, he wants to scream and he wants to jinx her, wants to punch a tree and scream at the birds that are happily chirping on its branches unaware of hi inner turmoil, happily chirping while he wants to cry, but that means he’ll make the nymphs upset and they actually like him for some forsaken reason, he might as well not change that.</p>
<p>“Stop making that face and take deep breaths, asshole,” Blaise says with his deep, soothing voice that normally works wonders on any of them, he’s trying to do his homework, a quick look in the pages says it’s greek. He follows the advice and takes deep breaths, feels Cass’ hands grabbing his and Pansy’s fingers making their way through his hair, Blaise is humming softly and soothingly, Draco focus on it. On the deep tone of his friend’s humming and the birds chirping happily on the trees, on the dryads’ happy singing and splashing, on the wind coming through the leaves and branches, on the sunlight that makes it way through the leaves and warms him to the bones. </p>
<p>The fight is still inside him, as it always is, pulsing, mixed with the anger and the guilt and the sadness.</p>
<p>It’s always there.</p>
<p>It never leaves.</p>
<p>It only gets worse and worse, building itself against his lungs and unraveling like flowers, taking up so much space that sometimes he feels like he can’t breathe properly, like it will come up and up on his throat and suffocate him to his death.</p>
<p>But it won’t manifest itself now, he won’t let it.</p>
<p>He’ll breathe deep and drown the fight and the bad feelings with fresh air and ignore the fact that it’s there.</p>
<p>He is good at ignoring facts.</p>
<p>His breath evens and he lays on the ground, he hears the sound the grass makes when he accommodates his hair and he feels more than he hears the collective sigh of relief coming out of his friends’ mouths. </p>
<p>“I’m sorry.” He says, as quiet as the wind that rushes around them, he feels a squeeze from where Cass’ hand is on his ankle, Pansy’s feet nudge his tighs now that his hair is far away from her fingers and Blaise’s humming grows even softer, it all tells him that they heard it, that they’re still with him. That they won’t leave him.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>He couldn’t afford to be alone again.</p>
