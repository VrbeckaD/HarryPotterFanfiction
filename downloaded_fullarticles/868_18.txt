    <p>The moonlight shinned bright over the clearing that the Nemeton, now a flourishing tree, resides. Branches overhang in the clearing, creating a mass of dancing shadows as the branches swayed in the cool breezy night. From the shadows stepped out a hooded figure in a red hooded sweatshirt. The shadows clung to the figure momentarily, before gradually slipping free, like one would shake water off, as they stepped into the dim silvery light of the moon.</p><p>“You went far and wide to get me here, Mieczysław,” a female figure voice spoke from the other side of the clearing. This figure was shadowed in an emerald green cloak. Her voice husky and lit with a soft accent, that rang like a melody in the quiet of the clearing. “Why would one such as yourself, have need for me?” She asked curiously. Black leather boots were quiet against the floor as she meandered slowly around the tree, until she was faced with Mieczysław Stilinski.</p><p>Mieczysław “Stiles” Stilinski lowered the hood covering his face, permitting the other to finally see his features. Amber brown eyes glowed with an inner power, making it appear as if sparks of gold danced in his eyes. His pale skin was near sickly, washed out with a tiredness that belated an age he wasn’t. He stood unnaturally still and stiff, as if barely holding himself together as his beautiful eyes stared at the woman across from him.</p><p>“I have reason to believe you already know, Enchantress,” Stiles replies with thin lips as he connected eyes with the shadows of the High Witch across from him. “I need your help and you’re the only one who can help me,” he said with a regretful undertone to his voice. If he could, he’d have never summoned her. He would have left her to have her peace in the afterlife, but he had no other choice. She was the only one with enough power, strength, and connection to those he wanted to help and save, to pull this off.  </p><p>“Yes, you used Dark and Old magic to get me here,” the Enchantress replied. She had been banned from appearing before him once, when he had first tried to summon her. It wasn’t until she was able to give him a little nudge in the right direction, that she could appear before him, as she had now.</p><p>The Enchantress raised her pale creamy hands up to the hood covering her head. With a soft grip on the rims, she lowered it and finally allowed the younger man to see the beautiful visage that had been hidden beneath the green cloaks hood. Creamy pale skin appeared to glow in the dim moonlight. Her hair was the color of the deepest black and fell in ringlet curls around her face and to her shoulders. Brilliant emerald green eyes stared from beneath thick black eyelashes that enhanced the beautiful greens in her eyes. There was a casual elegance and beauty about the witch before Stiles, that caught numerous male and females alike, attention.</p><p>Stiles could see why Peter had fallen so hard for his wife: Hartleigh Juniper Hale nee Potter-Black. Not only was she beautiful, but she was powerful, strong, intelligent, compassionate, fierce, and numerous other descriptors. From the minimum that Derek and Peter have ever spoken about their family, whenever Hartleigh “Harley” Hale was brought into conversation, it was with difficulty and mainly good things to be said about her. She had died with the other Hales, having been burned alive like the rest of their family. The stories of that night, that the remaining Hales who had survived and been in the house had said, Harley had attempted to save the children with Peter. In the end, she had only succeeded in saving four members of their family, at the sake of her own life.</p><p>Only Peter, Laura, Derek, Jackson, Malia, and Cora survived the fire. From what he had learned overtime growing up, from the stories he’d been told and gossip heard through town, Jackson had been taken in by the Whittemore's to live with them. He’d been twelve-years-old at the time of the fire in the fall of 2006, and already a partial orphan. His mother had died in the fire trying to save the rest of the Hales, while his father was comatose due to the severity of his injuries. No one else had been willing to take him in. Not a child damaged from such traumatizing experiences, except for Hermione Whittemore nee Granger, wife of David Whittemore, and best friend to Harley Hale nee Potter-Black.</p><p>Malia had been taken in by the Tate’s, as Evelyn Tate nee Prewitt had also been a friend of Harley. Malia had also been in the same boat as her brother, Jackson. No one had wanted to take in the partial orphan who had been through a traumatic incident that left the eleven-year-old a mess of emotions and nightmares. That wasn’t to say the siblings never got to see each other, but they were forced to endure counseling for what they had been through.  </p><p>The Hale's, and all extended family, had been a large family. Following the Hale House Fire, which had killed fifteen members of the Hale's, only six Hale's remained. Over a six year time-span, the rest of Hale's, extended and immediate family, had been hunted down by Hunters associated with Kate Argent. Stiles could understand Peter losing his mind, once it was explained to him by the remaining Hale's, that over six years, they felt the death's of each of their pack-mates. The snaps of those bonds caused excruciating pain. Peter was already dealing with the physical pain of burn scars, on top of being catatonic and watching some his youngest children and wife burn to death, so feeling the continuous snaps of bonds drove him insane.   </p><p>“You desire to change what has come to pass,” Harley mused with a sad smile gracing her pink plush lips. “It comes at a great cost, Mieczysław,” she warned with green eyes turning dark as she stared into amber gold. “Are you prepared for those consequences?” She asked rhetorically. “You will be the focus of the spell, to allow us to break the boundaries of past, present, and future.” The once breezy wind began to strengthen as it become fierce, as if understanding what Harley was speaking of.</p><p>“To break the very fabric of time, is a daunting and dangerous thing indeed.” A smile grew across her lips again, and then she chuckled in amusement at the stubborn expression on his face. He was so much like his mother, Claudia. Mieczysław had such a willingness, strength, and power swirling within him to try and save her family and those he considered his family. A warm and regretful expression graced her beautiful features as she considered the young man before her. He had no idea what the consequences for his actions were going to be. She only hoped he was strong enough to endure it.</p><p>“I’m prepared. As prepared as I can be with what I want to do. I’ve gained all the information I could to prepare myself,” Stiles said as he nervously rubbed his hands. He held his body at an angle as he fought against the growing wind speed. The trees surrounding him rustled their leaves and howled in his ears. It was as if someone or something already knew what they were about to do.</p><p>“So be it,” Harley states. It held an ironclad finalization to it. A ringing beneath her voice that deemed it final.</p><p>With abrupt movements, Stiles quickly set out the objects that were needed for the ritual. The candles, herbs, pentagram, chalice, and many other things were laid out in a particular manner. With quiet footsteps, Harley came to a stop on the other side of the ritual circle. Her green eyes scanned over the young man across from her again, taking him in. He had grown so much since she had last seen him. He’d been a mere child, compared to the young adult he was now. Raising her arms, pale hands gripped lightly tanned hands in a tight grip as they connected eyes. Without a word, the duo began to speak in unison:</p><p align="center">“<em>Hear these words, hear the rhyme </em></p><p align="center">
  <em> Heed the hope within my mind </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Send me back to where I'll find </em>
</p><p align="center"><em> What I wish in place and time</em>”</p><p>Their voices echoed in the Nemeton clearing as they continued to chant the spell. The wind howled fiercely in the air. Their will, desire, and power erupted out around them like a hurricane connected to land. The candles flared to life at knee height as the flames flickered brightly in the night. There was a strong pressure building as the pair continued to chant. They both thought about where in time they wished Stiles to arrive back in time. He was their only hope to have a better future.</p><p>Stiles could feel the world around him beginning to spin out of control. It was a blur like one would experience at a Carnival or fair. When on one of those star ship rides that spun so quickly one couldn’t help but squeeze their eyes shut until it was over. Stiles squeezed his eyes close as he fought the nausea making his own stomach twirl.</p><p>Harley’s hair dances around her head and her green eyes glowed in the moonlight as she used her powers to assist Stiles in his endeavor. The louder they chanted the more that the world seemed to spin out of control. Stiles opened his eyes again as he kept chanting and could feel the world disappearing around him. What was once a clearing was now much a green blur around him. His eyesight was starting to go black as he felt a  compressed weight on his body. It felt as if he was becoming too small and tight for himself.</p><p>The last thing he heard before he slipped into the comforting darkness of unconsciousness was a soft accented voice whispering around him.</p><p>“Good luck Mieczysław.”</p>
