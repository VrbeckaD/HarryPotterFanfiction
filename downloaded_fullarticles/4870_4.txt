Being a teenager was hard enough, but not being able to hear posed special challenges, especially when your parents were hearing.</p><p>Remus wasn't born deaf. When he was six years old, he'd got very sick from a shot he'd received, but no one could figure out why. Ever since then, he’d fallen sick more often than the other kids in the neighbourhood, for longer periods of time. Because of this, his parents had become more protective of him. Remus would fall sick easily if he went out too much, so his parents tried to keep him indoors, to keep him safe. A few months after he started getting sick, an infection caused his complete hearing loss.</p><p>Lately his eyesight had been getting worse. His vision had always been a little blurry, but it had never been this bad before. That’s why his parents had been getting more strict with him. They now expected him to be home right after school and never got tired of reminding him to avoid roads with heavy traffic if possible, and to be aware of his surroundings all the time.</p><p>Remus would usually have a quick look in the library to see if there were any interesting books before he went home, but today, he got distracted by a new arrival and lost track of time.</p><p>After checking out the library book, he stuffed it in his satchel, swung the bag over his shoulder, and hurried home before nightfall, using the shortcut next to the school field.</p><p>*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*</p><p>"You're not even trying anymore, Black! Get it together! Our first game is in this weekend!" Sirius couldn't help but roll his eyes at James. He and the rest of the team had been dealing with James getting all snappy on them for the last week, and his patience with his best friend was wearing thin. But James hadn't even seen him rolling his eyes. He was too busy getting the ball down the field and scoring yet again. Not that it was very hard. Peter was in the goal today, and while he was a very good towel manager, he was pants at keeping, bless his heart.</p><p>It wasn't even like this was a real practice. The coach had gone home early to tend to her family (one of her kids was sick or something), so practice had been called off and half the team hadn't even shown up. The guys who had shown up had organised a pickup game, four on four since they'd made Peter play, but James was just so fucking bossy. Sirius and Frank had stopped caring twenty minutes ago. The Prewett twins were just standing by the far goal, chatting about something while they waited for the ball to come down that way. Benjy seemed to be trying to pacify James by actually getting a little practice in with Edgar, but Peter wasn't putting up much of a fight in the goal.</p><p>Peter scampered off to retrieve the ball, throwing it to Sirius who easily trapped it. He was about to start dribbling the ball down the field when he heard James shouting at him.</p><p>"If you don't score today, you're not playing on Saturday!"</p><p>Oh hell no. This wasn't even a proper practice. Where did James get off threatening him like that? Hadn't he been training just as hard as everyone else? Sirius stopped, turning to glare at James for a moment before kicking the ball as hard as he could at him. He'd kicked just a bit too hard. The ball went soaring over James' head, towards some kid who had his nose buried in a book. Oh fuck. "Hey, look out!"</p><p>*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*</p><p>Something hit Remus hard on the head abruptly while he was running home. He felt himself black out and losing balance, eventually collapsing sideway on the concrete pavement with his right arm hitting the ground first.</p><p>"Oh fuck, please don't be dead, please don't be dead," Sirius kept repeating under his breath as he ran up the field, James on his heels. When he finally reached the kid, he knelt down beside him, gently lifting his head up off of the pavement and cradling it on his lap. He'd never seen this kid before, but he was wearing a Hogwarts uniform so at least he hadn't accidentally murdered some kid that had accidentally wandered onto the grounds. Except from the looks of his chest rising and falling, he was still alive. Good! James caught up and dropped to the floor next to Sirius, resting his head on the kid's chest to listen for a heartbeat. When he found one, he sat up again and punched Sirius in the arm.</p><p>"Way to go, mate. Think we should pick him up and take him to the hospital wing? He hasn't broken anything, right?"</p><p>Sirius frowned and would have punched James back if he hadn't been so afraid of hurting the kid even more. "I don't think so…" But if he had, would it be safe to lift him up? Wouldn't that make it worse? He sighed, brushing the kid's hair out of his face.</p><p>The right side of his body hurt, especially his arm. Remus frowned as he felt the light touches on his face and there was a throbbing pain in his head. He slowly opened his eyes, wincing and squinting as his vision cleared. Two black-haired boys (one with a pair of glasses whose hair was sticking up in all direction and the other very good looking one with short, somewhat less messy hair) whose faces were contorted in concern were peering down at him. Remus had never seen them before, but judging from the shirt they were wearing, Remus worked out that they were on the school football team.</p><p>So wait, if they were peering down at him, did it mean that his head was in the lap of the boy who wasn’t wearing glasses, the one that was closer to him?</p><p>Remus pushed himself up at the thought, forgetting that he had an injured arm and grimaced when the pain hit him. Ow… he’d scratched his right upper arm but the wound wasn’t so deep that it’d bleed. He reached up to touch the spot where his head hurt and discovered that it was swollen. It’d probably bruised when he…</p><p>Hold on a second, why was he lying in the boy’s lap in the first place? He looked down silently as he wrecked his brain, trying to recall what had happened.</p><p>Sirius jerked back as the boy sat up, startled by his sudden movement. Had he woken him up by petting his hair? He reached out to touch his shoulder.</p><p>"You all right, mate?" he asked, concerned that the boy hadn't said anything or asked about what happened. What if he'd given the poor kid a concussion?! James watched them expectantly, waiting for the boy to tell them how he felt. They could always help him up to the hospital wing if he needed it.</p><p>Remus turned his head around to meet the pair of grey eyes that bored into his amber ones as he felt the light touch on his shoulder.</p><p>He couldn't recall what happened but he guessed he'd try to figure it out when he got home without the pressure of being surrounded by people, who were probably asking him questions that he couldn't hear.</p><p>Remus picked up his satchel and got onto his feet, stumbling forward and walking in the direction of his home.</p><p>Sirius and James watched the kid wander away without answering any of their questions, stumbling over his own feet as he walked. The other guys from the team had come over to make sure Sirius hadn't accidentally murdered one of their classmates.</p><p>"D'you think he'll make it home all right?" James raised a brow as the kid swayed a little as he walked away from them.</p><p>Sirius tried not to look too worried as he rested his elbows on his knees, cupping his chin with his hands. "I hope so. Do you think we should follow him and make sure he doesn't collapse halfway there?"</p><p>"Maybe he's gone off to die in private," Peter offered helpfully. "You know, it must be hard to have a nice concussion with blokes watching you and asking all sorts of questions." Sirius shot him a look and he clamped his mouth shut. James, on the other hand, laughed and tugged Sirius up off of the ground.</p><p>"C'mon, lads. We have a game to practice for. We'll never win the tournament if we blow it on the first game." Sirius started to follow James back onto the pitch, but he couldn't help but look back to make sure the kid was okay. Oh, he was gone. Hopefully he'd make it home without dying.</p>
