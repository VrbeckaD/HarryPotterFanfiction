    <p>They'd crossed paths more than once. They'd both be lying if they said they didn't cross paths intentionally sometimes; the need to blow off steam made staying away too hard. To be honest, Harry has no idea why he returns. Despite the hatred, the loathing, Harry has no idea why he continues to face Malfoy, even though anger burns him from the inside out every time the platinum-haired <em> brat </em> steps out to face him. Draco's robes drag across the ground and Harry's pissed off even by <em> that, </em>anger fueling duels that always end up in a drawl.</p><p>Harry can never bring himself to finish Draco off, for fuck's sake. They always fight until exhaustion kicks in, until they're covered in dirt and they're bleeding all over the ground they walk on. They duel until their legs give out and they're sat next to each other shaking, still angry but too tired to say anything truly hurtful. Now they're sitting in a field somewhere in Denmark, far off from where they normally battle.</p><p>Draco hisses at Harry and Harry hisses back, rolling his eyes and wishing he can shove his thumb right into the cut on Draco's lip, split it open even more so blood pools out onto the white dress shirt he wears under his robes. There's always been a very spoken rivalry between them since they attended Hogwarts together. Draco fought with him to end Voldemort but hated Harry for getting his father thrown into Azkaban.</p><p>Harry thinks he saw something about Lucius Malfoy dying in there a little while ago in the <em> Daily Prophet, </em> but he didn't care enough to read through it. The older Malfoy deserved it. Still, despite Voldemort finding himself a common enemy between Potter and Malfoy, anger made Harry's blood boil. Severus Snape died in the final battle, along with some of Harry's friends, and he should really feel bad for Draco because the blonde doesn't seem to have anyone left. Harry remembers the bullshit he got from Malfoy in his school years and growls under his breath. Who gave that stubborn piece of shit a <em> right? </em>Jealousy? Harry would give anything to have his energy back. He would give anything to be able to stand up, point his wand at Draco's forehead, and kill him where he sits.</p><p>Harry doesn't think he'd be able to do it.</p><p>He doesn't really have anybody left either.</p><p>"Your life is going well then, Potter?" Harry wants to spit at the man beside him. He doesn't, "Just a guess. Saw <em> weasel </em> got married the other day, thought you two <em> had something." </em>Draco mocks. Harry squints his eyes at him, rage spreading through his limbs. Ginny did get married a little while ago. He couldn’t be angry, as their relationship didn’t work out, and she looked happier with Neville Longbottom anyway.</p><p>"Shut the fuck up, Malfoy," Harry wants to hit him. Draco's fingers twitch as if he's fighting a similar urge, scoffing and tossing his head to the side. His hair brushes his forehead, soaked in sweat and covered in dirt, each strand matted down.</p><p>"I'm not that easy." Harry barks a laugh. He wants to say <em> sure, </em> mock him, because he knows <em> exactly </em>how easy the blonde is. He itches to pull out his wand, resists that urge, drags his palm through his dirty hair. His legs ache. Harry reminds himself to take a hot bath instead of a shower later.</p><p>"Really? You could've fooled me. Seems like you'd be the type to be <em> gagging </em>for it if I'm honest." Harry sneers, his ribs beginning to ache now that the adrenaline is pushing its way from his system. Draco scoffs, shakes a few strands of his dirty white hair from his face, and reaches forward to grab Harry by the robes. Harry laughs in his face, seeing fury light up in Malfoy's eyes, watching the way his pupils blow.</p><p>"You should learn your place, Potter," Harry reaches up and twists his fingers into Draco's hair, yanks his head back so his throat is exposed. They're both coated in sweat and dust and blood. Harry sees Draco swallow, lips parting. A breath sweeps from Malfoy’s mouth as the shock of Harry’s hand in his hair fades off.</p><p>"You're not easy, huh?" Harry leans into his ear, drags his tongue over the lobe and pulls the other man closer so they're flush. Draco grunts when his hair is tugged on by the movement, breath coming out in small puffs. Harry lets him go, "Could've fooled me," Harry repeats, same as earlier.</p><p>Harry leans back. Draco pants for breath then grabs Harry's chin and kisses him, angry and demanding. Harry shoves himself into the kiss, wrapping a firm arm around Draco's back and dragging him closer.</p><p>This isn't new, surprisingly.</p><p>They always end up like this. There's no love in either of the men for the other, just anger and hate, and yet they find themselves making out for however long is needed to feel a little less lonely than they were before, and then they go back to staying out of each other's ways. A breath punches out of Draco when he falls back onto the hard ground, ribs definitely bruised. His body will hurt like a bitch later. Harry drops down with him, pulling away to mock him, "Suck it up," and then forces his tongue into Malfoy's mouth when he goes to talk back. Draco tilts his head back, allowing Harry’s tongue to slip behind his teeth, coaxing a small noise from him that the brunette swallows.</p><p>Harry uses his free hand to push Draco’s knees apart, placing himself between them, tugging the blonde up until Potter’s body is straight and Malfoy’s spine is arched almost uncomfortably. Harry lets his fingers loosen up on Draco’s hair, just enough that it’s not as painful. Draco growls into Harry’s mouth, then pulls away. Hatred still dangles in the air, but the anger is gone. </p><p>Harry’s hard. He’s sure Draco is too but he doesn’t bother with looking.</p><p>He gives Draco’s hair one last tug, ignoring the groan, and then stands up and walks away.</p><p>Draco watches him go.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
