    <p align="justify">Draco Malfoy had always been very sure of what he wanted in life. Of course, what he wanted was not always possible, but his father taught him that, in that case, he should surround himself with people who would make it possible. Draco’s father had always told him that that was what relationships had always been based on – need, usefulness, and power. People like to put fancy words on that like ‘<em>friendship</em>’ or ‘<em>love</em>’ because it made them feel better about themselves. But in the end, people would always try to connect with him for one and only thing: gaining something from it.</p><p align="justify">Growing up, Draco had to admit that life had proven his father right. When he was a child, he had noticed how the parents of his so-called <em>friends</em> were sometimes forcing their children to play with him only to get the opportunity to talk to his own father. Lucius Malfoy had also taught his son to take advantage of this situation. That’s how Draco had formed an alliance with Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle before he even started Hogwarts. The two boys were taller, larger and stronger than him, they could protect him from older students if they ever decided to pick on him.</p><p align="justify">Draco had learnt his lesson well. He knew most of the people around him were kind or mean to him depending only on what they thought about his parents… or more often what their own parents thought for younger people. So, when Lucius Malfoy was arrested for being a Death Eater and couldn’t get his way around it, Draco knew immediately that his own world was finished and nothing he ever wanted would ever be possible anymore…</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That was until Draco met Edward ‘Teddy’ Wolfe.</p><p align="justify">Teddy was nothing like anyone Draco had ever met. He was kind and funny, yet he could scheme and tease. The boys knew things… too many things for his own good. Yet, he didn’t seem to use this knowledge to lure people around him. Draco’s mother had always said that knowledge was power. She had been the perfect wife to his father for years, listening and laughing pleasantly to his partners’ dubious jokes while silently taking away crucial pieces of information. And when the time came for her to save herself and her son from Lucius Malfoy’s disastrous choices in life, she used those pieces of information wisely.</p><p align="justify">Draco had wondered why Teddy decided to come to him. Because that what it was. A decision. Draco had certainly done nothing to encourage him to do so… Yet, Teddy had sat and talked with him for hours. Listening to his worries, using his peculiar knowledge to sooth him instead of crushing him…</p><p align="justify">Teddy had also willingly given him crucial information about himself. He had told Draco that his father was a werewolf. That single piece of information combined with the fact that Teddy was friend with Harry the Boy-Who-Lived Potter would be enough to make Teddy the most hated person in Hogwarts and thus saving Draco from that position. Seriously, how would people react if they learnt that a dark creature had lurked and became their very Light Saviour’s best friend in less than a few weeks? Teddy seemed to know what he had done when he had told Draco. Yet, he had done it. As if he trusted Draco… or maybe it was just a test or a way to manipulate him…</p><p align="justify">As weeks passed by, Draco’s wariness about this newly found friendship lessened down and when he saw his friend crashing into tears next to his hospital bed because he had been so worried Draco could have died eaten by a giant three-head dog… Draco just quitted doubting him.</p><p align="justify">Teddy was his friend. His first real and best friend.</p><p align="justify">And he had to share him with Potter… which sucked. But unlike what Draco had expected, Potter didn’t try to drive Teddy away. By the end of that year, Draco and Potter had made a deal. Never would they ever do something that would force Teddy to choose between the two of them. Teddy didn’t deserve something like that. And if one of them was worried about Teddy, he would tell the other.</p><p align="justify">So, Potter told Draco how Teddy seemed to have been through a break down on Christmas Day. And Draco told Potter when he noticed, despite Teddy always talking about his large and loving family, none of them seemed to ever owl the boy. Not even his godlike godfather who didn’t seem to have time to spare on his beloved godson, even for Christmas or for Teddy’s birthday. Draco was mad at the man even if he didn’t know him.</p><p align="justify">The biggest blow had been on Teddy’s parents’ death anniversary though…</p><p align="justify">Draco and Potter had watched their friend recollecting on the edge of the Black Lake. Then, they had walked him to the Castle as Professor Sprout had asked to see him and Draco had left when they met Sirius Black – now Lord Black – his mother’s infamous cousin. Draco’s mother had talked to Draco about the man in her letters that year. She wasn’t sure how they should act regarding him yet. He was a wild card. So, Draco decided to keep it as neutral as possible. The man clearly had prejudices against him already and, even if Teddy defended him, he didn’t want to stay near the man longer than necessary… So, he had left Teddy with Potter and went back to his Common Room.</p><p align="justify">However, when Teddy didn’t show up at dinner despite Potter being here, Draco felt like something very wrong happened.</p><p align="justify">“Potter… May I speak to you?” he asked, standing nervously next to the Gryffindor table.</p><p align="justify">The other boy only nodded and followed him outside the Hall. He looked upset which didn’t do anything to calm Draco’s nerves.</p><p align="justify">“What happened? Where’s Teddy?” Draco asked as soon as they were in some secluded area.</p><p align="justify">“With Sirius… They needed to go to the Ministry of Magic. His godfather died.”</p><p align="justify">“What?? How??? When????”</p><p align="justify">“… last summer…” Potter muttered looking away while fighting his tears.</p><p align="justify">Draco froze. “You’re kidding, right?”</p><p align="justify">Potter shook his head. “I don’t know how… just that… Teddy said it’s an accident… and that… he feels responsible,” he sighed. He was clearly trying his best to stay calm. “Sirius… Sirius said that Teddy was the Black Heir and that… that he could adopt him or something like that if Teddy had nowhere to go…”</p><p align="justify">“His godfather died last summer???” Draco exploded. “Why didn’t he say anything????? And what do you mean Heir Black?! My mother is from the main branch of the Black family! She would have known!!!!”</p><p align="justify">“How would I know?!! He didn’t tell me either, okay??!!!!” Potter yelled back.</p><p align="justify">They were both crying, and Draco thought they must have looked stupid.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was unsettling… To realise that despite everything Teddy seemed to have told Draco about himself, he still had kept so much for himself.</p><p align="justify">Draco had had to work with that knowledge for the next few weeks of school. What was even worse was that he had received a letter from Sirius Lord Black himself, explaining that Teddy was under some sort of Fidelius Charm and that asking him too much about his godfather’s death could permanently turn him into a vegetable… Who would ever put a child under the Fidelius Charm?!!! How do they expect Draco to tame his killing morbid curiosity????</p><p align="justify">But Teddy was more important. Even if he lied or at least did his best to hide the truth, Teddy was still Draco’s best friend and the Slytherin felt like Potter had breached their truce by stealing Teddy over for the next two months of holidays.</p><p align="justify">Draco would never admit it aloud, but he was afraid. Afraid of what Potter could say about him. Afraid about what Black could say about him or his mother! Let alone his father… What if spending two whole months with those two changed the way Teddy was looking at him?? What if Teddy didn’t want to be his friend anymore after that???</p><p align="justify">But Draco’s fear had been proven unfounded. Teddy had surprised him by giving him a chance to stay in touch wherever he was and whenever he wanted.</p><p align="justify">He called through the two-way mirror every other day and talked to him as if they were still spending their days together. He also came to the Malfoy Manor regularly during the second half of the summer. Once, Draco and his mother had been invited to Lord Black’s residence. And everything went great! Draco’s mother came to peace with her older sister and her younger cousin. Potter had been decent. And Draco had met a new cousin and enjoyed the show while Dora and Teddy competed to know who the better metamorphmagus was.</p><p align="justify">By Draco’s 4th year at Hogwarts, the boy couldn’t see his life without Teddy by his side anymore. Sure, most of his fellow Slytherins had accepted him back in since his 1st year. But knowing what real friendship looked like through his relationship with Teddy put every other one in perspective.</p><p align="justify">Now, Draco was having the most boring year at Hogwarts. They had started working for their O.W.L.s which was due for the end of the following year, so most of their lessons were reviewing what they did during the first three years of school. He didn’t have Quidditch practise because the House Tournament had been cancelled. And he was still unable to work at the Hospital Wing to support his eventual summer internship application to St Mungo’s because he was too young! What was he supposed to do with his time???</p><p align="justify">Teddy was busy too… he was working on NEWT level potions with Snape. Those were clearly above Draco’s level and even if he could help with the ingredients, it wasn’t as interesting as really experimenting with the process as Teddy did.</p><p align="justify">There was something else in Draco’s mind too… Potter.</p><p align="justify">The Gryffindor Golden Boy seemed to be everywhere nowadays. With his stupid hair and his stupid smug face… teasing Teddy, comparing their fucking dick sizes in the Great Hall!</p><p align="justify">Draco wasn’t blind. He knew he liked the stupid Golden Boy… Physically at least. He wasn’t as perfectly handsome as Teddy was. He was small, cranky and clearly never learnt how to use a hairbrush! But he had this <em>je-ne-sais-quoi</em>.His imperfections were what made him attractive. Like his stupid glasses that put far too much emphasis on the emerald green of his eyes…</p><p align="justify">But Potter was off-limit. Because he was Teddy’s best friend… Teddy’s brother. And if anything went wrong with him, Draco could lose Teddy in the process.</p><p align="justify">But it was unnerving… Seeing him pretending to dance with that Patil girl… It was also funny to realise that the boy seemed to be looking Draco’s way more often than not too… But he wasn’t sure whether the other boy might feel something for him too, or he just had noticed that Draco was looking at him and thus, was looking back. That later explanation wasn’t funny at all.</p><p align="justify">One day, Teddy had asked Draco to meet him on the Quidditch Pitch on the early morning and at first, Draco had been worried something might be wrong with his friend. Then Draco had seen that Potter was in the Pitch at this unholy hour too, and he had felt betrayed.</p><p align="justify">He immediately thought about the worst.</p><p align="justify">Maybe Potter had noticed his feelings and asked Teddy to set him off to beat the shit out of him. But Potter seemed as surprised as he was to see him there. So maybe he didn’t know… Maybe Teddy noticed Draco’s feelings for Potter and had set them up! But that would be… so much like his best friend… What if Teddy knew something thanks to his seer abilities?</p><p align="justify">But Draco had worried for nothing. Teddy seemed to have become sick of them both and decided to act on their extensive free time. Frankly speaking, Draco wasn’t even sure that Teddy realised the value of the gift he gave them. Who could say that they had trained under an almost world champion seeker’s very own routine???? At least, Potter seemed to be on the same page as he was on that part. Neither of them would waste on that opportunity.</p><p align="justify">And that was how Draco ended up spending one hour every morning and three to four hours every weekend with Potter of all people. But it would have been a lie to say he hated it…</p><p align="justify"> </p>
