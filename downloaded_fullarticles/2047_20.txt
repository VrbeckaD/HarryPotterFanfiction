    <p>It was a chilly October evening when the sixth year Gryffindor prefect turned the corner of the corridor at a brisk pace, her bushy hair bouncing behind her. The witches path was lit only by the pale moonlight spilling in through the windows of the castle. Hermione was thankful for the cloudless sky as it allowed her to patrol the halls this evening without using her wand to light her way. After many hours of walking with her arm raised her muscles would get awfully tired and begin to ache so she was glad to avoid that for once. Hermione was about to head back to the common room after a particularly long nights patrol of the castle. She had run into many problems and headaches that needed dealing with that evening. It wasn't anything too terrible, mainly just having to clear out randy courting couples from a few classrooms or out from broom closets but some of their protests and snide comments had gotten to her a little.</p><p>"Just because you've no one to snog, you've just got to ruin it for everyone else Granger!" One tall scowling Ravenclaw boy had said as Hermione shooed him and his giggling girlfriend from a disused classroom. Hermione had rolled her eyes and merely told them to get to bed or get to detention the next day. Hermione had no urge to go around snogging anyone in an old dusty classroom in the middle of the night but she did start to get worn down by all the teasing and comments she was receiving.</p><p>"Oh sod off the lot of you!" Hermione snapped aloud to herself as she walked along holding her head up proudly. She had better more important things to be doing than snogging. Her studies and prefect duties for one. Snogging wasn't everything, Hermione thought, nodding at her wise conclusion on the subject and feeling pleased with what a disciplined witch she was.</p><p> Soon after  Hermione pushed all the loving couples she'd interrupted from her mind and decided to hurry up and get to bed. She stifled a yawn as she walked not far from the library now. Being a prefect was rewarding, Hermione loved it but also it wasn't half tiring and the witch was ready to just collapse on her bed and drift off for once. Not even planning on any evening reading or writing a new passage in her diary. The Homework she had left undone was a few weeks ahead of everyone else so she felt she could also give it a miss for one day as well. She couldn't wait to get of her feet. Maybe Crookshanks would grace her with his presence again at last and they could curl up together.</p><p>"Oh...im bloody turning into a crazy cat lady aren't I?" Hermione said to herself stopping in the corridor her face freezing in horror at the thought briefly before she shook herself and carried on walking. 'No what rubbish!...you're just tired and annoyed don't get carried away' Hermione told herself.</p><p>"Draco please listen to me!" A high desperate voice cried from inside a nearby classroom. Hermione recognized Pansy Parkinson's voice and groaned out loud she really couldn't be bothered with these two tonight. So she pretended she hadn't heard and continued on down the corridor quickening her pace hoping to totally avoid them. She heard Draco Malfoy make some kind of reply but his voice was too low to make it out properly. It had an air of annoyance about it that Hermione did pick up, however. For a fleeting moment, the Gryffindor felt a slight urge to eavesdrop on the pair as they were likely up to no good. However, Hermione's sense of duty as a prefect for once was overruled by her need to get some rest and she left the arguing pair too it.</p><p>Smiling to herself smugly at her wise decision in avoiding the Slytherins as she walked along, head full of thoughts of her soft warm bed Hermione suddenly tripped over something and crashed into a nearby suit of armor which collapsed both Hermione and it tumbling to the ground with a loud clatter and clashing.</p><p>"Arghhhh" Hermione cried as bits of armor hit her head and shoulders. The deafening din of metal on stone still filling the corridor.</p><p>Hermione feared she might wake the entire castle, the cacophony seemed like it would go on forever. She hoped Pansy and Malfoy hadn't heard, 'they'd get a right laugh out of this' she thought, groaning as she imagined the pair stumbling upon her on the floor like this. Hermione tried to get up but found herself dazed, her head spinning and a loud ringing in her ears. She quickly fell back down on her bottom, which now hurt a great deal. 'Oh please don't let peeves find me that'll be even worse than Malfoy and Pansy!' Hermione thought, groaning deeply. </p><p>"What are you doing girl?" a male voice said in a highly annoyed and harsh tone echoing around the corridor.</p><p>Trying once again this time succeeding to pull herself to her feet Hermione rose and steadied herself against the wall, Then looking to see who was there she quickly tried to regain her composure and to figure out what had happened.</p><p>"Hello sorry... I was... something was on the floor and I..." Hermione rambled in a rather high shaken voice still a little shocked by her sudden accident. She began dusting herself down haphazardly. She next looked all around again for the source of the voice but found she was seemingly all alone. </p><p>"On the wall behind you, silly girl... you truly are loony. I told you if you didn't have the password you aren't getting in, no point throwing a tantrum and damaging suits of armor!" </p><p>Hermione turned and saw she was being addressed by a portrait of a very angry looking man sitting on a hill beneath a large oak tree with a stack of books next to him. He was rather overweight and had a very round and pudgy red face.</p><p>"I think you might've gotten your wires crossed...." Hermione began rather indignantly stepping forward and crossing her arms, going on the defensive immediately. She was tired, upset with the teasing she'd received earlier and now had a very sore backside to boot! Hermione Granger had had just about enough of everything this evening, this portrait was crossing the wrong witch but seemed not to realise and opted to continue berating her. </p><p>"You're one to talk! You mad thing you! Running around smashing the place up at all hours of the night. I'll tell Dumbledore, I will! You see if I don't!" The little fat man said pointing a finger straight at Hermione.</p><p>"Right! Now Listen here I don't know who you think I am but..." Hermione started in a strict tone utterly furious. Her temper rising every second this, wholly unfair injustice she was being done continued. Hermione found this to be a very rude, unfriendly portrait and she was not going to be threatened or spoken to in such a manner. </p><p>However before she could get anything else out and give the portrait a proper old school Hermione Granger telling off, she felt a small delicate tap on her shoulder.  Hermione turned to find the smiling face and large warm bright silvery eyes of Luna Lovegood. Her anger faded in an instant.</p><p>"Luna what are you doing here?" Hermione asked in surprise blinking rapidly, rather concerned that the younger girl was out of bed this late.</p><p>"Oh its a funny story really," Luna said cheerily reaching toward Hemione's bushy hair and gently removing some cobwebs that had evidently gathered in her brown locks after the Gryffindor had crashed to the floor.</p><p>"Um...ah..thank you, Luna," Hermione said shyly giving a small smile, a tiny bit taken aback by the kind display as the young Ravenclaw began to hum a pleasant tune as she worked at her messy hair. Hermione glanced at the angry portrait who had a puzzled look on his face, thankful that he was at least for the time, being quiet. Hermione turned back to Luna who had now finished her task of de-cob-webbing her.</p><p>"So this funny story of yours might I hear it?" Hermione asked continuing to smile as she took out her wand and cast Reparo on the suit of armor. As she did this Hermione felt very light and slightly gleeful out of nowhere. The sudden pleasant mood was very welcome, however. Luna tended to have that effect on people, well you either were delighted by her or got driven up the wall. Hermione had once been the latter but she'd grown fairly fond of the gentle Ravenclaw over the last year or so she'd just had to learn to filter out some Luna more bizarre remarks.</p><p>"Well some fourth year Ravenclaws got a hold of my book bag and hid it behind this portrait. I really need it for my homework you see so i decided to wait here for someone who might know the password. I fear some Bopkins may have caused me to doze off on the floor and then you took that awful fall. I hope you're alright Hermione I'd hate to have hurt you, Gryffindor needs their lioness after all" Luna said calmly swaying slightly from side to side as she watched Hermione fix the suit of armor.</p><p>Hermione blushed at the lioness comment, Luna sure did have a way of putting colour on peoples cheeks at the most inopportune moments. Something else had caught Hermione's ear too however, the hiding of someone's book bag or anything else for that matter was awful and sounded a lot like bullying. Hermione's hand began to tremble with outrage as she thought of some nasty little gang of fourth years terrorizing the small harmless swaying dirty blonde girl next to her. Harry had made mention of such things happening to Luna before and Hermione had felt like talking to some professors about it but Harry had warned her off saying Luna didn't want anyone getting her housemates into trouble. Hermione had been very opposed to keeping her nose out of this but Harry had made her promise not to say anything so she had reluctantly agreed though she was very much regretting that choice just now. </p><p>"Oh Luna, I'm sorry. if only id been here a little earlier, I could've stopped those little pests," Hermione said stepping toward her putting a hand on the witches shoulder in a comforting manner and stowing her wand back in her robes.</p><p>"Shall I go get a professor perhaps they can get your things back? Someone amongst the staff must know the password" Hermione said encouragingly with a smile giving Luna's shoulder a small reassuring squeeze.</p><p>"No I'd hate to be such a bother and I wouldn't want anyone to get into trouble...I'm sure it was all in good fun really..." Luna said softly looking away from Hermione whilst stating the last few words as she began absentmindedly toying with a bottle cork from the necklace she wore around her neck.</p><p>"It doesn't sound like you were having much fun, Luna..." Hermione replied quietly trying to meet Luna's eyes again trying to keep a comforting look on her face.</p><p>"I think I'd just like to go to bed now and maybe deal with this in the morning...its a long walk to Ravenclaw tower like this, however." Luna said looking down at her feet which Hermione noticed for the first time were completely bare.</p><p>"They took your socks and shoes as well!!" Hermione said absolutely scandalized by this information. She suddenly took her wand back out from her robes and was about to march right to Ravenclaw tower when Luna grabbed her arm.</p><p>"Please don't work yourself up like this, it's really only a game the rest of the house plays with me...do you want your first ever detention to be over some socks and shoes?" Luna said surprisingly cheerily. Hermione looked at Luna and gave a small choked laugh at the idea before speaking again.</p><p>"Well actually, I had detention a long time ago during my first year... probably why you haven't heard about it" Hermione recalled thinking of that terrible frightening trip into the forbidden forest with Hagrid.</p><p>"You really had detention? that must be quite the story, why don't you tell me about it instead of jinxing my entire house" Luna said casually and a slight hint of genuine surprise that Hermione Granger had actually merited detention before at some point in her life.</p><p>"I...Well...oh Luna your poor feet must be frozen we can't stand around here chatting all night." Hermione said suddenly frowning deeply as she looked at Lunas pale bare feet.</p><p>"Oh I'm fine really...but maybe I could do with a few moments with them in front of the fire before bed," Luna said looking at her toes and wiggling them. </p><p>"Okay then...hop on," Hermione said sighing slightly and turning her back to Luna. She hadn't given anyone a piggyback ride since her next door neighbor when she was seven before her magic had started to show and the neighbors started keeping their children away from her, that 'odd girl' they had begun calling her. The memory stang a little but before Hermione could give it much thought Luna had jumped up on her back with surprisingly little consideration given to the idea. </p><p>*****</p><p>"You're really rather wonderful Hermione Granger," Luna said as she clung to Hermione's back just as they arrived on the seventh floor of the castle. Hermione was glad her face was hidden from Luna's view and that she wouldn't see that her cheeks once again begin to glow.</p><p>"I must say though I think you're a little lost the entrance to Ravenclaw tower is on the 5th floor" Luna added with small giggle.</p><p>"Well i thought I might invite you to spend the evening in Gryffindor tower as my guest and you can get those toes of your's lovely and warm by our fire" Hermione said rather breathlessly as she finally arrived in front of the portrait of the fat lady that lead to the Gryffindor common room. Luna stepped down from Hermione's back beaming. Hermione was very relieved the trip was over she, not a very athletic person and the task of piggybacking Luna all the way to Gryffindor tower had really taken it out of her.</p><p>"That's a nice idea are you sure I'm allowed in?" Luna questioned looking towards the fat lady who had a rather perplexed look on her face at the display before her.</p><p>"Well I'm a Gryffindor prefect and I'm giving you permission and if anyone has a problem with that then they can talk to me," Hemione said eyeing the fat lady out of the corner of her eye, hoping  she wouldn't have any trouble from the portrait.</p><p>"Oh I don't think anyone would disagree with you Hermione...you can be rather scary sometimes," Luna said matter of factly. Hermione struggled to hide her delight at the comment trying but failing to keep her lips from turning into a sly devilish smile.</p><p>"Me? scary? surely not?" Hermione said eyes brimming with glee.</p><p>Luna meerly nodded and made a "mmm hmm" sound.</p><p>"Ginger ale," Hermione said suddenly loud and clear turning to the fat lady quickly reworking her features to a more cool demeanor.</p><p>"Yes okay, in you go Miss Granger and...friend," The fat lady said eyeing Luna suspiciously before swinging open.</p><p>Hermione and Luna found the common room empty unsurprising for this time of night. Hermione was rather relieved she hadn't been sure how the rest of the house would react to inviting a Ravenclaw unannounced into their private space, even if it was someone as pleasant and harmless as Luna. She walked Luna over to the fire where they both sat down on the floor luna with her legs outstretched and feet in front of the fire once again wiggling her toes and smiling widely. Hermione looked to her right and frowned finding a half-finished essay on the ground. Hermione sighed as she looked over Harry's work and unable to help herself picked up his everlasting quill to make corrections, which was starting to run dry and appeared less everlasting than was advertised. Luna giggled and Hermione looked around to find the witch watching her work.</p><p>"I do believe that essay belongs to someone else," Luna said eyeing Harry's name at the top Hermione blushed and set the parchment and quill back down.</p><p>"I know...how will he ever learn if I do it all...but some of that waffle he wrote, it was unbearable! I had to do something," Hermione said grinning nervously and Luna chuckled looking at Hermione thoughtfully and then turning back to the fire. The pair fell silent for a time watching the flames. Hermione found herself sneaking glances at the Ravenclaw now and again quickly looking away when Luna would catch her eye. Luna would grin and look at Hermione expectantly waiting for her to speak but Hermione would just give a dumb smile and then look back to the fire. Luna didn't seem to mind this and just began to hum that little tune of hers as she made her toes dance before the fire.

</p>
<p> Why did she feel so shy and awkward all of a sudden? Hermione thought, wanting to shake herself. 'It's only Luna, talk to her Hermione don't be so rude she's your guest'! A voice said in the Gryffindors head but Hermione found her mouth going dry when she tried to talk and she just couldn't settle on a topic to discuss that she wasn't worried Luna would find too boring.</p><p>Hermione chanced another glance and found Luna was now wrapping a loose thread from her jumper around her little finger which was slowly turning very red. Hermione without thinking brought her wand out and severed the thread unable to stand looking at the damage Luna was doing to her poor little finger. Luna stopped humming and gasped as Hermione began unwrapping the thread from her finger.</p>

<p>"Its...bad for circulation...I...sorry Luna..."Hermione rambled as she noted Luna's slight look of disapproval as the thread was tossed in the fire.</p>

<p>"Yes...of course, you're right Hermione...Its a bad habit of mine... I often wrap a thread around my finger its a nervous reaction when I'm near yo...um...never mind," Luna said quickly stopping before she finished her sentence and looking back to the fire as Hermione bit her lip.</p>

<p>"You get nervous...around me? You don't have to be Luna...I know I was rather rude and not the easiest to get along with when we first met...but I'm not that scary...Promise," Hermione said quickly and in a bold move took her little finger and linked it with Luna's recently freed one in order to pinky swear to the witch. Luna gazed down at her hand and Hermione's and looked back up at the Gryffindor beaming like a witch who'd just been told she'd won a million Galleons. Hermione felt herself fill with warmth at the glee in Luna's eyes. The witches held each other gaze for a long moment then Hermione let out a little gasp as Luna shuffled closer to her and leaned her shoulder into her, keeping their little fingers joined.</p>

<p>"No...more threads," Luna muttered happily more to herself than Hermione. Hermione smiled but her face soon fell, as she looked at Luna's uniform and noted there were, in fact, a rather large number of loose threads still left on the girl's skirt and jumper. Luna's appearance was rather ratty and unkempt she didn't seem to care all that much but Hermione couldn't help worrying about her. She didn't think Luna's father was without the gold for a decent uniform and the quibbler seemed to have found a strong cult following and sales had risen ever since Harry had given his exclusive interview. So money couldn't be an issue.</p>

<p>Luna's hair too, while not as wild as Hermione's own, was also fairly untamed and awash with split ends. Hermione looked Luna over for a long while and the longer she looked the less she got hung up on the girls seeming indifference to how she looked. Hermione found she rather admired Luna's refusal to do as everyone else did, to wear her hair as all the other girls did or alter their uniform as they did. The horseradish ear-rings, the bottle cork necklace and the way she tucked her wand behind her ear suddenly all these things made Hermione's heart swell. Luna's commitment to being herself no matter how many others laughed or tried to put her down reminded Hermione a little of herself and the Gryffindor chuckled then causing Luna to look around at her again. </p>

<p>"What? are you laughing at me Hermione Granger," Luna asked in a tone of mock outrage giving Hermione a small playful push</p>
<p>

"Never! It's just...you're rather wonderful Luna Lovegood," Hermione said repeating what the Ravenclaw had said about her earlier. Luna's smile made Hermione tremble with joy, the Ravenclaw bit her lip and looked back to the fire, seeming to be thinking something over Hermione watched her carefully enjoying how the flames danced in the girls silvery eyes.</p>

<p>"Is the sofa comfortable?" Luna asked suddenly. Hermione was pulled out of her trance-like state, that she had slipped into while watching the Ravenclaw. Why was she so captivating? No matter what she was doing, Hermione wondered trying not to chuckle again as she answered.</p><p>"I think so...though I was thinking Luna... maybe you could share my bed... I mean I was worried if someone just walked down in the night to find you alone in here what might they say" Hermione said with a small laugh.</p><p>"What might they say if they spy me climbing out of your bed in the morning," Luna said turning to Hermione a glint in her eye that made Hermione feel altogether weak and nervous and a bizarre rush of excitement all at once. Scrambling for a reply she was saved as Luna began to laugh.</p><p>"I'm just playing Hermione... I've never shared a bed now that you mention it...maybe it could be fun?" Luna said pulling her feet from the fire and sitting crossed legged. Hermione had never shared a bed either and now that the thought had arisen it seemed a rather great idea. Though as Luna had mentioned, what would her dorm mates say if they found out? Parvati, in particular, would spread the story far and wide with no doubt heaps of embellishments and never once mentioning that the event had been little more than two friends spending an evening together. A mere sleep over...a girls night in, yes that was all Hermione thought to herself.</p><p>Thinking it over a little while till her keen logic driven mind had rationalized everything Hermione finally stood up and reached a hand down towards Luna.</p><p>"Alright then bed time Miss Lovegood." </p><p>"Ah...a proper Gryffindor" Luna replied taking her hand giggling. </p><p>******</p><p>They had tiptoed up the stairs to the girl's dorm Hermione and Luna both holding back laughter it was a rather odd and funny situation after all. Hermione Granger sneaking Luna Lovegood into Gryffindor tower for an evening was not something anyone at Hogwarts would have placed on a list of likely occurrences. Hermione felt uncharacteristic-ly giddy as she took hold of Luna's arm and lead her gently across the creaky floor of the girl's dorm to Hermione's four poster bed both still on tiptoes.</p><p>The room was dimly lit by a slight glow coming from Shannon Botts bed. She appeared to have decided to do some late night reading by wand light. It wasn't much but just enough for Hermione to see herself and Luna safely across the room to her bed. When they came to a halt Hermione began to disrobe fully intent on sleeping in naught but the bare essentials when suddenly she remembered she was stripping off in front of Luna Lovegood. She turned to see Luna was already way ahead of her.</p><p>"Would it be too strange if I wore nothing at all Hermione?" Luna whispered stopping herself just before she was about to unclasp her bra.</p><p>Hermione was thankful for the dark as Luna could not for the second time that evening see how red her face was as she quickly turned away from the almost naked Ravenclaw.</p><p>"Oh whatever makes you comfortable" Hermione whispered back quickly sliding into bed before Luna could spend much time seeing her in her undergarments. It was strange she undressed in front of her dorm mates before bed most evenings without issue but with Luna here she felt somewhat shy. Sure one of the girls either Lavender or Parvati might make a sly joking comment now and again about how 'shapely' Hermione was becoming or note that 'she shouldn't hide herself under those school robes and wear some muggle clothes more often but Hermione had found herself unconcerned with any of their views. Those things they often said seemed all in good fun and though she would never admit it to them she was secretly delighted when the other girls complimented her in such a way.</p><p>A sudden thought struck Hermione, was she worried Luna might not like how she looked? Why should that matter to her all of a sudden? Hermione was driven out of her thoughts as she gave a small gasp just as a very naked and very cold Luna slid into bed behind her and snuggled closely against her bare back a set of small breasts pressing gently into her. A level of closeness Hermione had not been anticipating but she felt unable to move away from Luna to the other side of the bed. She felt rather comfortable like this even if Luna was freezing.</p><p>Hermione pushed these thoughts from her mind as Luna whispered to her once more.</p><p>"You're lovely and toasty, I might have to keep you as a permanent bed warmer" Luna gave a small giggle as she let her arm slide around Hermione holding her close both girls shifting around a little now and again each enjoying the others touch.</p><p>"Shall we sneak into Ravenclaw tower next time then?" Hermione asked jokingly after a while when she had become accustomed to having Luna pressed against her and felt less nervous.</p><p>"You'd be very welcome a fair number of our house think you should've been sorted into Ravenclaw...they often remark how sad it is they got landed with looney Lovegood and not Hermione Granger.</p><p>Hermione startled Luna as she rolled over in bed immediately to face her pulling the girl close and burying her face in Luna's shoulder so she wouldn't notice how tearful she'd instantly become. Holding Luna tight she said quietly trying to keep her voice as steady as possible.</p><p>"You're better than any number of Hermione Grangers Luna and don't you forget it. Those housemates of yours don't know how lucky they are honestly, a single day of having me around and they'd be driven up the wall worse than they ever could be with you." Hermione said managing to hold back tears.</p><p>"You're very kind Hermione Granger...and you smell of toffee...also your pink knickers are lovely" Luna remarked pushing her face gently into Hermione's bushy mane. Hermione gave a snort unable to bring herself to question any part of the strange yet comforting statement. </p><p>She guessed the room hadn't been as dark as she hoped if Luna could determine the colour of her underwear, a tiny part of Hermione was glad Luna had seen them though as she had briefly spied Luna's blue pair which had also been very nice. </p><p>"Blue suits you by the way" Hermione blurted out suddenly and immediately mentally slapped herself for saying something so stupid.</p><p>"Oh thank you...maybe we should swap," Luna said thoughtfully nuzzling Hermione's neck.</p><p>"Um...maybe," Hermione said diplomatically holding back fits of laughter.<br/>
soon they both drifted off to sleep warm and cozy in each other's arms. Hermione Grangers last thought before sleep took her was that She would get Lunas book bag back if it was the last thing she ever did...and that blue was her new favorite colour.</p><p>*****</p>
