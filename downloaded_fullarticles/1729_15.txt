    <p>Hermione had been working at the cafe for a few months now. It wasn’t the most glamorous job, but when Minerva had asked her to join the staff she couldn’t say no. She had been coming for years, browsing the meticulously sorted shelves with a mug of hot chocolate in hand before settling down at a corner table to start the day’s homework. She knew the menu by heart, and she had the regulars’ orders written on a chart taped to the counter by the espresso machine. </p>
<p>Hermione tied her apron around her waist, quickly punching in to start her shift. </p>
<p>“Hi, er, I’m Ronald. I mean, Ron. Ron Weasley.” She nearly lept out of her skin at the lanky redhead standing right behind her. </p>
<p>“Hermione,” she snapped, annoyed at herself for jumping. “You’ve got a bit of dirt on your nose.” She couldn’t help but notice how blue his eyes were.</p>
<p>“Oh...I’ll just, um, grab my apron then,” Ron’s face turned almost as red as his hair as he shuffled around, wiping at the side of his nose.</p>
<p>That day, the new boy managed to spill milk all over the floor, mess up an espresso (how he managed that, Hermione wasn’t sure), wedge the cash register closed, and burn his hand with hot coffee. He claimed he “got distracted,” which Hermione thought was a load of baloney. What could have possibly distracted him in a coffee shop? What an idiot. He seemed kind though, always trying to make the customers laugh, and that smile--no. No. She was not attracted to idiot dirty-nose boy. She shook her head and returned to scrubbing the counter with new vigor. </p>
