    <p>Hi. I had this idea today about Lucius and Narcissa. <br/>Narcissa and Lucius are in high school, living different lives. Narcissa is kind of popular, and Lucius is living in her father's shadow. Yes, HER. If you've read the tags, Lucius is a trans woman. I hope this story to be many chapters, though short. I'm excited to write this, and I'm hoping people will enjoy it too. <br/>Thank you, <br/>Al Blue</p>
