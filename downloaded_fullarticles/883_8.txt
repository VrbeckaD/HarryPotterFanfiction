  <b>Chapter One. A Fae Prince</b>
</h1>
<hr/><p>“When a new baby laughs for the first time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies there are always new fairies. They live in nests on the tops of trees, and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are.” -- J. M. Barrie, Peter &amp; Wendy (1911)</p>

</p><p>“I don't like 'Harry'.” Lady Lillian Potter says abruptly during dinner one night.</p><p>“Who?” Lord James Potter asks looking up from his beef wellington. James blinks owlishly then smiles fondly seeing his wife in a trance. Her emerald green eyes are glossed over and she's still fondly mumbling things like athletic, quick, and clever. She must be having another vision of their child’s future. He wishes, not for the first time, that he could watch them with her. All of her visions have been of a mischievous yet noble child with orderly shoulder-length raven hair and intelligent neon green eyes. Well, they have been since she saw that they are predestined to die at the end of a wand. They've come to terms with their fate as much as anyone can and have taken precautions to ensure their child’s future.</p><p>“As a name.” Lillian clarifies coming out of her trance. “I don't like the name 'Harry' for our son,” she says before stabbing a forkful of her autumn salad.</p><p>“When did we discover it was a boy?” James asks sitting down his silverware and looking to his pregnant wife bewildered and amused.</p><p>“Just now,” Lillian says smiling with a wistful kind of fondness. “His laugh sounds less like chimes in the wind and more like bells in a storm”</p><p>“Oh,” James says deciding that out of everything he's learned about Fae since discovering his wife is one that fact isn't so surprising. Still, it would have been a useful piece of information for the books to provide. “What brought this on? I mean-” James says raking his hands through his wild raven hair. “Why are we even considering the name ‘Harry’?”</p><p>“Albus keeps pushing for us to name our firstborn 'Harry' even if our child ends up as a girl. I told him ‘No’ flat out. He’s still insistent though. You know how he is.” Lillian says before turning back to her dinner. The words ‘controlling’ and ‘egotistical’ go unsaid.</p><p>James agrees with her. As she is six months pregnant and extremely temperamental he feels he needs to inform her of this fact. “That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. A future goblin King named 'Harry?'”</p><p>“Precisely,” Lillian says disgusted with the thought. “Despite the wizards not knowing that fact they do know he will be a Lord of both Wizards and Muggles one day.”</p><p>“You would think they would have more care or at least stay out of other people's business,” James says equally disgusted with the realization. That earns him a smile from his Lily flower and he relaxes enough to absentmindedly suggest a name. “If were going with H’s how about Haraldr.”</p><p>Lillian’s fingers tighten around her knife. “No,” she growls glaring at him before sighing. “At least not- not just Haraldr. Perhaps for a first name, yes. Then we can call him Harry for short when we’re around Albus and his lot. In private we’ll call him Haraldr.”</p><p>“By Potter family tradition he has to have my first name somewhere in there… how about a second middle name?” James asks absently wondering why deciding on a name is so difficult. Then he remembers <em> names have power</em>, especially among those blessed with magic running through their veins. To make matters worse, he's suggesting primary <em>human </em>names. It's an unconscious decision but he's still at fault. His child won't be a human after all. His son will be a Fae. Eventually, his firstborn son will be the King of the Fae. He needs a name fitting of his station. </p><p>“Why does he need a second middle name? Can't we just change his first name? He’s not even born yet. Nothing is decided.” Lillian argues.</p><p>“No. You had a point about Albus. We need a name like Haraldr that we can use to trick him and his Order-of-the-Phoenix into thinking we're following their plans.”</p><p>“Okay, so we need a second middle name to throw them off even further and keep with Fae tradition.” </p><p>Thus Lord Potter and his wife Lady Potter, Prince and Princess of the Fae, argue well into the night about what is a suitable name for a Fae Prince. Lillian gives him a thorough lesson throughout dinner on what constitutes a proper Fae name. Afterward, James began searching through books full of proper Fae baby names. Meanwhile, Lillian vetoes those she disagrees with. </p><p>Lillian likes the name ‘Briar’ but James feels ‘Briar’ sounds more suited to a fierce female. 'Puck' sounds much too vulgar in hindsight and James immediately apologizes for even considering it. ‘Adair' was rejected on the grounds that both James and Lillian <em>hate </em>that guy. Likewise, Lillian has too many bad associations the name 'Oliver.' Drake was simply too similar to Draco for James’s tastes. He doesn't want to get on a bad footing with the Black or Malfoy families while their at war. They just recently made up with that side of his family for Circe’s sake. The entire Potter family are in hiding to stay <em>out </em>of the war. </p><p>“Can we use a star name?” Lily hesitantly asks hours after they’re both buried in summoned books. “I’ve always wanted to name a child after a star, and its tradition on your mother’s side to do so.”</p><p>“Yes.” James quickly agrees. ‘<em> Anything to have an excuse to put away this mess </em> .’ he thinks to himself looking around the disaster of a library. <em> ‘It looks like a tornado swept through the room </em>.’ James absentmindedly muses.</p><p>“What about Regulus?”</p><p>“Regulus? What like Sirius’s brother?” he asks confused.</p><p>“Exactly,” Lily said with a small smile and a nod.</p><p>James pauses in thought before quickly agreeing. “I think it’s perfect.” </p>

</p><p>“How is my baby?” Lillian pants out, she’s out of breath, in excruciating pain and slowly releasing James’s cramping and bruised hand.</p><p>“Healthy and definitely magical.” Lillian's father, King Jareth, responds pleased. He’s still wiping the blood off his grandson and heir but he pauses to pass the task to his only daughter.</p><p>A baby with raven hair as dark as the night and porcelain skin as white and fair as snow yawns and squirms in her arms. Lillian releases a musical laugh seeing their baby alive and well. She instinctively coos at her child causing curious little neon green eyes to open and blink owlishly up at her. Lillian smiles and begins cooing again praising their child in a mix of English, Parseltongue, and Fae song. Their son giggles and laughs in response.</p><p>The picturesque sight reminds James of how he fell in love with her. He looks up as Lillian holds out their child to him. The baby moves to look at him as he holds his son and heir. He bounces his laughing son in his arms cooing and singing to him in English. Unseen to him Lillian watches them back with the same proud gleam in her vibrant emerald green eyes. </p><p>“Have you decided on my grandson's name?” Queen Sarah asks from where she's resting in King Jareth’s arms.</p><p>Lord James Potter looks up and smiles at his in-laws as well as his best mates Sirius and Remus. King Jareth and Queen Sarah are smiling and crying tears of happiness. His cousin and best mate Sirius and Sirius's husband Remus are smiling wide and happy. He wishes his parents were still among the living. Sadly unlike Fae his kind are easily killed. “Lily Flower, would you like to do the honors?” he asks her with a smile.</p><p>Lillian blushes but nods her head. “Our firstborn son and heir shall be named Heir Haraldr 'Harry’ James Regulus Potter from now forevermore, So Mote It Be.”</p><p>“So Mote It Be.” everyone happily choruses.</p><p>“Princess Lillian, Lord James, do I still have your blessing to name your firstborn son my heir?” The King of the Fae, Jareth asks solemnly.</p><p>“Yes.” Both James and Lillian answer as one beyond honored.</p><p>“Then with the permission of both parents, I Jareth, King of the Fae, hereby name my firstborn grandson Heir Prince Haraldr 'Harry’ James Regulus Potter my heir by both blood and magic from now forevermore, So Mote It Be.”</p><p>Sirius barks out a laugh. “This may seem like overkill but Remus and I made a promise to James back in school. As Remmy and I just discovered we can’t- we can't have any children of our own I would like to keep that promise.”</p><p>“Oh Sirius, Remus-” Lillian gasps horrified on their behalf before looking to an equally horrified James. “If- if James agrees then yes, yes you can name our baby boy your heir.”</p><p>Sirius smiles a bittersweet smile then clears his throat. “I Lord Sirius Orion Black hereby name my cousin James’s firstborn son, Heir Prince Haraldr 'Harry’ James Regulus Potter-Black, my heir by both blood and magic from now forevermore, So Mote It Be.”</p><p>“So Mote It Be.” everyone solemnly choruses.</p><p>“Anyone else want to surprise us by donating an heirship and family magic?” Lillian jokes causing everyone to laugh.</p>

  <b> <em>October 31st, 1980 --- Midgard, Great Britain, England, West Country, #8 Godric's Hollow</em> </b>
</p><p>Lillian is Hogwarts alumni and a former Gryffindor to boot but she’s quickly finding herself becoming disillusioned to the current headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. That's not to say she doesn't trust the man. She does trust her former secondary school headmaster. Just not with her life. More importantly, she doesn't trust the man with the lives of her family. She's found several of his acts questionable. </p><p>For example; why did Albus require them to leave the safety of Potter manor for the cottage in Godric's Hollow? A measly Fidelius charm is nothing compared to even a half-decent ward. The several wards surrounding and embedded in the foundation and land of Potter manor are more than adequate against both sides of the war combined. After talking it over with James, her husband, she found him in agreement. Soon after they left the relative safety of the Fidelius charm and made a trip to Gringotts to officially change their wills. They are now in the last days of moving back to Potter Manor. </p><p>The family has just sat down to eat after a long day of packing and sending the last of their chosen items off with Daisy and Woody, their family’s house-elves. Lily is laughing along with James at their pouting child. Haraldr, despite his best efforts, has more spaghetti on his face than in his mouth. The carefree atmosphere quickly disappears when a magical pulse ripples through the air, providing the only warning that the Fidelius charm has fallen. This can only mean one thing, their secret keeper, Peter Pettigrew, has betrayed their location. Their only defense in this small cottage, the Fidelius Charm, is useless to them now. </p><p>There's a reason charms aren't commonly used as a defense. Despite not believing a word of the prophecy themselves, it was far too common knowledge to be a true prophecy, they have never doubted that there are those who do. Lillian picks up Haraldr and the family tries to apparate away shocked and confused to find themselves firmly rooted to the spot. James and Lily share a terrified look, both instinctively knowing that this is the end and that this is their last goodbye, but it will be different for Haraldr. They refuse to die in vain.<br/>
<br/>
"Lils run. I'll give you as much time as I can." James says as he gets up and moves to stand between his family and the front door.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"Give them hell, James," Lily says taking a last look at her beloved husband. </p><p>She then turns and immediately begins to chant a modified version of an ancient parseltongue spell as she runs up the stairs with her Haraldr tucked safely in her arms. For their back up plan to work she will need every second available to cast the spell. Knowing this, James immediately begins activating the latent traps and curses they layered about their cottage home. </p><p>Mere seconds after he completes his task a Bombarda Maxima blasts the wooden shards of the front door clear across the entryway hall. James takes a fortifying breath as he comes face to face with the nation's current Dark Lord. Despite knowing he will die tonight James fights back with every ounce of strength and magic in his body. He knows he alone can not defeat the mad wizard but he will stall as long as he can until reinforcements arrive. </p><p>Sweat pours out of him as he valiantly fights barely registering half the spells flying out of his wand. Eventually, Lord Voldemort gains the upper hand and he backs Lord Potter against the dining room table. James can no longer dodge or block, and he is thrown back into the wall with such force that his neck snaps upon impact. The last thoughts that flicker through his mind are of Lily and Haraldr hoping that he gave his beloved wife enough time to save their son. </p><p>Now finished with Lord Potter, Voldemort begins to undo the traps that dare to stand in his way of the prophecy child. If his mind wasn't so set on eliminating the threat that holds the potential to undo all of his plans he would have noticed the glow of a magical signature that wasn't his own. However, he began on the stairs minutes after and therefore remained blissfully unaware of the parselmagic that had just been cast. His eyes shine with madness when he sees the mudblood woman remains defenseless despite the ample time offered to her to summon her wand. However Lillian doesn’t need her wand anymore, and she moves to seal the protection she had just given her son.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"Not my Haraldr. Take me! Take me instead!" she continuously repeats with her hands held in front of her in a defensive manner thus completing the ritual. </p><p>She feels when the protective magic takes hold ripping her soul and magic from her body. It is ancient magic, soul magic, and it will protect her child from any evil that will ever come to stand against him. Princess Lillian Garnet Potter, nee Evans has given up her very magic to protect her baby boy. In doing so she signed the death warrant of her soul, for there is always a price to be paid for using this form of magic. Unlike her husband, her soul will not reside in Valhalla's halls but will rather simply cease to exist as of this night. This is the last resort she and James had planned to ensure that their son could live. As she takes her last breath she can only smile as the green curse shoots from the mad man’s wand. She dies the second the curse makes contact. </p>

  <b> <em>November 1st, 1980 --- Svartalfheim, The Underground, The Goblin City, Jareth's Castle</em> </b>
</p><p>"Allow me to clarify" growled Jareth the Fae King, Master of the Labyrinth, Guardian of wished away, Lord of Dreams, husband of Queen Sara Evans, and father of Princess Lillian Potter nee Evans. "The Midgardian Above's upstart human wizard believing himself to be a ‘Dark Lord’ murdered my only daughter as well as her husband and now my only grandson and heir has been kidnapped?!" King Jareth looks positively murderous and heartbroken at what he is hearing.</p><p>Now the goblin people are widely known to be a warrior race. It is said that goblins care only for gold, knowledge, trickery, mischief, war, and weaponry. They neither respect, fear nor obey the average mortal. The only mortals they respect, fear, and obey is their King and his family. None of whom should be classified as mortal in the first place strictly speaking. </p><p>The reason for their undying respect is simple, the Goblin King and his family are not just <em>any </em>fae royalties they are the <em>only </em>fae royalty. King Jareth may be widely known as the feared Goblin King however he is also the King of <em>all </em>the Fae. King Jareth not only carries the blood and magic of every Fae species, but he also fought to earn his position. He is not one to be trifled with. </p><p>In the opinion of the dragons, ravens, and phoenixes that fly through the air, Jareth is King. In the minds of the trolls, the fairies and the elven people that live on the land of The Above, Jareth is King. According to the records kept by the merfolk, sea serpents and the kelpie of the water, Jareth is their King. Even in the hierarchy of Goblins, Gnomes, and Ogres that live in the Underground Kingdoms, Jareth is the Fae King. </p><p>In front of him the herald goblin Gillroot trembles in fear of his King's wrath and wishes, not for the first time, the message he was assigned to deliver had been different. The goblin herald Gillroot wishes however go unheard. Princess Lillian Garnet Potter, nee Evans and her wizard husband, Lord James Charles Potter, are dead. Murdered in their own home by a wizard believing himself to be a Dark Lord. </p><p>Meanwhile, their only child, the sole male heir to the Fae kingdoms, is still missing. One-year-old heir Prince Haraldr James Regulus Potter-Black having been kidnapped from his home the same Samhain night his parents were murdered. It's a tragedy if there ever was one. For once someone has been named heir by both magic and blood that decision cannot be changed.</p><p>On the opal and diamond throne beside the silently crying King Jareth sits his wife and Queen, Sarah Evans. Sarah Evans is the Fae Queen, Mistress of the Labyrinth, Guardian of the wished away, Lady of the Muses, and mother of Princess Lillian Garnet Potter, nee Evans. Queen Sarah is loudly sobbing at the news. Every now and then an ear-piercing wail of 'My baby girl! or My- my grandson-!' will escape her mouth before a heart-wrenching sob will tear through her throat. </p><p>The outbursts are continuously followed by uncontrollable hiccuping and crying. King Jareth looks seconds away from pulling his beloved wife into his lap. The only thing stopping him seems to be the high pitched noises his Queen is making. Her wails are reminiscent of a banshee or perhaps a particularly sick and dying siren. Soon enough however King Jareth pulls his distraught wife into his arms and begins to sob loudly with her. As they cry goblin and house-elf servants are hard at work collecting and labeling their precious teardrops for future use.</p>
