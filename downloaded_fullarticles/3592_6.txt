    <p>Draco Malfoy could be moody at times, sure. His attitude could be less than favorable, and he was often described as “brooding”. But you were lucky enough to experience a side of him that most people weren’t fortunate enough to see. No one seemed to give the poor boy a chance. He was generally disliked by most students at Hogwarts for the way he acted in his first few years at the school, and you found it ridiculous that no one thought him worthy of a second chance. While you never ignored the fact that his family’s values and morals were, well…<em>terrible</em>, to put it mildly, you knew that that wasn’t Draco. Draco wasn’t anything like his father. In his younger years, he might have seemed to be following in Lucius’ footsteps, but you knew it had been out of fear and a sense of loyalty to his family. He had changed. You had been there to witness it firsthand, and to help him along the way. You were a muggle-born yourself, after all. You knew better than anyone. </p><p>Draco was <em>good. </em>He always had been. </p><p>In your eyes, he was absolutely brilliant, and stronger than anyone you had ever met. He had brought you so much joy and happiness over the course of your two year relationship. For the first time, you felt wanted. <em>Needed.</em> The last two years had been the best years of your life. </p><p>But, of course, other people had a hard time learning how to forgive and forget. </p><p>Your friends didn’t like him, and his weren’t exactly fond of you. It didn’t matter how many times the both of you tried to explain to the respective parties that your love for one another wasn’t going to change anytime soon, it didn’t stop them from running their mouths. At least your friends had started keeping their thoughts to themselves whenever Draco was present. The same couldn’t be said for the majority of his friends, however, and Pansy in particular seemed to have it out for you.</p><p>Younger Draco might have had a problem with your blood status, but he had grown to love you regardless. The fact that you were a muggle-born didn’t bother him in the slightest. He loved you for you, something that Pansy couldn’t seem to understand. She constantly made fun of you for not being pureblood, and it only got worse as your relationship progressed, no matter how many times Draco threatened the girl with a nasty jinx. </p><p>
  <em>“She only torments me because she has a crush on you, you know,” you would mention to Draco as you walked down the empty corridors of the castle, watching as he rolled his eyes in response.<br/></em>
</p><p>
  <em>He would then gently wrap his arm around your waist before pulling you close, placing a soft kiss to your temple as he spoke, his lips moving against your skin in a way that caused butterflies to erupt in the pit of your stomach. “She’s just jealous because she’s not you.”</em>
</p><p>You had always tried to be nice to the Slytherin girl, but it grew harder and harder as her teasing grew more and more vicious. You felt bad for retaliating after it became too much to just sit back and hold your tongue, especially when Draco hadn’t spewed a mean word to any of your fellow Gryffindors since the early stages of your relationship. He had even left Harry Potter alone, for the most part. But, Draco had told you to simply not worry about it. He agreed that it had been well deserved. If your friends had been as rude to Draco as Pansy had been to you, you were sure that you wouldn’t mind your boyfriend giving them a piece of his mind. </p><p>You didn’t dwell on Pansy’s behavior too much. Your seventh year was halfway over, after all, and you only had to put up with her for a few more months. The thought of moving in with Draco after graduation kept you motivated as ever. </p><p>It was the morning before the start of the Winter Holidays, and you were sitting in an empty corridor, watching the snow fall and waiting for Draco to join you. You both would be returning home for Christmas, something neither of you had done in the last two years. You both were given the option to travel home, of course, but Draco never returned to Malfoy Manor unless it was necessary, as to try and keep the peace, and you didn’t believe that he should have to spend Christmas alone. </p><p>Draco was worried about the holiday. Summer holidays were bad enough as it was. It was no secret that Lucius Malfoy wasn’t a fan of your relationship with his son, and he seemed to always remind him of his opinion whenever given the chance. The first week after summer was always hard as you could really see how much his father had torn down his spirit. You could always tell when Draco had heard from his father by the look on his face and the way that he carried himself, and that’s how you knew something was wrong as he made his way down the hall towards you.</p><p>You jumped down from your spot on the window ledge and walked towards Draco, meeting him halfway. His gray eyes met yours, and you hated to see the storm growing within them. </p><p>“Oh love,” you whispered before pulling him into a hug. </p><p>The blonde boy wrapped his arms around your waist, pressing you into his chest as he exhaled. “Father told me that I am to stay here for the break.”</p><p>Before you had time to respond, Draco started ranting, his grip on you tightening. </p><p>“He said it’ll be good for me to stay at school, because it’ll give me a chance to study more. And I’ll have more time to practice for Qudditch. And maybe I’ll be able to find a way to earn Slytherin some house points. He thinks I’m a failure. And-”</p><p>You stopped Draco before he could continue, pulling back only slightly and placing a small kiss against his soft lips. “Draco, baby…you and I both know that you’re anything but a failure.”</p><p>“But what if I am? I try so hard, and it’s never good enough for Father.”</p><p>“You’re doing your absolute best. Try any harder and you’re going to completely lose yourself, and I’ll end up losing you too.”</p><p>Draco narrowed his eyes and subconsciously gripped the back of your sweater at your suggestion. “Don’t even joke of such a thing.”</p><p>“I’m not joking, love,” you mumbled, “you really are giving it your all. I don’t want to see you consumed by your desire to impress your father.”</p><p>He closed his eyes and sighed, nodding his head briefly before stepping away only to pull you into his side. “Come on, we’ll be late for breakfast.”</p><p>***</p><p>Draco’s mood didn’t improve as the day dragged on. You tried your hardest to cheer him up, and while it would work for a few short minutes, you would watch as he retreated back into his head, hearing his father’s voice tell him all he’s been doing wrong. </p><p>You had offered to stay behind with him the following day, but he quickly objected (<em>“Your parents have been expecting you for months, you can’t just cancel on them last minute”</em>).</p><p>It was decided then and there that he would be joining you on your journey home, which he again objected to, but you had refused to listen (<em>“For the last time, I’m not letting you spend Christmas by yourself”</em>).</p><p>Draco was still agitated as you both left the Great Hall, having just finished eating dinner. His hair was a mess from constantly running his fingers through it, and his eyes were void of any emotion. You knew he was nearing his breaking point. </p><p>Pulling him around a corner by his tie, you backed yourself against the wall and threw your arms around his neck, pulling him into a heated kiss. He responded immediately, gripping your hips tightly as your lips moved together. You threaded your fingers into his hair as he lifted you off the ground, forcing you to wrap your legs around his waist. You knew you had a high chance of being caught by a professor, but you didn’t care. All you cared about was getting Draco out of his own head. </p><p>His lips left yours and traveled down to your neck, his teeth lightly nipping at your skin. You were just about to tell him to put you down and take you to his dorm when someone came running around the corner, knocking into the both of you. Draco tried his best to keep you from falling, but the force of the impact sent you tumbling. Your head collided with the stone floor, and your vision blurred as dizziness took over. </p><p>You laid on the floor for a few second before blinking the tears away and looking up to see Draco staring at you from a few feet away. He had landed on his stomach, and he was now pushing himself up onto the palms of his hands. His eyes were wide as he watched you try to sit up, and you furrowed your eyebrows but winced as you did. Lifting your hand up to your forehead, you felt something warm and wet coat your skin. Pulling back, you frowned at the sight of blood on your fingers. </p><p>Your eyes flickered back to Draco’s as anger overtook his features, your own eyes widening at his expression. Before you had time to assure him that you were fine, that it was just a little bump to the head, he was standing up and grabbing the offender by the front of his shirt. </p><p>“Are you blind!? How dare you run into us like that?”</p><p>The young Ravenclaw frantically shook his head, all words lost as Draco continued to yell.</p><p>“What, did mommy and daddy never teach you to watch where you’re going?”</p><p>“Draco, stop,” you pleaded, rising to your feet and placing your hand on his shoulder. </p><p>He let you pull him away from the visibly shaken boy, but rage continued to boil in his veins. He was seeing red, and the words flowed out of his mouth before he had time to think about them.</p><p>“Filthy, little, no-good <em>mudblood</em>.”</p><p>You froze as the slur left his lips, the words falling upon you like a ton of bricks. Draco tensed as he realized what he had said, and he slowly turned to face you, guilt and remorse evident on his face.</p><p>“I…” he began, but trailed off once he noticed a tear slip down your cheek. </p><p>You shook your head in disappointment and disgust, backing away from the blonde haired Slytherin. He took a step towards you, causing you to take another few steps back.</p><p>“Don’t,” you hissed, your hands curling into fists as different emotions flooded your body. “You promised me that you would never use that word again.”</p><p>“Y/N, I…you know I wasn’t talking about <em>you</em>, I was just…I was angry.”</p><p>Crossing your arms over your chest, you shook your head. You knew what you were going to say would hurt him, but you couldn’t stop yourself. Your voice was barely above a whisper. </p><p>“Maybe you’re more like your father than I thought. Just…just stay away from me,<em> Malfoy</em>.”</p><p>You spun around and took off down the corridor, never once looking behind you to see if he was following. Tears rolled down your cheeks as you fled to your dormitory, ignoring the prying eyes of those in the common room as well as the blood that still trickled down your face. Collapsing onto your bed, you continued to cry. You cried and you cried and you cried, until you finally cried yourself to sleep. </p><p>
  <em>Was there any coming back from this?</em>
