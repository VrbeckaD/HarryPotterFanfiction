    <p>Her light brown hair whipped around her violently, the wind slapping it across her lifeless face.</p>
<p>Her body lay limp, in the arms of the person who discovered her. </p>
<p>The woman carrying the small body of the girl let slow tears fall on her cheeks. She didn’t know who the girl was, but something horrid must’ve happened to her. </p>
<p>The girl’s face was cut up, as if by a sharp knife. Blood trickled down her face. There were several large gashes in her side, the blood inside having seeped out to stain her clothes and mark the end of her life. </p>
<p>The woman shivered as she walked up to the nearest building, a small shop. </p>
<p>The shopowner gasped as the woman walked up, running out to meet her.</p>
<p>”What happened?” The shopowner cried, moving closer to see the face of the lifeless girl.</p>
<p>“I don’t know!” The woman wailed. “I found her just laying there...”</p>
<p>The shopkeeper gaped at her in horror.</p>
<p>”It’s Cassandra Riddle!” He cried. </p>
<p>“Who was she?” The woman asked.</p>
<p>“The wife of that brilliant Riddle boy that lives down that way- she’d just announced she was with child,” the shopkeeper said, touching Cassandra’s face tenderly. </p>
<p>“Who could have done this to her?” The woman asked in horror. </p>
<p>The shopkeeper pursed his lips.</p>
<p>”It could have been anyone,” he said. “But Cassandra was so kind-“</p>
<p>His eyes widened in horror. </p>
<p>“What?” The woman asked fearfully. </p>
<p>“It was because of Tom!” He said venomously. “Rumors are circulating that he is very much into the Dark Arts- they must’ve killed Cassandra as a warning to him!”</p>
<p>”That’s horrible!” The woman cried. “The poor girl didn’t do anything!” </p>
<p>“They must believe this will stop him from going further in the Dark Arts-“ </p>
<p>”Cassandra?” A voice yelled. </p>
<p>The shopkeeper and the woman turned to see the young, handsome Tom Riddle running toward them. </p>
<p>“Oh no,” the shopkeeper said. </p>
<p>Tom came up and grabbed Cassandra’s face in his two hands. </p>
<p>“No...” he mumbled. “NO!” </p>
<p>He collapsed on the floor and stifled a sob. Then he turned furiously to the shopkeeper. </p>
<p>“Tom?” The shopkeeper asked quietly. </p>
<p>“They will pay for this,” Tom breathed angrily. He shot up, looked at Cassandra, and Disapparated. </p>
<p>“What does he mean?” The woman squeaked. </p>
<p>The shopkeeper looked fearfully at her. </p>
<p>“That could mean anything.” </p>
<p>And it meant the worst. Tom appeared back in his safe house- the Malfoy Manor, where his Death Eaters were assembled.</p>
<p>”My Lord?” Abraxas Malfoy asked, startled at his appearance.</p>
<p>”Send the Death Eaters out on the first of many, many raids tonight,” Tom snarled. “Tonight is when Lord Voldemort will make his first appearance.”</p>
