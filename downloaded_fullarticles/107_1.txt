<p>Child of Silence</p>
<p>By Angelwings Sorrow</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chapter 1 “Those Green Eyes”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bucky was tired from the long flight after a successful mission. He missed the big battle in New York as well as Thor joining and Loki’s reluctant joining of the Avengers. The All Father thought the best punishment for Loki was to help repair the mess he made by allowing the Titan Thanos to take control of his mind. Steve promised to give him all the details later. Right now he was looking forward to a hot shower and crawling into a nice clean bed with his lover. </p>
<p>“Welcome back Snow Man weren’t expecting you until tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well I caught an earlier flight. Now, if you excuse me I need to shower before I can sleep for a week.” The former HYDRA agent ignored the billionaire and continued on his way to his room. </p>
<p>“Mission went that bad?” Tony asked and received a glare for his question.</p>
<p>“What Mission ever goes according to plan?” before he could continue on his way two men came walking into the room drawing his attention.</p>
<p>“Brother, do not be so sour!  I am sure that the Sorcerer Strange did not mean to forget you.” a tall man with long blond hair wearing a blue tee-shirt a denim jacket and jeans smiled to the slightly shorter man with black shoulder length hair wearing a nice pressed suit all in black and black tie. </p>
<p>“Thor you are a trusting Buffoon. Every time we go to see that man I end up falling through space for what seems like an Eternity.” Loki snapped at his elder brother, unaware they had an audience. His green eyes glowed with his irritation.</p>
<p>“Harry? No Impossible! You’re dead.” James shouted suddenly his mind was assaulted with memories that had been tightly suppressed.</p>
<p>“Buck!” Steve had just entered the penthouse when he saw his lover collapse screaming as if his head was about to explode. He rushed to his side unsure on how to help the tortured man.</p>
<p>“Loki go get the sorcerer I fear he has broke some spell upon him.” Thor ordered as he went to help Steve restrain the man who was thrashing upon the floor.</p>
<p>“You maybe right I shall return, hopefully.” And the God of mischief was gone in a blink of the eye.</p>
<p>“Jarvis call the team it’s an emergency!”</p>
<p>“Already done sir. Dr Banner is bringing up a sedative.”</p>
<p>“Good.”  Tony used his Iron Man gloved hands to hold Bucky’s feet down, but the Super Soldier of Winter was a strong force to restrain.</p>
<p>“Hold him steady!” Bruce ran into with the syringe prep and ready.</p>
<p>“We got him just do it.” Steve yelled. Banner wasted no time and injected the thrashing man in the neck it took but a minute to take affect but James was finally calm and fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>“What the hell happened?” Steve panted as he collapsed beside the sleeping man.</p>
<p>“I have no idea. He just got home we were just chatting when Point Break and Reindeer Games came in. He took one look at Loki and all hell broke loose.” Tony said from his spot on the floor across from the Captain.</p>
<p>“He seems to have broken from a magical spell. My brother and I could feel the magic as it broke. The Sorcerer Strange should be able to tell us more about it when he has examined your friend.” Thor explained as stood up from his spot.</p>
<p>“Indeed I shall. Sorry I took so long, I had to make sure Loki wasn’t luring me here on false pretences.” A tall figure said as he walked into the penthouse through an open portal.</p>
<p>“One of these days I will get even with you.” Loki mumbled following the Doctor through the magical portal. </p>
<p>“Dr. Strange, can you please look over Bucky? We had to sedate him before ripped open his own skull.” Steve asked. He was about to lift his lover up to the couch but was stopped by the Doctor.</p>
<p>“Leave him be I’ll take it from here.” With the wave of the sorcerer’s hands the Winter Soldier was levitated into the air and held him there while a golden circle weaved around his body scanning him and stopping at his head. “Your friend had a powerful but incomplete Memory Charm placed upon him. Whoever had done it was powerful but inexperienced. I am repairing the damage. It looks as though the person who cast the charm did not want to really hurt him as there is no sealing spelling on the memory charm. Unfortunately when it broke the memories were overwhelming causing the hysteria you just saw. Right now I am combing through his memories as I repair them. An orb appeared before the group as if it were playing a movie on Fast forward. “And here is the caster now. It’s… a child.” </p>
<p>“A kid did that to him?” Tony exclaimed as they all stared at the image frozen on the orb. A small boy that looked to be six maybe seven with messy black hair and vivid green eyes the same shade and color of Loki. This child could easily pass for the son of the god of Mischief. </p>
<p>“The child is powerful but untrained. I believe he willed the memory block on your friend with the purpose of setting him free. Going through Mr. Barnes memories he met the boy during his time with HYDRA and became protective of him. Something happen before his last Mission that made the boy erase or more like alter Mr. Barnes memory of him. The child is likely still alive with the scientist of HYDRA.” The Doctor moved Bucky to the couch to let him heal and awake naturally. </p>
<p>“You mean that kid is still with HYDRA?” Bruce asked in disbelief. “Didn’t we destroy them?”</p>
<p>“No unfortunately. As much as I would like to wipe them off the face of this earth they are the balance for S.H.E.I.L.D. neither can have absolute control. Now, I know for a fact that HYDRA has a new leader named Baron Wolfgang von Strucker. The boy must be with him.”</p>
<p>“We need Fury. He’ll know where they are; getting the kid out has to be our top priority.” Tony said are he was running a check on his suit to make sure it was battle ready.</p>
<p>“No need to shout I am already here. Jarvis sent me a report on what’s been going on. We have had Von Strucker under surveillance, but there has been no report of a child seen on his property. He does have a Dr. List on his pay roll and the boy is most likely at their hidden lab, location unknown.” Fury entered the penthouse with Pepper, Natasha and Colson bringing up the rear.</p>
<p>“I know where it is.” A horse whisper replied.</p>
<p>“Bucky!” Steve sat on the couch where his lover was now sitting up. “I was worried.”</p>
<p>“Sorry love, but I feel like I was hit by the hulk a few times.” Barnes sighed. “No offense Banner.”</p>
<p>“None taken.” Bruce smiled.</p>
<p>“Anyways I know where List is. When that memory whammy was broke I remembered everything. Does anyone have an aspirin or vodka I can dull the pain with?”</p>
<p>“Here, we have plenty of Tylenol on hand for Tony’s hangovers.” Pepper smiled offering the Winter Soldier the pain relief pills with a tall glass of water. </p>
<p>“Hey I’m not that bad.” The Iron man protested in offence.</p>
<p>“Thanks.” Barnes took the medication and water gratefully.</p>
<p>“So Man of Winter care to tell us about the child that greatly resembles my brother?” Thor questioned taking a stance next to Loki.</p>
<p>“His name is Harry. That’s what List said his name was. I am unsure if he has a last name. Anyways when I awaken from my frozen sleep, I was very angry and vulnerable with only one arm. I also didn’t take to their conditioning to well. I fought them at every turn and refused to give them what they wanted. That was until they put Harry in my care. I had had a cell to myself for a long time the only thing on my mind was escape. One day List came to my cell with this small child that looked no more than two or three but in reality he was five years old. His throat was bandaged up, face was pale, he had messy black hair and his eyes were so green and sad it broke my heart.”</p>
<p>Flash Back</p>
<p>“This is your new Cellmate James. His name is Harry and he just turned five years old. I know that you both are going to be the best of friends. You don’t have to worry about his crying at night or whining that he’s hungry or any of those noisy sounds children make. I have solved that little problem.” List smiled cruelly.</p>
<p>“What… have you done to him?”</p>
<p>“I took the liberty of removing his voice box. It will make training him all the more easier. You see Harry has an interesting story. He can do what his former guardians called Freaky Magic. Can you believe it? We here at HYDRA haven’t seen a wizard in almost Three hundred years. It will be wonderful to resume our experiments on him.”</p>
<p>“You Monster! He’s just a child!”</p>
<p>“A very special child, James. His magic only manifests when he is emotional. So there will a lot to experiment with to see how we can get him to use his powers.” List looked gleeful at the anticipation of torturing the boy.</p>
<p>“You won’t lay a hand on him! I forbid it!” Barnes jumped to his feet ready to fight the doctor with his one arm heedless of the fact he lost the other.</p>
<p>“You’re not in the position to forbid anything James.” The doctor sneered but looked the man over in thought. “However I think we can come up with some agreement that will suit us both.”</p>
<p>“Leave the Boy alone and I’ll do as you say.”</p>
<p>“I can’t agree to that but I can agree to light experimentation as long as you start working with your trainers. Also if you behave we will replace your arm. If we can’t come to an agreement that I am sure I can get you a front row seat to his sessions of Magic.”</p>
<p>“Fine! I’ll agree, but light sessions only. He’s a child and could die!”</p>
<p>“Oh I know how far to push his powers I am a doctor after all. Now I’ll let you two get settled and I’ll be back for you in the morning. Sleep well James. Good night Harry.” List patted the boy on the shoulder and Harry flinched from the touch. Once the mad doctor left, James knelt before the child. </p>
<p>“I promise Harry I’ll do everything I can to protect you. We are both prisoners here and once I find a way to escape I’m taking you with me okay?” Harry nodded his agreement and threw his arms around the man cried silent tears.</p>
<p>End Flash Back</p>
<p>“I went through the training trying to find a way for us to escape but had no luck. We took turns in healing one another from our training sessions. They alternated between his magic training and combat training. I was condition or at least that is what I lead them to believe. I also took advantage of their combat and weapons training anything that would help us escape. Then my first mission came up and I was brief on what I was supposed to do and that I was to take out you guys at one of the abandoned bases. I thought this would be my chance to secure a way out for me and Harry. It never happened. Harry couldn’t talk so he couldn’t tell me why he was terrified when I was returned to our cell that night; but he had a determined look on his face. The last I remember was a bright light and falling unconscious. When I awoke I had memories of List coming in to tell me that Harry had died and that there had been an accident during the combat training one of the instructors took it too far and snapped his neck. My mind was completely dead at the thought that I push all my feelings and memories of Harry to the back of my mind and gave in to their conditioning. I became their Winter Soldier with nothing else to live for.”</p>
<p>“How awful.” Pepper had tears streaming down her face Natasha wasn’t much better as she sat so stiff as if trying to hold in her emotions physically. Bruce had to leave the room for the Hulk containment area because the big guy wasn’t too happy about the torture of a defenseless child. Dr. Strange eyes were cold and calculating. Thor seemed to give off little sparks of electricity in suppressed anger. Loki was no better as magic vibrated around him. Tony was researching ways to track down List and the Base for proper retribution. Colson and Fury absorb all the information and were mentally setting mission parameters. </p>
<p>“This Mission will have to be a six man team, with Dr. Strange in charge. Barnes, are you up for the mission? You just got back from a mission; it’s okay for you to sit this one out.” Fury asked knowing that the man looked like hell but would volunteer to go anyways.</p>
<p>“I want to go, no I need to go. I promised Harry to protect him and I failed. I need to make it right beside he knows me he’ll be scared of strangers even if they are trying to saved him.” </p>
<p>“Then I’m coming as well you’ll need someone to watch your back.” Steve clapped a hand on his lover shoulder telling him that he was sticking by him no matter what.</p>
<p>“Good. Stark I want you to go gather all the Intel you can off their computers and everything pertaining to Harry you can download. Thor and Rogers would make a good distraction while Barnes Loki and Strange retrieve the kid and Stark disables their system.” Fury ordered as Colson wrote down every word. “Strange and Loki can contain the boy’s magic should it be come unstable. Romanoff I want you to stay here and wait for Barton then meet up with others should they need back up. This is HYDRA we are dealing with so be on guard.” </p>
<p>“Yes sir.”</p>
<p>“Now, Barnes where is this base?” Tony asked as he had Jarvis pull up a virtual map of the world on display for everyone to see.</p>
<p>“Its located at the base of The Owl Mountains a mountain range located in southwestern Poland. The range has a length of approximately 26 km and extends from Kłodzko Land to the historic Lower Silesian region. So it’s secluded in the middle where it is heavily wooded and impossible to see from the air.” Barnes stood at pointed to the base’s location from what he last remembered.</p>
<p>“I’ll head back to Headquarters and see what else I can find you guys gear up and leave ASAP.” Fury turned on his heel and headed out.</p>
<p>“I’ll meet you all there I have some research to do before meeting our young wizard.” And with that Strange was gone.</p>
<p>“Come brother we must get ready I believe there will be quite the battle.” Thor slapped his brother on the back nearly knocking the dark haired god on his face.</p>
<p>“Indeed. We’ll meet you on that Flying contraption in twenty minutes.” Loki straightened his suit and followed Thor out of the room.</p>
<p>“Pep.”</p>
<p>“I know cover your meetings and get a room ready for Harry. I’ll have a medic team standing by.” Pepper already had her tablet and her nimble fingers danced across the screen.</p>
<p>“You’re a life saver I promise to make it up to you.”</p>
<p>“Just get that little boy out of there and kill the son of bitch that’s keeping him there.” The red head growled with fiery anger blazing in her eyes.</p>
<p> “We will Pep. You can count on us.” Tony walked over to his best friend and gave her a hug trying to reassure her that everything was going to be ok.</p>
<p>“Yeah, okay now go Harry is waiting for you.” The red head gave her boss/friend a slight shove before heading down stairs to the Main office to coordinate with Happy on security and get ready for the boy’s arrival.</p>
<p>“I’ll head down to the Lab and get my suit you see you guys on the roof.” Tony gave a mock salute and disappeared in another elevator.</p>
<p>“Hey Bucky you ok?”</p>
<p>“NO, I AM NOT OKAY! I can’t believe I forgot about Harry. He’s just a child and as powerful as he is, he still just a child, helpless and vulnerable. I failed him Steve. I promised I would escape and take him with me but instead I just left him there. What kind of Monster am I, to leave an eight year old boy there to be starved and tortured?”</p>
<p>“Hey, stop, you didn’t know that he was still alive. Strange said the kid put you under a spell to forget him. He did it to save you. Something was probably going to go wrong and he wanted to protect you and set you free.” Steve tried to reason but even then the reasons sounded so hallow. He would be forever grateful to Harry for saving Bucky but it shouldn’t have come at the cost of the boy’s life and freedom. </p>
<p>“Some how that is little comfort. Come on let’s suit up I want to get him out of there as fast as possible.”</p>
<p>“Sure. I’ll always be here for you. Let’s go get the kid.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>XxXxXxXxXx</p>
<p>Something was bothering, the god of Mischief, as he sat in the back of the flying contraption, known as the Quinjet. A child that powerful was unheard of in Midgard. Mortals had limits; their Magical core could not handle such power as the Sorcerer was talking about at such a young age. </p>
<p>“I know what you are thinking brother. That child has to be of our world but how?” Thor took a seat next to Loki trying to think out the possibilities himself.</p>
<p>“Don’t ponder on it too much brother you’ll give yourself a head ache.” Loki sighed ignoring the pouty face of the Thunder God.  “I have thought upon the existence of this child and it might be of my own doing.” </p>
<p>“How so brother? I have never heard of you on Midgard until recently.” Thor was now interested in what had happen to his sibling during the years that he had been away.</p>
<p>“Like you I have traveled the realms but I did it in a more subtle way. I found these mortals amusing and easy to manipulate to my will. Over the centuries I kept returning to watch them and their discovery of magic and their building of civilizations.  It was fascinating how the battle of light and dark, good and evil was a never ending cycle both neither truly winning and never truly losing. Anyways while here I did indulge in pleasures of the flesh. Oh don’t look so surprised Thor I am not as virtuous as you are and I sate my urges as I please, but I never thought a child would come of it.” Loki rolled his eyes seeing the look of shock on Thor’s face.</p>
<p>“Why ever not, Loki? Is that not how children are created by the copulation between Male and Female?”</p>
<p>“True that is how one usually acquires a child. I never thought it would happen to me because, my saintly Brother, my tastes have always been drawn to the male persuasion. And unless they are Magical and have a barer gene in them I could not foresee it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, OH! I never knew that about you, how come you have not told me until now? Do you not trust me?” Thor was hurt by the secrets kept from him by his own brother.</p>
<p>“I did not tell you for fear you would tell Father. Once when we were young I saw him sentence to death two sets lovers; two male and two females. The Females and the males married each other to hide themselves from their families. All four of them lived together but kept their true feelings for their real lovers behind closed doors. Well the families grew suspicious that there were no children brought to the unions and sought Father’s help to find the truth. He used his magic to compel the truth from their lips. Father said they had made a mockery of our ways and that Asgard was for the growth of our people and children. Since they had no intention of following our ways they were ordered to death as traitors of Asgard. Since then I have hid myself and traveled the realms. Only Mother knows as she was the one who found me upset after the trial. She encouraged me to travel and be myself; that it wasn’t who I was attracted to that made me who I was but being myself made her proud I was her son. So that’s what I did, but I always came home to mother and stayed out of father’s way and tried not to be within his notice.” The God of Mischief sat back, daring not to look upon his brother’s face to see the rejection he knew was there.</p>
<p>“Loki, I am sorry that Father has scared you into hiding yourself from the world, but I am your brother and not the world. You could never change my opinion of you because of who you might love. Never hide from me brother I will always stand by your side.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, brother.” Loki whispered as he was holding in the emotions that threaten to break through. Now was not the time to let them go as they had a mission to complete.</p>
<p>“Loki do you think this could be your child or your descendant? I only ask because if he is your child, Mother will want to come meet him, but I do not think Father will want him to come to Asgard.”</p>
<p>“You are right about that but as to the child’s parentage I am unsure. The last mortal I had laid with was powerful but I felt that he was of Asgard descent. I am unsure how many Midgard years it has been since I was here. The man was tall and slim built and his magic was familiar like that of home. I guess that is why I was attracted to him and him, me. My time with him was the longest I had ever spent in Midgard, almost a whole earth year. I cared for him and I believe he cared for me as well. He showed me his world and the magic they could do and I showed him some of my magic. I even showed him my true face, the face of my birth and he was unafraid of me. He knew the tales of the Frost Giants and still cared for me; never once did he think me a monster. If Father had not called me home for your coronation I might have settled on earth with the mortal.”</p>
<p>“And that is why you didn’t defend yourself from the accusations of you calling the frost giants to attack. You were protecting your mortal sehrid from Father’s wrath; I am sorry Loki. Even though I did not know of your life on Earth I am sorry I was the cause of the loss of your happiness. My temper and banishment didn’t help either. As Happy as I was  to have you there I would have rather you stayed on Midgard being happy with your mortal sehrid. You’re happiness is all I ever wanted for you.” Thor could see the pain in his brother’s face and that he was holding back that pain of the past.</p>
<p>“Happiness? I didn’t think I was capable of being happy. Yes, I assume you are right. I became very bitter after father forbade my return to Midgard after my imprisonment and I was cleared of treason. He stepped up my training to be your keeper and adviser for when you take the throne for real since you proved you weren’t ready for the crown. Mother was the one who keep me sane. Did you know she use a mind spell in to take the image of my mortal and had a miniature painting commissioned for me? I still have it tucked away so father will never find it. It is what has kept my darkness at bay.”</p>
<p>“Have you tried to find him since returning to Earth?”</p>
<p>“Yes be he is gone as is his magic. I knew that there was little chance he would still be alive. Like I said I do not know how long it has been since time is different here. But think of it no longer brother we must concentrate the child and making sure we retrieve him with little to no injury. I would like it if the boy was unharmed in this endeavor but with these mortals that might be impossible.” Loki huffed as he nodded to the rest of the team.</p>
<p>“True we can be a little rough around the edges but we try to be careful in the destruction we cause. I am sure the child will be alright.”</p>
<p>“Destruction is right. Just make sure you keep the fighting outside I’ll handle the inside.” Loki stood up “We’re getting close I can feel magic.” suddenly he ran to the front of the Quinjet. “Land this thing now!”</p>
<p>“What is it Reindeer Game we still have twenty minutes ETA.”</p>
<p>“Land now or we’ll be dropped from the sky! They are using the boy’s magic to short out all of your mortal contraptions!” Loki began channeling his magic into the jet to try and counter the magic attacking them.</p>
<p>“Stark he’s right I am starting to lose power in engine two; engines one and three are still holding but not for much longer.” Rogers said as he strained to keep the jet in the air.</p>
<p>“I see that Capsicle. There is an open clearing by the river. Everyone buckle in this is going to be a bumpy ride!” Tony yelled as he and Rogers began their descent grazing over treetops trying to keep into the air until they reached the clearing. “BRACE FOR IMPACT!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A/N: Okay not what I planned on doing when I sat down to my Laptop. This is my first Major Crossover. I got the idea stuck in my head and now have about two more chapter in rough draft. This is a AU story and will barely follow any set timeline or events in either Harry Potter or Avengers. I have read some cross over and while they are very well written they tend to take from either the movies or books too much for my tastes. it's almost a rewrite of Avengers with Harry Potter thrown in. So Please when criticizing my fiction please keep in mind I am trying not to Plagiarize the movies or the Books. this is Fun Fan Fiction and I don't own Marvel or Harry potter, just the plot bunnies running ramped in my head. thanks for Reading Keep Reviewing.</p>
