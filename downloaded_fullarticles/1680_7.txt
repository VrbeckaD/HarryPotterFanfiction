    <p>Oh no, Albus thought. The other baristas were nowhere to be seen so he was left to serve the customers who just walked in. The customers were the members of a band called Devil's Snares. In the band was the university's hottest guy who Albus might have a little crush on. Just might.. The band was known and popular at the university. Or basically its two members: Vinda Rosier and of course, Gellert Grindelwald. Albus was sweating slightly and was nervously looking for a way out of the situation. But there was no way out of it. So he cursed internally and tried to calm down. </p><p>And he did manage to survive the situation without anything embarrassing happening to him. Except when he had given Grindelwald the change their hands had slightly touched. Come on Albus, he thought, get a grip of yourself. You're not a freaking virgin anymore. But Albus couldn't help himself. What would Gellert's hands feel like somewhere else...? He felt his face getting hotter and luckily a new customer came and Albus needed to concentrate again.</p><p> </p><p>"That guy looked somewhat familiar... Do you know him Vinda?" Gellert asked contemplatively and glanced at Albus.</p><p>"Oh, I think he's the most insufferable know-it-all from our university. That's what I've heard. If I remember correctly he's now starting his fifth year of studying Transfiguration." Vinda gave a questioning look at her friend. </p><p>"Why'd you ask? Don't tell me that you'd like to bang him..." She continued as Gellert had not muttered a word and had kept staring at the redhead until he heard Vinda's words and quickly exclaimed:</p><p>"NO, I didn't plan that. How silly of you to think like that!"</p><p>Vinda raised her eyebrow and answered unimpressedly.<br/>
"Oh really? Just down the street you saw a hot guy and started drooling after him. And yesterday you thought our lecturer was very, how did you describe him... ah, fuckable..."</p><p>She smirked and Gellert on the other hand frowned. But as their friends asked them a question about new ways to prank their enemies they forgot their interesting topic. But every now and then Gellert's gaze turned to the redhead that was busy working behind the counter. </p><p>                                         * * *</p><p>Albus got to his apartment late. He'd had a really long day and he felt tired. First in the morning he'd had a lecture and after that he had spent a long time at work. Albus was working as a barista in a coffeehouse close to the university. Albus himself wasn't into any kind of coffee but he did the job to earn money to pay his tuition and rent. He couldn't get any help from his family as they unfortunately lived with a quite tight budget. </p><p>But even though it was late, Albus had a long essay to write. He wrote it about an hour and then started to go to sleep. As he was drifting off to sleep he couldn't help but remember how Grindelwald's magical and beautiful long fingers had touched his hand..</p><p>                                          * * *</p><p>The next morning Albus headed for a different part of the university than he usually did. Albus' main subject was Transfiguration but he also studied Alchemy, Ancient Runes and Dark Arts as secondary subjects. He had gotten a special permission to study so many subjects without applying to all of them. All, especially his family, had been quite shocked to hear that Albus had gotten Dark Arts as one of his secondary subjects. Obviously Albus didn't plan to become a murderous dark wizard, he simply wanted to gain a better knowlegde of all areas of magic, including the Dark Arts. He had already been studying Transfiguration for four years. Alchemy and Ancient Runes he had started two years ago and had studied them alongside Transfiguration. And now it was time for him to start his studies of Dark Arts. So this year he would be studying Transfiguration and Dark Arts. </p><p>Therefore he was now walking on a completely weird looking corridor to his first Dark Arts lecture. He walked to the classroom and instantly noticed some very familiar looking blond curls. He tried to ignore the fact and sat down on an empty place.</p><p>On the other side of the room, the said curly blond had also noticed the redhead. He was surprised. </p><p>"Vinda, there's that guy you told didn't study Dark Arts?" </p><p>"Who? What do you mea... Oh. Well I'm quite sure he's here for the first time, cause I've never seen him here before. I wonder what such a nerd is doing here." </p><p>"Yes..." Gellert managed to answer before he shut up because the hottie lecturer from yesterday was here again and started to talk about today's topic. </p><p>The lecturer gathered the names of the students who were present. Albus was slightly feeling uncomfortable as many of the Dark Arts students were staring at him. But when it was his time, he announced his name to the lecturer and even the lecturer stared a bit too long at him. Why were they staring? On the other side of the room Grindelwald had finally gotten the name of the redhead. </p><p>"Albus Dumbledore... That's the fucking guy who has won all of the university's prizes and because of him I've always been second.." Gellert muttered angrily and gave a displeased look to Vinda. </p><p>"Told you, a horrible know-it-all. But we'll soon see how he's going to survive here..." Vinda smirked and that seemed to brighten up Gellert who now looked smug again. </p><p>The lecture went on and pretty much everyone in the room were nearly falling asleep. And the lecturer noticed that and therefore announced loudly that they would get to use the spells they had just learned and they could duel each others. The tables and chairs were quickly wiped out of the room so they had room to duel well. The lecturer was going to decide the pairs which made Vinda and Gellert roll their eyes. Vinda got paired with a girl named Emily Yaxley who wasn't a very talented witch. Vinda cursed in French and shared an annoyed look with Gellert but still went to stand next to Emily. </p><p>"And finally we've got left.. Gellert Grindelwald and... Albus Dumbledore." </p><p>Oh what a lovely surprise, Gellert thought. Now the dumb Dumbledore could taste his sweet revenge. He looked so pure and sweet that Gellert thought he would win this duel easily. If only he knew...  He walked to Albus' place. They shook hands and Gellert's arrogance was just glowing from his features. </p><p>"Now you can start to duel freely, but please don't kill each others and I'd like to see you try out these new spells we just learned." The lecturer said but everyone had already started duelling immediately after they had heard the word 'start' so no one heard what else he had said. </p><p>Spells were flying everywhere. Albus felt free as he could finally use his Dark Arts skills without any harm done or anyone judging him. But Grindelwald wasn't going easy on him. They both kept sending curses and spells at each other in a really fast pace. </p><p>Gellert felt surprised. The Dumbledore wasn't going down as easily as he had thought. Actually there had been a few times when Gellert nearly had lost already but luckily still managed to get back on track.</p><p>Now Gellert sent a massive black dust cloud at his opponent who destroyed it into tiny pieces and sent so quickly a thick fog at Gellert that he got out of guard and the fog covered him and instantly after that he felt his body being binded and even though he tried to get rid of the ties, he didn't see anything and his magic didn't work at the ties. </p><p>Albus was still determinedly holding Gellert in the ties and inside the fog he didn't realise everyone else had already stopped duelling. The lecturer looked astoundedly at Albus who finally realised they needed to stop and vanished the fog. That made everyone see Gellert laying on the floor binded by... What? The lecturer approached and let out a loud laugh. </p><p>"Magnificent! I've never seen a student being able to bind another person down this well. You have a powerful spell here Mr Dumbledore! And binding one down with the force of darkness! No ropes can hold better!" </p><p>The other students had slowly gathered closer and realised that a powerful dark force was twirling around Grindelwald's body as a rope. Gellert felt humiliated and was relieved when the dumb git finally let him free. And the git even dared to hold out his hand to help him get up. </p><p>"I can get up by myself idiot." Gellert muttered so quietly that only Albus heard it. </p><p>"Great! You all did well, but I do have to praise Dumbledore! Seems like Grindelwald's not going to win all the duels anymore. And now I have one project to announce and then the lecture is finished. So the project is about blood magic and rituals and you'll do it with the partner you just duelled with. " The lecturer said happily. </p><p>Gellert groaned loudly. Just what he needed. More things to do with that bloody git. </p><p>"Just great." He muttered to Vinda who wasn't looking very pleased either. </p><p>"You'll do it on your free time of course and you'll have three weeks to do it!"</p><p>The students started to leave. Gellert walked past Dumbledore and purposely bumped hardly at his shoulder. And after that Gellert shot a nasty glare at him. Then he turned to Vinda who was walking next to him and snarled at her:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Vinda, we have a new person on our blacklist... "</p>
