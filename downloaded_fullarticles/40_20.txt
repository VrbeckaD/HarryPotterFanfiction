    <p>“Remus!”</p>
<p>The young boy laid in his bed, his eyes half open. Dark circles lined his eyes. Fresh cuts roped along his arms, chest, face.</p>
<p>“Remus! Come down here!”</p>
<p>He groaned and pushed himself up, his sore muscles screaming in protest. He plodded, exhausted, down the wooden stairs of his house to the kitchen, where the smells of breakfast cooking turned his stomach. He sat at the kitchen table, where his mother, Hope, placed a small plate with a few strips of bacon and a scone on it in front of him.</p>
<p>“Try to eat something, dear,” She murmured. “You need your strength.”</p>
<p>Remus mumbled softly under his breath and pulled the scone apart absentmindedly. He had no appetite and longed to go back to bed. </p>
<p>“Good morning, Hope. Remus.” This was Remus’ father, Lyall, who emerged from his bedroom, dressed in his work clothes. He grabbed a scone, pressed a gentle kiss to Hope’s cheek, and patted his son on his shoulder. Remus hissed in pain and flinched, as there was a deep cut right where his father had pressed. Lyall immediately moved his hand and exchanged a concerned glance with Hope.</p>
<p>“Remus?’ Hope started, pulling out the muggle first-aid kit she insisted on keeping. “How bad was this moon?”</p>
<p>“Pretty bad,” Remus whispered. “I don’t remember much. But it hurt.”</p>
<p>Hope sighed softly and Lyall wrapped an arm around her slim shoulders. “How about you eat at least a little bit, then I’ll patch you up, okay?” She asked. Remus nodded and picked up a strip of bacon. His gaze still hadn’t left the plate.</p>
<p>“I’ll be at work until about dinnertime,” Lyall told his family. “I may be a bit late, though. Newt thinks he’s onto something with one of his creatures. Don’t wait for me to eat, okay?” Hope nodded and Lyall gave her a hug, then stuffed his scone into his mouth as he left the house.</p>
<p>Remus finally finished his bacon. Hope took his plate and set it on the counter, then helped her ten year old son to stand and led him to the bathroom, where she instructed him to remove his shirt. He shivered as the cold air in the house hit his bare chest. She bandaged up the cuts and stitched a few of the deeper ones. Remus took all of this unflinchingly, as he’d had to deal with this for almost six years already. 70 months. Seventy transformation’s of scars wrapped themselves around his small body. He was short for his age, as his growth had been stunted by his constant illness that revolved around his lycanthropy. He was wiry, too, with skin that stretched around his thin frame, showing nearly every bone he had. Although it was hardly visible, he was muscular due to his transformations. </p>
<p>Hope eventually finished bandaging her son and let him walk silently past her as she watched him sorrowfully. The boy lay on the couch as she cleaned the dishes from breakfast. About noon, he managed the strength to get up and help with a few chores, but after a small lunch, he fell asleep, curled up on the couch, his light brown hair falling over his eyes. He was due for a haircut. Hope paused in her sweeping the porch to brush the hair from her son’s forehead and press a soft kiss to the boy. She smiled sadly at him as she studied his face for a few seconds. He looked so peaceful as he slept, even though there was a slight frown playing on his youthful face. The day passed quickly and Hope soon took a marker and crossed it off of the calendar that hung on the kitchen wall. She then flipped to the next month’s page, where the next full moon was already circled. March 11, the day after his birthday. She sighed, her poor son had suffered enough as it was, now he couldn’t even celebrate his eleventh birthday happily. Not that he could already, it was very likely that he would never get into Hogwarts with his condition. Most parents don’t want their children to go to school with a werewolf.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The next three weeks passed as usual. Remus recovered his strength and was able to help Hope with chores again. He regained his appetite and was eating as normal. Hope watched him happily, glad to see color in his cheeks and his eyes bright. She knew that in only a few days, he would begin to feel the effects of the moon again, and begin to suffer once more. Lyall had taken a rare day off to spend time with his family. He knelt at the coffee table, across from Remus, both of them working on a puzzle. They had just finished it when Hope called them for lunch.</p>
<p>It was truly a picture-perfect family. The mother and father loving, their son energetic and happy. This was a rare scene, for usually Remus would be ill and lethargic, Lyall would be slaving away at work, guilt-ridden with the circumstances of how Remus was bit which the boy did not know, Hope would be doing all the chores around the house, caring as best she could for her only son and her magical husband. It was nice, though, when they could have a moment like this.</p>
<p>The moment was broken by the doorbell ringing. Remus, who had been asking to be let from the table as he’d finished eating, slid off his chair, calling  “I’ll get it!” while running to the door. He pulled it open to reveal a wizened old man with a long white beard, wearing simple gray robes. Remus stared up at him, in awe simply from this stranger’s presence.</p>
<p>“Pa?” Remus called, turning to the side. “I think it’s for you.”</p>
<p>Lyall rose from his chair to see who it was, then hurried to Remus’ side when he did so, pushing the boy somewhat behind him. “Albus,” He greeted. “What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“Hello, Lyall,” Albus returned the greeting. “I believe you know why.”</p>
<p>“Lyall, what’s going on?” Hope asked, joining the three males. Remus slipped his little scarred hand in hers and she squeezed it.</p>
<p>“Dumbledore, you’re not coming in,” Lyall told the wizard, blocking the door with his body. “I know why you’re here and I must say no. It’s not happening. It can’t.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” Albus questioned. “The boy is coming of age, and I know of his condition. I don’t see any problem, just a need for a few precautions.”</p>
<p>“Lyall, what is he talking about?” Hope insisted. Lyall sighed.</p>
<p>“He wants to take Remus to Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Remus asked. “Cool! Am I allowed?”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you go read your book, Honey?” Hope turned and sent her son into the living room, giving him a book to read and making sure he was bundled up under a blanket in front of the fireplace. The last thing the boy needed was to get sick from the cold air blowing around, especially with the next full moon coming in only a few days.</p>
<p>“Why don’t I come in and talk to you about it?” Albus asked Lyall, who began to protest, then sighed, moving out of the way to admit the old wizard. </p>
<p>“I suppose,” He muttered, then took Hope aside to talk to her in hushed tones. While he did so, Albus sat next to Remus, who seemed to be absorbed in a book.</p>
<p>“They don’t want me to leave,” He murmured after a few moments. “They’re afraid I may hurt somebody. They just want to make sure I’m safe.”</p>
<p>“I know about your condition-”</p>
<p>“That I’m a werewolf?” Remus interrupted, looking up from his book. “I know. I heard you say. So why do you want me to come to your school? I’m dangerous.”</p>
<p>Albus stayed quiet for a few beats, then glanced at the little boy at his side. “Do you know how to play Gobstones?” He asked. Remus nodded. “Would you like to play? I’m afraid I haven’t been able to find a good partner in quite some time.” Remus nodded again and Albus pulled a small cloth bag from somewhere in his robes. Five minutes later, Hope and Lyall finished their conversation to find Albus and Remus engrossed in their game. It was an odd sight: a ninety year old man playing a child’s game with an eleven year old. The usually quiet boy was chattering excitedly to the old man, who was holding the conversation with him as if he was an adult, not a child.</p>
<p>“Albus,” Lyall interrupted the two after a bit. “May we discuss the reason for your visit?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course, Lyall,” Albus replied then turned to Remus. “I must say, you’re a very good player. The best I’ve played with in a long time.” The boy beamed.</p>
<p>“Remus, go to your room for a moment please,” Lyall told his son as Albus stood up. Remus finished rolling the stones into their bag, handed them to Albus, then left the room, obeying his father. Not quite, though. He stopped at the turn in the stairs, where he knew he wouldn’t be seen.</p>
<p>“Albus, you know we can’t send him to Hogwarts,” Lyall started. “He’s in danger. He is a danger. He could hurt anybody. We’re able to contain him because we’ve established so many spells over where we keep him every moon. You’ve not had to deal with that before.”</p>
<p>Remus’ heart dropped. His father had told him he was dangerous, but it always hurt to hear him say it.</p>
<p>“Actually, Lyall,” Albus replied. “I’ve already taken precautions and am putting them up right now. We’re planting a Whomping Willow to disguise a tunnel to a small building that will be built for Remus’ transformations. This will provide him a safe place to do so, and I will charm it so he cannot leave the building until the morning. Our healer, Poppy Pomfrey, will escort him to and from the building and treat any wounds he may suffer. Your son will be in very competent hands, I guarantee you.”</p>
<p>“How do you know he won’t be hurt by anybody who finds out?” Hope asked. “The prejudice against werewolves is outrageous and I don’t want Remus to be hurt by frightened classmates.”</p>
<p>“A worthy fear, Mrs. Lupin,” Albus told her. “We will go to great lengths to ensure that Remus’ condition is not discovered. Only the head of his house, Madam Pomfrey, and I will know unless it becomes necessary to extend that knowledge to anybody else. Professors McGonagall, Sprout, Flitwick, and Slughorn are all trustworthy, I believe that they would never  wittingly release the secret of Remus’ condition unless I asked them to. There will be the problem of explaining to his friends why he vanishes every month, but I am sure that Remus will be able to do it. He is a smart boy, after all, and he does deserve to have as normal of a life as we can give him.”</p>
<p>Hope nodded. “I believe that will be okay, then. He does deserve to feel at least a little normal, doesn’t he?”</p>
<p>Lyall sighed softly. “I suppose the final decision is not up to us, is it, Hope?” He then raised his voice a bit. “You can come down, Remus.”</p>
<p>The ten year old emerged from the stairs.</p>
<p>“How would you like to go to Hogwarts?” His father asked him.</p>
<p>“Can I?” Remus responded, his eyes lighting up a bit as he looked to Albus, who nodded.</p>
<p>“We already have plans to keep you as safe as possible, and I believe that you will be a wonderful student.”</p>
<p>Surprising everyone, Remus ran to Albus and wrapped the man in a tight hug in a show of energy that he hadn’t had since he was bit. “Thank you, Professor Dumbledore!” He cried, his voice choked up a bit. Albus returned the hug, grinning a bit. Eventually, Remus pulled away, a huge smile on his face, tears glimmering in his green eyes. Albus pulled a piece of parchment from his robes and set it on the table. </p>
<p>“These are all the materials you will need at Hogwarts,” He told the family. “You can get them all on Diagon Alley, at any point in time from now until the end of August. I would recommend getting things over the summer, as then you may be able to meet other young witches and wizards your age. It’s a bit early to go shopping right now, especially as the letters haven’t been sent out yet.”</p>
<p>Lyall took one look at Remus and knew that this was the best decision he’d made for his son in a long time. “Thank you, Albus,” He murmured.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The smile stayed on Remus’ face until his next transformation.</p>
