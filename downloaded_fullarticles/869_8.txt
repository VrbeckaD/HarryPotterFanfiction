    <p>Blue was a colour that actually suited Draco Malfoy very well. It made the grey in his eyes pop out even more than usually and it emphasized the cool undertones of his skin, giving the impression of Veela blood running through his family. The soft edge of the expensive looking cashmere wool pullover caressed his throat and chin, surrounding him with an aura of luxury. His long pale fingers tended to touch his sleeves whenever he was nervous but trying his best to hide it. He looked gorgeous.</p><p> </p><p>On any other occasion there would have been nothing else on Harry’s mind than to slide his fingers under the beautiful fabric, touching the exclusive skin in that forbidden area right where the pair of trousers loosely clung to the hipbones. Oh, he loved that sensitive part of Draco’s body. But this was definitely not the time to think about ravishing your boyfriend. Not as long as the latter was in the kitchen joking with Molly Weasley while helping her prepare the legendary Weasley Christmas Punch.</p><p> </p><p>Nobody was allowed to go anywhere near her when she did her “magic”. The recipe for the sweet but strong liquor drink was a secret better protected than anything inside Gringotts and still there they were, happily discussing the amount of piment and how to improve the taste even more while from time to time looking into his direction and cackling together. Harry was not ready for this! Draco Malfoy dressed in a decent “I hope your mother likes me”-pullover happily chatting with Molly Weasley in her very own kitchen while they were preparing drinks for the annual Weasley Christmas dinner was too much for him. However, he seemed to be the only one who cared, the others were busy preparing the house for the evening.</p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p>In the first place he had not even intended on asking Draco to accompany him. This between them was brand new and it would have felt strange to force his boyfriend into spending Christmas with his family when the term “boyfriend” still felt kind of weird whenever he thought about it. Weird, but in a good way, like a new sensation, similar to the nervous tingle he still got whenever he was kissing Draco or when they were making out. There was something oddly pleasing about knowing he was allowed to call the other man something he had never been before. Draco Malfoy was not only his first boyfriend; this was also true the other way around. Something which made Harry grin like a mad man whenever he thought about it.</p><p> </p><p>They had been together for about two months when the owl had arrived. It was neatly addressed directly to Draco, not like the ones before that simply had asked Harry if he had a plus one for Christmas. Not that their relationship was a secret. They had been out from the very beginning and maybe that had helped his family to accept it very fast. Draco was willing to commit to him, it was obvious. If this commitment however included a family dinner at the Burrow was a totally different question; one Harry had not intended to ask this soon.</p><p> </p><p>Molly Weasley on the other hand had definitely planned to do so. Her letter was more of an invitation card. Nothing alike the ones Harry had seen on Draco’s bedroom wall. Actually, the former Slytherin tended to have a bit of a nostalgic spleen as he was saving each and every invitation he went to. They were all pinned on top of each other above Draco’s desk. The ones he did not care to attend usually landed directly in the trash bin.</p><p> </p><p>Harry had assumed that this would also happen to the card by Molly when it had arrived. Draco seemed to be rather confused when he received the envelop and turned his back towards Harry while reading it. He could only assume it was the invitation because of the owl which had brought it and automatically was sure it would end in the bin. Imagine how shook he was when a grinning Draco had pinned it on top of the other invitations, throwing away the invitation for the Great Christmas Dinner from the Society of Queer Witches and Wizards instead.</p><p> </p><p>Immediately after that he had started to ramble through his closet for suitable clothes for the event mumbling to himself that he definitely needed to fire call Pansy for advice on proper outfit choice as soon as she was back in England. He genuinely seemed to be looking forward to accompany Harry. On Christmas. To the Burrow. Our favourite Gryffindor had used his boyfriend’s distraction to take a closer look at the invitation.</p><p>In Molly’s simple but beautiful and practical handwriting she had addressed Draco as if they had been close friends for quite a while. As if their families had not been enemies for a long time.</p><p align="center">
  <em>Dear Draco,</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>As Harry obviously seemed to think it wasn't necessary to answer my inquiry about your attendance at our annual Christmas Dinner I decided it would be best to address you directly, dear.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>If you do not have other plans, I would hereby love to invite you into our home for a joyful evening including dinner, the famous Weasley Christmas Punch and embarrassing childhood stories about your boyfriend.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Don’t feel the need to answer this invitation. When I do not get a response, I will assume to see you on Christmas Eve.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>All the best to my boys and tell Harry he hurt my feelings by being too ashamed to bring his partner to our family Christmas by himself.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>~ Molly W.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>P:S.: Dear Ginny told me to inform you the dress code for the occasion was festive casual, whatever this is supposed to mean. I hope you like blue!</em>
