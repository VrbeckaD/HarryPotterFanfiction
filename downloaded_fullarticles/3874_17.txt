    <p>January 15, 1979</p><p>Severus Snape was sitting on an old, patched sofa reading the Daily Prophet with only the light of a lumos when he heard a frantic knocking at the door. He was not expecting company to say the least. Grunting a bit, he lifts himself from his chair and walks towards the door.</p><p>Severus was not the type of person to allow strangers into his home. He also wasn’t one for windows. Looking through the peephole, he only needed to see a few strands of that familiar, fiery red hair to recognize his surprise visitor. It was someone who he had not had contact with for years.</p><p>Severus reached for the door handle and slowly turned it. He would never mention it to anyone, but he was slightly confused and nervous for this visitor. </p><p>“Lily, what are you---”, his greeting was interrupted by a rapid and tear-soaked embrace. Shocked by this embrace after being ignored for years by this individual, he returned the embrace. However, his question remained unasked and unanswered and Severus was not a patient man. He mentioned for his friend to take a seat on his sofa.</p><p>“Sev, I’m really sorry to just show up like this. James and I got into this huge fight and I just couldn’t take it anymore!” Severus did not know how to take this news and he had not heard his childhood nickname, Sev, for years. He had read James and Lily’s engagement announcement in the Prophet just a few weeks prior, and now they are having problems that result in Lily fleeing her fiancé? Fleeing to someone who he was sure that she hated? Severus was again dumbfounded. </p><p>“I’m sorry you are having troubles Lily.” Severus was lost for words so the fact that he managed to say that truly surprised him. “Would you like some tea?”. Severus did not often play the role of host, but this poor girl had been standing outside in the cold January air for who knows how long. Lily gave a slight nod and Severus took to his kitchen to make some tea the muggle way.</p><p>Severus did not know why he chose to make tea the muggle way. He had not made tea the muggle way in years, not since he figured out he could get away with using magic. It was not as easy for Lily to get away with using magic at home during school breaks since she was the only magical one in her house so she was raised on the muggle way. Clearly Lily was seeking childhood comforts and Severus wanted to take this opportunity to mend his faulty relationship with the only person he had ever loved. Severus was taking baby steps to hopefully become Lily’s best friend once again. </p><p>The kettle began to scream, indicating that the water had been properly boiled, and Severus poured the water into two mismatched tea cups and brought them back into the living room and set the cups on the coffee table. Severus noticed that Lily was shivering, probably because he preferred to keep his home inhumanly cold, so he transfigured her a blanket out of a tea cozy.</p><p>Unknowing how to approached what he would refer to as “girl drama” and not wanting to cross any lines, he simply told Lily that she could stay at his home for as long as she wanted and that he would transfigure the second bedroom into a temporary guest bedroom for her. In return, she gave Severus a small smile, a smile that he hadn’t seen in a long time. Not too many people smiled at Severus much anymore.</p><p>“That sounds really nice, Sev. Too nice considering how I’ve treated you these past few years. I’m really sorry for not accepting your numerous apologies or answering your letters. It really was an unfortunate circumstance for both of us and I hope we can move past it.” Mentioning their fifth year incident brought back painful flashbacks for Severus. He had spent years trying to forget that moment to no avail. What little recovery he had had from that wound was suddenly opened again by Lily’s apologetic knife.</p><p>“Lily, I was wrong to say that word and I was wrong to treat you the way I did and I was wrong to associate with those people! I realize that you want to move past this but I cannot!” Severus had begun to raise his voice at Lily, just as he had in their fifth year and he immediately turned his head away from her realizing his mistake.</p><p>“Sev, it is not too late to change how you act or who you associate with. You’re only nineteen. We are a year out of Hogwarts--”</p><p>“No, Lily. The damage has already been done. I shouldn’t do this, but if you want to suddenly be my friend or whatever, you need to know. No one else can know.” With that, Severus lifted his sleeve to show Lily the Mark that she needed to see. To his surprise, she was not.</p><p>“Severus, I figured as much. Everyone other Slytherin that was in your year is a known Death Eater. However, you’re different. I know you Sev, you are not in this for the same reasons they are. Your heart is in a different place.”</p><p>“Enough, Lily!” He tried to hold back yelling, he really did but he did not like talking about himself, especially with someone who his people would refer to as an enemy. He was contempt with who he was and was not about to change himself for anyone. Lily shifted a few inches away from him, afraid of what else could come out of his outburst. “Lily, I didn't mean to yell, I just don’t like talking about this.”</p><p>“That’s okay, Sev. At least you are honest with me. I cannot say the same for James. That’s why we got into this huge fight.” Severus perked up while hearing this, silently asking to hear more. “James has not been necessarily truthful in our relationship. And worst of all, I heard this news from Remus! Apparently all four of them went out for drinks after the Lancashire and Yorkshire regional championships at the Leaky Cauldron. My friend Mary from Hogwarts, you remember her, well, she’s waitressing there and apparently she and James checked out a room! So of course I’m upset because James and I discussed waiting to have sex until our wedding night, but I guess he can’t follow my one request! I was going to tell Mary myself that she can have him because I don’t want him anymore, but she has tonight off.”</p><p>“So let me guess, Lily. You came here, to see me, because you wanted to vent to someone who has always hated Potter and sees right through his bullshit?” Lily nodded.</p><p>“And for something else. Revenge.”</p><p>Sensing where she was going with this and not wanting to follow along, Severus responded, “I’m going to go transfigure that bed now. Clearly you are not thinking straight. How much have you had to drink tonight?”</p><p>“I haven’t had a single drop.” With that, she leaned into Severus and kissed him. That kiss soon turned into multiples and Severus couldn’t stop himself. “So what do you say, Sev? Will you help me take revenge on James?” Severus responded by picking her up and taking her upstairs.</p><p>“Lily, I’ll always be here for you. Always.”</p>
