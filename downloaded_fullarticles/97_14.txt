    <p>Tom Riddle sat in his chair in the corner. The walls around him were chipped and cracking. He watched as the old door creaked open and two men walked in.</p>
<p>The first man had a beard.  He remembered this man.  He said his name was albus.</p>
<p>The second man was new.  He was tall, so tall he had to duck under the frame to get in the room.  He was slender, and his handsome face was lined by two strips of black hair that fell in his face.  The rest of his hair was pulled back into a neat bun.  His blue eyes glimmered like ice in the sun and had a twinkle of mischief in them.  He wore a long black robe with shiny silver buttons that went up to his neck and down to his ankles.  His boots were black and laced up to the ankle, but the didnt have a heel on them, showing just how tall this man really was.  His hands were covered by black gloves.  The only amount of pale skin you could see on his was his face and ears, which had two silver studs in the lobe.  Tom wasnt even sure if this was a man at all. </p>
<p>The person smiled at the young boy and moved past Albus.  He almost knocked the poor man down.  He reached the chair and sat back on his knees.  Even then, he was much taller than the little boy.  He gave the child a warm smile and sat his gloved hands on his knees.</p>
<p>"Hello Tom.  My name is Landren.  Albus here tells me you're a very special little boy."  His voice was deep and smooth.  Given the right  tone, it was a voice that could sooth (or strike fear into) the hearts of any person who cared to listen.</p>
<p>"All the other kids say I'm strange."  Tom started to look down, but his gaze was pulled back up by a hooked finger under his chin.</p>
<p>"That's not very nice of them.  I take it you dont like it here."  Tom shook his head, his eyes never leaving the adult's.</p>
<p> "What would you say if I offered to take you away from this place?  You could come live with me."  Tom's little eyes opened wide.  He searched Landren's face to see if he was lieing, but he couldnt find any trace of a fib in his ice-like eyes.</p>
<p>"You would really take me away from here?"</p>
<p>"Far away.  You would never have to see these chipped walls ever again,  never have to be around all the mean workers and children.  You would be my beloved son, if you would like."  Tears flooded the little boy's eyes as he launched himself at the grown up infront of him.  He wrapped his small arms around his neck and let out a sob.  The man smiled and picked up the child, holding him securely in his arms.  He rubbed Tom's back to help with the child calm his full body sobs.</p>
<p>"It's alright Tom.  You're safe now.  I have you.  It will all be over soon.  You're safe now."  He stood there and swayed with the child for a few minutes.  Tom's sobs finally slowed down after a few minutes of them jsut standing in the center of the room, Landren swaying and whispering soothing words into his hair.</p>
<p>"Now, is there anything you want to take with you?  You can pack up while I go do all the paperwork I need to be able to take you home with me."  He shook his head wildly, clinging tighter to the giant that held him.  Landren chuckled and held him closer. </p>
<p>"Alright.  You can stay right here in my arms.  I wont let you go."  He ducked back under the door, Albus following close behind.  He hadn't said a word this whole time and, secretly, Landren was glad for it (he only tolerated Albus Dumbledore when he ABSOLUTELY had to).  He walked up to the counter with Tom still in his arms.  The woman looked up.</p>
<p>"How can I...help...you...?"  She looked up, mouth agape at how tall the man was.</p>
<p>"I need to fill out some paperwork to take a child home please."</p>
<p>"Which child sir?"</p>
<p>"Tom Riddle."  Her jaw dropped even further, not wanting to believe what she was hearing.</p>
<p>"Are you sure?  I can set you up with another child who would be far more...normal."  Tom whined and clung tighter to his new guardian's neck, the tears starting back fresh.  Landren rubbed his back and turned to whisper in his ear.</p>
<p>"Sh.  It's alright little one.  I'm not letting you go.  I told you I wanted YOU to be my child.  No one else."  He turned his gaze to the woman, his blue eyes piercing her soul like a thousand daggers.  His voice cut into her soul and froze her heart.</p>
<p>"I would like the paperwork for Tom Riddle.  Now."  She nodded and quickly pulled out the needed files.  Landren made quick work of signing everything.  Once he was finished, he didnt even wait for the woman to speak.  He just walked out.  He didn't care if Albus followed him out of not.  All he cared about was getting the crying boy in his arms to his little cottage.  That's all he needed to do.  From now on his son was his first priority.</p>
