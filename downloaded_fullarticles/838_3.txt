    <p>Chapter One.      </p><p> </p><p>    Aneleisa Fortier closed the book in front of her. The man sitting beside her took no notice, given that he was engrossed in his own reading. Not, of course, that she’d expected him to notice her, as she was only another passenger on the same airplane as dozens of others.   </p><p>     She looked out her window at the vast Atlantic Ocean. <em>‘America’</em> she thought. That was the place she was leaving behind, along with her happiest memories of childhood. London was her destination, and, she supposed, her new home. There lived her mother’s parents, Monica and Reginald Hart.</p><p>       Aneleisa’s parents had been killed in a bank robbery that went bad. That had been three months ago, and the ensuing chaos had been awful. There had been the legal proceedings—Aneleisa’s parents hadn’t left a will, and her aunt had tried to take custody of her (unsuccessfully)—and the fact that she still had three months of school left. Her grandparents had solved that problem by sending a member of their staff overseas to care for the little girl.</p><p>      Aneleisa had eyed the tall Englishwoman suspiciously upon her arrival, but Lena Ives had swiftly proven herself a warm and efficient caretaker. It was Lena Ives who sat on her other side in the large airplane cabin. She was already asleep, having told her ten-year-old charge that that she could finish her book but then had to go to sleep.</p><p>        Yawning slightly, Aneleisa pulled the blanket from beneath her seat and went to sleep. Waking up abruptly as the stewardess announced that the flight attendants were serving breakfast, Aneleisa rubbed the sleep from her eyes and glanced at Lena, who was already awake and enjoying an omelette.</p><p>     “Have we arrived in London?” Aneleisa asked.</p><p> “Almost, Love. About ten more minutes. Muffin?” Lena offered.</p><p dir="ltr">      “Thanks.” Aneleisa looked out of the window next to Lena and took in the early morning fog. Fog was something that she loved, a trait inherited from her English mother, Rose. Her father had preferred sunny days and stormy nights, and while his daughter had held the latter opinion, she disagreed with the former. Feeling slightly melancholy at the recollection, Aneleisa blinked rapidly and focused on her muffin. </p><p dir="ltr">     Exiting the airport, Aneleisa looked at Lena.</p><p dir="ltr">     “Where are our things?” She asked, as they only had their carry-ons, and she had checked all the rest of her things.</p><p dir="ltr">     “Your grandparents arranged for a porter to load them into the car already. There they are.” Lena pointed to an elegant elderly couple standing with a sign that read <em>Welcome to London, Aneleisa!</em></p><p dir="ltr">      Grinning, the little girl ran to them, and was swept up in their arms, joyful greetings spilling from their lips.</p><p dir="ltr">    “I’m so glad that you’re here with us, darling.” Gran said, a slight wobble in her voice. “Your parents would have wanted you here.”</p><p dir="ltr">    Aneleisa nodded, a few tears rising to her eyes, but her grandfather wiped them away gently.</p><p dir="ltr">    “It’s alright now, we’ve got you.” Grandad said. Turning to Lena, he said. “Thank you, Lena, we can tell you took very good care of her. Shall we go?”</p><p dir="ltr">    “I think so, sir, and it was no trouble at all, 'Leisa is a delightful little girl. Though there is something I think I ought to tell you later.” She finished with a hushed tone to Aneleisa’s grandmother.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">       It wasn’t long before Aneleisa had settled into her new home, and by the end of the next fortnight, it was as though she had always lived in London. She loved to get up early and watch the fog, run in the garden when it rained, and sit in the library while her grandfather read to her all her favorite stories. There were still nights when she cried for her parents, but they grew fewer and fewer as time went on.</p><p dir="ltr">      One day, Lena Ives went to speak with Monica. “I wanted to wait until she was settled in to tell you this, ma’am, but I think I ought to tell you now.” Lena said apologetically. Monica frowned.</p><p dir="ltr">      “What is it? Was there an issue while you were in Rhode Island?”</p><p dir="ltr">     “Not precisely. Tell me, what grade do you think Leisa will be in next fall?”</p><p dir="ltr">      “Fifth, why?” Monica asked. Lena sighed.</p><p dir="ltr">     “Well, at school they put her with the calculus and honors history courses, and in her spare time, she likes to study the classics of literature. One morning, I saw her reading The Prince. When I asked her why, she engaged me in a discussion on how to properly rule a state. I’m not saying that it’s developmentally inappropriate, she still has many of the interests and whims of a girl her age, it’s just that she’s brilliant.” Monica stared.</p><p dir="ltr">     “You mean to tell me that my granddaughter, who turns eleven tomorrow, would fit better intellectually with people almost ten years her senior?”</p><p dir="ltr">     Lena nodded grimly. “And I think that her intellect should be encouraged, otherwise she might feel ...separated from us. Have you picked a school for her yet?”</p><p dir="ltr">      Monica shook her head. “I suppose it might be better if we found some establishment for gifted children then. I shall discuss it with Reggie. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Lena.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">      Aneleisa was in the garden, the next day, contemplating the passage of time. She was eleven now, and that meant that she was one year older, but also that her parents would never see what she was like when she was eleven. Still, she felt generally happy, and knew that any minute, she would go inside and have a special breakfast with her, before they would go out into the city and do all her favorite things. She relayed this to the snake she was holding.</p><p dir="ltr">     For as long as she could remember, she had been able to speak with snakes. Realizing that this was probably a little strange, she encouraged adults who saw her communicating with the reptiles to think it was simply a flight of childish whimsy. To further enhance this, she would tell the snakes stories about fairies and dragons. The snakes found this amusing, and humored her desire to obfuscate her strange ability.</p><p dir="ltr">    <em>‘And will the Mistress tell us more stories later?’</em> The snake asked. This one was a bit younger, and loved stories, especially ones with dragons.</p><p dir="ltr">   Aneleisa laughed. <em>`If I have time, I promise.’</em> She said.</p><p dir="ltr">   “'Leisa, are you hissing with the snakes again? Come inside darling, it looks like you have mail.” Aneleisa heard her grandmother say.</p><p dir="ltr">     Aneleisa stood up and brushed the dirt from her skirt. Skipping inside, she hopped up onto a kitchen stool in front of which there was a thick parchment envelope with the address in emerald ink. It read:     </p><p dir="ltr" align="center">
  <strong><em>HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY</em> </strong>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="center">
  <em>Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore</em>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="center">
  <em> (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)</em>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="center">
  <em> Dear Miss Fortier, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="center">
  <em> Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="center">
  <em>       Yours sincerely,</em>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="center">
  <em> Minerva McGonagall</em>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="center">Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">              Aneleisa laughed. “I get it, this is a joke for my birthday, we’ll go all around town to buy ‘magic’ things, and then come home for dinner, is that it?” Her grandparents stared at her blankly.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">        “Er.. what?” Grandad asked. Aneleisa’s smile faded.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">        “You mean ...you and Gran didn’t send this?” She frowned, handing it to him. Her grandparents perused the letter, faces contorting in confusion. Just then, the doorbell rang.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     “Would you get that, Lena?” Gran asked distractedly. Lena wordlessly rose and went to the door. A moment later, she returned, followed by a tall woman in emerald green robes.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">      “Mr. and Mrs. Hart, I presume?” The woman said, a strong Scottish accent revealing itself. “My name is Minerva McGonagall, and I am here to discuss your granddaughter’s future. May I sit down?”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">      Aneleisa stared. “Ma’am, is this some kind of a joke? Magic isn’t real, and somehow I doubt the existence of wizards.” Minerva McGonagall sat down anyway and spoke.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">       “Tell me; has anything strange ever happened when you felt a particularly strong emotion? Anything inexplicable that you’ve always been able to do?” Aneleisa looked down uncomfortably.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">      “Mama always said whenever I cried as a baby, it started raining outside. Is that what you mean?” The tall woman nodded.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">      Reggie broke in. “If you think that I am going to send my granddaughter to some unknown establishment just because you say that she’s a witch, especially when you’ve given us no proof, you have to be out of your wits.” He said coldly.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     “I have every intention of proving my bona fides.” McGonagall said calmly. “If you will direct your attention to the flowers over there?” The startled group followed her pointed finger. She then took out a long, slender stick; a wand, if Aneleisa had to guess. Muttering something beneath her breath, McGonagall swished her wand at the vase, and the flowers turned to butterflies, which fluttered towards them before returning to the base and becoming flowers again.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     “Does that provide sufficient proof?” McGonagall asked dryly. “If I might continue, Hogwarts is a prestigious magical establishment, and has produced some of the finest wizards and witches in the world. Our headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, is perhaps one of the greatest wizards ever to live. Should you choose to enroll Miss Fortier in the school, she shall receive the finest magical education in Europe.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">   “However, I feel that I ought to warn you that the detriments of not enrolling her in any sort of magical school would be severe, both to her potential, and to her sanity. Magical children whose abilities are not trained can become something called an Obscurial, wherein their abilities explode out of them violently and beyond their control. I implore you not to allow this to occur.” She finished with a warning glance at Aneleisa’s grandparents.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     “We believe you.” Monica said. “I believe that this establishment sounds like a healthy learning environment for Aneleisa. Is it a boarding school, or day school? And how is it that Aneleisa has these powers when neither of us do, nor did her parents?”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     McGonagall leaned back in her chair. “Occasionally it occurs that a magical child is born to a largely non-magical lineage. The simple truth is, sometimes there are non-magical children born to magical parents, called ‘squibs’. The descendents of squibs will, rarely, develop magical power despite an otherwise non-magical family.”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     Aneleisa thought for a moment. “So...what you’re saying is that somewhere I had a magical ancestor who had a non-magical child from whom I am descended?”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">    “That is correct. There are spells to determine who that magical ancestor is, should you like to find out.”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">      Aneleisa nodded. “I’d like that. Where do I get magical school things?”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     “Diagon Alley. I can accompany you, should your grandparents permit it. It is also where the wizarding bank Gringotts, is. You can have muggle money transferred into magical currency there.” McGonagall explained.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     Aneleisa looked at her grandparents questioningly.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">    “You may take her.” Reggie said after a moment’s silent discussion with his wife. “I suggest that you open an account there for her, she has money from her parents that should probably be transferred over into your currency. Would next Thursday be convenient for you?”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">      McGonagall nodded. “Quite. I shall see you then. Good day, Miss Fortier.”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left"> </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">      The next Thursday, Aneleisa dressed in what she hoped would be respectable, if not perhaps ideal, garb; a pearl grey blouse and deep green slacks with a matching blazer.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left"><em>     If it was good enough for mother’s conference in D.C., it’s good enough to go school shopping in.</em> She decided.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">      Heading downstairs, she found Professor McGonagall already sitting in the living room, a cup of tea in her long fingers.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     “Ah, Miss Fortier, lovely to see you again. Shall we be going then? We’ve quite a few items to procure, and we had best be off early.” McGonagall said.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">      Aneleisa inclined her head politely. “I think so, let me just speak with my grandparents for a moment.” She said. Exiting the room, she quickly found her grandparents, and a few words later, she was being handed off to the Professor with a cheerful ‘goodbye’ and a smoothie pressed into her hand by Lena. Following the tall woman out into the street, Aneleisa turned to McGonagall, and asked.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">       “Professor? How do we get to Diagon Alley?”</p><p dir="ltr">      “We use the enterance through the Leaky Cauldron. It’s an inn and pub, and the school is on good terms with the bartender, Tom.” McGonagall replied, turning a corner.</p><p dir="ltr">     Aneleisa, though tall for her age, still had to hurry to catch up with her guide. “Are there any books on wizarding culture that you would recommend? I’d like to be as culturally literate as possible upon arrival, I wouldn’t want to come accross as ignorant.” Aneleisa said.</p><p dir="ltr">     “I would reccomend asking the proprietors of Flourish and Blott’s, the book shop. Here we are.” McGonagall said briskly, holding open the door to what appeared to be a somewhat dingy bar.</p><p dir="ltr">     Aneleisa surreptitiously glanced around, hoping to notice what sort of norms existed among the patrons. They were mostly wearing long robes m, though the styles differed greatly, and a few wore pointed hats. But there was also a large portion of the crowd in clothing not so dissimilar from her own, if still generally long enough to sweep the floor. A toothless old man grinned at them, and said.</p><p dir="ltr">     “Another for Hogwarts, Professor?”</p><p dir="ltr">     “Indeed, Tom. We’ll be making use of the courtyard, of course.” McGonagall said. Entering a small back yard, Aneleisa watched in fascination as the professor withdrew her wand and tapped several bricks in succession. Memorizing the pattern for later use, she followed McGonagall out into a bustling market street.</p><p dir="ltr">      Aneleisa gazed at the view in wonder. Though certainly the overall picture was that of a street lined with shops, the medium was unlike anything she had ever seen before; vibrant colors, exotic-looking wares, animals and bright, eye-catching displays of magical items for sale. Professor McGonagall indulged in a wry smile, before hurrying Aneleisa off to the bank. Upon entering the building, Aneleisa was impressed by the grandeur and majesty of the reception hall, and noticed peculiar creatures sitting at the desks. Tugging on the sleeve of McGonagall’s emerald green robes, Aneleisa asked quietly.</p><p dir="ltr">       “Who are the people at the desks? They don’t look...human.”</p><p dir="ltr">       “Those are Goblins, and they tend to be rather easily offended, so kindly let me do the talking.” McGonagall replied with equal softness. Marching up to one of the desks, McGonagall addressed the goblin occupying it.</p><p dir="ltr">       “Orlick, I have a new student looking to open an account at Gringotts. Will you kindly facilitate the transfer of her Muggle funds into standard currency?” She said briskly. The goblin peered down at Aneleisa, his beady black eyes scrutinizing her.</p><p dir="ltr">        “Yes.” He said abruptly. “If she will give us the account number and name of her muggle bank.” Aneleisa rattled off the information mechanically. Orlick picked up a bizarre implement, whispered into it, and then inserted it into a suit on his desk.</p><p dir="ltr">         “Everything seems to be in order.” He said. “Your name, child?”</p><p dir="ltr">        “Aneleisa Isolt Fortier, sir.” The girl answered politely. “How does the withdrawal process work?”</p><p dir="ltr">       “Knickpex will take you down to your vault now, here is your key.” Orlick replied, motioning to another goblin. Aneleisa and McGonagall followed their goblin guide down to a small cart. Eying it dubiously, Aneleisa tentatively sat down, securing herself as best she could.</p><p dir="ltr">       “Hold on tight.” Knickpex said.</p><p dir="ltr">        With that, the cart lurched forward with ludicrous speed, nearly stealing Aneleisa’s breath from her lungs. Just as abruptly, they stopped.</p><p dir="ltr">        “Vault 2216, registered under the name Aneleisa Isolt Fortier. Your key?” He said. Wordlessly, Aneleisa handed it over.</p><p dir="ltr">      The goblin hopped out of the cart and inserted the key, opening the vault. Aneleisa followed Professor McGonagall into the vault, eyes widening at the impressively substantial piles of gold, silver, and bronze. McGonagall helped her heap the appropriate amounts of each into a provided money bag, explaining the value of each kind as she went. She left to inspect the cart.</p><p dir="ltr">     “Now,” Knickpex said. “The bag will refill automatically if you speak the password to it as well as the desired number of galleons, sickles, or knuts. Would you like to set the password now?”</p><p dir="ltr">    Aneleisa nodded, and said. “Julie Hart Fortier. I would like that to be the password.” It was her late mother’s name.</p><p dir="ltr">     McGonagall stepped back into the vault. “Knickpex, if you have finished with Miss Fortier, we have much to purchase today, and it would be prudent to start sooner rather than later." </p><p dir="ltr">    Knickpex nodded, and soon the three were again hurtling down the corridors. As it came to yet another lurching halt, Aneleisa stepped out, thanked the goblin, and stepped back into the light, blinking slightly as her eyes adjusted.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">    Exiting the apothecary,  with scales, phials, and a telescope, Aneleisa turned to McGonagall, and said.</p><p dir="ltr">    "Shall we get the cauldron next? I think the shop is right there." At the tall witch's permissive nod, Aneleisa almost skipped into the shop. Despite herself and everything that had occurred, she was having fun. </p><p dir="ltr">    After the cauldron came Madame Malkin's, where Aneleisa ended up purchasing not only the required clothing for school, but also two nicer sets of what were called 'dress robes' at the recommendation of Professor McGonagall. To Aneleisa, they essentially looked like formal muggle dresses except with some sort of sheer over-layer that accompanied them. One was in dark green, to match Aneleisa's eyes, and the other was regal indigo. </p><p dir="ltr">    At Flourish and Blotts, Aneleisa quickly found all her books, and then took the Professor's suggestion of asking the proprietors for some recommendations of books on wizarding history and culture. By the end of it, she had <em>A History of Magic, </em>by Bathilda Bagshot, <em>Modern Magical History,  A Complete Guide to Wizarding Society, </em>Volumes I and II, which dealt with both ordinary and high society, and finally, <em>The Comportment and Behavior of the Well-Bred Witch, </em>by Leticia Runcorn. McGonagall had  supported this selection, citing the prejudice Aneleisa could very well face 'from some of the less-enlightened members of the wizarding world' as she had put it, adding that if Aneleisa could completely bend in, she would probably have fewer problems.</p><p dir="ltr">   Aneleisa pondered this as they walked to the wand shop, Ollivander's. On a certain level, it made her angry that such prejudices existed in the magical world, but there was a part of her that took it as....a challenge. In fact, by the time they had reached the shop's door, Aneleisa had made a vow to herself that she would lead a personal crusade to bring the 'purebloods' as McGonagall had termed them, to see things from her perspective. Afterall, what was the use of her massive intellect if not to enlighten others? She thought with mild sarcasm.</p><p dir="ltr">   Entering the store, Aneleisa's initial thought was of how <em>messy </em>the place was. Everywhere, on almost every surface were long, thin boxes which she assumed held wands. Suddenly, Aneleisa became aware of a tall, thin man observing her. Unflinching, she met his gaze.</p><p dir="ltr">    "Are you Mr. Ollivander, then, sir?" She asked politely, but firmly.</p><p dir="ltr">    "Indeed, Miss Fortier, that is I. Shall we proceed with the selection of your wand? But of course, the wand chooses the wizard, Miss Fortier." Ollivander said, a smile beginning to spread across his face. </p><p dir="ltr">    McGonagall had left her to her own devices briefly, citing the need to pick up a few things of her own, so Aneleisa put her purchases onto the lone chair and walked towards Ollivander. Hetook out a tape measure, and instructed her to hold out her wand arm. Assuming that he referred to her dominant hand, Aneleisa raised her right arm. Nodding slightly to himself and wandering over to the shelves, Ollivander pulled out a wand. </p><p dir="ltr">    "Applewood and dragon heartstring, a Hebridean Black, I believe. Rigidly straight, ten and a quarter inches." He said, offering her the wand. Feeling somewhat unsure, Aneleisa swished the wand slightly out of curiosity. Almost immediately, Ollivander took it back. </p><p dir="ltr">    "No, something more flexible, longer. The wood, yes, the applewood is suited to her, but the core? I could have sworn something reptilian would suit. Perhaps a different dragon." He muttered, returning with another wand.</p><p dir="ltr">    "Applewood, flexible, ten and a half inches, Ukranian Ironbelly core." This wand felt slightly more familiar to Aneleisa somehow, but Ollivander took it away again. This occurred several more times, and Aneleisa began to worry somewhat.</p><p dir="ltr">    "I wonder..." Ollivander said thoughtfully. "You are American, correct? And a Muggle-born?" Aneleisa nodded.</p><p dir="ltr">    "Is that relevant?"</p><p dir="ltr">    "Usually not. But then...I wonder." He murmured to himself, retreating into the shelves. This time he returned to her with an old, dusty box. Opening it almost reverently, he handed her a wand.</p><p dir="ltr">    "Applewood, flexible, eleven inches precisely, with a core of Horned Serpent horn. I myself did not make this wand, but it came into my possession a long time ago." </p><p dir="ltr">   Aneleisa took the wand, and immediately felt a warmth through her whole body, and thought she heard music echoing. Ollivander looked at her with some shock.</p><p dir="ltr">   "Is there something wrong?" She asked worriedly. He shook his head.</p><p dir="ltr">   "No, Miss Fortier, nothing wrong at all. It is simply that that wand was made by Isolt Sayre, Founder of Ilvermorny. Though she made many wands for her students in her lifetime, she reserved the horns for family. This one was made shortly before her death, though her children all had wands, save for her Squib daughter Martha. All had wands, as did their children, but it is said that a powerful seer told her to create one more, for the lost one, the lost one of her line who would again be found. It would seem the lost one has been found."</p>
