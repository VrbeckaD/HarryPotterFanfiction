    <p>“Kreacher,” a cold smile spread on the beautiful woman’s aged face, “Come to mistress.”</p><p>The bent, aged house elf approached his regal mistress, bowing as he came closer, “Kreacher lives to serve the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black.”</p><p>“Tell me Kreacher,” the woman paused to sip her cup of tea before straightening her perfectly styled snow white hair, “what happened on the twenty-seventh of May, nineteen-eighty-one?” She pulled out a compact and powdered her nose, “And please save the theatrics of ignorance for somebody who cares.”</p><p>“Kreacher was forbidden to speak of it,” the house elf looked terrified and deeply conflicted, “but Kreacher must obey mistress.”</p><p>“Ah,” the regent of the Noble and Most Ancient House Black got to her feet and drummed her finger tips together sinisterly, a smirk marring her beautiful face, “so there is an ‘it’, I was afraid my imagination was running away with me.”</p><p>The fear on Kreacher’s face grew as he violently shook his head, “Kreacher has said too much.”</p><p>“To the contrary,” the smile on her face matched the ominous tone in the woman’s voice, “I think you haven’t said enough.” She circled around the spot where Kreacher knelt in the middle of the Victorian drawing room, “I am the Regent of this house, the dowager Lady Black and as such my authority overrides that of all other members of this house.”</p><p>Kreacher thought for a moment, running the idea over in his mind, before deciding to go for dead, “there was a child, a boy, and I was told to kill him but a house elf cannot harm one of his masters even at the command of another master.”</p><p>“A child,” the lady pursed her lips in satisfaction, “I thought as much but if nobody knew then it must be the work of the fidelius charm rather than a confundus charm. But why?”</p><p>“A prophecy from Argyris Mopsus,” Kreacher proclaimed in a tone that was indicative of how he was pained by the burden of this secret.</p><p>“Those superstitious fools,” the Dowager Lady Black shook her head in disapproval before schooling her features as she wondered into thought, “What became of the boy after you failed to dispose of him?”</p><p>“I left him on the doorstep of some muggles,” Kreacher was fast developing a nervous twitch; the more he said, the more the twitch grew, “I’ve watched the young master growing all this time.”</p><p>“Is he at Hogwarts?” She lifted a quizzical brow as she spoke, “I can’t for the life of me understand why this child would need to be disposed of.”</p><p>“Kreacher doesn’t know if he’s at Hogwarts,” for a moment Kreacher seemed more afraid of failing his mistress than he was of speaking, “Kreacher can find out if mistress would like.”</p><p>The Dowager Lady Black smiled broadly, “Mistress would like that very much Kreacher.”</p><p>~0~</p><p>
  <em>The Previous Afternoon…</em>
</p><p>Kurt stretched his muscles as he stepped out of the plane on to the Exeter International Airport tarmac, it had been a long day of flying for both him and Finn but Finn looked fresh and invigorated- not that Kurt looked a mess- but Kurt couldn’t help the pang of jealousy as he witnessed his brother besting him at jet setting. Kurt and Finn had flown halfway around the world in less than ten hours thanks to supersonic flight, stopping in two cities on the way, but it was not without cost; Kurt’s head was left spinning as a result, on the plus side he had read that you lost one and half percent body mass when you flew west to east at great speeds.</p><p>The pair of brothers stepped into the terminal building and Finn collected their bags, “how is it that your bag is so damn heavy?” the taller boy complained, “Consistently and without fail.”</p><p>“I feel like I just spent eight weeks on another continent,” Kurt rolled his eyes, “I needed options, you know the formula.”</p><p>Finn raised a brow, “Then why would you send out your dry cleaning so often if you had four outfits for everyday?”</p><p>“I wasn’t going to put dirty clothes in my suitcase with my clean ones,” Kurt rolled his eyes, “besides, this is just casual clothes, the rest went home with Dad and Carole.”</p><p>Finn stopped dead in his tracks, blocking the path out of Arrivals, “from now on you carry your own bags. Your school trunk is at least enchanted to be light, this thing is too damn heavy.”</p><p>“That’s why it has wheels,” Kurt shook his head in disappointment.</p><p>Finn’s jaw dropped, “And all this time you’ve been letting me carry it?”</p><p>“I thought it was a personal preference,” Kurt shrugged, rolling his eyes at his brother.</p><p>Finn’s eye twitched, “I think it’s good that we’re getting sometime apart. Spending all year together was the worst idea ever, we should have let you go to South America alone.”</p><p>“Firstly, I recall you all begging me not to leave you alone with each other ever again. Secondly, we both know the only reason we’re irritable is because Harley cried the entire flight from Lima to New York,” Kurt cringed at the memory, “which is why we left them to wait for the normal flight.”</p><p>“And before that she wouldn’t stop talking,” Finn cracked his back in frustration, “For somebody with a limited vocabulary she is surprisingly chatty.”</p><p>Kurt laughed, “Now that you’ve remembered that it’s not me you're angry at.” Kurt pointed a finger over his shoulder, “there’s a ginger over there with my name written all over him.”</p><p>“Oh my gosh,” Finn gasped, “I’m on my way to Cedric, you can’t be running off with other men.”</p><p>“Firstly, he has a sign with my name on it,” Kurt cracked a smile, “Secondly, red hair means he’s probably a Weasley and I am on my way Château Weasley. Thirdly, I’m not going to cheat on Cedric Diggory with one of Ron’s brothers, that would ruin my relationship and one of my better friendships.” Kurt rolled his eyes one more time before turning away from his brother, “Goodbye Finnocence, I’ll see you tomorrow.”</p><p>“I love you,” Finn shouted at Kurt as he walked away.</p><p>Kurt smiled broadly, Kurt loved attention but Finn adored it more, “I love you too darling.”</p><p>Kurt pulled his luggage over to where young man was standing waiting for him, Kurt didn’t immediately recognise him as one of the Weasleys he knew but was able to deduce that it was one of the older brothers. This Weasley bore closer resemblance to Fred and George than he did to Ron but his hair was darker, the colour of burnt copper so rich that it almost looked brown to the untrained eye; a colour Kurt had become familiar with thanks to Carole’s substandard cooking and the countless number of pots she had destroyed. At first glance he looked to be tanned but upon further inspection revealed himself to be heavily freckled, what allowed Kurt to identify him was the burn that was healing as it crept out of his collar from his left shoulder.</p><p>Kurt smiled and extended a friendly hand, “Hi, I’m Kurt Hummel, and you must be Charles.”</p><p>“Charlie. They told you I’d be coming, great,” Charlie gave Kurt a lopsided smile and sweeping glance before nodding toward the door, “it’s nice to know some of Ron’s friends are real.”</p><p>“No, they just told me somebody would be here when I got here,” Charlie raised a curious brow as he shook Kurt’s hand, “I knew you were Charlie because he works with dragons and you got yourself burned which means you can’t be Bill because he’s responsible and focused, too focused for such carelessness.”</p><p>“Wow,” Charlie chuckled, beckoning Kurt to follow him, “Ron was not joking, you’re an ice cold bitch. He tried to warn me but I thought you were imaginary based on the other things he’d told me about you so I didn’t listen.”</p><p>Kurt pursed his lips in contemplation as he gave the young man a once over; he wore distressed jeans, too many layers under his bomber jacket, he had sparse facial hair that was a paler copper than his hair and as for his hair, it went too far past the top of his ears for Kurt’s liking, “you look like you're full of shit, listen to music that you think most people haven’t heard of and believe yourself to be too smart to take yourself seriously.” Kurt pursed his lips in satisfaction, “I shall call you Hipster Weasley.”</p><p>Charlie chuckled at Kurt’s assessment of him as he led the boy through a sparsely filled parking lot, he didn’t struggle with Kurt’s bag as Finn had but rather took it in stride. When they’d come to a remote part of the parking lot, hidden from the view of most, Hipster Weasley extended his hand toward Kurt. Kurt looked at the hand, “you're supposed to take it.”</p><p>“I know what I’m supposed to do with it,” Kurt rolled his eyes, “but I think the callouses on your hand cut me when I was shaking it, you hold the knife by the blade once, then next time you use the handle.” Kurt weaved his arm around Charlie’s elbow so that they were side by side and arm in arm like he and Hermione often were, “shall we?”</p><p>“Why of course,” Charlie gave a lopsided grin. There was a familiar tugging feeling in the pit of Kurt’s stomach and a distinct pop as they apparited away. Kurt was thrown for a loop when he didn’t hit solid ground but rather found himself hanging from the edge of a very tall narrow building by the arm he had hooked around Charlie’s arm, “whoops, if only I were as responsible and focused as Bill, maybe I would have been able to apparite properly and accurately.”</p><p>“Oh honey,” Kurt smiled up at the boy, “if you’re expecting an apology then you have the wrong boy.” Kurt let go of Charlie’s arm and let himself and his suitcase fall to the ground, he grabbed his wand with his free hand, “Arresto momentum.”</p><p>Kurt slowed to near a dead stop before gently touching down on the grass in front of what he was realising was a house, whilst Kurt was straightening himself up the door to his left opened and out came Ginny Weasley with a great big smile on her face, “Kurt, you’re here.” She hugged him and then took a step back to look around, “where’s Charlie?”</p><p>“On the roof,” Kurt rolled his eyes, “he threw me off the roof.”</p><p>Ginny tilted her head and squinted, trying see her brother, “Come down from there, mum won’t be happy.”</p><p>“Do you know that your friend said that Bill wouldn’t have gotten burnt like I did,” Charlie lit a cigarette as spoke down to Ginny from the roof.</p><p>“So you decided to throw him off the roof?” Ginny furrowed her brows, “not very bright.”</p><p>“I didn’t throw him,” Charlie crossed his arms defensively and Kurt giggled silently at what a good job Ginny was doing at scolding her older brother, “I merely dangled him off the edge. He’s the one who let go.”</p><p>“You didn’t let me finish,” Kurt used his hand as a visor so he could look up without getting the sun in his eyes, “the burn is on your left shoulder, meaning that isn’t your wand hand. Ron’s hand me down wand was a right-handed wand and Bill is left handed.”</p><p>“Please tell me how you know that Mr Hummel?”</p><p>Kurt turned on his heels to face a slender young woman with a lopsided smile leaning against the door frame, “Hermione Jean Granger, love of my life.”</p><p>“Don’t let Cedric hear you saying that,” his best friend scolded as she hugged him tightly, “God I missed you. How was Peru?”</p><p>Ginny rolled her eyes at the pair before muscling past them into the house as she called out into the house, “mum, Kurt’s here. And so is Hermione.”</p><p>Kurt raised a brow, “You just got here as well?”</p><p>“I took the floo network from Diagon Alley with Bill, I didn’t even notice that he was left handed,” Hermione shrugged nonchalantly, “don’t deflect, tell me about Peru.”</p><p>“Peru was Peruvian,” Kurt shrugged as he took a step back to drink in puberty’s work on Hermione’s body, “time has been good to you, you look like a million bucks and your boobs are miles better than Mandy Bracklehurst’s.”</p><p>Hermione giggled, taking a small bow, “you look exquisite as usual.”</p><p>“I never get tired of hearing it,” Kurt smiled, gazing at Hermione in awe of her glow; she was normally a beautiful girl but there was something breathe taking developing behind the unkept eyebrows, the bushy hair and the braces; the braces, “You got your braces removed.”</p><p>“Over the summer, yes, now I only have to wear a retainer when I sleep,” Hermione smiled broadly for a moment before bringing up a hand to shyly cover her smile, Kurt was certain he wasn’t the only one who would notice how… grown Hermione was looking.</p><p>As he and Hermione silently appreciated each other’s company, they were disturbed by Mrs Weasley. Mrs Weasley stood before them in a tope and white striped summer dress, she wore a broad smile and pulled both Hermione and Kurt into bone crushing hugs that reminded Kurt that she was more used to a different kind of boy.</p><p>“Hermione, you look lovely,” Mrs Weasley cupped Hermione’s face as she looked up to the now taller girl before turning to Kurt, “Kurt, you’re so thin.”</p><p>“Oh my gosh,” Kurt interjected before she could threaten to fatten him up, “thank you.”</p><p>Mrs Weasley was taken aback for a moment before shaking her head in disbelief, “Well, I just wanted to let you two know that you can make yourselves at home and if there’s anything you need just shout.”</p><p>“Now that you-” Kurt’s request for a chai tea was cut off by Hermione elbowing him in the ribs, “nothing, I just wanted to thank you for opening your home to us.”</p><p>“We’ll be sure to shout,” Hermione gave a polite nod before turning to Kurt and giving him a look of death.</p><p>“Bill,” Mrs Weasley yodelled across the kitchen, a tall thin man that strongly resembled Ron but with longer hair and edgier air to him appeared out of nowhere, “would you take Hermione’s bag up to Ginny’s room and put Kurt’s in Fred and George’s room.”</p><p>“Nobody’s been in Fred and George’s room all summer,” the handsome man spoke in a velvety deep voice, “I’m not sure it’s safe for human consumption, let alone guests.”</p><p>“Oh right, what with the explosions and all,” Mrs Weasley furrowed her brow, “put him in Charlie’s room, seeing as he likes heights so much he can sleep in Ron’s room or better yet the attic.”</p><p>Charlie suddenly apparited into the room with his hands held up in surrender, “now mum, I didn’t know you knew I was up there. I’m sorry but you can’t do that, I’m a grown man and I need my privacy.”</p><p>“Is that a cigarette?” Mrs Weasley raised a precautionary so magnificently that Kurt was both frightened and jealous. Charlie’s hand darted out and snatched the cigarette from where it hung between his lips but the damage was done, “since when do you smoke?”</p><p>“Mum,” Charlie slowly backed away from his simmering mother, “I… well…” Charlie turned to a giggling Kurt and pointed an accusatory finger, “This is all your fault.”</p><p>“My fault?” Kurt pursed his lips, “what happened to being a grown man?”</p><p>“Why I ought to bring you straight back from Romania,” Mrs Weasley finally scolded as her slow simmer came to a boil, “You’re lucky I don’t tan your hide right now.” Mrs Weasley huffed loudly and balanced her fists on the kitchen table, “Charlie and Bill, you go set up outside. Hermione and Ginny can help me in the kitchen.”</p><p>She turned to Kurt and he knew she didn’t know what to do with him, “I’ll go make myself even more beautiful.”</p><p>“Mum,” Ginny groaned, “I don’t want to help in the kitchen.”</p><p>“And what would you do?” Mrs Weasley’s fists moved from the table top to her hips, “tell me what you would rather do while I slave away in the kitchen? The woman are working in the kitchen, why should you be exempt?”</p><p>Ginny was silent and Kurt took this as his queue, “Why don’t I help you in the kitchen and Ginny can go help Charlie and Bill.”</p><p>“As lovely a gesture as that may be,” Mrs Weasley gave him a maternal smile much like Carole often did when he behaved out of the ordinary, it said ‘I don’t understand you but I love you’. Kurt knew what came next but he let it happen, “Ginny belongs here in the kitchen with me.”</p><p>“Why?” Ginny rolled her eyes at her mother.</p><p>“Because it’s what woman do honey,” Mrs Weasley gave Ginny the same look she’d just given Kurt, “it’s the way things are.”</p><p>“It’s not necessarily the way things should stay,” Hermione objected, “it’s the nineties and woman can be and do whatever they want; look at woman like Margaret Thatcher, Winnie Mandela, Hillary Clinton and Gloria Steinem.”</p><p>“I think I’ve only heard of the first,” Mrs Weasley furrowed her brow, “muggle lady, right?”</p><p>“She was the muggle Prime Minister,” Kurt nodded, “People hated her for making hard, and maybe wrong, decisions mostly because she was a woman.”</p><p>“Winnie Mandela is a South African Freedom fighter,” Hermione continued to explain, “she fought against apartheid alongside her husband despite the fact that many believed that she should have been home with her kids, South Africa became a democratic country this year.” Hermione gave a gentle smile, “Hillary Clinton is the American First Lady although she might make a better President than her husband. The point is that for so long woman have been marginalised and now we’re taking our place on par with men, that may mean shaking up ideas of where we belong.”</p><p>Mrs Weasley pursed her lips and looked broodingly at Ginny, “suppose this means you’ll be wanting to play quidditch?”</p><p>“More than anything,” Ginny smiled broadly, “more than I’ve wanted anything before in my life.”</p><p>“Very well,” Mrs Weasley nodded slowly, “have the boys teach you a thing or two when you’re done.” Mrs Weasley threw Ginny’s apron at Kurt and another at Hermione, “now tell me about Gloria Steinem.”</p><p>Kurt picked up a knife and smiled as he got to work, “she’s a famous journalist and author.”</p><p>“And Kurt worships her,” Hermione teased.</p><p>Kurt turned to face her and stopped chopping shallots, pointing the knife at Hermione, “I respect her writing.”</p><p>“You’re letting Kurt handle knives,” Harry walked in from the living room with Ron following close behind him, “brave.”</p><p>“Well, Harry Potter,” Kurt gave a villainous smile whilst Mrs Weasley hugged and welcomed Harry to her home, “the urge to commit murder only possesses me in your presence.”</p><p>“I wonder if I should be flattered or afraid,” Harry gave Kurt a soft punch on the shoulder.</p><p>“Afraid,” Ron added with a loud chuckle, “definitely afraid.”</p><p>“Ronald,” Kurt rolled his eyes as he went back to chopping after a reprimanding glare from Mrs Weasley, speaking over his shoulder, “Don’t make me drop this forcefully through the top of your head.”</p><p>“As entertaining as that may sound I don’t think you would fare well in Azkaban,” Mr Weasley chuckled as he apparited into the room, shaking Kurt’s hand then Hermione’s.</p><p>“Kurt would rule Azkaban,” George cheered loudly.</p><p>“And become the second person to escape,” Fred added jovially, “just like, burn his way out.”</p><p>“The dementors would never be ready for those blue flames,” George exclaimed as he and George high-fived.</p><p>Kurt rolled his eyes, “Ron, you had to tell them about the blue flames?”</p><p>“You warmed Neville’s face from across the lake,” Ron whined, “how could I not tell people?”</p><p>Kurt turned to Harry and Hermione, “you know that Ron has talked us up so much that Hipster Weasley thinks we’re imaginary.”</p><p>“Hipster Weasley?” the Weasleys all chorused.</p><p>“I don’t remember a Hipster,” Mr Weasley scratched his head, “There was Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred, George and Ginny. No Hipster.”</p><p>“Dad!” Ron exclaimed in a high pitched voice, “you forgot me!”</p><p>“Ron,” Mr Weasley gave a weak smile, “I’d forgotten about you.”</p><p>“Charles,” Kurt clarified.</p><p>“Why does he get a nickname?” Fred crossed his arms angrily.</p><p>“We don’t have a nickname,” George bowed his head in defeat.</p><p>“I call you two Fred and George even when there’s one of you,” Kurt shrugged, “that should count for something.”</p><p>“That just means you can’t tell us apart,” the pair chorused angrily. Kurt pointed at one then the other and identified each by name, “He’s solved it, what do we do now? Switch clothes!”</p><p>“Well I’ll be,” Mr Weasley gave a broad smile, “I’ve been trying to solve that one for years. Speaking of Fred and George,” Mr Weasley cleared his throat and the room with one small cough. They all moved out into the garden where Bill and Charlie were duelling with tables in the air.</p><p>Hermione pulled Kurt aside and spoke in a whisper, “When Mrs Weasley says ‘shout if you need something’ she doesn’t mean ask her for a chai tea, this isn’t the Four Seasons and she is not your chamber maid.”</p><p>“It’s scary that you knew I was going to ask for a chai tea,” Kurt looked her up and down suspiciously, “I’m sorry but she offered, when Carole offers she means it.”</p><p>“Carole is your step-mother,” Hermione rolled her eyes, “you can’t treat other people like you treat her.”</p><p>“Okay,” Kurt rolled his eyes, “I get it; no asking for tea and, I guess, no complaining if the sheets aren’t warmed.”</p><p>“Good,” Hermione turned three hundred and sixty degrees on her heels, “I also told her <em>Coq a Vin</em> is your favourite food in a letter. She remembered you were a fussy eater and it was the first thing that came to my mind.”</p><p>“Because I like wine?” Kurt smiled broadly, “I will love it as much as my dead soul allows; I never complain about Carole’s cooking and the only thing she can cook is Stroganoff, but man does she cook it well.”</p><p>“What are you two whispering about?” Bill called over at the pair.</p><p>“We were discussing your hair,” Kurt gave a false smile, “I think it reminds me too much of Mr Malfoy’s hair.”</p><p>“I think I don’t care,” Hermione mirrored the smile, “normal teenage stuff.”</p><p>Bill chuckled, “you could have said it was secret instead of insulting me you know.”</p><p>“You still haven’t told us how you knew Bill was left handed,” Ginny pointed out as she whizzed over their heads on an old broomstick.</p><p>“Where is Neville when I need him to tell people that I’m Kurt Elizabeth Hummel?” Kurt chuckled to himself, “It was on his Head Student Profile, they have all of them since Hogwarts opened in this great big book that used to be on display in the foyer a couple of hundred years ago. They fill it in for sport these days.”</p><p>“Let me guess,” Harry tilted his head upward, watching Ginny fly, “it’s in the hall of records?”</p><p>“Yep,” Kurt and Hermione chorused.</p><p>“Ron was right,” Bill shook his head in disbelief, “it’s even freakier when they do it. Ron, right? What is the world coming to?”</p><p>“You two should really take us to the hall of records sometime,” Ron said, ignoring the subtle insult from his brother.</p><p>“We can’t get you to read in the library,” Hermione chortled “I doubt you’ll be interested in old tomes and codices filled with lists of names of people who are mostly dead, old school administrative documents and revision upon revision of the school rules.”</p><p>“Ron did mention you were boring,” Charlie teased the pair.</p><p>Ron turned bright red before posing his denial, “I would never say such a thing.”</p><p>“What exactly did Ron say about us?” Kurt quirked a curios brow.</p><p>Ron gave his brothers a pleading stare and Charlie returned it with a dark smile, “we’ve covered ice cold bitch, right?”</p><p>“You’re the worst,” Ron sighed.</p><p>“So I guess we start with when he said Hermione was bossy,” Bill nodded his head in agreement with Charlie as he spoke, “then he called you both boy crazy nerds.”</p><p>Kurt shrugged nonchalantly, “you should hear the things I tell my siblings, Harley thinks so little of you Ron.”</p><p>“I contest to being called bossy; that is so sexist, if I were a boy you would call me authoritative and admire me for it. As for boy crazy,” Hermione turned to Ron and spoke in a firm voice, “that’s absurd, I demand you take it back, take it all back.”</p><p>“That’s not bossy at all,” Bill teased Hermione as they sat around the long table they had formed by placing two picnic tables head to head.</p><p>“Don’t you start with me,” Hermione scolded in reply and a flabbergasted Bill shrunk in his seat.</p><p>“I think Ron is confusing people actually wanting to date us with being boy crazy because he has a chronicle case of singleness,” Kurt teased his friend, tugging his too long hair.</p><p>“Besides,” Hermione crossed her arms indignantly, “You didn’t make any mention of Harry Potter serial dating the Ravenclaw girls.”</p><p>“You know Finn cried for like a week straight until Cedric made me promise him I hadn’t dated Padma,” Harry whined angrily, “I hate that rumour because I dated one Ravenclaw girl.”</p><p>“Harry didn’t get a description at all,” Charlie pointed out, “we just got a name and it was enough said.”</p><p>“If it makes you feel any better,” Bill shrugged, recovering from Hermione’s rebuke of his observation of her bossiness, “Percy said that in his expert opinion as a former head boy, you two were most likely to make head boy and girl in your seventh year.”</p><p>“Fred and George did also say you were as smart as you are mean,” Charlie gave the pair another one of his lopsided smirks, “but mostly Ron made it seem like we were having You-Know-Who over.”</p><p>“He does that often enough,” Kurt and Hermione chorused, before shrugging and crossing their arms in perfect unison.</p><p>“Definitely scarier when you do it,” Harry chortled, “Fred and George haven’t got a thing on you two.”</p><p>“Speaking of Fred and George,” Hermione began.</p><p>“Why are they in trouble?” Kurt finished for her.</p><p>“They dropped a sweet and my cousin, Duddly, ate it because he’s on an imposed diet,” Harry explained, “it made his tongue swell up.”</p><p>“Allergies,” Kurt shook his head.</p><p>“Probably peanuts,” Hermione completed the statement for him, at this point they were mainly completing each other’s sentences for entertainment value.</p><p>Ron shook his head, “it was a ton tongue toffee.”</p><p>“It speaks,” Kurt and Hermione chorused.</p><p>Kurt knitted his brow in confusion, “I’ve never heard of a ton tongue toffee.”</p><p>“Neither have I and I love toffee,” Hermione mirrored Kurt’s facial expression.</p><p>“But you couldn’t eat toffee because of your braces,” Kurt pointed out.</p><p>“And you don’t like sweet things,” Hermione shrugged, “maybe we just missed it.”</p><p>“Not likely,” Ron interrupted their private conversation, “it’s Fred and George’s own invention.”</p><p>“I guess mum is still upset about their poor OWL results,” Charlie shrugged.</p><p>“Only a handful a piece and not a single outstanding,” Bill shook his head solemnly, “Didn’t help that Percy got six ‘outstanding’ passes on his NEWTs.”</p><p>“But because of the world cup tomorrow and the fact that we all already have tickets,” Ginny tossed the broomstick aside and slipped in between Kurt and Ron, “they won’t get grounded.”</p><p>“Why are they making toffee?” Harry asked, furrowing his brow, “like I get that it’s a cool prank but why toffee?”</p><p>“It’s part of a line of products we’re making,” Fred appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>“Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes,” George continued, “we’ve been testing them on Ron all summer.”</p><p>“Hey,” Ron protested but nobody paid him any mind.</p><p>“And we wanted to see if it worked on sentient beings,” they chorused gleefully, clearly they’d been let of scotch free other than the scolding. Kurt couldn’t help laughing as Harry pointed out that his cousin wasn’t the brightest bulb on the tree and as such not a good test; their conversation filled most of the evening and went on even after dinner was served, late into the night.</p><p>~0~</p><p>Kurt was less than impressed when they had begun their blind hike late as a result of Harry and Ron’s failure to rise on time, despite being warned the previous night at dinner. Their group of eight was stretched out in dribs and drabs; in front was Mr Weasley, followed closely by Hermione and Kurt, a fair distance back were Fred, Ginny and George, and bringing up the rear were Harry and Ron. Bill and Charlie would be appariting to the World Cup Final sight, Percy would be arriving in his professional capacity as a ministry official, and Mrs Weasley had elected to stay home with her knitting.</p><p>“Arthur, you’re late!” a squat man with gold rimmed spectacles scolded from where he sat under a tree.</p><p>“Sorry Amos,” Mr Weasley gave the man a firm handshake before pulling him into a manly hug, “some of us had a sleepy start.”</p><p>“Kurt,” Cedric and Finn chorused as one fell from the tree above and latter rose from a pile of leaves like a zombie.</p><p>Kurt clutched his chest dramatically and feigned surprise, out the corner of his eye he saw Cedric rolling his eyes, “Finn told you we were planning this, didn’t he?”</p><p>“Of course I did,” Finn shook his head as if stating the obvious, “I value my life.”</p><p>Cedric laced his fingers into Kurt’s, looked longingly into Kurt’s eyes and pressed his forehead against Kurt’s fore head, “How are you beautiful?”</p><p>Kurt took a deep breath and it seemed as though the air was more oxygen rich, he gave a small shy smile, “I’m well and yourself?”</p><p>“Better now,” Cedric gave him a chaste kiss and Kurt’s heart smiled broadly.</p><p>“Bless my soul,” Amos cried out, “it’s Harry Potter.”</p><p>“Nice of you two to join us,” Hermione teased.</p><p>Kurt watched the middle aged man shake Harry’s hand, “Amos Diggory.”</p><p>Kurt raised a finely sculpted brow and turned to Cedric quizzically and spoke in a tone that was almost accusatory, “that’s your father?”</p><p>Kurt’s message was well received as Cedric started to sweat nervously and pull at the collar of his shirt, it was Hermione who spoke in his place, “you’re radiating heat.”</p><p>“Of course I am,” Kurt rolled his eyes, “I’m trying to make him sweat.”</p><p>“You are succeeding without the extra heat,” Cedric gave a weak chuckle, “if looks could kill.”</p><p>“If they could, Kurt would know,” Finn teased his friend.</p><p>A smile cracked Kurt’s death glare, “you flatter me Finnocence.”</p><p>“I don’t think I tell you often enough how I am left in awe of your magnificence,” Cedric hooked his arm over Kurt’s shoulders and gave him a kiss just below his ear before whispering, “I will introduce you to my father in due course.”</p><p>“Kurt,” Finn raised a quizzical brow as he hooked arms with Hermione, keeping pace with Kurt and Cedric, “Where is your overnight bag?”</p><p>“You didn’t expect us to carry our own bags all the way here,” Kurt scoffed, “did you?”</p><p>“I’m not sure that answers my question,” Finn looked over at Kurt to check his response before shaking his head to the negative, “No.”</p><p>“The older Weasleys are appariting to the world cup,” Hermione began to explain, “They’ll be bringing our bags.”</p><p>Finn’s face paled, “have I been replaced with a newer, faster model.”</p><p>“Neither of them are newer,” Kurt chortled, “they are both old as sand.”</p><p>“Didn’t you once say Carole was old as sand?” Hermione raised a curious brow, “How old is sand in your world?”</p><p>“I did,” Kurt nodded, “but that isn’t stopping her from having more and more kids.”</p><p>“We need to stage an intervention,” Finn nodded in time with Kurt.</p><p>“She had another one?” Hermione’s eye shot wide open.</p><p>“No,” Kurt rolled his eyes, “She’s just pregnant again.”</p><p>“You’re going to be fourteen years older than this one,” Hermione shook her head in disbelief, “that is kind of inconsiderate.”</p><p>“But now Harley will have someone to boss around,” Finn pointed out.</p><p>“You’re older than Kurt but it seems he bosses you around,” Cedric pointed out with a wag of his eyebrow.</p><p>“Kurt treats you like his bitch,” Finn countered, “I don’t think you have a leg to stand on.”</p><p>“Oh my gosh,” Kurt’s jaw went slack, he turned to Hermione, “They’re starting to sound like us.”</p><p>Hermione giggled, “Kurt isn’t a good case study, he treats everybody terribly.”</p><p>“He doesn’t treat Neville terribly,” Finn countered, “but then again, I’m not sure Neville could take it.”</p><p>“Don’t underestimate Neville,” Kurt snapped, “with the right kind of motivation he can achieve unknown wonders.”</p><p>“I thought that kind of motivation was reserved for me,” Cedric teased, grabbing a handful of Kurt’s buttocks.</p><p>“Cedric Diggory,” Kurt raised his voice an octave as he playful swatted the taller boy’s muscled chest, “Your father is a few feet away, I will not do this now.”</p><p>“Are you saving your motivation for Neville?” Cedric feigned being wounded.</p><p>Kurt gave a high pitched giggle, “You know exactly what I mean.”</p><p>“Do I?” Cedric countered as he nuzzled Kurt’s neck.</p><p>“What Kurt meant,” a familiar, airy and distant voice explained his intentions from beside him, “is that Neville’s a pretty powerful wizard.”</p><p>“Thank you Luna,” Kurt smiled down at her, and raised a brow at the odd man she had appeared with, “the rest of us can’t cast a Patronus.”</p><p>“We’re here,” Amos Diggory announced as he turned back to the group, “Look for something out of the ordinary, that’ll be our portkey.” His face contorted in surprise as his gaze came to rest on the tangle of limbs, “who’s this now?”</p><p>“Oh, Dad,” Cedric untangled himself from Kurt, “This is Kurt, I’ve told you about Kurt, my Kurt.”</p><p>The man’s eyebrows shot up toward his receding hairline and then Kurt felt himself being sized up before a friendly hand and smile were extended in his direction, “Cedric never mentioned you were the Kurt from The Daily Prophet, it’s lovely to meet you.”</p><p>“I think it’s because the prophet doesn’t portray me in a very good light,” Kurt joked as he carried himself with grace, “but I’m sure the pleasure is all mine.”</p><p>“That’s Rita Skeeter for you,” Mr Diggory gave a booming chuckle that juxtaposed his demure appearance but the snort at the end made the laugh a tad more congruent, “So, Cedric tells me you are the top student in your house.”</p><p>“I would be top of my year if it weren’t for Hermione Jean Granger,” Kurt had turned up the charm, he was being humble but without underselling his abilities.</p><p>“You’re a funny one, your parents must be so proud,” Mr Diggory nodded.</p><p>“Finn is funnier,” Kurt received another one of Mr Diggory’s peculiar laughs.</p><p>The man turned back to the open meadow, “Now, let’s find that portkey.”</p><p>“And be careful,” Mr Weasley explained, “If you touch it-”</p><p>“Found it!” Fred and George chorused as they bent to pick up the rainbow striped umbrella and disappeared.</p><p>“You’ll be transported immediately.” Mr Weasley let out a defeated sigh, “Now the rest of us have to use the other one.”</p><p>“Here it is Arthur,” Mr Diggory pointed at an old discarded boot, “Now all of us will have to touch it at once.” Their large group circled the boot, it was a tight fit but they managed, “On the count of three; one, two, three.”</p><p>Kurt reached out and touched the boot; instead of the pulling sensation that accompanied apparition, there was a spinning sensation. Before he could make heads or tails of it, they were standing in a dense wood much like the forbidden forest. Mr Weasley led their group out of the woods and to a densely populated campsite.</p><p>When they came to the campground entrance they were reunited with Fred and George, who by the looks of things had not wasted their independence; each held a betting ticket. Mr Weasley checked them in and Kurt was astounded by the campground managers comment about exotic foreign nationals, it took Kurt a moment to realise that the man was a muggle and unused to wizards of any kind. Kurt also noted that the wizards were acting odd and dressed strangely, “Why are they dressed like that?”</p><p>“They’re dressed like muggles,” Mr Weasley gave queer stare, “are they not doing it correctly.”</p><p>“They’re trying too hard and it’s making a spectacle,” Hermione pointed out.</p><p>“They should have just dressed normally and said it was a themed convention,” Finn added with a shrug.</p><p>“That would have been less conspicuous than this,” Harry chuckled at the eccentrically dressed wizards.</p><p>Mr Weasley seemed to mull over what they were saying before giving a firm nod, he looked down at their plot cards and pointed left, “we’re heading this way. See you at the match Amos.”</p><p>Kurt and Cedric untangled arms, “Later.”</p><p>“Later,” Kurt echoed as he and Hermione went off with the Weasleys and the Lovegoods. They navigate through rows upon rows of tents that were elaborately decorated in the green of Ireland, they finally came to their plot where a pair of tents had been pitched and Hipster Weasley lay in the sun. Luna and her father went on to their own campsite with the promise of catching up later.</p><p>Kurt kicked the older boy awake, “Hey that is not necessary, no kicking.”</p><p>“I just wanted to say thank you,” Kurt gave a patronizing smile before stepping over the boy into his tent.</p><p>“You are not good at gratitude,” Hermione scolded with a chuckle.</p><p>“How dare you,” Kurt pointed a reprimanding finger at her, “I’m good at everything I do.”</p><p>Harry stumbled into Kurt’s tent with Ron in tow, his eyes went wide and Kurt smiled, “I love magic.”</p><p>“It’s actually pronounced Kurt,” He teased the boy.</p><p>“You complained about living outside when you lived in this?” Harry countered ad he gazed up at the high ceilings of the lounge area of Kurt’s tent.</p><p>“You’ve seen my house,” Kurt argued defensively, “Everything feels like outside in comparison to that.”</p><p>“These cookies are the best,” Ron smiled broadly as he spoke around a mouthful of them.</p><p>“Watch your crumbs,” Kurt scolded, “this is a Persian rug.”</p><p>“I’m going to have to ask this question again,” Hermione stood at Kurt’s bedroom door, “Why is everything in here white?”</p><p>“As I’ve said before,” Kurt gave a devilish smile, “It is lovely, isn’t it.”</p><p>“It has been decided that we’re being divided by age,” Ginny flipped the tent flap open and flung in Ron and Harry’s bags, “Young people in here, old people plus Fred and George next door. Dad wants to keep an-” Ginny stopped dead as she stepped into the tent, “Holy mother of Merlin’s Bearded dildo fucking me sideways.”</p><p>“Ginny,” Ron scolded, “we do need that image in our minds.”</p><p>“I get the feeling she likes it,” Kurt chuckled.</p><p>“I’ve never been so glad to be too young for something,” Ginny smiled as threw herself on the couch.</p><p>“It looks a lot like a white version of the Slytherin Dungeon,” Ron exclaimed, “I finally realised why it feels so damn familiar.”</p><p>Ginny raised a curious brow, “Do you go to the Slytherin Dungeon often?”</p><p>“Not since you stopped talking to Tom Riddle,” Ron gave a crooked smile as Ginny paled.</p><p>“Firstly, ten points to Gryffindor,” Kurt clapped his hands, “Secondly, is it me or has summer made you all catty as fuck.” Kurt pulled out his wand and pointed it straight at Ron, “Thirdly, Feet off the couch! It’s white leather.”</p><p>“Sorry,” Ron jumped off the couch with his hands held up in surrender.</p><p>“One more misstep and you’re sleeping outside,” Kurt smiled and started taking opaque plastic cups out of the cupboard, he produced a large flask from his overnight bag and poured some of the contents into each cup, “Now, let’s go have a looksy around the camp grounds.”</p><p>Ginny took her cup with trepidation, “what’s in this?”</p><p>Harry, Hermione, Kurt and Ron all looked at her, then at each other but before they could speak another voice answered for them, “Pills and bourbon.”</p><p>“Perfect,” Kurt handed a cup to Cedric, Finn and Luna, “you’re here.”</p><p>Finn took a sip and gave a broad smile, “Tastes like Oma.”</p><p>“You need to stop tasting people,” Kurt teased Finn, pinching his cheeks encouragingly.</p><p>“It was a phase,” Finn shrugged, “That part of my life is over.”</p><p>“Padma will be disappointed to hear that,” Hermione joked as their group crawled through the rows of tents.</p><p>Ron chuckled, “Now who’s going to let Neville feel their boobs?”</p><p>“I volunteer,” a merry voice chimed as a pair of arms snaked around Kurt’s waste from behind, Kurt felt himself being turned and kissed deeply by somebody too close to his height to be Cedric.</p><p>“What is going on?” Cedric’s sounded only mildly surprised, “what is in this drink?”</p><p>Kurt pulled out of the kiss and looked into a pretty face and head of blond hair, “Brittany!”</p><p>“Hi Kurt,” she waved at him.</p><p>“Hi Brit,” Kurt tried to make sense of the moment but remembered how little sense Brittany made in general, “fancy seeing you here.”</p><p>She shrugged and moved on to Kissing Hermione, “Hi Hermione.”</p><p>“Oh my God,” Hermione turned to Kurt in disbelief, “She uses more tongue than Finn.”</p><p>Kurt’s mind was still transfixed on what Hermione had just said, “Brittany, meet Ron, Harry, Ginny Luna and Cedric.”</p><p>Ron Got into line for a kiss but received a handshake instead, “Nice to meet you all, I’m Brittany.” She seemed more interested in what might have been behind them, “Where’s Neville Christopher Admetus Longbottom?”</p><p>“He’s seeing the Serengeti with his Uncle Algie,” Luna smiled as she spoke, shaking a disappointed Brittany’s hand, “He’s hoping for an attempt on his life.”</p><p>“You kissed Finn?” Kurt turned to Hermione, his jaw slacking in disbelief, “when was this?”</p><p>“It was last year before my second date with Anthony,” Hermione explained, “it wasn’t a thing, he was tutoring me.”</p><p>“It was a once off thing,” Finn held his hands up in surrender, “no strings attached.”</p><p>Ron shook his head in pseudo-disbelief, “How is it that Finn has made out with so many people and I’m-”</p><p>“Still sad and alone?” Ginny completed the question for him and he turned as red as his hair.</p><p>“Not quite how I would put it,” Ron stared daggers at his sister, “but that’s the gist.”</p><p>There was a lingering silence, nobody wanted to earn Ron’s ire by answering the question, it was only Brittany who was bold enough to reply, “Have you tried to make out with someone? Finn doesn’t exactly ask you, he grabs your hand and lets you feel his boobs and then goes in for the kill.”</p><p>“My biceps are also better than yours,” Finn added.</p><p>“If it makes you feel any better,” Harry placed a reassuring hand on his best friend’s shoulder, “Ginny hasn’t made out with anyone either.”</p><p>“And besides,” Kurt gave a devilish grin, “You were in a committed relationship with Scabbers.”</p><p>Harry, Hermione and Kurt laughed, and Ron blushed violently whilst everybody else simply watched in confusion, Luna raised a dismissive brow, “that was weird.”</p>
