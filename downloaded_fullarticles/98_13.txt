    <p>Hello loves,</p><p>I'm not too sure if anyone is truly invested in my story here but if you are, you'll know that I took a pretty long, unplanned hiatus. The reason for this was that I was beginning to feel increasingly unmotivated and abandoned all of my projects and hobbies. I"ve been trying to come back slowly and refresh my idea for the plot by rereading what I have so far and I've realised that I have absolutely no plan for where this is going. I've come up with a lot of tweaks that could be made to the plot to actually make my story interesting. These tweaks involve me completely rewriting what I've already done to accommodate all the elements that I need to set up the action. Because of this, I'll be taking down Red Tide as I rework the plot and the characters. Rest assured that this story will be returning, however, it will take me some time to actually write it considering I'm still dealing with a near-crippling urge to hide away from the world and sleep forever. Hopefully, you'll love the new version of Red Tide as much as I hope you will.</p><p>Goodbye for now,</p><p>Elbie </p><p>Ps.  I'll be taking down all of the published chapters of this story apart from this note.</p>
