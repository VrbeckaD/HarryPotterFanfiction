  <h5>CHAPTER ONE </h5>
</center><p>"SHUT YOUR MOUTH MALFOY, YOU STUPID FERRET" Harry yelled aiming his wand toward Malfoy, before he could utter a reply. Harry casted <cite>Wingardium Leviosa</cite>, sending the git flying back. The raging blond quickly stood up cursing, about to hex Harry when Professor Snape disarmed both of their wands. The chosen boy was fuming, ready to kill the pure blood idiot, but could do nothing while the head of Slytherin was present. Severus glared down at the two boys with his hardest and coldest sneer. "What in the <cite><strong>world</strong></cite> do you think you're attempting to accomplish in <strong>MY</strong> classroom, Mister Potter?</p><p>Harry flinched slightly at the fearful tone. "But sir.. He started it..." The head of Slytherin glared at the Potter boy. "I did not see Malfoy using his wand, tossing your arse into the air Potter!! 25 points from Gryffindor and detention with me for a week." Harry whispered, "Wha-......yes professor." The boy groaned under his breath. Ron whispered to Harry as he passed, "Good luck with that old bat Harry." Harry gave a small reassuring smile towards and replied quietly, "Yeah.. I'll need it." Severus snapped his head and glared at Ronald. "<strong>Mister Weasley</strong>, you'll do well to remember that I can give you detention as well."</p><p>The said ginger flinched and lowered his head. "..Yes, sir," Ron replied as the bell rang. The room quickly emptied and the only ones that remained were Snape and Harry. "What do you want me to do for detention?" Harry inquired coldly after a moment of silence. Severus walked to his desk, cape billowing around his frame in a menacing manner. "It does not matter <cite><strong>Potter</strong></cite> just report to my office at 7:30 sharp or your punishment will be <cite><strong>severe</strong></cite>." He spoke with a sneer. "Now go, I have actual work to do."</p><p>Harry inwardly shivered at the tone, but remained passive. "Yes, sir." He responded and walked out of the class, heading to the Gryffindor common room. When the clock struck 6:58 Severus pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed, "He is going to be the death of me." Harry rushed out of the common room when he looked at the clock thinking, <cite>'Oh no, Snape will kill me if I'm late!'</cite> The boy entered through the door a minute past 7:30, breathing quickly. Harry ran a hand through his messy hair before speaking, "..umm.. I'm here professor." </p><p>"And late at that, <cite><strong>potter</strong></cite>." Harry sighed, "..I'm sorry sir. It was really only a minute- not even a full one." He argued while making his way up to the front desk. "Tardy nonetheless!! Honestly Potter, I know you're a prat, but an idiot too!?! Now sit over there and write me an essay listing and detailing all the components of the bubble toil potion." Harry spoke softly, not wanting to anger the potions master further."Yes, Professor Snape." Harry obediently sat down at the nearest desk and began writing on the parchment, choosing how to word the essay. He couldn't help but glance at Severus, hearing him sigh and seeing him pinch the bridge of his nose while working. <cite>'Snape seems stressed.'</cite> Harry pondered.</p><p>Severus proceeded to grade the essays of first years and their attempt at explaining the different uses of stirring clockwise and counterclockwise before noticing the boy glancing at him. "Mister Potter, if you would dearly love to marvel at me, I suggest you take a photo. It lasts much longer, and help you with your-" the professor broke the sentence with a short cough, then continued. "<cite><strong>harder</strong></cite> problems?" Severus raised his eyebrow, and smirked as he saw the boy squirm in his seat. Harry blushed and shifted in the seat to hide his growing erection from obvious view. "So-sorry, sir." The chosen shifted his focus to finishing the essay, but couldn't help but think about Snape. <cite>'did he smirk?! Actually smirk?! Well, damn. He looked kinda..sexy with that smirk'</cite> Severus spoke again, "Just work Potter." Sev continued to grade with his <cite>send-children-running-to-the-forbidden-forest scowl.</cite></p><p>Harry frowned and wrote several more tedious paragraphs for the next couple of hours. "Professor. I'm done." Severus' head was tucked in his folded arms on his desk breathing evenly; mumbling Harry's name. "<cite>....Harry...</cite>"<br/>
The boy replied, looking up from his paper, "Yes, sir..?"</p><p>Severus was dreaming of Harry begging for more underneath himself. The potions professor mumbled, "<cite>I.......l-lo-love.....you.....obnoxious brat....</cite>"</p><p>Harry slowly rose from the desk and walked towards his still dark form curiously. "..Snape?"</p><p>The potions master shifted slightly at the sound of Harry's voice before continuing to mumble in his sleep. "<cite>....oh yes.....Harry.</cite>"</p><p>Harry smirked as he thought to himself, 'he's dreaming of me. I can use this to prank him for being such a git.' The young lion quietly leaned close to Severus' ear and whispered sweetly, " <cite>What do you want</cite> <cite><strong>severus?</strong></cite>"</p><p>The professor turned his head at the sweet sound of Harry's voice. Severus murmured in return, "<cite>mmm.... Say you.....love me...</cite>"</p><p>Harry leaned in further, almost touching Severus' cheek with his lips,  "<cite>Severus, I love you. I always have.</cite>" Harry spoke honestly; he in fact had a deep crush on Severus Snape for the past few years.</p><p>Severus moaned softly "<cite>I... I love you......too.</cite>"</p><p>Harry leaned back and blushing at the sleeping man before quietly leaving the class. He has to tend to a rather <strong>hard</strong> situation.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>o.O.o</p>
</center><p>In potions lab the following day we find Severus Snape watching the class from behind his stack of papers; carefully avoiding looking directly at Potter. <cite>'honestly, does he think staring at me so intensely will change anything? The boy couldn't possibly know the effect he has over me'</cite></p><p>Harry finished the class work before heading up to Snape's desk and spoke with a smirk, "<cite>professor</cite>, can you check my work?" Harry leaned in close whispering, "<cite>how was your dream sir? Anything <strong>hot</strong> happen?</cite>"</p><p>Severus spoke, "I am quite sure I <strong>don't</strong> know what you are referring to, <strong>Mister Potter</strong>. The professor glared at him and snatched his paper; smirking. "As for your paper, I'm not one who believes in <strong>second chances,</strong> so this will be your grade. No matter what whimsical and inappropriate <strong>nonsense</strong> you have yet to show me you are clearly capable of having."</p><p>"I think you do sir. <cite>You are very vocal when you sleep,and honest</cite>, and as for my <strong>work</strong> I think you will enjoy it <strong>immensely.</strong> (Harry's "work" is a very sexually detailed letter about how much he wants Snape) the lion smirked with confidence and walked back to his seat.</p><p>Severus stared at the boy until he was seated; glancing at the paper before shoving it to the side as Draco walks up to his desk.</p><p>Draco laid his paper down atop Potter's. "That stupid lion actually finished an assignment early for the first time in his life. Ha! He probably did it completely wrong." Draco smirked and expected his godfather to laugh along with him with approval like his father often did.</p><p>The potions master snatched up Draco's paper and sneered; he raised his voice as he spoke, "Seeing as how you can't even spell podentes correctly, I highly doubt you are one to comment on Mister Potter's lack of educated intelligence. HE <strong>AT LEAST</strong> SPELLED THE WORD CORRECTLY." <cite>'Merlin, Snape, you don't know what Harry wrote so why are you bloody defending him against your own house'</cite> "30 points from Slytherin for putting their <strong>insight</strong> where it does <strong>not</strong> belong."</p><p>"What?! You're siding with those...<strong>Gryffindors!?</strong>" Draco asked flabbergasted. He had never expected Snape to defend the Gryffindors, least of all Harry fucking Potter.</p><p>Harry couldn't help but smile slightly and think. <cite>'Severus stuck up for me even though he didn't read my essay.'</cite> </p><p>Snape folded his arms across his chest as he glared down his nose and spoke in a menacing voice, "I am <strong>siding</strong> as you say, with no one. You may be in my house, but I will not tolerate the berating of another student in my classroom. No matter how idiotic the person in question seems."</p><p>"Yes, professor."  The blonde boy returned to his seat and glared at Harry.</p><p>Severus closed his eyes and pinched at the bridge of his nose. "Once you have turned in your essay, you are dismissed." The older wizard sat back in his chair and massaged his temples <cite>'what the bloody hell are you doing Severus, you fool'</cite></p><p><cite>"Harry why are you still here when you finished your essay, Hermione already left,"</cite> Ron whispered.</p><p><cite>"I have to ask when my detention for tonight is."</cite> The boy replied</p><p>Ron nodded and returned to his work so he could leave.</p><p>Severus slowly gained control and settled back into grading; he sighed heavily when he reaches Harry's essay at the very bottom of the stack. <cite>'just read it Sev, it can't be that harmful to just read it.'</cite> As he read, he almost immediately had to shift his focus on other things to distract himself from his problem down low. <cite>'bloody hell, he's good'</cite></p><p>Harry had waited, watching Severus read the essay quickly before fumble around to distract himself. The lion couldn't hold back the smirk.</p><p>Severus spoke without glancing up, "Would you kindly like to explain why you are still in my classroom, Mister Potter?"</p><p>"Well, sir, I wanted to know what you think of my <cite><strong>essay</strong></cite> and also what time should I come for detention?"</p><p>"My thoughts concerning your <cite><strong>essay</strong></cite> will be very clear to you, among other things." Severus looked up at Harry before continuing, "As for your detention, come to my office at 7. Good Day Mister Potter."</p><p>"Yes Sir," Harry said with a smirk as he walked out of the door. <cite>'You can't hide your feelings from me any longer.'</cite></p><p>Severus watched that delicious plump arse disappear from his class  <cite>'that boy is so tempting, but I can do this'</cite> </p><p>Harry pondered deeply as he climbed the multitude of steps to the tower <cite>'He wants me but what's stopping him? Age? That I'm a Gryffindor? Cause I am his student? My father?!'</cite></p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>
    <strong>~6:58~</strong>
  </p>
</center><p>
  <cite>'That minx is going to be the death of me, I swear' Severus smirked as he pondered, 'but I've got the perfect punishment for his adolescent behavior.'</cite>
</p><p>The said Gryffindor knocked lightly before entering the potions lab humming a soft tune. "Afternoon sir." Harry walked up to his professor's large dark wooden desk. <cite>'God, I'd love for him to bend me over that and-'</cite> "What would you like me to do tonight?"</p><p>Severus looked at him blankly, "Sit and stare silently."</p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow in question and smirked, "Is it your turn to take a picture then?"</p><p>"<strong>Honestly</strong> Potter!!! I already have enough of you in my head. Now sit down and shut up!!"</p><p>"As you wish." The said minx walked around Severus' large desk and sat on the hard surface. "Anything else <cite>Severus?</cite>"</p><p>Severus stared up at him and bit back a moan; he stood up and placed both hands on the desk, trapping Harry. Severus leaned forward till his mouth was brushing Harry's ear and whispered in a silky dark voice. "Stay very, <cite>very</cite> still." He licked Harry's ear lightly with his sharp tongue.</p><p>Harry gasps turned into a sweet moan; he tried to remain still but found it difficult to resist the strong urge to touch his professor. "I..I want to kiss you..."</p><p>Severus smirked, "Silent Harry or I'll stop." The sly Slytherin moved his head down to the tan neck and sucked lightly. "-and I think that'd be bad...."</p><p>"No.. Don't stop;  We both want-<cite><strong>need</strong></cite> this." Harry whimpered as he was sharply nipped.</p><p>The older wizard stopped abruptly and pulled away to look Harry in the eye. "Silence Harry. I mean it." He continued to pull away and walked to the fireplace. "Come here Harry." </p><p>Harry bit his lip lightly as he slid off the desk and followed Snape silently.</p><p>Snape wrapped his arms around Harry's shoulder; he threw floo powder in before saying, "Severus Snape's Personal Quarters." </p><p>The chosen one walked into the green flames with Severus. When he opened his emerald eyes again, he saw the large quarters decorated in black, silver and green. Harry blushed lightly when his glaze spotted to the bed in the dimly lit chamber. <cite>'I wonder how far we will go..'</cite> He looked up at his professor.</p><p>Severus wandlessly lights candles throughout the room; he then turned towards Harry, with one arm still on his shoulder, he used his other to bring Harry's chin up and lightly kisses the boy. <cite>'I'll gauge his reaction first.'</cite></p><p>Harry returned the kiss lightly to not pressure his crush; he moaned softly into the kiss asking for more. <cite>'calm your hormones down Harry or he won't continue'</cite></p><p>The potions master pulled back slightly, "Harry, we.....we need to talk first..."</p><p><cite>'Fuck! I don't want to talk, I want you to pleasure me till I can't think.'</cite> Harry forced his hormone raged body to calm down some. "Okay... What are your concerns?"</p><p>"Why me?" Severus asked as he looked deeply into Harry's eyes.</p><p>Harry smiled calmly, "That's a dumb question. Why not you? You have always protected me, whether I knew it or not, you're not as cold and heartless as people perceive you to be; I see the good and the love in you. The loneliness, and pain that matches my own. I am drawn to you in every way possible. You're handsome, and brilliant. I never hated you for all those years I was just naïve and confused about my feelings for you. Even the insults and threats always seem half hearted when you spoke to me. Deep down I knew it was only a matter of time before I couldn't bare to hide my feeling any longer.." </p><p>Harry lifted his hand, holding Severus' cheek and gently rubbing his thumb across his smooth skin.</p><p>"I just wasn't sure how you felt about me, at least not until yesterday; when you called me Harry in your sleep and confessed. My heart went crazy and hope flooded my mind and I just couldn't control myself. I don't care about your past or what you have done. I want you, and I love you. I just don't understand why you want me.. The child of the woman you deeply cared for, and one of your deeply hated enemies. I, a Gryffindor that Slytherin is supposed to hate."</p><p>"Because you're perfect for me. Severus spoke, "You have light, and even after you knew what I'd done you still love me. It was heartbreaking to know that you could have died any of the times you faced you-know-who!" Severus broke their deep eye contact to lean down and kiss his chosen one eagerly; he wrapped his arm around harry and pulled him up to his chest.</p><p>Harry wrapped his arms around Severus' neck and returned the kiss with the same eagerness, and deepening the kiss.</p><p>The Slytherin licked Harry's lips with his tongue. </p><p>He opened his mouth, sliding his tongue out slightly to tease Severus' before coaxing it into his own mouth.</p><p>Severus was surprised when he realized what Harry wanted. <cite>'For fuck sakes! He can kiss!! Just give in Sev'</cite> Strong experienced hands picked Harry up by his waist while not breaking the kiss and walked over to the bed; he laid Harry down and broke the kiss to pull his robe off. "Are you sure?" He leaned back down to kiss Harry's neck.</p><p>"I have been sure for a long while now. I love you Severus." Harry pulled Severus closer and kissed him deeply with lust filled passion.</p><p>Severus groaned and crawled on top of Harry; he put his knee in between Harry's leg and pressed it against his minx's cloth covered cock.</p><p>Harry moaned and bucked his hips slightly. He threaded the fingers of his right hand into Severus' hair. "Oh Sev-mmm.."</p><p>Severus unbutton Harry's shirt with his hands, before pressing Harry's hips down with force. </p><p>The lion whimpered at the lack of friction, trying to control his patience. <cite>'god this slow pace is maddening. Just rip the clothes'</cite> He released Snape's hair to help slip out of the shirt. "Sir, may I remove your shirt?"</p><p>"Severus, Harry. Call me by my given name and yes" He returned to kissing Harry with unyielding desire. He traced Harry's chest with his fingers. "You can take my things off..."</p><p>"Yes Se-Severus." He let Severus dominate the kiss as he quickly unbuttoned the black shirt with steady hands.</p><p>Right as Harry was about to remove Severus' shirt, the floo flared up and the deep voice of Hogwarts headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. "Severus, I'd like to talk to you and Harry in my office immediately."</p><p>Severus stopped kissing Harry instantly and growled out a reply, "Yes, headmaster." He stood up and redid the buttons of his shirt.</p><p>Harry groaned loudly and fixed his clothes. 'god damn you, Albus Dumbledore' The lion got up and ran a hand through his ruffled hair.</p><p>The potions master looked Harry up and down. "Your hair is a mess." He stepped closer and ran his fingers through Harry's hair; his other hand reaching around lion's waist.</p><p>Colour tinted Harry's cheeks. "Severus. I very much wish to continue, but the headmaster is waiting.."</p><p>Sev sighed and leaned closer. "Forget the headmaster, are we presentable?" He kissed him lightly before continuing. "I think not."</p><p>Harry Smiled, "What is not presentable my look, Severus?"</p><p>Severus pondered for a moment before letting go of Harry and walking towards the mantle; he smirked. "Nothing yet, <cite><strong>Harry.</strong></cite>"</p><p>The Gryffindor shivered in anticipation before following him. "Is that a promise?"</p><p>"You'll have to stick around to find out." He smiled slightly as he grabbed the floo powder. "Albus Dumbledore's Office."</p><p>"You already know I will." He walked into the floo after Severus.</p><p>Albus gestured to the seats in front of his desk as they walked out of the giant fireplace; he waited until they were seated before speaking. "I know what you both feel and I know you both can't wait, but can you withhold yourselves in front of your peers for a few moments?"</p><p>Severus snorted, "Honestly Albus, we're not first years. We're more mature than that."</p><p>"I know Severus. I was asking Harry. Harry, how do you feel?"</p><p>Harry nodded calmly, "I'll be fine sir."</p><p>"Good." Albus spoke, "I don't often allow this sort of relationship to happen in my school, but seeing as Harry is of age, and you and him are the very reason that this school hasn’t been destroyed. I will allow this private relationship to proceed if you both give consent and keep the relationship to a need to know basis. Do you agree and consent, to be in a serious sexual and emotional relationship with Severus?"</p><p>"Yes, I do headmaster. I have felt these feelings for a couple of years and I'm willing to do anything to be with him, sir. I hope you can understand."</p><p>"I understand, my dear boy. I just have to check. Surely, you both know the challenges you face if you're....involved with one another."</p><p>"Yes, we do, sir, but I feel that we can overcome any of the challenges we might be faced with as long as we are together; right, Severus.?" He smiled over at him and held out his hand.</p><p>Severus glared at Harry before taking his hand. "Yes, I agree."</p><p>Albus smiled, "Well then, I think I interrupted something." He winked at Harry as Sev choked slightly.</p><p>Harry chuckled a little, "Indeed, may we return and resume sir?"</p><p>Severus stared at the gall of the boy. 'Damn Gryffindor bravery, but it suits him. He makes it seem.......sexy....in an innoce- NO! Stop yourself right now before you get too attached' "Yes Albus, as Mister Potter pointed out so vehemently, may we-" He coughed slightly. "Resume with our ...uh.... Activities with no more interruptions. "</p><p>"Ah yes, You may go, but please do take this gift bag as a token of my approval. You will find all the <cite><strong>necessary</strong></cite> items for your activity. Now if you will excuse me." He handed Harry the gift bag and walked them to the fireplace.</p><p>Harry flushed at the gift, but accepts the offered bag.</p><p>The potions master glared at the bag and sighed. "Well? Let's go, Mister. Let's return and resume."</p><p>"Yes, sir!" The lion nodded a goodbye to the headmaster and followed Severus.</p><p>"Go <cite><strong>easy</strong></cite> on him, Severus. As far as I know, our friend here is ripe." Albus winked toward Harry again.</p><p>"Wha-... That's his business, Albus. If he so wishes to tell me, I shall accommodate accordingly."</p><p>That comment threw Harry off guard, while resulting in a rosy red blush covering Harry's cheeks and glanced at Severus shyly.</p><p>Severus noticed the glance and inwardly groaned. <cite>'Oh for the love of Merlin'</cite> "Now, Harry lets go back. He grabs the floo powder; throws it in the fire before announcing, "Severus Snape's Personal Quarters."</p><p>Harry followed Severus into the floo but stopped a few paces in Severus' chambers. "The headmaster is right..I-I am a virgin. Severus, be gentle; at least for the first time. Please?"</p><p>Severus pinched the bridge of his nose. "I never intend to hurt you Harry." He sighed and sat on the edge of the bed. "I would <cite><strong>never</strong></cite> do anything you're uncomfortable with.</p><p>"I never said nor thought that you would hurt me Severus. I trust you more than anyone in this world." Harry approached the bed, lifted Severus' head with his hand and kissed him while sliding onto Severus' lap.</p><p>The professor wrapped his arms around Harry's waist to hold him there, as he kissed him back. "Again, why? I was only ever mean to you. I- I was the reason your parents were murdered and you got that scar. I don't deserve happiness, I don't deserve your love."</p><p>"Someone once told me that kids tease the person they like because they can't tell them how they really feel yet. Everyone deserves happiness Severus, Regardless of your thoughts I believe you deserve my love; all the love I have is for you and only you, Severus Snape." He smiled brightly.</p><p><cite>'Damn this boy'</cite> "But harry..." Severus stared at his bright smile, undeservingly. "I'm bound to the Dark Lord. How do you forgive that. I did it willingly.....I wasn't forced or coerced. It was my choice..."</p><p>"I know that, but I still choose you; we cannot judge who we love or how we love them. I will not stop loving you, just because of Voldemort." The lion coloured lightly, "Plus, I can't deny that I actually like how sexy that mark looks on you. I couldn't hate it even if I tried."</p><p>Severus was baffled to say the least; he glanced at his left arm and back to harry. "How?"</p><p>Harry's blush deepened as he spoke, "It's hard to explain, but when I see it on you it... um.. turns me on. I just feel like kissing or licking the mark..is that weird?"</p><p>The older wizard couldn't help but chuckle and kiss Harry's forehead. "Only in the most <cite><strong>sexiest</strong></cite> way."</p>
