          <div class="userstuff"><p>Chan awoke with a groan as his bunkmate, Seungmin, jumped to the ground in a frantic hustle, he must’ve overslept for class again. Chan ruffled his brown curly locks, he could tell trying to tame his hair would be troublesome today. He raked his hand through his hair trying to calm the angry curls while looking around the room, still trying to recover from the haziness of sleep. The room smelled of warm and stagnant morning breath with undertones of body odor. Cramming a bunch of Ravenclaw teen boys into one room was bound to create a disgusting cocktail of smells, but really anything beats living alone. Chan hated being alone.</p><p>Now that Chan had been forced awake, rather than snoozing his alarm clock for ten more minutes he decided to put an effort in making himself look moderately presentable for his Divination course. Chan normally woke up roughly ten to fifteen minutes before the class started and rushed his way through the cold stone hallways to the other side of the castle. He just had little to no interest in Divination magic even if the professor was interesting enough to hold his attention. Chan didn’t have the so-called ‘Third Eye’ that one truly needs to possess for this course to hold any lasting worth. Chan would rather be putting his efforts in courses like Defense Against the Dark Arts but unfortunately, that comes later in his education. </p><p>Chan moved his stiff legs to hang off the side of his bed pondering on whether he wanted to change his undergarments or not. He ultimately decided against searching through his cluttered bedside-closet. Peeling off his sweaty nightwear he haphazardly dressed in his school Ravenclaw uniform that had a lovely brown stain adorning the collar. The other day Jisung, his long-time Gryffindor friend, had kindly given him an ever so dramatic rendition of his latest failed potions assignment that had coffee spewing from his mouth. </p><p>Lovely. Chan had thought to himself. He was a slob at times but this was a bit too embarrassing. Aside from Professor Trelawney’s unorthodox teaching methods in the Arts of Divination course, Chan had found himself glancing over at his desk partner more and more often as the days passed. </p><p>Lee Felix, a boy with bright brown eyes and handsome freckles sprinkled along his cheekbones that only seemed to accentuate his aberrant sense of style. Chan often wondered how he could get away with his various fandangles that he liked to add to his Hufflepuff robes. As odd and divergent from the average Hogwarts’ scholar as he is, Chan found him alluring. Out of pure interest in his character or something else, he couldn’t quite pinpoint the origin of his attraction.</p><p>After coming to terms with his underwhelming appearance in the cracked mirror of the boy's dormitory, Chan started his now routine walk to his class, now only have about ten minutes to make it to the other side of the ancient citadel. The stone walls and assorted floor-to-wall glass windows often made the hallways of Hogwarts unnaturally cold during the Winter semester. Snow has yet to mask the school grounds and Chan is not sure he’ll be able to pull himself away from his warm bed for this Divination course once the heavy snow decides to fall. Chan grumbles to himself while rubbing at the goosebumps that have formed on the top of his wrists. His fingers snag on the black bracelet adorning his left wrist that he received from Jisung from a summer trip they took together. He groans at the memory, cursing the cold weather quietly to himself.</p><p>With heavy breaths he finally arrived at the North Tower, climbing up the ladder to the reach for the heavier trapdoor to the classroom. Once he entered the classroom Professor Trelawney glanced at him briefly before continuing to pass out teacups and dishes of tea leaves to each desk couple. She didn’t seem to mind him being a few moments late, so Chan proceeded to find his seat keeping head down. </p><p>Apparently we’re doing some tea nonsense today? Great, definitely won’t be able to stay awake today.</p><p>While muttering negative nothings to himself he manages to make eye contact with the aforementioned Hufflepuff. Chan’s heart pulled tightly somewhere deep in his chest, cheeks warming up. It felt like Felix was staring through him, not looking at him, maybe analyzing him? Whatever was happening was making Chan feel exposed in an odd way. It always felt like Felix knew exactly was going through Chan’s head despite them not being well-acquainted outside of class.</p><p>“Chan? Come sit, we have an exciting assignment to try today. Did you read the homework packet?” Felix chirped while grabbing at Chan’s icy hands and pulling him to his assigned seat situated immediately to Felix’s left. Felix’s lingering touch left Chan feeling dizzy and tongue-tied.</p><p>“U-um” fuck, his voice certainly just cracked. Chan wondered why he was so nervous, it’s just Felix, weird, strange, and lovely-</p><p>Chan might be whipped.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I forgot to read the packet. Today was supposed to be a lab, wasn’t it? I completely forgot. I couldn’t detach Jisung from my side yesterday, he was next level clingy. I couldn’t find the time to do the reading.” Chan faked a laugh in an attempt to hide the fact that he is going through some kind of internal turmoil over his feelings for Lee Felix. </p><p>“Oh, I see. That Jisung kid is something else, huh?” he giggles quietly in his soft, deep voice. Fuck, maybe he’s kinda cute. “Well, today we’re attempting Tessomancy, predicting the future by use of tea leaves. The leaves can be very vague but it gives the curious querent a glimpse into their near future. I think it’s pretty neat…” he trails off a bit at the end of his thought.</p><p>“Today’s lab is supposed to be kinda short, when we’re finished we can leave! So, let’s attempt to take a glance into your future? If that’s okay. I’m a little wary about meddling in predictions of my own. I’d rather stay ignorant.” Felix says as he places some of the loose black tea leaves at the bottom of the teacup. Chan nods in response allowing Felix to lead the lab. Felix moves Chan’s hands to sit on either side of the teacup and explains “In order for this to work properly, I need you to focus on a clear and concise question in your head to ask the leaves.” </p><p>A clear and concise question? Chan thinks to himself for a moment. He decides on asking what the next four years will hold for him in the way of major events. Chan knew he was destined for ill-fated circumstances, so he wasn’t really worried about what he might see, rather, he was interested in seeing if anything positive may be awaiting him. </p><p>“Okay, I have my question” Chan confirms and Felix begins pouring the hot water in a swirling motion from the teapot that Professor Trelawney had left on their desk. </p><p>“As the water cools, you’ll need to continue thinking about your question while you sip, but you should leave just about one tablespoon of water at the bottom.” With that Chan blows at the steaming liquid, Felix’s stares and his glowing demeanor is proving to be quite distracting. With unsteady hands, Chan sips at the tea trying to avoid swallowing any of the loose black tea leaves. The tea doesn’t taste much of anything, just like sipping hot water, not that Chan really minded. It just feels a bit awkward to be doing something like this as a lab. </p><p>Professor Trelawney was going on about something at the front of the classroom while carefully observing the students work their way through the lab. No one really listens to her, she’s always saying something. She makes a comment in the direction of Chan and Felix. </p><p>“You both are doing so well, truly natural-born seers I am sure.” The comment feels more directed towards Felix, but it is nice to hear words of affirmation. Chan doesn’t hear many good things about his wizarding skills outside of this course. Professor Trelawney might be too kind. Nevertheless, Chan was thankful for the kind words and Felix’s face seemed to be beaming from the compliment so that’s a plus too. </p><p>Gosh, why do I keep thinking like that? Am I gay? Oh my gosh, am I gay!?</p><p>Chan had finished drinking most of the liquid and looked to Felix for further instruction. Felix turned the page of the homework packet to make sure he was following the directions correctly and with a self-reassuring hum, he explained the next step.</p><p>“Okay, from here on you need to hold the cup in your left hand and swirl the remaining liquid three times from left to right” Chan followed Felix’s instructions with ease, “Then you need to hold the cup upside down above the saucer for about a minute, and remember to concentrate on your question as well.” Chan continues on as instructed by the freckled-boy. Chan’s hand is shaking slightly from lingering anxiety and lactic acid build up in his bicep after holding the cup in place for a minute. “Okay, please rotate the cup upside down three more times before turning it upright with the handle pointed south which is in the direction of the classroom exit according to Professor Trelawney.” Chan’s eyebrows knit together in concentration. Tessonacy is such a tedious form of magic, literally, nothing but a Mr. Lee Felix could ever get him to do an assignment like this. If not for his deskmate Chan would be skipping class way more often.</p><p>“Damn, this is quite a process, but you’re a really great teacher. I hope I am doing okay.” Chan laughs again trying to fill the awkward air with something other than stares and lab instruction. </p><p>“Thanks, but I’m really not. You’re doing fine, don’t worry too much.” Felix reassures Chan and his chest does that thing again. These feelings are new and confusing and sudden. Chan really doesn’t know what to do. He looks down at the bottom of the teacup but can’t really make out anything, in particular, just looks like a bunch of soggy tea bits. With a shrug, Chan looks over to Felix for guidance in deciphering whatever the tea leaves are trying to tell him. </p><p>“Interesting…” Felix trails off again to herself. “I can make out a few different things, but don’t take my word for anything. I’ve only done this a few times.” He tries to explain and Chan gives an awkward and rushed  “It’s okay, don’t worry about it” in response. </p><p>“Okay, so I see a sorta cross which could indicate that trials and suffering await for you” although the content is seemingly dark Felix delivers the information blankly with no indication of concern or worry. Almost like he already knew. “I also see something that resembles a sun, pretty straightforward, but it usually indicates happiness or the feeling of being content in something. So it’s a bit confusing, it appears you will suffer at some point in your near future but you will, in the end, have happiness.” He says matter-of-factly.</p><p>“Somehow I feel a little bit relieved by that, to be honest, I was expecting worse. At least I know I have something to look forward to at the end of whatever bad things come my way.” Chan tries to fake a smile but his effort falls through.</p><p>Felix looks to the cup again, “I also see something here on the edge that looks like an angel” he shows Chan and continues his explanation, “an angel indicates the possibility of a growing love that will last indefinitely, I think that is pretty positive. It seems you’ll meet someone who will treat your heart kindly.” Felix’s eyes look sad at that, Chan can’t help but wonder why. Something deep inside himself urges him to say something, anything, why does he always stand around and wait for things to come his way. He should start acting on things he’s passionate about, start taking chances without thinking too much about what is expected of him. Enough with the prophecies.</p><p>Chan turns his body in Felix’s direction, heart racing, and a blush deepening on the highpoints of his cheeks. Without thinking he grabs Felix’s hands while keeping his gaze on his own bouncing knees. Chan slowly lifts his chin, adjusting the tight collar of his uniform and makes eye contact with Felix. His facial expression hasn’t changed. He wears the same curious and bright exterior. </p><p>“Felix I-”</p><p>Chan’s left elbow makes a graceless scrap against the teacup and its soppy contents seep into the front of Chan’s uniform slacks, promptly decorating them with an unattractive wet pattern. Face flaming with embarrassment, Chan stands with his eyes directed at the floor as he makes a quick race for the exit of the classroom.</p><p>“Chan, please wait!” Felix tries but is met with the disappointing slam of the classroom trapdoor. Felix has an idea of what Chan was intending to ask but it seems as though the question was not in the cards for this universe. Felix’s heartaches, his feelings for the Ravenclaw were strong and the thought of the curly-haired boy often invaded his thoughts, but he was unsure if he was the one Chan needed. After today’s course assignment he couldn’t be sure, he’ll just have to wait and let things fall into place.</p></div>
