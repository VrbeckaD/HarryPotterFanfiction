          <div class="userstuff"><p>If the worlds of How To Train Your Dragon and Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them merged, then Percival Graves would be a dragon. Specifically, Percival Graves would be a night fury with lightning speed, deadly aim, and the ability to strike fear into even the most stalwart of hearts, and Newt Scamander would be the talking fish bone that shot him down.</p>
<p>Shot. Him. Down.</p>
<p><em>Shot</em> him – Graves is going to <em>eviscerate</em> the son of a bitch. What is he, a meatlug? No, he’s an effing <em>night fury</em> this is embarrassing. Humiliating! He’s stuck in a net in a grassy glade, he thinks he just saw a <em>bunny rabbit</em> gambol by, and just as soon as he gets out of here and gets back to that pissing village in the middle of pissing nowhere he’s going to <em>annihilate them</em>.</p>
<p>Graves is not taking it well, this whole being shot down business. He takes it even less well when the fish bone in question stumbles into the clearing, because does Graves’ killer <em>have</em> to be so obnoxiously cute? Look at him! It’s like getting defeated by a day old puppy! Look, he’s - he’s <em>cooing</em> at Graves. Is he allowed to do that? Graves doesn’t think he should be allowed to do that. Graves doesn’t - stop. No. No touchy. Graves is a demon of the night, he does <em>not</em> want scritches, he wants to rain fire and fury on…</p>
<p>Graves wants left a bit. Left, left just a bit - <em>oooooohhhhh</em> there, right behind the ear.</p>
<p>“You’re not a monster,” Newt whispers in awe. “I knew it.” He laughs, and Graves jerks back because sorry <em>what</em>, does he look like the sort of dragon that can be casually laughed at, no he does <em>not</em> so please refrain from making fun of him <em>if you don't mind</em>. “It’s ok!” Newt says, raising his hands and staying in place. “It’s ok, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you. We’re ok.”</p>
<p>Excuse you, <em>we</em> are not ok because <em>we</em> are still tangled in a sodding net. We are now even <em>less</em> ok because <em>what is that knife</em> <em>put it back -</em></p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Look, Newt was it? Newt. Look, Newt. What was the fecking <em>point</em> of shooting Graves down (shooting! him! <em>down!</em>) if you were just going to come back and cut him loose? Do you have even the faintest <em>concept</em> of warfare? Did you <em>forget</em> that your and Graves’ entire <em>species</em> hate each others’ guts and spend every night trying to stab, flambe, and skewer each other?</p>
<p>
  <em>would you quit cooing graves is not beautiful</em>
</p>
<p>Graves is leaving now. Newt can take his wide eyes and his floofy hair and his ear scritches to someone who actually cares because Graves does not. No. Bye bye. Graves out.</p>
<p>And Graves <em>is</em> out, because in this iteration he kept his tail tucked in and never lost the fin, so he opens his wings with a dramatic <em>crack</em>, tilts them to catch the sun just <em>so</em>, and with a final side-eye to make sure Newt is watching with appropriate awe he snaps his wings down and <em>fwoom</em> he’s gone. The whole sorry episode is behind him. Sayonara, Newt, Graves won’t miss you.</p>
<p>Except, next night, <em>next night</em> there’s Newt trying to pat a <em>hookfang</em> because apparently he now believes that all dragons are just Misunderstood™ and won’t <em>shish kabob him</em> good fucking god does Graves have to everything around here.</p>
<p>Stop squirming, Newt, Graves is rescuing you.</p>
<p>
  <em>do not fucking coo</em>
</p>
<p>And the rescue is going swimmingly, Graves is angling back to the village to drop Newt off with his own kind who will hopefully sit on him and keep him out of danger (not that they’ve done a good job of that so far, Graves will Have Words with them about this) - but why, please, is there a horde of vikings following Graves?</p>
<p>Why does the big viking at the front with the <em>four</em> battle axes look strikingly like Newt, and why is he frothing at the mouth in rage?</p>
<p>And <em>why</em> did that particular viking think it was a good idea to <em>throw his axes</em> at Graves does he not realise that the axe could have hit Newt??? Admittedly it was a hell of a throw and aimed very much at Graves’ <em>head</em> rather than his feet where Newt was ineffectively trying to pry himself free, but still. Still! It was the principle of the thing.</p>
<p>Actually. Actually, if Graves is talking about principles, then Graves is not leaving Newt with these brutes. He’s far too good for them. They don’t even <em>wash</em> Graves can smell them from here. Newt, new plan. You’re coming with Graves. He has a cave and a mountain, you’ll love it, he’ll provide the fish and you provide the scritches. It’s a solid plan. A+. Well done Graves. Graves will even allow Newt to coo, if it makes him that happy. Sometimes. Once a day.</p>
<p>One coo. (1). Per day.</p>
<p>Graves may come to regret this.</p></div>
