    <p>The autumn night air was crisp and clean In Privet Drive, Little Whinging Surrey, but it was too clean for Tom’s taste. He hated this place just as much if not more than his <em> sweet </em> Harry did — he would burn the neighborhood to the ground like he did to his orphanage if he could. Tom had a fixed location he was aiming for… #4 Privet Drive. He had waited for years and now he could finally serve them the justice they so rightfully deserved.</p><p> </p><p>He had to suppress the evil laugh that was begging to come out. He would take care of Harry’s relatives and then he would find a safe house somewhere. </p><p> </p><p>Tom frowned, he would have gone to his other original self if not for the fact that he was trying to kill <em> sweet </em> Harry. Moreover he needed to get Harry’s trunk and personal belongings, he supposed he could ask that crazy elf Dobby for help.</p><p> </p><p>The thought of getting help from a house-elf was laughable to some wizards but not Tom, he had seen what they could do when they became vengeful. Old Mrs. Smith was a fine example of that, even if Dumbledore kept crying that it was Tom who had done it. Tom wanted to snort, it had been her son that had given him the locket claiming that he had known that it was his based off of how he acted around Mrs. Smith. After that he didn’t hear from the man until he called for him on his deathbed.</p><p> </p><p>Tom stopped mid-thought as he arrived at the front door of Harry’s childhood nightmare. The only light on was the one in the living room, he could hear that giant oaf Vernon as he laughed loudly at something his wife said.</p><p> </p><p>The loud, obnoxious pig, if there was one thing he hated most about that family it was that the men were fat and overly loud pigs — that included Vernon’s sister because there was no way that Tom was going to expect that a pig like her was a woman — and the women were underweight and whores. </p><p>He knew that His <em> sweet </em> Harry had been called a whore a number of times not knowing what that word meant until he got to Hogwarts and had library access. The first time it happened Tom had screamed as loud as he could that he would kill Vernon for even saying that <em> his </em> Harry was unclean — he was glad that the rape threats were never carried out but still angry that they happened — and today would be the day he made due on his promise.</p><p> </p><p>He had another thought that his other self might enjoy, he was going to take the woman and give her as a gift to his death eaters, they hadn’t had a play thing in some time and he knew Bellatrix loved her sexual torture. He just had to figure out if he wanted to go in person or to send a house-elf. </p><p> </p><p>He knew that he had to get into the house but he didn’t want the family to know that he was there so he used the backyard. </p><p> </p><p>He also knew that he could not use a wand, he remembered that Harry had been lied to when he was told that he couldn't do magic. The funny thing was that the trace only picks up the magic of house-elves, wand use and the magic of other adults but not wandless magic. After all, it was harder to track and the trace was just something made so that the ministry had an excuse to expel muggle-borns or muggle raised. It was pathetic and cheap, Tom had been spitting mad when he found out, three years after graduating Hogwarts.</p><p> </p><p>He slipped into the backyard unseen by anyone and used a wandless unlocking spell on the back door. Oh how he loved wandless magic, there were no words spoken and no way to know what spell was being cast. </p><p> </p><p>He slipped into the house without making a sound, as he did so he began to put up some wards that would lock everything making escape impossible and the strongest silencing wards he knew. </p><p> </p><p>They wouldn’t be able to escape and no one would be able to hear them scream. </p><p> </p><p>He took pleasure in this knowledge, it made him feel almost godlike. And tonight he was their god, for he would be bringing his divine punishment on them. He almost snorted at how arrogant that thought sounded, he was sure his other self would get a kick out of that thought. </p><p> </p><p>For now he wouldn’t think about it, he had some pigs to kill and a horse to be gifted as a play thing to some death eaters. </p><p> </p><p>Not many in Dumbledore’s order know but when it became hard for his people to have children, they had kidnapped some muggles for breeding. Those muggles were no longer alive but their half-blood children were. The people were on board for the idea as it was no secret that Voldemort was a half-blood and very powerful.</p><p> </p><p>Before Draco was born the Malfoy’s had almost given up on having a child the mother would not have to blood adopt. When lady Malfoy became pregnant they had been so scared that he may be born a stillbirth. He was sure that Petunia the horse would do good for one of the pure blood families in need of a surrogate mother.</p><p> </p><p>He knew for sure that he was going to kill the husband,but he was almost surprised to see their son at home. He knew the boy went to a school with dorms — he asumed that perhaps school had been cancelled for him, it didn’t matter anyway because it saved him the trouble of looking for the school so he could murder the boy in his sleep.</p><p> </p><p>He silently cast a spell to keep the Dursleys in their occupation as he walked over to face them. When they saw him Dudley squeaked like the pig he was, Petunia turned pale, and Vernon became so purple with anger it was almost funny.</p><p> </p><p>“Boy! What are you doing here! You're supposed to be at that freak school!” </p><p> </p><p>Vernon’s shouting reminded Tom that the body he was using was not his but dear <em> sweet </em> Harry’s, this time Tom really did laugh causing the piglet and horse to become paler than before. The pig spewing some nonsense about him not being able to do magic outside of school and how he’ll be expelled. Which only made Tom laugh harder, he couldn’t help it; they were so stupid that they couldn’t see that they were going to die… well maybe not the woman but you get the point. </p><p> </p><p>Tom/<em> Harry </em> straightened himself and stopped laughing, he looked at the so called family that <em> sweet </em> Harry was disposed to with his red eyes and sneered. The woman screamed something about him being a devil which made him smile that evil smile he had perfected during his youth.</p><p> </p><p><em> This </em> was no family of Harry’s, he wouldn’t allow them to call themselves Harry’s <em> family </em> when they had only ever caused his <em> sweet </em> Harry pain.</p><p> </p><p>He had waited years for this moment and he would not waste it, fifteen years is a long time to wait but it was worth the wait because now he was at full power and he could use magic without hurting or killing Harry. </p><p> </p><p>He knew what he was going to do, his smile only grew wider as he thought of it, he summoned a knife from the kitchen which made the woman shriek in fright. He would not touch the woman, as she would be with his sex starved death eaters, he breifly wounder if the Malfoy’s would want another child. After all the Malfoy’s up until Lucius had two or three children and he knew that Narcissa wouldn’t mind adopting a child as long as it was Lucius’s child.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve been <em> bad </em> little <em> pets </em>” he said in a singsong tone as he moved toward Vernon.</p><p> </p><p>“What did you say you fre-” Vernon was cut off by his own scream as Tom, using Harry’s body, plunged the knife into Vernon’s hand.</p><p> </p><p>“What? I didn’t quite hear you over your screams,”</p><p> </p><p>“You frea-” Tom pulled the knife out of his hand and stabbed his other hand with more force than he had before.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah ah” he said as if scolding a child “That’s a very bad word that will be punished,”</p><p> </p><p>Tom pulled the knife out his hand and walked up to pig #2. He was going to enjoy this, the best torture was the mental kind. He would hurt their son as they begged over and over again for it to stop, he then would kill the boy and move on to the husband, slowly breaking the wife. He would break the woman even more when he gave her to his other self for breeding, it didn’t matter what she looked like as long as she could have children.</p><p> </p><p>Getting children out of Muggles was easier than magical because there was no magic involved, a wizard could get a Muggle woman pregnant as many times as he wanted, while using the proper spells to make sure that she didn’t try and kill the child and that there was a low possibility of miscarage.</p><p> </p><p>Tom plunged the knife into the piglet's hands just like he had done to it’s father’s hand. The horse and pig started screaming at him to not touch their son but he didn’t care. All he cared about was getting revenge on the ones that hurt his <em> sweet </em> Harry. He began to cut Dudley’s fingers off one by one not paying attention to the angry screams of the father or the wails of the boy’s stressed mother. Only the screams of agony that <em> Harry’s </em> childhood tormator made.</p><p> </p><p> Once all of the boy's fingers were all cut off he used a wandless fire spell on them to cook them and force fed them to the reluctant boy, making sure that he didn’t spit or puke them out. If the boy wanted to be a pig he could eat himself. He cut the fat and meat off the boy and did the same thing to them as the fingers. </p><p> </p><p>By the time he was done the boy had stopped screaming and all his flesh was inside his stomach. The boy was still alive somehow but he wouldn’t be for long.</p><p> </p><p>Tom could hear the two parents sobbing grossly, it disgusted him. The only thing Muggles were good for was breeding, they were filthy and vile but at least they were good for something.</p><p> </p><p>Tom turned his attention to the bigger and started to do the same thing to him as his son but he first cut off his dick, he didn’t need it anymore anyway as he would be dead and his wife would be with his death eaters at the end of the night. Not that the man or woman knew that, it was better not to tell them, than to have them know and try to fight it.</p><p>When he was done with his work Vernon had stopped screaming blood murder — heh — and was now only hanging on to life by a tread just like his son. Tom cast a wandless spell that made them feel and see everything they had done to Harry in Harry’s prospective. It was a wonderful spell that he took great pleasure in casting. </p><p> </p><p>He turned to the unconscious woman and transfigured her into a Piglet just for the kicks and giggles. He picked her up, and, after making sure that any trace of his magic was gone, left the house as quietly as he had come.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t until he was as far away from Surrey as possible and had placed some anti-trace wards on Harry’s wand that he called for a house-elf. When she appeared he was surprised to see how small she was.</p><p> </p><p>“Master called Tracy, What can Tracy be doing for Master?” she asked, playing with her hands.</p><p> </p><p>“Take this to Voldemort, it’s only transfigured. Let him know that if the Malfoy’s want another child she will do, even if it’s not done willingly, when they and anyone else who wants a child is done with her Bella can have her as a play thing. Also, tell him that his horcrux is safe but he needs to know that Harry Potter is the container, and that if he tries to confine us he is in for a big surprise. Oh and we’ll be in Mom’s old home if he wants to find us in three days” he ordered as he gave the woman turned pig to the elf. She bowed before ‘popping’ away.</p><p> </p><p>Tom took a shortcut to the old shack that was his mother's childhood nightmare which was right next Riddle manor, which he remembered that his father hated just as much as him. The day he killed the Riddles he had used Legilimency on his father, the things he saw pissed him off enough to kill everyone in the manor.</p><p> </p><p>He didn’t care that his father regretted leaving his mother, the only reason he regretted it was because of the possible child she claimed to have. He only cared about if he had an heir or not and that set Tom off. He had promptly rid himself of his Muggle father’s names and made a new name for himself but now it seemed that he would have to take up his Father’s filthy name once again. Which both relieved him and pissed him off; it relieved him because that was the name Harry liked most, and pissed him off because he had wanted to rid himself of his past.</p><p> </p><p>As he arrived at the disgusting shack he almost regretted making this the meet up place. He went to find a room in the filthy place and cleaned it up so that it was acceptable to sleep in. </p><p> </p><p>He imagined that later, when he had a long awaited talk with his <em> sweet </em> and stubborn Harry, the child would go on a cleaning spree. The mental image was hilarious and for it to happen would be amusing.</p><p> </p><p>But first there was something more important than talking to Harry and that was getting Harry’s belongings, he knew just what elf to use as he had always kept Harry’s secrets. The thought of using that elf scared him a bit because it was a little too crazy from it’s abuse by the hands of the owners before the Malfoy’s. He remembered when Narcissa brought the shaky little thing home, he had never seen or heard Lucius squeak or jump in fright before in his life.  </p><p> </p><p>He called Dobby and gave him instructions to gather all of Harry’s belongings from Hogwarts and his relatives' house, and if anything was destroyed to let him know. If anything was stolen he was to take it away from the thief and punish them. Dobby was all too happy to do it and <em> ‘Popped’ </em> away with a skip.</p><p>Now, to talk to his <em> sweet </em>Harry.</p>
