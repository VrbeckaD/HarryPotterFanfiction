          <div class="userstuff"><p>Ron Weasley <em>really</em> hates third-wheeling.</p><p>He’s been the third wheel more often than not in his life, around Ginny and Harry, Harry and Hermione, Harry and <em>Malfoy</em> for fuck’s sake (never let it be said that Harry has any taste in partners at all). And frankly? It sucks.</p><p>Not only do you get to watch two people snog each other’s faces off (yay, thanks for the spit-swap show) but you <em>also</em> get to be super uncomfortable as they coo nonsensical pet names at each other, and feel even more keenly the lack of love in your life. The third wheel is destined to always be alone, watching others seal their happiness with a kiss as they languish in the depths of unloved coldness.</p><p>
  <em>Alone again, naturally… </em>
</p><p>Ron remembers one time when he, Harry and Malfoy had been out doing something or the other, he can’t remember. (Turns out Malfoy isn’t actually that bad when he drops the prissy princess act. Who knew?) They’d bought sandwiches, and Harry’s and Malfoy’s had sat neglected on the bench as they snogged. Ron had loudly coughed and made comments about their mouths being lunch for each other instead, but <em>they hadn’t fucking stopped</em>. It was as if all they knew was each other. It had destroyed Ron’s appetite so completely that he couldn’t even finish his own sandwich. Cue gasp.</p><p>Ah, well. It’s a good thing that he isn’t the third wheel this time around, Ron decides, and leans in to kiss Harry as Hermione watches with a mildly horrified look on her face. This time it’s <em>his</em> turn to know nothing but the person he’s kissing, suck on <em>that</em>, Hermione.</p><p>Like he said, Harry has no taste in partners. He’s just lucky that he happens to be the king of ‘no taste’.</p></div>
