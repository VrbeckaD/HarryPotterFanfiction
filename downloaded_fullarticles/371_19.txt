    <p>“Harry James Potter!  What in the here do you think you’re doing?”</p>
<p>Harry looked up from his place on the couch in front of the fireplace, biscuit half-way to his mouth.</p>
<p>“Er, watching the telly?”</p>
<p>Draco clenched his fists as he took in his husband, who’d apparently floo’d home and immediately changed clothes; he was currently wearing his old Gryffindor sweatpants, fluffy socks, and his favorite Weasley sweater.</p>
<p>“And why, pray tell, are you watching the telly?”  He takes a deep breath, trying to rein in his anger.  “We are supposed to be at The Burrow in fifteen minutes!”</p>
<p>“What?  Why?”</p>
<p>Draco gave him a scathing look, taking another deep breath.  If he wasn’t careful, he might become a widower tonight.</p>
<p>“Because, our Godchildren are having their birthday party.”</p>
<p>“But, it’s Wednesday!  Why in the here would they have a party in the middle of the week?”  </p>
<p>Harry was still laying in the middle of the couch, biscuit still in his hand.  Draco could feel his face redden in anger more by the second.  Seriously, love-of-his-life or not, he was going to kill him.</p>
<p>“Molly explained it during Sunday dinner!  I know you and George were talking, but George even clarified!  Charlie is in the country today and tomorrow only, so they are having it tonight!  Get up!  Get dressed!  We have to go!”</p>
<p>Harry had finally sat up on the couch.  He sighed, setting the biscuit down on the table and ran his hand through his hair and down his face.  “I don’t feel like dealing with a family party tonight, Draco.  I don’t want to go.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean you don’t want to go?  This is your family!  You have to be there!”</p>
<p>“I don’t, actually,” Harry said with another sigh.  “I’ve had a long, exhausting day, and all I want to do is sit in front of the telly and relax.  Why don’t you join me?  It won’t be the end of the world if we don’t show up to one party.”  He patted the couch seat beside him.  “Come on, we can get take-out, watch a movie, and just enjoy a quiet evening in.”</p>
<p>Draco stood there staring at Harry.  “We promised we’d be there, Harry.  You promised, on Sunday.  You told ‘Mione you would be.”</p>
<p>Harry sighed.  “I just don’t feel like it.  I’m too exhausted.  You can go, but I’m not.”</p>
<p>He looked up at Draco as he reached for the biscuit, again.  Draco gaped at him for a few moments, mouth opening to say something, but snapped shut as he looked up at the clock on the wall.  </p>
<p>“Fine.  Great.  Wonderful.”  He pulled on his traveling cloak before he grabbed the gifts that he had sat on the coffee table and walked quickly towards the front door.  As he grabbed the handle, Harry spoke up.</p>
<p>“Draco, I—”</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, not turning around to look at him.  “Harry, I can’t do this for much longer.  I love you, more than anything in the world, but I…”  He took another deep breath, shaking his head.  “I’ve got to go.”  He stepped out onto the front stoop, twisting away.</p>
