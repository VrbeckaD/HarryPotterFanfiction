    <p>Azaria Pettigrew was excited to wake up. Unlike normal, when she would sleep in until her mother had to drag her out of bed. But last December, while her brother Peter was home for the holidays (including her New Year's Eve birthday) she finally started showing obvious accidental magic. She was eleven, then, so it had been happening for years in various tiny ways, but on her eleventh birthday, she duplicated her cake by accident because she thought it was too small. Then, three weeks ago, she got a letter from Hogwarts just like her brother. Azaria was thrilled. Ten months without her big brother had been torture, except of course the many owl-post letters that detailed his studies and his friends and their pranks and the <em>houses</em>. Now she gets to go with him. Hogwarts sounded amazing, and as much as Azaria loved her parents, being muggle just sounded so dull to her now that she was a wizard. </p><p>Today, Azaria was excited to wake up because her parents were taking them to Peter's wizard friend's house. From there, Peter and she would be given enough muggle coin to exchange into wizard money for their school things, and then they would go home and wait to hear that their children were safely in Hogwarts. Peter’s wizard friends would care for them for the remaining week until departure. When Azaria's eyes blinked open at 7 AM before her brother and parents were awake, she got herself ready and made herself a bowl of hot cereal. She was halfway through when Peter came downstairs and her parents followed shortly. She was the only one dressed. </p><p>Everyone finished eating and Azaria waited until her parents and Peter returned in clothes before she put her shoes on. Peter and she scrambled out the door together, both rather uncoordinated and tripping over themselves. Azaria managed to right herself with the door handle, and she wasn’t sure what Peter had done, but he didn’t look happy when they made eye contact through the back windows. </p><p>Their father had the keys and he traipsed to the car in a lazy morning pace, and unlocked the siblings' doors before unlocking his own and stretched over the centre console to unlock his wife’s. He buckled in and waited, watching the rear-view mirror, for Azaria and Peter to do the same. He turned the car on and off he went in the direction of Potter Manor. </p><p>Azaria grinned from ear to ear the entire way there. Knowing she would soon be surrounded by magic and wouldn’t need to do as many things by herself. She was excited to meet someone she heard about in most of Peter’s letters: James. He sounded like a wonderful friend and she wanted to be his friend too. She wanted to see the pranks that Peter and his friends pulled. She wanted to join in on their hatred of the house Slytherin. </p><p>She and Peter played strange versions of car games. Starting with I Spy, morphing it to what’s not there, then playing the silent game and bursting into childish giggles after mere moments.</p><p>When they finally came upon the Potter Manor, Peter jumped from his seat to dash to his friend who waited for him on the doorstep. Azaria hung back, watching the interaction with anxious anticipation. Her parents grabbed their small suitcases and started up a concrete path that Azaria had only just noticed. The front door opened and two kind looking older faces popped out. This gave her the push she needed to walk up the path too. </p><p>“Hello dear,” said the woman. James’ mother. “I’m Euphemia, but you are welcome to call me Effie.”</p><p>Azaria smiled at her and waved from her spot, unsure of herself. </p><p>The man next to Effie looked down at her, grinning. “I’m Fleamont, but I would love it if you’d call me Monty. Welcome to the Potter Manor young lady. If I may ask your name?” </p><p>Azaria opened her mouth and struggled at first to speak. People she’s never met before are a little intimidating. “Uh, I’m Azaria, Peter’s sister.” </p><p>Effie came forward to hug Azaria. “Oh, what a lovely name. Well, shall we settle you both in for your stay?” </p><p>Peter and James came up to the door then. Their dad gave Peter his bag, and their mom gave Azaria hers. </p><p>“How much should we leave them with for their shopping?” asked their father. </p><p>Monty tapped his chin with a wrinkled knuckle. “I think about two hundred each of your currency should do, and if there are any extra fees atop that we don’t mind covering it in the slightest.” </p><p>Their mother, having brought more than enough cash, handed what they needed to Monty for safekeeping. “thank you both for taking them, I feel bad that we aren’t wizards ourselves, so we can’t be much use in your world. </p><p>“Quite alright you two, James wanted to do it the moment we received your letter, and as our only child I have no objections to letting him have friends here,” Effie says smiling again. </p><p>Azaria was still rather unsure. Effie had said friends, but she had never met James, only heard about him in letters and over the summer. </p><p>“Would you both like to stay for a while for some tea?” Monty asked after a beat. </p><p>Her mother shook her head. “Unfortunately, we have to go to work soon. Our bosses gave us the morning off for this but we must be in our chairs by noon and it’s already ten.” </p><p>Monty and Effie nodded in understanding, ushering the children inside and for James to show Azaria and Peter where they’d be sleeping. </p><p>“Have a safe trip,” they said together, waving. </p><p>Azaria's mother gave one mildly worried look towards the elegant home before nodding to her Husband, and they waved and walked back to their car, driving away. </p><p>Once inside, Azaria got a good look around. The Potter's home was much bigger than her own. The ceilings higher, and there were so many rooms on the first floor alone. The hallway itself to the front door was more of a foyer than a hallway, and everything was immaculately clean. The walls were a pale creamy colour, and the floors a shining dark hardwood. She took her shoes off at a shoe rack with nothing out of place and was about to look for a spot she could leave her coat when she heard a pop. </p><p>Suddenly a short creature with tawny, wrinkled skin and massive ears and huge green eyes was in front of her. “Bobbi can take Miss' coat if she likes.” </p><p>Azaria stood frozen with her coat half shrugged off. Mouth open, eyes bulging. She had no idea how to respond to the house-elf in front of her. Peter was off somewhere with James already, so she didn’t have her brother to look to for help. </p><p>“Hello, Bobbi!” Effie's kind voice sounded nearby, “Azaria is new to the wizarding world. Sweetie, this is the family house-elf, Bobbi, she’s really nice and is here to help us.” </p><p>Bobbi took a deep bow, almost with her nose to the floor. Azaria looked the house-elf over, now over her shock. The small thing was wearing a smock that looked like it was made of a pretty patterned tea towel. </p><p>Azaria shakes her head and shrugs her coat the rest of the way off. “Thanks, Bobbi, I’d appreciate if you’d show me where to put it?” </p><p>The house-elf nods eagerly and takes the coat and goes to a closet door off to the side. “It’ll be right here for you miss Azaria.” </p><p>“Thank you,” Azaria says, and looks up at Effie and Monty, unsure of what to do or where to go next. </p><p>Monty rests a hand on her shoulder and points with the other. “James' room is up the stairs and the second door on the left. I bet the boys went there.”</p><p>Azaria smiled in thanks and walked as quietly as she could up the flight of stairs ahead of her, staring at an ornate chandelier and <em>moving paintings. </em>She had to stop midstep for a few minutes and stare at a painting of someone who looked similar to Monty. The painting waved at her and she nearly stumbled on the spot but she decided to stare at it and creep up the rest of the stairs backwards. </p><p>Out of sight of the painting, she knocked on James' door which opened with a grinning James on the other side. “Hi, Azaria!” </p><p>“Uh hi.” The painting made her anxious. Not that she hadn’t heard of the various kinds of magic present in this world, she had, but being face to face with it was something else. </p><p>“Come in, I was just about to show Peter some stuff.” </p><p>Azaria comes into the room and as soon as her eyes had found her brother, she was sitting next to him. She leaned into him for comfort and stared over at James. </p><p>“So, since you guys are muggle-born, you can’t do magic at home, and there’s no magic to observe either. Which sucks for you guys because that leaves you out of touch over the Summer, and a rather late introduction to magic for you Azaria.” </p><p>“Yeah, I mean the painting and your elf really spooked me. Peter told me about these things but…” Peter tucked her under his arm. </p><p>James laughed, “I wasn’t sure how you’d take those. Good to know. So Peter. Remember at school how much I liked flying?”</p><p>Peter nodded enthusiastically. “Yeah, James you’re so good at it! I bet you’ll make the team this year, and Sirius too!”</p><p>“That’s the plan, Peter. Anyways, I talked my parents into buying me…” James puts his hand over an open chest, palm down and hand open, “Up.”</p><p>“This!” he says with glee as a sleek, shiny broom that looked to Azaria like it would be useless for sweeping.</p><p>She blinked at it a few times, blinked at her brother, then blinked at James. “huh?”</p><p>“This is what we wizards use to fly! Didn’t Peter tell you anything about the flying lessons at Hogwarts?” James grins brightly at the thing.</p><p>“Of course, he mentioned flying! But Peter didn’t say with brooms, he just said that he sucked at it and that he never wants to do more than hover anymore.” James barked with laughter as Peter’s visible flesh went red with embarrassment. </p><p>James put his broom away, and then went through a bunch of his magical toys and explained a few more things that Azaria would see throughout the house, so she wouldn’t get as nervous around them. Especially the portraits. </p><p>James told her about the ones at Hogwarts and how they could be incredibly helpful with directions when she may need them, and about the passworded door-portraits into each of the house common rooms. </p><p>As the sun began to set, the trio came to realize that they had missed lunch and trampled each other down the stairs to see if anything was available for dinner. Though James had explained to Azaria that even if there wasn’t, their house-elf was fast and made amazing food. </p><p>James’ foot barely touched the bottom of the staircase –first of course— before Bobbi popped right in front of them. </p><p>“Bobbi was just about to fetch you all, young master Potter! Bobbi has made dinner extra filling since yous three missed your lunches. Master and Missus await you in the dining room.” With that, Bobbi popped away once again. Though it still frightened Azaria, her reaction wasn’t nearly as physical as the first time. </p><p>On the table was a beautiful chicken, roasted to perfection, peas, carrots, mashed potatoes, Yorkshire puddings, it was practically a thanksgiving feast! Azaria’s eyes grew wide at all of this. She and Peter see this much food, this type of food on holidays only. </p><p>“Today isn’t a holiday I’ve forgotten is it?” she asked quietly, shaking where she stood.</p><p>Peter grabbed her hand, hoping to calm her nerves just a little bit.</p><p>Effie smiles warmly at her, “no dear, as a well-respected long line of wizards, we eat rather lavishly. Would you like a little history lesson on our families?”</p><p>The children settle into the three open seats with a plate in front of them, as Azaria thinks about her answer. </p><p>“I’m sorry Mrs Potter, but I think that I’ve had a bit of an intro-to-magic information overload today. Hopefully, I’ll get over it and be able to focus on school you know? But I’m worried.”</p><p>Everyone loads up their plates, Azaria with more chicken than veggies and a hefty helping of delicious-looking gravy. </p><p>“You always worry Zar,” peter says through a mouthful. “Assuming you’ll be in our house, I’ll make sure you’re okay. And Remus is really smart so you can study with him to make sure that isn’t overwhelming too.”</p><p>This made Azaria’s heart rate pick up and she stares at the adults in the room with tears on the edges of her eyes. “What if I’m not in Gryffindor? What are the other houses like? Peter, will you hate me if I’m not in Gryffindor?”</p><p>“Well, none of the houses are outright bad. Slytherin has a terrible reputation, but Effie’s family is a long line of Slytherins until Sirius got sorted last year. My family has always been an awful lot of Gryffindors.” Monty speaks up first, a reminiscent look taking over his eyes.</p><p>“That’s right dear, and my brother, the head of the house of Black married a Hufflepuff.”</p><p>Azaria swallows her bite before speaking again, “so why do the boys hate the Slytherins so much?”</p><p>James starts speaking loudly before his mother gives him a withering look. “James Potter, not at the dinner table. The boys will probably tell you sooner than I’d like, but honestly dear make that decision for yourself when it comes time.”</p><p>Her stomach had started to ache, but with Effie’s words it settled quickly, and Azaria finished dinner with little more anxieties. </p><p>“Alright you three,” Monty says, as James finishes the last bite of a pumpkin pasty. “Time for bed. You don’t have to wake up early, but once everyone is up and ready we will head into Diagon alley to get the school shopping done. Bobbi!”</p><p>Bobbi pops into the room and bows lowly at her master. “What does Master Potter wish for sir? Bobbi is happy to help.”</p><p>“Could you show Azaria to the room we had you set up Bobbi?”</p><p>“Bobbi would love to sir! Follow Bobbi Miss Azaria.” Bobbi held out a bony hand and Azaria cautiously took it. </p><p>Remembering her reaction from earlier, Bobbi simply walked them upstairs rather than apparating so she doesn’t scare her anymore.</p><p>They come to a stop outside a door two down and across from James’ room. “Sleep well, Ms Azaria.”</p><p>She sighs and opens the door. Inside, the bedroom is a pale-yellow colour with immaculate furniture and an overhead lamp that looked like it’s dusted on the daily. </p><p>The covers on the bed are a slightly darker yellow than the walls, and as she gets under them after getting into her pyjamas, she realizes that leaving the bed in the morning will be a difficult task due to comfort. </p><p>She falls asleep almost instantaneously.</p>
