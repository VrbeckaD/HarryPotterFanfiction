    <p>                Ella was happy to be back at Hogwarts for her 7<sup>th</sup> year after the long summer holiday. She was also happy to be in her Hufflepuff common room next to the fire. It was a chilly fall night and she the warmth felt good. Every time she came back she thought about the first time she had come to Hogwarts. She had no friends, her father had just passed, and her new step-family treated her as a servant. They came from the pure blood Tremaine family , and since Ella’s mother was a muggle, they looked down on her. After her father died, they had no more reason to be cordial to her. When she received her letter to Hogwarts, she was scared that Lady Tremaine wouldn’t let her go, but her step-mother loved the idea of not being alone with her in the house too much to let her stay.</p>
<p>                She was elated and nervous when she saw the Hogwarts Express pulled in to King’s Cross. When they boarded the train her stepsisters abandoned her immediately to sit with friends they had already known because of their mother’s connections. Of course they were all from pure blood families and were quick to giggle and pass judging looks to Ella. They pointed at her torn robes because her mother would not by her new one’s like she had for Drizella and Anastasia. Ella moved passed them and found an empty train car and once the door shut she let the tears fall.</p>
<p>                She was still crying when the door opened and a young boy with dark hair and bright sapphire eyes asked, “Can I sit with you? There is no more room on the train.”</p>
<p>                “Sure,” Ella said as she quickly wiped her eyes and added, “No one else was planning to sit here.”</p>
<p>                “My name is Kit,” the boy gave a radiant smile as he held out his hand to Ella. She forgot her name for a moment as she stared at the hand.</p>
<p>                “My name is Ella,” she finally replied.</p>
<p>                “Can I ask why your crying?” Kit asked and the concerning growing in his eyes.</p>
<p>                “It’s nothing, just a lot of things I guess” Ella answered softly as she turned her head toward the window. The train had started moving and she looked at the city of London quickly passing by.</p>
<p>                “Well, we have a lot of time from what my father told me, so you can share if you want.”</p>
<p>                Ella looked at the boy and felt a sudden comfort. Before she knew it she began telling him her story. She told him about the loss of her parents, and how her step-family treated her. He listened intently and exuded empathy as she spoke. Every once in a while she got lost in the depth of his eyes. When she finished her story he took a moment before he said anything. He seemed to be trying to find the right words.</p>
<p>                “I’m sorry,” Kit said, eyes full of empathy, not the pity Ella was expecting. She could tell he wasn’t just sorry for her, but somehow he understood her pain.</p>
<p>                “It’s not your fault,” Ella replied.</p>
<p>                “Yours neither, I’ll bet,” he let a smile spread across his face, and she couldn’t help but smile back.</p>
<p>                “I lost my mum too,” he said as the smile fell from his face, and added, “about two years ago in a car crash. My dad and I have never been the same. I don’t know what I would do without him.” He looked pensive as he stared into space for a moment.</p>
<p>                “I’m sorry Kit,” Ella looked at him and put a supportive hand on his shoulder and hoped she was sharing the same empathy he shared with her. She wanted him to know he wasn’t alone, like he had done for her. He gave a small smile in thanks. They spent the rest of the train ride eating chocolate frogs that Kit bought and talking excitedly about their new home. Ella had not had this much interaction with another person in years, the farm animals had been only friends, and she craved the bonding and was ecstatic to have for the first time since she lost her parents.</p>
<p align="center">...</p>
<p>                Once the train reached Hogwarts they walked with the rest of the first years to the castle. Ella and Kit walked together silently. Ella loved her new found comfort in being with him. All the first-years marveled at the enormous structure that would now be their home. Ella and Kit were separated as they walked in to the Great Hall. As they moved through the room, they were all struck with awe. Ella’s nerves made her lightheaded as she looked at the eloquent hall with floating candles and the ceiling bewitched to look the night sky. The older students watched as they walked to the head table where they waited to be sorted by the sorting hat. Ella fidgeted and wrung her hands together as the first student was called to be sorted. She found Kit in the crowd and he smiled widely at her. She felt more lightheaded than before.</p>
<p>                A couple of students were sorted before Ella’s step-sister Anastasia was called and sorted. She went to Slytherin, as well as her other sister, Drusilla. Ella was not surprised, and her sisters seemed excited to be in the house of the purest blood that treasured their unwavering ambition. The two girls pranced to their house’s table and took their seats.</p>
<p>                A few more students were sorted with the help of Headmistress McGonagall. Ella walked timidly toward the sorting hat and felt a hand on her shoulder. She turned and Kit mouthed “good luck” to her. She smiled and kept her head up as she walked toward the sorting hat. Headmistress nodded in encouragement as Ella sat on the stool and looked out at all of her new schoolmates. Professor McGonagall on her.</p>
<p>                “Yes, you are an easy one to decide. There is a kindness in you.”</p>
<p>                Ella remembered something similar her mother always said to her. <em>Ella, there is more kindness in you then most have in their little finger. </em>Her eyes stung with grief for a moment.</p>
<p>                The sorting hat shouted, “Hufflepuff.”</p>
<p>                Cheers came from a table in the hall and Ella smiled as she walked to her new home. She looked at Kit who beamed back at her. She sat down and a couple of her new housemates hugged and congratulated her. Then she watched as Kit’s name was called next. She watched as he walked toward the stool. His confidence astounded Ella. The sorting hat didn’t take long to mull over where to send him. “Gryffindor,” the hat exclaimed. Ella’s heart sank a little as Kit walked to a different table and was greeted with warmth and enthusiasm. Ella wished she’d been with him, but she took a deep breath and became grateful for her new found place.</p>
