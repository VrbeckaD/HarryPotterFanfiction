  <u> <strong> <em> Divorced </em> </strong> </u>
</p><p>"WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE RETURNED HOME INSTEAD OF CHATTING WITH BLOODY MALFOY IN THE THREE BROOMSTICKS." Ginny shouts at him and he glares at her, his body trembling with fury. Who is she to dictate what he should do and what he shouldn't. She has no right.</p><p>Draco would never have dictated him like this. He is so tired of all this. Shouting is all they have been doing for past couple of years.</p><p>She shouts. He shouts back and then they go to sleep. In separate bedrooms. They have had no sex for the past seven years.</p><p>He wants to get back with Draco, his whining, biting, snappish, hot Draco. He is tired of Ginny and her voice. He is tired of remaining celibate. He is tired of everything.</p><p>Not to say that Ginny is not beautiful because she is. It's just that she doesn't attract him anymore and it's not just about attraction. He doesn't love her anymore. He hasn't been in love with her for a long time now.</p><p>This year, it's somehow worse because Lily is off to Hogwarts and they will be all alone in this place.</p><p>"I am done with you." The words that are hissed escape his mouth on their own accord, "I am divorcing you."</p><p>"Who are you to divorce me, Harry. I am bloody done with you, you unfaithful bastard. I am sure you have been fucking Malfoy. I am sure that she divorced Zabini because of you. Had you planned this all along?" She hisses back, her hands crossed and her eyes furious.</p><p>"If only." He grimaces because it would have been better. But he is not even on talking terms with Draco. Over the years, Draco has become closed off. She had married Zabini for an heir. </p><p>"What the fuck?" Ginny's yell catches his attention and he grimaces again, "Would you prefer to keep this house to yourself?"</p><p>She stares at him quietly so he continues, "I can ask Dobby to shift my things immediately to my manor in Chestwheel Elite."</p><p>"You are serious. You - you want a divorce- but - but what did I do- I have been trying-" Her tone changes and her eyes almost soften in relief. She is happy that he is divorcing her. If she is happy then why didn't she divorce him ages ago instead of stretching this sham of a marriage for so long.</p><p>"Please drop the act. I can see that you are relieved. This is not working, Ginny. I am sorry but it isn't and I am leaving. I will ask Dobby." He mutters after averting his eyes furiously.</p><p>"Okay." She whispers, her voice barely a whisper now. They have not been together for the last seven years, not in any way that matters. </p><p>He calls, "Dobby." and Dobby appears, "Yes. Master Harry Potter."</p><p>"Please pack my things and shift them to my manor at Chestwheel Elite." He says and Dobby nods before squeaking, "yes Master Harry Potter."</p><p>Harry closes his eyes and apparates directly inside his manor. He grimaces when he finds himself on the floor. He has never like apparition.</p><p>"Harry." Minister Kingsley's patronus mutters in a sharp voice and he grimaces again, "Harry please be there in my office in an hour." After the war, Harry had become the head auror, not because he wanted it but because it was expected of him. In fact, he had done everything just because it was expected, including marrying Ginny. She was beautiful and charming and he just went along with everything.</p><p>Draco had been devastated, not that her face had ever betrayed her emotions but Harry could always feel it. She had been there at the wedding. She was the most beautiful woman in his wedding. Ginny had been envious of her. She had worn a silver gown which had a plunging neckline and matching jewelery to go with it.</p><p>She had danced with him and he had wanted to marry Draco instead of Ginny but he hadn't. She had given many chances to him. Of course, she had not said it outrightly but she had looked into his eyes and her eyes had told him that they could just flee.</p><p>He had wanted to bake cakes and open a big and famous bakery and could have already established it by now and he could have had Draco as his wife but he didn't. The only reward he had gotten out of his marriage with Ginny were his kids who would hate him once they realize that he is divorcing their mother. Eventually, they would realize that he loves Draco because he will woo her and he will marry her, no matter who says otherwise.</p><p>He had never wanted to become an auror or a head auror and the first thing he will do is to resign. The second thing he will do is to visit Draco followed by designing pamphlets and taking orders. </p><p>Having decided his next course of action, he closes his eyes and apparates in front of the ministry of magic. Of course, he will have to contact his solicitor, Blaise Zabini who is going to laugh his head off at the news.</p><p>XXXX</p><p>Draco is in her sleeping shirt. It stretches up-to one-fourth of her thighs and is quiet comfortable. She is about to lay down on the bed when her elf, Blinky appears all of a sudden.</p><p>She whines, "What's it? I want to sleep."</p><p>The elf shakes her head in exasperation before muttering, "The great Mr. Harry Potter is at the door." The words, 'the great' are said sarcastically of course and Draco smirks.</p><p>"Mistress Draco, you should dress in something appropriate." Blinky mutters and Draco laughs, "Why, dear Blinky, this is quite appropriate, don't you think so and it's so comfortable."</p><p>"Mistress Draco. Mr. Harry Potter is being nervous because of something and-"</p><p>"Ah! Nervous Harry Potter. I must see him then. It's been years since I spoke to a nervous Harry Potter. Won't you be a darling and serve soft drinks for us?" She mutters and looks at her nails. Blinky nods and grumbles something before disappearing.</p><p>She kept to herself for the past sixteen years. She avoided Harry and expected Harry to do the same. But he just won't get the hint. She doesn't want to talk to him. She doesn't want to meet him or see him.</p><p>He had abandoned her as if she was just trash. One would think that she had forgotten his betrayal over the past sixteen years but a lifetime isn't enough to heal the wound that he left. No-one can see that wound except Blaise because she has become brilliant at hiding it.</p><p>When she sees Weasley hanging off Harry's arm at the galas and dinners, her heart burns but she doesn't let it come on her face. She meets everyone including Harry and his darling bitch of a wife and smiles when she is burning inside.</p><p>She gets up and looks at herself in the mirror. She is looking hot. She always does but no one gets to see her like this. Except for the one time, she had sex with Blaise to conceive Scorpius, she has been celibate for the past sixteen years and plans to continue her celibacy.</p><p>But she wants to torture Harry like he tortured her. She attended his bloody marriage to give him a last chance to escape. He didn't take it and married his Weaslette even though he clearly didn't love her. He chose his fame and the wizarding world's expectations over her and she loathes him for that.</p><p>The fire that he had lit inside her heart all those years ago by saying the words, 'I do' has not extinguished yet. She wants him to stay away but he has to be a bastard and engage her in fruitless conversations whenever their paths cross.</p><p>She unbuttons the last button of her shirt and the hem line of her panties is visible. It's enough to torture him. She knows. It will make him mad with desire as it did all those years ago.</p><p>She winks at her reflection and applies red lipstick before walking towards the sitting room.</p><p>XXXX</p>
