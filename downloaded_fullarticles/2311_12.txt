          <div class="userstuff"><p>When she came home, she didn’t expect to find Bellatrix watching a good old American horror flick. </p><p>“What the hell are you watching?”</p><p>“This supposed to be a scary film? It's so very unrealistic.”</p><p>Hermione laughed. “That’s not supposed to be very scary. It's practically a parody of most slasher-flicks.” </p><p>Bella humphed, and blew a stray curl away from her face.</p><p>“Well, I don't find it very amusing. It’s just bad.”</p><p>“I never said it was good.” She dropped the groceries on the counter. </p><p>“They are just movies you watched when you went on a date. Easy to miss so it was easier to kiss. There are like, good horror movies. I personally like It and some of the Chucky ones. A Quiet Place isn’t really horror, but that’s not too bad either.”</p><p>“Well. if these are the so-called ‘good’ ones, I want to watch them with you.”</p><p>`` a week later</p><p>“It's a fucking clown! It’s not that scary!”</p><p>“They are kids, Bella, and I think he is pretty scary looking.”</p><p>She made a little noise. </p><p>“I’ve seen worse. Horror movies are all bad and unrealistic.”</p><p>“Thank you for enlightening me, Bella.”</p><p>“You are welcome, pet.”</p><p>``</p><p>“How? Bella, you are telling me, you find Pennywise childish, but you are scared of the Muppets.”</p><p>“It is unnatural!”</p><p>“It's a bloody puppet, you idiot! A felt puppet frog.”</p><p>“No, it's the pig that scares me!”</p><p>Hermione laughed and laughed, despite Bella’s glare. </p><p>“I don’t find it very funny.”</p><p>Hermione just giggled some more. </p><p>“Bella, you amuse me so.”</p><p>Bellatrix just pouted, which Hermione thought was adorable.</p></div>
