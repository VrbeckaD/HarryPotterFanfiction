    <i>Searching for: Stable wizarding housemate. Will have private room, bath, and full access to common areas. Can negotiate a discount on rent if you have experience training generational wizarding home. Home comes with house-elf. Please respond to owl box: 2837</i>
  </p>
</center>Harry stared dismally at the missives covering Ron’s coffee table and accepted the beer Ron offered.  “<i>Help</i> me with this,” he said plaintively.<p>“You think I want in on that mess?” Ron asked, sitting down next to him and gesturing to the mail with his own bottle before taking a drink.</p><p>“I think you’ll get in on this mess because you’ll be seeing whoever moves in all the time,” Harry said grimly, picking up a small pile and shoving it at him. “I didn’t realise this many people needed a housemate.”</p><p>“Hermione!” Ron called out suddenly. Harry jumped, then took a swig of his beer to settle down, surprisingly edgy about this whole debacle.  “Come in here and do the hard work for us!”</p><p>“No, do it yourself!” she yelled back from the kitchen over the sound of Ginny’s laughter.</p><p>“Wish Ginny would just move in,” Harry muttered. He sifted through the disorganized mess in front of him and picked one up at random. </p><p>“Grimmauld has too many nargles for Luna.” Ron’s knee nudged his, and Harry looked up to see him discard an opened reply. “Anyway, you and Gin drive each other crazy when you’re in close quarters for too long,” he added with a shudder.</p><p>Grimacing, Harry acknowledged the point. He and Ginny might still have tried to give things a go — despite everything else — if there was any way to live with someone without being reminded of their constant presence. Their temporary cohabitation a year after the war had <i>not</i> gone well, even after they’d decided to just be friends. <i>You’re too similar</i> Hermione’s voice reminded him in his head.  <i>You need a Ron. Someone who complements you.</i></p><p>“But you guys grew up in a Wizarding House,” Harry said. It was a pointless argument and they both knew it. “Kreacher says Grimmauld needs someone who did.”</p><p>“Someone who cares about that crap. Mum and Dad built the Burrow from scratch; all the magic that's in it is a result of spells, anyway; you need generations to start the kind of shit that goes on at your place. Sell it,” Ron advised flatly, eyes skimming another piece of mail. “It’s awful and you kn– Hey, this one sounds pretty good.” He handed it over.  </p><p>“They have <i>five cats?</i>.” Harry tossed it aside. “Can you imagine what the House would do to <i>one</i> pet that got on its nerves?”</p><p>Sounding marginally more sympathetic, Ron leaned back against the sofa and unfolded more mail. “It’s not getting better?”</p><p>“It’s getting worse,” Harry said. “It locked me out of all the bathrooms last night. <i>In the middle of the night</i>, Ron” Harry said pointedly when Ron sniggered. “I had to piss in the garden. Paul kept staring, then complimented my dick. Then he threw a rock at me.” </p><p>Ron laughed harder and Harry elbowed him, trying not to smile. Though he wasn’t exactly sure how he felt about rooming with a married couple, he placed the response in the ‘possible’ pile — which consisted of only one other reply — and picked up a new one. </p><p>“You could always find a flat.” Ron’s laughter died abruptly at his own suggestion, voice turning somber.  Harry looked at him, surprised. “I’m serious, Harry. You could come stay with me and Hermione while you look for your own place. Grimmauld...” He hesitated. “It’s not a happy place to be.”</p><p>“I know,” Harry said with a sigh. He rubbed a hand over his face. It wasn’t as if he’d never thought about it, especially since the only thing he’d managed to do to cheer up the place was get rid of that damned portrait of Walburga on the wall. “But– Sirius–”</p><p>“I know.” Ron pressed Harry’s knee again, sympathetic. “But you can’t spend your life trying to fix up a tomb to honour Sirius. Even <i>he</i> didn’t like it there.”</p><p>“No, but it meant something to him, or he wouldn’t have left it to me,” Harry said tiredly. He didn’t like saying it — it felt childish and petty — but, unlike Ron, he had so… so <i>little</i> to remember his family by. And Sirius, for as short a time as Harry had known him, had given him something. He couldn’t ignore it. </p><p>He looked down at a semi-decent response (could it be so bad to give up an extra room for a butterbeer home-brewery?) and set it in the <i>possible</i> pile that seemed determined not to grow.  Ron remained silent, countenance worried. Harry shook his head. “If this doesn’t work, I’ll consider options, yeah? But in the meantime, stop stalling.”</p><p>Ron relaxed a bit; he rolled his eyes and grunted, opening up another letter.  He snorted. “I like how half of these ask if they can take over the whole House for their hobbies. How’d you feel about making room for a BDSM dungeon?”</p><p>“Already have one,” Harry said absently, then grinned. “Do they mention if they’re single?”</p><p>Ron groaned. “Better not joke with <i>them</i> about that. Merlin knows what kind of housemate you'll attract when people find out they’re going to be <i>yours.</i>”</p><p>“Speaking of which, remind me to call Kingsley and get permission to use Memory Charms if any of the interviews go badly,” Harry said thoughtfully. He made a face and crumpled up a reply; no, he did <i>not</i> want to consider their creepy request about Kreacher’s services, thankyouverymuch. “I don’t think I’ll need to — if I ever make it to the interview stage, people have got to be better than this lot — but it can’t hurt to have them, right?”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~~~~</p>
</center>People were not, in fact, better at the interview stage.<p>Out of the dozen people Harry had interviewed, he’d had to Obliviate five who’d seemed <i>just</i> normal enough to make it past the initial meeting to be invited to take a look around Grimmauld Place. Most of them had figured out his identity immediately upon learning the address — despite the heavily crafted glamours he wore — which had been problematic enough; two of them had followed his movements with such avidly bright gazes that he’d known he’d never feel comfortable showering if they lived there; one person had tried to nick a framed picture of him, Hermione, and Ron; another had yelled at Kreacher and told Harry with a lofty smile that that was “what house-elves liked.”  And even those had been better than the last horrifying incident, when a witch of about forty — who had seemed <i>almost</i> normal, but for a vague, musty odour of mothballs, with the foreboding astringent tone of ammonia underneath — had confessed that she had been raised muggle, but would be willing to work off a break in the rent by other means. She’d then begun calmly removing her robes as if the matter had been settled. In retrospect, Harry felt a little bad about having panic-Stunned her, but gave a mental shrug; at least she wouldn’t remember it.</p><p>And these had been the candidates he’d been <i>hopeful</i> about. </p><p>He sighed, scrubbing a hand over his tired face; he only had two other possibles before going back to the drawing board. He stirred his tea idly and looked down at the response in his hand; the perfect, scrawling cursive fascinated him a little, but the content was less than completely forthcoming. </p><p>
  <i>I am very interested in the room and was born and raised in a generational wizarding home. I believe we can come to terms to help one another. Please respond to Owl Box 144 to set up an appointment, and I shall make myself available.</i>
</p><p>Harry didn’t quite know if it was a good or bad thing that the applicant hadn’t included their name or age or a request to have a floating waterbed in his sitting room.  It was just... void of context, which probably would have worried him more if not for Margaret the Aspiring Prostitute and the rest.</p><p>Antsy for this all to be over with, Harry went to check the time again and heard the tinkling sound of the charm over Fortescue’s door as someone entered. He looked up, mind going blank as Draco Malfoy came in. He looked... different than he had the last time Harry had seen him, just after the trials. Though still tall and skinny, he somehow now resembled the Malfoy Harry remembered before the war — healthy, skin having lost that yellowish pallor of someone who’d been in a containment cell for a month. And there was something else too, Harry thought, studying him, maybe an ease in his own skin; something Harry couldn't put his finger on. He’d cut his hair and wore it swept to the side and tousled now, Harry noted with some surprise.</p><p>It was a good look on him.</p><p>Hurriedly closing his mouth before he was caught gaping, Harry took a sip of tea for something to do. Malfoy’s unsettling grey eyes landed on him and he seemed to hesitate before striding over and taking a seat across from Harry at the small table he’d procured. Harry jerked, body going rigid and eyes rounding as he realised that Malfoy was here to see <i>him.</i></p><p>After a too-long beat, he recovered and decided to brazen it out. “Hi, I’m–”</p><p>“Potter,” Malfoy said flatly.</p><p>“Shhhh!” Harry hissed, looking around. Reassured no one seemed to have overheard, he leaned back in his chair and examined Malfoy closely. “How’d you know it was me?”</p><p>Malfoy shrugged, adopting Harry’s posture. He picked up the menu with one hand and scanned it absently before setting it back down and taking a breath. “The picture in your advert,” he finally said.</p><p>“I didn’t put a picture of myself in the advert,” Harry said, confused. </p><p>“No, you put one of the sitting room at Grimmauld Place,” Malfoy said with a twitch of his lips. “Which had more than one of my relatives on the walls. The fact that your Glamour is shoddily done is just a bonus. You could have at least adjusted the style of your spectacles.”</p><p>Stumped for a response, Harry stared at him for a moment. “Oh. Then you’re really– him? The… applicant?”</p><p>Malfoy blinked at him slowly. “You can’t imagine you’ll get someone who is better equipped to train a Black family estate home.” He paused, that sly curl twitching his mouth again. Harry forced himself to look away. “Although I’ll admit to being surprised that <i>you</i> need help with anything.”</p><p>Harry flushed. “I have dozens and dozens of applicants, Malfoy,” he lied. “What makes you think I’d ever pick <i>you</i>?” He took another sip of his tea, eyeing Malfoy over the rim of his cup. Malfoy looked distressingly unbothered. </p><p>“Because whatever problem you’re having, I can help fix — and you know it,” he said, arching one brow. He looked down and picked off an invisible piece of lint from his pristine turquoise robes. “It should be fine. You testified for me; you obviously don’t hate me any longer.”</p><p>“Is that what you got from that?” Harry asked. Malfoy’s eyes darted up to his, flickering inscrutably before swerving away. Harry sighed. “Why would you even <i>want</i> to live with me?” he asked plaintively.</p><p>At that, Malfoy straightened a touch, narrow shoulders squaring. “I think it’d be obvious, P–”</p><p>“Mark,” Harry supplied quietly. Malfoy snorted.</p><p>“<i>Mark</i>.” Rolling his eyes, he leaned forward. “You must have some concept of what it’s like for someone with… someone who…” He cleared his throat. “For me. The last three years haven’t exactly been a game of pick-up Quidditch, socially speaking. But once it gets out that I’m housing with the Saviour of the Wizarding world…” He trailed off suggestively.</p><p>Harry smirked. “That’s it, then? You want to live with me because it’ll make you <i>look good?</i>” He shook his head, an absurd bubble of laughter caught in his throat. “You don’t have friends anymore, so you want to trade on the reputation of being one of mine? Once a Slytherin, always one, right Malfoy?”</p><p>Malfoy looked annoyed. “You say that as if it’s a bad thing.” He sniffed. “And I <i>have friends</i>. Unfortunately, most of them are as unwelcome in many exclusive establishments as I am. We all–”</p><p>“Tried to kill me and/or trade me over to be killed?” Harry supplied, voice mild. He raised his eyebrows. Malfoy fell silent and a flush climbed above the high collar of his robes, in stark contrast to his creamy skin. Harry watched it with a sense of gleeful satisfaction; he’d not often gotten to see Malfoy so off-kilter he was without words. </p><p>“<i>Made mistakes,</i> I was going to say,” he muttered after a moment. He looked equal parts furious and embarrassed, and Harry decided to ease off a little — he didn’t <i>actually</i> want to provoke Malfoy into stalking away. At least not yet.</p><p>“How would people even know?” Harry asked. “That you were living with me, I mean. I tend to keep to myself, you know. I’ve got wards around Grimmauld that keep away reporters and photographers. And I certainly don’t give interviews, so how would people even find out?”</p><p>Malfoy paused, then grinned — wide and smug and surprising. “I would make sure they did,” he said simply.</p><p>“Hm,” Harry muttered noncommittally. He stirred his tea a few more times — it was getting cold — and felt Malfoy’s gaze on him, practically willing him to say yes. He hummed for another second and tapped his chin with his forefinger, just to be annoying, then finally looked back up. Malfoy’s lower lip was swollen and slightly pink, as though he’d just released it from between his teeth. Harry shrugged. “Do you want to see the House?”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~~~~</p>
</center>“Well, I’m certainly not paying you to live here,” Malfoy said disdainfully after the tour as Kreacher brought them a fruit-and-cheese tray. He chose a fat grape from the offerings and popped it in his mouth, looking bored. “Thank you, Kreacher.” Kreacher bowed low, dignified but apparently too overcome to speak.<p>“You’re not interested, then?” Harry clarified after a pause. His heart sped up for no reason he could discern.</p><p>“I didn’t say that. My reasoning still applies,” Malfoy said slowly. “But, really, Potter, <i>you</i> should offer to pay <i>me</i>.  Do you have any idea the amount of work that will go into organising the House? It’s gone to such seed over the last– what, two decades?”</p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>“Yes, well.” Malfoy lifted his shoulders, negligently debonaire. He leaned against Harry’s sofa as if he owned it, and Harry tried not to grind his own teeth into dust. “What’s your main problem with it, anyway? It won’t adapt to wizarding space additions or allow for updates to the plumbing?” He looked around, the edge of a sneer caught on his face. “Won’t allow you to redecorate?”</p><p>“It, uh–” Harry frowned. “It locks me out of things. And, um, trips me sometimes.”</p><p>Uncrossing his legs, Malfoy blinked at him and sat back up. “But you’re its Master.”</p><p>“Apparently, it doesn’t think so,” Harry muttered, aggravated. </p><p>“It doesn’t <i>have</i> to, Potter, that’s the way things <i>go</i>. If Kreacher obeys you, the House he’s bound to must know it belongs to you, from the eaves to the foundation,” Malfoy said, still shocked. </p><p>“Right.” Harry relaxed a little. “Kreacher said it couldn’t really… <i>hurt</i> me, but that certain circumstances might dictate that it could express its displeasure with me in other ways. Only something about house-elf magic dictates that he’s not allowed to explain it to me.”</p><p>“The House is seeking attentions,” Kreacher said mysteriously.  Harry and Draco ignored him when he didn’t go on.</p><p>“What ways?” Malfoy asked suspiciously. </p><p>Harry picked up a cracker to stall; he smeared it with a touch of seasoned cheese and ate it, chewing slowly. By the time he’d swallowed, Malfoy’s narrow look had faded into one of amusement. That was somehow worse.</p><p>“It, it–” Harry blew out a hard breath. “It locks me out of the bathrooms. The bannister shoots splinters sometimes when my hand is on it. The cupboards rearrange themselves so I can’t find anything, the floor tilts randomly and knocks me off centre, and I basically have to bother Kreacher any time I want something to eat, even if I’ve just bought groceries — they just vanish to who-knows-where. Only Kreacher is able to access them.”</p><p>“You haven’t taken control as Master yet,” Malfoy said thoughtfully. “Have you?”</p><p>Bewildered, Harry shook his head. “My name is on the deed, I have the keys, and Kreacher sees me as the heir to the property. What else am I supposed to do?”</p><p>Malfoy snorted. “Many things, Potter. You are... incredibly fortunate I’m even willing to live in this tomb for a year, let alone possibly longer.”</p><p>“A year?” Harry asked blankly. “Longer?”</p><p>“Well, I’m certainly not going to have you toss me out when you’ve gotten what you want from me, am I?” Malfoy said smoothly. “So a month-to-month lease won’t do. A year should do, although I have plans to move again before then, so I’ll need the option to break the lease as soon as I’ve the need. <i>Conditional</i>, of course,” he added, anticipating Harry’s objection, “on having fulfilled my part of the agreement, as well.”</p><p>Stuck on the phrase <i>what you want from me</i>, it took Harry a moment to respond. “Fine, I guess. A year. Longer. Whatever. If you help me with Grimmauld.”</p><p>Malfoy’s eyes gleamed at him, and he nodded. “For room and board,” he said. “I’m not spending a knut on this place.”</p><p>“Hey, it seemed to like you just fine,” Harry said, only slightly put-out. The House had seemed to– to open up when Malfoy had stepped in with him, the rooms brightening infinitesimally. Even all of the bathrooms had remained unlocked so Harry could show them to him.</p><p>“It recognises the blood association.” Malfoy carded a hand through his hair; he sounded vaguely disconcerted by the prospect. Kreacher frowned; he opened his mouth, then promptly shut it. Harry started to ask why but was interrupted when Malfoy said, “So then we’re agreed? I can’t imagine you need the gold anyway — why is that even a part of the bargain?”</p><p>Still frowning, Kreacher Disapparated.</p><p>“Hermione’s idea,” Harry explained with a sigh. “To make sure that the applicants would be–” he grimaced, “–contributing members of society or something. She explained it better. But you’re right, I don’t care.”</p><p>“I have a pet,” Malfoy said abruptly. </p><p>Harry looked at him, startled. “I threw away a lot of applications from people with pets,” he said carefully. “I didn’t know what the House would do to it, if it got annoyed. I’m not sure if it would be smart. Is there anyone who can take care of it for you?”</p><p>“It’s <i>mine,</i>” Malfoy said, frowning. “I’ll take care of it. This is non-negotiable, Potter.”</p><p>Flustered at Malfoy’s fervent declaration toward his pet — he seemed so earnest; something Harry hadn’t been aware Malfoy <i>could</i> be — Harry narrowed his eyes. “Apparently you need me just as much as I need you,” he said. “Nothing isn’t up for negotiation. What is it, an owl?”</p><p>Malfoy pursed his lips. “Your House ‘likes me just fine’, you just said it. And it’s a magical tortoise, very well behaved. The House won't mind,” he added confidently.</p><p>“I’ve never heard of a magical turtle,” Harry said, thrown. “What does it do?”</p><p>“Nevermind. Yes or no?” Malfoy inched closer to the edge of the couch, as though ready to get up and walk out.</p><p>“Yes,” Harry sighed. He scraped his hair back from his face and adjusted his glasses, pinning Malfoy with a look. “But if something happens to it–”</p><p>“I’ll take responsibility.” Looking pleased, Malfoy spent a moment hovering over the snack tray, selecting things to put on his plate. He spread several crackers with the same cheese Harry had chosen, and added bits of melon and a few extra grapes. He already seemed completely at home, and Harry had to repress another sigh when Malfoy looked up and smirked. “About those negotiations…” He bit into a cracker, dusting off a stray crumb that fell onto his chest.</p><p>Immediately on guard, Harry sat back and folded his arms over his chest. “Free room and board,” he said, pointedly looking at Malfoy’s full plate, “And a pet, and a better reputation. What else could you possibly want me for?”</p><p>Malfoy coughed slightly; he thumped his chest with his fist to clear whatever had gone down the wrong way, his cheeks going bright pink as he reached for a glass of water and took a long gulp. Sucking in a deep breath when he was finished, he met Harry’s eyes again. He gestured to the French doors off the sitting room. “You have a garden.”</p><p>Harry nodded, brows knitting.</p><p>“And you have plenty of space,” Malfoy continued, looking — finally — strangely hesitant to go on.</p><p>“I do,” Harry agreed cautiously. </p><p>“I’ll need another room for potions,” Malfoy said. His jaw was tight, and he stared down at his plate, fingers stroking the porcelain rim of it. “And as you obviously have no use for them, I’d like to harvest some of the ingredients from the garden, and to be able to bring in my own.”</p><p>Harry chuckled, surprising them both. Malfoy looked offended, and Harry shook his head. “No, it’s just — you were literally the only applicant who <i>hadn’t</i> asked for extra space of their own…” Laughter fading, Harry grinned. “I was a little disappointed in you.”</p><p>“Might as well see what I can get out of you,” Malfoy said lightly, face relaxing. He tipped Harry a glance that felt almost — mischievous, and Harry blinked at him for a second. “Slytherin, after all.”</p><p>“Right.” Harry looked out to the garden thoughtfully. “You can’t hurt anything out there.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t,” Malfoy said quickly. He swallowed tensely.</p><p>“Then I don’t really care,” Harry admitted. “And you can take any of the bedrooms other than mine for potions… Or the basement, even, there’s good space down there.”</p><p>Nodding, Malfoy reached up and brushed back a stray lock of hair with his pinky. He seemed relieved for some reason. Harry wanted to ask why, but didn’t; things were going well, and he didn’t want to risk altering their comfortable level of antagonism into something darker.</p><p>“Thank you,” Malfoy said, strangely subdued. He ate another cracker almost listlessly, then cleared his throat. “About visitors...”</p><p>Harry made a face. “No parties or anything without me agreeing first.” He thought about it for a moment. “Or being really loud, really late.”</p><p>“What constitutes a party? A few friends coming over?” Malfoy asked. “And the ‘being loud, late;’ does that <i>only</i> pertain to parties?”</p><p>“What else could it — oh.” Harry flushed; one side of Malfoy’s mouth lifted. Suddenly uncomfortable for no reason he wanted to examine, Harry gave a nod that apparently didn’t look much like one — Malfoy stared at him, confused. Harry forced his head to bob. “Yeah, that’s, er, fine. Silencing charms up, though, if you’re, um, loud. And — if they’re strangers, you have to be… careful. I don’t want people coming over just to gawk at me,” Harry said quietly. “A few friends coming over should be fine.”</p><p>“Fair enough,” Malfoy said. He tilted his head to the side, looking closely at Harry. Harry shifted again, wondering what was so bloody fascinating; he ran his tongue over the front of his teeth to see if he could feel any stray food caught in them. “Anything you’d like from me?”</p><p>Harry swallowed. “I can’t think of anything offhand, no,” he said. “I mean... No Dark magic,” he said, wondering exactly how ‘over it,’ he was if he felt the need to say so. Malfoy snorted, waving a hand as though to say, <i>obviously</i>. “And no talking about me. Even when people find out we’re housing together, I expect you to be discreet about my personal life. If I see something in the papers about myself, I’ll know you put it there,” Harry added seriously. “And I’ll put something in the rental contract that says as much. A– a–”</p><p>“A binding non-disclosure agreement,” Malfoy supplied smoothly. “That’s better than fine; perfect, actually; I’ll admit I’d prefer conjecture over fact, considering. Although I wonder what you could possibly have been getting up to around here that’s interesting enough to merit a discussion with the press,” he said, glancing around again. </p><p>“And progress,” Harry added firmly. “On the House. If it doesn’t start responding better to me, you’re either out or you start paying rent; I don’t care if I don’t need your gold.”</p><p>“Wonderfully petty of you,” Malfoy said, arching an eyebrow in an admiring sort of a way. </p><p>Harry shrugged. “Take it or leave it.”</p><p>“I’ll take it,” Malfoy said instantly. Harry looked at him, startled at the speed with which it had all been accomplished. </p><p>They sat in silence for a few minutes, eating and darting wary glances at each other. When Malfoy’s plate was empty, Harry set his own aside and ran his hands along the tops of his thighs to steady himself. He took a deep breath, determined to alleviate some of the tension; they’d be living together, after all. “So, uh, where have you been staying? I heard the Manor–” He broke off. </p><p>Malfoy’s face shuttered. “Was taken for reparations, yes,” he said after a pause. Not the best topic to have settled on then, Harry decided with a mental wince. Then Malfoy rotated his neck from side to side, his narrow chest expanding against his robes; his face cleared a little. “We have properties in France and Italy, of course — one in Japan — but I chose to stay here. Pansy and I– I’ve been staying with her,” he said stiffly. “And just so you’re aware, she <i>is</i> one of the friends I mentioned who <i>will</i> be visiting, so if you have any problems with that you should say so now.”</p><p>Harry held up his hands in a placating gesture. “I just wondered. I don’t care about Parkinson one way or another,” he said. His voice lowered of its own accord as he met Malfoy’s eyes. “It was just one of a lot of stupid things that a lot of stupid kids did during the war.”</p><p>The silence that met his statement was so profound, Harry could have sworn he heard his and Malfoy’s heartbeats, both. Malfoy examined him, obviously searching for some lingering resentment, or artifice. Honestly, Harry wished he still felt it sometimes, but he’d spent too much time by himself thinking about the events of the those last years at Hogwarts — and the events surrounding — to hold onto bitterness. If he could forgive, or at least try to <i>understand</i> Dumbledore, he could bloody well get off his high horse about Pansy Parkinson. And maybe even about Draco Malfoy. </p><p>Harry sighed, meeting Malfoy’s eyes again. He sat rigidly in his spot, no longer with the relaxed decadence of his earlier pose when he’d seemed ready to take on the mantle as Master of the House. His hands were loosely curled, long pale fingers folded under, and he was watching Harry closely. </p><p>“Really,” Harry said softly. “She’s– She’s welcome here, if you want her. As long as you two make sure to shut the fuck up after midnight.”</p><p>Malfoy huffed a surprised laugh, mouth curving into something genuinely amused — though at Harry’s sentiment or language, he couldn’t be sure. “Have big plans then, Potter?” Malfoy drawled. </p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. “Sleep, usually. But if Parkinson’s going to be spending the night… You said that thing about—”</p><p>“Fuck, no,” Malfoy said, inexplicably revolted for someone who’d just so strenuously defended his relationship with her. </p><p>“I thought– since you were living with her… Ginny and I went through the same thing before we broke up. Just needing to be away,” Harry offered, curious. </p><p>Malfoy was still shaking his head. “Ah yes, the Golden Couple,” he said with a wry twist to his lips. “I don’t generally believe the papers anymore, but I happen to see Lovegood from time to time, so I’ll extend my deepest sympathies to you. Apparently you’re still grieving over it, or so the <i>Prophet</i> says.”</p><p>“Completely,” Harry assured him, smirking. His eyes skimmed up the lean line of Malfoy, from the reflective shine on his supple, black shoes to the shoulders which were slightly broader than they’d been the last time Harry’d seen him. The difference in Malfoy that had eluded him before finally clicked: he was still lanky as ever but had somehow… filled out. His jaw had squared off a bit; his nose and chin were still pointy, but he looked like a <i>man</i> now. Harry drew his eyes up further and took in Malfoy’s face, which had gone strangely alert during Harry’s unconscious perusal of him. Their eyes locked for a long moment and Harry felt the spark of…<i>something</i> that he’d never thought to associate directly with Malfoy before. Malfoy seemed intrigued, bewildered, and just a tiny bit lost. Harry’s voice came out husky when he asked, “Why the no on Parkinson, then?”</p><p>The silence stretched out between them elastically; Harry felt the throb of his heart in every pulse point in his body; throat, wrists, ears… groin. Malfoy’s Adam’s apple bobbed above the collar of his robes, his throat long and pale. </p><p>“Not my type,” he said inscrutably. </p><p>“Oh.” Harry desperately wanted to ask what Malfoy’s type <i>was</i> — he was starting to wonder if his own penchant for blond men might have a relevant basis — and the question was pressed against the back of his teeth, about to topple off his tongue clumsily when Kreacher appeared between them with a soft <i>pop</i>. Harry exhaled too loudly, relieved. </p><p>Because wouldn’t that be a fucking disaster. </p><p>“Hi, Kreacher,” Harry croaked out. Malfoy made a stifled sound of assent, a little <i>Mmmhmm,</i> of greeting toward Kreacher. Harry realised Malfoy’s gently curled fingers had balled up tight and he looked down at his own hands, which had rested lightly on his thighs before that strange moment. They were now gripping them, fingers sinking into the tense muscles beneath the denim of his jeans. Harry willed them to loosen and after a second, they did.</p><p>Kreacher cleared the tray and plates, then looked at Harry with a much softer scowl than he usually wore; it meant he approved of something. “Will Master Harry be having his guest over for dinner as well? Is he being Master Harry’s new–”</p><p>“Housemate, yeah. Just my new housemate,” Harry rushed out. He glanced at Malfoy again, who was staring at the wall behind Harry, eyes wide and unmoving, as if he didn’t know where to put them. A flush rode high on his cheekbones, but he’d obviously heard the question and Harry’s answer, because he gave a jerky little nod. </p><p>“I can’t stay; thank you Kreacher,” he said, voice uneven. “Potter, when will you have the tenancy agreement drawn up?”</p><p>“My solicitor can have it by this weekend,” Harry said, still talking too fast. “Or sooner if–”</p><p>“This weekend is fine,” Malfoy said. His gaze dropped from the wall and he stood abruptly, glancing at Harry for a fraction of a second before dipping his chin to look down at Kreacher. “Where’s the door? You haven’t been able to unlock it for him?”</p><p>Kreacher’s huge, rheumy eyes shone briefly at being addressed so. “No, sir, Master Malfoy, Kreacher is not being ables to unlock the door when it is not revealing itself to Master Harry yet,” he explained in the most incomprehensibly dour tone; it was at complete odds with the expression of near-rapture on his wizened face. </p><p>“What door?” Harry asked. He stood too, feeling at a sudden disadvantage, and stuffed his hands into his pockets.</p><p>“It hasn’t even <i>shown</i> itself?” Malfoy asked with a sneer. He <i>tsk’d</i> under his breath. “Of course it hasn’t.” </p><p>“<i>What door?</i>” Harry demanded again, trying not to scowl. Malfoy finally looked back up at him, face haughty and composed as ever, and Harry wondered if he’d imagined what had happened – or had almost happened – or had seemed <i>about</i> to happen– or… Something. </p><p>“I’ll explain once I move in,” he said briefly, eyes glittering like a freshly sharpened blade. Harry’s jaw tightened.</p><p>“Fine,” he clipped out.</p><p>Malfoy hesitated, then stepped forward, closing the distance between them. “A wizard's agreement, then,” he said. His hand came up slowly, palm flat and fingers outstretched. Harry looked down at it, disoriented; he remembered a boy on a train, ten years prior. Remembered his own reaction to that hand.  </p><p>Harry took it. Malfoy’s fingers curled around his hand, then gave it two brief, sterile pumps. His palm was warm and not entirely dry, but not unpleasantly damp either. Harry tightened his grip, letting Malfoy direct the handshake; he felt the tingle of Malfoy’s magic meet his own as the loose terms of a wizard’s agreement — Harry’s first — bound their hands and brightened them for a moment. Malfoy released Harry with a brisk nod. </p><p>“Do you need to use the Floo to go home?” Harry asked, taking a step back just as Malfoy did.  </p><p>“Pansy doesn’t have one. I need to be somewhere, at any rate; it’s nearby,” Malfoy said absently. He rubbed at his jaw for a second, fingers lingering there thoughtfully.  “Owl me the agreement once it’s drawn up.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry said. Malfoy gave him another stilted nod, then strode out of the sitting room without so much as a goodbye. Harry looked down at Kreacher, who seemed disappointed — damn him. “What door?”</p><p>Kreacher grimaced, tugging at his ear. “Even if Master is ordering Kreacher to explain, Kreacher cannot,” he said cagily. “Kreacher is being ordered not to iron his hands, so Kreacher is not knowing what to do for defying Master.”</p><p>Harry sighed. “I’ll let Malfoy explain it,” he said. </p><p>Kreacher nodded, fervently grateful, then disappeared with another quiet pop, just as Harry heard the front door open and close. The heavy drapes unbound themselves in front of the French doors, blocking out the sun, and the fire and lamps all went out at once. </p><p>Harry pinched the bridge of his nose, standing in inky darkness. “Well, fuck.”</p>

  <p>~~~~</p>
</center>“Tell me why again,” Ron stage-whispered as Goyle levitated a trunk down the hallway, “you’re letting your house be infested by Slytherins?”<p>“I don’t know,” Harry said wearily. He rolled his bottle of pumpkin juice between his palms, taking comfort from the cool weight of the glass. “Because I speak Parseltongue?” </p><p>“Hah.” Ron’s eyes widened upon Zabini’s entrance; Zabini guided another floating trunk with his wand. It made ominous broken-glass sounds with every sway in the air. “It’s <i>such</i> a b–”</p><p>“Don’t say it again,” Harry ordered, taking a drink. They’d been lounging in the sitting room for over an hour; so far Malfoy and his friends had brought in seventeen trunks. Harry had stopped feeling surprised after the first five; he’d even stopped feeling appalled after a dozen. Now it was a kind of numb, lingering awareness that his House was being taken over, and he’d been the lunatic who’d agreed to it.</p><p>“Fine, I won’t.” Ron paused. “But it <i>is</i> a bad idea, and you know it.”</p><p>“Oh, look. Eighteen,” Harry said flatly. Parkinson and Malfoy came in behind this one; it was large, outfitted in heavy brass buckles and locks, with thick leather straps holding it closed. It emitted the strong scent of herbs and spices — not altogether unpleasant, actually. </p><p>“We so appreciate your help,” Malfoy said snidely as they navigated down the hall toward the staircase. He was wearing a white button down and grey slacks. His sleeves were rolled up to mid-forearm, and Harry kept catching little glimpses of the stark black lines of his Mark. He didn’t know what to think, that Malfoy bared it so easily. “Yes, I think you and Weasley <i>should</i> rest for a bit; you’ve done a lot of work today.”</p><p>Harry didn’t move from his seat. “Not in the contract,” he pointed out, raising his voice slightly.  Malfoy huffed and Parkinson shushed him, ticking an uneasy glance in Harry’s direction. Harry grinned at her, baring all of his teeth. He may have gotten past the war crap, but he was having too much fun rattling her to stop. He widened his thighs and affected a relaxed posture, holding his pumpkin juice between his thumb and forefinger and letting it dangle near his knee, then wandlessly Summoned a book from a nearby shelf with his free hand. Her face whitened and she said something to Malfoy under her breath. He shook his head at her, reaching up to wipe some sweat off his brow with his rolled sleeve; some dust streaked across it, and Harry took another drink of his juice.</p><p>“He’s just being a prick,” Malfoy said loudly. “He told me he’d like to have you over.”</p><p>“<i>What?</i>” Ron demanded, just as Harry snickered.  </p><p>“That’s just Malfoy bending the truth to suit him,” Harry said lowly as Malfoy and Parkinson made their way up the stairs. “Like always. What do you want to bet they’ll reach thirty?”</p><p>“Trunks?” Ron asked. “They can’t have. Unless Malfoy packed up the whole of Malfoy Manor in them — those trunks are usually built in with massive extension charms. I bet most of them are empty and he’s just doing it to get under your skin, actually.”</p><p>“Five Galleons?”</p><p>“Fine.” Ron folded his arms and settled deeper into the sofa to watch their progress. Really, Harry wasn’t even sure where Malfoy was putting them all. Though he’d picked the second-largest bedroom on the second floor — just across from Harry’s — there was still no way he’d be able to store the trunks in there and have any expectation of getting around his own room unless he planned on using his broom from doorway to bed to loo. Harry was almost afraid to go upstairs and find out.</p><p>Zabini came down with Goyle a minute later. He hesitated in the archway of the sitting room. “Got any more?” he asked, jerking his chin at Harry’s juice. </p><p>Raising his eyebrows, Harry nodded. He called for Kreacher, who reappeared with the extra juice so fast it made Harry wonder again how elves could Apparate without Splinching themselves. Zabini nudged Goyle hard in the ribs, then ambled into the room, plucking up from the coffee table one of the forty or so juice bottles Kreacher had decided were necessary. Goyle’s hulking shape followed him slowly, and Zabini passed him a bottle. They took seats in the musty velvet armchairs across from the sofa, and all four of them stared at each other for a few moments.</p><p>“Nice place,” Zabini finally said, face bland. Goyle grunted what Harry thought was supposed to be an agreement.</p><p>“Thanks,” Harry said. “I love it.”</p><p>“It’s a shithole,” Zabini added.</p><p>“I know; Malfoy’s getting a fucking raw deal on this one,” Harry agreed immediately, cheerful at the prospect. “I basically just have to put up with him — which I did for years — and he’s got to make this place habitable for me. Think it’ll take him very long?”</p><p>Ron snorted, coming out of whatever associating-with-Slytherins coma he’d gone into. Zabini cracked a smile, dark eyes cataloguing the the ugly antique sconces on the walls, the faded, peeling wallpaper, and the cobwebs that Harry was pretty sure had been spelled to stay up in the corner. But Goyle outright laughed, his wide, intimidating face going astonishingly merry before he caught himself, his laugh slightly softer and higher-pitched than Harry would have guessed — if he’d thought for a single second that Goyle knew how to smile.</p><p>Harry and Ron looked at each other wordlessly, then turned back to him. “What?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Well, that was kind of funny,” Goyle said. </p><p>Harry shrugged. It hadn’t been <i>that</i> funny, but he supposed it was nice that Goyle knew what a joke was.</p><p>“Just,” Goyle continued, as if Harry had asked for clarification, “you know, the idea that you put up with him for years, ‘cause you didn’t. Not that he minds so much anymore; at least now he gets to–”</p><p>“Greg,” Zabini said. </p><p>“Right, sorry,” Goyle mumbled, subsiding. </p><p>At a loss, Harry opened his mouth to ask what that had meant — it wasn’t as if Malfoy had put up with him, <i>either</i> — but Malfoy and Parkinson chose that moment to come trudging down the stairs. They stopped, gaping from the archway. Then Malfoy sniffed, dragging his forearm over his forehead again, and came in, picking his own bottle of juice and popping it open. He stood there, long throat working silently as he drank it, then set down the empty bottle. “Would you like one, Pansy?”</p><p>“No thank you,” she said faintly from the hallway.</p><p>Harry looked at Malfoy; he was decidedly... messy. Unexpectedly dirty; that streak of grime still on his forehead, his white-blond hair mussed and out of place. His shirt clung to his lanky body lightly, probably from sweat, and it was harder than it should have been to stop staring, made worse by Ron’s face when Harry accidentally glanced in his direction. He hurriedly turned to stare at Goyle who — for the first time since Harry had met him — seemed the most neutral thing in the room.</p><p>“It’s fine, Parkinson,” Harry said, rolling his eyes at Malfoy’s glare. “Have some pumpkin juice.”</p><p>“I don’t like pumpkin juice,” she called.</p><p>“It’s imported from France,” Malfoy said.</p><p>There was a long silence, and then Parkinson came stomping into the room — as well as she could, wearing three inch heels. Her shoulders came back, red mouth flat and tight as she grabbed the bottle Malfoy offered. She opened it and started drinking, shooting Harry defiant looks the whole time, and Harry tamped down a laugh. </p><p>“I don’t know what you’re expecting me to do,” he said mildly.</p><p>“Kill her,” Zabini, Goyle, Malfoy and Ron all said at the same time.</p><p>“I <i>am not</i>,” she said, nostrils flaring. “I’m not afraid of him — of <i>you</i>, Potter.”</p><p>“Painfully,” Zabini added. “She thinks you can do wandless magic.”</p><p>“I can,” Harry said, biting back a grin.</p><p>“She thinks you’re sneakier than you let on,” Goyle put in.</p><p>“He is,” Ron said. Harry threw him an appreciative glance.</p><p>“And she certainly thinks you wouldn’t be punished if she were to vanish mysteriously,” Malfoy said drily, picking up another bottle. He sipped it more slowly, amused gaze travelling from Parkinson to Harry and back.</p><p>“That one’s probably true too,” Harry said. </p><p>“You’ve been threatening me <i>all day</i>,” Parkinson said. </p><p>“I haven’t said a word to you!” Harry objected. Which was technically true, though it didn’t really address what she’d said. Apparently she realised that, because she gave him a suspicious glance before tipping her bottle up to her mouth again.</p><p>“You didn’t need to,” she said resentfully. “If you’re still angry about that whole–”</p><p>“Trying to hand me over to–” Harry started, grinning again, but Malfoy cut him off.</p><p>“I literally didn’t think he’d get under anyone’s skin as badly as he did mine,” he drawled, tapping Parkinson on the shoulder and giving her a censorious look. </p><p>“And Malfoy’s going to be living here,” Harry said, gazing at her with wide-eyes. “I wonder what I’ll do to <i>him</i>.”</p><p>“Don’t think I haven’t warned him of exactly that,” she snapped. “And if we could live together any longer, don’t think I wouldn’t make sure he didn’t have to come here.”</p><p>Harry paused. “What do you mean, if you could–”</p><p>“More trunks,” Malfoy said. He looked at his friends. “Get off your lazy arses, and let’s just finish, already.”</p><p>Goyle nodded and stood, lumbering out without waiting for anyone. </p><p>“When I said I’d help, I didn’t think I was actually volunteering for physical labour,” Zabini grumbled, but stood up anyway, too. He stretched, raising his arms above his head and twisting from side to side. His shirt rode up and his low-slung jeans revealed a tempting strip of dark skin, and Harry took a moment to appreciate the V of his hipbones, covered in a fine layer of muscle. </p><p>Then Ron nudged him and Harry flushed guiltily; he took another sip of juice, hoping no one else had noticed his ogling, because the room had grown suspiciously quiet. He forced himself to look up; everyone was looking at him with vastly different expressions: Parkinson had an unholy gleam in her green eyes — she looked fascinated and way too delighted for Harry’s comfort; Zabini was smirking and seemed rather smug; and Malfoy… Harry blinked. Malfoy looked... furious.</p><p>He set his half-empty bottle of juice down with a definitive <i>thunk.</i> “Right, then,” he said flatly. “Back to work.” His face twisted into a sneer; from his height advantage of standing, he stared down his nose at Harry. “I don’t suppose you lot might lend a hand now that you’ve gotten in some good practice being completely fucking unhelpful?”</p><p>Harry pretended to think about it; he’d considered offering when Goyle and Zabini had sat down, but Malfoy’s tone grated on his nerves. “I don’t know. I still feel way too helpful for my own good. I probably should practice some more. Ron?”</p><p>“Yeah, not gonna happen,” Ron said. </p><p>Malfoy huffed, glaring at them in turn. He grabbed Pansy’s arm and hauled her out of the room, ignoring her little squawk of protest.  </p><p>“Call me Blaise–” Zabini started, smiling at Harry slowly.</p><p>“Blaise!” Malfoy barked from out of Harry’s sightline. “Don’t get ideas; you’re wrong.”</p><p>Blaise shrugged and strolled out, “What? I wasn’t! I know full well how–” Harry heard him say from the hall before his voice faded. Harry sagged into his sofa and tipped Ron a look, then glanced away.</p><p>“I’d be more grossed out over you checking out Zabini,” Ron muttered quietly, “if you hadn’t been even worse about Malfoy. <i>Really</i>, Harry?  Why <i>him?</i>”</p><p>“What?” Harry asked, trying to brazen it out. </p><p>“Oh, god,” Ron suddenly moaned, covering his face with both hands. “I wish this didn’t make as much sense as it does. I should have fucking known, shouldn’t I, when you told me you’d picked him to live here? ‘Mione’s going to give me that <i>look</i>.”</p><p>Irritated, Harry shook his head. “<i>What?</i>” he asked again, sharper.</p><p>“It’s a <i>bad idea</i>,” Ron said again rather than answering him. “He’s still… He is who he is, Harry. No matter what you might, uh.” He coughed, a flush spreading up his cheeks. “You know— think he looks like, or whatever. Seriously, go after Zabini before you think about doing anything with Malfoy.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t!” Harry lied, defensive. His ears grew scorchingly hot when Ron simply looked at him, almost sympathetically. Harry winced. “I really wouldn’t,” he said again, lowering his voice to a whisper. “Just because I might find him attractive… I wouldn’t. He’s going to be living here — that <i>wasn’t</i> the reason I picked him, you know — and it would make things awkward. Besides, he’s maybe not even into men.”</p><p>“What do you mean, ‘maybe’?” Ron asked instantly, latching onto that with an intensity that left Harry wanting to kick himself for the way he revealed too much when he got flustered.</p><p>“I dunno. There was a– a second when I thought that maybe he was. But it doesn’t matter,” he insisted. “He’s <i>Malfoy</i>, Ron.  I mean, he did write Hermione that letter apologising for calling her a Mudblood, and for what his aunt did, and he testified against the remaining Death Eaters, too, and I guess he talks to Luna some, so he can’t be all bad, but–”</p><p>“Stop it!” Ron said miserably, burying his face in his hands again.  “I swear to Merlin, Harry, if you end up talking about him as much as you did in sixth year, I’ll hex your mouth shut.” He pulled his hands away and glowered down at his knees for a moment, then muttered, “I can’t believe you’re <i>defending</i> him. What about that guy Charlie set you up with?”</p><p>“I’m not defending Malfoy,” Harry said, disconcerted to realise that he had been. “I was just– trying to make the next... however long more bearable.” He lifted his chin and met Ron’s eyes. “And Robert was nice. <i>Very</i> nice,” he added, grinning and waggling his eyebrows. Ron snorted. “But he doesn’t live here, you know that. He was only in England for a couple of weeks.”</p><p>“Then go to Australia, or wherever he lives,” Ron said, with a sulky frown. “If it means getting you away from–”</p><p>“Nothing’s going to happen,” Harry assured him. So what if he was attracted to Malfoy — and so what if it turned out that, against all odds, Malfoy might be attracted back? He’d obviously disliked the idea of anything between them enough to close himself off when they’d shared that oddly charged moment earlier in the week. And ever since then, he seemed to be doing his level best to remind Harry what an utter wanker he could be. But Ron didn’t look all that reassured, so Harry added, “Really. I’m just hoping neither of us ends up in the hospital.”</p><p>Face relaxing marginally, Ron sighed just as Goyle and Zabini — Blaise, Harry thought, admiring the width of his shoulders beneath his t-shirt — floated a trunk past them and up the staircase. He could hear Malfoy and Parkinson bickering in the background, and then they came into view as well, passing the room with a small series of cases, stacked tightly together. </p><p>“Do those count as one?” he wondered aloud. “Or as four?”</p><p>Ron opened his mouth to respond but clicked it shut when Harry’s Floo flared to life. Hermione stepped out, looking concerned as she dusted herself off, heading immediately over to Ron’s side. “Are you not done protecting Harry from Dark wizards yet?”</p><p>“I told you, I was just coming over here because Harry got a new batch of that fancy pumpkin juice,” Ron said, leaning into her when she sat down beside him. He sounded embarrassed, and Harry felt a rush of fondness toward him because <i>of course</i> protecting him was what Ron had meant to do when he’d suddenly mentioned listening to a repeat Canons game on the wireless today — which they hadn’t even turned on for a moment.</p><p>“Right,” Hermione said, tossing a half-grin Harry’s way. He returned it and leaned forward, snagging a bottle for her too.</p><p>“Want some fancy pumpkin juice?” Harry asked and she laughed. Ron flushed darker. </p><p>“Well, it sounds paranoid <i>now</i>,” he muttered under his breath just as Blaise and Goyle came back down the staircase, followed closely by Parkinson and Malfoy, who were breathing heavily.</p><p>“Merlin,” Hermione said, “why have the pair of you taken a break when they’re still moving in?”</p><p>Ron and Harry exchanged glances. </p><p>“We, uh–” Ron started, just as Harry said, “Well, you know–”</p><p>Her mouth drew down in a moue of disapproval. “Do you mean to say you’ve been watching them move in for over an <i>hour</i> and neither of you have lifted a finger to help?” she demanded. “Harry, I know Malfoy’s a– I know you two used to really– but... “ She sighed, brushing back her curls one-handed. “He’s going to be living here. Is that really the best way to start things off?”</p><p>“We didn’t want to get in anyone’s way?” Harry tried weakly. Ron nodded emphatically.</p><p>“Besides, it’s just mean to watch people do all the work without pitching in,” Hermione said, sounding put-out. Her elbow connected with Ron’s ribcage, and he gave a little “oof,” as she stood, smoothing down her t-shirt. “Which you both know,” she said pointedly, then walked out of the room. </p><p>Harry heard her soft voice greet someone and closed his eyes briefly, wondering how badly it would reflect on them if they just sat there and watched her, too. But Ron was already standing and sighing heavily, which didn’t bode well for his support system. It was one thing to have someone with him as he didn’t help Malfoy and his friends, but being the only one not to pitch in would look just plain bad.</p><p>“Come on,” Ron said wearily. “There’s probably only a few left.”</p><p>“Double or nothing it’s more than forty,” Harry muttered, getting up. Ron made a noise of disbelief but trailed after him.  </p><p>There were forty-six.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~~~~</p>
</center>Five hours later, Harry lay sprawled on his sofa, sore and dusty from head to feet. After Malfoy had grudgingly accepted his and Ron’s help — thanking Hermione more effusively than Harry really thought necessary — they’d made relatively short work of levitating the remaining trunks and furniture up the stairs, where the mystery of storage had been revealed. Apparently, Grimmauld Place had expanded Malfoy’s dressing room for each trunk; it had looked like a storage unit by the time they were done getting everything in. Malfoy had just looked at him disdainfully when Harry had asked about it and said, “That’s what the House ought to <i>do</i>, and it knows that I know it.”<p>“Then you’d better start teaching me,” Harry had snapped, unaccountably annoyed and more than a little convinced that Malfoy’s bedroom had gotten larger, as well. </p><p>Hermione had eased the tension by suggesting they organise — which no one but Malfoy had been interested in, but not one of them could find a way out of, either. But with every direction Malfoy gave on where and how the trunks should be organised, the House responded, shuffling around until there were units within units, small cubbies and larger shelving spaces on the back. They’d organised and reorganised until Malfoy was satisfied and everyone but Hermione was exhausted. And then they’d all collapsed in the sitting room, talking dully and drinking the massive amounts of butterbeer Kreacher had insisted on supplying everyone until Blaise and Goyle had said their goodbyes and Parkinson had reminded Malfoy that she wasn’t going to be taking care of his turtle for a single second.</p><p>That had spurred Malfoy into action — seemingly the only thing that could, at that point; he’d looked twice as knackered as anyone else, and no wonder really, loathe though Harry was to give him much credit in the “does physical labour” category. But he’d worked hard — Harry had seen it with his own eyes — and didn’t even spare the time to do much more than cast a swift cleaning charm over himself before walking out with Parkinson and grumbling under his breath about the uselessness of friends.</p><p>Harry let himself drift, feeling drowsy, the fire crackling merrily a few feet away. It had lit up of its own accord after Ron and Hermione had taken their leave. The House had had such a... welcoming feeling to it all day, warm and cosy, like a home <i>should</i> feel, and he considered falling asleep on the sofa, which suddenly felt massively more comfortable; the worn cushions softer, the cracked leather supple. </p><p>The sound of the front door opening caught his attention, and Harry blinked, wondering if he’d actually managed to doze for a few minutes.  He nudged his glasses up higher from where they’d slid to the bridge of his nose and waited, but Malfoy didn’t come marching through immediately. Instead, the sound of creaking occurred, quietly at first and then louder, and the light from the streetlamp outside suddenly… got brighter. Widened. With disbelief, Harry realised that the House was expanding the door to strange proportions to let Malfoy in. He sat up, dust falling from his hair in a soft, silent puff when he shook his head in shock.</p><p>Because Malfoy didn’t have a turtle for a pet.</p><p>“That’s a–” Harry pointed, words failing him.</p><p>“Potter, meet Francis,” Malfoy said calmly, levitating the <i>giant fucking tortoise</i> in front of him. The thing was… unrealistically huge; it had to be at least a metre long, its dusty green-brown shell bulbous and overwhelming over its scaly legs and protruding head. It blinked docilely as Malfoy floated him into the sitting room and then carefully set him down in the middle of the rug. “My tortoise.”</p><p>Harry scrambled to standing. “What– What did you– that’s not a turtle!”</p><p>“I never <i>said</i> turtle, Potter,” Malfoy said. He reached into the pocket of his trousers and pulled out what looked to be a handful of small blossoms, then held his hand under the tortoise's mouth. It paused, then slowly reached its neck out, opening its mouth and taking the flowers from Malfoy, jaw working. Malfoy stroked its head with the tips of two fingers, an exasperatingly fond expression writ across his face. “I said tortoise. A Galápagos tortoise, to be specific. He won’t be any trouble.”</p><p>“Trouble?” Harry demanded. “Shouldn’t it… I don’t know, be on the <i>Galápagos islands</i> or something? How are you expecting to take care of it? How did you even <i>get it</i>? Goddamn it, Malfoy, if I’d known you were going to pull some kind of stunt like this–”</p><p>Malfoy flicked him an irritated glance. “It’s not a stunt. He’s my pet, and charms take care of his climate regulations just fine. We had him at the Manor. He’s been with my family for almost four generations. The peacocks were easy to find homes for — Merlin knows why, they had horrible temperaments — but no one had the experience to take care of Francis. I wasn’t going to just <i>send him back to the islands</i>, thank you, he’s domesticated — and magical, as well… Besides which, I’d never gotten to properly take care of him, growing up. My father preferred the elves to do all of it; I had to sneak off if I wanted to see him,” he said, voice going quiet even as he darted glittering, challenging eyes to gauge Harry. “And I’d always wanted to, so now he’s my pet,” he finished, giving its head another stroke with two fingers.</p><p>Harry ran a hand through his hair, releasing a small cloud of dust. He couldn’t pretend to be comfortable with that glimpse into the Malfoy family dynamics, but having had it, he couldn’t find a proper way to say <i>no, of course we’re not keeping your completely unsuitable pet here.</i> Instead, he said, “How is it magical?”</p><p>“Tortoise magic is very mysterious,” Malfoy said cryptically. </p><p>“Which means what?” Harry asked, staring down at the placid beast, which had stopped chewing and was beginning to investigate the rest of the room — albeit at an incredibly gradual pace, thick stubby legs barely pushing against the floor. “It’s not dangerous?”</p><p>“Of course not!” Malfoy sounded offended, and Harry looked up at him. His lip was curled in the beginnings of a sneer.</p><p>“Then what?”</p><p>“It’s none of your business,” Malfoy said vaguely, lifting his chin. He looked at the tortoise affectionately. </p><p>Harry narrowed his eyes. “He doesn’t do <i>anything,</i> does he?”</p><p>Malfoy’s cheeks reddened. “Of course he does. As I said, he’s mag–”</p><p>“Have you ever <i>seen</i> him do anything magical? Take post, for instance? Build wards? Fly?” Harry asked. “Hem your trousers?”</p><p>“My trousers are all tailored,” Malfoy snapped. “And he’s still not quite a hundred; plenty of time for him to reveal what his magical abilities are — if he <i>chooses</i> to; tortoises are very private. Not that it matters; he’s stipulated in the lease contract. He’s mine. He’ll stay here.”</p><p>“Malfoy!” Malfoy looked at him and Harry huffed out a sigh. “I thought he’d… stay with you. In a tank or some such thing. In your room.”</p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous, Potter, he barely fit in through the front door; I’m not likely to get him up the stairs without major architectural restructuring on the part of the House, am I?” Malfoy scoffed, sounding as though <i>Harry</i> were the one being unreasonable. “And this way, he can have access to the garden; the French doors are wide enough to accommodate him, and as I said — he’s very well behaved, so.”</p><p>Harry pressed his fingertips to his eyelids behind his glasses. When he pulled them away, the tortoise was still there — and still taking far more space in his sitting room than a tortoise should. He’d stopped roaming, though, and looked up from the vantage point of Harry’s shins to Harry’s face, black eyes reflecting the light of the fire. </p><p>“Fine,” Harry said, mostly because he had no other recourse and this was likely an exhaustion-induced dream. “He’ll stay here. But he’s not magical.”</p><p>“Of course he’ll stay here,” Malfoy said. His shoulders came down a little and only then did Harry realise how stiff they’d been, how much tension Malfoy had been holding himself with. “And he is so.”</p><p>Flicking another irritated glance in Malfoy’s direction, Harry slowly lowered into a crouch and met the beady-bright gaze with his own. “Hi,” he said softly. He was... actually kind of neat. Harry wondered what his skin felt like. “Can I touch him?” he asked, not looking up; without waiting for permission, he stroked the dry, scaly skin on the top of his head. “I’m Harry. Nice to meet you, Frank.”</p><p>“It’s <i>Francis</i>” Malfoy snapped. Suddenly an elegantly long-fingered hand was under Harry’s nose, with a palmful of bright red blossoms. “Give him these; he likes them.”</p><p>“What are they?” Harry asked dubiously. He took the flowers, aware of the way the tips of his fingers raked over Malfoy’s palm. He reached them out and put them under Frank’s mouth, who finally broke his gaze and leaned down to eat.</p><p>“Flowers; what do they look like?” Malfoy asked. </p><p>Harry snorted. “Fine.” He looked up, not even startled to see that Malfoy’s face was soft — grey eyes warm on Frank as he chewed — when just a few years ago, Harry would have never believed that Malfoy could look at <i>anything</i> that way, let alone a strange, rare Muggle beast. “He’s nice.”</p><p>Malfoy sighed and folded his arms. “That’s what I’ve been <i>telling you,</i> Potter.”</p><p>“No, I’m fairly certain you left that part out.” Harry stood after giving Frank’s head another couple of gentle strokes. “You said he was well-behaved and magical and wouldn’t be any trouble — and I’m only convinced of the well-behaved part, so far. But he <i>is</i> nice, Malfoy.”</p><p>“Well, yes.” Looking as though he wasn’t sure what to do with his hands or body, Malfoy stood oddly still, arms dangling awkwardly at his sides. After a moment, he nodded again. “He’ll be fine here. But I’d better–”</p><p>“Oh, right,” Harry said after a beat. “Bed.”</p><p>“It’s been a long day,” Malfoy said. </p><p>“Um, yeah. I guess we could put off House-lessons until tomorrow,” Harry admitted; the drowsiness that had vanished upon Frank’s arrival hit in again, full-force. “It’s been well-mannered tonight. We’ll start tomorrow.”</p><p>“We’ll start when I can,” Malfoy corrected. He didn’t sound mean; just tired. “I’m otherwise occupied tomorrow.”</p><p>“Oh.” A little deflated, Harry nodded silently for a second. “Well then. I’ll… er… Be up in a second.”</p><p>Malfoy looked at him quite hard, eyes taking in Harry’s face, and Harry tried not to shift uncomfortably; his clothes were filthy and his hair felt more disastrous than usual. “Okay,” Malfoy said. “Then– Goodnight, Potter.”</p><p>“G’night,” Harry said awkwardly, shoving his hands into his pockets and sitting back down. “I’ll see you… I guess in the morning.”</p><p>With one final, searching look, Malfoy nodded, then swept out of the room. Harry heard the gentle tread of his feet on the stairs, and let his head fall to the back of the couch with a sense of incredulity and pending doom.</p><p>He’d done it. He was officially living with Malfoy.</p>
