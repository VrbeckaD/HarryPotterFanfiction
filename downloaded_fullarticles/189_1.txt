    <p>During the springtime, Harry had felt the shift, that had been when this feeling had arisen in him. It had been subtle and completely unexpected, unwanted for sure, but nonetheless it confused him to no end. It had been detention for god's sake, nothing to be excited about, yet what had occurred in that detention had set his mind into gear, and it just wouldn't stop working.</p><p>He just couldn't keep his mouth shut, he had seen inside Snape's mind, he knew why the man treated him as such. Thinking him to be like someone else when in all reality he was nothing like him.</p><p>A simple brush really, he'd turned and ran straight into the blasphemous man himself, still obviously pissed about having been given detention for his lunch hour, and had gotten right in his Potions Master's face. Undeterred and unmoving he had no idea what force had allowed him to stand in that man's presence for so long without looking away like a kicked dog. He had never noticed until then how dark exactly Snape's eyes had been, and within them sat a torrent of secrets, lies, lost love and something Harry couldn't even hope to fathom.</p><p>Something had sparked there within their close proximity, the brush of Harry's fingers against Snape's cloaked arm as he brushed past, his face heating. He could see it in his eyes, an unfamiliar emotion that brought forth flames and ignited Harry's interest, he knew that he needed to be careful, however, lest he be burned by the flames that scorched in those dark eyes.</p><hr/><p>As he walked into the great hall Harry immediately found Hermione and Ron, sitting quickly and filling his plate.</p><p>"Harry? Why are you here you early? I thought Professor Snape gave you detention?" Hermione inquired inquisitively, tearing a piece from her bread as she did so.</p><p>"Yeah mate, I thought you were in the dragon's lair for lunch?" Ron's mouth was full, but Harry was less disgusted by it than Hermione so he explained vaguely was his return was so soon.</p><p>"He let me go early." Which was a total lie, Harry had practically fled the room, quick feet, and racing heart. He hadn't even asked before he left, he just did. He expected another detention within the hour no doubt, and that thought made lunch all the more wonderful, so he was going to enjoy it.</p><p>"What are you? His favorite?" Ron quired as a piece of the sandwich he was devouring fell back onto his plate. Hermione groaned silently.</p><p>"Maybe..." Harry replied, and he was left to eat his lunch in silence for the rest of the break, not even lifting his eyes as long legs and dark robes whisked past him, towards the staff table. He sighed as he got up to leave, he had Herbology next, which thankfully was an easy class.</p><p>He didn't know what he would do if he had Potion's next.</p><p>God forbid.</p><hr/><p>For the next couple of days, Harry had found that he had been unable to rest, his head had been filled with dreams-more like nightmares-and they plagued him even in the day it seemed. He rubbed at his eyes furiously as he stepped into the one class he'd been dreading today as well.</p><p>Potions.</p><p>He'd been able to escape fairly quickly at the end of each class, zipping out from between people. It would only work for so long he knew, and the Professor was literally-well figuratively- burning holes into the side of his head as he appeared, sitting quickly next to Ron. Once everyone arrived, Harry watched with neat fascination as Snape's hands moved through the air. The man had always had that dramatic air about him, not in the things that he did or such, but the way he moved-slow, measured, never missing a beat-Harry only began to notice these things when he watched the man, and he never thought that it would intrigue him so.</p><p>Swallowing, his eyes trailed to the long fingers that Snape possessed, watching their little dance as they moved about the air, gesturing to nothing in particular. It was mesmerizing on a level that of which Harry didn't believe he could fall victim to, yet here he was, entranced entirely by his Professor's long fingers. A sharp jab to his ribs had him snapping his head to the right, where Ron not so subtly gestured to the front of the room, and to all the people watching him.</p><p>"Um," He swallowed again, this time for a different reason. "I'm sorry Professor but-"</p><p>"Let me guess," The man scowled again and Harry took in a low shallow breath. "You were...<em>distracted?</em>" It wasn't the word itself-for yes, he was <em>distracted</em>-but it had been the way the man had said it. That underlying tone of knowing that made Harry shiver in fear. That he somehow <em>knew</em> what Harry had been watching, what he had been thinking, and it made Harry freeze on the spot, a curt sharp nod his only response that signaled he was ready for Snape's carefully worded comeback.</p><p>"Unsurprising, perhaps another detention is required to refocus you?" Harry felt all his muscles tense again, and for once he was unsure of his answer. A part of him- a part he refused to name-wanted to see what would occur if he was left alone with that man again, what carefully measured steps they would take, what direction it would lead them to. The other-more rational- part told him that he'd have to be an absolute masochist to want another detention with Snape, even though the last hadn't been that bad.</p><p>He kept quiet, and all eyes were still on him even as he continued to look into the slightly calmer eyes of his Potions Master. Silence continued to ensue, but Harry wasn't backing down on this, he felt as if he'd lose a silent battle, one he desperately wished to win. Professor Snape crept closer, and Harry felt Ron shift away from him, he could see them again. The flames that burned withing those eyes, he was seeing them again, dark and so dangerous. Yet once again, however, Harry was unafraid, standing his ground. He could see it, just as he had before, that little shift, one that no one would witness unless they were watching.</p><p>It was then that he heard the shuffle of feet, as people packed up to leave, no longer paying attention to them.</p><p>"Perhaps," Snape spoke, his tone much harsher than before, Harry felt himself shrink in. "If you had parents, you would know that it is incredibly rude to not respond to your elder." Harry hadn't an idea what had driven the man to say such a thing, but he knew that his in his chest, it felt as if a stake had been stabbed there. Harry rose quickly and he only managed to catch a glimpse of the regret on Snape's face as he practically ran from the room.</p><p>He was wrong, those flames weren't interesting or intriguing, they were dangerous.</p><p>And they hurt like hell.</p><hr/><p>He hadn't been able to sleep, he just kept waking up, thoughts of earlier today still mulling around in his mind. It was ridiculous really, absolutely asinine that such thoughts were keeping him awake. It was hard to ignore all of it, so he went to the Library, his feet hitting the floor beneath him with a form of quiet that he had tried and failed to perfect yet. His cloak was around him, as it always was, just so he could go without the scathing that would come with being out past curfew. He was undeniably grateful for the cloak, as it had been his silent savor in many times of need.</p><p>Forcing the library door open, he was relieved to note that it was empty for the night, so that meant that none of the Professors' had decided on some late-night reading that would surely foil his plan. With a grunt, he managed to close the large door, and he made his way towards a section that was very rarely touched. He wasn't committing a large crime or anything by being here, but it would dock points from his house if he was caught, so he made sure he was as light as possible as he made his way down a narrow path.</p><p>The Library was dark, all the candles put out, so it made sneaking through easier. He slid down near the end of the shelf where it met with a window. He didn't take much time to marvel at the full moon, or the stars, he just leaned heavily against one of the bookshelves and pulled out a book that he'd held many times before.</p><p>He flicked it open, hoping to see their smiling faces once again if only to keep it in his memory a little longer. Every day was a challenge for him, never knowing if the next day he'd be alive or dead drove him to many sleepless nights, often ending up with him sitting right here. Snape's venomous words from earlier still rang clear in his head. He'd been told worse, but to be told such a thing by him...it hurt a lot more than it should, that was for sure.</p><p>He paused on a picture, and he took an extra-long moment to study it. He had never quite seen this one, he was always searching for ones of them together, doing things that people in love did, but he hadn't expected this.</p><p>In the moving picture, there was a woman, one he'd come to know through these pictures, with red hair, and her arm slung around a scowling boy, with long dark hair and an almost too-long nose, it seemed like the woman was the only one smiling. Just as the picture went to restart, however, Harry noticed the faintest markings of a smile appearing across that boy's face, before the picture restarted all over again.</p><p>From his eyes, he could feel the wetness develop, and his blurry eyes went to the next picture, watching as that same woman was suddenly picked up and swung in a circle, with those closed eyes and a smile that could light up the world. The man holding her sharing in her brightness, all glasses and dark hair, before it started all over again, and tears began to fall from Harry's eyes.</p><p>He sucked in a breath suddenly, trying his best not to break. He knew that no one would see, but that still didn't make it pathetic. He felt his throat closing as more tears began to fall, the burning from his throat made him try to hold it all in-he failed, miserably so. He sat there for a while, mourning the loss of those wonderful people, that he would never ever get the chance to see, to meet, to be apart of. The crippling loneliness was there still, but it just felt more heavy sitting here, in this dark space, with only his tears to comfort him.</p><p>"Potter." It made him stop, his sob stuck in his throat, why oh god, why? Now he'd be given detention again, and his house would get docked points just so he could indulge in picture's that held people he didn't even know. This was all too much, couldn't he just cry in peace and then return tomorrow, but with fewer pieces of his being? He recognized that voice too, despite the ringing in his ears and the pounding in his head, he knew that Snape had been the one to find him in such a state, the thought didn't comfort him.</p><p>He stood, without a second thought, and the cloak slipped to his shoulders. He could only stare at the shoes of his professor, shiny in the moonlight, and eerily more preferable than the man's dark eyes right now. He had never quite taken into account how much taller Snape was compared to himself, he only reached the man's shoulder, no matter what, he was sure Snape would only see him as a wet-eared brat until he grew taller, which Harry highly doubted would happen any time soon.</p><p>"It's past curfew." Snape's tone wasn't contradictory, it was soft, calm, telling. Harry nodded, not trusting his cracking voice one bit at the moment.</p><p>Harry sniffed and wiped at his glasses, having to take them off. Really he was just giving his hands something to do, for they were shaking so badly, and he invited the distraction. Everything was still blurry, but in all reality that was just going to make this easier on Harry, if he couldn't see, then maybe he could pretend in the morning that this had never happened, and Snape had not seen him in such an...disconcerting position.</p><p>"She was always smiling, you know."Harry sniffed again, and Snape continued quietly, his voice hardly above a whisper. "Lily truly had the most beautiful smile..." Harry couldn't even count the seconds that it took for him to jump at the man then, flinging his arms anywhere he could grab on. The cloak fell away from him as Snape stumbled backward into the other shelf, Harry refused to let go, gripping tightly to the man's robes, a silent plea for that comfort he could find nowhere else.</p><p>Snape was rigid in Harry's tight embrace, and Harry breathed down the man's neck quickly, losing his breath due to his lack of said breath. The man hadn't moved, and Harry didn't think that he would, not until he let go. Harry-not wanting to make this situation any more awkward than it already was-slowly slid down until his feet hit the floor. He wanted to say one last thing before this conversation would be gone forever-never to be brought up again. The words were already slipping out of his mouth before he could even relinquish his hold on the taller man.</p><p>"She," He tried again. "She was very beautiful..." Though in that moment he knew the older man would come to regret it, Harry knew that he would treasure such an act of kindness until he met with fate.</p><p>"Never speak of this to anyone Potter."</p><p>With long fingers gliding through his slightly-longer hair, Harry held to the words that slipped from those long thin lips, his breath pressed to the side of a warm neck.</p><p>"I know she was," and with them he came undone, letting the dam break lose. "I know..." Snape only stood there, unmoving as Harry sobbed till his throat was raw, and his cheeks were stained red.</p><p>"I'm sorry for earlier today, it was uncalled for." Even as he heard the words, Harry knew they were slightly forced, he didn't blame the man however, he had ego and pride to protect, his hate for Harry probably didn't help the situation much either.</p><p>"I know..." He said, and he would've laughed at the irony, if not for the pain in his throat. "It's okay..." He had no idea if it was real or not, maybe he was just hearing himself, but he could've sworn that he felt Snape relax and breathe out a slow, agonizing breath. Harry buried himself in the man, taking in the subtle scent of aftershave and pine, he sat there, lulling himself to unconsciousness with Snape's addictive scent.</p><p>So much for keeping distance.</p>
