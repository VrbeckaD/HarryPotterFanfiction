    <p>The Hogwarts Express was just exactly as she remembered it. The familiar cars, familiar scents, the memories she held here. Like the first day she met her best friend Harry Potter, and unfortunately her ex fiance, Ronald Weasley. Hermione Granger scrunched up her nose at the mere thought of that ginger-haired weasel. </p>
<p>She hated him. She hated Ron with a passion. If only she'd never dated him? If only she never took him back after that fiasco with Lavender Brown. It was in the past, she had to remind herself, as she took a seat in one of the cars and removed her tan coat, laying it on the cushion. She had to somehow get over Ron. So she decided to take up the job offer from the new headmaster of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>The moment she saw the letter, she was excited. She hadn't been to Hogwarts in years, not since the war. She had read the letter, and smiled. Professor McGonagall had offered her to take over for Charms class, since she had been given the new title of Headmistress. </p>
<p>How was Hermione ever to say no?</p>
<p>"Anything from the trolley dear?'' a woman asked as she peeked her head in. She had grown old, with her brown curling hair, graying in some areas. Her skin was marked with soft creases, revealing her age. But her smile was friendly, especially when she recognized the beautiful witch before her. "Hermione Granger? That you?'' the woman asked in a cheerful tone. She let her eyes wander over the woman, she'd grown up beautifully.</p>
<p>Hermione smiled as she greeted the older woman. "Yes ma'am, how are you?'' she asked. She was of course unmistakable to miss. Hermione didn't look too different. She still had her wavy lion's mane of dirty blonde hair, and creamy pale skin. Her cinnamon brown eyes shimmering with excitement as she greeted this lovely woman. "And no thank you, I ate before I got on the train. It's wonderful to see you."</p>
<p>The trolley lady smiled and grabbed a pumpkin pasty from her tray, handing it over to Hermione anyway. "Here dear, on the house. I never thought I'd see a former Gryffindor here, especially not you Ms. Granger" she admitted, watching Hermione take the pastry from her.</p>
<p>Hermione only nodded as she placed the pumpkin pasty in her lap. "I was offered a job at Hogwarts. I couldn't pass it up" she uttered with a smile. "Oh of course not" the trolley lady nodded and took a step back. "Anyway, I best be off, have a wonderful ride, dear" she said her goodbyes to Hermione before heading off to sell her treats to the students on the train.</p>
<p>Hermione watched her leave, and let out a sigh of relief once she had gone. She was only glad there was no mention of Harry or Ron. The lioness rolled her eyes at the mere thought of that redheaded prat. Of course she couldn't get him off her mind so easily, but she could only hope his memory would fade with time apart. She decided instead to focus on her treat, otherwise her train ride to Hogwarts would be a depressing one.</p>
<p>The rest of the train ride was filled with silence. It was unsettling, and depressing. Hermione leaned back into her seat and sighed, staring out the window as nightfall could be seen in the horizon. She adjusted her silk blue blouse, tucked into her black high waisted pants. This was going to be a long week if she didn't get her mind off the past. No matter what she did, her mind seemed to flood back to Ron. And it was making her uncomfortable. Of course it was only natural for her to think of him, after all it had been four months since their break-up.</p>
<p>After the death of his brother Fred, the entire Weasley family was distraught, but not as distraught as Ron had been. Hermione tried and tried to help him, in any way she could, but nothing worked, not even when she asked for Harry and Ginny's help. Ron just couldn't stop destroying himself, and Hermione was tired of watching it. Not only that, Ron had been going around sleeping with other women behind Hermione's back. And that solidified their end.</p>
<p>He decided that drinking and shagging other women, witches and muggles alike, was the only way to get over his grief. But nothing stuck, and nothing changed. Now Hermione was alone, confused, and heartbroken. </p>
<p>Hopefully going back to Hogwarts would help. If not, then she wasn't sure what to do to calm this ache in her chest. Hermione reached up and clutched her chest, as if it would help, though it did not. She drew in a slow, deep breath and closed her eyes, pushing back sobs which only threatened to break free. She'd spent most of this morning sobbing over that idiot! She wouldn't waste anymore time or energy on him..</p>
<p>Thank Merlin the train ride wasn't much longer. Hermione stepped off the train and inhaled the fresh air, smiling as she admired the familiar territory. This was a new beginning. Which meant she had to leave the past behind, and she did. </p>
<p>She hoisted up her luggage and followed a string of first year students to the boats. And after a calming boat ride, they all arrived at the port. Hermione stepped off and made her way towards the main doors, walking into the main hall. Immediately being blasted with nostalgia. Hogwarts hadn't changed much over the past few years. In fact, it seemed exactly the same, with the exception of new teachers, new students and of course, the fallen teachers, and Dumbledore himself. </p>
<p>"Ms. Granger.."</p>
<p>Hermione turned, hearing her name, and a smile plastered on her face as she approached the new headmistress, Minerva McGonagall. "Prof- Headmistress McGonagall" Hermione acknowledged, smiling from ear to ear. "Oh dear, you look wonderful, welcome back.. come with me. I'll show you to your classroom, as well as your living quarters" Minerva McGonagall stated as she smiled at the former Gryffindor student. She gently placed a hand on Hermione's back and led her through the halls, showing her around.</p>
<p>"And this is your classroom, dear" Minerva stated, stepping into a large classroom, filled with desks, and bookshelves flourishing with books. Hermione smiled as she admired the room she'd be working in for the year. "You'll be working with first and second year students, of course it would be best if we get to the grand hall, I must greet the new students, but first, I'll show you to your room, so you may put your luggage away" Minerva suggested, leading Hermione out of the classroom, and down the next hall.</p>
<p>"Not much has changed here" Hermione wondered aloud, looking around at the artwork on the walls, and the awards, and pictures of previous Hogwarts graduates. "Well, you're half right, Ms. Granger" Minerva corrected. "A lot of new experiences are ahead of you this year" she uttered, leading Hermione up a set of stairs, to a cherry wood door. She unlocked it with an old looking key, and pushed it open. </p>
<p>The moment the door opened, the room was flooded with soft lighting. The walls were a soft cream color, and the carpet was intricately decorated with each house crest as well as the school colors. There was a bookshelf, a dresser, beside table, and a closet. Domineering the center of the room was a four poster bed, with a wooden bedframe and blood red comforter, with many pillows. Hermione walked in, admiring her new accommodations as she set her luggage down beside the dresser and turned to Minerva. "This room is beautiful" she announced, voice full of emotion.</p>
<p>"I thought you'd appreciate it" Minerva stated. "It used to be mine." She walked to Hermione and placed the key in her hand. "Don't lose that dear, I think we should get going.. here.." Minerva took out her wand and made a flick of the wrist. Hermione gasped as her outfit had been changed. She now wore black Hogwarts robes over her outfit she'd been wearing. "Come along" Minerva said with a smile, turning and heading downstairs.</p>
<p>Hermione glanced around her new room one last time before following Minerva downstairs. The door closing behind her, locking on its own.</p>
