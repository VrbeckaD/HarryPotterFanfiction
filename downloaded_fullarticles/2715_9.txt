  <em>Excerpt from Relationships Between Wizards and Shinobi </em>
</p>
<p><em>Few know that there is a world other than our own. Hidden from the world that we know exists a land entirely of its own. Its origin is unknown and very little is known about the people who live there. Or their ways. It’s believed that somehow it was once connected to Japan and then split off and isolated. They have a somewhat pre-industrial age society. Except they have what they call </em>Shinobi, <em>the closest word to it in English would be Ninja. </em></p>
<p>
  <em>Excerpt from Classified: Wizards </em>
</p>
<p><em>Wizards have known to be in existence for centuries. They have a type of enhanced chakra which allows for more flexibility. They call it </em>Magic<em>. There is a whole “hidden” society of these Wizards with the majority being civilians. They have units like our own Shinobi who they call </em>Auror’s <em>specializing in attack magic. They are used to help maintain order in their society. </em></p>
<p align="center">ooooooooooooooo</p>
<p>“Albus are you sure this is the right thing to do? You know the Ministry is going to have a heart attack when they find out. And not to mention <em>the parents </em>what are they to think?” The stern woman stared almost accusingly at the Head Master sitting behind his desk.  He sighed and brought his hands together under his chin. He knew this would be the transfiguration teacher’s reaction. Which is why he waited so long to inform her of his plans. He found that he had methods that they didn’t always agree to.</p>
<p>“Yes, Minerva this is the right thing to do, over the years Hogwarts has come under multiple attacks that could’ve been avoided had it not been for the Ministry. I would feel better knowing that Hogwarts is under more protection. The arrangements have already been made.”</p>
<p>He lifted his head glasses flashing. “As for the Ministry, <em>I’ll </em>deal with them should they try and interfere.”</p>

  <em>Two Weeks Earlier </em>
</p>
<p>“Tsunade-sama you have a letter,” Shizune hesitated.</p>
<p>“I don’t recognize anything about it though.” Without lifter hear head from the small mountain of paperwork she replied in a bored tone.</p>
<p>“Has it already been through the intelligence unit?”</p>
<p>“Twice.”</p>
<p>Lifting her head, she frowned. IU was usually able to figure out a problem before sending it to her. Knowing them they probably checked halfheartedly so they could get back to their Shoji. She could’ve growled, <em>those little bastards</em>.</p>
<p>Sticking her hand out for the letter she could tell by a glance downwards that this was going to be a big headache. The cover held what she guessed was symbol with a snake, lion raven and badger wrapped around something she couldn’t recognize. Underneath was a banner with strange markings. Realization hit her, she held up the letter.</p>
<p>“Tell IU I should fire them for not doing their job and go get me an English dictionary. I think it’s time Ii brushed up.”</p>
<p align="center">ooooooooooooooo </p>
<p>Stunned silence met the end of his speech. Looking around he could see the disbelief and confusion that his words caused. Restraining a sigh, he took a swig from his flask as he waited for his words to hit home. Remus was the first to recover.</p>
<p>“So, you’re telling us that Dumbledore hired these Japanese <em>muggles </em>who call themselves shinobi to help protect Harry and the school.”</p>
<p>“That’s absurd” said Arthur his face white, hands flat against the table.</p>
<p>“Some of the most powerful wizards have gone up against You-Know-Who and haven’t survived. How does he think a bunch of <em>muggles </em>is going to do any better?” Moody wanted to growl he told Dumbledore this would be their reaction. They wouldn’t understand how powerful they could really be, they would only hear the non-magical and ignore everything else. Sometimes he wondered if Wizards even knew they discriminated sometimes. Finally, he spoke. </p>
<p>“That’s what makes them so dangerous.” All eyes turned towards him.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Asked Molly quietly confusion etched on her face. It was Tonks who spoke up at the end of the table surprising everybody.</p>
<p>“He means their muggles but they’re far from weak. They have found a way to naturally increase ability’s such as speed, strength, hearing and even eyesight. They also have the element of surprise on their side since they’re always being underestimated as muggles. Their existence is kept almost entirely hushed up. We barely know anything about their world.”</p>
<p>Everybody stared and she shrugged looking slightly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“It’s part of our Auror training to know this.”</p>
<p>Moody nodded “like I told you these guards are very capable of doing their job. I should know I fought alongside a couple of them back in the day. They’re a little sketchy but their loyal.”</p>
<p>This caught Sirius’s attention “what are they like?” At this he hesitated he wasn’t sure how much to tell them. If they didn’t like that they were muggles they weren’t going to like this next piece of information.</p>
<p>“There is no good way to describe them. Each one is different in their own way. The best I can say is that their dangerous and not to be underestimated.” The table was quiet as they mulled over the thought of these strange people coming from a probably even stranger land. One that almost nobody knew about. Molly heaved a sigh, already sounding exhausted with the situation.</p>
<p>“I guess I should start getting ready for them. Do we know when they’re going to be here?”</p>
<p>“That hasn’t been made clear to me yet, you can probably expect them in the next couple of weeks.”</p>
<p>“So soon.” Remus commented. He took a deep breath smiled and pulled himself from the table.</p>
<p>“Well that’s as good as a period were going to get so need worrying until they get here.” He cocked his head thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“Whoever they are.”</p>
<p align="center">ooooooooooooooo</p>
<p>Tsunade sat the translated letter flat on her desk and leaned wearily back in her chair. The request itself wasn’t unusual, the village got plenty of request asking for protection missions. Some even <em>longer</em> than the year he had asked for. What was so unusual about it was the <em>people </em>requesting the job.  Request haven’t come from them since<em>…since the 2<sup>nd</sup> shinobi war. </em></p>
<p>She took a deep steadying breath. Even though it came under the guise of a normal mission it isn’t a normal mission. By accepting this she would be opening a whole bottle of new challenges. Challenges that the still rebuilding Leaf village maybe wouldn’t be able to handle. She couldn’t treat this request like others. She hated to even think it but she would need the councils input on this.</p>
<p>“Shizune” she sighed. She seemed to be doing that a lot now.</p>
<p>“Call the council immediately and tell them to meet in the meeting room.”</p>
<p>She nodded and bowed out the room with Tonton in tow scurrying after her fast clicking heels.</p>
<p align="center">ooooooooooooooo</p>
<p>Shizune hurried down the hall. She knew if Tsunade called the council to a meeting then it must be important. Along with the fact she didn’t call the ANBU to go fetch them as usual means she wants as few people to know as possible. Reaching a well-worn but cared for brown door she knocked. During this time of day, they liked to play shogi and talk in the lounge reserved just for them.</p>
<p>“Enter.”</p>
<p>Pushing it opened she bowed respectfully to her elders.</p>
<p>“The Hokage has called for the council to come to the meeting room. She said its urgent.”</p>
<p>Koharu looked up slightly surprised “tell the Fifth we will be their momentarily.”</p>
<p>Homuru Mitokado also nodded his agreement. They knew if the fifth willing summoned them the issue must be important. Shizue nodded her understanding then bowed out of the room Tonton on her heels.</p>
