  <p>I'm the girl who can stand to see you frown,</p>
  <p>Who'll bring treats just to see a smile</p>
  <p>The girl who wishes you goodnight,</p>
  <p>Hoping it makes you as happy as your replies make me</p>
  <p>The girl who just hopes you'll kiss her,</p>
  <p>But stands aside for the others you seem to prefer</p>
  <p>I'm the girl who promised myself not to fall for you, or anyone</p>
  <p>Whose putting her heart on her sleeve, for you.</p>
