  <span>“Why don’t I know you?” Draco asked Harry when he called Harry to sit down at their lunch table.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Um, ‘cause I’m new. I just moved here from aFRICA!” Harry said, being sassy as always.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I used to live in Africa, but now I live here, like it’s pretty simple.” Harry said, being completely normal.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So you’ve actually never been to a real school before?” Draco said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No..”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Shut up,” Draco began.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“‘Scuse me? Boy, who you talking to?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Shut up!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Boi, I ain’t even talking! You need to be quiet, close your mouth!” Harry said, annoyed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But, you’re like really handsome.” Draco added.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Boy, you don’t need to lie; I’m over here looking like a whole double-decker biscuit.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You think you’re really handsome?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Draco, I just called myself a double-decker biscuit, what d’you mean, ‘do I agree?’ Boy, no I don’t!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco rolled his eyes. “I love your bracelet.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry looked down at his arm. “What- bracelet?! Are you- what?!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So fetch!” Blaise spoke up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What did the little one just say?” Harry chuckled.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, it’s like slang..” Everyone looked at him. “From.. England..”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Have you ever been to England?” Harry asked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So,” The third person at the table; Gregory Goyle, Harry thought, said, “If you’re from Africa, why are you white?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Boy, you- uhm- oh god…” Harry looked over to where his new friends, Ron and Hermione, were sitting. “All up in my business,” Harry sighed. “I swear, they called me over here!” He insisted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The trio of boys turned back to Harry. “We want to invite you to have lunch with us, every day, for the rest of the week.” Blaise said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m good!” Harry insisted. “I-I really don’t want to!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, we’ll see you tomorrow!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, no you won’t! All you’ll be seeing is some disappointment, ‘cause I ain’t showing up </span>
  <em>
    <span>nowhere</span>
  </em>
  <span>!”</span>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  <span>“Draco, we need to talk to you,” Blaise said, as Goyle and himself sat down at their table.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, this is going to be good! Lemme get my teacup ready,” Goyle rolled his eyes at Harry, who was interested in how this would go.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I.. Is butter a carb?” Draco asked Harry.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, yes it is, Draco.” Harry turned away and mumbled. “So stupid.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Draco, you’re wearing sweatpants. It’s Monday.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hahah, Draco! Ohoho!” Harry giggled.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“..So?” Draco asked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So that’s against the rules, and you can’t sit with us.” Gregory concluded.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hehehehe! Bye bye now Draco!” Harry laughed even more.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Whatever! Those rules aren’t real.” Draco said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“They were real that day I wore a jacket!” Gregory said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“‘Cause that jacket was disgusting!” Draco sneered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Damn Draco, you is so rude! Those sweatpants are disgusting too!” Draco looked personally offended by that.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“YOU CAN’T SIT WITH US!” Blaise exclaimed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hehehe, SCORE!” Harry said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sweatpants are all that fits me right now..”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>You sad, hippo-looking fool. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Harry thought with disgust.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco bore his eyes into the side of Harry’s head and Harry absolutely flipped out. “Draco, don’t look at me like that! I see those Doritos and that cupcake right there, if you’re worried about your weight you need to put it down!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Fine,” Draco stood. “You can walk home, all of you.” Draco left, bumping into someone while walking out.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>______________________________________</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Good job, Africa,” A girl said backstage to Harry and walked away.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You totally have a crush on that girl,” Blaise said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Boy, no I don’t!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That is so, fetch!” He exclaimed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Blaise,” Draco spoke up. “Stop trying to make ‘fetch’ happen! It’s not going to happen!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Snatched!” Harry yelled. “DRAG HIM!”</span>
</p>
<p>

<p>
  <span>“Why should Caesar get to stomp around, like a giant, while the rest of us </span>
  <em>
    <span>try not to</span>
  </em>
  <span> get smushed under his big feet!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Ooh, he is aaangry…</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“When did it become okay for one person to be the boss of everybody, huh-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry took a sip from his water bottle.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Because that’s not what Rome is about! We should totally just stab CAESAR!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry finished taking a sip from his water bottle.</span>
</p>
<p>

<p>
  <span>“You know, she cheats on Aaron-” Blaise began</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Cheating on Aaron, yes continue on that boy, I’m trying to get my receipt!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, every Thursday, she thinks he has SAT Prep but really, she’s hooking up with Ginny Weasley-” He kept ranting.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ginny Weasley..”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“-in the projection room above the auditorium!” Blaise finished.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How do you spell that? Is it W-e-a-s-l-e-y? Auditorium Room, okay </span>
  <em>
    <span>tHAnk yoU.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I never told anybody that because.. I am.. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Such</span>
  </em>
  <span>.. a good friend.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>_______________________________________</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I have this… friend, who is a new student this year..</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh </span>
  <em>
    <span>heeey!</span>
  </em>
  <span> That’s me! Hey Hermione!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We thought it would be fun to mess up Draco Malfoy’s life.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>I know she is not finna exPOSE my arse! No ma’am I will drag you all the way to hELL</span>
  </em>
  <span>!</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco looked interested in this. “I made him pretend to be Draco’s friend and he would come over to my house and laugh about all the dumb stuff Draco said.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>OH no, oh no, oH NO.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Harry? You know my friend Harry.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“ME!?” </span>
  <em>
    <span>Oh no..</span>
  </em>
  <span> “Ooh, not me guys, look at the pretty </span>
  <em>
    <span>sunset!</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He made out with Draco’s girlfriend and convinced her to break up with him!” Everyone gasped, either shock or gratitude that Draco was being taken down a notch.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry snorted. “ThaT i dId dO. ThAt, I dId dO tHAt, thAT’s mY bAd, yOU knOw, shE wAS a NicE kiSSeR DraCo! I snATCheD yOUr giRl uP anD I sAid, “bReaK uP wiTh thAT arse!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco looked at Harry with pure fury in his eyes. “Oooohoohoho, you are looking </span>
  <em>
    <span>angrryyy</span>
  </em>
  <span>, honey. You’re just looking so mAD! HAHA!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>______________________________________</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“NO!” Draco screeched.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh my god, you’s sounding like those monkeys I trained in Africa, you need to close your mouth!” Harry retorted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you know what everyone says about YOU?!” Harry shrugged. “They say you’re a homeschooled jungle freak who is a less hot version, of ME!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Boy, I’m looking at that two-set wig you got on there and I can already tell you are as cheap as ever, do not call me the less-hot version of you. You’s looking like a beat-up Ken doll, don’t talk to me like that-” Harry was just interrupted for the first time in his life.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah! So don’t try to act so </span>
  <em>
    <span>innocent</span>
  </em>
  <span>! You can take that fake apology, and shove it right up your hairy-AAH!” Draco was just then hit by a bus, which tells you never to interrupt Harry James Potter.. Ever.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“OH! HE juST GOT SNATCHED! SCORE!”</span>
