    <p>Hermione had had her newest dress, matching hair ribbon and backpack ready the week before. And she’d finished reading all her textbooks a week before that. She brushed her hair until her eyes watered and she polished her Mary Janes to a shine. </p><p>She remained awake long into the night, thinking of what the morning would bring: her first day in her new school, new things to learn, and maybe –and this she held in the deepest part of her heart– the chance to make new friends.</p><p>They were whispering about her by the first period, calling her names by the second. At play time, they pulled her hair and pushed her to the ground.<br/>
At the end of the school day, when the other kids headed in groups and couples in the direction of the nice nearby suburban where her home stood, Hermione turned alone on the opposite way. She trekked past the bony trees with the plastic bags stuck in their branches, and picked up her pace when she reached the dark bricked homes. </p><p>He came running towards her the moment she entered the playground, his dark hair and big coat whipping around and behind his scrawny body. </p><p>Hermione took one look at the dear sallow face, and she sobbed. </p><p>***</p><p>Her family had moved to the new housing project on the upside of Cokeworth the summer before.  And Hermione, avoiding certain girls and their exclusive tea parties, had left their green park with the shiny slides  and walked all the way to the old communal playground on the other side of town. </p><p>From there, they were trussed up together by nothing but their respective natures. </p><p>Hermione had walked to a gnarled tree on the far corner, and made herself comfortable against its trunk. The other kids’ cries and shouts sounding far away, she soon forgot herself in the book open on her knees. She was sitting by the firelight, a big furry dog at her feet, while she studied the shadowy profile of her mysterious and broody master. </p><p>A few feet away a small boy with greasy long hair and mismatched clothes had tensed when he first saw a girl coming close. But left unperturbed, he’d relaxed and returned to his beer bottles and tin cans, stirring a greenish mixture with a Popsicle stick. In his own corner of the debilitated park, Severus was the greatest potions master of all time.</p><p>Hermione didn’t think much of it when the strange kid moved a bit closer to her spot after a few days. And when one day she turned and found him reading over her shoulder from the book in her lap, she shrugged and hefted the book higher on her knees.</p><p>They’d commiserated over having odd names that the other kids could never manage to pronounce right, and they’d bonded over books. After a week, Hermione was chattering to any who would hear about her new friend, and Severus was besotted. </p><p>***</p><p>Hermione had buried her face in the bony chest of her friend, and as such she didn’t see his hands fluttering anxiously over her back or the panicky look in his eyes.</p><p>“Are you hurt? Are you bleeding somewhere?”</p><p>She shook her head and buried her nose deeper in his sweater. It had little holes in it, and smelled of the musty odor of clothes kept in a closet for a long time. But underneath it all was the familiar scent of Severus and it calmed her. </p><p>His hands finally settled on her shoulders, and he pushed her gently back. “Hermione, did someone hurt you?”</p><p>“No— not really.” She was unsettled somewhat by the odd look in his eyes. They were darker…colder; it was like a different person was staring at her from the face of her friend. “The kids at school…they were horrible but they didn’t hurt me.”</p><p>The stranger left and Severus was back, smoothing his hands over her shoulders and arms in a twitchy way. “Alright,” he said. “Tell me all about it.” 

And so she did.</p><p>“You shouldn’t listen to them, you know; they’re just jealous,” Severus said after she finally stopped crying and sniffling all over.</p><p>“But it’s all true. My hair is awful, and my front teeth are too big—“</p><p>“Don’t be stupid.” She huffed but he paid her no mind. “We’re kids; we’re supposed to have large parts to grow into.” Hermione sniffed and looked away, entirely not convinced.</p><p>“And you’re brave and kind and the smartest person I know. And that’s the best kind of pretty there is,” Severus said. “Plus, I like you hair.” Then he pulled on one of her crazy curls. “It bounces,” he added with an awed expression, eyes still riveted on the corkscrew strand. </p><p>Hermione really couldn’t help it; she stood on her knees and smacked a kiss on his cheek. </p><p>When she pulled back Severus’ eyes were large and his mouth was slightly agape. It was worse than the first time she’d held his hand; then, he’d flinched, but soon tightened his fingers around hers when she was about to pull away. Severus didn’t reach for her this time, and Hermione berated herself the rest of the day for being a foolish little girl.</p><p>***</p><p>The next day, Severus met her at their usual spot with a little quirk of his lips, and she knew that things would be alright again. They still held hands and Severus would sit plastered to her side while they read together, but she dare not kiss him again, even if she’d wanted to multiple times.</p><p>A few weeks afterwards and as they sat together on the bank of the dirty river that passed through the town, she asked him what he would want for his birthday. Severus frowned –a not unusual expression for him, she quickly came to know- and looked down at his hands as they tore a clamp of grass to tiny little bits. Hermione hugged her legs to her chest and rested her head on her knees, waiting for him in silence. 

</p><p>“A kiss.”</p><p>Hermione’s head snapped up. </p><p>As far as she was concerned, everyone should be kissed at least once when they woke up and before they went to sleep and get as many hugs in between. No one should have to ask for a kiss, and definitely not for their birthday. </p><p>Hermione threw her arms around the tiny shoulders of her unsuspecting companion and gathered him close and tight. They’d already breached this territory at the start of their friendship, and as such Severus hugged her tentatively but readily back. But just as they both pulled back, she landed a swift kiss on his lips. </p><p>It was the best type of kisses, she knew; the one that said I love you, and I care about you and you’re my favorite person in the whole world. And looking down at her friend, with his too large coat and funny smelling sweater, a blush tinting the tips of his ears, Hermione meant that kiss with all her little heart.</p>
