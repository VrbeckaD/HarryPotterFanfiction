  <b>March 1978: Seventh Year</b>
</p><p>At 8:30 am on March 30th, 1978, James H. Potter realized, for the first time—roughly two and a half months before he would leave the corridors of Hogwarts, meet his destiny, and continue onward into the halls of infinity and glory—that he <em>could not fucking wait</em> to live alone.</p><p>He realized this, of course, because the first sensation he experienced while regaining consciousness was the taste of Sirius O. Black's dirty sock.</p><p>He spat it out and yelled at Padfoot, who bounded out of Remus's bed and pounced on him, barking. Then Remus woke up and snarled at them both, which shut them up until Peter woke up with a sock over his own nose and threw it into the fray, and that started the whole thing over again, and they were late for breakfast.</p><p>At the time, James didn't think much of Padfoot being in Remus's bed. It wasn't the first or the last time it happened; Sirius and Remus both had insomnia trouble, and sometimes the only way for Sirius to go to sleep was to turn into Padfoot. Being an animal relaxed the mind in some ways, especially if you were safe and warm. Plus, sometimes the only way for Remus to go to sleep was for 70 pounds of dog to flop across his legs and refuse to move.</p><p>This was all well and good, but Padfoot whined in his sleep sometimes, Peter was small but his snore was mighty, and Remus would toss and turn constantly with or without a dog in his bed (Padfoot slept like the dead, occasional whines and huffs of breath aside, and never seemed to mind or notice).</p><p>So really, this realization had been a long time coming. And over the next few months, it was all James could think about.</p><p>He wasn't moving out of the house right away. The plan was to enjoy his summer a bit while maybe serving an ice cream cone or two at Fortescue's (his parents were insistent that he Get A Job, and had been for the last three summers), and while <em>definitely</em> begging Dumbledore to let him do more for the Order. Then he'd find a flat, and a proper job, and try to work up the nerve to ask Lily to move in with him.</p><p>Which meant he wouldn't live alone for very long, exactly, but Lily Evans would be an entirely different roommate from the dirty underwear and faint dog smell of one Sirius Black.</p><p>James was thinking about this in a Transfiguration class that McGongall swore was vital for their NEWT's, but that James had mastered ages ago, so he allowed himself to daydream just a bit about waking up to red hair and softness instead of dirty socks.</p><p>That was about when he got slapped in the face with a fish.</p><p>This was not turning out to be a good day for his face.</p><p>When he turned to look at who had inflicted this injustice upon him, he was met with Lily Evan's devilish grin.</p><p>"Back to work, Potter," she said to him, and turned away. James sighed, wondering why he only loved people who were cruel to him.</p><p>She really was the best.</p><p>Her radiant beauty and wicked smile did nothing to combat the smell of fish, but while he had been daydreaming the lesson hadn't gotten any more interesting. So with a bit of a sigh, he went back to fantasizing about walking around entirely in the nude without anyone complaining loudly about it or cracking jokes about it.</p><p>Not to mention peeing with the door to the loo wide open.</p><p>Graduation couldn't come soon enough.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Sirius was distracted, but not in the normal ways of drifting off during class thinking about Quidditch or flying or the latest book he was reading or turning into a dog and running along the ground with his tongue hanging out. He wasn't even spending way too long staring at Remus Lupin's eyelashes, or tracking micro facial expressions to see if Moony really was focusing on his note-taking or if he could and should be derailed from all homework-related toils.</p><p>He wasn't thinking about any of those things because, in fact, he was laughing into Remus's neck and Remus was nudging him into another kiss that turned his knees to jelly. Which didn't turn out to be a problem, because Remus was already falling backwards on the bed and taking Sirius with him and Sirius was so, so happy. When Remus's gaze traveled over him, considering and thoughtful, the heat that bloomed in his stomach was all his. When Remus took a little long and Sirius whined in impatience, Remus's laugh was all his, too.</p><p>The only problem was that all this could only happen in a room they shared with two other people, that either of them could walk into at any time.</p><p>And so the part of Sirius that was always on alert, the part that turned into a dog and ran through the woods at midnight, that was always listening for <em>intruder intruder intruder</em>, was at its highest setting. At all times. Because Merlin forbid he kiss his boyfriend senseless without thinking of everything that could go wrong.</p><p>A thump from the hallway made them both freeze, then relax only slightly when no one entered the room.</p><p>Sirius looked back down at Remus, and smiled apologetically. "Hard not to be paranoid, yeah?"</p><p>Remus snorted. He had a lazy, amused look on his face that Sirius loved even more than leather jackets and flying. "That's an understatement."</p><p>Sirius knew his expression had to be disgustingly smitten, but he didn't care. He touched the laugh lines around Remus's eyes, just once, fondly.</p><p>Remus squinted at him, and so, to make sure he knew Sirius meant it, Sirius leaned in again, slowly this time.</p><p>When they broke apart, Sirius meant to keep going, but Remus stopped him. "Sorry, I thought I heard—ah, never mind."</p><p>"Stupid werewolf senses," said Sirius. "Can't be relied on at all."</p><p>"Mm," said Remus. "If only I didn't have to use them so much."</p><p>"Graduation's coming," said Sirius. "We'll be free of it then. No more shared rooms, no more Potter dirty underwear..."</p><p>"You think he'll stop leaving it everywhere?"</p><p>"Who cares?" said Sirius. "I won't be there to trip on it, what does it matter?"</p><p>There was a long, confused pause. "What?" said Remus.</p><p>"What?" said Sirius.</p><p>Remus pulled back a bit, which Sirius did not like at <em>all</em>. "You're...not planning to stay with James after graduation?"</p><p>"I mean, yeah, a bit, right when we leave, but after that I'm not sharing a flat with him or anything. You know he complains a blue streak about Peter's snoring but snores twice as loud, why would I want that in my life forever?"</p><p>The look in Remus's eye shifted from confusion to mischief. "Are you telling me you two aren't physically fused at the hip after all? Praise the heavens, I thought I'd eventually have to drag you into St. Mungo's for detachment."</p><p>"Please," Sirius snorted. "Just think of all the things I do without him around. <em>You</em> know," he added, smiling in a slow way that made Remus's smile widen into a grin.</p><p>They leaned into each other in the same instant, Remus by sliding his hands around the aforementioned hips and pulling Sirius closer, and Sirius by claiming his waiting mouth.</p><p>It was a few minutes before Remus said anything else, before Sirius's mouth started to travel elsewhere and he <em>could</em> speak.</p><p>"I just—before you—<em>fuck</em>, Sirius—"</p><p>Sirius paused for what he intended to be a fraction of a section, to grin suggestively at Remus and put whatever ridiculous thing he wanted to say out of his head at least until they were done here, but apparently Moony had iron self-control, because that was enough time.</p><p>"Does <em>James</em> know you don't want to live with him?"</p><p>Sirius stopped, but only briefly. "Not sure," he said finally. There wasn't much that was more important than the way Remus was looking at him, even though he was a dastardly mood-killer. "Worry about it later?"</p><p>And thank Merlin Remus wasn't as unflappable as he pretended to be, because he said "Yes" immediately, and that was the end of conversation for a while.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>It was Lily's fault that James realized he hadn't actually shared his post-graduation plans with Sirius.</p><p>They hadn't even really been discussing Sirius. In fact, the conversation had started at breakfast, which they both came down to early for a few minutes alone before their respective groups of rowdy friends got there.</p><p>(When James left the dormitory that morning, Peter was snoring like an avalanche, Sirius wasn't in his bed, and Remus had his curtains spelled shut. He didn't know why—it wasn't like he didn't know the faint whuffling sound wasn't from dog-Sirius—but he was also relieved to have an excuse to leave without waking them up handy.)</p><p>They hadn't spoken at first. They'd settled into a ritual; no words were necessary until after Lily, bleary-eyed, had finished her tea, and James had finished his usual morning ritual of dejectedly picking through all the food on the table before settling on toast and eggs again, and wishing he hadn't failed multiple times to convince the House Elves to at least make chutney to make the damn things edible. He understood that something like idli was right out—he really did. Even his mum only made it on weekends. But seven years of Hogwarts later and it still didn't feel right to not eat his dad's freshly-made poori for every other meal.</p><p>The jam was always good, though. It made toast worth putting up with. He sighed, once again accepting that white people rubbish could be tolerated for another day.</p><p>Lily smiled at him over her mug. "One day you'll have to tell me what that expression means," she said. "It mostly comes out around food, but not always."</p><p>James grinned back, slowly, a bit surprised that his face muscles could even make that shape this early in the morning. "You've been <em>studying</em> me," he said.</p><p>Her blush was light, just a flush of pink on the tops of her cheeks, but it was still better than the sunrise. "Well, yes," she said. "I spend quite a lot of time with you, you know. And you're not truly horrible to be around."</p><p>James fought to keep from gloating at this admission, but the look on his face must have given him away, because Lily swatted him with the newspaper that had been sitting nearby, before laughing. "You <em>like</em> me," he said.</p><p>"Obviously," said Lily, smiling back. She sat the newspaper down, and they both glanced briefly at the headline—another scary editorial about Muggles and Muggleborns—before looking up, meeting each other's eyes, and silently deciding not to even look at it today.</p><p>They needed a break.</p><p>"How embarrassing for you," James said, and if it wasn't as lighthearted as before, Lily pretended not to notice.</p><p>"Not really," she said, nudging his foot with hers. It was his turn to blush.</p><p>Before he could grin and put his chin on his hands and ask her to tell him everything she liked about him, she added, "But don't change the subject, Potter. What's that look about? Hogwarts breakfast not good enough for you?"</p><p>James sighed. "No," he said. "Or, well. It's fine, but don't you ever get bored? Eating English food every day?"</p><p>"As opposed to—oh. Right. Your parents cook?"</p><p>"Well, yes, but not just that, there's restaurants and—" He stopped, realizing that in his almost subconscious effort to make the sentiment more white-people palatable, he'd skimmed over the worst cultural difference he'd ever even considered. "Wait, really? You eat British <em>every day</em> at home? I thought that was just boring dry families like Sirius's! Muggles never try anything new either?"</p><p>Lily's eyebrows went up. "I imagine it's different for different Muggles," she said, too-calmly.</p><p>James flinched. "Sorry," he said. "But, really—don't you get bored?"</p><p>"It depends on what you're used to, I suppose," said Lily. "My mum is a rubbish cook. Coming here was a lot of finding out what roast chicken and potatoes are <em>supposed</em> to taste like."</p><p>James laughed. "Did you ever learn how to cook? Or are you doomed to burn water forever?"</p><p>"I guess I always thought I'd figure it out," said Lily. She looked a bit startled, for some reason. "Wow, I—never really thought about it. I'm going to have to in a few months, aren't I?"</p><p>"I'll teach you," James said immediately. "You'll get world's finest second-hand education in my dad's baking and the ridiculous things my mum can do to lentils."</p><p>"Really? They taught you how to cook?"</p><p>James shrugged. He hadn't been interested, growing up, but after a year in Hogwarts with only Nagaraj Patil, a 5th year Ravenclaw, with a face that looked anything like his—yeah, he'd learned to cook. It had been important, all of a sudden, in a way it never had been before. He'd grown up knowing every other Indian in a 50-kilometer radius, it seemed, but they were all younger or older or being sent to school elsewhere and not at Hogwarts.</p><p>But it wasn't a conversation for this early in the morning. "They did. Sirius can tell you about my first few attempts—it'll be a pain, cooking for myself, but at least I won't have his ungrateful arse lounging around complaining about the smell getting in his hair."</p><p>Lily tilted her head, bird-like. "You won't?"</p><p>"What?" said James.</p><p>"What?" said Lily.</p><p>They stared at each other for a minute, before Lily shook her head as if to clear it. "I mean," she said. "You and Sirius aren't going to move in together?"</p><p>This was much, much sooner than he would have preferred to have this conversation.</p><p>On the other hand...</p><p>James shrugged, trying his damnedest to look nonchalant. "Maybe at first," he said. "You know, when he comes home with me. But after that...no, I think I'd rather leave an empty space in whatever apartment I move into. For. Someone else. Maybe."</p><p>Lily, not seeming to notice that James had just laid his heart on the table so she could eat it raw and then smash it into a million pieces if that was her whim, frowned thoughtfully. "Right, right—but."</p><p>"But...?" James was going to suffocate and die from anticipation, it was going to kill him, this was the end. He always knew Lily Evans would be the death of him.</p><p>"Does <em>he</em> know that?"</p><p>"What? What do you mean, of course he—we—" James stopped. "Um. It should be obvious?"</p><p>"Right, but he's never lived alone, you know," said Lily. "It's worth at least checking to make sure he's okay with—wait. Wait. <em>James</em>."</p><p>"What?" said James. Oh god, was he in trouble?"</p><p>"Have you talked to him about it at <em>all</em>?"</p><p>"Er—no?"</p><p>"Oh my god," said Lily, for some reason. "Have <em>conversations</em> with your best friend before you ask me to move in with you, how is this so difficult?" She trailed off, muttering angrily about <em>boys</em> and <em>impossible</em>, before her friends finally showed up for breakfast and Alice Prewett sat down across from him, eyeballing him and asking "What did you do this time, James" while James frantically tried to work out exactly what he had done, whether that was a yes or a no, and wait shit Lily was probably right, Sirius probably <em>didn't</em> know—</p><p>At which point he frantically excused himself from the table to go have a mental breakdown in the loo, because really this was too much for one man to process all at once, and also, it was quiet there, plus, he needed to pee. With the door closed. Like some kind of <em>animal</em>.</p><p>Multi-tasking. A Potter specialty. He could panic about five things at once <em>and</em> take care of important business!</p><p>Oh god, what <em>was</em> he going to do?<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>They spent an entire day giving each other awkward looks in class, too-loudly asking to pass the butter, and accidentally bumping into each other, before James realized that weeks of awkwardness and dancing around the topic was actually a bullshit way to spend the last few weeks of their last term at Hogwarts. Anyway, that wasn't really the Padfoot and Prongs way, especially when Remus wasn't involved.</p><p>James realized this, of course, <em>just before</em> Sirius did, but didn't have a chance to act on it. Obviously. Which was why Sirius cornered him first, in the Common Room, at the dead of night (what they were both doing there on a weeknight was best left to the annals of history), moonlight from the half-moon streaming in a single silvery shaft through a gap in the curtains, and growled "<em>Potter</em>. We need to talk."</p><p>James had taken a solid five and a half minutes to jump entirely out of his skin (and the Invisibility Cloak), steady his breathing, and light the damn fireplace so at least the lighting would be less needlessly dramatic—or more appropriate for midnight scheming, anyway. And definitely <em>less</em> appropriate for midnight murders most foul.</p><p>"What is this about?" He said, voice low. Not a whisper—whispers carried. They were Marauders, and knew better.</p><p>"Your mission," said Sirius, "is to talk loudly and in the hearing of anybody listening about how much you <em>cannot bloody wait</em> to graduate this school and live alone. No matter how much it pains you. Understand?"</p><p>"No," said James. "And anyway, I've decided that's not a good strategy, if I want Lily to move in with me I'd better just ask outright and see what she says."</p><p>Sirius rolled his eyes. "James, come on, I know it's hard but—wait. Wait, what?"</p><p>"What? Which part? Me wanting to move in with Lily? I thought that was obvious. Oh, actually, can <em>you</em> talk really loudly about how <em>you</em> want to live alone? That'll convince her that you're not broken up about it, even if you are, which would be fine, except, you know, we both have to grow up—"</p><p>"<em>I</em> can't do that, that'll make Remus think that I don't—" Sirius stopped abruptly. "Um."</p><p>"You want to move in with Remus?" said James. "That's good, except you know he'll never accept, he doesn't like anyone trying to take care of hiiiiiiiii—wait a minute." Something about Sirius's guilty expression and inability to meet James's eyes finally sunk in. "Wait. Wait. Wait wait wait. <em>You</em> want to move in with Remus the way <em>I</em> want to move in with Lily!"</p><p>"What!" said Sirius. "James, I don't—" he stopped. "Don't say that so loudly," he finished, at a mumble.</p><p>James gaped in complete dignity and not at all like a fish, for a few seconds, before recovering as best he could. "Padfoot," he said very seriously, putting a hand on his best friend's shoulder. "Do not worry, my dearest and most cherished friend—"</p><p>"I'm now more worried than I've ever been in my life," said Sirius.</p><p>"—because I am <em>here for you</em>. Do you need to talk? Do you need a mentor? Because it's 90% because of me that Marlene and Dorcas are finally going out, you can ask anyone—well, 70%. Well, 50%. If you ask Lily, anyway. But the point is, I can ask one of them to—"</p><p>"<em>No</em>," said Sirius. "I don't need any of that, I need to convince Remus you're not going to collapse with loneliness if you and I aren't living in each other's pockets next year."</p><p>James brightened. "Do you think we could use a Shrinking Spell to get ourselves a Pocket Slytherin?"</p><p>"Doesn't work on humans," said Sirius promptly. "A Potion, <em>maybe</em>. And—"</p><p>"There's no time for that," they said together.</p><p>"Damn," said James. "We really need another year here, don't we?"</p><p>"Merlin, no," said Sirius. "Seven years of not being able to hex Slytherins because they're Prefects and are allowed to take points away from First Years in their own House for 'having Muggle teeth' is seven years too many. I need to get <em>out</em>."</p><p>"Someone did that?" said James.</p><p>"Bellatrix," said Sirius grimly.</p><p>"Guess they got off easy, then."</p><p>"Yeah, especially since they don't go here anymore."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"They dropped out," said Sirius. "The First Year in question and her three Muggle-born friends. Transferred to Beauxbatons."</p><p>"They'd rather be with the <em>French</em> than at <em>Hogwarts</em>?" said James, scandalized.</p><p>"<em>And</em> one of the girls is Muslim," said Sirius.</p><p>"Didn't Beauxbatons try to ban headscarves last year?"</p><p>"They're still trying."</p><p>They were both silent. James didn't know what Sirius was thinking about, but he—he was thinking about a sea of pale faces, staring at an eleven-year-old girl with a dark face and covered hair who transferred to their school in the middle of their year, who struggled to keep up with a brand new language let alone a new curriculum, who didn't even belong in the place that was made for her.</p><p>What food would she desperately miss from home? What would she accidentally eat because the names of the food dishes were all different and in French? James could avoid beef at Hogwarts if he put his mind to it, not that he was ever that careful unless he was rubbing it in the nose of a particularly aristocratic Slytherin, because <em>honestly,</em> but at least he knew <em>how</em>, and—</p><p>Would anyone be around to guide her, show her the way around? Would her new Prefect succeed where her Hogwarts Head Boy had failed?</p><p>"Fuck this," James said, finally. "You're right, Pads, I can't take this anymore. I want to <em>fight</em>."</p><p>"Yeah," said Sirius.</p><p>There was another pause, in which they both stared into the fire. On any other night, it would have been mesmerizing, soothing, enough to put him slowly to sleep.</p><p>Tonight, the cliff of the future was dropping sharply at his feet; he had no choice but to step over it, and the warmth did nothing to cut the chill in his bones. He did not see peace in the flames.</p><p>"Does anyone know besides me?" James said into the silence. It was a subject change, but he had never been great at staying on topic—and he'd never bothered to learn, because Sirius had always been good at following his train of thought.</p><p>"Well," said Sirius. "Remus does." When James shot him a look, he shrugged. "Andromeda. Maggie Carter. Er. One or two blokes in this school know about me specifically, but will deny to their dying breath how they found out."</p><p>James squinted at him a bit. "Andromeda? She had a girlfriend before Ted, yeah? And is Maggie still dating Abbie Martin? They were a blast together, when they weren't terrorizing innocent future Head Boys."</p><p>"She is," said Sirius. "Last I heard they were in New York, doing...something for Dumbledore. I think they're, you know. Keeping an eye on the government there. You know what Maggie is like."</p><p>James did. They didn't need to say the word <em>spy</em> out loud to picture Maggie running rings around the whole of New York City's magical community.</p><p>"But how'd you find out about all that?" Sirius's expression was more troubled than James would like, and he wasn't sure why. "I thought they kept those secrets pretty well."</p><p>"Andromeda and Hestia, or Maggie and Abbie?"</p><p>"Both, actually," said Sirius.</p><p>"Hestia and Andromeda had me distract Peeves once, so they could duck into that secret room on the third floor," said James. "They didn't really hide what they wanted to do in there."</p><p>Sirius apparently couldn't help a smirk. "Why do all the girls in this school except Lily trust you with all their secrets?"</p><p>"Andromeda just knows she can bully me," James said, without heat. He didn't exactly mind. Competent, terrifying women were kind of his whole thing, and not only in a dating sense; they were just delightful to be around. He maybe wanted to grow up to be just like them someday, and he was now man enough to admit that to himself. "And hey! Lily likes me now! For real!"</p><p>"I've noticed," said Sirius.</p><p>"And not <em>all</em> of them like me. I thought Maggie was going to murder me and hide the body—you remember the prank we played that year, with the Filch's Cat Menagerie?"</p><p>It was a rhetorical question. Of course Sirius remembered. No one at Hogwarts that year would ever forget Lady Norris being turned into a variety of animals, up to and including a moose and a hippopotamus (they did not learn from the moose incident). All the Marauders had gotten top marks in Transfiguration, and Remus would deny for the rest of his life that the menagerie had anything to do with it.</p><p>James knew better. McGonagall knew good work when she saw it.</p><p>Sirius snickered. "Obviously."</p><p>"Well, the reason I was covered in green spots for a week after the platypus was that while we were split up looking for Lady Norris, I, uh. Walked in on them in the Transfiguration classroom."</p><p>"Transfiguration, really? Seems risky." Sirius's shoulders had relaxed a bit.</p><p>James tilted his head a bit. Did Sirius think the tall, dark-haired woman McGonagall was sometimes seen with on campus was really her cousin? Silly, really. But he wasn't about to spill that secret, too. "Couldn't have been that bad, if no one found them. Maggie always was good at risk calculation."</p><p>"Still, you shouldn't have told me."</p><p>"Figured you must've known, if you told them about—well."</p><p>"Right. ...Right. Just don't tell anyone else."</p><p>"I haven't." Because the conversation had gotten too serious (and wasn't nearly Sirius enough), he grinned wickedly. "Yours aren't the only secrets I keep, Padfoot. Just the only ones I'd sell to the highest bidder."</p><p>Sirius kicked him. "Remember the words ‘mutually assured destruction'," he advised. "What are we going to do about this?"</p><p>James didn't need a reminder about what they were talking about. "Just ask him to move in with you? That's what I'm going to do."</p><p>"<em>Bo</em>-ring," said Sirius. "It's like I don't even know you anymore."</p><p>"Lily doesn't respond to elaborate, ridiculous plans. She likes it better when you just ask her," said James, wisely.</p><p>That was when his and Sirius's eyes met, and they had a beautiful, perfect, crystallizing realization.</p><p>"But Remus <em>does</em>," they breathed, at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Because Remus pretended not to be receptive to ridiculous plans (a useless farce, but what could you do), and because Sirius was really, really trying not to go over his head unnecessarily, especially after—certain things that had happened—Sirius cornered him during a free period one day, and said—</p><p>"James wants to live alone, you know."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"He told me, earlier."</p><p>"James hasn't even had his own room since he was eleven," said Remus. "I doubt he even knows what he's getting into."</p><p>Sirius had never been properly alone, ever, and privately thought that James probably had more experience at it than any of them. Even Remus, who pretended to thrive on being alone (another farce), had had parents hovering over him his whole life—unlike the Potters, who could be fairly lax in terms of supervision.</p><p>Peter hated being alone. But Sirius didn't spend much time dwelling on the mind of Peter Pettigrew, especially not recently. He wasn't going to start now, with more important things at hand.</p><p>"He'll ask Lily to move in, if it comes to that," said Sirius. "He told me so."</p><p>"Well he won't be leaving you high and dry," said Remus. "You have enough money from your uncle to get a place, no?"</p><p>Sirius resisted the urge to let out a frustrated huff. "I will," he conceded.</p><p>"There you are, then," said Remus. "You'll get some time to yourself." And then he slid away, out of the Common Room and off to the kitchens or the library or—whatever it was Remus did when he wanted to be left alone, really alone, a concept Sirius still didn't quite understand.</p><p>"But what if I don't want it," Sirius said, to the empty air.</p><p>He'd tried the direct approach, at least. Now to find a way to get Remus to really hear him.</p><p>Well, he didn't yet have a full plan, but he did know that it would involve a lot of reminders of very specific things that he wouldn't hear if Sirius said them in words.</p><p>Starting with the annals of history.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <b>October 1971: First Year</b>
</p><p>Sirius Black had been at Hogwarts for two months, and already he had it all figured out. This was an achievement sure to go down in the annals of history, whatever an "annal" was. It sounded boring and dusty and probably something you had to read, but maybe his adventures would make even the annals interesting.</p><p>Annals. It was a strange word, wasn't it? Annals. Sirius turned it over in his mind, grinning. Aaaaannnals.</p><p>Weird. Boring, but weird. Actually, being weird made it less boring.</p><p>Just like the person he'd learned it from.</p><p>His name was Remus Lupin, he was Sirius's roommate, and Sirius had only learned yesterday that he didn't have a book attached to his nose via Permanent Sticking Charm. He'd found this out when James had been pontificating (another word he'd learned from Remus) on his own brilliance, and the brown-haired boy who'd taken the corner bed in their room had looked up, said, "yes, surely this will go down in the annals of history," then looked back down and continued reading.</p><p>Sirius didn't mind reading, at least if it was a <em>fun</em> book, but he and James were <em>so close</em> to finding and thoroughly raiding the kitchens! There were more interesting things to be doing right now! He couldn't believe Remus Lupin was ignoring them! What could possibly be more interesting?</p><p>He'd decided to find out.</p><p>Sirius had flopped down on Remus Lupin's bed next to him and poked his nose into his book, just to see what was so great about it. "What're you reading? Is it good? Can I have a go?"</p><p>Remus had shoved him on the floor. And gone back to his book.</p><p>This could have ended badly, if James hadn't started laughing hysterically at the look on his face.</p><p>"Right," Sirius had said. "Show us where the kitchens are."</p><p><em>That</em> got Remus Lupin to look up. "I'm sorry?"</p><p>"I know you know. <em>Everyone </em>knows bookworms who lurk in corners know all the good secrets," Sirius said. He didn't know this at all, but it sounded good and seemed right, so he went with it. This was how all his best ideas were formed. "C'mon, show us, show us show us show us show us—"</p><p>"Merlin," Remus had muttered. "How about this: I give you a hint, but if—and only if—you leave me alone for five entire minutes. And bring me back an eclair."</p><p>"Deal," said Sirius. "Wait, they have eclairs?"</p><p>"Oh, yes," said Remus. "And here's your hint: <em>tickle the pear</em>."</p><p>James and Sirius had looked at each other.</p><p>"Under the Great Hall," James said.</p><p>"The bowl of fruit," Sirius said.</p><p>"To the kitchens! Away!" James had said, and barreled out of the room.</p><p>Sirius, however, had stopped at the door. "You don't want to come? And get your own eclair? Also how did you know that? Did you find it in our second week, while we were putting fireworks in the Herbicide Potions?"</p><p>Remus only answered one of these questions, and the answer didn't really explain anything. "Madame Pomfrey showed me."</p><p>Sirius stared. Then stalked over to Remus's bed again, and plopped down, knocking his shoulder against Remus's.</p><p>He'd have another chance at the kitchens.</p><p>Remus Lupin was watching him warily, which was fair, because Sirius's thoughts were a mess and he had no idea where to even begin.</p><p>"Teach me your ways," he said, finally.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Your ways! Your wiles! Your secrets! Remus Lupin, you've been here as long as I have and you've already enchanted half the Professors, and Snivellus hates you more than me somehow. You are a mysterious and noble being, and I must know! How do you do it!"</p><p>Remus Lupin had laughed.</p><p>And that was that.</p><p>So there it was. Sirius had it all figured out. James Potter was his best friend, and Remus Lupin was his other best friend (could you have more than one?) (this was new territory to Sirius, but he decided emphatically that he could, and who was going to tell him otherwise?) and he was going to find out <em>everything about him</em> until he could make him laugh as much as and as often as he could.</p><p>Sirius stuck his hands in his pockets and whistled to himself, striking up a jaunty tune that started out quiet until he figured out how to get the sound to echo in the stone hallways, at which point it became loud and shrill.</p><p>He even saw Narcissa coming in time, and was able to duck behind a tapestry until she went past him, at which point he Petrified her, and sprinted off in the other direction before anyone could see him.</p><p>Hogwarts was going to be amazing.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <b>April 1978: Seventh Year</b>
</p><p>Remus squinted at the eclair when Sirius handed it to him. "Are you buttering me up for something?"</p><p>"Always," Sirius said, grinning and settling next to him on the roof. "But it's a long con. Don't worry about it."</p><p>Remus couldn't hide a smile. "All right, then." And then he did the next part all on his own. "Remember the first time you brought me one of these?"</p><p>Sirius had to duck his head to keep his triumphant smile from showing. "As I recall, James beat me to it."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"He went to the kitchens without us. Remember?"</p><p>"That's right," said Remus. "He left without you, and you badgered me with questions until James came back. And he didn't bring you anything, because you'd ‘abandoned him to the wolves and/or house elves.'"</p><p>Sirius shrugged. "Forgot that bit," he said. "Just remember talking to you." He also vaguely remembered Peter showing up later in the night and James offering him pastries and that being the beginning of their legendary annals-of-history group. But mostly he remembered Remus laughing.</p><p>Remus turned his head to meet his eyes, at that. "That so?"</p><p>Sirius didn't break his gaze. "It is. Always liked talking to you, really. Even—especially--when Potter's not around to run his big mouth."</p><p>Remus smiled, and looked away. But he also broke the eclair in half and handed the second half to Sirius.</p><p>He did remember this part. "You're too nice, Remus Lupin," he said now, through a mouthful as he finished it in one bite, just as he had then.</p><p>"Are you complaining?" That was the same line, too.</p><p>"Never," said Sirius. Only this time he also leaned over and licked a bit of chocolate frosting off the side of Remus's mouth. At which point Remus tilted his head and pulled Sirius back in, so that was the end of talking.</p><p>A lot of things had changed since they were eleven, really. But he still liked spending time with just Remus. Always had.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"I knew it," said James. "I <em>knew</em> you were flirting with him from the beginning."</p><p>"You literally didn't," Sirius retorted, unfairly, James thought. "You found out a week ago that I want to shack up with him, and it shook you to your core."</p><p>"Excuse you, I was <em>slightly thrown off-guard</em>. I was not <em>shaken. </em>I did not <em>shake.</em>"</p><p>"Yes, but your core was vibrating wildly, I could tell."</p><p>James leered, out of habit, but Sirius swatted him before he could come up with a suitable joke.</p><p>"There's no time, Potter! I need a part two to this plan, stat!"</p><p>"Stat?"</p><p>"<em>Stat!</em>"</p><p>It didn't occur to James to question why he had to help with this.</p><p>"Well, you started with first year, didn't you?"</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"I mean...haven't you got something from second year to prove that you're a co-dependent mess without him?"</p><p>"What?" said Sirius.</p><p>"What?" said James.</p><p>They looked at each other.</p><p>"<em>Co-dependent</em>?" Sirius said, finally.</p><p>"You heard me."</p><p>"<em>Dependant</em>, maybe," Sirius said. "You know, a little. We can depend on each other! That's all! We don't fall to pieces without each other!"</p><p>"Sure you don't," said James.</p><p>"Anyway, you're one to talk."</p><p>"Lily Evans can function perfectly fine without my help," James pointed out. He did not waste breath arguing the other way.</p><p>"Yes, but she gets by better with it, and so do you—wait a minute. Wait. A minute."</p><p>"What? Wait for what?"</p><p>"I've got it!" said Sirius, and took off.</p><p>James stared after him, then sighed. It was probably best if he went after him.</p><p>To teach him a lesson, though, and because he had reached the wise old age of nearly-18 and in his later years was becoming more responsible, he took some time to finish off the conclusion of his Transfiguration essay, first.</p><p>After all, Dumbledore had said just the other day that he'd need to really understand this bit of the curriculum if he was actually going to help with the war. James didn't know what that meant, just yet.</p><p>He glanced over his essay, and then, in a move that would have surprised everyone in the school who didn't know how on earth he kept getting top marks, read it start to finish. He only had a few edits, but when he was done, he was sure it was near-perfect, even if he still didn't fully understand what Dumbledore was on about.</p><p>Well. He'd find out soon enough.</p><p>Now.</p><p>Time for some more mischief.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <b>January 1973: Second Year</b>
</p><p>It started on the way down from the dormitories to the Great Hall for breakfast, the day after they told him they knew, and the morning of him not being too scared to meet their eyes.</p><p>They'd spent most of the morning awake at an ungodly hour, pestering Remus with questions.</p><p>"How old were you?"</p><p>"Who did it?"</p><p>"Wait, do you give <em>yourself</em> those scars?"</p><p>"Holy fuck, Remus, really? Those are fucking nasty!" (James, twelve years old and free of his parents, had only just started learning how to curse.)</p><p>"It really hurts that bad?"</p><p>"I have to rearrange my bones once a month, of course it fucking hurts," Remus retorted to that one. (He was doing a lot better at cursing than James.)</p><p>"Merlin, Remus, no wonder you're so tired all the time," Sirius said. He'd leaned into Remus's side, though, where he'd joined Remus on his bed so as to pester him more directly, and saw Remus blink slowly in response, as if surprised, long eyelashes sweeping over his cheeks before he could come up with a response.</p><p>"Yes," he said finally. "There's nothing really to be done about it."</p><p>"So that's why you wouldn't fucking help with the Slytherin Scottish Accent prank," said James. "You went to bed fucking early because it was a bloody full moon!"</p><p>"That is <em>not</em> why," Remus retorted, but so quietly that only Sirius heard. He made a face at Remus, who grinned back, and felt the satisfied swoop in his stomach that always came from having a secret Remus-only joke.</p><p>The question-and-reluctant-answer game continued in the halls, though at a lower volume at Remus's repeated insistence.</p><p>They were standing outside of the Great Hall, delaying going in because Sirius had a burning question about fur texture ("But is it like—really soft? Are you pettable? Remus, can I pet the wolf why won't you let me pet the—") that needed answering, when an extremely unwelcome voice interrupted them.</p><p>"Move out of my way," it said. "You don't <em>own</em> the hallways, you know."</p><p>James's face darkened as he turned to face Snape, but more importantly, Remus went pale.</p><p>That was all Sirius needed. "Hullo, Snivellus," he said. "Actually, I bought this corridor myself two weeks ago, so it <em>does</em> belong to me."</p><p>"Yeah, and you owe us rent for getting your slime all over it," said Peter, and started sniggering helplessly until James thumped him.</p><p>"You're looking good today," James said. "Oh wait. Never mind. Your nose was in the way of your face and I couldn't see it."</p><p>Snape sneered. It was an impressive sneer.</p><p>It was directed at Remus, who hadn't said a word.</p><p>Then he swept past them.</p><p>"<em>What did he do to you</em>," Sirius growled, as soon as Snape was out of earshot. He didn't quite understand the dark, protective instinct that had seized his limbs and nearly hexed Snape into the next century, but he did know it was his right and duty to murder anyone who made Remus look like that. By hand, if necessary. He didn't need a wand to wring Snape's neck.</p><p>Remus must have been tired, from waking up early, being emotionally wrung out, the interrogation, or all of the above—because he actually answered. "Found out I'm a half-blood. To use what wizards consider a polite term for it," he said.</p><p>Sirius's and James's eyes met over his head.</p><p>"He's going <em>down</em>," James said.</p><p>"Please don't," said Remus. "I know it's—but I can handle it. I can."</p><p>"Sure," said Sirius. "We'll just hex him because his wig—I mean hair—is ugly. Nothing to do with you."</p><p>"Please," said Remus, who didn't actually plead unless he really meant it, so Sirius and James exchanged another glance, and pretended to let it go.</p><p>Remus looked relieved, at first, then miserable every time Snape glanced his way, and then in Charms they started working on advanced color-changing charms. And that was really the end of it.</p><p>"So what color should we turn Snape's hair for the rest of the week?" said Sirius at dinner.</p><p>"Pink," said Peter immediately.</p><p>"Done," Sirius and James said together.</p><p>"Make it super fucking sparkly, he'll bleeding well love that," James added.</p><p>"Oh, he'll be the prettiest girl at the ball." Sirius looked at Remus to see if he'd heard this brilliant cutting comment, but Remus was staring into empty space, not touching his food.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Well. They'd discovered ages ago (last year) that Remus secretly had all the best ideas.</p><p>"Or we could hold off," Sirius said, and when James gave him a confused look, jerked his head subtly in Remus's direction. "You know. Until we find the least flattering shade possible. Maybe do all of the Slytherins."</p><p>"We have done hair before," said James, catching on. "Maybe all their clothes?"</p><p>"Don't forget the sparkles," said Peter.</p><p>They sat for a minute, thinking.</p><p>"Start with hair," said Remus, finally. "Throw him off his guard, make him think it's just a repeat and nothing unusual. And not just pink. Hot pink, with sparkles. Then do his big, greasy, stupid nose."</p><p>He punctuated this with a maliciously-stabbed bite of roast chicken.</p><p>The Marauders exchanged glances.</p><p>"We'll do a different body part every day, ending with his nose and then his entire body and hair," Sirius said, with finality.</p><p>"He'll be a walking sunburn," said James.</p><p>"A glittery, glittery sunburn," said Peter.</p><p>And that was that.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"Do you remember being bitten?" Sirius asked, two days later when Snape's right arm was pink and they were hiding from his wrath in a broom closet.</p><p>Remus looked at him. It was dark, and Sirius couldn't quite see his eyes.</p><p>"Yes," he said.</p><p>Sirius blinked. "Oh. Okay."</p><p>He didn't ask again.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"I know it was you, Potter!"</p><p>Evans. That voice was enough to send Sirius scrambling to the dormitory stairs—though only far enough to where he could hide in the shadows and eavesdrop. She was <em>scary</em>, but James might need backup. Or at least a witness.</p><p>"Fuck off, what're you damn well talking about?" James still thought he sounded cool. Sirius hadn't found the courage to tell him otherwise.</p><p>"Pink, James! Pink and glittery! This has your name written all over it—<em>really</em>, you are <em>so</em> childish."</p><p>James shrugged. "Bullshit, you fucking can't prove anything."</p><p>"Oh will you stop that, you sound like an idiot." Evans whirled on Remus, who was minding his own dusty, homework-related business. "And you! You just let them! Why don't you ever say anything?"</p><p>Remus looked at her with his most mild expression, the one Sirius was starting to recognize as secretly his most dangerous. "What should I say, Lily? Wait, I've got it—how about ‘mudblood'? You know, the word he hisses at me every time he walks past me?"</p><p>Evans looked stunned for a moment, then scowled. "Why would he do that? You're not—you're not Muggleborn?"</p><p>"His mum is a Muggle," said James, apparently giving up on his profanity quest for the moment. "That's enough, apparently."</p><p>"You <em>removed all of his hair</em>," said Evans, after a minute. "Then dyed his bald head pink! Even if you're telling the truth—which I'm not even sure I believe! That's just—it's <em>cruel!</em>"</p><p>Remus shrugged, and looked back down at his assignment. "Believe what you want," he said.</p><p>That ended the conversation. Evans took off in a huff.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
Snape hissed more than a slur at them the next day. It was a hex, meant to give Remus nasty, throbbing boils. Remus dodged just in time, and Sirius fired back, a hex of his own that he'd unfortunately learned from Bellatrix. Snape slumped to the floor, clutching his nose (that was now oozing pus and blood all over the corridor), before McGonagall showed up and gave them both detention.</p><p>Later, on his way up to the dormitory, exhausted from polishing trophies all night, Sirius heard James ask: "But I mean—do you remember—you know. Getting bit?"</p><p>"No," said Remus's voice.</p><p>"That's something, at least," said James. "I guess."</p><p>"Mm."</p><p>Sirius blinked, but after a moment, he continued upstairs, and carried on as if he hadn't heard anything.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>They achieved the walking glittery sunburn at long last (after two weeks of relentless dedication that culminated in re-growing Snape's hair a foot longer, and pinker), and it gave all of them such a boost of joy to see him sparkling his way around campus, that even Peter was quite proud of himself. After all, Snape had tried to hex him this time, and he'd countered it so quickly that no one was even sure how he'd done it.</p><p>"Ought to shut him up," Sirius heard Peter saying, on his way into the Common Room. Again, he stopped. He'd been learning the most interesting things this way lately. "And hey, at least he doesn't know about—you know."</p><p>"Yet," said Remus darkly. "He's started insisting to everyone in earshot that I have a communicable disease."</p><p>"Yeah, but you'd never—you know—communic it."</p><p>"Right."</p><p>Sirius could practically hear Peter shift nervously in his seat. Then he blurted: "Say, Remus, do you even remember—"</p><p>"No," said Remus.</p><p>"Right," said Peter.</p><p>Sirius chose this moment to enter the room. It was getting painful, and he owed it to everyone to put an end to it.</p><p>"Hullo lads, who wants to see the pictures of Snape James finally developed from his camera? He's thinking we should wallpaper his room with them, come look."<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <b>April 1978: Seventh Year</b>
</p><p>"No no no no," Sirius said. "The point is that he <em>needs me</em>. Not that I'll fight all his battles for him! Just that I'm his backup! You get it, right?"</p><p>"So we have to turn Snape pink again?" James said. "Yeah, I'm still not following, mate."</p><p>"It'll prove my love! Again!"</p><p>"Right, but you wouldn't <em>believe</em> the lecture I got from Lily over that prank. She could've roasted me slowly over the fire and it would've been less painful. Or given me an actual all-over sunburn. Or flayed me alive and scattered my bones to the crows. Or—"</p><p>"We get it, James." Who "we" was, James didn't quite know. It was only the two of them. "I mean, I was <em>there</em>."</p><p>"No, you weren't."</p><p>"Well, I was hiding in the staircase, but—"</p><p>"Not the first time. She gave me a <em>second</em> lecture."</p><p>"Wait, what? I thought she realized you weren't lying about him being a bigot!"</p><p>"I mean. She said we still went too far. But mostly it wasn't about that, this time it was her objecting to our color choice. She had a whole thing about feminism and masculinity and colors not having gender. And not taking out your own insecurities on bystanders. She made me take notes."</p><p>"Oh, is that it?" said Sirius. "Well, that's easy. I'll just turn myself pink."</p><p>"Oh, good ide......wait. What?"<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"You dyed yourself pink," said Lily. "To prove your love to me?"</p><p>"Well, when you put it like that," said James.</p><p>"James..."</p><p>"Colors don't have gender! It's not emasculating to be a walking pink glittery sunburn! It's actually fucking fun! Down with the man! Hear me roar!"</p><p>"James."</p><p>"What? Did I do something wrong? Is my nose not sparkly enough? I can add more sparkles—"</p><p>Lily burst out laughing.</p><p>James grinned. Mission accomplished. He could only hope it went as well for Sirius.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"So you convinced James to dye himself pink," said Remus. "To prove your love for me?"</p><p>"Well, he doesn't know yet that I'm not actually doing it myself, but yeah."</p><p>"How dare you," said Remus. "You're not worthy after all."</p><p>"Well, I thought about it long and hard, and concluded that I don't feel like picking glitter out of my ass for the last three months of school, but that's not the point!"</p><p>"Isn't it? I think I can forgive that reasoning, if I try really hard."</p><p>"The point is, I would turn a thousand Slytherins pink for you, Remus Lupin. Or not, when you tell me not to. And if I don't feel like it. And if they haven't said anything racist recently. And if Snivellus isn't casting <em>Sectumsempra</em> on James. I'll let you pick the color, anyway. It doesn't have to be pink."</p><p>"Right," said Remus. "What was that about ass glitter?"<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"Why, though?" said Lily. "I mean, I know why you <em>said</em>, but—"</p><p>James shrugged. "Well. It <em>was</em> really mean."</p><p>"Doing it to yourself, having it be a choice, doesn't exactly make up for that."</p><p>"I know," said James. He really did. "But it's more—well. You know I can't wait to get out of this stupid school, right? And start doing some actual good in the world, if I can?"</p><p>"You're telling me," said Lily.</p><p>"On the other hand...we don't know what's going to happen out there, right? I mean, you don't even know how to cook."</p><p>"Careful now."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah. The point is. Well. No matter what happens...let's have some fun before we die, yeah?"</p><p>Lily was quiet for a moment.</p><p>"Um. Lils? You okay in there? I hope that wasn't too depressing, I just—"</p><p>"No, no," said Lily. "I'm just having an existential crisis."</p><p>"I'm sure we'll be fine, Dumbledore knows what he's doing, I didn't mean to be apocalyptic—"</p><p>"It's not that," Lily said. "It's more like...I really want to make out with a hot pink glittery Indian man right now, and I'm not sure how to process that."</p><p>It was James's turn to laugh. "Well, let's undo it for a bit then, yeah?"</p><p>"That would be better, yes."</p><p>"To save your eyesight," James said as he (temporarily) reversed the spell. "And, ironically enough, preserve your blinding attraction to me."</p><p>"Don't push it," said Lily, but she leaned in.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"You told me in second year that you remembered," said Sirius, later. They were alone again, not even fooling around but still glancing at the door every five seconds. Sirius really, really wanted space just for themselves. And soon.</p><p>Remus looked up from his book. "You know. When you—" he finished the sentence by miming what he thought was a brilliant impression of wolf teeth. Remus still didn't like when they talked about his lycanthropy too loudly, even in private. Sirius had learned to actually respect that the hard way.</p><p>Remus looked back at his book. "Did I?"</p><p>"But you told James and Peter both, separately, that you didn't remember. I overheard."</p><p>"Is that right."</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"So what?"</p><p>Sirius stared at Remus until he looked up, and sighed. But didn't say anything.</p><p>"I mean, they can't both be true," said Sirius, to fill the silence. "And you never told me anything else."</p><p>"Did your father ever hit you?"</p><p>He wasn't expecting that one. His throat threatened to close up, but. It was Remus. "Not often," he said, tightly.</p><p>Good old dad had always been more...subtle. Than that.</p><p>"Now pretend I'm Peter, asking the same question."</p><p>Sirius shrugged, carelessly. "It's none of his busine—oh."</p><p>Remus looked down again.</p><p>"Really? In second year?"</p><p>The tips of Remus's ears turned pink, but he didn't look up. Sirius smirked.</p><p>"And here I thought I was throwing myself at you for six years."</p><p>"You didn't, though," said Remus. "You held back. When I really wanted you to."</p><p>Sirius's smirk turned into a real smile. So he had gotten through after all.</p><p>"Oh, if only you knew," he said, trying to keep it light. "The suffering I endured, all to get Remus Lupin to smile at me. The pain! The hardship!"</p><p>"Sounds terrible," said Remus, but this time his tone wasn't so much noncommittal as it was an invitation. Sirius happened to be an expert on the difference.</p><p>He leaned forward, grinning over the top of Remus's book, too big and bright to be ignored. "My outstanding and award-winning self control aside—the real problem was, I wasn't fluent in Remus Lupin yet."</p><p>Remus put his bookmark in place, but didn't close or lower the book yet. "I don't think that's a real language."</p><p>"Oh, but it is. I have a dictionary and everything."</p><p>"Oh, do tell." The book was lowering further and further.</p><p>"'That's a terrible idea' means: it's an okay idea, but I've got a better one."</p><p>Remus smiled, faintly. "So you've never listened to me from the beginning, I see."</p><p>"Oh but I do," said Sirius. "That's the whole point. ‘I'm so tired of getting caught' means: let's make a highly complicated magical map to ensure that we will never get caught again."</p><p>"James unlocked the final piece of that one, to be fair."</p><p>"Don't you dare give him credit for that, it was all you and you know it," Sirius countered, and didn't let him retort, but continued. "'Sirius, leave me alone, I need to finish this essay and/or book' means: Sirius, I am bored out of my mind, please make out with me immediately."</p><p>"Now that one definitely isn't true," said Remus, but while blushing so hard that Sirius was inclined to disagree.</p><p>"And a one word answer about a deep dark secret, means: Sirius I trust you with my life and my heart and soul forever and ever."</p><p>Remus rolled his eyes, but also tilted his head, studying Sirius critically, while Sirius tried not to squirm. That gaze always did things to him that weren't suitable for polite company. "Sirius," he said finally. Deliberately. "Leave me alone, I need to finish this book."</p><p>Well, he couldn't say no to that. Sirius snatched the book out of his hands, and obliged.<br/><br/></p><p>"Third year next," Sirius said.</p><p>"I still can't believe you betrayed me," James said.</p><p>"You'll get over it."</p><p>"There I was, pink and glittery and glorious, waiting for my best friend in the world, my <em>brother</em>, to join me—"</p><p>"What should I do for third year? The only thing I remember from that whole year is The Football Incident."</p><p>James grinned. Hogwarts just hadn't been ready for exploding football. "We were ahead of our time, mate."</p><p>"I know. I think about it every single day of my life," said Sirius. "But seriously—don't say it—what do I do?"</p><p>"Oh, I thought you were kidding," said James, because wasn't it obvious? When Sirius gave him a blank look, he shook his head. "Sirius...that was the year we started calling him <em>Moony</em>."</p><p>"Oh." Sirius blinked. "Oh!"</p><p>"Yeah," said James.</p><p>"<em>Yeah</em>," said Sirius, master of wit and wordplay, feared by his peers for his biting tongue and quick thinking.</p><p>"You know what to do," said James.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <b>November 1973: Third Year</b>
</p><p>Sirius flinched as soon as the portrait opened into the Common Room—he and Remus both had been silently hoping, on their silent walk back from dinner, that James and Peter were elsewhere tonight.</p><p>No such luck.</p><p>"Remus! In for a game of Exploding Snap? Let's see how long it takes to singe Peter's eyebrows off this time!"</p><p>Remus didn't even look at him, just kept his head down and stomped upstairs.</p><p>"Well, he's in a bad mood," said James.</p><p>At that, Sirius stopped following him, and gave James his most withering look. "My goodness, I wonder why."</p><p>"You're stumped too?" said Peter.</p><p>Sirius stared at them. "Look at the brain trust here," he said. He wasn't really in a good mood either. He also didn't care. "Geniuses, the lot of you."</p><p>"Don't tell us, then," said James, smacking his hand down on the cards. They exploded.</p><p>In the aftermath, they discovered that Peter's eyebrows were completely gone, as always when they played Exploding Snap. It wasn't unusual, but it did cheer Sirius up a bit.</p><p>"Merlin, you look like shit. Can't you ever learn to duck?"</p><p>"I try, but it's like the blast heads right for me!"</p><p>"Explosions don't <em>aim</em>," Sirius said scathingly.</p><p>"Oh, who cares," said James, dealing another hand. "Sirius, are you going to share with the class or what?"</p><p>"Did you both forget the Defense lesson we had this morning?"</p><p>"...Yes," said Peter.</p><p>"Oh," said James.</p><p>"Yeah, oh. He didn't talk to me at all at dinner, and he's probably holed up there right now, brooding," Sirius said. "Brooding and hating himself."</p><p>"Let's do something about it, then," said James. "C'mon, Mad Scientist." He got up, leaving the cards unattended to probably explode on their own yet somehow take off Peter's arm hair.</p><p>"Me?" said Peter, looking around.</p><p>"Yes you, do you see anyone else with face burns around here?" James said over his shoulder as he led the way to the dormitory stairs.</p><p>"Aren't all scientists mad?" said Sirius, climbing up after him. "They use ekeltricity to try to make Inferi, but they fail miserably because they're Muggle buffoons who don't know their arse from their spleen--you know, now that I say it out loud, I think my dad didn't know what he was talking about."</p><p>"I think you should chuck everything your dad ever told you in the bin and start over, mate," said James, not unkindly, as he opened the door to their room. "Hey, Remus, did Muggles ever try to make Inferi out of electricity?"</p><p>Never let it be said that James Potter didn't know how to enter a room and immediately dominate the conversation.</p><p>Remus stared at them, clearly trying to process what was happening. "Oh," he said. "You're talking about Frankenstein."</p><p>"Wait, it's real?" said Sirius. "I thought my dad was full of shit!"</p><p>"He was," said Remus. "It's a book. A fictional one, about a mad scientist."</p><p>"Oh," said Sirius, briefly disappointed. Then he brightened up. "Can I read it?" He'd thought for two whole years that Remus's books were boring, until he actually read one of them. Since then he'd been devouring Muggle fiction as though it was going extinct.</p><p>"Of course," said Remus. "I'll write my mum for a copy."</p><p>"And before you do that, you can tell us everything they got wrong in the lesson today, " said James.</p><p>Remus paused in his shuffle to look for quill and parchment. "What lesson?"</p><p>"The one about werewolves!" said Peter, as the light finally dawned. "Oh, I get it. No wonder you're in a bad mood."</p><p>"I'm not in a bad mood," said Remus.</p><p>"Oh, stuff it, you were up here brooding in the dark," said James, lighting the lamps to prove his point.</p><p>"It's still light outside."</p><p>"Keep telling yourself that," said Sirius. He sat down next to Remus on his bed. "Sooooo..."</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"Let's play Werewolf Twenty Questions!" said Sirius, who had taken a one-time sarcastic comment from Remus to its natural end, and invented a game.</p><p>"Or, here's a better idea, let's never talk about it," said Remus, getting up to leave.</p><p>Sirius pulled him down. "Don't do this," he said. He did not let go of Remus's hand. He didn't want to.</p><p>"Do what?"</p><p>"Hide from us. We can help."</p><p>"You really can't."</p><p>"Sure we can," said James, pulling out a piece of parchment. "<em>Scienta potentia est!</em>"</p><p>They all stared at him.</p><p>"Was that a spell?" said Peter.</p><p>"Did you just quote Hobbes?" said Remus.</p><p>"I thought it was Bacon," said James.</p><p>"Wait, there's bacon?" said Peter.</p><p>"It means ‘knowledge is power'," Remus told him. "And Francis Bacon is a person."</p><p>"It's Latin, Peter," said James.</p><p>"I thought your family was Indian, how do you know Latin?"</p><p>Even Sirius, bigoted family and all, knew how stupid that question was. "For fuck's sake, Peter—"</p><p>But James was more patient than him. "My dad's family has been in Britain for generations, Peter," said James. "Getting British educations. And it helps with British spells, to know Latin. So yes, I learned some Hindi and some Latin and some French, all at the same time."</p><p>"Ugh, French," said Sirius.</p><p>"Just because your French teacher was an asshole and mine was hot—"</p><p>"<em>Va te faire enculer</em>, Potter."</p><p>"Your teacher couldn't be much of an asshole if he taught you that one," said Remus.</p><p>"He didn't, I learned it off dear old Bellatrix."</p><p>"What does this have to do with bacon?" said Peter.</p><p>"Francis Bacon," said Remus, not seeming to mind that he was repeating himself. "It's a name, of a very famous medieval writer. And they say it was Bacon, James, but Hobbes was the first one to actually write that specific sentence."</p><p>"Dammit, now I want bacon," said Sirius.</p><p>"Kitchen raid?" said Peter.</p><p>"Sure," said Remus.</p><p>"No," said James and Sirius together.</p><p>"We've gotten off track," said Sirius. "Again."</p><p>"Right, so what we were saying is, we don't know how we can help, but how can we know unless we <em>know</em>?" said James. "You know? Right, Sirius?"</p><p>"James, what the fuck," said Sirius.</p><p>"You're the worst," said James.</p><p>"I get it," said Remus. "But better, older wizards than you have tried, and—"</p><p>"No they haven't," said Sirius.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I was listening today," he said. "They haven't tried shit. They've gotten as far as identifying werewolves, closing the bite wounds, and figuring out that they age a bit faster than other people. That's it. That's our werewolf research."</p><p>"Also that they're vicious killers with no souls who eat human babies," said James. "Don't forget that part."</p><p>"Remus Lupin, eater of babies," said Sirius. "Can you imagine?"</p><p>"Yes," said Remus.</p><p>They looked at him.</p><p>Remus sighed. "I don't remember everything, after."</p><p>"Okay, so that's different, they said you do," said James, writing on his parchment. They looked at him. "What? Go on, don't let me stop you."</p><p>"Right...well, they did get that wrong. It's not a perfect memory, it's more. Muddled. The wolf doesn't think the way I do—sights, sounds, smells—it processes them differently."</p><p>"And wants to eat babies?" said Peter.</p><p>"Not exactly. But it's angry. At being cooped up, usually. It wants to destroy—everything. And the smell of people drives it crazy."</p><p>They were silent, except for the sound of James scratching away.</p><p>"James..." said Remus after a minute. "Why are you writing this down? This isn't something you can leave lying around, there really shouldn't be a record at all—"</p><p>"What? Oh, it's fine," said James.</p><p>"I wouldn't worry about it," said Sirius at the same time.</p><p>They exchanged a glance, and when Remus opened his mouth to protest, James held up his parchment to show him. It was, predictably, covered in James's spidery, all-caps (for some reason), completely illegible handwriting.</p><p>Remus actually cracked a grin. "I see," he said. "Do you write all your essays like that?"</p><p>"McGonagall says I'm teaching her to be a codebreaker," James said proudly.</p><p>"He's lying," said Sirius. "He has perfect penmanship for essays. He just doesn't bother when he's the only one reading his notes."</p><p>"Or when they're top secret," said Peter, sounding just a little too excited that they were taking top secret notes.</p><p>"Sirius, you do the exact same thing," said Remus. "You taught yourself to have bad handwriting, and you only submit legible essays to the professors you like."</p><p>Sirius grinned at him, and felt a little lightheaded when Remus smirked back. He was fully aware that there was an ongoing argument in the staff room about whether he was a good student or not. Andromeda had told him, before she graduated. "Your point?"</p><p>"Maybe we should learn some stuff about regular wolves," said James, oblivious to the strange churning in Sirius's stomach when Remus gave him that particular look. "Then compare and contrast."</p><p>Remus sighed, and finally released Sirius's hand (damn) to gently take James's parchment away from him. Then started writing a list of books.</p><p>They watched him for a moment.</p><p>"So...you've done this research yourself, then?" said Sirius.</p><p>"My dad did."</p><p>"And he couldn't find a cure?" said Peter.</p><p>"No. There isn't one."</p><p>James wrinkled his forehead. "Who said anything about a cure?"</p><p>"Well, my dad, for eight years," said Remus. "He tried everything, James. <em>Everything</em>."</p><p>James looked at his list. "These are wizard books. About werewolves."</p><p>Remus shrugged. "They're the most accurate ones out there."</p><p>Sirius held out his hand, and James, reading the look on his face, handed him the parchment.</p><p>Sirius ripped off the list, and set it on fire with his wand.</p><p>Remus and Peter both stared at him, but James looked grim and determined and entirely on the same page.</p><p>"Fuck that," said Sirius. "We've established there's no cure, and that your dad would've found one if there was. And we've established that even the experts don't know shit."</p><p>"We're starting over," James agreed. "I want books about wolves, not werewolves. Muggle books. Science books. With no wizard bullshit about evil baby-eaters who need to be killed or cured in them."</p><p>"I don't think you really need to go that far with your essay—"</p><p>"This isn't for class," James said.</p><p>"James—"</p><p>"In all those books," said Sirius, "where they talk about how bad it is, or how evil werewolves are, or how we can't cure them. Did anyone ever say anything about just...helping the wolf?"</p><p>"Well...no one can really get near them..."</p><p>"So they feel angry when they're near humans, but do they feel angry all the time? James write this dow—oh good you are," said Sirius. "Do they enjoy feeling anger? What would happen if the wolf stopped being angry?"</p><p>"Got it," said James, scribbling furiously. "I still want to research wolves. I'm no mad Muggle scientist, but I'm willing to bet that regular wolves don't feel all-encompassing rage from the smell of humans. Maybe the smell of rabbits. Are werewolves enraged by rabbits?"</p><p>"Wouldn't know. I don't exactly hang out in a field and play with bunnies when I'm in that state," said Remus.</p><p>"So that's something else to research," said James, writing it down.</p><p>"Are there any books written by werewolves?" said Peter.</p><p>Everyone looked at him.</p><p>"Probably not," said Remus.</p><p>"We'll start looking," said James. He wrote this down too. "Maybe there's one who can tell us about this whole rage issues thing."</p><p>"Your dad really tried for eight years to cure you?" said Sirius.</p><p>"He wasn't exactly big on werewolves before I got bit," said Remus. "And he was a little desperate."</p><p>"Yeah? What happened? You told us it was Greyback and that it was revenge, but—"</p><p>"Revenge for what my dad said about him. It was all over the papers. Famous dark creatures expert lashes out against werewolves, says they deserve death in trial against Muggle tramp accused of lycanthropy—Greyback got off but my dad turned out to be right. Even though no one believed him. And I was the revenge."</p><p>"You know, I remember hearing about that trial," said Sirius. "I was little, but. My parents were pretty emphatic in their...agreement. With what he said about werewolves."</p><p>Remus shrugged. "To be fair, he wasn't wrong about Greyback specifically deserving to die."</p><p>"But if it was in the papers—didn't anyone hear about you getting bit?" said Peter.</p><p>"There were rumors," said Remus. "Because my dad disappeared after it happened. Took himself, me, and my mum completely off the map. But no one ever knew why."</p><p>"I don't remember the name Lupin at all though," Sirius said. "And I would. My parents would have invited him to dinner or something, so long as they didn't know about your mum."</p><p>For some reason, that made Remus slide his eyes away, shiftily. "Uh. He was probably across the country by the time they thought of it. They probably couldn't find him."</p><p>Sirius looked at James. Something wasn't right.</p><p>"Doesn't lupin mean ‘wolf'?" said James.</p><p>"I thought it was a flower," said Peter.</p><p>"It is a flower," said Remus. "My mum likes to grow them around the house. Whatever house we're in at the moment. They're tall, and purple—"</p><p>"Yeah, and they're named after the Latin word for wolf," said James, refusing to be deterred.</p><p>"Wait, and Remus is a wolf name too," said Sirius. "From Remus and Romulus. They were abandoned and raised by wolves."</p><p>"How'd you know that one?" said Peter.</p><p>"Remus left a book of mythology on his bed, what was I supposed to do? Not read it? Please, Peter."</p><p>"So wait, what are you saying? That Remus's parents named him Wolf Wolf?" said James.</p><p>"Yeah, what's your middle name? Is it just the Latin word for Moon?"</p><p>"It's John," said Remus, who was sounding a little desperate now, and who had definitely been refusing for the last two years to tell them what the J stood for<sup><a title="click to see footnote" href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/21004229/chapters/49951286#note1" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup> <a name="return1" rel="nofollow" id="return1"></a>so, something was up. "The Latin word for moon is <em>luna</em>. You know, like "lunar’."</p><p>"Remus Luna Lupin," said James. "Yeah, it doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Shame—you could've been Wolf Moon Wolf. Really wave it under everyone's noses."</p><p>"Please no," said Remus.</p><p>"Remus..." said Sirius. "What aren't you telling us? Why did your parents name you Wolf John Wolf?"</p><p>"Um," said Remus. "They...didn't?"</p><p>There was a moment of stunned silence.</p><p>"Your dad went into hiding—are you saying it's an assumed name?" said Sirius.</p><p>"Your dad named himself Wolf when he went into hiding?" James said.</p><p>"That doesn't seem...smart," said Peter, ever insightful.</p><p>"No, he kept using different names whenever we moved. But when I came to Hogwarts I needed just one, so. Um. Dumbledore kind of. Let me pick my own name."</p><p>More silence.</p><p>Then James, seeing the look on Sirius's face, quickly cast a Silencing Charm, which Sirius took a brief second to be thankful for because there was no way he could keep his voice down for this one—</p><p>"YOU NAMED YOURSELF WOLF WOLF?"</p><p>"This is the best day of my life," said James.</p><p>"YOU LITTLE <em>SHIT!</em>"</p><p>"Why?" said Peter.</p><p>"Isn't it obvious?" said James. "He's hiding in plain sight! It's amazing!"</p><p>"WOLF WOLF!" was all Sirius could manage, between hysterical laughter.</p><p>Remus started to smile. Just a little. It was a smug smile, too. Sirius had never been happier.</p><p>"Why John, then?" said Peter, who was not only insightful but clearly focused on the most important detail of this story, for fuck's sake. "Is that your real name?"</p><p>"HE PICKED HIS OWN REAL NAME AND IT'S <em>WOLF WOLF</em>."</p><p>"I don't—remember ever using my real name?" said Remus. "It got a little confusing, moving everywhere and changing names all the time, my parents always called me the fake name even in private to keep themselves from messing up in public..."</p><p>"Your life is an Elizabethan tragedy," said Sirius, calming down for thirty seconds so he could acknowledge this tear-jerker of a casual anecdote. "Except for when <em>you named yourself Wolf Wolf.</em>"</p><p>"You should have picked Moon as a middle name," said James. "Why the fuck didn't you think of that?"</p><p>Remus shrugged. "‘Remus J. Lupin' sounded good, so I picked a J name I liked."</p><p>"This is the best day of my life," said Sirius.</p><p>"I just said that," said James.</p><p>"You were right," said Sirius. "And I'm claiming it as mine too."</p><p>"We should start calling you Moon," said James. "Just to double down."</p><p>"That sounds weird," Peter pointed out. "Like, ‘hey Moon, hand me that quill.' Weird."</p><p>"Moony," said Sirius, with the kind of finality that comes with a sudden sense of destiny. "He's Moony. From now on."</p><p>Remus's face did a strange thing at that—a brief moment caught between protest, a grin, and another emotion that Sirius didn't yet recognize.</p><p>He settled on laughter, and burying his face in his hands. "This is the worst idea."</p><p>"You did it to yourself," said Sirius. "Literally. Moony. Wolf Wolf. Wolfy McWolferson."</p><p>"Fucking hell," said Remus.</p><p>"So, Moony. Can you write to your mum for books about wolves?" said James.</p><p>"And for the mad Frankenstein book," Sirius reminded him.</p><p>Remus threw up his hands. "Sure," he said. "Why the fuck not."<br/>

  <b>April 1978: Seventh Year</b>
</p><p>"Morning, Moon Moon," Sirius said around a yawn followed by a too-big bite of eggs. He loved Waning-Gibbous-Saturdays. There was never anyone in the Great Hall except a few fifth years chugging energy potions and looking near death until noon. While James—who was usually an early riser, but not after a moon—and Peter slept like logs (loud, snoring logs), Sirius was always too hungry from running to sleep, and Remus, who was usually also starving though for different reasons, left the Hospital Wing early when he could (which was more and more, in the last two years).</p><p>"That's a new one," Remus said. He was bleary-eyed and pale, but Sirius noted with satisfaction, as he did every morning after a Transformation since the first time in fifth year, that he was not injured or even bruised.</p><p>"Well, Wolf Wolf and Moony were getting less funny. I had to find a new way to point out the absurdity of your existence."</p><p>"You really don't have room to talk," Remus pointed out, as he down across from him and then did not move when Sirius immediately entangled their feet. "You're literally named Black Dog Star."</p><p>They exchanged a brief, private smile, that only two other people in the world would have understood the joke of. "Yes, but mine didn't become funny until later," Sirius said anyway. "You did yours on purpose."</p><p>Remus shrugged, hiding a smirk, and started helping himself to sausages.</p><p>Sirius may have watched him with his hand on his chin as though Moony eating was they best telly-vision program in the world. Maybe. He'd deny it later.</p><p>"I do remember my name," said Remus, out of nowhere. His hair was wild and curly in a way he never allowed it to be on normal days. Sirius wanted to wreck it further. Maybe he'd get a chance later.</p><p>"Your name?"</p><p>"You know. The original one."</p><p>Remus didn't say, <em>the real one</em>, like Peter would've, but Sirius understood without asking why. He wasn't unfamiliar with the idea that the names you gave yourself and the names your friends gave you were more important than the ones you were born with.</p><p>"Yeah?" said Sirius.</p><p>"You want to know it?" said Remus.</p><p>Sirius thought about it; really thought about it. He liked when Remus trusted him with things, but—</p><p>"D'you want me to use it?" he said, finally.</p><p>Remus shrugged. "Not...really. It doesn't feel like mine anymore."</p><p>"Are you ever going to have a reason to dig it out?"</p><p>"Not that I can think of."</p><p>"Then keep it," said Sirius. "Unless you want to tell me."</p><p>Remus smiled. "No," he said. "No, I think...I think that kid is someone else. Someone who's not me."</p><p>"Because you are Moony Wolf Wolf," said Sirius.</p><p>"Exactly."</p><p>"You know," said Sirius, "I've secretly always liked the sound of it."</p><p>Remus's smile turned into a full grin, spreading slowly across his face like a sunrise. "I know," he said.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>It was not long afterward that they looked up from smiling stupidly at each other and not saying much, to see that Dumbledore had descended from—wherever he'd been—to loom majestically over their table.</p><p>"Mr. Lupin, Mr. Black," he said, then paused. "You're looking well, Mr. Lupin."</p><p>"Thank you, sir," said Remus, with his most bland poker face. It never failed to astonish Sirius that professors thought Remus was the good one, at least until he saw that particular brand of acting in action.</p><p>"Do you both have a moment?" Dumbledore said. "Assuming, of course, that you are finished."</p><p>Between the two of them, the table was cluttered with empty dishes and glasses—it looked like four people had just had a feast.</p><p>"I think we just might be," said Sirius. "If you'd come in another hour, though, we'd probably be back at it again."</p><p>He couldn't pretend he wasn't being flippant to gauge Dumbledore's mood—they didn't seem to be in trouble, but you never knew. Luckily, Dumbledore's eyes twinkled briefly at him, and both his and Remus's shoulders relaxed a bit.</p><p>"Then let us go to my office."<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"And then he asked us to join the Order," Sirius finished, and James and Lily both nodded.</p><p>"I thought that might be it," James said. "Surprised it took him this long."</p><p>"Apparently he wanted to talk to us both," Sirius said, now pacing back and forth on the Common Room rug. The conversation had been stressful, to say the least. "He was waiting for a good moment."</p><p>"I'm assuming you said yes without thinking about it," said Lily. James thought approvingly that Sirius and Lily had come a long way in their relationship—the words were wry, but they carried no judgment.</p><p>"Of course," said Sirius. "If he hadn't said anything I would have marched up there and demanded to know if there was a way I could help. But Remus..."</p><p>"He can't have said no," said James.</p><p>"He said he had to think about it," said Sirius. "Because he doesn't know if he'll even have a steady source of income after the war, and even housing is going to be difficult." He flung himself into a comfortable armchair that had been the source of his angst more than once over the last seven years. James had to admit this was a bit more serious--though not as Sirius--as the tea incident. "James, I don't know what to do."</p><p>"This is about the—" Lily mimed an excellent impression of wolf teeth with her hands "—thing, right?"</p><p>They looked at her.</p><p>"What? I didn't believe Severus when he wouldn't shut up about it, but I'm not entirely incapable of putting things together myself."</p><p>"Oh good, the whole school knows," said Sirius. "Great."</p><p>"That's provably not true," said James, a bit more somber than he meant to be. "But--what about The Plan? Is it not going well?"</p><p>"What plan?" said Lily.</p><p>"You might as well fill her in," said Sirius, flapping a wrist, when James looked at him.</p><p>"What, all of it?" said James, trying not to look sidelong at Lily and failing.</p><p>"You mean that you two are dating?" said Lily, both catching on to his failed attempts at subtlety and further proving that she was brilliant and clever and perfect and also absolutely terrifying. "Since last year, right? October?"</p><p>"September," said Sirius. He looked a little sheepish, a rare look on him that really only came out when Remus was involved.</p><p>"What, did you both spend the entire summer pining after each other?" said James. "And then wait two entire weeks before mauling each other?"</p><p>"Not important," said Sirius. His face was a fascinating shade of red, and James would've pursued the issue further if it wasn't for Lily.</p><p>"So your plan is to talk Remus into moving in with you even though he's convinced it's his destiny to starve alone on the streets," said Lily.</p><p>James narrowed his eyes at Sirius, just as a warning--he was letting this go for now, so as not to argue in front of Lily, but he would not forget.</p><p>"That's right," said Sirius, deliberately ignoring him. "And yes, I did try just asking. He can't be convinced he won't be a burden."</p><p>"Not in words," James pointed out.</p><p>"Merlin," Lily muttered. "What, does he think the two of you will have visiting hours? Check in once a month to snog and then go about your separate business of getting killed by Death Eaters and starving to death?"</p><p>Neither of them pointed out how dark that was. There didn't seem to be a point anymore in pretending it wasn't just the way things were.</p><p>"Knowing Remus," James said slowly, "Is there any chance he thinks this whole thing is just temporary? That after school you'll just—move on, or whatever?"</p><p>Sirius stared at him. "If he does, he's the most blockheaded, unobservant, self-pitying—oh, hell, you're probably right."</p><p>"Well, at least he's got friends," Lily said, smiling faintly.</p><p>"For all the good it does, when he gets in one of these moods and tries to push us away," said James.</p><p>"It's his pride," said Sirius. "He'll go to his death refusing to accept help from anyone."</p><p>"It sounds like he thinks he doesn't have anything to offer in return," said Lily. It was kind of her to not mention Sirius's own pride, James thought.</p><p>Sirius nodded. "That's what I've been trying to tell him. That he does. It's not about money, or about—anything else that he thinks makes him hard to be with—it's about <em>him</em>."</p><p>"Gross," said James, because he had to, but he still shrugged his agreement when they looked at him. They'd spent seven years trying to get that through Remus's head.</p><p>"And you said just telling him doesn't work," Lily said. "So you have to...what? Make a convoluted plan?"</p><p>"Well, obviously," said Sirius, just as James said:</p><p>"Wait, Sirius, that's it. You've got fourth and fifth year covered, now."</p><p>"The twelve years of detention," Sirius breathed. "You're right, that's it!"</p><p>"And Peter's Prank Debut," said James.</p><p>"We can even do it again, but Moony's way," Sirius said.</p><p>"Yes! And include everyone, not just them!"</p><p>"Wait," said Lily. "What?"</p>
