    <p> </p><p>
  <span>“Forgive me, Father for I have sinned,” Harry whispered, kneeling at the altar in the hopes that the heat emanating from between the pews could drown the chaos in his mind. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The acts of the flesh are obvious...” Harry closed his eyes and shrank further into himself,  his hair tickling the scar on his forehead as he prayed, his mind wandering down a dangerous path.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>A touch against bare skin, fingers dancing along his spine as they trailed from the small of his back all the the way up to his neck...</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry shuddered, recalling the way the boy’s lips twisted into a smile, sharp teeth catching on the sunlight bleeding into the white. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>And then white teeth flashed before his eyes, before digging down on quivering skin, blood welling right at the edges as he breathed...</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry tried to dispel the image from the back of his mind, almost as if those teeth were savaging his throat right at the altar, but the fantasy lingered like blood on white linen. It refused to be cleansed.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Harry moaned, drowning when a finger dipped low on his back and trailed lower still, a firm finger pressing inside, before curling and...</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God,” Harry choked out, before finally banishing the parasitic thought. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Deliver me from my enemies, oh my God. Set me securely on high away from those who rise up against me…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The words felt heavy on Harry’s tongue, the weight of them enough to crush him as he tried to erase the memories of the man that had sat at the row nearest to the altar, and banish the strange fantasies that lingered in his mind’s eye. But the man’s imaginary dark eyes followed him at every turn, taking in every movement despite how hard Harry tried to rein these strange emotions.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry clutched tighter onto the rosary, remembering how the man had traced the shape of him with his burning stare, the black so intense that Harry wondered if the man was trying to eat him whole through his gaze alone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>To consume him until there were no barriers between them, the lines lost to the meeting of their minds.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry shuddered despite the sheen of sweat on his brow, his body too hot in the empty room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a sin to be stared at in such a fashion, for a man to come into the church and look upon Harry with those...strange emotions swirling in his eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But was it truly a sin to be looked at? Men and women of all sorts came into the church and had stared at Harry as he spoke, their eyes catching his own as he looked to them all patiently. What made this man so different? What made the sight of this man, once a teen that Harry and the church had cared for, such a threat?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man had never done anything untoward. In fact, he was always perfectly courteous and kind when he’d attend mass to take the blood and flesh of Christ.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everyone knew who the man was. A popular, rich young man that had lived a troubled life in the slums of London before he had come into his riches. An inheritance that no one in the church had been aware of. They had all assumed that the dirt-ridden teenager they had led inside all those years ago was an orphan; his parents long since dead and poor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But that had not been the case. The mystery and the theatrics of the whole thing was enough to bring gossip inside even the church’s walls. Harry remembered those weeks vividly, listening but never participating in the gossip as they talked about the mysterious teen that had come into the church, and had disappeared just as quickly as he’d arrived.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His dirty clothes were the only thing left of him when Harry and Dumbledore had come to wake him for breakfast that sunny morning. So it was a miracle, indeed, a gift of God, that the young man had indeed survived all those years ago, growing into a man of prominence and wealth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A man that easily left  the most silver-tongued at a loss for words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry clasped tightly around his rosary, the clacking  of the beads echoing in the silent room, a sharp disturbance in the empty church.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Don’t think of him, Harry…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry reined in his thoughts once more, focusing instead on the prayer he had begun. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He needed to cleanse himself from the impure thoughts that had overtaken him. He needed to wash it all away and come away a brand new man.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>But how am I to cut the head of the serpent when it keeps growing others?</span>
  </em>
  <span> Harry thought, desperation making his lungs tight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry would beg God for forgiveness for his weakness. Would drop to his knees and whip his back raw if it would cleanse him, if it could erase the memory of those sleepless nights where he was tempted to slip into his bed and take his flesh into his hand. Harry wanted to rub his skin until it was raw, to erase all memory of the man’s touch in the fantasies Harry’s own traitorous mind concocted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry would do anything to free himself from this...lust. Anything and all that was required, he’d gladly do it. He couldn’t live like this. Not when he was a man of the cloth. Not when he was meant to be the champion of the light; to steer the masses away from the sultry calls of the devil.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry swallowed before renewing his chants, shoving aside the guilt and the shame burning deep in the pit of his stomach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint—,” Harry said before he was abruptly stopped in the middle of his prayers by the sound of the church door opening several meters at his back.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Who could it be? Surely no churchgoer would be out this late in the evening…?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry slowly rose from his kneeling position, his trembling fingers pocketing his rosary before turning to face the newcomer, curious and concerned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry felt all the color drain from his face at seeing the very man he had strived to erase from his mind all evening. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom Marvolo Riddle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The young man that had crept into Harry’s life and thoroughly shaken it from its foundation. Why was he even here at all? Were Harry’s thoughts enough to bring the man over? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s nervousness swelled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello, Father Potter,” Tom said, stepping further into the room through the aisle at the center of the modest church.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This church wasn’t the most posh or opulent church in all of London; it was perhaps one of the smallest in the area. A simple chapel that let in the homeless and those that were in need of a guiding hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a place Harry had purposely transferred to after spending years studying the scriptures in Rome. There was just something about being close to the people, something about extending a hand to those that were at their lowest and helping them up, that Harry just found satisfying. In Rome, the kindness, although genuine, was extended in much more different ways, but it simply did not allow him the opportunity to know the families that came in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was an intimate connection Harry wanted to form; a better way to truly bring God into their lives.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Especially when most of his visitors were not from rich and influential families, but homeless men, women, and children seeking advice and a warm meal after spending days out in the blistering cold. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Though why Tom Riddle was standing right at the end of the aisle was a whole other matter. The man was finely dressed, his dark shirt and trousers blending into the shadows the light from the candles could not reach. His hair was as dark as his attire, the curls at the top of his head brushed to the side and styled into submission. It was a stark contrast to Harry’s own messy hair, but that was hardly a surprise. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>While Harry was wild and lively, Tom was the complete opposite. He was beautiful, yet his skin was remarkably pale. Like carved bone rather than the warm, golden hue of Harry’s skin. It was unnerving how inhuman Tom looked, but that was not the sole reason for Harry’s unease. It was merely one of many varying reasons.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For one, Tom was excruciatingly beautiful. Almost inhumanly so. His aristocratic, soft features were framed nicely by the curl that fell on his forehead despite how immaculately styled his hair always was and his pale skin gleamed beneath the orange glow of candles, the only semblance of color that bled into the man’s skin. And if that all were not enough to draw a shiver up Harry’s spine, the man’s eyes were an intense, bottomless pit of black.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The lids were framed by dark lashes that softened the intensity in the man’s eyes; the calculation and the coldness there not as frightening as it would be without it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry wished he was blind to it all. The man’s beauty led him down too many dangerous paths to be normal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello, Tom. What can I do for you today? It is awfully late for anyone to be out in the streets,” Harry said, stepping away from the altar to meet the young man right at the center of the church. His footsteps echoed on the hollow floorboards, and Harry tried not to think too hard on the fact that they were both alone. The notion enough to make his stomach twist when his thoughts again began to fixate on the way the shadows danced along Tom’s cheeks...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry cut the thought off immediately, chastising himself for his failing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was not a thought a man of the cloth should have. These were not thoughts Harry should harbor for another </span>
  <em>
    <span>person. </span>
  </em>
  <span>It was a sin. He couldn’t allow himself to be tempted by the mere presence of this man.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry had to resist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“...I have been restless, Father. I needed to come to church to sort through my thoughts. To put a name to the ills that have been plaguing me,” Tom said.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry felt concern tug at his heart, his unease momentarily dispelled at the contrite look on Riddle’s face. Harry felt some of his anxiousness settle at the sight, the familiarity of routine taking hold in that instant. For all his reservations with Riddle, Harry could never turn his back on someone in need. It was why he was a clergyman.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yes, Riddle did make his skin crawl with strange, inappropriate feelings, but that was on Harry; not on a man seeking guidance. That was no excuse for him to fail in his duties. Even if being under that particularly dark gaze made him feel too self-aware and small, Harry was under an obligation to help and he would see to it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>God would be his strength and his guiding light. Harry just had to have faith.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you like to talk about it, Tom?” Harry asked before he placed a hand on the man’s shoulder, ignoring the way Tom’s heat seeped through the man’s shirt and scalded Harry’s fingers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Father, but no. Being here, at your side, is more than enough.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom’s voice was soft, the cadence ringing in the church like a song. It echoed through the halls and Harry felt his back stiffen when Tom’s dark eyes flickered up to his own.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The black was endless. An abyss that reminded Harry of tales of demons preying on the faithless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>These were the eyes of the devil, but Harry knew that this man was not a demon. The devil could not walk into these walls, could not stand within view of the cross above the altar at his back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, these were the eyes of a man that saw too much. The eyes of a boy that had lived the life of a peasant until God smiled upon him and blessed him with sudden luck.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>But why did he look as if he were trying to eat me whole with his gaze? </span>
  </em>
  <span>A traitorous thought whispered in the back of Harry’s mind. He silenced it as quickly as it came.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, Harry would not think this way of Tom. He could not let his reservations poison his mind; for his own failings as a man of God to besmirch the man’s name. Tom was </span>
  <em>
    <span>good man.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>If only Harry could convince himself of that. If only he could silence the whisper of dread and unease, of discomfort and anticipation that danced along his spine at just being in the man’s presence. These feelings were strong, but Harry could not let himself be swayed. He was a man of the cloth, he was here to help and to provide guidance to those that sought it. He would not fail. He could not fail his Lord and Savior.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom was seeking an understanding ear. Nothing more. That was all it would be. And for this, Harry would do everything within his power to do just that. Harry could not reject him. Though that did not stop his emotions from screaming at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>He is just a regular man, Harry, get ahold of yourself.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>It was several seconds before Harry finally found the wherewithal to speak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“...Of course, Tom. Do you mind if I return to my prayers? I usually reserve this time to speak to God,” Harry inquired, watching how Tom’s pleasant expression melted into one of curiosity. His black eyes were swirling with some unnamed emotion and Harry tried rigorously to not get caught in the tides.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom’s lips twisted into a small smile that made Harry uncomfortably hot in his priest garb. “Please go on, I love when you give your sermons during mass. You have a way with words, Father. They are compelling, and give life to the passages that you read,” Tom stated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry felt flustered, and he quickly turned away, all too aware of how awkward he was being. But he couldn’t help himself. No one had ever complimented his sermons in such a fashion before. He was still young and inexperienced compared to Father Dumbledore and all the other more seasoned clergymen.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>And it was Tom that complimented you...</span>
  </em>
  <span>A voice hissed in the back of his mind, but Harry ignored it. He refused to give it even a centimeter of attention.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“T-thank you,” Harry stammered before heading back to the aisle just several meters away and kneeling back on the ground to renew his prayers. Harry could feel the man’s eyes at the back of his head, but he tried his best to ignore the sensation. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then it struck him, just as he was preparing to speak, that this was a test from God. It could not have been any more clear. God worked in mysterious ways, and this was surely another one of his Lord’s ways of leading him to success.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry removed his rosary from his pocket, and twined the beads between his fingers as he spoke. “I am laid low in the dust; preserve my life according to your word. I gave an account of my ways and you answered me; teach me your decrees.”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His hands were hot and clammy, his brow wet with strain, but Harry ignored how his body reacted to the man’s presence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was supposed to be a moment between God and himself. Tom was simply watching and testing his resolve. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Harry could overcome this, he could overcome it all. If he could ignore the way his spine sang with excitement at being beneath those eyes, Harry knew that God would smile upon him. He could free himself from this strange desire--from this bizarre affair that had begun the moment the teen he had taken in those years ago had returned a brand new man, rich and beautiful. The complete antithesis of what Harry had seen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cause me to understand the way of your precepts, that I may meditate on your wonderful deeds,” Harry whispered, eyes closing shut when he heard Tom’s footsteps in the chapel, the sound growing louder and louder the nearer the man came to where he kneeled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry tried not to think of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“M-my soul is weary with sorrow; strengthen me according to your word.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nearly stopped when he heard the footsteps stop behind his prostrate form, the shifting of clothes the only sound in the still room as Harry tried to control the trembling in his shoulders. He could feel the heat radiating from Tom’s body, his own spine tense as he forced himself to remain perfectly still.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Don’t think about it, Harry. Pretend he is not there. Think of the Lord. Remember His strength and the power in His mandates...</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Keep me from deceitful ways; be gracious to me and teach me your la—” Harry gasped, swiveling around when he felt something trail from the base of his spine and up to the nape of his neck. It was cold, like ice. The touch so manifestly different from the warm air in the chapel that Harry could have sworn death itself had slid its fingers along each vertebrae.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But there was no one there. The chapel was barren, the door at the far end completely ajar.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom had left.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>But when had the man left? </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry shivered, his fingers clasping more tightly around the rosary with dread.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Tom had left, then who had touched him?</span>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you alright, Father Potter? You have been looking unwell as of late.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry tensed, his shoulders raising up when he heard an all too familiar baritone speak too  closely behind him. He tried to calm the rapid beating of his heart, to still the shaking of his hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A fruitless endeavor, but one Harry attempted nevertheless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was several moments before Harry had gathered his bearings, satisfied that he no longer resembled a frightened lamb. Harry turned around to address Tom, his smile slipping into place when the man was grinning back at him, the expression making Riddle’s pale face brighten pleasantly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s breath caught, shocked by its sincerity.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah-er, yes, I’m fine. Just been a rough few days, but nothing for you to be concerned with,” Harry replied, wincing at just how awkward he sounded in that second. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was just as terrible, if not worse, than the time he had spilled juice all over his white robes right before he’d needed to deliver a sermon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The disappointed stare of one of the clergymen had been enough to stain his cheeks red for the rest of the festivities. It hadn’t been a pleasant day, especially when one of the clergymen, Father Snape, kept glaring at him throughout the whole thing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As if Harry’s presence offended him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nightmares?” Tom inquired, and Harry grimaced despite himself, unable to hide his expression when the man’s suggestion came too close to the truth for comfort. His dreams were not </span>
  <em>
    <span>precisely </span>
  </em>
  <span>nightmares. It was something far worse. Nightmares, Harry could certainly handle. There was, at least, something he could do to cast aside the fear and nerves running up his brain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But these dreams? Harry would rather take his chances nightmares than the other...more uncomfortable dreams he’d been having. Easily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Y-yes, nightmares. But I’ll be alright, really,” Harry insisted, wanting to change the topic as quickly as possible when Tom cocked a brow at him, curiosity and...something else glittering in his dark eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom’s strange expression melted away into one of worry, his hand pushing into the pocket of his trousers to rummage for something Harry could not see. “If nightmares have been plaguing you, might I suggest something, Father?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was the sound of jingling, metal clanging against metal, before Tom finally removed a golden chain. The metal glimmered faintly beneath the sunlight trickling into the chapel, the chain a stark contrast to the smooth skin of Tom’s hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Harry had to guess, the trinket had to be genuine gold. The way the sunlight caught the jewelry was similar to the expensive reliquaries the chapel kept locked away in the backroom. The items were only to be brought out on special occasions; a tradition incredibly different than the church back in Rome where the elegant regalia was worn almost all hours of the day.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was absurd, really. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then the light caught green, the twinkle drawing Harry’s own emerald gaze, unable to resist the pull. The pendant looked tiny in the palm of Tom’s hand, but Harry could still make out the carved metal, its design deceptively simple.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a plain locket, old and worn, but still in perfectly good condition. There were gems embedded into the back, the emeralds arranged in an “S” that made Harry wonder just who this piece had once belonged to. The “S” could have stood for the name of its previous owner, or perhaps the initials of a loved one, his curiosity flaring to life as he surveyed the trinket.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry didn’t know how long he stared at it, but after moments of drawing blanks as to who this could have belonged to, Harry abandoned the fruitless endeavor and focused instead on the locket as a whole.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It looked priceless and incredibly fragile within Tom’s much strong hand, its matte sheen reminding Harry of the old antique shops he’d seen back in Rome, a myriad of necklaces and chains displayed for the passing pedestrian to see.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This...is an heirloom that belonged to my family. It was said to bring good luck to its wearer. I thought you might have it, Father. Perhaps you’re in need of some luck,” Tom teased, and Harry felt his cheeks flush a bright red.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>A gift? For me?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was at a loss for words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t need to take it if you do not wish to. I understand that this is not something...you’re accustomed to, despite the nature of your work. I will take no offense if you refuse,” Riddle continued, and Harry finally composed himself enough to answer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“N-no, it’s alright. I’ll accept it. I was just a little surprised that you’d give me something of such value to your family,” Harry quickly amended, watching the way Tom’s handsome lips twisted into a pleased grin. There was an emotion smoldering in the back of the man’s eyes, but Harry did not think too hard on it, choosing instead to take the locket from the man’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The brush of skin against skin made something jolt in Harry’s stomach. Harry ignored the way his fingers pulsed from where their hands had touched, and pulled the locket back towards him to look more closely at the heirloom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s assessment had been correct, the pendant was definitely old and expensive. The metal made of solid gold gauging from how malleable the locket was. It could easily break apart if someone were careless with the trinket, and Harry cradled the cold metal in his hand, mindful of this fact.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you like it?” Tom interrupted Harry’s examination and Harry jumped, forgetting completely that the man was still standing in front of him. The chapel having emptied hours earlier, leaving the two of them the last occupants in the room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s beautiful, Tom. Thank you so much for the gift,” Harry said honestly. “I’ll be sure to take good care of it, and hopefully, the locket will definitely do as you promised. I’m holding you to that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom laughed, and Harry could not help but be drawn in by the sound. The timbre was like the sound of children singing in the choirs. It was melodic and crisp, a wholesome tenor that coaxed a laugh out of Harry’s own lips, unable to help himself because Tom’s humor was infectious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am glad you like it, Father. Though, I will warn you. The good luck only works if you wear it. I am afraid I never got it to work with it shoved in my pocket,” Tom quipped, and Harry could not stop himself from smiling further at the good naturedness of the man. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was moments like these that Harry could forget his strange thoughts. A reminder, a testament, that Tom was in fact not a danger at all. Harry was simply projecting his own sins onto the man. And that could not have been any more apparent than in this moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will do,” Harry teased, his fingers curling around the cold metal as tightly as warmth simmered within his gut.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry writhed in his bed, his hands catching onto cotton sheets as he was assailed by a flurry of strange emotions. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His skin felt like it was going to melt from right off his bones, his stomach twisting into knots as he drowned in the strange heat that ate away at all rational thought. All logic and reason abandoned, consumed and devoured by fire laving over sweat-slicked flesh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The locket felt cold against his bare chest, the only source of relief from the flames as he kicked out and tried to regain some semblance of control over himself. But how could he control himself when what felt like a mouth kissed him right at his navel? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The moist heat was enough to rip a startled cry from his lips, and Harry fisted more tightly on the sheets beneath his fingers, unable to do more than that as his body tensed from unseen touches stabbing deep into his skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“W-what is—” Harry arched his back, unable to finish the question when a mouth traveled lower down his stomach and pressed a kiss on his inner thigh, tongue lapping at his sweaty skin. The mouth then sucked the softness inside the hot cavern, teeth suddenly catching on his flesh, eliciting another whimper from Harry’s lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry felt like he would burst into flames. His toes curled from the sensation, no relief to be found. He was like a lit pyre with no means of being put out. The mouth shooting delicious jolts of pleasure up his spine each time he felt the sharp sting of teeth stabbing into his inner thigh.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What is happening to me?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry gasped, his spine bending when the mouth began to kiss a burning path to his throbbing prick. Tears gathered at the corners of his eyes from the sensation, the desire and lust eating at him making him thrust upwards to get more of that mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Please someone stop this…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>But there was no one in the darkness with him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was alone in his bedroom, the moonlight from the open window at the opposite end of the bed providing him with enough light to see for himself that there indeed was no one there at all. There was no real mouth kissing his cock, no real teeth digging into delicate skin. He was by himself, and Harry did not know how to feel about this.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Lord, do not be far from me....</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry cried out when the hot mouth kissed the rosy head of his prick, his moans so loud in the silent room that it was a miracle no one had come in to ask him if he was alright. He didn’t live alone, and it was certainly strange that there was not even the sound of a fist hitting his wall to shut him up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It made him all too aware of the fact that he was alone; no one was there to save him. He truly was at the mercy of this invisible force; his faith the only barrier to the complete collapse of his restraint.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Do not give in to temptation...</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The mouth seared him straight through bone, the heat nestling between his ribs as the pressure shot sparks of adrenaline up his spine. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was cracking from the pressure, his mind befuddled as unseen lips rubbed and tasted at the sensitive skin. Teeth catching on the sensitive flesh of his head for a moment; the touch enough to make Harry’s blood rush to his ears and the world around him fading.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“P-please, stop. I am a man of G—</span>
  <em>
    <span>ah!</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Harry moaned when the mouth engulfed his hard cock completely. It was hot and moist, the sensation driving him wild as his spine arched further; his arms and legs seemingly tied down by the invisible force as the figure began to lick from his glans and down to the base of his cock, the movement agonizingly slow. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry felt his mind begin to break.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>You are my strength…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>And then the mouth began to move, taking Harry’s cock deeper and deeper into its moist heat until there was nowhere else for Harry to move, until there was no sliver of skin where the mouth did not touch. Harry wasn’t even sure if that bliss was a mouth at all, but the semantics mattered little to Harry in that moment; not when the head of Harry’s cock bumped into something inside and the walls surrounding him contracted, throwing him head first into euphoric bliss.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Come quickly to help me…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry tried to drown out the sensation through prayer, to invoke the scriptures to rescue him, but the pleasure was all-consuming; the heat had begun to unravel him, to unmake him completely. There was no deliverance to be found when that mouth slipped up and  back down. No redemption when a tongue teased along the head of Harry’s cock until he was leaking all over his sheets.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was no real mouth to catch all his juices within rosebud lips. There was no tongue to lap up at it, to tease at his cockhole as the imaginary mouth did to drive Harry wild. No, there was no one there at all sitting between Harry’s parted thighs, but it certainly felt like there was. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry felt possessed. Truly and completely out of control. Like a demon was breaking him down only for the thrill of unra</span>
  <span>veling his</span>
  <span> resolve. To drink in the pleasured sounds that tumbled from Harry’s lips each time that mouth sucked him in…</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The Lord is my strength and my shield…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s eyes rolled to the back of his head when teeth suddenly nipped at his head, the whisper of teeth against the sensitive flesh enough to drown him his ecstasy. The world became silent, the only sound in the stagnant air being his heavy breathing and the wet sounds of his cock being stuffed inside a throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>But there was no one there</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Harry thought dizzily, his fingernails biting into the palms of his hands when the mouth nipped at him again, the pain drawing forth a guttural moan from deep within his throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“P-please, Lord, save me…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was begging, but there was no one to answer him. The mouth took him deep inside and played with the soft flesh at the tip of his cock; the grazing of teeth right at the underside as it passed making something build at the base of Harry’s navel.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“P-please, I-I,” Harry felt himself nearing the cliffside; his own understanding of the human body shedding light to what it was that was looming over the horizon.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>No...</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was both thrilled and horrified, his mouth parting to beg once more to be released. To stop the pleasure from twisting his insides, but then the mouth sank teeth into his head. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hard</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Indescribable pain shot up Harry’s spine, and then he came with a sharp cry.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Please, forgive me...</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s eyes rolled to the back of his head from both the pain and pleasure, his mouth splaying open as he splattered over himself and the sheets beneath his bare skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His limbs were shaking from the force of his orgasm; his spine twitching still from the aftershocks despite how desperately his mind wanted to shut down. His body slumped against the bed, the invisible chains holding him down evaporating as exhaustion weighed him down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were tears of frustration gathering at the corners of his eyes, but Harry was too tired to let them fall. His consciousness was fading, the sweet pull of slumber dragging him further and further under. Toward an abyss, an endless black that resembled the intensity of Tom Riddle’s eyes...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry fought against the lull, struggled against the sweet whisper that sounded awfully like Tom crooning for him to sleep, praising him for how </span>
  <em>
    <span>good </span>
  </em>
  <span>he had been, and to simply give in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Harry could not submit to the darkness, not when he had lost himself to the pleasure, to the smooth tongue and sharp teeth that had forced him over the edge. Not when he had given in to pain, an indescribable agony that made his spine jolt and his cock begin to stir at the memory...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry had sinned. The moist residue between his thighs; the stickiness wetting the sheets beneath his legs evidence of what he had done. How could he possibly go to sleep without praying and supplicating to his Lord for what he had done? How could he allow himself to rest when he had defiled both the church and himself in this single instance?</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Forgive me Lord, for my weakness…</span>
  </em>
  <span>Harry thought tiredly, his lip quivering with his desire to cry at the humiliation of it all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His mind begged for forgiveness, the words “</span>
  <em>
    <span>I’m sorry</span>
  </em>
  <span>” chanted over and over within his mind as he fought off the shadows at the corners of his vision. But there was a whisper that lingered, a voice that sounded nothing like his own awashed with delight; a purr that reminded him of just how pleasurable it had been, of how delicious it was to </span>
  <em>
    <span>sin.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>A voice that felt foreign and unknown, yet too familiar as it whispered sweet nothings between each supplication for forgiveness within Harry’s mind. A thought that unearthed the memory of just how pleasurable it had been, how delicious and </span>
  <em>
    <span>fantastic </span>
  </em>
  <span>it was to feel satin lips wrap around him like a fist and befuddle his thoughts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of how he wished he could feel it again, of how he should take his prick into his hand and...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry ignored that voice, guilt consuming him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His chest felt tight from the weight of his actions, the shame and guilt like a sharp blade pressed into his sternum as he drowned in the waves of those conflicted emotions. The locket was was sitting right above his ribcage, but the cold metal was no relief to the disappointment he felt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For the betrayal, for his defeat. The metal felt suffocating, his throat constricted by the chain wrapped around his neck. But it was only fitting that he feel this way. He had failed God and he had failed his church. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He deserved to be punished, and Harry closed his eyes then, the sweet pull of sleep dragging him under.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>My Lord, please forgive me...</span>
  </em>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry dreaded going to sleep. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After the first series of dreams— the first being the most memorable as he woke with his boxers drenched with his...fluids—he’d made it a habit to sleep less. To exhaust himself as best he could by taking on more duties in the church and exercising after he accomplished his tasks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had been very trying, his mind in a haze and unable to give the lively sermons he was known for by his parishioners. But it was a risk Harry was willing to take. He could not allow himself to sink so low that he would become a hypocrite.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry did not study the scriptures, did not beat devotion into his skin, to simply be defeated by such visceral dreams and primal needs. No, Harry refused to give in. He would not be defeated, not when God had armed him with the tools to win.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was the messenger of God. He was the guiding light, the one that stood between total ruin and complete salvation. Harry could not just submit; there was too much at stake. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry had a responsibility to the church, to the word of God, as much as he had a duty to the men, women, and children that walked into His walls. He would do this for them, and for himself. He could resist; he will put trust in his faith. The Lord would not lead him astray.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry sighed before turning his attention to the papers beneath his hands, the words unrecognizable now after spending hours reading through documents. It wasn’t common for Father Dumbledore to make him handle paper; the man was more than aware that Harry blossomed when moving and extending his hand out to those that were fleeing from the mercurial English weather.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But this was a task that Father Dumbledore had specifically given him, and Harry would see it through. Even if it pained him at times to focus his tired gaze ot the man’s distinct penmanship, to circle and insert commentary between the dense writing with his own scrawl.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Dumbledore used print, then perhaps the whole affair would have been done already. But the man wrote in cursive, and that was certainly not easy to decipher. Even after years of working together with the man, Harry just never managed to get the hang of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Father</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Harry froze, his fingers dropping the pen he’d been holding with a loud clatter when he heard a voice that most certainly should </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>be in his bedroom. Swiveling around, Harry gasped when he caught sight of familiar black eyes, the man’s handsome features looking out of place in Harry’s sparsely furnished bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>He shouldn’t be here…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry unconsciously wrapped his hand around the locket, a nervous habit he had picked up after spending weeks with the trinket wrapped around his throat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom had been right when he said that it was good luck. It was almost strange how the most dangerous and risky of issues would disappear from Harry’s life as quickly as they came. Like the rabid dog that had cornered him and had suddenly fallen dead after a flowerpot had fallen on its head, or the violent thief that had nearly bled out after cutting into his own hand when he’d tried to threaten Harry at knife point, several days prior.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was convinced that the Lord had smiled upon him for wearing this gift. For casting aside his reservations of the man that now stood standing within his bedroom, and giving Tom the chance he deserved.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Though now, Harry was unsure if that had been the correct decision. Tom was in his bedroom, the door only a meter away from where the tall man stood. Harry could not leave, not without confronting the man first.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“W-what are you doing here? You’re not supposed to be here, Tom,” Harry stammered, quickly rising to his feet when Tom began to walk nearer to him, Tom’s imposing stature making adrenaline pump through his veins.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you forgotten already, Father? You </span>
  <em>
    <span>summoned </span>
  </em>
  <span>me here,” Tom purred, stopping centimeters from Harry’s shorter height. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry craned his neck to look the man in the eye, to take in the emotions dancing in the dark pools as his lips twisted into an amused grin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“S-summoned? I don’t remember doing anything like that. J-just leave.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His heart was beating a mile a minute when Tom had yet to move. A heavy silence fell between them and Harry rebelled at being submerged. Harry’s mind was hyper-aware of the distance between them; his body practically attuned to each breath Tom released from his mouth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Harry hated it, his blood boiling within his veins at just how weak he was when Tom was involved. Hated how he had to resort to prayers to clear his mind whenever Tom was in the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The Lord is my strength and my shield…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will you really turn me away?” Tom asked. “Cast me aside after I have come all this way for you? When I am in desperate </span>
  <em>
    <span>need </span>
  </em>
  <span>for your companionship?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom sounded hurt, but Harry did not believe the sound for a moment; he could see the mischief dancing within the black eyes, could see the way Tom’s body was practically vibrating with energy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, Tom was not hurt at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then Tom closed the gap between them, his arm wrapping tightly around his waist, while the other threaded into his hair, his fingers pulling so hard on the strands that Harry began to struggle. His arms shot out to be rid of Tom’s burning touch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Don’t</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Tom did not shrink away when Harry landed a hard blow on the man’s shin, or when he buried his fist into the man’s cheek. Tom was immovable and incredibly solid; more a wall than a person made with flesh and blood as Harry continued to kick and punch. Tom was unaffected, as if Harry’s blows were like nagging insects buzzing around his meal. An annoyance, but nothing more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry felt fear twist within his gut, and beneath it all, the familiar tug of excitement right at the edges of the panic.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>My heart trusts in the Lord, and He helps me…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry gasped when the arm tugged him flush against Tom’s chest, the heat of the man’s body burning straight through the thin nightshirt Harry was wearing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“T-tom, what do you think you’re doing!?” Harry strained, his body twisting to escape when a hand carded into Harry’s hair, soft fingers threading through the wild curls, before yanking hard on the strands to force his face unbearably close to the man’s rosy lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry could not help but stare, his fighting instinct tapering off...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helplessly, Harry was drawn into them, the splotch of color on otherwise pale skin like a beacon of light in a sea of black. There was a traitorous thought in the back of his head urging him to lean in—to taste the man’s skin—but Harry held fast, fighting the haze that threatened to overtake him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom leaned in and pressed his lips softly against the corner of Harry’s mouth.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry froze. The distance from Harry’s lips so minute that his arms fell uselessly at his sides at the merest press because </span>
  <em>
    <span>Tom could not possibly be touching him this way</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom whispered in a husky tone, “Fulfilling your needs, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Father</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Don’t think I have not seen the way you look at me…Of how you’re looking at me now with those rich, emerald eyes...broadcasting your illicit desires...”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>My heart leaps for joy, and with my song I praise Him…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“I-I don’t know what you’re t-talking about. Just stop, you can still turn back. You can still protect yourself from the hands of Satan, you can still do what’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>right</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Harry tried, but stopped when Tom began to laugh softly against his skin; the vibrations of the man’s laughter making a spark of desire shoot up Harry’s spine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was afraid...and dancing precariously near the edge of a desire that threatened to devour him whole.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom didn’t seem to listen, instead pressing his lips against Harry’s mouth, savouring the taste whilst simultaneously ignoring Harry’s pleas, the touch lighting something aflame in Harry’s gut.“Is it me that needs protecting or is it you, Father? I don’t care about what is right or wrong. That matters little when you’re shaking like a leaf...” Tom murmured.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry gasped, startled by the softness in the touch and how his spine bent, bliss singing in his blood when Tom laved his tongue against Harry’s bottom lip, the touch questing as Harry tried to settle his wild thoughts. His eyes drawn in by the dark promises in Tom’s eyes as the man kissed him.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>No, I musn’t...</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>But then Tom took his bottom lip between his teeth, the sharp pain enough to drown out the voice of reason urging Harry to resist. Harry opened his mouth, his arms latching onto Tom’s shoulders to press him closer, to draw more ichor from the man’s mouth and drink it. He tasted of dark chocolate and...something else, the flavor rich on Harry’s tongue as he was overwhelmed by the man’s taste.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Yes…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry felt familiar heat coil like squirming serpents in his belly, his eyes closing shut and his body submitting completely to the man that teased and prodded lightly against his own tongue. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry knew this was a sin, could feel the guilt in the back of his mind burning for him to resist and to stop. But Tom felt too good, his mouth tasted better than the most expensive of wines, the dark chocolate bitter and sweet all at once. It was better than the treats the children often brought him when he was leading mass, more wholesome and saccharine, more savory and rich. It was unlike anything Harry had ever tasted before...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry moaned when Tom’s tongue caressed his own, the muscle coaxing his tongue to move as Tom dug his fingernails into the back of Harry’s head to press their faces closer, deepening the kiss.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry </span>
  <em>
    <span>wanted.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The man’s grip on his waist slackened for a moment to slip beneath the shirt, his fingers hot and tantalizing as Harry sucked Tom’s tongue into his mouth. The sound of the man’s pleasured moans spurring Harry to pull the man even closer, to drink the man in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then those fingers were traveling from his lower back and around to his navel, the hot digits drawing a pleased mewl from Harry’s lips. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Please forgive me Lord, but I cannot resist…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry arched his back, a hiss ripped from his lips when Tom dug his nails into the skin, scratching up his belly and to his chest, his fingers resting centimeters beneath the cold locket pressed against his torso.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Touch me, please...</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom then tugged at Harry’s hair and Harry stopped sucking the man’s tongue, giving in completely when Tom sucked Harry’s tongue inside, teeth catching on the delicate skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry whined, pain dancing along his spine as his glasses dipped low on the bridge of his nose. The sharp sting was enough to lift some of the haze that had fallen over his mind, and Harry felt the world suddenly sharpen around him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s shame and panic were immediate, his body seizing up entirely when Tom suddenly pulled his lips away to trail burning kisses down his neck, tongue teasing along the sensitive point underneath his chin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“N-no, stop,” Harry cried out, but then two fingers latched around a nipple and tugged. A shudder of delight pulled at Harry’s navel, and his resistance was swept away by the sparks of electricity shooting up his spine each time Tom flicked his nipple and twisted the hardening nub between his thumb and index finger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t really want me to stop, do you, Father? You want me to </span>
  <em>
    <span>defile </span>
  </em>
  <span>you,” Tom crooned and Harry whimpered when the man yanked hard on his nipple, the pain blending seamlessly with the pleasure burying his lucidity.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I-I—</span>
  <em>
    <span>ah</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All thought fled Harry’s mind when Tom suddenly sank his teeth into his neck, the pain like a blunt knife pushing between one’s ribs; the man’s teeth cutting so deep into his throat that Harry knew he would bruise. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>More...</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry drowned in the pain, his back arching and his head falling to one side to offer more of himself to the man that was breaking him apart. Lost and eaten away by the pleasure that overwhelmed his addled mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“O-oh, please,” Harry gasped, lost to the bliss, not quite sure what he’s pleading for anymore.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom pulled away from his neck to trail a hot tongue around the bruised skin, the gesture so gentle that Harry did not expect pain when Tom stabbed his teeth into the flesh again; the man’s fingers suddenly squeezing his nipple so hard that Harry saw white.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s mind went silent, the pressure that had been burning at his navel finally snapping his control to pieces. He came hard, coming apart in Tom’s hands as a flood of heat drenched his trousers with his seed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fabric was completely ruined, sullied and wet, and Harry’s mouth splayed open in a silent scream as he drowned in the aftershocks of his release.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry breathed harshly through it, his eyes wet with both shame and euphoria. His guilt ate away at him, and Harry felt himself slump in the man’s arms bonelessly; his knees giving out entirely beneath him.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Deliver me from this sin, my Lord. I cannot bear to show my face otherwise…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mm, your Lord cannot save you,” Harry heard Tom whisper into his ear, the hot breath making Harry shiver as the man spoke against his skin. Harry wanted to deny it, to shout and shove the man away for the slight against God, but then his vision swam, suddenly overcome with intense drowsiness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom chuckled into his ear, seemingly sensing Harry’s fruitless struggles, before Tom’s hand tugged at the locket against Harry’s chest lightly and spoke against the shell of Harry’s ear. “He has abandoned you, forsaken you…” The words were muddled, but Harry was not so far gone that he couldn’t understand the heavy implication in the man’s words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“From this day forth, you put your faith... </span>
  <em>
    <span>in me.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry awoke with a start, his face pressed against his desk as he tried to make sense of where he was and when exactly he had fallen asleep. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then the vivid dream that played in the back of his eyes and Harry felt his stomach sink.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Tom Riddle.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry shuddered, recalling the darkness in the man’s gaze and the predatory grin that broke on his face when he kiss him, when his fingers teased at his nipples, and when Harry came undone beneath his hands...</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I’ve been dreaming about Tom Riddle…He’s the invisible figure in my dreams...</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry tried to settle his breathing, to take in much needed air in a more controlled manner even though his heart felt as if it was about to crawl up his throat. It was difficult, considering the kind of dream he had had. The kind of things Tom had said, and Harry had said in turn.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s face felt hot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was several moments before Harry felt his heart settle and his breathing regain a more natural pace. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He still felt hot and uncomfortable where he sat in the room, his neck and lower back achy after falling asleep in such a strange position. But it was markedly better than how he had awoken earlier; the taste of the man’s lips like dark chocolate and that rich taste Harry could not identify…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had only been a dream.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry felt himself relax for a moment before wincing when he noticed the moisture pooled between his thighs, his trousers soiled with his essence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another pair of trousers lost, another sin for which Harry would need to repent for.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry felt frustration swell within his gut. His eyes pricked with tears as he stood up from where’d been sitting to survey the room. He was paranoid, a bit frightened at the idea of Tom somehow popping into his bedroom as he had within Harry’s dream…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But no, Riddle would never appear in his bedroom. It was a simple dream. A nightmare that Satan was forcing upon him to challenge his faith. A temptation to sway him away from the heavenly light.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry would not allow it, he would do whatever it took to remain unaffected. He would resist the allure, even if he’d lost every battle since the invisible person had begun visiting him weeks before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But no more. Harry would not be defeated again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even if the faceless person had turned out to be Riddle. Even if his heart patted harshly within his chest at the thought of seeing the man; of feeling those hot fingers press against his skin and that hot mouth trail kisses along his—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Lord is the strength of his people, a fortress of salvation for this anointed one…</span>
  <em>
    <span>” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Harry prayed, shoving aside the illicit fantasy that had suddenly filtered into his waking thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry would prevail. He had God on his side.</span>
