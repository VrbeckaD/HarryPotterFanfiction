She couldn’t take another moment of all that damn cheer. It was the first day of December and it seemed that overnight all of her coworkers in the Department of the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures had transformed into some kind of demented Christmas elves.  Hermione typically enjoyed Christmas as much as anyone, she wasn’t a Scrooge after all. Unfortunately, the season had become more difficult for her after the war, and this year, well, this year had been the worst. She simply couldn’t see it improving just because it was Christmastime.</p><p> </p><p>With a sigh, Hermione tried to focus her attention on the report that she was writing, but amidst the festive spirit, she couldn’t help but be distracted by thoughts of what a dreadful year 2004 had proven to be.  It started off with her getting dumped on New Year’s Day. She had been dating Theo Nott for nearly seven months, a record for her, and had begun to have feelings for him. She was beginning to think that he may be the right person to spend her life with.  He was intelligent, kind, and interested in being with her because they were intellectual equals who enjoyed the same things. This had drawn her to him because he was nothing like the countless others who wanted to be with her for the fame. Unfortunately, when she’d attempted to confess her feelings, he’d shut her down and told her in no uncertain terms that he wasn’t ready to settle down, and didn’t know if he ever wanted a family at all. </p><p> </p><p>Theo left quickly after that and sent her a long letter the following day.  In the letter, he apologized for leading her on and explained that while he’d grown to care for her deeply, he felt that she deserved someone who wanted the same things that she wanted.  He informed her that he would be leaving the country and taking some time to travel. He ended the letter by saying that she would always have a place in his heart but that she should find someone truly deserving of her love.  </p><p> </p><p>Being dumped so unexpectedly and in the midst of confessing her feelings had been the first event in a series of things that had made her year quite difficult. After that, Crookshanks finally passed away in March.  He’d never been the same since she’d found him after the war but she loved him nonetheless and losing him had been devastating. Then, Ron had gotten married in June. She was happy for him and Susan. They truly seemed perfect for each other.  It wasn’t that she was jealous. It just felt like she was being left behind. As an overachiever who always wanted to be the first to meet every goal, it was difficult to see her friends doing things before her.  </p><p> </p><p>To top it all off, she finally halted attempts to restore her parents’ memories.  She’d been paying a team of mind healers to follow their case and make regular attempts at bringing back their memories.  The healers had tried everything, even some experimental therapies. The latest and most invasive therapy was developed specifically for the Grangers and utilized Hermione’s memories in an attempt to stimulate their minds and help them to recall what had been locked away.   They’d done this all without the Grangers’ knowledge which made it all the more difficult. Finally, acknowledging that they had gone six years without the slightest improvement, Hermione made the difficult decision to leave them alone and allow them to be happily ignorant of her existence as Wendall and Monica Wilkins.   </p><p> </p><p>Now, with Christmas approaching, the year was nearly over and she wanted to crawl into a hole somewhere until she could say goodbye and good riddance to 2004.  After the year that she’d had, she wasn’t up to pretending to be cheerful and festive.  </p><p> </p><p>Deciding that she wasn’t going to get any more work done that day, she did something very un-Hermione-like and headed home early.  Entering her cozy flat, she immediately noticed the package that was sitting on the table in front of her sofa. It stood out because she hadn’t bothered with Christmas decorations and wasn’t planning to, and it happened to be a beautifully wrapped Christmas present.  </p><p> </p><p>Briefly, she wondered if it could be something malicious but immediately dismissed the thought, knowing that her wards would keep anything dangerous out, even things delivered by owl post.  Taking a seat on her sofa, she reached for the box, admiring the wrappings as she placed it in her lap. The paper was a lovely shimmery white with gold foil Christmas trees covering the surface.  The package was topped with a big gold bow with ribbons trailing down the sides.  </p><p> </p><p>Seeing that there wasn’t a card attached, she carefully began to unwrap the paper.  When she’d removed all of it, she folded it neatly and placed it on the sofa next to her before pulling off the lid of the box.  Reaching inside, she drew out the contents. It was a large box made from wood that had been sanded smooth and painted white. Noticing tiny hinges at the seam, she opened it and gasped, her eyes immediately filling with wistful tears.  </p><p> </p><p>A heavy feeling settled in her chest.  It was the bittersweet longing for what she’d lost combined with the happiness that she felt in receiving such a lovely gift.  The white box was actually a beautiful, solid white Advent calendar, the bottom made up of twenty-four tiny numbered drawers, and the top was a carved holiday scene featuring Father Christmas and his reindeer.  It was almost the same as the one she’d had as a child. The calendar that her mum had lovingly filled with small treats and trinkets every year for her to enjoy during the days leading up to Christmas.  </p><p> </p><p>Examining it more closely, Hermione realized that it was an exact replica, the wood carving holding the very same scenes as the one from her childhood.  The only thing missing was the chip in the wood that she’d caused when magic had exploded from her in her excitement about Christmas at age six. She and her parents didn’t have an explanation for what had suddenly sent the calendar flying off of the table that Christmas.  They determined that it must have been placed at the edge and fallen on its own. It wasn’t until Hermione came home for the holidays during her first year at Hogwarts and saw the chip that she realized what had actually happened.    </p><p> </p><p>For a moment, she allowed herself to wonder if somehow it could be from her parents. Could the healers have been wrong? Was it possible that they started to regain some of their memories?</p><p> </p><p>Sighing sadly, a lone tear trickled down her cheek.  She knew that her parents hadn’t sent this. They hadn’t suddenly improved so vastly that they would remember details like this, much less that they even had a daughter.  </p><p> </p><p>Shaking off the melancholy that had settled over her, she turned her attention back to the gorgeous Advent calendar.  Reaching out, she opened the first drawer and felt as if all the air had been sucked from the room. Her eyes immediately welling with tears.  Tears that were filled with longing for what she was missing with her parents at the same time as her heart felt so full that it would burst with happiness. She’d understood what the word bittersweet meant but never before had she felt it so powerfully.  Inside was a small package of fine chocolates from her favorite chocolatier in Switzerland. A shop that she discovered while on a skiing holiday with her parents. These chocolates were her favorite muggle sweet and her mum always made sure that she had them for one of her advent treats.  </p><p> </p><p>Breaking out of her reverie, she realized that there was something else in the drawer.  Pulling it out, she saw that it was a note. Opening it, she read...</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Hermione,  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I wanted a way to make you smile again.  This past year has been incredibly rough for you.  I needed to let you know that someone sees you... I see you.   </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I wracked my brain for a way to give you a truly Happy Christmas.  The kind of Christmas that you deserve. I wanted something that would remind you of those wonderful years that you spent Christmas with your parents, while creating new memories for you, with you. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Hopefully, we can celebrate those happy memories together for years to come, with traditions new and old.   </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Love,  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Father Christmas </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> P.S.  I’ve charmed the drawers so that they can only be opened on their proper day.  Don’t try to get ahead, just enjoy. Please don’t take this as a challenge that needs to be solved.  I promise that you will find out who I am in due time.   </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Stomach full of madly fluttering butterflies and her heart feeling as if it would beat right out of her chest, Hermione turned the note over in her hands.  Searching for something that would identify the sender. She didn’t recognize the handwriting but that wasn’t helpful as there were loads of charms for disguising one’s handwriting. </p><p> </p><p>He... that was another thing.  Although nothing identified the sender as male, and it could possibly be from one of her female friends, she was certain that it was from a man.  It was something that she felt deep in her gut. Though she was a logical person through and through, she had learned to trust her intuition when it was screaming at her so loudly, as it was this time. </p><p> </p><p>Sitting back on her sofa.  Taking a moment to open the package of chocolates and savor the first, decadent bite, Hermione considered what she’d been sent.  Could it possibly be a coincidence that someone sent her the exact Advent calendar that she’d loved as a child and the same chocolates that her parents always bought for her?  One or the other could possibly be coincidental, but not both. She just couldn’t understand how anyone could know these details. She’d never discussed these things with anyone.  Not even her closest friends. Her parents were the only ones who had been privy to these kinds of details and they weren’t in any fit state to reveal it to anyone. How on earth did the mysterious sender know about any of this?</p><p> </p><p>The rest of the evening, Hermione couldn’t get the identity of her mystery man off her mind.  She’d even gone as far as to turn the entire wooden calendar over, examining it closely for any markings that may identify where it had come from.  Finding nothing, no maker’s mark, no store insignia, she finally realized that it had been custom made, not mass-produced.  </p><p> </p><p>This realization brought a return of the warm tingly feeling that she’d gotten while reading the note.  Whoever this was had gone to great lengths to recreate her childhood tradition.</p><p> </p><p>xXx</p><p> </p><p>After a restless night, Hermione groaned as she rolled out of bed.  Then she remembered the calendar and as it was now the morning of December second, she could open the next drawer and find out what it held.  Rushing into the sitting room, she did just that.</p><p> </p><p>Taking several deep breaths in an attempt to calm her nerves, Hermione reached for the drawer.  Opening it, she saw that there was an envelope inside. Again, there was a note but also some sort of certificate.  Looking down at the note, she read...</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Today’s gift isn’t from your past.  It’s a little something to provide warmth on a cold winter’s day.  Skip your usual tea and toast, breakfast awaits you at The Roost. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Slightly confused, Hermione examined the certificate more closely and saw that it was a gift cert from the new muggle style coffee shop in Diagon Alley.  The shop was called The Roost.  </p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>Dressing quickly, but making sure that she looked nice as she realized that she’d been neglecting her appearance lately. Hermione apparated to Diagon Alley. It was quite a cold morning and she shivered lightly when she stopped to gather her bearings.  Looking around, she located the small shop and walked inside.</p><p> </p><p>As she entered The Roost, she was immediately enveloped by the warm air and the delicious aromas of coffee, cinnamon, and vanilla.  The shop was cozy and the atmosphere made her want to sink down into one of the comfortable-looking leather chairs and lose herself in a book.  Promising herself that she would return and do just that one weekend soon, she approached the counter, and was greeted warmly, “Good morning, Ms. Granger, we were told to expect you.  You are to choose anything that you would like. It’s already been taken care of. My name is Sarah and I’m happy to help you.”</p><p> </p><p>Looking at the menu and the delicious looking pastries in the case, Hermione decided that she would pick something that wasn’t typical for her.  This was supposed to be a treat after all. Smiling, she requested, “I’ll have a cinnamon bun and a mocha latte, please.” </p><p> </p><p>Nodding, Sarah told her, “Fantastic choices! The cinnamon buns are especially delicious today!”</p><p> </p><p>Looking on as the barista made the steaming drink and pulled out a fat bun dripping with frosting, Hermione asked, “Can you possibly shed some light on who is responsible for setting this up for me?  Even just a tiny hint? Please!”</p><p> </p><p>Smiling brightly, the young woman shook her head, “I’m sorry but I don’t know.  The owner left instructions, saying to expect you to come by and that we were to treat you well and give you anything, and everything you wanted,” eyes widening with the realization, she exclaimed, “you’ve got yourself some kind of secret admirer!  How exciting and romantic!”</p><p> </p><p>Sighing in disappointment, Hermione mumbled, “Something like that,” before thanking Sarah for her help and turning to leave.  On a whim, she decided that since this was a special breakfast, she would eat at one of the little tables and enjoy the warmth and comfort offered by the shop before heading into work.  </p><p> </p><p>Taking a seat in a secluded corner near a Christmas tree decorated with brightly colored miniature teacups, she took a bite of the cinnamon bun and sighed in delight when the flavors exploded on her tongue.  It was the perfect bun, in her opinion. The pastry was soft and not overly sweet with just the right amount of cinnamon. The sticky frosting on top added just the perfect amount of sweetness. Sipping at her coffee, she decided that she would definitely be back again soon.  This place was amazing.</p><p> </p><p>Arriving at work, Hermione felt differently about the Christmas cheer surrounding her.  Yesterday, it had made her feel claustrophobic, anxious, and slightly angry. Today, she saw everything in a different light.  Smiling when she caught herself humming along with a familiar song, she thought about the note that had come with the first gift and realized that whoever sent her the calendar was already accomplishing the goal of making her happier this Christmas.  </p><p> </p><p>xXx</p><p> </p><p>The next morning, Hermione awoke refreshed and excited to see her gift for the day.  Rushing into the next room, she opened drawer three and read the note first...</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Enjoy the spirit of the season and be a kid again. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Curious now, wondering what could possibly bring out her inner child, she grabbed the tiny envelope that was still in the drawer and shrieked, dropping the package in shock as it magically enlarged once it was free of the small space.  Laughing at herself, she looked inside and actually squealed in delight, Hermione Granger, squealed. Well, she thought to herself, that should count toward being a kid again, right?</p><p> </p><p>The thing that had created such a delightful response was none other than a Christmas themed muggle coloring book and a large box of crayons. Opening the box, she inhaled deeply and felt an overwhelming sense of nostalgia.  The scent of a brand new box of crayons had always made her happy and that hadn’t changed just because she was now an adult.  </p><p> </p><p>Again, her thoughts went to her parents who always added art supplies to her calendar, usually crayons. And to the person who had sent this to her,  whoever he was, somehow knew all of these details. She still couldn’t work out how anyone could possibly know.</p><p> </p><p>Looking at the coloring book and colors, she mournfully set them on her table and went to prepare breakfast.  Desperately wishing that it wasn’t a workday so she could sit and color. Sadly, she had work that day but as it was Friday, she would have the weekend to do whatever she wanted.  Thumbing through the pages as she ate her simple breakfast, she decided that the next morning she would color until her heart was content.  </p><p> </p><p>Waking the next morning she realized happily that it was finally Saturday.  Rising early, as was her habit, she stayed in her pajamas, deciding to have a lazy day.  Looking forward to her plans, she went to see what day four held.  </p><p> </p><p>Opening the box she found a beautiful pure white quill. It was stunning, but she wasn’t sure what kind of bird it would come from.</p><p> </p><p>Glancing at the accompanying note she read...</p><p> </p><p><em> This quill is made from the feather of a swan.  Swans are amazing creatures. When they find a mate, it’s for life. </em>   </p><p> </p><p>Deciding that she wasn’t quite ready to think about the implications of that statement, Hermione admired her lovely quill for a few minutes before putting it away on her desk and moving into the kitchen to prepare breakfast.  After making a pot of tea and a plate of toast, she made herself comfortable in her little kitchen nook and ate breakfast as she set to filling in a picture in her new coloring book.  </p><p> </p><p>Halfway through a cup of tea and a slice of toast, Hermione was so engrossed in her coloring that she didn’t hear her floo roar to life.  When a shadow fell across the page of her coloring book, she instinctively grabbed her wand. A familiar voice made her stop.  </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry I startled you.  I thought you would have heard the floo,” laughed Harry.  </p><p> </p><p>Looking up into his brilliant green eyes, Hermione blushed slightly. A bit embarrassed at being so caught up in a frivolous activity that she failed to hear him arrive, “Well, I didn’t.  I was busy,” she retorted defiantly.  </p><p> </p><p>Harry smirked and asked teasingly, “Coloring, Hermione? Enjoying yourself?”</p><p> </p><p>Relieved that he didn't appear to think it was odd to find her engaged in the childish activity, she responded, “I am actually, want to join me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure, I’d like that,” replied Harry, sliding onto the small bench next to her.</p><p> </p><p>Being close enough to share a single coloring book required Harry to press right up against her.  She felt her heart skip a beat, and her stomach flip as his thigh pressed against hers. This was the way she reacted each time he was close enough for accidental contact.  Which, was a lot. He was her best friend after all. Unfortunately, her feelings were one-sided so, she had to make do with their friendship.  </p><p> </p><p>Taking a moment to calm herself, Hermione finally spoke, “You know that you’re welcome anytime.  I wasn’t expecting you this morning though, did we have plans that slipped my mind?” </p><p> </p><p>Putting down the crayon in his hand, Harry grinned at her, “Nope.  I just had an idea and I wanted you to come with me. Want to finish your breakfast, get dressed, and come have some fun with me?”</p><p> </p><p>Giving Harry and appraising look, she took in his appearance.  He was dressed for comfort and warmth, “What do you have in mind?  Am I going to be cold?”</p><p> </p><p>Laughing, Harry told her, “It’s a surprise, but a good one.  You won’t be cold if you dress warmly. Come on, I promise you’ll have a great time.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I suppose I can go.  I did have big plans to have a lazy day, but maybe I can be persuaded,” she said teasingly, knowing that she could never say no to Harry, unless it involved flying on a broomstick.  </p><p> </p><p>Emerald eyes sparkling, Harry nudged her, “Great! Finish eating then go get ready.”</p><p> </p><p>A short time later, Hermione emerged from her room, freshly showered. She was wearing fleece-lined leggings and a soft, olive green oversized jumper paired with boots that reached her knee.  Grabbing her coat and pulling on her hat she told Harry that she was ready to go.  </p><p> </p><p>Wordlessly, Harry held out a hand.  When she grabbed on, he turned on the spot and she immediately felt the suffocating feeling of apparition before landing in an unfamiliar wooded area. Having been unprepared for apparating, she stumbled a bit.  Harry placed the hand not already holding hers at her waist to steady her. When she was no longer in danger of falling, he led the way out of the trees, never letting go of her hand.  </p><p> </p><p>“Where are we going?”</p><p> </p><p>“So impatient, Hermione,” Harry smiled at her, squeezing her hand.  “You’ll see soon enough. I promise you will love it.”</p><p> </p><p>Huffing in feigned irritation, Hermione allowed him to lead her into what she soon realized was a park.  Looking around, she observed, “This is Hyde Park.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry didn’t acknowledge her statement, simply raising one eyebrow and continuing to walk purposefully forward. Finally, a large ice rink came into view and his steps slowed slightly.  Hermione was thrilled, she loved ice skating. “Thank you for thinking of this! Did I ever tell you how much I love ice skating? I don’t think I’ve mentioned it but this is something that I did with my parents every year at Christmastime.”</p><p>Harry only smiled and led her to the queue to pay admission.  Once they paid, got their skates, and laced them up, they only had to wait ten minutes until it was time for their skate session to begin.  Stepping onto the ice, Hermione quickly found her rhythm. Although she was sadly unathletic, this was something that she had always been good at.  Flying around the ice, the cold wind on her face, it felt wonderful, she felt free.  </p><p> </p><p>Realizing that Harry wasn’t next to her, she glanced back and had to stifle a laugh.  Harry was far behind, gripping the walls of the rink, desperately trying to stay upright.  Skating back to join him she said, “Oh Harry, I’m so sorry. I didn’t realize that you couldn’t skate.  Here, take my hand. I’ll show you.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry gripped her hand firmly and shakily tried to follow her lead.  Patiently, she showed him how to move his feet to glide across the ice properly.  He caught on quickly but didn’t let go of her hand. Instead, they skated slowly around the rink talking, Hermione sharing memories of coming to this very place with her parents and Harry seemingly hanging on every word.  </p><p> </p><p>When their session was over and they returned their skates, Hermione turned to Harry and threw herself into his arms, giving him a tight hug and a kiss on the cheek.  “You have no idea what this meant to me, thank you. I didn’t realize how much I’d missed skating these past years.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry grinned down at her, arms still tight around her body, and replied, “You’re very welcome.  I was a little nervous because I’d never done this before, but I have to admit that I really had a great time.  I would love to come with you again sometime. If not this winter, maybe we can come back next year at Christmastime and make it a yearly tradition.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione’s stomach gave an involuntary flutter at the talk of plans for next year.  Mentally shaking herself for allowing those kinds of thoughts, even momentarily, she reminded herself that this was Harry, her best friend.  He didn’t think of her that way. This was just a fun activity for them, just like the countless others had been.  </p><p> </p><p>Harry finally released her and asked, “Do you have plans for the rest of the day?”</p><p> </p><p>Shaking her head, Hermione responded, “No, why?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I was thinking that we could grab some lunch, and then I have one more thing in mind if you’re up for it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Lunch sounds great, soup would be especially good to warm up.  What other activity are you thinking?”</p><p> </p><p>“Soup we can do, the other thing is a surprise.  Be patient.”</p><p> </p><p>Rolling her eyes, she allowed Harry to lead her through the park to a small café where they warmed up with delicious french onion soup followed by creamy hot chocolate.  When they’d both had their fill, Harry paid the bill, refusing Hermione’s offer to pay for it since he’d paid for the skating. When the bill was settled, they walked out and Harry led the way into a nearby alley where he once again held out his hand for Hermione.  Prepared for the sudden apparition this time, Hermione landed without incident.  </p><p> </p><p>The scent hit her first, the overwhelming scent of pine-covered in fresh snow.  It was a scent that triggered another memory of her parents. Every year, they had gone together as a family to a tree farm that allowed people to cut down their own trees.  Looking around, Hermione realized that she was standing at the edge of that tree farm. The very same one that her family had frequented year after year.  </p><p> </p><p>“Harry,” she breathed out, the threat of tears pricking her eyes and causing her voice to shake a little as she continued, “how could you possibly know?”</p><p> </p><p>Looking at her with a concerned expression Harry asked, “Know what?”</p><p> </p><p>“Know that this is where I came every year with my parents to get our tree.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled kindly at her, meeting her eyes but shrugging his shoulders evasively, “I noticed that you didn’t have a tree, so I thought we could get you one and then go back to your place to decorate it.  Is that okay? I didn’t upset you, did I?”</p><p> </p><p>Noticing the equivocation, but deciding to ignore it, for now, Hermione shook her head, “I’m not upset. It just caught me off guard.  Between skating and this, I have so many memories of my parents and it’s just making me feel emotional. It’s not bad, just a little bittersweet.  I miss them so much, but I know that what I did kept them safe and I’m enjoying sharing these things and my memories with you. Thank you, I’m glad you thought of this.  Now, come on. I want to show you how to pick out the perfect tree.”</p><p> </p><p>Once Hermione found what she deemed the perfect tree, they cut it down the muggle way, Hermione insisting that they couldn’t use magic.  Then they made their way to the attendant to pay, Hermione refusing to allow Harry to pay this time as it was her tree. Harry tried to argue that it was his idea, but she held firm and paid the attendant herself.  Carrying the tree between them, Hermione allowed Harry to covertly cast a featherlight charm after checking to make sure they weren’t being watched. Then they made their way to an area safe for apparition. Once secluded, Harry shrunk the tree down and held it in one hand while offering the other to Hermione for side-along.  </p><p> </p><p>When they arrived back at her flat, Harry immediately asked where she wanted the tree.  They chose the perfect spot and set it up. Then Hermione went off to retrieve the decorations from a storage cupboard.  When she returned, Harry was examining the Advent calendar. “Where did this come from? I’ve never seen it here before, and you didn’t have any other decorations out. Why this one?”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione immediately felt disappointed.   After today, she’d begun to hope that maybe it had been Harry that sent the calendar.  Forcing a smile, she explained what it was and that it had been sent by a secret admirer of sorts.</p><p> </p><p>“So, you don’t have any idea who sent it?”</p><p> </p><p>Shaking her head, Hermione replied, “No, I really don’t.  I didn’t tell anyone about any of these things. I can’t understand how someone could know.  Would I have felt it if someone used Legilimancy on me? I really hope that’s not how this person got the information, I would feel extremely violated.”</p><p> </p><p>Shaking his head Harry interrupted, “Your mental shields are far too advanced for someone to break into your mind undetected.  You would have had to be thinking about something at the precise moment that they used Legilimency on you for you to not notice and even then, you would feel something.  No, I don’t think that’s the case here. I’m curious about this mystery man though. Think you may be willing to give him a shot?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know.  It would depend on who he is, and how he got this information.  It’s all very sweet, and I love what I’ve gotten so far. I just can’t help but wonder how on earth someone knows all of those things, those details about my life with my family.  It’s a little disconcerting.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry stepped closer and put an arm around her, drawing her into his side, “Hey, it’s going to be okay.  I promise that I’ll always be here for you and I won’t let anything happen to you. If you start to feel uncomfortable, I can even come and sleep on your sofa or you can move into Grimmauld.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks, Harry.  I really appreciate it, but I’m sure that having me as a roommate wouldn’t exactly be good for your love life.  I’m fine for now. If I start to feel uncomfortable or unsafe, I’ll let you know.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry was looking at her with a strange expression, eyebrows raised into his fringe, “In case you haven’t noticed, my so-called love life is nonexistent.  You don’t need to worry about that. You are the most important person in my life. You are the person who has stuck by me through it all. Don’t ever think that you can’t ask me for anything because if it’s in my power to make it happen, I will.”</p><p> </p><p>Not knowing what to say to that, Hermione simply hugged her friend tightly.  He wrapped both arms around her and pulled her in more snugly. Sighing, Hermione realized how right this felt, how at home she felt in his arms.  She wished he felt the same way about her. It would make everything so much easier.  </p><p> </p><p>Pulling away, Hermione asked, “Ready to decorate my tree?”</p><p> </p><p>At Harry’s answering nod, Hermione grabbed the box of decorations.  As they hung the lights, tinsel, and ornaments, Hermione told Harry stories about each ornament.  When she’d gone to her childhood home after the war, she found that it had been ransacked and most of the contents were destroyed in what she assumed had been the death eater’s search for any information on her whereabouts.  There hadn’t been much to salvage but Hermione found a box of special ornaments tucked into a corner of the attic that had thankfully remained intact. These ornaments were very special to her, not only for the memories but because they were quite literally some of the few possessions from that life that she still had.  </p><p> </p><p>As Hermione spoke about past Christmases with her parents, she realized that she had been speaking continuously while Harry remained silent.  Turning to apologize, she saw him watching her intently, an unreadable expression on his face. Suddenly a thought occurred to her, “Oh, I’m so sorry, here I am going on and on about what I’ve lost and the memories that I have with my family and you didn’t get to experience any of that with your parents.  I’m being incredibly selfish, I’m really sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>Shaking his head, he pulled her into a hug, and spoke into her hair, “No, you aren’t being selfish.  I promise I enjoy hearing all about what you did with your parents. Of course, I wish that I’d had mine around but honestly, I love listening to your stories.  I didn’t have that growing up but I hope to one day have a family of my own to do those things with and I like to hear about the traditions of other families so I can file the information away to use later.”</p><p> </p><p>Hearing Harry speak about the family that he hoped to have one day created confusing emotions in Hermione.  She, of course, wanted him to be happy, but selfishly, she didn’t want him to find that happiness with some random woman.  Fleetingly, she wondered if they would be able to maintain their friendship as it was once he was in a relationship. Forcing herself to stop thinking that way before she became dispirited, she smiled up at Harry and suggested that they should get back to the tree.</p><p> </p><p>When the tree was decorated and the room put to rights, Hermione asked Harry if he wanted to stay for dinner.  At his answering nod, she got out a stack of take-away menus and told him to pick something. When he immediately chose pizza without looking at any of the other options, she laughed, rolling her eyes at his predictability, and told him that pizza sounded fabulous to her.</p><p> </p><p>After dinner, which they lingered over, talking more about things that Hermione did with her parents growing up, and more about what Harry experienced at the Dursleys, Harry finally left when it was nearly midnight.  It had been nice to spend the day with him. She’d been planning to be alone all day, but he had shown up and made it so much nicer.  </p><p> </p><p>Tired, but restless. She drew a bubble bath and poured a glass of wine, hoping to relax before bed.  Sinking into the luxurious foam, she allowed her mind to wander a bit. Drifting back until she was alone in the tent with Harry again after Ron left them.  It was then that the comforting touch of a friend had turned into much more and when they made love, it had been a first for both of them. Over the following weeks until Ron’s eventual return they had been together in every sense of the word.  Hermione had fallen deeply in love with her best friend and though they hadn’t spoken the words aloud, she’d thought that he shared her feelings.  </p><p> </p><p>When Ron came back, Harry had retreated, backed off completely and she hadn’t had the opportunity to speak to him alone or ask him how he was feeling, what he was thinking.  Confused, she began to believe that it must not have meant the same thing to him as it did to her. Then, in the aftermath of the final battle, sitting down to a meal with the grieving Weasley family, Ron had taken her hand and announced to his family that they were together now.  Seeing the joy on Mrs. Weasley’s face, she hadn’t had the heart to tell them that it wasn’t true.  </p><p> </p><p>After that announcement, Harry had clapped Ron on the back and told him how happy he was for the two of them.  Assuming that he simply wasn’t interested in her that way, Hermione didn’t attempt a private conversation with him.  Instead, she quietly informed Ron that she was sorry for any confusion but she couldn’t be in a relationship with him.  She felt only friendship and knew that they could never be compatible romantically.  </p><p> </p><p>After that conversation, she had fled the Burrow, leaving England completely to search for her parents.  Harry and Ron had both tried to go with her but she insisted that this was something that she needed to do by herself.  </p><p> </p><p>Traveling to Australia, alone and grieving for those they had lost and saddened that Harry didn’t return her feelings, Hermione eventually found her parents.  When every attempt to restore their memories failed, she returned to England, deciding that she would go back to Hogwarts to finally take her seventh year and sit her N.E.W.T.s.  </p><p> </p><p>Upon her return, she was surprised to find that Harry and Ginny hadn’t resumed their relationship.  In her devastation over the failure to restore her parents’ memories, she never thought to question Harry, instead, she quietly returned to Hogwarts with Ginny while Harry and Ron joined the Aurors.  </p><p> </p><p>Hermione became aware that her water had grown cold. Sighing deeply, she drained the water and stepped from the tub. It was then she had the sudden realization that Harry hadn’t just failed to get back with Ginny, he hadn’t really dated at all. When he needed a date for a ministry function, she typically accompanied him.  He spoke tonight about wanting a family but didn’t seem to be making any attempts to make that happen. She knew that she wanted more than anything to create that family with him because even now, seven years after that time they spent together as lovers, she was madly in love with him.  </p><p> </p>
