    <p>“I really don't think this is a good idea, Harry.”</p>
<p>After the war, Hermione thought she would be done once and for all being the voice of reason among her friends. But when Harry decided to follow Draco Malfoy down Knockturn Alley while the Weasleys were off on holiday visiting Charlie in Macedonia, Hermione regressed to her childhood state as the know-it-all mum friend who tried to reason with everyone.</p>
<p>“Obviously he's up to something, Hermione,” Harry turned to her. “We stood up for the prat at his trial, but he's still up to his old tricks. After all we did for him…”</p>
<p>Hermione scowled and crossed her arms over her chest as Harry started off in the same direction Draco had ventured. She knew it was foolish to let Harry go into Knockturn Alley without any backup, so she followed behind him. Just as she caught up with him, he came to a sudden halt, causing her to crash into him. He grabbed her forearm to steady her so she didn't fall. Much to her surprise, Draco slipped into Borgin and Burke’s. Trying not to draw any attention to themselves, the two of them crept into the shop and hid among the various shelves that housed more Dark objects than Hermione cared to be around after spending a whole year hunting horcruxes. </p>
<p>“… your father’s collection…”</p>
<p>“… trying to clean it up…”</p>
<p>“… very, very expensive, Mr. Malfoy…”</p>
<p>Harry, while trying to listen in to Draco’s conversation with Arcturus Burke, bumped into a shelf. A case clattered to the floor as Burke disappeared into the back of the shop and Malfoy turned, glaring at the two of them.</p>
<p>“Eavesdropping again, Potter?” he sneered. “I thought you would have learned.”</p>
<p>“I could say the same of you, Malfoy,” Harry retorted. </p>
<p>Hermione rolled her eyes and shot Harry a look. “Please, you're acting like children. If you two could just get over yourselves for two minutes…” she muttered as she bent over and picked up the box that had fallen. When she did, it clicked open, and nestled in a bed of black velvet was a time-turner. Her eyes brightened; she hadn't seen a time-turner since they had all been destroyed during the battle in the Department of Mysteries. But upon further examination, it became obvious that the time-turner she now was examining was no ordinary device. </p>
<p>For starters, it was silver instead of the typical gold. It seemed expensive, as there were little emeralds inlaid in it, which was a strange feature for a time-turner.</p>
<p>“Merlin, Granger, didn't anyone ever tell you not to touch anything in this store?” Draco huffed as he tugged the box from her hands. The sudden, jerky motion caused the time-turner to tumble from its spot, only to land in between the three of them. They all reached for it at the exact same time, and as soon as they did, Hermione knew something was wrong. </p>
<p>The windows in the rickety old shop began to rattle, and the floor began to shake. They all tried to move away from each other, but they were unable to move, as if they were stuck to the floor. Harry and Hermione exchanged horrified looks before turning their attention back to the small silver device on the floor. The time-turner glowed on the floor and began to float, its chain wrapping around the three of them before it erupted in a burst of blinding light that swallowed them all. </p>
<p>It was unlike any sensation Hermione had ever experienced in her life. She felt like she was being warmed from the inside, but not in a pleasant, fire-whiskey sort of way, but in more of a Merlin’s-beard-did-I-eat-an-asteroid sort of way. It felt like her insides were being melted down and rearranged as the world seemed to fall away from her. She couldn't see Harry or Draco, but judging from the sounds of screaming around her she imagined they were feeling the same things she was. </p>
<p>If they lived and didn't lose their minds or something equally tragic in the process, she wouldn't hesitate to tell Harry “I told you so” about following Draco down Knockturn Alley.</p>
<p>But the likelihood of any of them living to see the light of day seemed to be fading by the minute as the burning feeling subsided into a dangerously fast falling sensation. Hermione fumbled for her wand, even though her muscles ached from the earlier sensation.</p>
<p>“<i>Arresto Momentum</i>!" she managed, causing them to land softly on the ground. </p>
<p>They all were slow to get up, and Hermione groaned slightly as she sat up. As she looked around, she realized they were definitely somewhere in Diagon Alley, but she wasn't quite sure where. Also, the time-turner had disappeared. </p>
<p>Draco was the first to get up, dusting himself off with a grumble. “The next time I see Burke, I'm going to give him a piece of my mind,” he huffed. “Keeping something like that out on display!” His muttering and complaining faded into the background as Hermione got to her feet and wandered out of the alleyway. It was nighttime, and the streets were all but abandoned. As someone who had experience with time-turners and therefore had read about time-turner accidents before, she knew the first thing to do when you didn't know when you were was to get something that would have a date on it, like a newspaper or a letter. </p>
<p>Finding a paper didn't prove very difficult, as one drifted down the sidewalk of the main thoroughfare. Hermione snatched it, but dropped it as soon as she read the date: </p>
<p>23 November, 1948.</p>
<p>“Hermione, what is it?” Harry ran up behind her. “Hermione, what's wrong?” </p>
<p>She shook her head and began to think. It was 1948. What was going on then? World War II was over in the muggle world. The Cold War was just beginning for the Americans, and Attlee was Prime Minister of Great Britain. Dumbledore had defeated Grindelwald in the wizarding world and had begun to gain a reputation with the Ministry. And what… what was Voldemort up to? Surely he wasn't much older than they were in 1948. Hermione shuddered at the thought of encountering him.</p>
<p>“Granger, what the bloody hell is the matter?” Draco huffed. </p>
<p>“We… We went back in time,” she said. </p>
<p>“Well, obviously,” he rolled his eyes. “We must have gone back just a few hours to the previous evening—“</p>
<p>“I'm afraid not,” Hermione sighed. “It's 1948. The time-turner sent us back fifty years.”</p>
<p>“You're bluffing.”</p>
<p>Hermione frowned and pointed out ads for old broomsticks in the Quidditch Supplies Shop. Draco spluttered in shock and Harry frowned. “You're thinking exactly what I'm thinking, aren't you?” she asked him. Being one of his best friends, she knew how Harry’s mind worked. And he would immediately think about how the greatest threat the wizarding world has ever seen was a young man right now.</p>
<p>“He's twenty-one going on twenty-two right now,” Harry told her. “If what I've learned since the war ended is right, he'd be a shop-boy at Borgin and Burke’s right now. And… I think he only has two horcruxes. The diary and the ring.”</p>
<p>When Draco realized who they were talking about, he paled. “You mean the Dark Lord? He's alive right now?” he hissed.</p>
<p>“Yes, and he's going by Tom Riddle publicly,” Hermione stated. “Not many people know about Lord Voldemort now. He won't surface until… oh, 1960 or so? When Riddle’s in his thirties?” She looked to Harry who nodded in confirmation. </p>
<p>“He is, but Hermione… what are we going to do until we have a plan? We haven't any money or a place to stay,” he reminded. </p>
<p>The reality of that set in and she felt a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach.</p>
<p>“What do you mean we haven't any money?” Draco snorted. “We've got Gringotts, and I have the Malfoy Family Ring. The goblins serve whoever has that ring regardless; they've been doing it that way since my grandfather.” Harry and Hermione were both shocked, but Draco probably figured they needed to stick together if they were to make it back.</p>
<p>“Who's also our age right now,” Harry stated. “I've got a couple sickles. That should get us a room for the night at the Leaky Cauldron.” Hermione nodded in agreement; she had some spending money as well, and she imagined they would have to put it to good use if they planned on blending in. Draco’s robes probably were suitable for the time period, but she and Harry were both in muggle clothes, and Hermione was certain that no one was ready to see young people in jumpers and jeans. </p>
<p>They headed off in the direction of the Leaky Cauldron, and the proprietor didn't bat an eye at a young witch and two wizards needing a room for the night. </p>
<p>When they got upstairs, Hermione cast a quick Scourgify on the sheets and blankets. Much to her horror, the three of them would be sharing a king-sized bed. Nether Draco nor Harry seemed very pleased about the current living arrangements, but as the room was sparsely furnished, they simply grumbled. </p>
<p>“We’ll come up with a plan tomorrow,” she decided as she shamelessly stripped down to her undershirt and knickers before climbing into bed. “After we do a little shopping.”</p>
<p>“Shopping?” Harry asked incredulously as he undressed down to his t-shirt and boxers. Hermione didn't feel weird about sharing a bed with him and scooted toward the middle to make room for him. </p>
<p>“Our clothes will draw attention to us, which means Riddle will probably suspicious if we turn up in Borgin and Burke’s. We’ll also need a cover story, since we’re clearly magical but didn't go to school with him,” she explained. Draco nodded and was blushing slightly as he undressed down to his boxers and got into bed as well. Hermione could honestly say she had never had such strange bedfellows before. </p>
<p>“I'll try to get into my family vault tomorrow as well,” Draco told them as he climbed in on the other side of Hermione. “Erm, well… goodnight, Potter. Granger.”</p>
<p>“Goodnight, Malfoy,” Harry and Hermione stated before turning off the lights.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>The next morning, Hermione almost forgot where she was until she realized she had two young men practically draped over her. Harry had drooled on his pillow, and Draco was snoring softly as she gently pushed them away from her and climbed out of bed. </p>
<p>They really were back in time.</p>
<p>A maid delivered the morning’s paper and Hermione sat down to read it while sipping her tea. It was rather boring; nothing exciting or noteworthy was really happening in the wizarding world. </p>
<p>Once Harry and Draco were around they discussed their stories before they left for the day. They had devised a tale that they were all pure-blooded cousins from a wizarding family in France. Harry and Hermione were siblings, while Draco was their cousin on their mother’s side.  Since the French didn't track pure-blooded families and names as passionately as their British counterparts, they selected two different surnames and just went with it. Harry and Hermione assumed the surname Moreau, while Draco became Draco Chevalier. Once it was decided, they made their way to their first stop of the day which was Gringotts. Draco went in, and was gone for what seemed like hours. When he returned, he had a smug grin on his face and a pouch full of galleons. </p>
<p>“Are you sure no one will realize it's missing?” Harry asked. </p>
<p>“Certainly,” he replied. “It's funny; they thought I was my grandfather, so I just let them believe it. Strange time, this is.” Hermione snorted and started off in the direction of Madame Malkin’s, only to be stopped by Draco. “Oh no. If you want to be convincing when you go into Borgin and Burke’s, you won't want plain old robes from Madame Malkin’s. Well, those are fine for Potter, I suppose. But most pure-blooded witches don't shop there.”</p>
<p>“And just where do they shop, Malfoy?” she raised a brow.</p>
<p>“Twilfitt and Tatting’s,” he answered. “A favorite of my mother’s and my grandmother before her. Considering Druella Rosier went to school with the Dar—Riddle, I imagine it exists now. And as the main financier of this expedition, I want my money to go where I want it to go. So Potter,” he handed him some coins, “go get measurements at Malkin’s. I'll take Hermione to Tatting’s and get her settled before coming back to you.”</p>
<p>“And what makes you think you can give me orders, Malfoy?” Harry hissed.</p>
<p>“I'm the one with the money, so therefore I'm the one with the power,” he retorted. “And it's Chevalier now; best start getting used to keeping up pretenses, Moreau.” </p>
<p>Hermione knew he was right, so she shot Harry a pleading look and he reluctantly agreed. They then parted ways, with Draco taking her to a very high-end shop ran by a fussy woman who was undoubtedly a pure-blood witch who didn't need to bother working. Draco left a fair sum of money with Hermione, who was currently being berated about her hair, before he left to get his own measurements taken. </p>
<p>“Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful!” the older witch scolded. “A few charms and potions and you might pass for a lovely little thing!” Hermione tried her best not to get offended, and let the witch get to work. </p>
<p>“Um, no green,” Hermione stated as the witch pulled a bolt of emerald green fabric. She already had a few robes being made with magic, and Hermione liked the colors of them; a burgundy, and a cheery yellow, along with a light grey, and pink. </p>
<p>“Why not? It would look very becoming on you,” the witch pointed out. </p>
<p>Hermione had to remind herself momentarily that Hermione Moreau had attended Beauxbatons, and therefore did not care about silly Hogwarts rivalries. “Very well,” she sighed. </p>
<p>When she left, the sets of robes that had been made for her were boxed and wrapped, and Hermione paid with the galleons Draco had given her. Between the shoes and the gowns, he had given her just enough to pay for it all. She wondered how much Narcissa Malfoy’s wardrobe cost back in the nineties, but the mere thought made her head spin. </p>
<p>She wore a royal blue day dress out with matching shoes, and found the boys wearing new robes as well when she exited the shop.</p>
<p>“This is much better. We blend in,” she said.</p>
<p>“Well, we would if you did something with that hair,” Draco snorted. Hermione noticed that even Harry had gone about taming his normally wild hair, and she bit her lip. Madame Primpernelle’s was just down the street, and Hermione knew she could get Sleekeazy’s and some makeup there, but she didn't want to be anymore of a burden to Draco. She then remembered her own money in her purse, and fished out the galleon and few sickles. </p>
<p>With a fair few charms and the frustration of Madame Primpernelle herself, Hermione emerged from the shop looking more like a proper 1940s young woman. Her lips were painted a cool shade of red, and her hair was styled in easy waves. </p>
<p>“Okay, so now we look the part,” Harry decided. “But how do we get to Riddle? We can't just waltz into Borgin and Burke’s. Besides, I'm fairly sure he's a Legilimens at this point.”</p>
<p>“Well, we need a reason for being over here,” Hermione said as they sat down at Florean Fortescue’s Ice-Cream Parlor. She thought for a moment after ordering a scoop of Granny Smith ice cream. Her eyes landed on a man reading the <i>Daily Prophet</i>; a small snippet of it declared that the Quidditch team, Puddlemire United, had suffered a loss of a Seeker and were in London looking for a replacement. “Harry! That's it!” she pointed at the article. “You and Draco can both try out for Puddlemire United! If anyone asks, you came from France to play Quidditch.”</p>
<p>Both boys exchanged looks, and found that the story was clever, so they went off to buy new brooms and equipment. The try-outs were slated for the weekend, which gave them about two-and-a-half days to get ready for them. </p>
<p>Harry found a place to practice flying on the broomstick he bought, which he complained was like trying to fly a muggle stove because It was so slow. Still, he took to flying as he always had, and was brushed up in no time. Draco was the same way, and Hermione imagined they would enjoy themselves at try-outs come Saturday. They would just have to lay low until then, and wait until their plans became more certain before confronting Tom Riddle.</p>
<p>After flying around for the better half of the afternoon, the boys returned to the Leaky Cauldron with Hermione for supper. They were served a hearty stew and butterbeer, and began to eat their meal in comfortable silence when a voice at the bar forced them all to freeze. While it was free of the raspiness it would later have, the soft baritone was easily recognizable. Draco’s spoon clattered into his bowl and the three exchanged glances, not wanting to turn around and draw attention to themselves. </p>
<p>“… it's been a long day, so a shot of fire-whiskey, please,” the voice purred. </p>
<p>Hermione had never taken the Dark Lord to be a man with vices beyond murder and torture, and her curiosity got the best of her, so she turned. </p>
<p>Whatever she had been expecting, he certainly was not. He was tall (not that the Voldemort of her own time hadn't been, but she had never noticed nor cared), with broad shoulders and a narrow waist. Riddle already carried himself with an air of superiority that was not typical of a shop-boy. From the back, she couldn't get a good sense of how he styled his hair but it seemed wavy and soft. Part of her wanted him to turn at least to the side so she could see his profile, but she didn't want to risk him catching her staring.</p>
<p>“Was he a handsome bloke, Harry?” she whispered to him as she continued to stare against her better judgment. Harry shrugged.</p>
<p>“Dunno,” he admitted. “I suppose if you're into that tall, dark, and brooding thing, perhaps.”</p>
<p>Hermione had always been a sucker for those types, as far as literature went. As a young teenager, she had adored the solemn, sullen heroes of classic literature; Austen’s Mr. Darcy, Charlotte Bronte’s Mr. Rochester, and her sister’s Heathcliff. Of course, in real life she had been drawn to a more… Mr. Bingley sort of man, so she supposed she only liked those types if they were purely fictional. </p>
<p>But when Riddle turned around, it took all of her strength not to gawk. He looked like a movie star. In fact, he reminded her of her grandmother's favorite actor in his younger years, Sir Laurence Olivier. Before he caught her, she turned around and moved her spoon through her stew absentmindedly. </p>
<p>“Are you blushing?” Draco asked before he snuck a peek for himself. “Merlin’s beard.”</p>
<p>Hermione realized then that Harry was the only one who had ever seen a good-looking—no, normal-looking, she corrected herself—version of Voldemort before. All Draco had ever seen was the serpentine demon from the future, same as Hermione. She found herself thinking it was a real shame that he did such a thing, but Hermione imagined he didn't care in his madness. </p>
<p>“I don't think I've ever seen you lot in here.” </p>
<p>The three of them all froze, and Hermione hoped that Riddle assumed he had just startled them. Harry was the one to turn then, and he sneered at Riddle.</p>
<p>“Do you make it your business to know everyone else's business?” he inquired.</p>
<p>Hermione shot Harry a look before meeting Riddle’s gaze. She immediately wished she hadn't, as the deep, dark orbs that had fixed on her were almost hypnotic. Her mind was screaming at her to speak, but her mouth seemed incapable of forming words.</p>
<p>“I apologize,” she eventually stated. “My brother isn't always good with strangers. I'm sure he meant no offense. And you're correct in assuming you haven't seen us here before as you wouldn't have. We've just come from Amiens, France. My brother and my cousin intend to try out for an English Quidditch team.”</p>
<p>“Your English is very good for not being from here,” he quipped. </p>
<p>“Our <i>au pair</i> was English,” Draco explained smoothly. Riddle seemed unimpressed by his response, but didn't push it. </p>
<p>Riddle turned to walk out and while the boys were seemingly satisfied by getting out of an encounter alive, Hermione was a little irked by him. She had expected a greater challenge when they first met him; not just some prying asshole in the middle of a pub.</p>
<p>“Pardon, but I don't think I caught your name?” she called after him. </p>
<p>He stopped in the doorway and turned, a smirk playing at the corners of his lips. </p>
<p>“Tom Riddle,” he supplied. “And you are?”</p>
<p>“Hermione Moreau.”</p>
<p>“Well, Miss Moreau, it was… charming to meet you,” he stated. “Best try and stay warm; you'll find winters here can be rightfully unpleasant. Wouldn't want someone like yourself to become any more… frigid… than you already are.” Without another word, he walked out. Hermione gaped at him and the boys weren't sure whether to laugh or be absolutely terrified.</p>
<p>Lord Voldemort himself had basically called Hermione a frigid bitch.</p>
<p>Harry wasn't sure if the Dark Lord had a death wish, but he knew that Hermione was not going to let that one go.</p>
