  <b>Chapter One: The Death Of One Harry Potter</b>
</p><p>The quiet atmosphere of Privet Drive was broken on a warm sunny by the shrill scream of one of the residents. Mrs Williams, of number 3 Privet Drive was off to see her neighbor and friend, Mrs Dursley of number 4 Privet Drive. She dully took note if Mr Dursley's car still sitting in the driveway though she had thought Mr Dursley and his son Dudley were going to take a trip for the next week or so.</p><p>She shrugged off the thoughts and continued to the front door. Mrs Williams had been wanting to borrow the delinquent nephew it was apart of her new movement to try to rehabilitate the young boy. At the front door Mrs. Williams barely touched the door with her small thin hand when it slowly creaked open. And poor Mrs Williams was forced to discover young Dudley Dursley crumbled bloody body in the hallway.</p><p>Mrs Williams ran and returned home calling the police in hysterics as she desperately tried to describe what she had stumbled upon. By this time the rest of the street was stumbling outside their homes drawn by Mrs Williams cries.</p><p>"It was their dreadful nephew." Mrs Williams had declared when asked who could have done it. She neglected to mention how she'd been on her way to the Dursley household just for a chance to have said boy being able to do yard work at her house. </p><p>It didn't take long for Number Four of Privet Drive to become the center of activity as police and ambulances surrounded it along with the small neighborhood. Somewhere in the house a cry of <em> "there's one still alive!" </em> that had the neighbors perking up wondering who could have survived.</p><p>The EMTs came out pushing a stretcher out with the small bloody form of one Harry Potter on it. The neighbors watched in horror as the ambulance lit up and the question of who could have done it rang in their heads as the boy was driven away.</p><p>No one noticed that someone from their neighborhood didn't belong. Her dark eyes wide with disbelief as her hair flared through different colors. She turned on her heels and disappeared off to report the news.</p><hr/><p>It was nearing midnight when Harry Potter woke up to a loud bang of thunder. A light summer storm rolled in the early afternoon and slowly got worse as the day rolled by. It didn't matter to him, he'd been sleeping infrequently and rarely since Sirius' death, the nightmares of Cedric and Sirius blending in together caused sleep to evade Harry.</p><p>Only a week at Dursleys since the end of the school year and Harry didn't want to be anywhere else. Maybe it was self isolation or even self punishment that he chose to stay here after all that had happened. Even Dumbledore had been willing to let him stay at Hogwarts during the summer, unwilling to let the broken boy out of his sight.</p><p>Harry stumbled out of bed, the house was eerily quiet. It was then a sense of wrongness settled over Harry, he couldn't even hear Uncle Vernon's snores. Harry tiptoed to the door pressing his ear to it desperate to hear something. Vernon and Dudley were to leave tomorrow morning and he knew that they would like to get their sleep for the long drive to Aunt Marjorie's home.</p><p>Holding his breath, Harry pressed closer to the door, and faintly he could hear the sound of someone sobbing. He jerked away from the door. Who was it that was crying? Or had he imagined it? Dread settling in his stomach, Harry approached the door again, and pressed his ear against it again. This time he was sure he heard someone crying.</p><p>Now seemingly melding with the bedroom door, Harry could hear the faint sound of someone rummaging through things. Were they being robbed? But why? The Dursleys weren't particularly rich, most things were bought at a discount and often times slightly used. Harry knew this only because he was raised in the household, and Aunt Petunia often had fights with Uncle Vernon about it. </p><p>Harry carefully made his way back to his bed, avoiding the floor boards that had a habit of squeaking. He wasn't going to be able to help stuck up here in his room. Harry couldn't save them just like he couldn't save Cedric or Sirius, the Dursleys had a higher chance of living than Cedric or Sirius did. </p><p>Time seemed to drag on, what felt like hours were mere minutes later where a high pitch scream sounded. Harry jumped, green eyes wide as he stared at the door, that had sounded like Aunt Petunia. What faintly sounded like a fight came through the door. Harry's heart plummeted to his stomach that didn't sound good.</p><p>The following screams were deafening.</p><hr/><p>Detective Anthonio Smith entered the humble dwelling of the Dursleys, blood maring the walls and floor. What had seemingly started out as a simple robbery had gone wrong quickly, at least that was what his partner thought. He was still in the process of trying to figure out what had happened. The seemingly nice family had some dark secrets starting off with the smallest bedroom and all the locks on the door.</p><p>It had started like it always did, asking the neighbors about the family, all pointing out how nice the family was and how much of a delinquent that one Harry Potter was. The only survivor of the brutal attack. </p><p>The sour scent of an alpha on the cusp of rut hung heavy in the air, the only reason it seemed to get out of hand. </p><p>He ignored the downstairs and made his way up to where the rooms were and was greeted with a broken down door. The surviving victim was found here, raped and badly beaten. He'd been barely alive and had the first responders believing him dead until the coroner checked him out. Any longer and they would have four dead victims rather than three. </p><p>"Right old mess here." Said one Harvey Jenkins, Antonio's partner. </p><p>"Yeah, wonder how they were targeted. There were nicer and newer looking cars out in front of a few other houses." Antonio said. "And a few of them even empty. If you're going to rob a house wouldn't one of them be better?"</p><p>"Neighbors said the family was about to leave on vacation."</p><p>"No, that was only Vernon and Dudley Dursley that were leaving." Antonio said, his dark eyes flashing. Nothing made sense, and the brutalization doesn't speak of strangers."</p><p>Harvey scratched at his beard, a patching thing that was better off to be shaved then continue growing. "So you think they were targeted for a reason."</p><p>Antonio shrugged, unable to answer. The robbery aspect wasn't sitting right with him, not when nothing appeared to be missing despite all the mess. </p><p>The room was small barely big enough for the small twin bed and the desk that was shoved under a window with bars on it. There was a large puddle of blood and he had to wonder how the poor boy survived, with white chalk outline where they boy laid.</p><p>In his minds eye he could still picture Me Potter  laying crumpled, curled up slightly as if to ward off the pain. It had been clear that Mr. Potter had been raped and left to die, or had they thought he was dead? Antonio shifted on his heels, everything about this room sat uncomfortably in his gut.</p><p>"What do you think the bars on the window are for?"</p><p>"To keep intruders out, what else?" Harvey said in a dismissive tone. He was busy flipping through the pictures of the downstairs murders.</p><p>Antonio turned to Harvey, "But only on this window? That wouldn't be very effective now would it?"</p><p>Harvey barely spared him a glance. "Then it was obviously to keep the boy in. You heard the neighbors the boy was nothing but trouble." </p><p>Standing, Antonio shrugged. The bars on the window on top of the many locks on the bedroom door were suspicious. Mr Potter while having the rumors of being a delinquent in the neighborhood had no record of one, more alarming was how he disappeared after his eleventh birthday only to reappear during summer break. Had he been the actual intended victim and the Dursleys paid the price.</p><p>"I'm heading back downstairs, let me know when you're done here." Harvey said, turning and heading downstairs to see if they had missed any evidence.</p><p>Antonio glanced around the room, at the destroyed door, the blood marks and the bars on the window. Something was missing, he knew it and if he could just figure out what it was this case would fly right open.</p><p>The bedroom door caught his eye, it hadn't been touched since Mr Potter had been rescued. It looked like it had been blasted off the hinges, but no trace evidence of explosives had been found. Reaching out, Antonio turned it to one side, and froze.</p><p>The marking of a skull with a snake slithering out if the mouth looked like it had been burned in the hardwood. All his thoughts of this being anything but a random attack seemed more and more likely. Now all he had to die was convince his partner of his opinion.</p><hr/><p>Harry glanced at the barred up window, he had no way to escape. But more horrifying, how come no one was coming to check up on them? Someone must have heard the screaming that was happening, and yet not one curious neighbor.</p><p>It dawned on Harry, the only way that no one was coming to check was if there were wards around the house that wouldn't allow sounds to escape. Harry stood up quickly, eyeing the door. That had to be impossible right? Professor Dumbledore told him that there were Order members watching the house. </p><p>He turned to the window, climbing into the desk. Yanking it open, he was barely able to fit his hand through it, it jammed. Uncle Vernon had made comments about not wanting owls to be coming to the house. They'll been rerouted to Mrs. Figgs. Even more to make sure that there would be no more owls was the bars replaced after his first escape. </p><p>Tears gather in his eyes, would he risk it? Yelling and hoping that an Order member was standing close by? But if there was then they'd would have heard the screaming downstairs that was getting louder. </p><p>Harry slipped off the desk, hopelessness choking him. He didn't even have his wand to protect himself, locked away in the cupboard under the stairs. Even more of his self isolation, he hadn't even wanted to touch it or work on his summer homework, sure that he'd be collected sometime during the summer like it had happened for years.</p><p>Harry looked around the smallest room of Number Four, trying to anything that could be used as a weapon. He knew that the bed frame had some parts that he could use as a weapon. Harry hadn't before gone without a fight, and today would be no different. </p><p>Harry inched his way underneath the bed, his fingers finding a loose bed rung. Harry began to let it off hoping that it would be enough to protect himself or at least hurt the wizards downstairs. </p><p>Harry laid under the thin blanket that he was only allowed to have. The springs of the bed dug into his side, and Harry's heart was racing. The screaming had stopped and he tried not thinking about what that could mean.</p><p>The stairs began to creak under heavy footsteps as tears finally escaped his eyes. His chest felt heavy, and every breath caught in his throat. Harry tried to bring stop the shuddering cries that built in his throat as the footsteps stopped in front of his door.</p><hr/><p>Minerva McGonagall stalked the halls of the hospital, the harsh stench of bleach clogging her throat. She'd been given the run around for the last few hours, having arrived shortly after Tonks had been able to report what happened to the Order. Of course it had been her to go as his head of house, and Severus Snape was busy.</p><p>Dumbledore had merely shoved some falsified documents showing her as the temporary guardian of Harry Potter and sent Minerva on her way. </p><p>She could still remember the blazing anger that had lit up in Dumbledore's eyes at the news that the Dursley home had been attacked. How quickly everyone turned to Severus as if to verify the very information that was handed to them, only to see the man not standing in the corner. Severus had warned of Lord Voldemort's desire to test the boundaries of how far he could go with Harry, ever since he had used Harry's blood to revive himself. It had been why the Order had been keeping such a close eye on the Dursley's home, they were going to remove Harry soon from the home. And clearly that failed.</p><p>Minerva had made her way back to the information desk, where the nurse behind the desk kept giving her the run around or waving her off completely. She was growing impatient, and worried to learn something about the boy, something so that she could go report it to Dumbledore and figure out a new plan to protect the boy while also making sure that Lord Voldemort wouldn't be able to get his hands on the boy.</p><p>She was pleased to note that it was a new nurse sitting behind the desk, younger than the previous. Minerva went and towered over the woman, glaring down from her nose.</p><p>"Excuse me." Minerva said in her frustrated professor voice, the one that always had the kids jumping and shaking in fear. She was pleased to note the nurse began shaking like a first year also. "I'm here in regards to one Harry Potter."</p><p>"A-Are you family?" She asked, and the small badge on her shirt gave the name Carlina. </p><p>"I am a Professor at the school the boy goes to, I've been made aware of the situation with his family, and am here to take care of him." It was best if Minerva was able to take Harry back to Hogwarts where he'd be better taken care of.</p><p>Carlina nodded and began typing "I'm sorry, it appears that he is still in surgery." </p><p>Minerva bit back the anger that wanted to spill from her lips and marched over to sit in hard uncomfortable chair. She watched dully as two men came up to the information desk, to be quickly pointed to a direction. She sat up straighter aware of the small badges that marked them as some Aurors from the Muggle world.</p><p>Another hour crawled by before a heavy set doctor in scrubs approached her. His hair was thinning, and wrinkles had over taken his face. He gave her a glance over, no emotions in his eyes.</p><p>"Are you for a Mr Harry Potter?" He said, glancing at the small pile of documents in his hands.</p><p>Minerva stood up quickly, finally getting somewhere. "Yes." </p><p>He  jerked his head in a direction, walking them to a corner. Isolated. Dread settled in Minerva's stomach, it could not be a good sign that they were somewhat dragged away from the other patrons. </p><p>The doctor flipped through the file in his hands again, and in an almost bored tone said, "I'm sorry to inform you of one Mr. Harry Potter's death. Please see the nurse to see about collecting his belongings." He briefly gave her shoulder a squeeze before turning away completely and walking away.</p><p>Minerva had barely been able to say anything as tears gathered in her eyes. It couldn't be.</p><hr/><p> </p>
