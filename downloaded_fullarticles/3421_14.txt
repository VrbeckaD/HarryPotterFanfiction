    <p>Cisco didn’t forget anything, that was an effect of his powers. </p><p>He had stopped writing things down to remember them where it got to the point of not only remembering timelines, but remembering <em>everything</em>. </p><p>The only disadvantage that it had for Cisco, was that there were things he didn’t want to remember, and he couldn’t use “I forgot” as an excuse.</p><p>... which he was trying to do now.</p><p>Julian stared at Cisco with an annoyed look in his eyes.</p><p>”You forgot our anniversary? Cisco- Any other person in the world would be able to use that as an excuse- you simply don’t forget things.”</p><p>Cisco sighed and pulled out the box of expensive chocolates that he knew Julian liked. “I wanted to surprise you and that was the first thing out of my mouth.”</p><p>Julian looked surprised and snorted, moving from behind the desk to kiss Cisco’s cheek gently. “Well, I’m surprised, I’ll give you that.”</p><p>Cisco grinned and kissed Julian gently.</p>
