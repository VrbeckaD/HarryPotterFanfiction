It had been a lovely day off for them both -- they were still on call, but they'd managed to get at least today off together. It had started with a lazy morning and breakfast in bed before they headed out to a holiday market. They'd had lunch at a pub and shared a pastry at a cafe.</p><p>They'd seen the skating rink advertised in their apartment building's lobby and since it had been close to the cafe, they decided it was a good way to end the day.</p><p>Draco pulled on Harry's arms and they collided, just barely avoiding a fall.
