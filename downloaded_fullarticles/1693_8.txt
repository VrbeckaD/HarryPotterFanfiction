    <p>Months had passed since the beginning of the school year, and each day Severus Snape felt more and more tense. He had always wanted the Defense against the Dark Arts position, despite the fact that it was cursed. He knew that these children would need a real teacher, one that would show them how to defend themselves. There was a war coming after all.</p>
<p>Instead they had gotten worthless teacher after worthless teacher. A stuttering buffoon, a fake, a werewolf, a death eater, and the pink toad. The only one who seemed to give any care was the werewolf, but even then it didn't seem to be enough. They were woefully unprepared.</p>
<p>He had decided to change that.</p>
<p>He knew that the students were not happy about him teaching DADA, but it was something they had to get over. He was just as strict as he had been when he taught potions, but that didn’t matter to him. All that mattered was forcing this information into their brains.</p>
<p>He found himself during the months, growing accustomed to the blank stares, and though it aggravated him to no end, he understood. Between Voldemort and Dumbledore, they were woefully unprepared.</p>
<p>All except one.</p>
<p>Hermione Granger.</p>
<p>When she was younger she would wave her hand, so eager to answer, to get his approval. He had been that student in his own time in hogwarts. Had longed for the approval of someone, so he had been as obnoxious as she had been. He had been bullied for his intelligence, that as well as his relationship and partentage. His being a know it all had not helped.</p>
<p>He told himself that was the reason he was harsh with her, in his own way he was trying to help her.</p>
<p>This year, he welcomed her knowing all the answers. It helped the other students. And merlin knew they would need all the help they could get. Especially next year…</p>
<p>Severus forced his thoughts away from the future, for the reality of what he had to do. He couldn't bear the thought, but he had to do this, had to push through. He had to atone for his sins. That meant protecting her child from the Dark Lord, in every way.</p>
<p>“Professor?”</p>
<p>Snape looked up to see the best friend of the very boy his mind had drifted to, her curly hair pulled into a ponytail, the band straining to contain the mass of her hair.</p>
<p>He stared at her for a minute, his mind having forgotten he had told her to come tonight. He looked at the clock, noticing that she was five minutes early.</p>
<p>Of course she was.</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Granger, come in” he replied not bothing to get up from his desk. He watched her, moving towards him, obviously confused.</p>
<p>“You asked me to come tonight? Is there something wrong with my essay?” she asked, her eyes shining with concern.</p>
<p>Of course she was afraid of that. The Dark Lord was back, her friend was dealing with the monster getting into his head, she was a member of the Order of the Phoenix, facing the very real chance of dying in the next year or so, and she was worried about her grades.</p>
<p>“No, nothing is wrong with your essay, it was fine” he drew out the word, amused that she was unable to stop herself from wincing. He was certain it got under her skin, the word bouroughing into her bones. “I asked you here for a lesson” he got up from his chair and walked around the desk, looking down at her. “I assume Mr. Potter has informed you of our lessons?”</p>
<p>“Yes Professor”</p>
<p>Snape looked down his nose at her, assessing her. He knew that Dumbledore would not approve of this, but it was the only way he could think of the boy actually being able to learn. Hermione could teach him better than he could, if only because he trusted her.</p>
<p>“Mr. Potter is a lousy study and has allowed his own negative feelings about me--” he paused “--to cloud his ability to retain what I teach him.”</p>
<p>Hermione opened her mouth to say something, probably an attempt to defend her friend but he cut her off with a look.</p>
<p>“That is where you come in Miss Granger.”</p>
<p>“Me sir?”</p>
<p>“For whatever reason, Potter trust you, respects you even. He is more likely to retain the information if it comes from you.”</p>
<p>“But I don’t know ho-”</p>
<p>“That is why you are here. I plan on teaching you.”</p>
<p>He could see the hesitation in her face. He wondered briefly if him being able to read her so well was a sign of how poorly these lessons would go.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure that is a good idea sir…” she said the words carefully, as if she was tiptoeing through a room full of glass, trying not to cut her feet.</p>
<p>“Are you afraid of your failure?” He supposed the good thing about Hermione is he knew how to push her buttons, the question of her intelligence always spurred her into action “I suppose I can understand, after all, Defense against the Dark Arts is what you are weakest at.”</p>
<p>There. There was the fire he sought, he could practically feel her anger coming off her in waves.</p>
<p>“Fine” she snapped the word, lifting her chin up and squaring her shoulders “Teach me professor.”</p>
<p>Snape hummed his acknowledgement, gesturing for her to take a seat as he explained to her in great detail how to shield her mind, to build up a wall to hide everything she didn’t want him to see. Then came the fun part.</p>
<p>The first time he entered her mind, it was like slicing through a cloud. She didn’t resist at all, much to his annoyance. He managed to view memories of her childhood, christmas’s with her parents, turning the family cat blue with accidental magic. He could feel her attempting to push him away, but it felt like a light breeze.</p>
<p>He moved from her mind, letting her gather herself. It was the first time, she would surely be better at this the second. He again explained to her how to defend her mind before he again used the spell.</p>
<p>This time it was more challenging, though still not as good as he would like. Her defense was not a wall as he had mentioned to her, but a fog. It rolled around him, hiding access to her memories.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was not thick enough.</p>
<p>He found himself frustrated, this girl was supposed to be the brightest of her age. Didn’t she understand what was at stake? In his annoyance he went through her mind, pulling memories he knew she would not want him to have access to. He could feel her tensing as he dived deeper and deeper inside her mind. Her first kiss, Ron rejecting her, her crush on the worthless fraud from her second year. These memories were getting harder and hard to get to, and he could feel her, fighting against him the further he got.</p>
<p>Still, he did not withdraw. The dark Lord wouldn’t, and she needed to understand that, so that Potter would understand. This was not a game.<br/>
He found it, the memory that she hid as hard as she could. He could feel her screaming at him, trying so hard to push him away, but it wasn't enough. He watched the memory unfurl before him.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it wasn't a memory… but a dream. He stared as he watched Hermione Granger in his own classroom, her eyes down cast, as if she were ashamed. The scene unfurled before him, his own form coming into view, standing over her slight form.</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure what he was expecting, but for the scene turn to carnal desire was nowhere near his list.</p>
<p>He felt her pounding against him then, and he let her push him out, shocked at the fact that this girl lusted after him.</p>
<p>They stood in silence, the tension thick in the air. Neither of them spoke for several minutes. Finally, she broke the silence, gathering her gryffindor bravery.</p>
<p>“Prof-” she started</p>
<p>“<em>Out</em>.”</p>
<p>It was a command, not a request. His voice was firm, unforgiving. She stood still, staring at him with those wide eyes, unmoving.</p>
<p>“<em>Get</em>. <em>Out</em>.” he ground out the words, watching as she finally took a step back before she turned tail and ran, her courage apparently fading.</p>
<p>He wasn't sure how long he stood there, staring after her, the scene playing over and over in his head.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath, trying to calm himself, the unfairness of this whole situation consuming him.</p>
<p>How sad was it that a woman finally desired him, after all these years, and by the time he could legally take her up on any desire they might share, she would hate him. She would know him as nothing but a murderer, a monster.</p>
<p>His life truly was shit.</p>
