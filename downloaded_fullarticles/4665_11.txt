    <p>Looking back at his decision, jumping through the veil after Sirius probably wasn't the smartest decision Harry had ever made. Actually, it was without a doubt the dumbest thing Harry could have done but he was so consumed by grief and confusion that his mind didn't even register what he'd done until it was too late. Yes, his brain registered his actions about half a second before he fell through the veil after his godfather. Yes, much too late because he was already falling and then there was nothing.</p>
<p>Darkness; darkness was all Harry knew from that point but it was a surreal darkness. Was this the afterlife? Was this what he could expect for the rest of eternity? Nothing?</p>
<p>There were no sounds, no sights, nothing that caused his senses to pick up anything and somehow the sheer lack of surroundings was enough to put his senses into overload out of desperation to attach themselves to something, anything. The desperation to see, hear, feel, smell or taste something was almost crippling. Harry felt himself flailing, his mouth opening as he attempted to scream, but there was no sound.</p>
<p>Was this how his parents were existing? Sirius? Cedric?</p>
<p>Just as Harry was about to accept this as his fate, he felt himself falling and he felt himself automatically close his eyes and draw his arms close to his chest. All at once, Harry registered that he was now laying on something very soft and he felt warm and comfortable. His breathing was even and he could hear things; birds chirping, feet shuffling across a floor and... was somebody snoring? At a time like this? But it sounded far away.</p>
<p>Harry opened his eyes and found himself very confused by his surroundings. The first thing his eyes were drawn to was the moonlight streaming in from a window on the other side of the room. The next thing he noticed was bars in front of him; it looked like something you'd see in a jail movie but that didn't make sense. Glancing around the room. he could make out what looked like a rocking chair and toys? It was hard to tell because of how dark the room was, his only source of light was the moon and a small jar on the other side of the room which was softly glowing different shades of green, blue and yellow.</p>
<p>The more Harry glanced around, the more he could make out; there was a dresser, a mat, a bookshelf and... As he glanced around the room, he found himself overwhelmed by fatigue. He wasn't sure why but for some reason, he was exhausted and before he could come up with an explanation for his current situation, he was fast asleep.</p>
<p>***LINEBREAK***</p>
<p>Waking up again, he still felt like he was laying on something soft and he now felt warm all over; it felt like Harry was laying in bed. Maybe the whole thing at the ministry had been a nightmare and he was back in the Gryffindor common room. But this bed felt different somehow. Maybe he was in the hospital wing. At least he wasn't dead.</p>
<p>Opening his eyes, Harry found that he was in the same room as he was earlier but the only difference being, the room was now lit by bright rays of sunshine. If he was confused about his environment last night when he couldn't see it, he was completely confused now that he could see everything.</p>
<p>This was a nursery; a green and yellow nursery. There were toys in a bin, toys on a window sill, a yellow dresser, a green change table stocked with nappies and clothes. If that wasn't confusing enough, the fact that he was obviously in a crib certainly was. He was fifteen, almost sixteen, why was he lying in a crib? Harry sat up and looked around the room, this crib was really tall because even sitting up he couldn't see over the bars.</p>
<p>Just as Harry tried to focus his eyes on the things on the dresser, he felt a sudden warmth; it was strange, he wasn't sure why he was feeling the warmth and it was spreading. It wasn't until he registered the wetness that he realised what it was... No! He hadn't just done what he thought he had just done. But another burst of warmth confirmed it. As horrifying as that realisation was, he found himself wondering why he hadn't realised he needed to pee until he was already peeing.</p>
<p>Why was this happening? What was going on? Everything was so confusing and overwhelming and now he was peeing on himself? Harry couldn't remember the last time he had peed anywhere other than a toilet or bucket in his cupboard.</p>
<p>Soon enough Harry's thoughts were cut off when the door to the nursery opened and Severus Snape walked into the room wearing... pyjamas? If Harry wasn't so distressed by his current situation, he would have laughed at the sight of his feared potions master wearing pyjamas. And if the pyjamas weren't odd enough to see, the smile certainly was. It was like the man was happy to see Harry. Harry felt himself flush, of all the scenarios for his professor to walk in on, him wetting himself was the worst imaginable; next to walking into Potions class completely naked.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Harry! Did you sleep well?" Professor Snape asked Harry, he was wearing a smile and it looked genuine.</p>
<p>Harry found himself glancing curiously at the man who had always been scowling or yelling in all of his memories and to see the man addressing him like this was curious indeed. He wondered if the man was under a spell or something. Had someone cast the imperious on Snape?</p>
<p>Harry glanced down at the blanket that was still covering him, it was green and yellow knitted blanket and wondered just how soft it was. He brought his hand over to touch it and found himself alarmed by how tiny his hand was. That wasn't his hand, that was the hand of a baby! Throwing the blanket off, he found himself looking at a babies legs, feet, body and... this was a dream, this had to be a dream.</p>
<p>"Oh," Snape exclaimed as though he knew what Harry was trying to communicate. "Does somebody need a new nappy?"</p>
<p>Okay, it's time to wake up now, Harry thought to himself because the warmth had faded and was now replaced with a cold, wet feeling that left him feeling really uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth to sarcastically ask Snape if he needed a new nappy but found himself unable to properly form any words, only gibberish. It was as though Harry's mouth didn't know how to form words.</p>
<p>"I think you need a new nappy," Severus said once again, bending forward to pick Harry up. Harry shook his head, despite the fact that the man was going to discover the truth for himself. What exactly was the sense in lying? He was wet and uncomfortable and clearly, Snape wanted to do something about... Or mock him but somehow Harry didn't think Snape was in a mocking mood right now.</p>
<p>"No!" Severus exclaimed, his voice ringing with amusement as he scooped Harry easily into his arms. Slightly uneased by being so high off the ground, Harry found himself clinging to the man's shirt for comfort. Harry couldn't understand the worry, he flew higher than this on his broom but being this high up left him nervous. Harry was about to shake his head again when he felt a smaller warm feeling. Did he seriously just pee again? On Professor Snape? Shouldn't there be some kind of warning that he needed to pee?</p>
<p>Harry found himself laying on the change table with a large hand holding him down by his belly while Professor Snape rooted for what he was looking for. Looking around, Harry was wondering when he was going to wake up from this odd nightmare.</p>
<p>He was quickly brought back from his thoughts when he felt his pyjamas being snapped open and a rush of cold air hit his chest. Before he could stop it, a whimper escaped his mouth.</p>
<p>"I know, it's so cold! Once daddy changes your nappy, we'll get on some nice, warm clothes and have some breakfast," Professor Snape said, leaving Harry to wonder why he was calling himself daddy.</p>
<p>Once again, when Harry tried to question this, he found himself spitting out syllables and sounds but no actual words.</p>
<p>Finally, Harry's pyjama's were off and now Snape was working at opening the nappy. The rush of cold air that hit Harry was worse than when the pyjamas were first opened and to his horror, he started spraying pee everywhere, and he couldn't do anything to stop it. Snape seemed prepared for this because he appeared to have cast some kind of shield over himself.</p>
<p>"Ha, ha, not today Harry; you won't give daddy a shower today, silly boy," Snape laughed, fixing a new nappy under Harry's bottom when he was done peeing again. Was it normal to pee this much? Once the nappy was secure, Harry took a second to notice how warm, soft and dry it felt; it probably wouldn't stay that way for long with the way things were looking.</p>
<p>Before Harry knew it, the man was putting clothes on him, it was nice to be warm and cosy again.</p>
<p>When the man was done dressing Harry, he picked up him and began carrying him towards the door. Before he left the room, he took out his wand and cast a quick spell towards the change table and soon, it was clean and the wet nappy was gone.</p>
<p>Harry heard his belly growl, causing Snape to grin and exclaim once again that it was, in fact, breakfast time. Despite the situation, Harry felt himself grinning at the idea of eating. His belly was growling louder now; he could figure out what was happening after breakfast.</p>
<p>Snape set Harry in what appeared to be a playpen before walking towards the kitchen, probably to make breakfast.</p>
<p>Glancing around the playpen, which had a surprising amount of space, Harry spotted a little mirror in the corner and decided to take a peek. Crawling over to the mirror was a bit of a journey but once he arrived at the mirror, he found himself glancing at a black-haired baby who greatly resembled Snape but there were features from another person as well and it obviously wasn't Lily because his eyes were grey, not green.</p>
<p>Harry didn't have time to ponder because before he knew it, he was being scooped up once again and carried towards a high chair where there was toast and jam waiting. But before Harry could take a bite, he noticed someone walking in and wrapping his arms around Snape and pulling the man into a kiss.</p>
<p>When the man was done kissing Snape, he turned around and smiled at Harry. Harry felt a small smile spread across his face as he came face to face with Sirius Black.</p>
<p>"And how are my two favourite men this morning?"</p>
