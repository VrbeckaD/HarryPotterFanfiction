    <p>Over the course of his twenty-three years, Remus had slowly come to the realization that bad news had a tendency to be delivered on good days. As it was, he had been having a morning that fell on the certifiably splendid side of things, and for that it seemed the universe simply had decided some evening out was in order. It was a fair play in a sense, but not an entirely welcomed one.  </p><p>His morning began early as per his agreeing to trade shifts with Bridget and work her opening shift, and despite the variance to his sleep schedule as of late he surprisingly didn’t find himself scorned by the sound of his alarm going off at the wee hour of five am, if anything it felt as if he had been in a deep sleep one moment and wide awake the next. </p><p>He rolled over to swipe his phone screen to turn his alarm off, made sense of the dark room around him, and got himself out of bed without calling on too much effort to pull it off. He left his room and crossed over to the kitchen, bringing out the kettle to start himself a cup. He filled it at the sink, moved onto weighing his options for breakfast as he waited for the kettle to heat, and after a short debate it became quite obvious to him that practicality ought to be his main goal and decided on cereal. He poured himself a bowl and went for the fridge, but paused with his hand on the handle as he zoned in on the message scrawled on the whiteboard in far too visually appealing handwriting.</p><p>
  <i>the five times I left you the last of the milk, and the one time I didn't. </i>
</p><p>Remus reworked his mouth around a smile, not able to find it in himself to feel scorned when his amusement outweighed any sense of betrayal he might have felt on a different morning. He uncapped the marker clipped onto the board under the note intended for him and scrawled a quick note of dismissal under it before he resolved to tip his dry cereal back into the box for a later, more milk-filled time. </p><p>He answered the whistle of the kettle before he gathered the fixings for a tea, thinking he’d be pushing the leisure time he had if he tried to finish a full pot and opting for his single-serve one. He sat down at the island and got himself set up, holding his tea below his mouth and blowing on it while he fired up his laptop.</p><p>He pulled up his online banking to ensure his paycheck had come in overnight and reeled a bit at his balance for a moment; having worked his first solid pay period on a full time schedule he found he had quite a bit more to work with than he was accustomed to during the school year, and he took a quick moment to relish in the atypical feeling before he got down to business. </p><p>He opened a separate tab and checked the going rates for a pair of train tickets on a return trip. He lined up the dates he had been given the go-ahead for, checked for embarking times available, and after a few more clicks he brought up a total. The absence of a sharp bang of loss as he clicked to confirm the purchase and parted with a small chunk of his pay was, in truth, even better than the feeling he’d gotten just from staring at his paystub. </p><p>Remus made a hefty dent in his tea while he waited for the confirmation email to come in and as soon as it turned up in his inbox he got the same feeling he thought he might if he had the tips of his toes hanging off of a cliff. </p><p>He quickly forced that down staggering feeling down and readjusted his feet on the footrest of his stool, giving himself the feeling that he were, in fact, quite balanced. He finished off his tea as he checked whether his last grade had come in since the last time he’d went in to look, but the answer was a frank no on that front. He washed his teapot and mug before leaving them in the drying rack to put away later on, made a stop off at the bathroom, and headed back into his room to find something to wear to work. </p><p>He managed fairly well in the dark, even with the light shimmy he had to take to in order to get his trousers on and not make a ton of noise in the process. Once he was dressed he had a look at the time displayed on his clock on his bedside table and there was something to be said about living a short walk from his workplace; pleased he had some time to spare before he would have to head out, he went back to bed to spend that time comfortably. </p><p>One of the things Remus quite liked about Sirius was that he tended not to be all that put off about being roused from sleep — if, that is, he had ample time to doze thereafter, which he would today. Waking at the crack of dawn because he had no other choice in the matter was a different story entirely and Remus knew in his bones he would have a lot of explaining to do once Sirius found out the time Remus set their travels for, but that was a problem for future Remus to deal with. Today Remus didn’t have any qualms about burrowing up on Sirius’ left and spurring him awake in the process.  </p><p>As he'd had been absolutely hoping for, Sirius gave great yawn, reached his left arm around Remus, and cozied up close. In the sleepy quiet of the room Remus found he could feel his heartbeat a lot more than he could outside the room, and with his head still reeling from the whirlwind of the past few days he found himself feeling both emboldened and content in the same beat. </p><p>“Tickets are bought,” he said, hoping it wasn’t too early for speech or the weight of the words to sink in. </p><p>Sirius rolled toward him at once, tangling his legs with Remus’ and promptly taking Remus’ entire head captive in his arms. He pressed four kisses to the top of Remus’ head in the span of a few quick seconds and Remus shut his eyes, basking. </p><p>“How long have you got?” Sirius checked, his voice the sort of deliciously hoarse that left Remus a little weak on a typical morning, let alone today. </p><p>“About twenty now,” he supplied. </p><p>Sirius shifted his arms down from around Remus’ head. “Should call out,” he suggested, leaving a trail of kisses along the curve of Remus’ jaw. “Stay here and celebrate some more.” </p><p>“I can’t do that,” he said, though now that he was this warm it was a bit more difficult to remain decent. </p><p>“Nheh, it was worth a shot,” Sirius said, pausing his kissing for a beat. “Twenty whole minutes, did you say?”</p><p>The right corner of Remus’ mouth curled up. “If you’re quick about it.” </p><p>He waited all of three seconds before he got wrangled, flattened, and covered by Sirius. He huffed a laugh and kneaded Sirius’ shoulders as he shifted down the bed, dragging kisses over his midriff on his way. </p><p>Sirius made well on his word and went for Remus’ trousers without too much sightseeing along the way. “This is very counterproductive, I only just got them on,” Remus said all while lifting his hips to help Sirius out a little.</p><p>Sirius worked them past his knees, pausing for a moment to pat Remus’ left one briskly. “When I’m done I’ll even put them back on you,” he offered before going right back in.</p><p>Remus had a reply ready but he didn’t bother with it for the first slide of Sirius’ mouth took it right out of his head. He gave up on coherent words altogether once Sirius took to tracing rather intricate shapes against the crown of Remus’ cock at each drawback, clearly taking their time constraint to heart, but Remus could hardly say he minded when it was over before he knew it if it meant he could use the rest of the time to return the favour. </p><p>Minutes later saw them flipped, Sirius gripping tight at the back of Remus’ head as his knees curled up on either side of Remus before he rode through his release. Remus waited until Sirius’ hips stilled completely before he pulled his mouth off of him, lay his head down on Sirius’ navel and smiled against it, feeling rather accomplished in a myriad of ways just then. </p><p>He felt a tap on his head and pushed himself onto his knees, smiling down at Sirius, who lifted off of the bed to meet him in the middle. He whisking his right hand over Remus’ cheek and under his jaw before he pulled Remus’ lips against his own and, all things considered, there were far, far worse ways to start a day. </p><p>Dressed and walking on tingling legs, Remus made a quick stop out onto his perch to gauge the temperature and decided a light layer overtop of his shirt would probably suffice for a crisp, mid-May day. He quietly let himself back into his room to grab a cardigan to pull on, but Sirius was already out like a light. Remus smirked and left the room again, put some food in the cat’s bowl before strolled over and he ran his hand overtop Mestophales’ head where she sat perched directly on his laptop. </p><p>Remus gave her a pointed look but didn’t move her, forgoing that battle in favour of footing his shoes on. The walk to work was pleasant, if a bit chilly but Remus hoped it would warm up once the day got underway. His shift was busier than he was used to having mostly worked evenings and brought an entirely different crowd of would-be regulars if the morning’s were his repertoire, but it led to the morning passing quickly. </p><p>Working an open also came with the opportunity to work with Emmeline, who worked a strict three mornings a week during school and therefore rarely did their schedules line up. Remus didn’t know too many people who self-identified as a morning person, but he found her energy infectious working alongside it, spurring his already cheerful mood to even higher percentiles.</p><p>He finished at two and made a stop to pick up milk, then while he was at the shop he thought he ought to grab a few more items he’d been meaning to get but hadn’t had the time to spare. He carried his shopping bags the short walk back to his flat and found it Sirius-less, though he left an overflowing cat bowl in his wake. To combat the huff rising up in him, he traded it for a smirk, thinking if he were ever in need of a sign as to whether Sirius had been by his flat he would only have to look at the cat’s dish to find it. </p><p>Remus went to stick his shopping bags on the island, thinking he ought to put the milk away before anything else. He plucked the two bottles out of the bag and held one in hand and the other against his side as he opened his fridge only to find four bottles of milk lined up in a row. Remus took a moment to laugh; a quick, easy burst before he resigned himself to playing an intense game of Tetris in order to fit all six bottles inside the fridge comfortably along with everything else in it. </p><p>He weighed his options as he put away the rest of his shopping, thinking there was really only one thing he could do, and that was to dig up a few recipes that called for gallons of milk but he would need his mum’s wisdom on that front.</p><p>He checked the time displayed on the stove, thought it would be too early to ring just yet, and found himself tempted by the chance of a kip. He didn’t have to head out again for some time, not until Dorcas rang later on, so he set himself an alarm as a precaution, giving himself just short of an hour to avoid coming out the other end feeling sluggish. </p><p>He supposed he could have gone and slept in his bed, but the couch was a fine option. He stretched out over the length of it, pulling his quilt off of the back of it, and shifted the throw pillow to better suit his head. Not allowing his indulgence to run too long, Remus woke to the sound of his alarm feeling rested and justified in his decision. </p><p>He gave a stretch, came out from under his quilt, and started himself a full pot while he decided on what to do for a late lunch. He decided to have the bowl of cereal he intended to have that morning and took his bowl and tea back to the island where he looked up his grades again, and this time his efforts proved fruitful. He perked when he saw the alert, brought up the page, and stared at a harsh B on screen. </p><p>He didn’t even really have it in him to go in and find out just what caused the drop, instead he took to stewing while he ate, finding the B sticking out amongst the rest of his grades like a sore thumb and trying to replace his frustration with something like gratitude; the rest of his marks were top notch, it was just one B, and he was having too good a day to start nitpicking now. </p><p>Tomorrow, maybe. Not today. </p><p>He finished eating, shut his laptop with one last reminder that he’d done quite well with his term overall, and went to the sink to wash out his bowl. He picked up both his mug and teapot and relocated to the couch, deciding that given the circumstances and without assigned readings or a paper to outline, it was more than fair to get a little reading for pleasure in while he had the chance. He went to the bookshelf on the other side of the living room and picked out the novel he’d set aside at the start of term and flipped to the dog-eared page he’d last left off as he returned to the couch, wrapping himself up in his quilt and settling in the left corner with his feet propped up on the coffee table. </p><p>At the start of the new year, Remus made a pact with himself that in the event of any contented silences come his way he ought to not only try to notice them but spend a few moments truly immersed in it. He thought it might help him feel more appreciative, that was one reason, another was that it would remind him that he could have contented silences, and that it might allow for him to look back on moments like this one when things weren’t so calm, help him remember that at one point he was there and odds were he’d be there again eventually. </p><p>Remus chose this silence, thinking he liked the image of it and wouldn’t mind looking back on this one on some dreary day in the future and remember he was here once; settled, accomplished, with a couple of free hours before he would be expected anywhere and time to genuinely enjoy it.</p><p>He wasn’t too sure how long he’d been reading for when he was spurred out of his reading by Mestophales batting at a bird on the other side of the window, but when he checked the time he was momentarily shocked to read it was past five. He flipped down the top corner of the page he was on and shut his book, patting around for his mobile until he found it squeezed between his left leg and the couch cushion. He thumbed through to his mum’s mobile, giving it a shot considering the time, and stuck his mobile against his ear as the dial tone sang back at him.  </p><p>“Hallo,” she greeted, though there was a fair bit of bustle in the background. </p><p>“Where are you?” Remus asked, his curiosity piqued. </p><p>“I thought I’d stop in at the grocery off work, but it’s very clear I’m not the only one who had that idea,” his mum said. “It’s a madhouse in here.” </p><p>“Well, I’ll be here a little longer if you’d rather talk when you’ve finished there,” Remus offered. </p><p>“Where are you heading?” his mum asked, not really taking his offer. </p><p>“Dorcas is back and we’ve dinner plans eventually,” Remus said. </p><p>His mum gave a small trill. “Oh, that’ll be nice.” </p><p>Remus nodded, quite looking forward to it. “Her plane touched down last night but we figured we’d let her settle and get some unpacking done, so I’ll be here for a little while yet if you’d rather shop first.”</p><p>“How about I shop and talk to you,” his mum raised. “I’m currently comparing two nearly identical slabs of beef to see which one has more to offer, so there’s nothing stimulating happening over here.”</p><p>Remus breathed out a laugh, sticking his chin in his hand. “OK, two quick things in case you’re seized by conversation again,” he prefaced. “My last grade came in—“</p><p>“Mm! And?” his mum probed. “Are you happy with it?” </p><p>“So happy with it,” Remus said, sticking his mouth behind his hand. </p><p>He blinked when his mum let out an appraised sound. “Oh — I’ll just.. turn down here,” she said quickly, then dropped to a whisper. “I frightened a gent.” </p><p>Remus dropped his hand from his mouth, smirking. “Can’t imagine how.” </p><p>“Oh, honey, that’s wonderful,” she said, either not hearing his quip or moving right on past it. “I ought to get you something while I’m here, do you need anything?” </p><p>Remus snorted. “Sure, surprise me,” he said, playing along. “Oh — no milk, I beg of you.” </p><p>“Have you given it up?” his mum asked. </p><p>Remus gave a laugh. “Not at all, only I was foolish enough not to remember that when Sirius finishes off something of yours he typically repays you in bounds,” he said. “And I mean bounds.” </p><p>“Oh dear,” his mum said weightily. “How much milk do you now have?” </p><p>“Six bottles,” Remus chimed. </p><p>His mum let out a snort. “I can’t even say I’m surprised.” </p><p>“I shouldn’t be, and yet?” Remus returned. “If you’ve any recipes that call for a gallon of milk, I’ll take just about anything right about now.” </p><p>“Let me have a look around and I’ll send you what I come up with, how’s that?” his mum returned. </p><p>“Incredible, thank you,” Remus said. He crossed his toes in his socks and took a quick, deep breath away from the receiver for a moment before he brought it back to his mouth. “OK, second thing; the tickets are booked, so I can forward the itinerary to you so you have the dates and times on hand if you’d like?” </p><p>“That was quick,” his mum observed. “You got the approval already?” </p><p>“I know, I expected to have to wait until Lily was back,” Remus said candidly. “I made her swear to keep away from her mobile while they’re gone, but she absolutely didn’t do that and responded straight away -- and obviously she can’t do anything from all the way over there, but she still said it was as good as approved so I’d better book them now, and then I did do that.” </p><p>His mum let out a little laugh. “Thank you for that last bit, I really feel as if I was there to see it.” </p><p>“Anytime,” Remus said easily. “It’s not until July, mind, but I wanted to have a bit more saved for the trip, and then there’s the fall to consider, but I got the tickets early so they’re taken care of and out of the way.” </p><p>His mum gave an agreeing hum. “Good thinking,” she said. “What did they add up to in the end?” </p><p>“Oh, no no,” Remus denied. “Nice try, but no.”</p><p>“Remus,” she said lightly. </p><p>“Hope,” he returned. “We had a deal.” </p><p>“Well, we could call it a birthday gift?” his mum offered. </p><p>“I’m wrapped in yours,” Remus said of the astonishingly bright quilt wrapped around him. </p><p>“Oh, that was just a little something,” his mum insisted. </p><p>“Really, mum,” Remus said. “I’m on full time, I’ll make it back in a day or two. I don’t even need you to cover his ticket but I know a dead horse when I see one.”</p><p>His mum let out a light sigh. Too light. “Alright, then, you may show him the Welsh countryside from up close,” she said. “Make sure to pack a tent, it’ll get chilly if you don’t have a place to squat at for the nights.” </p><p>Remus frowned. “You’re far too good at this.”   </p><p>“Send me the receipt, please,” his mum finished, putting a dead horse right between them. </p><p>Remus sighed, dragging his free hand over his face once. “OK, fine, but that is it,” he conditioned. “You’re to take care of nothing else while we’re there, and I want that in writing.” </p><p>His mum laughed, which didn’t bode well, and then she cut off quickly. “One second,” she said. </p><p>Remus half-listened to the words exchanged between his mum and another dinnertime shopper, but he couldn’t really hear much aside from his mum’s responses and leaned forward to pour himself a little more tea in her absence. </p><p>“Sorry, sorry,” she said, her voice much clearer now. “It’s a church function without the steeple in here.” </p><p>Remus stuck the teapot back down on the coffee table and settled in again. “That’s alright,” he excused. </p><p>“So, is anyone else coming along?” his mum asked. </p><p>Remus hummed a no, his right knee jiggling. “Lily and James won’t get time off for a little while yet, and as far as I’m aware it’s not the best time for Pete, either,” he said, his knee going like a sewing machine. </p><p>“No one else?” his mum checked. </p><p>Remus looked left then right. “No?”  </p><p>“There’s plenty of room here,” his mum said. “Be a shame not to bring her with.”</p><p>“She’s got to work through the summer anyway,” Remus said, feeling as if he’d been picked up and flung backwards to the tender, grisly age of seventeen. </p><p>“OK, well, I thought I’d offer,” his mum said. “Oh — just a second, sorry.”</p><p>Remus was rather grateful for his mum getting pounced on again for it gave him time for himself; he dropped the receiver away from his mouth in order to take in a full breath and let it out before she dragged herself away from whoever had spotted her. </p><p>“You’ll never guess who that was,” his mum said.  </p><p>Remus hummed, though it was a little blank even for him. “Who?” </p><p>“Your teacher for, oh, level nine? No, Ten,” she said, and Remus was certain his entire stomach took to a roll and left his body behind. “Really kind, I know it starts with an S; I didn’t want him to know I couldn’t remember so I avoided having to say it, but I knew the face.”</p><p>Remus’ stomach went and did an impressive flip; a solid nine out of ten at least. “I’ve got the other line going, mum,” he said, pushing to sound a bit torn between two choices. </p><p>“Oh,” his mum said quickly. “OK, sorry hon; go, have fun.” </p><p>“I will, thanks,” Remus nodded. </p><p>“Send me that itinerary.” </p><p>“I will.” </p><p>“Talk to you soon.” </p><p>“Course, yeah.” </p><p>Remus pulled his mobile away from his ear as he pressed to end the call, sitting in the silence of his flat for a few moments and ultimately deciding the whole room looked different than it did before. He looked to his mobile again for the time, wasn’t sure he would get Sirius at a good time when he was already well into his shift, but Remus went into his recent calls and hovered his thumb over Sirius’ name anyway, pressing it after a quick moment’s hesitation. </p><p>Two rings and a barking laugh came through on the other end, and Remus dropped his mobile away from his mouth one more time, simply basking in feeling glad that he’d given into his impulse if it meant that was the first sound he heard from him. </p><p>“There’s a girl in the dumpster,” Sirius delivered, sounding rather charmed by the fact. </p><p>Remus blinked, his lips quirking. “Oh?” </p><p>“Well, I tossed two bags in and got a yelp in return,” Sirius added. “And when I say tossed, I mean I really wound up before I shot them in there.” </p><p>Remus’ shoulders shook as he attempted to hold his laughter in, but eventually a snort escaped and gave him away. “How certain are you of whether she was in there out of necessity or choice?” he asked. “It’ll help me decide which layer of hell I’m slated for.” </p><p>“Not as if I stopped to ask, but I’ll play,” Sirius said. “If it’d been necessity, then my best guess is you’re in for the fourth or fifth, but you could absolutely argue in front of the council that it’s likely she’s had a few bombs dropped on her in her day already.” </p><p>“Now I have a defense for trial,” Remus said. “Thank you.”</p><p>“But only the first layer if it had been by choice,” Sirius tacked on. “If that’s the case I really should have thrown them harder.” </p><p>“You’ll be on trial with me, glad to hear it,” Remus said, hiding his twisted smile underneath the edge of his quilt, but he heard the sound of the back door shutting and wondered if he’d called at an inopportune time. “Are you able to take a few or were you just heading in and out?” </p><p>“I sure can, I’m just <i>purelling</i> before I go back out,” Sirius replied, rather airily at that. </p><p>Remus clicked his tongue into the receiver so that Sirius would really hear it. “It’s as if you want the lecture at this point.” </p><p>“Seems that way, doesn’t it,” Sirius said mildly. </p><p>Remus spared him the one Sirius well knew by heart, went for another sip of tea, and heard the back door shut again, assuming Sirius was out back again. “Careful,” he cautioned. “Your friend could still be out there.” </p><p>“She can’t say for certain it was me,” Sirius returned, mid-stretch, and Remus had the image of him reclined and leaning against the building.   </p><p>“Pretty sure she’ll just assume it was, but I digress,” Remus said, feeling himself settling into the couch more just hearing Sirius relaxing. “Good shift so far?” </p><p>He heard the flick of a lighter before an easy, affirming hum. “Yours?” </p><p>“Good,” Remus replied. “Bit busier than I’m used to, but that made it pass quicker. My fridge is starting to bare an uncanny resemblance to one of the ones at work, though.” </p><p>“I’m sure you’ll go through those before they pass,” Sirius said, unfazed. </p><p>“I picked up two on my way home,” Remus tacked on. </p><p>Sirius let out a quick bark. “We’re going to have to get creative.”</p><p>“I’ve already begun gathering recipes,” Remus said. </p><p>“Great minds,” Sirius said before a pause, drawing in a haul. “You and Dorcas still on for tonight?” </p><p> Remus hummed a yes. “I don’t know when yet; I told her to take the day to unwind and she can ring me whenever—“ he said, trailing off when he heard a second voice added to the mix. </p><p>He kept quiet for a few beats, pinning the voice as Mary’s. “That’s the most ominous thing you’ve ever said to me and I’ve no choice but to take that as a threat,” Sirius declared, his voice a little farther away from the receiver. </p><p>Remus looked up and around as he kept an ear out for some context clues he was greatly lacking from his end of the phone. Mary carried on too quickly to get much more than continued phonetics, so Remus leaned forward to reach for his mug, had a bit more of his tea even though it was quite a bit cooler now, and a minute or so later he heard the sound of the back door shutting again. </p><p>“Mary says you look good today,” Sirius said. </p><p>Remus swallowed a gulp of tea. “That’s very kind but how can she know that?”</p><p>“I don't have to see you to know it either, why should she?” Sirius raised. </p><p>Remus stuck his mug back on the coffee table, feeling warm all over. “I'd return the gesture but I hear she threatened you.”</p><p>“She certainly did,” Sirius said. “Came out here telling me how much I’m really going to like one of the new kids which I have no choice but to assume means I’m definitely not going to like the new kid.”</p><p>Remus smirked a laugh. “No other conclusion to make, clearly,” he said. “Have the new ones started already?”</p><p>Sirius gave a non-committal hum around a haul. “I don’t know when the other’s starting, but the one she’s talking about starts next week,” he provided amidst holding in his haul, then let it out in one-go two beats later. “A rehire and a piece of work, says her; covered a shift at his old store a while back and he had her sitting face-down on the table in the back at the worst of it.”</p><p>Remus frowned, moving his left hand to scratch at the same hip and giving a mild hum. “Let’s hope it was just a bad first impression.”  </p><p>Sirius replied with a skeptical hum. “Mary can get along with just about anyone, so this doesn’t look good.” </p><p>Remus tilted his head evenly for that, but remained on point. “I still say you should give it a fair chance,” he said.</p><p>Sirius let out a light noise of offense. “What sort of person do you think I am?”</p><p>Remus made a thoughtful hum. “The sort that’ll go into this readily prepared for it to fail off the bat?” he raised.</p><p>Sirius let out a scoff. “She ought to get some of the blame when she’s the one who lay the foundation,” he defended.</p><p>“I’ll sprinkle some in her direction, then,” Remus allowed.</p><p>“Besides, we’re getting one more along with him, and odds are if he’s as bad as she claims then the other can’t be nearly as,” Sirius decided, and then paused for a haul, and Remus marveled at Sirius’ rather shiny impression of probability. “Did you ring to distract me from my incredible work ethic?”</p><p>It was more like a distraction for himself, but yes, technically Remus had done that. “That depends if it's working or not,” he said. </p><p>Sirius paused, the sound of him exhaling a quick haul filtering through the phone. “Like a charm,” he returned at the end of it.</p><p>“You don’t need to head back in soon?” he checked.</p><p>“Need is a strong word,” Sirius deemed it. “I could just accidentally spark this other one I happened to bring out with me; and then I’d have to finish it so not to be wasteful and I know you don’t much like that sort of thing.”</p><p>Remus stuck his mouth under his quilt again, smiling. “You’re right, I don’t,” he said. “I won’t keep you long after that, I just needed to hear your voice for a bit.”</p><p>“You good?” Sirius asked after a beat.</p><p>Remus breathed in quietly, catching the scent of his quilt’s edge that was sitting just over his nose. “Yeah, I think I’m just a schmooze today,” he said. “I must still be on a high; I blame the cobblestones and all that wine, got me feeling sentimental.”</p><p>“Not that I don’t like it when you’re a schmooze, but you said 'needed', and I don’t know you to be particularly grandiose with your phrasing,” Sirius kept on with it. “That’s more my thing.”</p><p>Remus ran his right pinky finger up and back down the side of his phone. “I picked the wrong word.”</p><p>“Mm, doubt you did.”</p><p>“I’ll just bring the entire mood down.”</p><p>“You won’t; what’s going on?”</p><p>Sensing no end in sight, Remus pulled the entire quilt tighter around him, wishing Sirius were in the room so he would be able to see him. He reached his left hand up and dragged it down his face, changing his tune completely when it reached his neck. “I don’t know what I’m even saying--”</p><p>“Yes, you do,” Sirius replied. “Take a minute, sort it out, start again.”</p><p>Remus pulled his feet off the coffee table and brought his legs in, curling them at the knee, definitely wishing he had anything to do with his hands now. “I rang my mum to tell her the trip’s on, and don’t know why I let myself think that this would go over smoothly,” he said, rubbing his free hand at the back of his neck. “Now when we go it’ll be less about me sharing you with them and more about me having this whole other area of my life that they didn’t know about, and I completely screwed this up for us even before I knew there’d be an us to screw up—”</p><p>“Oi,” Sirius returned the next beat. “Quit ragging on my man right now, you hear me?”</p><p>Remus was grateful for the first time since starting the call that Sirius wasn’t in the room so he couldn’t see the verklempt pout he gave into. “I did, Sirius,” he sighed. “To the point where my mum thinks I’m seeing Dorcas, that’s how badly I managed to screw this up.”</p><p>There was a bit of a pause before Sirius’ voice came through rather pointedly. “How could you possibly know that?”</p><p>“She asked if anyone else was coming with—”</p><p>“Great. <i>Scot</i>,” Sirius sent out. “Fuck it, then; the whole plan’s ruined.” </p><p>“Would you shush?” Remus implored. He got a breathy laugh for it, but it came with silence and that would have to do. “She thinks this is just a couple of blokes going on a trip.”</p><p>Sirius chose to speak there. “Right, and she would seeing as it was pitched as a couple of blokes going on a trip,” he put in. </p><p>Remus huffed, dragging his free hand over his face. “Right, I’m making a big deal out of nothing,” he said flatly. "Thank you for such hands on support." </p><p>“I didn't say that,” Sirius said. “I’m sorry, go.”</p><p>Remus breathed in once, out once. “I thought she’d been asking about James and everyone else, but she wasn’t,” he said. “She meant her and singled her out specifically—”</p><p>“Right, but does that really mean—”</p><p>“It was the way she said it, Sirius,” Remus said. “I know seems harmless to you, but it was the tone she used, and if you knew her like I do then there’d be no other way to spin it.”</p><p>“OK, but you still haven’t even gotten to what she actually said, which is sort of important here,” Sirius pointed out. </p><p>Remus sighed through his nose. “She said it would be a shame not to take her with,” he said. “As if I was leaving my girlfriend behind while I go on some buddy-buddy trip with you.”</p><p>Sirius hummed, but it was neither positive or negative as far as Remus could hear. “I don’t know why she thinks it,” Remus added, just in case it had been negative. “I really don’t. It’s not as if I talk about her any more than anyone else.”</p><p>Sirius smacked his lips there. “Only single girl you talk about,” he raised.</p><p>“Oh, so we skyped a lot while she was away so that must mean we’ve exchanged rings obviously,” Remus returned, souring at the image of his mum miles away grinning like a fool every time he’d even said Dorcas’ name in passing. “I hate the idea of you feeling like you’re playing second fiddle—”</p><p>Sirius laughed, for some reason. “I don’t,” he said. “Believe me, I’m taking it as a supreme compliment you got caught up in the glitz and glamour of the entire idea not to stop to think about all the ways it could possibly go wrong until today. I’ll be strutting about for days, you’ll see.” </p><p>Remus fought a reluctant smile from forming. “I should have just told them years ago and then we wouldn’t even have this problem,” he said. “I should have corrected her years ago—" </p><p>Sirius clicked his tongue on the other end of the line. “You couldn't tell them then and beating yourself up about it now won’t help anything when you’re literally planning to do something about it as we speak,” he said plainly. </p><p>“How are you being so good about this?” Remus asked. “You should be upset that I didn’t set this up properly.” </p><p>“I’m not going to shit on all the reasons you never felt free enough to say the words to them,” Sirius returned. “You had a constant devil on your shoulder telling you that it had to be kept a secret and if you were calling to get a quick and easy reprimand for not getting this over with sooner, you’re not going to get it from me and you know better than that.”</p><p>Remus pulled his quilt right up over his head and wormed his way onto his right side, curling up in the corner of the couch. “Could you go a little easier on me?” he implored. “I’m not doing so good right now.”</p><p>“I really think I was going easy on you, personally,” Sirius said frankly, “and I’m working on it; what about your dad, then? Is he holding onto the same theory that she's got?” </p><p>Remus gave a flat noise. “Last we even discussed my love life he made sure to suggest I couldn’t get a date, but that’s my dad for you.”</p><p>Sirius gave out a profound ‘pfft.’ “If he knew how many people I have to beat off of you with a stick he’d change his tune right quick.”</p><p>“Alright; he was kidding around and I would have thought you’d catch onto that since you’re rather familiar with exaggerating for comedic effect, case in point.”</p><p>“I’m not even exaggerating,” Sirius returned. “<i>That’s</i> the funny part.” </p><p>Remus gave a sigh. “The point is he mostly just reamed me on it and we went onto something else,” he said. “That’s fairly regular for us.”</p><p>“Were pronouns even mentioned?” Sirius asked. </p><p>Remus shook his head. “Not a one.” </p><p>“Then maybe it all lies with him,” Sirius said. “Did I tell you I ascended to the heavens the moment he reamed me? I was honoured, truly.”</p><p>Remus felt the corners of his lips lift. “You took it so well,” he let him have. “It takes a few good ones for some to realize he’s just being a shit, but you caught on straight away.”</p><p>“Takes one shit to recognize another,” Sirius said easily. “Far as I’m concerned I’ve already got his approval in a sense, I just need to seal the deal.”</p><p>Remus gave a considered nod. “You’ll at least stay in his good books if you keep bringing up Live Aid,” he said, smiling. </p><p>“What, as if I could ever forget?” Sirius returned. “I plan on asking him plenty more questions so he best be ready for it.”</p><p>Remus’ small smile formed a grin before he touched rubbed at his eyes in turn with his free hand. “I don’t know; if my mum’s convinced then he may hop on board, too,” he said, dread bubbling back up in him. “It could go either way.”</p><p>“Ah, but she already loves me, she just doesn’t know how much yet but she’ll see,” Sirius said. “In the end not much has really changed, has it?”</p><p>Remus gave a frown. No, it really hadn’t and not all of it in a good sense, but he stopped himself short of saying it when he couldn’t keep on lodging complaints, not with Sirius.</p><p>“You with me?” Sirius asked, pulling Remus back. </p><p>“I’m here.”</p><p>“It’s not as if we weren’t expecting an adjustment period, and at worst, I think that’s all we’re in for,” Sirius pressed on. “Not much we can do until we’re there, but I say our plan is in full motion.”</p><p>“Mm?” </p><p>“Forget what coming out stories you’ve seen, heard,” Sirius asserted, “whether they’ve ended terribly or they hit out of the park; we don’t need them because we’re making our own, yes?”</p><p>“Yes."</p><p>“That’s right, we say ‘fuck those stories, they’re old news,’” Sirius championed. “We just have to do what we do best; let them see how great we work together; we frame it around us as planned, we tell it like it is, and they’ll see that it makes all the sense in the world when you look at it properly—”</p><p>Sirius cut off quickly, speaking away from the receiver. “What?” he asked someone else, Mary likely. “<i>Now</i>?”</p><p>Remus barely registered anything past the exclamation, taking the moment Sirius seemed distracted and using it for himself. He dropped his phone away from his mouth for a shaky breath, shutting his eyes as they continued welling up.  </p><p>“Rosmerta’s here,” Sirius said onto the phone, both words in a split second.</p><p>A few tears got away from Remus when he opened his eyes, and he’d never been more grateful for their district manager’s sense of timing. He swallowed hard and brought the phone back up by his mouth, pushing to sound steady until Sirius went on his way. “Best look alive.”</p><p>“She never drops in this late -- I haven’t been living my life like she’d be coming in today,” Sirius insisted, and for a moment Remus got an image of a somewhat less than picturesque café. “This may be the last we speak, and if so it’s been an honour servicing you.”</p><p>“Well, with a mouth like that I’m sure you’ll charm her in no time,” Remus sent him. </p><p>“I’ll bring out the big guns, but only because you said I could,” Sirius vowed, the sound of the back door shutting in the background of the call before his voice dropped to a fast-paced whisper. “Come over when you’re done there?”</p><p>Remus nodded. “Yeah,” he confirmed. </p><p>“Love you,” Sirius added right before the line went dead and Remus dropped his phone altogether.</p><p>A week’s worth of running on high caught up to him in one blow, knocking Remus from every angle, and he couldn’t do much more than shift himself down onto his side and simply let it happen.   </p><p>If it could sink in soon he’d love it to get a move on, but some of it just wouldn’t line up no matter how much he wished he could flip a switch and make it happen. For Sirius to be so willing to go along with the hassle he came with, to be so steadfast, or to want to be apart of this section of his life even at all, or and or, on and on until Remus was back where he started once again. He didn’t know the steps backwards or forwards in that moment, or how he tripped into something so much bigger than him, or how he managed to trick Sirius into falling into it with him; or and or, and on and on.</p><p>The flattened feeling never did catch him at a good time, but he was grateful he’d been able to hold out until Sirius was off the phone. He’d take being curled up and shaking under a chaotically colourful quilt while alone in his flat if it meant he wouldn't have someone staring at him as if he’d never catch up, and maybe he never fucking would. He hated this part more than any of it, but these moments never came with pride, so why, he wondered, did he expect to feel any different this time around? One heady week couldn't change months, and months couldn’t change years, and if he was going to feel it he needed to without the pitying look that came along with him welling up at every bit of the newness of it all. </p><p>The couch dipped behind him, a weight settled against his lower back, and a sequence of purring told him plainly that he wasn’t alone, not quite. Remus breathed out, pulled the quilt down off his head, and made the effort to shift onto his back, then to his left side. He slung his right arm over the cat’s body, and she must have sensed that he needed this a bit if she allowed him to remain draped over her. </p><p>Minutes later he clued into her tail intermittently whipping against his stomach and wiped his eyes one by one with his left hand, feeling a bit silly on the other end of it. He lay still for a little while longer, running his right hand along the cat’s fur and actively trying to remember the important theme threading through his entire week; Sirius wanted this, too. It should give him heart palpitations in some hokey way, have him reciting haikus about springtime and new beginnings just as he’d done that morning, not render him useless and holding onto his cat for support. Sirius was up for taking this step with him, he was going to come with just to see it through, and in that moment Remus told himself what he had to if he had any hope of getting off his couch; that just because he wasn’t ahead of the game in a lot of areas, it didn't have to mean he was that far behind either.</p><p>He let out a long sigh, pushed himself up, and leaned his weight on his left elbow, glancing over the surface of the coffee table for his tin. When he didn't see he pulled himself off the couch and went into his room, finding it lying on his bedside table, and snatched it up. He went back to the couch and picked the opposite corner so he was closer to the window, slid it open fully, and packed himself a bowl. He lay stretched his legs out across the couch and was mid-way through his haul when his mobile rang again. </p><p>He let out a stream in one long sigh, hoping it was someone bringing him something he could handle. He leaned forward to squint at his phone on the other end of the couch and read Dorcas lit up on his screen.</p><p>He cleared his throat a few times, swiped the screen, and said hello, prompting Dorcas’ distinctly animated voice. “Well, this is a real disappointment; I was hoping you’d come back with an accent I could then completely make fun of you for.” </p><p>Remus smirked, feeling a bit better already. “After three days there?” he raised. </p><p>“Only takes one for some,” Dorcas returned.</p><p>“Then I could really say the same for you since you had four months on me to develop one of your own,” Remus said. </p><p>“We really have to work on being more pretentious,” Dorcas said. </p><p>“I’ll put one on the next time I come back, how’s that?” Remus offered.</p><p>“That’s more like it,” Dorcas said. “Only you’ll have to start turning your nose up at every cheese platter you come across, insisting that you can’t even look at our sad excuse for cheese when you had the real stuff.”</p><p>“First of all, I love that that gives the impression I come across a lot of cheese platters in my day to day,” Remus said. “And second, I did try some of the cheese and they’re not making it up — it is better there. If you get a free day in the fall, come visit, I’ll take you where we went, and you’ll see what I mean.” </p><p>“Deal,” Dorcas returned. “My only amendment is that we have to go to one of those fancy wine tastings so I can put my pinky up and chortle the whole time.” </p><p>“What, like you don’t do that already?” Remus said.</p><p>“Can’t have them sniff me out as a tourist, can I?” she said. “I’ll just have to hope they don’t ask me to sniff and name whatever wine it is.” </p><p>“Right, that’s when they’ll know you’re not one of them,” Remus said evenly. </p><p>Dorcas snorted. “Alright, I'm home, settled enough, and I want dinner,” she declared. </p><p>“Where do you want to do this?” Remus asked. </p><p>“Raining out there, isn’t it?” she observed. </p><p>Remus leaned his head back to have an upside down look at the window and saw that a drizzle had indeed started at some point over the course of the afternoon, which was fitting to say the least. “Right, I’ll come to you, then?” </p><p>Dorcas spoke through what sounded like a mild stretch. “Great idea.” </p><p>Remus smiled, thinking the fresh air might do him some good even with the drizzle involved. “Give me a bit to get myself sorted and I’ll head over,” he said. </p><p>Remus finished off his bowl before much else, then thought it might be on to roll a pinner to bring along in case Dorcas wanted to partake later on. He stuffed the joint away in his tin and stuck it in his pocket, heading into his room to swap his cardigan out for something to better cover him from the rain and ended up picking one of Sirius’ on account that it smelled like him and had a proper hood.</p><p>He stopped at the entryway to foot his shoes on, then remembered his earbuds were plugged into his laptop on the island and went to grab them. He detangled them on the way through the stairwell and thumbed through to find a tune he even felt like hearing at the moment and ultimately hit shuffle and stuffed his mobile into the pocket of Sirius’ hoodie before stepping out of the lobby door. </p><p>His shuffle picked 'The Revivalists' <i>Wish I Knew You</i> and after a pointed frown Remus resolved to leave it playing, deciding he wasn’t interested in assigning that particular choice with any deeper meaning and called on a bit of Sirius' level of flipping a scene to better suit himself;<br/>
his mobile simply knew he could use a jaunty bassline to accompany him on his travels, that's all. He continued talking himself up as he rode the tube and by the time he made it to Dorcas’ block he’d managed to put some of the spring back in his step, thinking the rest would fall together once he got upstairs. </p><p>He wasn’t wrong about that for the moment Dorcas opened the door to let him inside Remus instantly felt better.</p><p>“I may have ordered food but in my defense, I really didn’t feel like standing over the stove,” she said, stepping back to let Remus in.</p><p>“That’s fine with me,” Remus said, slipping inside and moving to foot his shoes off on the matt. </p><p>The two of them ended up in eating on the couch, where Dorcas took the reigns of the conversation, which Remus hardly minded when they had a lot of catching up to do. He got a run down of Dorcas’ last week in Milan, her mad dash to fit as many visits with mates as she could squeeze in, and a few of the finer details about her final day which he learned mainly consisted of a bed and the bloke she’d taken up with while there, and not all that much else. From there he got quite another detailed tale of her flight, complete with some pleasant highlights and a lot more gruelling anecdotes; having never done it himself, flying had always been a bit of a blind spot where Remus was concerned, but he found himself amused hearing from someone who so evidently hated the finer details of flying as much as Dorcas clearly seemed to. </p><p>By the time the two of them were mostly finished their plates Dorcas had made it to the actual flying part of the tale, which included being seated next to a woman who proceeded to show her many pictures of her rock collection.</p><p>“Was it impressive at least?” Remus asked, feeling the need to interject right about there. </p><p>“One was a shocking, shimmery blue, but that didn’t mean I need to see it, or the thousand others,” Dorcas returned. “It’s my face, I swear; it’s too polite and screams ‘tell me all about your rock collection,’ and I don’t know how to train it to stop.”</p><p>“Apparently mine’s the same way, but especially at work,” Remus said. “Sirius claims it’s the baby deer eyes that give customers the impression I’m absolutely there to hear about who got what in the divorce.”</p><p>Dorcas gestured at him with her free hand. “See? We’re doomed, we can’t change our faces,” she said. Remus gave an attempt at a gruff expression that got her snickering behind her glass. “Needs work.” </p><p>Remus snorted and traded the face for a smile, feeling warm and fed and contented. Before he could truly snapshot the moment to save for later a door opened down the hall and a bit of whistling floated back their way. Remus didn’t really think much of it past the sudden understanding that Dorcas’ roommate had to have been home, but Dorcas’ bland expression as his footsteps approached was a bit difficult to miss. Her roommate came into view as he passed by the open doorway to the living room, tossing a vacant nod to Remus before he was out of view again and heading into the kitchen. Remus trained his gaze on Dorcas just as she raised her hands to her temples as her roommate continued his jaunty tune while he dug out whatever he was getting out of the fridge. She shut her eyes after about fifteen seconds in, where she began to look a little of what Remus had a hunch he had to look like when he was trying to ward off a particularly punchy migraine.</p><p>Remus lasted about all of a minute through the rather tense atmosphere before he reached into his right pocket for his tin, plucked out the pinner he’d rolled ahead of time, and poked her on the arm with the point of it. </p><p>Dorcas opened her eyes and dropped both her hands from the sides of her head. “You’re a good man,” she forwarded, pushing off of the couch.</p><p>Remus stifled a laugh and followed her out onto her balcony which was a surprisingly spacious area where two people didn’t have to squeeze to fit on it, but Remus wasn’t envious about that at all. Dorcas went ahead and took the deck chair on the left while Remus shut the sliding glass door behind him and sat down in the other chair, sticking his mobile on the small plasticine table between the two of them. </p><p>“I’m going to fucking sock him one day,” Dorcas said. </p><p>Remus fished out his lighter and handed both it and the pinner off for Dorcas to start. “What did I miss?” he asked. </p><p>Dorcas reached over and took both off of him. “I always kept to my area when he had his mates over, but when I clearly have company he decides it’s completely on to just waltz on out and kill the vibe with his fucking whistling,” she returned, sticking the end of the joint in her mouth, speaking while she flicked the lighter. “He <i>knows</i> I hate it, too, which is the worst part about it.” </p><p>Remus bit the side of his lower lip out of mirth as he reached to cup his hands around the end of the joint so it’d have a chance to light, but seconds after Dorcas pulled a haul off of it she promptly erupted into an coughing fit that Remus tried vigorously not to snicker at. “Strong shit,” she said hoarsely, thumping her fist against her chest a few times. </p><p>Remus rearranged his expression. “Yeah, I probably should have warned you, Sirius’ stuff is no joke,” he said. </p><p>“I’m learning,” Dorcas returned before taking a resounding breath and immediately lifting the lighter to try again.</p><p>Remus fully gave into his amusement there, not feeling all that bad about it when Dorcas successfully exhaled without another eruption a few moments later. She handed it off to him and gestured toward him with a hand. “What about you?” she asked. “What’s been going on here?” </p><p>Remus let his haul out in a quick stream. “I booked another trip this morning.” </p><p>Dorcas’ eyes lit up. “You’re going back already?” she asked. </p><p>Remus shook his head, shifting his gaze onto the theatre front across the road from Dorcas’ building. “It’s going on two years since I moved so I thought I’d make the trip home now that I can wrangle the time and money to do it,” he said, hovering just at the cusp of the rest of it. “And I thought it was high time that my mum and dad got to know Sirius properly, too.”</p><p>Remus made the effort to look at her then, but he got maybe a split-seconds warning before she reached across the table and socked him right in the arm. “Why am I only hearing this now?” she demanded. </p><p>Remus reached up to ward off another go at him. “I did want to hear about you,” he defended, pulling another haul off of the joint.</p><p>Dorcas shook her head. “But this is huge,” she said, gesturing her hand at him in prompt, and it helped then, just to hear it being called what Remus certainly felt it was. </p><p>“It’s all very soppy stuff,” he prefaced through the exhale. “You really ought to know that ahead of time.”</p><p>“Even better,” Dorcas said, draping herself back in her seat. “Lay it on me.” </p><p>Remus’ lips quirked as he handed the joint back to her. “There are two major points where I realized I really fucking owed it to him,” he said. “One was when he helped me make the payment — after I forced myself to get past the fact that I had to let him do it in order to even try to get in, let’s be clear on that.” </p><p>Dorcas paused her haul and let out a very small cloud. “Crystal.” </p><p>Remus tipped his head toward her for it. “And the other was him taking me there just to have a look,” he said, then ended up huffing out a laugh. “He was such a sneak about it, too; just told me to pack for two nights and he wouldn’t even tell me a thing of where we were going until we were already on our way and I caught onto his plan, but why would he tell me?”</p><p>Dorcas burst out a quick laugh, tapping the joint to ash it. “No reason to.”</p><p>“Just useless information,” Remus said, passing the joint along. </p><p>“Bet the face you made was worth it,” Dorcas stuck in. </p><p>“Allegedly,” Remus said, but smirked all the same. “First day he took me to as many sights as we could squeeze in, all the spots you’re supposed to. Never got into the Louvre because the line was unbelievable, but I did stand at the top of the tower, so it’s fair.”</p><p>“Can’t have it all,” Dorcas afforded him, reaching to pluck the joint out from between his two fingers. </p><p>“But the second day he brought me to all sorts of hidden spots that he knew about,” Remus said while she took a haul. “All these back road shops and little hole-in-the-wall pubs that he insisted that people miss while they get caught up in the typical attractions, and he wanted me to know all these little secrets of the city so I’d know where they were beforehand. He was just glowing that day, and that was it. I knew I really needed to start thinking about it.”</p><p>He stopped, registering Dorcas’ lower lip held in paired with her openly turmoiled expression, and she let go of her lip when his smile faded. “I’m trying to let you finish before I scream,” she said in a quick burst, waving her hand erratically.  </p><p>“He’s so happy that I got in, just ecstatic about it,” Remus said.</p><p>Dorcas handed the joint over for Remus to take, smiling at that. “He looked it when we were on skype,” she tacked on. </p><p>“Yes, but that — that didn't happen to me,” Remus insisted, pointing at her with the joint before taking a haul and adding to it once he exhaled. “It was never been about what good opportunities I’d managed to get, it was always who I was leaving behind if I were to take any of them, except for this time. He wants me to go, <i>for me</i>, and that’s— it's...”</p><p>He meant for the words to sound as important as they were, but he wasn’t sure he really worded any of it properly. He saw Dorcas’ smile drop off a bit before she gave a small nod, and he knew that she knew what he was saying. </p><p>Remus breathed out his nose and worked to explain it. “At first I wasn’t sure why he kept pressing me to try for it so much, but he listens—” he paused there, tilting his head evenly, “—not all the time, but one thing I can say is that this was one of our problems from even before we started up, but if Sirius mucks up he works twice as hard not to do it again and I think that’s what he was doing here, and I don’t know— seeing that, and being there with him, and seeing him so happy at the thought of me going there; I wanted my parents to know what he actually is to me.”</p><p>It felt right to say, in the same way it felt right that his brain replay proposing the initial idea to Sirius, and then all the details he’d focused on since they'd been back; how Sirius sat eagerly, cross-legged in front of him on the hotel room bed, how bright his eyes went, how hard he kissed him afterward, and that helped solidify it all. He thought it best not to relive the memory of the lively sex that ensued rather soon after; it was decidedly not a scene he thought he should replay snapshots of just then. </p><p>He shifted forward in his seat, crossing his legs and sticking his chin in his hand, working to meet Dorcas’ eyes with levity in order to hopefully come off rather wholesome instead, but Dorcas hardly noticed it when she simply followed his altogether grandiose monologue with a deep groan and clutched at her chest.</p><p>“Bury me at sea,” she requested. Remus eyed her amusedly and Dorcas reached out and drummed on the table between them. “Deets, deets! When are you off?”</p><p>“It’s not until July,” Remus provided from behind his hand. </p><p>Dorcas snorted, taking a pull off the joint. “Always have to plan ahead, don’t you."</p><p>Remus gave a conceding head tilt and moved his hand aside, resting his chin in his hand. “I’d have liked it to have been sooner, but -- money.”</p><p>Dorcas clicked her tongue. "Hate that stuff,” she said. “Are you nervous?”</p><p>“No, never me,” Remus returned airily. </p><p>Dorcas breathed a laugh through her nose. “I wouldn’t be if I were you,” she said, offering the joint back to him. “He’s a good boy; If I brought that one home mine would begin the wedding preparations that very same day.”</p><p>Yes, he thought around a haul, but that would be very different. It came to him so quickly, but he kicked himself a beat later. It might have been a picturesque image compared to his own, and an idealistic outcome to expect, but he knew she was only trying to ease his nerves.</p><p>He stared out at passersby on the street below them, thinking he should leave it alone. Some didn’t have parents around to presume things about them. Some didn’t have secrets collecting years worth of dust that put them positions where assumptions can be made about them. Some didn’t hide, some were brave, some had it worse. </p><p>And yet he heard himself speak anyway. “Do your parents ever have a phrase, or even just a tone that just sends you right back to being seventeen?” </p><p>Dorcas gave a loaded laugh that brought Remus’ startled gaze back on her. “Take your pick,” she said. “You couldn't pay me enough to be seventeen again, but I take that trip for free every other time I ring home.”</p><p>“Hm?” Remus prompted, not wanting to lose the opportunity.</p><p>Dorcas gave an amused breath through her nose, nodding. “I just about blew my dad’s head apart when I picked my major, and two years on he’s still getting his shots in whenever he can,” she detailed. “He just can’t help himself.”</p><p>Remus made a bit of a face at that. “Your program sounds incredible.”</p><p>Dorcas leaned in, putting her chin in her hand as she reached to pluck the joint out of Remus’ hand and gestured to him with it. “And it is, but I had the grades for Sciences, and I took a gap year and felt things out a little, and finally chose film,” she said, punctuating it with a quick toke. “He’ll never let me live it down; he’s asked ‘how’s the hobby?’ more times than I can count, as if it’s clever at all this far in.”</p><p>Remus thought that was a frankly dismal overview of a degree in film. “I’m sorry, did you not just finish up a term in Milan?” he raised. </p><p>Dorcas gave a loaded laugh. “Frivolous degrees are frivolous degrees whether I got to spend a term on Italian soil or not,” she said.  </p><p>Remus blinked a few times, looked around the room, and with his own parents throwing near parties when it came to his schooling he drummed his hands on the table twice. “Right, well, that’s so disheartening, and my entire point crashed and burned so I’ll take that as my cue here and bow out,” he said frankly.</p><p>Dorcas burst out a laugh. “No no, now I’ve got to know what yours was,” she said, holding the joint outstretched.</p><p>Remus took a quick haul and held it in, thinking of how to articulate it without specific details, and decided that perhaps he could cover a fair amount of ground but refrain from giving the entire picture. “This morning I finished arranging a trip solely based on bringing my boyfriend home to my parents, only to find out twelve hours later that my mum thinks I’m dating a lass,” he relayed, popping an enthusiastic smile on the end of it. </p><p>He watched as Dorca’s face went through an impressive series of emotions before finally landing on a heavy frown, and though he felt strange under her sympathetic gaze but it was difficult not to need it. Here he could process it aloud, without stomping all over Sirius’ spirit while doing so.</p><p>“I’d been on such a high for days, and hearing that just took the wind right out of my sail,” Remus said, shaking his head and handing what was left of the joint back to her.</p><p>“Yeah, ‘course it did,” Dorcas extended, reaching to take hold of it. </p><p>“It was the exact same tone she’d use back in high school,” he said. “She would put it on when she wanted me to know that she’d sussed out I was seeing someone, but she always thought I was avoiding bringing her home to meet them because I didn’t want a giant production or the embarrassment, which -- is more real than she even knows, but that’s not really the point. I know she means well and I know I can’t blame her; I never did anything about it then, but the second I heard it again I felt so young, and in the worst way.”</p><p>Remus bit the inside of his lip, staring out at the face of the theatre across the street from them. “It’s not as if none of my reasons aren’t reason enough to go through with it; they are and it’s rich of me to expect things to be different now that I want them to be,” he said. </p><p>Dorcas turned her head to shoot a quick stream of smoke out of her mouth and turned it back before holding the joint out to him in offering. “What do you mean by that?” she asked. </p><p>Remus took a haul, sorting the words out before trying again. “Once Sirius and I actually started getting along I’d catch myself telling them so many stories with him in them— because I had so many of them, I saw him three nights a week just at work, and when I realized I was doing it I started sticking in stories about the rest of you to balance it out, and I kept doing it all through literally today,” he said. “Back in the early days it was self-preservation, I know it was; I never saw him and I happening and the last thing I’d have wanted was either of them to pick me out over some unrequited love situation, that’d have been awful.”</p><p>Dorcas let out a small, reluctant laugh at the face he pulled. “But now, since you and him did end up together, maybe a little part of you hoped she already sort of knew?” she raised.</p><p>Remus froze for a moment, feeling sussed out. “It doesn’t even make sense,” he insisted, lifting his free hand. “Truly it doesn’t; if she’d said, ‘great, what time are you and your boyfriend getting in?’ my stomach would have dropped out of my body— and why would she have done it? I backed Tom up as a mate for eons, I backed Sirius up as one this whole time, and now I want her to catch on? It’s ridiculous, <i>I’m</i> ridiculous.”</p><p>Dorcas gave him a plain look. “Right, but, none of this is simple, so why should your reaction be either?” Remus sat blinking at her for a few beats and Dorcas breathed out a weak laugh through her nose. “I’m saying you get to be annoyed here,” she reiterated. “Take the rest of it away, you were still gearing up to impending reveal, so maybe you tested the waters a bit and then got your foot snapped at. If you want to talk about disheartening, it’s what I’d call that.”  </p><p>Remus felt a wave of appreciation for her just letting him pull apart bits of worries and thoughts that would otherwise go nowhere but in. “So fucking disheartening,” he said. “And, not three minutes later, she runs into the rather male professor I had the biggest thing for in year ten, and tells me it chipper as all hell as if the piece of the puzzle isn’t <i>right there.”</i></p><p>
  He let out a tired laugh, frowning at Dorcas’ own frown. His opportunity for absolution didn’t last long, it never really did, and in the next moment his stomach churned and he felt certain he should cut his mum some slack. “There’s really not much that can be done about it now,” he said, straightening up in his chair and handing the joint off to Dorcas to finish off. “Sirius isn’t deterred at all, if that’s even a surprise, and it does help that they’re quite fond of him already. It's better I turn up with the bloke who was very generous with them as opposed to one who’s got, I don’t know, a head tattoo or something.”
</p><p>
 Dorcas let out a long snort at that, setting her head down on her raised knee for a moment as she got a hold of herself. “Helps that he's a babe, too,” she said, lifting her head to relight the joint.
</p><p>
 "I’m not sure they’re going to think that?” Remus returned, but a small smile broke through anyway. 
</p><p>
 “Well, alright, maybe not, but he’s got such a good presence about him,” Dorcas said after an exhale. “No tense or awkward silences to be seen if you’ve landed someone who simply doesn’t let them happen.”
</p><p>
Remus blinked. “That’s— that’s fair,” he said candidly, feeling one less thorn poking at his side from the sentiment alone. "He really doesn't."
</p><p>
 “Are you telling them straight away?” Dorcas asked, reaching to stub the joint out.
</p><p>
  That Remus smiled fully at. “Imagine we waited until the last moment?”
</p><p>
Dorcas bit her lip out of sudden mirth before reciting, “'Mother, father, I am dating a man,' and then you dive onto the train before it leaves the station.”
</p><p>
  “Quick, easy, strong exit,” Remus observed.
</p><p>
 “Call it from the window as the train pulls out,” Dorcas offered. 
</p><p>
 Remus narrowed his eyes in feigned thought. “Seems too personal, somehow?”
</p><p>
 Dorcas gave a heavy nod. “Right, right, right,” she said. “So what you do is, ring them five minutes after you leave and go, ‘shit, I forgot some potentially life altering news I need to tell you both, put me on speaker?’” 
</p><p>
  “That’s it, new plan,” Remus said. 
</p><p>
 “So, you’ll tell them early on?” Dorcas presumed.
</p><p>
 “First night,” Remus confirmed.
</p><p>
  “Atta boy,” Dorcas said. “Good thing you’re doing this before term starts, too, otherwise you’d be waiting a full year, and that’d be some news, hm.”
</p><p>
  Remus nodded, but if he thought five months was difficult to wrap his head around, projecting to a full year felt like he’d jumped right off the cliff he was inching on. “Do you know the worst part about the fall?” he said, steering them away.
</p><p>
  “No, but tell me,” Dorcas prompted. 
</p><p>
“I have to start looking for a sublet,” Remus delivered, pairing it with a flat frown. 
</p><p>
 Possibly because she’d gone through a similar process the fall past, Dorcas didn’t seem all that phased. “Some of it’s a hassle, yeah, but you’ve time to find a good one.”
</p><p>
  Remus hummed. “In theory, but rest assured I’ve come up with potential horror stories already,” he said. 
</p><p>
  Dorcas smirked. “Oh, please, I need to know,” she said.
</p><p>
  Remus let out a puff of breath. “I get a response from someone who’s interested; they’re moving out of student housing, sick of getting gouged, and think I like the sound of that," he said evenly, "but they show up to see the place and they’ve got the shifty-eyes.”
</p><p>
  “Oh no,” Dorcas tossed out, just barely humouring him, “not those.”
</p><p>
Remus ducked his head, breaking into a laugh. “And then, they’re touching all of my things and I hate that idea more than the shifty eyes,” he said. “Or, here’s another good one — a variation of the same scenario wherein I turn up back at my flat in December only to find the place has been emptied.”
</p><p>
He huffed a laugh as Dorcas dissolved into her own fit. “That would happen to you,” she sent him.
</p><p>
  Remus burst out a laugh of his own, lifting a hand in agreement. “I’m already exhausted by the process and I haven’t even begun it.”
</p><p>
 Dorcas straightened up quite suddenly in her seat and levelled him with a sly look. “Listen, I’m right sick of this place,” she said. 
</p><p>
Remus succumbed to a fit of his own. “You just got back,” he returned.
</p><p>
“Yeah, but these last few months have been full of the best sleep I’ve had since moving here, and that's because I didn't have him whistling around everywhere,” she said. “I don’t mean whistling while you work, I mean he strolls about at two in the morning whistling like a miner and I don’t want this for myself, Remus; I deserve better than this. ”
</p><p>
 And that had Remus shaking. “James and Sirius just got a new neighbour who practices the bagpipes deep into the night, for some reason, so whistling sounds good right about now.”
</p><p>
 “OK, first, that’s the funniest thing I’ve ever heard, and second, he’s also a fucking dick,” Dorcas went on, holding onto her stomach. “I should have just taken the time to find a new place.”
</p><p>
  “Alright, but you have so much space here,” Remus insisted before gesturing around them. “A dick’s a dick, but you have room to be nowhere near him.”
</p><p>
  “Space, sure, but you talked about being gouged before and that hit home,” she said. “Plus, I like yours; all quaint and cozy, with that little kitchen alcove and it can’t be more than what I’m paying here.”
</p><p>
 Remus stared at her, feeling one of the many knots in his stomach asking for expressed permission to loosen. “Honestly that would be such a relief,” he said. “Are you on a lease?”
</p><p>
“It’s month to month, thank God,” Dorcas said. “And, I’ll get to look after your cat.”
</p><p>
 Remus sucked in a quick breath through his teeth. “No cat, I’m afraid,” he said, but then Dorcas let out a loud gasp and he quickly backtracked. “No no, there’s still a cat, don’t worry, but Sirius laid claim on her already.”
</p><p>
Beat me to the punch,” she said, pitching herself back in her chair disappointedly.
</p><p>
  “He all but insisted,” Remus said, giving into a grin. “It really is out of my hands.”</p><p>
  “I suppose he’s got the right,” Dorcas said, though she heaved a sigh for good measure. Remus’ phone chimed not a moment later from where it lay halfway across the table from him. “Speaking of. You can look, you know.”
</p><p>
 Remus gave a quick, sheepish smile, and shook his head. It was nearing the time Sirius would have gotten off shift, so either he was checking to see if they were still on for later, or he sneezed and had the feeling he was being talked about and wanted to investigate, but either way Remus didn’t really want to be glued to his mobile.
</p><p>
  “You’ll hate the washer and dryer situation in the building,” he brought up. “Sirius calls it highway robbery, but there’s a laundromat a few blocks away, and it works. Just, as a facility, it certainly washes and dries your clothing.”
</p><p>
  Dorcas heaved out a tight laugh. “You’re really selling this,” she said. “If this teaching thing doesn't work out, I think you've a shot in real estate.”
</p><p>
 Remus was still laughing when he answered his phone on the first ring. “Hello?”
</p><p>
  “Are you with him?”
</p><p>
Remus blinked, caught off guard by the speed at which James’ voice came through. “No, he was working tonight,” he gave him. “Is everything ok?”
</p><p>
 “Have you heard from him today?” 
</p><p>
  “Earlier,” Remus said before a pause, apprehensive now. “What’s happened?”
</p><p>
  “Walburga’s in the obit,” James provided, and it was as if Remus’ stomach returned to his body solely to leave it once again. “There isn’t a chance in hell he'd have gotten a word about it personally, but there are a lot of papers scattered about there, and I don't want him without one of us if he decided to take a gander while tidying up. Can you get to him?”
</p><p>
 Remus nodded before remembering vocal chords were an important part of a strictly verbal conversation. “Of course,” he said quickly to make up for the lag. 
</p><p>
 "It’s shit fucking timing, otherwise I’d be there in a second,” James insisted. 
</p><p>
  “I know,” Remus said, the image of James stuck in the way out on the outskirts of London flooding his brain instantly. "I've got it, OK?"
</p><p>
 “What’s happened?” Dorcas asked the moment Remus ended the call and pressed to call Sirius.
</p><p>
  Remus put his phone to his ear. “Sirius’s mother passed.”
</p><p>
Dorcas’ expression dropped to one of full of dismay. “Tell him I’m sorry.” 
</p><p>
  Remus nodded, giving a tight sort of smile as the second ring came through for the would-be kind sentiment. He pulled the phone down for a quick second to catch a glimpse of the time and found out he’d undershot the time, Sirius should have left work at least half an hour ago. He ran his right thumbnail over his index finger through to the third ring, taking up an intense staring contest with the surface of the table between the two of them down as voicemail picked up, and Sirius’ voice rang through the phone, bright and clashing terribly with the situation. 
</p><p>
  He told himself he’d just try again and he’d get him, but then it dawned on him in the span of a beat. Sirius rode Priscilla to Remus’ place the night before, if he decided just to snag clothes out of Remus’ drawer and headed to work straight from his flat then he’d have to drive the bike back to his own flat, and if he didn't drive all that carefully on a good day—
</p><p>
  “Sirius, please call me back,” he said as soon as the tone chimed. 
</p><p>
 He set his phone back down on the table and tried to shake his head clear, realizing then he’d answered James’ favour so quickly that he now had a mate he would have to bail on. 
</p><p>
He looked to her apologetically. “Dorcas—”
</p><p>
 “Go on,” Docas said, nodding once in the vicinity of the door. 
</p><p>
  Remus sighed gratefully. “Thank you,” he said, moving to stand.
</p><p>
  She nodded, followed in behind him, and remained in the balcony doorway while he went for their plates. “Nevermind those,” she said. "Go." 
</p><p>
 Remus paused mid-reach for their plates and gave her another appreciative look before he made his way down the hall. “Next week?” he called as he footed his shoes on.
</p><p>
  “Yeah, ‘course,” Dorcas said from the other room. 
</p><p>
  Remus infused a little more life into his voice. “Great, good, I’ll call you.”
</p><p>
  He pulled out his phone the moment he shut the door behind him and opened his messages as he made for the stairwell. It couldn’t hurt to cover all corners; if Sirius missed his and James’ calls then perhaps he left his phone on the other end of the flat and didn’t hear the rings. Sirius left that thing everywhere; it could be sitting in the backroom at work for all he knew. 
</p><p>
 He opened up their message thread and blinked down the complete lyrics of <i>Sex on Fire</i> copied, pasted, and sent to Remus the evening prior. He did everything in his power not to succumb to the typical wave of amusement he felt whenever Sirius decided that was the best way of communicating his particular mood for it seemed quite inappropriate for the morbidity of the situation. Remus shot him a quick text with the same request his voicemail contained, took the stairs, and pushed through the lobby door out onto the sidewalk.
</p><p>
  He debated the choice between a taxi or a bus, and Remus cursed himself, wishing he’d sprang for a cheap car once settling in London, or that he wasn't too much of a nervous ninny to drive in the city for he’d be at Sirius’s in no time at all if he’d sucked it up and tried giving it a shot. He decided a taxi would get him there quicker when the chances of a bus coming along right as he got to the stop were far smaller than he needed them to be.
</p><p>
His ride showed up within mere minutes, something that he hoped for but certainly didn't bank on, and Remus thanked his lucky stars for it. The ride felt longer than it needed to when Dorcas lived much closer to Sirius’ than he did but he waited until the halfway mark to try again, and that truly was the most difficult thing he’d done all day. He got Sirius’ voicemail once again but didn’t bother leaving another, partly because of the driver up front and partly because he would have rathered Sirius simply call him back when he noticed the missed calls without bothering to check his voicemail.
</p><p>
  He set his phone in his lap and breathed. It could mean anything. Sirius could be out, could have missed the paper completely, or flipped straight to the crossword and hadn’t even given the obituary a second glance, but even as he told himself this, the image of Sirius lying in a heap at the foot of his bed flooded in, the red on his hand, the red on him, and Remus tried to keep from pulling off his thumbnail altogether for his brain took him to far more unsettling places from there. 
</p><p>
  To put his active mind to use he picked pulled out his mobile and looked the obituary up, satisfying a morbid curiosity that really didn't help in the least, not when one particular family member’s name didn't appear alongside the list of surviving family members; all of them distant and not as deserving a mention, and a horribly familiar feeling welled up in him. 
</p><p>
 Miraculously, the next time he looked up from his mobile the cabbie was turning down Sirius’s street. Remus shifted and pulled his bank card out a block from the flat, forced himself to be polite as he waited for the driver to boot up the interac machine and not be too irritated that it wasn't already raring to go. He tossed a thank you over his shoulder and climbed out of the backseat, took the stairs briskly, and didn’t bother with the spare key hidden under a frog statue by the front door as James and Sirius rarely bothered to lock it anyway. 
</p><p>
 Remus opened the door and nearly tripped over Sirius’ docs lying scattered in the entrance, and didn't curse their existence this time for they meant Sirius had to be in there somewhere. He toed his own shoes off even though the owners of the flat couldn’t care less if he did or didn’t, it was habitual and he still couldn’t shake it. He checked Sirius’ room first to no avail, headed down the hall, through the empty living room, and straight on into the kitchen to find Sirius in his usual spot by the window, stone-faced and holding a cigarette in his right hand, and Remus knew Sirius already knew. 
</p><p>
  Sirius looked up by the time Remus cleared the room, looking right startled. “I summoned you.”
</p><p>
  Remus knelt down, taking a glance over Sirius for marks or signs, anything, but his t-shirt showed his hands and arms bare, and that should have quelled him more than it did. He looked up at Sirius, his whole expression completely flipped, but he couldn’t take that at face value.
</p><p>
  Remus shook his head clear and lifted his right hand to the side of Sirius neck. “Wait, what did you say?” 
</p><p>
  “I pictured you and you appeared in my kitchen that same moment,” Sirius detailed, pressing his hands down Remus sides as though he were trying to prove he were truly in front of him, and that worried him even more.  
</p><p>
  “Are you OK?” Remus said as Sirius’ hands roamed. “I’ve been trying to call you— James, too; we’ve both been trying.” 
</p><p>
  Sirius blinked at that, shifting in his seat to pull his phone out of his back pocket and Remus head almost imploded on the spot.
  Sirius looked up from what no doubt had to be a collection of missed calls and gave a rather tight smile. “I left on silent."
</p><p>
  Remus breathed out then in, grateful Sirius’ silence hadn’t meant anything terrible but he had no control over the irritation burrowing in his gut. “Why’s it on silent?”
</p><p>
  “Have you met Rosmerta?” Sirius returned. 
</p><p>
  Remus bit back a retort, breathing out then in. “How long have you known?” he asked, thinking he might have deserved a gold statue for how well he managed to sound calm.
</p><p>
  Sirius glanced past Remus toward the clock on the stove. “Hour, little more,” he said, and nevermind; Sirius stole that statue right out of Remus' hands by sounding much more at ease than him, but his casual tone and simple shrug weren't well received when Remus spent the last half hour in a state. 
</p><p>
  “And you didn't call either of us?” he asked. 
</p><p>
  Sirius squinted. “I thought of the both of you plenty of times since I got off, on opposite ends of the city and with other people,” he said with a bit of a bite to it, “so you’ll excuse me if I left you both to it.”
</p><p>
  Remus’ breath hitched, his face reddening. “You didn't have to do that,” he insisted. “I'd have come -- I <i>did</i>, I came right away. James would have flapped his arms until he figured out how to fly here if he could have--”
</p><p>
  Sirius spoke on, pitching his voice louder to get the words out over Remus'. “And I appreciate that, but contrary to what they like to think the world doesn’t stop spinning because another Black family member got picked off, and yours shouldn’t either,” he said, as if it were washed and done.
</p><p>
  Remus dropped his head in an instant, set his forehead against Sirius’ collar, and closed his eyes for a few moments, forcing white hot rage down and replacing it a few longer moments later with something else. “Have you eaten?” he asked. He felt Sirius shake his head and he was glad for it if only for the chance to put his hands to good use. “I’ll make you something, then, OK?”
</p><p>
  Sirius gave a nod and Remus straightened up and moved to stand, instinctively pressing a kiss to Sirius’ forehead along the way, and before he got to his feet, Sirius leaned in to press one of his own to Remus’ neck and the small gesture was enough to send Remus’ stomach into a tizzy even now.
