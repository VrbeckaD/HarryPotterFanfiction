    <p>Friday morning. ... Friday mornings had changed for him, becoming a person or a colour almost.  It had taken a while for days to regain their substance and meaning, and a deal of healing to catch up, but now Friday morning signified the last day of the week, a day to spend looking forward to Saturday, to the weekend. The days had been traveling slowly, since the war and the cleanup that came next. and not just the cleanup of the school, that mess was easily swept under beds and hidden, but people needed cleaning too, cultures needed re shaping homes rebuilding around empty seats, new neighborhoods with new neighbors that would struggle for trust. cleanup after funerals clean up after parties, after weddings twice postponed and children conceived in the sudden shocking still and calm of the world. There was a lot of clean up, work hasn't returned to a regular schedule even months after His death, and the weeks in that time, and the few years before during the war, had simply been numbers to cross off on a calendar. but they were regaining substance. Wednesday felt green, number three of the week, one of Harry's favourite days. Saturday was red with energy and excitement and Sunday mulled down to a calmer purple slipping into blue Monday.</p><p>friday mornings he woke up to yellow light filtering through the window and the smell of the shower down the hall and coffee ready made sitting on the stove. he arched his back under the duvet and stretched out his spine, digging his heels into the soft mattress. he spent a moment suspended from the bed to think through the list of names in his head.</p><p>
  <em> sirius, remus, nymphadora, fred, albus, severus, cederic, amelia, regulus, charity, hedwig, alaster, bathilda, ted, dobby, vincant, colin, lavender </em>
</p><p>like a chant every spare moment of thought it played out in his head, dancing across his lips quietly and dampening his mood. Friday turned really grey quickly.  he rolled out of bed and pulled clothes onto his body. school started at nine. in the kitchen of their small flat ginny was buttering toast with the back of a teaspoon and scratching at her leg up on the counter next to the stove. Harry wrapped an arm around her shoulders and squeezed her gently, the wool knit of her jumper itched his face.</p><p>"You need a shave," Ginny told him, sucking the butter off the spoon and stirring her coffee with it. Harry cleaned out the perculator into the compost bin and ran water through it. he always needed to shave, every morning his chin was scratchy and ginny refused all kisses until he was smooth. and fair enough, he often thought her prickly unshaven legs under the sheets some nights were unbearable, so perhaps the small surface area of his chin was a small sacrifice. but a warm kiss in the morning would be nice one day.</p><p>he waved the percolator at Ginny and raised an eyebrow, asking silently if she needed a second cup, then fought off a yawn and missed the answer. He filled it up any way and threw it on the stove lighting the gas.</p><p>"skip potions with me later?'' The water was scalding when ginny turned the tap on to rinse out her mug and she dropped it in the sink, shattering. a swear word slipped out and she went hunting for her wand.</p><p>"No can do," Harry mused, flicking at the pieces, "I'm behind on my last assignment but I'll catch up with you at lunch still." ginny swatted his hand away and flicked a spell at the mug, the pieces flying back together and crackling into place. Harry watched the sink for a bit and ran through his list again in his head.</p><p>"stop doing that," Ginny swatted at his chest, inspecting the mug closely.</p><p>"doing what?" he watched as she filled it with water.</p><p>"picking at your nails, youll go blind that's what mum always says." the water ran through a hole in the bottom of the mug where a piece of it had fallen into the drain. ginny cursed the thing and threw it into the bin with malice.</p><p>"don't throw it out. I'll plant some chives in there," Harry mumbled, wiping his hands cautiously on his pants before fishing the pottery out of the trash to place gently on the windowsill next to the other herbs he had growing there, most in actual pots. "also i wont go blind, i'm already blind, and mollys are just being theatrical."</p><p>"lunas rubbing off on you," ginny rolled her eyes at him and went to sit in her chair. Ginny's chair was an old fold out armchair that did not close any more, salvaged from a removal truck doomed for the tip. it was layden in quilts and knitted blankets like a colourful bird nest and she didn't like other people sitting on it, disturbing the careful arrangement she had set up just right. Harry called her goldy locks, Ginny had no idea what that meant, and Harry had told her the story to which she had just laughed at and called silly.</p><p>"i'm gonna go shower, last chance for the toilet,"</p><p>Ginny waved her toast at him carelessly in a way of saying <em> all yours </em> and toed the on button on the tv.</p><p>Harry shaved quickly and put on Ginny's deodorant because he was out, slipping on black jeans a size too big and a grey button down he had been wearing all week, hitting it with a quick cleaning spell. to overcome his hair he had grown it out and it tied up easily and cleanly now, short hairstyles just didn't suit him as well. On his way back to the kitchen he knocked on Luna's door before pushing into her room, a mess of painted walls and pot plants and things suspended from the ceiling. she was good to live with, maintaining the little wizarding garden outside joyfully and providing some tranquility and bizarre relief from Ginny's overwhelming moods. she wasn't the cleanest house mate, nor did she make for the best conversation or cook very well, but she was a lovely soul. Harry often thought of her as a mermaid, lost from her ocean home but curious and knowledgeable about the world in ways no one else was.</p><p>"do you want coffee?" he asked, standing in the doorway. luna turned around from where she was crouching digging through a pile of clothes and sniffing each one. she was naked, but harry had grown used to this as her most comfortable state and leant down to sniff the shirt she held out to him. He shook his head and took it to put in the laundry later.</p><p>"yes please, can you put some roses in it this morning too? i need something clean.." she trailed off, sniffing a pair of underwear. harry nodded and left her to it, and threw the shirt into the laundry room. he had to heat up the coffee again and poured out two mugs, filling one with milk and honey and the other with rose petals they had drying in a mesh bag that hung from the curtain rod. he watched them suck up moisture and expand in the coffee as he stirred it, pulling one out to nibble on.</p><p>Ginny called out to him from her chair that his fly was undone when he got back to their living room. He did it up and sat on the couch, patting his lap for Ginny to join him. she threw herself onto him ungracefully, finally giving in and smooching his clean shaven face.</p><p>"so i've been thinking..'' Ginny started, wriggling around to sit next to Harry pressed up against his side. Harry raised an eyebrow at her, sipping his coffee curiously. "when the new season of masterchef starts.."</p><p>"don't you even finish that sentence," harry interrupted her, setting his mug down carefully and turning, "you are not watching it without me,"</p><p>"but when you're off doing extracurricular at school and what not it's such a hassle.." she probed him with a finger in the ribs, whining and sliding around the couch. "you can catch up on it when you get back, what's wrong with that?"</p><p>"it used to be our thing, the three of us on the couch! i introduced you two to it!" Harry exasperatedly explained, sitting straight and looking panicked. Ginny found it hysterical in her evil little way, giving him the look that roughly translated to<em> im doing it anyway now, especially because you're so worked up about it. </em></p><p>"fine. do what you want." Harry muttered, scooping up his mug to go sulk in his room for a few minutes before he had to go out for school.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"can you believe them? even luna! and she knows how much it means to me,"</p><p>there was a drought coming in through the window, a small section of it was missing and rimmed in small cracks. It let the late autumn air into the toasty classroom and Harry scowled at it. he was sitting his catchup years at a small wizarding school newley set up in Valleyton shire, a little wizarding community on the outskirts of Arberdeen enclosed by thick forest and deterrent trees that warded muggles from wandering willy nilly in and out of the area. there was a small community of centaurs that lived among the wizards, displaced from the war but otherwise content with the new surroundings. Many of the sixth and seventh year Hogwarts students who had fought in the war and couldn't bear to return had moved out there to redo and complete their final years of schooling. In light of the war several dozen houses and units had been erected on what used to be old farm land long abandoned, complete with a new movie theatre and electricity run off from the surrounding muggle townships. Harry found the shire to be a little enclosed sanctuary of well run community spirit and fresh nature, a fair comparison to the dystopia of the past.</p><p>"honestly i don't understand why you get so worked up about it," sean was saying, scratching down the notes their potions teacher was putting on the board. The potions professor was a stout little woman, in her late thirties and far from bubbly. Mis Vermont was american, she was strict and rough edged but spoke well, Harry found himself enjoying potions a little even, personality aside. He could actually learn from this woman.</p><p>"it's just a tv show, catch up on it later,"</p><p>Harry, trying to focus and not look quite so scandalised, snuck a peak and Sean's paper and copied his notes. He was far more organised and straight to the point than Harry was. "it was our thing though, we watched it together, and now im being excluded,"</p><p>"you're not being excluded, you're just dragging the team down so they are moving on without you," Sean said and flipped his page, continuing his writing. He looked up at Harry finally and frowned, "That was a bit harsh, sorry."</p><p>Harry shrugged, going through his list quickly.</p><p>"let me copy your notes, i like your layout,"</p><p>"Potter, Callum, are you done?" Mis V pulled a face at them, slinging her large fists up to rest on her hips. She had yellow lipstick on today which suited her, Harry noted, and nodded his head.</p><p>"carry on," harry shuffled his papers and coughed into his fist, giving a short nod. he scribbled down the rest of seans notes quickly into his book. he's had enough of parchment scrolls and quills, it had been fun at hogwarts but the innocent magic and impracticality of such a practice had surpassed him along his journey and he had bought muggle lined paper and ballpoint pens to use for his final catchup years of study. Many kids had chosen extended years, like Harry, running a more advanced and in depth seventh year over a two year period. They were almost finished with the first year having started the final term, and Harry was looking forward to the holidays the same way he had begun to look forward to weekends.</p><p>Then Draco Malfoy walked into the room and looked around, apologizing to the teacher for his tardiness. she rolled her eyes and indicated to the empty seat next to harry that trinity usually sat in. she was skipping potions to play quidditch with ginny as she was actually on top of the workload. Draco hesitated a moment and made eye contact with Harry for a second, who was trying his hardest to look indifferent. After Draco's trial and all the shit that happened post war, his father in prison and his mother's move to France for some much needed mental rest, Harry and Draco had come to a mutual understanding- to treat each other like classmates, nothing more and nothing less. there were no more snippy comments  thrown here or witty spells flicked there. it was mutual ground to leave each other alone to complete their final years of schooling in relative peace and harmony.</p><p>Draco strolled over steadily and pulled the chair out, sliding into the seat. He turned out a parchment and a muggle fountain pen from his satchel and settled in, spinning the pen in his slender fingers.</p><p>"do you need the notes?' Harry asked, flipping his page over to the theory mis v had already wiped off the board. draco looked across at him a little startled and confused. there were other empty seats in the room, but he had sat down where he was told to avoid any possible conflict. mis v didn't seem to like draco very much, he sensed it was his past that she disapproved of, and fair enough he thought. he also had not wanted to look on bad terms with harry potter, the boy who lived, the saviour, it would only serve to further damage his tarnished image. it was simply easier to take the seat next to him and hope for the best. Draco looked across at Harry's notes, neat scrawl poorly organised and rushed though they were, he tried a thin smile and thanked Harry and started copying the text down.</p><p>it was annoying actually, coping harry's notes. He kept flipping between pages to try to stay on top of the work mis v was slapping on the chalkboard while allowing Malfoy to write down what he'd missed. Draco felt mildly superior with his parchment roll, he wouldn't have this problem if Harry had just stuck to good old wizard schooling equipment. but draco also found it a little.. kind, perhaps, for want of a better word, that harry was clumsily making an effort to lend a hand.</p><p>The class was instructed to split up into pairs to complete the next assignment and as they were dismissed to rummage the storage cupboard mis v dodged through the students over to harry. she stared at him for a moment and signed heavily. draco was still sitting next to him furiously scribbling down the notes off the board, anticipating the scolding he was going to get after potter.</p><p>"You missed the hand in date of the last potion," she told Harry, Draco felt a little bad for listening in, '' I'll be needing it by the start of next week. I have to grade all the potions before I can give out scores and feedback. can you get it into me by then?" mis v leaned a chubby fist on his desk, her knuckles cracking under her weight loudly. Harry stifled a yawn that he felt trying to bubble out of him at an inappropriate moment and nodded his head, lifting his thumbs into the air.</p><p>"And you, Mister Malfoy” she turned to draco, “ this is the third time you've shown up late to my class," she chirped ruefully, Harry sat there sheepishly with his head down pretending not to hear and picking at his thumbnail "do you not value my precious time?"</p><p>"no, ,no no I do value it, I really do," Draco stumbled, grimacing, "I'm sorry I just missed my alarm, won't happen again." It was a weak excuse and he could feel her disappointment. but it was the truth and he really couldn't see any other way to escape telling her this. a lie would have sounded far worse and he was trying so hard this year to set things right, to make good impressions and argue less.</p><p>"help potter catch up would you?" mis v sayd, leaving them to yell at myrtle for dropping a bottle of fly wings. Harry looked at malfoy and tried out a smile which looked more like a grimace. draco returned the look and rubbed his temples.</p><p>"alright there i'm not that terrible, i just fell behind a little," harry muttered, gathering his things into his bag and pulling out the ingredient list for last weeks potion, "i won't drag your grades down,"</p><p>"I didn't even say anything," Draco mumbled through his hands. He read over the week's potion ingredient list for a sleeping drought feeling a little smile tickle his lips. He could use this one. Then he looked across at Harry who was still sitting next to him and things clicked together in his head. "were not partnering up." he said, shaking his head emphatically.</p><p>"you heard her, help me catch up.'' Harry pulled a hairband off his wrist and held it in his teeth, gathering his hair behind his head. He tied it off in a really shit bun and rolled his shoulders. Then he caught dracos eye and jerked, his eyes widening, "i mean, you don't have to if you don't want to, you don't owe me anything.." he trailed off.</p><p>draco studied him for a second and sighed, gathering his things together. "You get the ingredients for last week's healing potion, I'll round up the other ones," he told Harry, already getting to his feet. He wanted to grab a little extra, make maybe a little more than they needed, a little something for himself to get through the rest of the term. "ill owl you and we can meet up at some point,"</p><p>harry nodded and slung his jacket over his shoulder, "sounds good,"</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>draco woke screaming beside his bed, clutching at his stomach and the bedframe. he kicked out of the tangled sheets and stumbled into the shower, pulling clothes off and discarding them under the warm spray of water. he would worry about them later, for now he just held himself and turned the temperature up higher, the strong pressure of the faucet digging into his back soothingly. god he hated weekends. Pansy and Blaise had moved away with their families who had come out the other side of the war still with money and a little pride. Draco got letters from pansy every tuesday from her viller in thailand where she was settling down nicely and attending a small catch up school. their owls took four days to travel the distance so she got his replies on friday, draco always wrote back right away. Blaise didn't have much to say and they only sent eachother mail for milestones, like blaises 19th birthday. there was no special party to celebrate, he had moved to australia three months ago and before that he was in france. Draco had sent him a beautifully worded letter congratulating him for ageing and a picture of the pine forest outside his little unit in valleyton shire.</p><p>weekends were bothersome without anyone to do anything with. Draco had invested in a television at pansie's recommendation, she had one in her dorm room and rattled off a bunch of tv shows  he should be keeping up to date with. many of their letters were about said shows they enjoyed, and movies they had seen. without the tv and school work he could catch up on draco feared he might lose his mind on the weekends. there was nothing to do in the little town. there was the forest sure, far kinder than the dark forest had known at hogwarts. Draco had found a few little walking trails through the dense foliage and sometimes indulged in wandering along them, he collected potions ingredients when he came across them, sometimes even a little collection of jars had started to grow in his kitchen pantry. The little shire offered the cinema, no new movies were shown there but he enjoyed watching the repetes when home life really got to him. The market intimidated Draco a little, all the people he saw he knew knew him, could see into his darkened soul and he wasn't quite ready to face all the people. He only went there for his weekly shop, often spotting other people in his classes. There was also a small library and bookshop where he had purchased a dictionary of potions ingredients, inspired by the ferns and mushrooms he found in the forest.</p><p>Draco actually had quite an impressive library, inheriting most of its books from the manors collection. He had written out a list of his favourite books for a house elf to pick up for him, not daring to enter the cursed building himself. so his favourite books rested proudly and relieved away from the dark literature found in the halls of his once home.</p><p> draco pulled himself out of the shower, clenching and unclenching his fists to stop his fingers from shaking. what a way to start his sunday. he looked at himself in the mirror and frowned at a growing bruise on his forehead where he must have hit his head in his writhing sleep. he pulled open the second draw where his products were kept, fine hair conditioner and tea tree shampoos, aftershave that smells like cinnamon and pine needles and a cologne he had found in a muggle store that took to his fancy, and a little bottle of fresh healing potion that he had made in class last week. he dabbed it onto the bruise on his face and ran a comb through his hair while he waited for the potion to settle into his skin.</p><p>there came a thumping from the main entrance making draco jump, and he recognised the sound of the brass knocker on his front door. draco towelled himself dry and rummaged through the draw for his hair jell, waiting for whoever it was to either state themselves or leave. he found the gell and slicked it through his hair, combing the sides down. he would need to get it cut again soon, it was unrule at the back.</p><p>The knock came a second time and Draco frowned, scratching at a scab in his eyebrow. then something clicked in his head and he slipped into a bathrobe, museing at the time.</p><p>"I'm sorry, come in," Draco huffed, a little embarrassed as he opened the door. harry stared at him for a second while draco squinted at the bright sunlight that streamed in through the doorway. he hadn't anticipated sleeping in so late, it was 12:36 according to his clock. he left harry in the doorway to decide for himself weather he would come inside and angrily opened up some curtains, filling the unit with light. he vowed to leave the curtains open at night from then on. "I won't be a minute, sit down anywhere," Draco said and hurried to his room. He threw on a silver knit jumper and trouser pants and his favourite socks with the grip on the bottom so he wouldn't slide about on his polished wooden floors.</p><p>Harry was sitting at his kitchen bench, which doubled as Draco's dining table and desk, looking about uncertainty. draco felt self conscious, like he himself was under scrutiny.</p><p>Harry noted the stylish benchtop and cupboard doors, their little silver handles. The room was small and cosy and there was a collection of jars in the corner behind a vase of little white flowers that were on their last legs. The oven and stove top was modern and muggle and there was a fridge with little asian magnets stuck to it. Even the bench stool Harry sat on was stylish, a black frame with little brown cushions.</p><p>"i like your place," he offered up eloquently, looking at draco now fully clothed standing nervously in the doorway. The pressure seemed to be let out of him for a second and his shoulders slumped in relief he didn't even know he was waiting on. draco nodded and set about setting up a cauldron on the stovetop unhurriedly, pouring a measurement of aqua into it to start boiling.</p><p>"did you bring a cauldron?" He turned to Harry, examining his mish matched outfit. He had a red collared shirt under a thick black jacket with wooden buttons and a terrible thin knitted scarf in purples and browns. To top it off he was wearing corduroy trousers. but he looked good in it somehow. Maybe it was the olive skin and the soft green eyes, and Draco found himself shivving his imagination for thinking such sentences.</p><p>"Yeah alright," Harry grunted, rummaging in his satuel and producing a cheap copper cauldron. He walked around the counter and set it up next to Dracos, going back to his bag to find his notes.</p><p>Draco was actually a surprisingly good potions teacher Harry discovered. He knew what he was doing and did not hesitate making decisions. it gave harry a little confidence, he was better to work with than ron who chatted too much and got them both side tracked. ron and hermione both had chosen to fast track their catchup years. Ron chose to because he hated school and prefered working in the joke shop he and George were trying to revamp, and Hermione had too many ideas and career paths she wanted to explore. They were in different classes to Harry, their classes going at a different pace to his, and Harry didn't mind. He had spent the last eight years of his life with them and he knew they would always be there for him when he needed them. it was nice, he felt more grown up and in control on his own.</p><p>Draco showed him where he was doing things incorrectly with his brewing techniques without being insulting, and Harry found himself relaxing into the small kitchen area easily. it shocked him how easily he was able to move on from hatred and scepticism and unease to this comfortable environment he found himself in. he got distracted sometimes, looking at draco and the way he moved, trying to piece together how this could be the same person as the boy on the astrology tower, or in the bathroom, or the scared little kid in the dark forest who easily abandoned him to save his own skin. and draco would catch harry staring and scowl at him and ask <em> what </em>and harry would recite his list, faltering on the word albus.</p><p>Harry felt himself creeping inside his skin, it was uncomfortable. The more comfortable he became with Draco the more he felt dislike for himself.</p><p>"where's your bathroom?" Harry asked, after passing Draco a stirring stick without even being asked, he had just instinctively known what draco meant when he twitched a finger in its direction. it wouldnt do to be this comfortable with this man, who had killed others and enabled murder in a school. Harry needed air. his lungs were tight and he felt his heart in his chest.</p><p>draco studied him with an eye, the other concentrating on the potion making sure to stir it appropriately. "first door to the left," he said, nodding at the short hall. Harry thanked him and pulled himself towards it, grasping at the wall for support as if his knees would give out at any moment.</p><p>The bathroom was stylish and small, a sink and draw below a round mirror on the wall, a toilet wedged in the corner and a pokey bath wedged between two walls with a black stainless shower head protruding from the ceiling. A little fern hanging next to it thriving in the humidity. The room was tiled in white with a thin line of pink glass tiles running around all the walls at waist height. Harry sat on the toilet lid and squeezed his hands together, his knee jumping around. He said his list in his head, once, twice, then out loud in a whisper, and again louder. like a chant he recited his list between knee bounces over and over until his body relaxed and stilled. Harry sat up straight and rolled his shoulders. He looked at himself in the mirror and turned the tap on, washing his face and hands.  He thumbed the little tin box in his chest pocket but left it alone. in the reflection of the mirror he noticed a pile of clothes in the bathtub, soaking wet.<em> a bit of an odd place to do your laundry, he </em> mused. Harry gave himself one last glance and composed himself and went back to the kitchen.</p><p>"You find it alright?" Draco said, scraping the diced ferns into the sleeping drought with an obsidian blade. He was side eyeing Harry, who was paler than before. Harry scowled at him and picked up his notes, reading over the next step instead of responding. dracos brow furrowed and he looked away, somewhat disappointed. He had begun to feel at ease with Harry being in his home, brewing potions with him in his kitchen. perhaps he had imagined it.</p><p>"what happened to your face?" Harry asked, uncorking a bottle of brandy. He looked around for a measuring cylinder and Draco handed him one without being asked. it made Harry's stomach churn and he grimaced, accepting it from draco.</p><p>Draco touched his forehead, it wasn't painful anymore but rather at the itchy stage of healing. He had hoped Harry might not have noticed it but felt no such luck. and Draco was faced with the dilemma of answering that question. so many responses ran through his head;<em> had a dream about you, in the bathroom, </em>  or <em> i had a nightmare and fell out of bed like a scared child </em> or <em> remember that one time you sliced me open? </em> but they were all inadequate responses. they would only serve to drive a steak between them and whatever progress they were making towards being something like, not quite friends, buddies perhaps. they may even descend back into arguments and snide comments, and Draco was surprised to find he didn't want that. that he had moved on and matured past the childish whims of fighting for fun and stirring shit. He felt like he could try to be a good student without the outliers.</p><p>"nothing," he settled for an appropriate answer to save face. it was better he held some ground, kept his space. He wouldn't check up on Harry's health. asking if harry was alright was what he had granger and the weasleys for. Draco was just helping him with his homework, and he  feared the word just in that thought the same way he felt saved by it.</p><p> </p><p>The potions had to be left to simmer for an hour, which was why they were a homework task. their lessons were only fifty minutes. Draco thanked Morgana for that, he wasn't sure if he could survive any longer with the potions master. Or perhaps it was simply the classroom he didn't like. He had made a few acquaintances whom he could rely on to pass him the work he missed, all local kids which made up the bulk of students at school, but draco couldn't bring himself to do anything more with these people, he wasn't sure if he could call them friends and therefore didn't do any friend activities with them. He went on his walks alone and bought single discounted student tickets at the cinema and lived by himself. He had his cat, Brenton, who spent most of its days sleeping on draco's bed. Sometimes it would join him foraging out in the forest, chasing after the insects, but that was the most physical activity it seemed capable of.</p><p>Harry accepted a delicate mug of tea which he insisted draco didn't put enough honey in and perched awkwardly on the edge of a chair. They were on the little wooden balcony that looked out at the forest, a small latch gate leading down petite stairs to a path on the left side. Hanging plants swung lazily from the gutter and a fat white cat had come out to join them. He and draco stared intently at the hour glass on the table, avoiding eye contact and otherwise ignoring each other. Draco pulled up a seat, quite intentionally but subtly, away from Harry and sat down with his own mug. The cat rubbed its face against his thigh and gracefully swung its body onto his lap.</p><p>“His names Brenton,” Draco said, petting the cat's head fondly. Harry tore his eyes from the sand and his features softened. The corners of his mouth turned upwards slightly and draco noticed his fingers twitch, like he was stopping himself from touching the cat. </p><p>“Okay, “ Harry sipped his tea and picked at his nails, “he's a bit fat,” he said, nodding at the cat. Draco looked down, his features pulled upwards, and nodded in agreeance.</p><p>“It's the first time i've seen him move today,” draco confessed, jiggling his knee so the cat would look up at him. </p><p>Harry felt a little exposed on dracos behalf. It was the first time he had seen the pokey blond open up, his gentle actions so at odds with the image Harry had built up of him in his mind. Of course, Harry knew he couldn't have been evil all the time. Back at Hogwarts Harry had built visions of him scheing in his dorm room with the other slytherins, rubbing his fingertips together, but he knew they were false images. Draco had to have had his down time back then, he would have softened up for his friends, Harry was sure of it. He had only ever really been on the receiving end of all draco's worst and nastiest moods. It was bizarre, almost surreal to be sitting on his balcony sipping tea and watching him talk fondly about his chubby cat. He was almost content, which put him on edge. He recited his list to remind him of who he was with.</p><p>Draco glanced up at Harry, furrowing his brows. Harry's knee was bouncing and he was muttering to himself, a silent chant, like a curse or incarnation and draco felt a jolt in his chest. Then the brunet noticed him and stilled, looking a little annoyed and embarrassed for a passing moment. Harry pulled a small tin container of herbal cigarolls from the chest pocket of his jacket. Luna had introduced him to them when she caught him having a panic attack back in his first term at this new school. He'd known her to smoke a little pot from time to time on the astrology tower at Hogwarts with a few cheeky hufflepuffs and wasn't surprised when she pushed some of her hippy smokes on him in his moments of panic. And to his surprise they had actually helped calm him. They sometimes went out to the forest to pick wild jage leaves and collect absynth flowers that they dried in the kitchen and rolled. Ginny didn't partake in smoking, she didn't approve of it, wanting to be in peak fitness and health for her quidditch. She had shown some promise and there were rumours of holly harpie scouts being sent out to the schools next game. </p><p>Harry looked at draco, “you don't mind do you?” he asked, indicating to the half smoked cigaroll he had produced from the tin. Draco shook his head, watching as Harry's knee stilled for a moment while he conjured a flame wandlessly and held it to his face to light the roll, sucking in blue tinged smoke. It curled through his stubby fingers, strong and calloused and nail bitten.</p><p>Dracos stomach flipped as he recognised the feeling of attraction. He shook the cat off his lap and stood up suddenly, declaring something about checking on the potions. He closed the door gently behind him, not wanting to come off as irritated, and went to the bathroom. His wet clothes were still in the tub, he thumbed his forehead in frustration and embarrassment and threw them into the laundry room and went to stand over the potions. Draco would not be attracted to Harry potter. But he could already feel strong arms wrap around his waist and pull him back into a firm body, he could feel warm breath on the back of his neck and stubble graze his jaw, soft lips on his cheek. He was thrown back to sixth year, the little fling he had had with jordan, the soft hufflepuff boy who had seen right through him and held him regardless, had kept their secrets and indulged draco in a kindness he hadn't deserved, and whom had left humbly and with understanding when draco had lashed out fearfully. </p><p>He shook his head. These were forbidden thoughts, forbidden memories. Draco was stronger now, on his own away from his parents, away from the war and the dark lord,  far away from his past decisions and getting further with each passing day. He would not impede his progress with thoughts of such nature.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harry was sitting on the floor with Brenton in his lap smoking another cigaroll when draco finally dared to go back outside. There was still a quarter of sand in the hourglass and he was feeling tired despite the afternoon sun. He just wanted to finish up quickly and have a sandwich and maybe a good wank and go to bed. But Harry was still there, invading his space and petting his cat, and Draco felt obliged to be at least civil. Draco offered Harry another tea which he turned down. Harry was no longer shaking or chanting, he looked content and lazy in the yellow glow and draco resented him for that, and the fond feeling he got in the pit of his stomach. </p><p>Harry saw draco watching him and raised an eyebrow like a fool, like a bloody fool with no self awareness. His scar had begun to fade finally, the jagged edges and tendrils of a lightning strike dulling and softening into his skin finally after all these years. Hair was escaping from the band that secured most of it behind his head and danced over his cheeks with the chilly wind. Smoke curled up over his hand, held away from the cat politely, and Draco felt the urge to pluck the cat back and collect his mug and send Harry away. He fit too snugly into draco's home. </p><p>Then Harry did the unthinkable, probably because he was a little content and tired and high, and held the cigaroll out to draco. who , to his credit, did very well at hiding his shock. He inspected the best approach to the situation quickly; <em> shake his head politely, decline blatantly, wave a dismissing hand and shoo the smoke away, take the bloody thing and </em> smoke with potter <em> on his little balcony like good old chums </em>. But he took too long thinking and Harry had come to his senses, a clarity sliding over his eyes, and he snuffed the cigaroll out on his boot. Draco thought it was a very considerate action, a lesser man would have risked scorching the wood slats of the floor. He watched Harry slide the half smoked roll back into the tin where it fit loosely next to several others, and sat down on a chair. It had been a close call.</p><p>“How uh,” draco started, not sure where the sudden need to fill the silence came from, “how are you doing in history class?” he asked stupidly. Harry gazed at him, his head lulled back and forth with idiot serenity. He considered his answer for a minute, wiping his face with his hands and scratching the cat behind the ears. His only answer was a shrug for a time.</p><p>“Sands almost out,'' Harry muttered and scooped the cat into his arms gently as he stood, “we should finish brewing.” Draco darted to the door and opened it, letting Harry and the cat inside. </p><p>He instructed Harry on the best way to chop the bore root and kept a close eye on him, not sure if brewing slightly stoned was the best idea. But Harry was diligent and careful and more concentrated than before so draco didn't say anything on the matter. He pondered while he stirred whether Harry ever attended classes in that state, and thought the answer was most likely a yes, he did. Then he considered how often, and why he'd never noticed. Which he supposed was the same reason he hadn't noticed his attraction until sixth year when Jordan had spelled it out for him. He had been avoiding the matter furiously, when it would have been easier to face head on in hindsight. Harry was a reasonable man and draco was sure he would have understood, spared some empathy in light of draco's dialemmer. Instead Draco had bullied him for years, a more extreme form of playground pigtail pulling backed up by poor parenting and prophecies that enabled self entitlement. </p><p>Harry had noticed draco staring. He kicked himself, wincing in embarrassment, that he had actually offered draco a smoke. Like an idiot, Draco had stared at him, visibly confused, and Harry thought he had maybe only been that self conscious once or twice before. He looked down at the cat who was rubbing itself against his ankles and shook his head. </p><p>“Idiot,” he told the cat, sighing, and turned back to his notes, “bloody idiot.”</p><p>“What now?” Draco looked at him, still stirring rhythmically, “what did you do wrong?” he snapped his fingers at Harry and pointed to the chopped bore root which Harry handed to him. </p><p>“Nothing, nothing, you just keep up with the stirring,” Harry muttered darkly and looked into the other cauldron. It was the right colour at least</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p> </p><p>“You had a good day,” Luna told Harry, dusting nothing of his shoulders and blowing on his face. Harry had just gotten home, he was still wearing his jacket, standing in the doorway waiting for Luna to finish her ever changing greeting rituals. She grabbed his hand and sniffed his fingers, raising an eyebrow at him and twisting his fingers into a fist. She patted his knuckles, “Come smoke with me,” she said and pulled him to the back door. </p><p>Harry yelled his greetings to Ginny who was in her chair struggling with history of magic homework and threw his satchel at his room, watching it bounce into the laundry closet instead. Luna Released him and bounced down the wooden steps onto the tame lawn, turning in time to watch as Harry tripped on the lip of the dorway and fell down the stairs, rolling ungracefully. He came to a stop on his back looking up at the sky. It was just gone dusk, the clouds were tinged pink and orange and he spent a moment just gazing at them. He didn't feel embarrassed around Luna, she was busy picking grass and dropping it onto his head. No, he thanked Merlin Ginny hadn't seen him do that just then. The merciless minutes of teasing he would have had to endure had she bared witness to that tumble.</p><p>Harry could smell the sage in their garden and the pot he and luna had growing under the house and the earth beneath him and felt whole and connected for a precious moment. He liked to collect these moments, to look back on later when things got a little disconnected.</p><p>“I hate that little lip in the doorway too,” Luna said, reading Harry's mind. Harry let luna pull him to his feet and joined her on the edge of a wooden garden bed. She patted his hair, picking grass out of it and apologising for having put it there in the first place. The air was chilly and little nocturnal bugs were waking up and flitting about, glowing in the dimming light. Luna smelt like lavender oil and hazelnuts, she pulled a joint from her bra and held it out for Harry to light. He picked at the dormant tomato plant behind him as she smoked, the front wispy pieces of her hair singing on the glowing end. Harry tucked them behind her ear for her gently.</p><p>"You got your potions done then? All up to date?" She passed him the joint and tied the front of her cardigon up waiting patiently for Harry to answer. Harry watched the rolled bud smoulder and go cold in his fingers for a minute, nodding absently. He lit it again and breathed in deeply, grinning at Luna who asked suddenly "how is draco?"</p><p>Harry coughed and raised an eyebrow at her, considering his answer carefully. Luna had heart enough to ask about even Voldemort's health. "He seems lonely," Harry mused, looking to the back door as Ginny stomped her way outside, clearly frustrated beyond belief at her homework. She threw herself onto the grass in front of Harry and wiggled her fingers at him. Harry slid his hand into hers and squeezed it, but she slapped him away.</p><p>"Not you, give me bud," Ginny fussed, wriggling around to rest her back against Harry's legs. Harry passed her the joint skeptically, breathing a cloud of bluish smoke onto the top of her head and laughed stupidly when she started coughing and sputtering. Luna confiscated the weed. </p><p>"What are you lot chatting about?"  giny groaned as Harry started rubbing her shoulders, arching her back into his touch. </p><p>"My day studying  with Malloy, he seems more… manageable than he used to be," Harry murmured, starting to feel both light and heavy from the drugs. He smiled to himself a little, "Malloy has a chubby cat called brendon or brenton or something." </p><p>Luna nodded, swaying with the head motion, "Yes he's mentioned the cat, we're good friends in herbology class." Harry was sure she was exaggerating  the <em> good friends </em>part but didn't bother to say anything. Luna had been asked to move up a year in herbology, the grade below was full and she was top of the class anyway, she was doing really well at senior herbology from what Harry had heard. </p><p>"You never mentioned that," Ginny swatted at Luna's knee, accepting the joint from her but keeping it away from her face. Harry took it, holding it in his lips while he messed with ginny's hair, looping and knotting it loosely. </p><p>“You better not be knotting my hair,” Ginny grumbled, turning sharply to look at harry. He smiled politely and shook his head, ash dropping onto ginny's shoulder. She brushed it off and turned away and Harry quickly raked his fingers over her scalp, marveling at the deep red colour of her curls. Luna plucked the joint from Harry's lips just before he got burnt and snuffed it out on Ginny's shoe. She had a thing against putting fire near grass, something about attracting a little gremlin creature that protects good lawns, and luna was always without shoes apart from at school where they were sort of a requirement. Even then though she wore sandals and socks, something most of the muggle born kids cringed at.</p><p>“Draco is rather polite isn't he,” Luna said out of the blue, shucking grass seeds and nibbling on them. Ginny burst out a short laugh and Harry scoffed at her, then considered the statement for a moment and found himself in agreeance. He had been polite, all year at school Harry had observed this out of character behavior being displayed in the classes they shared. He had been polite and reasonable and he was a good potions teacher, not that he would ever admit that out loud to anyone.</p><p>“He's a good potions teacher,” </p><p>Harry looked around and realised it was him who had spoken. Damn weed, he shouldn't smoke around people. “I mean, he wasn't mean to me, and he knows what he's doing,” Harry should have just stopped at that first statement but wasn't quite able to control his tongue so it seemed. Luna smiled at him broadly, nodding along.</p><p>“I really am quite fond of his cat, we should get another one,” she hummed, then broke into a song quietly.</p><p>“You haven't even met his cat luna, it could be a horrible beast for all you know,” ginny spoke up, letting her grin shine through in her words, “malfoy would only tell you the good stories of his cat, he's too proud to admit the thing probably shits inside or something,”</p><p>“Actually, it's a very polite cat,” harry heard himself saying, ”ten out of ten i think we should get another one, a friend for tybalt,”</p><p>"You sound fond of the cat harry," Ginny mused, "Are you fond of malfoys cat?" </p><p>Luna was still mumbling her nonsensical song, holding a finger out for the glowing bugs to land on. The sky was dark now and the air was closer to frosty than chilled, but Harry felt warm where his fingers rested on ginny's shoulders, her hands covering them, and he knew what fondness really was.</p><p>"No-" he started, then changed his mind, amused, "actually I think I might be."</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco malfoy took a swig of the sleeping drought he and harry had made together and lay down in bed, tucking the blankets in close to his sides. He thought about the word <em> together, </em> and very much liked it. He wanted to do more things together with people, with Harry. He had done enough healing on his own and felt ready for the stuff he had to do <em> together </em> . He felt motivated, Draco thought he might book a port key to Thailand, hang around pansy for a while, go out for sneaky drinks like the old days. He thought of flying to Australia on a muggle plane, making a real <em> adventure </em> of the trip to see his dear friend Blaize, getting a tan, or horribly sunburnt. He felt new energy to do <em> things </em>. Draco made a note to take brenton for a walk through the forest after school tomorrow, collect some rose petals from the late blooming kid bears roses he'd seen budding on his last walk. Harry had smelt like roses and coffee.</p><p>Draco lay in bed growing heavy and happy and let his mind wander freely for the first time in ages. </p><p>His first conversation with jordan in sixth grade, out in the forest for a herbology lesson looking for bracken ferns, slipped through his memory. Jordan had approached him openly and unafraid, introducing himself and holding out a dirty hand for draco to shake. It had been on a day when his usual possy, crabbe and goyal, were in detention for something Draco hadn't bothered to commit to memory, and he had been feeling relaxed without peer pressure to be a twat. Draco had even shaken Jordan's hand, maybe he had even smiled.</p><p>Jordan was tall and stocky, he was pale and freckled and angular. Draco weakened when his voice dropped to a low whisper, or when Jordan's sandy curls fell over his eyes. He liked to count his freckles, the ones that spotted the bridge of his nose and eyebrows and covered his arms. He looked good in knits and sweaters and the colour yellow draco discovered over the short months of their secret relationship.</p><p>And Jordan had seen right through him there in the forest, Draco could remember the look in his eyes. Jordan had noted the change in dracos posture, how content he seemed in solitude, and draco had felt fear and relief  swamp him. Fear that he was so revealing, that he had let his guard down, that someone may have been able to slip between the plates of armour Draco wore round the clock. And relief that he might have found someone to shed it with.</p><p>His memory jumped forward in time, to their first kiss in the kitchens under the great dining hall. His back was to a small pantry door that rattled with age when he leaned on it, and the vast room was warm and smelt toasty. Jordan had approached carefully, stepping into draco's space like he was approaching a fox ready to bolt. He reached out and took Draco's hand gently and leaned in, his chin grazing dracos cheek, gritty with stubble. </p><p>"Can I kiss you?" Harry's voice sang out in his head.</p><p>draco snapped awake and found himself launched upright in bed. Why was Potter's voice in his memory? How cold he have allowed himself to get so distracted as to let Harry <em> intrude </em> him in such a way. He tried to think back to the memory but the boy that had once been there in the kitchen grew taller, his blackened, skin darkened, freckles faded and his eyes bloody bloomed emerald green. </p><p>It wasn't appropriate, it simply would not do to think like that, but his mental battling grew futile and he gave in and slid a palm over the front of his boxers. He could feel warm arms wrap around his body, tough and battle worn and muscular. Harry's calloused fingers dug into his waist hungrily and held draco close against his hot body. a steaming mouth slid down his throat and bit at his shirt Impatiently, draco slipped his fingers between the fabric and pressed against a warm nipple. He could imagine Harry's presence, the space he would take up in his bed, in his room, in the building Draco was making his, a house starting to feel like a home. He could feel how Harry might fit into the space and complete it. Draco arched his hips into his hand and rubbed himself harder. </p><p>Merlin he felt disgusted with himself, he felt dirty and stupid and pathetically alight with sensation. Like a cat in heat he rolled over and rutted against the soft sheets on his bed. Half suffocating with his face pressed into his pillow draco came onto them with a muffled groan, twitching against the fabric.</p><p>He felt lethargic and heavy suddenly, with the burden of what he had just done. The weight of the sleeping drought finally pulled him under its wing and he slept soundly in his own filth until dawn.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p> </p><p>Luna skipped into the greenhouse cheerfully, humming to herself a song she had had stuck in her head all week. Ginny gave her a blue flower that Harry had given Ginny in the morning, a very confusing chain of events that had led up to it being in Luna's hand. She gazed at it for a minute while her herbology teacher Pots cracked onto her for being late again. She explained that it was Monday, and Harry had left his curtain open allowing the verrigors into their home which had made her sleep really heavily. Pots had argued something ridiculous about how <em> those things don't exist </em> and Luna spied draco watching them from across the glass room. Luna had excused herself, allowing pots to continue his lecture, and wandered over to the shy blond kid.</p><p>"Hello draco," she greeted him cheerfully, slipping for a moment into humming that song. Draco observed Luna almost fearfully for a second while she sang, her back to pots who were looking quite mad while also trying to hold it together and teach the rest of the class. Luna was lucky she always did well on assessments.</p><p>"Good morning lovegood," draco chimed quietly, his eyes flitting between the ditsy shoeless lady in front of him and the demonstration going on about correct re potting of venomous wormtail weed. Something gently brushed Draco's hand making him jump and yelp, turning a few heads in his direction embarrassingly. He looked down and saw luna trying to pass him a little stem of dainty blue flowers like some kind of organised drug deal. He wondered for a second if the flowers were a drug, but he'd seen them growing in the front of the school and decided they were probably safe. </p><p>"here." draco took the flower between his fingers, twirling it around. "From Harry," Luna grinned at him, having already forgotten the whole story, and stood next to draco. She paid attention to the rest of the demonstration, smiling politely at pots, seemingly oblivious to dracos dilemma. </p><p>Sometimes Luna just said weird things, draco knew that, but he couldn't tear his eyes away from the delicate blue petals. What had she really meant by that, was the flower handed to Luna from Harry, and she had then decided to pass it on to him? Or had Harry asked Luna to pass it on? A little extension of the metaphorical olive brace, was Harry looking to be perhaps friends? In which case, why the flower? Draco could feel himself slipping into a little crisis and tried to snap back to reality where the other students had already moved on and were slipping into elbow length leather gloves.</p><p>Luna appeared out of nowhere and handed draco a yellow set of gloves to <em> match the ones </em> shed <em> picked out for herself </em>. Draco thanked luna politely, suddenly unsure of where to put the flower. He fumbled with it for a second then slipped it into his satchel, in one of the side pockets where it shouldn't get lost. He looked up and turned red, realising luna had been watching him. She smiled politely and grabbed draco's sleeve to pull him over to an empty bench where they could work. </p><p>“Would you like to join me for a stroll this evening?” luna asked airily, her elbow brushing against dracos so he knew she was talking to him instead of the other students on their workbench. It was funny hearing luna speak so formally and properly. Draco supposed she was putting it on a little to impress him or something, he thought they were thoughts luna might have. </p><p><em> A stroll, </em> draco thought, <em> what would a stroll entail? </em> He figured she would take him through the forest, or maybe down to the market, was it a date? No, it couldn't be, perhaps she thought they were friends. They were certainly friend <em> ly, </em>but would she consider draco in that way? </p><p>“Where are you planning on strolling?” draco asked the safest question that came to mind, looking round for people who might be listening in. but everyone seemed busy with their own conversations, and concentrating on not being poisoned by the little seedlings they were burying in larger plastic pots.</p><p>“There's a little walking path I like, always covered in moss. Did you know the niplets that spread it live in the creek down that way? I want to find some,” luna petted the seedling she was holding gently, roughing up its roots to get the soil off them, “also bring your cat, i want to meet him.”</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco pulled the little blue flower from his bag. Some of the petals were bent and it was looking very sad and droopy, but the colours were still vibrant. He still felt unsure about what to do with it, he didn't feel comfortable just throwing it outside or into the bin. A real friend, that's what luna had called draco and herself, had given it to him- maybe even passed it on to him from another possible friend. Draco hadn't felt bold enough to press further about what she had meant, but he found that he liked the thought of harry asking luna to give him a little flower. He would quite like for it to happen in person. Jordan had often slipped flowers into his pockets..</p><p>But what to do with the one he had now? He could put it in a cup of water and keep it for a day or two, he could press it, but that often squished the colour from flowers. Draco considered these options seriously for a while, hunched over his kitchen bench cradling the dainty flower in his fingertips. He decided to dry it with a cleaver little spell he had picked up from his fourth year transfiguration book, spelling all the water from it so the flowers wouldn't lose their shape or colour. </p><p>Draco emptied the vase of dead flowers that had been sitting on his kitchen counter in the corner for longer than they should have and washed it out quickly. It was far too big for the single stem, so he strunk it, praying it wouldn't crack like pottery sometimes did. </p><p>The flower looked nice on his windowsill lapping up the afternoon sun. </p>
