</h2><p>Harry watched his best friend pace their small cell, tears streaking his face, hands balled into white-knuckled fists. Another tortured scream rent the air, and Harry couldn't stand it. He tried the bars again, shaking them with all his might, but they refused to give.</p><p>
  <span>Hours had gone by in this hell, listening to Hermione struggle against their captors and suffer for it. His face still hurt like hell, but no one dared attempt to heal it. If their captors realized he was Harry Potter, they would just kill them all and be done with it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had half begun to wish they would get it over with already. Almost anything would be better than standing here, helpless, while Hermione screamed herself hoarse upstairs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, she stopped, and Harry realized the silence was far worse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hermione!" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was no good. No doubt, they had the dungeons silenced. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Either that, or Hermione couldn't hear him anymore. Either that, or she was too far gone to—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No. No, he wouldn't allow himself to think that. Hermione was fine. She had to be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gods help him, Harry couldn't be responsible for the deaths of anyone else he loved.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This mess was all his bloody fault. He'd lost focus. Those damned hallows had drawn him in. Like Dumbledore, he had given in to their allure.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And now, because of his foolish lapse of forethought, his dearest friend was paying the ultimate price.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No. Hermione had to be alive. They had just… stopped for the night.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>'Please let them have stopped. Please let her be alive.'</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron sat down beside him, his expression as tortured as his girlfriend's screams. "I don't think I can do this without her, Harry."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He took Ron's hand and held it tight. "She's alive. I </span>
  <em>
    <span>know </span>
  </em>
  <span>she is. She… she's too strong to…."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron nodded, blinking more tears down his face, and squeezed Harry's fingers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"All will be well soon," said Luna. "The shadow dragon is watching over her."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry prayed with all his might that, this time, Luna's creatures had the right of it.</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another hour or so of agonizing silence passed, then quiet footsteps crossed the ceiling above them. In the darkness, Ron's pained grimace looked all the more dreadful. Harry didn't want to think of how terrible he must look. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sat frozen, hardly daring to breathe, and strained his ears for the slightest sound. He wished his heart would stop pounding so hard so he might hear over it. For a while, nothing happened. Then, soft clinks of metal and hushed groans met his ears.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione. Oh gods. His heart thundered in his ears. He both hoped for and dreaded the first scream. If she could scream, she wasn't dead. If she could scream, there was still hope, but the house was silent. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Until the door to the dungeons creaked, and socked feet padded down the stairs. Harry jerked up, ready to fight, and opened his mouth to growl at the sight of a lacquered head shining nearly white in the sparse moonlight. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, the light shone on a head of matted, wild curls, and his growl caught on a sob.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Her—"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Quiet, Potter," Malfoy hissed. "If you wake them up, we'll all be killed."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Give her over, now," Ron gasped, breathless and furious at once. "Get your slimy paws off—"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luna cut across him, "Oh, Dragon. Thank Merlin you're safe. Is she awake?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Barely." Malfoy laid Hermione on the floor before the bars. "She's in a bad way. You lot need to get her out of here fast."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"In case you hadn't noticed, Ferret," Ron spat, "we're bloody well trapped."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"And you have a former Malfoy house elf in there, do you not?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry choked. "Shite."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy fixed Harry with a stern look. "She will pull through, and so will you, but you've got to get your head in the game, Potter. You can't just keep running around blindly. This is war, and you're going to have to learn to use your head if you expect to survive."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"And why exactly are </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>telling us this, Ferret?" Ron glared at Malfoy. "You would just throw a party if we did die, so just sod of—"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry placed his hand on Ron's chest. "Stop. He's already saved us once tonight. Twice now." He turned back to Malfoy. "But I would like to know why, too."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's simple enough, Potter. You and I might not be friends, but the monsters upstairs would sooner murder us all than look at us. I… I'm not going to last long on that side. None of us will."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Bollocks," Ron spat. "I don't know what you're on about, Malfoy, but I don't trust y—"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Ron." Harry gave his friend a sharp look. "Enough. There's no time for this." He turned back to Malfoy. "Can you unlock the gate so we can get Hermione out?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy nodded. "As soon as you open it, sirens will go off everywhere. Give me one minute to get back into my bedroom first, then open the gate and get out."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Understood. Are you coming with us?"</span>
</p><p>Ron gave him a scandalized look. "<em>Harry</em>!"
</p><p>
  <span>Harry ignored him. "Well?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy shook his head. "I can't leave my parents in this mess. They'll be killed."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded grimly. "Watch your back then." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes." Malfoy passed Harry their wands, then went to Luna and cupped her cheek. "Be careful. Please."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"We will." She kissed his palm. "The moonwhittlers are watching over us." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"As you say." He rubbed her cheek once, then withdrew reluctantly. "Remember, Potter. One minute."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I remember."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Good." Malfoy went to the door, then paused at the threshold. "Good luck. All of you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"To you as well," Harry replied. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy nodded and swept away, silent as a cat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron gave Harry a bemused look. "Mate, what the bloody hell just happened?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I think Malfoy found a reason to fight for what's right rather than what's easy." Harry nudged Luna's shoulder. "You okay?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes. He will be okay, too. The moonwhittlers are watching over us all."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry stared. "That's… good?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of course, silly."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron made to push past him. "Come on. Let's get Hermione and go."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Wait. Give him thirty more seconds."</span>
</p><p>"<em>Harrrryyyy</em>."</p><p>
  <span>"Ron. Grow up. Unless you want his blood on your hands when we all owe him a life debt?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron gulped. "On second thought, we can wait a bit."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry rolled his eyes and regretted it immediately. "Ugh. Ow. Bloody hurts to move." He took a deep breath. "Okay, that's long enough." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He pushed the gate open and grimaced at the blare of a siren in his ear. With a groan, he grabbed Hermione's hand and cried, "Dobby, now!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Dobby is happy to helps." The elf snapped his fingers, and they were gone.</span>
