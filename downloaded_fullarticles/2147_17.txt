    <p>Tonight at midnight<br/>They will realize they love you<br/>As they pull your broken body from the ash<br/>And cast all doubts aside<br/>A miracle will occur<br/>As they realize they were wrong<br/>But it is too late<br/>For you lie cradled in the arms of endless sleep</p><p>Tonight at midnight<br/>They will realize they love you<br/>As the angels weep in silence<br/>Holding you in their embrace<br/>How very far you've fallen<br/>Just for them to realize<br/>And see what truly lies<br/>Beneath the mask upon your face</p><p>How could they ever love you<br/>Without first seeing your demise<br/>It was something they had to witness<br/>Alone through crying eyes<br/>But I loved you long before book seven<br/>And so tonight at midnight<br/>May you rest in peace in heaven</p>
