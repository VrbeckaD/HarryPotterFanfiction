    <p>It was stiff and uncomfortable, no one knew how to act, everything looked the same but felt completely wrong. 1998 was full of turmoil, war, and a couple months of recovery. No one thought going back to Hogwarts would feel this way, everyone desperately wanted to move on and pretend like May 2nd was behind them, they knew in their hearts it would never be truly behind them.</p>
<p>	“I would like to thank everyone here for returning with me. I know it is difficult, especially for those of us who have grown up here and have discovered who we want to be in these very halls but, everyone in this Great Hall should feel infused with courage, loyalty, wisdom, and ambition. It is not going to be easy but it is right, and everyone here has made the decision to forgo ease for the ability to say they made the right choice. Now let me allow the feast to begin!”</p>
<p>	There were gasps, mostly first years, when Headmistress McGonagall waved her hands and made massive amounts of food appear.</p>
<p>	“One last thing, I would like our returning 8th years, as they have been dubbed, to stay after the feast is finished, I have some things to discuss.”</p>
<p>	Heads from all four tables looked up at McGonagall, many hopeful and even more scared, it was going to be a tough year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	“Thank you all for listening to me and staying after the feast, I just have some housekeeping type things to go over and thought the other students wouldn’t enjoy hearing about them”</p>
<p>	There were some murmurs that quickly stopped as she began to speak again.</p>
<p>	“First, I am going to make a designated table for you all in the great hall and I expect everyone to use it. There is a special set of classes for all 8th years, but those of you taking courses other than general education will join the seventh years. Sadly you will not be able to join Quidditch with the rest of the school, but you are more than welcome to book the pitch and do as you please.”</p>
<p>	At this, some people groaned quietly, but everyone understood that she wanted to give the rest of the school their chance to have a normal time at Hogwarts, the 8th years were the ones imposing not the other way around.</p>
<p>	“There are some changes with the curfew, you will all have to be back on the grounds by midnight, or else you will be locked out, but I do not feel the need to tell adults when they need to be in bed. Just remember you will be expected to attend all classes regardless of how late you stay out. I have already set up a separate common room and dorms for you all. Each dorm has its own bathroom and there will be two in a room, each person from a different house, and I will not be accepting any roommate change requests, I have posted your dorm assignments in your common room and I expect you to act like civilized adults to each other.”</p>
<p>	After McGonagall made a special point of not allowing roommates to switch, the 8th years slowly became scared, but they followed their headmistress to their new common room anyway. As they walked quiet conversations began.</p>
<p>	“Alright, you will have the East Wing of the castle, the common room is through this door, it will open to your magical signatures, and just the same as all the houses, boy’s dormitories are to the left while the girl’s dormitories are to the right. The stairs will not turn into a slide if you try to approach the girls' dorms, and I trust I will not have to change that. One last reminder, your roommates are unchangeable, so don't start something you do not want to finish.”</p>
<p>	With her last words McGonagall whisked off quickly, the sound of footsteps echoed through the east wing and after a beat of hesitation, the 8th years turned and allowed the door to read their magical signatures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Did McGonagall say that we were rooming with other houses? I hope I can room with a quiet Ravenclaw, anything would be better than a Slytherin.”</p>
<p>	“Ron! Stop that now, everything is finally over and I don't want to be a part of any badmouthing, you will be happy with whomever you got paired with.”</p>
<p>	“Oh, c’mon ‘Mione! You know I’m right, but if it makes you feel better then I won’t say anything else bad.”</p>
<p>	“Fine, thank you. Now, why don’t we go and actually look at who we are paired with.”</p>
<p>	Harry watched his friends talk, not knowing what to contribute, he agreed with Hermione, they didn’t need any more anger or hate in their minds, there had already been too much for their lifetimes. He decided to hang back and wait for the crowd around the room assignments paper to dissipate, he was getting tired of crowds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Draco why have you been so quiet? You've barely said three words since we got off of the train.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about me Pans, I’m just tired. I need to find my room so I can sleep. Hopefully, my roommate won’t be anyone too bad, I can’t easily protect myself at night.”</p>
<p>“Alright if you are sure, and plus you’ll probably get roomed with some random Hufflepuff or something.”</p>
<p>“Well I’m going to go take a quick look so I can find a bed to faceplant on, coming back to Hogwarts has been exhausting.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By the time the crowd dissipated there were only two small groups left in the common room, they both walked towards the roommate list at the same time.</p>
<p>“Um, guys I think we found our roommates.”</p>
<p>	Five faces turned to Hermione, none of them looked too happy.</p>
<p>	“Oh no, you can’t be serious ‘Mione! Please tell me you are joking, we all got paired with Slytherins?!” Ron’s face paled, he hoped his friend was just messing around.</p>
<p>	“What! Let me see that paper, Granger!” Zabini quickly snatched the paper and his eyes widened.</p>
<p>	“Draco, you are not going to like this.”</p>
<p>	“Spit it out Blaise, am I with Potter or Weasley, I am not in the mood to play the world’s worst guessing game.”</p>
<p>	“Potter. I am with Weasley, and Pansy is obviously with Granger.”<br/>	“Alright now was that so hard?” Draco turned to face the other three, “Potter I am going up to our room.”</p>
<p>	“Well, I was not expecting that.”</p>
<p>	“Well, I guess that means I should go up too, Ron ‘Mione I'll catch up with you guys later.”</p>
<p>	There were four shocked faces watching the retreating figure.</p>
<p>	“Wow, I was not expecting either of them to stay calm, this will be an interesting year.”</p>
<p>	Hermione turned to face Pansy, her new roommate.</p>
<p>	“I wasn’t either, I just hope no one gets hexed while no one else is watching. Anyway, I think I should properly introduce myself. Hi, I’m Hermione Granger, your new roommate.”</p>
<p>	“O-oh um, Pansy Parkinson.”</p>
<p>	She stretched out her hand and Hermione shook it carefully as the two boys stared, not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>	“I just want to say that I hope we can make things work this year, I don’t want to be uncomfortable in my own room.”</p>
<p>	“Well Granger, I agree with you, something I never thought would happen, so I think that this just might work.”</p>
<p>The two girls walked away together, towards their room, leaving Ron and Blaise behind them, dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“This is going to be a weird year.” Blaise turned.</p>
<p>“You can say that again.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry approached the door and opened it slowly, his trunk was already at the foot of the bed closest to the door, he saw Malfoy unpacking.<br/>“Look, Potter, neither of us enjoy this but can we at least agree to not sling hexes? I’m exhausted and I don't even want to think about any protection spells.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, fine whatever Malfoy. I'm going to use the bathroom.”</p>
<p>Harry closed the door behind him and splashed water on his face, he knew the git hated him but he was not expecting-  whatever you could call what just happened. He was itching to talk to Padfoot, he spent the summer basically attached to him and Remus but he was already missing them, he wanted to tell them about his roommate and try to figure out the weird feeling in his stomach. Although it was probably just general dislike for the blonde through the door. Harry knew it was late though, Padfoot and Moony were probably already in their pajamas curled on the couch watching Defying Gravity (1997) for the umpteenth time, all he said when Harry asked why was ‘It's funny and gay, like me why wouldn't I watch it over and over?’ in a way only Sirius could, all while Remus sighed and shook his head trying to fight the fond smile that crossed his features. Harry allowed himself to get caught up in the memory until a stiff knock brought him back down.</p>
<p>“Come on Potter I haven’t got all night!”</p>
<p>Harry swiftly opened the door and walked past Draco without looking at him; he didn’t have the energy to think of a witty comeback.</p>
<p>	“I’m going to the common room, I'll try not to wake you up when I come back.”</p>
<p>	With his words, Harry grabbed some parchment and a quill and walked out of the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	The common room was blissfully empty, Harry wanted to write a letter to Sirius and Remus instead of firecalling them, at least this way he wouldn't feel bad for interrupting them.</p>
<p>	He started the letter three different times, it had only been one day, he didn’t know what to write about. He finally settled for something short and to the point,</p>
<p>	Dear Padfoot and Moony,</p>
<p>We were right, being back at Hogwarts is a little weird, McG has us all in an ‘8th’ year dorm setup and we are rooming with people from different houses.<br/>I decided not to firecall, I figured you guys were curled up on the couch watching something gay (without me, which I'm only a little annoyed about) and I didn’t want to interrupt your evening even if I wish I could be there. I’ll firecall you guys later this week once I get a response so we can talk a bit more.</p>
<p>(annoyingly) missing you already, Prongslet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	Harry finished his letter and took it to the owlery, there was one owl not up in the rafters or out hunting so Harry stuck the letter to the tawny owl and sent it on its way.</p>
<p>	He made his way back to the common room and couldn’t help but be amazed when the door swung open with no prompt, magic was awesome. He crept back to his dorm, careful not to wake anyone and when he opened the door to his room he was met with the sight of curtains drawn on a four-poster bed and a dim light coming from a small lamp by his bed. Seeing the bed waiting for him made him yawn, he didn’t even realize how tired he was. After a quick change, he fell into his bed and quickly was sleeping.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco tensed as he heard the door open, no matter how tired he was, fear crept in and didn't leave until he heard light snoring. Had Potter really fallen asleep that quickly? He was in a room with someone he had hated for seven years and just fell asleep as if he was with an old friend, Merlin Draco even resented him for his ability to sleep. As time passed Draco’s mind finally slowed and allowed sleep to take over.</p>
