    <p>
  <span>Bruce was stuck between a Stark and a hard place, and if he attempted to move in either direction, it wouldn’t do anyone any good at this point. Why was it always him? Why couldn’t it be Clint or Nat for once? He sighed dejectedly and glanced at the Stark in question. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was the New Year’s Gala hosted by the Magical Congress of the United States of America, or what they called, MACUSA. The Avengers were welcomed as honorable guests of both Harry James Potter, who was known around all magical communities as the Savior of the Wizarding World, and his best friend, Hermione Jane Stark nee Granger, known as the Brightest Witch of Her Age–as to why the latter married his friend, Tony, no one would ever know.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were in the middle of fighting Ultron and themselves when they all first met Hermione. She told them that their minds were being manipulated by a witch. Apparently, she was sent in by their government through the MACUSA to help them dispel the magic out of their heads, which worked, and she left with gratitude from everyone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unbeknownst to them all, Tony kept in contact with Hermione as she apparently left him with the parting words, </span>
  <em>
    <span>“If you need to talk about what happened…”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony told Bruce about it after he first called her. He further told Bruce how he and Hermione talked about mundane things that lasted for five to eight pre-planned </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘meetings’</span>
  </em>
  <span> until they started willingly bursting through each other’s office to complain about one thing or the other. Before neither Tony or Hermione knew it, they were talking about their feelings and pasts over multiple bottles of Fire Whiskey and Scotch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t too long after the drunken conversations that Hermione started to join the Avengers with their reconnaissance missions and battles—two years after that, they got married with all the Avengers present. This even included Vision, Wanda, Pietro, and Peter to stand by Tony’s side during the ceremony while Hermione had her best friends Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley by her side. Without question, the rest of the Weasley clan and Hermione’s parents were seated and watching.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a small event, but everyone who attended saw that even without Hermione’s and her friends’ magic, that the Starks’ marriage was, for lack of a better word, </span>
  <em>
    <span>magical</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Looking at his friend now? There was at least one thing certain; Anthony Edward Stark was seething.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you just </span>
  <em>
    <span>look</span>
  </em>
  <span> at </span>
  <em>
    <span>that?</span>
  </em>
  <span>” he hissed at his friend and confidante. “Can you believe how pathetic looking that Bulgarian Bonbon is?” he insisted, taking a drink from the first server that passed by the two men. “I mean, he’s practically drooling all over her dress! It’s not what respectable men do to another man’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>wife</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” he continued ranting as he angrily took a swig from his glass. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony had grown quiet then, no doubt continuing his rants in his mind and imagining the Bulgarian facing Iron Man’s wrath. His friend, however, had heard and seen all of this before–hell, all of the Avengers and their partners, kids </span>
  <em>
    <span>and</span>
  </em>
  <span> neighbors probably witnessed all of it before, everyone knew how mile-wide Tony’s jealousy could get. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘Not that his wife is any different from him,’</span>
  </em>
  <span> Bruce thought idly, his eyes shifting to the curly-haired brunette who hid a scarily ruthless side behind those bright brown eyes. He could see how Viktor </span>
  <em>
    <span>would be</span>
  </em>
  <span> drooling over her—if he had actually been doing so. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione wore a thin strapped navy blue gown with a slit that reached slightly above her right knee. Her heels were a simple, open strapped pair that matched the shade of her dress. Her hair fell in large ringlets over her shoulders, and her smile was warm as she conversed with Viktor. It was a sight to behold to some, but to Tony, it was a sight that made him want to gouge his or Viktor’s eyes out. More than likely Viktor’s would be gouged first. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a moment in his thoughts, Bruce returned his attention to Tony, whom he found still glaring darkly towards his wife's </span>
  <em>
    <span>companions</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Bruce sighed exasperatedly and sarcastically said, “Let it all out, Tony. Why don’t you tell us how you really feel?” knowing that the seething billionaire wouldn’t hear him anyway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Bruce was right. Tony held his glass at his lips and had schooled his features to appear cool, calm, and collected. Bruce knew better. The glare modestly hidden behind his friend’s blue-tinted shades told him that Tony was far cool and calm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Say, dear old friend of mine,” Tony drawled as he looked in Bruce’s direction, “why don’t you let out the big guy?” he heard his friend continue then add, “I’m sure he’d like to go ‘smash’ all over the poster child for </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hefty </span>
  </em>
  <span>commercials.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Steve was fortunate and made a hasty escape before Tony had gotten deep into his mood. Unfortunately, he left Bruce to be the sour man’s soundboard. “The big green guy is not your pet, you know,” Bruce reminded Tony, irritation laced in his words; it was bothersome that his counterpart was being brought up during a conversation. </span>
  <em>
    <span>As if</span>
  </em>
  <span> he would </span>
  <em>
    <span>want </span>
  </em>
  <span>him to show up at an event like this. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘Not that I’d ever let you get used in Tony’s raving plots either,’</span>
  </em>
  <span> he thought with an inward scoff. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bruce looked over towards Hermione once more in the distance with Viktor, shrugging tentatively before glancing at Tony. Nat, Harry, and Wanda are there too, but Bruce knew that Tony and only has his eyes zeroed in on the Bulgarian standing a little </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘too close’</span>
  </em>
  <span> to Hermione.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I mean...I think you could take him,” Bruce commented with a soft scoff, tilting his head as he examined the international sports star. Stroking Tony’s ego usually helped keep him from doing something drastic. Usually. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony made a grunting noise as he drank from his glass. His eyes narrowed more—if that were possible—and zoned in on the Bulgarian next to his wife. He didn't realize that his friend held his breath until he answered, “Exactly. I have something he doesn’t because I got the woman. He’s just a runner-up looking for a reaction.” Tony shook his head. “I’m not giving him that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bruce bit his lip and shifted his gaze towards the floor, unable to stop himself from speaking his thoughts aloud. “I think you kinda </span>
  <em>
    <span>are </span>
  </em>
  <span>giving him that...” he trailed off muttering to himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony faced Bruce sharply with a dangerous expression coloring his features. “Come again?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bruce shook his head quickly. “Nothing, nothing.” He shoved his hands in his pockets, tapping his foot and looking anywhere but Tony, Hermione, and Viktor. His eyes landed on a blonde that was smiling brightly and making her way towards him and Tony. He should have felt relieved that someone else was going to deal with Tony, but Bruce had a feeling this would only make things much, much worse. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bruce! Tony!” she exclaimed, her arms opening wide as if preparing for a hug. Bruce </span>
  <em>
    <span>really</span>
  </em>
  <span> hoped not. “It’s so good to see you. ” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bruce shuffled slightly, a soft smile on his face. “Always good to see you too, Pep,” he replied. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she did, unfortunately, reach in for a hug, Bruce wasn’t the one to accept it. </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘Oh, God, why?’</span>
  </em>
  <span> he thought as he watched Tony leaned into the embrace. He didn’t dare look in the direction that Hermione was in, leaning on a prayer to whoever would listen up there that she was still focused elsewhere. </span>
