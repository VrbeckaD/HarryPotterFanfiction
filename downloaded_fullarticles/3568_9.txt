    <p>Severus rolled over with a disgruntled groan. The cold air had crept beneath his chamber doors and slithered into his joints. Sitting at the edge of the bed, he allowed the chill to wake him before untangling from the warm nest of blankets, and into an even colder bathroom. The mirror above the sink had long ago been silenced, but he could tell it was itching to scold his weary appearance from the way the loose screw vibrated as it tried to break through his hex. Feeling smug at his success, he shot his reflection a satisfied smirk and turned away to pull a heated towel from the wicker basket.</p><p>A warm shower soothed his ragged, war-torn body, and he eventually slipped through his rooms and into the chilly castle corridors. The third floor, his new home now that he had acquired the long sought after DADA position, was a warmer sight than the dungeons during winter time, and his knees thanked him time again for the shorter walk to the Great Hall. </p><p>It was the first whiff of Christmas that soured his mood. A fresh wave of pine hit his nose the moment he stepped from the main staircase, and true to his suspicions, Hagrid was lugging a giant tree across the entrance hall. Time had not softened Severus Snape’s soul. He was still irritable and desperately unsociable; the damage to his reputation after Dumbledore’s death - murder, he crudely reminded himself when his thoughts dared slip that far into the past – had never entirely escaped people’s notice. The Ministry had pardoned him, sure, but only after highlighting his war crimes, and bringing to light his dodgy former years during the first war. Rita Skeeter had had a field day. </p><p>Still, he reminded himself that being alive brought some gratification; he got to hang around under Minerva’s nose for another few decades at least. They were friendly – even friends – but he knew that she could never really forgive him for killing Albus, her best friend. He strode past the bare tree, knowing that later tonight the castle would be twinkling like a fireworks display and that he’d be brushing shredded tinsel from his heels for weeks to come. </p><p>The hall buzzed with excitement as students eagerly awaited the holidays and getting to go home for a short break; the staff celebrated this forthcoming too. He took his seat – to Minerva’s left – and looked disapprovingly over his shoulder at the already erected giant pine tree behind their seats. </p><p>“You look offended, Severus,” said Minerva without looking up from her plate. </p><p>“Did you notice?” he scowled, pointedly pushing a pine cone away from his plate. “Albus didn’t even begin this early. Is that a Christmas cracker at Hagrid’s seat?” </p><p>“I think you’ll appreciate tomorrow mornings staff meeting then,” she told him and turned with a smug smile to greet the deputy headmistress good morning. </p><p> </p><p>-----</p><p> </p><p>Hermione was pleased to find her favourite seat empty when she arrived at the staff room. There was a casual murmur of conversation around the table, and she greeted each professor like old friends, though she supposed they almost were; having known her since she was eleven, and then warmly greeting her onto the staff as transfiguration professor last year. Back to Hogwarts was not where Hermione had envisioned herself. She’d done a brief stint in the Ministry after her N.E.W.T.S; mostly playing around and trying to find somewhere to fit in, but she never found solace in the ins and outs of Government life. So it was back to the old castle where she slotted happily into her mentors old position and didn’t regret a day since.  She accepted a cup of tea from Pomona Sprout with a warm thank you and settled back to await the headmistress’ presence.</p><p>The staff room door wasn’t long banging open, and for a man who used to be a spy, Snape thundered blatantly into the room with his usual stony glower. His imposing figure hadn’t changed a day since her time as a student; he was all black robes, stiff postured and stone-faced. In her short time as a professor, Hermione had learned to keep their conversation short, sweet, and to the point. They rarely came into contact outside of meetings and dining; he didn’t acknowledge her presence in the corridor, which to begin with had frustrated her because they worked on the same floor at least five times a week. Now, she had learned to accept his snark and bark as nothing more than him being a bitter bastard. </p><p>
  <i>I guess cheating death doesn’t sweeten everyone up.</i>
</p><p>The headmistress followed behind Snape, closing the door with a reproving glower of her own, and turned to greet them all. “Thank you for being here on your day off,” she said pointedly, and Hermione watched Snape’s eyes narrow in response. “As you are all aware, the festive season is fast approaching, and that means it’s time to organise our Secret Santa.”</p><p>Hermione caught her groan just in time. Secret Santa had always been the bane of her existence; she was exceptionally good at buying presents for people that she knew, but certainly not for people almost three times her age, and who all knew each other much better than she ever could. Last year she’d picked Hagrid, and after much rooting around had managed to find an old photograph of him with herself, Harry and Ron.  </p><p>“So, as is tradition, we choose names from the sorting hat, and as always, the youngest gets first pick,” she announced fondly, holding the aged old hat across the table toward Hermione. </p><p>With a forced smile, she reached into the hat and plucked out a piece of parchment, pleading with any forces that were present to please not give her Trelawney, or the brutish Professor Farlan who’d made a pass at her after one too many flutes of wine during the Halloween feast. </p><p>“I needn’t remind you all that secret Santa is anonymous and <i>obligatory</i>,” Minerva enunciated pointedly as she rounded on Snape’s callous scowl. </p><p>Snape’s face didn’t have a forced smile, only an offended look. Hermione was sure his offence wasn’t down to Minerva’s words and was instead directed to the task at hand. He plucked a piece of parchment from the hat, and she was sure he had crumpled it in his hand before stuffing it into his pocket. Which pocket was a mystery; his robe concealed most of his attire, but the wardrobe hadn’t changed much since her school days. She rarely saw Snape out of his teaching robes, save for once or twice in the warmer months when he’d attend staff meetings in just his frock coat. The collar was always adjusted so far up his neck that he seemed to constantly look down his nose at people, and she realised after stupidly forgetting, that his scars were hidden somewhere beneath the material.  </p><p>“Please keep an eye on the notice board over the next day or so as Pomona will be posting the Hogsmeade chaperones list,” said Minerva, tucking the hat under her arm when everyone had chosen a name, and perching on her own chair. “Also, we’re still undecided about the date of the staff party, so if anyone has any ideas do jot them on the board and we’ll decide next week. Otherwise, you’re free to go about your weekend.”</p><p>Hermione was sure she heard Snape mutter ‘here, here’, as he slipped out of the staffroom in a flurry of robes. <i>Hardly.</i> It wasn’t until she had finished breakfast and retired to her office, that Hermione unfolded the slip of parchment and groaned up at the ceiling. </p><p>Her Secret Santa was Snape.</p>
