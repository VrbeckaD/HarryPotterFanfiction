<hr/><p>Dean Thomas looked up to regard the looming clouds that had darkened the sky. Shell Cottage was barely visible this far down the beach, where all the choice bits of driftwood lay washed ashore, ripe for collecting. He bent over to retrieve one of the specimens, when a gentle voice stilled him.</p><p>“Not that one.”</p><p>He regarded his golden-haired Ravenclaw companion. “Sorry?”</p><p>Luna Lovegood pointed thus. “The baby turtles are using that one for shade.”</p><p>Dean abandoned it and reached for the specimen behind him.</p><p>But, Luna stopped him again. “There’s a bird nest in that one.”</p><p>He straightened. <em>This isn’t going to be as easy as I thought.</em> The thunder continued to rumble out toward the sea, making it harder to ignore his full bladder. “I’ll see what I can find over the next dune; I’ll be back in a jiff.”</p><p>“Mind the crabs; it’s mating season.”</p><p>Dean nodded and left her, stepping carefully around the debris.</p><p>Having ventured beyond the dune in question, Dean came upon another collection of driftwood. Satisfied that the area was devoid of denizens, he collected an ample amount of wood to be taken back to Shell Cottage.</p><p>A single drop of rain fell on his arm, and he was again reminded of the fullness in his lower abdomen. He set the stack aside and unbuckled his trousers. The cool wind made his penis twitch, and he sighed in anticipation of his inevitable relief, when he heard a rustling sound to his left. He instinctively looked in that direction and saw Luna Lovegood standing there, carrying a stack of driftwood she had gathered, her head cocked slightly askew, lacking in any outward expression.</p><p>Being too late to stop, a strong stream of Dean’s urine flowed, eroding the sand at his feet.</p><p>Dean blushed as he averted his eyes and bore down to empty his bladder as quickly possible which caused his urine stream to jet out into a high arc that nearly spanned the base of the dune.</p><p>Luna stifled a titter.</p><p>When he was finished, Dean buckled his trousers, retrieved the driftwood he had collected and quietly passed Luna on his way back to the cottage. He made it a point not to make eye contact with her.</p><p>Luna followed him but had a hard time keeping up as Dean's nervousness had served to fuel his brisker pace. She yelped, almost stumbling as pieces of driftwood started to fall away from her, and Dean slowed, allowing her to catch up.</p><p>They walked side-by-side along the shore.</p><p>Halfway, Luna casually broke the silence. “Your penis doesn’t look like the ones in the pictures.”</p><p>Dean clenched his jaw, keeping his eyes forward. “Wh-what pictures?”</p><p>“From SRE class,” Luna clarified. “Is it because you’re a Muggle-born?”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“You don’t have a foreskin,” Luna clarified again. “Is that normal for a Muggle?”</p><p>“My foreskin was cut off after I was born.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>He shrugged. “I don’t know.”</p><p>“Are all penises as big as yours?”</p><p>“Every bloke’s different.”</p><p>“I’m glad I’m not a boy.”</p><p>“Me too; otherwise, I’d be feeling <em>really</em> awkward right now.”</p><p>She regarded him quizzically. “Why?”</p><p>"Nevermind." He snorted, smiling in amusement at her candour. “I like you, Luna.”</p><p>She smiled in kind. “I like you too, Dean.” She looked skyward, and scant raindrops sprinkled her brow. “When the war’s over, you should come visit. Daddy recently acquired the horn of a Crumpled-Horned Snorkack.”</p><p>Dean’s brow furrowed. “What’s a Crumple-Horned Snorkack?”</p><p>Luna grinned in his direction with raised eyebrows. “I have <em>so</em> much to tell you….”</p><p>Thunder rattled the sky, and the rain finally started to fall in earnest. Fortunately, Shell Cottage was just over the next dune, so they ran.</p>
