    <p>"Mr. Snape, there's no need for such an attitude. This was just a harmless joke..."</p>
<p>"Harmless? Really? Harmless? THEY TRIED TO KILL ME! HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT IT WAS A JOKE? LET ALONE HARMLESS!" Shouted Severus at the unfairness of Dumbledore. The headmaster looked at him very seriously and the twinkle in his eyes was lost.</p>
<p>"Mr. Black will be punished accordingly for his transgression, but I'm sure that he never meant to kill you. Mr. Lupin is quite blameless, seeing as he never knew of this situation until this morning, and Mr. Potter got to you on time. You are unharmed and there is no need to raise your voice. Now, I will ask if you to keep Mr. Lupin's condition to yourself."</p>
<p>The voice of the headmaster was stern. It gave no way to arguments. Severus felt his heart break at this people's disregard for his life.</p>
<p>Dumbledore looked at the broken boy before him and felt pity for him, but there was no way that he would allow Remus to be taken down when he was not at fault for what happened. He knew that this was not the best way to go about it but he had no other choice. He'd make sure to make it up to the boy later...</p>
<p>Both Dumbledore and Snape were locked in a staring match, being looked at by Remus, James and Sirius. The first two boys were fearfully expecting a blow-out, while the third had a very satisfied 'Snape is a loser' grin plastered on his face.</p>
<p>After a moment, Severus looked down and turned towards the door.</p>
<p>"As you wish, headmaster." Said the boy in a very defeated tone. Then, when he reached the door, he added: "Forgive me for being naive and believing that my life was as worthy as any other. It won't happen again." </p>
<p>The door closed with the softest click and four shocked faces were looking at it . After a moment of silence, Dumbledore spoke.</p>
<p>"Sirius, what you did is the most stupid and irresponsible thing that I have ever seen. I am very disappointed in you. You are banned from the Quidditch team, will spend the rest of this term helping Mr. Filch with the cleaning duties of the stables every single evening and I forbid you to even look in Mr. Snape's direction after you apologize to him for all that..." </p>
<p>"What?!" Asked the grey-eyed boy in shock and annoyance, interrupting the headmaster.</p>
<p>"Do not interrupt me, boy. I have been very lenient with all of you, but this is the last straw. Can't you see what could have happened had James arrived a second too late or not at all? Severus could have been turned, or killed! And Remus would have been found out and put down. You would have been sent to Azkaban for orchestrating someone's murder, regardless of your intention! Are you really that blinded by hate towards that poor boy?"</p>
<p>By the end of his speech, Dumbledore was seething. James and Remus were pale with fright when the weight of Sirius's actions downed on them, and Sirius, for the first time in his life, looked properly ashamed of himself.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, headmaster. I-I won't ever target Snape again." </p>
<p>"It's not me the one you have to apologize to, boy. I don't want to hear another complaint related to any of you or Mr. Pettigrew, from fellow students or staff, including the house elves, or I'll have you suspended for how much it takes for all of you to learn this lesson. Is it understood?"</p>
<p>The three boys nodded, though Remus looked a bit reluctant.</p>
<p>"Headmaster?" Spoke the sandy-haired boy.</p>
<p>"Yes, my boy?"</p>
<p>"I... I don't think that I can keep myself away from Severus... Sir."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about, Mr. Lupin?"</p>
<p>"W-well, you see... I don't think that my... wolf... was trying to kill Severus..." Dumbledore raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lupin, I don't know what you think you are..."</p>
<p>"No, Sir, please. Let me explain..." Remus turned to look at his friends, a nervous expression on his face. From his bag took out a worn out book and gave it to the headmaster, open on a specific page. It looked so old that Dumbledore was afraid to even touch it.</p>
<p>When the headmaster finished reading, he turned to look at Remus and the sadness in the boy's eyes made him falter.</p>
<p>"Oh, my boy... How long..."</p>
<p>"I've suspected since I first laid eyes on him... He smelled different than any other guy... But his smell is still sweeter than any girl... I mean... I knew he was special when I met him... Yesterday night only made me confirm it."</p>
<p>James and Sirius looked at each other with confused expressions. </p>
<p>"But... How can it be possible for you to know this? It's supposed to happen until you turn seventeen..." The headmaster said.</p>
<p>"No... My instincts will compell me to claim him when I reach my magical maturity, and it will only happen when he is ready to... well... ah... to carry our pups..." Two shocked gasps were heard. "But I know it's him. That night... I wasn't trying to kill him... I was trying to... mark him... as mine." Remus's cheeks were tinted red, and all of a sudden James and Sirius understood what was being talked.</p>
<p>"Give him time, Remus. Let him heal from this trauma. I know it will be difficult for you to stay away from him, but I think it's the best, for now." The headmaster gave a sympathetic smile to the boy. "And you two, young men, must apologize and leave Severus alone. You may leave."</p>
<p>££££££££££££££££</p>
<p>James and Sirius promised to Remus to leave Severus alone, and even try to befriend him when the boy was ready to forgive them. James talked to his girlfriend, Lily, about what happened, and she gave them all a chastising that made Dumbledore's words pale in comparison. She stated that she wasn't defending her ex best friend, only remarking on their disregard for other people's lives... Even their own.</p>
<p>Somehow, Remus didn't think it wise to let Peter in on his secret, but he made him promise to keep away from Severus.</p>
<p>They were one week away from ending their sixth year and the only times in which they managed to catch a sight of Severus was during classes, otherwise the boy seemed to disappear into thin air. Remus looked for him with the Marauder's Map, and the boy went from the Slytherin common room to his classes in a straight line. They didn't even see him during meal times.</p>
<p>This bothered Remus quite a lot. It kept him in a state of constant worry due to the fact that his wolf sensed that something was wrong with his mate.</p>
<p>££££££££££</p>
<p>During the train ride back home, Severus managed to secure one of the last compartments of the train for himself, successfully avoiding Potter and his cronies. After those stupid baboons finally left him alone, no one wanted to be close to him. He wasn't the laughing stock of the school any more anyway.  </p>
<p>He gave up on trying to win Lily's friendship back since last Christmas, and the recent isolation that followed after THAT incident made him feel even more lonely and miserable. But everything would be good once he got home. He would be with his mother and they could talk and he'd get a job to start saving money for next term... He'd make sure to do well in all his subjects and get excellent grades, get a good job at the ministry and finally make enough money to take his mother away and leave the drunkard of his father. They would never see him again...</p>
<p>When Severus woke up, the train was entering King's Cross. He readied his few belongings into his rucksack and grabbed his trunk. He made sure to be of the last students to leave the train, he really didn't want to cross paths with either the marauders or Lily. He knew that no one would be waiting for him at the platform, so he quickly made his way towards the bus station.</p>
<p>It was a quick trip from London to the outskirts of Manchester, considering that it was almost night time, so, by the time he arrived to Spinner's End, the street was dead silent. He took the spare key from the loose floorboard at the entrance of his house and tried to be as quiet as possible, lest his father woke up and beat him up.</p>
<p>When he opened the door everything was in darkness, and a foul smell made it to his nose. It was awful, as if something had died and rotten there for months... Suddenly, a dark cold ran down his spine. He waited a few seconds to let his eyes adjust to the darkness and soon found the light switch. The room was a mess, there were broken bottles of beer everywhere, and some had brown stains on them. </p>
<p>Something screamed at his senses and he made a run towards the stairs. The wooden steps were covered in huge brown stains that had the shape of boots, and someone's bloodied fingerprints were dragged up the wall. </p>
<p>When Severus made it to the tiny top floor, the smell intensified, and he followed the biggest brown stain towards his parents' room. The door was locked, and a terrible fear soon gripped the lonely boy's heart.</p>
<p>By the time he managed to open the door, he was a wreck. Once he stepped inside he couldn't hold it down anymore. Histeria overpowered him at the sight of his mother's body thrown across the bed, lower parts naked and bloodied, and her throat sliced open. Her bloated, blue face still held an expression of extreme fear and pain. His father's body was besides her, pants down and cradling the dead woman. The man was on his stomach and his wrists were clogged with an awful amount of dried blood.</p>
<p>His screams were heard two streets down the road, but he was not conscious of it until someone snapped him out of his shock. It was Mr. and Mrs. Snyder, the man was soon calling the police and the woman was steering him out of the house.</p>
<p>Everything was a blur. Ambulances and patrols came and went, people gathered around the house and the boy was finally transferred to an hospital.</p>
<p>££££££££££ </p>
<p>By the time Severus finally woke, all the events of last night came rushing back to him like a wave crashing on the land. He was alone, and his sobs of grief filled the silence in the room. Soon, a nice-looking woman entered the hospital room and started to talk sweetly to him, trying to calm him.</p>
<p>Without him noticing, another nurse came into the room and injected a sedative to his IV, and immediately fell back asleep.</p>
<p>The next time he woke he felt like someone had hit him in the head with a beater's bat. His brain was pounding inside his skull, his sight was still blurry and every little noise was torture.</p>
<p>He could make out a shadow next to him. It had the shape of a triangle glued to a stick. Then he felt a warm and delicate hand touch his.</p>
<p>"Severus, my boy..." It was McGonagall. The woman saw him wince with pain and muttered an apology.</p>
<p>"You've been unconscious for two days," whispered the woman, "your mother listed me as next of kin in case you needed someone and she was... Indisposed." </p>
<p>The teacher's voice sounded pained, and Severus remembered his predicament. He choked a sob and gently rubbed his eyes with the heel of his hand.</p>
<p>McGonagall didn't really know what to do. She was sorry for the boy, and his loss gave her heartache, but she couldn't figure out why Eileen Snape had named her next of kin in case young Severus needed someone. Surely his maternal family would be willing to take care of the boy...</p>
<p>"What... What happened with her body?" asked a teary-eyed Severus.</p>
<p>"The company your father worked for paid for your parents's burial. The funeral will be tomorrow." said the witch, extending her hand to wipe the boy's tears. "I have tried to contact your grandparents, but they..." she didn't know how to break the news to the boy.</p>
<p>"They don't care. They never did. My mother was disowned when she married my father, I know. They don't want to have anything to do with me nor I with them." the anger in Severus's voice was overwhelming.</p>
<p>After the silence stretched for too long, the boy finally spoke. "Do you think that I could be allowed to stay at Hogwarts for the holidays? I don't really want to go back home, and I don't have any other place to go... I could work in the castle and earn my keep... Or in Hogsmeade... I will need the money to pay for my school supplies... Oh god. What am I gonna do?"</p>
<p>The boy was almost hyperventilating. McGonagall asured him that she would speak with the headmaster regarding his situation. She couldn't yet understand why someone would leave a child like Severus so defenseless... Of course she knew that the Prince family were proud purebloods, but to dismiss the death of one of their own so blatantly, and to say that the poor woman deserved to die like that... It was beyond her.</p>
<p>Through six years she had known Severus Snape as one to give as hard as he got. The boy was always so self reliant... And to see him crumbling before her was certainly too much. </p>
<p>Then a thought stroke her. What if this was the reason for Eileen to leave her only child in Minerva's hands? The clever girl knew that, under Minerva McGonagall's care, no child wold be left helpless.</p>
<p>Then and there the woman made it her mission to keep young Severus safe.</p>
