    <p align="center"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"><br/> Oh, great. That's great!</p><p align="left">I know exactly, why I don't actually participate in something like that. As if it wasn't bad enough already to celebrate these stupid house parties and to invite all the seventh-graders from the other houses, in the spirit of the newly won peace of the magic world. . . bla bla bla. . . .<br/> No, I idiot let Blaise talk me into taking part in this stupid, stupid child's game in a flash of total mental darkness, and now I'm stuck in a closet.</p><p align="left">With Granger.</p><p align="left">Oh wait, no - not just with Granger, but with a stupidly giggling and even-more-than-usual-annoying Granger, who obviously had a glass of wine too much. Seven minutes in heaven is the name of the game I heard about for the first time today. I laugh. Rather seven minutes in hell, I'd say.<br/> <br/> Honestly, that went way too fast! A few seconds ago, Granger had turned a bottle giggling, the thing has then pointed at me and already we were pushed by the others under loud screaming in the specially conjured closet here. It's pitch dark, and it’s also really tight in here. I touch Granger's shoulder at the slightest movement and moan in annoyance. Only 15 seconds have passed and I hope these seven minutes will pass quickly.</p><p align="left">„What's so funny, Granger?", I whisper at her and stare in the direction where I suspect her face. I can't know exactly, because I really can't see anything at all.</p><p align="left">„Oh…“, she laughs and I'm so annoyed. „...you know Malfoy, I don't think we'll ever get out of here!" What's she talking about?</p><p align="left">„What are you talking about?", I express my thoughts and lean with folded arms to the wall in my back. Even sitting is too tight in here, damn it! But instead of giving me an answer, she just keeps giggling and I wonder if she's lost her mind. And why in Slytherin's name does the Mudblood actually get drunk? I would have guessed, that she hadn't been drunk even once in her life, but apparently I underestimated this know-it-all Gryffindor.</p><p align="left">„God, please let the six and a half minutes go by quickly", I send a mumbled prayer into the darkness and I am hardly surprised, as Granger next to me bursts into a loud laugh and after a short while gasps for air. I find this one-sided conversation more than just annoying and what I also hate, is the fact that she supposedly laughs at me.</p><p align="left">„Granger, what the hell is there to laugh about? Can't you just shut up until we can get out of here? To endure your presence is bad enough already!" I'm really mad and I'm gonna hex Blaise into the next century later this day.</p><p align="left">„I'm. . . I'm sorry, Malfoy, but it's so weird!" She tries to get herself under control, which doesn't seem to work out very well to me, because I feel her body vibrating at my side, but I can't move any further away. So I try to ignore what I don't really do well, because I realize she's turned to me now and damn it again- her breasts are grazing my right upper arm and in this moment I'm probably registering for the first time in my life, that Hermione Granger is actually and truly a girl with breasts.</p><p align="left">I'll hold my breath for a moment. Crap. Luckily, she and her female attributes have already gone astray, as far as possible in this narrow space, but her voice is now closer than before, as she speaks straight to my direction.</p><p align="left">„You have no idea how this game works, Malfoy, do you?"</p><p align="left">„Of course I know how it works, Granger. We have to hang around here for about six minutes in this broom closet, until we finally get out again. How about you shut up for that long?"</p><p align="left">„Oh Malfoy…“ Granger sighs pitifully and giggles again. If I could see her neck, I'd probably strangle mher. „I almost feel sorry for you!" Okay, that's enough. Furiously I hurry forward and grasp on good luck in the air and actually I get to grasp her at her shoulders.</p><p align="left">„Granger, could you stop talking in riddles for once? What the hell are you trying to tell me?" I'm increasingly losing control, but I've never been particularly gifted at maintaining the composure when it comes to Potter and his sidekicks. For Salazars sake, this trio pisses me off.</p><p align="left">„You‘re not going to like this, Malfoy!" Granger's voice is now sweet and I suspect terrible things.</p><p align="left">„Let me worry about that by myself.“ My voice is just a growl and my grip around her shoulders increases. I'm so close to just shaking her, but I can still just suppress the urge. Granger takes a deep breath.</p><p align="left">„This game is all about doing seven minutes of indecent things in the closet, Malfoy!" By Merlin, her words strike me in the face like a punch and I let her go, so quickly as if I had burned myself. I mean, I'm not a complete idiot, of course I had thought of something like that, but hearing Granger saying it, is a completely kind of different thing.</p><p align="left">„Well, Granger?" I try to make my voice sound as bored as possible. „Actually, we can just waiste the time, what we're gonna do here for the next five minutes!" Granger giggles again and I hate the fact, that we are not allowed to have our wands with us, because they were all confiscated before the game so that nobody cheats. I wish her the plague on her throat.</p><p align="left">„Yeah, well…“, she starts and I can almost feel her twisting her eyes. „…but THAT works only with the Muggle version.“</p><p align="left">I suspect something terrible. „What are you trying to tell me?" My voice sounds slightly panicked and from now on the cold sweat breaks out.</p><p align="left">„Sooooo…“, Granger pushes around and I rest my head on the wall where I lean and close my eyes, whereby in the dark it does not matter if they are open or closed, but if you want to die, you have to do it with your eyes closed, I think. „…with the Muggle version, it's easy. You can just waiste the time and leave the room after seven minutes, but with the magic version, the rules are different. Either you've kissed at least once, and I mean a real kiss, if you know what I mean, or the door just stays closed and the time doubles. If nothing happens again in the next 14 minutes, the same - then the room stays closed for another 28 minutes and so on.“ She clatters down the details as if she had learned them by heart, but anything else would have surprised me, as Granger is a book on two legs. Her brain has to be huge, because that's where she seems to store everything she's ever read or heard. In this particular case, however, I would have preferred to not receive an answer.</p><p align="left">„Fuck, we'll never get out of here!", I curse, but the only thing Granger has to oppose, is another giggle. Stupid, sloppy Granger.</p><p align="left">„I told you!", is her short answer little bit later and that’s all. I try to concentrate, so that I can think straight to somehow find a way out of this misery, but I am painfully aware, that there is obviously no fucking way out. I realize what that means, and if I just had a little more room here, I would just collapse, but just falling over is not an option. From Granger comes from time to time an amused snorting and I envy her at the moment for her intoxication, because that would make the things definitely more bearable.</p><p align="left">All right, what options do I have? Either we are stuck here until some higher power lets us out of the closet, which may take a long time, because it is the weekend and until we have to come to class on Monday, another little eternity passes, which I do not want to spend with Granger under any circumstances. The second option is to just get it over quickly and painlessly. Merlin... I'm losing a barely audible, whining sound. What have I done to deserve this? And why is the mudblood laughing again?</p><p align="left">„Granger – it SUCKS!“, I rage angrily and out of nowhere my rage rises to immeasurable proportions. I clench my fists and slowly try to count to ten, but I don't get that far.</p><p align="left">„You just realized you have to kiss me and there's no way around it, is there, Malfoy?" Why the hell is she so unimpressed? It doesn't seem to interest her at all, that this means at the same time, that she also has to kiss me. I breathe in and out deeply. Well, then, I'll just get it over with. After all, it's dark and maybe I can manage not to think it's Granger.</p><p align="left">“Well, Granger…“ My voice sounds resigned and I try to imagine where her face is, when I turn in her direction. We are now facing each other and my hand slowly reaches forward. I graze her hair and find her head, which I hold with both hands. Shit, I'm gonna kiss Granger now! My stomach makes a funny backflip and I try not to let it show how much this takes me with it.</p><p align="left">„Just get it over with, Malfoy!" She's laughing again, that bitch. She wouldn't be so clarified without the damn alcohol, I'm sure. Slowly I approach her face with mine and the closer I get to her, the more my brain goes crazy. I try to banish any thought of what I am able to do here from my head. I now feel her breath on my face and it seems to me that she is not quite so unimpressed by the situation, because the closer I get to her, the more her breathing accelerates. I am sure that our lips will touch right now and I am almost happy, that it will be over soon, when suddenly a loud ‚dong‘ sounds and we both flinch together.</p><p align="left">„What the hell…“, it doesn't drive off me quite eloquently and as if struck by lightning I drive up again, but I still hold her head with my hands, after all I don't want to have to search again. But what does Granger do? Right, she's giggling like a jerk again and I'm just staring at her. So theoretically. Practically, I can't see anything.</p><p align="left">„Well, Malfoy, I guess that's bad luck, cause the seven minutes are up. Congratulations, you just won another 14!"</p><p align="left">„That's not true," I hear myself say, but I only suspect that it's my voice, because at the moment I sound more like a whining toddler who's had his toy broom stolen.</p><p align="left">„I think so", Granger says amused and I want to crush her stupid head between my hands. „I'd love to see your shocked face now", she says, and the rage on her whips through my body like poison. I growl up threateningly and move half a step forward and presumably that was a mistake, because her body now meets a resistance in the shape of the wall and she is now caught between this and me. She gasps in surprise and immediately tense up. I feel the curvature of her breasts on my upper body and hear how her breathing accelerates. Granger's body feels soft and warm under my own and the fact, that I don't really dislike it, surprises me now.</p><p align="left">„Is your laughter finally gone?", I murmur and before I can even realize what's happening here, my lips are crashing on hers and Granger makes a surprised sound, that goes through my marrow and leg. Shit, her lips are damn soft and I only notice, that I'm pushing her with my whole body. Not only her lips are soft, but also her breasts, the rest of her body and her cheeks under my palms. Our lips don't move, just lie on top of each other, but the moment she obviously wants to say something, because she opens her mouth slightly and tries to push herself away from me, I just press my lips harder on her and push my tongue into her mouth. Granger goes on another surprised wheeze that seamlessly turns into a moan and I can't believe I'm thinking that, but that actually turns me on.</p><p align="left">Fuck.</p><p align="left">Our tongues tease each other and I am surprised to notice, that Granger smells like a damn flower meadow.</p><p align="left">In the spring.</p><p align="left">After the rain.</p><p align="left">It's downright beguiling and the feeling of kissing her in a broom closet intoxicates me in a way, I never thought this would be possible. Probably because it's illegal. That's the problem with forbidden things, that you get the most pleasure out of them. My brain is strangely clouded and without thinking about it, I grab her hair with one hand and with the other I slowly descend to her side and grab her by the hip, just to close the remaining inches between us. Electrifying flashes twitch through my body as I feel her hands on my sides and fucking shit, Granger just puts them shamelessly under my shirt. Her fingers are suddenly everywhere, circling my spine and flying light as a feather over my side to my abdominal muscles, which harden immediately under her gentle touch. Completely caught up in my own emotions, I growl excitedly and at the same time am deeply shocked, because who would have thought, that such a little smooching with Granger could upset me so much? But it does, and Blaise will die for it, I swear.</p><p align="left">The moment I realize, that I don't care at all that I'm making out with her in this closet and admit that I like it too, is also the moment I let my hands wander deeper and deeper until they embrace her perfect bottom. With a quick movement I lift her and put her on my hip to pin her between me and the wall. Surprised she gasps and for a short moment we interrupt the kiss. Granger now clings to my body with her legs and one hand, the second hand is buried in my hair and destroys my hairstyle, but to be honest I don't care at the moment. My fuses are blowing so slowly and my thoughts are doing more than just indecent things to her. Fuck, I am hard and as if by myself my right hand looks for the way under her top, where she finds nothing but warm, soft skin. The air around us is electrically charged and my mouth begins to wander. I take her neck in fittings, draw small circles with my tongue over her carotid artery and elicit a hoarse moan from her. Oh, yes, Granger, that's it!</p><p align="left">Her grip in my hair gets stronger and she pulls it until my scalp protests. The slight pain only fuels the fire in me all the more and while I press my body against her I enclose her breast from which only a thin lace fabric separates me and I moan mentally, because I would have expected a lot, but not lace lingerie on Granger. Okay, it's official. My morale grabbed my mind at the moment and ran away screaming loudly.</p><p align="left">„Damn it, Granger…“ I'm pressing it out with the utmost effort and I'm really struggling to control myself right now. This place ain't going well for long. Actually I should know better, but rational thinking is simply not possible in this situation and therefore I grab her top at the hem and pull it up over her head in a flowing movement. She's helping me, and I'll be damned for my next thought, but I want her. For Salazars sake, I don't know if I've ever wanted anything like Granger right now.</p><p align="left">„Draco…“ Her head sinks to my shoulder and breathing heavily she wheezes my name and this from her mouth sends me straight to hell. Heaven be damned - this game will be my downfall! I impatiently pull on the thin fabric that complains about her bra, uncover her left breast, and drive my thumb over her nipple, which stretches out expectantly towards me. Granger moans again and bites me slightly in the place between shoulder and neck and sends an electric shock through my body, directly into my loins. I am intoxicated by my feelings and in my head there is no more room for doubts or insecurities.</p><p align="left">Hastily I feel with my free hand for the button on her jeans and the moment it jumps up a loud ‚dong‘ rips me right out of my intoxication. What the hell is this? No! No! No! No, no, no, no! This must now absolutely and simply not be true at all! Serious? I freeze in movement and Granger takes her lips from my neck. Only a few seconds later the door on my left jumps open a tiny narrow crack and a glistening beam of light falls on Granger, in whose face I am now gazing in amazement. She still gasps excitedly, and her half-bare breast rises and descends hectically. None of us makes any effort to detach ourselves from the other and we remain motionless in this position.</p><p align="left">„Fuck“, I curse quietly and just keep staring at her. I should drop her off and run out, but I can't.</p><p align="left">Yes, I can! But I don't want to.</p><p align="left">This realization hits me like a punch in the face and I close my eyes tortured. What have I actually done in my life, to be double punished that night? Before I understand what she is up to, Granger leans on her side and reaches for the doorknob with her right hand, which is not a big problem, as the room is really tiny and only a second later there is complete darkness again, because she has closed the door again and a loud crack confirms to me, that the locking mechanism has been released.</p><p align="left">“What?“, I ask perplexed. I really don't quite understand, but I think you have to look into it, because my brain is not really well supplied with blood right now. Granger laughs out loud, just like she laughed before and I wonder briefly if she is still capable of clear thoughts.</p><p align="left">„The good thing about the magic version of this game is, that you can just close the door again. Didn't I mention that?", she giggles and now I really don't understand anything anymore, but she wouldn't be Granger if she didn't put off the right explanation afterwards. I feel her lips close to my ear and her following words are only a whisper. “You got 28 minutes, Draco. Make them count!"</p><p align="left">Merlin and Mother Morgana, I love this game!</p>
