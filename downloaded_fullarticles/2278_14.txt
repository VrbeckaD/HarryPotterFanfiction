Of course, that had never meant that he could just give up. Aunt Petunia would never have allowed Harry to shirk any of his chores just because he was feeling overwhelmed. Going to Hogwarts had not improved the chances of him being able to retreat for a bit of respite occasionally. Even if he managed to sneak away from his friends, there was always questions when he returned, and Harry couldn’t explain why he had to get away, could he?</p><p>He had managed just fine in the past. Even during the tournament last year, he had managed to keep himself together. It had been close at times, often closer than he really liked to acknowledge most of the time. He had still managed.</p><p>Then Umbridge had happened, and now Hermione had organized this study group that she wanted him to lead, and the astrosphere in the dorms was tense because of what the <em>Daily Prophet</em> was printing about him, and he was being possessed but not by Voldemort which meant putting up with Snape ripping through his mind on a regular basis, and all that was on top of the normal activity involved in preparing for essentially his magical GCSEs.</p><p>It had all come to a head as he stumbled from yet another <em>lesson</em> on Occlumency with Snape. His head was already pounding, both from the shouted instructions that told him <em>nothing</em> and from the hostile way Snape’s magic had torn through his mind without regard for any damage he could cause. It was after curfew, and as usual, Snape had not offered to write Harry a note in case he ran into Filch or a professor.</p><p>Harry hadn’t bothered to even ask. He had already known the answer.</p><p>He was almost back to Gryffindor when he came across Luna staring out a window at the night sky. The blonde turned as he stumbled closer, intent on taking a break in the window seat with her. She immediately shifted to give him enough room to squeeze into the space beside her, which he took advantage of gratefully. He tucked his face into the crook of her neck, breathing deeply of the scent that was purely Luna, as she wrapped an arm around his back to keep him balanced against her side.</p><p>“Do you ever <em>what if</em>?”</p><p>The question was out before Harry was even aware of it forming in his head. It wasn’t like he hadn’t played that game before. <em>What if</em> he was just a little faster completing his chores? <em>What if</em> he was just a little less weird, had tried a little harder to fit among his classmates and neighborhood? <em>What if</em> he could manage to hold that gaze a little longer, or not ask that question, or to refrain from fidgeting? Would things be better? Would the Dursleys finally care?</p><p>Coming to Hogwarts hadn’t fixed anything, not like he had thought it would. It had just shifted the questions. <em>What if</em> he managed listen a little better or picked up on something a little faster? <em>What if</em> he hadn’t been a Parselmouth? <em>What if</em> he wasn’t so clingy? Would they have let him stay then? Would they have not left?</p><p><em>What if, what if, what if</em>?</p><p>“Don’t do that,” Luna cautioned gently. “Quickest way to lose your mind.”</p><p>“You would know,” Harry replied, grumpily. He winced, pressing his face harder into her neck and squeezing. Luna pressed a kiss to his temple before running her free hand through his hair. He shivered, unused to the tenderness she was showing him. Harry felt like he was both drowning and dying of thirst, with Luna being the spring of life-giving water. Quietly, she began to hum something that was tuneless and mindless.</p><p>For what seemed like the first time in his life, Harry felt that he could just be without any expectations. He let himself drift away on the current of the magic wrapped protectively around him.</p><p>Finally, he had a place that he belonged.</p></div>
